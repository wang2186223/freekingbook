###Chapter 1 Let's Divorce



The night before their third wedding anniversary, Cary Gibson emerged victorious from a high-end auction,securing a pair of rare sapphire earrings.



He said softly, "This is for the person I owe the most -my beloved."



From home, his wife, Evelina Marsh, felt tears pooling as she watched the auction on television. Tomorrow was their third anniversary, and maybe, at long last,Cary had realized her devotion.



Cary's grandmother, Demi Gibson, exhaled in quiet satisfaction. "At long last, Cary's learned how valuable his wife truly is."


The next evening, Evelina had barely set the finishing touches on an extravagant dinner when Cary stepped through the door.


She hurried to greet him, swiftly taking his briefcase before reaching out for his coat.



"Quite a feast tonight," he said lightly. "Did something happen?"



Tall and captivating, Cary carried himself effortlessly.
Even the simple act of loosening his tie appeared like a polished gesture from a high-fashion shoot.


Yet, somehow, he always managed to chill Evelina with just a few words. Her fingers paused uncertainly,and she quietly said, "You didn't forget, did you?"


No, that couldn't be right. He had purchased those priceless sapphire earrings to make amends, hadn't he?


Cary's eyebrows knitted together slightly. "Forget what exactly,Evelina?"


"The sapphire earrings...you bought them, didn't you?"Her heart trembled with unease, but hope stubbornly remained.



"How do you know about those earrings?" Cary appeared genuinely startled. He clearly didn't expect his mild-mannered, invisible wife to keep tabs on such extravagant things.



A faint smirk tugged at his lips, hinting at contempt.


Certainly, Evelina possessed natural beauty-gentle features,eyes soft and expressive-but she refused to flaunt it. She dressed plainly, appearing perpetually dull and overlooked, like a flower that had ceased to bloom.



Even the Gibson household maidseemedmore refined than Evelina.
Yet, Evelina gathered her courage, eyes shining cautiously. "I saw the auction broadcast. Those earrings are really lovely-"



Cary interjected her abruptly, "They're for Esme."



At the mere mention of his first love, Esme Barton,Cary's voice softened noticeably. "She's finally agreed to return to me. Naturally, I needed something special to welcome her back."



Evelina felt her chest tighten painfully, her breath hitching.



So,the one he felt indebted to was Esme Barton, the very woman who had abandoned him?



And what did that make her-the devoted wife who had stood beside him for three years without complaint, never even asking for recognition?



Unable to bear it, Evelina's voice wavered with hurt."Cary,have you forgotten whose fault the accident was-the one that blinded you?"



On that terrible day, Esme had thrown a tantrum over something insignificant, distracting Cary and causing him to crash.



When news broke that Cary's sight was likely permanently lost, Esme swiftly disappeared, crafting
a flimsy excuse before fleeing overseas the same day She left no trace, vanishing completely.


Their wedding had already been announced,invitations sent. Neither Esme nor her family could be located.



If Evelina hadn't courageously stepped in at the final hour, the Gibson family would've been the scandalous gossip of the whole city.


"You know nothing about it!" Cary retorted harshly."Esme wasn't to blame!"



He refused to tolerate any criticism directed at his so -called true love. "Esme arranged the surgeries for my eyes," he replied defensively. "If someone hadn't accidentally revealed the truth, I would never have known everything she secretly did for me."


Stunned, Evelina could barely form words. "What... are you saying?"



It was Evelina herself who performed his surgeries.His grandmother had practically begged her for help. She had conducted three critical procedures, pushing herself to exhaustion. Countless sleepless nights she spent tending to him, never revealing she was the renowned Sight Weaver, devoting herself entirely to Cary.
How had Esme ended up with all the credit?
"Are you certain? You trust every rumor you hear?"



"Absolutely. Esme was Professor Landen Mitchell's last apprentice-the only person on Earth qualified to perform those surgeries," Cary responded with unwavering pride and gratitude.



But wasn't Evelina actually Professor Mitchell's final apprentice? How long had Esme been pretending to be her?



Evelina desperately wanted to expose Esme's deception right then and thnere, but she quickly recalled her mentor's death six months earlier.



Of course, Esme would choose now to make her return.



With Landen gone, no one could challenge Esme's claims. And Cary, fully healed through Evelina's care,now held significant influence as head of the Gibson Group. Esme's timing was impeccably strategic.



Evelina had no evidence, no way to reveal the truth.Quietly, bitterly, she asked,"Then what are you even doing here tonight? Shouldn't you be celebrating with Esme?"



Removing her apron abruptly, Evelina felt despair gnawing painfully at her heart.
Cary's answer was casual and indifferent. "I'm exhausted, Evelina. Let's end this marriage. We agreed on three years, and I've endured it long enough."


Endured it long enough? How dare he casually dismiss all her sacrifices?



Three long years she'd sacrificed, pouring everything she had into nursing him back from blindness, making him the powerful man he had become.



Without even acknowledging the anguish on her face,Cary calmly took out a set of divorce documents,obviously prepared ahead of time. "Review them.If you have no objections, sign. I've wasted enough time already. I won't make Esme wait anymore."


Glancing over the papers, Evelina focused bitterly on the divorce settlement-an apartment far from the city center, the worn-out car she'd driven for groceries, and a mere three million dollars.



Incredible. His audacity was astonishing.



He'd gifted sapphire earrings worth three hundred million to the woman responsible for his blindness,yet offered a paltry three million to the wife who had saved him.



Three million wouldn't even cover the cost of one of her surgeries, let alone make up for the countless procedures she had rejected during these three years spent hidden away, caring only for him.


"If you want more..." Cary anticipated tears or pleading from Evelina.



Instead, she scoffed softly, picked up the pen decisively, and signed her name with determination.



Cary faltered,bewildered. He hadn't expected her to surrender so quickly. Evelina was an orphan-would she really walk away from a life of comfort? 2



Handing back the signed papers, Evelina said coldly and clearly, "It's done. But Cary, you'd better not regret your choice."
###Chapter 2 The Queen Returns





Momentarily startled, Cary recovered quickly. "Of course I won't regret this. But since you accepted the settlement, it's your responsibility to explain the divorce to Grandma."



Cary knew perfectly well that Demi only recognized Evelina as her true granddaughter-in-law. If news of their divorce reached her ears, he'd face her wrath.



And naturally, Cary expected Evelina to shoulder the blame.



Without raising her gaze, Evelina calmly replied, "I'm not explaining anything to her. In these past three years,I've settled my debt with Demi in full. Aren't you madly in love with Esme? What's wrong-can't even muster enough courage to face your own grandmother?"



Growing up in an orphanage, Evelina owed her education entirely to Demi's generosity.



So when the Gibson family urgently needed a substitute bride, she'd readily stepped in.



She didn't flinch when Cary lost his vision. Instead,she fulfilled her duties faithfully, cared tirelessly for him,and managed the household without complaint.



She had one modest request-a three-year trial. If Cary failed to fall in love with her by the end,they'd peacefully part ways.



Now, finally,her freedom had arrived.



"True love conquers everything," Evelina replied dryly,sarcasm lightly coating her words. "I genuinely hope your perfect fairytale lasts forever."



Reaching for her car keys, she found her path abruptly blocked by Margot Gibson, Cary's younger sister.



"Evelina, I heard you're divorcing my brother. That car is Gibson family property-you can't take it!"



Evelina laughed coldly. "I paid for this car myself.Honestly, Margot, you're just as brazen as Cary."



Drawn by the commotion, Cary stepped forward."What's happening here?"



Immediately,Margot complained petulantly, saying,"Cary, Evelina is taking the car, and I wwas planning to use it!"



His brow creased slightly. "Evelina, hand over the keys to Margot." "Absolutely not," she replied coldly. "Why should I?"



"You're unbelievable!" Margot lunged forward to grab the keys.



Suddenly, an old suitcase flew into the vehicle,followed swiftly by several lit firecrackers.



In moments, sparks flew and thick smoke billowed as the firecrackers erupted, sending Margot shrieking in panic.



"The car is yours-I don't want it," Evelina responded coolly, brushing off her hands as she turned decisively away.



Everything she'd used or worn in the Gibson household would remain. She wanted nothing to remind her of this place.



She quickly dialed her closest friend, Kristina Anderson.



As Evelina reached the villa gates, a sleek, understated luxuury car awaited her.



Kristina's jaw dropped dramatically. "Well, if it isn't the real Queen Evelina herself!"



Feigning astonishment, Kristina rubbed her eyes."Three years, Evelina. Every call I've made, you were too preoccupied tending to that ungrateful husband. I honestly couldn't tell whether I'd attended your wedding or your funeral back then."



Leaping forward, Kristina embraced Evelina tightly."Finally done with that 'blind' fool? Good. Now we start living for real."



Kristina snapped her fingers theatrically."Wait,no-l need to stock up on fireworks! Your grand return demands a proper celebration."


"You're too late," Evelina said coolly, gesturing casually over her shoulder.



Just then, an explosive bang split the peaceful night.The old car erupted spectacularly into flames.



Sparks scattered brilliantly, lighting up the darkness in a vivid display.



"How's that for a farewell gift?" Evelina asked with a playful grin, her eyebrow arched mischievously.


Kristina erupted into laughter. "There she is! Queen Evelina is finally back! Time to party!"



Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelina gave an exhausted sigh. "Another day, perhaps. I just desperately need sleep."



She had spent the last three years caring tirelessly for Cary's recovery, barely managing to rest properly Fatigue weighed heavily on her now.



Inside the villa, Margot was stamping her foot furiously.



"She nearly scared me to death! Has Evelina lost her mind? She destroyed our car! Cary, you have to do something about her-" 1



"That's enough!" Cary interrupted sharply.



Exasperation lined his voice as he scolded, "Is this childish tantrum how a Gibson should behave?"



Margot quickly shifted to a pleading, wounded tone,saying,"Are you actually scolding me over that woman? Wait until I tell Esme-she'll see how much you've changed!"



"Don't talk nonsense," Cary retorted iritably,though privately dismissing Evelina as insignificant compared to his sister.



He quickly softened his voice to reassure her. "Have you forgotten Jasper Russell is arriving in Aglonard soon?"



The Russell family, among lreah's most influential families, dominated politics, business, and military circles, making them untouchably powerful.


And Jasper Russell, their youngest heir,wasn't only extraordinarily charismatic but also managed the immense Russell Group. His slightest gesture sent ripples across high society.



Most importantly, he was the only bachelor among the Russell heirs. Every wealthy young woman in Aglonard and beyond fantasized about becoming Mrs.Russell.



"I haven't forgotten," Margot murmured shyly,blushing deeply at the mention of her admired figure.



She clung affectionately to Cary's arm,adding eagerly,"He's visiting for his niece's eye treatment. If Esme successfully heals Miss Florrie Russell's eyesight,she'll become indispensable to the Russell family-and undeniably valuable to us. Even Grandma will have to accept her then."



Cary gave a thoughtful nod.



Esme's supposed medical talent had drawn the Russells to Aglonard, presenting them with a perfect opportunity to solidify powerful alliances.


"And if you assist Esme during the operation and gain Miss Russell's favor... perhaps Jasper himself will notice you," he suggested encouragingly.



"Oh, thank you, Cary!" Margot's eyes sparkled as dreams filled her head.


 
But Cary's thoughts wandered unexpectedly. The image of Evelina striding confidently away, fearless and poised, lingered stubbornly



He had dismissed her as plain, passive,even boring This daring, fierce version of her was entirely unexpected.



Perhaps... he needed to reassess the woman he'd overlooked for three years.
###Chapter 3 The Wife Versus The Homewrecker
Evelina spent three uninterrupted days catching up on sleep in Kristina's luxurious presidential suite.



Aside from brief intervals of nibbling on snacks, she barely moved,with Kristina even applying rejuvenating face masks for her.



On the fourth morning, Demi called unexpectedly,requesting Evelina's presence at the Gibson Mansion.



It wasn't difficult to guess the reason behind the call -no doubt it concerned the divorce.



Kristina,however,suspected something deeper.



She said, "I doubt it's that simple. Apparently, Florrie Russell, the eldest granddaughter of the influential Russell family, recently went blind after suffering a severe head injury. The family has exhausted their options with renowned specialists and is now desperately seeking Landen Mitchell's elusive protege -the Sight Weaver.



Jasper Russell himself is arriving in Aglonard to oversee the search personally. Demi is the only one aware of your true identity, and I'm concerned she might try to-"


Evelina quickly reassured her. "Demi vowed never to expose my identity. Don't worry."



Kristina remained cautious. "Just make sure the Gibson family don't take advantage of your skills again."


"I'll be careful," Evelina replied firmly.



Still unconvinced, Kristina said decisively, "You won't be meeting them looking like this."


Immediately after breakfast, Kristina summoned her private beauty team. "Your mission: revive our sleeping beauty."



And they did. After ample rest, Evelina resembled a wilting flower that had finally received sunlight. Her skin was luminous, her features radiant, and the tiredness that had dimmed her gaze for years completely disappeared,replaced by clarity and allure.



With a refined cocktail dress and minimal yet tasteful makeup,Evelina transformed dramatically.



Kristina stood speechless for several moments before exclaiming, "Cary must've been utterly blind to trade a goddess for someone like Esme."



Precisely on time, the Gibson family's chauffeur-driven vehicle arrived outside the hotel.
Asher, the family's longtime butler, personally came to escort her. Initially, he didn't recognize Evelina at all.



He stared uncertainly until she greeted him, causing recognition to dawn suddenly. "Ms. Marsh?" He stumbled over his words. "You look absolutely extraordinary."



Within half an hour, the car pulled up at the Gibson Mansion, with Asher quickly stepping out to courteously open her door.


"Is this Miss Russell herself?" Margot hurried forward,her expression instantly switching to flattery.


Today marked Jasper's arrival, and Margot had meticulously styled herself since early morning, eager to capture his attention.



She figured it would just be Jasper showing up. The last thing she expected was a stunning woman standing at the door.



With that grace and confidence,who else could she be but a Russell?



"Margot, perhaps you should get your eyes checked."Evelina's tone was polite, edged with unmistakable disdain.



Margot's mouth dropped open. "It's you?" she whispered incredulously, jealousy flaring visibly as she examined Evelina closely.


At that precise moment, another vehicle approached.Cary stepped out gracefully, accompanied by Esme.


Yet when his gaze landed upon Evelina, he stopped abruptly, utterly captivated.



Just a few days had passed-how had she transformed so stunningly? Evelina radiated an effortless,compelling beauty.



Noticing Cary's astonishment, Esme's jaw tightened,though she maintained her gentle smile. "That's your ex-wife, isn't it?" she said softly. "Since we've run into her, you might as well say hello. It must have been challenging for an orphan like her to follow you all this way."



Esme spoke softly, but each word stung sharper than a slap-acting as if she, not Evelina, was the genuine Mrs. Gibson.


Startled out of her reverie, Margot immediately exploded in anger. "Evelina! Where did you get the money to dress up like this? Did you drain Cary's accounts for your new face and that designer dress?"


Even Esme had opted for simplicity today, avoiding unnecessary attention. Seeing Evelina effortlessly steal the spotlight was unbearable for Margot.
She hesitated briefly before hissing spitefully, "Look at you, dressed like a tramp. Trying to win Cary back?You're delusional!"



In a rage, Margot lunged forward, claws reaching viciously for Evelina's dress and hair.


Quickly stepping in, Asher intervened firmly, "Miss Gibson, please! There are esteemed guests today-this isn't appropriate behavior for a Gibson."



Ignoring Asher's plea, Margot shouted furiously, "I'll rip that smug face of yours apart!"



Remaining composed, Evelina calmly raised her phone,recording Margot's tantrum. With cold confidence, she replied, "Keep going. Let's show Jasper Russell exactly how refined you really are."



Margot froze instantly, eyes wide. Her threats died in her throat, replaced by a scorching glare. "You wouldn't dare!"



Switching tactics, Margot theatrically leaned against Esme,feigning vulnerability."Esme,please protect me.We'll be family soon-you have to defend me."



She emphasized "family" deliberately, aiming to needle Evelina.



Tenderly, Esme stroked Margot's hair as if comforting a child. "It's alright. Nobody will harm you as long as I'm here."



Evelina scoffed sharply, "Where are Demi and Elora Gibson? Since when do outsiders dictate rules in this house?"



Esme's expression turned rigid.



This wasn't the gentle Evelina they all expected. How had she developed such an unexpectedly sharp tongue?



Margot quickly retorted, "Who's the outsider? You're the one who doesn't belong here!" Turning to Cary,she said, "Did you hear what she said to Esme? You can't let her bully us like that!"



With practiced grace, Esme sighed softly. "It's okay.Evelina didn't have parents to teach her manners-it's not her fault. Cary, please don't blame her."



Evelina rolled her eyes, clearly irritated by Esme's implication.



Yet Cary saw none of Evelina's frustration. In his eyes,Esme's gentle tolerance only amplified her perfection.



Stepping protectively toward Esme, Cary embraced her tenderly before turning coldly to Evelina. His voice was cutting, saying, "If you think causing trouble will win you points, you're mistaken. It's pathetic.
Apologize to Esme right now."
###Chapter 4 Demi Takes A Stand




Without even sparing Cary a glance, Evelina replied curtly, "Maybe fix your own judgment before trying to lecture me."



Determined to avoid further nonsense, she brushed past them swiftly, eager not to keep Demi waiting.



"Don't you dare walk away from me!" Cary's temper flared,readying himself to berate her once more-but his words vanished as his gaze caught her retreating figure.



Her tailored dress embraced her flawless curves perfectly, her hair cascaded effortlessly down her elegant back, accentuating her slender shoulders and defined waist-details he'd somehow overlooked until now.



Every confident step she took radiated strength, poise,and elegance.



Even the mere outline of her form seemed captivating enough to linger in his thoughts indefinitely.



It struck him painfully: this extraordinary woman was about to become his ex-wife, yet he hadn't even touched her once.



Noticing Cary's intense stare, Esme felt a wave of irritation surge through her, and she sharply pushed herself out of his arms, storming away.



Margot immediately panicked, tugging frantically at Cary's sleeve. "What are you doing, Cary? You've upset Esme, and now she's leaving!"



Cary blinked,momentarily disoriented, and by the time he regained his senses, Margot was already chasing after Esme.



Inside the mansion, Demi sat in solitude, leaning tiredly against her ornate pearwood chair, glancing anxiously toward the entrance every few moments.



Spotting Evelina, she brightened instantly, rising to welcome her affectionately. "Evi, my dear girl, you've endured so much."



"Please don't worry yourself, Demi." Quickly approaching, Evelina gently helped her sit again,kneeling beside her to carefully massage her aching knees. "The weather is getting chilly-are your joints troubling you again?"



Demi sighed deeply. "Same old pain, dear. No one eases it like you do; your treatments are irreplaceable."


"You've treated me like family all these years, Demi.  This is the very least I can do in return," Evelina replied sincerely.



Her honest kindness only deepened Demi's regret.



"That foolish grandson of mine-blindly letting go of such a gem! He deserves a beating," Demi replied softly.



Evelina gave a gentle shake of her head. "It's alright,Demi."



Tenderly, Demi pleaded, "Evi, sweetheart... just once more,can you give Cary another chance-for my sake?"



"I've waited three long years for him to see me. He never did. Another chance wouldn't change anything,"Evelina answered quietly.



She had offered countless opportunities, but Cary had repeatedly wasted them. It was finally time to let go.



Demi sighed heavily, sorrow evident in her tone."Perhaps it's just fate... our family wasn't fortunate enough to hold onto someone like you."



Her eyes glistened with tears.



Just then, Margot and Esme entered noisily, chattering cheerfully alongside Cary's mother,Elora Gibson.



Demi's temper erupted immediately. She snatched up a nearby coffee cup and threw it furiously toward Esme's feet.



Fragments of porcelain scattered violently, coffee splattering across Esme's luxurious heels and the delicate fabric of her custom-made gown.



A sharp cry escaped Esme's lips as she stared, utterly horrified. Though appearing deceptively understated,every stitch of her attire was meticulously selected from exclusive boutiques-her dress alone carried a hefty price, deliberately crafted to exude graceful elegance.



Predictably, the Gibson mother-and-daughter pair,notorious for their lack of fashion sense, were oblivious to its true value.



"What was that about, Grandma?" Cary exclaimed,swiftly stepping forward to shelter Esme once more,flashing a bitter glance toward Demi.


Demi,however, remained fiercely unapologetic. "How dare you even ask? Without this woman's antics,would you have had your accident? Would you have lost your sight?"



More painful to Demi than Esme abandoning their engagement was the reality that Esme had almost irreversibly ruined Cary's bright future. Demi had always seen Cary as her greatest pride Esme hadn't just harmed her grandson, she'd damaged the entire Gibson legacy.



"I've said this countless times," Cary responded in exasperation. "Esme wasn't responsible for that accident. Why can't you trust me?"



His accusing stare shifted pointedly toward Evelina,who was quietly comforting Demi, gently rubbing her back to ease her breathing.



It had to be Evelina causing trouble again-poisoning Demi's mind.



Without restraint, he said sharply, "Evelina, have you been whispering lies to Grandma, stirring things up behind our backs?" 2



Seizing the opportunity, Elora, who had always despised Evelina's modest upbringing, immediately spat venomously, saying, "Of course it's her! That orphan would do anything to cling onto this family.She may act sweet, but beneath the surface, she's utterly despicable!"



Before Evelina had the chance to defend herself,Demi interrupted harshly, "Enough! Evelina is the granddaughter-in-law I chose personally. Do you dare disrespect her right before my eyes? Are you openly challenging my authority?" Elora blanched visibly, quickly stammering, "Demi, I didn't mean-"



Seeing his mother close to tears, Cary intervened protectively, "Grandma, please stop scolding Mom Let's just face reality-you simply don't want me to leave Evelina."



Turning deliberately, he took Esme's hand firmly into his own, fingers intertwined intimately. "But that's non -negotiable. Esme is the one I love-she is my only future."



"Excellent. Marvelous. Absolutely perfect," Demi responded bitterly, each word dripping with harsh sarcasm.Anger visibly surged through her,shaking her frail body.



Reacting swiftly, Evelina retrieved a vial of heart medication, administering it carefully to Demi.


After a brief pause to regain composure, Demi said with cold certainty, "Then let me be clear. Divorce Evelina, and you must immediately surrender ten percent of your Gibson shares directly to her. And Esme? She will never set foot inside the Gibson household again while I'm alive."



Cary's eyes widened in alarm. "Grandma, you can't mean-" With fierce authority, Demi's frail hand slammed against her chair's armrest, the sharp noise resonating clearly. "I've spoken, and my decision is final," she replied resolutely. "Defy me, Cary, and you forfeit your place as a Gibson."
###Chapter 5 Imposter



"Grandma, are you serious? Shares for her?" Margot immediately protested,indignation coloring her voice."She's nobody-just some orphan without parents-"



Margot's rant was swiftly silenced by Demi's piercing glare,causing her to retreat sheepishly, shrinking like a scolded child.



Quiet sobs emerged from Elora. "Demi, Cary is your own grandson..."



With a dismissive snort, Demi retorted sharply, "I have more than one grandson. If he insists on chasing love blindly, let's see how deep his pockets run."



She intended to expose the harsh reality to Cary-if Esme had abandoned him during his blindness, she'd undoubtedly vanish once he was penniless. Esme was trouble incarnate, certainly not the kind of woman who'd stick by him through hardships.



Muscles tense, Cary's jaw tightened noticeably, his temple pulsing with barely contained anger. Directing his resentment at Evelina, he said bitterly, "Satisfied now?"



Though Evelina was deeply moved by Demi's fierce support,she remained composed, gently supporting the elderly woman to help stabilize her breathing



Demi battled chronic blood pressure issues, a weak heart, and aching joints sensitive to seasonal changes.



Had Evelina not worried these ungrateful relatives might push Demi toward a heart attack, she would've already walked away.



"Ma'am-Ma'am!"



Abruptly, a flustered servant hurried into the room,gasping for breath. "Mr. Russell... hne's arrived!"



"Bring him in." Demi straightened quickly, regaining her composure to receive their distinguished guest.



Margot scrambled anxiously, nearly stumbling over herself. "Mom! Am I perfect? Is my hair okay? Makeup flawless?"



With maternal pride, Elora reassured her daughter warmly. "You're stunning, sweetheart. Absolutely flawless-" Her thoughts darkened instantly,wishing fervently Evelina wasn't present.



Sharply pivoting toward Evelina, Elora said,expecting an important guest. Shouldn't you discreetly leave through the back entrance?"



Still holding Demi gently, Evelina smiled serenely, unfazed. "Thanks for reminding me. Actually,Cary and I haven't officially divorced yet. Legally speaking, I'm still his wife-a rightful member of this family."



She cast an indifferent glance toward Esme, still melodramatically crying into Cary's chest. "But Miss Barton here... she's merely the mistress. Hardly appropriate company to welcome a respected visitor."



"How dare you!" Esme gasped, tears streaming theatrically down her cheeks.



Cary immediately stepped forward protectively, his expression stormy. "Mind your tongue, Evelina! Mr.Russell came specifically for Esme. She's exceptional -the only one skilled enough to restore his niece's eyesight."



His words halted Demi's departure. Slowly, she turned back, astonishment evident. "Who did you say could cure blindness?"



"Esme," Cary said proudly, his chest puffing with pride."Renowned as the Sight Weaver herself. She was personally trained by Professor Landen Mitchell-she even cured me."



At that moment, Demi finally got it-why Evelina had decided to give up on her grandson.



Honestly,she wouldn't blame her one bit. "Esme, is this true?" Demi's tone sharpened dangerously, her eyes narrowing.



Unable to meet Demi's piercing gaze, Esme remained nervously silent.



Yet Cary,unaware, kept lauding Esme's supposed talents, with Elora and Margot eagerly chiming in,elevating her to almost mythical status.



A low, commanding voice smoothly interrupted their exaggerated praise. "Seems I've arrived at the perfect moment."



Standing confidently at the end of the hallway was a tall man, his broad shoulders and authoritative aura instantly capturing everyone's attention.



Elora instantly beamed with anticipation. "Mr. Russell,you're finally here-we've been waiting eagerly!"



Though she'd never personally met Jasper Russell, a single glance at his immaculate attire, particularly the sophisticated handcrafted shoes, confirmed his identity.



Overwhelmed with excitement, Elora practically dragged Margot along as they rushed to welcome him.



Margot, blushing fiercely and visibly nervous,nearly stumbled in her eagerness. Just as she opened her mouth to greet him, the man strode right past her without acknowledgment,stopping purposefully in front of Esme. "You're the renowned Sight Weaver?"



Esme felt her pulse quicken painfully.



She was all too aware of the consequences of deceiving someone of Jasper Russell's caliber-there was absolutely no room for error.


"I... I apologize," Esme stuttered hastily, desperation evident. "My dress got stained. I need to change immediately."



She quickly spun around, eyeing the nearest doorway for escape.



However, Evelina's composed voice stopped her cold."Miss Barton,surely you're not running away already?Could it be because you're pretending to be Professor Mitchell's student?"



Evelina's calm accusation sliced through the tension like a sharp knife.



If Esme was set on snatching up a cheating jerk like Cary,she could have him-no one was stopping her.



Yet,shamelessly exploiting her mentor's reputation to climb the social ladder crossed an unforgivable boundary.



"That's nonsense!" Esme retorted furiously, glaring daggers at Evelina.



Aware all eyes were on her, Esme continued her charade desperately. "I studied under Professor Mitchell in graduate school, while you were busy playing housewife and folding clothes."



"Oh?" Evelina's soft smile was deceptively gentle. "If that's true, then surely you know how many surgeries Cary underwent to regain his vision?"



She had personally conducted three major surgeries,alongside one subtle corrective procedure she'd never publicly mentioned.



After a hesitant pause, Esme confidently replied,"Three, obviously.I performed each myself."



"You're lying." Demi's voice sliced sharply through the air. "It was four."



Esme visibly paled before hastily correcting herself,saying,"R-right,four! Of course it was four."



"Make up your mind, Esme-was it three surgeries or four?" Demi asked coldly, her voice dripping with disdain.
###Chapter 6 The Bet



Esme visibly recoiled under Demi's demanding glare,her palms suddenly slick with nervous perspiration.



Desperately, she stammered an excuse. "There have been countless surgeries... I honestly can't recall each one clearly-"



surgeon who forgets the procedures she has performed?" Evelina smoothly interrupted, her voice tinged with mockery. "It seems you're nothing but an imposter. Care to prove me wrong with a little wager?"



Margot burst out indignantly. "Who are you to challenge Esme like that?" But she instantly fell silent when Elora silenced her sharply, reminding her of decency.



Completely unfazed, Evelina's eyes sparkled with quiet defiance as she addressed Esme again, saying,"Miss Barton, if your claims are legitimate, surely this won't faze you?"



"Fine! I accept your ridiculous bet." Esme tightened her grip around Cary's arm, convinced she saw right through Evelina's game. "You're clearly desperate to win Cary back, aren't you?"
"Pathetic," Elora sneered disdainfully.



For Elora,wealth equaled respectability. Those lacking it deserved neither acknowledgment nor courtesy.



Refusing to be provoked, Evelina coolly fixed her gaze on Esme, her tone deceptively gentle. "Here's the bet -prove you can restore Florrie Russell's sight."


"Enough of your slander!" Cary growled angrily."Esme reviewed Florrie's medical records herself and assured me she can treat it!"



Earlier, Cary had handed Esme the detailed medical reports sent by the Russell family. She had confidently declared Florrie's condition manageable.



Privately, Esme cursed Cary's gullibility. She'd made those promises purely to sound impressive, not expecting they'd be seriously tested.



"Wonderful," Evelina responded calmly. "Then let's be clear-if you fail, you'll apologize publicly at Professor Mitchell's grave and confess your deception to the global media."



She looked forward to seeing Esme squirm her way out of that scenario.



"You're shameless," Cary scoffed dismissively. "You'll do anything to tarnish Esme's reputation. What if she succeeds-what then?"



Without skipping a beat, Evelina responded confidently, "Then I'll openly admit my error for everyone to see."



"Not good enough!" Margot interjected fiercely. "If Esme wins, you'll vanish from my brother's life forever!"



"Agreed," Evelina affirmed without hesitation. Her eyes scanned the room thoughtfully before settling deliberately on one individual. "Would you witness our bet?"



Looking up to meet her unwavering, clear gaze,the distinguished man hesitated briefly, then agreed simply, "Certainly."



Flashing an effortless, radiant smile, Evelina replied confidently, "Good. With a credible witness present,no one can wriggle out of this later."



Instantly defensive, Esme retorted bitterly, "Who exactly are you accusing, Evelina?"



"Enough!" Demi's voice thundered decisively,silencing the room immediately. "Esme, remember your place."



This impostor dared present herself as the legendary Sight Weaver in front of the prestigious Russell family?She risked dragging the entire Gibson lineage through disgrace.



Gratefulness washed over Demi as she realized Evelina's presence was their only saving grace.



Evelina leaned close to Demi, whispering reassuringly,"Leave Miss Russell's treatment to me-but it will be the final favor I ever grant the Gibson family."



With quiet resolve, Evelina turned gracefully and exited without another glance.



She was done wasting her time in this toxic environment.



Elora rejoiced at her departure. Worried the Russells might confuse Evelina for family, she loudly called after her, "Cary will handle the divorce papers first thing tomorrow. Don't you dare delay!"



Intently, the handsome man observed Evelina's departure, his thoughtful eyes narrowed with intrigue.



Unaware, Elora pivoted to him with exaggerated politeness. "Mr. Russell, please stay for lunch-my daughter has prepared a special performance in your honor."



He barely acknowledged her offer, dismissing it curtly."No,I have other matters to attend to."



Fixing Esme with a steely, unreadable gaze, he continued evenly, "Miss Barton, since you've confidently claimed you can treat my niece, I expect you to be fully prepared. The first operation is scheduled in one week's time."



Only one week?



Panic surged through Esme immediately. "I-I might need more preparation time-"



"That's your concern, not mine," he replied coldly."You'll have top-tier equipment and a skilled medical team at your disposal. Just ensure your success. State your fee."



He wasn't expecting miracles instantly-but if she couldn't even begin the procedure, her deception would be blatantly clear.



As he turned away, Margot hurried forward, eager to accompany him.



Within a few steps, the bodyguards swiftly redirected her, sending her back in embarrassment. Angrily,she stomped her foot, sobbing dramatically as she rushed to Cary and Elora for comfort.



Demi leveled a stern glare in Margot's direction."The Russells are beyond your reach-accept it.And you-"She turned sharply on Elora. "Teach your daughter some dignity."
###Chapter 7 Evelina Must Die
 Evelina hadn't yet reached the hotel when Kristina's eager voice came through the phone.



"Well? Did you get a glimpse of Jasper Russell? Is he really as ridiculously attractive as everyone says?"



"Unfortunately, no," Evelina replied, her tone lightly teasing. She knew exactly what Kristina wanted-juicy gossip. "The man who appeared today was probably just an assistant."



Though she'd never met Jasper face-to-face, Evelina immediately recognized that today's visitor, impressive though he was, lacked the unmistakable aura of someone who wielded absolute authority.



Of course, she wouldn't dream of sharing this piece of gossip with Margot. Better to let that fool chase shadows.



If Margot truly dared pursue Jasper, she'd drag the entire Gibson family into a spectacular downfall.



"Predictable!" Kristina's curiosity vanished in an instant."The Gibsons should feel honored an assistant even bothered with them. Margot genuinely believes she'll marry into the Russell family? Please! Does she even know what happened to the last woman who dared chase after Jasper? Her entire family disappeared from Ireah's elite overnight."



Born into the powerful Anderson family, Kristina had always steered clear of Jasper.


The man was notoriously ruthless, viewing the world through a stark lens of allies versus enemies. Romance or sentimentality held no meaning to him



Regardless of his exceptional physique, undeniable charm, or striking appearance, Kristina stayed well away.



"On another note, my Queen." Kristina swiftly changed topics. "I've signed some promising new talent. Mind coming by to take a look?"



Despite her family's dominance in luxury hotels globally, Kristina had chosen a different path entirely.


Launching her own entertainment company had become her passion, and scouting handsome young talents from around the globe her specialty. Once refined, she'd thrust them confidently into stardom.



Evelina possessed an uncanny instinct for recognizing genuine star power-two of her selections had already risen to immense fame. Naturally, Kristina always sought her input.
"Sure." Evelina accepted without hesitation.



Simultaneously, not far away, Jasper sat quietly in the back seat of another vehicle, his phone pressed to his ear as lan Payne, his assistant,relayed details.


"Sir, Esme Barton is definitely hiding something. But Cary Gibson's soon-to-be ex-wife, Evelina Marsh...she seems intriguing. Almost as if she's certain that Esme is a fraud."



"Soon-to-be ex-wife?" Jasper's smooth voice held a subtle intensity. "They're getting a divorce?"



"Yes, in progress," lan explained quickly. "But Cary is openly flaunting his relationship with Esme."


"Disgusting." The single word dripped with cold disdain.



Renowned for his composure and cold demeanor,Jasper rarely showed emotion openly. Thus, when he spat out the word "Disgusting," lan immediately recognized the subtle shift in his tone.



"All of Cary's eye surgeries occurred after his marriage to Evelina," lan continued thoughtfully. "Recovery periods, postoperative care-she was there through everything. Evelina must be closely connected to the genuine Sight Weaver."



Before even setting foot in Aglonard, Jasper had meticulously investigated everyone tied to Cary.Overlooking details simply wasn't in his nature.



"Keep a close watch on her," Jasper instructed coldly."And find whatever means necessary to unearth the truth."



"Understood,sir."



Meanwhile, at the Gibson Mansion...


Margot had been sobbing dramatically for over thirty minutes straight. "We're still influential-why shouldn't I have a shot at him? Why does everyone treat me like I'm not good enough?" she cried out. 4


Completely infuriated, Elora and Cary had long since abandoned Margot to her tantrum and gone for their meal. Esme, however, lingered patiently, soothing Margot's wounded ego. "Margot, can't you see what's really happening here?"



Esme paused deliberately, sighing gently as she cupped Margot's chin, forcing their eyes to meet. "Do you really think Evelina showed up today dressed like that just to irritate Cary?"



Margot immediately perked up, suspicion flashing in her eyes. "Esme, did you notice something strange?"



Playing her role expertly, Esme softly explained, "It's quite possible the butler tipped Evelina off about Mr. Russell's visit today..."



"You mean-she's after Jasper?" Margot's eyes blazed,her expression contorted in jealousy. "How dare that tramp try to seduce another man right under our noses!"



Esme patted Margot's shoulder affectionately, like a concerned older sister.



"It's exactly like her. Realizing she lost Cary to me,she's desperately looking for her next target," Esme whispered.



"Please," Margot sneered dismissively, "Mr. Russell wouldn't glance twice at a nobody like her."



"Certainly not," Esme replied smoothly. "Compared to an elegant and refined lady like yourself, she's insignificant. But some men are easily tempted by those bold women. While Mr. Russell would never marry someone like her, it won't stop her from attempting to seduce him."



"She wouldn't dare!" Margot practically screamed,cheeks blazing with fury.



"Margot, sometimes it only takes one night," Esme murmured slyly. "If Evelina manages that, she'll be set for life financially. Isn't that temptation strong enough for someone like her?"
With that single remark, Esme cleverly transformed Evelina from mere annoyance to grave competition.



Margot trembled violently,fury consuming her entirely.Seizing the perfect moment, Esme casually teased her, "Didn't Hayden Reid mention his contacts-those hired thugs he's friends with?"



Margot's eyes widened eagerly, and she instantly grabbed her phone to dial Hayden's number. "Hayden?Remember how you've been begging me for a date?Do one thing for me first-get rid of someone. Then I'll gladly accept."



Behind Margot, Esme's lips curled into a cold, satisfied smirk.



How dare Evelina humiliate her in front of the Russell family? Esme wouldn't rest until Evelina was permanently out of her way.
###Chapter 8 The Perks Of Royalty
As darkness enveloped Aglonard, the city pulsed vibrantly under the glow of neon lights.



Pulling up sharply in front of the dazzling Dusk Lounge,Kristina flashed Evelina a triumphant grin. "Your Majesty, we've arrived."



Stepping onto the bustling sidewalk, Evelina raised an eyebrow skeptically. "I thought we were scouting talent tonight. What's with the infamous venue choice?"



This wasn't just any nightclub-Dusk Lounge was the hottest, most notorious destination in the city,notably a favorite haunt of Cary's after his eyesight had been restored,mainly to avoid returning home to Evelina.


"Exactly where I scout my fresh faces," Kristina replied breezily, looping Evelina's arm firmly with her own and pulling her through the vibrant entrance. "I've devised a fun little game tonight, and you're gonna adore it."



Catching Evelina's skeptical look, Kristina insisted enthusiastically, "Don't even think about ditching me.Last time I promised you a divorce celebration, you chose sleep instead. You've rested enough after your ordeal with the Gibsons-now we celebrate."
Grabbing a lavish bundle of bright red roses from the reception counter, Kristina quickly deposited them into Evelina's confused arms.



Evelina blinked, baffled.



With a mischievous smile, Kristina explained, "I've got a hundred fresh candidates performing tonight. Like someone? Toss him a rose."



Lowering her voice, Kristina continued, "The others get just one pink rose each-you have ten bright red ones. Whoever catches your eye tonight receives top -tier management and resources."



Evelina stared incredulously. "Ahundred men to judge?Are you running a beauty contest or something?"


Laughing delightedly, Kristina twirled and opened her arms grandly. "The perks of royalty!"


Evelina sighed deeply, pressing her fingers to her temples, reconsidering the comfort of her bed back at the hotel.



Relentlessly determined, Kristina practically dragged Evelina into the club's VIP section-an exclusive front -row seat with an unrivaled view of the stage.



Half an hour passed, then the club exploded into dazzling lights, booming music, and a glittering shower of confetti.



Men streamed onto the stage, performing in groups of ten, as wild screams filled the venue. "He's amazing!I'm in love!"



Yet Evelina remained indifferent, barely lifting her gaze from her drink, clearly uninterested.


Kristina was visibly distressed. "I brought you here to unwind, not take vows of celibacy! A hundred men and you're unmoved?"



Feeling a little woozy from her drink, Evelina made her escape attempt. "Let me freshen up. Be right back."


"Don't forget your roses!" Kristina protested, thrusting the bouquet firmly back into Evelina's hands. "You're not leaving until every rose finds a recipient."



Helplessly smiling, Evelina wandered toward the restroom with roses in hand.



She emerged from the bathroom feeling clearer-only to run directly into Cary and Margot.



Margot immediately wore a look of disgusted accusation. "See that, Cary? I told you she's shameless-look how she's dressed, desperate for attention!"



Margot swiftly pulled out her phone, snapping a quick series of photos capturing Evelina's appearance.


She wasted no time, immediately forwarding them to Hayden with a message, saying, "That's your target. No need to hold back-she's just an orphan. No one will miss her."



A wave of disgust surged through Cary as he scowled at Evelina, his voice dripping with disdain. "Is this really how low you've sunk? Coming here dressed like that -do you have no shame at all?"



But tonight, Evelina was worlds apart from her usual reserved elegance. Tonight, she was electrifying.



Her vivid red lips and glossy, slightly hazy eyes,paired with the daringly cropped denim outfit, exuded an intoxicating confidence-bold, fierce, and irresistibly captivating.



Any man in his right mind would have been mesmerized instantly.



Frustration boiled over within Cary. The woman he'd always dismissed as bland now radiated allure. Worse still-he found himself irresistibly drawn to her, making Esme's demure elegance suddenly appear dull by comparison.



Evelina returned his gaze, unfazed. "We're no longer married, Cary-remember? You have no right to comment."
Gathering her roses confidently, Evelina began to walk away.



Yet, the vibrant crimson bouquet seemed to ignite something possessive within Cary. Grabbing her wrist,he demanded jealously, "Who gave you these roses?Which man-?"



Without bothering to answer, Evelina sharply stomped on Cary's foot.


"Ah-damn it!" Cary recoiled, stumbling in pain as he released her wrist.



"Cary, are you hurt?" Margot hurried forward, glaring venomously at Evelina. "You're insane-how dare-"



She abruptly silenced herself, hastily smoothing her appearance.



Several handsome young men, contestants fresh from the stage, casually strode by, heading backstage.


Evelina was about to vanish quietly when her eyes caught sight of someone at the tail end of the group.


He had an exquisitely chiseled face and striking,defined features, his tall physique emanating unmistakable confidence and calm authority.



Exactly the type Kristina dreamed of finding-a prime candidate destined for superstardom.


Perhaps slightly older than the others, but that lent an intriguing maturity. Stardom was unquestionably within reach for him.



Excitement gleamed in Evelina's eyes. Finally, a worthy candidate. Boldly, she approached him,extending the bouquet. "I've been looking for someone like you all night. These roses are yours-all ten of them. You're my choice."



The man halted, an eyebrow arching subtly. His deep,magnetic voice was compelling. "Are you certain about this?"



Jasper Russell's penetrating gaze assessed her, and the atmosphere in the corridor instantly grew tense.Even Cary, watching from a distance, felt a strange chill down his spine.



What was happening here...? Who exactly was this stranger?
###Chapter 9 Rising Star



Evelina, somewhat inebriated, failed to grasp the atmosphere,focusing instead on the unease brewing in her gut.


She selected a vibrant red rose from the bouquet,gently pressing its petals against the chiseled jawline of the man standing before her. "Don't hold back,rising star. With your looks? You're clearly destined for the spotlight."


While speaking,Evelina casually broke the stem and placed the rose in his suit pocket as if it perfectly belonged there.


The man, Jasper Russell, clenched his jaw, his face turning cold.



A rising star? Did this woman genuinely mistake him for a male escort?



"Stop this now!" In an attempt to defuse the situation,Cary intervened abruptly, forsaking his previous concern for Margot. He seized Evelina by the arm,steering her towards the door. "My apologies, sir-she's not herself; she's had too much to drink."



He nearly introduced her as his wife but swallowed the term at the last moment.



"I am not drunk. Release me!" Evelina shot him a fierce look, pulling her arm away. "We're divorced,remember? Start acting like it."



Evelina, with no word of apology,thrust the remaining roses into Jasper's hands and made her exit.



Cary,seething, hurried after her. "Evelina, what on earth are you doing? Flirting with someone else right in my presence?"



Unfazed,Evelina continued on her path, not giving him the satisfaction of a response.



Her silence only fueled his anger. "Seriously? This is what you've come to? This is your big move to get my attention? Pathetic. You're acting like some spoiled kid."



She halted, turning to face him with a weary and dismissive gaze.



"Finished?" Evelina asked, her voice dripping with fatigue. "I'm eager to get some rest. And don't flatter yourself.I've never loved you, and I never will."


Cary's expression contorted with frustration. "Alright then! Tomorrow at eight, the courthouse. We finalize the divorce. Don't be late."
Her eyes sparkled with relief. "Sure," Evelina replied with a radiant smile. "And if you're late, prepare to imitate a dog."



They went their separate ways after the exchange; he reentered the venue, she walked away.



Outside, as Evelina waited for her taxi, she quickly composed a message to Kristina, saying, "Located your 'rising star.' Mission accomplished. Off to bed now."



Just as she was about to send the message, a dark figure loomed behind her.


She turned sharply, only to be caught off guard.


A sack was thrown over her head, plunging her into darkness as her phone clattered to the ground.


Two minutes later, Margot's phone vibrated with a new message.



Margot,having discreetly followed a group of trainees backstage, blended in unnoticed by the staff who mistook her for a crew member, allowing her to move freely behind the scenes.



Margot was indulging in the scene before her when Hayden's call interrupted her reverie. She picked up with enthusiasm. "You secured her? Excellent, Hayden, this will definitely count in your favor."


Suddenly, Cary's voice interrupted from behind."Secured who?"



Startled, Margot ended the call abruptly. "C-Cary?What brings you here?"


He seized her wrist, pulling her from the scene. "I was looking for you! This isn't a suitable place for someone of your standing."



As he recalled her conversation with Hayden, he warned,"Keep your distance from the likes of Hayden Reid. He's bad news. Remember, you're to marry into the Russell family. It's time you behaved accordingly."


"I know, I know..." Margot beamed as she latched onto his arm, all sweet and cheerful again while they walked away from the backstage area.



Yet,her eyes betrayed a sinister resolve.



"Evelina won't escape this time. Nobody will come to rescue her," she thought.
###Chapter 10 Offending Jasper Russell



The music on the club's first floor had come to a sudden halt, signaling the end of the talent show.



Kristina and the owner of Dusk Lounge, were escorted to the largest VIP suite upstairs.



Jasper occupied a spot on the leather couch,his face a mask of cold indifference. Arrayed before him on the table were ten bright red roses.


Standing nervously like a troubled schoolgirl, Kristina shifted uncomfortably under his gaze. She mustered up some courage and said, "Mr. Russell, I can explain...This isn't at all what it seems-"



Interrupting her, lan's voice cut through the tension like a knife. "MAs. Anderson, since you seem to recognize the owner of these roses, I suggest you bring them forward."



While his boss had stepped out for a brief bathroom break, a misunderstanding occurred. In those fleeting moments, he was mistaken for a new trainee and ended up with the roses.



Jasper Russell was not the type to let such an  embarrassment slide without consequence.


"Let's try to ease the atmosphere, Mr. Russell," Kristina pleaded, her hands joined as if in prayer, begging for leniency.



Selling out Evelina was not an option for her, not unless they drove her to the brink.



lan threatened, "Don't make us go hard on you."



Though lan would never physically intimidate a well-to -do heiress directly, a simple gesture towards the stern female bodyguard was enough to imply the threat clearly.



The mere suggestion made Kristina go rigid with fear.



Before Kristina could respond, the strain became too much for the owner of Dusk Lounge.He blurted out,"I'lI tell you! The roses were meant for Ms. Anderson's friend-"



At that moment, Kristina glared at him fiercely. The owner was about to reveal Evelina Marsh's name when Jasper's phone interrupted the tension.



He answered the call.


"What?!" In a flash, Jasper was on his feet, his eyes blazing with intensity. He stormed out with lan and the bodyguards in tow,not once looking back at Kristina or the owner of the club.



The moment the door of the suite slammed shut, the owner crumpled to the ground,mopping his brow.



He exhaled sharply, bewildered. "What just unfolded here?"



Sinking into the couch, Kristina let out a breath as if she had narrowly escaped disaster.



After taking a moment to drink some water and gather her thoughts, she answered, "It's clear, isn't it?Something urgent must have cropped up concerning Jasper's family. He wouldn't have dashed off otherwise."



"Something urgent?" The owner's thoughts whirled in disbelief. "What could possibly overshadow his recent embarrassment?"



Kristina's gaze fell upon the table where ten red roses lay-a vibrant and yet seemingly accusing presence.


Damn Evelina. Had she really tried to charm Jasper Russell with roses? What was the next step?



"Ms. Anderson? What's our plan? What if he returns for us?" The owner's hands trembled once more. He regretted ever agreeing to host this event, knowing now it would spiral into chaos.



Breathing out heavily, Kristina reassured him. "Stay calm. My family won't leave you hanging."



Despite her words of comfort, she was already reaching for her phone. Evelina must have been over the limit tonight, confusing Jasper Russell for a new recruit.



It was urgent she contact her. Immediately.



Fortunately, Evelina wasn't just anyone; she was the Sight Weaver. If anyone could handle Jasper's wrath,it was her.



Kristina attempted a call. "The number you've dialed is currently unavailable..."



The distant response from her phone sent a cold through Kristina.



Without hesitation, she contacted the hotel's front desk. "Has Evelina made it back to my suite?"



Their negative response propelled Kristina out of the club, she redialed Evelina's number persistently as she went. Suddenly, a familiar ringtone sounded fromn the flower bed near the entrance.



She approached quickly, finding Evelina's phone amidst the blooms.



Oh no.
###Chapter 11 Florrie Was Kidnapped




At Morningstar Villas..



Jasper had secured the finest villa locally in advance to ensure Florrie's comfort during her treatment.


The villa boasted her preferred amenities-a small garden, a swing set, and it came staffed with a maid and bodyguards for 24-hour supervision.



"Why weren't you watching her? I instructed you to monitor her closely!How could she possibly disappear?"



Jasper burst into Florrie's room, his gaze fixing on the vacant bed, his expression cold with rage.



He searched the room himself, checking beneath the bed and behind the drapes. This disappearance wasn't a mere game of hide-and-seek; Florrie truly was missing.



Trembling noticeably, one of the female bodyguards stammered, "She retired unusually early, sir. It all seemed so normal then. But upon our check-in... the bed was cunningly made to look occupied with just pillows under the covers. Both Miss Russell and her maid Jenny have vanished."
"Did anyone review the surveillance footage? Have you checked outside?" Panic edged Jasper's voice.


His brother and sister-in-law had entrusted him with Florrie's safety before they departed for Aglonard,stressing its importance.



Jasper had embraced this duty with utmost graveness,always vigilant. Florrie, although resourceful and smart, was still a vulnerable teenager-and sightless.The thought of any harm coming to her was unbearable.



"Sir! Jenny has returned!"


lan rushed into the villa, escorting a distraught woman -Florrie's maid, Jenny.



As soon as Jenny caught sight of Jasper, she fell to her knees, overwhelmed with tears. "M-Mr. Russell...Florrie-she's been abducted!"



Jasper contained the fury building within him, seized her by the arm, and hoisted her to her feet. "Enough tears. Speak. Describe exactly what transpired."



Struggling to regain composure, Jenny managed to recount the events. Florrie, ever the spirited and inquisitive girl, had overheard the villa staff discussing a street fair in northern Aglonard and incessantly pleaded to attend.
Jasper had expressly forbidden it, citing the nighttime dangers. However, as soon as he departed for Dusk Lounge, Florrie convinced Jenny to help her escape from the bedroom balcony.



"She just hoped to explore a little and return unnoticed," Jenny explained, dabbing at her tears."But we encountered some thugs. Captivated by her beauty, they abducted her. I attempted to intervene -they assaulted me and fled. I couldn't catch them...I hurried back here to seek assistance."



Her body bore the marks of the ordeal, with bruises visible and knees bloodied from a fall, yet she did not pause for her wounds. In desperation, she pleaded,"Please, Mr. Russell-we must find her quickly! If we delay, I dread to think what might happen. This is all my fault; I should never have agreed to her request...”



"Stop. We'll address your actions later." Jasper shifted his attention to lan, signaling him with a decisive nod.lan sprang into action, mustering every member of the Russell security team.



With his team in place, Jasper instructed, "Target the street fair."



"Understood,sir!"



The team surged forward, each member poised to scour the city if necessary. After receiving preliminary medical attention, Jenny insisted on joining them. As they prepared, she provided every detail she recalled. "They used the local dialect, likely Aglonard natives... The vendors appeared terrified. It seems these thugs have dominated that area for some time. And one more thing-I heard them mention their leader, calling him 'Mr. Reid.'"



"Reid?" A shadow fell over Jasper's features, his tone turning cold. "lan, compile a list of every individual in this city bearing the surname Reid. I want locations on all of them."


###Chapter 12 She Wants Her Dead



As soon as the sack enveloped her head,Evelina's senses sharpened instantly.



Evelina had faced hardships from a young age, often targeted by bullies in the orphanage due to her slight build. Determined, she immersed herself in combat training,eventually becoming a champion.



Handling a couple of minor thugs was hardly a challenge.



However, a comment they made while seizing her piqued her interest. "Didn't expect her to be hotter than her picture. It's our lucky night, huh?"



It was evident that the attack was planned. Someone had provided her photo to these thugs; someone was plotting her disappearance.



Thus, Evelina ceased her struggles. It was crucial to discover who was bold enough to target her in this small community.



They shoved her into a battered old van and drove off, the ride dragging on for what felt like thirty minutes. From the movements of the van, she could tell they'd left the heart of the city and headed straight for the outskirts.



Her familiarity with the local roads, honed by countless grocery trips in a feeble vehicle while caring for Cary, served her well now. she knew the city's roads like the back of her hand.



Throughout the journey, she meticulously tracked each maneuver and pause at the traffic lights. When the vehicle ceased moving, she had deduced a probable location.



The assailants dragged her from the van and secured her wrists behind her. She adopted a facade of fear,her voice quivering.



"P-please, where have you taken me? What is the reason for this?"



Evelina's gaze swiftly surveyed the area, strategizing her quickest route to freedom.



"Sweetheart, there's no need to fear," said one of the thugs, his lips curling into a smirk as he licked them."We're escorting you to a delightful place-it'll have you shouting for joy."



Grimy hands gripped her shoulders, pushing her forward toward a desolate, crumbling factory.



She pushed her way through the tall, tangled weeds, still keeping up the act."Please, spare me! If ransom is what you desire,my wealthy husband will satisfy any demand."



The thugs only chuckled dismissively. "We're not here for your money. We want you."



Undeterred, Evelina replied, "Consider this-I'm pregnant. A pregnant woman won't command a high price. However, my husband would pay handsomely for my safe return."



This information caused them to hesitate. "Damn,"one muttered. "Mr. Reid didn't mention she was pregnant. What's our next move?"



Evelina seized on the mention of a name. "Mr. Reid? Is he someone significant?"



Believing Evelina's fate was sealed, the thugs dropped their guard. "You've never heard of Mr. Reid?" one mocked. "He's the sole son of the Reid family heir from the west side of Aglonard-a bigwig. He's also tight with Miss Margot Gibson. You upset a person you shouldn'thave, sweetheart. To cross her of all people..."


One of the thugs laughed softly. "Miss Gibson wants you gone permanently. But we? We're not as heartless. We don't like the idea of ending you like that..."



Margot Gibson was behind this? Shock seized Evelina's breath. The revelation was almost too much to grasp.



For the past three years, she had loyally served the Gibson household-as a devoted wife, a compliant daughter-in-law,and a respectful sister-in-law. She had fulfilled every expectation flawlessly.



She had always perceived Margot as merely a sharp-tongued, petty, and spoiled individual. But a desire to see her dead?



Evelina's hands slowly balled into fists. Alright then. If this was the battle to be fought,she was ready.



"We've arrived!" exclaimed another thug. He pushed her towards a decaying doorway, the foul odor assaulting her senses first.



At the rusted metal door stood another man,keychain clinking as he appraised Evelina with a lascivious gaze,his eyes lingering greedily.



"Wow, tonight's catch is exceptional. Each woman is more attractive than the last."



Hold on. Evelina's gaze sharpened. There were more victims?



She had been gearing up to confront them head-on -yet,she hesitated at this new information. The man who had manhandled her kicked the doorman sharply. "Stop staring. This one's pregnant Let Mr. Reid figure out her fate."



The doorman scoffed. "So? Her being pregnant doesn't mean she can't provide some entertainment."He smirked, unlocking the door.



Evelina was pushed through the door with force.



As soon as she entered, a chorus of terrified screams greeted her. The room, dimly lit by a flickering yellow bulb, revealed two young women cowering in the corner, their wrists secured behind them.



Both appeared no older than twenty, and strikingly beautiful.



One girl glanced up at Evelina, her expression vacant and distant-she was blind.



"Enough noise!" the guard shouted from behind them "You'll have plenty of time to scream later."



With a loud clang, he secured the door.



Outside, their laughter was harsh and mocking. "I've picked the most attractive one. That waist, that figure -she's going to be unforgettable. The blind girl is for Pockmark. And you, Big Nose, you get what's left.Hahaha!"
###Chapter 13 Getting Them Out
"Are we going to die?" the blind girl asked, her voice strained with fear. "I'm terrified... I just want to be back home..."



"Please, don't cry. We'll make it through this.Remember, you mentioned your father and uncle are influential. They're bound to rescue us," the other girl said,her own eyes betraying her terror.



Evelina, meanwhile, tilted her ear toward the door,gauging the noise outside. The thugs were still there.



That was all she needed to know. With a deft movement, she loosened her bindings and freed her hands.



She had slyly ensured the ropes were loosely tied when the thugs restrained her.



"Sweetheart,your blindness came later in life, didn't it?"Evelina knelt before the blind girl, gently untying her wrists. "Let's dry those tears now. Crying can strain your eyes."



Unbeknownst to the others, the blind girl was Florrie Russell.
Startled by the unknown voice,Florrie initially recoiled.Yet there was something reassuring about Evelina's tone,which eased her fear quickly



"Who are you?" Florrie murmured. "How did you know I wasn't born blind?"



The other girl gazed at Evelina, her eyes wide with astonishment. "Have they taken you captive too?"



"Indeed." Evelina swiftly reassured, gently stroking Florrie's hair. "Don't worry, I'll lead us to freedom."



"Is it true?" Florrie's voice rose with a spark of hope."Could my uncle have sent you to rescue us?"



"Keep it down," Evelina quickly cautioned, placing her hand gently over Florrie's mouth to silence her.



Understanding the need for quiet, Florie nodded, her lips shaking slightly.


Turning to the second girl, Evelina swiftly untied her."Are you hurt? Can you manage to run?"



Tears were wiped away as both girls nodded in affirmation.



Evelina assessed their surroundings quickly. The windows, too high and narrow, offered no viable escape; the only exit was the door, guarded by three thugs.



They would need a clever plan, not force,to escape



She gathered the girls close, sharing her plan in a hushed tone. "Everyone understand?"



"Understood," they replied softly.


"Great. Now, let's make our move."



Shortly after, all three girls were ready in their assigned spots.



On the floor, Florrie mimicked a seizure, convulsing and frothing effectively. Simultaneously, her companion unleashed a barrage of screams,hammering on the door.



"Help! We need help! She's got foam at her mouth!l think she's dying! Please!"



The commotion disturbed the three thugs outside,who were laughing over their game of dice and drinks.One of them abruptly put his glass down.



"Quiet down in there!" he yelled, delivering a forceful kick to the door.



Paralyzed by fear, the girl who was screaming momentarily lost her script. Without missing a beat, Evelina pleaded, "Please, sir!Consider this-if she expires here, what will you say to Mr.Reid?"



Provoked by her words, the thug, swearing under his breath, unlocked the door and stormed inside.



"What the hell is going-"



Before he could finish, Evelina landed a precise elbow to his neck, knocking him out instantly.



"Move!" Evelna commanded sharply, pulling the blind girl swiftly to her feet. "Grab my hand and hold tight -do exactly as I say!"


Aware of Florrie's vulnerability, Evelina positioned herself protectively.



She pushed a broken chair leg into the second girl's hands. "Stay behind me, and keep close."



Holding Florrie's hand securely and ensuring the second girl followed closely, Evelina surged toward the exit.



"Where do you think you're running off to?" Two more thugs rushed in from the side,brandishing metal pipes menacingly.



The sudden threat immobilized the girls momentarily,  their knees shaking from fright.



"Run!" Evelina fiercely pushed the second girl onward."Don't look back!"



Spotting another broken stool leg nearby, she quickly kicked it upward with perfect aim, striking one attacker squarely in the face.



"Argh!" The man collapsed instantly, unconscious before he hit the ground.



Enraged, the last thug swung his pipe viciously toward Evelina and Florrie.



Though unable to see, Florrie sharply heard the rush of the weapon and instinctively gasped in alarm.



Terror froze her muscles, leaving her helplessly immobilized.



Evelina grabbed the back of her head and pushed her down with a steady hand. "Stay low!"



Florrie ducked at the last second, and the pipe sliced through the air right above her.



Despite repeatedly dodging attacks, Evelina struggled to find an opening to counter, her energy quickly draining.



Anxiety gripped her,tightening her breath. Surprisingly, Florrie's fear transformed into a sudden burst of bravado, and she giggled mockingly. "You can't even hit us, can you? You're hopeless!"



Furious, the thug's face contorted with rage."Bitch-you've asked for it!" With a fierce yell, he raised the pipe high, bringing it down savagely toward Florrie's head.
###Chapter 14 Like A Predator Unleashed
Realizing the imminent threat, Florrie stood frozen,terror silencing any scream.


With a swift motion, Evelina shoved Florrie safely aside and lunged forward, her foot slamming powerfully into the thug's side.



He gasped in agony, doubling over, but Evelina gave him no quarter, spinning gracefully into a devastating kick that cracked against his jaw. The man toppled heavily to the floor,groaning weakly.



Determined to keep him disabled, Evelina followed through with another kick before swiftly pulling the van keys from his pocket.



When Florrie was pushed aside, she collided softly with a worn-out table-exactly as Evelina had intended-just enough to get her clear without injury.


"Still feeling brave?" Evelina asked wryly, offering Florrie a hand up.



Shaking her head desperately, Florrie stammered,promise, no more jokes." They hurriedly retraced their path, escaping from the factory into the night air.


The second girl hadn't ventured far, hidinganxiously behind a nearby bush, and waved frantically as they emerged. "Hey, over here!"



Evelina rushed toward her, concern clear in her eyes."You alright?"



The girl nodded quickly. Relieved, Evelina guided both girls toward the parked van.



Keys in hand, she reached for the door, hopeful of a quick escape- until brilliant headlights suddenly pierced the darkness,stopping them cold.



Covering her eyes, Evelina squinted into the blinding beams,recognizing the grim reality-an entire group of thugs now encircled them.



At the forefront stood a young man with slicked-back hair,arrogance radiating from his designer clothes. He smirked coldly. "Impressive. Nobody's ever escaped my top guys before. There's a first time for everything,I suppose."



"I'm scared," Florrie whispered nervously, picking up the sinister laughter and footsteps around them.



"Me too," the other girl responded, trembling behind  Evelina's protective stance.



"Stay calm," Evelina said firmly, squeezing Florrie's hand reassuringly. Meeting the gang leader's eyes directly, she suggested evenly, "You're Mr. Reid,correct? Whatever Margot's paying you, l'll double it -no,five times as much. Name your price."



Attempting to protect the strangers she'd rescued,Evelina was willing to bargain even with criminals. "Let us leave unharmed, and I'll pretend tonight never happened.Margot won't hear from me again."


Hayden erupted in laughter. "Do you seriously believe we'd let you go after you've seen our faces?"



With a swift, decisive gesture, he instructed, "Finish them."



Immediately, more than twenty thugs surged forward,weapons glinting ominously.


The two terrified girls screamed.



Florrie considered desperately revealing her identity,but the fear of escalating their danger held her tongue.Could disclosing her status as a Russell only seal their fate?



Evelina braced for the brutal fight ahead, calmly stretching her muscles. She turned confidently to the frightened girls. "You both know how to count, don't you?"



Confused, they nodded hesitantly. "Yes...?"


Evelina pointed toward a sturdy tree nearby,instructing the girl with sight, "Get behind that tree with Florrie and start counting."



When the girl hesitated,Evelina shouted sharply, "Now!"



Startled into action, she grabbed Florrie's hand and hurried toward the tree, turning briefly to Evelina."Please be careful!"



Evelina flashed a confident thumbs-up. "Cover your ears. Count to one hundred."



With fearless determination, she then charged straight into the enemy ranks like a predator unleashed.
###Chapter 15 Meeting Again
The two girls huddled together behind a tree,clutching their ears tightly and counting loudly, saying,"One,two, three..." Yet, despite their efforts, the eerie sounds of screams still reached them, sending shivers down their spines.



Tears threatened to spill from Florrie's eyes as she thought of Evelina's danger, but recalling her stern warning, she bit her lip hard to stop them and continued counting, "Fifty... fifty-one..."



From across the dark, Evelina's commanding voice echoed, "Still want to fight?" She was standing amid a scene of defeat, iron bar in hand, directing it towards Hayden Reid. The girls' count was nearing ninety-seven.



Hayden,confronted with his downed crew, stumbled backward,his voice trembling with fear."N-No more,I swear! Please, have mercy!"


With a decisive swing, Evelina knocked Hayden unconscious.



Her actions had been swift and fierce, leaving no room for mercy as she expended every bit of her strength.
As the adrenaline faded, Evelina felt the toll of the fight. Her muscles ached, her breath was short, and she gestured to the girls. "Let's go. Time to get out of here."



Seeing Evelina sway slightly, one girl quickly moved to her side to offer support.



Meanwhile, Florrie stumbled toward Evelina, her expression filled with concern. "Are you okay, Miss?Are you hurt?"



That's when Evelina finally felt the sharp sting of a wound across her back-a blow she hadn't noticed amidst the chaos.



Evelina managed a forced smile through clenched teeth. "I'm fine. Let's move."



She harbored a deep mistrust that Hayden might have called for reinforcements. If they were to encounter another attack, their chances were slim.



The girls flanked her, supporting her as they made their way to an old van parked nearby.



One of the girls, her eyes filled with tears of gratitude,whispered, "Thank you so much for saving us. I'm Eloise Patel. What about you two?"



Now that the immediate danger seemed over, it seemed right to exchange names.


Evelina nodded in acknowledgment. "Evelina Marsh."


Florrie was about to introduce herself excitedly."Oh!



But before Florrie could reveal her name, the sudden sound of roaring engines cut her off. Several black vehicles sped down the road towards them.



"They're back! The bad guys are back!" The terror was evident in both girls' voices as they screamed.


"Get in the van!" instructed Evelina, using the last reserves of her energy to push them inside.


Before they could pull Evelina into the van,dozens of men dressed in black poured out from the vehicles,quickly encircling them.


A cold, sharp knife touched Evelina's throat. She slowly raised her hands in surrender.



"Just leave the girls alone," she said with forced calmness. "I was the one who fought those men. Take me if you need someone."



Her priority remained their safety, even in such dire circumstances.



Inside the van, the girls were crying. "Don't harm her, you monsters!"


"Sir, we've located her!" shouted one of the men dressed in black.



Immediately, the group parted, creating a clear path through the middle.



A man, tall and imposing with a cold handsomeness,walked through the divided crowd. Evelina recognized him at once. "The rising star?" she exclaimed in surprise.



Was this not the trainee Kristina had hired? What was he doing here?



As he approached, Jasper RusselI's jaw clenched, a clear sign of annoyance. This was the woman who had mistaken him for someone less than respectable.



"Ten roses," he said coldly. "It seems we meet again."


A chill coursed through Evelina; the situation was dire.



"Uncle!" Florrie's voice broke through the tension as she recognized Jasper's familiar tone and rushed out of the van.



Jasper quickly moved to embrace his niece. "It's okay,I'm here now."


 
Tears were rolling down her face as she clung to him,  sobbing. "You're so late. There were so many bad people... I thought I was going to die..."



"I'm sorry, Florrie," Jasper responded with uncharacteristic softness, cradling her gently."I should have been here sooner."



"If you had been any later, you might not have found me alive! They were about to kill us-if Evelina hadn't been there..."



Wiping away her tears, Florrie suddenly remembered her manners and turned to introduce her uncle."Evelina, Eloise, this is my uncle. He's here now, so there's nothing to fear."



Yet fear was precisely what Evelina felt.



Standing before her was none other than Jasper Russell, and the girl she had rescued was Florrie Russell, the heiress of the Russell family, who had traveled from lreah to Aglonard for eye treatment.



As Evelina spotted lan approaching swiftly with a medical team in tow, the wickedness of the situation dawned on her.



The realization hit her hard. She had not only mistaken the formidable Jasper Russell for a naive, rookie idol,but she had also flirted with him while intoxicated,armed with a bouquet of roses. Her knees felt weak;she nearly collapsed from the overwhelming  embarrassment.



Just then, Florrie, ever inquisitive, chimed in,"Uncle,have you met Evelina before? You mentioned 'Rising Star' and 'Ten Roses.' Is that some kind of code?"
###Chapter 16 Identity Revealed
"Florrie, please, no more words," Evelina pleaded silently, her heart racing.



Just in time, lan appeared with the doctor, who immediately began checking on Florrie.



Just as Evelina hoped they could move past the awkward moment, Jasper's cool, incisive voice cut through the air. "Indeed, we have met before. Evelina gifted me with ten roses."



"Really?!" Florrie's eyes sparkled with excitement."Evelina, that's incredible! You're the first woman to ever give flowers to my uncle and not end up regrettingit!"



Florrie nudged Evelina playfully.ome on, be honest,do you like him?"



Caught off guard, Evelina hesitated, then spoke the truth. "I'm married."



"Oh no!" Florrie's face fell. "You're married and you flirted with my uncle? That's not cool."



Evelina quickly explained, "I've already signed the divorce papers, and the roses were just-"



Florrie, however, wasn't interested in excuses. At the mention of divorce, her demeanor changed instantly,and she clasped Evelina's arm, her voice bubbling with enthusiasm.



"So, you're free then! My uncle is considered Ireah's most eligible bachelor-many women chase after him,but he likes none of them. Neither do l."



Leaning closer, Florrie whispered, "But I do like you."



Florrie might have been sheltered, but she was perceptive.



Evelina didn't know her or Eloise, not even a hint of their pasts, yet she still put her life on the line for them.Women like her were rare-one in a million.



Florrie had noticed that Jasper appeared genuinely interested in Evelina, which was unusual.



Could she, as his niece, not play a small part in nudging this along?



"You're quite the clever one," Evelina said, giving Florrie's head a gentle pat, looking for a graceful exit from their intense chat.



Outside, the Russell family's bodyguards were efficiently securing the captured thugs, while another squad re-entered the derelict factory to ensure no one escaped.



Evelina marveled at their meticulous work and then turned to Jasper. "What's going to happen to these men?"



Jasper's response was terse. "We'll handle it privately,"he replied, a decision driven by the desire to shield Florrie's public image.



In their world, a family's reputation could be its downfall. Just one scandal could attract a frenzy of media predators, ready to tear apart even a well-guarded heiress like Florrie.



Jasper had kept in mind the tragic tale of the Marsh family in lreah, who were among the city's elite yet not immune to tragedy.



Their lost daughter had been subjected to cruel rumors: sold off, seen in dubious establishments, and worse. The girl's mother, Vivienne Marsh, had wept until she was blind, and the father, Franklin Marsh's once-stellar career had teetered on the brink of ruin.



Evelina agreed with Jasper's plan but set her terms."I accept,but l insist on dealing personally with Hayden Reid and the two thugs who initially attacked me."



For three long years, Evelina had tole rated Margot,fulfilling all duties expected of a sister-in-law. Yet, Margot had wished death upon her.



It was time for Evelina to seek justice.



"I don't think so," Jasper replied, his gaze cold as he looked down at her, a faint smirk playing at his lips."There are still matters you and I need to resolve."


A shiver ran up Evelina's spine.



Was he still holding a grudge over the incident with the roses?



Evelina bowed slightly. "My apologies. I was intoxicated. I mistook you for-"


"Does being drunk excuse flirting indiscriminately?"Jasper interrupted sharply.


"No, it doesn't," she responded, attempting to clarify."It was a misunderstanding-you're quite attractive,and-"



So that was the mix-up.



"Really?" Jasper's tone was cutting. "Do you often approach attractive strangers?"



Evelina massaged her temples, feeling the conversation spiral further out of control. Each response seemed to dig her deeper. Suddenly, the gleam of a blade caught her eye. A knife was being drawn,aimed directly at Florrie.



"Florrie, get down!" Without a second thought,Evelina threw herself in front of the girl, ready to take the blow herself.



However, the expected strike never came.



As Evelina turned, she noticed Jasper intercepting the attack,his arm now bleeding.



Blood streamed down his arm.



It had been Hayden, still intent on harm-he had hurled a knife towards Florrie. Quickly subdued by Jasper's security, Hayden was incapacitated and restrained.



Florrie, sensing the smell of blood, panicked. "Who's bleeding? Evelina, are you okay?!"



"It's not me. It's your uncle." Evelina reassured her as she hurried to Jasper's side to assess his injury. just a shallow cut. It doesn't look deep. No need for stitches, and the blade wasn't poisoned. You're going to be okay."



She swiftly took a first aid kit from the medical team,cleaned the wound with antiseptic, and bandaged it expertly.
"You're a doctor?" Jasper inquired, impressed by her skill. The bleeding had stopped quickly under her careful handling.



"No, I'm not," Evelina responded, choosing not to disclose more about her skills.



At that moment, Kristina's voice broke through the tension. "Mr. Russell, hold on! Don't harm her!"



Misreading the scene, Kristina dashed from her vehicle and positioned herself protectively in front of Evelina.



"Look, I know you're upset, thinking she should be accountable for earlier, but listen to me! You must not harm her. She's the Sight Weaver-the only one who can restore Miss Russell's vision!" Kristina said,her hand raised as if taking an oath.



"| assure you, I'm speaking the truth!" she added fervently.
###Chapter 17 Just Claim Him Already
Evelina gave Kristina a light smack on the shoulder,clearly frustrated. "I was actually kidnapped by Hayden Reid,a thug paid by Margot to kill me."



Kristina's face fell immediately, her earlier indignation vanishing. She awkwardly covered her face with her hand."Oh,so it wasn't Mr. Russell after all?"



Evelina confirmed with a shake of her head. "No, it definitely wasn't him."



Realizing her mistake, Kristina's posture slumped as she stood there, utterly embarrassed.



But really, who could fault her for assuming? Evelina was untouchable in Aglonard, her abilities unparalleled.In Kristina's eyes, only someone like Jasper Russell could manage such a move, especially given the recent events-Evelina had just made a spectacle at the Dusk Lounge and vanished shortly thereafter,while Jasper had left in a noticeable fury..



Everything had led to the belief that Jasper was responsible for Evelina's capture, sparing only Kristina and the owner of the club because he had Evelina to deal with. Kristina had painstakingly reviewed security footage and led her team on a frantic pursuit to this location.



Now,the truth was out- Evelina's identity had been revealed. Jasper, visibly shocked, inquired, "You were the last student mentored by Professor Mitchell?"



The more Jasper pondered, the clearer it became. "It all adds up now. Cary's sight was restored thanks to you,wasn't it?"


Evelina offered no denial. Given the reach of the Russell family, her true identity was bound to surface sooner rather than later.



Jasper,altering his tone, proposed a new beginning."Ms. Marsh, let's put our previous misunderstandings aside. I invite you to treat Florrie under any terms you find agreeable."



His demeanor had softened, a stark contrast to the firm authority he wielded just moments before,underscoring his genuine concern for his niece.



Florrie,barely containing her excitement, chimed in,"Really? Then just stake your claim on my uncle already! He won't resist."



Kristina pinched herself in disbelief. Indeed, there seemed to be an unspoken connection between Evelina and Jasper. Relieved to be recognized by her maiden name,Evelina pondered her next steps.



Yet,she wasn't ready to commit to treating Florrie and sought a plausible delay. "I apologize, Mr. Russell,but I suffered a blow to my back earlier. I need Kristina to assist me in dressing the wound."



Collecting some ointments from her kit, Evelina motioned for Kristina to follow her towards the car.



As they walked away, Kristina mulled over the situation,still trying to piece everything together. "I reviewed the security footage. Only two thugs attacked you.With your capabilities, even inebriated, you should have handled them easily."



"I needed to find out who was behind this," Evelina said tersely.



Kristina's expression showed concern. "You're not one to linger in dangerous situations. Did you learn what you needed quickly?"



"| discovered there were two other girls captured. It seemed right to help them escape since I was already involved," Evelina explained.



As they got into Kristina's car, Evelina removed her jacket and top, exposing a large, dark bruise across her back. Kristina inhaled sharply at the sight. "That looks painful!"



"It's minor. Just fix it up for me," Evelina said,suppressing a grimace



Kristina's hands were less than delicate, causing Evelina to flinch from the discomfort.



Outside,Florrie had overheard their conversation.Her voice shaky, she spoke up. "Uncle, she's injured.She got hurt rescuing me and Eloise. She could have fled,but she chose to rescue us:"



Her plea continued. "Please, don't treat her harshly.Don't force her to treat me. She's kind, and I believe she has good reasons for her decisions. Let's not put more on her shoulders."



Jasper gazed at her and then gave a slow nod."Understood."



Yet, deep inside, he was resolute. He would not relinquish their only opportunity.



He was determined to persuade Evelina to heal Florrie's vision, whatever the cost.

###Chapter 18 Stupid Jerk



On Evelina's request, Jasper ensured Hayden and the two thugs involved in her abduction were turned over to the authorities.



Kristina accompanied Evelina to the police station to file their reports.



By the time they completed their statements, it was after midnight. Exhausted, Evelina fell into a brief sleep,only to be jolted awake by her alarm.



She had a divorce appointment with Cary at the courthouse at 8 a.m.



Always on time, Evelina, despite her aches from the ordeal,took pain medication and made her way to the appointment.



However,Cary had not appeared by 8:30.



After failing to reach him twice by phone, she discovered on the third attempt that his phone was turned off.



Wasn't the late person supposed to bark like a dog?


By 9 a.m., Evelina's patience had worn thin.

She texted him in frustration, saying,"Cary, get your ass to the courthouse.Now!"



Still, there was no reply.


She contacted his assistant to inquire about his whereabouts.



With an unhelpful tone likely influenced by Esme, the assistant responded, "Mr. Gibson isn't in yet. He's probably with Miss Barton; she's not feeling well."



Esme, having been misled by Margot into thinking Hayden's men had succeeded, pretended to be ill to keep Cary at her place.



Her strategy seemed perfect-delay Cary long enough for Evelina to be dealt with, then together they could handle the aftermath.



Unaware of the divorce appointment, Esme played up her symptoms when Cary attempted to leave around 8 a.m., pleading, "Cary, I feel awful. Can you stay just a little longer?"



Esme's act of helplessness was convincing. Cary,ever gullible,found it impossible to walk away.


Thus,he remained by her side throughout the morning.


During one of his brief trips to the bathroom,Evelina's calls appeared on the phone screen. Esme, assuming these were calls from authorities about Evelina's demise, gleefully declined each one.



She then switched off his phone, ensuring no further disruptions.



What was the hurry? Evelina was already gone. They could take their time picking up the body



To Esme,Evelina posed no threat in life and certainly none in death.



Esme's satisfaction was evident; she envisioned a future where Cary was exclusively hers.



Meanwhile, at the courthouse, Evelina vented her frustration into the phone. "If he's not man enough to show up for his own divorce, he'll be hearing from my attorney."



With a sharp click, she ended the call, her face set in a cold grimace.



Her fingers swiftly navigated her phone contacts,selecting a rarely used number.



The response was immediate. "Ah, the illustrious Queen Evelina graces me with a call! What command do you have for your loyal subject today?"



That unmistakably vibrant and cheeky tone could only  belong to Lena Kendall, Evelina's go-to personal assistant.



"I need the top divorce attorney in the nation. Make it happen. I'm through waiting."



Three long years had passed-years marked by unfulfilled commitments and emotional neglect.Evelina was ready to close this ###Chapter of her life.



"Your wish is my command, Your Majesty," Lena responded with a hint of playfulness in her voice.


Lena was efficient; within mere minutes, she had organized the legal representation Evelina requested.



She promptly informed Evelina,saying,"Your attorney will be prepared to proceed no later than the day after tomorrow."



By then, Evelina was already on the way to her hotel,nestled in the back of a taxi.



A hand pressed to her forehead, she felt the warmth of a fever building-a likely result from her recent back injury and the continuous strain.


As she reclined in the taxi seat, Evelina's mind replayed the infuriating events of the previous evening.Frustrated, she pulled up her contacts list and renamed Cary to "Stupid Jerk." Exhausted by the time she arrived at her hotel, her body felt utterly broken. She forced down a couple of pills and collapsed on the bed.


Sometime later, her phone's ring pierced the haze of her rest.



Though her head pounded and her eyes blurred, she recognized the caller ID-Stupid Jerk.



With a disdainful snort, Evelina flung the phone aside,choosing instead to return to her sleep.



But just as sleep was claiming her again, the persistent ring of the doorbell echoed through the room.


Losing any semblance of patience, Evelina hauled herself up, stomped to the door, yanked it open, and yelled,"You stupid jerk, can't you take a hint?!"



However, the figure at her doorstep wasn't Cary-it was Jasper, holding a container of takeout, his expression one of complete surprise.



"...Excuse me?" Jasper's response was utterly flat."Stupid jerk?"

###Chapter 19 Bringing A Woman Home
Florrie's restlessness persisted through the night at the Morningstar villa. No matter how many times she shifted positions in her bed,sleep eluded her.



Throughout the night, Jasper remained by her side,even attempting to sing her lullabies, but to no avail.Florrie's thoughts were fixated on Evelina.



"Uncle," she said, "Why don't you marry Evelina? That way,she can always be with me."



Jasper remained silent.



"Why won't you respond?" Florrie continued. "Are you worried you can't win her heart? But Uncle, you're the most sought-after bachelor in lreah! It would be shameful for our family if you couldn't. Admit it, she's very beautiful, isn't she?"



And it just kept going. It wasn't until well after midnight that Jasper finally got the little chatterbox to drift off.



However, only a few hours later, she was awake again,persistently pleading for Jasper to bring her to Evelina. Ultimately,Jasper couldn't resist her relentless desire.Once Florrie had eaten her breakfast, he gathered several boxes of pastries and, accompanied by lan,set off to visit Evelina.



lan, who had been researching Evelina's background through the night, was increasingly concerned by what he discovered.



"Sir," lan said with a serious tone, presenting the accumulated data. "She's far from ordinary.We might only be seeing the surface of who she really is."



Indeed, the scant information they had was sufficient to prove that Evelina Marsh was none other than the famed Sight Weaver.



Thus,Jasper approached with a genuine willingness to do whatever necessary to persuade her to treat Florrie,whatever it took to regain his niece's vision.



"Sir..." lan paused, his curiosity getting the better of him. "If Ms. Marsh were open to the idea of marrying you...would you consider it?"



Jasper's look in response was cold enough to silence any further inquiries. Ian quickly held his peace.


Arriving at Evelina's hotel suite, they pressed the doorbell and waited. The door eventually opened to reveal- "You stupid jerk! Can't you take a hint?!" Evelina exclaimed, poised to slam the door shut.


lan hastily wedged his foot in the doorway. "Ms. Marsh,please, look at who's here."



Never before had his boss personally delivered pastries to a woman. Surely, she could afford thema moment of grace?



Evelina, plagued by an intense headache,peered at the vague outlines of the two men. "Two of you now?Is my vision doubling?"



Ignoring them, she turned to return to bed, leaving the door open.



But she didn't get far. Just a few steps and she faltered.



"Ms. Marsh!" Jasper exclaimed as he dropped the containers and rushed to catch her. "Evelina? Hey-wake up!"



Her body went slack in his arms, unconscious.



Jasper typically avoided touching those he wasn't familiar with, yet the sight of Evelina's flushed face and the sweat beading on her forehead compelled him to act. 
"Her temperature is soaring..." Upon checking, he found her forehead and palms alarmingly hot, clearly feverish.



"Supposed to be a healer, and can't manage her own health," Jaspoer scoffed quietly to himself. Then,decisively, he lifted her into his arms.



lan was taken aback.



It was a rare sight to see Jasper carry any woman,other than his niece.



"Find a coat. We're taking her to the hospital," Jasper instructed sharply.



lan dashed to the wardrobe. His eyes caught a glimpse of a pill bottle on the nightstand. He paused, reading the label, his features morphing with concern. "Sir,there might've been a mix-up with her medication."



Returning with a coat and the pill bottle, he explained,"It looks like she intended to take something for her fever but mistakenly took something else. That probably worsen her condition."



Jasper's expression darkened. "Contact our family physician immediately. Inform her of the situation,and make sure she's ready to treat Evelina once we arrive at the villa. Send her the medication details as well."
lan paused, his eyes widening. "To the villa? You're taking her there?" He couldn't hide his astonishment.



It was unheard of-the reserved Jasper Russell was actually bringing a woman to his home?
###Chapter 20 You're Welcome To Stay
Evelina's eyes fluttered open to the late morning light filtering through the curtains. She glanced around, her heart pounding,as she saw Kristina, Florrie,and Jasper gathered by her bedside. Overwhelmed, she closed her eyes once more, hoping she was still dreaming.


But Kristina's voice broke through her denial. "Evi,you're giving us a real fright, you know?" she scolded gently.



With resignation, Evelina opened her eyes again."What's going on?" she murmured.



Kristina, clearly frustrated, recounted the events. "I warned you the other night to get that injury checked at the hospital. But no, you insisted it was nothing serious," she scolded.



Softening her tone, she continued, "Then yesterday,you collapse! Thank goodness Jasper was there because of Florrie.Imagine if I had found you a long time after you'd taken the wrong medication... I don't even want to think about what could've happened."



The worry in Kristina's voice was evident, and she seemed close to tears. Attempting to offer some comfort, Evelina reached out to her friend, momentarily forgetting the IV needle in her hand. A sharp pain reminded her,snapping her fully to alertness.



Evelina glanced up at Jasper, a hint of surprise in her voice. "You were the one who brought me here?" she asked, attempting to rise.



Jasper's hand pressed gently against her shoulder,easing her back onto the pillow. "I didn't stop to get your consent," he responded with a calm demeanor."Apologies for the abruptness of it all."



Florrie interjected with a sense of urgency in her voice,"It was really scary yesterday. Luckily, my uncle was there to carry you to safety."



Kristina, ever observant, caught on to the new information. "Hold on-Jasper carried Evi out himself?"she asked, surprised. "I assumed lan was the one who did it."



For Jasper, the act had been nothing more than necessary intervention, hardly something to dwell on.



Yet, noticing Evelina's cheeks tint with a soft blush brought back a vivid memory of her close against him,her warmth mingling with his.



He averted his gaze, his jaw set firm. Meanwhile, Florrie, ever cheerful and unaware of the undercurrents, added brightly, "He sure did! Evi, you saved my life, so it was only right for my uncle to look after you!"



She reached for Evelina's hand, her voice earnest."You're not very good at looking after yourself, are you? Now that you're here,you should stay for a few more days. I mean it, or I'll really start crying."


Kristina added, "Really, Evi, you should stay. I'm leaving town for my granddad's birthday and won't be back for a few days. I'd worry too much if you were alone in your hotel."



Evelina was ready to decline, but at that moment,a servant entered the room. "Mr. Russell, Miss Barton has arrived and is requesting to examine Miss Russell's eyes in detail."



Hearing Esme Barton's name made Evelina reconsider her initial refusal. If Esme was still posing as Landen's final student, Evelina felt compelled to intervene."Okay," she replied reluctantly. "I'll stay."



Florrie couldn't contain her excitement and threw her hands up joyfully. "Yes! You're awesome, Evi!"



As the servant escorted Florrie to meet Esme,Kristina hurried to leave for her flight. This left Evelina in a suddenly quiet room with Jasper.
The silence that followed was heavy, making Evelina's heart race slightly. After what felt like a long time,she finally said, "Thank you... for saving me."


It wasn't often Evelina found herself being rescued-only once before had anyone stepped in on her behalf,when Demi Gibson had intervened to save her childhood home, the Petal Creek Orphanage.


Jasper replied with his usual composure, "You're welcome." As he observed her there, so pale and weary in the large bed, she appeared even more fragile. The bed seemed to swallow her small frame,enhancing her vulnerability.



Reflecting on how this delicate figure had single-handedly fought off attackers just nights ago seemed almost unimaginable.



Florrie was like her-a person who genuinely deserved protection.



Jasper spoke again after a brief pause. "I didn't take you here just to treat Florrie's eyes. Feel free to rest.That's really all there is to it. Florrie enjoys your company; it makes her happy."



Evelina acknowledged his statement but quickly grew solemn. "I'mn open to treating Florrie. However, Esme must make a public apology. She misrepresented herself using my professional reputation and my  mentor's name for fraud."



She often thought about her absence during Landen's final days-a regret that still stung deeply.



Allowing someone to tarnish her mentor's reputation was something she could not stand for.


"Understood," Jasper replied promptly, ready to agree to her terms. "Anything you ask."



He was willing to meet all her demands if it meant securing her help for Florrie's condition.



Before he left the room, Jasper paused at the door and said, "One more thing-Margot has been arrested.And Cary...well,he's aware that you reported her.Now he's scouring the city for you." 
###Chapter 21 Jealousy



Evelina gave a nod, her expression one of relief."That's good to hear. I really need some peace."


Dealing with Cary wasn't on her agenda right now.He had ignored her urgent calls previously, choosing instead to tend to his mistress. And now, he was desperately searching for her?



She decided she would deal with him later, after she had taken enough time to rest and recharge.



Jasper exited the room, a slight smile touching his lips,seemingly in high spirits.


Evelina then settled into a deep sleep for a couple of hours. Upon awakening, she felt revitalized and notably hungry.


She enjoyed a light meal, feeling much better afterward. It was then that she turned her attention to her phone, which had run out of battery. After charging it and powering it on, she was met wvith a flood of notifications-Cary and his mother had called her over a hundred times.


It appeared that the mother and son duo had relentlessly called her phone until it finally gave out.
Choosing not to call anyone back just yet, Evelina noted a slew of text messages that she assumed were filled with nothing positive. She promptly deleted them.



She then noticed a missed call from "Caleb Quinn"among her logs. Curious, she returned the call.


"Hey,Caleb.What's up?" she inquired, keeping her tone light.



The voice on the other line was brimming wvith frustration. "Didn't Lena inform you of my arrival today?"



Evelina was taken aback. "Sorry, what now?"



"I've been at the airport since I landed! Just getting youur call back now? If you don't pick me up soon, I'll report you for emotional distress."


Cringing, Evelina realized she had completely spaced on the divorce lawyer Lena had scheduled to come into town,especially with her recent illness.



"My apologies, I'mon my way."


"You have half an hour!"



Caleb, despite his youth, was one of the youngest to make senior partner at his law firm. However, he could still throw fits that would rival any teenager. Evelina quickly dressed and made her way down the stairs.



Florrie,lounging in the living room, instantly perked up at the sound of Evelina's steps. "Evi, is that you?"


"Yes, it's me, Florrie," Evelina responded warmly. "I have to run out for a little while."



Hearing that, Florrie immediately wanted to join. But she had just undergone all the medical tests, so Jasper didn't allow her to.



Florrie pouted, folding her arms. "Fine, I'll stay. But only if Uncle goes with you. I won't worry then!"


Florrie had assumed the role of Evelina's unofficial protector, which was both endearing and amusing.



"Don't be absurd," Jasper said with a soothing tone."It's not certain that Evelina would want me tagging along."



"That's not an option!" Florrie clung to Evelina,mimicking a koala's embrace. "It's either me or Uncle Jasper who accompanies you,Evi.Make your choice!" Consequently,Evelina found herself in the car with Jasper.



She initially aimed for the front seat but discovered it was already occupied by a bodyguard.


Slightly embarrassed, she closed the door and joined Jasper in the backseat.


While Jasper browsed a financial newspaper, he inquired casually, "Who are we fetching?"


Evelina presumed he was asking for security purposes and openly replied, "It's my brother."



"Actually related by blood?" Jasper's interest was piqued, his brow lifting. Her file didn't indicate she had siblings.


"He and I shared the same orphanage. He was adopted by a family in lreah at twelve and eventually became a lawyer. I've asked him to manage my divorce proceedings."



She left out the part about Caleb being gravely injured in an accident as a teenager, which resulted in blindness.



That was around the time she first met Professor Landen Mitchell during a visit to Caleb. Mitchell,recognizing her potential in medicine, chose to mentor her, making her his last student.



Caleb's initial eye surgery was the first Evelina assisted with. Since that surgery, Caleb had viewed her as his elder sister, showing nothing but absolute loyalty.


Jasper noted the tight bond between Evelina and Caleb, detecting a hint of envy in his own voice as he said, "You two seem... close."


Evelina responded casually, clarifying their connection with a lightness in her tone, "We're not related by blood, but yes, we're closer than many siblings are."


Her voice carried a warmth that spoke of genuine familial love, akin to the way Jasper felt about Florrie,pure and straightforward. He remained silent for the rest of the drive until they reached the airpoort.


Upon arrival, Jasper caught sight of Caleb for the first time. The young man was impressively handsome,exuding a charm that seemed to captivate those around him.



"Evi!" Caleb called out joyfully as soon as he spotted her. Noticing Jasper beside her, his expression shifted slightly.



Without a moment's delay, Caleb approached swiftly,enveloped Evelina in a hug, and lifted her off her feet,spinning her around in a demonstrative greeting.


Jasper's tone carried a hint of caution as he said, "Ms.Marsh has just recovered from being unwell. Perhaps it's best not to be too rough."



"You were sick?" Caleb's concern was immediate as he set Evelina down, his expression filled with worry.He kept one arm around her protectively. "How serious was it? Are you okay now?"


Evelina reassured him with a grateful smile. "I'm much better, thanks to Mr. Russell."



Caleb then turned to Jasper, extending a hand in greeting. "So, this is Jasper Russell from Ireah?"



Jasper confirmed with a firm nod. "Yes, that's me."



Their handshake was more than a simple greeting;it was a silent battle of wills. Despite Jasper's calm exterior, honed by his military background, Caleb's grip was firm, his body tense.



The atmosphere was charged with tension, evident even to the bystanders at the airport.
###Chapter 22 Wherever She Stays,He Stays
After the airport encounter, Caleb made no effort to hide his intentions and squeezed himself into the backseat with Evelina and Jasper.



The ride was awkward, with Evelina feeling like a barrier between two imposing figures


Jasper's gaze toward Caleb was cold and sharp.


Despite maintaining a stoic exterior, Caleb was inwardly cursing. The strength of Jasper's handshake had almost necessitated a trip to the hospital-if he hadn't let go at the last second, Caleb was certain he would have needed a cast.



However, Caleb's resolve remained unshaken. He confidently said, "I'm staying wherever Evi stays. We come as a duo."



Jasper quickly dismissed the notion. "That won't be necessary. Ms. Marsh will be staying at my residence,with my niece. Your presence there would be... less than ideal."



He leaned forward and quietly instructed the driver,"Please take Mr. Quinn to the hotel." The declaration ignited Caleb's temper.



Unwilling to let Evelina stay at Jasper's house without him, he insisted, "Evi, you should come with me to the hotel tonight," while shooting Jasper a challenging look. 3



Caleb wasn't intimidated by Jasper Russell; after all,he worked for Damien Marsh, who was among the few capable of standing up to Jasper in Ireah.



Additionally, Caleb's hidden connection as the long-lost nephew of Vivienne Marsh, Damien's mother,made him Damien's blood cousin.  Jasper's dismissive snort filled the car. "Ms. Marsh has committed to helping my niece. Please, don't complicate things for her."


Caleb retorted, "Oh, your niece? Evelina and I have a decade's history. You just met her, what, last week?"


Turning to Evelina, Caleb employed his most persuasive tone. "Evi, seriously? After I've come all this way? Are you going to leave me alone in some hotel? I'm fragile, remember? Imagine if I fall ill again -you'd feel terrible."



Evelina grimaced as Caleb dialed up his charm to maximum, his voice almost whiny now, leaving her defenseless against his pleas. Her respite came in the form of a phone call from Cary. Answering the call with one hand, she used the other to press Caleb's lips together, silencing his theatrical complaints.



Jasper couldn't help but notice Caleb making a ridiculous face, his lips twitching with amusement.


Cary's voice burst through the phone line, full of outrage. "Evelina! Why are you only picking up now?Did you know Margot's been arrested?"



The intensity of his words was clear even without speakerphone, and both men beside her caught every detail.



"You know Margot orchestrated a kidnapping against me,right? She wanted me dead. And you're wondering why she's arrested?" Evelina's response was cold.



Cary retorted, "You're making that up! Margot wouldn't hurt anyone! You must be trying to trap her to squeeze something out of me."



His accusations were swift and harsh. "My mom always said you were no good. You're just proving her point!"



Evelina retorted sharply,"Oh, I'm the one avoiding divorce? We were supposed to finalize everything yesterday morning. Who didn't show?" Cary faltered briefly. "Esme was ill, I couldn't just leave her."



Evelina scoffed, "That's rich, considering | was attacked with a steel pipe and ended up in the hospital. Let's revisit this conversation about your saintly sister after I'm out of the hospital, shall we?"



Evelina quickly ended the call and switched off her phone,cutting off any furtherdiscussion.



Caleb was seething. "How can he be so entitled?Holding his sister longer might make him see sense."



"Right," Evelina replied, unfazed. "He needs a little more time to understand the situation."



Grrrrr-



At that moment, a growl interrupted their conversation-not from Caleb, but his stomach.



He suggested they head to his hotel for a meal, but Jasper wanted Evelina back at the villa for dinner with Florrie.



As the men nearly started arguing, Evelina intervened and chose a local eatery known for its specialties.



Evelina and Caleb entered the restaurant first to get a table, while Jasper remained outside, consoling an  angry Florrie over the phone.



Fuming, Florrie couldn't believe they had left to dine without her.



Upon approaching the host stand, they were met with a cold reception. "I apologize,but we are fully booked for the evening," the receptionist said, maintaining a forced smile.



Evelina,undeterred, inquired, "Isn't there a VIP lounge available for platinum members?"



Before Evelina could show her membership card, a familiar voice came from behind.



"Evelina Marsh, trying to dine without a reservation?That's a bit embarrassing," Esme said,her voice laced with sarcasm. "But don't worry, you can join us if you'd like."



Her smirk widened as she continued, "Cary secured the best private suite for us tonight-the Gold Suite.Perhaps it's new to you? Just so you know, it has a starting minimum of a hundred thousand."

###Chapter 23 Public Humiliation
Evelina raised an eyebrow, unable to suppress a smirk."Really? I had no idea."



Unbeknownst to Esme,Evelina habitually reserved the more expensive Platinum Suite, which explained her ignorance of the Gold Suite's relatively modest price.



Esme,unaware of Evelina's usual preferences,flashed a victorious grin. "It's understandable that you wouldn't know. Such places aren't common knowledge among housewives. But don't worry, you'll catch on to the finer things in life."



Evelina couldn't help but find the situation comically absurd.



Caleb,meanwhile,bristled visibly, his temper on the verge of erupting.



At that moment, the previously dismissive receptionist transformed, her demeanor becoming obsequiously sweet as she addressed Esme. "A guest for the Gold Suite? That's exceedingly rare. We hardly ever have those occupied."



With a deferential bow, she continued, "You must be Mrs. Gibson, right? Mr. Gibson is a fortunate man-having a wife who is both beautiful and sophisticated."She ushered Esme forward.



Esme, soaking in the flattery, shot Evelina a triumphant glance that seemed to say, "Clearly, I'm the rightful Mrs. Gibson."


Holding her head high, she replied, "Cary really wanted to reserve the Platinum Suite, but unfortunately, it's off-limits to the general public."



The receptionist nodded eagerly in agreement."Exactly, the Platinum Suite is reserved exclusively for our major shareholders."



She added, "In my three months here, I've only seen it opened for one of Aglonard's top magnates, a person of immense wealth and influence."



Esme paused in her tracks, then swiveled back towards Evelina, her tone thick with feigned kindness."Don't be shy, Miss Marsh. Join us for dinner.Cary and I would love your company."



Evelina responded with a measured smile. "|appreciate the offer, but I'll decline."



Caught off guard, Esme's face contorted slightly."I was just being polite..."



The receptionist interjected sharply, "Don't insult our  guests. With that attitude, you're hardly fitting for our establishment. You're lowering our standards."



She signaled to security. "Please escort these troublemakers out."



Caleb moved protectively in front of Evelina, his gaze steely. "I suggest you fetch your manager.Immediately." 3



The security team paused, uncertain.



Meanwhile, the receptionist insisted, "And who might you be to demand-"



"Stop," a commanding voice interrupted. The manager approached, his expression grave. "Move away," he instructed his employee.



Evelina deftly retrieved her sleek Platinum membership card from her purse and presented it."We'll be dining in the Platinum Suite."



"Of course, one moment please." The manager respectfully accepted the card and hurried off to confirm its validity.



Muttering quietly, the receptionist scoffed, "That's definitely a counterfeit. She doesn't look like someone who could own a Platinum Card."



Esme adopted a concerned expression. "Ms. Marsh, this is Aglonard's top dining venue. It's fine if it's out of your budget, but trying to pass off a fake card is quite inappropriate."



As more crowd turned their attention towards the scene,Esme amplified her voice for the benefit of the restaurant manager. "I apologize for any confusion caused. I'm certain Ms. Marsh had no intention of causing a scene-"



The manager returned, his face stricken with embarrassment, but not towards Evelina.



With utmost respect, he bowed slightly to Evelina."Ms. Marsh,please accept my apologies.Your Platinum Suite is prepared. Allow me to escort you and your guest personally."



Esme's facade crumbled visibly, as if she had been struck.



Incredulity marked her features. How could Evelina,merely a housewife, an orphan, possess a Platinum Card?



Caleb chuckled softly. "Looks like you've never actually seen a Platinum Card, Ms. Barton. No hard feelings though; you'll grow accustomed to finer settings in time." His words mirrored her own earlier condescension.



Esme's jaw was clenched so tightly that it seemed her   teeth might shatter. Her smile faltered.



Evelina casually flicked the card between her fingers and said sweetly, "I'm afraid you and Cary won't be joining us tonight. My friend might be tough, but even he can't digest a meal with a cheater and his mistress."



As Esme's forced smile finally fell away, her eyes began to brim with tears."Cary and I love each other     _1	1



Evelina interrupted her sharply, "Then you should probably urge him to finalize our divorce. You're not doing any favors to your so-called 'virtue' by hanging onto a still-married man. Whatever good name you thought you had, you're shredding it."



Whispers swept through the onlookers. "She's the mistress? Unbelievable.How shameful."



"You're despicable!" Esme burst into tears, covering her face as she rushed out, presumably to complain to Cary.



Evelina watched her go without a flicker of sympathy.



The receptionist turned pale and approached hurriedly,stammering, "Ms. Marsh-I-I had no idea you were Mrs.Gibson.Please forgive my error. I didn't intend-"



"Perhaps it's best you find a different role," Evelina responded coldly, directing her gaze to the manager. "If she's incapable of proper guest recognition,why is she even employed here? The person who recommended her should reconsider their position as well." 1



"Absolutely, Ms. Marsh," the manager replied,nodding earnestly. His career was too important to jeopardize over a misjudgment.
###Chapter 24 Is This Because Of Ms. Marsh
Caleb has always been too talkative around Evelina.



They had just left the main dining area when he couldn't hold back a chuckle. "Evi, I was about to burst out laughing back there. Does that old schemer even know you've got ownership here?"



He was usually the epitome of chivalry, referring to every older woman as a "lovely lady." That courtesy didn't extend to Esme Barton, though, who he deliberately described with an added "old" to emphasize his disdain.



Evelina simply nodded, aware of the many things Esme didn't know about her.



Once they arrived at the Platinum Suite, Caleb lingered by the door while Evelina walked in.He then whispered something to the restaurant manager.



The manager appeared uncomfortable. "I'm not sure that's possible,sir..."



Caleb gave his shoulder a reassuring pat. "Just do as l say,and I'll handle the fallout." As the manager reluctantly departed, Caleb entered the suite, a mischievous grin on his face, and moved to lock the door.



He was trying to prevent Jasper from entering.



Evelina noticed. "Caleb?"



He coughed awkwardly and abandoned his scheme,opting to sit next to her instead.



She tousled his hair affectionately, a gesture from their childhood. "Don't you think you're too old to be playing these tricks?"



Caleb couldn't help but smile broadly. "No matter how old I get, I'll still be your little brother, Evi." ①



He harbored a wish to stay by Evelina's side forever,fearing the day someone might pull her away.



Evelina responded with a tone of endearment yet assertion, "Yes, you're my brother. The only one I'll ever have."



That response silenced him effectively. "Exactly what I needed to hear."



Rising from her seat, Evelina said, "I'm off to the restroom. Go ahead and order something light for us,will you?"
No sooner had Evelina left for the bathroom than Caleb pulled out his phone and dialed his cousin. "Hey,Damien, quick thing-what's Jasper Russell's least favorite dish?"



Recently reconnected with his aunt Vivienne Marsh-Damien's mother-Caleb enjoyed the affection of the Marsh famnily, being the sole heir to Vivienne's maternal lineage.



Damien sounded puzzled by the inquiry. "Jasper? He avoids spicy foods mostly.Why,you're dining with him?"



Then his tone turned sharp. "Listen, we Marshes aren't the type to back down-but even I wouldn't risk crossing Jasper Russell. That man's a storm waiting to happen."



If it were just his father they upset, maybe there would still be a way out. But messing with Jasper? That was a one-way road to nowhere.



The Marsh and Russell families had long been at odds,though they maintained a show of civility in public. A direct clash between them wasn't considered worth the potential damage.



"Understood, thanks, Damien," Caleb responded cheerily, ending the call. He then proceeded to fill their table with the spiciest food the menu offered.
Back in the car, Jasper had just finished a phone conversation with Florrie when lan called.



"Sir,concerning Caleb Quinn," lan said with caution."He presents a bit of a challenge. He's actually the long-lost nephew of Vivienne Marsh-yes,that Mrs.Marsh. For years, the Marsh family has been searching for their missing daughter, and Caleb is the only clue they have."



Years ago, during a hospital visit, Vivienne and her sister-in-law each had a child with them. A fire erupted,ensuing chaos, and both children disappeared.



After many years, the Marsh family finally located Caleb and are now deploying all their resources to find the girl.



lan added, "The family is extremely protective of him.They treat him like he's fragile."



This explained Caleb's bold demeanor; he had powerful support behind him.



Jasper responded coldly, "Then work out how to return him to the Marsh family."



While Jasper had no intention of causing Caleb harm,he preferred to keep him away from Evelina.



lan paused,uncertain. "Uh, sir... does this have to do with Ms. Marsh?"


Y
"Three days," Jasper said bluntly. "He goes back, or you're the one taking a flight."



With that, he disconnected the call.



lan released a long, despairing groan.
###Chapter 25 His Little Schemes
Esme didn't immediately seek out Cary after making her dramatic exit. Instead, she retreated to a restroom on the building's first floor.



Inside, she hadn't shed any actual tears. Now, she was carefully applying water to her cheeks to mimic tear tracks and irritating her eyes to achieve the right shade of red, crafting a believable look of distress.Once satisfied with her appearance, she entered the Gold Suite.



Cary was already there, greeting her warmly. "Esme,you're here! We've been keeping the food warm for you," he said as she walked in.



That morning, Esme had visited the Morningstar villa to conduct a supposed evaluation of Florrie's eyesight.Cary had quickly spread the word, which had the Aglonard elite humming with the news.



Esme was now seen as a key ally to the Russell family's young heiress.



This had led to an influx of favors and offers from the city's elite, all eager to earn Esme's favor. One of them even proposed leveraging political connections to secure the release of her prospective sister-in-law from incarceration.



Cary,clearly enchanted by Esme's newfound influence,couldn't hide his admiration.



"You shouldn't have waited," Esme said gracefully,settling into her seat beside him. "I wouldn't want to be a bother."



Quick to please, a guest noticed her reddened eyes."Miss Barton, are you alright? Your eyes... you seem upset."



Esme brushed off the concern with a shaky voice. "Oh no,it's nothing at all."



Cary,concerned, took her hand and looked at her intently. "What's wrong, Esme? Did someone upset you today?"



She hesitated, portraying reluctance. "It's really nothing... Not worth mentioning at all."



At that moment, a waiter entered with a fresh plate.The sight of Esme made her exclaim,"Oh my,you're the woman who was mistreated in the lobby earlier,aren't you?"



Esme quickly bowed her head and covered her face with her hands. "You must be confusing me with someone else."
Cary,however,pressed for details. He fixed the waiter with an intense gaze. "Explain what you saw."


The waiter, who had discreetly received a tip from Esme earlier, began a detailed account. She painted a picture where Evelina was the aggressor, publicly shaming a defenseless Esme.


Cary's hand hit the table hard. "Her again? Isn't it enough that she's destroyed my sister's reputation?Now Esme too?"


Esme remained silent, dabbing at her eyes delicately,her lack of response speaking volumes.


Cary's anger surged at the sight of her apparent vulnerability.


"I need to find her, now. Where is she?"


Esme, her voice barely above a whisper, responded,"Forget it, Cary. She's beyond us now, enjoying in the Platinum Suite with some companion."


Her words, gentle yet fraught with insinuation, left a lasting impact.



The murmurs around the table grew. One guest whispered, "Probably some old rich guy, going bald."


Esme's lips curved into a smug grin as the rumors multiplied.


Back in the Platinum Suite-


Caleb was enthusiastically tackling a heap of the restaurant's spiciest offerings. "These are the specialties of the house," he said, glaring playfully at Jasper while stuffing his face. "Evi actually helped craft some of these recipes with the chef. You've got to try them, Jasper. It would be a shame to ignore Evi's hard work."


Spicy food was Jasper's rival.


More than a mere dislike, it was an allergy-chilies could set his entire body aflame with discomfort.


Caleb's encouragement and Evelina's presence pushed Jasper, his jaw tightening as he reluctantly tried the food.


Evelina's patience snapped as she looked at Caleb critically. "Caleb, really? Light dishes, remember?Jasper is dealing with an arm injury, and my back isn't great either. We shouldn't be eating spicy food."


At the mention of her injury, Caleb's playful tone vanished. "Your back is hurt? Show me where."


"Stay seated!" Evelina firmly pushed him down."Please remove these and bring us some less spicy dishes." Turning to Jasper, she quickly fetched a glass of water. "Here, drink this. It might ease the burn."



As their fingers touched briefly over the glass, a subtle electric sensation sparked between them. Evelina quickly withdrew her hand as if burned.


Jasper, clearly shaken, rapidly downed his water and began to cough violently.


Seeing this, Caleb was on the verge of making a cutting remark but hesitated when Evelina extended her hand to comfort Jasper, gently patting his back.



"Take it easy," she murmured soothingly.



Witnessing this tenderness, a wave of jealousy washed over Caleb. He suddenly started to cough excessively himself. "Evi! Something's wrong... check on me too!"


Evelina shot him a skeptical look. "Caleb, you know I'm a doctor, right? Pretending doesn't work with me."


At that moment, Cary stormed into the room.



In his wake, Jasper's guards hurried in after him."We're sorry, sir. He got past us-"
###Chapter 26 Way Better Than Him
Cary burst into the room, his eyes seething with anger.He found Evelina casually enjoying the company of two notably attractive men.



Next to her was the same handsome man from the Dusk Lounge event, who had previously received ten roses from Evelina under Cary's watchful eye.



His attempts to intervene had clearly failed, as evidenced by their current friendship.



"Evelina, really?" Cary seethed. "We're still married,and here you are, charming other men?"


Jasper,still recovering from his coughing fit,scowled,preparing to have his security remove Cary.


Caleb,however,addressed him first.



"Look who it is. The cheating husband and his mistress,"Caleb said with biting sarcasm.



Towering over Cary at six feet one inch, Caleb peered disdainfully at him and Esme who had followed.



"Who are you?" Cary asked "I'm a lawyer," Caleb replied with cold precision. "I deal with shameless people daily, but you, sir,are exceptional. Cheating on your wife, flaunting your affair before your divorce is finalized, and having the audacity to accuse her in public?"


"Shut up!" Cary shouted, losing his comnposure and throwing a punch.



Caleb easily dodged, making Cary's attempt look foolish.





Cary wasn't actually aiming to hit Caleb; it was a diversion to reach. Evelina. He jabbed a finger accusingly at her, his voice dripping with contempt."You claimed you were sick, confined to bed rest.What is this charade? Cozying up with your new lover?You deceitful slut!"



Was he referring to Jasper as her boy toy?



The bodyguards of the Russell family tensed instantly.History had it that the last individual who dared yell at Jasper Russell vanished without a trace.



A chilling calm settled over Jasper's features, his anger nearing its peak. Before he could erupt, Evelina stepped closer, touching his shoulder subtly, her gesture surprisingly tender.


For anyone else, such familiarity would have warranted  immediate ejection.



Yet,for Evelina, Jasper remained unbothered, almost appreciative of her touch.



Evelina met Cary's fury with cold disdain. "The manI'm with now surpasses you in every conceivable way-more attractive, wealthier, and vastly/ superior in bed."


Her words struck Cary like physical blows.


Cary lost it. "That's a lie!"


Esme, catching every word, teared up. "Cary... have you really been with her?"



Cary's denial was swift and desperate. "No! I swear,I haven't laid a finger on her since our marriage!"



Evelina's smirk deepened. "Caught onto my deception,have you? So what grounds do you have for your accusations?"



She slapped his pointing hand aside with force.


The sound of the slap filled the room, and Cary shouted, nursing his hand in agony.



"Good heavens, Cary!" Esme hurried to his side,her concern veiled with an opportunity to criticize Evelina."That's uncalled for! Hitting someone like that -I'm calling the cops!" Evelina looked at her coolly. "Sure, go ahead. That should help them investigate who got Margot to hire those kidnappers."



Esme stopped, her phone halfway to her ear. "What..Are you suggesting I was involved?"


Evelina had entertained the thought. Margot had the malice but not the brains for such a plot-unless she was coached.



The subtle change in Esme's expression was telling.



"Strange, isn't it? Three years my marriage went smoothly. Then you come along, and suddenly I'm facing thugs? Quite the coincidence." Evelina's tone was frosty, slicing through the mounting tension.


"Don't forget-I challenged you openly. I dared you to heal Florrie's eyesight or admit to being a sham. You had a motive to get rid of me."



Cary's expression contorted with uncertainty, as he hadn't thought of this angle before.



He recalled the secretive conversation Esme had with Margot that evening. Could it be that she had manipulated her?



Esme erupted, unable to hide her panic. "She's fabricating everything!Evelina,where's your evidence?" Evelina responded calmly, "Direct proof? I lack it.However, Margot knows who planted the scheme in her head. If she confesses, I'll retract my accusation.She could go free."



Now Cary faced a dilemma. Should he support his sister or stand by his girlfriend? Evelina's statement had forced him to choose.
###Chapter 27 Level The Familiarity
Esme's composure shattered, revealing a brief surge of panic before she replied, "You're just envious!Envious because Cary loves me instead of you! You're driving a wedge between us!"



Quickly adopting the role of a sacrificial hero, she added with a sniffle, "Alright! I'll leave. If my departure will save her, then that's what I'll do."



Cary's lingering doubts evaporated as he watched Esme's performance, his heart swelling with empathy.


"You shouldn't blame yourself, Esme." He reassured her softly,stepping in to protect her. "You won't face this alone."



Within,Esme gloated over her successful manipulation.Even if Evelina harbored suspicions about her role in inciting Margot, it mattered little. Cary's devotion was clear.



Yet,she feigned concern,murmuring softly, "But what will become of Margot? Evelina seems unyielding..."


Cary,fueled by a mix of concern and indignation,confronted Evelina sharply, saying, "Don't you care about how this will affect my grandmother if you continue accusing Margot?"



Evelina remained stoic, she retorted, "If your grandmother knew the truth of Margot's actions,she'd personally escort her to the police. She's no fool-unlike someone here, being manipulated by his mistress."



Fury washed over Cary, his features tightening."What's your angle here? What are you after? Let's talk-everything but marriage is on the table."



Evelina retorted sharply, "Oh, really? I'll take everything you own. Are you prepared to hand that over?"



Cary's temper flared again. "You're pushing your luck,Evelina. I'm trying to remain civil."



With a cold smile, Evelina set her terms. "Tomorrow,8 a.m., the courthouse. Be there or Margot ends up behind bars."



She fixed her gaze directly on Cary. "And don't think of asking Mr. Russell for favors. I was present during each of your eye surgeries. I know who the real Sight Weaver is-and it's definitely not Esme."



Esme replied, desperation in her voice, "You're lying!You're just a housewife, what do you know about any of this?"
But Caleb had already called the restaurant manager.Moments later, Cary and Esme were being escorted out.



Once they had gone, the room fell quiet again. New dishes were served one after the other.



Jasper offered Evelina some of the freshly served food, his voice soft but firm. "You extended them mercy, and they responded with contempt."


Evelina exhaled deeply. "Margot remains Demi's granddaughter,after all..."



She had never truly intended to imprison Margot; her threat was more of a desperate attempt to instill fear.


Yet, she resolved, if the Gibson family targeted her once more, her patience would reach its end.



"Jasper, thought you were the type to strike fear in everyone's heart," Caleb said, a hint of annoyance in his tone. "Shouldn't those jerks have been trembling at your presence? Next time, I'm bringing the bodyguards my cousin insisted on. It would've spared us their irritating presence."



With a composed demeanor, Jasper responded,"Evelina sets her own plays. She signals when she wants my intervention."
Evelina was silently impressed by Jasper's show of respect for her independence, a stark contrast to the notorious reputation that preceded him. Here was a man who understood limits and honored her space.


Caleb, never one to let a moment of banter slip by,asked, "Getting familiar, are we? 'Evelina' now-has she granted you that privilege?"



Jasper met his gaze steadily. "You've been calling me Jasper. Thought I'd level the familiarity."


Interrupting Caleb's comeback, Evelina swiftly stuffed a chicken wing into his mouth. "Focus on your meal."


She then casually turned to Jasper. "Join in, Jasper."


It was evident Jasper didn't make exceptions often.Evelina wasn't about to let this unexpected openness fade.
###Chapter 28 Dedicate My Life To His Care

Caleb was stubborn about not heading to a hotel after their dinner. Despite Evelina's logical arguments,he stood his ground.


Losing his patience, Jasper commanded, and two bodyguards immediately escorted a protesting Caleb to the car,mimicking a young child being taken to school."Evi, save me!" Caleb dramatized his plea.


Evelina,amused by his performance, complimented Jasper. "Seems you've got a way with handling him.It's about time someone put him in his place."


Acknowledging her with a subtle smile, Jasper gallantly held the car door open for her, and they both made their way back to Morningstar Villa.


Arriving late, they found Florrie had fallen asleep waiting for them. After ensuring she was comfortably asleep,they went to their respective rooms.



The next morning, at precisely 7:30,while Evelina was finishing her breakfast, a distressed housemaid burst in."Ms. Marsh-urgent! Mr. Russell is very sick! Please,come quickly!" she exclaimed, pulling Evelina towards Jasper's room. What's the matter with him?" Evelina inquired as they hastened, but the maid could provide no specifics.



Florrie was already outside Jasper's bedroom when she heard someone approaching.


She quickly cried out, "Evi, come quick! Uncle's in a bad way. His stomach's pretty delicate, and it looks like he had something off last night. He got a fever after midnight, hasn't said much since, and it looks serious. His fever is high, but he can't take most medicines because he's allergic. We've tried non-medical ways to cool him down, but they're not doing the trick..."



"Relax, Florrie. I'm on it." Evelina assured her and proceeded to speak with the family doctor.



"His condition is probably due to his dietary restrictions," explained the doctor. "Spicy or heavily seasoned foods don't agree with Mr. Russell."



A realization dawned on Evelina, her spirits dampening.The spicy meal Caleb playfully ordered the previous evening was to blame. She knew Jasper wasn't fond of spicy food, but she hadn't understood the severity of his allergy.



After assessing Jasper herself and consulting with the doctor, Evelina understood the gravity of his fever. The doctor hurriedly enumerated all the treatments and cooling methods she had applied, concerned that she might have overlooked something critical.



Evelina responded, "You've implemented a solid strategy, which I would have chosen myself under these circumstances."



Relief washed over the doctor as she released a heavy sigh.



Evelina continued with a thoughtful look, focusing on Jasper's feverish form. "However, we may need to consider a more radical approach given the severity of his condition."



She suggested her plan with a steady voice.


After hearing the details, the doctor quickly dismissed the idea. "Ms. Marsh, ths method is unknown to me. It carries too much risk. Should something go wrong with Mr. Russell..."



Florrie, unsettled by the doctor's resolute stance,asked her friend, "Evi, are you certain this is the right path?"


Evelina had her doubts. She wasn't completely sure.Yet, she was aware that without intervention, his condition could cause lasting harm. Drawing in a deep breath, she said, "Should any harm come to him, I wvill accept all responsibility. Moreover if he suffers permanent damage, I will dedicate my life to his care."



She turned to an assistant nearby and instructed,"Fetch me ice and the strongest alcohol available."



Convinced by the urgency, Florrie agreed. "I believe in Evi. Let's do what we can."



Approaching the bedside, Evelina started to undo Jasper's shirt buttons. "Begin by taking off his shirt and pants."



Stunned, Florrie said, "Wait... everything?"


As Evelina unfastened the third button, the silky fabric of the pajama top fell open, revealing Jasper's well-defined collarbone and the sculpted contours of his chest.



A slight tremor touched Evelina's hands as she remembered Kristina's remarks about Jasper's dangerous allure.



Regaining her composure, she called two male bodyguards. "Ensure his arms and hands are wiped with ice. Then, dab alcohol on his chest, back, and limbs.Continue every hour until his fever subsides."
The bodyguards' rough handling caused Jasper,who was semi-conscious, to moan in discomfort.



Ultimately, Evelina decided to take over the task herself.
###Chapter 29 Marry Her Or Something
Three hours had passed when Jasper's fever finally subsided.



Florrie breathed a deep sigh of relief and grasped Evelina's hand tightly, her voice filled with heartfelt gratitude. "Evi, I don't know what we would have done without you! Uncle Jasper was really in a bad way!"



The family doctor, realizing her initial skepticism was misplaced,approached Evelina with a humble apology "Ms. Marsh, I apologize for doubting your methods..."


Evelina, recognizing the stress the doctor faced,dismissed the apology with a forgiving gesture. "It's all right, no worries," she responded warmly.


Impressed by Evelina's gracious demeanor and medical expertise, the doctor couldn't help but admire her.



Soon after, Jasper stirred awake.


Instantly, Florrie was at his side,her emotions a mix of joy and complaint. "Uncle, you almost gave me a heart attack! We're so lucky Evi was here! Imagine if something worse had happened-what would wve do without you?"



As Jasper regained his bearings, his eyes caught Evelina standing by the window, the morning light casting a halo around her. Time seemed to pause for a moment.



"Jasper, here, you need to drink this," Evelina said,pulling him back from his daze as she held the cup to his lips.



Florrie was bubbling with excitement next to him."Evi made this special herbal concoction for you! It's a blend of several remedies; she calls it 'miracle tea.'If those allergies ever flare up again, this tea's your quick fix."



Evelina had anticipated future allergic reactions and came up with a plan. "I've passed the recipe to your physician. She'll prepare it daily and it'll be ready in a thermos for you to carry around."


Florrie sulked a little. "It's not fair, Evi's keeping it all for you, Uncle. She won't even let me try it."


Jasper quickly finished his drink, the mild bitterness offset by its soothing effect. As the warmth spread through his body,he felt genuinely relieved.


He turned to Evelina with a look of deep appreciation "You concoct the medicinal brews? That's quite impressive. Thank you,really." Her smile was radiant in response. "It's my pleasure."



With Jasper seeming cheerful, Evelina decided to broach another topic. "I have a favor to ask. I know Caleb can be overwhelming, but he means well.Please don't hold his antics against him."



The warmth in Jasper's expression faltered. Had she been doing all this just to plead Caleb's case?


Even so, the word no just wouldn't come out.



"I won't," he said finally. But the way his fingers clenched around his cup said plenty about how he felt.


Evelina's relief was evident. "Thank you, Jasper," she said,her tension easing visibly.


Evelina had not been aware that Caleb's newly discovered aunt was actually the matriarch of the influential Marsh family, a clan that held sway nearly equal to the Russells.



Florrie, bubbling with a sudden idea, leaned closer to Jasper and murmured, "Uncle, Evi just saved your life,risking her own. Don't you think... maybe you should marry her?"



She then slyly addressed Evelina, giggling softly."Evelina, you did see him in his most vulnerable state today. Thnat makes you responsible for him, right? If you don't look after him now, I'lI hold it against you forever."



Evelina, however, was lost in thought, a distant look in her eyes. "There's something... I'm sure I'm forgetting something crucial."


Florrie pondered momentarily before her face lit up."Oh, is it time for lunch? That must be it!"



Acknowledging the importance of a meal,Evelina agreed absentmindedly.



Yet, as she entered the dining room and caught sight of her phone on the table, the forgotten urgency hit her all at once. She had missed her crucial 8 a.m.appointment at the courthouse to finalize her divorce with Cary.
###Chapter 30 The Barton Siblings Make Their Move
Cary had left home early-before 7:30-to steer clear of the congested streets. Waking up at this hour wasn't routine for him, and the exhaustion clung to him like a fog. By the time he made it to the courthouse,the clock read 7:50.



Esme had accompanied him, offering quiet reassurances as they lingered.


But as the minutes stretched into hours, and 9 a.m.came and went, Evelina was still nowhere to be seen.



Irritated, Cary dialed her number repeatedly. His fingers burned against the heated surface of his phone,but she never answered.



"Maybe something urgent came up," Esme murmured,feigning sympathy while stirring his frustration. "|doubt she did this on purpose-"



"Urgent? What could possibly be so pressing? She stays home all day!" Cary snapped, hurling his phone onto the pavement. "She's stalling. She never wanted this divorce in the first place."



Esme flinched at his outburst, instinctively stepping back. But when he didn't acknowledge her reaction-let alone soothe her-she swallowed her irritation and resumed her placating role.


"Don't get worked up, Cary. Maybe... maybe this is just her true nature. You saw her last night-two men,a private VIP lounge? Looks like she's already scouting for her next option."



More fuel on the fire. Then came the real suggestion."Why not let a lawyer take care of this? Cut out the headache entirely."



She'd overheard from Cary's mother that Evelina had already secured a hefty sum and an apartment in the settlement. But Esme knew that land was in a redevelopment zone-just the sale could rake in a fortune.



Altogether? Nearly eight million. There was no way she'd let Evelina walk away with it.



"Legal route might be smoother," Cary muttered, jaw tight. "But what about Margot? The only reason l agreed to this was to get her out."



"Leave that to me," Esme assured him, slipping her arm through his. "My brother's back in town. He has all the right connections. With his help, there's no way we won't get Margot released."



By the time Evelina finally returned his call, Esme was already at the airport, welcoming her older brother,Sebastian Barton.



Finding Cary's phone switched off, Evelina assumed he was with Esme and rang her instead.



Yes, she'd missed their 8 a.m. meeting-for valid reasons-but it was still on her. She had been prepared to apologize.



Esme didn't give her the opportunity.



On the third attempt, she finally picked up, venom laced in her voice. "You've got some nerve calling me!Do you think your pathetic little tricks will stop this divorce? Wake up, Evelina. He's disgusted with you.He wants nothing to do with you. If you have any sense,you'll back off from Margot's case too. Demi's condition has worsened-because of you. Do you really want to be the reason she ends up in a hospital bed?"



Evelina dismissed Esme's words as the trash they were.Her tone turned glacial. "Put Cary on."


Esme hadn't expected such composure-it felt like swinging at air. "Keep dreaming. He's never speaking to you again. You made his grandmother sick. He despises you now."



With that, she ended the call and blocked Evelina's number. She turned to her brother. "Think that'll do it? Will that woman finally let Margot go?"



Every word she had just spat-on speakerphone-was carefully scripted by Sebastian.



"I did some digging," he said. "She's just an orphan,raised on idealistic notions of loyalty and gratitude.Cary's grandmother was kind to her-she won't stomach the idea of that old woman suffering because of her."



"Exactly," Esme smirked. "Girls like her... give them a shred of kindness, and they'll sacrifice everything.Pathetic."



Sebastian chuckled. "Not everyone is as sharp as you,dear sister. Still, a stroke of luck that the old lady's health took a dip..."


Esme scoffed. "Don't remind me. If that crone hadn't fallen ill, Cary wouldn't have rushed back. He was supposed to pick you up with me."


"Doesn't matter..." Sebastian waved it off. "What matters is Evelina caves. Once she does, Cary will think we orchestrated everything. He'll be grateful.He'll trust you even more."



That made Esme's lips curl-a slow, calculated grin."You're a genius."
In reality, Demi had caught nothing more than a mild seasonal illness. It had nothing to do with Margot's predicament.



But Evelina didn't know that. And she cared too much about that old woman.



As long as she bought the lie, she'd break. She'd secure Margot's release. And when she did, Cary and his mother would be elated-convinced the Barton siblings had saved the day.


Which meant, soon enough, Esme would officially become Mrs. Gibson.
###Chapter 31 The Way Mr.Russell Shows Love
Evelina wasted no time in calling the Gibson family's butler to verify if Demi was truly unwell. Skipping lunch entirely, she prepared to head straight for the Gibson estate.



Florrie made several attempts to stop her,but none succeeded.



Just as Evelina reached the door,a voice rang out from behind. "Evelina, where are you going?"



Jasper's tone was composed, yet there was an unmistakable authority in it.



She paused momentarily. "Demi isn't feeling well-"



"And neither are you!" His words carried a mix of disapproval and concern. "Your back injury hasn't fully healed,you just recovered from an illness, and you've spent the whole morning taking care of me. Do you think you're unstoppable?"



His brow creased slightly as he spoke in a firm voice."Sit down. Eat first. lan will take you there later."



Florrie grasped Evelina's hand. "You better listen to  Uncle Jasper. He's terrifying when he's upset."



Left with no alternative, Evelina returned to the table,where Jasper personally served her a bowl of soup.


The aroma was inviting, but she had no appetite.



"If Demi's condition were severe, her family would have taken her to a hospital by now. Since she's still at the estate, it's unlikely to be urgent. A short delay won't change much."



Jasper's voice was steady as he placed more food onto her plate.


"Eat something first. If Demi sees you pale and exhausted, it'll only add to her stress, which could make her feel worse."



Evelina had to admit his reasoning made sense.


But as she stared at the overwhelming portion before her,she looked exasperated. "Jasper, this is way too much."



"If it's too much, share with me." Florrie pushed her bowl closer, pouting. "Uncle Jasper only looks after you now. He doesn't even serve me food anymore."



Evelina felt embarrassed right away.


Jasper scooped a spoonful of soup for his niece and  smirked. "Even with your mouth full, you still find a way to chatter,huh?"	7



Once lunch was over, Jasper stayed true to his word and had lan drive Evelina to the Gibson estate himself.



She grew restless during the ride, and as soon as the car stopped, she hurried out.


However, to her astonishment, the household staff blocked her path. "Mrs. Gibson has made it clear-you are not welcome here. Leave now, or we'll have to throw you out."


Evelina insisted they contact Asher, the butler. "He'll let me in. I promise this won't cause trouble for you."


But the servants merely sneered. "Asher is busy tending to Mrs. Demi Gibson. No one has time for the likes of you, you wretched woman."


Wretched woman? Evelina had no doubt Elora was behind this.



Her patience wearing thin, she narrowed her eyes and sneered, "What did you just say? Care to repeat that?"


"Well said!" A sharp, grating voice interrupted. Elora approached with a triumphant sneer. "You had my daughter locked up, and now you dare show your face here?"
With her arrival, the servants, who had been intimidated by Evelina's glare, instantly regained their confidence.



Evelina refused to lower herself to Elora's level. She kept her composure. "I only came to check on Demi   1



Elora practically spat the words at her. "Who do you think you are? You have no right to see her!"


Hands on her hips, she gave a commanding order."Bring a broom and chase her out! Let's see if she ever dares step foot here again!"



At her signal, one of the servants lifted a broom and swung it at Evelina.



"Annoying," Evelina muttered, bracing herself to fight back. But before the broom could land, a swift kick sent the servant sprawling.


"Who did that? Who dares lay a hand on one of our household workers-" Elora's outrage flared, but when her eyes landed on lan, her anger evaporated in an instant.



She quickly shifted to a sickly sweet smile. "Mr.Russell? What brings you here?"



Jasper had no interest in dealing with the likes of the Gibson family, so lan was sent in his place.


"I heard Demi was ill and came to visit. But it seems my presence isn't welcome," lan remarked coolly."Ms.Marsh,let's go."



His words left Elora dumbfounded.



Shaking her head, she hurried to explain, "N-no! Of course, you're always welcome here! We just don't want that troublemaker anywhere near us-"


"Mrs. Gibson!" lan's voice was sharp, cutting through her excuse. "Ms. Marsh is a valued guest of the Russell family. Insulting her is the same as insulting us."



His cold gaze swept over Elora and the servants who had humiliated Evelina as he firmly demanded,"Apologize!"
###Chapter 32 She Can't Be Wronged
Elora had always held herself above Evelina in the role of mother-in-law. Now, to imagine her conceding error to Evelina seemed utterly beyond the realm of possibility.



Not only Elora, but even the servants who leaned on her support exhibited too much pride to offer Evelina an apology, given her lack of familial support.



lan chose not to waste his breath. With a simple motion towards Evelina, he said, "Ms. Marsh, we should leave."



Understanding lan's tactic, Evelina realized that the Gibsons, given their stature, would likely avoid causing any upset to the Russells from Ireah. With this in mind,she confidently walked away.



As predicted, no sooner had they started to leave than Elora came rushing after them, pleading, "Mr. Russell,I implore you not to hold a grudge. I will apologize this instant."



Both Evelina and lan stopped to witness how Elora would proceed. Unexpectedly, Elora's apology came out as a whisper,barely heard.


Evelina, anxious to reunite with Demi, had no desire to linger over disputes, yet lan was not inclined to let Elora off the hook so quickly.


Prior to their arrival, Jasper had emphatically instructed him to protect Evelina from any slight or mistreatment by the Gibson family.


Confronting Elora, lan said, "Coming from a modest background yourself, Elora, you should certainly recognize the proper way to apologize. Are you dismissing us because you feel superior to the Russell family?"



The insinuation that she disrespected the Russell family left Elora profoundly alarmed.


"You're wrong, Mr. Russell,there's been	a misunderstanding..."



She attempted to clarify, but lan was beyond hearing her out. He signaled to a bodyguard of the Russell family to demonstrate how to make a proper apology.


The bodyguard bowed deeply before Evelina and earnestly said, "Ms. Marsh, I apologize. My actions were incorrect, and it won't happen again. I hope you can forgive me."

Witnessing this, the servants of the Gibson family quickly mimicked the gesture, each bowing and offering apologies to Evelina.



Meanwhile, Elora remained unmoving, her visage contorted with barely contained anger.



She pondered the repercussions of such a gesture.How could she command respect and run the Gibson Mansion if she submitted to Evelina?


With eyes burning with anger, Elora confronted Evelina, saying, "Do you expect me to apologize in such a manner? I am your mother-in-law. It is unseemly for you to demand an elder's apology."


Evelina was aware that forgiving Elora now would only embolden her further.



Moreover, lan had made significant efforts on her behalf.Disappointing him was not an option.


"Actually, you're no longer my mother-in-law.Considering the ordeal you put me through over the past three years, an apology is indeed what you owe me."



The need for apologies extended beyond Elora to almost everyone in the Gibson household, with the exceptions of Demi and Asher. Evelina had contributed so mnuch to the development of Gibson Group, only to be relegated to the status of a servant, her dignity constantly undermined.


Elora opened her mouth to retort, but lan, showing his irritation, quickly interrupted her, "Mrs. Gibson, we really must be going. You don't have to apologize if you choose not to, though I must warn you,the future of the Gibson Group could look quite grim."



A wave of humiliation washed over Elora, her hands balled into fists at her sides.



She had erased from her memory the incident years earlier when she had forced Evelina to kneel outside in the rain all night for a minor infraction.


Eventually, Elora bowed her head and grudgingly whispered, "sorry," but at that moment, Cary rushed up, exclaiming, "Mom, what are you doing?"



In a quick, covert motion, Elora pinched herself,forced tears, and cried out dramatically, "This is the most shameful day of my life. I can't bear to live with this disgrace..."



She believed her son to be Evelina's weak spot,expecting that her theatrical despair would compel Cary to defend her.


Filled with animosity towards Evelina, Cary was furious to see his mother submit to her. He exploded with anger at Evelina.



"Kneel before my mother!" Cary yelled furiously."Evelina, how dare you come into our home and bully my mother? Are you seeking your own ruin?"


While Elora's tears subsided, a small, satisfied smile played on her lips.


lan, witnessing Cary's outburst, scoffed. "Impressive authority, Cary," he replied, his patience clearly worn thin.



lan wondered how much worse Evelina's treatment might have been when he wasn't there to witness it if the Gibsons were bold enough to mistreat her so openly.



lan responded with cold disdain, "Your mother was out of line and insulted a respected guest of the Russell family. I simply requested an apology for Ms.Marsh. How can you call that bullying?" He scoffed,"It seems the Gibson family is courting disaster!"


A wave of anxiety clenched Elora's heart as she realized she had infuriated Mr. Russell once more.



She had calculated that with her son so incensed,Evelina would be groveling for forgiveness as she had in the past. Yet, Evelina remained defiant. Why hadn't she crumbled?





Cary,wary of antagonizing the Russell family directly,redirected his frustration toward Evelina."Why aren't you on your knees apologizing?"


His anger directly targeted at his former wife, who lacked any familial support, he escalated his tone."Remember, you are the reason for today's debacle!"
###Chapter 33 Have | Been Too Good To You
"Is that what you want? For me to beg?" Evelina's tone was cold as she stared down her former husband,recalling the three years she had dedicated to him.Her words fell with a cold clarity.


Cary and Elora, misinterpreting her resolve as submission, shared looks of triumph.


Cary's expression was particularly disgusting, filled with arrogance. "You need to kneel and beg for forgiveness."


lan's hands balled into fists, his restraint was evident.He thought that the Gibson family should be grateful that his boss had not attended in person, for the consequences for the Gibsons would have been terrible.



"Very well. You've brought this upon yourself."Without another word, Evelina swung her hand,landing a sharp slap on Cary's complacent face.



The impact turned Cary's head sharply, his cheek rapidly swelling and turning red.


Elora shouted, "Evelina, how dare you strike-""Utter another word, and he gets another," Evelina retorted, her fury undiminished.



Elora,typically/a bully towards the weak but cowering before the strong, was cowed by Evelina's ferocity and chose silence.



Evelina stepped closer, seizing Cary by the collar."Was I too kind to you? Have you forgotten the scorn you faced during your blindness?"



During Cary's period of blindness, Elora had merely wept and lamented, offering no support.


Margot was equally useless, criticizing Cary for his incapacity,while Demi abandoned him, seeking a new leader for the Gibson family.


During the turmoil, Cary's uncle took advantage of the chaos and assumed leadership of the Gibson Group.His reign was marked by the frequent degradation of Cary,Elora,and Margot, making their lives a misery.


Evelina became the pillar of the family,urging Cary to patiently wait for the right moment while orchestrating the restoration of his sight.



Utilizing her extensive network and assets, Evelina cleared a path for Cary to regain his role as CEO of the Gibson Group. Her investment vitalized the company, elevating it to its current prosperity Could Cary truly believe that all of their success stemmed solely from his abilities?



After scolding Cary, Evelina brushed past him and made her way to visit Demi.


Stunned by the slap, Cary touched his cheek, his senses slowly returning.Anger boiled within him as he longed to retaliate.



lan intervened, placing a calming hand on Cary's shoulder. "Haven't you grasped that without Ms.Marsh's intervention, you'd have been powerless against your uncle?"



Cary blinked in confusion. "How could a housewife contribute to my success?"



lan shook his head in disbelief.



Unbeknownst to such a naive man, his former wife controlled six major corporations and owned more than twenty mines. 2


Upon entering Demi's room, Evelina's anxiety eased at the sight of Demi suffering only from a cold.


She softly warned Demi, "Don't take a cold lightly. At you age, and with the seasons shifting, it's crucial to stay warm and steer clear of cold dishes." Evelina prescribed medicine to Demi and meticulously instructed the household staff on signs of concern to monitor.



Grasping Evelina's hand firmly, Demi expressed her gratitude. "You truly look after me like no one else in this family does."



Elora, unable to contain her displeasure, interjected sharply, "Demi, don't be fooled by her facade! She's not who you think she is!"



She had restrained herself from discussing Margot's predicament at Cary's request and out of concern for Demi's fragile health.



However, the day's events-Evelina slapping Cary and forcing Elora to apologize-had pushed her to her limnit.



"She Landed MMargot in police custody, and she still hasn't been released!" Elora's voice shot up into a dramatic wail as she burst into tears.


She continued, tears in her voice, "Margot, who grew up in comfort, is suffering like never before. How did I ever deserve such a terrible daughter-in-law?"


Overwhelmed by the news, Demi asked anxiously,"What's this about Margot at the police station? What happened?" Evelina, noticing Demi's distress, quickly provided a pill to calm her heart.



Yet,Elora persisted in maligning Evelina,regardless of Demi's health.



"Margot's just a child; what could she possibly have done wrong? It's all Evelina's doing-she accused Margot of orchestrating a kidnapping when in fact Evelina herself probably got tangled up with criminals _"




lan finally lost his patience and interjected, "Mrs.Gibson! Today has been eye-opening indeed.Hayden Reid and his crew have all confirmed that it was Margot who told them to abduct Ms. Marsh. That's the reason she's been arrested. How can you stand there and lie to Demi?"
###Chapter 34 The Initial Divorce Terms Are Cancel...
Elora attempted to counter, but Cary intervened,"Mom,let it be."



Had the Russell family not attended today, Cary and Elora might have swayed Demi to coerce Evelina into absolving Margot.



Yet,it was evident that Mr. Russell supported Evelina.



Cary remained puzzled over why the prestigious Russell family would align with Evelina.



"It's all your fault for raising such a 'wonderful child'who dared to do this to Evelina?" In a burst of anger,Demi struck Elora across the face in front of all present.



Elora could only gaze at Demi in shock.



Demi's focus remained solely on Evelina, comforting her. "My dear, you've suffered injustice at the hands of the Gibson family."



Elora's look towards Evelina was one of sheer loathing,as though she wished to destroy the latter with her gaze alone. Cary attempted to defend his mom. "Grandma, this isn't on her, it's all-"



"AlL what?" Demi interjected sharply. "Your mother has spoiled her children into blindness. And you, would you overlook it if Margot had been abducted by her sister-in-law?"



Certainly not!



Cary was adamant-any threat to his sister would be met with fierce revenge.



As Elora's tears flowed more freely, she pleaded,"Demi, Margot is your own granddaughter! Can you really stand by while she rot in jail?"


Demi scoffed dismissively, "Clearly, she needs to learn her lesson. Why else would she stoop so low against Evelina without provocation?"



"Please, Demi, don't worry about me. I'm not really going to let Margot face jail time," Evelina interjected,choosing to appease Demi by offering Margot forgiveness.



Demi looked at her with a mix of gratitude and sorrow."You're too kind, my dear, after all you've endured."



Yet, Elora was relentless, pressing Evelina to immediately formalize her forgiveness in writing. Infuriated by her daughter-in-law's audacity, Demi dismissed Elora from the room.



Subsequently, Cary, seeking to soothe his mother,quickly followed Elora out.


Once the room had quieted, Demi invited Evelina and lan to join her for coffee. She eyed lan thoughtfully before asking, "You're not MMr. Russell,are you?"


Demi had her suspicions during lan's last visit; given her mild illness now, it was unlikely Jasper would have visited personally.


lan acknowledged Demi's keen observation with a nod."Indeed, Mrs. Gibson, your perception is correct. I am lan Payne, Mr. Russell's aide. Ms. Marsh is a friend of Miss Russell, the latter specifically requested my assistance to escort Ms. Marsh here."



Upon learning this, Demi's tension eased. "It's no wonder;Evelina's reputation as an outstanding doctor and a person of integrity precedes her. It seems everyone she meets becomes a friend."



This was a stark contrast to her family's misjudgment of Esme, whom they valued as a gem despite her being nothing more than a counterfeit.



Evelina, with a soft touch, grasped Demi's hand."Margot isn't inherently evil. My suspicion is that Esme  has orchestrated much of this trouble. You must watch out for her, Demi."	シ



"That thought has crossed my mind too!" exclaimed Demi, one of the few in her family to remain discerning. She had already entertained the notion of Esme's deceit.



With a sigh, she asked, "When will Cary open his eyes to the truth and win you back?"



Evelina merely bowed her head, sipping her coffee.One chaotic entanglement was more than enough.



"Demi is clearly letting her imagination run wild,"thought lan as he rolled his eyes.


As they departed the Gibson residence, to their surprise, Cary awaited Evelina in the parking area.


His approach was patronizing as usual. "There's something I need to discuss with you."


Evelina, tired of endless disputes, saw this as an opening. Perhaps this was her chance to accompany him and finalize their divorce once and for all.



lan made the prudent decision to wait in the car,respecting his boss's directive to guarantee Evelina's safe return.



"You're transparent to me now," Cary replied, his  voice heavy with accusation. "All your manipulations,your deceitful tactics-they're just a ploy to extract money. But | won't be fooled. The initial divorce terms are canceled. Whether you sign this or not,I'm pushing forward with the divorce."



With that, he threw a new set of divorce papers at Evelina before turning on his heel to depart.



This revised agreement stripped away all the financial benefits previously offered, leaving her with nothing.
###Chapter 35 Queen Evelina's Counterattack
"Even the small divorce settlement wouldn't buy you a decent handbag, and yet Cary is clawing it back?"Caleb was exasperated.



As soon as he got Evelina's call, he had rushed to Morningstar Villas to strategize their next steps.


He'd always thought the Gibson family for lacking shame,yet they had outdone even his wildest notions of their greed.



"This is monstrous! Cary's actions are beyond forgiveness!" Florrie exclaimed, her anger was clear as she balled her hands into fists, all set to confront Cary directly.


"And Demi still hopes that her grandson will reconcile with Ms. Marsh," lan scoffed, disbelief coloring his tone.



lan had returned from the Gibson Mansion with updates, reinforcing the notion that the Gibson family harbored ongoing schemes against Evelina.


"He wouldn't have a chance!" Florrie and Caleb both shouted, their outrage mirroring each other's. Florrie stopped short, then quickly grabbed Evelina's arm, asserting her claim. "Evelina is part of the Russell family now,and nobody else's."



Caleb,seizing Evelina's other arm, said, "What are you talking about, Russell family? She's my family, and that's final."



Florrie's face scrunched up in dismay. "Nonsense!Evelina is mine,all mine!"



She had always thought Caleb was merely helping Evelina legally, not knowing he was a contender for her affection, challenging Jasper directly.



Now she finally understood why her uncle would grow tense as soon as he saw Caleb.



"Enough, both of you," Jasper finally said, bringing calm with his voice. "Florrie, remember, Evelina is still healing from her injuries."



Florrie promptly straightened up from where she had been resting her head on Evelina's shoulder,a show of her concern for Evelina.



Caleb,noticing Florrie's change in posture, sheepishly released his grip on Evelina.


Jasper,with a calm demeanor, turned to Evelina and inquired, "What's your plan moving forward?" He had always known Evelina as a woman of substance,unlikely to be rattled by the petty schemes of the Gibson family



Evelina offered Jasper a knowing smile. "I suspect Cary's abrupt decision to strip me of everything might be Esme's handiwork."



In Evelina's view, Cary had always been a puppet of his own selfish desires, now manipulated further by Esme's scheming and Elora's disdain. They thought they could leverage financial means as a weapon against her.



Evelina's gaze hardened as she said, "Money isn't an issue for me. I can walk away without a penny,but the Gibsons will need to clear their debts. Caleb, draft a bill for Cary covering the cost of the surgeries I performed. Four surgeries, each at a minimum of five million, that's twenty million total."



Caleb,energized by Evelina's assertive stance, clicked his fingers in agreement. "Consider it done."



Evelina wasn't finished. "Moreover, inform him that I'm prepared to absolve Margot and drop all criminal charges in exchange for ten million in compensation."



Caleb hesitated. "Evelina,given your financial standing,demanding a billion from the Gibson family wouldn't be out of line." The requested amount of ten million seemed rather insignificant.



"Do you really believe the Gibson Group could net a billion?" Evelina asked, her tone laced with incredulity.They wouldn't fetch that much even if they liquidated the entire company.



With a decisive tone, Evelina instructed her assistant,Lena, over the phone, "I've met my responsibilities to the Gibson family. Moving forward, we will no longer offer them discounted raw materials."



Evelina had previously supported Cary's corporate struggles against his uncle by providing materials at half their cost. It was time to adjust those terms back to standard market rates.



"Furthermore, our affiliated retail brands will stop overpaying for Gibson Group products. We'll assess their offerings on par with all others, prioritizing only those that offer the best value and quality."



She was curious to witness how the Gibson Group would fare in the competitive market without her favorable support



Chaos erupted within the Gibson Group the following day.



Executives flooded Cary's office, delivering one piece of awful news after another.



"Mr. Gibson, terrible news-the cost of our raw materials has tripled overnight. Suppliers are sticking to what they claim is the current market rate, and they're not shy about giving our allotment to others if we refuse."



"Mr. Gibson, there's more bad news-our clients are only offering to pay half of what they used to for our products, claiming that our competitors provide better quality for the same price."


"Mr. Gibson, there's an urgent issue-the Sight Weaver has issued us a bill demanding twenty million for medical procedures."



Cary turned to Esme, who had just arrived to bring him lunch. "A bill from the Sight Weaver? But aren't you the Sight Weaver?"



Esme,who had previously flaunted sapphire earrings worth three hundred million Cary had gifted her, was now supposedly billing for twenty million more for surgeries? This confusion deepened his frustration.
###Chapter 36 Perform
Surgery On Your Behalf



"Indeed, I'm the Sight Weaver." Esme hesitantly took the surgery bill, guilt flashing briefly across her eyes as she scrambled for an explanation. "It seems there might've been a mix-up with my lawyer. Perhaps he sent this by mistake."


Disbelief filled Cary's eyes. "Not just a bill-the lawyer included a letter, too."



According to the letter, if the twenty million wasn't settled within three days, the Sight Weaver intended to sue Cary.



Esme's pulse quickened, yet she managed to maintain her facade. "I distinctly told my lawyer otherwise.How could such an error occur?"



Glancing anxiously at the contact number listed below,she reassured him swiftly. "Relax, Cary. I'll clarify this immediately."



Realizing she couldn't risk making the call in front of him, Esme discreetly stepped away to a secluded corner before dialing.


 
Moments later, Caleb's phone rang. Noting Esme's caller ID, he promptly handed the phone over to Evelina.



Activating her voice changer, Evelina answered indifferently, "Yes, who's speaking?"



Unfamiliar with the altered voice, Esme cleared her throat politely and adopted an ingratiating tone."Good day. I'm Esme Barton-| studied under Professor Landen Mitchell and was a junior to the Sight Weaver. Could you connect me with her directly,please?"



Hearing Esme's sweet tone, Caleb visibly shuddered.


This woman changed personas with unsettling ease.



"This is the Sight Weaver," Evelina said, prompting an enthusiastic squeal from Esme on the other end.



"Hello! I'm thrilled to finally make your acquaintance after hearinng so much about you." Esme greeted with an unusual deference.



Yet,Evelina remained skeptical."There was no one by the name of Esme Barton among my mentor's students."



Esme's cheeks turned red with shame. "Well, I wasn't formally enrolled, but I did attend some of Professor Mitchell's lectures. I'm technically your junior-"
Evelina interjected sharply, "Let's skip the pretenses.What do you need?"-



Desperately, Esme said, "There's an ophthalmology surgery I need help with in three days. Could you possibly oversee my work?"


She laid on her charm thickly, much like she did with her male acquaintances,hoping it would sway Evelina.



Evelina responded firmly and disgustedly, "I'm not available for that."



Esme asked, "What if I compensate you generously?"



Evelina retorted, "I'm not interested in your money."



"But surely, everyone has a price," Esme insisted,trying to bait her.


Pushing her final offer, Esme said through clenched teeth, "What if Ioffer six million for a session? Would that change your mind?"



Evelina couldn't hide her disdain.



Esme was backed into a corner and raised her bid."Seven million..."



Evelina answered with nothing more than a chilly scoff. Esme clenched her jaw. "Ten million-that's seriously everything I've got."
"You charged the Russell family fifty million for that surgery on Miss Russell," Evelina said,knowing well the stakes involved.



Sweat beaded on Esme's forehead.



Indeed, she had quoted fifty million, conditional on the success of the surgery and Miss Russell's recovery.


At present, her advance payment was merely ten million.


"That's a fabrication! I never-" Esme stammered, but Evelina cut off the call.


Evelina instructed Caleb, "Ignore any calls from Esme.She needs time to think over her actions before the operation."



Esme had overstepped by impersonating her and misusing her mentor's respected name, and now she faced the repercussions.


"Okay, we'll leave her to ponder her situation. But Evelina," Caleb interjected with a change of subject."Isn't today your day for shooting practice?"


Evelina, caught off guard, responded, "Shooting practice? Why would I do that?"


Caleb's words startled Evelna's memory. "You set up a shooting contest with Idris from the Ghost Market to trace your biological parents,remember?"



At his reminder, the years Evelina had spent seeking her origins came flooding back. Finding her biological parents wasn't about reunion; it was about understanding her beginnings and the reasons behind her abandonment.



Throughout her nationwide search, she had uncovered no leads, pushing her to enlist help from the elusive Ghost Market.



Rumors circulated that the Ghost Market's leader had connections deep enough to find any secret.



Navigating the market's unique rules had been challenging, but eventually, Evelina managed to establish contact with Idris Cortez, a key confidant of the market's boss.



With Idris's resources, the possibility of locating her parents seemed finally within reach.



"When is this contest happening?" Evelina had assumed she had more time to prepare.



Caleb's expression turned grim. "It'sset for tomorrow.Idris is an acclaimed marksman. You'll need to outshoot him to gain his assistance."



This news caught Evelina completely off guard.
###Chapter 37| Am Determined To Win Evelina
The city's premier shooting club in Aglonard buzzed with anticipation for the upcoming competition.



Drawn by Idris's fame, enthusiasts and admirers alike filled the venue, eager to witness the event.



Accompanied by Jasper, Florrie excitedly attended to support Evelina.



Initially hesitant, Jasper had worried Florrie might grow bored-or worse, encounter trouble just before her critical surgery.


However,Evelina convinced him gently, suggesting,"Florrie's trying to hide her fears about the surgery behind her optimism. A change of scenery could really help ease her nerves."



Jasper quickly agreed,reinforcing security measures in line with Evelina's thoughtful advice.


Florrie,delighted,affectionately kissed Evelina on the cheek. "You're amazing, Evelina! Uncle Jasper,always follow her suggestions from now on!"


Evelina effortlessly offered solutions for others, yet  when confronting her own troubles, she tended to handle them quietly, alone.



"Relax, Evelina." Caleb reassured confidently. "I've trained diligently with a nationaI shooting champion -my aim won't let you down. Just focus as usual."


The rules, set by Idris, required each participant and their partner to shoot three rounds, with the combined total determining the winner.


Back then, Idris had confidently chosen his bodyguard as his partner, while Evelina had picked Caleb.


Only after the teams had been finalized did Evelina discover ldris's partner was a former national shooting champion!



Unfortunately,changing partners was impossible-ldris had clearly specified any substitutions would invalidate the match.



Caleb had minimal real-world shooting experience,so they had delayed the competition for three long years.



"We'll give it our all," Evelina said firmly. She'd once been a renowned sharpshooter herself, the primary reason Idris eagerly accepted her challenge


Yet,objectively speaking, their combined expertise fell short compared to ldris and his highly skilled bodyguard. "Your best won't cut it, my dear Evelina," Idris teased,his eyes lingering on her appreciatively. "You've grown even more captivating."


Approaching confidently, Idris's bald head glistened,his broad smile stretching from ear to ear. "Don't forget our little bet-if you lose, you'll be my girlfriend for an entire month."



Caleb bristled angrily. "You tricked us! We agreed to bring trusted associates, and yet your partner is a champion shooter."



Idris chuckled slyly, clearly amused. "My bodyguard is indeed my most reliable person-nothing unfair there."


Evelina said coolly, her tone sharp, "Idris, the deal was you'd have one month to try winning me over if I lost."


Pursuing her was vastly different from an actual commitment. Evelina intended to ensure that distinction remained clear.



Moreover, despite the disadvantage, she wasn't ready to concede defeat before the competition had even begun.


Idris, his gaze greedy, scratched his chin with a smirk."Isn't it practically the same thing? I'm determined you'll be mine,Evelina." The thought of a beautiful young woman skilled in marksmanship thrilled him deeply.



Caleb couldn't contain his disdain. "Unbelievable! At nearly fifty, you're still eyeing Evelina?"



Idris, confidently rubbing his belly, retorted, "Perhaps Evelina prefers someone skilled. We older men understand the finer points of cherishing a woman..."



Suddenly, Jasper's cold voice interjected through the air from behind Idris, "It appears you have some pending loans with the Russell Group Bank. Care to explain when these will be cleared?"


The weight of Jasper's words made Idris tremble with fear.



Idris spun around to find Jasper stepping closer,and he hastily straightened up, his tone respectful. "Mr.Russell, to what do I owe this unexpected visit?"



Jasper's demeanor was cold as he replied, "I'm here about y/our debts."



A bead of sweat trickled down Idris's forehead as he replied, "Such a trivial sum... Surely it's not worth your time."



Ignoring his comment, Jasper moved to Evelina's side and said reassuringly, "This is merely a small challenge, and I've placed my bets on your victory."



Idris flinched, interpreting Jasper's statement as a veiled threat.



The implication was clear: losing to Evelina wasn't just an option; it was a mandate from Jasper himself.Failure to comply could have terrible consequences.
###Chapter 38 He Already Has A Fiancee
"Jasper, place a bet for me as well. I'm betting on myself," Evelina said confidently.


She smiled gratefully at Jasper for his support, which only added to the tension Idris was feeling.



The more united Jasper and Evelina appeared, the more intimidated Idris became. He knew better than to mess with someone backed by the Russell family.


"Let's check the firearms, Evelina," Caleb suggested with a hint of annoyance, noticing Jasper's subtle flirtation, as he led her towards the shooting area.


The shooting range was effectively isolated from the spectators by dual layers of robust tempered glass.


Upon entering,Evelina noticed Florrie's excited waves from the viewing area. Her spirits lifted, and she responded by forming a heart shape with her arms above her head, directed at Florrie.



Though Florrie couldn't clearly see the gesture,Jasper, seated next to her, would undoubtedly describe it. Florrie mirrored the gesture with delight, sending a heart back to Evelina.



"Ms. Marsh, you really know how to work the game,getting close to Mr. Russell like that."


Idris stood off to the side, watching Evelina with the Russell family, jealousy eating away at him. His tone turned bitter as he asked, "Don't tell me you've already become his woman?"


Caleb reacted fiercely. "Mind your language! It's Jasper who's pursuing her, not the other way around.Evelina hasn't consented to anything yet."



"That's good to hear," Idris responded with a smirk,still hopeful about being Evelina's first choice.


He was still aiming to be the first man to win Evelina's favor, given that Jasper hadn't yet succeeded.



From the stands, Jasper watched the scene unfold with folded arms. Then he turned to face lan with a half-smile.



lan, sensing something was amiss, touched his own face anxiously. "Is there something wrong with my face,Mr.Russell?"



Jasper responded with a dismissive chuckle, "Seems like you're ready to leave this place. Perhaps a trip abroad would suit you?"



A shiver ran down lan's spine as he quickly replied,"Mr. Russell, I'm on top of the task you assigned! We still have an hour before the deadline you set. I assure you,that individual will no longer be a problem very soon." lan stood to make a crucial phone call,accelerating the efforts back in Ireah.


Jasper had explicitly given lan three days to resolve a serious issue or face relocation abroad. lan knew better than to neglect such a significantresponsibility


Meanwhile, at the shooting range, the four competitors finished checking their firearms and took a few practice shots to prepare for the upcoming challenge.



The competitors were assigned randomly for each matchup.



The first one pitted Evelina directly against ldris.


"Ms. Marsh, have you checked the odds they're giving outside? It seems Mr. Russell is your only supporter.It's been a long time since your last big win." Idris angered Evelina. "And with your recent time as a nanny,I doubt you've kept up with your shooting. Why not concede now? You're just in this for your parents,right? Lose gracefully, and I'll still help you find them -if you agree to be my girlfriend." Evelina's response was swift- a sharp, defining gunshot that interrupted Idris.



She glanced at him with clear disdain as he hastily retaliated with a shot of his own.



Up in the stands, Florrie couldn't contain her excitement, asking Jasper, "Has Evelina won?"


The announcer soon made the call. "Ms. Marsh scores a perfect ten, Mr. Cortez, nine."



Florrie's excitement peaked, and she tried to jump up,but Jasper gently urged her to sit back down. "Stay put,there are still two rounds to go."



Florrie,ever the cheerleader,beamed with confidence."Evelina's going to sweep the rest too!" she said,already proud of her champion.


As Evelina lined up her second shot, Idris unexpectedly let off his round early.



This unexpected move caused Evelina's hand to tremble, resulting in an eight-ring hit, while Idris matched his previous score of nine.



Now even, the tension rose as they readied for the final,crucial shot.



"Go Evelina! You're the best!" Florrie's voice rang out as she stood to cheer.



The encouragement strengthened Evelina, who paused to draw a couple of deep breaths, dispelling her prior shot's disappointment.



Catching Jasper's eye through the glass, she found him smiling encouragingly, a silent nod reigniting her resolve.



She lifted her gun and locked her sights right on the target's center.



Idris, smug from his earlier deceit, boasted once more before the final round. "Ms. Marsh, just so you know,because I fancy you-forget about Mr. Russell. He's engaged to Aurora Marsh, the Marsh family heiress."



Boom!Boom!



Their shots rang out in quick succession.
###Chapter 39 Now I Am Her Most Trusted Person
Evelina's shot went awry!



The news of Jasper's engagement cut deeply, and though she shouldn't have cared, the pain was real and immediate.



Her hand shook as her emotions swirled, causing the bullet to stray far from its intended mark, hitting only the outer sixth ring.



On the other hand,Idris nailed a perfect ten, his shot steady and sure.



This left Evelina four rings behind after just the first matchup. Given Caleb's skills, he was no match for Idris's bodyguard.


"Evelina, it's not over yet. I'll make up for it-"


Caleb's voice was hopeful, but his confidence was a facade. He knew his shooting was merely passable.Had Evelina held a four-ring lead,they might have the slightest chance to win.


Now, the outlook seemed bleak. Idris, cheerful and boastful, couldn't resist. "My bodyguard always scores tens. You don't stand a chance."



Even perfect scores from Caleb in subsequent rounds wouldn't be enough to secure a win for them.



With a chuckle, Idris was already looking ahead."Evelina, I've reserved us a table at a top restaurant.Consider it a date."



Idris's eyes lingered a bit too long on Evelina's form,his intentions clear in his unpleasant gaze. "'Perhaps after our date, we might extend the evening to a hotel-"



Smack!



A crisp slap cut him off.



Idris, stunned and outraged, turned to find Jasper standing there, the source of the slap.


"Why the sudden violence, Mr. Russell?" Idris protested in a wounded tone, his words laced with aggrieved bewilderment.



"You're in debt to me. Isn't that reason enough?"Jasper's look was cold, his presence imposing



Intimidated by Jasper's intense gaze, Idris backed down immediately.


"Florrie sent me to see how you're doing," Jasper said,his voice softening as he looked at Evelina with genuine concern.



Evelina responded, her emotions a jumble, "I'm alright,thank you." She was conflicted, caught off-guard by how close Jasper still felt.



Now that Jasper was engaged, Evelina wondered if it was appropriate to maintain their closeness. Should she step back?



"Evelina, there's been an unexpected development-"Caleb approached after finishing a call, his expression troubled and cautious. "I need to head back to lreah right away. A complication arose in one of my cases,and I have to handle it personally."


"You're leaving just like that? What about our match?"the bodyguard beside Idris asked irritably.


Still fuming from earlier, when he'd witnessed his boss being humiliated but was forbidden from retaliating,the bodyguard saw Caleb's sudden departure as yet another source of frustration.



With Caleb now stepping away without even competing, the bodyguard's frustration had nowhere to go. "You should handle your business," Evelina replied calmly, showing no resentment, only understanding for Caleb's difficult position.


Given Caleb's recent promotion at his law firm,unresolved issues could severely impact his professional standing.


Jasper quickly intervened, signaling to one of his own security team members, "Take Caleb to the airport immediately. I won't have Evelina worrying about your safety."



"Jasper's right," Evelina replied, comforted by the presence of a reliable Russell family guard accompanying Caleb.



"I understand," Caleb responded reluctantly,burdened by guilt at leaving Evelina during such a crucial moment.



After Caleb's departure, Evelina stood firm in her resolve to continue the competition alone.



Idris immediately objected, irritation clear in his voice."We agreed each competitor could bring one partner.How could you possibly compete twice yourself?"


He dismissed her efforts with a careless wave. "Just give up now.Considering your current state, is there really any point in pushing forward?"

His harsh words struck Evelina deeply, stirring a painful ache in her chest.


Evelina had made a promise to herself afterdeparting from the Gibson family; she would no longer pity any man, choosing instead to live solely for herself.


Still, Jasper's engagement stirred her emotions unexpectedly.



"I can take her place in the competition," Jasper said with ease, shrugging out of his jacket and neatly rolling up his sleeves.



Spotting the not-quite-healed scar from a knife wound on his arm, Evelina intervened, "Jasper, you shouldn't. Your arm still hasn't fully recovered."


"It's alright,it's pretty much healed." Jasper reassured her, flexing his arm to demonstrate its mobility. He then gave her a reassuring smile. "You're not worried I might make a fool of myself, are you?"


Evelina responded with a slight shake of her head, "Of course not,Jasper."


Evelina was hesitant to become indebted to Jasper,concerned about the complexities of their ties and wondering how she might later disentangle herself.


Idris, on edge, questioned Jasper's sudden decision to participate, asking, "Mr. Russell, joining at this stage..doesn't seem proper,does it?"



Jasper, with his military background, wasn't just any shooter; he was skilled enough to demand more challenging targets, which would put ldris's bodyguard at a distinct disadvantage.



"Wasn't it you who said each contestant could pick their most trusted to shoot? Well, I am her choice now,"Jasper replied firmly.


Looking down at Idris, Jasper mimicked the tone Idris had earlier used to intimidate Evelina. "What's the matter? Are you scared now? If so, you might as well concede defeat."



Idris swallowed hard, thrown off by Jasper's challenge."Mr. Russell, with a fiancee already, and still showing such closeness to Evelina... aren't you concerned about upsetting Aurora Marsh from the Marsh family?"
###Chapter 40 Mr. Russell Helps Evelina
Jasper,caught off guard,questioned, "What fiancee?"But then, he suddenly grasped why Evelina's performance had faltered.



His feelings were a mix of delight and irritation. He was pleased because her concern for him had impacted her focus, but he was annoyed by her lack of faith in him.



Had she really accepted those rumors about his supposed fiancee without seeking his confirmation?


"Mr. Russell, aren't you engaged to Ms. Aurora Marsh from the Marsh family in lreah? It's a lifelong agreement known since childhood, isn't it? I may be an outsider,but I'm well aware," Idris said, appearing to hold all the insider knowledge. His business thrived on trading secrets no one else could access.



Jasper, slicing through the implications, asked pointedly, "Did Aurora start this rumor?"



His disdain for underhanded tactics was evident.He didn't care to preserve Aurora's image. "Aurora is merely an adoptee in the Marsh family. The true heiress, Jazmine, has been missing for years. The engagement they talk about was never serious-it was just an old people's joke. Neither our family nor the Marshes have ever considered it binding. Yet here you are,broadcasting it as if it's a settled matter."



Jasper's explanations were intended to keep Evelina from worrying unnecessarily.


She found herself frustrated by her own reactions.Had she really overlooked that Florrie would not have been pushing for her and Jasper if he was engaged?And certainly, Margot wouldn't have the audacity to challenge an heiress like the Marsh family's.


"I was just blabbering, really! I have a terrible habit of speaking without thinking..." Idris, recognizing his misstep, began slapping his own face, hoping to appease Jasper with this gesture.



"Try to be a bit more persuasive with your self-punishment," Jasper replied dryly, unimpressed with Idris's dramatics.



Seizing an opportunity to soften Jasper's stance, Idris turned to Evelina. "Could you perhaps put in a good word for me with Mr. Russell? I assure you, there won't be any more careless talk from my side."



"Very well." Evelina gave Jasper a knowing look and nodded. "Jasper will dictate the terms for the next matchup." Jasper decided to escalate the challenge. "Let's add a twist-blindfolded, we'll disassemble our guns, put them back together, and then fire three shots at stationary targets to see who truly excels."



The color drained from Idris and his bodyguard's faces upon hearing the new challenge.


The task of assembling a gun while blindfolded was daunting enough, let alone aiming accurately at fixed targets without being able to see them.


"Mr. Russell, this is too much for me. Please, can we have something a bit less extreme?" Idris pleaded, his earlier boldness fading as he realized the full extent of Jasper's support for Evelina.


Unexpectedly, Evelina intervened on Idris's behalf."Jasper, perhaps we could ease up just a bit for ldris?"she suggested, her voice carrying a hint of sympathy.Idris quickly nodded his appreciation, hands together in a gesture of gratitude.


"Alright, if that's what you want, Evelina," Jasper replied smoothly. "We'll skip the blindfolds and go for moving targets instead."



With confident ease, Jasper aimed his pistol and executed three rapid shots at the targets darting across the range. 
Spectators from the viewing area were astounded."Did you see that? The targets were darting back and forth like swallows!"



Soon after, the announcer said, "Perfect score-ten rings each for all three shots. Ms. Marsh's final tally stands at fifty-four rings."



Cheers and applause filled the viewing area as the crowd celebrated the impressive display.



Jasper demonstrated the skills of an elite sharpshooter.





From behind Florrie, a woman's voice rang out,exclaiming, "What a show! He's truly a spectacle!"



Florrie couldn't hide her excitement.



Jasper's performance today was undeniably compelling, likely leaving a lasting impression on Evelina.



By now, Idris's bodyguard was drenched in sweat,while Idris frantically searched for a way out.


Jasper, with a smirk, mentioned he had been using his left hand. "Don't accuse me of unfair play," he said,implying his ease at the challenge, compelling Idris to reluctantly let his bodyguard take over. The results were as expected. The bodyguard, clearly not adept at hitting moving targets and crumbling under the pressure, only managed to score four rings,one ring, and missed entirely on the last attempt.



While Idris had notched up twenty-eight rings in the initial round, his bodyguard's meager tally of five rings in the subsequent attempt starkly highlighted their combined shortfall.


Through Jasper's strategic play, he had adeptly made up for the four-ring deficit Evelina had earlier conceded to ldris.



Jasper "consoled" Idris with encouraging words, saying,"You were only twenty-one rings short. Just a bit more practice needed for next time," clearly pleased with their decisive win.



Idris, unable to hide his irritation, twitched a forced smile.



Evelina, glowing in her triumph, reminded him. "Idris,you remember our agreement."



Idris responded, "Fine!" His reluctance was evident,yet he couldn't back out with Jasper watching.He then added a sly condition,"I'll assist in locating your parents, but in return, I ask for the Starry Night earrings."Those earrings?



Evelina recalled them instantly-the same ones Cary bought for Esme, costing three hundred million.

###Chapter 41 Friends Should Help Each Other


"Mr. Cortez, the earrings you're after already belong to someone else," Evelina said firmly, meeting his gaze."Perhaps you'd prefer anotheritem, or I can simply transfer three hundred million directly to your account."

Knowing the Ghost Market's customs, Evelina was fully aware that rejecting Idris outright would jeopardize her future dealings.

Therefore, she'd rather settle the hefty price without negotiation.

Idris blinked, momentarily caught off guard. "I hadn't realized you had such deep pockets, Evelina."

Under normal circumstances, he might have considered the generous offer, but after today's embarrassment, his pride wouldn't let him back down.

"The earrings are special," Idris insisted, feigning sincerity. "They're a birthday gift for my daughter."

Careful not to offend Jasper, he softened his tone. "If you can't make this happen, I'm afraid the Ghost Market can no longer serve your requests."

"Fine," Evelina interjected quickly, sensing Jasper was about to intervene once more-she'd already burdened him enough today.

She quickly added a caution. "However, Miss Barton recently acquired the earrings and might be reluctant to part with them. I'll need some extra time."

Idris, seeing a possible advantage, began calculating again, only for Jasper's cold reminder to interrupt sharply, "Speaking of timing, have you settled your debts yet?"

Jasper's words were unmistakably a veiled threat.

Whatever deadline Idris set for Evelina, Jasper would surely impose the same for ldris's repayment.

Idris reluctantly said, "My daughter's birthday is the seventeenth next month. I trust you'll deliver by then."
This provided Evelina with three weeks to negotiate the earrings from Esme, and she immediately agreed."Consider it settled."

Idris stormed off, his frustration evident, leaving behind disappointed onlookers who had hoped to gain his favor.

"Evelina," Jasper said gently. "You didn't need to accept so hastily."

"It's okay, Jasper." She reassured him confidently. "I wouldn't have agreed if I didn't have a backup plan."

Her expression softened, gratitude clearly visible. "I truly appreciate your support today. Without you, I can't imagine how difficult things would have been."

Losing wasn't the real issue-it was the thought of enduring Idris's unwanted advances for an entire month that unsettled her deeply.

Perhaps she'd been overly confident three years ago, thinking failure impossible, only to face heartbreak in her marriage.

"No need for thanks; helping each other is what friends do-"

Jasper was interrupted as Evelina's phone rang unexpectedly.

Caleb appeared onscreen in a video call, visibly concerned from the airport."1"mn so sorry, Evelina. Did you lose? If the Ghost Market falls through, I canstill help you-"

"Lose?" Florrie, overhearing Caleb, jumped in immediately. "Uncle Jasper helped Evelina win!"

"How is that possible?" Caleb's expression shifted; skeptical.

He'd reluctantly left when Evelina needed him most, and now Jasper had somehow conveniently saved the day--it all felt suspiciously orchestrated.

"Why not?" Florrie retorted defensively. "Your.poor shooting doesn't mean Uncle Jasper can't excel-he was a military sharpshooter!"

She eagerly praised Jasper, effectively silencing Caleb and raising Jasper's stature in Evelina's eyes.
Jasper was on a whole other level-there was no way Caleb could measure up.

"You're just showing off!" Caleb retorted at Florrie.

Evelina smiled quietly, amused by their playful banter.

Florrie proudly ended the call, satisfied with her victory, her earlier anxiety about the upcoming surgery nearly forgotten.

"Uncle Jasper, you were incredible today! Can you teach me shooting after my eyes recover?" she pleaded eagerly.

"Absolutely," Jasper answered warmly, grateful for his niece's lively defense.

"What about you, Evelina? Interested in learning?" he asked, suddenly turning her way with a look that carried more weight than the words alone.	

"Of course she wants to," Florrie replied swiftly, preventing any refusal.

She cleverly added, "But I'd rather not train alongside Evelina. She masters everything-medicine,combat,shooting. It would be intimidating. I'd prefer private sessions with Uncle Jasper."

Clearly, Florrie wasn't about to become a third wheel during Jasper's precious alone time with Evelina.

"Clever girl." Jasper praised affectionately.

Seeing Evelina's distraction, Jasper gently said, "With Mr. Quinn leaving, shall I recommend a reliable divorce lawyer for you?
###Chapter 42 Queen Evelina Finally Strikes Against Esme!


"Hmm?" Evelina was deep in conversation through text with Caleb when Jasper's interjection caught her attention. She glanced up, took a second to register his words, and responded, "Don't worry, Jasper.Caleb's in Ireah but he'll return soon."

Florrie, overhearing the conversation, expressed her astonishment. "Really? He's coming back already?"

She was aware that lan had exerted a lot of effort to ensure Caleb was sent far from Aglonard.

Evelina explained while texting, "He's actually on vacation. So after he deals with the urgent matter at hand,he will come back immediately." She looked at Florrie, confused by her reaction.there an issue?"

Florrie exhaled, trying to hide her concern. "No, it's nothing."

She sighed inwardly. Her uncle's journey to a love life seemed turbulent from the very beginning.



Meanwhile,at the Gibson Group, Cary was struggling under immense pressure.

The suppliers had increased their prices significantly, and the largest purchaser of Gibson's products was exploiting Cary's desperation by lowering their offers, relentlessly critiquing the quality, and demanding additional modifications.

Since his tenure began at Gibson Group, Cary had not encountered such a horrible situation. He was struggling to keep the company afloat.

Then, another urgent matter came from the finance department. "Mr. Gibson, there was a transfer of three hundred million from our funds to purchase earrings for Miss Barton. It's imperative you reimburse the company promptly. We're facing a multitude of issues lately, and our cash flow is critically strained."
The potential collapse of cash flow presented a terrible scenario that Cary couldn't even begin to fathom.

Cary's temper flared as he asked, "Is there no one here who can come up with a solution?"
The finance team was tasked with fund management, not revenue creation; their hands were tied.

Originally, when Cary decided to extract funds from the company's reserves, the finance director had staunchly objected.

Using his clout, Cary coerced her into compliance by promising a swift reimbursement within a month. She agreed,albeit with great reluctance.

"I've exhausted all options and now must turn to you for help, Mr. Gibson."

Yet Cary found himself equally devoid of alternatives and resorted to desperately calling for help.

His pleas for help were met with refusal after refusal.

"We previously extended help because of our debt to Ms. Marsh. Since you're no longer associated, our obligation no longer stands." This was the common retort from suppliers and buyers alike.

Only then did the reality dawn on Cary; the Russell family's remarks about his dependence on Evelina's influence to best his uncle weren't just mere assertions.

But how had Evelina, ostensibly just a housewife, managed to amass such leverage over influential businessmen?

Overwhelmed and disheveled, Cary slackened his tie and contemplated whether to dial Evelina's number,his thumb hovering over her contact.

It was merely a separation. Cary believed he could ensure Evelina wouldn't suffer financially and they could part as friends. Why was she complicating the situation?

"Cary, lunch is ready." Esme approached with a lunchbox, her demeanor soothing.

As he saw her, Cary felt his spirits lift, and he turned his phone over on the table.

Esme possessed intelligence, beauty, and a prestigious background. An alumna of an international university, she had been mentored by/Landen himself.

She surpassed Evelina in every way.
Evelina had been instrumental in his victory over his uncle, but Cary was confident Esmne could elevate his career even further.

"I'm truly fortunate to have you," Cary said, caressing her hand gently.

"Cary..." Nestling into his embrace, Esme murmured softly, "My brother inquired again today about our marriage. How much are you setting aside for my security? My family considers it a mere formality, yet they've set aside a hundred million as my dowry."

Though Esme projected generosity and understanding, her intentions were quite calculated.

Her family was ready with a hundred million; Cary should at least match that, shouldn't he?

Cary's face darkened at the mention of finances. "I've given you the Starry Night Earrings worth three hundred million. Doesn't that show my commitment?"

Esme felt a jolt of surprise but quickly masked it with a smile. "That's precisely what I reassured my parents.Yet, they feel it's insufficient. It's mostly for appearances, to impress our acquaintances."

She exhaled and said, "They insist on making a grand event out of my first marriage."

Cary caught the underlying scorn for his second marriage attempt.

His expression turned grim abruptly. "I need to go to a meeting. You better go prepare for Miss Russell's surgery the day after tomorrow."

Esme was taken aback by his curt dismissal. She lingered, hoping to speak further, but Cary had already exited the office.

Esme stamped her foot in annoyance.

She had managed to contact the Sight Weaver earlier today, only to be stunned by the demand for one hundred million to perform the surgery that could potentially restore Florrie's vision.

Refusal meant risking her false identity being revealed to the Russell family.

Desperate, she had turned to Cary for support, not anticipating his indifferent response.
Now what was she to do?

One hundred million-such a sum was nowhere within her reach.
###Chapter 43 My Wish Is That You Marry My Uncle


Evelina and Florrie were seated in an unmarked corporate car in the parking lot outside the pawnshop.

Jasper rarely allowed Florrie to accompany Evelina on outings, which made Florrie exceptionally excited today!


"Do you really think Esme will pawn those earrings? They're quite famous and unique," Florrie asked with a hint of doubt.

She personally would have sacrificed two villas before letting go of such precious earrings.

Designed by the illustrious Kristine Carpenter, who only crafted one jewelry piece per year for a predestined owner, those earrings were highly coveted worldwide.

Collectors globally vied for Carpenter's creations, fully aware that their value would only appreciate significantly/over time.

Evelina responded with certainty, "Yes, she will. I've asked for a hundred million to perform your eye surgery.Esme is desperate not to be discovered, and she'll surely scramble to assemble the funds."

Esme's family business overseas wasn't substantial enough to free up a hundred million quickly.

Her brother Sebastian had tied up his assets in the stock market, rendering him unable to assist.

And with the Gibson Group currently embroiled in severe financial woes, Esme was left with no choice but to liquidate her most prized possession.

The Russell family's bodyguard leaned in and whispered, "Ms. Marsh, she'sarrived."

Evelina observed Esme walking into the pawnshop, Sebastian by her side.

About thirty minutes later, the pawnshop owner called Evelina to confirm that the transaction was complete.

Afterward,Esme and Sebastian exited the pawnshop.
Florrie, astonished, asked, "Evelina, how did you know Esme would come to this pawnshop? There are many in Aglonard."

Evelina responded with a smile, "This pawnshop is the only one in town capable of handling a hundred million in cash, and I gave her an interest rate that's half of what others offered. How could she resist?"

"Is this pawnshop yours?" Florrie asked,impressed.

While many heiresses Florrie knew depended on their family's influence and wealth, Evelina had carved out her own path.

"Why don't we go in and have a closer look? You've always admired those Starry Nlight earrings, haven't you?"

Evelina took Florrie's hand, and they exited the car, with the Russell family's bodyguards trailing them.

Before Florrie's vision had faded, she had once seen the earrings and had always cherished that memory,though she had never touched them.

Inside the private viewing suite of the pawnshop, Evelina not only allowed Florrie to handle the earrings but also helped her try them on.

"Idris's daughter has a birthday next month. You can wear these until then, just make sure not to lose them."

"Are you serious, Evelina?" Florrie couldn't contain her excitement. "Please, take plenty of pictures for me.I want to see them all once I can see properly again."

Evelina laughed warmly. "It seems you've really taken a liking to these earrings."

"But it's not only the earrings," Florrie quickly added, her enthusiasm undimmed. "The Ocean of Stars sapphire necklace is breathtaking too. I've only ever seen it in photos, but it's magnificent."

"Ah,that necklace is also my favorite," Evelina replied, thrilled to discover their shared taste.

"Kristine crafted that three years ago, didn't she? Since then, she hasn't produced anything new. Maybe she's lost her muse?"
This remark resonated deeply with Evelina.

She had spent the last three years focused on her duties as a wife and daughter-in-law, healing Cary's vision, which had caused her to neglect her own desires.

The name Kristine had almost slipped from her memory.

"That's tragic, considering Kristine's stature as a world-renowned designer," Florrie said sadly.

"She won't stop creating," Evelina said, looking into Florrie's earnest eyes, which sparked a renewed sense of inspiration within her.

She grinned mischievously. "I predict Kristine will reveal a new sapphire necklace this year, named Angel's Eye!"

Florrie pouted slightly, playful suspicion in her tone. "You're just poulling my leg, aren't you?"

Florrie was no longer a child; did Evelina really think she could be tricked with fantasies?

"Why don't we place a bet then?" Evelina suggested, her tone playful.

She had taken Florrie out today not just for fun, but also to lighten her spirits before her important surgery.

"Here's the deal: if Kristine releases that necklace, it's yours-as long as you promise to follow through with your surgery without fuss."

Florrie's eyes lit up, and she nodded vigorously."Deal! But what happens if Kristine doesn't come up with anything new this year?"

In response, Evelina smiled warmly. "Then, Florrie, I owe you one wish-anything you want."

The joy in Florrie's eyes was unmistaable. She briefly contemplated the endless possibilities, then blurted out, "If that happens, then you have to marry Uncle Jasper-that's my wish!"

Evelina was momentarily speechless, caught off guard by Florrie's cheeky demand.

Laughing together, they made their way back to Morningstar Villas, unaware that they were about to encounter someone unexpected waiting for them at home.
###Chapter 44 To Prevent Any Potential Misunderstandings


That was a pretty woman, about the same age as Evelina.

Her appearance might not immediately draw the eye, but the ensemble of her features created an undeniable allure.

Warmth emanated from her; when Florrie walked through the door, she greeted Florrie with a smile that was both gentle and inviting, saying, "Florrie, you're back?"

This greeting, simple yet heartfelt, conveyed deep affection.

To an outsider, she could easily pass as Florrie's older sister due to her mature charm.

Recognizing the voice, Florrie expressed her surprise. "Aurora, what a surprise! What brings you here?"

While Florrie was not displeased to see her, she was taken aback, knowing Aurora's typically hectic schedule. She added, "Your visit must have been quite the effort; Aglonard is not just around the corner."

Aurora replied with concern, "With your surgery upcoming, I felt it was important to be here."

She moved towards them gracefully, her eyes quickly flicking to Evelina before she took Florrie's hands in hers.

Her gesture subtly implied that she saw Evelina as just a helper, even though it was delicately done.

Florrie, asserting her preference, said, "I appreciate it, but Evelina's support is all I need."

She clung to Evelina's hand, her comfort visibly anchored in the latter's presence.

Turning her attention to Evelina, Aurora asked politely, "And who might this be?"

Florrie proudly responded, "This is Evelina Marsh, invincible and revered by all-a true gem." She was enthusiastic in her praise, ensuring Aurora recognized Evelina's importance.

Aurora had never heard such praise from Florrie, and a flicker of envy was evident in her eyes upon hearing Florrie's words.

She had been secretly impressed by Evelina's beauty even before the latter entered the room.

Evelina's appearance was distinctly commanding, a rare type of beauty that even the elite of lreah would acknowledge as exceptional.

Anxiety surged within Aurora. Jasper had left Ireah just days ago, and already a woman of such allure was by his side?

"Hello, Evelina. Isn't it interesting that we both carry the Marsh surname?" Aurora maintained a gentle smile,but her words were tinged with subtle implications.

She was, after all, from the illustrious Marsh family of Ireah.

"Hello, it's nice to meet you," Evelina replied, maintaining politeness but with a reserved tone.

Aurora represented herself as Jasper's fiancee from the Marsh family.

Despite Jasper's apparent disinterest, Aurora had set her sights on securing their marriage, a fact well-known to Florrie who had observed her consistent efforts to win him over.

Evelina chose not to linger around Aurora, particularly with the surgery impending. Any distraction could prove costly, akin to the stakes at the shooting range.

In high-stakes surgery, unlike a shooting contest, there is no room for error.

Feigning exhaustion, Evelina said, "I think I'll head to my room for a bath."

"Are you staying here in the villa?" Aurora demanded.

She had arrived loaded wih her travel bags, only to learn from the housekeeper that during this sensitive time, visitors were not permitted to stay overnight-an explicit directive from Jasper.

So how come Evelina was exempt?

"Absolutely, Evelina stays as my personal physician to monitor my health," Florrie explained, hoping her response would also deter Aurora from considering an extended stay. Yet Aurora insisted, "Florrie, I'd like to stay with you as well. After such a long journey, it feels unsafe to seek accommodations elsewhere..."

Florrie found herself unable to reject the request, and Evelina didn't feel it was her place to intervene.

"I'll check with Uncle Jasper," Florrie said, her youthful indecisiveness leading her to yield.

From the doorway, Jasper's authoritative voice interrupted, "No need for that."

He had just wrapped up some urgent business at the Russell Group's local office and walked in just as Aurora expressed her desire to stay over. He quickly dismissed the idea.

Tears formed in Aurora's eyes as she looked at him imploringly. "Jasper, why can't I stay?"

Jasper glanced at Evelina, relieved to see she appeared unaffected by the situation before he allowed himself a subtle sigh of relief.

"To prevent any potential misunderstandings," he explained crisply, his voice reflecting a hint of annoyance."You understand, don't you?"
###Chapter 45 Eat With The One You Love


Aurora's fist tightened unseen within the folds of her sleeve, her nails inadvertently piercing her palm.

She was acutely aware of Jasper's implications. Previously, she had declared herself his fiancee without his protest.

Now,why this sudden concern for misunderstandings?

Was it Evelina he was protecting?

At that moment, Aurora's disdain for Evelina intensified.

Yet,she quietly wiped away her tears and agreed with a nod. "I'll respect your decision."

Jasper merely grunted, his indifference clear; this was the correct course of action.

The villa's butler, sensing tension, attempted to mitigate the situation. "Mr. Russell has arranged for Ms.Aurora Marsh to stay at a nearby hotel."

His attempt to lighten the mood backfired, drawing a sharp glance from Jasper. "Enough," Jasper scolded softly.

The butler withdrew to the kitchen, his presence no longer required in the conversation.

Aurora, troubled by the arrangement, wondered why a nearby hotel would feel so distant compared to the villa.

Jasper's favoritism towards Evelina baffled her!

When it was time for dinner, Evelina remained in her bath in the guest room, absent from the dinner table.

Aurora thought that Evelina had realized her place and chosen not to join them at the table.

She prepared some of her best recipes herself. Florrie couldn't help but compliment, saying, "Aurora, your cooking is amazing. The person who ends up with you is lucky indeed."

Pleased by the compliment, Aurora cheerfully dished out more food for Florrie and Jasper. "If you enjoy it,I'm happy to cook like this every day."

Cooking daily? That's a role typically reserved for someone in the family.

Regretting her earlier enthusiasm, Florrie quickly declined. "You shouldn't have to cook every day, Aurora.Someone with your gifts should be doing much more significant things."

This made Aurora even more delighted. "Making money doesn't mean I can't enjoy cooking for you."

To dodge further complications, Florrie concentrated on her meal.

Finishing quickly, Jasper said, "I'm done. Enjoy the rest of your meal." He had been quiet throughout dinner and seemed eager to leave.

"Aren't you eating much, Jasper? Is something wrong?" Aurora asked, looking concerned.

"I need to join a video conference," Jasper replied curtly, headed straight to the study, eager to escape Aurora's presence.

But when Evelina was around, it was completely different.

Jasper found it hard not to smile when he watched Evelina eat, her cheeks stuffed, reminding him of a chipmunk, which always improved his own appetite.

"Florrie, was it wrong of me to come? Jasper seems so distant when he sees me," Aurora said aloud, her voice tinged with sadness.

"How could that be? Aurora, don't think like that. Uncle Jasper is probably just preoccupied with my upcoming surgery."

Aurora had once given a kidney to help her adoptive grandmother, compromising her own health, and Florrie hated seeing her distressed. She searched for the right words to ease Aurora's worries. "I'll prepare some of Jasper's favorite treats tomorrow, maybe that will brighten his mood," Aurora responded,regaining her composure as she continued to dine with Florrie.
Yet, even as the butler eventually escorted Aurora to her hotel, Jasper did not return.
"Jasper, do you really have such a low opinion of me now? You weren't always like this," she murmured to herself, puzzled by his change of attitude.
Aurora glared at the study's glowing window, her thoughts souring as she considered Evelina the root of all her troubles.

She was convinced Evelina was bewitching Jasper.
Later, in the solitude of her hotel room, she urgently made a call, saying, "Dig up everything you can on Evelina!"
In her mind, no one else was worthy of being at Jasper's side.
Meanwhile, Evelina, fueled by a burst of creativity during her bath, hardly touched her dinner, too excited to begin sketching her new jewelry design, the Angel's Eye.

Having completed a preliminary sketch, her hunger finally caught up with her, prompting her to head to the kitchen. Upon entering, she was greeted by the delicious smell wafting through the air.
"The kitchen prepared a special snack for Mr. Russell since he worked late," the butler said as Evelina entered.

It turned out Jasper had a specially prepared late-night snack waiting for him. Evelina realized there wasn't much to spare and felt a bit dejected, reaching for'a pack of crackers instead.
Before she could open it, Jasper intervened, taking the crackers from her hand, "Those aren't very filling.Join me for some proper food instead."
Despite his usual avoidance of late-night meals to keep fit, Jasper had ensured that there were dishes prepared for Evelina, especially since she hadn't eaten much of her dinner.
"Won't we run short, Jasper?" Evelina asked, just as a servant appeared, laden with dishes that soon covered half the table.

"Will this suffice?" Jasper asked, smiling at her.

The table was now overflowing with food, far more than they could possibly eat.

Evelina's enjoyment of the meal seemed to inspire Jasper's appetite, and he found himself eating more than he planned.
###Chapter 46 Only Gentle To Evelina


Evelina hesitated when Jasper mentionedthen realized he was talking about Aurora. She nodded in understanding."I understand."

So why didn't she seem happy? She didn't even bother coming down for dinner.

Before he could delve deeper into his questions, Jasper checked himself, recognizing it wasn't his place to probe too deeply.

He continued, "My family and the Marsh family have to keep up appearances, despite the complexities.That's why/ I couldn't just send her away, even though I wanted to."

Aurora's unexpected presence irked him, yet societal norms required him to maintain a facade of politeness.

Evelina reassured him. "It's alright, Jasper. No need for theatrics on my account."

She was puzzled, though, by his need to elaborate so thoroughly as if she might have misconstrued his intentions.

Jasper's smile showed his relief. "Thank you. Try to rest now."

He was about to leave when his phone interrupted with a call from the hospital. "Is this a relative of Aurora's? You're listed as her emergency contact."

"I'm just a friend; what's happened?" Jasper's expression turned grave.

"The situation is she's developed acute gastroenteritis and needs to be admitted immediately," the caller explained, then disconnected after providing the necessary information.

"Evelina, I have to go to the hospital," Jasper said, his reluctance clear despite the necessity.

Aurora's unexpected visit to Aglonard placed Jasper in a difficult position; her well-being was now-his responsibility, complicating matters with her infJuential family.
"Sure, take care. I'll be fine here with Florrie." Evelina reassured him, sensing his concern was more about leaving Florrie unattended than his own reluctance to visit the hospital.

"I must leave now." Jasper's discomfort grew as Evelina made no move to retain him.

"Drive safely," she called out casually as he depated. Barely a moment later, she yawned and retreated to the guest room for some rest.

Jasper departed with a mix of emotions, accompanied by the butler and two maids to maintain proper protocol at the hospital.

He informed Aurora, "I've informed your family. They will make arrangements for your care. These maids will assist you in the meantime. If there's anything you need, the butler is at your disposal."

Aurora lay feeble on the hospital bed, scanning his face for any sign of personal concern.

His expression remained impassive, devoid of the concern she so desperately sought.

Jasper always maintained a cool demeanor around women.

Yet, when it came to Evelina, his eyes softened,which puzzled everyone.

Under her blanket, Aurora's grip tightened, jealousy bubbling within her as she struggled to maintain composure.

"I apologize, Jasper. I didn't mean to complicate things upon my arrival," she said with regret.

"It's fine. Our families have long been allies, and it's natural for us to support one another. Focus on your recovery and try not to worry." Jasper reassured her without a hint of sentiment.

After speaking with her doctor, Jasper confirmed that Aurora's condition was manageable. He quickly set everything in order and was ready to depart.

Yet, Aurora was desperate to keep him there.

She had ingested the medicine deliberately to induce her illness, seeking to prevent Jasper from returning to Evelina.
"Do you need to rush back because of Evelina?" Aurora asked. Then she added quickly, "I'm sorry for the trouble. She must be bothered by this, right?"

Jasper's expression tightened visibly.

He often wondered if women thought their manipulations went unnoticed.

"Florrie's surgery is approaching. You're not involved, so, understandably, you don't grasp the severity of my concern," Jasper replied, deliberately omitting any mention of Evelina to prevent Aurora from viewing her as competition.

Jasper's irritation was evident. Even though she knew perfectly well that her frail health made her unfit for traveling, she still came all the way here unannounced. Her presence in Aglonard had only complicated matters.

"No, Jasper, please, you misunderstand..." Aurora, taken aback, quickly tried to clarify her position.②

"Perhaps I spoke too sternly. Forgive me. It's commendable that you visited Florre, though she's not your family," Jasper replied, his tone softening slightly but his stance remaining firm.

His remarks made it clear that there was no future for him and Aurora.

Despite this, Aurora persisted, clinging to a connection. "Florrie has always been likea sister to me..."

Jasper, uninterested in her feigned sentimnents, interjected briskly, "It's been a long day. Rest now. I'll visit again tomorrow."

With that, he departed swiftly, leaving no room for her to detain him.

"Jasper, wait..." Aurora called after him futilely.

She was burning with hatred.

Evelina had crossed a line by encroaching on her territory. Aurora vowed to exact revenge on her.
###Chapter 47 The Day Of Surgery
Esme exchanged Cary's gifted sapphire earrings for a hundred million, but she cleverly withheld most of the funds from Evelina.
She provided Evelina with a bank certificate displaying the total amount but only wired twenty million.
"The restoration of Miss Russell's vision will require multiple surgeries, not just one. I'll release the remaining funds based on the results," Esme explained.
Esme then issued a stark warning to Evelina, saying, "Ensure Miss Russell's full recovery if you expect to receive the entire payment. Fail, and your reputation might suffer."
Evelina couldn't help but chuckle. "And how exactly do you think you'll manage that?"
Even standing face to face with Esme and declaring herself as the Sight Weaver might not convince Esme of her identity.
On the phone, Esme's laughter had a manic edge. "You may hide, but I know where to find Landen's grave!"Evelina,appalled by the disrespect, said, "What are you planning with that?"
"Keep your end of the bargain with Miss Russell's eyes, and Landen's grave stays untouched," Esme replied coldly, then abruptly ended the call.
Surgery day came around swiftly.
Outside the surgical suite, Cary, Elora, and Sebastian's presence alongside Esme drew significant attention.All were impeccably attired, keen to impress the Russell family with their appearance.
Esme particularly stood tall and confident, her demeanor radiating conceit.
Should the surgery prove successful, she envisaged herself as the benefactor to whom the Russell family would forever be indebted.
"Mr.Russell!" Elora caught sight of lan near the operating room and quickly approached him.

lan's duty was to ensure the surgery proceeded without disturbances, flanked by bodyguards outside the operating room.

He also had to maintain Jasper's facade for the Russell family during these moments.

Inside, the real Jasper had already accompanied Florrie to the operating room, staying by her side at Evelina's allowance until the procedure was ready to commence.

"Mrs. Gibson," lan responded with courtesy, though he scrutinized Elora's extravagant dress with a critícal eye.


Elora, emboldened by his acknowledgment, didn't hesitate to plead, "Mr. Russell, my future daughter-in-law will undoubtedly restore Miss Russell's vision. In return, could you assist in releasing mý daughter from detention? She's been held for days now..."

lan interjected,"That's feasible. Assuming Miss Barton achieves success with the surgery, we can discuss this further."

Elora's expression brightened with hope. "Of course, Esme has already assured me-"

lan interrupted sharply, "But should she fail, you understand the implications."

The stern look in his eyes caused Elora to recoil slightly.

With a nervous flutter of her hands, Elora insisted, "That won't happen. Esme's record is flawless.You have nothing to worry about..."

lan's response was cold, curt.

Seeing further conversation was futile,Elora shifted her focus back to Esme, urging her to take extra precautions to guarantee the operation's success.

Meanwhile, Esme was caught in the middle ofa group of hospital staff and media, all eager for her comment or a photo, leaving her no chance to heed Elora's advice.
 Elora, unable to express her frustration openly, was interrupted by Evelina's arrival with her surgical team.
"How dare you show your face here, you wretch! You think you belong?" Elora confronted Evelina, her voice filled with hostility.
The surgical team, highly esteemed in their field, were taken aback by such hostility and stood ready to dismiss Elora.

"Dismiss it, everyone, please proceed inside and start setting up," Evelina instructed her team toward the operating room, eager to prevent any additional disturbances before the surgery commenced.
Elora, mistaking Evelina's composed demeanor for weakness, escalated her taunts.
"Really, who are you trying to deceive? You bastard, an orphan with no formal education, dare to enter this hospital in such attire? Are you here to cause problems? You must be terrified that Esme will successfully treat Miss Russell and win Demi's favor, leaving you out in the cold with the Gibson family."

Her words attracted the attention of Cary, Esme, and others nearby.

Cary,observing Evelina in her immaculate white coat, suspected her of trying to provoke him and even fantasized that she was provocatively dressed beneath it.③

He pretended to uphold moral standards, scolding Evelina, "What's with this getup? This is a hospital, not a venue for your indecency."

Esme sneered at Evelina, "Donning a white coat doesn't make you a doctor, Ms. Marsh. You look utterly preposterous."

Her mockery led others, including uninformed staff, to laugh and point at Evelina.
Sebastian was taken aback by the beauty of Cary's former wife, his envy tinged with fascination.
"Divorced and yet here you are, dressed provocatively to chase him down! Calling you brazen barely covers it! Such women ought to be expelled on the spot!"

Supported by the crowd's reaction, Elora even demanded the Russell family's security, saying, "Expel.this disruptive woman immediately!"
###Chapter 48 The Confrontation Before Surgery


The bodyguards of the Russell family remained still, observing the Gibsons with an air of incredulity.

Evelina, finding their antics hilarious, burst into laughter. "Have you all finished?"

Elora was gearing up to hurI more insults, but Evelina prevented her by brandishing a letter. "I intended to free Margot today, but your behavior has changed my mind."

In full view of everyone, Evelina ripped the letter apart and confidently entered the operating room.

Stunned by her actions, Elora and Cary recovered too late to intercept her. The door to the operating room shut before they could reach it.

lan stood firm, blocking Elora and her entourage from following. Elora pounded her feet in frustration.

"Mr. Russell, this is ridiculous! You should be expelling her!" she exclaimed.

lan's stare was cold as he replied, "Mrs. Gibson, I don't need instructions on how to manage my responsibilities."

Elora was so scared, she didn't even dare to open her mouth again.

Esme then stepped up to defend Elora, saying, "Mr. Russell, there's been a misunderstanding! Evelina has tricked Demi with her doubtful medical skills. We were merely cautioning you against her deceit!"

Elora added quickly, "She's nothing but a fraud pretending to know medicine."

lan, losing patience, shouted, "Eńough! Have I not made it clear that Ms. Marsh is under the Russell family's protection? What right do you have to defame her so blatantly?"

Esme and Elora, cowering in fear, stepped back behind Cary.

Cary was confused and concerned. Hadn't the Russell family been pleading with Esme to conduct~the surgery today? Yet, why was lan reacting so aggressively?
It was Aurora, clad in a hospital gown, who intervened and calmed the situation, persuading lan to allow Esme into the surgical area.

Aurora contemplated joining them, yet given Jasper's recent coldness, she decided against entering and remained outside.

Upon her entry into the operating room, Esme was taken aback by the sight of the changing room, the cleaning area, and the operating room entrance, which were all heavily guarded by the Russell family's armed bodyguards.

With anxiety mounting, she made her way into the changing room and frantically dialed the Sight Weaver's number on her phone.

The phone remained silent except for a message that popped up, instructing,"I'm already in the operating room,come here directly."

Esme's confusion mounted. She had reached out to the Sight Weaver upon her arrival at the hospital,who was not yet present.How could she have entered the operating room before her?

With no other options and a rising sense of desperation, Esme sent a threatening message. "Don't play any tricks, or Landen's grave will suffer!"

She included a photo of Landen's tombstone in the message. If the Sight Weaver pushed her,Esme wouldn't think twice about splashing red paint and waste oil all over his grave.

Receiving no response, Esme convinced herself that her intimidation had been effective.

She then completed her preparations and approached the operating room clad in her surgical gear.

Inside, Florrie was already sedated, with the surgery imminent. Jasper reluctantly stepped away from his niece as the anesthesia took full effect.

"I need to enter now! I'm the Sight Weaver, the lead surgeon for Miss Russell," Esme said, confronting the Russell family's bodyguards who blocked her path.

"Let her in." Evelina's voice rang out, striking a chord of familiarity with Esme-though she couldn't bring herself to believe Evelina was the surgeon that day.

As Esme confidently strode towards the operating table, she failed to recognize Evelina, whose face was obscured by a surgical cap and mask.

She surveyed the medical staff and surgical tools arranged on the table, then noticed Florrie, already prepared on the table. "Where is she?"

Esme's demeanor suggested she was in charge.

"Which 'she' are you inquiring about?" asked Evelina's skilled assistant, Dorothea Martinez.

"The esteemed senior to whom l've made my payments," Esme responded, clearly expecting some recognition for her financial contribution.

"Are you perhaps looking for the authentic Sight Weaver, Miss Barton?" Dorothea retorted with a hint of sarcasm, puzzled by the confidence of this apparent imposter.

"Your statements are confusing." Esme was too cunning to openly confess that she wasn't the real Sight Weaver.

"Was my comment unclear? Very well, from this point, you'll lead the surgery. Also, be aware that this procedure is being filmed and broadcast live."

Dorothea gestured towards the camera mounted in the operating room, adding a stern warning, "Mr. Russell has arranged for top ophthalmology experts to observe. Any slip-up, and you may find yourself unable to leave.Please,proceed!"
###Chapter 49 Esme Was Driven Off The Operating Table


Esme's complexion drained in an instant!

What was the Sight Weaver plotting? After pocketing such a hefty sum from her, was she really intent on pushing her over the edge?

"Isn't this too much? Do you think I won't retaliate if you keep behaving so disgracefully?" Fury erupted within Esme as she shouted, fully aware that the Sight Weaver was in the crowd, listening.

"Esme Barton!" Dorothea's voice rang out sharply. "If you truly are the Sight Weaver, then prove it by performing this surgery.Otherwise, leave at once!"

Even now, Esme refused to acknowledge it. "Shut your mouth! Of course, I am-"

"A fraud! Someone who couldn't even secure a place in Mr. Mitchell's graduate program dares to claim they were his student? Have you ever even wieldeda scalpel? What gives you the right to stand in this operating room?"

Evelina pulled down her mask, revealing her face as she glared at Esme. Her voice was icy."Get out!"

Esme's eyes widened in disbelief. "How can it be you? This is impossible!"

Evelina smirked. "Didn't you try to get close to me over the phone? Strange how you don't recognize me now."

"No! That can't boe! You never even attended college. How could you be Landen's student?" Esme screeched, panic setting in. "She's the liar! You've all been tricked!"

The medical staff cast her disdainful looks, as if she were nothing more than a spectacle.

Dorothea scoffed. "While I was assisting Ms. Marsh in surgeries, you were out partying, chasing after the heir of the wealthiest family."

After assisting Evelina with Cary's final surgery, Dorothea took a few days off to relax abroad.
The nightclubs there were famous, and she had gone with friends.

That was when she spotted Esme, desperately trying to charm the local tycoon's son by performing a provocative dance.

Cary had naively believed Esme returned for him, when in reality, the wealthy heir had discarded her and married the daughter of an influential politician.

She hadn't come back out of love-her schemes abroad had failed, leaving her no choice but to try her luck with Cary.

"If Cary had any sense, he'd check immigration records and see that you hadn't stepped foot in this country for three years. How could you have operated on him while being absent?"

Dorothea's words shattered the last remnants of Esme's composure.

Since returning, she had relished Cary's attention, nearly forgetting the shame she had endured overseas.Why bring it all back now?

Madness took hold. Grabbing a scalpel, she lunged at Evelina, shrieking, "If I can't have peace, neither can you.Die!"

Evelina's first instinct was to dodge, but doing so would leave Florrie vulnerable to Esme's blade.

She couldn't let that happen. Instead, she braced herself, preparing to wrest the weapon away.

At the last second, a figure appeared, yanking her aside and delivering a brutal kick to Esme's side.

"Aah!" Esme cried out as she hit the floor, the scalpel clattering beside her.

It was only then that she seemed to register what she had just done.

"No, I-It wasn't me! | didn't do anything!" she wailed, gripping her head. Attempting to flee, she barely made it past the doorway before the Russell family's bodyguards seized her.
"Are you alright? Did she hurt you?"

The person who had stepped in was none other than Jasper. Concern filled his face as he held Evelina close.

He silently thanked his instincts for staying near the door, keeping watch. If he had left, Evelina might have been seriously injured.

"I'm okay, Jasper," Evelina murmured, shaken. Guilt crept into her voice. "I should have never let Esme in."

"This isn't on you. You didn't expect her to snap like that. That woman clearly has deep-seated issues."

Jasper placed his hands on her shoulders, steadying her. "Stay strong, Evelina. I trust you to handle Florrie.Leave the rest to me."

A wave of relief washed over Evelina as she straightened. "I won't let you down,Jasper."

With that, Jasper departed, and the surgery commenced.
###Chapter 50 The Operation Was Successful


Moments ticked away,each second stretching endlessly.

At last, after four intense hours and thirty minutes, Florrie's initial eye operation reached a triumphant conclusion.

During the intervention, two unforeseen hurdles emerged, both requiring meticulous handling. A single error could have resulted in irreversible loss of sight.

Thankfully, Evelina's deep expertise and remarkable precision navigated the situation flawlessly.

Jasper, waiting restlessly beyond the surgical suite, was visibly tense. Still, he never questioned Evelina's capabilities-and rightfully so.

"The surgery went brilliantly! Congratulations, Mr. Russell! Congratulations, Miss Russell!" Warm wishes flooded in from the surrounding crowd.

Specialists from the ophthalmology department, who had observed the entire operation via live feed, stood in ovation. "The Sight Weaver certainly lives up to the legacy of Mr. Mitchell's top protege. Her real-time judgment and ability to defuse critical moments are unparalleled."

"No surprise she was chosen as his student-her aptitude far exceeds ours."

"If only she could perform more operations at our facility-each case is an invaluable lesson we could analyze repeatedly."

"I wonder if she'd be open to mentoring. Our university boasts several gifted students-we'd gladly negotiate terms if she's interested."

"You're too eager. Today's learners aren't so easy to guide. But if the Sight Weaver agrees to be a guest lecturer, that alone would be a win."

Eager to secure her before someone else did, the specialists hastily departed, determined to recruit Evelina.
"Evelina, you've done a remarkable job," Jaspersaid softly, stepping forward to support her as she emerged visibly drained.

"It wasn't too bad. After this operation, Florrie should regain partial sight, though things will remain a bit hazy for now. She'll need to recuperate before we can proceed with the next step."

Despite her fatigue, Evelina's expression carried satisfaction. "Don't worry, Jasper. I'll make sure Florrie fully recovers."

Overcome with emotion, Jasper found words difficult. All he could manage was a heartfelt, "Thank you."

Evelina had not only delivered an outstanding surgical performance but had also ensured thorough follow-up arrangements for Florrie's healing.

To ensure her safety, Jasper instructed lan to have the room monitored constantly.

Since it would be a while before Florrie came to, Jasper offered gently, "Let me take you home so you can rest."

Initially hesitant, Evelina almost declined. She was never one to show weakness and usually managed alone.But today, being the second day of her menstrual cycle, she felt particularly drained.

So she gave in.

"Thanks." Jasper's gratitude took her by surprise.

She chuckled, "Mr. Russell, you're giving me a ride. Shouldn't I be the one thanking you?"

"I appreciate you letting me help," he replied. Otherwise, he would feel truly indebted.

To him, Evelina seemed untouchable-brilliant, well-connected, self-sufficient. He doubted he had anything meaningful to offer her.②

Glancing sideways, Evelina studied the man beside her as if seeing him anew.

She had always thought Jasper was refined and quietly romantic.

Whoever was spreading stories about him being cold and heartless clearly had no idea what they were talking about.

Meanwhile, outside the operating theatre, the Gibson family and Sebastian received news of the operation's success with cheerful excitement.

Elora, particularly impatient, intercepted lan. "Where is my future daughter-in-law, Esme? Why hasn't she come out yet?"

She had once antagonized Mr. Russell over Evelina and now feared that asking for help with Margot's release would be denied.

She pinned her hopes on Esme, believing her to be their savior after the successful operation.

Given Esme's supposed achievement, Elora assumed any request from her would carry weight with the Russells. Whatever she asked for would surely be granted!

"Esme?" lan sneered and gave the order to bring her out.

Esme hadn't just lied to the Russell family-she had endangered others in the operating room. She couldn't be let off easily.

Her punishment,however, would be left to Evelina to determine-per Jasper's directive.

"Esme, darling, there you are. Please talk to them about Margot..." Elora gushed, not noticing Esme's strange expression.

Clutching Esme's hand, Elora begged her to intervene.

Esme remained stunned, her mind clouded with confusion and a throbbing headache. She had no idea how to face reality.⑦

"Elora, it's been a long and stressful surgery. Give her a moment to breathSebastian said, misreading Esme's dazed state as a result of fatigue from the high-intensity surgery.

He had no clue that her deceit had already been unveiled.

Still clinging to his hopes, Sebastian believed Esme might persuade the Russells to make a financial investment,helping him cash in on the stock market.

Cary,ever thoughtful, handed Esme a thermos. "Here, have some soup. You must be thirsty."

The Gibson Group was struggling, and a mere nod of approval from Mr. Russell could change everything.

These people all mistakenly saw Esme as their shortcut to success, unaware that their dreams were already shattered.
###Chapter 51 The Bet


"Perfect timing, Boss, Ms.Marsh!"

lan wasn't shocked to see Jasper appearing with Evelina closely at his side.

His immediate focus, however, was elsewhere. "Ms. Marsh, what are your plans for this woman?"

Sitting quietly and almost unnoticed outside the operating room, Aurora felt a deep jolt of disbelief.

She had accompanied Jasper to numerous high-profile events, dreaming endlessly of holding his arm-but he never permitted even a casual touch.

He'd sooner allow Florrie to cling affectionately than tolerate Aurora's slightest contact.

Yet now,he showed no resistance to Evelina at all.

Aurora had thoroughly investigated; Evelina and Cary might have signed divorce papers, but their separation wasn't officially finalized.

"Esme," Evelina called out clearly. "You haven't forgotten about our bet, haveyou?"

Hearing her name, Esme visibly flinched.

For the entire four and a half hours of Florrie's operation, the Russell family's guards had confined Esme in an empty operating room. She had desperately sought an escape route, only to realize that neither Evelina nor the Russells would show her mercy.

"You-" Elora started aggressively, only to falter under lan's sharp, warning stare.

Still, her arrogance remained undiminished.

"Thanks for the reminder-I nearly forgot," she sneered. "The agreement was clear. If Esme successfully performed the surgery, you'd publicly admit your mistake and apologize."

She even stepped aside mockingly, creating a space before Esme. "Now, apologize and make it quick.
Afterward, stay away from my son forever, or the consequences will be severe."

Sebastian arrogantly gestured toward Evelina, adding, "Hurry up and confess. My sister is forgiving-she might spare you further embarrassment."

Only Cary quietly protested, saying, "Evelina was wrong, but isn't a public apology too much?"

"You're divorced," Elora retorted fiercely. "Why are you still defending her?"

She insisted, glaring hatefully at Evelina, "The agreement explicitly called for a public apology. We've even been kind enough to exclude media coverage."

Evelina smiled mockingly, her voice steady. "If a public apology is what everyone desires, I'll gladly involve the media."

Turning a cold stare toward Esme, she added, "Name a date."

Esme frantically sought escape but found none.

Elora stared skeptically, her voice rising. "Evelina, are you insane? We're asking for your apology now-not later with media!"

Ignoring Elora completely, Evelina said firmly to Esme, "Let's schedule it in half a month-after Florrie's recovery. I'll travel to lreah myself."

Landen Mitchell's grave rested on the southern outskirts of Ireah.

"Please-no, l-I can't do it," Esme pleaded tearfully, pressing herself against the wall.
Earlier, Cary's view had been partially obscured by Jasper's bodyguards. Only now did he notice Evelina being supported by that handsome young man.

Anger surged through him, and he shouted, "Have you no shame? Always flaunting this man around! Look at Esme-she's still willing to spare you from humiliation. How could you ever compare?"

Evelina restrained Jasper, signaling subtly that this was her matter to handle personally.

"Esme," Evelina said coldly. "Have you clarified to everyone who really performed Miss Russell's surgery?"
Addressed directly, Esme remained fearfully silent.

Elora seized the moment, gleefully saying, "Speak up, Esme! Tell everyone loud and clear-it was your successful operation!"

Evelina gave a nod, and the bodyguards activated a recording on the large screen, clearly displaying footage from the recent surgery. "Watch carefully-recognize who's truly operating."

"Evelina?It was you!" Cary shouted in shocked recognition.

A whirlwind of shock, shame, and humiliation overwhelmed him, exposing how deeply he'd been deceived.

Elora stubbornly replied, "They all wore masks-it's impossible to identify clearly!"

Evelina countered coldly, "I also possess recordings from Cary's four vision-restoration surgeries."

Turning directly to Cary, she responded coldly, "By the way, payment for those four operations remains outstanding."

She made it clear without hesitation. "Prepare yourself for legal action."

"How can you possibly be Landen's student? You never even attended university! You're lying." Elora desperately refused to accept reality.

The truth-that the person she despised most had become a revered medical genius-was too humiliating to accept.
###Chapter 52 He's The Actual Jasper Russell!


"My education was completed abroad using a credit-based system. The faster you earn credits, the sooner you graduate," Evelina explained calmly, utterly shattering Elora's final defense.

Speechless, Elora opened her mouth to argue but found herself without words.

Her mind raced with a whirlwind of panic, anger, and disbelief, horrified by Esme's dangerous deception toward the powerful Russell family. Did this foolish girl not realize the consequences?

Dread surged through Elora, intensifying with each passing second.

Glancing sideways, she spotted Esme cowering against the wall, sobbing hysterically. Without hesitation,Elora lunged forward, grabbing Esme by her hair and striking her repeatedly. "You disgraceful liar! Explain yourself! Your parents are respectable people-how did they raise such a shameless cheat?"

Sebastian remained frozen in shock, barely processing the revelation that Cary's former wife was, in fact,the legendary Sight Weaver.

He snapped to attention only upon hearing Esme's screams, finally intervening weakly,"Stop hitting her!What's gotten into you?"

Elora refused to relent, gripping Esme's hair tighter. "She deserves worse! Of all families to deceive, she chose the Russells! Let her bear the consequences alone-don't drag our family down! We had nothing to do with her lies."

Desperate to show their innocence, Elora continued her furious assault, hoping to win favor from the Russell family.

Sebastian,helplessly ineffective, turned to Cary. "Your mother has completely lost it. Aren't you going to stop her?"

However, Cary's attention was entirely focused on Evelina, feeling deeply betrayed and manipulated.
"Jasper, let's leave," Evelina said softly, uninterested in the chaos unfolding. She was exhausted and simply wanted to go home.

As they moved to exit, Esme suddenly wrenched free from Elora's grip and lunged toward Evelina, only to be promptly knocked down by a Russell family bodyguard.

Lying breathless on the ground, Esme screamed in frustration, pounding the floor. "Why are you only targeting me, Evelina? So many others pretend to be you-why am I the only one paying the price?"

"Others are impersonating me?" Evelina asked sharply, frowning deeply. "Who else?"

Esme, lost in self-pity, ignored her question. "You think humiliating me will win Cary back? I won't let you succeed-he's mine! I've lost him before, and it won't happen again!"

"You wicked girl! You're using my son as a pawn?" Elora screamed, pouncing on Esme once more.

Neither Sebastian nor Cary could manage to restrain her.

Suddenly,icy water drenched the fighting women, abruptly silencing the scene.

Dorothea stood sternly with the now-empty bucket, glaring furiously. "Have you no dignity? This is a hospital, not a battleground! Keep this up, and I'll throw every one of you out!"

After giving them a piece of her mind, she turned and walked away with the empty bucket in hand.

With the Russell family's bodyguards standing nearby, both the Gibsons and the Bartons stared at her receding back, not daring to protest.

Evelina turned a cold glare toward Esme, who was shivering on the ground.

Evelina said,"Keep Cary all to yourself-but don't disgust me with your games. My issue isn't with him but your deceit in my mentor's name!

Thank you for letting me know about the others pretending to be me-none of them will escape punishment.Start thinking about your apology at Professor Mitchell's grave, and don't even think of escaping. Your malpractice is enough to land you behind bars!"
Esme's face turned ashen, and she promptly fainted.

Ignoring Esme entirely, Cary ran after Evelina, blocking her path as she prepared to get in the car. "Don't you owe me some kind of explanation?"

"What should I explain exactly?" Evelina retorted coldly."Would you have believed me if I had told you earlier that I restored your sight, before Esme was exposed?"

Though Cary knew deep down he wouldn't have, he stubbornly insisted, "You still should've told me sooner."

"1Fyou're looking for explanations, ask Demi why she also kept it a secret, you fool01:11Evelina retorted sharply,stepping into the vehicle.

As Jasper joined Evelina in the car, Cary angrily grabbed the door, confronting her again, saying, "Forget all that-how can you shamelessly associate with this gigolo in public?"

"Enough!" Evelina interrupted, finally losing patience. "Gigolo? He's the actual Jasper Russell!"
###Chapter 53 Cut Ties With Esme


"Hold on-he's actually Jasper Russell?" Cary exclaimed, completely stunned.

Before Cary could even grasp the situation, the Russell family's bodyguards coldly brushed him aside.Moments later, the car door shut decisively, and the vehicle swiftly departed.

Motionless, Cary stared after Evelina's retreating figure, a strange sense of loss gnawing at his chest.

An unsettling feeling washed over him, as though something incredibly precious had slipped through his fingers.

"Grandma-"

Cary stormed back into Gibson Mansion, his frustration bubbling as he approached Demi urgently."Have you known all along it was Evelina who restored my vision?"

Demi continued trimming her flowers, not even lifting her head. "You're only realizing this now?"

Cary stared. His grandmother had deliberately hidden it from him!

"Why keep me in the dark?" Cary asked, humiliation evident in his tone."Do you realize how embarrassing today was? You made me look foolish!"

"Oh, I've tried telling you countless times, but did you ever listen?" Demi accidentally clipped off a blooming flower, tossing her scissors aside with irritation.

Cary's righteous anger quickly diminished, replaced by defensiveness."When exactly did you mention it?I never heard anything."

"During every surgery you underwent, I explicitly or subtly told you-without Evelina, your sight wouldn't have returned," Demi retorted bitterly. "Yet,you never respected Evelina. Either you dismissed mny words or sided with your mother and sister in tormenting her."

With each passing sentence, Demi's disappointment deepened. "Evelina tolerated you all gracefully for three years. If I were her, your sight would still be gone. Cary, Evelina owes our family nothing-we owe her an apology."

Cary lapsed into troubled silence, unconvinced by his grandmother's sincerity.

Demi sighed deeply, frustration clear. "Let me reveal another truth-Margot returns tomorrow. Evelina intended only to teach her a small lesson, never truly harming her. Evelina's heart is gentle; she simply didn't want me worrying endlessly about my grandchildren."

Yet Cary remained skeptical. "Then why did she rip apart the forgiveness letter right in front of me?"

Demi bristled angrily. "It was merely an act! Evelina has never once broken her promise to me."

Earnestly, she continued, "Haven't you finally recognized Esme's true colors today? Without Evelina's protection, Esme would've brought down the entire Gibson family."

Cary tried weaklyto defend Esme. "Perhaps she had reasons-"

"What reasons?" Demi slammed the table in anger.1fyou still consider yourself my grandson, cut ties with Esme immediately and reconcile with Evelina."

For a brief second, Cary hesitated, his heart fluttering with uncertainty.

But then an image of Evelina and Jasper together flashed through his mind, unsettling him deeply.

The woman he'd once belittled had quickly found someone superior, openly parading their closeness. He didn't want a woman like that.

"She's just ambitious! She's not nearly as wonderful as you claim," Cary stubbornly said, deeply disappointing Demi.

Demi dismissed Cary with irritation, refusing even the courtesy of offering water.

Frustrated and unsettled, Cary aimlessly climbed into his car, driving off without any clear destination in mind.

His phone buzzed repeatedly-Esme's relentless calls-but he ignored each attempt to reach him.
Eventually, Cary shut off his phone entirely, refusing all further interruptions.

At the hospital, Esme panicked, abandoned by Elora after the beating, with Sebastian her sole remaining supporter.

"Sebastian, Cary won't answer. He always picked up immediately before. Is he leaving me for Evelina?" she cried in distress.

"He wouldn't dare!" Sebastian growled angrily."After what his family did, they're not getting off lightly!"

He quickly added, "If Cary backs out, sue his mother for assault and get her locked up."

But Esme, completely distraught, ignored his advice, sobbing uncontrollably. "Without Cary's protection now, I'll never survive the Russell family's wrath..."

"T'll deal with the Russell family for you," said a confident voice as a tall, captivating 'figure emerged suddenly.

"You?" Esme and Sebastian exclaimed simultaneously, their guard instantly raised. "Who exactly are you?"
###Chapter 54 A Pawn Against Evelina

The newcomer tilted her chin upward, her voice carrying a subtle arrogance. "I'm Aurora Marsh from Ireah's Marsh family."

Excitement flashed across Sebastian's eyes as he eagerly responded, "You're Aurora Marsh, the famed Marsh family heiress?"

Due to Aurora's adoption soon after the disappearance of the Marsh family's biological daughter, outsiders generally assumed Aurora to be the true heiress.
Aurora carefully masked her contempt with a graceful smile. "Jasper Russell is my fiance. Given that connection, the Russell family is prepared to overlook Miss Barton's minor indiscretion."
Sebastian practically jumped with joy, eagerly stepping closer to Aurora. "Thank you so much,Ms.Marsh!"

He saw himself as a good-looking, capable young man and hoped his looks might catch the eye of some wealthy heiress.

He wasn't aiming to marry into money-just wanted a powerful family to see his potential and trust him with their fortune. His dream was to become a stock market genius and the go-to name in financial advice.
"You don't need to thank me," Aurora replied curtly, subtly distancing herself from his overly enthusiastic approach. "If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to speak privately with Miss Barton."

Her politeness was merely for show; Aurora's personal security had already firmly escorted Sebastian from the room.

Esme felt a flutter of nervousness as she faced Aurora alone, uncertain yet intrigued."Ms. Marsh, may I ask why you've come to speak with me privately?"

Aurora offered an empathetic smile and said; "I'm here to help because we're facing similar troubles. I've learned about your history with Cary. Without Evelina's interference, perhaps you wouldn't have wasted so much precious time. Now she's leveraging her medical skills to get closer to Jasper.
I have complete trust in my fiance, but with our wedding date under discussion, I can't risk any unexpected issues. Surely, Miss Barton, you can sympathize with my position."

Hearing this, Esme immediately felt a bond of shared grievance against Evelina.

"Evelina is truly awful! She manipulates people using her charm and talents and steals men who don't belong to her," Esme bitterly exclaimed. Determined, Esme urged Aurora, saying, "You're the Marsh family heiress and Jasper Russell's fiancee; you absolutely cannot let her succeed."

Aurora gave a delicate sigh. "Unfortunately, my hands are tied. Florrie is family, and her recovery still depends on Dr. Marsh."
Eager to act, Esmne quickly volunteered. "Is there any way I can help you with this situation?",
"Thank you for the offer, but I don't need you to do anything directly," Aurora said gently. "Just protect your relationship from those who have ulterior motives."

Esme paused, stunned by Aurora's seemingly selfless intentions.

Was Aurora truly here just to mediate issues, without personal gain? Could someone this benevolent really exist?


Actually, Cary and I might never recover our relationship," Esme replied anxiously. "Could you possibly offer ore assistance?"
The assistant smiled discreetly. "I just can't stand Evelina. I've done this behind my boss's back, so please keep it confidential. I'll continue assisting you quietly."

Upon hearing that the assistant acted secretly, Esme immediately agreed to secrecy.

After studying the documents closely, Esme swiftly departed, unaware that Aurora's agents tracked every step she took.

Aurora reclined comfortably in her hospital room, savoring freshly cut fruit provided by her servant, a satisfied smile spreading across her face.

Esme mistakenly believed she could exploit Aurora; little did she know Aurora viewed her as nothing more than a pawn against Evelina.

Suddenly, Aurora's phone rang. She answered, listening as the person reported, "Evelina submitted a forgiveness letter to the authorities regarding Margot's case. Margot is scheduled for release tomorrow."

Aurora's eyes turned cold as she responded dismissively, "Must I handle such trivial matters myself? Find a way to ensure Margot remains detained a bit longer."
Match

ving enjoyed a peaceful night's rest at Morningstar Villas, Evelina swiftly packed some essentials before iding to the hospital to look after Florrie.

,to Evelina's attentive care post-operation, Florrie's vision recovery had exceeded all initial expectations ·the last ten days.

:le Jasper, I can finally see your face again! I'm beyond happy!" Florrie exclaimed joyfully.

a had reminded Florrie repeatedly to stay calm, yet Florrie's joy burst forth uncontrollably after years trapped in darkness.

ghout her life, her family had sought help from countless specialists, each concluding that regaining ht was impossible.

ed to a future of blindness, Florrie had almost lost hope-until her family discovered Evelina, the Sight


simply offering hope, Evelina had achieved the miraculous, restoring Florrie's eyesight completely.

vou've been incredibly brave and strong," Jasper said gently, tenderly wiping her joyful tears away.en carefully to Evelina's advice and please stop crying."

othed his niece with care, dabbing her tears away with a tissue.
Unexpectedly, Florrie suddenly lifted her head, eyes wide with wonder as she gazed intently at Evelina.

"Evelina, you're absolutely stunning! Far more beautiful than l imagined-and look at your amazing figure!"

Feeling slightly embarrassed, Evelina was surprised by Florrie's swift transition to playful teasing moments after regaining her sight.

She quickly glanced at Jasper, silently pleading for his assistance.

But Jasper merely smiled affectionately, clearly amused and indulgently letting Florrie continue her teasing.

Before Evelina could respond, Florrie's hands excitedly wrapped around her waist, holding tightly.

"Oh my goodness! Your waist is unbelievably slender! Uncle Jasper, you're incredibly lucky to have met someone so amazing! Uncle Jasper-"

Florrie mischievously addressed Jasper again. "You'd better cherish Evelina, because someone else will surely pursue such an exceptional woman... Ah! Aurora, you've come to visit me? Did you rush here from Ireah because you heard I'm being discharged today?"

Evelina only noticed Aurora standing at the hospital room's doorway after hearing Florrie's greeting.

Clearly, Aurora had been quietly observing the entire scene, absorbing every single playful remark from Florrie.

"Seems like l've interrupted an intimate moment," Aurora said coldly, forcing a tight-lipped smile that dripped with disdain.

"Not at all, you're right on timFlorrie responded cheerfully, deliberately emphasizing her earlier words for Aurora to hear.

Yet, merely letting Aurora hear those words wasn't enough.

She boldly approached Aurora, linking arms affectionately and saying casually, "Aurora, don't you agree Uncle Jasper and Evelina are simply perfect together? They look exactly like a married couple."

Her deliberate provocation was an unmistakable message to Aurora-Jasper was off-limits.
Aurora struggled visibly, fighting to keep her composure despite the insult, refraining from pulling away abruptly.

"But Evelina hasn't officially divorced yet, right?" Aurora's reply was subtly resentful.

Her implication-that Evelina was behaving inappropriately while still married-was unmistakably clear.

Evelina caught the sting beneath her words and knew whatever she didn't say out loud was probably even nastier.

Evelina was ready to fire back when Caleb's voice thundered from the doorway. "I'm the one handling Evelina's divorce case. She's officially free, and who she chooses to be with is her business-not yours,Aurora."

With casual ease, Caleb entered the room and protectively placed an arm around Evelina's shoulders.

Aurora's expression darkened with indignation. "Caleb, you're lowering yourself by involving with a divorced woman who's older-"

"At least I'm not desperately claiming to be engaged to someone clearly uninterested," Caleb swiftly retorted, deliberately involving Jasper. "Do you honestly see any hint of affection toward you from him?"
###Chapter 56 Evelina's Her Real Objective


Aurora's gaze instinctively flicked to Jasper, silently pleading, but he remained unmoved, offering no defense on her behalf.

Humiliation surged through her, draining the color from her cheeks and causing her knees to tremble.

"Caleb, maybe you're unaware-being new to the Marsh family-but there's long been a pact tying the Marsh and Russell bloodlines. With Jazmine no longer around, I'm the sole remaining daughter. It falls on me to honor that pact."

Determined to salvage her pride, Aurora clung to the verbal agreement once exchanged by the families'elders.

Caleb's anger flared.

Clenching his fists, he retorted, "Who claimed Jazmine's gone? You're adopted into the Marsh name. Are you just hoping they never find their real daughter? Let me make it clear: forget it! I was missing for years and still got brought home. Jazmine will come back too."

Aurora's face lost all color as Caleb's words hit her.

Tears welled up in her eyes. "T-That's not what I meant. Of course, I truly hope Jazmine comes back soon..."

Caleb sneered, "Cut the act. You don't need to pretend-your grandmother isn't here to see it."

"Aurora." Jasper's voice was laced with ice as he finally broke his silence. "That so-called marriage vow? It was nothing but idle talk between elders. Stop shackling yourself to it."

Aurora's tears fell instantly.

Ever since she'd learned of thie arrangement, she'd worked tirelessly to be the perfect partner for Jasper.And now he dismissed it as nonsense? Adelusion she'd forced on herself?

"He's right, Aurora," Florrie added gently. "You're brilliant and stunning-you deserve someone who truly sees your worth. My uncle simpoly isn't that person."

Even Florrie could sense the incompatibility between Aurora and Jasper.

They clearly weren't meant to be.

It was best for Aurora to release her grip on a one-sided hope before things soured further.

"I'm to blame! I should never have..." Aurora gasped, clutching her chest before collapsing.

Evelina moved to help, but Aurora's bodyguard was quicker, lifting her into his arms with a sharp look at everyone present.

Florrie's brows furrowed in guilt. "Was that my fault? Did I say something wrong?"

"What does this have to do with you?" Caleb sneered. "She's putting on an act. Gave her grandmother a kidney, has such a supporter wrapped around her finger, and now pulls the sympathy card whenever it suits her. When she wants someone out of the picture, she pretends to pass out."

Evelina, sharp as ever, had already picked up on the connection between Caleb and Aurora based on their exchange.

A sense of unease crept in. "Is Aurora trying to push you out of the Marsh household?"

Caleb was unfazed. "Does she even hold that kind of influence? My aunt is Vivienne."

"Evelina's her real objective." Jasper quickly grasped Aurora's scheme.

Thanks to Caleb's aunt and three cousins shielding him, even Ady found it difficult to confront him directly.But Evelina? She was far more vulnerable.

"What?" Caleb's expression shifted. "She wouldn't dare! If anyone lays a finger on her, they'll have to deal with me-wait a second!"

A sudden thought struck him, and he jabbed a finger at Jasper. "The friction between Aurora and Evelina-it all started because of you and your messy love life!"

Jasper paid no mind to Caleb's bluntness. He turned to Evelina, voice soft. "You don't have to be afraid.I won't let anything happen to you."

"You've got me too, Evelina," Florrie said, clutching her arm. "I'll stand by you. Actually, I should tell my mom, dad, and grandpa that you helped restore my vision!"

Florrie wasn't just offering support-she was ready to rally the entire Russell clan to keep Evelina safe.

"You smart lady." Jasper couldn't helpo but be fond of such a warm-hearted niece.

Just then, Evelina's phone began to buzz.

It was Demi. "Evelina, Margot still isn't back... Is something wrong?"
###Chapter 57 Name Your Price And Leave My Cousin


"What did you say?" Evelina reacted with disbelief. "I submitted the forgiveness letter more than ten days ago.This shouldn't be happening."

Margot should have been home with the Gibson family already, given the timeline.

"Demi,stay calm. I'll personally check what's going on at the police station." Evelina assured Demi before promptly preparing to leave.

"I'll accompany you," Caleb insisted. As her lawyer, he naturally felt responsible.

No sooner had they exited Florrie's room than a furious call from Ady Marsh interrupted them.

Years ago, Ady had nearly lost her life to kidney failure, and Aurora was the only suitable donor.

Without hesitation, Aurora donated her kidney, significantly compromising her health, earning immense affection and gratitude from Ady, surpassing even her real granddaughter.

"Caleb, I've overlooked your behavior so far because you're Vivienne's family, but your arrogance ends here!How dare you upset Aurora so badly that she fainted?"

Among her three daughters-in-law, Vivienne displeased Ady the most, primarily because Vivienne's husband,Franklin, indulged her excessively, undermining Ady's authority.O

"Understand clearly: This isn't over. Go apologize to Aurora immediately, and don't stop until she forgives you! Moreover, I've heard you're associating with a divorced woman-end it immediately. You represent the Marsh family now; behave accordingly and steer clear of questionable women!"

As a younger family member, Caleb listened patiently before calmly replying, "Thank you for your advice,but we aren't close enough for you to dictate my personal life choices."

"Your brat!" Ady erupted furiously.

Completely unfazed, Caleb said smoothly, "If that's all, I'll hang up now. Goodbye, Mrs. Marsh."
His cousins had repeatedly warned him about Ady's formidable nature and her tight grip over the Marsh family for decades.

Caleb considered himself sufficiently respectful; after all, he ended the caIl politely.

Evelina, however, immediately saw through his act. "You deliberately provoked Ady to redirect her attention from me, didn't you?"

Caleb innocently shrugged. "Me? NNever."

Appreciatively, Evelina patted his shoulder. "Thank you, Caleb. But Ady is your aunt's mother-in-law. Don't create trouble for her on my behalf."

Just as Caleb prepared a response, his phone started ringing nonstop.

His cousin, Damien, was calling, sounding extremely upset.

"You know my grandmother dislikes Mom, so why would you provoke Aurora? Grandma came personally to scold us."

He firmly instructed Caleb, "Apologize to Aurora immediately."

"Absolutely not!" Caleb stubbornly refused. "Besides, Jasper was also involved. Why isn't she confronting the Russell family instead?"

Frustrated, Damien massaged his temples on the other end. "Mom's health is fragile. Do you really want to force her to lower herself before Grandma because of you?"

Caleb hesitated, feeling deeply concerned for his aunt. "Aurora is obviously faking-"

"If Grandma believes Aurora fainted, then she fainted. Don't you realize that?" Damien's voice echoed loudly enough for Evelina to overhear.

After brief contemplation, Evelina said, "Caleb, perhaps it's best to apologize. Aurora worked hard staging this fainting episode. If you don't play along, she'll lose face, giving Ady more reason to trouble your aunt."

Understanding the logic, Caleb reluctantly gave in. "Fine, but it's purely for my aunt's sake."
Damien's tone softened noticeably. "Who's the woman with you? Let me speak with her."

Caleb held out the phone, placing it on speaker.

"Hello, this is Damien Marsh, third son of the Marsh family. I've heard you're the reason behind my cousin's conflict with Aurora?"

Without waiting for Evelina's reply, Damien continued bluntly, "Name your price. What will it take for you to leave my cousin alone?"
###Chapter 58| Choose Who I Marry,Not Her


Caleb intended to ask about what rumors Aurora had been spreading that caused misunderstandings within the Marsh family regarding his relationship with Evelina.

Instead, Evelina interrupted decisively, naming her terms boldly, "Alright, one billion!"

"One billion? You've lost your mind!" Damien's recently settled temper erupted again.

"You asked me for a price. Unless, of course, Caleb isn't even worth that much to your family?" Evelina retorted mockingly. "How about this-I'll use the billion to buy shares in your law firm and gift them directly to Caleb."

Evelina might not rank among the richest globally, but when challenged financially, she never hesitated.

"You!" Damien was utterly taken aback, stunned speechless for a moment. His voice trembled angrily."You'll regret this!"

"Damien,listen carefully. You pressured Caleb to apologize to Aurora, who's clearly pretending to faint, all because of your mother's situation. Aurora's behavior is the issue, yet you're meddling in Caleb's personal life." Evelina pointedly criticized. "I thought Caleb rejoined your family seeking warmth and acceptance.Clearly, I was mistaken-you're hardly real family."

Finishing her firm declaration, Evelina confidently ended the call.

Caleb stared at her, eyes sparkling with admiration, gripping her arm enthusiastically. "You're incredible,Evelina! Wait, are you seriously gifting me a billion?"

Evelina had anticipated possible career obstacles for Caleb. Ever since his internship at Starry Law Firm began, she had quietly invested in acquiring substantial shares.

Although the amount hadn't reached a full billion yet, it was quickly approaching.

By the time Caleb planned to marry, she'd have enough for this grand gesture. However, revealing her plans Evelina playfully poked Caleb's forehead, shaking her head. "Stop dreaming.Go apologize now."

"But what about you?" Caleb hesitated, reluctant to leave her alone.

"Prioritize your family situation first. Apologize now so Ady won't have further reasons to torment your aunt," Evelina instructed gently. "I'Il handle the issue at the police station. If I need help, I'll contact you."

"Fine." Caleb sighed, leaving with obvious reluctance.

After Evelina drove away from the hospital, Jasper completed the discharge paperwork for Florrie.

He returned to find Florrie pouting, visibly upset. "Uncle Jasper, Ady is outrageous! Aurora clearly faked her fainting, yet Ady has the nerve to complain to us?"

To preserve the family's public image, the Russells had Florrie apologize to Aurora, though purely for appearances.

"I know, it's unfair." Jasper consoled his niece gently, stroking her hair comfortingly.

Immediately afterward, Jasper dialed Ady. "Mrs. Marsh, Jasper speaking."

"Ah, Jasper," Ady replied, assuming an apology was forthcoming and responded generously,"Aurora clarified-she fainted purely from exhaustion, not due to your family..."

"Glad we understand each other," Jasper interjected coldly.

He showed no restraint. "Otherwise, Mrs. Marsh, I'd advise keeping your delicate granddaughter home rather than letting her create unnecessary disturbánces. Florrie just regained her vision and needs calm, not drama."

Ady replied angrily, "How dare you? Aurora fainted because of your family, and you're blaming her instead?"

Jasper remained unfazed by her seniority.

"You know better than anyone if Aurora truly fainted or not. I'd have stayed silent, but if she insists on spreading false engagement rumors involving me, I'll clarify the matter myself. Please remind her-I choose who I marry,not her."

"How dare you!" A crash echoed through the phone as Ady presumably shattered something in anger. "You disrespectful brat! Even your father wouldn't dare speak to me this way-"

"My father is tolerant; unfortunately, I am not." A cold intensity radiated from Jasper. "Keep Aurora under control, or I'll ensure she regrets it deeply."

"You wouldn't dare!" Ady's voice strained with fury.

"Aurora is merely adopted. Would the Marsh family risk alienating the Russells over someone who isn't even blood-related? Is it worth the price?"

Jasper ended the call decisively, leaving Florrie in utter awe.

Across Ireah, who dared disrespect Ady openly? Only Jasper possessed the audacity to confront her without hesitation!

"Have you seen Evelina?" Jasper attempted calling her, only to find her line consistently busy, deepening his concern.
###Chapter 59 Three Conditions


"It looks like Margot is still in custody, so Evelina went to the police station to sort things out," Florrie quickly explained when she noticed Jasper's anxious expression.

"Caleb went with her, didn't he? There shouldn't be any issues," she added reassuringly.

"That's unlikely. Caleb headed off to apologize to Aurora-I saw him myself. Evelina must have gone alone."Jasper's unease intensified.

After instructing lan to accompany Florrie back to Morningstar Villas, Jasper hurried straight tothe police station.

"Miss Marsh was here." The officer informed Jasper. "But she left almost immediately after arriving."

Concerned, Jasper asked urgently, "Where did she go after that?"

"She didn't leave any details," the officer replied apologetically.

Frustration welled up in Jasper until one of his bodyguards reminded him, saying, "Mr. Russell, Miss Marsh has been driving our'vehicles lately. They all have GPS trackers installed."

With Kristina and Jasper owning multiple cars, Evelina never saw the need to get her own. She just drove whichever one was free at the time.

Jasper glanced at his phone and saw that Evelina was definitely using one of the Russell family's cars.

What caught his attention, though, was where the car had ended up-

"Petal Creek Orphanage," Jasper murmured, puzzled.

This orphanage held Evelina's childhood memories, but how did Margot's situation connect to it?

Inside the orphanage office, Esme was arrogantly seated in the director's chair, observing smugly as-the elderly director, Kamryn Ramsey, awkwardly tried to please her.
Upon entering, Evelina witnessed Esme aggressively knocking away a cup of hot tea Kamryn was offering,causing the elderly woman to cry out as it scalded her skin.

"You've crossed the line, Esme! That qualifies as assault!" Evelina exclaimed sharply, swiftly attending to Kamryn's burn.

"I'm alright, Evelina." Kamryn quickly assured her, masking her pain. "Miss Barton didn't mean it-please,don't escalate the situation."

Though Evelina wanted justice, Kamryn's pleading eyes made her reluctantly drop it.

Esme now controlled the orphanage land, and if she wished, could displace hundreds of innocent children.

The children's welfare-housing, food, and education-hung by a thread, making Evelina pause before retaliating.

Taking a deep breath, Evelina gently guided Kamryn outside before confronting Esme directly.

"What exactly are you after, Esme?" Evelina slammed her hands onto the desk, glaring fiercely.

Caught off guard by Evelina's intensity, Esme shrank back but quickly masked her fear, saying, "I have three demands!"

"Are you sure you haven't overplayed your hand?" Evelina said coldly.

Esme replied defensively, "I've spent fifty million acquiring the rights to this land for five years! If I wanted,these children could all be out on the streets tomorrow."

The cost had been excessively high for her.

She didn't have much money. A while back, she had requested a ten-million-dollar advance from the Russell family for the surgery, but later, their lawyer had managed to take it back.

She didn't just lose the money-she had to cough up another ten million just to keep them from dragging her to court.

Evelina still held her twenty million surgery payment, leaving Esme desperate.
Selling Starry Night had provided her with a hundred million, and she'd recently handed Cary her last twenty million to help the struggling Gibson Group, only to receive ingratitude in return.

All that remained was the leverage provided by the orphanage's land rights.

Now, Esme was determined to use this leverage to reclaim her losses from Evelina.

"You really think you can use this orphanage against me? I've survived independently since I was sixteen.
These children have no personal connection to me," Evelina said confidently, wearing a cold smile.

Panic flashed through Esme.

If Evelina didn't actually care about the orphanage, then that fifty million would go straight down the drain!

Just as panic started creeping in, Esme heard a voice crackle through the hidden earpiece-Aurora's personal assistant.

The device had been tucked into her ear earlier, just in case.

Having suffered humiliation at Evelina's hands before, Esme had wisely enlisted powerful assistance.

With renewed confidence, she retorted sharply, "If you genuinely didn't care, you wouldn't have rushed here so desperately after one call. Your biggest flaw has always been your kindness!"
###Chapter 60 The Showdown Between Three Women


Evelina stood silently, her eyes sharp as daggers fixed upon Esme, radiating dominance without uttering a single word.

Under Evelina's intense scrutiny, Esme sat rigidly, barely daring to breathe, her knuckles pale from gripping the chair's armrests.

A heavy, oppressive silence lingered, thickening the tension in the air..

Esme finally cracked, her forehead glistening with nervous sweat. Unable to withstand the pressure any longer,she shifted uneasily.

"Well, get on with it-what are your three demands?" Evelina demanded, slicing through the silence.

Aurora's assistant had guessed correctly: Evelina's compassion was her greatest vulnerability, and she wouldn't forsake hundreds of innocent orphans.

"It didn't have to be this difficult," Esme said smugly, believing she'd finally gained the upper hand.

Evelina leaned closer, eyes glittering dangerously. "If you dare push this too far, Esme, that fifty million you invested will evaporate. And believe me, the Russell family won't hesitate to make your life miserable."

Though Evelina chose compromise, her threat was far from empty. She held enough influence to make Esme regret her actions deeply.

"Quit trying to intimidate me!" Esme spat, her voice shaking despite her defiant stance.

"I'm not bluffing. I pushed Aurora so hard she passed out, and the Marsh family still can't touch me-because I've got the Russell famnily behind me."

There was no way Esme had suddenly grown a backbone and a sharp mind overnight.

She'd clearly found a weak spot in the orphanage and used it well, which meant someone powerful had to be pulling the strings.
Only Aurora had the money and influence to go head-to-head with Evelina. Everything Evelina said was meant to push Esme, to see how she'd react.

Esme stumbled, failing Evelina's test spectacularly. "You're deluded! Ms. Marsh is engaged to Jasper Russell. If you upset her, the Russell family will crush you!"

But then, Esme paled considerably. Clearly, if the Russell family had intended to crush Evelina, the woman wouldn't be standing confidently before her.

Evelina scoffed at Esme's foolishness, "Did Aurora feed you that line? You've been tricked."

Esme's thoughts were a whirlwind, yet she managed to steady herself.

Regardless of whether Aurora had deceived her, Esme knew she had to maintain her stance.

"Firstly, repairing my relationship with Cary is essential. Thus, it's crucial that I be the one to save Margot."

Esme aimed to claim the credit for rescuing Margot, although the real effort would have to come from Evelina.

"Alright," Evelina answered, hoping Cary and Esme would keep their problems to themselves and not bother others.

"Secondly, I require that the Russell family fully absolve me of my deceit and not implicate the Gibson family."

Evelina paused before reluctantly saying, "Alright."

She considered Demi's advancing age and preferred not to burden her with the Gibson family's issues.

"Thirdly, I refuse to make a public apology at Landen's grave."

"That's out of the question!" Evelina interjected before she could continue.

"I'll provide you with a list of those impersonating you; isn't that sufficient? If you're that bored, chase them down!" Esme retorted in exasperation.

"I don't need your list to locate them. Both they and you will face consequences. That's final!" Evelina said firmly, making it clear there was no room for negotiation.

Esme had no other options left, so she replied, "Okay, I'Il apologize in private, but I won't go public in front of the media."

Evelina was resolute. "No, that's not acceptable. We can't negotiate on this. Incompetent doctors cause harm,and those who fake their credentials must face public consequJences."

"Why do you have to be so difficult?" Esme exclaimed.

Esme then adjusted her demand. "I secured the land rights for fifty million. You'll need to buy them back from me for one hundred million."

She added shamelessly, "Including the twenty million you took from me before, that makes one hundred and twenty million in total. Pay up!"

Was this just about the money?

Evelina, who had never entered a bad deal except during her brief marriage, wasn't bothered.

"Alright," Evelina responded. "You'll handle Cary's twenty million surgery fees. Plus, I'll sell you the video of you faking surgery for fifty million. Sounds fair,right?"

In the end, Evelina would only need to pay Esme fifty million, rendering her an ineffective broker who made no profit.

Seething with rage, Esme picked up a thermos from the desk and hurled it at Evelina.

Evelina caught the thermos with ease and unscrewed the cap, dousing Esme's hand with the hot water from within.

Esme screamed in pain, "Ah! It burns!"

Calmly replacing the thermos on the desk, Evelina's face was stern. "You need to settle your debt with Kamryn."

While the water wasn't as hot as what Esme had inflicted on Kamryn, pride prevented Esme from admitting it.

Reconsidering her stance, Esme said angrily, "Forget ourdeal. I'm evicting all the orphans immediately!"
###Chapter 61 ls This Mr. Russell Your New Boyfriend
Esme left the director's office in a rage.


When she was about to exit, the door burst open from the other side.



A cold, imposing air swept through the doorwNay,instantly quelling her rage.


Her eyes met Jasper's, who stood framed by his vigilant bodyguards.


"Who do you intend to dismiss?" Jasper demanded,his presence making Esme involuntarily step back in fear.


His voice softened significantly when he addressed Evelina."Are you alright? Is everything okay?"


Evelina, reassuring him with a nod, inquired, "What brought you here?" Jasper offered only a smile in response.



Evelina immediately understood Jasper's reasons for appearing;he was worried about her.



Her bright smile dissipated his concern,transforming his anxious expression into one of relief.



Meanwhile, Esme was forcibly escorted away by the bodyguards of the Russell family.


Although she had shown bravado in front of Evelina,in Jasper's presence, her confidence dissolved into sheer terror.



Not long after, Kamryn arrived with the lease transfer documents in hand. Without hesitation, Esme signed them, her hand shaking slightly.


Evelina completed the transaction, ensuring the lease rights for Petal Creek Orphanage were securely under her control.


Kamryn eagerly took the documents to finalize all related procedures. In Jasper's intimidating presence, Esme hesitantly reminded Evelina. "Ms. Marsh, please remember your promise to me!"


"1 never break my promises." Evelina assured her calmly.


Evelina was committed to honoring the three conditions Esme had set, though she gave Esme a stern warning, "Make sure you lead an honest life from now on. If you attempt any manipulations against me, I'll confront you about past and future issues."



Esme, visibly scared, nodded her head vigorously in agreement.


However, Jasper's suspicion was not appeased."Who put you up to targeting the orphanage?" he asked.


"Mr. Russell, if I reveal everything, will you let me go?"




 
Esme had just hastily ended a call with Aurora's personal assistant when Jasper arrived.


Jasper disliked negotiating and, with a stern look,said,"Talk now!"


Esme nearly collapsed in fear, her legs buckling as she hastily named Aurora's personal assistant.


Evelina, caught off guard, asked, "It was not Aurora herself?"



Esme pleaded earnestly, "Iswear on everything, it wasn't her. I wouldn't lie to you about this."


She quickly showed Evelina the call log on her phone as proof.


"All the details about the orphanage came from that assistant.I assure you, Aurora was not involved."


Esme believed if Aurora had directly intervened, she wouldn't have been put at such risk.


Convinced they had all the information, Evelina nodded to Jasper, signaling it was okay/ to release Esme. "But can we be certain Aurora didn't orchestrate this through her assistant?" Evelina still doubted Aurora's innocence and shared her suspicions openly with Jasper.


Jasper was pleased that Evelina trusted him enough to share her doubts.



He said, "I've looked into Margot's situation. She was kept in custody because she assaulted someone,provoked by someone paid by Aurora's assistant."


The clues consistently led back to the assistant.


"Evelina, trust that I will resolve this matter thoroughly." Jasper assured her with a firm promise.


No one would dare challenge Evelina or threaten those dear to her as long as Jasper was by her side.


A comforting warmth spread through Evelina as she gazed at the man beside her, the impulse to rely on him growing stronger.


"Thanks for everything today. The kids have put together a little show to express their gratitude." Kamryn appeared, full of excitement, leading them down to the playground.


Evelina blushed slightly. "Oh, Kamryn, that's really not necessary. This place is like home to me; I'll always protect it."


Jasper chimed in, "No need for formalities. I consider Evelina's concerns as my own."


With a warm smile, Kamryn paused before adding,"Evelina, I heard about your divorce. I was concerned it might weigh on you, but it looks like my fears were unfounded."


Her laughter filled the air. "So,is this Mr. Russell your new boyfriend?"
###Chapter 62 Do You Know How To Hold A Child
Jasper's smile broadened, amused by the misinterpretation.


Evelina felt a twinge of concern that Jasper might be offended and quickly set things straight. "Oh,Kamryn, that's not quite right-"


"But I'm seeing it with my own eyes!" Kamryn interjected with a hearty laugh, patting Evelina's hand reassuringly.


"You know, your ex never set foot here in all those years you were married, just showing his lack of care.But look at Mr. Russell-solving such big problems on his very first visit. That's the mark of a true gentleman!"



Kamryn gazed at Evelina intenly. "Take this chance,really."  Evelina tried to speak up but found it difficult to articulate the complexities of her situation.


Why bother explaining personal matters to everyone?


Observing Jasper's silence, she opted to stay quiet as well.


Always quick to lend a hand, Kamryn praised Jasper while Evelina was nearby, then made her way over to him to sing Evelina's praises too.


"Mr. Russell, perhaps you don't realize just how remarkable Evelina is. She was always the most level-headed kid around here. Even after she left,she's never forgotten us. She's always sending help,often the first to step up whenever the kids need something..."



Jasper was keen to learn about Evelina's early years,absorbing every detail Kamryn shared.


He had never been a part of that ###Chapter of her life,and it fascinated him.



His heart ached as he contemplated the hardships of young girl growing up without parents.


Evelina's resolve to defend the orphanage now made perfect sense to him. In each child she helped, he saw echoes of her own past struggles.


As Evelina appeared, the children swarmed around her with excitement.



Opening her arms wide, Evelina welcomed them into a warm embrace.



She affectionately tousled Susie's hair. "Your braids are so pretty today, Susie. Did Kamryn do them?"


Evelina then turned to Hans, giving his arm a gentle squeeze. "Look at you, Hans! You're becoming so strong!"



Next, she lifted four-year-old Minnie, showering her with kisses. "Did you miss me,Minnie?"



She knew every child's name and showed genuine concern for their welfare.


Unsurprisingly, the children revered her, seeing her part of their family.


Kamryn,watching this, said to Jasper, "Minnie was born with a heart defect. Abandoned as an infant,many said she wouldn't make it. But Evelina wouldn't accept that. She enlisted top cardiac specialists,sparing no effort to ensure Minnie's survival."



Kamryn looked at Jasper with hopeful eyes, her voice trembling slightly. "Mr. Russell, Evelina has faced many hardships. Love her well, if you truly care for her."



Despite her belief in Jasper's character, Kamryn couldn't help but worry, fearing another heartbreak for Evelina similar to what she experienced with Cary.



Evelina was such a treasure, deserving of the finest love one could offer.



"Don't worry. I've got her." The more Jasper uncovered about Evelina, the deeper his feelings grew-and all he wanted was to keep her safe,always.
Kamryn, visibly relieved, wiped away a tear and beamed. "Now, children, didn't you prepare something special for Evelina today? Who's ready to perform?"


Hans, brimming with enthusiasm, shouted, "I am!Watch my dance!"


"Let's see it, Hans!" Kamryn gestured for the other children to give Hans space to perform.


Hans danced with surprising grace, demonstrating his natural talent.



Meanwhile, Jasper approached Evelina, gently taking Minnie from her. "Let me hold her for a bit. You must be tired."



Evelina looked at him skeptically. "Do you even know how to hold a child properly?


"Florrie was just as small when I used to hold her."


Minnie seemed to take an instant liking to him, even planting a playful kiss on his cheek while he was momentarily distracted by Evelina.Her laughterfilled the air, infectious and joyful.


Jasper, caught off guard, could only smile at her antics. Evelina chuckled. "Minnie's got quite the spirit."


Just then, a voice called out, "Evelina-"


As Evelina turned to see who it was, an unexpected attack came her way: a large bag of white powder aimed directly at her face!
###Chapter 63 Evelina Is Injured





Evelina's immediate reaction was to cover her eyes,simultaneously protecting Minnie and Jasper with her other arm.



Amidst her agony, which came with a sharp burning sensation, she warned everyone, "Be careful! It's quicklime!"


"Evelina!" Jasper sprang into action, his voice filled with concern. "Are you alright?"


Startled by the consequences of his actions, the boy who had thrown the lime broke down crying.Simultaneously, Minnie's cries echoed loudly, adding to the chaos.



A caregiver swiftly took Minnie to safety, while Jasper instructed the bodyguards, "Catch that boy don't let him escape."


The situation might have been worse if the boy were Kamryn, seeing the commotion, said, "Please, don't panic. Return to your classrooms." She then approached Evelina to assess her condition.



Realizing her eyes were compromised by the lime,Kamryn called out desperately, "Someone bring purified water quickly!"


"First, bring me some vegetable oil," Evelina interjected, despite her pain. "I need to use it to get most of the quicklime out of my eyes before rinsing them with purified water."


Kamryn immediately dashed towards the kitchen."I'll get it immediately!"


"Evelina-" Jasper's voice betrayed his panic.


"Jasper, stay calm!" Evelina urged as she grasped his sleeve, her hand shaking yet her voice steady."There are cotton swabs in my bag. Please use themn to clear as much lime as you can from my eyes. Also, my phone is there; call Dorothea. I'Il explain so she can get things ready at the hospital."


"Understood," Jasper responded, meticulously following Evelina's directions.


While handling the cotton swabs, his hands shook slightly- he knew this task was too delicate to entrust to anyone else.


Concerned that the bodyguards might be too harsh,he pondered the consequences of their potential clumsiness.



Jasper steadied his nerves; knowing Evelina depended solely on him in this moment, he had to ensure his hands were as stable as when he held a firearm.



His precise and gentle efforts succeeded in removing much of the lime from her eyes.


Kamryn arrived shortly with the vegetable oil.Following Evelina's detailed instructions, they dripped a few drops of oil into her eyes and used cotton swabs to remove the quicklime. Then they rinsed her eyes thoroughly with purified water.


Without delay, Jasper whisked her off to the hospital,navigating the streets that were miraculously clear of any traffic.


Evelina would later find out that Jasper had ensured an open route by promising a substantial investment to the local traffic authority.


Upon arrival at the hospital, they found Dorothea and the rest of Evelina's surgical team fully prepared and waiting.


Evelina was rushed directly to the operating room upon her arrival at the hospital.


Thanks to the swift first aid and her rapid transport,the quicklime damage was limited to superficial eye tissue, sparing her deeper ocular structures.


Dorothea emerged shortly after the procedure to update Jasper, who had been anxiously waiting outside. "She'll need about a week of hospital care,but Evelina's eyes should heal fully. There's no need for excessive worry."


Jasper's relief was short-lived as Caleb stormed in and landed a punch on his jaw.


"How could you let this happen if you're always at her side? Weren't you supposed to protect her?"Caleb's voice was thick with blame as he seized Jasper by the collar, eyes burning with anger.


The Russell family's bodyguards started to intervene,but Jasper waved them off.


Matching Caleb's aggression, Jasper struck back,catching him in the mouth and drawing blood.


"Throwing punches is easy, but where were you when Evelina needed protection?" Caleb taunted,wiping the blood from his lip, gearing up for another round.



Just then, Florrie rushed in, shouting, "Stop this right now! Don't you dare hit my uncle Jasper!"


Florrie, at just nineteen, displayed remarkable sharpness. "It's distressing that Evelina was hurt, but right now, we need to focus on her recovery and uncover who orchestrated this attack."


She and lan had hurried to the hospital immediately after learning of the incident, discussing the details on the way.


"lan and I gathered some information on the way here," Florrie continued. "Kamryn interrogated the boy responsible for the lime incident. The boy believed he had purchased a harmless powder for magic tricks, hoping to surprise Evelina with a performance. At only thirteen and known for his good nature, it's clear he was misled into using harmful materials."



Florrie laid out the sequence of events with concern,saying, "Consider the connections here- from Evelina's solo trip to the orphanage, to her involvement in the land dispute at the orphanage, to the attack with lime powder. The orchestration behind these events indicates a cold level of calculation.



We're fortunate Uncle Jasper was there to mitigate the harm. If not, Evelina's condition could have been as dire as my own past injuries."
###Chapter 64 Going To Aurora To Settle The Score
Florrie concluded her explanation, and Dorothea immediately backed it up, highlighting the importance of Jasper's timely intervention. "Without Mr. Russell's quick response, the prolonged exposure to the lime might have led to irreversible damage to Evelina's vision."


Caleb appeared completely drained, leaning heavily against the wall in defeat.


He began to cry, overwhelmed by guilt, and slapped himself in despair. "This is all my fault...


Seeing his distress, Florrie and lan quickly came to help, each taking one of his hands. Florrie reassured him gently. "This isn't your fault. These things were beyond our control."


Concerned he might do more harm to himself, she added, "Evelina would be heartbroken to see you like this."


lan agreed and shifted their focus. "Let's concentrate on uncovering who's really behind this and ensure they are held accountable."


Caleb bitterly mentioned Aurora, blaming her for the circumstances that led to Evelina being alone. "If it weren't for her, Evelina wouldn't have been out there alone."



lan linked the incidents back to Aurora, saying, "The disputes over the orphanage land and the issues with Margot also lead back to her."


With all signs pointing to Aurora, it was hard to see it as mere coincidence. She was now the main suspect.



"Evelina's coming out," Dorothea said, giving a quiet reminder as everyone quickly gathered, their faces filled with concern.



Evelina was slowly wheeled out on a stretcher,visibly groggy from the anesthesia, her quiet presence drawing everyone's attention.


Jasper watched over Evelina with a furrowed brow,noticing her eyes remained shut. Florrie, with concern washing over her face, gently called out to her.



They moved Evelina carefully into a hospital room.


"Florrie, stay here with her and make sure she's not left alone," Jasper instructed, ensuring Dorothea was also attentive. "Dorothea, look after her well."


Turning to lan, he instructed, "Head to the orphanage and investigate the source of that powder switch."


He was confident that the culprit was still lurking around Petal Creek Orphanage, guarded by two of his bodyguards.


"I'll handle it, Mr. Russell." lan assured him promptly.


Jasper then addressed Caleb, who was visibly distressed by Evelina's condition. "Caleb, come with me.We need to deal with Aurora now." It was clear that all trails led to Aurora, and it was time they sought some direct answers from her.


"Let's go!" Encouraged by Jasper's initiative, Caleb brushed away his tears and followed Jasper determinedly to where Aurora was recovering.


Aurora's personal bodyguard sensed Jasper's forceful approach and tried to prevent any escalation by moving to inform Aurora. However, he was swiftly restrained by Jasper's own guards before he could alert her.



Just as Caleb made a move to enter, he halted at the sound of Aurora's voice, outraged. "What did you just say? How could you be so harmful?" she said to someone.


Jasper subtly restrained Caleb, signaling him to hold off.


Inside,they heard Aurora's assistant confess through shaky sobs, saying, "I'm sorry, Miss Marsh. It wasn't my intention to harm Evelina directly. It just upset me to see her close to Mr. Russell, and I thought a scare might shift the balance."


Aurora responded sharply, "You've gone too far!Jasper's feelings for me are non-existent, why involve Evelina? She's not the reason Jasper won't marry me. Now, be honest-did Grandma tell you to go after her?"


Her voice broke into a weak cough, illustrating her fragile state.


The assistant, overwhelmed by guilt and fear, broke down. "Please, Miss Marsh, forgive me. I realize the error of my ways, and it won't happen again-"


"Will you get another chance? You've already gone too far, isn't that obvious?"


Aurora, infuriated, halted her words to manage a cough, then replied deliberately, "You need to admit your actions to Jasper. And I... I will make an apology to Evelina on your behalf..."


"No, Miss Marsh! If Mr. Russell learns I hurt Evelina,my life will be over. After all these years by your side, please show some compassion-"


The assistant's plea was cut short as Caleb, filled with rage, stormed into the room.


"It was your doing, Aurora! Your assistant hurt Evelina. I overheard everything. What more can you say now? You despicable person!"
###Chapter 65 Loving You Was My Biggest Mistake
Caleb's sudden appearance startled Aurora, her face betraying a flash of disappointment.


Was Jasper not coming after all?


She and her assistant had orchestrated this scene,hoping to convince Jasper of her innocence in the attack on Evelina. She feared that without his belief, Jasper would never forgive her.



Aurora, with the theatricality honed over the years within the Marsh family, faced Caleb's accusations in silence.



Leaning weakly against the bedpost, she occasionally coughed and tears rolled down her cheeks without a sound. Beside her, the kneeling assistant was desperate to keep their planned deception from unraveling.


She quickly grabbed Caleb's sleeve, crying.She said,"Mr. Quinn, please, the fault is mine alone. I acted without Miss Marsh's knowledge. Blame me, and me alone, just please don't turn me over to Mr. Russell..."


"So, you're terrified of me, yet you still chose to strike at someone under the protection of the Russell family?" Jasper entered, pinpointing the contradiction in her plea.


At his words, the assistant shook with genuine fear.


Caught off-guard, she momentarily forgot the lines she had rehearsed.



Aurora said, "You need to face Jasper and accept responsibility for your actions. I'm not covering for you."


Aurora's words made the assistant regain some poise.




Still, the assistant's voice shook as she said, "I admit, it was my doing. I thought a minor scare for Evelina wouldn't draw attention. I didn't foresee such severe consequences..."


Jasper was quickly losing his temper with the excuses.




His only concern was clear. "Tell me, who put you up to this?"


"No one instructed me!" The assistant's voice was firm,her demeanor fraught with fear.


Jasper sensed her resistance to the truth. He signaled someone off to the side. "Give her a taste of her own medicine."



At his command, a formidable bodyguard from the Russell family stepped inside.


The assistant, now visibly shaken, clutched at Aurora's gown. "Please, Miss Marsh, protect me!"


Caleb, witnessing the scene, directed his fury towards Aurora. "So it was your doing! What else do you have to say for yourself?" Aurora, seeming resigned, merely said, "I... have nothing to say." There was not a trace of guilt or unease on her face.


Caleb was taken aback by this development.


Was it possible they had accused the wrong person?He glanced at Jasper, searching for clues in his demeanor.


The bodyguard attempted to detain the assistant,who resisted fiercely, clinging to Aurora.


Aurora's voice cut through the tension, exclaiming,"Enough!"


She stooped to her assistant's level, her tone stern yet protective. "You must own up to your actions. It's time to tell Jasper everything."


The assistant wavered, then firmly shook her head."No, Miss Marsh, I can't reveal it. My family will suffer if I do..."


In a moment of desperation, she wrenched herself free from the bodyguard and charged towards the  room's cabinet.



Her head collided with its sharp edge, and she collapsed as blood began to pour from the wound.


Aurora was horrified. "What have you done? Why would you do this?"


Frantically, she grabbed a cloth and pressed it against the assistant's head to stem the bleeding,crying out for help. "Doctor! We need a doctor here immediately!"


Aurora called out repeatedly without a response,then pleaded with Jasper, "Jasper, please,help her.We can sort everything else out later, just save her first."



Jasper's expression remained stoic.


In a burst of desperation, Aurora shouted, "It was me,I ordered her to do it! I'll make it right with Evelina,just save her now!"


With a nod from Jasper, the bodyguard stepped aside, allowing a doctor to rush in and attend to the at most assistant.


As the assistant was being carried away, her grasp loosened, dropping a pink hairpin.


Aurora snatched it up, holding it delicately. "This belongs to her sister. They lost their parents, and she's all she has left." Meanwhile, Jasper was already on the phone,instructing his family's investigators in lreah to look into the assistant's sister's situation.



Returning to the room, he found Aurora slumped by the bed, her gaze lost on the bloodied cabinet."Jasper, loving you was my biggest mistake..."
###Chapter 66 Death Of The Assistant





"If my feelings for you hadn't clouded my judgment,I wouldn't have been envious of Evelina. That envy led my assistant to make a reckless decision."


Tears marked her cheeks as she said, "The world is full of decent men, not just in Ireah. Why did I fixate on you? If my assistant suffers, what becomes of her young sister? She's just a child. How will she cope without her?"


After Jasper exited, Caleb remained vigilant, keeping a watchful eye on Aurora to ensure she didn't stir up further issues.



Yet, she just sat there, lost in her despair, making no further moves.



Caleb's heart softened slightly towards her. Aurora had always been a master of pretense, yet she lacked the cold ruthlessness of Ady. "Stop your tears," Caleb said as he extended a handful of tissues to her.



When she ignored the gesture, he pressed the tissues into her hands forcefully. "You're a Marsh.Shouldn't you at least try to maintain your dignity?"


"Is maintaining appearances going to bring her back?" Aurora replied, her voice cracking, followed by a coughing fit.


She took a moment to compose herself. "She made a mistake, but did she deserve such a harsh fate? Why did you have to press her so relentlessly?"



"Aurora, you shouldn't have been dragged into this mess. I regret that it reached this point," Jasper said.


He was taken aback by Aurora's disheveled appearance. It was a stark contrast from the meticulous image she always maintained, and it stirred a pang of pity in him.



"You've done nothing wrong, Jasper. Wat could I possibly hold against you? I know it was just your deep concern for Evelina that made you lose your calm," Aurora said, her voice tinged with a mix of resignation and a lingering hope that Jasper might contradict her words.


However, Jasper said nothing, his silence serving as an admission to his feelings for Evelina.

   




"Are you saying she's innocent?" Caleb's surprise was evident, his previous understanding flipped.


"The control over the assistant's sister doesn't lie with her." Jasper relayed the findings from the Russell family's thorough investigation. They were known for their accuracy and wouldn't be wrong on such a critical matter.


Realization dawned on Caleb at once.


If Aurora wasn't the one manipulating events, then the true manipulator had to be Ady.


The realization that the assistant would rather face death than expose Ady suggested the terrifying extent of Ady's influence.


"Aurora, we're doing everything possible to save your assistant, and I believe she will survive.However,her actions were grave, and they cannot be overlooked."


Jasper never left room for debate when it came to protecting the people he cared about.


Aurora understood he wasn't asking-he was telling her.


Still, she kept pleading, hoping he'd bend the rules for her just this once.


"Jasper, I will personally apologize to Evelina. From here on, I assure you, my regard for you will be strictly platonic. Please, would you consider sparing her? Her little sister depends solely on her; the little girl cannot afford to be without a guardian."


Jasper's denial came swiftly, answering, "No." He was resolute.


Despair washed over Aurora instantly, a feeling of finality that seemed to crush any remaining hope.
Jasper's tone then shifted slightly, more gentle and assured. "However, I assure you that once her sentence is served, she will be in a position to resume her responsibilities to her sister."


From the start, Jasper had only intended to issue a stern warning to the manipulator behind the scenes.


Hope flickered in Aurora's eyes as she suddenly brighten up. "Jasper, I believe in you. Thank you!"


Her words of gratitude were abruptly interrupted by a nurse who burst into the room, shouting, "Terrible news! Ms. Marsh, I'm sorry, but your assistant didn't make it."



"What?" Shock contorted Aurora's face as she demanded an explanation, asking, "How is that possible? She was perfectly healthy; how could she just die?"


"The assistant suffered from undiagnosed hypertension and other hidden ailments.Unfortunately, attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful."
The nurse, visibly saddened and still young, tried to offer some consolation to Aurora. "I'm truly sorry for your loss, Ms. Marsh."


Overwhelmed by the news, Aurora's body gave way,and she fainted, collapsing onto the floor.


Jasper and Caleb, caught off guard, glanced at each other, each hesitating, mistakenly thinking the other would react to catch her.



Caleb eventually lifted Aurora from the floor and gently laid her on the bed.


Immediately, the nurse called a doctor.


Under Jasper's watchful eye, the doctor delivered a straightforward diagnosis. "Ms. Marsh has collapsed from acute stress, but she should recover fully with some rest."



Caleb observed wryly. "She's faked fainting before,but this time it's genuine."


While he felt a pang of sympathy, he also thought Aurora was merely reaping what she had sown. As the situation grew more complex, Caleb turned to Jasper and voiced his concern, saying, "Now that Aurora has genuinely fainted and someone has died,what's our next step?"
###Chapter 67 Not The Type To Get Soft Over Anyone
Jasper decisively declared his intention to handle the situation. "Keep Evelina out of this; she mustn't learn about the assistant's death."



Knowing Evelina's compassionate nature, he understood that the news would devastate her. The thought of her bearing such guilt was unbearable for him, prompting his strict orders for discretion.


All who were present nodded in agreement,promising to maintain silence on the matter.


Jasper then cast a meaningful look at Caleb, who immediately protested, "Hey, what's that look for?|know how to keep quiet!"


"You're the one I worry about most," Jasper lightly scolded.



Feeling somewhat punished yet unable to retaliate, Caleb grumbled as he exited Aurora's room. On his way out, he decided to warn his three cousins from the Marsh family.


It appeared to some that the assistant's death might close this ###Chapter.


However, Caleb knew Jasper well enough to understand that the issue with Ady was far from resolved. He informed the cousins not out of courtesy, but to prepare them for Jasper's inevitable actions.



This was particularly important given their recent anger towards Ady for her harsh treatment of their mother.


Caleb was taken aback by his cousins' reactions.


"Don't get it twisted, Caleb. Mr. Russell is a cold and calculating man, not the type to get soft over anyone," one cousin skeptically said.



They scoffed at the idea that Jasper would go to such lengths for a woman who had already been through a marriage.



Who would believe that?



Yet, the unfolding events soon challenged their disbelief.


lan visited Petal Creek Orphanage and efficiently uncovered the teacher responsible for the magic powder switch. With Kamryn's unwavering assistance, they secured a confession.


The teacher admitted he had been bribed by Aurora's assistant, supporting his statemnent with bank records.



lan diligently captured the confession on video and gathered all pertinent evidence,forwarding it directly to the Marsh family.



Jasper's stance was simple-Evelina deserved justice.





While the Marsh brothers braced themselves,Franklin and Ady were caught off guard.  Ady was quick to dismiss the allegations. "Absurd!I've never ordered anyone to harm that girl."


However,Franklin,standing by his ethical principles,refused to defend his mother against these serious charges.


He said, "You manipulated Aurora's assistant by threatening her sister, leading her to corrupt the orphanage teacher. That teacher then tampered with the boy's magic powder, resulting in Evelina's accident. Jasper has documented proof linking each of these actions. The evidence is conclusive. How can you deny it?"


He then added bluntly, "It must be you or Aurora. If Aurora orchestrated this, she will face grave consequences."


Ady, furious, lifted her cane at her eldest son. "Have you forgotten whose son you are? How dare you accuse your mother?"


Franklin did not flinch as the cane hovered above him. "Strike if you must, but afterward, you must assume responsibility. Evelina is known as the Sight Weaver. Caleb once mentioned inviting her to treat Vivienne's eyes. I was worried about her skills and didn't agree, but now she's cured Florrie's eyes.Despite my initial doubts about her, her skills are undeniable."



Franklin had been about to discuss inviting Evelina to treat Vivienne's eyes when the incident occurred.So his frustration was understandable.


But Ady, overcome with rage, struck Franklin on the shoulder with her cane. "Are you implying that I orchestrated Evelina's blinding to prevent her from treating Vivienne? I must assume responsibility?Even after Jasper's actions led to Aurora's assistant's demise, I haven't pursued that issue!"


Franklin had grown used to his mother's explosive temper.


Standing his ground, he said, "The death of the assistant was tragic but unintentional. Her involvement in a harmful scheme led Jasper to her.I'll see to her funeral arrangements and ensure that Aurora takes in her sister."


Ady's anger flared again. "Have you lost your senses? Aurora isn't even wed, and now you propose she raise a child?"


Franklin's expression hardened. "Tell me, did Aurora know about the threats you made to her assistant? If not, then on whose behalf were you targeting Evelina?"



Ady was beside herself with rage, struggling to form words. "You despise Aurora's closeness to me, don't you? This is revenge for the remarks I made about your wife! Aurora might not be my flesh and blood,but she has been a part of our family for over two decades. Isn't that akin to being my own granddaughter? Why can't you and Vivienne show her some affection? It's not her fault that Jazmine is gone-"



"Mother!" Franklin's loud interruption cut through the room,causing Ady to pause.


He directed her attention with his gaze, and Ady spun around, her breath catching at the sight of Vivienne's weary face.
###Chapter 68 Aurora, Let Go!





"Stop hiding now, Jazmine. Mommy can't seem to find you!"


Dressed only in a delicate nightgown and barefooted,Vivienne was a sight of distress in the large living room.



With tears rolling down her cheeks, she pleaded,"Jazmine, where are you, darling? Mommy really needs you to come out now..."


"Vivienne!" Franklin swiftly approached, wrapping her gently in a warm blanket.


Vivienne said, "Dear, our daughter is missing. She's been taken by someone. Shh-" Vivienne pressed a finger to her lips. "Do you hear that? She's crying,she won't stop!"


Overcome with guilt, she sobbed. "This is all my fault. I should've kept her close!"
Tormented, she continued, "They must have hidden her somewhere dark and cold. She's too small, she might not survive. We have to find her, we must find her right away!"


Vivienne grabbed Franklin's hand, pleading with him to help her look.


They had no other option.


Franklin instructed the servants to fetch a doll, a perfect imitation of young Jazmine, and handed.it to Vivienne.


This doll wore Jazmine's old clothes and carried her scent, which Vivienne instantly recognized.


With great joy, Vivienne embraced the doll,pressing it close to her. "Jazmine, my sweet girl, Mommy's bringing you home now..."


Franklin's focus remained on caring for his sick wife,leaving no room to contend with his mother.


Vivienne's life had been marred by profound guilt and grief since Jazmine vanished.
Plagued by sleepless nights and severe depression,she eventually suffered a breakdown. Though treatment brought some improvement, she still struggled.


On days like Jazmine's birthday or the anniversary of her disappearance, mentioning her name could trigger Vivienne into a desperate search for her daughter, as if reliving the tragedy again.


"This happens every year, like a relentless curse."


As Franklin escorted Vivienne upstairs to rest, Ady watched with a sharp gaze, thumping her cane in irritation before she departed.


She chose solitude, living away from her family in the vast Marsh estate.



Before Ady even reached home, she called Aurora,who was still in Aglonard. "What a disaster you've created-it's beyond repair!"


Apologies came quickly from Aurora. "I'm sorry,Grandma. I secreted my assistant's sister in your home..."



Aurora had orchestrated the entire scheme,yet Ady was the one facing the consequences.



Ady wasn't bothered about taking the blame,her focus was solely on the outcome. "Aurora,how often must I remind you? If you're going to take action,ensure your success is guaranteed."


Aurora's impulsive actions included targeting a person under Jasper 's protection without a thorough plan, which inevitably led to her plans unraveling.


"I'm sorry, Grandma," Aurora cried into the phone. "I never imagined Jasper would become so attached to Evelina, who seems so insignificant!"



Aurora, in her desperation, allowed Ady to shoulder the blame and pushed her assistant towards a breakdown.



However, Jasper remained relentless, forwarding all evidence to the Marsh family and seeking accountability for Evelina's ordeal. "Now you're filled with regret, but you should be planning your next move," Ady scolded her for her naivety. "You, don't understand your own position.Even if Jasper shows interest in her, it's merely fleeting. In matters of marriage, family background dictates the terms." After her scolding, Ady offered Aurora some guidance.


Just as Franklin had managed to soothe Vivienne into sleep and was feeling both physically and emotionally spent, Aurora's call came through. He listened as she immediately burst into tears,apologizing and blaming herself for not managing her assistant properly.


Aurora pledged to rectify the situation and to provide financial support for her assistant's sister, ensuring the child would not have to worry about her future.


However, financial support and adoption were two very different commitments. Adoption would mean raising the child as her own daughter, while financial support involved more distant, though supportive, involvement, such as funding her upbringing in a welfare home and visiting occasionally.


Franklin accepted Aurora's proposal for financial support. Given her status as an unmarried woman,taking in a child wouldn't be practical.


"Aurora, I recognize your thoughtfulness and the challenges you've faced within our family over the years."


Exhausted by his wife's ongoing health issues,Franklin could not delve deeper into the conspiracy.His priority was swiftly resolving the situation and providing Jasper with a satisfactory explanation.


"But you cannot force affection. Jasper isn't the right match for you, Aurora. Let him go. We'll assist you in finding someone more compatible," Franklin said,hoping to steer her toward a happier future.
###Chapter 69 Franklin Apologizes Personally
Aurora clenched her teeth, feeling resentment flood through her. Outsiders might think she lived a charmed life as a respected daughter of the prestigious Marsh family from lreah, but the reality was quite different. Franklin, Vivienne, and their sons had never fully accepted her because she wasn't their biological child.


She was forever overshadowed by the memory of Jazmine, always seen as just the adopted daughter who belonged on the fringes.


Despite enduring numerous slights within the family silently, Aurora's only true desire was to be with Jasper, a hope not supported by her adoptive family.


Consumed by a deep-seated bitterness, she remembered Ady's advice to maintain patience and composure. At the moment, her best strategy was to conform to the role of the compliant daughter, so she quickly agreed with Franklin, "Alright, Dad, I'll listen to your advice."


Having recently caused a significant stir, it was crucial for her to now adopt the guise of a well-behaved daughter. "I realize that you and Mom want only the best for me."


"That's good to hear," Franklin said, feeling reassured of her sincerity.


"Soon, I'll take the assistant's remains back to lreah so her sister can have a final farewell. Also, howis Mom feeling these days?"


While Aurora's question about Vivienne suggested concern,she actually shared Ady's aversion towards her.



Vivienne's continual mourning over her lost daughter and resulting illnesses were a burden Aurora wished the family could finally shed.


"She had a tough time again," Franklin explained with a heavy heart. "When you return, bring Caleb. He seems to calmn her."



It was two hours later when Evelina regained consciousness.


Dorothea was there to check up on her upon waking and, relieved to see Evelina well.


Feeling much better, Evelina urged Dorothea-who'd been running around all day-to head home and get some rest.



Once Dorothea had left, only Florrie remained in the room with Evelina.



"My uncle and lan had to step out, and Mr. Quinn was urgently called-apparently, Mrs. Marsh is having a tough time," Florrie said.



She held Evelina's hand softly, offering solace. "I just spoke with my uncle; he'll be here shortly."


"Thanks so much, Florrie," Evelina responded with a smile.

"Oh, it's the least I can do for you," Florrie replied warmly.


As they continued talking, Florrie unintentionally revealed more. "You know, Mrs. Ady Marsh was apparently worried you might be a rival for my uncle's affections, prompting her to use Aurora's assistant for her schemes. My uncle uncovered all the proof, leaving the Marsh family speechless.Aurora even came by to apologize for her grandmother while you were asleep. I didn't want to disturb you, so l asked her to leave."


Listening in silence, Evelina absorbed the information, her thoughts racing.


Ady had never even seen her face to face. Why was she so intent on smoothing Aurora's way? Evelina remained convinced that it was Aurora who had instructed her assistant to take those actions, not Ady.


"Don't fret, Evelina. My uncle has got your back-"


Florrie's assurance was cut off by the buzz of her  phone. She picked up immediately upon seeing Franklin's name flash across the screen. "Hello? Mr.Marsh, what can I do for you?"


She paused to listen, then turned to Evelina, muffling the phone with her hand. "Evelina, it's Aurora's father. He wishes to speak with you. Should I hand over the phone?"



"Let him speak," Evelina responded, her curiosity piqued about the Marsh family's intentions.



Would they demand she keep her distance from Jasper, or were they calling to confront her on behalf of Ady and Aurora?



"Understood." Florrie sympathized with Evelina's inability to see, so she activated the speakerphone and set it beside the latter's pillow.



"Is this Ms. Marsh?" Franklin's tone came through the speaker, surprisingly gentle for someone known as a formidable figure in lreah, sounding instead like a considerate neighbor. Evelina was taken aback, but she kept her composure. "Hello, Mr. Marsh. This is Evelina."


"I deeply regret this whole situation. The incident was a failing on our part, and I am profoundly sorry for the distress it caused you. I assure you, measures will be taken to prevent such incidents in the future."


Florrie was amazed to hear such a heartfet apology coming directly from Franklin, whom she knew to be both stern and calculating despite his usual polite demeanor.



"Ms. Marsh, I would like to make amends for the trouble we've caused you. Please let me know what you need, and I'll endeavor to meet your demands,"Franklin said earnestly.


Evelina felt a flicker of respect for Franklin's approach but remained cautious.


She asked, "And if my request is to take legal action against the perpetrator, would you support that decision,Mr.Marsh?"
###Chapter 70 The Marsh Family Will Pay The Price
After a brief pause, Franklin's voice returned, initially caught off guard by Evelina's determined tone.


"Indeed, you have every right to seek justice," he quickly replied.


Evelina was considering commending Franklin for his apparent reasonableness compared to Ady and Aurora, but he interjected with a hesitant "However  1



Evelina's expression tightened. "What exactly do you mean by 'however'?"


"During his investigation, Jasper encountered complications. Sadly, Aurora's assistant passed away in the hospital," Franklin explained with caution,hinting that Jasper's aggressive approach to uncovering the truth had led to tragic consequences. This implication meant that pursuing legal action might expose Jasper to liability, given the death involved.



"Mr. Marsh, are you implying that my uncle Jasper caused her death? He is a person with strong principles; he wouId never do something like that!"


Florrie had been quietly keeping to herself, not planning to say a word. But the moment the Marsh family started blaming Jasper, she couldn't stay silent-her face turned red with anger.


Franklin was taken aback to hear Florrie's voice on the call; he hadn't anticipated her presence. He quickly tried to clarify his position. "Florrie, please don't misunderstand my intentions."


Florrie, visibly irritated, dismissed his explanation with a sharp huff.



Evelina, noticing Florrie's agitation, clasped her hand as a sign of solidarity and to calm her down.


She then addressed Franklin, asking, "Mr. Marsh,  what do you suggest we do now?"



Although he picked up on Evelina's underlying tone of skepticism, Franklin knew he had to tread carefully to preserve his family's image and safety. He earnestly suggested, "Ms. Marsh, If you prefer to resolve this matter out of court, please specify your conditions, and I will ensure they are fulfilled."


Evelina nodded. "Fine. Florrie, would you mind recording Mr. Marsh's commitment? I'll specify my demands when I'm ready."


Franklin felt a sense of relief hearing her willingness to negotiate.



Florrie made sure to capture this promise on her phone and sent the recording directly to Evelina for safekeeping.


Still upset, Florrie couldn't hide her disappointment."I can't believe Mr. Marsh would go so far to protect Ady. Jasper has always been just and fair,never trivializing human life." She looked at Evelina with a mix of respect and concern. wondering aloud. "Evelina, are you doing this for Uncle Jasper?"


Evelina offered a comforting smile. "My eye will recover in a week. Suing wouldn't bring grave consequences to Ady anyway. It's better to earn a favor from the Marsh family now, but I'll make sure they pay the price in the future."



Florrie's mood lifted on understanding Evelina's strategy. "Got it, that makes sense."


At that moment, Caleb came to say goodbye to Evelina.



He explained that his aunt was gravely sick, requiring his presence in lreah.



Evelina didn't hold him back. Instead,she subtly sent Florrie on an errand before turning the conversation to a sensitive topic with Caleb. "What really happened to Aurora's assistant?"



Caleb tried to dodge the subject at first, but Evelina  interjected, "You're a lawyer-just stick to the facts."


Reluctantly, Caleb disclosed the true circumstances.


He continued to defend Jasper's role. "It truly wasn't Jasper's fault that the assistant died..."


Evelina listened quietly, well aware from her years in medicine that individuals are drivento despair only in the direst circumstances.



She knew deep down that no one directly involved-herself, Jasper, Ady, or Aurora-was responsible for the ultimate tragedy that befell the assistant.


Their actions, while indirect, contributed to the tragic outcome.



Evelina was sobered by her first encounter with the ruthless dynamics of high society, recognizing the need to maintain a distance from such toxic environments.



Meanwhile, Jasper,alongside lan, was in the midst of critical economic discussions with Aglonard's mayor.
A call from his niece, alerting him that Evelina had regained consciousness, prompted him to return immediately to the hospital.


Yet, upon his arrival, he sensed a coolness in Evelina's demeanor towards him, unsettling him.


Seeking clarity, Jasper discreetly took Florrie aside outside Evelina's room to inquire about any issues.


Florrie, bound by a promise to Evelina not to burden Jasper with additional worries, including the call from Franklin, chose to divert the conversation. "Cary and Margot came under the guise of visiting Evelina but were actually here to taunt her. Margot, fresh out of detention, was particularly troublesome. I managed to rally some support and sent them packing."
###Chapter 71 A Shameful Chapter In Evelina's Life
"Florrie, well done," Jasper said, affectionately patting his niece on the head.


Florrie, beaming with pride, replied, "It's my responsibility to protect Evelina."


Jasper mistook Evelina's cool demeanor for simple distress from her eye injury and the disturbances caused by Cary and his sister.


He quickly made a phone call. "Seems like Cary has too much free time on his hands. Let's find him a distraction."



Subsequently, a string of misfortunes struck the Gibson Group.



Confronted with rising costs from suppliers and downward pressure on prices from clients, the company's finances were nearly breaking.
 Meanwhile, harmful rumors began spreading internally.


Rumors that Cary was ungrateful and disloyal,embroiled in a nasty divorce, dominated the talk,damaging his reputation.


When the news went public, the Gibson Group's stock prices started to free fall.


In his office, Cary asked, "Who's behind these rumors?"


Noticing Esme setting out a homemade meal, he accused her impulsively, saying, "Esme, was this your doing?"


Esme, interrupted while laying out the lunch,froze,her eyes filling with tears.


"Do you really see me that way? Do you think I'd cause problems now, of all times?" she retorted,visibly upset.


Margot, who was assisting, couldn't help but feel compassion for Esme.
Since Margot had been released from detention due to Esme's intervention, she had become fiercely loyal to her, treating her almost like family.


"Cary, have you forgotten already?" Margot asked."Esme was the one who handed you fifty million when the company was struggling."


Margot was right; her words rang with the truth.


To secure her place within the Gibson family,Esme had not only saved Margot but had also drained her savings to pull Cary out of a financial mess.


Reflecting on her sacrifices, Cary's rage cooled."Esme, I apologize. I've been under a lot of pressure.It was wrong of me to snap at you."



"It's okay." Esme simply nodded, her eyes downcast as she discreetly wiped away a tear.


Seeing this, Margot's sympathy deepened. "Cary you've got to see what you're doing to her. Out of al the people in the world, Esme is the one who truly loves you."
She comforted Esme with a gentle pat on the back before turning her anger towards Evelina. "And it's clear who's spreading rumors about your divorce-it's Evelina! She's after your money. Do you really believe she'd let you go without a fight? She's manipulating public perception to force you to show unity. Evelina's tactics are devious and desperate;she'll do anything to maintain her grip on the Gibson fortune!"



Upon hearing Margot's accusations, Cary could no longer contain himself.


He rushed to confront Evelina directly.



That day, Evelina was scheduled to leave the hospital, and her discharge was a joyful occasion.Jasper and Florrie were organizing a welcome back celebration at Morningstar Villas, and Kristina had flown back from lreah to manage the formalities.



Evelina, cherished by those around her, was about to step out of the hospital when Cary appeared, visibly furious. "Evelina, what have you done to me?"

He hesitated before launching another accusation."It was you, wasn't it? You hired that lawyer to file for divorce, and then you sabotaged the Gibson Group's stock price!"


As Evelina emerged, fully recovered, the first thing she saw was Cary's enraged face, which immediately soured her mood.



"Cary Gibson, if your brain's messed up, go see a neurologist or get a rabies shot. Stop biting people every time you open your mouth!" Kristina had been fed up with Cary for ages. Now she finally exploded.


Cary retorted angrily, "Who the hell are you calling a rabid dog?!"


"It's you I'm talking about, you fool!" Kristina responded, hands on her hips and full of disdain."Who else but you has been ungrateful after having their sight restored? Who else had an affair with their old flame while married, and now seeks a divorce to leave their spouse with nothing?"



Cary's cheeks flushed with indignation, his posture  lacking any real confidence.


However, he stubbornly retorted, "This is a private issue. It should not have been leaked."



"Do you even hear yourself? Evelina was injured and temporarily blinded. Do you think she had the energy or desire to gossip about your shameful history?"


Kristina jabbed a finger towards Cary. "Who do you think you are? You're nothing but a shameful ###Chapter in Evelina's life! If I were her, I'd erase your name from my memory so thoroughly that no one would ever recall my embarrassing ex-husband!"


"You!" Cary's eye twitched visibly, his irritation mounting, but he could only stammer, "This matter is between Evelina and me. Stay out of it."


He obstinately positioned himself in Evelina's way."Now, with our divorce causing the Gibson Group's stock to plummet, you need to sort this mess out!"
###Chapter 72 Come And Get Beaten!





Evelina could hardly believe what she was hearing from Cary. "What's the stock price of Gibson Group got to do with me?"



Kristina, clearly disgusted, retorted, "You strip your ex-wife of everything and still expect her to solve your company's problems? I've never encountered anyone as shameless as you! Florrie, can you believe this?"



Florrie responded with a firm, "Never seen it."



She didn't mince words, adding, "Absolutely despicable! A real loser!"


Cary was left fuming, at a loss for words, when Margot emerged from the vehicle.



She'd arrived in the same car as Esme and Cary.


They stayed inside for a while, all because Esme had said, "Ms. Marsh was Cary's wife for three years.This is their business-he should be the one to deal with it. I believe in him."



Witnessing her brother being outnumbered and scolded by several women, Margot felt compelled to intervene.



"Nonsense!" she shouted at Evelina. "For three years, you lived at our expense, and now you're meddling with the Gibson stock through this divorce drama. It's your mess, and you're fully accountable!"



As Kristina was about to explode, Evelina restrained her, giving Margot a chilling stare. "Exactly how do you suggest | 'take responsibility'?"


Margot, sensing Evelina's distance, smirked triumphantly. "You need to publicly confess at a press conference that it was your infidelity that caused the divorce."



Kristina burst into laughter, her reaction so genuine it filled the air. "Hahaha!"
Margot, perplexed and irritated, said, "Why are you laughing?"



"Having a brain is necessary. Shame you seem to lack one," Kristina said between chuckles. "Accusing Evelina of cheating when your own brother parades his mistress about? That's gold. Maybe a bit more time behind bars would do you good."


Margot, feeling deeply insulted, raised her hand in a flash of anger.



Smack!



Evelina had reacted swiftly, delivering a firm slap to Margot's face.


Margot was taken aback, her hand frozen mid-air,disbelief written all over her face.


From the car, Esme had been observing quietly but now she intervened, stepping out rapidly. "Ms.Marsh! This is unacceptable!"



It finally sank in for Margot-she'd just been slapped by the one person she hated most, and right in front of a crowd.



Fury exploded inside her as she lunged at Evelina,ready to rip the latter to pieces.



But Evelina didn't flinch. She stepped in, yanked Margot by the hair, and landed several sharp slaps in a row.



Esme was slapped by Evelina as well, which took her by surprise and left her crying as she stumbled into Cary's arms.



Cary, cradling Esme, yelled at Evelina, "Have you lost your mind,Evelina?"



Evelina, maintaining her grip on Margot's hair,retorted, "Lost my mind? It seems you're the ones who are completely out of touch!"



Margot was immobilized, wincing at even the slightest tug on her scalp.



Kristina, meanwhile, protected Florrie, thoroughly entertained by the unfolding drama.
With undeniable assertiveness, Evelina said, "Margot orchestrated my kidnapping with Hayden and his crew. I held back on pressing charges out of respect for Demi, but these slaps? They're long overdue!"


She yanked harder on Margot's hair, forcing the latter to meet her gaze. "Remember to keep it polite whenever you see me, Margot. I can revoke my forgiveness any day, and without my goodwill,you could be facing a cell again. Got it?"



Tears streamed down Margot's face as she frantically blinked to indicate her understanding, unable to nod due to the pain.



Finally, Evelina released her, wiping her hands as if she had touched something horrible.


Margot, not one to concede defeat easily, lunged at Evelina once more.



"Watch out!" Kristina, just as she was passing a tissue to Evelina, spotted Margot's underhanded move and cried out in warning.
With quick reflexes, Evelina dodged backward.


Unable to halt her momentum, Margot stumbled and landed face-first on the ground.


"Margot!" Esme, full of worry, rushed to assist her.



Turning from the fallen Margot, Evelina then fixedher gaze on Esme. "Miss Barton, did you orchestrate this day's events?"



Esme shook her head vigorously, stammering,"I have no idea what you mean!"



Evelina scoffed, "Clearly, it's obvious who gains the most from leaking the divorce, right? Are you planning to marry Cary next?"



Caught off guard, Esme felt her pulse race, her scheme laid bare.



Indeed, it was Esme who had spread the news of the divorce.



No matter how hard she tried, she knew she could never be that pure, perfect first love in his heart again. Her place in his heart wasn't what it used to be.



Thus, she was desperate to secure her position by marrying Cary at the earliest opportunity.
###Chapter 73 A Week Later,You Apologize In Public
"Do you have any proof to back up your allegations,Ms.Marsh?"



Esme would never confess to being the catalyst for the downturn in Gibson Group's stocks.



She had attempted to cast herself and Cary as long-lost lovers reunited, framing Evelina as the other woman.



Yet, the narrative spun out of her control,transforming Cary into an adulterer and Esme into a shameless mistress.



What was meant to unfold as a nostalgic romance spiraled into a scandal, sinking the company's shares even further.



Esme was perplexed about how her plan had so disastrously unraveled. Evelina, incensed, retorted sharply, "I would like to ask you the same question. On what grounds do you accuse me? Just who do you think you are?"


She cautioned Esme, "If you insist on playing the other woman, you should at least have the grace to remain unseen! Test my patience again, and I won't hold back from putting you in your place!"


The harshness of Evelina's words cut deeper than any physical slap might have.


Esme, biting her lip and letting tears flow, was performing for Cary, hoping he might sympathize and defend her.


Cary's heart did twinge with sympathy for Esme,and he was nearly moved to intervene, but Kristina interrupted loudly, "Really, Esme? Who's the audience for your tears? Didn't you initiate this confrontation? Evelina merely granted your wishes,so shouldn't you be grateful instead of upset?"



Kristina had long suppressed her revulsion for Esme,the unabashed home-wrecker. "Remember this Evelina has scheduled your public apology at Landen's grave for next week. Be there on time and show some genuine remorse."



Esme's tears stopped abruptly.


Desperately, she sought Cary's gaze, shaking her head vehemently. "I can't face that...I just can't..."


Already tarnished by scandal, her publc admission of impersonating the Sight Weaver would destroy her completely. The Gibson family could never embrace a daughter-in-law mired in such disgrace!


"Really, Esme, you're unbelievable," Kristina replied with evident scorn. "You orchestrated the deceit,you accepted the bet-"


"Stop!" Cary interjected sharply, moving to Esme's side to protect her from further rebuke.


Grasping Cary tightly, Esme broke down, her sobs wracking her body as she sought refuge in his embrace.



Cary, visibly annoyed, fixed Evelina with a harsh stare. "She invoked your name only to assist others.Must you press her so hard?"


Evelina responded sharply, "If I had lost the bet,would you have shown me any mercy?"



The answer was a resounding no.


Esme and Margot would have taken full advantage of the situation to destroy her.



"Ah, Miss Barton, what a pleasure to see you,"lan said as he emerged from the car, opening the car door for the ladies.



Jasper, observing from within the car the ongoing argument between Cary and Esme, had dispatched lan to intervene.



lan spared no pleasantries for the deceitful pair,issuing a stern warning instead. "As a representative of the Russell family, I witnessed the bet. I advise Miss Barton to fulfill her obligations, or face the Russell family's repercussions."


The implications were clear to all. With the Bartons' modest ventures abroad, Jasper had the means to destroy them financially.


They risked not only bankruptcy but a perpetual burden of debt.



Esme's energy seemed to vanish completely as she fell into Cary's embrace, struggling to breathe.


Evelina, nearing the car, cast one final glance at Esme, saying coldly, "Expect a text with the exact time. Be punctual, Miss Barton."


With that, Esme collapsed completely to the ground.


Cary, in a desperate attempt, reached for Evelina as she entered the car, pleading, "You're targeting Esme because of me... Evelina, we need to discuss this!"


As the car pulled away swiftly, all that remained was a cloud of exhaust in its wake.
###Chapter 74 Drawing A Line





Kristina, impressed from the back seat, exclaimed,"Wow, Mr. Russell controls everything from his seat!His assistant only needed one sentence to take down the mistress. That's what you call influence."



Florrie quickly added with pride, "He's got real power. My uncle is truly unmatched."



While the car was filled with their voices,Evelina was quiet,her gaze lost through the window.



Kristina noticed her friend's distant expression and asked with concern, "Evi,everything alright?"



Since Evelina's return, Kristina could sense a weird dynamic between her and Jasper; one enthusiastic,the other cold.



Evelina managed a weak smile. "I'mn alright."



Florrie, trying to lighten the mood, leaned closer with a playful smile. "What's on your mind then?"



Evelina paused, then chose to open up. "Well, your first surgery went well, which is great. But the next one requires a longer interval. My staying at Morningstar might not be necessary anymore."



"What?" Florrie's smile disappeared immediately taken aback by the implication.



"Are you really leaving?" Jasper was quick to respond, clearly anxious about Evelina's potential departure.



"Yes," Evelina replied, attempting to maintain a light tone. "I need to sort out some personal matters,and with Kristina here, it makes more sense for me to stay at a hotel with her."



Florrie gripped her hand, her expression one of dismay. "But it's also convenient here, isn't it? I don't want you to leave, Evi. You're my closest friend in Aglonard."



Evelina softened. "I cherish our time together too,Florrie. But eventually, we have to resume our own lives, don't we?"



She inhaled deeply, steadying her voice. "Plus, your recovery is going well. It's time for you to think about going back to lreah to continue with your routines.The procedure for the next surgery is straightforward. I can easily come to Ireah to perform it."



Jasper now saw the bigger picture- it wNasn't just about distance; she was distancing herself from the entire Russell family.


Florrie, struggling with the thought, pleaded, "I'm not ready to go back to lreah. I want you here with me,Evi." Her voice breaking slightly.



Florrie had everything planned out in advance.When she returned home, she would bring Evelina along so that her parents and grandfather could thank Evelina properly. Evelina would also have the chance to pay her respects at Landen's grave in lreah, where Esme was expected to make her public apology. "Sweet girl, staying by your side forever isn't possible," Evelina said as she softly stroked Florrie's hair.



"But you can stay!" Tears welled up in Florrie's eyes."Marry my uncle, and we'll never have to part."


Tears began streaming down her face, and neither Evelina nor Kristina could console her despite their gentle efforts.



Ultimately, Jasper was the one who managed to calm his niece. "Evelina is encouraging you to return to Ireah because she cares deeply about you.Remember how you've missed your parents and your grandpa? They're eagerly waiting for you back home."



He tousled her hair affectionately, addling with patience, "And don't worry, I will need to finalize a few business matters here in Aglonard later.I'll bring you along, and you'll have more time to spend with Evelina every day,won't you?"


Holding up her finger, Florrie managed a tearful smile and asked, "Pinky promise?"



Jasper linked his pinky with hers, replying, "Pinky promise."


However, the dinner that was meant to be joyful and filled with laughter felt empty instead. Quietly, after the meal, Evelina packed her belongings and left the villa.



Florrie walked all the way to the front gate with her."You'll visit me often, won't you, Evi?" she asked.


It wasn't until the car vanished from view that Florrie collapsed into Jasper's arms, her tears flowing freely.


Looking through the rearview mirror, Kristina saw not only Florrie's tears but also the sorrow Jasper was attempting to conceal.


At that moment, she couldn't keep her concerns to herself any longer. "Hey, Evi... did something happen between you and Mr. Russell?" she inquired.



Her persistence finally broke through Evelina's silence. That was the moment Kristina found out about the death of Aurora's assistant.


With a steady tone, Evelina said, "The day Aurora took her assistant's body from the hospital, she visited me. She claimed it was to apologize, but her true intent was to warn me. She told me Jasper and I are from different worlds."①



Aurora's words still echoed in her memory. "Evelina,those born into powerful families can't choose their loves. Even if Jasper cares for you, his family will obstruct any marriage plans. Think about it, how genuine can his love be? Heed my advice-leave now before the pain grows. You and he are not destined to be together. If not me, he will end up marrying someone deemed suitable by his family."


Kristina interjected sharply, "Oh, hell no. She dared to spout that nonsense at you? An adopted daughter of the Marsh family, pretending she's royalty? It's clear she's just bitter because she couldn't have Jasper, and now she's trying to prevent anyone else from having him too." Her eyes quickly darted to Evelina. "Hold on-you're not actually thinking of giving up on such a good man just because of what she said, are you?" It seemed out of character for Evelina to be swayed so easily.
###Chapter 75 Fixing The Misunderstanding
Evelina spoke softly, breaking the silence. "There is one truth in Aurora's words, though. In families like hers, there always seems to be some dark secret just out of sight."


Her tone grew somber. "I've decided I'm done with the intrigues of powerful families. It's too dangerous;you never know who might be the next victim."


Kristina remained quiet. She understood that Evelina had always desired nothing more than a calm,uncomplicated life. Otherwise, given her wealth, she would never have married into the Gibson family.


Yet, who could have predicted that the Gibsons,hardly a prominent family at all, would turn her three years of commitment into nothing more than a cruel joke? Back at the hotel, while Evelina reaxed in a bath,Kristina urgently called lan.


In a furious tone, Kristina said, "That hypocrite Aurora had the nerve to visit Evelina before leaving Aglonard. She spewed all sorts of nonsense, claiming Evelina doesn't fit with the Russells."



She shared everything candidly, explaining why Evelina had started pulling away from the Russell family.



Earlier that day, lan had been berated three times already. Jasper was in a terrible mood, and his displeasure had rippled down to everyone else.



lan attentively listened to Kristina's detailed account and immediately passed the information to his boss,careful not to change a single detail.


Jasper responded with shock, "Franklin Marsh told her about the assistant's death?"



He had suspected that Evelina must have found out somehow, which would explain her recent distant behavior.Despite his efforts, he hadn't been able to discover who had disclosed the information.



Who would have thought it was Franklin, a man in another city, who had told her?


Immediately, he called Florrie to his side.


Florrie said with regret, "'I'm sorry, Uncle... Evi asked me to keep it from you. She didn't want to burden you further."


With her head lowered, Florrie avoided his gaze,thinking she might be in trouble.


Jasper comforted her softly. "It's alright, Florrie.Just make sure in the future, you tell me everything right away, no matter the situation."


He then shifted the topic to the day Aurora left the hospital.


Jasper had been elsewhere on that particular day.


Florrie's memory clicked.I remember now.

Caleb took me and Dr. Martinez out to discuss something."


A shadow fell over Jasper's face. "That left Evi alone in the room?"



Florrie nodded."Yes."



Jasper scoffed coldly, "Caleb actually stooped to enable Aurora's scheming? Was he naive or merely foolish?"



Next, he called the bodyguards who had been stationed outside the hospital room.


They immediately acknowledged. "Aurora told us she was here to apologize, and Evelina allowed her in, so we didn't stop her."


Jasper said, "Evelina was still vulnerable, recovering her vision. Didn't you think Aurora could be a threat?"



Quick to defend themselves, one bodyguard said,"Before she entered, we searched her thoroughly."


They never would have allowed her entry otherwise. They monitored the room attentively during her visit.After she departed, they made sure to check on Evelina, confirming her safety before letting Aurora leave.


"Why wasn't this incident reported afterward?"


Until this moment, Jasper had been oblivious to the situation. Could he really trust these people?


Reluctantly, one guard said, "Evelina instructed us not to say anything." His voice filled with remorse.


Jasper, frustrated, dismissed them with a growl. "Go see the butler for your punishment."


In an attempt to soothe his irritation, Florrie quickly brought him a cup of coffee.


lan attempted to interject, "I mean, she was there to apologize. Surely she wouldn't have-"


A stern look from Jasper silenced him immediately.


After a pause, Florrie cautiously broached the subject again. "Uncle, perhaps there's been a misunderstanding with Evi. We need to rectify this."


Seeing a spark of determination in Jasper's eyes,it was clear he was already formulating a plan to resolve the issue.
###Chapter 76 The Motorcycle Stunt





Cary departed swiftly after dropping Esme off, not pausing despite her endearing attempts to make him stay.


"There's a mountain of work waiting for me," he said irritably. "Could you not be so clingy?"


Esme's gaze followed him, her eyes welling up with tears as he walked away.


Her parents were overseas, leaving her brother Sebastian as her nearest kin. In a state of panic, she dialed his number.


Busy with stock market trades, Sebastian didn't answer until later. "Esme, what's happened?"


Between sobs, Esme blurted out, "Evelina is insisting | apologize at Professor Mitchell's grave! It's so embarrassing! If I actually go through such humiliation, the Gibsons will never accept me as a family member, and Cary won't marry me! Without marrying him, I can't recover the seventy million I've invested. Sebastian, what should I do?"


Sebastian exploded over the phone, saying, "Seventy million? Are you out of your mind? That money should have been mine to invest-I'd have doubled it by now!"


Esme's main concern wasn't the money; it was the fear of losing Cary.


"Just help me, please. I promise, if I marry into the Gibsons, you can handle all my finances."


Sebastian's eyes darkened with a sinister idea. "If it's the divorce that's an issue... we could simply make Cary a widower instead." With Evelina out of the picture, Esme wouldn't have to degrade herself at any grave. Things would seamlessly align.


Esme instructed her brother, "Just ensure it's flawless. No evidence, no slip-ups." "Relax," Sebastian scoffed. To him, Evelina was merely another person. Undoubtedly skilled, yes-but an orphan with no influential backers to seek vengeance should anything occur to her. Sebastian found his opportunity two days later.


With Jasper and Florrie away in lreah and Kristina occupied with a business trip, Evelina found herself alone in Aglonard.



Returning from grocery shopping, she navigated the parking lot when suddenly, a motorcycle rushed directly towards her.


Evelina reacted swiftly. She noticed the impending danger and leapt aside just in timne.


Although the motorcycle missed her, it wreaked havoc among her groceries, sending items sprawling across the pavement.


Sebastian,realizing his initial attempt had failed whipped the bike around for another pass. This time,he raised the front wheel, aiming to strikeher fatally.Prepared for confrontation, Evelina tightened her fists, ready to defend herself.


From somewhere came a sharp shout, "What the hell are you doing?!" It was Cary, his voice thick with anger and instantly recognizable.


Out of nowhere, he positioned himself protectively in front of Evelina, intercepting the motorcycle's path.


Sebastian, unable to hit Cary or risk being identified,muttered a curse and sped away.


Cary shouted after him, "Get lost!" A smirk of victory crossed his face before he turned to Evelina, his expression shifting to one of worry. "Are you alright?Did he hurt you?"


Evelina met his concern with a cold stare. "You planned this motorcycle attack, didn't you?"


She scoffed at the tired scenario of a damsel in distress-did Cary actually expect her to believe his act?


After three years together, Evelina understood Cary's true nature all too well. He was always quick to flee at any hint of trouble. The notion that he would suddenly become her savior was utterly absurd.


Unless, of course, the whole thing was just a setup-a clever trick to make her feel like she owed him, all so he could pull her in and use her.


"I have no idea who that was! I was merely passing by," Cary retorted, his tone betraying a lack of surety.


Indeed, Cary had been covertly following Evelina, not out of any desire to patch things up, but driven by the dire financial state of the Gibson Group.


He had concluded that their only hope was to secure investment from Jasper.


Jasper, however, had consistently declined all meetings, leaving Cary in desperation. He shifted his focus to Evelina, hopeful that her recent medical miracle with Florrie's sight might incline Jasper to offer a favor.


Considering his grandmother's intervention, he was quickly discouraged by her stern refusal and criticism of the plan. With no viable alternatives, this was the scheme he resorted to.


Finding himself at a dead end, he had hatched this last-ditch scheme.


"Is that the case?" Evelina was ready to probe further just as a new motorcycle surged toward them.


Unlike the first, this bike and its rider were clearly different, not matching the initial attacker.


Recognition flashed in Cary's eyes as he spotted the red scarf around the rider's neck, his forehead beading with sweat.


This was the accomplice he had arranged for. Then who was the initial motorcyclist?
###Chapter 77 The Mysterious Stock God
Evelina, having narrowly escaped one attack, was ready for the next. She quickly grabbed a milk carton from the ground and threw it at the approaching biker's helmet.


The sudden impact startled the rider, causing him to lose control. The motorcycle veered off and slammed into a nearby parked car. The rider was thrown from the bike, landing harshly on the car's hood, setting off its alarm.



Rushing to the scene, Evelina dragged the stunned man from the car, ripped off his helmet, and delivered several forceful punches to his face.



Under the strain, the biker quickly confessed everything he knew.


Before he could tell any names, Cary had already fled the scene, vanishing as swiftly as a cockroach when the lights come on.


Without hesitation, Evelina called the police.


Once she had turned the assailant over to the authorities, she made her way to the security office to review the CCTV footage. She managed to capture the license plate of the first motorcycle and recorded the entire incident. She promptly forwarded the evidence to Lena.


"I expect a name within 24 hours."


Lena replied, "Your Majesty, you're underestimating me. Half a day is more than enough."


Living up to her word, Lena delivered a comprehensive report in just a few hours. The perpetrator was Sebastian Barton.


"That scoundrel had the nerve to harm you?" Lena's fury was evident. "Shall I unleash my wrath, 'your majesty?'"


"There's no need. You're already busy with managing my enterprises," replied Evelina, choosing to deal with the situation herself.


Sebastian thought he was on his way to becoming a "Wall Street titan?" She was determined to see him crumble in that very arena. Sebastian maintained a low profile after his unsuccessful attempt on Evelina's life, choosing to remain mostly indoors.


The police hadn't bothered him. He eventually learned that Cary had been scapegoated for the debacle, which secretly pleased him.


Still, Esme's persistent whining about Evelina being alive irritated him.



"Stop your crying! Do you want your brother to risk his life for nothing? It's merely an apology at a grave.You'll manage."


The loyalty he had once felt towards Esme quickly morphed into regret. He had narrowly escaped trouble this time and decided not to test his luck further.


With a new resolve, he decided to shift his focus back to finance. Murder plots were out;it was time to dive back into the world of stocks.



When he walked onto the tradingfloor the next morning, the chatter was immediate-someone had made a significant impact on the market in his absence.



An unknown trader had recently escalated a modest million to a staggering ten million in a mere couple of days. Their strategy was flawless, marked by perfect timing for buys and sells, resulting in uninterrupted victories.



The talk around the trading floor was that this financial wizard had already left the public trading areas for a secluded VIP suite.



Sebastian fouund it hard to believe. In Aglonard? He doubted that some unknown from this provincial spot could demonstrate such trading skills.
However, by the third and fourth days, this new "stock deity" was still on a winning streak.


Every stock they engaged soared to its trading limit.


Impressed by such expertise, Sebastian was driven to seek this person out.


He managed to learn their exact location after making some inquiries. Carrying a bottle of top-tier scotch and feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension, he knocked on the door.


A female voice responded from within, "The door's open."



He entered to discover the room occupied by a single person: a woman clad in a striking scarlet dress, her identity hidden behind a sophisticated fox mask,with lush dark hair draped over her shoulders.


The room was otherwise unoccupied.



"Um, excuse me. I was looking for the celebrated stock genius-is that person here?" "I wouldn't claim to be a stock genius. But I am the only one present."


Sebastian was oblivious to her true identity, thanks to the voice modulator hidden within her mask.


"Are you the person behind all these strategic moves?" he asked in disbelief. "And you're a woman?"



"Does that come as a surprise?" Evelina responded with a soft chuckle. "If you traveled all this way just to ask such pointless questions, you might as well leave now."



"No, not at all!" Sebastian hastily produced the bottle of scotch he had brought. "I've long admired your work.I merely wanted to show my respect!"


Evelina eyed the bottle and smiled approvingly."That's quite considerate of you."


She then engaged him in effortless conversation.


Sebastian was captivated as they spoke. Her perspectives often mirrored his own, and as their conversation deepened, he felt a kinship with her, as if discovering a kindred spirit within the world of stocks.


Before he departed, he asked her for a few investment tips, eager to leverage her insights for profit. Evelina shared her recommendations candidly.


The following day, acting on her advice, Sebastian executed a swift trade that netted him a substantial sum.



Thrilled by his success, he started making daily visits, each time bringing small gifts that he thought she would enjoy, once even presenting her with a lavish designer purse valued at several thousand dollars.



"Sebby, I consider you one of my own, and yet you continue these formalities?" Evelina said during one visit, her voice still altered by the modulator,sounding confident and controlled.



"You've already won me over. Pampering you is just my way of showing gratitude." He was, after all, relying on her to boost his fortune.


However, one day, as he arrived at her VIP sute with new gifts, he found the room deserted.


A wave of anxiety washed over him. Had the stock goddess disappeared? 
###Chapter 78 Set A Trap For Sebastian





In a panic, Sebastian searched for his phone, only to realize he hadn't secured the contact details of the stock genius.


He cursed himself for his oversight.


Fate had delivered a goldmine right into his hands,and he had failed to secure it properly.


Amid his growing anxiety, his phone buzzed to life.


Instinctively, he answered the call, and Esme's worried voice filled his ear. "Sebastian, where are you?"



His patience worn thin, Sebastian retorted sharply,"Where do you think I am? There's only one place I could be."



"Sebastian!" Esme's voice cracked with emotion, her tears evident. She was well aware her brother was embroiled in his stock endeavors again. "Didn't you promise to accompany me to lreah today? Have you forgotten?"



Despite Evelina's resilience, she now needed to travel to lreah's southern suburbs to make amends at Landen's grave.


Sebastian had vowed not to let her undertake this alone, yet he had allowed the promise to slip from his mind completely.


"Why does that even matter? Leave me alone!"Frustrated by his sister's persistent sobbing,Sebastian ended the call abruptly.


Yet Esme persisted, her calls flooding in one after another.


Meanwhile, Sebastian's mind raced as he tried to devise a way to reconnect with the elusive stock genius.


Sebastian repeatedly ended calls from Esme until he finally said, "Stop it, Esme! Can't you see I'm busy with actual work? I don't have time to constantly cater to you!"


Just as he spat out those words, he realized he hadn't recognized the number he'd answered.


And then, the unmistakable voice of the stock market maven emerged from the phone. "Sebby, why all the fuss?"



Instantly, Sebastian's tone shifted fromn annoyance to sycophantic charm. "Where have you been? I've been scouring the stock exchange for you-l was afraid you'd left me. What would I do without you?"


On the other end, Evelina nearly choked.


Yet, she maintained her role.



"Wasn't it me who called? You're such afaithful soul -I couldn't possibly abandon you. Listen, I have an urgent matter that requires me to leave Aglonard for a few days. Use this number to reach me going forward."



Sebastian was indifferent to her reasons; his focus remained solely on the benefits she brought him from the stock market.


He promptly asked, "Now that you're leaving, will you be trading online during these next few days?"



With a subtly mischievous smile, Evelina set her strategy in motion. "Sadly, my vision isn't what it should be. Staring at a computer screen for too long is too taxing, so no online trading for me. Here's what we'll do-l'll let you use my VIP trading suite. You take over my trading duties while I'm away."



Sebastian was ecstatic, exactly what he had hoped for. Still, he feigned reluctance. "Doesn't this feel a bit improper?"


Evelina quickly squashed any objections. "It's settled then. We're friends; let's keep it simple."



Sebastian beamed, unable to hide his enthusiasm."Of course! I'll do exactly as you say. Teaming up with you is like winning the lottery."


She then detailed a list of stocks for him to monitor,instructing him to buy them aggressively once their prices hit her specified level.


Additionally, she handed over her stock market account credentials, instructing him to take good care of it.



Delighted by her trust, Sebastian pledged to handle it with utmost care.



As her flight was called over the airport loudspeaker,Evelina quickly replied, "I have to head out now. Get in touch if you need anything."


"Safe travels," Sebastian said.


Right after ending the call, Sebastian, reveling in his newfound status, started requesting the luxurious amenities of the VIP room.



He was all set to dive into the luxurious lifestyle.


Before long, he was relishing a selection of fine imported fruits and enjoying the services of a massage therapist. Sebastian felt so at ease, he almost lost track of his surroundings.


When another call from Esme interrupted his peace,he swiftly moved to add her number to the block list.


There was no way he was going to accompany his sister to lreah and face potential embarrassment.


His plan was to stay put, manage the affairs of the stock market savant, and accumulate vast wealth.


Over at the airport lounge, Esme was seething with anger to the point of tears after finding out Sebastian had blocked her.


While Cary being too preoccupied to escort her to Ireah was somewhat forgivable, her brother's outright abandonment was not.



What she didn't realize was that Cary had already boarded his flight to lreah in first class.



He had orchestrated a minor disruption at the airport via a friend, ensuring Kristina would miss her flight.

All these maneuvers were crafted to facilitate an unplanned meeting with Evelina.


As Evelina approached her seat, Cary cheerfully initiated a conversation from the seat beside hers."What a coincidence!" he said with a smile.
###Chapter 79 Not Happy To See Me





Evelina looked at Cary. A mocking scoff slipped out as the pieces suddenly fell intoplace.


Not long before, Kristina had called to mention she'd be delayed on the next flight, which had left Evelina wondering.


With Cary sitting where Kristina should have been,the truth wasn't hard to conclude.



"Surprised? To me, it's simply fate," Cary replied,radiating a confidence that suggested she should be delighted by his actions.


He had never made such an effort for Esme; Evelina was the first. He thought she would surely be moved by his dedication.


"Really, this is the sort of feeble attempt you think impresses people?" Evelina gave him a look filled with derision and then proceeded to seek a seat change.


Cary,who had been lounging carelessly in his seat without offering any help with her luggage, abruptly stood up.


He caught Evelina's wrist firmly. "You're supposed to sit here. Where are you headed?"


"It doesn't concern you," Evelina retorted, attempting to wrest her wrist from his grasp, but Cary only tightened his hold.


"Doesn't our marriage make it my business?"


Whispers of disapproval circulated among the passengers as they witnessed what seemed to be a domestic dispute-clearly not suitable for the confined space of the cabin.


Evelina, however, was unfazed by the bystanders.If she was to make a scene, she intended for it to be unforgettable.


"So now I'm your wife?" she asked, her voice cutting like a knife. "Where was this loyalty when you were with your mistress? Or when you slapped that divorce paper in front of me, trying to leave me penniless?"


Her voice escalated with her resentment. "Suddenly,because you think I have some influence with Mr.Russell, we're married again?"


She then forcefully stomped on Cary's foot and twisted her heel deeper.


Cary hunched over, wincing in agony, yet his grasp didn't falter.


"As long as our divorce isn't finalized, you are still my wife!" he responded; determined to maintain his hold.


Evelina swore quietly. Could this bastard really intend to stickto her like a parasite?


As she prepared to escalate the conflict, a calm voice from behind her intervened-


"Mr. Gibson, if your aim is to discuss an investment with my employer, harassing Ms. Marsh isn't necessary. Please, deal with me," lan said, stepping in smoothly.


lan gave Evelina a reassuring nod, then quickly moved to intercept Cary, forcefully twisting his wrist.


Cary let out a sharp yelp of pain.


Without paying him any further attention, lan pushed Cary firmly back into his seat before turning to Evelina. "My seat is right behind yours. Feel free to use it."



"Thank you," Evelina responded promptly, eager to distance herself from Cary.


As she moved towards lan's row, a tall man rose in front of her and smoothly relieved her of her carry-on.


Evelina looked up in surprise. "Jasper? Why are you here?"


She had assumed Jasper remained in Ireah after his last trip there with Florrie, thinking only lan had been traveling between the cities. "Aren't you glad to see me?" Jasper inquired as he stowed her bag overhead and motioned towards the window seat.


"No, it's just... unexpected." Evelina felt unexpectedly vulnerable, as if he could read her every thought.


He took the seat next to hers, then faced her, his voice low and earnest. "What if I said I came specifically to pick you up...would that please you?"


Jasper hadn't seen Evelina for over a week. He thought he would be fine, yet the longer she was away, the deeper his longing grew.


He was taken aback by how much he missed her.


Evelina chose not to respond directly to his statement. Instead, she chuckled lightly. "I suppose Florrie sent you after me, didn't she? She's always so thoughtful."


"It was my own choice," Jasper responded softly."She didn't ask me." Evelina was momentarily at a loss for words,surprised by his admission.


Their awkward pause was fortunately interrupted by a flight attendant arriving to take their orders, giving them a brief spare from their conversation.


Once the plane took off, Evelina requested a blanket and a sleep mask, promptly tilting her seat back to sleep.


Avoiding conversation was her way to sidestep potential discomfort, and truthfully, she felt exhausted. Soon, she fell into a deep sleep.


Her slumber was abruptly disturbed by a sudden lurch of the aircraft.


"Evelina, wake up. We've encountered some turbulence," Jasper said, concern evident in his voice.


Shaken,Evelina found herself upright, with Jasper having adjusted her seat for her.


The purser's voice came over the cabin speakers- steady and composed-assuring everyone it was just turbulence, nothing to worry about.


She reminded passengers to stay seated,keep their seat belts fastened, and remain calm as the plane moved through the rough patch.


However, a passenger peering out the window shouted in alarm.


"This isn't just turbulence-it's a thunderstorm!We're heading right into a storm! This is the end for us!" they exclaimed, their voice filled with panic.
###Chapter 80 Evelina Is Mine!





The sight of a looming thundercloud typically instilled fear.


This feeling was heightened as a passenger's cry of despair echoed through the cabin, followed by a lightning strike hitting the plane's right side.


Although the damage was minor, the aircraft swayed briefly.



The cabin erupted into chaos!


Despite the best efforts of the purser and the flight attendants to restore order, passengers were overwhelmed with panic, pushing their way toward the cockpit.



Some pleaded to turn back, others demanded an immediate landing.


A handful, clueless about flying, confronted the captain directly, seeking someone to blame.


One particularly desperate passenger even requested a parachute from the purser, intent on escaping the perceived doomed flight.


Infuriated, the purser said, "Do you even know how to operate a parachute? Can you open it? The aircraft is under control. Please, take your seat."


The passenger was left speechless, realizing he had no knowledge of parachutes beyond movie scenes,where jumping from a troubled plane seemed customary.


Amid the chaos, Evelina remained calm, pressing her face against the window to study the thunderclouds.


Navigating through this intense cloud layer was challenging, yet not completely unfeasible.


While the chaos ensued, Jasper had already begun using his professional equipment to measure the cloud density and check the plane's status.

 
"Jasper!" Evelina abruptly pointed out an important finding. "Look, there's an opening in the clouds.lt might be possible for us to go through."


"Where?" Jasper quickly identified the same opening.





He was taken aback. His training in the military and access to advanced gear typically gave him an edge in such situations.



Yet,Evelina had noticed it first with just her eyesight,despite the challenging conditions.


How was that possible?



"Yes, exactly there," Evelina answered, peering at the instrument readings.


After reviewing the data, she said, "Sadly, the opening is quite narrow. It would require remarkable piloting skills to maneuver through."


Jasper agreed with a nod. "True. I've handled similar challenges before. It might not be too tough. I can help guide the pilot." Evelina was surprised to learn that Jasper was not only an expert marksman but also possessed piloting skills.



She said, "I've only ever been a co-pilot under my mentor."


While her flying abilities were competent, she had never handled the controls alone under such grave conditions.


Jasper, visibly impressed, complimented her."You know how to fly too, Evelina? That's remarkable."


He playfully tousled her hair and then stood, his expression earnest. "Do you trust me?"


"Absolutely!" Evelina rose swiftly, her expression one of resolve. "You'll manage to bring us down safely."


They would all make it out of this safely, including themselves.



With a confident nod and a smile, Jasper asked,"After we land, might I ask you over to my place?" "I must. Florrie expects me," Evelina replied,attempting to muster a cheerful smile.


"It's settled then." Jasper aimed to keep the goodbye light, not wanting it to sound too grave.


But the thought lingered-what if? What if something catastrophic happened during the flight? He didn't want to have any regrets. Evelina needed to know his feelings.


She was perceptive; surely, she would understand.


"It's settled," Evelina replied, gripping Jasper's hand tightly in a gesture of solidarity, offering him both strength and support.


However, to Cary, who had just observed this exchange, it appeared as though Evelina was overtly flirting with Jasper.


"What's going on here?"


He had finally extricated himself from lan amidst the turmoiI, only to find Evelina apparently in a meeting with Jasper! Esme and Margot had earlier suggested there was something going on between them, but Cary had dismissed those claims.



He had convinced himself that a man as distinguished as Jasper would never seriously consider Evelina, a woman who was already married.Cary thought Jasper's interest would be fleeting at best.



Yet here was Evelina, seemingly having won Jasper's heart by leveraging her medical expertise.


Enraged, Cary shouted, "Evelina, where is your decency? We're not even divorced, and you're already seeking a new partner?"


"Control your words!" Jasper retorted angrily. "Or l might just throw you out of this plane myself!"


At that moment, a flash of lightning momentarily lit up the sky, causing Cary's legs to shake.



Simultaneously, the purser's announcement crackled through the speakers. "We need medical assistance.
Our co-pilot has injured his arm and requires immediate care."


Typically, even skilled professionals hesitate to step forward in such tense moments, fearing the repercussions of their involvement.


Nonetheless, Evelina boldly said, "I'm a doctor.Let me help."


Cary tried to hold her back. "Are you insane? What if they blame you-ah!"


His protest was abruptly silenced as Jasper forcefully dislocated his arm. 


Cary's agonized screams echoed through the cabin.


Jasper gave him a severe warning, "Evelina belongs to me. Stay away fromn her, or the consequences will be severe next time!"

###Chapter 81 A Thought Of Marrying Her


Cary collapsed into his seat, visibly defeated and silenced, his face a mask of humiliation.

Yet internally, he boiled with fury. Evelina had betrayed him, and he was determined not to let her escape consequence.

For Evelina, Cary's feelings were a distant concern. Even as Jasper declared her his, she only briefly registered surprise before focusing on the crisis at hand.

Upon receiving the purser's update on the co-pilot's injury, Evelina's expression turned grave. She immediately requested lan to fetch a windproof jacket for Jasper.

The purser, who had planned to send Evelina into the cockpit because the co-pilot was confined to his post,was taken aback by her request.

Jasper took a moment to explain the severity of the situation to the purser.

The purser wasted no time in contacting the captain through the intercom. Following a quick discussion, it was decided that once the cockpit door opened, Jasper would step in to assume co-pilot duties, allowing the injured co-pilot to exit for medical care.

This plan was deemed the most practicaI given the current emergency.

Nonetheless, a passenger, misunderstanding the plan, asked Jasper,"Why are you to assume the co-pilot's role? Are you even qualified to fly?"

Jasper ignored the baseless skepticism.

Why would he enter the cockpit if he lacked the necessary skills?

The urgency in the cockpit was clear, indicating.that the situation might be graver than it appeared.

Witnessing Jasper face undue criticism, Evelina couldn't hold back. She defended him vehemently to the questioning passenger, saying,"a former Air Force pilot and flew fighter jets. We're about to navigate through a storm, and cooperation is crucial. If you can't contribute positively, at least remain quiet and stop stirring panic."

"You-" the man said, about to hurl an insult. But suddenly, lan's hand came down hard on his head,effectively cutting him off.

This man was known to lan; he was the spoiled son of a prominent businessman from Ireah.

Once he realized it was lan who had struck him, he chose to remain silent.

Returning with the jacket Evelina had asked for, lan addressed Jasper. "Mr. Russell." Evelina then took the jacket from lan and helped Jasper into it.

As Evelina fitted the jacket on him, Jasper was momentarily swept up by the thought of their possible future together-Evelina as his wife, her warmth, her care for his well-being, and her readiness to defend him.

Though Jasper had never previously considered marriage appealing, the idea of marrying Evelina seemed not just tolerable, but desirable.

"Jasper, best of luck. We're all behind you," Evelina said, concealing the dread and reluctance that weighed on her heart.

Initially, Evelina had thought of Jasper as merely a brief ###Chapter in he life, yet now, the thought of his potential loss filled her with deep sorrow.

Jasper responded with a determined nod, "Evelina, please wait for me."

Right as everyone braced themselves, the cockpit door swung open unexpectedly.

A sharp, cold wind blasted from the cockpit into the cabin, causing uncontrollable shivering among the passengers.

Initially skepticaI of Evelina's request for a jacket, lan now realized its importance and admired her foresight.

The wind was fierce enough that unsecured passengers could have easily been swept off their feet.

With the help of nearby passengers pushing him forward against the powerful gusts, Jasper managed to make his way into the cockpit.

Once inside, he found the conditions more severe than he had imagined.

The cockpit's right-side window was damaged, featuring a hole with spreading cracks that threatened its entire integrity.

Despite wearing oxygen masks, the captain and co-pilot struggled with the biting cold.

Jasper quickly equipped himself with an oxygen mask and took the injured co-pilot's place.

The wounded co-pilot, cradling his arm, swiftly exited the cockpit.

When the door shut, the cabin atmosphere felt instantly revitalized.

Flight attendants and the purser escorted the injured co-pilot to Jasper's previous seat, where Evelina was ready to administer medical care.

She skillfully addressed a deep cut on his right arm, cleaning and stitching the wound, applying necessary medication, and finally bandaging it securely.

Relief was evident on the co-pilot's face after Evelina's treatment. He expressed his gratitude and his eagerness to return to the cockpit to assist.

"Your arm needs more recovery time. You wouldn't beof much help in your current state," Evelina cautioned him sternly.

"I'm just worried... they haven't worked as a team before," the co-pilot replied, visibly anxious.

"Rest assured, his experience with collaborative efforts is extensive."

Evelina's faith in Jasper was unwavering, though she couldn't exactly explain why she felt so certain.

"We should concentrate on staying safe here, to ensure we're not a distraction," she suggested.

Just as she finished her statement, the cabin lights began to flicker forebodingly.

The aircraft was nearing the storm's most intense area.
 
 Evelina was familiar with this scenario; she knew the lighting and communications systems were likely to fail imminently.

Catching the purser's eye, she nodded subtly, and the purser promptly instructed all passengers to secure themselves by sitting and buckling up.

Within seconds, darkness swallowed the cabin.
###Chapter 82 The Girl He Likes


The silence was oppressive, thick enough that one could hear the beat of their own heart, a stark reminder of the menacing presence of death.

In the silence of the cabin, time seemed tostretch endlessly, each moment loaded with evident dread.

Amidst this, Evelina found herself pondering a bleak thought. "What if this is where I die..."

Visions of Jasper interrupted her grim musings-a man marked by his silent strength. She realized she had never truly embraced love, not deeply and fully. Was shereally going to exit the world without experiencing true love?

Should she escape this predicament, she considered opening her heart to Jasper. Her faith in love, in men,was worn thin, yet Jasper might be the exception.

Just then, Cary's voice shattered the tense silence, panic-stricken and accusatory. "Evelina! I'm going to die because of you!"

As Evelina rolled her eyes, a morbid thought crossed her mind. "Dying today might mean an eternity trapped with Cary, forever bickering on a spectral journey to the underworld."

Yet, Cary continued his rant relentlessly, "If we make it out alive, forget about leaving me. You're stuck with me for life-every single day!"

Suddenly, a muffled "Shut up" echoed through the darkness; lan had intervened, his hand likely over Cary's mouth, sparing them all from more of Cary's complaints.

Laughter erupted, itssource unknown, yet it quickly spread throughout the cabin.

The space came alive with sounds, a symphony of confessions, wishes, and heartfelt farewells.

These voices momentarily held the terror at bay until a haunting silence fell once more, deepening-the pervasive fear.Sobs started quietly, soon turning into a collective cry.

It was then that Evelina began to sing the national anthem. Her solitary voice was soon joined by another,and then another, swelling into a unified chorus.

Their voices filled the cabin, a defiant stand against their looming fate.

Abruptly, the overhead lights flickered on.

Outside, the clouds parted to reveal clear blue skies.

Triumphant cheers filled the'air. "We're through! We've survived!"

Passengers sprung fromtheir seats, embracing one another, no longer strangers but kin forgéd in crisis.

In this instant, a profound connection was cemented among them, born from a shared brush with mortality.

The co-pilot, overwhelmed with relief, said, "They did it... they really did it..."

Evelina assisted the flight attendants in soothing the passengers, reminding them they weren't out of danger until they touched down.

In the cockpit, Jasper and the pilot remained utterly focused on navigating the plane to safety.

The cracked windshield rendered further travel impossible, so an emergency landing at Eastmere Airport became essential.

Complicating matters further,the plane was too heavy with fuel, posing a risk for landing.

"This is a risky move," said Jasper, earning a somber nod from the pilot.

In the cabin below, the flight crew readied everyone for a potentially rough landing: assume the brace position, hold on, and keep breathing.

The plane descended sharply, far steeper than normal. As it touched down, the aircraft trembled violently.

It kept moving, refusing to stop. Despite the pilot's efforts to brake, the plane continued to skid along the runway... In a moment that felt destined for disaster, the plane unexpectedly/halted just before the end of the runway.

The pilot, a skilled veteran in his forties, turned to Jasper with astonishment. "Your instincts are incredible."

Jasper had made critical decisions that crucially slowed the plane just enough.

"I have someone special on board," Jasper responded, explaining his determination.

His resolve was clear: nothing could happen to Evelina on his watch.

With the immediate threat over, Jasper quickly released his seatbelt and made his way to the cabin door,eager to ensure Evelina's safety.

Jasper barely progressed before being engulfed by a wave of passengers, their expressions a mixture of joy and gratitude, as if greeting a hero returning from battle. Each hand that reached for his was a token of their gratitude.

Despite his discomfort with the sudden acclaim, Jasper maintained a composed, albeit rigid, demeanor throughout the unexpected ceremony.

At a distance, Evelina watched, her smile radiant, her gaze fixed on him, choosing to remain apart from the crowd.

It was only after the aisle had emptied and the last of the passengers had disembarked that Jasper managed to reach her side.
###Chapter 83 Resolving Misunderstandings


As Jasper took those final strides, he appeared tranquil and self-assured. Yet beneath the surface, his emotions churned-part thrill, part unease.

"Jasper, that was incredible! I'm beyond impressed!"

Before he could even find his footing, Evelina leaped forward and embraced him tightly.

A mesmerizing scent wrapped around him, and the inner chaos gave way to sheer bliss.

He struggled to accept this was happening, but the warm figure pressed against him made everything undeniably real.

"I'm just relieved you're safe," he murmured, holding her like he never wanted to let go,overwhelmed by gratitude and a sense of something finally aligning between them.

"You have no shame, Evelina! How could you-ow!"

Cary was mid-outburst when lan, without hesitation, shoved his dislocated shoulder back in place.

A sharp cry escaped Cary as lan dragged him down the aisle.

Jasper had been seconds away from commending lan's timing, but Evelina pulled back just then.

His arms suddenly empty, Jasper stood there feeling an ache he couldn't quie place. "Evelina...?"

She had already regained her poise, her tone all business. "Tell me exactly wat happened in the cockpit.Do you think it was a malfunction, or something intentional?"

She strode toward the front of the aircraft.

The moment her eyes landed on the mangled.remains of the windshield, her doubts intensified. "That glass is reinforced. It doesn't break under normal circumstances. Jasper, I reviewed the passenger manifest.Besides you, a few others were tied to powerful families. And where did we land? Eastmere..." A region known for its unrest was now the unexpected location of a significant gathering.

The town was overflowing, bursting at the seams with unfamiliar faces and unpredictable energy.

"Are you suggesting this detour wasn't coincidental,but calculated?"

Jasper had entertained that idea, but her arriving at the same thought caught him off guard

It made perfect sense why he admired her-sharp mind, keen instincts.

"We don't know Eastmere's terrain or players. We must stay alert," she warned.

After such a close brush with death, Evelina was hyperaware of danger.

"No need to worry. lan has arranged for an extraction. A chopper's on its way."-

Jasper offered reassurance, extending a hand to guide her down the ramp.

But she deftly sidestepped the gesture. "We should be ready for surprises."

"...Of course." His hand dropped as awkward silence crept between them. He followed without another word.

"Evelina!" he suddenly called out before they crossed the threshold of the jet.

She paused and looked back. "What is it?"

Meeting her gaze with unwavering intensity, he spoke slowly. "I would never hurt you."

In his world, tough decisions were unavoidable-but his loyalty was to those he held close.

And Evelina meant more than she probably realized.

"I didn't want Aurora's assistant to die. I accept responsibility, but it wvasn't by choice."

He laid himself bare, hoping she'd stop retreating behind her walls.

"I believe you," she said, resolute. Though her heart trusted him, her life was still tangled with Cary-and until that was resolved, she couldn't embrace anything new.

Jasper found the response inadequate.

In a rush, he stepped in front of her, halting her movement. "Every word I've said to you is real."

Even the bold declaration he made in Cary's presence-that he wanted her by his side.

Evelina was taken aback by his urgency, then smiled gently. "I know."

"Then why not-"offer him a real answer?

Her smile widened. "Give me time to decide. Besides-"

She teased, "Ireah has no shortage of charming, eligible men. I should browse a little before picking the one I fancy most."

His heart sank, and his body stilled.

She noticed and softened her tone. "At this moment, Jasper, you still hold first place."
###Chapter 84 Sharing A Room


A smile broke across Jasper's face as he looked at Evelina. Her lively demeanor charmed him increasingly.

They walked off the plane separately and did not hold hands.

Seeing this, Cary let out a sigh of relief, and he kept inching towards Evelina.

The path was blocked by lanand the Russell bodyguards.

"Ms. Marsh is under our protectionlan said, his voice cold. "I would advise you not to interfere, Mr.Gibson."

still my wife," Cary retorted, frustration evident in his voice.

lan gave him a cold stare. "That's about to change. I'd recommend you keep your distance."

With Jasper openly expressing his interest in Evelina, the Russell family's intent was clear-they wouldn't allow the Gibson family to procrastinate over the divorce any longer.

Upon exiting the plane, Jasper and Evelina didn't head for the terminal. Instead, they awaited a helicopter.

Night descended and the news came; adverse weather had delayed the helicopter. Hailstorms across the route made flying dangerous.

Jasper's expression tightened. "It seems you were right-someone does want to keep us here."

Evelina,responded calmly, "Now, I'm intrigued to discover who might be behind this."

Jasper's eyes sparkled with determination. "I'm eager to see who dares challenge us."

A knowing glance passed between them, accompanied by a conspiratorial smile.

As darkness enveloped Eastmere and their options dwindled, finding overnight accommodations became inevitable.
Due to a bustling local festival, every nearby hotel was at full capacity. lan worked his connections to secure the last two available rooms at a secluded four-star hotel on the outskirts.

"This was the best available," lan explained, somewhat apologetically. "You'll have to make it work."

Both Jasper and Evelina took the news in stride, expressing no displeasure.

Upon their arrival at the hotel, they discovered Cary already there, mingling with some other unassuming wealthy youth.

After being ousted from the airport by lan, Cary's unexpected reunion with Evelina sparked a vindictive pleasure in him.

He mused internally that fate seemed intent on delivering Evelina back into his sphere. Regardless of her new ties with Jasper, she couldn't seem to shake him off.

Spotting them, Cary couldn't resist mocking, "Look who it is. I didn't expect to bump into you here. What's the matter, didn't make it to lreah?"

Evelina's response was a dismissive look, treating Cary like an insignificant annoyance.

Their arrival pushed the hotel to its limit, forcing Jasper and Evelina to share the presidential suite due to lack of other accommodations.

Initially, Jasper had intended to offer Evelina the entire suite and find alternative accommodations for himself, but every room was booked-lan and the bodyguards even had to cram into a double.

"My apologies for the tight quarters," Jasper said to Evelina.

"Not a problem," she responded with a smile, looking around the spacious suite. "There are plenty of rooms here.We'll manage just fine."

"Please, take the master bedroom," Jasper insisted.

"Sure," Evelina replied, appreciating his considerate offer.

Suddenly, Cary erupted with resentment. "Evelina! You're still legally my wife, and here you are, planning to room with another man? How do you see me?"

Without missing a beat, Evelina coolly replied, "As a joke."

Enraged yet impotent, Cary's complexion reddened, yet he restrained himself from confronting Jasper directly. The surrounding onlookers laughed openly at his plight.

"You have no shame-" Cary tried to retort, his anger peaking, but stopped short as one of Jasper's bodyguards made a subtle threatening gesture. He quickly retreated amidst the crowd's mocking cries of "Coward!"

As Jasper and Evelina prepared to retire to their suite, their path was unexpectedly crossed by another arrival.

The voice was unmistakable. "Jasper? Is that really you? What brings you here?"

Aurora paused in the doorway, her small suitcase in tow, appearing as if she had traveled far.

A bodyguard followed, laden with an excessive amount of luggage.

Jasper, with a hint of suspicion, replied, "I was about to ask you the same. What brings you to Eastmere?Don't tell me it's a coincidence."
###Chapter 85 What You Two Are Sharing A Bedroom


"Jasper, what's that supposed to mean?" Aurora asked, her voice trembling, hurt flashing across her features.

"Exactly what you heard. Do I need to spell it out?" How could Jasper not question her intentions?

She'd assured him they were nothing more than friends, that she would respect that boundary. HHe had taken her at her word.

Yet she'd gone behind his back and stirred up trouble with Evelina, who was still emotionally fragile, causing her to believe Jasper was cruel and unfeeling. They'd only just patched things up earlier that day.

"Now I understand." Aurora's eyes shimmered as she looked between Jasper and Evelina, then addressed her bodyguard. "Mara, we're leaving."

"Miss Marsh, where do you plan to go? All accommodations nearby are full," Mara replied anxiously, holding Aurora's arm.

Then she turned to Jasper and quickly tried to explain. "Mr. Russell, this is a huge miscommunication. Miss Marsh had a scheduled meeting in lcewell, and we were en route to Newmoor for a finance event. But the vehicle broke down midway, and we couldn't secure a replacement. Nightfall came, and we had no alternative but to seek shelter here."

Icewell, a major hub, indeed hosted several Marsh family enterprises.

And yes,there was a financial event slated in Newmoor the following afternoon.

The path from Icewell to Newmoor led through Eastmere. Everything checked out.

Yet Jasper's demeanor remained distant. "Your vehicle broke down? How incredibly convenient."

Aurora's complexion turned pale as she turned to leave once more, only for Mara to halt her.

Drawing close, Mara said in a hushed, urgent tone, "Truthfully, our vehicle didn't just break down-it was sabotaged.I believe someone wanted us trapped here."

Her gaze darted subtly toward Evelina, the unspoken accusation hanging in the air.

Jasper's expression turned steely. "You believe? Where's your evidence?"

This bodyguard, emboldened by her connection to Ady, clearly had no qualms about confronting him.

Sensing tension rising, Aurora stepped forward to diffuse the situation. "She's only speculating. She wasn't pointing fingers at Evelina."

A convenient clarification-but the implication had already landed.

Evelina, unbothered, met their eyes with cool detachment. "Maybe the better question is-who had access to Aurora's travel plans? Worth investigating. Internal betrayal is far more dangerous than any external threat."

Mara went pale. "Are you calling me a traitor?"

Evelina gave a thin smile. "Just thinking out loud. But your reaction... interesting. Did I touch a nerve?"

Mara's fists tightened, ready to retaliate.

"Throwing around wild claims just makes you look ridiculous," Jasper warned, his eyes sharp.

Mara backed down, humiliated but still fuming inside.

Despite the chaos, Jasper agreed to let Aurora stay, assigning her a spot in the luxurious suite.

Mara insisted on remaining close, offering to sleep on the bedroom floor.

lan scoffed. "Who do you think you are, suggesting something so inappropriate? Should I assign bodyguards to Mr. Russell and Miss Evelina too?"

Mara had no reply.

With no available rooms, she was relegated to the staff quarters.

As soon as they stepped into the lavish suite, Aurora wasted no time and immediately laid claim to the grandest bedroom-without so much as a word to anyone.

It happened to be the room Jasper had specifically arranged for Evelina.

Just as Jasper's patience wore thin, Aurora put on a pitiful face and murmured, "I'm really sorry, but my skin is extremely sensitive. I can't stay in regular rooms... would it be alright if I took this one?"

Evelina offered a calm, almost amused smile. "You're awfully fragile. Perhaps it's best you stayed in the comfort of your home instead of putting yourself through all this hardship."

Without sparing Aurora another glance, she gently linked her arm through Jasper's. "Come on, Jasper.Since there are only two rooms in this suite, looks like we'll have to bunk together."

"What?" Aurora's face twisted further in disbelief. "You're telling me the two of you are sharing a room?"

She was stunned. The upscale suites she had visited always had multiple bedrooms. How had thigs escalated to Evelina and Jasper ending up in the same one?

That shameless woman! She'd stop at nothing to get Jasper's attention!
###Chapter 86 I Want Evelina Dead


"Didn't you request the master bedroom for yourself, Aurora?" Evelina asked smoothly."That leaves only the spare room for us."

The setup in a modest four-star hotel like this one typically included a presidential suite with just two bedrooms.

"That can't be right," Aurora replied, pacing the suite. Yet, it was true-there were only two bedrooms.

Unwilling to see Evelina and Jasper share a room, she managed a forced smile and suggested, "There's also a meeting room, a study, and even a staff room. You're strong, Evelina-surely you can manage one night in less comfort?"

Her tone was patronizing, as though she was extending a kindness to Evelina.

Evelina's laughter was brief and mocking. "Perhaps you should take one of those rooms? Or is it that you're too delicate, and I should endure because I'm just the tough one who can handle it?"

Aurora, accustomed to praise and comfort, found herself at a loss for words in the face of such frankness.

"I didn't mean that-" Aurora responded, flustered.

Evelina interrupted her sharply, "Remember, Jasper was reluctant to even let you stay. I was the one who persuaded him to show you some hospitality."

Evelina pushed Aurora aside gently and strode confidently into the master bedroom, hauling her suitcase."You're just a guest here, and you dare to demand privileges? You can share this room with me or try to fit into the other one with Jasper. Or, take your pick from those other spaces you suggested."

With a definitive bang, Evelina's words were punctuated by Jasper shutting the door of the other bedroom.

Aurora was out of options. It was either share the room with Evelina or spend the night on the floor. With a clenched jaw, she slammed the door shut behind her.
Internally, Aurora seethed with anger. She thought, "You'll regret this. You won't even see the dawn."

Exhausted from the day's events, Evelina didn't hesitate to prepare for bed, grabbing her pajamas and heading for the shower.

"By the way, Aurora-I snore, grind my teeth, hog the blankets, and might even chat in my sleep.Hope that's not a problem," Evelina called out nonchalantly.

After her shower and a quick hair dry, she donned her sleep mask and earplugs, and wasted no time in getting into bed.

Meanwhile, Aurora was left stewing in front of the vanity, her makeup not yet fully removed.

Earlier, she had attempted to snoop through Evelina's suitcase while she showered, only to find it securely locked with a password. To her shock, a failed attempt at guessing the combination resulted in a mild electric zap, causing her to drop the suitcase in pain.

Now,seeing Evelina asleep, she reached for Evelina's phone.

Recently, she had noticed that Jasper seemed particularly fond of Evelina, and she desperately needed to gauge the depth of their relationship.

However, as she reached for thephone resting on the nightstand, a loud alarm erupted fromn it.

Startled, Evelina sat up swiftly, removing her sleep mask and fixing Aurora with an intense stare. "What are you doing?"

Aurora, caught off-guard, stammered, "I was just reaching for a tissue, and your phone... it was an accident." She quickly grabbed a handful of tissues and retreated to the bathroom.

An accident? There were tissue boxes all over the room, yet Aurora chose to reach for the one next to Evelina's phone?

Evelina chose not to confront Aurora directly. Instead, she tucked her phone under her pillow and settled back into bed.

She knew she had to stay alert; Aurora was likely up to something. Inside the bathroom, Aurora seethed, her anger barely contained. She wished she could lash out at Evelina this very moment.

She took out her phone and hastily sent a message to a hidden contact, saying, "Change of plans. Make it an hour earlier. I want Jasper to be mine, and for Evelina to be out of the picture for good."
###Chapter 87 Take Them Both


Around 2:00 AM, when most people were deep in slumber, thick smoke suddenly filled the hotel, and a piercing siren shattered the stillness.

The hotel's soundproofing was poor. Footfalls thudded along the corridors, joined by frantic voices yelling,"There's a blaze! Move now!"

Evelina hadn't been sleeping deeply-something had kept her half-awake. She snapped to attention before most.

Throwing off the covers, she slid into the footwear she'd smartly left beside her and decided to find Jasper.

But as soon as she pulled open the door, she ran directly into his chest.

He'd just stirred from sleep as well. Driven by instinct, he had come to check on her barefoot, urgency overriding preparation.

"There's something off about this," Evelina said sharply. "This was orchestrated."

Before she could elaborate, heavy banging erupted from the door.

A stranger shouted from the hallway, "Fire emergency-open up! We'll escort you to safety!"

Without missing a beat, Evelina pushed Jasper back into his room, voice low but commanding. "Get your shoes."

Then, adopting a drowsy tone, she called out, "Wait, we're changing! A fire? In Eastmere's damp chill?Where's the source?"

The voice outside faltered, struggling to answer.

They knew then: there was no inferno-only a ploy to flush out occupants.

"Come on already!" the man snapped, irritated. "Forget your belongings-we're talking survival here!" r had already pulled on his footwear and retrieved the emergency rope he'd hidden earlier.
d memorized their exit options in advance. Their balcony offered a direct path to the lot below.

cured one end of the cord and gave the other to Evelina. "You first."

nts like these left no room for indecision. Every heartbeat mattered.

st as Evelina stepped toward the ledge, Aurora emerged from the main bedroom in her luxury othes.

r! What's going on? What are you doing? Where are you taking her?" she gasped, her gaze locked on as she reached out and grabbed the latter's wrist.

s.heart seethed with bitter resentment. In this life-and-death moment, Jasper only thought to take away, completely disregarding Aurora's presence in the very same room! Did her survival truly mean ?

faint beep sounded at the door-an electronic keycard.

r was outside had access-and they were coming in.

anked her arm free and shoved Jasper toward the opening. "Climb down. I'll handle this." a painful yelp as her face struck the tiles.

Seconds later, the door burst open and a group of masked intruders flooded into the room.

Evelina reacted instantly-she swept the legs of the first two attackers, sending them crashing down and throwing the others off balance.

It bought Jasper just enough time to land below. Evelina heard the soft thump of his descent and allowed herself a moment of relief.

But the men were enraged. "Damn it, one slipped past us!" one shouted.

Thinking quickly, Evelina gestured toward Aurora and said with icy calm, "She's the one who helped him escape. Don't blame me."

Had Aurora not barged in at the worst possible moment, they both might have escaped unnoticed.

And who's to say the woman hadn't sabotaged it deliberately?

Before Evelina could utter another word, the barrel of a gun was pressed against her forehead."Shut your mouth," the man snarled. "Take both of them."
###Chapter 88 Hostage Game


Within minutes, the majority of guests-Evelina and Aurora included-had been corralled into the cavernous hotel lobby under armed supervision.

Noticing Cary among a clique of well-heeled young men didn't surprise Evelina; they were obvious targets for tonight's robbery.

What did catch her off-guard, however, was the presence of lan and one of Jasper's bodyguards, subdued among the captured.

A covert glance from lan was all Evelina needed to realize their capture was strategic, aligning with Jasper's plan to undermine the robbers from within.

Masked and menacing, the robbers ordered the guests into segregated groups by gender,saying,"Put your hands on your heads! Down on the floor! Give up your valuables if you want to live."

Donned in knight masks, two robbers circulated through the crowd with large sacks, aggressively collecting phones and other valuables from the frightened guests.

Men received somewhat lenient treatment; sluggish responses earned them punches or kicks.

Conversely, the treatment of women was merciless. Despite surrendering their belongings, each was thoroughly searched.

When Evelina's turn arrived, she cleverly stepped back and pushed Aurora slightly forward to gauge her reaction.

Her motive was clear-to ascertain whether Aurora was complicit in the orchestration of the robbery.

Mara, Aurora's bodyguard, leapt to her defense vehemently. "Stay away from her! Do you even know who she is?" she said, offering herself in Aurora's place.

Her protest was swiftly silenced by a harsh slap from the gang leader. "Her identity is irrelevant here,"he 
retorted dismissively. He then signaled for both Evelina and Aurora to step forward for a more thorough inspection.

Evelina's striking features carried a fierceness that overshadowed Aurora's refined grace, causing heads to turn just from the heat of her gaze alone. The masked men tasked with frisking the women eyed them hungrily, anticipation vivid in their expressions.

Yet,the man approaching Aurora held back, hands hovering without daring to touch.

In stark contrast, Evelina's searcher lunged eagerly, reaching greedily toward her chest with a twisted grin.

But Evelina moved first-her hand shot forward, gripping his wrist with brutal precision.

A stomach-turning crack echoed sharply as the man's wrist twisted out of alignment. He cried out,collapsing in agony.

Swift as a flash, Evelina grabbed his other arm, wrenching it harshly behind him, then yanked his handgun free.

Pressing the weapon fiercely against his temple, she shouted decisively, "Nobody make a move!" She glanced urgently across the room. "Mara! Get Aurora away from here,hurry!"

A stunned silence gripped the robbers-and Mara and Aurora too.

That wasn't part of their carefully rehearsed plan.

"Exactly as I suspected," Evelina said coldly.

But before she could elaborate, Mara moved suddenly, clamping her hands viciously around Aurora's neck.

"Did you figure it out?" Mara sneered, casting aside all pretense. "No sense in keeping up the charade anymore."

She nodded sharply to her accomplices.

lan and the bodyguard reacted instinctively but found themselves quickly subdued and restrained.

"Let my man go, or they all die!" Mara shouted at Evelina, her voice like steel. Had it been Aurora alone, Evelina might have gambled. But the sight of lan and the bodyguard under threat made her falter. Reluctantly, she lowered the gun.

The freed robber didn't hesitate-he slammed a brutal kick into Evelina's stomach, knocking her violently onto the floor.

Mara strode forward, standing arrogantly over Evelina's fallen form."When exactly did you realize | was on the wrong side?" She paused briefly, then answered her own question smugly."Doesn't matter now. You clever types always meet a bad end."

"Mara!" Aurora gasped, betrayal burning in her eyes."Grandmother trusted you to protect me! How could you side with these criminals?"

Mara gave a sharp snort. "Babysitting the Marsh family? The pay's a joke. This gig? It will set me up for the next three lifetimes."

She gestured toward Aurora dismissively.-"Tie her up tight. The Marsh heiress from lreah should fetch a tidy billion easily."

Aurora lunged desperately at Mara, hurling curses, but was quickly silenced by a rough gag.

With a calculating glance, Mara indicated Cary and the other wealthy heirs. "Those spoiled brats over there should each bring three or five hundred million. No negotiation needed."

Her gaze swept coldly over the remaining hostages. "As for the extras-knock them out, dump them in the kitchen, and burn the building. Bullets cost money."

Slowly,her attention returned to Evelina,contemplating her fate aloud. "What about you, though?"

Mara raised her gun deliberately, aiming it directly at Evelina's forehead. Her voice resonated ominously through the room. "Come out, Mr. Russell! The game's over-if you want your precious little princess to stay alive, show yourself now!"
###Chapter 89 Half A Billion


An eerie stillness gripped the luxurious hotel lobby.

With the gun pressed firmly against Evelina's forehead, Mara called out Jasper's name twice, her voice echoing-but he remained absent.

"Seems your precious Mr. Russell doesn't value you after all," Mara mocked bitterly. In a burst of fury, she fired a shot directly at Evelina's feet.

This wasn't an act. The gun was loaded, and she was fully prepared to pull the trígger.

The bullet shattered the polished marble, scattering fragments wildly. Hostages in the kitchen erupted in screams of terror, one even fainting from the shock.

Yet Evelina responded with a laugh, "I was nothing more than a passing distraction. What exactly did you think you'd achieve by threatening him with my life?"

She knew Jasper wasn't abandoning her; he was simply biding his time.

Her role now was simply to stall.

"So you're just someone insignificant in his eyes?" Mara sneered, clicking the hammer back. "Guess it's time toend this nonsense."

Evelina stood motionless, her eyes closing.

"No-don't shoot her!" Cary's voice trembled as he spoke up.

Mara turned the gun toward him, amused contempt clear in her eyes. "And who are you to her? Trying to be a hero now?"

"She's... she's my wife," Cary stammered, barely audible.

Mara's expression twisted mockingly. "Your family won't mind handing over half a billion then, right?" Cary faltered, clearly stunned by the number. "Couldn't we maybe negotiate something lower?"

"Funny." Mara laughed scornfully. "Didn't you just say she was your wife? Isn't she worth every penny?"

Cary's hesitation was plain, disgust evident in his tone. "We're divorcing."

Five hundred million? He wouldn't even offer half as much to rescue his first love,let alone Evelina.

That sort of cash could buy him several new wives without batting an eye.

Returning her venomous gaze to Evelina, Mara sneered, "Pathetic. Your ex-husband won't pay, your lover won't appear. Why even bother keeping you alive?"

Her words bit harshly,yet Evelina met them unflinchingly.

Instead,her eyes flicked discreetly to Aurora.

She noticed something odd-a hint of triumph flashed briefly across Aurora's features.

Most hostages facing death would tremble, terrified their captors might execute them regardless of ransom.

But Aurora? She actually dared to smirk.

As Mara's finger tightened on the trigger, Aurora's hidden satisfaction became clearer still.

Aurora clearly wanted Evelina out of the picture.

"Hold on!" lan's sharp voice cut through the tension.

Eyes unwavering,he faced Mara directly. "Five hundred million? My family will cover it."

"You?" Mara laughed hesitantly, examining him skeptically. "An assistant carrying around that much cash?"

Yet lan exuded an authority that he'd clearly absorbed from his years beside Jasper.

"Depends on who I assist. Mr. Russell doesn't just manage the Russell Group; he controls various international companies too. My family has significant shares in all of them."

In short, lan was far more than Jasper's mere assistant-he was his financial partner. Although not widely known in lreah, the Payne family's global investments were considerable. Even Kristina's illustrious family might not match up. lan's high-level connections added further weight to his words.

"Well, look at you. Didn't peg you for someone with that kind of cash," Mara sneered, thrown off just like everyone else in the lobby.

Especially Cary,whose disbelief bordered on comical. Jasper's assistant casually pledging half a billion?

Abruptly,Mara swung the gun, striking Evelina viciously with its butt.

Evelina turned swiftly, avoiding the worst, but stil felt the blow tear into her forehead, blood trickling down her face.

"You shameless bitch!" Mara shrieked furiously. "Seducing Jasper wasn't enough- you had to go after his assistant,too?"

lan's fists clenched impulsively, ready to retaliate, but Evelina's firm glance steadied him.

Mara was baiting them into losing control. Reacting impulsively now would ruin Jasper's carefully orchestrated plan.

Adopting Mara's earlier sneering tone, Evelina retorted sharply, "Feeling insecure, Mara? Jealous someone's willing to shell out half a billion for me? Sounds like you speak from experience. How many buyers have you entertained for cash?"

Evelina assessed Mara coolly, contempt lacing every word. "Even if you stripped, no one would pay to look at someone like you."

Her words sliced through Mara but were directed subtly toward Aurora.
###Chapter 90 Two People, Only One Choice!


Evelina shot Aurora a look laced with scorn, igniting a fiery mix of humiliation and rage in the latter's chest.

No one but Aurora understood the lengths she'd gone to in order to win Jasper's affection.

Seething, she locked eyes with Mara, who raised the grip of her weapon, poised to strike Evelina once more.

But this time, Evelina was ready.

Despite having her arms bound behind her, she launched her head forward, crashing it into Mara's face before the blow could land.

The collision was brutal and took Mara by surprise.

Blood spilled fromn her nostrils, and the world spun around her.

Nearby captors cursed under their breath, stepping in to make Evelina pay.

But she met their threats with defiance and a smirk. "Half a billion is riding on my safety. Who among you is bold enough to touch me?"

Any harm to her, and that fortune would be lost forever.

lan felt a mix of admiration and frustration-why antagonize them now?

Still, he had to intervene. "Mara, you know Mr. Russell doesn't forgive. If Evelina gets hurt, you're finished."

Jasper was obsessively territorial. Anything that once belonged to him remained off-limits-even if he'd let it go.

And Evelina had been the first to truly spark his desire.

"So what? If he's so powerful, let him show up and save her!"

Although her bleeding had stopped, Mara's fury had only grown. She leveled the gun at Evelina's face, growling, "Jasper, if you're so brave, come out now-or I'll end her!"

This time, the threat was real. Her expression was murder itself.

Even Evelina felt a wave of dread, as if death were brushing against her skin.

"Enough!" Jasper's voice rang out, clear and commanding.

He appeared without warning, like a force of nature, and Aurora's envy ignited like dry tinder.

What spell had Evelina woven around him?

Was he seriously risking everything for her?

"Stay back, or she dies!" Mara's confidence cracked the moment she locked eyes with him.

"Set her free, and I'll grant you a clean end," Jasper warned, his tone glacial and unrelenting.

Mara's grip faltered as she asked, "Where are your men?"

She had kept count-Jasper had arrived with lan and four guards.

Now she held lan and one of them. But where were the others?

"Why don't you guess?" Jasper answered coolly. At that moment, two masked figures staggered in, bringing with them a wounded man.

A bullet had torn through his forehead; his mask lay shattered, and life was slipping from him.

He was Mara's cousin. Their eyes met one final time before his went dim.

"Angelo! No! Wake up!" she screamed, her voice breaking, tears flowing uncontrollably.

The ones who brought him in pointed accusing fingers at Jasper. "It was him! The Russell family's bodyguards killed Angelo and freed the captives in the kitchen!"

Consumed by grief and fury, Mara aimed at Jasper. "I'll shoot you myself!"

Instantly, three crimson dots marked her forehead-snipers had her in their sights. Mara froze, unable to move.

"Let them go," Jasper commanded, glancing coldly at Angelo's corpse. "Or you'll share his fate."

"Don't move!" barked another kidnapper, gun trained on lan and the remaining guard.

The rest followed suit, weapons drawn on Cary and the other high-profile hostages.

The tension thickened-neither side dared to act first.

"Alright, I'll release them," Mara said coldly, shattering the silence as she shoved Evelina and Aurora toward Jasper. "Two lives on the line-you get to save just one. Choose now, and the other one dies on the spot!"Her unhinged laughter rang out like a warning bell. "Well, Mr. Russell, who's it going to be?"
###Chapter 91 We're Bound Together Forever


Jasper found himself trapped in an agonizing choice.

His soul was tethered to Evelina, and instinctively, he wished for her survival.

But making that call would mean condemning Aurora to certain doom.

Once the Marsh family uncovered the truth, they would undoubtedly retaliate against the Russells-and Evelina would bear the brunt of their wrath.

"Mmph! Mmph!" Aurora's mouth was bound, rendering her voiceless. Tears streamed down her face as she fixed pleading eyes on Jasper, silently urging him to choose her.

Meanwhile, Evelina remained unsettlingly serene.

Her composure irked Mara, making everyone else appear feeble and scared.

Grabbing Evelina by the hair, Mara jerked her head backward. "Aren't you terrified of dying?"

Evelina didn't spare her a glance. Her eyes stayed locked on Jasper. "If this is where I fall, will you remember me for the rest of your life?"

"Evelina!" Jasper's usual poise had vanished; worry distorted his otherwise attractive face. "I won't let you get hurt."

"But Jasper," she said, arching a brow, her gaze drifting back to Aurora. "If I perish today,you'll carry that guilt forever. No matter who stands beside you in the future, my place will never be replaced."

The deceased are often immortalized, their absence casting long shadows over the living.

Especially when their end is tied to someone else's survival.

Jasper would never forgive Aurora-not in this lifetime. The thought of marrying her would become a distant fantasy.He'd make her life unbearable.
Sensing this, Aurora frantically tried to spit the cloth from her mouth, desperate to reveal Evelina's ploy.

But Evelina gave her no room to speak, her lips curled in triumph."Jasper, does this mean we're bound together forever?"

With those words, she lunged toward a kidnapper's weapon.

The man,who had been targeting Cary, panicked and fired instinctively as Evelina crashed into him.

The blast echoed through the space, freezing everything in time.

Startled, the gunman stumbled backward.

Evelina staggered before collapsing, crimson pooling around her lifeless form.

"She's dead! Evelina's gone!" Cary was the first to cry out.

After threeyears of companionship, watching her fall like that was too much for him to process.

Following his outburst, Cary lost consciousness.

Aurora trembled with rage, but the gag silenced her. Her eyes burned with fury as they met Mara's.

Furious, Mara turned on the shooter. "You idiot! Who gave the order to fire?"

To her shock, he dodged her furious kick.

Something felt off. "Who the hell are you?" she shouted.

Right then, the lights above flickered, then snapped off completely, shrouding the lobby in darkness.

Another gunshot cracked through the silence, followed by Mara's scream as she hit the floor.

Panic broke out among the wealthy hostages. "Don't shoot! I swear I'm innocent!"

Even the criminals were gripped by fear.

A second, then a third shot rang out-each bullet finding its mark. Chaos and confusion mounted.

How were Jasper's allies able to hit targets with such precision in total darkness?

One of the criminals was the first to react, shouting,"We've got fluorescent powder on us! Take off your jackets!"

Fluorescent powder?

The others checked their clothes and saw the faint glow of particles across their gear.

They realized they had been marked as targets.

In a frenzy, they dropped their weapons, shrugged off their jackets, and searched for hiding spots.

But it was too late for many of them.

When the shooting finally ceased, a ghostly stillness settled over the room.

Some hostages had fainted, others crouched against the walls, terrified into silence.

Only four of the kidnappers remained.

They tried to slip away unnoticed, hoping the silence would fool Jasper into thinking every last kidnapper had been eliminated.

But just as they inched toward the lobby doors, the overhead lights burst on with a blinding glare.

The four men froze-completely exposed under the harsh illumination.

"Well,look who itcame a calm voice. Evelina stood tall, a sniper rifle steady in her grip, aimed directly at them.

Their eyes widened in disbelief. "You-you're still breathing? That's impossible!"

Yet there she was-not just surviving, but radiant. Aside from the streaks of blood on her clothing, not a single wound marked her body.
###Chapter 92 Queen Evelina's Warning


"Why am I still breathing?" Evelina's mouth curved into an unsettling smirk. "Because I haven't finished eliminating all of you yet."

The four kidnappers quaked, panic visible in their eyes.

Security personnel from the Russell household arrived promptly, restraining the attackers with practiced ease.



Jasper gave instructions for an in-depth investigation to identify their identities and the mastermind behind the ambush.

"Jasper, are you alright? Did you get hurt? I was really terrified..."

Aurora walked toward him, her steps elegant, voice coated in concern.

He found her presence draining but kept his reaction subtle.

Given what she'd just endured, she was understandably shaken. If she fainted again, he'd be forced to deal with the aftermath.

Crack!

A shot whizzed past Aurora's face, grazing her skin and striking the artwork behind her.

She stood frozen, paralyzed with shock.

The canvas clattered to the floor with a loud thud.

Only then did she snap out of it, turning her head in slow motion.

"Are you trying to murder me?"

Her stare-once full of pride and scorn-now flickered with genuine terror as it landed on Evelina. Oops, did I hurt you?" Evelina cooed, her tone a perfect mockery of Aurora's usual sweetness. "My bad,Miss Marsh.I thought this rifle was a replica. I didn't think it'd actuallyfire."

Pretending to be alarmed, she handed the weapon back to the guards.

She placed a hand over her heart, feigning innocence. "Goodness, that gave me a fright. Lucky no one got injured. I'm sure a refined lady like you wouldn't hold a little accident against me."

She then dashed to Jasper, playfully pouting. "This sniper isn't any fun. Next time, teach me how to hit moving targets with a pistol instead."

Her performance was so flawless, Jasper almost laughed. He patted her shoulder lightly and replied,"Sure,whatever you want."

Aurora seethed quietly, furious with jealousy.

Evelina's aim had nearly ended her life-and she had the gall to pretend it was a mistake?

That insufferable woman was sending a message: come near Jasper again, and the next bullet will land between your eyes.

And Jasper, who had seen everything, chose to ignore it.

"Aurora, you've had a rough night. You should lie down for a bit."

Instead of protecting her, Jasper seemed eager to get rid of her and instructed the guards totake her back to her quarters.

But Aurora couldn't allow Evelina to tighten her grip on Jasper.

"I'm alright. Let me stay and assist."

Jasper shut her down instantly. "Evelina and I can handle this."

He may as well have said she was irrelevant.

Aurora bit her lower lip, unwilling to back down. "Mara's assigned to protect me. I need answers. Otherwise,how will I explain this to Grandmother?" She dropped her grandmother's name, hoping it would earn some consideration.

But Jasper remained unmoved. "That's precisely why you shouldn't get involved."

Aurora's expression crumpled, eyes glassy with unshed tears. "Jasper..."

He didn't respond, and Evelina behaved as though she didn't even exist.

Just then, a guard returned holding a mask they'd found in Mara's belongings.

The material was identical to that worn by the assailants.

Though Mara had taken a bullet, she was still alive and receiving medical care as a doctor had already come to treat her wound and put her on an IV.

"Is this yours?" Evelina asked, lifting the mask to Mara's face.

It was clearly too large for her delicate features.

"I made it that size on purpose. I wanted to aim big," Mara whispered hoarsely, justifying her choice.

Locking eyes with Evelina, she asked, "When did you start plotting this?"

The plan had seemed airtight. So how had it fallen apart so completely?
###Chapter 93 Who Will Be The Next To Die


"From the instant the aircraft encountered technical issues, forcing an unplanned touchdown in Eastmere,"Evelina replied.

After examining the cockpit's damaged structure, Evelina determined it was no accident-someone wanted them grounded.

So when Jasper organized aerial extraction, she urged him to put alternative contingencies in place.

The Russell Group had no presence in Eastmere, but it had gained a foothold in the surrounding metropolitan hubs.

Jasper studied the chart and summoned reinforcements from multiple nearby regions.

Among them were troops he once led, along with physicians and elite investigators.

As the pair waited at the local airport, these units quietly made their entrance into the city.

When weather or interference prevented the helicopter's arrival, they were forced to stay overnight.

The support teams shadowed them discreetly to their lodging.

When they met Aurora, lan surreptitiously transmitted the building's blueprint to their allies.

As soon as Jasper reached his quarters, he initiated contact to finalize plans.

The quartet of protectors accompanying him and lan also took the opportunity to assess the premises.

It was then they identified intruders who had blended in under the guise of hotel employees.

After this discovery, Evelina and Jasper rested, preparing themselves for what was to come.

The ambush played out exactly as Jasper had foreseen. Had Aurora not caused a delay, Evelina would have escaped capture.
Left with few options, Jasper had to open dialogue with the abductors to keep her alive.

Had she remained free, the conflict would have ended in mere minutes.

"What a masterpoiece of manipulation," Mara said with a bitter smile, eyes gleaming with unshed tears.

Yet her spirit remained unbroken. "How did my cousin perish?"

"You led him to his end," Evelina answered flatly.

With lethal intent, Mara had ordered her cousin and two others to torch the guests she deemed disposable in the kitchen.

But Jasper's operatives were lyng in ambush.

They extracted the civilians, neutralized the attackers, and assumed their identities with masks and uniforms.

Mara's cousin had sustained fatal injuries already.

When Jasper's men retrieved him, he lacked the strength to expose the truth-and succumbed shortly afterward.

Consumed by mourning, Mara never questioned the impostors' legitimacy.

They gave Evelina the signal.

During their journey, Jasper had taught her subtle hand signs to recognize allies and communicate silently.

That's how Evelina knew she could lunge at the guns without fear.

The firearm discharged, but the, projectiles were rubber, and the"blood" that spilled was from a hidden pack handed to her in advance.

Fluorescent powder, inconspicuously applied by the disguised agents, marked the true enemies.

When the lights cut out, they lit up like targets.

"Mara, I know you have people you care about," Jasper said, giving her a final opportunity. "Name the mastermind, and your family walks free."

"I'll speak," she agreed abruptly,"but only to her."

She nodded at Evelina.

Jasper gave space, and Evelina stepped forward.

"Burn in hell!" Mara shrieked, lunging to tear at Evelina's ear with her teeth.

"Move!" Jasper yelled, kicking Mara off the stretcher. She struck the floor hard-and didn't get up.

Jasper caught Evelina, his voice tense with worry. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine," she whispered, understanding that Mara had chosen death.

Had she survived, those behind the plot would have come for her loved ones.

Evelina looked past Jasper, eyes locking on Aurora, who stood weeping with suspicious innocence. "Mara...how could you?"

Evelina stepped closer, her gaze sharp as blades. "First, it was your personal assistant, then your bodyguard.Who will be the next to die?"
###Chapter 94 Aurora's Dreams Were Doomed


Aurora felt a flicker of remorse.

But remembering Ady's lessons, she instantly composed herself, adopting a look of utter bewilderment.

Her eyes grew large, and tears streamed down her cheeks. "Evelina, how could you say that?"

"Still pretending?" Evelina snorted. "That innocent act fits you too well. Maybe you should wear it permanently."

She didn't wait for a reply and kept going. "When we were all hauled into the hotel lobby, the robbers cracked open every bag and grabbed anything they could. Every single one-except yours. Untouched. Isn't that strange?"

Aurora blinked, caught off guard that Evelina had noticed such a minor discrepancy.

She silently cursed herself for misjudging Evelina, but quickly responded, "Mara packed mine. She knew there was nothing worth stealing in it."

"Oh please," Evelina replied with a cold smirk. "Our bags were identical-same color, same shape. And somehow Mara's crew knew to skip yours? Do you think I'm an idiot?"

The criminal who ransacked the upstairs room had gone straight for her luggage.

What he didn't anticipate was the shock device installed inside. The electric jolt forced him back, and in fury,he fired a bullet into the suitcase, ruining the contents-clothing and expensive accessories alike.

The only silver lining was that the Starry Night earrings were safe with Kristina. Without them, what could she possibly present to ldris?

"Shouldn't you question the criminals instead of pointingfingers at me?"

Noticing Jasper's approach, Aurora's demeanor softened, and her voice trembled. "Evelia, I know we've had our differences, but l've let go of the past. I even stepped aside so you could be with Jasper.Why are you still attacking me?"

Evelina gave a sharp, mocking chuckle. "You let me have him? Do you hear how delusional that sounds?When exactly did Jasper belong to you in the first place?"

Aurora's expression faltered. Her intention had been to make Evelina look pety and unworthy-but somehow, the insult had ricocheted.

"If you insist on playing dangerous games, be ready for the consequences," Evelina warned. "Jasper will find out what really happened with those four criminals. And I'll be speaking with your father, Mr. Marsh. He assured me he'd keep his household in check."

Aurora stiffened, a shiver running down her spine.

She hadn't imagined Evelina would go that far-especially involving her father.

Her adoptive father was blunt and unyielding. He wouldn't hesitate to interrogate her thoroughly and hold her accountable if anything felt off.

But Evelina wasn't done. Her cold stare met Aurora's eyes. "The day I was injured, your father tried to avoid a lawsuit, so he granted me one request-no limits. You once told me I wasn't good enough for Jasper,that only someone from a noble lineage could stand beside him. Well, hear this: that someone will never be you."

Even if Aurora managed to manipulate her way into becoming Jasper's only option, Evelina would cash in that promise and make Franklin stop the marriage.

In short, Aurora's dreams of marrying Jasper were doomed-no matter how hard she schemed.

"You're using my father against me?" Aurora sputtered, shaking with fury.

Evelina's expression didn't waver. "Even if something happened to me, that promise would become part of my final instructions. It would still reach Mr. Marsh. So tread carefully, Miss Marsh."

"You... you..." Aurora's body wobbled, and she collapsed-completely overwhelmed.
###Chapter 95 A Dangerous Situation


Jasper instructed his team to escort Aurora back to her quarters to recuperate, assigning a physician to accompany her-both to safeguard her fragile state and ensure Evelina wasn't held accountable.

"You don't think I'm the type to dwell on grudges or seek petty vengeance, do you,Jasper?"

Evelina had no intention of concealing her true self from him. She believed in living boldly and authentically.

"Am I someone you'd descríbe as heartless or cruel?"

Just as Jasper wrapped up his sentence, the two shared a smile-subtle yet deeply in tune.

They were kindred spirits-loyal to their loved ones, yet merciless when facing threats.

"Mr. Russell, urgent update! While we were distracted for a split second, all four suspects took their own lives with poison."

One of Jasper's men rushed in, clearly distressed."They had capsules hidden in artificial teeth. By the time we realized it, they were gone."

With their trail suddenly going cold, the only information they uncovered was that the group operated internationally,targeting elites through intricate schemes and demanding exorbitant ransoms.

"I'll go inspect the bodies and see if anything new turns up," Evelina offered immediately.

"Go ahead. I'll reach out to Interpol-maybe they can shed light on their identities," Jasper responded.

They split up to handle their individual missions and regrouped after about thirty minutes.

"Jasper, take a look at this-"

Evelina had indeed uncovered something noteworthy.

She pointed toward one of the corpses' ankles. "They each have the same symbol: a black cloud with the word Gods inked.in red underneath." Jasper's eyes narrowed. "They're part of the Sons of the Wind."

Not taking his eyes off Evelina, hecontinued, "They're an arm of a notorious global criminal network-the Children of the Gods. They believe they're divine descendants and carry out heinous acts worldwide.The ones we just apprehended are only one unit-the Sons of the Wind faction."

"The Children of the Gods?" Evelina's breath caught. The name hit close to home. She had once crossed paths with their members when she rescued Kristina.

Back then, she'd barely survived, and the ordeal had forged a deep friendship between her and Kristina.

"This is serious, Jasper. We've stirred a hornet's nest. You need to stay vigilant. They won't back off so easily," Evelina warned.

Jasper scoffed, "You think the Russell family trembles at the feet of a criminal cult?"

If the Children of the Gods dared challenge him, they'd be dragging the entire Russell clan into battle. In essence, they were digging their own graves.

Still, Jasper was more worried about Evelina's safety."Let me assign you some security personnel," he offered.



But Evelina had always valued her independence, and the thought of guards trailing her around felt suffocating.She declined respectfully.

Jasper didn't argue, though he quietly arranged for a team of elite operatives to watch her from a distance.

Once everything.was settled in Eastmere, lan and two family guards stayed behind to coordinate with local law enforcement, while Jasper whisked Evelina away in a helicopter bound for lreah.

Aurora, uninvited but determined, declared she was coming too.

She was far too rattled to attend the upcoming finance event and just wanted to go home.

"No space left," Jasper said flatly.

Evelina, ever gracious, made a gesture. "Miss Marsh, you can share my seat if you're okay with the squeeze."

Although visibly displeased, Aurora climbed in quickly.

Jasper shot Evelina a questioning look, clearly puzzled by her offer.

Evelina glanced at Aurora's ankle, then said with a knowing tone, "Didn't you promise to take me to the hot springs tonight? Kristina's meeting us there."

Once they were in swimwear, it'd be easy to spot any telling tattoos.

Jasper smirked, barely holding back a laugh. Evelina always had a plan.

Just before the doors closed, Cary appeared out of nowhere and began forcing his way in, dramatically exclaiming, "Darling, we nearly died back there! You can't just leave mes If I vanish, what will my grandmother say?"

Before Evelina could react, Aurora stepped in and offered her seat.

"Come on, Mr. Gibson. Sit with her. You two are still legally bound, after all."

She moved aside to let Cary sit next to Evelina, and was about to position herself beside Jasper.
###Chapter 96 Her Ankle


Right when Aurora was about to take her seat proudly next to Jasper, he unexpectedly reached out and invited Evelina to sit by him instead.

Caught off guard, Aurora adopted a look of distress. "Jasper, the two of you sitting together will surely spark rumors..."

Jasper cut her off sharply, saying, "Sit down or leave. Why do you complain so much when you contribute so little?"

Rendered speechless, Aurora could only shoot Cary a pleading look, silently imploring him to intervene.

Given that Cary was Evelina's husband in name, he apparently had the authority to correct her.

Yet, Cary's timidity prevented him from uttering a single word in front of Jasper.

With no other option, Aurora begrudgingly took her seat again.

Throughout the journey, she and Cary were crammed together, each simmering in their own discontent,irritating one another incessantly.

Across from them, Evelina and Jasper engaged in cheerful conversation.

As Evelina grew weary, Jasper tenderly allowed her to lean her head on his shoulder, blatantly ignoring Cary.

Cary's frustration was evident, but a firm look from Jasper quickly silenced him.

The helicopter landed at the hot spring resort.

Kristina and Florrie greeted them,warmly linking arms with Evelina and leading her away.

Jasper had no choice but to trail behind the three, and Cary was even less able to intervene.

Cary wanted to remind Evelina of her duties as his wife, but getting close to her felt nearly impossible. Aurora looked down on his cowardice, constantly taunting him,"Isn't Evelina supposed to be your wife? Will you allow her to behave so freely?"

Fueled by anger and Aurora's provocations, Cary retorted, "Why don't you handle it if you're so capable?You criticize so easily yet can't manage your own affairs. Why lash out at me?"

Aurora was so infuriated by his words that she nearly lost her composure entirely.

Inside the changing room, Evelina, Kristina, and Florrie laughed and chatted, their voices echoing with lighthearted conversation.

In a quiet corner, Aurora hesitated to join the others in changing her clothes.

Unaware, Aurora didn't know Evelina had already messaged Kristina, plotting to find out if she had any hidden tattoos linked to the Children of the Gods.

Seizing the moment, Kristinainquired, "Miss Marsh, why aren't you changing? Are you self-conscious about your body?"

Without waiting for an answer, she boldly reached for Aurora, who quickly covered herself in defense.

Kristina then crouched down and lifted the hem of Aurora's pants.

Inspecting her ankles revealed no markings.

Perhaps Evelina's suspicions were misplaced?

"Hey! What are you trying to do?" Sensing something was off, Aurora quickly pulled her feet away, suspicion flashing in her eyes.

"Oh, gross!" Kristina recoiled with exaggerated disgust. "Your feet stink! Looks like the rumors were true."

The rumors? Who spread such rumors? Ireah's elite?

Kristina cleverly masked her intrusive search as mere high society banter.

"Do us a favor and stay away from us in the hot spring-foot odor spreads, you know."
With a mocking smile, Kristina departed, hips swaying.

Florrie, ever naive and unaware to the underlying tensions, noticed Aurora's distressed demeanor.Worrying she might be overwhelmed, Florrie comforted her, saying, "Kristina is just teasing, she means no harm.Please, don't be upset, Aurora..."

"Let's go, Florrie!" Before Florrie could finish, Kristina pulled her away briskly.

Whether or not Aurora was part of the Children of the Gods, one thing was clear-she was trouble. A sweet,simple girl like Florrie was better off keeping her distance.

The changing room fell silent abruptly.

Aurora stood there, her face pale for quite a while.

How dare they undermine her? Determined, she resolved that Evelina and Kristina would regret their provocations.
###Chapter 97 Her Beauty And Physique


The entrances to the men's and women's pools were separate, yet the pools themselves were merely divided by a fence.

Though the men and women were out of each other's sight, their voices carried over clearly.

When Evelina and her friends entered the women's section, Jasper's orders of fruit juices, wines, and snacks began to be served.

Evelina had barely touched her food on the flight from Eastmere to lreah.

Upon their arrival, Jasper, worried she might be hungry, had thoughtfully arranged a selection of her preferred snacks.

These treats were freshly prepared, emphasizing healthiness and taste.

"Everything I love is here!" Florrie exclaimed, her eyes lighting up in excitement at the sight of the treats.

With a cake in each hand, she munched away gleefully. "Uncle Jasper used to say it was too much hassle before, claiming the chef was always too busy. But now that Evelina is here, suddenly the chef finds the time?"

In a light-hearted tone, she teased Evelina, "It's clear my uncle prefers his sweetheart over his niece!"

From behind the bamboo fence, Jasper's laughter resonated. "Even surrounded by all these treats, you're still complaining?"

With a mischievous grin, Florrie stuck out her tongue.

Evelina gently cleaned the crumbs from Florrie's face, smiling warmly."Don't rush. I promise, whenever l have something good to eat, you'll always have your share."

Florrie's grin widened. "You're the best, Evelina," She then called out over the fence, "Uncle Jasper, take note! Happy wife, happy life. You should try to keep pace with Evelina."

Despite not having responded to Jasper's advances, Evelina found herself blushing at the sudden reference to them as a couple.

In an attempt to quiet Florrie, Evelina quickly pushed a piece of cake into her mouth.

Taking the comment to heart, Jasper responded earnestly, "Understood."

As Evelina's cheeks grew even hotter, she wished she could hide underwater.

Both Florrie and Kristina giggled at Evelina's visible discomfort, enjoying the rare sight of her flustered state.

Aurora entered at that moment.

A world away from the timid girl in the changing room, she slipped off her robe by the pool with quiet confidence.

Honestly,her figure was impressive-fit, yet curvy in all the right places.

"Have you seen enough?" Aurora asked with a scornful look, catching Kristina's gaze as she stepped into the water.

Kristina had a good figure too, though her chest was on the flatter side.

Stung by Aurora's derisive look, Kristina retorted sharply, "Why would I waste my time looking at you?Evelina's the one with the stunning figure, looking just as good in or out of clothes, every curve smooth and flawless."

She then called out louder for all to hear, "Mr, Russell, you've truly captured a gem in Evelina."

Despite her usual confidence in her figure, Aurora was taken aback by Kristina's harsh words, her expression contorting in frustration.

From the adjacent men's pool, a low chuckle was heard. "Evelina's beauty and physique are merely the tip of the iceberg of her qualities." "Exactly," Florrie chimed in enthusiastically.

Trying to lighten the mood, she puffed up her still-maturing chest and joked, "Kristina, do you think I could look like Evelina if I work at it for a few years?"

Kristina responded with genuine laughter, "Keep eating well, and you might stand a chance."

Their laughter filled the air once more.

Meanwhile, Aurora sat apart from the group.

Kristina and Evelina exchanged meaningful looks, having discreetly checked Aurora's skin for any signs of tattoos but finding none.

Now, they pondered their next move.

Should they attempt to remove her remaining clothes, her bandeau and shorts?

And what if they still found nothing?
###Chapter 98 Snakes


Given the circumstances, Evelina took matters into her own hands.

Realizing the potential of her location at the hot spring resort, she refused to let the chance slip by.

Evelina rose from the pool and nudged a small wooden boat brimming with exquisite desserts and red wine toward Aurora.

"Miss Marsh, perhaps you're hungry. Please, enjoy some of these treats."

With a courteous smile, Evelina filled a glass with red wine and presented it to Aurora, saying, "This wine is exceptionally good."

Evelina extended the glass to Aurora with both hands, a gesture of deep respect.

Aurora rejecting the offer would only make her appear petty.

Moreover, Jasper was within earshot on the other side of the fence, listening in.

Aurora knew better than to let her composure slip in his presence.

She gracefully accepted the wine and tasted it. "Thank you, Evelina. Clearly, you're trying to impress, but that's alright. Winning Jasper's affection does require a certain finesse, something I admit I haven't mastered."

Kristina couldn't help but scoff at Aurora's biting remark.

Was Aurora calling Evelina-a woman clearly above her-just a temptress out of jealousy, because she couldn't win over the man she wanted?

Such pettiness!

Despite her cutting remark, Aurora maintained an air of graciousness. "Nonetheless, I wish you both happiness." Her words sounded polite, but she'd already been whispering to lreah's elite women, accusing Evelina of seducing Jasper.

The local society women, unable to capture Jasper's affection themselves, refused to let a woman of Evelina's past stand without challenge.

To them, Evelina was becoming a formidable enemy.

"Your good wishes are appreciated, and I accept them." Evelina elegantly lifted her glass."Although I sense your underlying envy, that's alright. I am as accustomed to jealousy as I am to praise. Unlike you, a spoiled young woman, mastering such emotional intelligence isn't within your reach. But don't feel too bad about it."

"Hahaha!" Before she could continue, Kristina erupted into laughter.

The sight of Kristina laughing uncontrollably made Florrie lose her composure as well.

Together, they laughed so hard they nearly fell over.

Visibly infuriated, Aurora's face turned a deep shade of red.

No longer able to stay calm, she slammed the glass down and tipped over the dessert-filled boat.

Treats spilled into the water, and wine spread through the pool, turning it red.

Evelina said, "Miss Marsh, why the outburst? I'm only treating you the way you treat everyone else."

As Aurora made to leave in a huff, Evelina reached out, pulling her back into the water.

Drenched and stained with wine, Aurora emerged looking thoroughly disgraced.

However, instead of confronting the situation, she fled like she was being chased.

Evelina's confusion cleared when Florrie screamed, "Ah! Snake! There's a snake!"

Snakes here?

The resort had been operating safely for years under strict safety protocols.

How could there be snakes?

Turning swiftly, Evelina spotted several venomous snakes approaching Florrie and Kristina through the water.


Her immediate concern shifted from Aurora to aiding her friends. "Stay calm, Florie."

She intended to instruct Kristina to move Florrie to safety, but then noticed snakes near the pool's edge as well.

Perplexed by the sudden appearance of snakes in a well-kept resort, Evelina realized this had to be an intentional act.

Behind her, Aurora's panicked shouts continued as she ran, "There are snakes! Help!"

Her cries seemed desperate, but her actions spoke otherwise-likely, she was making her way to the men's pool, perhaps to draw attention away from the chaos.
###Chapter 99 Evelina, Nothing Can Happen To You!


"Back off! Get back!"

In a desperate attempt to fend off the danger, Kristina wielded a wine bottle, slashing it through the water.

Mirroring her actions, Florrie shut her eyes tight and swung another bottle across the surface.

Water flew wildly around them, yet the snakes were hardly affected. Suddenly, one snake surged out, aiming directly at Florrie's arm!

Kristina only realized the imminent danger when she saw the swift, dark shadow approaching.

Frozen with fear, Evelina acted swiftly, snatching the snake by its tail and smashing it against the poolside.

"Ah! Ah!" Florrie's shrieks of fear resonated loudly, adding to the chaos.

Evelina quickly cleared the snakes in their way, then guided Kristina and Florrie along the path Aurora had taken.

It seemed clear that Aurora was behind this; her escape path likely held the key to safety.

Convinced that Aurora, terrified of her own demise, had used a snake repellent as she fled, Evelina urged them on.

"Don't stop, just run!"

Realizing Kristina and Florrie couldn't move quickly on their own, Evelina pushed them with all her might.

She struggled but finally ushered them to safety at the pool's edge.

However, as she attempted to climb out of the pool herself, a snake latched onto her ankle.

Pain shot through Evelina's leg, rendering it numb and her powerless.

Kristina and Florrie grabbed her arms, frantically trying to pull her to safety.Yet Evelina spotted more snakes swiftly closing in. If they continued their attempt to save her, they would all be endangered.

Reluctantly, she withdrew her hand and shoved them towards safety. "Go! Forget about me!"

With her remaining energy depleted, Evelina fell back into the water.

"Evelina!" Florrie cried out, wanting to rush back into the pool to save her.

"Don't go." With a heavy heart, Kristina gripped Florrie's waist, pulling her away from the chaos.

"We can't do anything for Evelina here. We need to get help!"

This seemed like the only viable option, though Kristina doubted whether Evelina could survive that long.

Miraculously,Evelina burst from the water just as Kristina voiced her fears.

Living up to her reputation for resilience, she seized a snake and ripped it apart.

Despite her determination, the sheer number of snakes proved too much.

Almost immediately, a snake's fangs sank into her arm.

The venom quickly paralyzed her limb, and soon after, another bite struck her side.

As Evelina's sight grew foggy and she teetered on the brink of collapse, Jasper demolished the fence dividing the pools.

He leapt over the broken barrier and into the women's pool!

Meanwhile, Aurora had arrived at the men's poool.

Throwing caution and pride aside, she burst in-only to witness the man she loved putting his life on the line for someone else!

"Evelina! Evelina!" he shouted, fighting through the snakes to reach Evelina, who was nearly fainting.-

"Jasper?" Evelina's eyes barely fluttered, her vision too hazy to make out anything but the sound of Jasper's voice.
"I'm here!" Fear surged through Jasper as he saw her losing consciousness. "You haven't said yes to me yet. Stay with me, please."

However, the venom was too quick, and Evelina lost consciousness before she could respond.

"Stay with me, Evelina!" Jasper cried out in despair, his voice thick with fear.

From her spot by the ruined fence, Aurora watched, her expression twisted in fury, her hands balled into fists so tight that her knuckles blanched.

Seeing Jasper so tormented infuriated her. Why? Why should Evelina, of all people, deserve his heart?

In her mind, Evelina deserved to die.
###Chapter 100 Evelina Can't Come Today!


Jasper had applied a snake-repelling ointment while in the men's pool. Without it, he would have been at risk himself while attempting to rescue Evelina.

The time spent applying the ointment, unfortunately, delayed his intervention, allowing Evelina to be bitten before he could reach her.

The emergency medical team was prompt, providing an antivenom injection swiftly and transporting her to the hospital.

As he moved to follow, Jasper cast a dark, warning glance at Aurora, who stood near the broken fence.

The intensity of his stare struck fear into Aurora.

She had never expected such a menacing look from Jasper.

His glare sent a clear warning-if anything happened to Evelina, Aurora would pay the price.

Why should she bear the blame?

After all, she was a well-known heiress from the Marsh family in Ireah-unlike Evelina, who carried the stain of a broken marriage.

Feelings of shame, anger, and frustration overwhelmed Aurora.

Suddenly,she heard Cary's hesitant voice, asking, "Evelina's not going to die,right?"

Turning, Aurora noticed Cary skulking by the men's pool.

Angered by his cowardice, she stormed up to him and delivered a harsh kick.

"How could you just stand there? Evelina is your wife! She was bitten by a snake, and you did nothing.What a useless coward!"

Had Cary acted, Jasper might not have needed to intervene. With her anger having nowhere else to go, Aurora unleashed it on Cary with kicks and strikes.

Feeling aggrieved, Cary responded, "If you're so brave, why didn't you rescue her?"

He justified doing nothing- after all, dealing with venomous snakes wasn't something to take lightly.Their bites could kill, so of course he chose to protect himself first.

Aurora's rage was uncontainable.

Under normal circumstances, most would behave as Cary did, prioritizing their safety in the face of danger.

Jasper's willingness to endanger himself for Evelina spoke volumes about his feelings.

Jasper's strong feelings for Evelina were hard to understand, given how little time they'd known each other.

Despite Aurora's years of effort, Evelina had captivated Jasper in mere months.

Driven by those thoughts, Aurora's anger exploded, and she ended up chasing Cary down and beating him up.

She then took a photo of Cary's battered face and sent it to Esme, along with a couple of voice messages.

"I dealt with your man since he was too close to Evelina. He's learned his lesson now. Watch him closely."

"Also, I've made sure Evelina was sent to the hospital. Just act convincingly at Landen's grave the day after tomorrow. She won't be there to see it."

Two days later, the cemetery in the southern outskirts of Ireah was bustling by eight in the morning.

As per Evelina and Landen's wife's instructions, all guests, students, and media they had invited were already gathered, awaiting the apology Esme would be giving.

Esme,expected to seek forgiveness, was notably the last to arrive.

She entered even after Florrie and Aurora, who had arrived together.

Landen's youngest daughter, Gia Mitchell, was in her late teens, full of youthful energy and spirit.

She was extremely displeased with Esme. "You're the last one here. Everyone's been waiting." Unruffled, Esme retorted, "I'm here, aren't l? But where's Evelina? Why isn't she here yet? Didn't she go on and on about how much she respected her mentor? He passed away, and she didn't even attend the funeral. Now she's the one throwing this grand apology event-and she's still not here. How respectful is that?"

With a scoff, Esme added, "Maybe she's planning a dramatic entrance? She does like the limelight, after all."
