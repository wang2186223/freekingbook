###chapter 1 - Prologue

********
"Declared dead, Valentina awakens as an Alpha's wife with no memory. Trapped in a world of wolves and dark rituals, she must unravel her forgotten past before her husband's secrets—and her own rebirth—consume them all."

********
"Well, this man here is your husband and he's here to take you home."
-

Life comes at you fast. At least Goldie Everly Parson remembered that. Of course she did.
She could remember the events of the night quite vividly. 

It was her 23rd birthday party. Her best friend Blossom has dragged her out to party despite her numerous protests to have a quiet night inside the house where they could eat cake and watch a movie marathon. It had all fell on deaf ears, Blossom was bored in the house and she needed some form of entertainment, even though it was at Goldie's expense. 

Life was generally good. She had been back home in town shortly after graduating from UCLA. Her parents were happy to have her back home but she wasn't planning on staying long. Only just a few days with them before her trip. Her plan was to backpack Europe for a year like she had planned to take during her gap year and then get a job in the family business like her father had promised her. 

So far, everything was going according to plan. So when Blossom suggested that she came out just for the night, she had begrudgingly agreed. Partying was Goldie's idea of a good time but there were really no good spots in town and she tried to tell Blossom that. So she wasn't too keen on partying. But Blossom told her of a spot that opened up right at the outskirts of town and Goldie decided to go just to make her happy. 

Blossom had invited two other friends of hers. A guy named Callum who Goldie was pretty sure Blossom had not known for a month and a cousin of Callum who had decided to tag along.

That was it. 

They headed to the Nightshade bar. 

Goldie had put on her best clothes. A shimmery black open back dress she had been dying to wear and the new Louboutin heels she had been gifted for her birthday. She had let her curly blonde hair down and she put on blood red lipstick with shimmery eyeshadow. 

She looked good and she loved that she did.

Nightshade was a new bar, and even though it was literally in the outskirts of town it had more crowd than Goldie expected. So far, it exceeded her expectations. 

They had stayed longer than they had planned to since they were having a good time. The dance floor was lit and the booze had flowed freely. 

Until it was time to go home but Goldie who was supposed to be the designated driver was too drunk to drive. 

Blossom offered. Claiming she was sober even though they all knew she wasn't, she was just better at hiding it. 

They all agreed. 

What did it matter to them? 

Blossom had driven them drunk before. She had even prided herself in being the best drunk driver ever! It was a self proclaimed title that seemed to work. 

Everything had been going fine during the trip back home.

Goldie managed to keep her eyes open to keep Blossom company and the roads were free so Blossom was driving pretty good. 

But things had gone awfully wrong. That was one of the last things Goldie remembered. 

The truck, it had come out of nowhere and she barely had time to register the shock before the head on collision. 

And everything went black.

"And how many bodies were brought in at the time?!"

Dr Calloway asked as he walked into the morgue, the slight chilly crisp air that gave him the creeps hit him the moment he walked in. 

"Five."

The nurse said as they stood in front a gurney table.

"One Jane Doe. Few hours ago. She was found in the woods. Cause of death still unknown. She had no injuries."

"Interesting."

The Dr murmured as he scribbled something in his pad. 

"And the rest? I understand that there was an accident on a highway with some teens."

"Young adults sir. All in their early twenties. They were all very drunk, sustained multiple injuries, only one was brought in alive, she died a few minutes ago."

"Tragic."

The Dr murmured again. 

He walked towards a particular body and checked the name tag on it.

"Goldie Parson."

A chill ran down his bones. He touched the sheets, they rustled as he pulled them away from the upper body. There was a sour look on Dr Calloway's face. 

He knew the Parsons. Goldie's father regularly donated to the hospital's children wing. Goldie was their only child. Her parents would be devastated. He thought as he walked away, unable to bear the pain. 

"Okay. Get the table set for an autopsy. We will perform an autopsy on the Jane Doe."

The nurse nodded."

"Yes Dr Calloway."



*********************


Something smelled off. Bad, even. Her nose tingled and not in a good way. She could feel a sneeze building up. 

She sneezed. The effort alone it took racked her body. And then the commotion started. 

Loud, banging noises, someone screaming, she thought it would never end. And then she tried to move her legs but found out they were as stiff as wood. 

She opened her eyes slowly, the light slowly poured in, someone had placed something over her eyes, over her entire body, like some sort of fabric, she pulled them off with her hand. 

Even though the effort alone took more strength than it would normally have. 

She was naked under the sheets. Naked and she was aware of the fact that she was in an hospital. 

What the fuck happened?! 

She thought as she looked at the figure that was trembling from afar. 

What happened?! 

She asked herself again as everything plunged into darkness.
###chapter 2 - Jane Doe
The hospital had been in a commotion all morning. All morning since the Jane Doe had woken up. The news had spread far and wide in the hospital and people were pouring in to come get a glimpse of her. The hospital had been fighting off the press all morning, everyone wanted to see who the mysterious woman was. 

Dr Calloway didn't believe in miracles. Just coincidences. The Jane Doe was brought in dead with no apparent cause of death. That didn't mean that she was actually dead, he also didn't have a chance to examine her. Whatever it was, he was determined to believe that she wasn't really dead in the first place. 

To make matters even worse the woman was too disoriented to speak or even tell them anything tangible. She must have suffered from long term memory loss and  they were currently running a series of tests in the lab. Dr Calloway was concerned with other grim things. 

The waking of the strange woman had totally overshadowed the death of the four people who died in the car crash and he was currently on his way to pay his condolences to the Parsons who were apparently too devastated to even leave the hospital. Although the mother had insisted on seeing her daughter's lifeless body, she had passed out immediately after seeing it. Mr Parson on the other hand was quiet and stoic, his only red rimmed eyes the tell tale signs of his grief. 

It was all so awful when he thought about it. 

Even now, going to offer his condolences filled him with endless dread. He didn't know the girl, but he had three daughters, he couldn't imagine what it would feel like if he lost one of them. He would be absolutely shattered. 

As he approached them in the hallway, he could see the withdrawn, haunted looks on their faces. Mrs Parson, a small slim woman was leaning on the shoulder of her tall husband. He looked equally as weary as she did, they were waiting for the hospital to release the body of their daughter to them. 

Calloway didn't know what to say




**************




 They had run tests on her all day. She didn't know what they were for, but they made her weary, all the poking and prodding and the look they had on their faces, like she was some sort of anomaly, or miracle, the look varied depending on who was looking at her. She had to admit, it was getting sort of exhausting, but apparently not as exhausting as not being able to remember anything about herself or who she was. 

The doctor had asked her several questions about herself, yet anytime she tried to draw up an image to answer the questions she came up blank. She couldn't even piece together one coherent statement if she tried. She had no idea who she was, or what she was. When she caught glimpses of herself in the mirror all she could see was short straight black hair and bits of pale slender skin. Her arms were covered in light thin scars but she had no idea where she had gotten them from, she hoped she hadn't been hurting herself, yet something told her she would never bring herself to do that. 

After a while, a doctor came into her secluded room, he gently examined her again, this time, with a gentleness the other consultants didn't have.

"We have run a lot of tests, looks like everything is fine with you. We would send you home but unfortunately no one has come to pick you up yet."

She wanted to say something, but unfortunately she didn't know what to say, or how to say it. 

Did she have no family?!

"We have put out a report with the police department. When your family sees it, they will come for you. In the meantime you will stay here for the night while the results of your other tests come out."

The doctor patted her shoulder gently and left. She watched him leave, not a thought in her head. 




********************** 




Remington Albrecht was a very busy man. Very busy and the past few days had been nothing short of hectic. Looking for his mate and wife, Valentina Combe, took more effort than he thought. It was the second time she was going missing. The first time, she had come back on her accord, three days after he sent his pack out looking for her. She gave him no explanations as to why she left. 

He had been excited when he found his mate. The Silverback Pride pack had a long history of Alphas who had no mate or lost their mate before they could even meet them or right after they met them. Remy had hoped and prayed that this wouldn't be the same for him. His pack had no luna for years, for at least hundred years, there was no history of a luna. He had been born to a pack member, a woman his father had simply married for the sole purpose of breeding. Their union was a complicated one and his father was a very troubled man. He had spent years looking for his mate. To no avail. He died searching for his mate. 

Remy had been determined not to end up like his father, or have the same obsession with finding a mate, but in the end things had gone very differently. He found Valentina and a part of him had been hugely relieved that he wouldn't end up the same with his ancestors. Because even though he had denied and lied to himself that he didn't need a mate, he felt strangely complete when he found her. That was when he knew that he couldn't afford to lose her. 

But Valentina was different. She was cold, elusive and he knew nothing of her past. She said she was an omega, so he knew nothing of her pack origins. He had ignored all the signs and his pack was very excited and grateful to finally have a luna, regardless of the complications she came with.

They had a short engagement and got married very fast, the Luna rites proceeded fairly quickly too. Surprisingly, Valentina was the one who rushed the process, claiming she wanted to be his Luna as soon as possible so she could feel the sense of belonging and safety that came with a pack. 

He had no qualms with that, he could understand where she was coming from. She was an omega. 

Barely days after the wedding she had started acting really strange, she would receive strange calls outside the house and spend hours on a run. Then when she went missing at first he had almost gone crazy looking for her, she came back on her own accord and refused to tell him of her whereabouts. Her mind was closed off to him too, even though his mother had assured him that with time they would be able to read each other's thoughts like mates did, it never happened for them. Valentina just created more distance between them. 

And then finally when things started to look like they were normal again she went missing again, this time he felt increasingly worried because he could barely feel the mating bond between them. 

So, he had gone out himself to find her. 

And his search led him to Oak Creek, a small town at the outskirts of the city. The town was usually a drive through and a pit stop for most, since it was impossible to miss.

Barely a day in the town and he already got a lead. A woman had turned up in the hospital, the local police station had uploaded her picture on their site. By all accounts she was missing and unaccounted for. 

 He left the police station with a lead and they led him to the hospital where she was in. 

The officer looked at Remy incredulously. 

"You're her husband?!"

He asked and Remy raised an eyebrow. 

"Is there a problem?"

He asked and the cop shook his head as he glanced at him. 

Remy had handed him Valentina's driver's license and a copy of their wedding picture. The man still looked baffled. 

"Are you taking me to her or not?"

"I will. But I might need you to answer some questions."

Remy snatched the ID and picture from the man and pocketed it again. 

He sighed. 

"I already answered some questions at the station. But if you need me to answer more, then I would."

"But right now, I just want to see my wife and make sure she's safe."

The officer nodded his head. 

"Sure. I'll take you there."

Together they walked through the halls of the hospital, till they reached one of the rooms. 

A doctor in a white coat and white beards came out of the room. 

"Officer William. What brings you here?"

He asked and the officer pointed to Remy. 

"This is our Jane Doe's husband. Apparently he has been looking for her for a few days now. All his info checks out."

Dr Calloway looked up at the gigantic man in front of him. 

He was tall, at least 6'3. He had long dark hair in a low bun and deep set amber eyes. He was wearing a long dark coat despite the warm temperature. He found it hard to believe that the Jane Doe woman was the man's wife. But he trusted Officer Willian and he really knew very little about the woman. 

"Oh. Nice to meet you Mr?...."

"Remington Albrecht."

The man said and Calloway raised his eyebrow. 

An expensive name. Clearly came from old money but he strangely didn't look the part with how huge he was. He was too huge, bulky even. 

"And the woman, her name you say is?"

"Valentina Combe."

He answered and Calloway raised an eyebrow. 

"She chose to keep her last name."

Remington offered an explanation to the lingering but unasked question. 

"Right."

Calloway murmured. 

"I'll take you to her."




And he did. Remy's heart was beating wildly in his chest as they approached her room. On the way, Calloway made small talk about how she had been found unconscious in the woods and how they didn't even know the cause of her death. 

She was pronounced dead. 

It was a miracle she was alive!

The doctor said, even though Remy could detect a hint of disbelief in his statement. He kept quiet. 

It was too long. He was practically itching to see his mate. 

He couldn't wait. 

The door to a private room opened and Remy looked upon the face of a woman sitting on a bed with a badly cut short black hair that barely touched her shoulders.

Valentina. 

He thought as she finally raised her face. 

The black hair, the pale face and the bright baby blue eyes, yes, it was definitely her, but there was something about the way she looked at him that hurt him. 

No hint of recognition, no movement, not even a flinch. 

"Valentina?"

Dr Calloway tested the waters. 

She didn't speak. 

"This man here, do you recognize him? Do you recognize the name Valentina?"

After a few seconds of what seemed to be eternity she shook her head.


Remy felt his heart sink. The doctor gave him an apologetic look before turning back to her. 

"Well, this man here is your husband and he's here to take you home."
###chapter 3 - Valentina May Combe



"Husband?"

Her voice croaked. 

The doctor turned to Remy.

"You see, she lost her memory. I fear she doesn't remember anything."

Remy's eyes widened. 

"Not even her own name?"

The doctor shook his head. 

"That was why we put out fliers. Nobody had come to claim her."

"What happened to her? Will she be alright."


He sounded deeply concerned and something about the way he looked made the old doctor feel pity for him. 

"I don't know. We've done a lot of tests. And frankly, we're not sure what happened to her in the first place."

Remy nodded his head. 

"Okay. Can I take her home now?"

The doctor nodded.

"Yes. You just have to provide us with the necessary documents and sign some paperwork."

Remy nodded. 

"I will. May I have some moment alone with her first please?"

He glanced at the two men in the room and they wordlessly left. 

He looked at Valentina who had silently watched all their interaction. 

"Hi."

He greeted her with a wave. He looked around the room, it was bare, except for the hospital bed. 

She looked at him again, her eyes raking all over him, taking every inch of him in. 

Her husband?

She didn't particularly feel married. Or think that she would be. There was little she remembered but at least that was one of the things she felt she wouldn't be. 

Marriage. It sounded strange to her ears. 

The man was tall and he had the kind of rugged handsomeness about him that would have ladies swooning. He sat at the edge of her bed and she shifted farther from him a bit.

"You can't be my husband."

She murmured and he raised an eyebrow. 

"And why is that?"

His voice was surprisingly soft, non-judgmental. She wondered if that was how he truly was or he was only doing it because she couldn't remember anything or that was how he was. 

So far, throughout their brief interaction he had been surprsingly calm. A feature she was not expecting. But then again, it wasn't as if she was expecting a husband.

She shrugged.

"I don't think I'm married."

She touched her finger, where a ring would have been and it felt empty. It didn't feel familiar to her that a wedding band would have been sitting there. 

"Do you remember anything? Anything at all?"

Remy asked and she shook her head again. 

He looked at her again. 

She looked leaner, her face more gaunt and he could see the dark circles around her eyes as he looked at her closer. 

Her hair was longer when they had last seen. Past her waist.  Not that he particularly cared that she cut it but he wondered why she did in the first place. Valentina loved her hair. She wore it down most of the time and he could remember her running her hands through it all the time when she was frustrated. 

"Okay. Maybe when you get home, you'll finally remember something."

"And where is home?"

She asked and he smiled. 

"California."

Cali? 

For some reason it sounded foreign to her.

She looked up at him, now concerned. 

"Are you truly my husband?"

She asked again. 

He sighed and he brought out a picture. It was folded but he silently unfolded it for her and placed it on the bed. 

"Here."

He pulled out another stuff, an ID and he placed it on the bed too. 

She reached for the picture first. 

And she saw the two of them. She, in a white plain dress with her hair up and he in a black suit. They were in front of a cake. And it looked like a wedding picture. 

She was smiling in the picture and he was too. She had no memory of it and looking at the picture didn't invoke anything in her.
But it was real. And it was her. So she couldn't entirely dismiss it.

It also looked recent. Fairly new. 

"When was this?"

She asked as she touched the picture. 

"Three months ago. March 15th."

March. 

She was married barely three months ago. 

Oh wow. She thought as she dropped the picture.

She picked up the ID card. 

It was also hers.

Valentina May Combe. 

She was twenty - seven years old. Born in the month of September. It was her driver's license. The picture included was a pretty one. Her dark hair framing her face perfectly, her sharp eyeliner visible and a blank expression on her face. 

She touched her face. 

That was her. 

She was Valentina. 

"I believe you'd regain your memories faster at home. I think it's important that I take you back home soon."

"I'll go sign all the paperwork. You can pack your things."

He looked around the room and noticed it was empty and she was wearing a hospital gown. There was nothing to pack. 

She said no other words as he left, after telling her he'd be back. 

Valentina Combe. 

She thought again. 

Weird truly. 

In the hallway the nurses helped Remy fill out the paperwork while chatting endlessly about how it was a miracle Valentina was alive. They seemed impressed with him and he could see it in how frequently they touched his arms or laughed nervously. 

He was polite with them, his mind still riddled with unanswered questions. 

Like why he couldn't feel the mating bond. Despite the fact that she had been next to him. He wondered if her losing her memory had something to do with it. 

He truly hoped that wasn't the reason but he couldn't shake that feeling. 

And how she had ended up dead in the first place. The Dr had told her that there was no known cause of death and they were planning to carry an autopsy before she came back to life. 

So he didn't know what it was but he had some speculations.

It was obvious her death wasn't ordinary. But how was she back to life?

Was that also not ordinary?!


***************

Valentina reluctantly left the hospital with the tall stranger. Even though her mind wasn't at ease. She didn't know the man. Or who he was. 

But to be honest she didn't know anyone else either. And nothing was familiar so she couldn't tell.

He wasn't lying about being her husband, but every other information he gave her about him and herself seemed incredulous to her.

She couldn't explain it... but it didn't sound like her. 

Or remotely like anything she could do. 

But strangely, she found the town familiar. 

"Have we been here before?"

She asked as he led her into the car. Remy looked up in confusion.

"Where?"

"This town."

He shook his head. 

"Not to my knowledge. We don't live here."

He said and she slowly nodded her head.

"It looks familiar."

She murmured and Remy stared at her.

"It should be. This was the last place you were before you supposedly died."

She wanted to argue that she didn't think that was a factor but decided to let it go.

Inside the car, he pulled out a ring and gave it to her.

"Here. You left in on the dresser."

He murmured and Valentina stared at it. 

It was a wedding band.

"Did I take it off?"

She asked and he nodded.

"Yes. It's a bad habit of yours"

He sounded mildly sad about it. And she wondered if their marriage was a happy one. Even though they had both smiled and looked happy in the wedding photos, she wondered if something had changed in those three months. 

And if he had something to do with it. 

She took it from him and held it in her hands. She turned it in her fingers a few times. It was a simple thin and elegant gold band. It looked lovely. 

She wasn't going to wear it, not yet. She pocketed it. She turned to her husband and she saw that he was wearing his own band and his fists tightened against the wheel as he started the car. 

She looked outside the window as the car drove off.



*********


After hours of driving, they finally reached Hidden Hills, LA where they pulled up in front of a large sprawling mansion. Valentina rubbed the sleep from her eyes as the car approached the garage. There was a woman standing in front of the house, with another man. She didn't know who they were but they seemed to be smiling at them. 

Valentina sat up, she had slept for the entirety of the ride, despite how much she had tried to keep her eyes open and on the road. 

He helped her out of the car when the car finally halted, she reluctantly took his hand, although she didn't know why he was trying to treat her like a kid. 

"Remy!"



Remy?

She thought. So that was what they called him? He told her his name was Remington. And she had thought, what a strange name for a big guy like him. 

The woman ran towards him and threw her hands over him.

"Oh you're back. I was about to send backup."

She broke away quickly and pulled Valentina in for a hug. Valentina stood rigid and shocked as the woman hugged her warmly. 

"Oh you found her!"

Mercifully, Remy pried the woman off her.

"Mother..."

He warned slightly. He turned to her.

"This is my mother Ellen."

He pointed at the beaming woman.

"This is Kale."

He pointed to the tall rigid man standing next to him. 

"Hello."

She murmured. 

His mother looked to him for an explanation.

"I'll explain inside. We've had a long journey. I'm sure Valentina will want to rest."

The woman nodded and they all went into the house. 

Valentina admired the house. 

Just as she had suspected, he was very wealthy. The house was magnificent and there were people inside it. 

She could count at least six people who all kept coming up to her.

Whoever she was, she was important enough for them to care about her. And call her 'Luna'. 

Whatever that meant.

Remington was kind enough to tell them to back off, in the most nicest way, he told them she needed rest and she was grateful that he did. 

Finally he led her into a large sprawling room with a king sized bed with white sheets and told her that it was their room. He gently closed the door behind her after telling her that she should have some rest.

Rest?

She wondered as she looked around the room.

How could she rest. 

She went to the dresser first, seeing the small jars of cream and makeup. 

She walked to the walk in closet and found clothes. Both male and female arranged in separate corners of the closet. 

Something grabbed her attention and she went back to the room, there was a framed picture on the nightstand table. It was yet another wedding picture of the two of them.

This time they were dancing. The picture looked pretty. And special. She wished she could remember the moment.

But when she touched it she felt nothing. 

She dropped it back on the table.

Suddenly feeling very tired and very sad.
###chapter 4 - The strange luna
"You are right. It is all very strange and they have no idea how she died?"

Ellen asked her son as she watched him with pity and worry. 

"No idea. The nurses said she was dead for a few good hours before she came back to life."

Kale shook his head in disbelief. He was pacing around the room. 

"Oh that's simply impossible. Maybe her heart rate was too slow to pick up?"

"For that long?"

Remy retorted and Kale sighed. 

"You're right."

"And you say she doesn't remember anything?"

His mother asked again.

"Not even her own name."

There was silence among the three of them again as they pondered on what was happening. 

Ellen reached out to her son, her small hands grazing the calluses on his large hand 

"Oh Remy. I can't imagine what you're going through."

She murmured. 

Remy sighed. Oh he was going through a lot. A whole lot. 

"I couldn't even feel the mating bond. Still can't feel it now..."

He massaged his temple.

"I think it'll come back slowly. If she truly came back from the dead then I suppose it'll take some time before her body adjusts."

"But what do you think happened to her?! And why did she run away in the first place?"

Kale asked.

Remy wished he knew the answers to those questions. He truly wished he could answer why his mate, the one person who was supposed to love and protect him kept running away from himwith every chance she got.

He truly wished there was an answer. A right one too. 

"I don't know. But make sure everywhere is locked and guarded tonight."

"Just in case."

He added.

Kale nodded. 

"In the meantime. We will try and help her adjust. The doctor said she will regain her memory slowly in the next few weeks since there seems to be no brain damage."

"We will all help her remember. Show her all her favorite things and teach her everything all over again."

Ellen nodded. 

"Of course. We have to."

"Good. I believe she's still a bit sensitive and weary around us so let's be careful with how we speak and handle her."

"And Kale... tell everyone not to address her as Luna for the time being."

Kale's eyes widened.

"You think? You think she doesn't know?!"

"That she's a werewolf? I'm almost positive she doesn't know."

Remy mentioned as he sighed once again.

"B-b-but..."

Remy raised his hand. 

"It's only for a short time. I'll break the news to her so you don't have to worry about that. Just keep everyone who isn't you or my mother away from her for the time being."

"I'll handle everything."

They talked about mundane things that happened when he left and his mother and his Beta left the study.

When they finally left Remy buried his hands in his face. 

The goddess had dealt him a cruel hand it seemed. 

He had been elated, ecstatic even at the fact that he had a mate.

When he found her he felt whole, whole and more complete than he had ever felt. His pack had called his reign special. He was giving them their first Luna in almost a century.

Oh he got a Luna alright. Just not what he was expecting.


****************


She took a bath, the bathroom was splendid and the water was deliciously warm. After spending uncomfortable days in the hospital she felt strangely relieved to be somewhere else. Even though it was unfamiliar. She picked up a dress from the closet and a cardigan and she tried the door to exit the room and noticed that it was locked. 

Locked?! Why? Was she a prisoner here?

She asked herself as she knocked the door urgently, no one came to open the door.

Frustrated and mildly annoyed she went back to the bed and laid back in it.

She was locked in the room.

Why would he do that? 

Wasn't she his wife?

Or did he intend to keep her in the room forever?

She closed her eyes and shortly after she fell asleep. 

Remy walked in to find Valentina sleeping. Her hands folded and her breathing normal. She had changed into a dress. A light pink shirt dress that she very rarely wore. It was her least favorite dress. He wondered if she remembered that. 

In the room, he shuffled around and put some things back in their place. The whole pack house was in a flurry of activities following her arrival. The chef was preparing a feast and his mother was supervising. Unfortunately they wouldn't be able to have a big dinner as they had planned since Remy didn't want to freak her out. His mother was disappointed but she understood the plan. 

Only he and her would have dinner together that night. Everyone else would be away. 

She shifted and suddenly her eyes opened and settled on him. 

"You're awake."

He said and she sat upright.

"You locked me in here."

It sounded more of an accusation.

"I didn't want anyone to disturb you."

He explained but she didn't look convinced. 

"You said we were married. What kind of relationship did we have for me to take off my ring."

Remy opened his mouth but words failed to come out. To be honest, he had no idea. Their relationship was strained at best. 

"I-I- I can't explain it..."

Her eyes were boring into his at this point. 

"You will have to. Because I don't trust you. And everything you have been doing, up until this moment is making me uncomfortable."

Remy scoffed.

"I? I make you uncomfortable?!"

"Yes. You only tell me of our time when we were married. Nothing more. Don't I have any family? Can't I see them, instead of you?"

Remy shook his head. He put his hands on his hips as he glared at her. 

"You have no family! That's all I know."

The answer stunned her. She blinked once, twice. 

"I don't?"

Remy shook his head. 

"You don't. No family. No friends. Nobody but me."

Even though she somehow felt that he was probably telling the truth, she couldn't believe that. He could be lying. He could be very good at lying. There was no way she had no family. 

It was impossible for one not to have no family or friends. 

He was just lying to keep her in there. 

He was a liar.

She would plot her escape.

She thought as she walked away from him and into the bathroom without a word.

She locked the door behind her, panting slightly. 

She walked up to the mirror and looked at her face again. 

Oh she wished she would just remember something. Something... anything. 

It would really help.



She opted to have dinner alone in her bedroom, despite the silent protests of  her supposed husband, he had left her alone and sheate the meal alone in the room. The chef had apparently cooked her favorite meal. 

A baked rigatoni pasta with beef and tomato cream. She liked the meal, it was good, but she didn't think it was good enough to be her favorite meal. She wondered if there was a meal she would like and her mind wandered towards Chinese food. 

She suddenly craved a warm hearty bowl of chicken noodle soup with a side of  soup dumplings. She didn't know where the craving came from but she suspected that it was her favorite food. 

She could almost taste it in her mouth, like a memory, hard to grasp, but she could feel the taste on her tongue. 

After dinner she took her plates down the grand stairs herself and navigated the large mansion just to find her the kitchen. Unlike before, nobody obstructed her path, and she met no one on the way till she finally found the kitchen by scent alone. The fragrant meal and the smell of pasta still smelled faintly in the hallways and it was what led her to the kitchen.

There, there was her supposed husband's mother in the kitchen. She was bent over the sink, washing her hands. She turned when she saw her and beamed. Drying her hands quickly and rushing to get the tray from her.

"Let me help you with that."

The woman said and Valentina murmured a thank you.

"Did you like the meal?!"

Valentina nodddd. 

"It was really good."

At least it was filling. 

The woman stared for a while before nodding. 

"That's good. It's your favorite meal."

She said and Valentina nodded again. 

Not that she could remember anything.

Remington and his mother sort of looked alike. The eye color was the same and he seemed to have inherited a few of his soft features from his mother. She was a small woman, with wrinkles around her eyes and dark brown hair spotted with grey.

She looked about her late fifties or early sixties. And there was something warm about her smile. 

"Thank you for the meal."

The woman scoffed.

"Oh I didn't make it. Chef Murray did. He makes all our food."

She looked around. There was no sign of anybody. No chef, no nothing.

The woman noticed her glancing around.

"Most of the staff stay in the annex."

She explained and Valentina nodded. 

She suddenly had a brilliant idea. 

"Is it possible for you to give me a tour? Maybe it might help me remember..."

She asked and the woman looked excited to, relieved even.

She held Valentina's hand and dragged her out of the kitchen.

"Yes. Of course yes."
###chapter 5 - The runaway and her husband
"How?! How did she go missing?!"

Remy stormed into the living room. 

His mother was sitting on a chair, distraught and flabbergasted, Kale was next to her, watching her closely, he had rushed in shortly before Remy did.

Kale silently pointed to her. 

"She raised the alarm."

"Mother? What happened?"

He pressed as he crouched next to her.

"Tell me."

His mother sighed.

"She asked me for a tour. We were out in the gardens and she said she wanted to stay out for a bit. I told I she couldn't...  but she looked so sad and then she asked for some privacy in the garden. I gave her some and went to stand by the door...."

"...Antonio called me over and I was distracted a bit, then I heard someone saying the gate had been opened. I went to check her in the gardens and found out she was gone."

"There was no one at the gate. No one on guard since you sent them all to the annex."

Kale explained and Remy groaned. He clenched and unclenched his fist. This couldn't possibly be happening. 

"What do I do?! Do I send men after her?!"

Kale asked and Remy shook his head. 

"No need. She's my mate. I'll deal with her myself."

He muttered as he stormed out of the living room.

Outside the house, he took a more relaxed pace as he walked.

He wondered if Valentina had lost her senses alongside her memory, because if she thought she was getting out of the woods easily and finding a stranger to take her to god knows where then she must have hit her head really hard. 

When the startling realisation hits her that there was no other mansion outside for miles she would come back to her senses. 

In the meantime he enjoyed the walk, while slowly and steadily following her scent.



******************

Valentina ran through the woods. She kept running, for a solid three minutes before her lungs gave out and she collapsed on the ground. Nobody was running after her, so she could take a breather. 

She had not planned her escape as well as she wanted to, but when the opportunity had presented herself, she wasn't about to lose it. 

If she did, that would mean going back to being locked in a room by her abusive husband.


And no, she wasn't about to stay in a locked room. Not anymore. 

But gods where the hell was she?

There were no other houses, no lights, she had kept off the main road to avoid being seen, but it seemed as if the woods was a more dangerous option, she was surprised that she could even see so well in the dark. 

She sat on the floor, her knees under dirt and grass and rocks and she tried to listen for cars or anything.

Nothing.

Nothing but the sound of the forest all around her. Which was beginning to sound increasingly scary.

It was probably a bad idea to leave in the dead of the night. 

She might be in the middle of nowhere for all she could tell. 

She slowly tried to stand up, her knees wobbly in the process. 

She couldn't run anymore, she had exhausted all her stamina. She would have to walk, but maybe this time she should go back to the main road. 

There was something frightening about the forest and the darkness.

She headed back to the direction that led to the road.

As expected the road was empty. It didn't even look like it was normally used. 

Maybe she was stupid to have left. 

Would she ever find someone who would help her? And if the person she found tried to hurt her, what would she do? 

She thought as she paused. 




****************




Remy followed her scent, into the woods and out of the woods, till he saw a figure on the lone road. 

He paused a bit, she looked confused and from afar she looked thin and frail. He started walking after her, slowly, hoping she wouldn't pick up the pace so he wouldnt have to run after her. 

Actually, he could use a little run, he thought as he rubbed his chin. 

After was seemed like forever, she finally turned her head and saw him straight ahead. 

She paused for a second, as if trying to see if he could help or not, he drew closer to her, then he gave a slight wave. 

She must have recognized him, because she slowly took off her shoes and broke out into a run. 

"My god. You're relentless."

He breathed as he watched her tiny legs run, barely covering a mile. 

Remy followed her, he started off with a light jog and then he increased his speed. He closed the gap between them in seconds and he got close enough to call out her name. 

"Valentina stop this!"

He called out. 

She started screaming. 

Like a maniac. Her voice was shrill and loud, Remy was distracted by the noise. He didn't think he had heard her scream before. And he wondered why the hell she was screaming. 

In one swoop, he  lifted her off her feet and threw her over his shoulder. All the weight she must have lost made her feel light as a feather. 

She started hitting his back.

"Put me down!!  Goddamn it! Put me down now!!"

"You should be grateful I came to get you. This isn't safe."

He retorted. She growled at him. 

"I don't care! I just want to be as far away from you as humanely possible."

Remy paused. Her words stung a bit. 

"Really?! And where would you go? You have nobody else but me."

"I don't believe you! You're lying!"

She attacked. 

"Now why would I lie to you?"

"I'm your husband!!!"

He answered. It was the second time he was telling her, second or third but nevertheless she didn't believe believe him. For whatever reason, she didn't believe him. 

Valentina huffed and got silent. She stopped hitting him too. 

"There's nobody here. You'd have to wander for hours before finding even a car."

She didn't reply. 

"Next time you want to escape, think very deeply about it before you put yourself in a situaution where I will have to save you. Again."

"I dont need saving!"

She scoffed. 

Remy paused, then he recklessly dropped her like a hot potato. 

She glared at him, panting slightly as she struggled on her feet. 

"Fine! You can walk back home yourself!!!"

He still held on to her hand, just to make sure she wouldn't break out in a run.

They were both silent, the two of them not saying anything as they wordlessly walked beside each other. After a short while, Remy noticed that Valentina was struggling to keep up with his pace, even though he was walking as slow as he could. He glanced at her and saw that she was tired. 

So tired that she could pass out any minute. 

Wordlessly, he pulled her to him and carried her in his arms.

"Hey!!!"

She weakly protested, but did nothing else. 

She was too tired to refuse his help. She let him carry her all the way home. 




*****************




"Dr Calloway. There are some men here to see you. They are asking about that woman."

Calloway looked up from his laptop. It was a nurse. 

"What woman?"

"The woman that was here yesterday, the one who came back from the dead."

Calloway rolled his eyes, he was about to reprimand the nurse before he decdied to let it go. 

"Who did they say they were?"

"They didn't say much and they looked suspicious so I didn't tell them anything either."

"Okay. That's good."

He murmured as he stood up from his desk. 

For some reason, he also couldn't stop thinking about the woman and the husband who had taken her away. He wondered how she was doing and the circumstances that had led to her death. 

The men outside did looking menacing, tall imposing, dressed in all black coats. They also had dark sunshades on. 

"Gentlemen. May I help you?"

He asked as he stretched out a hand. They didn't take it. None of them. 

He wordlessly withdrew his hand.

"We heard there was a body deposited at your morgue. We're here to claim the body."

Calloway raised his eyebrow.

"What body?"

He asked.

"A woman. Her name is Valentina. We're here to pick up her body."

"I see."

He murmured as he rubbed his chin.

"And who might you be to this woman?"

The man in the middle who had been talking glanced at the other men in turn before he turned back to the Doctor.

"A very close friend."

He answered. 

Calloway grimaced. 

"Sorry but the woman you're asking for left the hospital yesterday."

"Left the hospital?!"

He repeated and Calloway nodded his head.

"She wasn't dead. Just some misunderstanding. She went home yesterday."

"That's impossible!"

The man at the far end yelled.

The middle one glared at him. 

Calloway suspected something more was happening. Or going to happen.

"You are sure of this?"

One of them asked him and Calloway scoffed.

"I treated her myself. And if you bothered  to hear the local news you'd know the whole town has been talking about her all day! People thought she was dead."

After a short uncomfortable silence. One of them cleared his throat.

"Thank you doctor."

He said and they marched out of his sight.

His nurse ran up to him.

"Bizarre isn't it?!"

She asked and Calloway nodded his head.

"Bizarre indeed."
###chapter 6 - Don't meet Mr Chops
She would try running away. Another day, another time.

But for the meantime, Valentina decided on staying home. After Remy brought her back home, she had gone back to bed in shame, unable to face the questioning eyes of her mother in law or the faces that had remained outside worried about her disappearance. She slept alone on the large bed, Remy didn't speak to her for the rest of the night.

When she finally woke up, she was served breakfast in bed. A plate of scrambled eggs, toast, sausages and coffee. Mercifully, neither Ellen or Remy had come looking for her so she spent her time eating breakfast alone. Then she freshened up and changed into something much more comfortable. Some sweatpants and shirt she had found in the closet. 

She contemplated going leaving the room but was strangely worried about seeing Remy after everything that had happened. She was even worried about seeing his mother again. She had embarrassed herself by running away, with no concrete plan. 

Thankfully nothing had happened to her, but the embarrassment from last night still lingered. How Remy carried her all the way home. Although he didn't complain, she knew that his arms must have been very tired. 

She should see him at least, thank him for the night. 

She thought. 

But she made no move to stand up, she sat at the edge of the bed contemplating her choices till a knock jolted her out of her thoughts. 

"Who's that?"

She asked.

"Remy."

The husky deep voice said. 

"Come in."

She answered. 

She quickly ran a hand through her hair, she was in dire need of a proper haircut, looking at the mirror had showed her that whoever cut her hair did a shabby job at it. The ends were jarring and uneven, they made her feel insecure and her face small and round. 

Remy walked in as he shrugged his jacket off. He looked just like he looked the night before, only this time a little tired. He had his boots from last night on and the same jeans from last night too. Valentina briefly wondered if he had gotten any sleep if he was still in those jeans. His hair was in a bun at the nape of his neck, she wondered just how long it was. 

"Just here to pick up some stuff."

He murmured as he disappeared into the closet. 

Valentina waited patiently till he came back out again, this time with a fresh T-shirt in his hand and a pair of jeans.

He glanced at her. Briefly. 

"Good morning."

Valentina murmured. 

"Good morning."

He replied.

She wanted to say the words thank you. But they refused to come out of her mouth. 

"I have things to do this morning. But the doctor said you need to get back into your former routine so you can regain your memories faster, so my mother will help you with that."

"Where are you going?"

She asked out of the blue. 

Remy glanced at her. He looked like he was equally surprised by her question. 

"Errands."

"Try not to run away this time."

Valentina frowned. 

"I won't. As long as you don't try to keep me prisoner here!"

Remy scoffed. 

"You're not a prisoner."

She folded her arms and pursed her lips like a petulant child.

"I'll believe that when you actually let me leave here."

Remy raised an eyebrow.

"You're free to leave. As long as you tell me where you're going and come back home before dark."

"I shouldn't have to do all that."

Remy nodded.

"Oh you have to. Because I'm your husband and..."

He restrained himself, but Valentina saw that there was more he wanted to say. 

"What? Husband and what?"

She persisted and he shrugged as he massaged his forehead.

"Never mind."

He murmured as he stormed out of the room.




***********


Ellen came over shortly after. Happy and smiling like she had not just escaped from her grasp the night before. She didn't even as much as mention it. But she dragged Valentina out of the room saying she had something to show her. 

"Come here."

Ellen urged as she led her to the door at the end of the hallway.

"What is it you want to show me?"

Valentina asked but Ellen shook her head.

"Close your eyes. It's a surprise."

Reluctantly, she closed her eyes and let Ellen lead her into the room, she waited patiently till she heard the sound of a light switch and Ellen urging her to open her eyes. 

"Ta-da!!!!"

She screamed as Valentina opened her eyes. 

It was a room.

A painting room it seemed. 

With several covered canvases and a nice balcony with big windows.

What was she supposed to be looking at?!

She wondered as she turned to Ellen who's smile was flickering.

Ellen was patiently waiting for a reaction. Her reaction.

"It's a painting room?"


"Yes! Your painting room! Does it bring back memories?! Do you remember anything?!"


She asked eagerly and Valentina shook her head.

"I'm afraid it doesn't."

Ellen sighed. She sounded mildly disappointed.

"Well, if you weren't holed up in your room, you were always here. We could never tell what you were painting though, you rarely showed us."

She moved towards the nearest canvas and removed the tarp on it.

Ellen gasped in shock at the painting. Valentina felt uneasy.

"I-I- drew this?!"

She asked and Ellen nodded slowly, her hand to her mouth.

"I'm afraid so."


Valentina couldn't recall the feeling of a brush in her hands. Or even remotely wanting to pick up a brush. And the painting right in front of her looked too dark to be something she could draw. It was dark, incorrigible and macabre. She doubted she had anything to do with them.

She moved and uncovered all the paintings. 

They were similar in theme. Dark, barely decipherable and grotesque looking.

"Well!!! You certainly have a penchant for these..."

Ellen murmured. 

Valentina noticed her uneasiness.

"Seems like it."

She murmured.


"You said I spent most of my time here?"

Ellen nodded.

"A lot of time."

"Maybe if I paint again I'll remember it."

She murmured and Ellen nodded.

"I suppose so. You may have lost your memory but that doesn't mean you lost your ability to paint."

Ellen ran to the end of the room and grabbed a tin of paint brushes.

"Here!! Why don't you start with something?"

Well. She had nothing to do, she might as well try to remember something useful.

She accepted the tin of paint brushes and the pallet that came after. 

Ellen fussed around as she managed to set up a white canvas outside the spacious balcony for her to sit and paint.

"The sky is lovely today. Maybe you can try painting that."

She suggested as Valentina sat on the stool, her eyes on the blank canvas.


She didn't have the faintest clue to what she was supposed to be doing. 

"Okay."

She murmured as she picked up the brush. 

Ellen was behind her, her breathing audible. Valentina was strangely irritated.

"Maybe some privacy?"

"I promise I won't run away. I'd probably paint better alone."

She explained and Ellen nodded.

"Right. I'll have someone stay by the door."

She sounded mildly hurt. But Valentina didn't feel pity for her. If she was to remember, she had to get into her former routine. 

Maybe painting was the route that could help. She needed no distractions.

Ellen left, shutting the door quietly behind her and Valentina stared at the blank canvas. 

She picked up a thinner paint brush and dipped it in black.

What was she doing? She thought as she stared at the blank canvas.

She must have stared at it for hours, but it had only been five minutes, when she finally started painting, Valentina knew there was no way she was an actual painter. 

Her strokes were amateur at best and she really didn't know where or what to start. 

After a while she dropped the brush and looked at the canvas. 

What was she even trying to draw?! 

She asked herself as she tried to make meaning of the lines and strokes. 

Oh yes, the sky outside. 

What she had made looked like something a child would have scribbled on the wall. 

Well... Ellen wasn't going to like it. 

She dropped the brush and went to examine some of the finished work. Only one of them wasn't all that bad.

In fact, when she stared at it longer, she realized that it was pretty good. It was hiding at the back of the room where the supplies were, covered with tarp and dust. 

It was a painting of Remy. Valentina wondered why it was hidden, from the looks of it, it was fairly recent. In fact, very recent. It was also a remarkable painting. Remy was walking on a lone path and the shadow around him, it was a...

Valentina squinted to see if she could believe her eyes. She could. It was a wolf. The shadow around him was that of a wolf. 

She stared at it for much longer before dropping the painting. 

She looked around the room and decided it was time to leave. 

She didn't think she'd be coming back anytime soon. 

Maybe she didn't feel like painting at the moment. 

Outside the door, there was someone waiting for her just like Ellen said.

"Hi. My name is Isaac."

He said and she nodded. 

"I want to take a walk. Around the compound."

She muttered as she walked past him. He followed her. 

Valentina glanced at him.

"Are you my bodyguard or something? Why are you following me?"

She asked and he shrugged. 

"I was given strict orders not to leave you alone."

She groaned, but didn't reply. 

"Whatever then."

She finally murmured as she walked away. 

Outside the house she spotted around three people.

Two at the gate and one at the garage fixing a car.

"How many people actually live here?!"

She asked in bewilderment.

Isaac chuckled.

"A lot."

She turned to him.

"Do you live here?!"

She asked and he nodded. 

Ugh.

"It's a big house."

Isaac said and Valentina didn't reply.

She walked towards the garden again, then she heard barking and stopped.

"Is there? Is there a dog here?!"

She asked and Isaac grinned as he nodded.

"Mr Chops."

"Mr Chops?"

Valentina repeated as she tried to see if she could remember him. 

Nothing came up.

"Can I see him?!"

Isaac looked taken aback.

"You sure?!"

He asked. 

Before Valentina could reply a large grey wolf dog appeared and ran towards her.

Her eyes widened as she saw the size of it.

That was not a dog!

Was it?! 

The dog jumped on her and she patted it slowly. 

"Mr Chops?!"

She called out in surprise as she patted his head. 

No way such a scary looking dog like him was named Mr Chops. She thought as she finally smiled at him.

She crouched on the floor and petted him some more. Isaac stood rigid staring at the two of them.

"What's wrong?"

She finally asked and he shook his head.

"Nothing... it's just that... you never let Mr Chops near you."

"Why? Why is that?"

She asked as the large dog settled in her arms.

"You said you had allergies. And the last time the two of you got too close, Mr Chops wouldn't stop barking. You hated each other."
###chapter 7 - Threats, funerals and nightmares.
Valentina spent time with the dog, whom everyone looked surprised that they were playing together. Even though the dog was huge, it was still shockingly just a big baby. Like a fluffy teddy bear.

She loved him already. She couldn't fathom how or why they didn't get along before.

Ellen met her outside. Then together they walked back inside the house.

"Remy dropped this off."

She said as she pointed to a small satchel on the coffee table.

"What is it?"

She asked and Ellen showed her.

"Your phone. The police found it at the scene where your body was. They kept it with them since they opened up an investigation. But since you're awake now they handed it back to me."

Was that where Remy had gone to in the morning?

To pick up her phone?

She looked at the phone. Even with the scratches on it, it looked fairly new.

"So this is my phone?!"

She asked and Ellen nodded.

"Yes. It's fairly new. Remy got it right before you got married."

She picked up the satchel and opened it, removing the phone in it.

She tried to put it on. It didn't work.

"I think you should plug it in first."

Ellen said and she agreed, handing it over to Ellen.

Her phone.

Good. Maybe that would give her some insight as to who she was. And whatever was going on.

She watched Ellen plug in the phone and took a seat on the sofa next to it.

"It should come on now."

Ellen murmured as she handed her the plugged phone.

She smiled.

"Thank you."

"I saw you outside with Mr Chops. I couldn't believe my eyes!!"

"Isaac said we didn't get along."

Ellen nodded.

"You didn't! At all. You would scream when he got close and he wouldn't stop barking. We had to stop letting him in the house because of you."

"Woaaah."

She murmured.

"And I remember you saying you had allergies. But you still managed to pet him. Do you feel alright?"

Ellen sounded mildly concerned and Valentina stretched out her hands and checked her arms. She looked fine, she also felt fine.

"I'm fine. Thank you."

"Oh thank God then! Remy would have thrown a fit if he knew the two of you got close and something happened to you."

Valentina smiled uneasily and Ellen left her with her phone.

The phone came on, and fortunately, there was no need for a security password, the phone unlocked with her face.

She quickly went through the phone. There wasn't much to see. Almost zero contacts, expect for Remy's contact saved as Remington and Ellen's contact.

The call log was interesting to look at. At least five different unknown contacts on the last day with calls spanning over a minute.

That was the day she had supposedly died. Who were the people she was talking to?!

She left the call log and moved, then found out the only social media app she had installed was Instagram.

She rushed over to check and found out it was a page for her art that she had started a little over three months ago.

With about almost five thousand followers.

"People like this kind of stuff?!"

She murmured as she looked at the grim art she had been posting that had people following her.

She had thought getting her phone would give her answers to the questions she was asking, but it only left her more confused.

Nothing so far that was meant to help her had helped her.

She looked at the phone again and noticed that there were unanswered messages in her inbox.

She opened one.

It was just four words.

*I'm coming for you.*

What?!

Her heart skipped a beat.

She opened another.

There was nothing but a picture of some indecipherable scribbling.

What did that mean?

And there was one. Just one conversation that caught her eye.

*When will you leave him?! -  A

The contact name was saved with just the letter A. Nothing else.

She had answered with just one word.

*Soon.*

She had replied with. 

And the person had sent another text.

*You know what will happen if you don't - A

*I know. - Valentina

The conversation was a week ago. And there had been contact since then.  She wondered if the person that was being talked about was Remy. Could it be him?

Who else would it be?

During that very moment she heard his voice. He was back.

He walked into the living room and saw her phone in her hands.

"I see you got your phone."

"I did."

She answered sharply. He barely flinched.

"Not even a thank you?"

He asked and she ignored him.

Clearly something was going on between her and Remy, before she ran away. It would be wise for her to heed the warning signs.

What if she was running away from Remy?! Her husband?! What if he did something to her that made her run away from him?!

And now he was taking advantage of her memory loss to pretend that all was well between them.

"I know that look. What are you plotting?"

He asked and she jumped a little.

She had forgotten he was there.

She had simply forgotten he was there....

"Nothing."

She murmured as she left.



***************



It was Goldie Parson's funeral. The whole town was going to be attending. Calloway had not seen the Parsons since the day she died. He felt horribly bad. He had promised to see them after but work had prevented him, he wished he has taken time out to see them. 

It was a dull and dreary day, despite it being early noon the weather was dull and the clouds were dark. Everyone had gathered at the cemetery, including the Parsons who were accompanied with Goldie's grandmother from her mother's side. He paid his respects and sat two rows behind them. Shortly after, a guy in a brown coat sat next to him. He wasn't familiar and Calloway knew almost everyone in town. He had dark blond hair and golden skin, the kind that suggested that he spent a lot of time in the sun. 

"Hello."

The guy murmured, there was an handkerchief in his hand, he quickly dabbed at his eyes.

Dr Calloway turned and saw that his eyes were swollen, probably from crying. He felt pity for him.

"Friend of the deceased?"

He asked and the young man nodded.

"She was my childhood friend. I just found out late last night."

"My condolences."

Calloway murmured as he patted his shoulder.

"I'm Colin. Colin Lockwood."

He stretched out his hand and Calloway took it.

"Dr Calloway."

Cold hand, the doctor pulled away quickly.

"I learnt about the others too... I missed their funeral..."

Ah yes. The other people who died. Calloway wasn't exactly sure why Goldie's funeral had taken place so late, on a Saturday of all day. It was also a closed casket, not that he was worried about that but most people in the town opted for open casket funerals.

The priest must have had a stressful week too. Four funerals in a week, so he heard. Four funerals of four friends.

The Parsons had also mostly kept to themselves, he couldn't imagine what they would be feeling. His wife had given him a blueberry pie to hand over to Mrs Parson after the funeral gathering, but Calloway wasn't sure he was up for it.

"The Parsons. They must be devastated."

Colin finally said.

"They are. She was their only child."

Colin nodded.

"And she was full of so much life and sunshine."

There was a small smile on his face and Calloway wondered if they had ever been more than friends.

"Are you leaving after the funeral?"

He asked the young man in an attempt to make conversation. The young man shook his head.

"I'm not. This town, although it's been a long time, it has its memories. I'll stay with the Parsons for a bit. I think it'll be nice if they have a friendly face around."

Calloway was a bit relieved that the young man would be staying with the Parsons. If he would be able to bring some comfort to the Parsons then that would be nice.

"That's good. I'll see you around Colin Lockwood."

Colin nodded and smiled.

"You too.  Dr Calloway."



*******************



She had laid in bed. Just for a moment. Just to get a moment's rest and had been sucked into a nightmare.

She was in the woods.

The dead of the forests. She could hear the birds chirping and the sudden sense of foreboding, like something was calling to her.

She stood up.

Her arms felt wobbly. Like they were not hers.

She heard the leaves rustling and she turned towards it, suddenly feeling a strange urge to follow the sound.

Dead leaves crunched beneath her bare feet as she followed it, her teeth chattered with the growing cold and she wrapped her arms around herself as she followed the rustling of leaves. 

The increased her pace to keep up and she only paused when the sound stopped.

She stopped at an opening.

It was a lake.

A vast calm pool of blatant darkness. It looked frightening in the dark. 

She stopped in front of it and saw the water ripple slowly.

She peered at her reflection in the lake.

And another face stared back at her.

Shocked, she jolted backwards and looked around. There was no one around but her, who's face was staring at her?!

She felt a hand on her shoulder.

Startled, she turned back and saw the same face.

A girl, with long curly blond hair and vivid green eyes. There was a long cut on her cheeks and the more she looked at her, the more she felt she was being drained. of all her energy. 

The girl grabbed her shoulders, her wide green eyes frantic, her mouth open and Valentina screamed.


###chapter 8 - Marielle's arrival.
He had been sleeping in the guest room. In the room just down the hall when he heard Valentina  scream. He rushed into the room, this time, not bothering to knock. 

She was seated upright, in a pool of sweat, her hair plastered on her face. She had a hand on her chest and she was panting slightly. The room was unbelievably cold, despite the fact that the windows were locked. 

"What's going on?"

He asked as he rushed to her side. 

She broke her gaze and stared at him, she looked like she was suddenly coming out of whatever trance she had been in. 

"Bad dream."

She murmured. 

"Are you okay?"

He asked as he touched her shoulder slightly and she nodded. 

She went back to fluffing her pillows, as if he wasn't next to her, half naked and scared shitless that something bad had happened to her. 

"I'm fine."

She muttered as she laid back on the bed, ready to sleep.

"Okay."

Remy murmured. 

Her back was turned to him and she seemed like she was waiting for him to leave. He felt strangely hurt that she could be so cruel. 

"Okay then."

He answered in a clipped tone as he made his way to leave. 

"Remy?"

She called out when he was halfway across the room. 

Remy sighed in relief, relieved that she was coming to her senses. 

"Yes?!"

He rushed back to her side. 

She turned and looked at him, really looked at him. 

He was wearing boxer briefs and that really left nothing to the imagination. She could see everything. The outline, the shape, just everything!!!

And he was shirtless too. Upfront she could see he had a lot of tattoos, interesting ones, if she wasn't so weary of him she would actually be interested in looking at them and studying them for a long time. And his hair, oh gods his hair. 

It was the first time she had seen it loose. And the dark wet waves fell across his face and neck, just looking at it, she could tell that it was soft and sikly and she wondered how it would feel running her hands through them 

"Don't forget to switch off the lights on your way back out."

She finally said and turned back to her pillow. 

Remy stood there. Utterly dumbfounded. 

"That's it?!"

He asked incredulously and she sat upright to look at him. 

"Was there something else you were expecting?!"

She asked she raised her eyebrows and he ran a hand through his hair as he groaned. 

"A thank you maybe?"

"I practically ran across the hall when I heard you screaming. I was worried something happened to you."

"I told you, it was just a bad dream."

She answered and he glared at her. 

"Fine then."

He murmured as he walked out. 

He didn't switch off the lights on his way out. 

Valentina narrowed her eyes at him. 

"So petty."

She grumbled as she stood up and turned off the light switch herself. 




*************




Breakfast had its fair share of awkwardness the next morning. Ellen had made sure to drag Valentina downstairs for breakfast and she met Remy at the dinner table in the middle of eating a piece of toast. The table was set, the chef had made an array of eggs, waffles, toast, warm syrup, cheese, steaming black coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. 

Valentina was  famished. She and Remy had both murmured their good mornings, with her eyes avoiding his. She had found it hard getting that image of him shirtless out of her head even though she was fighting hard to forget it. 

They both said nothing else to each other as Valentina piled eggs onto her plate while Remy pretended to read the morning paper. He had put his hair back into a bun again and it looked like he had shaved. When she passed him he smelled of aftershave and mint. Fresh and clean. She was determined to ignore him all day. 

"Oh! I think I heard you screaming last night, was everything okay?"

Ellen asked and Valentina nodded. She had been thinking about the nightmare. She wondered if the girl was someone she knew. Or someone who Remy would know, but asking him would mean that she would have to have a conversation with him.

"Yes. Just a bad dream."

"Oh. I'm sorry about that..."

"Thank you."

She murmured in reply as she quickly glanced at Remy and found out that he was watching her. 

Kale came to join them at the table. He was wearing grey silk pyjamas. She didn't know who he was to the Albrechts but he seemed to be a very good friend of Remy. They talked in hushed tones when she was around and disappeared into his office together. 

"What was the dream about?"

Remy was the one who asked.

Valentina shrugged. 

"Just some girl in the woods. She grabbed me."

"Did you recognize her?"

He asked and she shot him a look. 

"If I did, would I have been screaming?!"

She retorted. Remy ignored her retort. 

"What did she look like?"

Valentina struggled to remember, the details were already getting hazy. But she remembered those eyes and the curly blond hair. 

"She had green eyes and curly hair."

"Speaking of curly hair, Marielle just called, she's coming today."

Kale interrupted. 

Remy'e eyes shot up to his friend. 

"Really? So soon?"

Kale nodded. A small smile on his face. 

"Yes. She heard about Valentina being back and decided to come home."

Ellen smiled. 

"That's good. We could really use her help around here."

Ellen looked relieved and Valentina wondered who Marielle was. They all looked happy to know that she was coming back.

"Who's Marielle?"

She asked and they turned to her. 

"She's a good friend of mine. she lives here."

Remy was the one who answered. 

Valentina poked at her food. 

"Will you be doing any painting today?"

Ellen changed the conversation as she glanced at Valentina. 

Valentina looked mortified. Oh the thought of her in that stuffy dark room with all the grotesque paintings made her want to throw up. 

She quickly shook her head. 

"Yea... I don't think I'd be doing any painting for a while."

Thankfully, Ellen didn't ask anymore questions. 

They made more small talk, with basically Kale and Remy talking about their plans for the day while Ellen pitched in once in a while. 

Valentina realised that none of them actually had a real job, or talked about having one. Sure Remy went about running his errands and Kale often spoke to him about stuff she didn't know about, she strongly believed that he didn't have a job. 

"What do you do for work?"

She asked out of the blues, her question directed at Remy. He looked surprised. 

"Me?"

He asked and she nodded as she took a sip out of her coffee. 

"You don't mention work. So I was wondering what it was you actually do."


"Real estate."

He answered. 

Valentina raised her eyebrows, a smirk on her lips. 

"Is that a fancy way of saying you're unemployed?"


She asked and Remy chuckled. 

"No. It's a fancy way of saying I'll never have to worry about money for the rest of my life."

Interesting. 

She said in her mind as she studied him. 

She had the overwhelming feeling that he was hiding something. 

All of them were hiding something from her, She just couldn't figure out what it was. At the moment. 

But till then, she couldn't trust him. She couldn't trust all of them. And even though she didn't know who or what person A was referring to in the texts in her phone, she had a strong feeling it was all about him. 







**************

Marielle's arrival brought a buzz around the house. Clearly she was special enough for everyone to like her. And for some reason, Valentina was extremely curious about her and who she was to the family. 

Marielle was stunning. She had the kind of beauty that you would see on magazine covers. Tall, lithe, with dark smooth skin that reminded her of hot chocolate and coily black hair that she let frame her face. She had strong features too. Deep brown almond shaped eyes with high cheekbones and full lips. She had the brightest smile and Valentina looked at her and Remy hug happily with an unfamiliar feeling lodged in her chest. 

Sooner than later someone knocked on her door and she tried to make herself look presentable. She had tied what she could of her choppy black hair with a hair band and had worn the pink and red dress that she found lying in the closet. 

Marielle walked into the room with Remy and she notice that the high end tall boots she was wearing made her seem as if she was on the same height with him. 

"Hi!!!!"

She squealed ashe she pulled Valentina in for a hug. 

"I was so excited when I heard the news. I'm happy you're back."

Sh sounded genuined. 

Valentina smiled uneasily. She wished she could remember her. 

"Thank you."

"What happened to your hair?!"

She asked with a small gasp and Valentina touched her hair slightly. 

She didn't know. She had no idea. Remy told her she  had long black hair but somewhere around when she ran off she must have chopped it all off. 

"She doesn't remember anything either."

He answered and Mariellle looked sympathetic. 

"I think I can still fix it a little and give you another haircut. This looks uneven."

"I appreciate that."

Valentina replied. 

Marielle, she didn't sound so bad. And the more she talked, the more Valentina ealised that she didn't actually mind her, or her company. 

It was nice having a friendly face around.
###chapter 9 - A new cut.
Marielle helped with her hair. In the bathroom, Valentina sat in front of the mirror, while Marielle stood in front of her, her eyes alert and focused. Marielle worked quickly, her fingers quick, like the hands of a professional. They didn't talk much, the only sound that could be heard was the scissors and Marielle shuffling around. Few minutes later, Valentina came out looking much better, with a better hair cut. She stared at it in awe while Marielle dusted the hair from her dress and her shoulders. 

"Thank you."

She murmured as she ran a hand through the dark strands. Something about her hair felt strangely foreign to her, like she was touching someone else's hair.  It didn't entirely feel like her hair, it felt foreign.

"It's no problem. I couldn't leave you with hair so choppy." 

Valentina smiled a little. Marielle was nice and she felt comfortable around her.  

"So, are you a friend of Remy's?"

She asked and Marielle nodded. 

"Yes. We practically grew up together. We've known each other for years."

"But don't you worry. We're not close that way if that's what you're thinking."

She added, smiling uneasily. 

Valentina didn't think they were, but she found it interesting that they had been friends for so long. She wondered how Marielle had coped with him. 

The two women left the bathroom and Marielle called someone to clean up the hair. 

Marielle talked about her trip to New York while they walked down the hallways and Valentina instantly felt comfortable with her.

When she talked she didn't even expect Valentina to reply, which was a relief because she didn't know what to say. She just felt better listening to her than talking. 

"Wow!"

Kale said as he found them in the hallway. He was wearing a simple white T-shirt and a baseball hat, he briefly pulled away his eyes from his phone to look at the impossible sight. Marielle and Valentina actually getting along!!!

"I can't believe you two are actually getting along."

Marielle nodded. 

"I am equally surprised but I'm happy we finally are."

Valentina glanced at the two of them.


"Wait. We don't get along?"

Marielle laughed uneasily. 

"Let's just say, we're not the best of friends. You were always so quiet and withdrawn and you found me loud and obnoxious."

Valentina shook her head. 

"Well, I don't think you're loud and obnoxious."

Marielle smiled but her smile didn't reach her eyes.  She looked touched but she was not convinced. 

"Thank you, but that's not what you said when you saw me a month ago."

Kale folded his arms in surprise. 

"I think I like this new version of you, let's hope you stay that way when your memories come back."

He said. 

But Marielle gave him a look and they seemed to share a quiet look in their eye that she couldn't decipher. 

"I think I'll step outside for a walk."

Valentina said as she walked past the two of them. Eager to get some fresh air. On the way, she saw Mr Chops and she cuddled him and played with him for a while before leaving for the garden. The mansion was huge and the garden happened to be one of her favourite places about it. The way the plants were arranged, the little fountain in the middle of it all and the fresh smell of flowers and clean air. 

She was learning more and more about herself everyday, but each layer she uncovered only leaves her more confused. 

Who was she?

Why did she like to draw such weird stuff?

Why didn't she get along with Marielle? Even though Marielle seemed like a perfectly nice and sensible human being. 

Why didn't she get along with the dog? 

It all felt strange to her. 

She wished there was a way to recover her memories soon enough so she would be able to understand herself better. 




*************** 




Remy watched Valentina from a distance. He saw her when she rushed out of the house and into the garden. Her hair was looking better now, It was even and straight, Marielle had done a very good job of making it even. She walked around the garden, with her dress blowing in the wind and strands of her dark hair blowing in her face. Her expression was unreadable but he could tell that something weighed heavy on her mind. He wished she would open up to him, one of these days but she treated him like he was the enemy. 

He was surprised when Kale had walked up to him and told him that he found Marielle and Valentina talking. They were getting along. 

It was interesting to hear. 

And see, but it was still a bit weird. 

He heard footsteps and turned, Marielle appeared, a demure smile on her face. 

"You should be resting after such a long journey."

Marielle sighed. 

"I wish I could rest. But there's a lot to do."

She had changed into a loose and casual dress, with fluffy slippers matching the colour of her bonnet. She stood next to him, they were inches away from each other. 

He could see the bags under her eyes, despite her bright and radiant face. She needed to rest. She was on a flight for a little over six hours, he was pretty sure she was jetlagged. There would be plenty of time to talk and catchup. 

But Marielle was relentless and when she had something on her mind, she wouldn't be able to rest until she poured it out. 

Together they both watched Valentina who was staring at the hydrangeas with a faraway look in her eyes. Marielle pitied her a little. 

"She doesn't know yet. Why haven't you told her what she is?"

Remy scoffed, he knew what Marielle was referring to. And frankly he found it a bit silly that that was what she was worried about, given everything else that had happened.



"You should see how shocked she was to hear that I was her husband at the hospital, you really think she would believe if I told her she was a werewolf?!"

Marielle shrugged. 



"You know, she will be in heat soon. And she will find out sooner than later. You should at least prepare her."

"I'll tell her when it's time. She doesn't remember anything yet."


"And if she never remembers?"

Marielle retorted.

The thought had crossed his mind many times. What if she didn't remember? The doctor had told him whatever happed to her must have bene traumatic. Foe her to have been declared dead. But what if she never recovered her memories? 

What if she never recovered her memories? Remy didn't know how he would feel about that. 

Much of who Valentina was, was unknown to him, it still was, maybe it was best she forgot that part of herself. That mysterious and elusive part that kept him and everyone in the dark. 

The new Valentina, if she ever finally trusted him, would at least not have to keep him in the dark, or hide things about her past, because she would simply have no memory of it.

"I don't know. We'll cross that bridge when we get there."

"And how was your mission?"

Marielle smirked. 

"I thought you wanted me to rest."

 Remy scoffed. 

"I'm pretty sure you've been itching to tell me since you've been back, so you might as well tell me now."

Marielle smirked, she folded her arms and frowned.

"Well, You were right about Grayson. He's a conniving bastard."

"We should have never trusted him. he's a snake and he's not on our side."

Remy scoffed. 

"Tell me something new."

He murmured. 

"But, I managed to find another way in. Another contact who tells me there's some super secret meeting a full moon from now. And I managed to snag an invite."

Remy smiled. 

That was Marielle. Spymaster of the Silverback Pride pack. While Kale was better with leadership and Remy felt comfortable enough to delegate to him and lead the pack, Marielle was the charming spy. With her, he was in the loop about everything that he had to know with the outside world.  

Everything and anything he wanted. 

Except Valentina. 

As good of a spy that Marielle was, the one tough nut she had been unable to crack was Valentina. Months ago when he had found out she was his mate, Marielle had carried out her investigations and came up with nothing. 

Nothing at all, not even a family member, or some ancestry he could trace. It was as if she never existed before. And something about that bothered him deeply, it bothered Marielle even more.

This, of course also made her upset and rubbed her the wrong way so she tried to get to know Valentina as a friend. To find out more about her, to see if she would ever spill some useful information, but Valentina wouldn't let her guard down. It wasn't long until she  discovered the game Marielle was trying to play and she started avoiding her like the plague. 

Valentina would not even give Marielle the time of the day and Marielle eventually stopped trying to be her friend. 

The two ladies never got along since then.
###chapter 10 - Stay for coffee



Goldie Parson's room remained untouched ever since she passed. It was as if it had looked like that ever since she returned from college, almost as if she was still alive and just went out for a quick cup of coffee. There were lipstick tubes on the dresser, a bottle of Victoria Secret body mist with the cap on the floor, her brush that still had her blonde curly strands of hair in it and her laptop on her unmade bed. 

The Parsons had been kind enough to let Colin have a look in the room, but now it felt like a bad idea. the room smelled soft and flowery, how he imagined that Goldie smelled before she died. The bed undone, her slippers casually lying on the floor like she had left it there. 

It was all too much. And too soon too. 

The Parsons had also offered that he could stay in their guest room, for the meantime but Colin quickly declined after seeing her room.

Her very essence still clung to the house. He could smell her, he could almost hear her laughter down the hallway. It was the house they had both grown up together in, running in the hallways while Mrs Parson yelled for them to slow down. Sleepovers in her room whenever his parents were out of town or having one fight or the other. 

All the things he could never forget no matter how hard he tried. 

"Stay for coffee."

Mrs Parson had pleaded. 

He humbly obliged. 

The two of them sat quietly across from each other. Mr Parson was away for work. Mrs Parson mentioned that he had been burying himself inside work and even more work since the incident happened. 

"Sugar?"

She asked and he nodded. 

"Two cubes please."

Mrs Parson smiled fondly. 

"I see you still have a sweet tooth."

"Always."

"You and Goldie used to get so sick eating so much sweets on halloween."

Colin chuckled. 

"We would wake up with the worst tummy aches."

"Ah yes! I'm glad you still remember. I can't seem to forget anything too."

"All day, everyday I am haunted by memories of her."

Colin nodded slightly.

"I know. It must be very hard on you."

Mrs Parson touched her face, the past few days had been hard on her. Her face seemed to have aged a decade since she got the news. 

"No on prepares for the loss of a child. No on expects it..."

"And so sudden too.."


"You know Goldie just finished college. She had so many plans."

Colin nodded.

"Yes. I was supposed to come and see her. But I had work to do, I wish I had come earlier."

He remembered the last call they had, she had repeatedly asked to see him but all he did was complain of how much work he had to do. And how he was swamped with work. He told her he wouldn't be able to see her on her birthday, she had sounded a little bit unhappy. If he had known it was her last day on earth, he would have dropped everything and made his way to her.

Mrs Parson shrugged. 

"You had no way of knowing."


"Nana took it very badly too."

Mrs Parson added, she had barely touched her coffee.

"Really? How is she now?"

Colin asked. He didn't see her at the funeral. The old woman lived in a nursing home and despite the fact that she was old and mostly sick, she and Goldie were really close. They were like two peas in a pod. 

"Oh she wouldn't come to the funeral. She believed Goldie wasn't dead. She even threw a whole fit and all, she had to be sedated."

Colin shook his head. He knew Mrs Parson had a complicated relationship with her mother. 

"That must have been very hard on you. I think Nana must have been in shock."

Mrs Parson nodded her head. 

"The doctor said she'll come around, but she promised never to forgive me for burying her."

Colin reached out and held Mrs Parson's hand. 

"If there's anything I can do to help, just know that I'm here. I'll help you."

Mrs Parson smiled and nodded. She wiped her dry eyes with an handkerchief.

"But you wouldn't stay here..."

Colin sighed. He looked around the room.

"I can't. It's too much."

"When I close my eyes I see her. I still hear her laughter, there's a lot of her here that reminds me of her and I'm not sure I'm ready to face that yet."

"I'll be close. I'll be around town and I'll visit as often as I can but I cannot stay here."

He reiterated and Mrs Parson nodded, tears blurring her vision. 

They sat together in the silence, doing nothing but just drinking coffee. 



***********


The chef had prepared a feast. Lamb roast, which was said to be Marielle's favourite. With sides of mashed potatoes, salads and fresh green vegetables. After her walk in the garden Valentina had stuck to her room, the atmosphere in the house had changed due to Marielle's arrival, there was loud laughter, more people in the yard and everyone seemed to be happy. Valentina felt she was better off staying away.

Nobody came for her till dinner time, not even Remy. He had also been equally engrossed with Marielle, she saw them talking on the balcony snd they looked so serious. When they caught her liking they went inside, with Marielle slightly waving at her. She wondered why they never dates, or if they actually did. They were close enough and by all her accounts they grew up together. Marielle was stunning and Remy was handsome, they would have made quite a gorgeous couple.

"Sit here."

Ellen murmured as she pointed at the head of the dining table, it was directly opposite from Remy, but also far away from him. Marielle sat next to his left and Kale to his right, Valentina felt left out. But she kept her mouth mute. 

Not that she cared for their little club anyways. She would still find a way to leave.


She ate her dinner quietly, while the rest made small talk.

"Are you enjoying the food? You haven't said much."

Marielle asked and Valentina shrugged. She was bored.

"There really isn't much to say."

All of the conversation did not interest her. Several times Marielle tried to pull her into the conversation and Valentina pulled herself out of it. Eventually she stopped talking to her altogether.

"Would you like to go out?? Perhaps we can go shopping for whatever you need. I know it must be tiring staying indoors all day long."

Ellen suggested and Valentina nodded. 

"I'd like that. This house can be suffocating."

She commented and Remy shot her a look.

He scoffed.

"It wouldn't be so suffocating if you actually left your room and mingled with people a bit."

He retorted. 

She glared at him as she picked up her glass of water.

"It's not that easy... striking a conversation with people you have no memory of."

"You could at least try."

He muttered. 

Marielle placed a hand on Remy's shoulder, urging him to stop. 

"Remy, you know it must be really hard for Valentina. Having such a traumatic incident then having to make friends all over again... I think she's doing great so far."

Valentina knew that Marielle was only trying to be helpful, but she didn't like the fact that she butted into their conversation. 

She ignored the two of them and stabbed at her food, turning only to ask Ellen what time they would be leaving for shopping the next day. 

"We need to leave a bit early, it's a bit of a long ride from here to the shops."

"Can I come along? I'd love to get some new stuff too."

Marielle asked and Valentina nodded. The more the merrier, Ellen would talk her ear off if it was only the two of them. 

"Sure you can."

Ellen nodded, a smile on her face.

"Excellent!" 



*********** 
After dinner, Valentina retreated to bed with a glass of wine in her hand. Remy had given her the side eye, but he didn't say anything as she disappeared up the stairs with it. She wanted to take a nap, get ready for the new day and she was also looking forward to shopping. It would be a great distraction, a welcomed one too. At least it'll take her mind off everything that has been happening. 

She couldn't wait. 

Suddenly, a wave of hot heat flashed all over her body and she held the bed stand to steady herself. 

What was that?! 

She asked herself as she placed a hand on her forehead. Hot. She was hot.
Burning hot. 

"What the fuck?!"

She murmured. 

Her annoyance building up at the sudden hike in her temperature.

What the fuck is going on?! 

She almost screamed. 

At that very moment someone barged into the room. She turned and saw that it was Remy.

He examined her from head to toe and his amber eyes grew large and bright like saucepans. Anger and frustration flashed through her eyes. He couldn't tear his eyes away from her, it was as if a deeply primal beast had stirred in him. He was all but struggling to keep himself from staying sane.

"Get out!"

She growled lowly and he sighed. 

Kale was behind him a moment later, wearing nothing but his silk pyjama shorts. 

"Fuck! Already?!"

Remy managed to force out a sentence.

"Yes. She's in heat."
###chapter 11 - Hot night.

Words were pouring out of Remy's mouth but Valentina wasn't sure she was listening. 

Words like heat, cycle, mate. She didn't understand what was going on, her entire mind was in a state of turmoil. 

And Remy was shouting! 

So loud that it was hurting her ears.

He was barking out orders to Kale while he guarded the door. 

Valentina sat at the edge of the bed, her temperature was getting worse, it felt as if she was melting, or her blood was boiling, worse, it was affecting her vision.

Her vision was not spared, everything looked red, as if she was looking through red tinged glasses.  Her ears became so sensitive.

She held her head in her hands, she closed her eyes tightly, trying to control herself. Trying to calm herself down.

In a flash Remy was by her side and she weakly protested that he let her go but he refused. He wrapped his burly arms around her and something about the simple gesture made her feel so much better. She couldn't explain why she felt better, only that something about the hug made her temperature drop.

He pulled her to the bed, with his arms still around her and her head felt so much clearer. She panted slightly as she blew the air out of her face, she felt so much better.

She opened her eyes and saw that she could see clearly, the red tinge that clouded her vision disappeared and it felt like a wave of cool air was poured all over her. 

"What?! How did you do that?!"

She asked after she garnered enough strength to talk and Remy chuckled. With him so close to her, his breath tickled her ear.

"Magic?!"

He answered sarcastically. 

Valentina rolled her eyes, then she tried to pull away from his grasp. 

"I'm serious, what happened?! And how did you do that?!"

She asked as she finally struggled out of his grasp and turned to him. 

Remy sighed, he sat upright on the bed, his fingers scratching his chin. 

"There's a lot of things I haven't told you. Things about yourself and things about us."

"And what is that?!"

She knew it! She knew he was hiding something from her. She just didn't expect that he would actually confess it himself. She wondered if he would at least be truthful about it. 

"You have to sit down for this and let me hold you unless you want to get another hot flash, you're in the first stages of heat and there will be more."

Against her better judgement, Valentina decided to trust him and she let him hold her. His large arms wrapped around her waist as he pulled her close to him. The scent of him filled the air as she wondered why she suddenly couldn't stop looking at his arms. 

Gods he was hot. He was gorgeous and the more she looked at him, the more she could feel another hot flash coming. 

What's wrong with me?! She screamed to herself and Remy shot her a look, almost as if he could tell what she was thinking. 

Did he know?! Did he know what she was thinking? 

"Relax. I know what you're going through. It's normal. It's completely normal"

"What is normal?!"

"The hot flash, the emotions... the desire..."

Valentina chuckled nervously. Desire? What the hell was he talking about?

"What the hell are you talking about?! Desire for what?"

"Desire for me. It's only natural. Trust me, it's a pretty natural feeling."

There was a silly grin on Remy's face that Valentina so badly wished to slap the grin off his face. He was looking at her smugly, almost as if he was enjoying the situation.

She quickly pulled away from him again.

He opened his mouth to protest but she raised a finger. 


"Are you going to tell me what's going on or not?!"

"I'm about to tell you..."

Remy started but she narrowed her eyes at him. 

"Get to the point."

She snapped at him.

"Okay then. You're in heat."

Heat?!

"Heat?! What is that?"

Remy ran a hand through his long silky hair.

"Like I said, it's a natural occurrence. It only happens about four times in a year. And it's very common for female werewolves."

"Female werewolves?! Are you making a joke right now? Is this funny to you?"

Valentina asked and Remy shook his head, he looked dead serious. 

"I am not joking Valentina. You are a werewolf."


*********** 




Werewolf. The word sounded foreign in her ears, but Remy made it clear that he was not joking and she had a feeling he wasn't either. He continued to tell her more unbelievable things, each one leaving her more in shock than the last. 

"This heat period, how do I get out of it."

She asked, still slightly unsure but not quite ready for another hot flash yet. 

Remy shrugged. 

"You can't. It can last for a few days. The symptoms you are experiencing now are very mild."

Valentina chuckled. 

"You call this mild?!"

"My whole body is on fire!!!"

She exclaimed. 

"I know. I know. But unless you're ready to mate with me, you're just going to have to endure it."

Valentina froze. 

"She glanced at Remy, shooting him a look that asked him to explain what the hell he was saying. 

"Mate?"

"And what does that mean?"

Remy walked to the other side of the room, his cheeks were flushed with colour. They had never talked about this, at all. None of it. And now talking about it, it was uncomfortable to say the least, especially since he wanted her. So bad it physically hurt. His wolf was practically clawing at him to get close. 

Her heat period started at dinner, but she didn't know it then.  He could smell the scent she was giving off before anybody else and he fought hard to control himself, as it got stronger he made a beeline for her when he realised she was having symptoms of a hot flash.

"Well, it means you'll have to sleep with me."

There was an uncomfortable silence between two of them. With Valentina notably silent and Remy standing and watching from the other side of the room. Her cheeks flushed as she realised what Remy meant. Oh hell no!!! She wasn't going to. 

"I don't want to sleep with you."

Ouch. 

Remy thought. 

"But your wolf does."

"I don't care what it wants. If it's even real."

She murmured to herself. She still didn't fully believe him, he didn't give her an entirely plausible explanation. 

"So, in the past... how did I get this over with?"

She timidly asked and Remy sighed... 

"Now you're asking the right questions."

"Well, physical contact helps. My presence would calm you down a lot and your wolf will at least be sated. The only problem with that is that we literally have to be together every waking moment or else you would get flare ups."

Valentina nodded. 

Physical contact. Okay, that wasn't so bad. She could do that. She would be able to do that. 

"Okay. Let's do that. You can sleep here for the meantime."

Remy rolled his eyes. 

"It is my room."

"Well, you can stay a while."




Remy watched her quietly, face flushed, hands on her waist and he realised that there was something different about her. He wished he knew what it was, but ever since she had come back, he felt like he was dealing with an entirely different person. He knew the change in attitude was due to the memory loss, but the mannerisms, the way she talked, the way she looked at him, it was nothing like the Valentina he knew. That calm calculating look she always had on her face, it was gone and it had been gone for a while.

He beckoned to her. 

"Come to bed then."

He said and he watched her crawl to the bed.

"I'm going to hold you all night, so don't freak out or anything."

 He warned and she nodded. 

"I hope you won't mind me taking off my shirt. I'm a little hot too."

Valentina shook her head, her eyes firmly on him. 

In one swift movement, Remy pulled off his T-shirt, Valentina had the immense pleasure of looking at his powerful back and the tattoos that dotted his skin. She looked away for a bit, secretly feeling ashamed for even staring in the first place. 

Remy caught her watching and smirked. 

"It's totally okay for you to feel attracted to me during this period. So don't be ashamed. You can look."

Valentina rolled her eyes. 

"Are you always so full of yourself?"

Remy shrugged. 

"Only around you."

Remy climbed into bed, enveloping Valentina into his arms in the process, Valentina stood still, rigid while his arms were around her. It was a comforting kind of feeling, and he was right when he told her that she would feel much better. 

They lay together silently, with thousands of things running through their minds,. 

"Were we in love?"

Valentina asked out of the blues. 

Remy was taken aback by the question. 

"What??!"

He asked and she repeated the question. 

He had no way of answering that. He couldn't answer it even if he tried. They were not in love, but he had hoped that they would be, that they would later fall in love. 

"No. No we weren't."
###chapter 12 - Do you Remember?
Three Days After.

Her heat period lasted for three days. Three whole days. Valentina stayed holed up in the room all day, unable to leave, or even see any one. Remy was with her throughout her entire ordeal. He was very supportive and he provide her with the comfort that she needed. She was glad of it all when it was all finally over. Even though at first she had been skeptical in the beginning when she was informed that she was a werewolf. But as she passed each stage of her heat period, the answer to her question became increasingly clear.

Remy had been with her all the night too, during the toughest moment, providing her with as much support as he could.

"There you are!"

Ellen exclaimed as she rushed towards Valentina who looked bashful. The woman looked surprisingly energetic even though it was still the early hours of the morning.

"Well, well, Aren't you a sight for sore eyes."

Ellen beamed as she touched her shoulders lightly. 

"Good morning Ellen."

"I'm guessing Remy has told you everything now."

"About me being a werewolf, yes."

Valentina watched Ellen's reaction and saw a smile on forming on the woman's face. The woman looked slightly relieved.

"I'm sure you understand why we all couldn't say anything, it wasn't in our place to."

Ellen sounded apologetic. Valentina understood, after all, Remy had warned them not to say anything.

"Yes. Of course, You'll have to listen to your Alpha. I don't blame you for that."

"Yesss! And you are his Luna. The pack missed you so much."

Valentina rolled her eyes. She doubted that. 

"Don't exaggerate Ellen, they barely knew me."

Ellen chuckled.

"Oh why would I exaggerate? Did Remy tell you about the history of our pack? We've had no Luna for decades!"

Yes. Yes, he did tell her, in fact it was one of the many stories that he had told her while she was in heat and locked up in the room.

She looked around the hallway.

"Where is Remy? I haven't seen him all day."

Ellen glanced around, she turned back to Valentina and gave her a look.

"He isn't with you?"

"No, he must have left very early in the morning."

"Oh yes. Maybe he went for his morning run. Since there's nothing to hide now, I'm sure he must miss running in his wolf form."

The woman smiled fondly and Valentina wondered what she was getting at.

"What do you mean?"

Marielle appeared from the end of the hallway. She was dressed in slacks and there was a wet towel slung over her shoulder. She approached them and waved at them. Valentina wasn't sure she was up for conversation but she waved back. 

"Nobody could run in their wolf form to risk been seen by you, especially Remy so he hasn't been on a good run in a while."

"Good morning."

Marielle murmured to them both as she inched closer.

Valentina nodded.

"Good morning."

Marielle tuned to Valentina, her face was slick with sweat and strands of her hair was plastered on her face, but she still smiled.

"I should address you properly, now that you know what you are,"

"I have no use for formalities."

Valentina replied quickly, she didn't know how she would react if everyone started calling her 'Luna'. It would be too strange for her to handle.

Marielle shrugged.

"Still, You're my Luna, I will give you the respect that you deserve."

A small blush crept to Valentina's cheeks and she looked away quickly.

She wondered what was for breakfast.

"If you insist."

She replied as they started walking towards the dining room.



****************

The mansion was bustling with movement, the news that the Luna was in heat spread far and wide and the pack members started jubilating. It was a great thing when a Luna was in heat. Heat meant that mating and mating brought along a new heir. But Valentina and Remy did not mate, while the thought had crossed her mind much more than once while they were together, her resolve was strong and she fought against the temptation.  She blamed it on the heat period, it was the only reasonable explanation for her developing such feelings for Remy in the first place. 

More people were also in the house, since they didn't need to hide or walk on tippy toes around her anymore. Valentina had hoped that the experience would somehow juggle her memory but nothing came up, nothing but the same dream. The dream of the curly headed girl with green eyes that she kept seeing. This time, she kept it to herself and she didn't tell anyone, not willing to be a burden to Remy who was constantly worrying about her and being by her side all through her heat period.

At the dinner table, she met some faces she did not recognise. They had all been eager to meet her, Ellen introduced them as core members of the pack. Close relatives of the family too, Valentina was polite to them, despite their many questions about her accident and her memory.

Her memory seemed to be a hot topic among all of them, everyone was concerned about her in that regard.

When she finally settled down, she served herself some toast and some butter. Someone brought some coffee for her from the kitchen.

Marielle sat next to her, she must have freshened up since she no longer looked sweaty and she was wearing clean clothes. She filled up her plate up with a lot more food than Valentina did.

"So, did you end up remembering anything?"

She asked and Valentina looked at her with a confused expression on her face.

"Remembering what?"

She asked and Marielle took a generous bite out of her eggs before replying.

"Your memories duh!!!"

"What else?"

"Oh."

Valentina simply said. Not knowing what to say.


"I don't remember anything."

There was a prolonged silence between the two women before Marielle continued.

"We had all thought the heat period might trigger some of your past memories and that you would remember something."

Well it did nothing. Nothing but provide her with great discomfort and more time than she cared to spend with Remy.

"Nothing happened. I still don't remember anything."

She murmured as she slammed her fork on the plate, making a loud clanging noise. Ellen turned to her with a worried look on her face, Valentina flashed her an apologetic smile.

Remy walked in around that moment, he looked straight ahead, not even sparing a glance at her. She had not noticed before, but there was an aura around him that she had no idea about. The way his presence demanded respect, demanded to be felt and seen. 

Like Marielle had mentioned he had just come back from a run, but he didn't look like it.  Although he was in clean dry clothes, a loose black shirt with grey pants, his hair still looked a little damp and the unruly strands framed his face perfectly.

Their eyes met, but that was just about all the interaction they would get. Valentina looked away quickly, colour staining her cheeks as she remembered all the nights they had to spend together bundled up in bed and touching each other and this was all a few hours ago.

Kale had walked in with him, quickly sitting next to his alpha and grabbing a piece of bread from the bread basket.

"How do you feel?"

Remy asked.

Without looking up from her food Valentina could tell that the question was directed at her.

"I feel fine."

"That's good to hear. Do you remember anything?"

'i don't."

She replied curtly and Remy nodded his head. For some reason he didn't look too surprised by her answer.

"There's a full moon approaching in about a week. Since you have no recollection of being a werewolf, Marielle will help you with shifting."

Valentina nodded. She was in no mood to argue, or ask for the specifics. She would do all that later.

"And I've decided to take you to a specialist."

She turned to look at him.

"A specialist?"

She repeated and Remy nodded.

"Your doctor recommended it. He said seeing the specialist might help you regain your memories faster."

"Okay."

"When do we leave?"

Remy's face furrowed in deep thoughts.

"I don't know yet. I have some errands to run and I'll have to schedule a meeting with the specialist first."

Valentina nodded.

"The specialist comes highly recommended. So I'm sure she'll be able to help you regain your memories."

Kale added.

After breakfast, Valentina retreated back to her room, declining the invitation of Ellen to take a walk with her.

In her room, she heard the ringing of a phone and set out to investigate.

It was her phone!

Since most of what was on the phone was strange and foreign to her, she had simply left it on the dresser.

The caller ID was unknown, but Valentina still picked the call out of curiosity.

"Hello?"

She answered.

There was no answer. Only the sound of someone breathing heavily from the other side.

"Hello?!"

She said again, this time a little bit more concerned and slightly pissed that whoever it was was, they weren't saying anything, but their breathing got louder, faster.

Fear gripped Valentina as she threw the phone on the bed.


###chapter 13 - I feel human
Valentina had fallen into a routine. With only a few days at the mansion. She woke up conveniently at the time she wanted to, she had breakfast with everyone and retreated back into her room, after freshening up she would take a walk or two. Since Mr Chops, the family dog was now allowed back into the main house, she would take him along on her walks too. She napped a lot during the day. Remy, Kale and Marielle were almost never home during the day. Everyone else was and since she was now aware of what she truly was they treated her like some sort of princess. Some of them went as far as bowing whenever they saw her. 

Ellen was constantly trying to rope her into doing stuff, but Valentina would decline whenever she wasn't feeling up to it. Especially with the strange call she had gotten two days ago, it had destabilized her. 

Something told her that she had a very dark past, one that she had even managed to hide from Remy and everyone else. 

She sometimes thought that it was a good thing that she had lost her memories. It probably was. Something or someone was after her, she didn't know who or what it was but till she found out she couldn't t trust anyone. Even Remy was a suspect, after all she had not trusted him enough to tell him whatever was going on with her. 

And looking back on all she had learned and heard, their short time together had not exactly been memorable. 

Today was a different day though, it was supposed to be a good day. 

Marielle would be teaching her how to shift, all over again. They would be spending the whole day in woods, where Marielle promise would be the best way to be connected to her wolf. 

She wondered if Remy would be joining them but she had not seen him all day, in fact, his face had been scarce the last couple of days, he seemed to have been really busy and occupied with a lot of things lately.

She wondered if he was trying to avoid her, there had been a lot of things unsaid between the two of them after her heat period. 

Marielle told her to dress as comfortably as she could, so she wore a pair of leggings and loose T-shirt. 

"We'd be in the woods for a while, it's where you'll feel the most connected to your wolf."

Marielle had said and told her to dress accordingly. She wore a pair of running shoes too, just in case they did any running. And she managed to get her really short hair into a ponytail. 


Together they went into the woods, Marielle was surprisingly so quiet for someone who was always so chatty.

She had opted for Jean shorts and from behind, Valentina had a view of her long brown toned legs, it looked like she certainly did a lot of work out. 

"So, you said I'm a werewolf, and we're all werewolves, how come I managed to forget that?!"

Valentina asked and Marielle shrugged.

"It's strange. I also don't know. Because regardless of your memory loss you should still be connected to your wolf."

"It should be a fundamental part of who you are."

She added and Valentina pondered on her words. 

Marielle's face twisted into concentration as they made their way into the woods. There was a clearing just below the hill where she said they used as a training ground. It was empty for the moment and they had full use of it for the meantime. 

She had assured her that. 

"So it's not normal that I don't remember I'm a werewolf?!"

Marielle scoffed.

"Sweetie, everything that has happened to you up until this very moment is very far from normal."

When they reached the clearing, Marielle told her to wait while she did a full sweep of their surroundings, ensuring that they were safe and there was no one around them.

One of the abilities of wolves was apparently superhearing and Marielle could pick up a heartbeat half a mile away. She could also tell who it was. If it was a werewolf like her or a human or another kind of unearthly being due to the rhythm of the heartbeat. If it was slow, it was fast, if it sounded different. All of that she could tell.
Her sense of smell was also remarkable too, just like other abilities that they possessed.

Valentina had no idea they had so many abilities. She had barely been able to use any, or even notice that something was different about her. 

She felt pretty human.

"Now, I need to know just how disconnected you are with your wolf, that would let me know how fast you can shift."

"What do you mean?!"

Valentina asked as she folded her arms.

"I mean... since it's pretty obvious that you have no idea you're a werewolf, shifting would be a lot harder."

"So I need to connect with your wolf to see if she's still in there somehow."

Valentina raised an eyebrow. She was trying to look interested but she couldn't understand what Marielle was saying, she pretended to care by nodding her head.

"Okay. And how will that happen?"

"I'll shift first."

She said as she started taking of her shorts. In a flash her shorts were down her ankle and Valentina quickly looked away.

"Woahhh!!! You should have told me about that!"

She exclaimed.

"You didn't think I was going to shift with my clothes on were you?!"

Valentina shrugged.

She hesistated.

"I mean I don't know! I kind of thought the clothes go somewhere like in limbo."

"Isn't that more comfortable than having to take them off all the time?!"

Valentina sounded concerned. Taking off clothes before every shift didn't seem comfortable enough. That meant she'd be naked after every shift. 

Yikes! 

Marielle chuckled.

"We're not magicians. We're simply werewolves. And no we cannot make our clothes go somewhere else."

"You can look."

She added and Valentina slowly turned, she turned her eyes to Marielle's face, fixating on her eyes.

"Besides, you'll grow used to seeing lots of naked bits. Nudity is a pretty normal thing when you're a werewolf."

Oh I think not!

Valentina thought as she forced a smile, she waited for Marielle to make a move. 

Marielle crouched on the leafy grass, on all fours with her back curved. 

"How long does this take?!"

Valentina asked and Marielle shook her head.

"Not long at all."

She murmured as her ankle twisted. 

Valentina jerked at the sudden movement.

Then another ankle, and then more of her bones seemed to start rearranging themselves.

The sound was horrific to hear, the sounds of bones snapping as if they were nothing but twigs on the floor. Valentina looked on in horror and shock, unable to tear her eyes away from the sight.

Her jaw slacked. That was what they expected her to do?!

That?! 

That was death!!!

She asked herself as he hands started trembling. 

Marielle became a tremendous beast. Hair grew and her coat became a deep muddy brown with patches of white, she was huge, standing at least half her height on all fours.

She had no idea they could be this huge. 

She was frozen to her feet in fear, unable to move, unable to tear her eyes away from her.

Marielle's deep black eyes pierced into hers as she took slow steps towards her. 


Valentina's breath hitched as she saw that Marielle was moving closer. Closer and closer. 

Scratch that, not Marielle, a big freaking wolf. 

If she had blinked during the transformation, she might have argued that it was someone else. Something else.

But she didn't blink, her eyes were open all through and yet she couldn't believe the tremendous beast standing in front of her.

Marielle got so close she could see the patchy white fur on her back and how her ears were raised delicately, as if she was trying to listen for something.

She raised a paw and placed it on Valentina's chest. It took all of Valentina's strength and will not to push her paw away and run screaming in the other direction.

She was terrified.

Even with the terrifying form, she could still see the look of confusion on Marielle's face as she twisted her head to the side.

Then in a second she had left her side and walked to the other end of the clearing.

She changed just as quickly as she had transformed, with Valentina transfixed at the same spot.

Still filled with the same wonder and surprise she had before. 

"So? What did you find?"

She asked as she saw that she was human again.

Marielle took a moment to answer, she was crouched on the floor, breathing heavily.

Her expression was unreadable as she put back her clothes on.

"Nothing."

She finally murmured as she walked past Valentina.
###chapter 14 - The study
"Nothing?!"

"How could you find nothing?!"

Valentina asked but Marielle dutifully ignored her, her steps quick and light as they made their way back to the mansion. She didn't even spare her a glance. 

"Can you explain what that means?"

Valentina asked as she continued to pester her with more questions. She almost tripped as she walked behind her, struggling to keep up with her pace. 

Marielle signed.

"I'm afraid I can't explain what I don't know."

"And what do you mean by that?!"

She paused as she stared at her. Marielle looked away, her eyes distant. 

"Exactly what it means Valentina."

Marielle drawled. She sounded fed up with her, but Valentina could tell something else was wrong.

How her demeanour had quickly changed, how she had suddenly turned to leave without sparing her a glance, oh something was definitely happening. She just couldn't tell what it was yet.

Since Marielle had refused to tell her.

Back at the mansion, Ellen waited dutifully at the door, with a big smile and a jug of what seemed to be freshly made juice, almost as if she had been waiting for them.

The moment Marielle set her eyes on her she made a beeline for the annex, leaving Valentina to meet Ellen.


Ellen and a bright smile of her face as she waved at Valentina to come over. 

"So tell me! How was it?!"

She asked as she put her hand around Valentina's shoulder.

"Nothing happened."

Ellen furrowed her eyebrows, she looked at her daughter in law with morbid curiosity. 

"You didn't make the shift?!"

She shook her head.

"I didn't."

Ellen sighed, she tried to make the best out of the situation. She could already see Valentina was discouraged. 

"That's okay. Nobody really ever gets it on their first try. I made you some lemonade."

"Come inside let me pour you a glass."

"That would be lovely."

Valentina muttered as she wiped her brow.

It was a long walk.  To the woods and back and she was not particularly used to walking for so long. 
Walking around the property wasn't as long or as tedious as walking in the woods. 
She had gotten tired on their way back but she didn't slow her pace because Marielle was moving so fast and she was scared of her leaving her behind.

Back in the living room, Ellen poured Valentina a glass of lemonade while Valentina looked around. 

The house looked empty. No sign of Kale. Or Remy.

"Is Remy home?!"

She found herself asking timidly. Ellen shot her a look before replying.

"He is. He's somewhere in the annex I guess. He's been there a while."

"Oh okay."

Valentina took little sips.

"What's he doing at the annex?!"

Ellen shrugged.

"He's provably fixing stuff. Or talking to the pack members. I wonder why he didn't go with you to help you shift."

She had also wondered why.

She had chalked it up to him being busy but maybe she was right about he avoiding her.

But for what reason did he have to avoid her?!

And why was he avoiding her in the first place. 

"I think I'll go lie down for a while. My head sort of aches."

Valentina murmured as she stood up with her glass of juice in her hand.

Ellen looked at her with concern and rushed to her side, she placed a hand on her forehead.

"You don't have a temperature. Is everything okay?"

Valentina politely waved her away.

"Yes. I think I'm just tired that's all."

"Well do you want something to eat? I could have someone bring some food up. The chef just made some of his famous beef roast and I could have someone bring some up for you..."

"Not now! Not now! I can't eat anything now I just want to lie down."

Valentina said a little more firmly. 

Ellen understood the seriousness in her tone and backed off.

She liked Ellen, the woman was kind and doting but she could be a little overbearing most of the time. 

She didn't like that, or particularly want someone all up in her face all the time. 

She dropped her glass of juice and started walking towards the stairs. 

Her head felt lighter, and subsequently better, but the thought of going back to her room and lying on her bed sounded boring to her. 

She was tired of just lying down on the bed. She wished she could find something else to occupy her time but whenever she thought of that dreadful art room it made her shiver. 

She still couldn't believe she painted stuff like that. 

At all. 

In the hallway she looked at the rooms, most of them she had not been inside before, especially the left wing of the house, which was mostly bustling with people she had no plans of saying hello to.  But there was a study here somehow, Remy's office where he often disappeared too and Valentina wanted to see it.

She rushed to the door and tried it, the door knob turned and the door clicked open. 

Good. She thought it was locked. 

The room was dark but she could make out the thick dark rug that covered most of the wood flooring and the shelves of books. 

There was a large grand mahogany desk in the middle and there was a large shelf that was filled with sculptures and wooden carvings. 

The wall was covered with paintings, most of them paintings of who Valentina believed to be Remy's ancestors, judging by how old they looked.

There was a MacBook on the table and Valentina rushed towards it, she sat down on the chair, the mere size of it seemed to make her look small and childish in it. 

Then she looked next to the laptop and saw a phone.

Not just any phone, her phone.

"What's it doing here..."

She murmured as she picked it up gingerly. She had not seen it in a while, that was only because she was scared someone else might call and she was avoiding it for the most part.

But why was her phone in Remy's study?!

She unlocked her phone and went through it, she found nothing strange but she knew better than that. 

If he was with her phone he must have known her password or something, or he tried to unlock her phone without her permission.

That was rude of him.

And she wondered why he would stoop so low to do something like that in the first place. 

Did he unlock her phone?! She wondered as she shook her head, still mildly confused and annoyed that he had taken it in the first place. 

******************


"You're back?!"

Remy asked as he looked up from the engine he was fixing. The car was his father, an old mustang but nobody had used it in years, not even him. He had been strolling in the garage when he saw it and suddenly wondered how it would feel to drive the car with the back open and the wind blowing in his air. 

He decided to fix it. At least it was better than staying in the main house, with Valentina being there and he not knowing the words to tell her or say to her. 

Things had been especially awkward after her heat period. 

Marielle grunted in response. He turned to look at her. 

"Pass me that rag over there."

He pointed to the sweaty towel on his workbench. Marielle picked it up and threw it at him. It landed squarely on Remy's broad chest that was slick with sweat and oil from the car. 

"Thanks."

He murmured as he cleaned his hands. 

"What happened?"

He finally asked and Marielle shook her head.

"I don't even have the words to explain it. I could barely feel her wolf..."

"What do you mean?"

Marielle sighed as she sat on the bench.

"I cannot explain it. Because I don't even understand, but her wolf is in there... she's just very weak and very dormant at the moment."

Remy was silent for a long time. Then he sighed. 

"I need to set up an appointment with the specialist then. We need to know what happened."

Marielle looked at Remy.

"Do you think seeing more humans would help?! I don't think it will."

"Why do you say so?"

Marielle shrugged. 

"This doesn't seem like something human's would understand. If we had a healer..."

Remy visibly stiffened.

"If you're about to talk about John, don't bother! I don't want to hear anything about that old worthless man."

"He's the best healer we've ever had!"

Marielle protested.

Remy scoffed.

"Best healer?! He fucking left when my father died. Some healer he is!"

"We could... we could find him..."

Remy shook his head.

"He left our pack. He's no longer a member. I'm not going to look for him and that's final."

Remy's voice boomed across the yard, Marielle straightened. She would drop the matter then.

"Okay then. Set the appointment with the human specialist. Take her there. The sooner she regains her memory the better for us."

She said and stormed away.
###chapter 15 - The curly headed girl with the vivid green eyes.
She had settled down for a nap and the girl had come again. The curly headed girl with the vivid green eyes. This time, she stood in front of her, she could see her body and not just her face.

Valentina felt a sort of familiarity with her. A sort of kindred. Like she knew her, from somewhere but she didn't know where. What if the girl was somehow connected to her, how she lost her memory and why she was in the hospital. She wondered if that was it. If that was the reason why.

She wondered who she was. And why she would not stop appearing in her dreams. 

The girl looked young, early twenties or her late teens. She had a perfectly round face, big doe eyes and Cupid bow lips. She was wearing a dress, shimmery, gold and short, it stopped at her slim thighs. Her hair framed her face perfectly, she was staring at Valentina with those piercing green eyes. 

But then she raised her hand, this time Valentina did not scream, she only watched her, her hands touched Valentina's shoulder and Valentina opened her eyes. 

The light washed in quickly and she closed her eyes as quickly as she opened them. She had left the blinds closed, who opened them? 

She thought as she sat up on the bed and slowly opened her eyes.

Remy walked out of the closet, with a shirt in his hands. He looked surprised to see her awake.

"Sorry just came to pick up some clothes."

She frowned at him in annoyance, her sleep had been cut short, she had wondered what would have happened if she touched the girl but all she did was wake up. 

"Why did you open the blinds?"

She murmured and he pointed to the room.

"It was dark and I didn't want to turn on the lights."

She sighed as she sat upright, she pulled her hair out of her face, she was pretty sure it was sticking out of her head in all places because of how short it was, that was what she had to deal with recently.

"Are you okay?"

Remy asked and she nodded.

"I'm only asking because you were stirring in your sleep. Bad dream?"

He asked again. 

She was going to reply, then she remembered how she had found her phone in his study and she had wondered what it was doing there.

She shot him a look.

"What were you doing with my phone?!"

She fired and he paused for a bit. He looked a little confused, then his eyes widened in recognition and he nodded his head.

"Ohhh... wait... why were you in my study?"

"Why are you answering my question with a question?!"

She fired back.

Remy scoffed.

"The study's off limits. Even to you."

"But my phone isn't?! Why were you touching it?!"

Remy shot her a look.

"I saw it lying around and picked it up with the hopes of giving it back to you."

"That's a lie."

She accused and Remy narrowed his eyes at her.

"I have absolutely no interest in your phone. Believe me. I saw it when it was ringing and I meant to give you but you already left with Marielle."

"I must have taken it to my study by mistake."

He explained as he rolled his eyes.

Valentina was still a little skeptical.

"It's okay if you don't believe me, but in the future stay out of my study. There's a lot of sensitive stuff there."

"The door to your study was opened."

Valentina said. Why was he asking about the stupid study? 

 There was nothing but old books and dusty figurines in the study anyways. Nothing more than that. 

"That's strange. It's always closed."

Remy murmured as he folded his shirt. 

Valentina raised her eyebrow.

"And what are you insinuating?!"

She asked and he shrugged.

"Nothing."

"I've set up an appointment with the specialist. She has an opening tomorrow morning. We have to leave this evening."

"We're taking a flight, so we'll be able to meet up with her appointment in the morning and also get some rest. So pack your stuff."

"Now?!"

Valentina asked and Remy nodded.

"Why the rush?! I thought you said the full moon is coming soon?!"

"It is. But you still have to see the specialist."

"You still haven't explained to me why you're rushing this?"

She said as she folded her arms.

Remy sighed.

"I just want you to get better soon? Is that too much to ask??"

"Better soon?! It's not like we were in love before or anything so why are you so eager about me getting back my memories?!"

She asked with a pointed look and Remy sighed.

He rubbed his temples slowly then he looked at her again.

"Because the pack depends on it."

************

The pack depends on it? What does that mean? Valentina mulled over Remy's words all the way to the airport. She didn't understand what he meant by saying that the pack depended on her memories. She wondered how that fit or how it made sense. 

They arrived late at night, and Remy mentioned something about them lodging in an hotel. 

She was tired from the flight, she didn't even mind that they were going to lodge in an hotel, or anywhere, she just wanted somewhere to sleep. For the night.

They arrived at a motel an hour later, a driver had dropped them off there. Valentina waited at the lobby and stared at her shoes while Remy talked to the woman at the receptionist desk. They seemed to be having a serious and lengthy conversation. She was almost tempted to go meet them and ask what was going on. 

Few moments later Remy came back with a frown on his face.

"They're booked for the night. They only have one room left."

Valentina raised her eyebrow.

"You're joking."

She murmured.

"Is it at least a  double bed?"

She asked him and he shook his head.

"Single."

"You'll sleep on the floor then. Or couch."

She muttered as she walked past him.

She was really tired. She just wanted to sleep. Not only had he just dragged her for the impromptu trip, now he also didn't properly plan where they would stay for the night and they had to manage the motel.

Well at least she had somewhere to stay for the night.

The room was clean. Clean room, clean rugs and a nice sofa at the side. It was comfortable enough for the two of them. And the bathroom was covered in white tiles. 

Room service has delivered a couple of towels for them.  Valentina intended to have a brief shower before bed. The bed was simple, thick white sheets, with fluffy pillows and a flowery duvet. She liked it a lot.

"I'll take a shower."

She murmured as she walked straight into the bathroom.

Remy grunted in reply.

She let herself be immersed in the hot water that washed all over her. She pondered on everything that had happened again and wondered why it was so important for her to regain her memories. 

Remy had told her that it was for the good of the pack, but she couldn't decipher the true meaning behind his statement. 

She at least hoped that the specialist they met would be able to help her in some way. 

Hopefully she would. 

She changed back into her clothes in the bathroom after drying up, then went back to the room and snuggled up underneath the thick duvet.

Remy sat on the couch brooding, his huge frame took up at least half of the couch, Valentina wondered if it was a good idea letting him sleep in such a small and confined space. She felt a little bad for him, he wouldn't be comfortable sleeping there. 

"Will you be okay over there?"

She finally asked timidly. Remy raised his eyebrows, he looked like he was surprised that she had even asked the question in the first place


Truth be told the question surprised her equally too. 

She couldn't tell why she asked. 

"I'll be fine. I'll be awake for a while"

"Why!"

She asked and Remy glanced around.

"I'll keep watch. Try and get some rest. We're waking up quite early tomorrow morning."

She nodded in reply and settled back into the covers. 

If he wanted to stay up all night then fine. That shouldn't be any of her business.

"Okay then. Suit yourself."

She murmured as she settled into the covers. Minutes later, she drifted into sleep.

This time, her dream was different. The blond haired girl didn't visit her.

But she was in a car, with a group of friends.

They were singing loudly, the radio was blasting cheesy pop song and she was singing along with them too, but she was looking out the window, enjoying the view.

She was happy. 

She was free. 

She liked the wind blowing on her hair.

And for a brief moment, she looked at the rear view mirror and caught a glimpse of herself.

Green eyes.

Blonde hair.

This time, she was the blonde haired girl.

Valentina woke up in a cold sweat.

She was panting softly. She looked at the wall clock on the wall, the light in the room was dim but she could still make out the hands of the clock. It was past three.

In the corner, Remy's eyes was closed. He didn't stir. He looked like he was fast asleep.

This dream was different.

It felt real. 

It felt like a memory.

And the face in the mirror, the face of that girl she had seen, she was wearing it.

She had the face on.

Who was the girl?!
###chapter 16 - My name is Colin
The next day, Remy was up earlier than Valentina, already calling room service to bring up their breakfast. He showered in the bathroom first and had a change of clothes.

Valentina was still fast asleep, but he knew when she had woken up in the middle of the night, her heart rate was high and she was panting heavily. He had been tempted to ask her what was wrong, but he didn't want to freak her out so he pretended to still be alseep.

Another nightmare then, she seemed to have one every night. Although the subject of her nightmare was not clear to him. She told him once that she saw a blond haired girl. Remy had no such memory of anyone like that. Maybe it was someone from her past, whoever she was and whatever was going on with Valentina, he was determined to find out when they saw the psychologist.

The doctors who recommended the specialist had said that there was a huge possibility that a part of Valentina's problems may be psychological. Since medically, there was nothing wrong with her, they had to explore other options.

After her nightmare she had tossed and turned for at least an hour before she finally went back to sleep. So he was careful not to disturb her. She remained asleep, till the hotel staff arrived with their breakfast, that was when she stirred.

She woke up from her sleep and rubbed her tired sleep filled eyes.

She looked really tired. 

She swung her legs off the bed and walked straight to the bathroom, without even caring to say a good morning.

Remy looked at the breakfast tray. It looked decent. A plate of eggs, some toast, sausages and coffee.


That would do, they had to be at their appointment in the next twenty minutes anyways.

Valentina came out from the bathroom shortly after.

"Good morning."

She murmured.

"Good morning. Did you sleep well?"

He asked and she nodded.

A lie. It was a big fat lie and he didn't even have to read her heartbeat to find out whether or not it was. 

"What about you?"

Remy nodded his head.

"I managed to get some rest."

"I got you breakfast. We leave in the next twenty minutes."

Valentina nodded in agreement.

"Okay."

She murmured as she walked towards the breakfast table. She picked up the plate of eggs.

"And you? Is that what you're wearing?"

She asked and Remy did a double take on his clothes. A pair of jeans and a black T-shirt, she tried not to look at him too much."

"What's wrong with it?"

He asked and she sighed. 

"Nothing."

It wasn't unlike anything he'd ever worn before. The man was always wearing informal clothes. Ever since she had met him. And they seemed to always fit him so well. Valentina noticed.

Especially with the way the jeans hugged his butt perfectly. She caught herself looking and quickly stopped herself. If he knew she was checking him out he'll never stop teasing her about it. 

"So this woman, you really believe she can heal me?"

Valentina asked and Remy shrugged.

"It depends. But it's a good start, going to see her.."

Valentina nodded.

"The doctor who recommended her, he was the one who treated me right?"

She asked and Remy nodded.

"Yes. Dr Calloway,.He was. This was the same place you were found, this town."

She took a bite out of her eggs. It was scrambled and tasteless.

"No wonder."

"No wonder what?"

He asked and she shrugged.

"It felt familiar. "

Remy raised his eyebrows.

"Familiar?! Do you think you've been here before?"

"I can't say. If I have... I don't remember."

She murmured as she set down her eggs. 




***********


Dr Ramirez's office was a five minute walk from the hotel. So Remy had suggested that they walked to the place. Valentina didn't object, she wanted to see more of the town anyways. And the more she looked, the more familiar it felt.


She felt a sense of nostalgia, or was it deja vu? Whatever it was, she couldn't stop thinking about why the town was so familiar.
Why the cafe just across from the Doctor's office sold croissants that she felt like she had tasted before. She could almost taste it too. Or the arabica coffee smell that wafted through her nostrils. 

Or why the signboards were vaguely ingrained in her memory, why she could look at one signboard and easily read out what it said without having to look at it twice.

She must have spent quite a while in the town. 

They arrived at the office on time. The clerk made them wait in the waiting room while she called Dr Ramirez. 

Remy excused himself to take an important call. Valentina wondered what it was all about as she watched him walk away with confusion etched in his face. 

Few moments later a man walked in. He looked restless, short dark blond hair with tan skin, the kind of tanned that you would only get if you spend a lot of time in the sun. He looked troubled, his shirt looked like it might as well have been pulled from a dumpster, rumpled and filled with slatters of paint or dirt and his shoes were covered in dry mud. Even the clerk at the front desk looked displeased at the sight of him.

"Can I help you?!"

She asked sternly and the man shrugged

"Can I see Dr Ramirez?!"

"Do you have an appointment?!"

She asked and the man sighed as he ran a hand through his hair.

"No, but I was hoping I could talk to her quickly. It's quite urgent."

"No. I'm afraid you can't. Dr Ramirez is booked for the day. She's very busy and if you want to see her you have to make an appointment with her."

"No. No. Please you don't get it! I have to see her now! I'm going out of my mind here!!"

"I can see that."

The lady murmured under her breath as she narrowed her eyes at him.

"I cannot let you see her Mr. Look, she has people waiting already."

She said as she pointed to Valentina. The man turned to look at Valentina, his eyes settled on her for a moment and she  shrank in her seat underneath his gaze.

"So, come back when you have an appointment."

She finally said and the guy scoffed.

Then he moved away from the desk and went to sit. 

Valentina stole glances at him. She wondered what had gotten him so riled up. He really looked like he'd die if he didn't see the woman. And she suddenly wondered what was so special about the doctor that had her booked and busy all the time. Even Remy had said he had to call her and pull a few strings to get the appointment. But apparently the guy in front her needed it way more than she did.

Valentina stood up from her sit and went up straight to the secretary.

"Can you give him my spot?"

She asked and the lady blinked.

"What?!"

The man's ears perked up and he quickly stood up.

"No.. I wouldn't want to trouble you..."

He started murmuring and Valentina shook her head.

"Trust me, it's no trouble, I don't really want to be here anyways. So you can have my spot."

"Are you sure?! Are you really sure? I wouldn't like to impose or anything..."

The man started talking again and Valentina chuckled.

"Don't worry about it! It's okay!"

She turned to the clerk who looked at the two of them morbidly.

"Excuse me young lady, this isn't some line at the mall, you can't just swap your spot to someone else. So please take a sit and wait for Dr Ramirez to see you, I'll deal with this man."

Valentina shook her head.

"Let the Doctor see him. I'm leaving now, I'll reschedule. So you can let him see the doctor since she's going to be free now."

"Oh thank you. I'm serious..."

The man murmured and Valentina nodded her head.

"It's okay."

She smiled at him, now that she could see more of him, he looked really handsome and his shirt wasn't really dirty, it was just rumpled and slightly wet. His hair was slightly damp too, like he had just rushed out from the shower. She wondered what he was going through that made him rush to see the doctor in such a state.

What was so serious that made him act the way he was acting. 


"My name is Colin. Colin Lockwood. Trust me I'm not normally like this..."

Colin?!


Colin?! 


"Colin?"

She repeated and he nodded.

"Yes. You?"

"Valentina."

She murmured.

Colin. The way the name rolled off her tongue, it was as if she knew him, as if he had said the name before a hundred times.

It felt strangely warm and familiar.


"Are you okay?!"

Colin asked and she nodded. 

She was jolted out of her thoughts.


"I have to go now."

She murmured as she left the office.

Outside she saw Remy screaming into his phone across the road. She wondered who he was talking to and wondered if it was a werewolf pack thing.

The minute he laid his eyes on her he ended the call and started walking towards her.

He was going to be pissed when he found out she gave up her spot to some person she had never met before.

"What's wrong? Why are you outside?! You should be inside with the doctor."

"Oh yea... about that."

She murmured as she scratched her head. Remy gave her a pointed look, his amber eyes narrowed at her

"What happened?!"

"I gave up my spot."

There was an uncomfortable silence that lasted about thirty seconds. 

Then Remy blinked and said.

"You did what now?!"
###chapter 17 - Remington
Valentina didn't think Remy was particularly angry at her. But he did look like he was fed up with her. 

As she explained why she gave up her spot, his eyelids twitched and she wondered if it was because of her. He didn't interrupt her once as she explained that it looked like the man needed much more help than she did and when she was done he just sighed.


"Remy?"

She called out and he ignored her.

"Remy?"


"Remington?!"

She tried again, calling his name in full and he glanced at her

"I'll try and set up another appointment."

He murmured as he walked past her. She didn't know whether or not she should feel relieved that he wasn't lashing out on her. 

She sighed as she watched him walk back inside the building. She followed him a while later, then stood at the side while he talked to the clerk again.

The man Colin was nowhere to be found in the waiting room. He must be talking to the doctor already.

Good. That's good.

She thought as she nodded her head. Even though she had given up her spot she wondered if Dr Ramirez would have rejected him, since she didn't know him and he wasn't the patient she planned to see. 

The doctor could have easily turned him away and told him to leave, but it seemed like she didn't. 

Remy came back to her


"What did she say?"

She asked and Remy sighed.

"She'll see you. Apparently she was really touched by your kind hearted gesture. So she cancelled her next session for you."

Remy's voice was dripping with sarcasm. Valentina ignored it as she smiled.

"Okay. That's good."

"What time is my own session?"

"In the next one hour. Let's go to the cafe nearby, maybe get something to eat while we wait."

Remy added as he pointed to the cafe. 


She nodded her head in agreement, already thinking about the smell of coffee and croissant that seemed so familiar. 

Together they left the office. It was a short walk to the cafe, but Valentina noticed that Remington was deep in thoughts.

"Who called you?"

"You looked angry."

She added and Remy shrugged.

"Someone I work with."

"Someone you work with work with or a werewolf like you?!"

"Keep your voice down!"

Remy said through clenched teeth as he quickly looked around. 

Valentina smirked. 

"Do you think anyone who actually hears us would think you're really a werewolf?!"

She scoffed.

"They'd just look at us and think we're crazy."

"I don't care if they think we're crazy. Be careful when you talk about stuff like that. It's not a joke."


"Well I wasn't joking. I was only asking a question because you looked really angry."

Remy sighed. They got to the front of the cafe and he opened the door for her, letting her go in first. Valentina noticed  that he had a habit of opening doors for her. 

She would have swooned at that if it was from any other man, but coming from him she feigned ignorance.

"Is that concern I see on your face. Were you actually concerned about me and what I do?"

Valentina rolled her eyes. 

"It was just a simple question."

The quaint little cafe was even better than she had expected. The smell of freshly brewed coffee and delicately baked and assembled pastries filled her nostrils as she walked in. She walked right straight to a corner seat at the very end of the cafe, almost as if she had been there before. 

Remy followed, wordlessly sitting across from her as he did a sweep of the cafe with his eyes. Valentina knew enough now to know that Remy's stares and glances were not ordinary. He would always scan the people and objects in any new environment before fully relaxing. This time, it didn't look like he was going to relax any time soon. 

"This town is crawling with all sorts of the otherworldly."

"Really?!"

She replied as she leaned in. 

"It is."

Remy said as he turned his nose.

"A lot of dark energy here. It's slightly sickening."

"Are there any werewolves like you? Or it's just other stuff?!"

"Werewolves like us."

Remy corrected and Valentina shrugged.

"Are they?"

He shook his head.

"Not one since we got here. But like I said I can feel a lot of dark energy. Especially in here. We should leave soon."

He warned but Valentina frowned at him. Leave?  She wasn't ready to leave yet. She liked the cafe.

"No. We should wait here till the doctor is done."

He was about to protest when a waitress approached them. With a notepad in her hand and a bored look on her face she greeted them.

"Can I take your order now?"

She asked as she brought out a pen from her apron.

"Some croissants would be nice."

Valentina said eagerly. The woman nodded.

"Okay. And what else would you be having?"

"That's all really."

Valentina murmured.


The waitress turned to Remy who firmly shook his head, gesturing that he wasn't hungry. 

"Oh wait! Can you bring me some maple syrup with the croissants?"

"Maple syrup?"

The waitress repeated and she nodded her head.

"Yes. Some maple syrup with it please."

The woman froze for a bit, then regained her consciousness and nodded her head. She scribbled on her notepad.

"Is that all?"

"Yes."

She replied and the woman nodded and walked away from them.

"Maple syrup?"

Remy scoffed as the waitress left. 

"What?"

Valentina shrugged as she looked outside the window, watching the cars go by. A small smile crept on her face. 

Remy's phone rang again. He let it ring for a while before letting out a deep sigh and excusing himself again. 

"Excuse me."

He murmured as he left the table again. She rolled her eyes as she watched him leave. He wouldn't tell her what was going on, yet it was clearly important enough to rattle him.

The waitress came with her order and Valentina beamed at her. She slapped some butter on the warm croissant and then drizzled the maple syrup on top of the croissant, blissfully unaware of the waitress's eyes on her the entire time, even as she took a bite. 

She was so distracted by her meal that she didn't see the man walk in.


The man from Dr Ramirez's office, Colin Lockwood. 


He walked into the cafe and walked directly towards her.

Valentina was shocked to see him. She looked at the time, it was barely time for the end of his session. He must have spent less than fifteen minutes with the doctor. 

"Did something happen? I didn't expect you to be back so early."

She said as she looked at her watch on her wrist. 

"I wanted to thank you for what you did earlier. And no, nothing happened. The Doctor was able to see me."

Valentina nodddd.

"Oh don't worry about that. I'm happy to help."

"Can I sit for a bit?"

He asked as he pointed to the opposite chair. 

Valentina nodddd, briefly checking to see if Remy was still occupied. He was. 


"Yes. You can."

"I'm not usually like this."

The man murmured.


Now, looking at him closer, Valentina could see that he was very handsome. He just looked tired. Really tired. Like he had not been sleeping well for the past few days.

"Did something happen?"

She asked and he nodded.

"I lost my best friend. Not long ago... I came to town because of her funeral."

"Oh. I'm so sorry."

The subject of grief and loss was an uncomfortable and unfamiliar one for her, she couldn't remember losing anyone. Or particularly grieving for anyone. 

"That must have been hard on you."

The man nodded. 

"It was. I was supposed to see her for her birthday, but I kept postponing... I thought we'd have more time together."

"I don't think that's your fault..."

She said carefully. She didn't know what to say... but she was picking her words carefully.


Colin sighed and then looked around.

"We used to come here a lot as teenagers. You're sitting in her favorite spot. She'd order a coffee and a croissant here if we came here in the morning."


Valentina smiled nervously and pointed to her croissant.

"I also ordered one. It's really nice."

Colin smiled sadly.

"She used to drizzle maple syrup on her croissant. It freaked me out."


Valentina chuckled and glanced at her own croissant. She decided it would be best not to let him know that she also drizzled maple syrup on her own croissant. Although she was unsure if she had always done that. Remy didn't particularly look surprised or shocked when she asked for it, but then again, he was very preoccupied at the moment. 

"Is that why you went to see the Doctor? Because you miss her?"

Colin shook his head.

"No. It's not that."

"I've been having these dreams. These vivid dreams. Almost as if I can feel her and touch her. Every night... they've been driving me crazy... I came to the doctor for an explanation... for a reason why."

Valentina was curious too.

"Was she able to help you? Did she tell you why you might be having these dreams?!"

She asked and Colin scoffed.

He shook his head.

"She wasn't helpful at all. I just ended up feeling worse."
###chapter 18 -  A rabid wolf.


Colin left shortly after, thanking Valentina profusely for her help. Valentina watched him leave, he stopped in front of the waitress, the woman placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed softly. She wondered if they knew each other.

After she finished her croissant she waited patiently for Remy to come back. He did, barely five minutes later.

"Dr Ramirez is free now, her secretary just called, so we can go back to her office."

Valentina nodded as she swallowed hard.

"Okay."

She murmured as she stood up. Remy got the check and paid and she walked out of the cafe with him closely behind her.

The Doctor's office looked serene, but there was something about the colours that put her off. It was all too neutral, like they were trying too hard to make it look relaxing, but it ended up unnerving her, at how unnatural the beige colours looked.

The beige sofas, the white walls, the rug and the wooden furniture, she smiled politely and looked straight at the Doctor.

Now Doctor Ramirez couldn't have been a day over fifty years old. With a short pixie cut, thick glasses and maroon colored lipstick, she had a face that you could have sworn you saw before. She looked like the kind of woman you'd run into at a grocery store, or anywhere really.

But the more Valentina looked at her, the more she noticed the unnerving stare that the woman had.

The woman looked at her like she was staring into her soul. It irked her and also made her so uncomfortable that she avoided eye contact.

"Mr Remington Albrecht. Valentina Combe, it's such a pleasure to meet you."

"Dr Calloway has told me so much about you."

She and Remy exchanged glances, the woman's hand was really warm and soft when she gave them both a firm handshake.

As the formalities, they settled in their seat, Valentina and Remington sat on opposite side of the large sofa.

"Would you like some coffee? Yea?"

She asked quietly and Valentina quickly shook her head.

"We had breakfast."

She mentioned.

The woman nodded.

"Oh I see."

"Mr Remington I hope you don't mind being here. It's the first session and I'll just be asking some questions that only you might be able to answer."

Remy nodded his head.

"Oh I don't mind."

The woman looked at a file in front of her, it was opened, she flipped through the first three pages and looked up at Valentina again.

"All your blood work and MRI scan came out normal. No sign of damage or anything. Your case is truly a mystery."

"Except for the fact that I don't remember my memories."

The Doctor nodded.

"I know. I want to know exactly how much of it you remembered when you woke up and how much you remember now."

Valentina shook her head.

"Nothing. I remembered nothing when I woke up. Nothing now."

Her statement plunged them all into an uncomfortable silence.

"I see. Mr Albrecht is this true?"

She asked and Remy nodded.

"She still doesn't remember anything. Doctor Calloway mentioned that her being in her usual routine and environment will trigger and make her remember her memories but none of that has happened yet"

"And it's been quite a while..."

Doctor Ramirez murmured.

Valentina shifted in her seat. She was getting nervous. Will this even work?

"I noticed Mrs Combe doesn't have any prior medical history, I tried to request for the reports from you ..."

Remy shook his head.

"No. She doesn't. We only just met and got married recently. Valentina doesn't have any family."

"Not one?!"

The Doctor repeated and Remy nodded.

"If she did, I know nothing about them because she never told me."

There was another deeply awkward silence.

"And how has your relationship been like since this incident?"

The Doctor was looking at Valentina, but she had no concrete answer. How could she talk
about that when she barely remembered how they were before?!

"Remington is a nice guy. But I still haven't been able to remember anything. He said we weren't really in love when we got married so I guess that kind of contributed to it."

"How so?!"

The Doctor seemed curious. Valentina turned to Remy and she could see that he was ignoring her and pretending not to want to stare at her.

"Valentina and I got married really fast, in months. We were getting to really know each other."

"I see. And what do you think of Remington? Do you think you have or had developed feelings for him ?"

Valentina raised her eyebrow.

"I don't know. I don't remember anything. When I look at him I don't particularly feel anything."

She said and she immediately regretted saying the words as they left her mouth. That must have been a little too harsh. She shouldn't have said that.

She turned to Remy but he was looking straight ahead, he didn't even spare her a glance.

"Okay. Very well then. I guess I have my work cut out for me."

The Doctor turned to Remy.

"I'll ask you to leave now, since I still have to talk to Valentina on her own. You may leave the room Mr Albrecht."

Without hesitation he stood up and left. Leaving Valentina in the room with the Doctor.

...........

Outside of the doctor's room, in the waiting room Kale called him again. He sighed as he picked up the phone.

"Calling me every five minutes wouldn't make me leave here any faster."

He drawled.

"Oh I wish it would but I have something else to tell you."

Remy sighed as he rubbed at his tired temples.

"Oh please don't tell me. Please don't tell me Marielle has run off again to do something stupid."

"She has. She appeared calmer so I left her for a moment, I went back in now to check in her and she's gone."

"I hope she doesn't do anything drastic."

Kale added.

Drastic?! Well that was right up Marielle's alley, but he knew her and he knew her well, she would never do anything to jeopardise the pack.

Nevertheless, he didn't like the fact that she had disobeyed him, when he had given a clear order that she should stand down.

But apparently she had other plans.

"I will try and make it back as soon as possible. We'll take the first plane out of here. Be there soon."

He murmured as he ended the call.

He decided to wait in the waiting room while he made a few more calls.

About thirty minutes later, Valentina finally emerged from the Doctor's office. There was a blank expression on her face as she walked forward, clutching her purse to her chest. She looked distracted.

Remy was tempted to ask if they had made any luck with her session but the looks on their faces told him otherwise.

"Mr Albrecht. We should discuss how to plan our sessions with Valentina, since you don't live in town."

Remy nodded.

"That's alright. We'll be leaving soon, we have to go back home quickly."

The doctor smiled.

"No problem."

Then she turned to Valentina and squeezed her shoulder.

"I'll see you next time Valentina, but don't forget all we've talked about."

"I won't."

Valentina said as she nodded.

They walked out of the office.

Remy looked at Valentina for answers.

"What's up?"

Valentina shrugged.

"She asked me a lot of weird questions. Lots of them."

"Okay. We have to go home now, so we'll go back to the motel, pack our things and leave."

"Why? What's the rush?"

She asked and he looked straight ahead.

"I have to deal with some things back at home. So we have to leave."

Valentina wanted to stay in the town a little longer but she didn't particularly want to start a whole argument with Remy.

"Are you sure we can't just stay the night?"

"Why the rush?!"

Remy sighed.

"I'm sorry but we can't. It's really urgent."



......... 



They arrived back home late at night. Valentina tired and her eyes heavy with sleep. Remy went out but found no signs of Marielle. She had left. 

Valentina went to sleep, she was tired from the long trip and just wanted to rest. 

This time, while she slept, she had another confusing nightmare. 



*I was walking down an empty road, in a tattered dress, my knees were scraped, my hands were covered with blood. The sight chill in the air made me tremble slightly. The road is long and dark, there are no lights, save for the moon's shimmery glow. I look around, it looks like I'm alone. 

*Not for long, I hear a growl and I turn around frantically, trying to get which direction it came from. I stop walking, my bare feet rooted to the cold asphalt in fear. I could feel that I wasn't alone. Someone, or something was with me and I didn't know who or what it was. 

*I hear the growl again. It sounded like a warning, it was deep, feral and in that moment I knew had to run, as fast as I could and get away. 

*I run. 

*I run and run as fast as my legs could carry me, now breaking out into a sprint. The growl gets louder and now I know that something is in the woods, chasing me, but I'm too scared to look, I'm too scared to turn. I increase my pace, my heart in my mouth and my mouth opening to scream, the creature jumped out of the woods and appeared in front of me.
*
I stop abruptly and in the process I trip and fall. 

*The large black wolf looked rabid, with the crazed look in its eyes and the saliva and foam at the corner of its mouth. 

*This was it. This was the end, I thought as it pounced. 

*But in the final moments, the face that appeared in front of me was not one of the wolf, but... it was my own face, me with long tangled black hair and my canines sharpened. 

*How? How is this me? How is this me?! I thought as I trembled in fear. The aberration towered over me. Though the face was human, the limbs and fur was still all wolf and the face looked more wolf than human even though I could tell that it was my face. 

*As the wolf snarled and drew closer with its jaw wide open. I did the only thing I could do. 

*I screamed.  
*








###chapter 19 - I will find you. 

A shrill scream echoed through the hallway. Remy was with Marielle down the hallway when he heard the scream. Marielle had just come home and he had run into her while she was trying to avoid him. 

"Is that Valentina?"

She asked and he nodded his head. 

"She must be having another nightmare. You can go."

He left as soon as he came,  making a beeline towards the bedroom they were both supposed to share. As he open the door and turned on the lights, he found Valentina on the bed, her face haggard and her eyes wide open with fear. When she looked up at him, her shocked eyes seemed to soften as if she was relieved to see him.

"Another nightmare?"

He asked gently as he got into bed with her. 

She nodded. 

"Sorry about that."

He whispered. 

"Come here."

He murmured. His voice hoarse and husky. He stretched open his hands and Valentina buried herself in his arms. He stroked her hair gently. 

"You're fine now."

He murmured into her ear. 

"I saw a wolf. A wolf with my face!"

She said in a muffled tone. Remy sighed but kept stroking her hair. He didn't know what to make of her and her nightmares but he knew she had not had a single night's rest ever since she lost her memories. 

"Hey. It's okay. It's okay."

He murmured gently. 

"I'm here now. So you can close your eyes and fall asleep. I promise I won't leave till you fall asleep."

She sniffed. She was going to protest, tell him to leave, tell him she was fine alone but she truly wasn't. His presence was calming and the way he stroked her hair felt nice. 

To be honest, she didn't want him to leave. 



.........



The next morning. She woke up to an empty bed. Remy must have left when she fell asleep. She didn't even know it was possible to fall asleep after such a dreadful nightmare. But she was happy that she did. Happy she had finally gotten some rest. 

She stretched a bit and got out of bed. She was hungry, rightfully so too because she didn't remember eating dinner. Remy had mentioned something about there being preparations for the full moon. She wasn't sure she had heard him properly but she was sure it was in the next two days. She was going to be the only one left in the whole mansion. And more wolves would be arriving for the full moon. 

Nevertheless, she freshened up and changed into Joggers and a T-shirt and went downstairs. 

She couldn't deny the heightened frenzy in the air. There seemed to be more people in the house than she had ever seen. 

She looked around confused, some of them stopped to say hello, she answered them with a polite smile. She was relieved when she found the familiar face of her mother in law seated in the living room and talking to one of the members.

"Ellen. Good morning."

"Oh! Sweet child! There you are! Remy said you had another nightmare. Are you okay?"

"I'm fine. There's a lot of people here."

She muttered and Ellen nodded. 

"Yes. Well it's a full moon. A lot of wolves like to spend that time with their kind. It keeps them grounded."

"So there are more members of the Silverback Pride out there?!"

She asked and Ellen chuckled. 

"Way more than you think. Some people will arrive tomorrow. Just in time for the full moon and leave the moment it's dawn."

"Interesting."

Valentina murmured. 

"Do you need my help? Do you need me to do anything?"

She humbly offered but Ellen looked hesitant. 

"Why don't you come have breakfast now? You didn't have dinner yesterday. I'm sure you must be starving." 

Her stomach growled around that time, confirming Ellen's suspicions. Oh yes. She was very hungry. 

Ellen dragged her to the kitchen.

Valentina kept an eye out for Remy. She was going to thank him last night , he had stayed with her till she went back to sleep. That was nice of him. 

Ellen noticed her frantic searching eyes and accurately guessed who she was looking for. 

"Remy and some of his men left early. They'll be doing perimeter sweeps and checking out the woods just to be sure its safe for the full moon. He'll probably be back in time for lunch. Or dinner."

"Oh."

Was all she replied with. 

"I want to help out. If there's anything I can do to help let me know."

Ellen looked pretty hesitant. 

"Well, everything has been pretty much covered. And you're the Luna, you're not expected to do  the hard or manual labour."

"I still want to help. I can't sit around while everyone gets to do something."

Ellen smiled uneasily. 

"Well there is something. I'll show you after breakfast."

Breakfast was a meal of oatmeal and fruits. The chef profusely apologised for not having anything more than fruits and oatmeal but Valentine was fine with it. Even a cup of coffee and stale bread would have sufficed, she was that hungry. There was still a lot to do. Grocery runs, cleaning, setting up everyone's sleeping arrangement. Valentina felt like an outsider looking in with everything they were saying and doing. 

No matter how much she told herself that she was one of them and her memory was the only thing that was holding her back, she still couldn't shake the unmistakeable feeling that she didn't belong with them. That she never did. 

"This is Connor, Missy and baby Grape."

Ellen said as she pointed to the two kids in front of her and the one she was bouncing on her hip. 

Valentina's jaw dropped.

Kids?! Ellen wanted her to take care of kids?!

"It's rare getting kids this time of the year during the full moon, mostly because the parents aren't willing to travel down. But they happened to be in town so they came over."

"Okay."

Valentina answered quietly 

"You just have to watch them for two, three hours top. Connor and Missy are eight and seven, they are very well behaved. Baby Grape is eight month old and she has been fed. She's not fussy. If you need anything just send someone to get me. I'll just be down the hall."

With that, Ellen handed her the baby and Valentina held her as gently as she could. The two other kids looked at her expectantly as Ellen left.

"Do you... do you like paintings?"

She asked awkwardly and the boy nodded his head. 

She took the kids to her painting room and was immediately reminded of how much of a bad idea it was when she saw the dark paintings. She hid as much of them as she could, juggling a baby in her hand and she gave the kids some watercolours and sheets of paper from a sketch book.

"Here. Paint something you like. Anything you want."

"Anything?"

Missy asked and Valentina nodded, an encouraging smile on her face. 

"Yes! Anything!"

Connor and Missy looked interested enough, so they started painting right away. The baby on the other hand didn't want to leave Valentina's arms. So she held on to the baby as she looked outside the window. 

Her phone beeped and the sound alarmed her so much that she jumped, startling the baby who almost broke out in a fuss. 

"Shhh."

She murmured to the baby as she fished out her phone from her pocket. 

It was a text message from an unknown number. Her heart skipped a beat as she read the words to it. 

*I will find you. And I will take back what's mine. *



..................



"We're running out of time."

Kale said as he looked at the map on the mahogany table. It was a map of all the known packs in America. And the territories they occupied. They had all been staring at it for a while.  Remy was looking to see who he could trust and who he could not. 

"These secret meetings, the spies, they're moving against us. It's not hard to see."

Marielle persisted. For days, days and days she had been trying to make Remy see reason, she was trying to make them act, but Remy wanted them to examine the situation first. He didn't want them to take any irrational decisions.  

"She doesn't remember anything. She's not even connected to her wolf yet."

Marielle gave him a pointed look, her hands were folded. 

"Well you've tried it your way. Let's try mine. We look for John."

Kale looked at Marielle uneasily. He was sure that there was no way that his alpha would agree to such a plan. Remy would never let John the healer back into the pack or anywhere their Luna. But desperate times called for desperate measures.  

"John's a healer. And he's a pretty good one. I'm sure I can find him."

She persisted. 

 "Well, I have no doubt that you will find him. But I don't trust him. Can we trust him to keep his mouth shut? Do we know if he still swears allegiance to our pack?"

Remy gave Marielle a pointed look. Sure they were desperate, but they were not that desperate, there was no reason for them to be. Especially not at the moment. 

They had time.  Remy sighed. He took one last look at the mahogany table and shook his head.

"Go out and go find him. Find John."










###chapter 20 - The full moon


The full moon was only a few hours to go, but anxiety and worry was already eating at Valentina. She couldn't stop thinking about the text message she got and then the nightmare that seemed to repeat itself the next night.

She busied herself as much as she could, finding out she had a natural talent for baking, she found herself in the kitchen with the chef. She helped him cook some of the meals, since they were having so much guests and she found out that it especially gave her a lot of satisfaction. Especially when she baked. She baked the lemon pies, lots of bagels and bread. 

Even Ellen was surprised, commenting that Valentina baked as if she had done it all her life, meanwhile she rarely ever entered the kitchen. 

"It's like you're a whole new person!"

The Chef had commented. 

She has laughed nervously and asked what he meant and he hesitated. She finally urged him to speak and he did. 

"You weren't always in the brightest of moods. And there was barely anything that could make you smile, but it's different now. You're different."

And the words had stuck to her. Truly and deeply they had stuck to her because she also couldn't fathom or imagine why everything about her was so different. It was as if she was a whole new person, as if her past life was lived by somebody else. Even her dreams were just as confusing as her reality. 

Those were the things that she couldn't fathom. 

"Valentina."

A voice called out from behind and she froze a bit, realising who it was. 

She turned and saw Remy in front of her. 

She had not seen him for a long time. Hours even. Not since the arrived, not even during dinner. Apparently he was very occupied with a lot of things. 

"Remy..."

She murmured as she dusted her skirt. She was in the kitchen, just putting away some leftovers for the chef. 

"What's up?"

She asked as she turned to look at hm, his frame was so large that he occupied the entire door frame. He was wearing a deep blue shirt and dark pants. His hair was in a bun on the top of his head, with long strands of it framing his face. He looked a little tired. The dark circles around his eyes were hard to miss. 

He walked towards her and she almost stepped back out of shyness. 

There was always something abut his presence, a way that he walked that made it seem as if time slowed down when he walked. The aura he possessed was only something someone of his calibre and kind would have. An alpha. She secretly wondered what his wolf would look like. 

Marielle's had been terrifying enough, so she had no doubt his would look way more scary and bigger, given his huge build.

"My mother said you've been helping out a lot. Thank you for that."

"Oh it's nothing."

She murmured as she ran her hand through her hair while fidgeting slightly. 

"I only wanted to help out. It seemed like everyone was doing something and I didn't just want to sit down and watch them do all the work."

"You didn't have to. You're a Luna. But I'm grateful for your help. And I'm sure everyone else is too."

He reached into his back pocket and brought out what looked like a credit card. He handed it to her. 

"As you know, the full moon is approaching. We'll be out in the wild for a few days and all. I don't want you here all alone. So I suggest you take time off and go somewhere."

"What?!"

She asked in disbelief, barely believing the words that were coming out of Remy's mouth. 

"You're giving me your card."

"Yes."

He nodded. 

"For whatever it is you want to buy or you think you might need. You could lodge in an hotel for a few days, if you want I can help you set up a place. But you're free to do whatever you want in the meantime."

"Alone?!"

She asked startled and Remy chuckled. 

"For security reasons I will have two of my trusted men with you. They'll be with you at all times, watching from a distance to make sure you're safe."

She just didn't understand. 

What game was he playing at. She wasn't even allowed to leave the premises without someone stopping her or anything and now he was letting her go.

"Why are you doing this?"

She asked and he sighed. 

"Well..."

"Aren't you scared that I'll run away or something."

He gave her a pointed look, but then he smiled and answered, " Oh I wish you wouldn't, but I'm being serious. You probably need a change of environment and I wouldn't feel good about keeping you holed up here when you could be up there having a good time."

"Wow."

She breathed.

"I don't know what to say."

She murmured and Remy smiled. 

"You don't have to say anything. You just have to say yes and agree to go."

She looked at the card again. 

"Yes! Definitely!!!"

She squealed and he nodded. He started walking away, but then he halted and turned.

"Don't be afraid to spend as much as you want."

He added. 



............... 

It was a stupid decision. It really was. But she only realised it after. That she was back in the town where it had all happened. Back in the town where she had been supposedly found dead. Only this time she was alone. 

And no, she wasn't going to see any specialist. 

Remy would never imagine that she would come here. Or maybe he would, either way she wasn't sure she cared what he thought about it. 

There was a party in town. Something about founder's day. She didn't fully know what it was, but the streets was alive with people. There were ribbons and people giving out pamphlets. She didn't stop to check. 

After lodging into her hotel, she had decided to take a walk and check out the local shops. As promised, the two bodyguards Remy had given her were following her closely. She wasn't even annoyed by their presence. She just felt strangely comforted that they were following her and keeping her safe. 

The first shop was one which sold makeup, she found it weird that she didn't have any, so she picked out a couple of stuff she wanted. After the makeup shop she went into a small boutique, they didn't have anything trendy but they did have some stuff she really liked. The lack of jeans and fitted dresses in her closet made her wonder if it was all really her clothes. They just didn't seem like the things she would wear, but she had definitely tried her best to manage the pieces and wear what she wanted to wear. 

The cafe shop she had been to the last time she came to the town was her last stop before she went back to her hotel. Luckily, they had more to order this time around, so she sat down and ordered the something different again. 

"Hey!"

 A voice called out and she turned. 

It was Colin! 

That guy who she gave up her spot at the doctor for. He was looking much better now. Clean clothes, nice smile and a boyish handsomeness she had almost not noticed before.

"Valentina."

He said as he shook her hand gently. 

"I never thought I'd see you again."

Valentina chuckled. 

"Oh Why's that?"

She murmured and he shrugged. 

"Oh you just don't look like you're from around town. I'm sorry are you from around town?"

He asked and she shook her head. 

"No. You're right. I'm not. What about you?"

He shrugged. 

"I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm just here to have a drink with someone. What about you? Are you here with someone?"

He asked as he looked around. 

No she wasn't. The two bodyguards with her had sat down at least two tables away from her, pretending to be interested in the stale old newspaper on their table. 

"No. I'm not. I was hungry. I decided to come and eat.."

Colin looked at the bags and chuckled. 

"Looks like you had a busy day."

He said and Valentina blushed. 

"I was just looking around town. Shopping can be strangely therapeutic."

Especially when it wasn't your own money. She thought. She still had more stuff to buy, since it wasn't her card she planned on spending as much as she could. She would also do some online shopping before she left town.

"I can imagine. I had a friend that liked taking a look around the shops. Makeup, clothes, shoes and all, you name it. It always found a way to lift her mood."

"Oh I think we'd make good friends then, I can't remember the last time I've been this happy and relieved."

Colin's smile slowly fell from his face. 

"Yea... you would have."

"Colin?!"

A voice called interrupting them. 

I know that voice. 

Valentina thought as her head started to throb. 

"Oh! Mrs Parson. I'm here. Welcome..."

As the voice faded, Valentina closed her eyes and was confronted with a memory. A woman's face barely inches from hers, stroking her hair softly and singing her a song. A lightly dimmed room, painted soft pink, she was on the bed, the blanket wrapped snugly around her body.

*You are my sunshine, my only sunshine..*

*You make me happy when skies are grey*.....

The woman smiled at her, with familiar green eyes and curly strawberry blond hair in a messy bun. 

"Mom?"

She said out loud. 


###chapter 21 - Lunathion

"Valentina?"

Collins voice drew her out of her thoughts and she looked straight at him. 

"Are you okay?"

He asked and she nodded. 

"Yes. Sorry.. I zoned out for a moment. I remembered something."

She murmured and he nodded. 

"Oh. Are you sure you're okay?"

He sounded concerned. Valentina forced a smile.

"I am."

She turned to the woman next to Colin, the woman stared at her with curious familiar eyes. 

"Mrs Parson this is Valentina. We met a few days ago."

Mrs Parson smiled and Valentina couldn't help but notice how much she looked like the woman from her memory. Her first memory by the way. The woman in front of her looked a lot like her. With her eyes and the kind smile on her face. Only the hair was different. Straight and blond and long, past her small narrow shoulders. And her face looked older, gaunt, with sharp lines and a narrow face.

"Nice to meet you Valentina. Are you sure you're okay?"

The woman asked softly as she stretched out a hand. 

Valentina shook her slightly and the memory popped in her head again, she struggled to comport herself. 

"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You just remind me of someone."

The woman looked surprised. 

"Who?"

She asked and Valentina chuckled. The woman in her memory could have been her mother. It was possible. She was singing her a lullaby, while she was in bed under the covers watching the woman intently. 

"My mother."

She finally replied and the woman seemed to freeze. She quickly regained her composure and smiled again. 

"Oh. Do I look like her?"

She asked and Valentina nodded. 

"Well yes. Except she has curly hair. You look alike a lot. I'm sorry, I couldn't help blurting it out."

"Oh it's nothing."

Mrs Parson waved it away. 

"It's nice to meet you Valentina. I'm Lily Parson. Colin here is like a son to me."

Parson. Parson. Parson. 

What a peculiar and familiar last name. 

"Parson? I feel like I've heard that name before."

The woman's smile started faltering and Colin quickly stepped in. 

"Valentina, we'll be on our way now. It's nice to see you."

"Oh okay."

Valentina said as she wondered if she said anything wrong. She watched them walk over to the other end of the cafe, Mrs Parson didn't look back once. 



...........

As the moon rose higher and higher in the sky, Remy knew the transformation would begin. They were prepared. He had gotten everything ready and Valentina was safe and far away where she wouldn't hear them howling all night. 

Everyone in the pack stoically waited for what was coming. The moon, the transformation and then finally the hunt. He could already taste the change in the air. He could almost feel the throbbing powerful energy of the moon. 

The moon that would give them their powers. 

His pack was ready, when it was time, they would run through the forest, their senses heightened and their instincts razor-sharp. They would howl at the moon, their voices blending together in a haunting chorus that echoed through the trees.

For hours they would hunt, their wolf forms sleek and powerful, until finally the moon began to sink below the horizon, and the transformation would begin to reverse itself.

As they slowly start to regain their human forms, they would return home, exhausted but fully satisfied. Knowing that  they had  finally gotten rid of that gnawing ache to be wild. Knowing they had experienced something truly unique, something that only they and a few select others could ever understand.

"Is everything ready?"

Kale asked as he stood next to his alpha. They both looked out the clearing from the hill they were on. Their members were scattered all through the dense forest, but Remy could see and hear each and every one of them. 

"It is."

Remy answered and Kale sighed.

"Anytime now."

"I heard you sent Valentina away."

He added and Remy nodded. 

"Yes. I think it'll be better for her if she's away."

Kale didn't look convinced. 

"I thought maybe the full moon might somehow help her get connected to her wolf."

Kale said and Remy shrugged. 

"It wouldn't. I don't think any of our methods or ideas would have helped. Nothing would work unless she remembers everything first."

"Let's hope Marielle finds John on time."

Kale sighed and Remy smirked. 

"I'm sure she's hunting him down as we speak."



..............



The full moon hung low in the sky, casting an eerie glow over the forest. The werewolf alpha, Remington, felt a restlessness deep in his bones. He knew what was coming, and he couldn't stop it.

As the moon rose higher in the sky, Remy felt a primal energy coursing through him. His senses sharpened, and his muscles tensed. The transformation was coming, and he couldn't resist it.

With a guttural howl, he shifted into his werewolf form. His body grew, his bones cracking and reforming. Fur sprouted all over his skin, and his face elongated into a snout filled with sharp teeth. He stood on four legs, towering over the trees.

As the transformation completed, he let out another howl, signalling his dominance over the pack. His senses were heightened in this form, and he could smell the scent of their prey in the distance. He led his pack through the forest, hunting down the prey and howling deep into the night.

Remy felt free in this form. Free and unhinged, with raw power coursing through his muscles. In his werewolf form he no longer felt burdened by the trivial worries of human life. He was a true alpha, leading his pack through the wild. The moon guided him, and he felt a deep connection to the earth.

As the night wore on, Remy  felt the moon's power begin to wane and his energy dwindling slowly. His transformation slowly reversed, and he shifted back into his human form. The fur retreated, and his bones shifted back to their original shape. He was left crouched naked in the middle of the forest, feeling drained but exhilarated.

It was finally over. And even though it had been hours, they had gone by so quickly that they felt like minutes to him. Too short, too fleeting of a time. 

The next day, Remy  returned to his human life, but he couldn't shake the feeling of the wolf within him. He longed for the freedom and power that came with the transformation. But he knew that he had a responsibility to his pack, and he couldn't abandon them for his own selfish desires, even though all he wanted to do sometimes was just run and run and feel free in his wolf form. 

The next full moon would come soon, and Remy would once again embrace his werewolf form under the full power of the moon. 



..............

Valentina went back home two days later. She was thoroughly satisfied and at peace when she got back. Lukcily, the house was back to normal. The people who had come had left and Ellen had welcomed her with a warm hug. 

"Valentina!! I missed you. I thought you were supposed to come yesterday."

The woman said as she pulled away. Valentina shrugged. 

"I had an appointment so I had to stay an extra day."

She had gone to the spa. That was the appointment. 

She watched the two men bring out all her luggage. All of the things she had bought. 

Ellen's jaw dropped. 

"Sweetie. You were only gone for a few days, how do you have so much luggage?"

Valentina shrugged. 

"I had to buy some stuff, I really needed them."

Truth was, that wasn't even all she got, some stuff would still arrive days later. But she had bought a lot of stuff, especially when she noticed that Remy was not complaining about the bill she was racking. She had blown thousands and thousands of his money and all he had asked her was when she was coming home and whether or not she was having a good time. 

Well, thanks to him she had a great time. And she couldn't wait to show her full appreciation for everything that he did for her. 

"So, you'll have to tell me all about where you went to and what you did, seems like you had quite the adventure."

Ellen remarked and she beamed. 

"I did. I don't think I've had that much fun in a long time. And I'm not even exaggerating. I had a lot of fun."

"Oh wow. Come come come. Let's go in so you can tell me all about it."

Ellen gestured. 

"Oh wait. You look a little different."

She murmured as she looked a her daughter - in - law from head to toe. 

Valentina did a little twirl for her. 

"Can you tell? I'm changing my entire wardrobe."

Ellen squinted at her shoes. 

"Is that a pair of sneakers I see?"

She asked and Valentina nodded quickly.

"Yup! They're Nike's."

Ellen looked stunned. She had never seen Valentina dressed in such way. Like some preppy teenager. The shoes, the pair of jeans and the small white top that cut right above her belly button, showing the pale white skin below. It was truly a sight to behold. 

"Where's Remy?"

Valentina asked as she walked in with Ellen behind her. 

"Somewhere upstairs. Maybe in his study."

Valentina nodded. 

"Oh that's good. I'll just go say a quick hello and return something of his real quick."

She dropped her bag on the long sofa and headed up the stairs. 

As she neared the door to the study, she heard the heated voices of Remy and Kale, his beta. 

"Well, she won't be useful to us if she can't perform the Lunathion ritual. No offence Alpha."

Remy let out a deep sigh. 

"Her usefulness is not of the essence right now. What matters is that she recovers her memories first..."

"And what if she doesn't? And if she doesn't connect with her wolf?!"

"Months and months of careful planning all in the drain!"

Kale murmured. 

"We need to plan ahead. Think ahead." He added desperately.

"I am planning."

Remy groaned. He sounded mildly frustrated at his beta. 

"Valentina will perform the ritual. I am positive that she will. Marielle will find John, he will heal her and Valentina will do what she is supposed to do."

"She will perform the ritual."


###chapter 22 - The spymaster strikes


Ritual? What Ritual?

Valentina asked herself as she peeled herself away from the study door and started to walk away quietly. She had always known that Remy was hiding something from her, but now she wondered if this was what he was hiding from her.

Was this the only reason he married her?!

Because of some ritual? A ritual that he had decided and conveniently not tell her about. Just when she finally thought that they were getting along and things were going well, she was once again reminded that Remy was a powerful man, an alpha at that and he didn't marry her for love, but rather he married her for what she could do for him. It wan't clear before but it was clear now and she was disgusted and hurt by the fact that he thought he could use her that way.

Well, Valentina wasn't going to allow herself to be used, that wasn't up for debate. She was going to be a pawn in someone's game. Just an object that could be used and discarded.

I have to leave this place.

The thought came to her head and she nodded.

She was going to have to plan her escape. She hated being holed up in the house most of the time, with nowhere to go and nothing to do. And once her memories got back and she was able to connect with her wolf, she suspected that things would be much worse. Much worse in the sense that she would be expected to participate as Luna. And even do the ritual that they had spoken of.

No, she would not be a part of it. She would not be a part of that.

The door opened, jolting her out of her thoughts and she looked up to find Remy.

"You're back!"

He said and she nodded her head.

"I am."

He walked in slowly, the tension between them as thick as the air in the room. Remy watched her closely, his eyes trying to decipher her mood.

"Are you okay?"

He asked and she nodded.

"I am. You?"

He shrugged and indeed.

"I'm good."

"You went back to that town..."

He started and Valentina shrugged as she ran her hand through her hair, she knew that the question was going to come up sooner or later, Remy asking her why she went back to the town.

"Yes. I did. Do you have a problem with that?"

That didn't come out in the right tone. Her tone sounded passive and aggressive, but she held her head up high and stared him down any way.

"No. I don't. I just wonder why you did, giving your history with the town. You could have gone anywhere else."

"Right. But that's where I wanted to go. Is there anything wrong with that?!"

There was a deep and uncomfortable silence before Remy answered.

"No. No there isn't."

He said as he turned back and left the room, slamming the door on his way out. Valentina smirked, knowing she had him all riled up.



..................



Remy watched the wrangler jeep pull up in the driveway and he knew that Marielle was back, he walked out to meet her and saw her hop out of the jeep, with nothing but leggings and a large black shirt and sunshades. She had a big smile on her face as she looked at Remy.

"Did you get my text?"

She asked and he smiled wryly.

"I sure did."

He answered as he walked closer to the jeep.

"Only three days this time, that must be a new record for you spymaster."

"Well, I aim to please. And this one was a surprisingly easy one to catch."

Remy opened the door of the jeep and was confronted with a shaggy looking man, his hands and legs tied and his eyes blindfolded. He removed the blindfold first.

"Oh well... you didn't have to do Old John like that."

He said sarcastically as he looked at John.

John looked just the same, except his long brown hair was spotted with grey hair and he desperately looked like he needed to shave his overgrown grey beard.

His dark brown beady eyes were just as Remy remembered, inquisitive and unnerving as they were.

John didn't say a word as he looked at his alpha.

"He hasn't said much to be honest. Don't take it the wrong way."

Marielle murmured to Remy.

Remy shrugged.

"Oh I don't."

Marielle untied the ropes while Remy stood aside, Ellen came to join them.

"Is that who I think it is?"

John's eyes only shot up when he heard the sound of Ellen's voice.

"John?!"

She was stunned.

"Ellen?"

John muttered.

Ellen looked to her son for explanation and Remy gave her a small smile and a look.

"Valentina."

That was all he said and his mother nodded in understanding.

"Oh. Oh okay."

Ellen said as she walked away, John's eyes followed her.

"Ellen? Ellen?"

John called out but she ignored him.

"You don't actually expect her to answer you do you?"

Remy scoffed.

John glared at him.

"Not after everything that you've done John. Even you don't deserve that."

He added.

"My only apparent crime was leaving."

John finally said and Remy chuckled.

"Yes. At the worst fucking time too!"

"You wouldn't understand my reasons."

John muttered again.

Remy glared at him.

They walked to the annex quietly.

John finally cleared his throat.

"I don't know why you've brought me here, but I will tell you that I refuse to do anything you will ask me to do until you listen to my terms and conditions."

"Terms and conditions?!"

Marielle scoffed.

"Okay. Let's hear them then." Remy answered.

They reached the annex and John was put in a room, Marielle excused herself, saying she wanted to freshen up after the long trip.

Remy watched John settle on the small bed, his eyes watching him closely. He had not seen John in years, the once revered healer of their pack, who ran away once he heard that his father the previous alpha had died. Nobody could ever decipher the motives behind his disappearance and nobody could ever figure out why he did, but there was one thing that he knew, only that their pack had lost a great and skilful healer when he left.

"You look good. Grown bigger."

John commented. Remy nodded.

"Yea. Let's go straight to the point."

"What are your terms and conditions?"

He asked sarcastically.

"You'll let me go. I don't want to stay here."

Ouch. That hurt, but he had expected it. Remy shrugged.

"Nobody was expecting you to stay. So that's not a problem."

If John was surprised by Remy's answer, he didn't show it. He just nodded and looked away.

"Good."

"Anything else?"

Remy asked and John nodded as he cleared his throat.

"You will pay me for my services."

Remy blinked.

That was unusual, and quite unexpected because he never thought that was what the old man would say.

"And how much do you want?"

John shrugged.

"I'll have to examine the patient first. See her and make an assessment."

"Okay then."

"Do we have a deal?"


John asked and Remy nodded.

"Yes. Yes we have a deal."






...........



Valentina was taking a nap when she heard someone come in. She stirred in her sleep but she didn't open her eyes, thinking it was Remy.

"Valentina."

Marielle's voice filled the room. She nudged her gently.

Valentina stretched her arms and opened her eyes.

"I'm sorry to disturb you, but you need to come downstairs."

"Why?!"

Valentina asked as she rubbed at her tired eyes. Marielle smiled gently.

"So, we found a local healer for you. He's part of our pack. He wants to do an assessment on you. He's down waiting for you at the annex.."

She sat upright. Suddenly aware of Marielle's words and what they meant.

"Can he heal me? Does that mean that he can heal me?!"

She asked and Marielle nodded her head.

"It's worth a try. He's a very good healer. And he's well learned. There's no one he can't heal."

"And I believe that he'd be able to heal you too. Or at least give us some insight into what's going on with you."

"You want that too right?!"

She asked softly and Valentina nodded.

"Of course. Of course I do."

She murmured as she swung her legs out of bed. Together, they walked to the annex.

Remy was already there, waiting for them. Their eyes met but they didn't say a word to each other.

Valentina looked away quickly and Remy started staring at his phone.

"Go in. John's waiting. We'll be outside by the door in case you need us."

She nodded, still unsure but hopeful for the best. She needed answers and if this healer man was going to provide her with answers for her past she was willing and able to do whatever was required for her.

After that she would run away.

Far far away.

John.

John was a slender man, he had so much hair. Long greying hair and an even longer beard. His eyes followed her as she walked into the room.

He gave her a small smile, she didn't return the smile. She just watched him carefully.

She couldn't believe he was a werewolf . He looked too fragile to be one, his hands were slender, his face was slim and his cheeks were hollow. She couldn't tell if it was as a lack of nourishment or he truly looked that thin.

"So you're the Luna."

"Yes."

Valentina murmured.

"And do you know?!"

"Know what?"

She asked him.

"Do you know the story of the curse of the Luna of the Silverback pride?!"


###chapter 23 - Alpha of bloodshed


"I haven't."

"What's it about??"

She asked curiously. The man looked like he was trying to decide whether or not to tell her at first.

"Sit down."

He murmured.

There was only one chair in the room and it was directly opposite to the bed. Valentina took the chair and sat in it.

John was silent for a long time, time had passed before he started talking again.

"They told you you're the first Luna in years right?!"

She nodded.

"Yes. Something like that."

The man nodded.

"Yes. But I'm guessing they didn't tell you why."

No. She never heard a why. She never got a full story either. Just vague answers.

"And why is that? Why did they hide it from me?"

"Well. I wouldn't know... I haven't been here in years."

"Okay."

"But. I would like to tell you about the curse. Because it is an interesting story. One that I think you'd like."

John remarked as he nodded his head enthusiastically.

"So long ago, really long ago, let's say at least four centuries before, our pack was formed. It was amongst one of the very first werewolf packs and it was run by a very powerful alpha. His name is lost to time, I truly cannot remember, but he was known as the Alpha of Bloodshed. Because he liked the taste of the blood of his enemies."

"Back then, werewolves were more primal, territorial, none of this kumbaya shit they do now. Back then they were fighting over lands and territories almost every day. It was a usual occurrence and it was seen as a particularly great feat to own a very large territory."

On one of such battles this alpha of bloodshed met a woman. She would go on to become our first Luna. Strong, powerful, she came from a pack across the wide seas. She was a rare breed, with special werewolf powers."

"There were a lot of unfounded rumours that she was part werewolf and her mother had been a witch and that was how she got her special powers."

"Anyways, the two become one under the night of the full moon and their union seems blissful, only for a few weeks."

"Now this Alpha of Bloodshed had a brother. A brother who had not expected his brother to ever find a Luna and mate. He thought he was next in line to the throne, but with a new Luna that position was unlikely. The new Luna got pregnant and the tension grew even more. One morning she woke up covered in a pool of sweat and blood and she lost the baby."

"Oh."

Valentina said.

"Yes. This went on to happen three more times. The Luna kept losing her children before they were even born, and the alpha became impatient. His brother urged him to send the Luna away, claiming she was bad luck. The Alpha pondered on his brother's advice but did something different. He started to see a young lady in his pack and as the moon goddess would have it, she got pregnant and bore him a son. When the Luna found out about this she was enraged. The Alpha, in his guilt and fear ordered for her exile. She left alright, but not before cursing the land and everyone in it."

"And what was the curse?"

Valentina asked impatiently.

John gave her a look.

"What do you think?"

"Hnmm..."

"She cursed them and left. And the pack never had a Luna since then... since you."

"That's a nice story. Really, it is,  but I'm struggling to see what this has to do with me."

Valentina asked and John chuckled as he scratched his beard.

"Everything!"

"It has everything to do with you."

"I'm just letting you know what you're getting into."

He added in a low voice.

"What do you mean?"

Valentina tilted her head forward and looked at the man.

John looked around and then moved closer to her.

"This pack is cursed. And the curse of the Luna manifests in different ways. You may not see it now, but you'll definitely see it later."

Valentina was tired.

She was going to run away soon, she didn't care about any curse. Or what it could do to her. She just wanted her memory back.

She wanted to know who she truly was. What she liked doing for fun and most importantly she wanted to get the hell out of the house. And never look back.

"I lost my memory. I can't remember anything and I have no connection to my wolf."

"Can you help me or not?"

She asked and John scratched his beard again.

"You must have remembered something. What have you remembered?!"

She was about to snap at the old man and tell him she remembered nothing when she remembered the woman who she thought was her mother singing a lullaby.

"Well. I remember a woman singing to me. I think she might be my mother. That's all I can remember for now."

John nodded. He was calm.
Calm and collected and Valentina wondered if that was how he truly was or if it was all an act.

"And that's all?"

"Yes. That's all."

John stood up from the bed. There was a duffel bag around the corner of  the room, he went and picked it up. He rummaged in it for at least two minutes before turning back to look at Valentina.

"Lie on the bed please. I'm going to do a simple examination."

"What?"

She asked and he repeated his statement.

Slowly, Valentina stood up from her chair and laid on the bed, she stared at John a little bit more but the man didn't say anything.

"Acupuncture has been used for years to diagnose and treats illnesses."
He said.

He brought out a small bag and opened it, she gulped when she saw the tiny long needles.

"You use acupuncture?!"

She asked and he nodded.

"To diagnose sometimes. I have other methods, but I believe this one is the best."

She started to tremble slightly.

"Wait wait wait! You're going to stick that into me?!"

"It's not going to hurt."

John didn't even try to sound convincing.


Valentina sat up from the bed.

"There should be another way. One that doesn't involve you sticking needles on me!"

John looked deep in thought. Then he brought out one of the needles and showed Valentina.

"Are you scared of needles? Is that it?"

He asked and she was about to say no when another memory came.

*"It's just a needle baby. I promise it'll only hurt for a second and then it won't hurt again."

*The voice was soft and sweet. It sounded vaguely familiar, like she had heard it before. But then there was another voice.

*"Lily she doesn't want it! We'll find another way."*

*"What way Nana?! She's sick!" The gentler voice said, sounding a little more agitated.*

*"She's strong. You worry too much. She'll be fine."*

*Someone hovered above her and she saw the face of an old woman. With short grey curly hair and a pink blouse that had ruffles on the side.
*
*The old woman smiled at her, then stroked her face.*

*"Nana."

*She called out before opening her eyes.*


She looked at John. John was staring at her. She looked around, he had put away the needles. She sighed in relief.

"Another memory?"

He asked and she nodded.

"Yes."

"You were confronted with a memory when you saw a needle, something you were afraid of, so it triggered your memories."

She nodded her head slowly.

"What about the first time?"

John asked and she tried to remember. Well the first time was with Colin and Mrs Parson.

"I heard a voice and I saw my mother, singing to me, I think the voice reminded me of my mother."

John nodded.

"That's good."

"Your memories will come back soon."

"How do you know?"

She asked and he shrugged.

"I just know. I also know that the reason it hasn't come fully now is because there is a mental block in your mind, preventing you from fully accessing them."

"A mental block?"

John nodded as he touched her hand abruptly.

"I will try and find what the block is."

"How?"

The man smiled uneasily.

"I'm not a just an ordinary healer. Here, drink this."

He passed her a vial.

"What is it?!"

"You'll lose consciousness for a while. Just a while. I'll be able to get into your mind."

"Drink it quickly. It takes effect a little slowly."

She nodded and opened the vial, pouring the contents down her throat.



..................



Luna.

The young lady was the Luna. She was so young, John thought as he touched her forehead and when she slept she looked so peaceful. So calm.

He looked at the time, it was approximately fifteen minutes after giving her the contents of the vial.

He didn't like doing this. It was the part of his healing capabilities that he didn't like using, but it was the one he was required to use the most.

Nobody truly cared for his knowledge of herbs, or acupuncture. Especially not Remington's father.

Remington's father had been obsessed with one thing and one thing alone. Breaking the curse and finding his own mate and Luna.

They had spent hours sometimes, hours on end with John searching and searching for his mate. And he never found her. He never did.

John would emerge from these meetings drained, so drained that he wouldn't be able to walk. He made a vow to leave, just as soon as the alpha died, lest his son had the same mental Illness and obsession with finding a mate.

And so when the alpha died, John packed his luggage and left while they were all still in mourning. He didn't look back, he never looked back.

He looked at Valentina again and sighed.

He closed his eyes and willed his transformation.

Just a little.

Just a little of it.

His nails grew, elongating and becoming claw like, like it would as a wolf.

He slowly sank his claws into the middle of her head and he let the feeling wash all over him.

It felt like hours, but John knew it was only a few minutes.

Valentina's mind was a vast emptiness. Nothing.

There was nothing.

Nothing except a figure in the corner. He suspected it was her wolf, at least the consciousness of it.

Whatever remained.

He stopped and cleared his throat.

The figure didn't move.

He cleared his throat again.

Nothing.

He was running out of time. The drug would soon wear off and Valentina would wake up. And it was dangerous for her to regain consciousness while his claws were still in her.

He rushed towards the figure,  but the more he ran the farther it moved away from him.

This was futile!

Hopeless!

He thought in annoyance as he stopped.

"Fine then. Stay there! I won't help you."

He said as he turned his back on the figure.

*"And when will you realise I don't want your help?!"
*
A sinister voice answered.

John felt as if he had been struck, and in a second he was stumbling out of Valentina's mind and right back to the present where he found himself on the floor.

With three of his claws broken.


###chapter 24 - Ever been to Alaska

John emerged from the room at looked at Remy.

"You can take her away. The effects of the drugs would wear off soon."

He murmured.

"So what did you find?!"

He asked and the old man looked away mumbling.

"She'll regain her memories naturally."

He answered.

Marielle glared at him, she looked like she was ready to hit him. 

"So you didn't do anything?"

She asked and he shook his head.

"I did. I did help her. I did as much as I could,  but in the end it all depends on her."

Remy's fist tightened.

"This wasn't what you said before. This isn't our deal. You were supposed to heal her!!"

"And I tried! Trust me I did."

He said as he raised his hand, showing his broken claws.

Remy glanced at Marielle, then back at John.

"Did she do this to you?!"

He asked and John nodded. It was now that Remy realised that the old man was slightly trembling.

"Yes. She pushed me out of her mind. That has never happened before. Never ever."

"Well... that can't be good right?! What does that mean?"

Marielle asked and the old man shrugged.

"It's not good. And it has never happened before."

"Please. Take her away. Once I take my rest I'll leave."

"We should discuss the terms of my payments before I leave."

He added and Marielle narrowed her eyes at him.

"Payment for what?! You didn't do anything!"

John waved her away.

"I still offered my services. And you should be grateful. Besides, she has been regaining her memories."

"What?!"

Remy and Marielle said at the same time. Both alarmed and confused.

John looked up at them.

"She didn't tell you?"

"Well she had a memory of her mother. And her hate for needles or something."

"She didn't tell me."

Remy said as he walked into the room.

Valentina was on the bed, unconscious like the old man said. Remy moved her hair away from her face and he gently carried her in his arms.

She didn't stir.


****************



When Valentina woke up, John had left, almost as if nothing had happened and she was left with a huge headache. Ellen made her some tea for her headache, while she wondered what the 'healer' had done.

Nothing so far. The downcast look on Ellen and Marielle's faces said it all. They were disappointed in the healer. And the fact that he had done nothing of importance.

Valentina wished she cared as much as they did, but she wasn't the one with the hidden agenda.

The ritual that Remy mentioned in his study and the curse that John had told her about must have been intertwined one way or the other.

It must have. Because that was the only reason she could come up with.

"How do you feel?"

Ellen murmured as she gently stroked her head. Valentina smiled uneasily.

"I'm fine."

She said as she wiggled out of the woman's grasp. She liked Ellen, but Ellen had hidden things from her too. Things that she shouldn't have. Things about the curse and the ritual which she was sure that she knew about. 

Remy walked in next. He had a frown on his face, but he still managed to speak to her calmly.

"How do you feel?"

He asked as he walked in.

Valentina nodded her head slowly.

"Headache."

She said as she pointed to her head.

"That's normal. It should go in the next few hours."

He turned to his mother.

"Mom can you leave me with Valentina? We want to discuss something."

He asked politely and the woman nodded.

"Very well."

She looked at Valentina again.

"I'll come check up on you later okay?"

"Okay."

Valentina said as she nodded her head.

They both watched her leave the room.

Remy turned to look at Valentina. She was in a simple T-shirt and shorts, but her legs and half of her upper body were under the sheets. Her hair was a mess because they had to clean up the bleeding from the incision John's claws made. They would heal faster, only because of the tea. At least he had the good sense to leave herbs that would make her go back to normal.

"So nothing happened with John. That was futile."

Remy said she.  She nodded slowly.

"He told me about the curse. I wonder why you left that out in your story."

Remy glanced at her.

His amber eyes seemed to glow as the rays of the sun from the blinds cast their light on his face.

"I didn't leave it out. It's a story that's been passed down over the years and over the years there's been so many variations of it that it doesn't even sound real anymore."

Valentina shrugged, that sounded like he was trying to give her an excuse for hiding the story from her.

"I still should have known. I mean I'm the first Luna your pack has had in a long time. I should think that counts for something at least."

Remy raised an eyebrow.

"Pray tell. What does it count for?"

He asked and she stayed silent.

"You didn't tell me you got some if your memories back."

"Only two."

She muttered as she sipped the tea. It was tasteless really, but it was green and it had quite a strong smell. It reminded her of grass and dirt. Really bad dirt.

"I think that's an important piece of information for me to know."

"I didn't think it was necessary."

She fired back and he sighed.


Remy rubbed at his face and groaned.

"What's going on with you Valentina?! I thought, I thought we were getting better. I thought we were becoming friends and coming to an understanding."

She wanted to retort something along the lines of how she could never be friends with someone who was only using her but she held her tongue.

"Why? Because you held me all night during my heat period?"

Remy opened his eyes but no words came out.

"Or because we're in this sham of a marriage? Which you yourself admitted to the fact that we didn't get married out of love."

"Or is it because you gave me your credit card and gave me permission to go out?"

"You must have thought you were doing me a favour then."

"No. I thought I was making you happy. That's all."

Remy's voice sounded solemn. And Valentina blinked. She wasn't expecting his reply. Or what he said.

Had she taken it too far?

Maybe.

But it wasn't her fault.

He hid stuff from her.

"Ever been to Alaska?"

He asked and she shrugged.

"I wouldn't know."

She murmured.

"Well we're going to Alaska. We've been invited to a ceremony."


**********************

Valentina had seen pictures of the rugged wilderness, majestic mountains, and the awe-inspiring Northern Lights, and she knew that she had to experience it for herself.

She was finally going to see Alaska and even though she had feigned ignorance, she had looked at pictures and videos online in excitement. She had also gone shopping for winter coats with Ellen.

As their plane descended through the clouds, she saw the vast expanse of snow-capped mountains and glaciers stretching out before her. She could hardly contain her excitement as she disembarked and set foot on the tarmac, with Remy behind her and Kale too.

The cold air hit her like a wall, but Valentina was prepared. She had bundled up in her warmest coat, hat, and gloves and was ready to explore Alaska.

Before their trip, Remy had sat her down and talked to her.

"Please. This is a really important trip. I'd like to at least pretend to be a couple."

He had said.

"You want us to lie?"

Valentina asked and Remy shrugged.

"You can call it whatever you like. But these people are werewolves like us, they will be watching us closely. Act like my Luna and mate. That's all I ask from you."

"And what does that entail?"

She asked him.

"Well, just follow my lead, keep your head held high and don't push me away when I try to hold you."

He replied and she nodded.

She didn't care. At least not yet.

They were going to a small town called Talkeetna, nestled deep in the heart of Alaska,
where Remy had explained had more werewolves that human. The drive to the town was one of the most beautiful experiences of Valentina's life. The road snaked through mountains and forests, with rivers and streams glistening in the sunlight.


When they finally arrived in Talkeetna, she was amazed by how small and cozy the town was. The buildings were all made of wood, and there was a friendly, welcoming atmosphere in the air.

A couple was already waiting outside for them the moment they arrived.

"That's Jaxon. Alpha of the Moonbeam pack and that's his mate and Luna Kinsley. They just had their son, their heir. So it's customary for them to throw a big ceremony."

Remy explained.

"That's interesting. Is that the only reason why we're here?"

She asked and Remy and Kale exchanged glances.

"They also have something we need. That's the real reason why we're here."


###chapter 25 - It is unruly to fight.


"Welcome!!! Welcome! It's so nice to see you again."

Jaxon said as he pulled Remy into a big hug. He was a short man, but he was stocky, still, Remy towered over him. With his big arms and his tall height. 

"You too Jaxon! It's beautiful this time of the year. Thank you for inviting us."

He said and Jaxon smiled. 

Valentina could see Jaxon and  his Luna looking at her keenly.

"And who is the beautiful lady?"

Kinsley asked and Remy smiled and pulled her close, she tried not to look too shocked, instead she forced a smile.

"This is my mate and our Luna, Valentina."

Jaxon and Kinsley exchanged a look.

"Are you serious?!"

They asked and Remy nodded.

"Yes. Yes I am."

"Wow! This really calls for a celebration."

Jaxon said as he laughed uncomfortably.

"And congratulations on your heir. I know it's a happy occasion for you."

"Thank you. It really is. We're so glad you could make it."

Kinsley replied.

"Please come in. It must be cold."

Jaxon led them out of the cold and into a small cabin that they would be inhabiting. He talked with Remy oustide while Valentina decided to settle in. Kale brought in their luggage.

Valentina stayed inside for a bit, watching the frozen wonderland from outside their bedroom window. From the little she had inspected the cabin was cozy. With two bedroom and one bathroom, they would spend a lot of time sharing a lot of things. Especially with Kale. 

On their way to the town, the snow-capped mountains, the vast stretches of tundra, and the icy blue lakes all took her breath away. And now as she looked outside the window she knew that she would find a way to enjoy her stay there. 

Maybe hiking or something as simple as fishing. 

She was willing to try it all. 

At least she'd be able to have some fun. Remy had told her nothing as regards to why they were there. His answers had been vague and she had no strength to pursue the conversation. She would have, but she didn't even want to know.
She was leaving very soon anyway, plotting and mapping out her escape route inside her head. 

The best time and way for her to leave without even being noticed.

Remy walked inside the room, his large frame made the room even look smaller and as he took off his jacket, Valentina quickly looked away. He had only worn some flimsy jacket and from what Ellen had told her werewolves were able to regulate their body heat, the cold wouldn't affect him, or Kale but it would affect her. They had bought winter clothes just as a precaution, but Valentina really needed it.

The chill was the first thing to hit her as soon as she got off the plane. Thankfully, she had been prepared. 

"I'm sorry about earlier. But you know I had to make it real."

She shrugged.

"You already warned me. I wasn't too surprised."

She replied as she continue looking outside the window, waiting for him to leave. 

"Is everything okay with you Valentina?"

Remy asked in a very concerned tone. 

She turned to him and nodded her head. 

"Everything is fine."


..........


Later in the evening after she had put away her  luggage and changed into something equally comfortable, but still bulky, they had walked over to Jaxon and Kinsley's house. The two had invited them over for dinner, ahead of the festivities and Valentina heard a little history about the town. Majority of the inhabitants of the small town were wolves, the ones who weren't were fully aware that werewolves lived among them, but they preferred the proximity because it kept them safe. 

Jaxon was alpha of his pack only because of his bloodline.  Jaxon's bloodline which was said to be the strongest, bred alphas. Each alpha had the task of creating a new alpha. And it was a cause for celebration when a baby was born to the alpha and his Luna, because they just secured their next in line and fulfilled their duty of continuing the bloodline. 

Jaxon's pack was mostly solitary, they kept to themselves, they rarely traveled or lived outside their habitat but they had their own strengths and they were a formidable ally to have.


"Here. Have some more bread."

Kinsley said as she passed the bread to Valentina for the second time. Her alpha shot her a look.

"I think our guest has had her fill."

He murmured and she smiled at him lovingly. Then turned her attention back to Valentina.

"You've barely touched your food. Are you not hungry? Is the food not to your liking?"

Valentina forced a smile.

"No it's really good. I've had my fill."

She said as she pushed the plate away.

"Thank you for the meal. I'm so glad you invited us."

Kinsley smiled warmly. She looked like a genuinely nice woman, but Valentina felt she might just be playing nice because she was nosy. She had been trying to strike a conversation with her all dinner.

"You're welcome. We don't get guests this often. So we're glad you could make it."

The woman replied. 

"On that topic, while I'm grateful that you are here, I still can't help but wonder why you honored my invitation."

Remy chuckled. 

"Do you doubt my good intentions?"

He asked and Jaxon shook his head.

"No. But I also know you're not coming all the way from LA to congratulate me on my newborn heir. Why is it you're here?"

Valentina glanced at Remy. Well Jaxon did have a point, there was no way Remy wasn't coming all the way to Alaska for something else, something even he had not told her yet.

But as they sat and ate their dinner, she knew there was no way Remy would be able to ignore the question, at least not without looking even more guilty.

Valentina's heart quickened at the thought of the fact that he would have no choice but to tell her what he came there for to her face. 

"Well, apart from the obvious, I think it's pretty obvious."

He answered vaguely.

Jaxon's eyes darted around the two of them. He looked like he was calculating and thinking and many things behind those inquisitive eyes of his.

"We've held on to the mantle for at least three years now. As it is our right to..."

Jaxon explained.

Remy nodded  as he wiped the corners of his mouth, finally letting go of his fork.

"Of course. You're right. It is your right to. But as next in line to hold the mantle, one grows weary when rumors start to fly."

They were talking but Valentina could barely make out what they were talking about.

She didn't understand it at all, or why it was so important.

Jaxon and Remy appeared to be in a very heated staring contest and Remy was winning. Jaxon's gaze had faltered at least twice. 

"What rumors are you talking about? We've heard none of that."

Jaxon sounded mildly confused. 

Remy smirked.

"I knew you would say that."

He murmured.

"Say what?!"

Jaxon fired back.

"Deny the fact that you've heard the rumors. It's not a very smart thing to do when your own Beta has been talking about it."

Jaxon fell silent. 

"Remy, why are you doing this? The mantle will pass to your pack after you've met all the requirements. Are you scared you would never meet the requirements?"

Jaxon's voice sounded mildly taunting. 

Remy shot him a look. 

"I'm not scared of that. I'm not scared of anything. But I wonder exactly how free and fair this would be if you keep interfering with public opinion just to make the mantle stay with you a little longer."


"What makes you think I have a hand in all this?"

Remy scoffed.

"Oh Jaxon, it's common knowledge that you wouldn't mind a little tussle in the snow. You like to play dirty, I'm just wondering what your gain is in all this."

Jaxon chuckled.

"I invite you to my house to celebrate and you level accusations at me. I do not take this lightly." He sounded slightly agitated and Remy looked amused.

"I'm not here to fight you Jaxon. We both know who would win. But, I am finally sick and tired of the mind games you've been playing in the background."

"Oh stop this madness Remington! You have no evidence of this!"

Kinsley replied angrily, almost flinging her fork at Remy's head.

Jaxon looked ready to pounce at Remy.

Valentina looked at all of them, utterly and thoroughly confused on what exactly was going on.

Mantle?

What the hell was that.

What were they talking about?

"I think we should all calm down. We're supposed to be eating dinner..."

Valentina said quickly. 

Everyone paused. 

"It's unruly to fight at the dinner table."

She murmured as she turned to Remy and touched his hand gently. 

Remy smiled uneasily.

"I'm sorry about that my love."

He said as he drew her in and kissed her on the lips.

###chapter 26 - The Aurora


"What was that all about?!"

Valentina exclaimed when they were safely back in the confines of their cabin. Dinner had been awkward after, but at least Jaxon and Remy remained civil with each other. 

Kinsley had shown them the baby, red faced and chubby, Valentina didn't think too much about the little fella, but she gushed about how cute he was to make Kinsley feel better. 

Remy sighed as he rubbed at his face. 

"You really want to know?"

"Well that's why I'm asking you!"

Remy sighed as he started taking off his shoes.

"Well... Jaxon is..."

"I'm not talking about Jaxon!! I'm talking about you just kissing me out of nowhere!"

Remy mouthed an oh. 

"Oh. I'm sorry."

"Sorry?! That's all you're going to say?!"

"Well what else do you want me to say. I told you what to expect."

"You didn't mention anything about kissing me."

Remy scoffed.

"That was not a kiss. That was just a small peck on the lips to deescalate the situation."

"Well I didn't agree to do that!"

Remy sighed.

"I'm sorry. It was a spur of the moment sort of thing. But I did warn you about it. We were going to be acting like a real couple."

"Did you forget that?"

Valentina sighed and rolled her eyes. 

She couldn't get warm, no matter how much she tried. She left on her bulky winter jacket, she was probably going to sleep in them since the house was just as cold as it was outside. No heater in it too. 

"Whatever."

She murmured.

"What about Jaxon? The mantle stuff you were talking about?! What's that about?"

She asked and he sighed. 

"Oh well. It's a long story."

"I want to know."

She persisted.

"Alright then. I'll tell you about the mantle."

"It was originally named the Cezar box. It is a special statue of power amongst the founding werewolf families. This mantle spends at least a three years or even up to a decade with each family before moving to the next. But the next pack must prove themselves worthy before the mantle can move to them. It allows them to have special immunities, attend and be privy to otherworldly powers and information and enjoy limitless prosperity."

"Has the mantle ever moved to your pack?"

Valentina asked and Remy flinched. 

"Once. But we don't like to talk about it. It was a really long time and a bad time for all involved. But long story short the alpha then lost the mantle and our pack was deemed unfit to have it. That stigma has remained ever since then and my father and his father before him we've been trying our hardest to rid ourselves of that stigma."

"So they still think you're unfit?"

Remy shrugged.

"Well it's one thing or the other with them. Our lack of a Luna for decades also added to it. But over the years we've proven ourselves to be strong enough to hold the mantle. But then we've been hearing rumors. Secret meetings too, almost as if they're all working against us."

"Any reason why?"

Valentina asked and Remy chuckled.

"This mantle is a power symbol Valentina. And if there's one thing people want, it's more power. No family ever truly wants to give up the mantle." 

"So Jaxon wants to keep it?"

He nodded his head.

"It certainly seems like it."

"Well... that sounds like a sticky situation."

She murmured as she sat down on the bed. She was surprised he told her so much, but there were still things he was hiding from her, like the ritual, so far he had still not mentioned anything about it and she wondered if he ever would. 

The two of them were silent for a while. Remy taking off his bulky boots and putting them away while Valentina examined the cabin for what seemed to be the tenth time.

They had not talked much about their sleeping arrangements but it was clear they would be sleeping together.

Kale and Remy couldn't share a bed, it would be very uncomfortable for them. And the sofa in the small living room would never be comfortable enough for Remy. It was made for sitting and even with that it was really small. The only available option was that they'd share a room.


Something they had done before, but she had not objected to it then because she needed his help, this time, with everything that happened, she wouldn't object to it but she wasn't exactly open to the idea. 

She looked outside the window and sighed. 

"It looks so beautiful outside."

"Do you wanna go for a walk?"

Remy suggested.

She gave him a look.

"With you?"

"I'll only be there  to make sure you're safe and you don't get lost."

"Oh that's comforting."

Valentina murmured.

"Alright then. We can take a walk."

She replied. 



...............



It was supposed to be a short walk, but what was a short walk became a hike. Remy had  told her that they could see the northern lights if they walked a little bit further and the thought of seeing the Aurora Borealis made her beam with joy. She was instantly reenergized and she walked faster, not minding that it was the middle of the night and it was almost nearly pitch black.

Remy had good eyesight and navigated the frozen woods for her, so she didn't have to worry about anything else. 

After a long time of hiking through the wilderness, they finally made it to a clearing where they could see the northern lights dancing in the sky above them. 

"I... I have no words."

She murmured and Remy smiled as he watched her. She was completely enraptured with it, to the point where she stood perfectly still and stopped complaining about the cold air biting at her now reddened cheeks. 

She looked up at him and smiled and he walked closer to her. 

They stood there in awe and slowly, Remy took her hand in his, silently hoping that she wouldn't push him away.

She didn't, she was too mesmerized by the colors and patterns swirling above her.

The sky was pitch black except for the neon green, purple, and pink lights that illuminated the surroundings. The auroras looked like a soft and delicate dance, waving and twisting across the sky in fluid motions.

Valentina slowly leaned into Remy's shoulder as they watched the magnificent display, feeling the warmth of his body and his breath on her skin.

The temperature was freezing, but she didn't care, the warmth radiating from Remy was enough, more than enough to keep her warm. 

They were too busy staring up at the sky and marveling at the beauty of it all. 

Valentina and Remy had never felt so alive and connected. It was if they were the only two people on earth, lost in their own world.

They stayed there for what might have been hours, wrapped in each other's arms, watching the northern lights until they slowly started to fade away. As the last glimmers of light faded, they knew they had just witnessed something truly special.

Valentina turned to Remy, her heart beating fast with excitement. "Did you see that?! That was magical. I've never seen anything so beautiful," she whispered.


Rent smiled back at her, his eyes sparkling in the darkness, the fact that she was so excited and happy about seeing the northern lights made him equally happy too. 

And at peace. 

"I know. I don't think I've seen anything more beautiful."

That was a small lie on his part, because he had, he had seen something more beautiful than the northern lights, and it was the smile on Valentina's face. Watching her entire face light up with joy as she looked at them, he had never seen her so happy before. 

He couldn't tell her.

No not yet she would never understand or reciprocate his feelings. So he kept it to himself  and decided to enjoy the moment. 

Because it might be all he had. And probably the first and only time he would see her smile so fully. 

When she regained her memories, she would go back to her old self. He would never see that smile again, at least not with him. 


The two of them stood there for a moment longer, taking in the last of the northern lights before turning to make their way back to the cabin. They knew they would remember the moment forever, and it would be a memory that would always bring them back to that magical place in Alaska.



###chapter 27 - the woman who came back to life.
It was very early in the morning when the ceremony began. Valentina was there for the first thirty minutes of it out of courtesy for Jaxon and Kinsley. After which she had excused herself.

Hiking at night had taken a toll on her. And Remy too. After watching the northern lights, she was so tired and drained that Remy had to carry her all the way back home. And when they finally settled in to get some sleep, they barely got at least two hours of sleep before Kale came to wake them up.

Apparently the ceremony began at the crack of dawn then all the other festivities continued for the rest of the day. She had come out for public appearances only and she nestled back into her bed once she started to feel the brutal sting of the cold. 

Luckily, they would be leaving soon, she couldn't deny the beauty of Alaska, but she didn't want to spend an extra day in the cold. 

She was tired and she felt cold all the time. Her fingers were always numb from the cold and she was constantly rubbing her hands together. Unfortunately, she was the only one whom the cold seemed to be affecting since the rest were all werwolves, their body temperature was warm and regulated. 

For once, she missed her bed, she missed the mansion. She missed Ellen fussing all over her and she missed Marielle with her weird gazes and cryptic questions. It was too bad she was going to have to leave all of them, because she definitely knew and she was sure that she was going to miss them a lot.

But she had to leave. Remy was not being truthful to her and she could not stand it. She could not stand being a pawn in whatever game he was playing at. Even though he had told her about the mantle, he still didn't mention anything about the ritual which led her to believe that there was more that he wasn't telling her. 

She had been plotting her escape since then. She wasn't sure where she would go yet but her mind kept drawing her back to that town. Maybe the town would have the answers that she was looking for, even though something about the same town seemed to always trigger her nightmares. 

She would still leave. All that remained was how to sneak past Remy and make sure that he never followed her or got where she was going. 





.................... 



Valentina did not return home with Remy. no, she did not. When they arrived at the airport she had made the flimsy excuse of wanting to go to the bathroom. Kale was meant to follow her and stay at alert but she had pretended and sent him panicking to buy some tampons for her. He had fell for her trick, even though it wasn't really a trick, she really did get her period, the only part where she lied was where she pretended as if she didn't have any tampons.

Poor Kale had left looking so stressed while searching for tampons and she had slipped out of the airport and took the first taxi out of there. 

The first thing she did was get a change of clothes and a new phone, one that Remy wouldn't be able to call or blow up. Surprisingly, he had not started calling her yet. She wondered if that meant he was close to finding her or he that he had truly given up on her. 

Then she went back to the town. And as usual, the sense of nostalgia that hit her seemed like a familiar feeling that she normally craved. 

She had withdrawn a lot of cash back at the department store where she got clothes, just so Remy wouldn't track the credit card payments to the recent place that she was going to. And it worked. 

She lodged at a boarding house this time, sceptical of hotels and motels and knowing that that was where Remy was going to look first. And after that she wondered what she was going to do with her newfound freedom. 

Valentina quickly found out that her newfound freedom sort of bored her. Running wasn't fun when there was nobody chasing you. In fact, she was almost tempted to call Remy and give him some clues, but she stopped herself. After about four days in town, she ditched the hat and scarf disguise, it was quite clear that Remy wasn't in town searching for her.

And with no memory of who she was once or what the town meant to her, she quickly grew tired of lounging around aimlessly. 

On the fifth day, she decided to go to the hospital.

The hospital where he had been rescued. Sure, it was meant to at least hold some answers for her. She thought as she looked up a few of the stories connected to her death and resurrection on the town's local sites. 

Apparently, she was quite the local media sensation. Her story was the best news the town had in years and they couldn't stop talking about it for weeks.



"Dr Calloway will see you now."

The nurse said as she let her into the doctor's office. She had been waiting for a total time of at least twenty minutes and would have given up and left if she had anything serious to do. But her days, much like her nights were restless and filled with nothing but the thirst for answers and the relentless boredom that plagued her. 

Dr Calloway was an old man, but he had a kind face. He stood up when he saw her a small smile on his face. He looked pleased to see her. Valentina was relieved, she didn't even know that he would have granted her an audience. 

"Mrs Combe! What a pleasant surprise."

Valentina smiled bashfully. 

"Dr Calloway. I hope I'm not taking too much f your time by requesting for this meeting..."

Dr Calloway shook his head. 

"Nonsense.I was stunned when the nurse told me you were waiting for me in the hallway. I became very curious.."

"If you don't mind me asking, what is the purpose of this visit?"

He asked. The both settled in their seats, Calloway behind the desk and his monitor and Valentina in front of him. 

"Well.. I just needed some answers. And it looks like you're the only one who can give them to me..."

"She started and Calloway raised an eyebrow. 

"I'm not sure of how I can be of any help to you Mrs Combe."

"Oh! In many ways Dr Calloway. Many many ways."

"I want to know about my death. I want to know how I was brought in here, what happened that day..."

Calloway leaned forward, his eyes wide with confusion. 

"You still don't remember?"

He asked and she nodded her head. 

"No. I don't"

She added. 

The doctor was silent after that. His lips formed into a deep line and his expression became unreadable. Then , after what seemed to be a really really long time, he finally spoke. 

"It was around midnight, I was tired, my shift was about to end so I was looking at a patient while you were brought in. Some hiker had found you in the woods. He didn't know what was wrong but when he found you, you were lifeless with no pulse."

Valentina shifted uncomfortably in her seat. 

"It was a mystery. There was no identifiable marks on your body or sign that you had struggled or been poisoned or been hurt in any way that showed that you had suffered physical pain. It just looked like you were sleeping."

"But you had been declared dead. All that was left was an autopsy report to find out what exactly killed you."

"What about my clothes, didn't they have any ID or anything on them?"

She asked and the doctor shook his head. 

"No. They didn't."

"We didn't even find a wallet."

He added sadly. 

That was why they had declared her missing and probably how Remy had been able to find her because the news of the missing woman who came back from the dead was a sensational news that had spread far and wide. 

"And were you there when I woke up? Why do you think I woke up? How does that even work medically?"

Dr Calloway shrugged.

"I can tell you, there is no medical explanation possible that can explain you coming back alive. You were declared dead. No vitals, no heartbeat, no brain activity, there was nothing. It has been one of my greatest mysteries."

"But then.. you had woken up and then I just knew something was different."

Valentina leaned forward. 
"What do you mean?"

She asked and he shrugged. 

"I don't know. It just felt unusual. Unnatural. You were staring at your hands and legs for hours, like you couldn't believe that they were yours."

"I don't understand."

She shook her head in confusion. 

What did he mean?

Dr Calloway nodded. 

He didn't understand either. And he had struggled to understand it for a long time but he couldn't pretend like he did. But he was sure of one thing, when she first woke up, she acted like really really strange. 



...............



"Hello."

The voice was frantic, muffled. 

There was a short grunt in reply, followed by a gruff voice. 

"What is it?!"

"Well, you asked me to give you a call if I saw that woman again. I just did."

"What?! Where?!"

"In our hospital. She's in our doctor's office right now."

"And you're sure it's Valentina Combe?"

The woman wiped her brow as she nodded, looking around frantically to avoid being caught. 

"Yes. It's the dead woman who came back to life."






###chapter 28 - Danger Lurks 

After seeing Doctor Calloway, she went home distraught and confused. Nothing was working. She didn't know why or how, but it was getting increasingly hard to find out who she was. 

In the boarding house, she settled for some crackers and soda, since having dinner would require her either using the communal kitchen or going out to buy lunch. 

She had thought escaping would be freeing and fun, but it made her feel trapped in a way. Trapped in the never ending reality that she would never be able to recover her memories and would forever remain lost to her own self. 

A stranger to the life she was living and the people she knew. It wasn't very easy, not being able to remember. 

She picked up her phone and contemplated calling Remington.  Somehow, in some way she missed him, more than she cared to admit. With his long black hair, his intense eyes and the way he never ceased to protect her. If she was being brutally honest with herself, Remington wasn't actually all that bad. 

He was good to her. He treated her well and she knew he would have given her her freedom on a platter if she had asked. 

But she didn't ask. And now spending time alone had made her miss him even more. She remembered their time at Alaska, it was a truly beautiful moment, she remembered falling asleep in his arms while she was in heat, how he would sometimes hold her when she had a nightmare. 

She remembered everything. 

Out of a spur of the moment thing she decided to go out again. Dr Calloway had been kind enough to tell her the spot where her body was found, she thought it was best she went there. Maybe being there would bring back some memories.

It was already late in the evening, but she went anyway, she had asked for directions and realized it was only a ten minutes walk from the boarding house.

She would walk.

She had switched her dress for jeans and a cropped top, her shoes were walking shoes. She had bought some clothes from the local shops to blend in, they somehow made her look like a teenager. She wore nothing but a pair of glasses, no makeup but some lipgloss as she started her walk to the spot. 

After only about two or three minutes of walking, it became increasingly obvious to Valentina that she was being followed. The man wasn't even trying to hide it, he had been following her since she left the boarding house.

And the large black hoodie that covered his face was a dead giveaway. 

It looked like Remy had finally caught up with her she thought as a wry smile appeared on her face. She should have expected him, that he would not leave her hanging for so long. 

She continued her walk, but then as she approached a dark alleyway she took a turn into it, ready to confront Remy's man.

She would tell whoever he sent to stop following her. And to tell Remy to leave her alone and let her do things on her own terms.

That would be all. 

She paused and turned, the man in the hoodie turned around the corner and revealed his face. Valentina stilled. 

Wait a minute. 

She thought as she stepped back a little.
The man didn't look like one of Remy's men. Not with the bald head and the snake tattoo, she had seen a lot of the men that were in Remy's park, none of them looked like him. Not even the scary looking once.

Oh no, he looked like a thug. 

And he was walking towards her. Another man showed up, in the same black clothes, but no disguise this time.

He smiled at her fondly, like he knew her.

"So we meet again Valentina. It's been too long mi amor!"


She was tied and gagged. Like some common prisoner at the back of a van at first, then they brought her to a house and dumped her in one of the empty rooms. She was tied to the chair again, her hands and legs tied so tightly that she could barely move, even her mouth was gagged. She tried to free herself, but the more she moved, the more the rope seemed to tighten around her legs and her wrists, causing them to hurt even more. She decided to give up and wait to see what they wanted. 

If it was money, then that could be easily arranged, she'd just call Remy. But if it wasn't and it was something else, she feared what it would be.


She must have been tied for at least ten minutes before someone finally came out to talk to her. 

The same man from earlier. Tall, dark clothes and bald. He looked at her like he knew her, his small beaded black eyes stared at her relentlessly without blinking and she had to admit she was curious about him, about him and what he wanted from her.

They removed her gag and she panted slightly. 

"Who are you?" 

Her voice was raspy and sore, but she managed to say a coherent statement. 

"Who am I?!"

She nodded.

"Are we playing games now Valentina?"

The man asked and she shrugged.

"I don't know who you are."

She answered and he chuckled. 

Another one of his men came into the room around the same time, he was the one with the tattoos, the one that had chased her at first.

"I'm not here to play games Valentina. That's your thing, not mine."

He answered and she shrugged.

"Well I'm not playing any games. I don't know who you are!"

"Or why you have tied me up like some common criminal!"

"Because that's exactly what you are!"

The man shouted.

"A common thief!! A criminal who stole from me!"

She relaxed in her chair.

Did this have to do with something from her past life? Did it have to do with her losing her memory? 

Did she truly steal something?

God this memory stuff was a bummer sometimes, she thought as she sighed.

"What did I steal from you?!"

She asked and the man looked livid.

"Perhaps, my man Shirley here might juggle your memories a bit."

He said as he pointed to the burly man behind him.

Valentina shifted nervously. 

"For every question you get wrong, he hits you."

Valentina shook her head nervously.

"I swear! I don't know anything! I can't remember anything!"

"Why did you run away from me?!"

"I-I I don't know!"

She answered.

The first blow came as a surprise, but it landed squarely on her left cheek and Valentina shuddered in horror at the pain that followed. 

..............

"How do you know she's here?"

Marielle asked and Remy smiled. They had arrived in town late in the morning, after leaving Hidden hills at the crack of dawn, with Remy determined that he would find Valentina there. 

"It's Valentina. She can be very predictable."

He answered as he looked around. The only issue now was where she was going to be, he already knew she was in town, he just had to find out where.

When Kale had run to him saying Valentina was missing, he wasn't shocked, just disappointed. Perhaps he had gotten the wrong idea while they were watching the northern lights, but he thought they were growing closer to each other. 

Apparently he was alone in his feelings, she didn't feel the same way. She never did before she lost her memories and she still didn't now.

It was time he gave up and stopped trying. 
For the first two days he didn't look for her, despite his mother's insistence and everyone edging him to find her.

"If she wants to leave she's free to leave. This is not her cage."

He had told his mother. 

"Bu-but she's your Luna!"

His mother had responded.

"And that has never meant anything to Valentina mother. Nothing at all! Even before she lost her memories she didn't care for me or how I was to her, why do you think now is any different?!"

"Remy please. She might be in danger."

That was the only thing that prompted him to look for her.

He would just check to be sure she wasn't in any danger. And then he would let her go forever. This time he wouldn't try again.


"So I've called up the hotels and motels in town, no one under the name of Valentina Combe."

"Do you think she's using an alias?"

Marielle asked and Remy shook her head.

"I don't think she would. But since she's not at the hotels and motels it'll mean she's looking for the less obvious ways of staying around without drawing attention to herself."

"And how will we find her then?!"

Remy scratched his chin.

"I'm thinking... I tried checking for Airbnbs but there's very few options for those. I'll talk to a local about how the housing situation works."

"Do you think she got her memories back?"

Marielle asked.

Remy didn't have any answer to that, but he didn't completely rule out the possibility. Besides, this wasn't the first time she tried to run away. Before she lost her memories she was trying to run away and after she lost them she was still trying. It was a pattern at this point, with or without her memory Valentina was always trying to run somewhere.

And it had to do with this town. Something about the town kept drawing her back, he just had to figure out what it was.
###chapter 29 - This is war.

"I'll find her by scent."

Remy finally decided and Marielle scoffed, that was a bad idea.

"That's a lot of ground to cover."

She remarked. 

He was aware of that, of the fact that they had a lot of ground to cover, but this was the only their way he could think of and despite the fact that it was pretty time consuming, he couldn't think of anything else that would be fast enough. 

"Do you need anything to jumpstart it for you, I think I can find a dress or something of hers in the car."

"No, I'm good. Start driving, I'l concentrate on finding her scent."

He murmured as they got into the car. He had never had to do this frequently, because he only used this method on prey, prey or people that he considered his enemies. 

Marielle drove around town, they went to the popular spots first, the cafes, the theatre, the bank and the mall, there was nothing and slowly as they moved towards the residential areas, Remy caught a whiff of her scent on the breeze. It was faint and distant, but unmistakably hers. 

"I'll continue on foot."

He murmured as he jumped out of the car, eager to find Valentina as fast as he could. 

Marielle nodded. 

"I'll drive around, see if I can ask the locals some questions."

As Remy walked through the empty streets, he caught whiffs of Valentina's scent - a hint of her perfume here, a trace of her shampoo there. It was enough to keep him going, to keep him searching.

But the town was small, and the scent trail led him in circles, Valentina had walked quite a lot. Remy's frustration grew with each passing moment, and he could feel his wolf clawing at his insides.

Just when he was about to give up hope, he caught a stronger whiff of Valentina's scent. It was coming from a small house at the end of the street, where a large white van was parked in the driveway, and Remy raced towards it, his heart pounding with hope and fear. There, the scent grew stronger, and Remy knew he was getting closer.

As he made his way through the street, his heightened senses allowed him to pick out her scent from everything else, he willed his mind to focus only on her scent as he tried to gauge what had happened by her scent alone. When he finally got close enough to the van, he could smell her fear, a strong and potent thing as this only made him even more angrier. 

The sun was setting, just from across the street where he was he standing and watching the house with quiet contemplation he could make out four heartbeats in the house. One was the familiar rhythm of Valentina's heart and the three other he could not decipher. 

He sent out a text to Marielle, alerting her and letting her know where she could pick them up. 

He went up to the front porch and knocked the door, ready to take on whoever and whatever that he saw. 



.............

He finally stopped hitting her. Valentina had stopped registering the pain after the third blow to her stomach. She had stopped answering the questions, it wasn't like she had answers to them anyways. Whatever it was they wanted from her, she didn't have it.

But something else was happening to her. As she closed her eyes she could see a face, pictures, people she knew.

Her memory was coming back.

At the worst fucking time too.

She remembered the night she died.

No she wasn't found in the woods by some hiker. She was in the car, driving home from the club with her friends after her birthday party. They were all drunk.

She had seen the truck, she had remembered screaming and then everything had gone blank.

That, that was what happened.

But her name, who she was, she wasn't Valentina Combe.

She was Goldie Parson.

As the realisation dawned on her, she started shaking her head.

If she was Goldie, that would mean she was dead and she was somehow in someone else's body.

"I'm dead?"

She muttered as she shook her head, refusing to believe the fact that confronted her.

"No. No."

She murmured to herself.

How did this happen?

How was she some strange woman?

The girl in her dreams was her.

It has always been her, nobody else but her. Her own self had been trying to make her remember who she was.

What had happened to her.

How did that happen?!

She thought in horror as tears started dropping from her face.

Not long after, she heard voices outside, then a loud thud. 

"Valentina?!"

A familiar voice called out, she almost cried out in tears. 

It was Remy. He had come to save her. 



..............



He had simply knocked the door, and a gruff voice had answered. 

"Who the fuck is that?"

"Open the door. I just wanna talk."

Remy answered, as calmly as he could muster, even with the anger burning inside of him. 

The air was thick with tension as a burly man opened the door, his muscles bulging and his eyes fierce with determination.

"Who the fuck are you?"

The man asked.

Remy didn't waste anytime as he landed a punch squarely on his face. The large man staggered back and fell. Two other men appeared from the end of the hallway. 

Remy knew he was outnumbered, but he refused to back down, not when he knew that Valentina was inside the house with them. 

He walked into the house, the man that he had knocked down struggled to get up, whispering curses as he did. The two men in front of him were no pushovers either, their faces contorted into sneers as they advanced, circling him like vultures. But Remy stood his ground, fists clenched and ready to strike.

The first attacker lunged at him, but he was too quick, dodging the blow and retaliating with a powerful punch that sent the man staggering backwards. The second and third men came at him together, but he was unfazed, his muscles rippling as he effortlessly took them both down with a swift kick and a crushing blow.

The first man was no less formidable, a towering figure with a menacing glare. But Remy  remained unfaltering, his eyes locked on his opponent as they circled each other warily. The man swung his fist, but he was too fast, ducking under the blow and delivering a brutal uppercut that sent the man crashing to the ground. They kept standing up, even after he had beaten them, which gave Remy the impression that they were no ordinary men. 

They were wolves, he could smell their wolf on them, but he couldn't make out which pack they were from. Which pack or its alpha would risk war with him by kidnapping his Luna? He couldn't fathom who or what would be out to get him or Valentina in such a way. 

Without warning, one of the men lunged at him, fists flying. He quickly sidestepped the attack, grabbed his opponent by the arm, and used his momentum to fling him into a nearby wall. The man landed with a thud and didn't get up.

The remaining two men rushed at him again, their faces twisted in anger. Remy stood his ground, his fists clenched and flying. He moved with an agility that belied his size, dodging their blows and countering with powerful strikes of his own.

The fight was fierce and brutal, but he never lost his focus, this was all just a warm up for him, he had not had a fight so good in weeks. He punched and kicked with precision, taking down his opponents one by one. The sound of fists hitting flesh echoed through the house, and the men grunted and groaned as they fell to the ground.

Bruised, bloodied and exhausted, they stayed on the ground longer this time. 

Remy looked around the house. 

"Valentina?!"

He called out. He heard no reply, but he decided to search the rooms anyways. The first door he opened, he saw her and his arms grew weak. 

He could barely recognise her. Not with all the bruises on her face. She looked up at him weakly, he could see the relief on his face and he wondered how long she had been there, how long she had endured their abuse. 

"I'm coming."

He murmured as he went out of the room and closed the door. 

He wasn't planning on doing any killing before, but there was no way in hell he was going to let it slide. Valentina was his mate and those men had hit her, they had bruised her, they had tried to kill her, he would never let that slide. 

He grabbed the closest man to him by the collar and smashed his head against the wall. There was a sickening thud, the sound of bone hitting the concrete, the wall caved in. Remy did it again. And one more time for good measure. Then he let go of the body. 

The other man was already begging for his life. 

"No! No! Please!!!"

He cried as he tried to crawl to the door. 

"Who's your alpha?"

He simply asked and the man shook his head. 

Remy repeated the question as he grabbed one of his leg, he casually put his foot on the other knee. He would crush it so hard he would be nothing but a mangled dog when he was done with him. 

"I-I Please..."

"Wrong answer."

He murmured as he stepped on his knee. The sound of bone crushing underneath his boots. The kind of scream that came out of his mouth was unnatural, it was raw. Remy was grateful when he stopped. 

The last man did not beg, he did not tremble and with the look on his face, he would not reveal anything even under the worst of tortures. 

"I'll leave you a message for whoever the fuck your alpha is."

He said as he pulled out a small hunting knife that he always carried in his back pocket, with his bare hand, he ripped the man's shirt away, leaving his bare skin. 

"Hold still."

Remy whispered to him like a lover would as he started carving out the words on his chest. The man bit his lips in pain, he tried to fight Remy off, but his feeble attempts were met with heavy opposition. 

When Remy was finally done, he stood up and went to the room Valentina was in. 

Gently, very gently, he took off her gag and removed her ropes, then he carried her in his arms, Valentina clung to him with her ebbing strength. 

"You came for me."

She muttered. 

Remy nodded. 

"I will always come for you."




###chapter 30 - Goldie Parson. 

"Colin, what do you mean?!"

I asked him as I stared at him. He had pulled me out of the party, right after Karl Schweers had just asked me to dance. I didn't say yes yet, but Karl had been eying me all night and he was pretty easy on the eyes. Any girl would want to dance with Karl. Any girl would, so I should want him to dance with me too, should I not? 

Anyways, instead of that, I am outside with Colin, who has pulled me out of the party despite the harsh chilly weather, to tell me that he wasn't going to attend, to give me news that I had never thought of hearing. We had applied to UCLA together. What did he mean by he got accepted to MIT?

"I'm saying, they have a great technology program."

Colin said soberly. 

"But we agreed we'll go to UCLA. Isn't that what we've always talked about?!"

Colin sighed. 

"No! That's what you have always talked about, I've always told you I'm keeping my options open."

Tears clouded my vision but I quickly blinked them away. I cried way too easily, but I didn't understand what Colin was saying, I didn't understand why he was changing his words now. 

He told me he wanted to go to UCLA with me and now he was making it seem as if I had made the decision for the both of us. 

"You never said that Colin. At least not to me."

"Well now you know. Have fun in UCLA with Karl."

I raised my eyebrows and scoffed. 

"Karl?! Is that what this is all about."

Colin scoffed. 

"Don't pretend you don't know."

Pretend I don't know what? What the fuck was he saying?!

Colin started walking away, I held his arm and pulled him back.

"Come back here Colin Lockwood and tell me exactly what you mean!"

I demanded. 

"Goldie leave me alone!"

Colin protested but I didn't leave him alone. 

He finally sighed. 

"You can't pretend you don't know."

"Know what?"

I snapped, slowly getting impatient. 

"I only said I was going to UCLA because of you, because I wanted to see you. Because I've been in love with you all my life and I thought you'd finally see it one day!"

"All those letters you found in your locker were from me, I was the secret admirer who kept sending them to you but no! You thought they came from stupid Karl Schweers. And I have to admit, after years and years of pining after you, I'm tired Goldie."

"I can't do this anymore! Not in college, not as adults, I'll rather let you go now and save what's left of my stupid heart."

With that, he snatched his hand and walked away. I stood in the school lawn, my mouth opened, I was too stunned to speak, too stunned to move. 

Colin Lockwood was in love with me?!





.................



Valentina's eyes fluttered open. She thought she had been dreaming, but it was only another memory. She looked around, the room was dimly lit, the curtains had been closed to stop the light from filtering in. 

Remy was lying next to her, his amber eyes were looking at her with worry. He looked concerned. She tried to move but pain shot up her entire body so she quickly paused.

"Don't move. It still hurts."

Remy warned. 

She sighed as she struggled to speak, but her throat felt parched. 

"Water?"

Remy asked and she nodded. 

Remy picked up the glass of water on the bedside table, with one hand, he propped Valentina up carefully and put the glass to her lips. She took two mouthfuls. 

He set the cup down and put her back on the bed. 

"Do you need anything else?"

He asked softly and she shook her head. 

"No. I'm fine."

She muttered. 

"You had us all worried."

Remy said as he sighed. 

"I'm sorry."

She muttered, trying to gather her thoughts. 

"Why did you run away?"

Remy asked and she stayed mute. She didn't have an answer for that. She was still stuck in her own head. After the altercation they had left the town, stopping briefly at the hospital before they left to make sure that nothing was broken, Valentina kept slipping in and out of consciousness while muttering jargons. 

Remy had been worried she had broken something but the doctor kept assuring her that medically, everything was fine, so he brought her back home. His mother had been so relieved when he did, the whole pack had been on high alerts ever since she was missing. 

"Never mind that. Do you know the men that kidnapped you?"

Remy asked.

She shook her head. 

"No. I was walking down the alley and they grabbed me. They kept asking me strange questions."

"Like what?"

Remy asked and Valentina shrugged. 

"They kept saying I took something from them. They sounded like they knew me..."

Remy sighed. 

"But you don't remember them right?"

She nodded. 

"Well, luckily you didn't break anything. The healer said after one night of bedrest you'd be fine. So don't worry."

"Thank you for finding me Remy."

She replied softly. Remy looked like there was a lot on his mind that he wanted to say, but he held back. 

"I have some paperwork to do in the study, but you can call me if you need anything."

"My mother was worried sick about you, when you're feeling a little stronger you should stop by her room. Say hello."

Valentina swallowed hard. How the hell was she going to face Ellen after everything she had done?!

"I will."

She answered. 

Remy stroked her head lightly, his fingers large and warm to the touch, she closed her eyes, savouring the sensation. Few seconds later, he walked out of the room. 

Valentina slowly got out of bed. 

She walked to the bathroom. 

In front of the mirror, she stared at her new self. 

She was not Valentina. 

She was Goldie, Goldie Parson and her body had died. 

The woman in front of her was not her. 

There was such a stark difference between the two of them, she thought as she looked closely. She had never imagined that she would be looking at herself through the eyes of someone else's body. Her curly blonde hair that she had struggled with all her life was gone, replaced by pin straight short black hair. Not a single curl in place, no need for her to worry about the hair been frizzy or how long she had to spend styling her hair just so she would get the perfect defined curls. She would never have to use a diffuser again. 

Her green eyes were gone, replaced with baby blue eyes, the stuck out in her sharp features, sharp cheekbones, sharp chin with a pointed nose. She looked older, none of the softness or roundness her old face had. Or the freckles on her cheeks. It was all just smooth pale skin. 

She was slender too, she thought as she slowly took off her shirt. Slender and taller. Her arms were covered with tiny light scars all over. She wondered if the real Valentina used to self harm. 

She was different and she wasn't sure it was a difference she liked. Or would ever like. 

Was this to be her new life? Living as the elusive Valentina Combe who was married to an alpha and had a dark and mysterious that seemed to haunt her?!

Was this her new life?!

She asked herself, tears gathering in her eyes. 

"God..."

She murmured. 

Even her voice was not her own. Everything wasn't hers. 

It was all too much, she thought as she rushed out of the bathroom, putting her shirt back on. 

Her phone was on the bed, she pulled it out and typed in a quick google search. 

*Goldie Parson, Oak Creek.*

Numerous pictures and news articles came up, all of them talking about one thing, the accident. The tragic accident that had killed four young adults. Her chest constricted in pain as she read the news, her eyes skimming over the pages in record breaking speed. 

They all died.

There was one local news site  that had pictures from her funeral. 

She clicked it with shaky hands. 

Her mom, her dad. They were there. 

Their faces solemn, their expression guarded. One could easily see that her mother had been crying. 

A lot. 

She left the site and typed in the family phone number. 

She just had to hear her mother's voice. 

That was all she needed, even if it was going to be for the last time. 

Just one more time. 

The call went through and started ringing, she bit her nails nervously, worried it was going to go to voicemail. 

But someone finally picked up. 

"Hello."

It was her mother. And Goldie almost cried out in relief, but she held herself, covering her mouth with her hand as she tried to control the sob that was threatening to burst through her mouth. 

There was a long silence. 

"Hello?!"

Her mother said again. 

She could not reply. Who would she say she was? How would she introduce herself?!

"Goldie?!"

Her mother asked, with her voice breaking. 

She couldn't bear it anymore, she ended the call.




###chapter 31 - Why are you running?!
Things had changed. Now that she had her memories, she was more confused than ever. 

Was going back home an option?! Could she ever live her life as Goldie Parson again? Would she ever be able to see her parents?  Or even Colin?!

To think that she had met her mother and Colin on two occasions and she didn't recognise them. They didn't recognise her too, they would never believe she was Goldie Parson. In fact, it would come off as an insult if she went to them and told them what happened. 

She wished she could do something about it, because she knew her parents were grieving. And taking her loss pretty badly. She was their only child and her parents loved her a lot. They were a complete little family and now she wondered what was going to become of them without her being there. 

Her father would bury himself in work. He would say he was fine but he would come back home late, drink himself to sleep and keep his feelings to himself. Her mother would not be able to handle his absence, but she would be too consumed in her own guilt to reach out to him. She would keep her room as it was, regularly visiting, she would visit her graveyard often, because she would want to talk to her.

Her parents would never move on from her death and she didn't think that time would make it easy on their relationship either. 

It was a horrible thing. And now that she knew that she was awake, back in another body, it felt like a punishment. 

She would never be able to live the life she knew ever again.



She had dressed up after resting and decided to go downstairs and say hello to Ellen. The poor woman must have been very worried sick about her. And she wanted to let her know that she was fine.

Her bruises were healing very nicely, but she couldn't deny that her body still racked with pain. The painkillers had managed to take the edge off, but they wore off very quickly. Marielle had been confused with the fact that she didn't heal as she should have, claiming that the fact that  she was a werewolf should have been enough to heal her injuries and wounds. 

But now she knew the truth. The wolf didn't respond to her because it wasn't hers to command. She wondered if it had died with the real Valentina, or it just chose to be unresponsive to her commands. Maybe that was the reason that despite the fact that she was a full born werewolf like they had mentioned, her wolf was still nowhere to be found and she felt positively human. 

Ellen was in the garden, a book in her hand, her black hair in a bun atop her head. Even with the book in her hand she was staring at the rose shrubs, till she heard Valentina l's footsteps.

She looked up and smiled widely when she saw Valentina.

"Oh Valentina." She murmured, her voice carried a hint of sadness as she looked upon Valentina's bruised face. She had a black eye and a bruise under her chin that was now  red. 

"Hi Ellen."

She murmured. Slightly embarrassed as Ellen enveloped her into a bone crushing hug.

"Why do you keep running away?!"

She asked and Valentina stayed mute. She would have protested, she would have said something if she didn't have her memories back but now she chose to stay mute. She didn't have a reasonable explanation for running away, at least not anymore. 

"I'm sorry for worrying you."

"I was very very worried. Remy too even though he would never admit it. He didn't sleep, he would take a run in the woods to clear his head several times in a day."

"Oh."

"Yes! He was hesitating at first, but then I found out he had been trying to find you all along, he also got the airport to show camera footage from that day and they saw you leaving the airport alone and unharmed. I think that must have really hurt him."

Ellen's voice carried a lot of emotions and Valentina felt stricken with guilt.

"I know."

She sighed as she sat down on one of the benches. The garden was long and beautiful. The air was filled with the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers and the gentle rustling of leaves. It was a vibrant tapestry of colors, textures, and shapes. 

Valentina wondered why she didn't go there often, it was peaceful and beautiful, almost like a mini sanctuary, besides, it was designed in a way that it looked like it was walled off from the house, giving whoever was in the garden a lot of privacy. 

"Do you?  Do you really know?"

Ellen asked and Valentina stayed quiet.

"You forget yourself Valentina. You forget who you are."

"I don't know who I am."

Valentina answered. It was true, she knew nothing about the real Valentina. Nothing of her past, no bit of information that could help her, in fact, in all honesty, she didn't think anyone actually knew the real Valentina. 

"You lost your memory, I know that but still, you're a werewolf and our world is a dangerous one. Why did you think it was safe for you to go back to the town where you had mysteriously turned up dead?!"

Ellen was right. That should have been a warning for her.

"I don't know what you did in your past or what is chasing you, but I do know my son. And I know that Remy would do anything to protect you. You don't have to  keep running."

That was the thing. She wanted to trust Remy, she wanted to believe that he would protect her and keep her safe, but was he truly honest? Was he being honest with her or was he just using her?

She didn't know if his actions towards her were genuine. And it was confusing, because there were a lot of times where she really wanted to believe that he was being truthful with her, but she couldn't tell.

Everything about him and his union with the real Valentina had been fishy from the start. The fact that they were mates yet they didn't have the love that mates were supposedly supposed to have. The fact that the real Valentina had run away from him before. And the fact that he had told her everything, literally everything he claimed there was to know about werewolves and their world but he never mentioned the ritual to her. 

"Thank you Ellen. I only came to say hello, I must go back to rest."

Valentina said dismissively as she stood up from the bench. 

Ellen stood up too.

"Are you hungry? You haven't really eaten anything. What should the chef make for you?"

She was craving pizza. Pizza with lots of cheese and basil and pepperoni.

"Actually there is one thing I want. I'd kill for a pepperoni pizza right now."

She said and Ellen raised her eyebrows. 

She looked at her in amusement, as if she couldn't quite believe her words.

"You want a pizza?!"

"Yes. I'd really like one."



..


"They're not wolves from any pack. I checked and checked and checked."

Kale said as he stood in front of his alpha. Remy had his head bent over his table, looking at his laptop. 

He rubbed his face in frustration. He didn't find anything of the bastards that attacked Valentina. And the more time he spent trying to find them, the harder it git, it infuriated him. 

"That's weird.  Rogue wolves?! What would they want with her??"

Kale shrugged.

"Perhaps it has to do with something from her past? There's a lot we don't know about her."

He answered and Remy nodded.

Well he was right. There was a lot they didn't know about Valentina.

"She said they were asking for something. I want her to get enough rest before asking her more questions. But those guys they bother me."

"How?! If they're truly rogue wolves, then they're a useless bunch. We can take them."

His beta sounded confident. 

"Oh that's not my problem with them. I just want to know what they wanted from her. I mean what would she ever have to do with wolves like that anyways?"

"They were very brutal. Very aggressive and they didn't even care enough not to hit a defenseless lady. That says a lot about who they are."

Kale nodded in agreement.

"They're not any better than trash alleycats."

"You said you managed to grab an ID off of one of them right?"

Remy nodded. He reached out to his table and pulled up a driver's license from the table. 

It was one of the men that were in the house, he had been lucky to find an ID on one of them. 

Now he just she to figure out who the hell Timothy Grass was. 

And what he wanted with Valentina. 

"And Valentina? How is she?"

Kale asked and Remy smiled.

"She's recovering pretty fast. That reminds me, she wants some pizza,  you have to send someone to pick some up."

Kale frowned slightly.

"It still baffles me. Why didn't she heal on her own?"

"The memory loss?"

Remy provided an answer, even though he wasn't entirely sure of it The question had been bothering him too but he didn't want to dwell on it at all.

"I doubt it's that she's full of many mysteries isn't she?"

Remy smiled as he touched his chin.

"She sure is."


###chapter 32 - Do you like me? 

Valentina was still on the path of recovery, ventured outside the mansion for a peaceful walk around the property. As much as she liked resting and laying in bed, she decided that walking around work do her some good. 

As she strolled, her eyes fell upon Marielle, engaged in a sparring session with another member of the pack, she didn't remember the name of the person but he was tall. And he was twice the height of Marielle and bigger than her. But Marielle was nimble and swift. 

Valentina marveled at Marielle's prowess, her movements were fluid and harmonious. She moved as if she was dancing and even while fighting, she looked graceful while doing it. 

Valentina felt slightly jealous that she couldn't do that. That would have come in handy while those men had captured her, she thought with a frown on her face. 

The fight concluded with Marielle's victory, and Valentina's applause caught her attention. Marielle glanced at her and that was all. She didn't spare her another look, but Valentina wasn't going to give up so easily. 

Impressed by Marielle's skill, Valentina approached her, their eyes meeting. "That was amazing," Valentina remarked.

Marielle's gaze held a hint of concern. "Are you fully healed now?" she inquired.

Valentina shook her head. She was still sore, patchy and purple in some places. 

"Not entirely. But I couldn't stay indoors any longer."

A distant look crossed Marielle's face. Valentina shamelessly continued, deciding to ignore it. "You fight so well. Maybe you can teach me some moves. I think it will come in handy next time."

Marielle's response was blunt. "Why would I be teaching you anything?!"

Valentina sighed, finally deciding to address the elephant in the room. 

"Is there something wrong? I'm getting the feeling that you don't want me here." 

Marielle raised her eyebrow. 

"Wrong. I just don't like you."

Taken aback, Valentina hesitated before murmuring, "If it's because  of what just happened... I apologise. I was just looking for answers for my lost memories."


Marielle's eyes remained unyielding. "That's no excuse. You can be very reckless and selfish, always putting yourself in harm's way without caring about how others feel."

Valentina sighed softly. "I'm sorry... I'm sorry if I offended you in any way." 

Marielle's voice remained firm. "Oh you know very well I'm not the one you should be apologising to..."

"I know. I will. We haven't gotten around to talking, but we will..."
She trailed off as she thought about talking and apologising to Remy.

Valentina looked at Marielle. Marielle was a strong werewolf, she knew how to defend herself and she would have managed to save herself in that kind of situation. She wanted to learn how to fight too. 

"I want to learn to defend myself," Valentina finally confessed. "I want you to teach me."

Marielle's hesitation was evident. "I might not be the best teacher... Because believe me I don't have the kind of patience that it would require to be a tutor."

Valentina's determination showed in her eyes. "I'm willing to learn. Please."

Marielle considered her request, then sighed. "Fine. Come back when you're feeling better."

"Then we'll be able to talk about it. 


..........

Ellen treated Valentina to pizza. Two large pepperoni pizzas. Valentina was stuffed after she finished with it. Ellen was a nice woman, she felt bad for hurting her especially the way she did, but she  wouldn't be able to understand, she was not the real Valentina. 

Now that she knew who she truly was, she had to find a way to leave again, for good this time. 

She thought about seeing her parents and talking to them. She also thought about seeing Colin and her grandmother. She could imagine how they would all feel. Would they even believe her?! 

She was in another body. He real body was buried six feet's under and most likely rotting. Oh God 

There was no absolute way she could come back to life was there?! She would be stuck as Valentina forever. 

She thought she sighed. It was hopeless! 

Completely hopeless.


The door to the room opened and it pulled her out of her thoughts. Remy walked in, he didn't even spare her a glance as he walked towards the closet. They had not really had a chance to talk. 

There was also a bag in his hand. 

She followed him, calling after him softly.

"Remy? Can we talk?"

"Maybe later. I have to pack."

He answered. She looked around and saw that he was throwing clothes inside a bag. Pack? Was he going on a trip? 

"Where are you going?"

She asked and he shrugged. 

"I figured I'd sleep in another room for the next few nights."

"Remy, wait. Please, let's talk about things.."

He finally turned to look at her. "Valentina, I don't know if there's much left to say."

"If this is about you leaving then you don't have to explain yourself. In fact, when you've recovered you're free to leave. You can go right now."

She was stunned as she heard him speak. He was letting her go? 

Willingly? 

He must be really mad at her then. 

"I only left because I wanted to find out the truth about who I was. That town was the only town that could give me answers. That's why I left..."


"Answers?! And you couldn't talk to me about it like a normal sensible adult?!"

"Maybe I'm the foolish one Valentina, after that night in Alaska, watching the northern lights with you, I thought something had changed between us...." 

His voice was softer now, she could see that he had truly been really hurt by her. 

"Remy, I can't deny that it was a special moment. But there's so much I don't understand about myself. I couldn't just ignore all of that..."

"And look where that got you?! You only ended up putting yourself in danger didn't you?! And once I again I had to come in and save you."

"When will you learn Valentina?"

"Your past is as complicated enough as it already is! Don't go searching for answers alone!"

But it's not my past! She wanted to scream. It was Valentina's past. She was Goldie! Goldie Parson and she had been roped into this weird mysterious woman's life and now she didn't know if she would ever get out of it!

She didn't want to leave the rest of her life as Valentina, who knows how many enemies the woman had running after her. 

"If you want to leave, tell me about it. You're not a prisoner here, I will not keep you here against your will. You've made it quite clear that you do not care about me or the mating bond between us."

"Remy. No. It's not... it's not like that..."

She murmured as she rubbed at her eyes. How could she explain to him? How could she tell him?! 

She wasn't even Valentina, but if she tried to explain that she was someone else he would never believe her, he would just think she was lying. 

"Can I ask a question?"

She asked and he nodded. 

"You've mentioned that you didn't marry me for love. And when I was talking to that healer that you brought, he told you about your pack's history with Lunas."

"Remy I want you to be honest with me, do you care about the mating bond between us or there is another reason why you're keeping me around?"

Remy was silent, for what seemed to be longest period of time. Then he finally sighed. 

"I didn't know John told you about the story...  but then again, it's John, I should have expected that from him."

"But you're right. There is another reason I'm keeping you around." 

"What is it then? Wouldn't you tell me?"

I asked and Remy nodded. 

"I would... come, let's sit down for a moment." 

They moved to the bed. 

"The Lunathion is a ritual between the Luna and the alpha in a pack. It is an ancient ritual that is meant to channel power back into the pack. We've been missing out on that ritual for years now and a lot of other packs perceive that we are weak because of it."

"Ohhh... and it's important?!"

Remy nodded. 

"It is. We haven't had one in a really long time, so you can imagine how it is... when I met you and found out that you were my mate, I couldn't help but think that it would finally be possible."

"That we will finally be able to have the lunathion ritual."
###chapter 33 - I will live as Valentina

She would live as Valentina Combe, until she was able to figure out the truth of everything, maybe it could also help her understand why she was in Valentina's body in the first place. But she would secretly still be Goldie, Goldie Parson, that was who she truly was, that was who she wanted to be and she wanted to go back home. One way or the other. Goldie thought as she watched Remy talk about the Lunathion ritual. 

She couldn't deny that there was something between them that night in Alaska, she also couldn't deny the fact that every single time she was in trouble he was the one who showed go to save her, nobody else came, just him. She had to be more smart and tactical in her approach, if she wanted answers, she had to befriend Remy first. They needed to be on good terms. She didn't blame him for only being with Valentina because of the Lunathion ritual, from the looks of things Valentina had kept a lot of secrets from him too. 

In the soft glow of the bedroom's dimmed lights, they sat on opposite sides of the bed, their expressions a mix of uncertainty and curiosity. 

Goldie, her eyes filled with determination, took a deep breath before breaking the silence. "Remy," she began, her voice wavering slightly, "I've been doing some thinking lately, and I've realized that maybe I've been running away from something that I shouldn't be."

Remy looked at her, his brows furrowing in confusion. "What do you mean, Valentina?"

She sighed, her fingers nervously tracing patterns on the bedspread. "I mean, all this time I've been so focused on remembering my memories, of learning about my past, I suppose in a way it was me avoiding getting close to you, thinking it would be better for both of us because I couldn't wrap my head around the idea of it all..."

"...But the hard truth is, I have nowhere else to go, no one to turn to except for you and I'm tired of putting myself in danger out there."

Remy studied her for a moment, his own emotions flickering across his face. He had known Valentina for a while now, and he didn't think he had ever heard her speak so deeply, or truthfully. "Valentina," he said gently, "you don't have to go through this alone, I told you I would help you recover your memories and do everything in my power to.  You don't have to do everything alone."

Goldie's eyes welled up with tears, and she nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. "Thank you, Remy."

Remy leaned closer to her, and he wiped away a tear with the back of his hand. "You don't have to apologize for running away," he said softly. "I think now, I finally understand why you did it. But I'm even more glad you're willing to stay now."

Goldie managed a small smile, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders. "I just need some time to figure things out, you know? Recover my memories, find out who those people who kidnapped me were, what they wanted. 

Remy nodded, his gaze unwavering. "I'm working on that... I have also been trying to find out who they were and what they want... I'm sure in time we will find some answers."

As they sat in the quiet room, the tension between them dissipated, replaced by a sense of companionship and understanding. Goldie knew she had made the right decision talking to Remy. She felt relieved that he had listened to her and wished she didn't have to lie to him about some things. She had recovered her memories, but they were not Valentina's so unfortunately they would be of no use to him. 

As sad as it sounded, there was no way around it. Would he even believe her if she told him she wasn't Valentina?! 

He would just think she was lying to him. Or it was another one of her methods to try and run away from him. 

He wouldn't believe her. 

She sighed. 

"Being an alpha... it seems like a lot of stress."

She said. 

She didn't know werewolves or supernaturals existed when she was herself. She didn't even suspect that it did. But now, learning all about it and navigating through it felt like she was plunged into another world. A world of magic, mischief and secrecy. 

"I've been an alpha for years now. I took over from my father a long time ago.." 

Goldie looked at him with curiosity. "What was it like?"

Remy's eyes held a distant look as he reminisced. "It was a very challenging time and being from this pack didn't make it any easier. Being a young alpha came with responsibilities and expectations, and I made my fair share of mistakes. But it also taught me the importance of leadership, loyalty, and protecting those I cared about."

Goldie listened intently, intrigued by this glimpse into Remy's past. "It sounds like you've come a long way since then."

Remy smiled softly. "I like to think so. Life has a way of teaching you lessons, and I've learned from my experiences. Now, I'm here, and you're here too. My main focus is making sure you're safe and supported."

Goldie felt a strange warmth in her heart. And all he had done since she had met him was do just that, make sure she was safe and protected. 

.......

Marielle wasn't called the Spymaster of the Silverback Pride pack for nothing. She had always been a vigilant observer. Her instincts rarely led her astray, and ever since she had met Valentina, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss with Valentina, her Alpha's Luna and mate. Late evening, a few hours after Valentina had approached her for training lessons, she stumbled upon a trove of new information about Valentina that sent shivers down her spine.

With a furrowed brow and trembling fingers, Marielle sifted through the digital trail she had stumbled upon. There, in the dim glow of her computer screen, she found a cryptic message from someone in New Orleans who claimed to know the late Valentina Combe. The message hinted at dark secrets and a past Valentina had never shared with anyone, not even Remy, her mate.

Marielle's heart raced as she considered the implications of this newfound revelation. She couldn't ignore her suspicions any longer; she had to let Remy know about it. But first, she would inform Kale. Kale would let her know what the next line of action was. 

As they sat in the library, Marielle leaned in, her voice low and filled with concern. "Kale, I've come across something about Valentina, something I've never seen before, which is quite strange since I've been looking for information on her for months now and I usually come up with nothing."

"It's from someone who claims to know her from New Orleans, someone who suggests she has been doing business with her for a while now, I don't know what kind of business but it definitely sounds shady." 

Kale's eyes widened, mirroring Marielle's apprehension. "What did you find, Marielle? Are you sure it's credible?"

Marielle nodded solemnly. "I've done my best to verify it. But before I do anything, I need your advice. Should I tell Remy about this? This could be the key to us finding out who Valentina truly is." 

Kale, always the voice of reason, took a moment to think before responding. "Marielle, if this is as serious as it seems, we can't rush into anything. We owe it to Valentina and Remy to find out the truth first."

"Confronting Valentina without solid evidence could do more harm than good."

Marielle nodded in agreement, appreciating Kale's wisdom. "You're right. I'll dig deeper, try to contact the person from New Orleans and gather more information. We need to be sure before we say anything to Remy."

Kale placed a reassuring hand on Marielle's shoulder. "We'll handle this together, Marielle. She's our alpha's Luna and as much as it pains me to admit it, we need her, so we have to make sure this person has something sensible to tell us in the first place."
###chapter 34 - She lives on


Colin had made up his mind to leave Oaks Creek town. He believed it was for the best, he had stayed too long and now the past hung heavily on him. He had come because of Goldie's funeral and he had stayed longer than he anticipated that he would. Too long. Way too long, he thought as he packed his belongings. 

The weight of his decision hung heavy in his heart as he packed his belongings into his old, battered suitcase.

As he walked down the quiet streets, lost in thought, he never expected to run into anyone, let alone Goldie's grandmother, whom Goldie  fondly called Nana. He was shocked to see her. Nana stayed in a nursing home, why was she walking around the streets?!  Nana was known for her gentle demeanor and wise words, but today, she appeared disheveled and out of sorts. She was wearing what appeared to be pajamas and a hooded jacket , her long gray hair scattered around her head. There was a pair of slippers on her feet. 

"Nana?! Nana what are you doing here?!" 

He asked in shock as he looked around, the nursing home was only a few blocks away, he could take her back safely without any hassle. 

"Lockwood?! Is that the Lockwood boy?!"

She asked and he nodded. 

"Yes. It's me. Colin Lockwood." 

"Colin, dear," Nana croaked, clutching his arm as if her frail grip was the only thing keeping her upright. "I remember you. I saw you not long ago."

Colin nodded as he swallowed hard. 

"Yes. At Goldie's funeral." 

Nana looked up at him with narrowed eyes. 

"Goldie's not dead."

She said strongly. 

Colin decided it was best to play along, not wanting to upset the old woman.

"Yes. You're right." 

She paused for a while and searched his face to see if he really believed his words. 

"So you know! You know the truth!"

Colin nodded, fighting the tears from dropping. 

"But do you know where Goldie could be?" She asked and Colin shook his head. 

"No I don't. Do you?!"

Nana shrugged.  

"She's always had a wandering soul. She couldn't really control it." 

Colin furrowed his brows, taken aback by Nana's words. Goldie was dead. Nana's words sounded like the ramblings of an elderly woman suffering from dementia. He shouldn't encourage this, no not anymore. 

"Well... Nana she's been gone for a long time now... I doubt she'll ever be back," Colin replied gently, trying to ease Nana's agitation.

Nana's eyes widened, and she gripped his arm even tighter. "No, no, dear, you don't understand. Goldie's still out there, wandering, lost in the world. Her soul is looking for her body."

"She has always been special, it wasn't her time, she wasn't going to die that way. Goldie is fine! We just have to gently guide her back home."

"I could use your help too, you cannot leave yet. The two of you have always been very close... she must miss you in some way."

Colin didn't know what to make of Nana's bizarre claims, but he didn't want to upset Nana further. She was clearly in distress. He nodded solemnly, pretending to believe her.

"Alright, Nana, I won't leave. I promise I'll help you find Goldie," he said, hoping to ease her anxiety.

Nana's frail face broke into a relieved smile, and she patted his hand. "Thank you, Colin, bless your heart. We must find her before it's too late."

With Nana's shaky guidance, Colin escorted her back to the nursing home. As they walked, Nana spoke of Goldie's favorite places and the memories they had shared. Colin couldn't help but wonder if there was a glimmer of truth in Nana's words. Maybe, just maybe, Goldie was still out there, lost and searching for them just as they were missing her. 


.........

Lily Parson had been in Goldie's room when she heard the phone call. It was from Colin, apparently Nana had left the nursing home. She had walked out and was talking gibberish again. She was exhausted. 

Lily's heart raced as she rushed through the sliding glass doors of the nursing home, her footsteps echoing in the sterile hallway. Nana had taken the news of Goldie's death really badly, in fact, she blatantly refused to believe it. She claimed Goldie was still alive and not dead. She had endured her mother's ramblings the first time it had happened, they were all dealing with the grief in their own way, and it was hard on all of them but Nana seemed to still be in denial about Goldie's death. 

Colin was waiting near the entrance, his face etched with concern and exhaustion. Lily approached him, her eyes filled with a mix of gratitude and regret. "Colin, I'm sorry for the trouble," she began, her voice trembling. "Thank you for bringing her back here."

Colin nodded, his gaze heavy with the weight of the situation. "It's the least I could do, Mrs Parson. Nana also asked for you, and I thought it would be better for her to see a familiar face." 

Together, they walked down the corridor, reaching Nana's room. The frail woman lay in her bed, her eyes bright with recognition as she saw her daughter Lily. "Lily, dear, you've come!" Nana exclaimed, her voice quivering with joy.

Lily forced a smile, leaning over to hug the old woman gently. "Of course, Nana. I'm here for you."

As they settled into the room, Nana's conversation took a surprising turn. "You know, Lily," she said with a knowing glint in her eye, "I told Colin about Goldie. He believes me. He's going to help."

"Goldie is still out there. We have to find a way to save her."

Lily's heart sank, and she felt a knot tighten in her chest. She had been trying to bury the pain of losing her daughter deep within herself, and Nana's words threatened to unearth it all. It was really hard dealing with someone like her mother. 

"Nana, please," she whispered, tears welling up in her eyes. "Goldie... she's gone. You mustn't say such things."

Nana's eyes, though clouded with age, were filled with an unshakable conviction. "No, Lily, I know better than you when it comes to these things. That's why I vehemently opposed the burial. Time is running out, we need to find Goldie's soul wherever she wandered to." 

Lily couldn't bear it any longer. Her emotions boiled over, and she screamed at Nana, "Stop it, mother! Goldie is dead! You're just tormenting me with all of your silly delusions!"

Colin, caught in the middle of this heart-wrenching confrontation, rose from his chair, his eyes filled with sadness. He couldn't bear to see Mrs Parson and Nana in such pain, it was horrible, watching how they were all differently affected by her death. "I think I should go," he muttered, his voice barely audible.

Lily, her anger subsiding into a flood of tears, turned to him, her voice filled with remorse. "Colin, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to..."

He shook his head, offering a weak smile. "It's okay, Mrs Parson. We're all hurting in our own ways." 

With that, Colin left the room, leaving behind a mother and grandmother, both wounded by their grief. Lily held Nana's trembling hand, unable to shake the haunting feeling that perhaps, in Nana's world, Goldie lived on.
###chapter 35 - Madame Eloise

Goldie found herself in front of Valentina's art room. She hasn't been there in a while and she knew that it must have surprised everyone in the house that she was finally going back to check on it again, since it had looked so unfamiliar to her after she lost her memories. The art room stood like a forgotten relic, an air of melancholy hanging over it with several cobwebs and dust. 

Determined to find answers, Goldie cautiously entered the room. This room had answers, or at least it should have. If Valentina spent most of her time here, then there must be something her that can shed more light as to who she was as a person. Or what she did or who she knew. 

As she stepped into the room, she was once again reminded why she hated coming in. Valentina's drawings were gruesome to say the least. A truly disturbed mind and soul. The things she drew or thought about, Goldie didn't think it was normal to draw or even think about such things. 

Goldie knew she couldn't waste any time. She began searching through the drawers and the small shelves, looking for any clues that might reveal what had led to Valentina's untimely 'demise' that brought her to the morgue in the first place. Her death was the most unexplained part about her. No one knew why she died, or how she died or if she had been sick or anything. The doctor couldn't even give an explanation. And if Goldie was currently inhabiting Valentina's body, did that make Valentina dead dead?! Or was her soul somewhere still in her lurking somewhere?! 

Questions questions. 

She had so many burning questions. 

And not one answer to them. 

What could it be about?! 

The room was a treasure trove of art supplies, but Goldie's focus was on finding answers.

Amidst the canvases and brushes, she stumbled upon a small, weathered journal. Its pages were yellowed with age, and its leather cover was worn. Gingerly, Goldie opened it and started to read Valentina's handwritten notes.

The journal contained a cryptic collection of names and numbers, locations, written in a hurried, almost frantic script. It was as if Valentina had been documenting something, but the meaning remained elusive. What was she documenting?! What were the names ?! 
Goldie couldn't decipher the purpose of these entries, but she was certain they held a key to understanding Valentina's secrets.

With trembling hands, she carefully tucked the journal into the pocket of her jacket, determined to unravel the mystery it held.

.......

It was afternoon, Remy received a call that disrupted his peaceful routine. He had thought he would spend the day training in the gym, but he got a call from a partner in Malibu who wanted to buy a house. An important meeting in the bustling city required his immediate attention. Goldie was in the room, and she  watched as Remy dressed in his sharp suit, his face a mixture of excitement and worry.

"Where are you going?"

She asked hopefully. 

"Malibu." 

Remy replied as he started packing a suitcase. 

She rose from the bed. All she could think about was the fact that she would see the beach. She wanted to see the beach. She could use a break. 

"Can I come?"

"I don't think you'll enjoy it very much. It's a boring ass meeting."

"I don't mind. I just need to get out of here for a while."

Remy gave her a pointed look. 

"I have a beach house in Malibu. If you promise to stay there and not cause any trouble while I conduct business in the city, then you can come with me."

Goldie jumped up happily. 

"I promise."

With that settled, they set off in Remy's car, the wind in their faces as they cruised down the winding coastal road. The city's skyscrapers loomed in the distance, a stark contrast to the tall long trees that she was used to seeing everyday in Remy's mansion. Eventually, they arrived at a charming beach house nestled by the shore.

Remy parked the car and Goldie ran out onto the sandy beach, her bag in her hand. She looked at the beach house from afar and smiled back at Remy.

"The beach house has everything you need. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Please don't do anything stupid Valentina." 

 Goldie nodded.

"I won't!"

"Thank you!"

"I'll call you every hour to check up on you."

He said as he pulled out his phone. 

Goldie nodded, barely listening to him and just looking out at sea.

She finally turned back and waved to him. 

As Remy drove away, Goldie explored her surroundings. The beach house was surrounded by lush gardens and overlooked the sparkling sea. She walked around the sandy shore, picking up sea shells she would find every now and then. 

Soon, she encountered Dalia, a friendly golden retriever who seemed to have wandered from the other side of the beach. She saw the name of the dog on her collar while she petted her. 

"Hey Dalia!" 

Dalia greeted Goldie with a wagging tail and a playful bark. 

They quickly became fast friends, running along the shore, chasing seagulls, and splashing in the gentle waves.

As the day unfolded, Goldie and the dog  Dalia frolicked in the sun, enjoying each other's company. They rolled in the sand, Goldie wished she had treats to give the dog but she didn't have anything suitable. The dog had truly been a blessing. She had forgotten all about her worries as she reveled in the unexpected day at the beach house.

When the sun began its descent, a woman who she perceived to be Dalia's owner returned to pick her up. She reluctantly said her goodbyes to Dalia, promising to visit again soon.  The woman was thankful that Goldie had keeper her dog company, but what she didn't know that it was the dog that had kept her company. 



.......

Determined to uncover the truth, Marielle tracked down the witch who had mysteriously left her with a vague message that she knew Valentina Combe. The witch, whose name was Madame Eloise Grant was apparently a well known witch in New Orleans. She claimed to be a direct descendant of the early Salem witches and she publicly claimed that she was a witch. While humans might have not taken such a woman too seriously, Marielle knew that she was revered and considered powerful in the supernatural world. She had heard tales of her mystical powers and her deep connection to the hidden realms of magic. After much persistence and searching, Marielle finally secured an important phone call with Madame Eloise.

The witch's voice was as enchanting as the tales that surrounded her. "And who are you?!"

"Marielle Mason. You may not know me, but I have heard about you. And I need something from you."

"What is it you seek, child?" she inquired, her words a delicate dance of secrets.

Marielle, not one to beat around the bush, went straight to the heart of the matter. "Madame Eloise, I saw your message, even though you didn't leave me a name to find you. You said you know about a woman named Valentina Combe." 

There was a short silence. The witch didn't speak, but Marielle continued.

"You said she came to you for something quite unusual and that you knew of her in a way. Can you elaborate on that? What did she come for?"

There was a pregnant pause on the other end of the line, and then Madame Eloise asked very slowly. "Do you know her? Do you know Valentina Combe." 

Marielle knew the woman was unwilling to tell her what she wanted. She would have to be more straightforward then. 

"I do. From the message you sent, you were trying to contact Valentina Combe, well I won't tell you much, but I will tell you that I have direct access to Valentina Combe." 

Madame Eloise quickly answered. 

"I don't give out information of my clients so easily. If I did, it would make me very untrustworthy. But of course, if I get a little incentive, I might reconsider." 

So Valentina was Madame Eloise's client?! But for what?! 

Marielle knew it would come down to money.

"Name your price Madame Eloise. I will have my boss wire you enough money for you to reconsider." 

"You have my word." 

She added and Madame Eloise scoffed. 

"What good is your word?! Humans break their promises all the time." 

Marielle scoffed.

"I'm not human Madame Eloise. Neither was Valentina Combe. I'm sure you already know that already if you were in contact with her." 

Another silence, Marielle grew impatient. Madame Eloise asked. 

"And what pack are you from? Marielle Mason?"

"The Silverback pride of Alpha Remington Albrecht. You may have heard of us." 

"Ahhhh! The pack forever cursed to be without a luna?!"

Marielle winced. Well, at least she knew who they were. 

"Very well. Valentina Combe came to me for a concealment spell, one that could hide the true location and identity of someone or something  for years."

Marielle's curiosity grew with each word. "A concealment spell? But why would she need something like that?"

Madame Eloise's voice became stern, and Marielle could feel the weight of her words. "That, my dear, is another secret worth its weight in gold. I'm afraid even money cannot make me divulge that to you."

Marielle hesitated, but her desire for the truth overpowered her reservations. "Very well, how long ago was this?!"

"It's been going for a year now. She renews the spell every month to make it stronger."

"Really?! is the spell still active?"

"Yes," Madame Eloise replied simply, sending shivers down Marielle's spine. "I've been paid every month to ensure its longevity. Although, two months ago she gave me a three month advance for the spell. We haven't had any contact since then and I'm afraid if she doesn't pay up after the next month I might have to discontinue the spell." 

Two months ago. That was before Valentina lost her memories, that was before whatever accident she had that landed her in the hospital. 

Had Valentina know that such would happen to her?! 

Did she orchestrate all this?!
###chapter 36 - Believers of the Faith 

The sun was beginning its descent beyond the horizon as Remy returned from his business meeting. Goldie had been waiting on the beach, the gentle breeze tousling her short black hair as she gazed out at the waves rolling in. As Remy approached, she turned, her face lighting up with a smile that could rival the sun itself. She was wearing nothing but shorts and a long white shirt and a bikini underneath. Remy had taken off his suit jacket, his white shirt was rolled up all the way to his elbows. 

"Hey, you," she greeted as she waved at him. Though they were now friendly with each other, she wasn't sure a hug would have been appropriate. She didn't want things between them to be awkward. A lot had been going on between them lately. 

A lot of things. 

"Hey, Valentina," Remy replied. He dropped his suitcase on the sand. "Sorry I'm late. The meeting ran longer than I expected."

Goldie shook her head. "No worries. I've been enjoying the view."

"I had to close a deal on some property that I owned. I thought I'd finish things a lot sooner, but apparently I didn't...." 

They walked hand in hand along the shoreline, the wet sand cool beneath their feet. Seagulls soared overhead, and the rhythmic sound of the waves provided a soothing backdrop.

"Wow. I thought you were kidding when you said you were into real estate."

She chuckled and Remy gave her a pointed look. 

"It's the family business." 

As they strolled, Goldie asked, "And if you weren't in the family business or an alpha what do you think you'd be?"

Remy chuckled, his amber eyes reflecting the playful glint in Goldie's own. "Hmm, that's a tough one. I've never really thought about it. Maybe a mechanic?"

Goldie burst into laughter, playfully swatting his arm. "A mechanic? Seriously?"

Remy grinned. "Well, yeah. I've always loved fixing cars. There's something satisfying about making something broken run smoothly again."

Goldie shook her head, still laughing. "You, the big, strong alpha, under a car, covered in grease? I'd love to see that."

Remy feigned offense, "Hey now, there's more to me than just being an alpha, you know."

Their playful banter was interrupted by the sound of the crashing waves. Goldie grabbed Remy's hand and dragged him closer to the water's edge. "Prove it!" she challenged before, with a mischievous glint in her eye, she playfully shoved him into the water.

Remy splashed into the shallows, his clothes instantly drenched. He sputtered and laughed as he stood up, water dripping from his hair and clothes, even in that moment, he looked very handsome, Goldie thought as she tried not to look too hard at the outlines of his body underneath his wet clothes. "Okay, you got me," he admitted, shaking his head to send a spray of water droplets in Goldie's direction.

She giggled, her heart pounding as they locked eyes. In that moment, with the fading sun casting an orange and pink glow over the ocean, it felt like time had slowed. The world around them faded away, and it seemed as though they might finally share that another kiss. 

But then, as if on cue, a massive wave crashed onto the shore, drenching them both and shattering the tender moment. They broke into laughter again, the salty taste of the sea on their lips.

As they stood there, drenched and grinning, Remy leaned in close to Goldie, with his height and build, he towered over her, almost blocking the sunset view from her line of sight, his voice was barely above a whisper. "Maybe being an alpha isn't the only thing I'm good at."

Goldie's heart fluttered as their lips drew nearer, but before they could kiss, another wave surged forward, playfully teasing them once more.

......

Goldie and Remy had spent the entire day basking in the warm sun and playing along the shoreline, their laughter carried away by the ocean breeze. As the evening sun dipped below the horizon, casting a fiery glow across the beach, they decided it was time to retire to their cozy beach house.

Inside, the salty scent of the sea lingered in the air, Goldie settled in the comfortable bed while Remy stayed outside  to receive a call. The night seemed peaceful and she was very tired, she couldn't wait to go to bed, but as Goldie's dreams took hold, tranquility was shattered.

In the depths of her slumber, Goldie found herself in a nightmarish dream. Valentina  appeared before her, her eyes filled with an ominous glow. Her clothes were black and tattered and the skin beneath it looked moon white. She whispered chillingly, "Your time is running out."

Terror gripped Goldie, and she screamed, "Leave me alone!" 

"Leave you alone?! You're in my body!" 

The apparition of Valentina screamed as she ran after her. 

Goldie's body grew hot, and she thrashed in bed, trapped in the grip of her nightmare.

Remy was jolted awake by Valentina's cries, concern etching on his face. He called out to her, "Valentina! Valentina! Wake up!" But she was trapped within her nightmare, unable to hear him

Desperation mounting, Remy knew he had to act quickly, her body was burning hot, he shook her but she wouldn't wake up. He leaped out of bed and, with great urgency and effortless ease, carried her into his arms and rushed outside toward the moonlit shore. The cool, soothing embrace of the ocean awaited them. He hoped the saltwater would break the nightmare's hold on her.

As they reached the water's edge, Goldie's screams persisted, her body trembling with fear. Remy, undeterred, gently out her into the water, he submerged her briefly once, hoping the need for air would break her out of her nightmare.  He did it again, whispering her name with each attempt, "Valentina... Valentina, it's me, Remy. Wake up!"

Slowly, the icy water began to penetrate Goldie's consciousness. Her screams softened, replaced by ragged breaths. She blinked, disoriented, and finally met Remy's worried gaze.

"Remy?" she stammered, her voice quivering.

"Yes, Valentina, it's me. You're safe now," he assured her, wrapping his arms around her trembling form.

Together, they stood by the water's edge, the gentle waves lapping at their feet, until Goldie's breathing returned to normal, until her temperature dropped and her heart stopped racing. The danger had passed, and the nightmare was left behind in the dark waters of the night.

As the first light of dawn painted the horizon, Goldie and Remy returned to their beach house to pack their things. 

It was time to go back home. 

.......

Isabel Fleming had snuck out of her nursing home again. The nursing home would be confused, since they had placed her under strict care, but Isabel had her ways. She had to do something, every day that passed was a day that Goldie was not back in a body. She needed to save her granddaughter. 

Outside of the nursing home, Greg Colby, her sister's husband, a believer of the faith was already waiting for her across the street in his car and her younger sister Camilla. Her younger sister just arrived in town after she had told her the news and the urgency of it. 

She had woken up a few nights ago from a vivid dream about Goldie, her granddaughter. And it gave her all the confirmation that she needed that Goldie's soul was somewhere and she was truly not dead. 

Nana whispered as she got into Greg's car. "Thank you, Greg, for helping us with this." 

Greg smiled. 

"We heard the situation and knew we had to step in." 

Camilla nodded. 

"I can't imagine how you're feeling Isabel. I can't bear the thought of Goldie's soul just wandering aimlessly."

Camilla held her sister's hand. They were ten years apart, but age had been kinder on Camilla. And while her seventy-six year old sister Isabel looked her age, sixty-six year old Camilla and her husband looked like they were just approaching fifty. Being childless seemed to have been a huge advantage in that part. 

"We understand, Isabel. We'll do our best to help."

"I've been having the same dream ever since that night. And it feels like in a way Goldie is trying to tell me something..." 

Nana looked at Camilla with desperation 

"But I've seen her, Camilla, I've felt her presence. She's not at peace. We must find her a temporary host body and bring her back."

Camilla nodded. "We can't just ask anybody. This is a delicate matter, but I believe if we go back and tell the society, they might be able to find us a host body if we plead our case." 

Nana's eyes filled with gratitude as they pressed on into the night. The car driving round the small town. 

"And the bells. We must get the bells for the ritual to bring her back. Greg, can you promise you'll find the bells needed for the ceremony?"

"I will drop a formal request, but you know how the society is with these things. I can't promise, but I'll try my best. It won't be easy for them to release those ancient bells."

Camilla turned to her sister, their hands still intertwined. 

"And your daughter?! How is she taking it?"

Isabel sighed. 

"Lily isn't a believer of the faith. I tried to talk to her. But she wouldn't listen to me. It's up to me now to find a way to save my granddaughter." 

"Not just you. You have us."

Camilla said reassuringly. There was a smile on her gentle face. Greg nodded too. 

And Isabel felt at ease. More at ease than she had ever felt in a while.
###chapter 37 - Bad news

After their adventurous day at the beach, they were finally back home, safe and sound. Goldie was feeling much better and she was already back to her usual self, thanks to Remy. She had regained all strength and consciousness the moment they left the beach house and went on the long ride home. And  Goldie couldn't deny that while she had wanted to leave the house, she missed it while she was away. So when they arrived at the front gates with the tall familiar trees and brooding forest, it strangely felt like home.

And she felt even more at ease than ever. Ellen had been fussy as usual, she had begged Remy not to mention the nightmare incident so he wouldn't worry her and she was thankful that he had kept it to himself. He didn't mention it to her. Ellen was just happy that they were back home as she hurried and made dinner plans. 

Goldie went upstairs to take a shower and change into comfortable clothes, on her way back downstairs he overheard a heated conversation coming from Remy's study. Curiosity piqued, she quietly crept to the door, her ears tuned in to the voices.

"You can't expect me to wait forever!" Remy's voice was firm, filled with determination.

The other person's voice was deep and stern, she had a feeling he must be an alpha. "Alpha Remington, you're asking for far more than you're owed. We've already made concessions, and you know your pack's situation."

Goldie's heart ached for Remy as she listened to the tense exchange. She knew that Remy had been trying to get back the mantle ever since their trip to Alaska. He just wanted to make sure that the seat of power reached their pack, but their opinions and reservations about his pack prevented them from acting objectively or fairly. 

After the call ended, Remy came out of the study, his face etched with worry. He looked up and saw her watching him. Goldie looked up at him, her eyes filled with concern. "Remy, what's going on? You look so stressed."

He sighed, standing in front of her. "It's just... pack politics.... That's all it is. That's all it's ever been. Don't worry yourself Valentina, you should go get something to eat."

Goldie thought for a moment, then looked at Remy with a determined glint in her eyes. "Remy, I want to help. I'll perform the Lunathion ritual."

Remy's brows furrowed with concern, he quickly shook his head. "Valentina, I can't ask you to do that. I know it's what I always wanted but I don't want you to feel pressured into doing it. I'm more than capable of navigating all this on my own."

She placed her hand gently on his, silently savoring the toasty warmth of his skin. "Remy, it's the least I can do for you after everything you've done for me. I know I could never repay you for saving my life, but I want you to know that I want to do this, no matter what it takes."

Shock bloomed in Remy's eyes as he looked at her, overwhelmed by her selflessness and sacrifice. "Valentina, the Lunathion ritual... there's something I haven't told you about it"

"What's that?!"

Remy struggled with his words as he slowly cleared his throat. 

"Well... because it's a ritual between the alpha and its Luna, it is generally assumed that the Luna and alpha are mates and therefore married in the werewolf community..."

"Yes." 

She said as she nodded, urging him to continue. 

"The Lunathion ritual ends with the alpha and Luna consummating the ritual." 

Goldie blinked. 

What?! 

..........

Lily Parson sat in the cozy living room of their suburban home, her fingers nervously tapping on the armrest of her chair. The evening sun cast warm, golden hues across the room, but the news she had just received had left her feeling cold and anxious. Her mother had left the nursing home again, the second time this time. 

And it's been a few hours also, the nursing home had only told her just in case Nana came home, but Lily knew the opposite would happen. After what happened the last time, she doubted that her mother would confide in her. Maybe she shouldn't have harshly talked to her. But she was tired. Nana was the only one who refused to come to terms with Goldie's death. And it was exhausting hearing her talk about her. 

"Simon, we need to talk," she called out to her husband, who was in the kitchen.

Simon Parson, a tall man with graying hair, entered the room with a puzzled expression. "Is there something wrong? I leave in a few minutes for a tennis match with a client." 

Lily took a deep breath, her voice trembling as she spoke. "It's about Nana, Simon. She's done it again. She's run away from the nursing home."

Simon sighed, frustration evident in his eyes. 

"The nursing home wanted me to stay home for a while to see if she comes here. But I doubt she will. We should go out and look for her." 

Simon rolled his eyes. 

"Lily, your mother is becoming a real menace. This is the second time this month. I'm tired of this."

Lily's heart sank as she realized the toll her mother's actions were taking on their marriage. It had been a difficult few weeks, with her mother's deteriorating health and constant escapades. She mustered the courage to speak her mind. "I know. I know it's tiring... but she's also dealing with everything and well... age hasn't made it easier for her. It's up to us to help her."

Simon looked at her, a weighty silence hanging in the air. Then, he dropped a bombshell that shattered Lily's world. "Lily, there's something I need to confess."

"What is it?"

Lily asked, not ready for the bombshell that her husband was going to drop. 

"I've been seeing someone else. Before Goldie died, I found comfort in another woman. I only stayed because of what happened to our daughter, but I'm afraid I can't keep up the act anymore." 

Lily's eyes welled up with tears, a mixture of shock, betrayal, and anger flooding her heart. She felt like the ground had been ripped from beneath her feet. "How could you, Simon? After everything we've been through, especially after losing Goldie?"

Simon looked remorseful, his voice filled with regret. "I know it's unforgivable, Lily, but I was drowning in sorrow. I thought I could find happiness elsewhere. I tried so hard to stay for Goldie, but she's gone now, and I can't really keep pretending anymore."

Lily couldn't contain her anger any longer. Her emotions boiled over, and she screamed at her husband. "Get out, Simon! Just get out of here!"
###chapter 38 - The amulet

The preparations for the upcoming Lunathion ritual had brought Goldie and Remy even closer. Despite the large condition that was attached to the ritual, Goldie wanted to stick to her promise. It wasn't that the thought of consummating the ritual with Remy was a disgusting thought... she just found it weird and awkward since they were not close in the romantic sense. 

Remy had assured her she could back down at any moment if she wasn't comfortable with it and she was keeping her options open for the meantime. As the ritual neared, everyone in the house was assigned one task or the other. She was given cleanup duty and told to clean up the rooms in the annexes. Remy had joined her shortly after they had given her her task. 

As they worked side by side, moving furniture and setting up beds for the pack members who would be arriving for the ceremony, Goldie couldn't help but steal glances at Remy. He was a good looking man and she couldn't help but look at him, with his long dark hair that she kept having the insane urge to run her hands through and his warm golden eyes that reminded her of golden honey, and his easygoing personality made him easier to be around with. 

"Pass me that cushion, would you?" Goldie asked, her voice breaking the comfortable silence that had settled between them.

Remy obliged, handing her the embroidered cushion with a smile. "Here you go."

"Are you nervous about the ritual? You haven't talked about it since that day." 

She shook her head, arranging the cushion on a wooden bench. "I know. But I'm not really nervous." 

Remy nodded. "Okay... but like I said, you can back down anytime you want. It's fine." 

He was worrying too much. Too much about what she wanted and what she was thinking. "In a way, I feel useful for playing such a huge part in the ritual. So don't worry about me."

Then something crossed her mind and she decided to ask Remy. 

"Was that why you never mentioned the Lunathion ritual? Did you even mention it before I lost my memories?!"  She spoke carefully, so as to not make a mistake. 

Remy's expression became neutral but he shook his head. 

"Our relationship before was not the smoothest. It didn't seem appropriate in any context to tell you about it then."

Goldie nodded, she wasn't sure she understood what he meant but her question had been answered nonetheless. He didn't tell Valentina about the Lunathion. 

As they continued arranging the room, their conversation drifted to more mundane topics. They talked about their favorite foods, childhood memories, and even shared a few embarrassing stories from their past.

As the sun dipped below the horizon and the room grew dimmer, they were finally done. They could finally leave the annex and go back inside to rest. 


............

Goldie entered the gym, where the scent of polished equipment mixed with the faint aroma of lavender from the air freshener. She found Marielle waiting there, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, and a determined look in her eyes. She remembered when she told Marielle she wanted to train to be stronger, she didn't expect that Marielle would make the effort or be the one to call her to the gym first.

It was her first time stepping into the gym and she didn't even know that they had a home gym until Remy had mentioned it in passing one day.

"Valentina, thanks for coming," Marielle said, patting the heavy bag. "I remember you telling me you wanted to train, I think you've had enough time to rest now." 

Goldie nodded, feeling a little uneasy. She had always admired the fact that Marielle could fight, but she couldn't help but wonder why Marielle had called her. She remembered vividly telling her the other day that she didn't like her. 

Marielle gestured to the gloves hanging on the wall. "Put these on, Valentina. Today, I'm going to teach you some self-defense moves. The first basics you learn are defense tactics and moves." 

Goldie hesitated for a moment but then put on the gloves. She felt like she was about to be part of an action movie scene.

As Marielle began demonstrating some basic punches and kicks, she threw in a few personal questions between moves. "So, Valentina, tell me about you, do you really remember nothing?! I think your memories should be coming back by now, it's been quite a while." 

Goldie tried to concentrate on the training, but Marielle's questions were distracting. She paused mid-kick and looked at Marielle, her brow furrowing. "No. They're not back. I still don't remember anything." 

Marielle paused, her expression unreadable. "Not even one memory?! That's insane." 

Goldie shook her head, feigning sadness. "It's even more harder when people tell me things about myself and I don't know if it's true or not because I don't remember."

Marielle resumed the training, but her questions continued. "What about your phone? I'm sure it must have some sort of clues. Did you look at it thoroughly?!" 

Goldie wondered why Marielle was asking her so many questions. It was very suspicious. "I didn't find anything on it."

As the training session went on, Goldie couldn't help but feel a growing suspicion. Marielle seemed to know something she wasn't sharing. There was a tense undercurrent to their conversation, and Goldie couldn't ignore it any longer.

"Marielle," she said as she blocked a punch, "do you know something that you're not telling me?"

Marielle hesitated, her fists lowering. "I think it would be best if you remember on your own."

Goldie's heart raced as she confronted her. "Tell me, Marielle. I deserve to know."

Marielle sighed, removing her gloves and walking closer to her. "Well, with the attack and with what I found out, it appears that you were involved with a lot of shady people and you probably tried to run away from them. What your business was with them, I don't know, there's still a lot I don't know."

Goldie's mind whirled with questions and fear. What could Valentina have been involved in that was so significant? As she gazed at Marielle, she realized that this unexpected training session was a farce, Marielle tried to see if she knew anything, that was her goal.  

But as Goldie, she didn't know anything and she didn't feel comfortable enough about telling Marielle about the journal. 

........

Lily Parson was alone. She felt more alone than ever since her husband had announced that he wanted a divorce and left the house. Worse, Nana was still missing from the nursing home. Her mother had vanished from the nursing home without a trace, leaving Lily in a state of perpetual worry. She was determined to file a police report the next morning morning, hoping that it would bring some answers. But as she gathered her things and prepared to leave, a knock at the door startled her.

Lily opened the door to find her Aunt Camilla standing there. She had not seen her aunt in a year, her aunt was meant to come to Goldie's funeral but her flight was canceled because of weather conditions. Aunt Camilla in a way reminded her of her mother, a younger version of her mother. With the same brown eyes, the wrinkles around her eyes and her dark blond hair that was splattered with grey hair. Concern was etched across Aunt Camilla's gentle face. "Aunt Camilla, what are you doing here?" Lily asked, surprised by the unexpected visit.

Camilla embraced her niece tightly, holding her close as if trying to shield her from the harsh world. "Lily, my dear, I had to come the minute I was in town. I couldn't bear to see you going through this alone," she said softly. "I know how much you loved your daughter." 

Lily's eyes welled up with tears at the mention of her daughter. Camilla's presence was a bittersweet reminder of the family's losses.

Camilla continued, her voice soothing, "I came here to assure you that your mother is safe, Lily. She's on a special journey, and she will return to the nursing home once she's finished with her task. You must trust me on this."

Lily couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope at her aunt's words, but she was also very confused. "But, Aunt Camilla, where could she possibly be going?"

Camilla offered a faint smile. "Some things are beyond your understanding for now my dear. But you must trust me on this, your mother is fine and she wanted me to assure you that she is well and hearty. She will be back very soon." 

As Lily wiped away her tears, she felt a sense of comfort wash over her. Perhaps her mother's disappearance wasn't as alarming as she had initially thought. Maybe her mother could use some time with her sister, maybe she wanted a break from the home.

Camilla then gently asked, "May I see Goldie's room? I'd like to spend a moment there."

Lily nodded, grateful for the support of her aunt. She led Camilla to Goldie's room, and gave her some privacy. Camilla moved quietly through the room, her fingers trailing over mementos of Goldie's life.

Unbeknownst to Lily, as Camilla appeared to be lost in her thoughts, she discreetly pocketed a few of Goldie's personal items-a small hairbrush with strands of her curly hair still on it, a pink tank top from her pile of dirty clothes that still smelled of her perfume and had her scent, and as she rummaged through her drawer, she found the last thing she was looking for, an amulet with a gold stone.  

The amulet that Goldie was supposed to be wearing every time. The amulet that kept her soul in place. She must have not known it's use if she had taken it off, because she was never supposed to take it off. Camilla stuffed all this into her large purse. 

After a few moments, Camilla came out of the room and turned to Lily, her eyes filled with pity for her niece. "Thank you for letting me visit, Lily. It means the world to me," she said.
###chapter 39 - In my dreams 

Isabel Fleming stood in the dimly lit, cavernous interior of the old, abandoned cathedral, standing and waiting silently. Her brother-in-law, Greg, stood beside her, equally solemn. This was the secret meeting place of the enigmatic society they had both been a part of for years. But tonight, they had come with a desperate plea. They had been lucky that the council of elders had granted them an audience so fast and so quickly, it could take weeks before they were granted an audience in most cases, but they were fortunate enough to get one after three days. 

The cathedral was an eerie, gothic masterpiece, its towering arches and stained glass windows casting haunting shadows in the moonlight. Isabel and Greg were joined by the leaders of the society, who had gathered in a solemn circle.

Isabel's voice trembled as she spoke, "I know we're bound by our oaths of secrecy, but I can't bear that my granddaughter's soul wanders about so aimlessly. As you all know, she has the power to shift her soul, when I found out that she had an accident, I knew she was not gone forever. My dreams have been fervent and they have shown me that she is not gone, but only lost. The ancient bells in this cathedral are the only instrument strong enough to call back her soul. We plead to you to borrow them to us for the ritual."

Greg added, "We're willing to do whatever it takes to bring her back, the bell is a crucial part of the ritual."

The society's leaders exchanged solemn glances before the eldest among them, a woman known as Grandmother, stepped forward. She had always been the wisest and most revered member.

"Isabel, Greg," Grandmother said, her voice as ancient as the cathedral itself, "even if you have the bells, do you have a host body for your daughter's soul to inhabit?"

Greg and Isabel looked at each other and shifted. 

"We found a volunteer. She is also a believer of the faith and she has come to us willingly when she heard our call." 

The society leaders exchanged glances again. 

"If we give you the bells, you must not only promise it's safe return, you must also promise that your granddaughter willingly joins the faith as a member."

Isabel and Greg exchanged a hesitant glance, knowing that this decision would change Goldie's life forever. How would Goldie react to everything they would tell her?! Or everything she was about to tell her?! It was going to be a difficult task. But the thought of having her beloved granddaughter back was too powerful to resist.

After a moment of silence, they nodded in agreement. "We'll do whatever it takes," Isabel affirmed.

The society's leaders, their faces hidden by hoods, nodded in return, and one of them left the dais. Isabel and Greg waited patiently.

After what seemed to be an eternity of waiting, one of them returned with a box in her hand. She walked carefully towards them, holding the box as if she was holding a box of eggs. Then when she stood in front of Isabel and Greg, she looked straight at her.

"You're an old and trusted member of the faith Isabel, I don't need to give you a lecture about how important the bells are."

"I will guard them with my life." Isabel said with reverence. 

The society leader nodded. 

"The bells are to be handled with utmost care and returned right after the ritual. I can't make any promises that you would recover your daughter, but it is worth a trial." 

Isabel would have fell to her knees in gratitude if she could, but she couldn't. 

"I cannot thank you enough. I shall hold my end of the bargain and keep to my promises."

She continued. 

"When Goldie is back with us, she shall join the faith." 

.......

After the long stress of preparing for the lunathion ritual, Goldie had been rewarded with icecream from Ellen. Apparently the chef had gone shopping and picked up some of her favorite flavors and desserts. She was ecstatic after a long hard day's work and she saw the icecream. 

It was just what she needed. 

She stayed and kept Ellen company after that. She couldn't deny that the two of them had become close and they had lots of interests too. Ellen seemed to be the only person apart from Remy who genuinely liked her. The rest of them probably only liked her because she was their alpha's mate. But Ellen liked her for who she was and Goldie had a feeling that Ellen would still like her even if she found out that she wasn't the real Valentina. 

As the night fell, she prepared for bed. She and Remy had a routine now. She would shower before bed and he would do the same after her, they would both wait till the other was ready before falling asleep. Goldie would nestle herself in the comforting embrace of Remy's arms, the soothing rhythm of his heartbeat lulling her to sleep.

But this night, another dream plagued her, Goldie found herself in an eerie scene. She found herself in what seemed to be an isolated hospital. As she walked down the white pristine walls of the hospital, she felt particularly drawn to the last door in the hall, so she opened the door. 

As she opened the door, she stood motionless, watching as Colin gazed upon her lifeless body. Her real body this time. She was laid out on the gurney, her blond curly hair lay limp on the table. Her body was covered with only a sheet and even with it, she could see her bloodied face and the scars from the accident. Colin's anguished screams pierced the silence, startling her. Desperation welled up inside her, and she tried to call out to him from the other side of the room.

"Colin! Colin! Colin it's me! I'm here!"

He turned to look at her, but then looked away. 

"Colin?!"

She called again as she looked at him. He ignored her, his eyes solely focused on her body. 
She looked at herself and turned to look at her reflection on the glass door. 

Black hair. Blue eyes stared back at her. She wasn't in her body. She was Valentina, how could he recognize her. 

Suddenly, she jolted awake, her heart pounding, and she found herself gasping for breath. In her panic, she called out, "Colin!" Remy, was roused from his peaceful slumber, confusion etched across his face.

"Valentina?! Did you have another nightmare?!"

He asked as she looked around gasping for breath. 

"Colin." 

She murmured again. 

"Who's Colin?" he asked, his voice laced with curiosity and a slight hint of jealousy.

Caught in the residual tendrils of her unsettling dream, she hesitated, unable to provide a coherent answer. She couldn't tell him who Colin was. He wouldn't understand. 

But why was she dreaming about Colin? Was Colin alright?! 

She wondered if she needed to see him or talk to him. 

Remy, feeling a twinge of insecurity, sighed and nestled back into the sheets, his arms no longer as inviting as they were earlier. Goldie stayed up, wondering what the dream meant. Was there a hidden meaning to the dream? Was the dream trying to tell her something?

This was the first time she ever saw Colin in her dreams. She couldn't quite understand what it meant. 

In the quiet of the night, Goldie lay awake, her thoughts a tangled web of memories and emotions. She couldn't shake the haunting image of Colin, the unanswered questions, and the inexplicable connection that still seemed to linger. As dawn approached, she finally closed her eyes, she tried to sleep and she slowly fell into a dreamless slumber.
###chapter 40 - The Sauna 

Goldie and Remy sat across from each other during breakfast. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, the chef had made scrambled eggs, some porridge,  some waffles and fresh strawberries and the sound of chirping birds provided a serene backdrop to their meal. They had not really spoken to each other that morning, because when she woke up Remy was not on the bed. He had left for a jog, or a run, she couldn't remember what he had murmured. She went ahead to brush her teeth and freshen up. She had spent some extra time washing her hair and when she got downstairs she noticed that it was only her and Remy at the dining table. Kale and Marielle sometimes had their meals in their rooms and Ellen who was always having meals at the dining table was sleeping in, leaving only her and Remy. 

Goldie couldn't shake the feeling of guilt that had plagued her since she woke up that morning. She remembered when she woke up from her  dream she had been calling Colin's name. Remy asked her who Colin was and she didn't give him a reply. She could tell that it bothered him, It had left her feeling uneasy, and she needed to talk to Remy about it.

"Remy," she began tentatively, "about last night... I noticed you looked upset after I woke you up from your nightmare." 

Remy looked up from his plate of scrambled eggs, his eyes meeting her gaze. "Upset?About what, Valentina?"

Goldie hesitated for a moment, trying to find the right words. "I don't know, but you asked me who I was talking about as I woke up calling their name and when I didn't answer you looked a little upset as you went back to bed. But honestly, I have no idea who Colin is, and I don't want you to worry about that."

Remy's brow furrowed slightly, and he set down his fork. "Alright. But isn't it strange that you were calling out his name? Perhaps he was someone you knew in your past. What was the dream about?"

Goldie's heart raced in her chest, and she did her best to appear convincing. "Nothing sensible to be honest. I can't even remember much of it... I don't think it was that important." 

As she spoke, Goldie couldn't help but notice Remy's intense gaze. He was looking at her intently, and she could feel his eyes boring into her, as if he was searching for something beneath her words. She tried to maintain her composure, but it was hard to do that with his steely gaze on her.

Remy's expression softened when he saw that she was uncomfortable, and  then he leaned back in his chair, his voice gentle. "Alright, Valentina. If you say so. Dreams can be strange sometimes."

Relief washed over Goldie as Remy appeared to accept her explanation. She continued to eat her breakfast, but she couldn't shake the feeling that Remy knew she was lying. 

"You're right. It's probably the stress and everything. Must have made my brain a little too active." 

Remy nodded, he seemed to agree with her. 

"You should get some rest, you have been working quite hard these last few days."

Goldie looked somehow relieved as she faced her food squarely, Remy, on the other hand, couldn't help but wonder why Goldie had felt the need to lie to him. He had listened intently to her heartbeat while she spoke and that skipped beat had not gone unnoticed. It was one of the little skills that came with being a werewolf, but he didn't use it as often as he should because he only utilised it in formal settings. Besides, people had their way of lying while speaking the truth, giving half truths or not revealing the full story, or just outrightly manipulating the situation. The skill unfortunately could not work in those situations.
 He knew there was more to the story than she was letting on and he wondered if there was something that she was hiding, but for now, he decided to bide his time and wait for the right moment to unravel the mystery that was Valentina Combe. 

......

Goldie and Ellen were spending the day together after she had breakfast with Remy. At least a few hours. Ellen had suggested she go to the spa as a way to prepare for the Lunathion ritual and all she could think about was getting to relax and getting a massage so she agreed.  They had embarked on a journey to a serene spa close to the sea.  Ellen had made it very clear that the brief retreat wasn't merely for relaxation; it was for her preparation for the sacred Lunathion ritual. Despite claiming to have never seen or experience the ritual before, Ellen spoke about it in complete reverence and awe, making Goldie more receptive to the positive parts of the ritual. 

As they stepped into the soothing warmth of the sauna, Goldie and Ellen settled onto wooden benches, steam swirling around them like a comforting embrace.

Ellen, her gaze fixed on the steam swirling around them, finally broke the silence. "Valentina, I've been wanting to talk to you about something."

Goldie turned to Ellen, her eyes filled with a mix of curiosity and concern. "Of course. What's on your mind?"

Taking a deep breath, Ellen hesitated before she spoke. "I know I might have mentioned this before, but now that we're alone, I feel even more comfortable mentioning it." 

"Mentioning what?" Goldie slowly asked. 

Ellen smiled faintly. "The fact that you're an entirely different person. I mean I know that you've lost your memories, but your mannerisms, your personality, it seems like everything about you has changed." 

Goldie's heart pounded, and she swallowed hard. She managed a nervous laugh. "I think I'm also a little scared about the change... I don't remember who I was before and I'm not sure how I would feel when I get my memories back." 

Ellen's warm gaze softened, and she reached out to squeeze her hand. "I like who you are now, I cannot deny it. I don't think I'd have ever been friends with the old you. But the new you is very comforting and refreshing." 

Goldie felt a lump forming in her throat, she wished she didn't have to lie, Ellen was such a sweet person. "I'm glad you prefer this version of me. Quite frankly, I think I prefer this version too." 

Ellen chuckled softly, her eyes reflecting years of wisdom. "Oh Valentina, I know it's scary but change is not something to be feared. It's something to be celebrated. I think this new you is just you without all the trauma and suffering you had to endure. I don't know a lot  about you but it seems like you've had a very sad childhood and it must have affected you." 

Goldie smiled. That could be it, Valentina must have been through a lot for her not to have talked about her childhood or anything about her past. For her not to have talked about her past even to the people she should have considered family. "Thank you, Ellen. Your words mean the world to me. I'm glad you like this new version of me."
###chapter 41 - Of Vessels and rituals.
Deep within the heart of the ancient woods, Isabel Fleming, Goldie's grandmother, Greg Colby, her brother-in-law, and Camilla her sister gathered in a circle, their voices hushed in reverence. They stood underneath the shadowy light of a full moon, ready to perform the ritual that was meant to bring Goldie back. Their mission was clear: to call Goldie's soul back into a host body, Lisa, who had volunteered to be a vessel for Goldie. Lisa had been heavily drugged and she was unconscious and laying on the floor, her body ready as a vessel to receive Goldie Parson. 

Isabel, the elder of the three, stood at the center, her silver hair gleaming in the moon light filtering through the trees. Her hands trembled slightly as she raised the ancient bell that she had taken out of its box. An ordinary eye would perceive it to be an old bell, some sort of relic, but a more experienced eye would notice that it looked similar to shaman bells, similar, but not the same. And one of its main purposes was calling souls and spirits.

Greg and Camilla, Isabel's younger sister, completed the circle, she had brought the personal items that belonged to Goldie. She had retrieved them earlier from Goldie's room without her mother's knowledge and the items lay in the circle that they had made. Camilla clutched an ancient tome, its pages filled with incantations and symbols, while Greg held a wooden staff adorned with intricate carvings that pulsed with energy. 

As the ritual began, their voices intertwined, weaving a tapestry of power and longing. Isabel's voice, soft yet commanding, led the incantation. Camilla's fingers traced the symbols in the book, her eyes locked on Lisa, who stood at the edge of the circle, her face filled with determination. The air around them grew charged with energy, and the ground beneath their feet seemed to tremble. The spell was no ordinary spell and soon the birds that had settled around them started to fly away, sensing the change of atmosphere. Isabel rang the bell. Three times only, she was to ring it three times. She rang it first, nothing. 

The second time, still nothing. 

As the incantation reached its crescendo, a sense of despair settled over them. Camilla's  eyes filled with tears, and she whispered, "I can't feel her presence yet. Goldie, where are you?"

Isabel's heart sank, and her hands trembled even more as she rang the bell for the third and the last time. Nothing happened. Nothing was happening. She had rung the bell three times, they had done everything that they were supposed to do, everything that they should have done and the spell didn't work. 

Greg, his voice cracking with desperation, tried to maintain his focus on the staff, but it had grown lifeless in his hands. Camilla's fingers slipped on the book's pages, smudging the symbols she had so carefully traced.

They continued the incantation for what felt like an eternity, but the connection they sought remained elusive and since they couldn't ring the bell anymore, there was no use. Goldie's soul refused to answer their call, lost somewhere beyond their reach.

Exhausted and defeated, they finally lowered their hands and ceased the incantation. The woods fell into a heavy silence, as if nature itself mourned their failure.

Isabel's shoulders slumped, tears streaming down her face. "I was so sure we could bring her back, we did everything that we could." she whispered.

Isabel reached out and embraced her sister, offering her comfort. "There must be some sort of explanation for this, perhaps we can consult the leaders of the faith. This isn't normal" she said, her voice trembling with emotion. "Don't worry too much Isabel, I'm sure Goldie is out there somehow."

Greg nodded. 

"As long as her soul is still out there, there is hope. We can try again."

Isabel sighed. 

"We can't keep the bells with us forever, we only borrowed it from the society because of the ritual."

Greg nodded. 

"And we will let them know that the ritual failed. I'm sure that itself would pique their interests. Maybe they would even help."

It was a longshot, but it did look like a possibility, if the faith wanted Goldie as their member, they would certainly be interested in getting her soul back. 

"But why do you think it didn't work?"

Camilla asked. 

This time, it was Isabel who sighed and replied. 

"She could be very far away from us."

 "Or, the other dreaded reason is that she could be very well lost to us forever."

.....

Goldie and Remy had been preparing for the night of the Lunathion ritual for days. In the heart of the forest, beneath the shimmering moon, their pack had gathered for the sacred event under the full moon. There was dancing, there were celebrations and the werewolves looked happier than ever. It was their very first ritual in years and a lot of werwolves had come, many of them wanted to witness the magic of the ritual, many of them were eager to set eyes on the luna that had saved them for decades and decades of no luna. 

In the deep dark night, many of the werewolves had changed into their wolf forms, Goldie and Remy had decided that since she couldn't shift into her wolf form, they would be in their human form, there seemed to be no rules against it as long as the rules of the ritual were followed. 

"Tonight, my people," Remy began as he addressed the pack, his eyes reflecting the silvery glow of the moon, "is a night of unity and transformation. We shall become one with the spirit of the wolf, and together we will dance under the light of our moon goddess, in high hopes that she will bless us with the power and strength of the Lunathion."

The werewolves around them howled in unison, signifying their agreement to the words of their alpha. Goldie's heart pounded with anticipation, this was it, it was about to begin, this was the ritual that she had told Remy that she would participate in. Her palms started to feel very sweaty but she managed to maintain her composure, Remy's presence was oddly comforting, she liked being near him.

As the moon reached its zenith, the werewolves and the whole pack gathered in a circle, a blazing fire was in the middle of the circle, their breaths visible in the chilly night air. Remy and Goldie stood side by side, their eyes locked in a silent promise, the atmosphere had changed, Goldie could feel it. Even in his human form, Remy held just as much power and influence as he would in his wolf form, she didn't know if it was due to the influence of the full moon, but he looked more wolf than human. While she had opted for a white simple gown, Remy had gone shirtless and even though she had seen him shirtless a few times before, this time he was different. He was pulsing with raw power and muscle and when he howled to signify the beginning of the Lunathion ritual, something in her instinctively made her join, something that was not her, could it be Valentina's wolf? Responding to the howls of her alpha?

 The pack members howled too and the ritual began.  In their wolf forms, the pack moved gracefully, a mesmerizing blend of power and elegance. Goldie once again felt that same instinct and  she was compelled to join the dance. Her limbs moved on their own accord, her movements similar to the wolves even though their form was different. The whole pack moved as one and howled as one around the fire and the fire shone even brighter.

The ritual seemed to stretch on for eternity and yet pass in the blink of an eye. The bond between Remy and Goldie deepened with each step, each beat of their heart, and they could feel the presence of the ancient spirits weaving through them. Finally, as the moonlight started to wane, the wolves started to shift back to their human forms, gasping for breath and covered in a glistening sheen of sweat. The pack cheered and clapped, celebrating their successful performance of the ancient dance.

Exhausted yet exhilarated, Remy and Goldie were led back to their room with the pack elders in tow guiding them, they had twenty-four hours to consummate the ritual and despite the exhaustion on their faces, everyone knew the ritual was not over yet. It was the final step. The anticipation of finally consummating the ritual hung heavy in the air and Remy and Goldie were led into the bedroom, with the door shut tightly behind them.

The two of them stood awkwardly for a few moments. They were both sweaty and tired, Goldie's knees felt like churned butter after so much dancing. Remy himself looked tired too, his body was covered in an oily sheen of sweat and his dark hair looked damp and wavy, but his eyes remained on her. 

Goldie smiled awkwardly. 

"We should probably shower first..."

She started and Remy broke out of his gaze and nodded, a nervous look on his face. 

"Right."

He said. 

 Goldie made her way to the bathroom, but as she was just about to reach the door, she clutched her head, a sudden, intense pain surging through her.

Remy's concern was immediate, he rushed to her side. "Valentina, what's wrong?" he asked, holding her trembling form.

She struggled to speak, her voice barely a whisper. "Bells. Bells."

"Valentina, what are you saying? Talk to me!" Remy's voice was frigid with fear as he held on to her. 

"A throbbing... in my head... it hurts," she managed before collapsing into his arms.

Panicked, Remy laid her gently on the bed, his heart racing. He called for help, and Kale and Marielle rushed into the room first, when Kale saw her limp form on the bed, he sent for the healer. Goldie's eyes fluttered as she slipped into unconsciousness, and Remy's worry deepened.

The pack's healer was there in a minute, Remy cleared out the room to avoid unnecessary panic.  The pack healer examined her and sorrowfully announced, "I don't know what's wrong with her, her pulse is weak and she has gone cold."

"She said something about a throbbing in her head."

Remy said. 

The healer shook his head. 

"Keep her warm, I will check on her in a while, let me get my bag."

Remy nodded. 

Then he stopped the healer. 

"I want your full discretion. Tell no one about this."

The healer nodded. 

"Yes Alpha."


###chapter 42 - Perfect landing

Goldie awoke to the sound of a car engine, the gentle caress of a cool breeze on her skin, and a lingering sense of confusion that clung to her like mist. She struggled to sit up, her body feeling heavy and lethargic. How long has she been asleep?! 

"Valentina, don't push yourself," a concerned voice whispered beside her. It was Remy, he was seated next to her bedside,  his eyes filled with worry. "You've been out for hours. You must be very weak." 

Goldie blinked, trying to clear the fog in her mind. Her memory was a jumbled mess, like pieces of a puzzle scattered across her consciousness. But one thing stood out - the Lunathion ritual. Last she could remember, they were dancing underneath the moonlight, she couldn't really remember much after that.

"Remy," Goldie rasped, her voice weak. "The Lunathion ritual, do we still have a chance to finish it?"

Remy's brows furrowed, torn between his concern for her and the importance of the ritual. He had watched her religiously all night, worried that her condition would get worse. The healer had assured him that she would be fine, but she was exhausted and needed rest. 

"Valentina, you're not well. I don't even care about the ritual right now. Your health is what matters right now."

Goldie's heart swelled with emotion at Remy's words. He cared about the ritual, he knew the importance of the ritual and yet he still chose her over it. She reached out to him, her hand trembling as she cupped his cheek.

"I know how much the ritual means to you," she whispered, her eyes brimming with tears. "I'm really sorry that I couldn't complete it. I wish things had gone differently..."

Remy smiled, his fingers gently brushing her cheek. "You don't need to apologize. Let's focus on getting you better," he said softly. "I just want you back on your feet very soon again." 

Goldie nodded, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. She leaned in, pressing her lips to Remy's cheek in a gentle, reassuring kiss. Remy was surprised but he shot her a smile, she laid back on the bed, her eyes closing as she drifted into a light sleep. 

.......

Isabel Fleming stood nervously at her daughter Lily Parson's doorstep. It had been days since they had seen each other, days since she had run away from the nursing home to attempt the spell that was supposed to bring back her granddaughter. Her heart was heavy with guilt for running away from her nursing home and worrying her daughter, she knew that her sister  Camilla must have reassured Lily when she came to visit, but she still felt very badly about her behavior. She took a deep breath and rang the doorbell.

Lily Parson, her eyes puffy from all the crying she had been doing since she woke up in her daughter's room, answered the door. Her face lit up when she saw her mother standing there. "Mom!" she exclaimed, pulling her mother into a warm embrace. "Why would you do that to me?! How could you leave without letting me know?!"

Tears welled up in Nana's eyes as she hugged her daughter tightly. "I've missed you, Lily," she said softly. "I'm so sorry for leaving the nursing home like that, but like Camilla explained, there was something that I really needed to do."

Lily sighed. "You're going to tell me all about this important task that made you run away from the nursing home. " she said, leading her mother inside the house and into the cozy living room.

They sat down on the couch, and Isabel looked around the house, surprised to see all the boxes. 

She looked at Lily with concern. "Are you moving?! And what's wrong with you? You look like you've just been crying." 

Lily took a deep breath, her eyes filled with sadness. "Simon says he wants a divorce. He's packing his things." 

Nana's heart sank as she listened to her daughter's words.

"That bastard!!! At a time like this?!"

Isabel sounded furious, her rage only pushed Lily into tears. 

"He said he stayed this long because of Goldie and tried to stay after her death but he couldn't do it anymore... he said he's been seeing someone else..."

"If I lay my hands on that wretched man, I'll kill him. I'll kill him Lily! With my bare hands!" 

Lily wiped her tears slowly. 

She squeezed her mother's hand gently.

"I'm just glad that you're here." 

Isabel squeezed Lily's hand back. "I'm here for you, Lily. Whatever you need, I'll always be here." 

Lily managed a weak smile, grateful for her mother. "Thank you, Mom. Your presence means the world to me."

After a moment of silence, Lily looked at her mother thoughtfully. "Now that you're back, I've been thinking. Instead of going back to the nursing home, why don't you come live with me? I could use the company, and I want to take care of you."

Her mother's eyes welled up with tears of gratitude. "Oh, Lily, that would mean so much to me. I would love to be with you, especially at a time like this... "

........

The moon hung low in the sky as the private jet  descended upon the sprawling city of Los Angeles. Rafael Lucas peered out his windows as the wheels of the aircraft touched the runway, signaling his arrival.

As the plane taxied towards the gate, Rafael Lucas leaned back in his seat, a cigar clenched between his teeth. Smoke swirled around him, a fitting metaphor for the haze of danger that always seemed to follow him. His piercing blue eyes scanned the cityscape below, he was finally in LA. And he was there to take back what he owned. 

Exiting the plane, he strode confidently through the runway, his presence drawing curious glances from those around him. He was met by his loyal men and a Rolls Royce that was waiting for him. He got into the car, at least two of his trusted men were already in the car, bowing slightly. 

"Boss, we finally have some news," one of them said, a sense of urgency in his voice.

Rafael arched an eyebrow as he took another drag from his cigar. "Tell me," he replied in a low, gravelly voice.

"We found a message from the only werewolf who survived Valentina's brutal attack in that town." another one of his men  explained. "She was working with a werewolf, he was the one who killed our men. An alpha named Remington Albrecht. We found out he was the one who picked her up in the hospital too. I suspect that they are mates." 

Rafael's eyes narrowed. Valentina Combe was a name that stirred deep anger and hatred within him. She was a dangerous woman and she was even more dangerous as a werewolf. She had betrayed him, stole from him and he had been on the hunt for her ever since. This new man she had protecting her, whoever he was, he was only going to meet his end if he stuck with such a woman. Valentina Combe deserved nothing but death, right after he collected everything that she took from him.

"What's the message?" Rafael demanded.

His man hesitated for a moment before speaking, his voice trembling slightly. "He said he's coming for you. And he'll kill you." 

A deep growl rumbled in Rafael's chest as he crushed the cigar in his hand. Smoke curled around his fingers, and his men could feel the intensity of his rage.

"Valentina will pay for her sins," he snarled, his voice dripping with venom. "And as for the Alpha who can't seem to mind his business, he will regret ever crossing my path."
###chapter 43 - Oak Creek

The moon hung low in the night sky as Marielle and Kale made their way to the clearing in the heart of the dense forest where they had performed the Lunathion ritual dance. Remy was out there, he had been there for a while. It was the first time he had left the room since Valentina's incident. Marielle had  heard something about her being slightly indisposed after the ritual dance, Remy had remained in his quarters with her for hours on end after that. Marielle didn't really think about it enough until she saw the healer coming out of their room. 
That was when she suspected that something must have gone wrong. 

Did they finish the ritual?  Did something happen?! Was Valentina more than slightly indisposed?

As Remy approached, his powerful presence seemed to cast a shadow even over the moon. Marielle shifted uncomfortably as she saw the stern look on his face. 

Marielle spoke first. "How was the ritual? It's been over twenty four hours and we didn't receive an update." 

Kale nodded in agreement. "Yes, Remy. Marielle told me she spotted a healer in your room. Did something go wrong?" 

"I don't know how we're supposed to feel after the ritual has been completed but I think there's something you're not telling us." 

Remy regarded them both with a calm demeanor. "I understand your concerns and your worries, you're right to ask me these questions." 

"Valentina and I didn't consummate the ritual."

There as a short silence as both Marielle and Kale stared at each other. Marielle's eyes blazed with anger. "What? Remy, everything we've worked for, all the preparations we've made-it's all been for nothing?"

Kale's frustration mirrored Marielle's. "Remy, you more than anyone here knows the importance of this ritual. Why would you neglect it?"

Remy's gaze remained steady, his voice resolute. "Valentina was ill and unconscious through the night. When she finally woke up, she was too weak and tired, I wouldn't have forced her to complete the ritual. I care for her well-being above all else."

Marielle clenched her fists, it was all for nothing then! Everything was all for nothing. "But Remy, you are the alpha, you know that the future of our pack, our very survival and this whole mantle business depends on the success of the ritual. What should we tell the pack members now?"

Remy's response was unexpected. "We tell them nothing. Let them assume that the ritual was consummated. It's the only way to ensure stability within the pack. If our rivals ask us about it, we'll simply claim to have done the ritual."

"Like I mentioned earlier, I care about Valentina and I wouldn't force or pressure her into doing what she doesn't want to do." 

Kale sighed heavily but reluctantly nodded in agreement. "I suppose you're right. If our pack believes the ritual was successful, then we wouldn't say or suggest otherwise." 

Remy's eyes softened as he looked at Kale. "Thank you for understanding. We must always prioritize the well-being of the pack, even if it means keeping secrets."



.......

Goldie couldn't really explain what exactly happened after the Lunathion ritual, all she could remember was the sound of bells and a ringing in her head and she went blank. The next day when she was feeling better, she took a walk around the property, just to clear her head and stretch her legs and out of sheer boredom and curiosity,  she decided to revisit her old social media accounts. She still remembered all the passwords to most of them. 

She saw a few friends post about her death on the day it happened as she logged into her Facebook account and then she saw the moment they moved on. Then she saw the posts of the people who had died with her body, her best friend Blossom, Callum and one other person names Justin whom she was not familiar with. Her other friends had been posting about their lives, sharing their latest achievements and adventures, and it made her miss everything. It made her miss being Goldie Parson. 

She could remember much of her life. She had a happy childhood. An even happier family. She had parents who loved her and she was surrounded by so many great friends. She was the popular girl in high school, she was the popular girl in college too and she was also the girl who had lots of friends and was in a sorority. 

She missed her life. 

She missed every part of it. 

.........

Colin Lockwood had taken a brief break from work as he huddled in the lounge room in his office nursing a plastic cup filled with straight black coffee. He had opened his phone and scrolled around for a while. Till he saw something that made him concerned. 

One of the apps he was on was showing that Goldie was online and was active. 

That couldn't be right. He thought as he checked it again, same thing. 

He ignored it for a while and went to another app, the same thing popped up. 

Colin's heart raced as he contemplated the implications. Had her account been hacked? Or was her mother the one online? 

Without wasting any more time, he picked up his phone and dialed Mrs Parson just to be sure. 

"Hello?"

"Mrs. Parson, it's Colin. I don't want to alarm you, but something strange is happening. Goldie's social media accounts are active right now," Colin explained quickly

Mrs. Parson gasped, her heart sinking as she clutched the phone. "What? Who would do that? I don't know.. I don't have access to her accounts." 

"I don't know, but I think you should do something about it. Maybe find a way of closing down the accounts?"Colin replied urgently.

There was a short silence before Mrs Parson replies. "Thank you for letting me know Colin I'll see what I can do about it." 

.......

Meanwhile, Marielle noticed that Valentina had been unusually absorbed in her phone for quite some time as she walked around the property. She wondered what she was doing. Besides, Marielle was still angry about the whole failed lunathion issue and Valentina was just walking about like it wasn't her problem. She approached her, pretending to be taking a short jog around the property too. 

"Just a quick jog. How are you doing?" Marielle asked, a hint of curiosity in her voice.

Goldie glanced up from her phone, quickly hiding it in her pocket, a sheepish grin crossing her face. "I'm good... just taking a walk." 

Marielle couldn't help but feel a twinge of suspicion, besides, she quickly hid her phone like nothing happened.  Marielle on the other hand had learned the password a few weeks ago. She didn't think she would have actual use of it, nor did she even think that it was right to snoop but she had no choice. There were things about Valentina that she had to learn. 

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Marielle's curiosity got the better of her. She waited until Valentina fell asleep on the couch in the lounge room, her phone left unattended on the coffee table. Marielle, her heart pounding with a mix of guilt and curiosity, leaned over and picked up the phone.  She silently prayed that she had not changed the password as she imputed the numbers. 

The phone unlocked, revealing a myriad of recently used apps and notifications. Marielle's eyes widened as she noticed that Valentina was logged into various social media accounts under the name "Goldie Parson" or "Marigold Parson"

"Who is this?!"  She whispered to herself. 

She stirred in her sleep and Marielle quickly put the phone down, tiptoeing out of the lounge room and running straight to her room.

In her room, she pulled out her laptop, typing in the name Goldie Parson. 

Several news articles popped up talking about the tragic death of some young people in a brutal car accident, Goldie was one of them. 
But the information that had stood out to her the most was the town the girl was in.

Oak Creek. 

The same town Remy found Valentina.
###chapter 44 - The betrayal 

Goldie stared out of the window, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon. After she had checked her personal accounts, she couldn't help but feel a sense of longing for her former life. She missed her family more than words could express. It had been at least three months since she had seen them, and the ache in her heart had only grown deeper with time. The memories of her mother's smiling face and her father's calming presence tormented her. 

The next evening, Goldie decided she couldn't bear it any longer. She needed to see her family, even if it meant deceiving Remy, she had to find a way to get back to Oaks Creek. She knew it was a long shot and that seeing her family wouldn't guarantee anything, it might not even give her any comfort since they would not recognize her in somebody else's body, but Goldie knew she had to try. So, she devised a plan to visit her family under the guise of seeking help from the specialist in Oaks Creek for her missing memories.

Remy was the only person she could turn to, she also had to phrase the question in a way that it wouldn't raise too much suspicion on her part. 

As they sat in one of the cozy living rooms, Remy enjoying a glass of wine with his eyes on the laptop in front of him, Goldie hesitated to broach the subject. Finally, she took a deep breath and said, "Remy, I've been struggling  to tell you something for a while now, and I think that it's time I tell you about it." 

Remy looked concerned, he put his laptop away. "What's going on? Are you okay?" 

Goldie nodded.

"I'm not... it's been months and I haven't gotten back my memories. I've been thinking about me going back to see the specialist." 

"I think I want to give her another trial, maybe she can help me. I'm tired of living without my memories." 

Remy's eyes softened with empathy. "Of course, Valentina. That shouldn't be a problem, whenever you're ready just let me know, I'll come with you."


Tears of guilt welled up in Goldie's eyes as she thanked Remy. 

She didn't like lying to him, but there was no way he would believe the things coming out of her mouth if she was being honest with him. 

She knew that she was manipulating his kindness and care for her, but the thought of seeing her family again was too enticing to resist.

"When do you want to leave?"

He asked and she sighed. 

"I want to just go and get it over with. I think we should leave tomorrow if that's okay with you." 

"I just... I'm just really tired of it all. I miss them Remy..."

Remy, who had probably thought that she was talking about her memories nodded in unison, his face soft and empathetic. 

"You'll give me a few hours to put some things in order and then we'll leave."


.......


Goldie Parson had always been a daddy's girl, and her father, Simon Parson, loved his daughter. When she and Remy had arrived at Oaks Creek, she told Remy to let her go see the specialist on her own while he stayed in their hotel. Surprisingly, Remy had agreed and Goldie diverted and walked to her father's office building. 

As Goldie pushed open the door to her father's office building, a sight met her eyes that left her dumbfounded. There, in the elevator across in the lobby, stood her father, Simon, cozying up to a woman she had never seen before. They were laughing, their arms intertwined, and she couldn't ignore the unmistakable affection in their eyes.

Goldie's initial reaction was a surge of anger and betrayal. She fought to control her emotions, swallowing the lump in her throat. What was going on? Her father was married to her mother, and as far as she knew, they were happily wedded for years. She didn't think she had ever even seen then even fight. 

As Simon and the woman walked across the lobby together, Goldie couldn't let her curiosity go unanswered. Her father walked back into the building moments later and despite being in another body, Valentina still hid her face from him, afraid that he would see her. 

She decided to follow the mysterious woman discreetly. Heart pounding, she trailed her through the busy streets of the town until she finally caught up with the woman at a nearby park.

With trembling nerves, Goldie approached the woman, who was now sitting on a park bench, engrossed in her phone. She cleared her throat nervously, and the woman looked up with a faintly surprised expression.

"Excuse me," Goldie began, "Can I sit here?"

She asked and the woman nodded. "Sure."

Goldie sat next to her. The woman had short blond hair and she was wearing jeans and a blue top. She looked like she could be in her early thirties, or maybe even younger. 

"I was just at the Staten building, I'm sorry to pry but I couldn't help but notice you with Mr Parson earlier. How do you know him?"

The woman glanced at Goldie for a moment, assessing her, and then smiled slyly. "I'm sorry, Who are you?" 

Goldie smiled nervously as she cleared her throat. 

"My name is Valentina Combe... I'm sorry for prying but I used to know Mr Parson. I was going to meet him today and offer my condolences about his daughter but then I saw you with him." 

The woman shifted uncomfortably in her seat, she looked bothered. "Well, he's my boyfriend." She answered quickly. 

Goldie felt her chest tighten. 

"I sort of remember that he's married. Are you aware of that?"

The woman laughed, a sound that grated on Goldie's nerves. "Married? Oh, sweetie, Simon and I are together now. He's getting a divorce. It's all very complicated, you know."

Goldie's heart sank. She couldn't believe what she was hearing. Her father, the man she had looked up to her entire life, was leaving her mother for another woman. It felt like a betrayal beyond words.

Unable to contain her anger and devastation any longer, Goldie turned on her heel without another word and left the woman sitting there without an explanation. She felt tears welling up in her eyes as she walked away. She shouldn't have come. She shouldn't have come at all. 


.......


Rafael paced back and forth in his new apartment in the heart of Los Angeles. His eyes burned with a fiery determination as he plotted his revenge against Alpha Remington Albrecht  and his entire pack. Rafael vowed to take back what was rightfully his.

"Listen up, men," he said, addressing his loyal group of men. "Information reaching me tells me that the Silverback Pride is a founding pack. And Alpha Remington and his Silverback Pride are next in line to hold the mantle, and I won't let that happen."

His men nodded in agreement, their faces hidden stern just like their boss, they stood around him, they had been with Rafael through thick and thin, and they trusted him implicitly.

"He also seems to have some sort of connection with Valentina Combe, the woman I have been looking for over a year now. He will probably be the one to lead her to us, so it is important that we find out where he is and find their location."

"We've got a lead," one of his men chimed in, his voice laced with anticipation. "Word on the street is that Mr Albrecht closed a deal in Malibu a week ago, he has a follow up with the client coming up next week."

Rafael's lips curled into a wicked grin. "Excellent. We'll crash his little meeting and rough him up a bit, see what he knows."

"In the meantime, find out everything you can about his pack. But remember, our primary objective is to find Valentina Combe and bring her back to me."

His men nodded in agreement, their expressions fierce. 

The battle line had been drawn and Rafael was intent on winning.
###chapter 45 - His undoing 

Goldie had thought that things would be different when she got back to town. A part of her had imagined her parents, she had imagined them together, quietly handling their grief and trying to live their lives without her in it. But the thought that her parents were getting a divorce made her even more worse than she had felt, and the weight of that revelation hung heavily upon her heart.

She didn't see the specialist, she had made up an excuse to Remy when she got back to the hotel. She told him that her appointment was canceled. She didn't know if he saw through her lie or not, but Remy, being the supportive partner that he was, suggested a dinner date to lighten her spirits before they left the town. She had hesitated at first, bringing excuses that she didn't pack anything good to wear but the idea of some distraction and good company sounded appealing. Remy gave her his credit card and told her to go buy something that she could wear. She wanted to refuse, but he knew her too well, the thought of shopping alone was enough to convince her. 

So before their dinner date, Goldie decided to go dress shopping. She hoped that finding the perfect outfit would boost her mood, because shopping was always one of the only things that helped improve her mood. She entered a boutique in the Oak Creek mall, browsing through racks of dresses in search of something that would make her feel special. As she carefully examined each dress, her mind drifted back to the heart-wrenching news of her parents' impending divorce. Where did it all go eying?! 

She wondered how her mother would be feeling, even worse, she wondered how Nana would be taking her death. She wished that they would recognize her when she saw them, so they would know that she was alive, that they didn't need to mourn her anymore. 

Just as she was about to pick a dress, she noticed a mysterious woman nearby, her face hidden behind a rack of dresses. The woman's gaze was fixed on her, and she looked shocked, as if she had seen a ghost. She approached her  hesitantly and called out, "Valentina Combe?"

Goldie was taken aback. This was the first time someone had approached her and called her Valentina and from her understanding, Valentina didn't live in Oak Creek, so how would anybody in Oak Creek possibly  know Valentina? 

Confused, she replied, "Hello, do I know you from somewhere or anything?" 

The mysterious woman's eyes widened, she looked at her in confusion and she stammered, "You Valentina you don't remember me?" 
Before Goldie could inquire further or ask the woman who she was, the woman ran off, disappearing into the bustling crowd of the mall. 

Goldie stood there, bewildered and intrigued. Who was Valentina to this woman and why had this woman look so shocked to see her? The encounter left her with more questions than answers. She quickly purchased the dress she had chosen and hurried back to meet Remy, her mind still racing with curiosity. 

...... 

Goldie dressed up for dinner. It was a black dress, small and simple. She had managed to do a little bit of makeup too, Remy was waiting for her at the hotel lobby when she was done dressing up. 

"That is a beautiful dress." Remy commented as she walked towards him. Goldie smiled coyly as she did a little twirl for him. 

Remy couldn't take his eyes off her. 

"You look stunning." he breathed and she smiled again, enjoying his compliments. 

"And I'm glad that you ditched the T-shirts this time."

She said as she looked at him, not missing how fitted his clothes looked on him. 

He had also dressed up, he looked like a man right out of a GQ magazine, he wore dark grey pants and a blue long sleeved shirt that was tucked neatly into his pants. Even his hair was perfect, it was shiny and lustrous and Goldie noticed that it looked like he might have gotten a trim recently.

"So, where exactly are we going?" She asked and he shrugged. 

"I can't remember the name, but they make really good Italian food and they're one of the best restaurants in town, so let's give it a try." 

She nodded. 

"I like pasta, so I hope the food will be good." 

"It will, I looked up their reviews. I'm sure we'll have a swell time." 

He smiled warmly at her as they walked hand in hand to the car and drove to the restaurant . 





The restaurant was warm, cozy and it had a really dark ambiance. It's soft lighting and great music made the atmosphere perfect for a memorable night. Goldie already felt instantly at ease in the restaurant, her stress slowly ebbing away as she beheld the restaurant and her nostrils got filled with the smell of good food. 

As they sat across from each other, sipping the wine given to them as they looked at their menu , Remy couldn't help but steal glances at her, his heart pounding widely in his chest. He took a deep breath and finally found the courage to speak the words that he had been struggling to say all day. 

"Valentina," he began, his voice trembling slightly. "There's something I've been meaning to tell you."

Goldie looked into Remy's eyes, her curiosity piqued. "What is it, Remy?"

"These last few day I spend with you, it's been the happiest i've been with you in a long time and I cannot deny how much I've come to care about you."

He continued, "I think in a way, you losing your memories has brought us closer than we've ever been, it made me feel the mating bond between us strongly and I think I'm falling for you, Valentina. Your smile, your laughter, everything about you and I just can't stop thinking about you, even when you do stupid things like running away."

Goldie felt a mixture of emotions flood over her, she couldn't help but hide her surprise at Remy's words. She shifted nervously in her seat. She couldn't deny that she cared deeply for Remy, but there was a lot that she hadn't shared with him. There was a lot she wasn't telling him and she wondered how he would feel if he ever found out about them. If he would ever even be able to look at her if he knew she was someone else.  She sighed, her gaze dropping to her wine. 

"Remy, I need to tell you something, something that bothers me a lot." 

Remy's brow furrowed in concern. "What is it, Valentina?"

Taking a deep breath, she looked up.  "I know I'm a different person ever since I lost my memories, all everybody has done is point it out. And while I desperately want to get them back to grasp who I truly am, I am scared that when they come back, I might be back to my former self."

"And I wouldn't want to hurt you when I'm back to that, I wouldn't want to do anything to make you sad."

Remy reached across the table and gently took her hand in his. "I know I've thought about that every day. How it scares me to think about what would happen when you finally recover your memories." 

"But I want you to know that you're not alone in this. We'll face whatever comes together. And as for your memories, when they come back, we'll deal with that. We'll deal with all of that together." 

Tears welled up in her eyes. She felt guilty, she felt dishonest. She shouldn't lie to him, but she had no other option. "Thank you, Remy."

Remy leaned closer, his heart pounding as he whispered, "Let's not worry about the past or the future right now. Let's just cherish the moment and enjoy the time we have together."

Goldie nodded. 

Yes. That was what she would do. 

While the thought of Valentina lingered in her mind, she would push it back in the meantime and enjoy her time with Remy. 

She liked Remy. 

She liked him a lot and she couldn't deny it to herself. 

Whatever time they had together, she would cherish it. She would spend it with him. 

And more importantly, she would give him a chance.

Maybe this was life's way of giving her a second chance. A second chance at love. 

A chance to finally experience love with someone she liked and she was falling for.

She would take the chance.

Remington Albrecht was worth it. 

Dinner ended an hour later, the two of them made way back to their hotel. They had a good time. Not good, they had a swell time. It had done well to lift her moods, despite everything else still lingering in the back of her mind.

"Thank you for a good time tonight. It means more to me than you know." 

She murmured as she stood in front of their hotel room.

Remy smirked. 

"And I'll thank you for the wonderful company. Did I tell you that you looked absolutely gorgeous tonight?"

Goldie rolled her eyes.

"Many times." 

She murmured as she looked away, his eyes were on her face and she felt hot all over. The way he was looking at her with those seductive amber eyes, she couldn't take it. 

Their faces drew nearer, and without hesitation 

Goldie's breath hitched, Remy's eyes lingered on her lips. Goldie bit her lips nervously and that was his undoing.
###chapter 46 - Let me tell you a secret. 

Remy's phone rang, interrupting the moment they were having. Goldie walked into her room and dropped her purse. With a sigh, Remy picked up the call, his face turning from delight to concern as he listened intently. Goldie looked up as she noticed his expression changing, it looked like all the colour had drained from his face. 

"What's wrong, Remy?" Goldie asked, her eyes filled with worry.

Remy looked at her, his voice heavy with concern. "It's my mother. She had a really bad accident while running, and she's really hurt."

"I should go to her."

Remy murmured as he started to call for the waiter. 

Goldie immediately grabbed his hand and squeezed it reassuringly. "I'll come with you. We should leave now." 

Remy hesitated, his mind racing. "But what about your specialist appointment? You don't have to come with me, you can stay behind while I leave."

"I'll understand."  He added. 

Goldie smiled warmly, but she had no plans to leave Remy alone. "I can always make another one. But family comes first. Let's go to your mom."

With gratitude in his eyes, Remy nodded. They hastily gathered their things as they made a move to leave the hotel as soon as possible. Remy mentioned something about booking a flight and Goldie booked it for them, they raced to the airport. 

Her heart was racing as she silently hoped and prayed that Ellen was fine. Even though Remy wasn't saying much, she could see the worry on his face, the way he constantly lost awareness of his surroundings, he was worried about his mother. It wasn't hard to see. 

They had to get to Ellen, fast too. 

She just hoped that whatever illness Ellen had, she was able to heal easily. 

.... 

Lily Parson carefully arranged the pillows on Nana's bed, fluffing them just the way Nana liked. Her mother had moved in a few days ago and she was relieved about the company. With her mother around needing her help, she had little time to think about her divorce. She glanced at her mother, who sat in a sofa next to the window. There was a framed photograph of Goldie in her hand. It was a photo of Goldie when she was around seven or eight. She had just lost a tooth or two then so she had a big toothy grin. Nana was looking at the picture with a small smile on her face. The room was filled with the soft, golden glow of the setting sun.

As she turned to leave the room to prepare dinner, Nana's voice, sober and worrisome, called her back. "Lily, my darling, can you stay here for a little while?" 

Lily furrowed her brow, sensing that something was different today. She walked over to her mother, wondering why she had been awfully quiet lately. Ever since she had moved to her place, she would sit in front of the window in her room to watch the sunset or go to Goldie's room and nap in her bed. Lily had assumed it had something to do with Goldie, but as time went on, she suspected that it was something more. Especially with the long secretive phone calls her mother was constantly making to her sister Camilla and her husband Greg.

"What is it, Mom?"

Nana took a deep breath, her eyes filled with the weight of a long-held secret. "There's something I've been keeping from you, Lily, something I believe you should know." She paused, her voice shaking.

Lily's heart skipped a beat. She was right after all, something had been deeply bothering her mother, for a long time too. 

"What are you talking about? What is going on?"

Nana reached out and took Lily's hand. Her hand was small in hers, there was a deep contrast between their hands, showing the difference in age. Nana's wrinkly pale hands compared to Lily's slim manicured hands. "I need you to listen, my dear. Listen and listen carefully to all I have to say. It's about your daughter."

Lily's face turned ashen. Her heart skipped a beat as she waited for the inevitable. When her mother had stopped mentioning the fact that Goldie was alive and her spirit was hovering around, she had been relieved, thinking that her mother had finally come to terms with Goldie's death. But the seriousness in her mother's voice told her a different story. That perhaps her mother hadn't really come to terms with the death of her grandchild.  And her eyes filled with tears in anticipation of the words that were to come out of her mother's mouth. 

"If you're going to tell me again that she's alive, I don't want to hear it. Goldie is dead. Just accept it like we all have." 

Nana's grip on Lily's hand tightened, and she looked into her eyes with unwavering determination. The steeliness and confidence in her gaze made Lily pause for a moment to hear what she had to say. "No, Lily, she's not gone. If you would just please, please listen to what I have to say maybe, just maybe we can save her before it's too late." 

Lily shook her head, still not convinced, but confused as to why her mother felt so strongly about the issue. And why she believed that Goldie needed 'saving' This wasn't the first time she had said such and she had a feeling it wasn't going to be the last. 
 
 "Once. Just this once, I will listen to you" she agreed. 

Nana leaned closer and spoke in a hushed tone. "Listen, my dear. I've never shared this with you before, but it's the truth. And I shouldn't have taken so long to tell you, but I feared you wouldn't believe me."

"But I really have no choice anymore. I cannot keep shielding you from the truth, you have to know. Fourteen years ago when Goldie came to spend an Easter  holiday with me when you and Simon were in Aspen. There was a little accident with her"

Lily racked her head as she tried to remember the memory her mother was talking about.  Then she remembered,  she did, it was fourteen years ago. 

"She fell really badly, she had no bruises but she wouldn't wake up. The doctor said there was nothing wrong with her, but she wouldn't wake up I was so scared.."

"You called me. You called me that day." Lily remembered and her mother nodded. She remembered when her mother had called and told her that she was in the hospital with Goldie who wouldn't wake up. Lily had almost died of anxiety. They tried to leave immediately, but bad weather had stopped them and their flight was delayed for hours on end. 

"Yes! I did. I was so scared. But then, there was this nurse. She was really powerful and wise.  She was the one who told me that there was something else wrong with Goldie and her soul was wandering around. She helped me, Lily. She helped me recover Goldie's soul back into her body."

Lily's disbelief turned to shock as she gazed at her mother, hanging on every word. "Mom, you're telling me that Goldie had somehow...left her body, and this witch nurse helped her return?"

Nana nodded, tears welling in her eyes. "Yes, darling. I just didn't know what to do but that nurse, she had powers beyond my understanding and I'm glad I put aside my pride and reservations and just trusted her. She performed a spell with some ancient bells and Goldie came back to her body. She was the one who gave Goldie that amulet, the one I tell her to never take off." 

Lily sat down on the bed, as the memory of it all started coming to her. When they could finally leave Aspen, they arrived to meet a healthy Goldie, who didn't even have any memory of the accident ever happening. And there was a golden amulet around her neck, her mother had lied to her that a nun had given it to Goldie for protection. Goldie loved it so much she never took it off. 

"Goldie never took it off when she was younger.  She would wear it all the time"

Lily muttered. 

Nana nodded. 

"I made her promise every time I saw her never to take it off. I kept in touch with the witch over the years. She was the one who introduced me to the faith." 

"What's the faith?"

Lily asked and Nana sighed.

"We'll get to all that it's a very long story." 

Lily's mind reeled as she struggled to comprehend the incredible story. She wiped away her tears and held Nana's hand tightly, still wondering if she could ever believe the words that came out of her mother's mouth.

She looked up at her mother, heaving a heavy sigh.

"So you're saying Goldie is not dead?"

Nana raised her hand, the amulet was in it. Lily reached for it and held it in her hands. How often had she seen this amulet on her daughter's neck and not know what it really was for? 
She remembered when Goldie would take it off, claiming it didn't match her outfit and leave it on the dresser. 
Nana would see her without it and throw a huge fit, Goldie then started wearing it regularly again, because she claimed it gave her good luck sometimes. But she would still take it off on some days she didn't want to wear it. 

"She wasn't wearing the amulet when she had the accident. This means her soul wasn't tethered to her body."

"She is alive Lily."
###chapter 47 -Colonel Sandeds

Goldie and Remy stood in hushed concern beside Ellen's bed, watching as the healer examined her. They had managed to arrive in time, but the report was still more or less the same. Ellen's body had healed, but she was still very weak. Ellen lay pale and still on the large bed, her breaths shallow and weak. Her flowery room was filled with the sterile scent of herbs and the sound of the healer talking. 

Goldie couldn't really remember his name, but she knew he was the one who treated her the last time after she had fainted after the lunathion ritual. 

The healer, an elderly man with a kind face and steady hands, finally broke the silence. "She has lost a substantial amount of blood from the deep gash in her side." he explained gravely. "Her body healed too slowly after the fall because she was knocked unconscious, so the blood loss was a lot."

Remy nodded, his brow furrowed in worry. 

"I heard. Does she need medical attention or will she heal slowly on her own?"

The healer studied Ellen for a moment before responding. "I suggest speeding up her healing process. She needs a transfusion to replenish her blood supply quickly. I suggest taking her to the hospital for a sterile blood transfer."

Remy nodded again. "We'll get her there as soon as possible."

The healer nodded. 

"I'll prepare some of our men to carry her to the car. You can take some of her essentials along with you." 

"Let me help." 

Goldie murmured as she stood up looking at the healer. 

"Her closet is right there. Just pick a few things you know she'd need for an overnight stay." 

Remy murmured, barely tearing his eyes away from his mother. 

Goldie moved swiftly to pack Ellen's things. Remy watched her as she moved quickly. He didn't ask for her help, yet she had willingly offered it, all through the ride home she had been just as worried as he was, but she managed to comfort him and even tried to get his mind off it. He was a little surprised by how quickly she had sprung into action, but he was very grateful." 

After a while she came out of the closet with a bag. 

"Remy, I'll go with you. Do you need anything? I can help you pack too."

Remy smiled gratefully at Goldie, appreciating her help.  "Thank you. I'll take her to the car." He turned back to the healer. "We'll be back soon."

Together, they also went to pack their bags. Goldie had selected warm blankets, water, and some food, as well as a change of clothes for Ellen. For herself, she selected a change of clothes and some toiletries.

As they finished packing, Kale came in to check on them, Remy gave him a brief update. 

"We'll be praying for her quick recovery." 

Remy nodded.

"Thank you. I want you to stay and take charge. We'll be back tomorrow." 

Kale nodded in agreement, a determined glint in his eyes. "Your mother is strong. She'll be well in no time." 

Remy didn't comment on that, he only nodded and walked away. One could tell he was still very worried about his mother. 

Kale on the other hand turned to Goldie, a smile on his face. 

"Valentina please take care of him. I know he acts all tough and strong but he's really very anxious." 

Goldie nodded.

"I will. Don't worry."

With the bags  in their hand,  Remy and Goldie left Ellen's room, ready to go to the hospital. 

...........

Remy mentioned that they weren't going to a regular hospital.  It was private hospital with a reputation for treating werewolves like Remy and apparently the owner of the hospital was also a member of Remy's pack. The sun had already set, and the moon was on the rise, casting an eerie glow over the building.

 The doctor and owner of the hospital was the first person to welcome them. He was waiting outside the hospital with his staff who helped him wheel Ellen into the hospital. 

"Alpha."

The doctor greeted as he bowed a little. Goldie watched in fascination as the man bowed to Remy. The word Alpha on his lips sounded like a worship, a deep reverence. 

"I heard about the situation. We've prepped her for a blood transfusion. Will you be the donor?"

The doctor asked and Remy nodded. 

"I will. This is my Luna Valentina." 

He looked at Goldie. The doctor's eyes travelled to her and she could see the admiration that shone in his eyes. 

"Luna!" 

The man exclaimed as he rushed towards her, his hands outstretched to touch hers. 

"My name is Dr Daniel Brooke. I'm a loyal pack member. I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to meet, I work late nights so work keeps me away from pack meetings."

Goldie smiled warmly.

"It's alright Dr Brooke. It's nice to meet you." 

The doctor nodded and turned to Remy. 

"Let's prep you for the procedure. We have all the time to catch up later." 

The doctor said as he ushered them in. In the hospital, Remy was led to the private theatre immediately, with Ellen in tow. 

While Remy and Ellen preoccupied, Goldie decided to venture down the hospital hallway in search of some much-needed coffee. They would run some tests before starting to transfusion, she didn't know how long it would take but she decided it was best to get some coffee. So she could stay awake. 

She didn't get any sleep on the plane, she was too worried, Remy also didn't get enough sleep, his eyes were open the whole time even though it was a short flight. They had arrived home and gone back on the road again.

She was tired. 

The aroma of fresh brew led her to the hospital cafeteria, where she hoped to find a hot cup of strong coffee.

She saw the coffee machine from afar and was venturing towards it when she saw a familiar face. 

Colin?! 

Her heart skipped a beat. She looked around and looked at him again to be sure that he was the one. He was, he was standing right in front of the coffee machine, his eyes at that faraway look in his eyes. He was dressed in a dark blue suit, he looked like he had just got off work. He was still staring far away. 

Goldie took a deep breath before approaching him. She knew it was the worst possible timing, but Colin was her friend, they were once the best of friends. And she missed him.

Their eyes met as she stood in front of the coffee machine and Colin gave her a short smile. 

He looked at her again, as if he recognised her.

"Hey. It's you!"

He said. Oh his voice, Goldie blinked away tears, hard tears. Don't cry, don't cry. She told herself as she managed a smile.

"You gave up your spot so I could see the doctor before you in Oak Creek. Valentina right?"

He remembered her, but not as Goldie. He would never remember her as Goldie, not even she was wearing someone else's face. Goldie returned his greeting. "Colin Lockwood right? What brings you here?"

Colin took a sip of his coffee before responding, "Remember those nightmares I used to have? Well there's a specialist here who can help me with my nightmares... I made an appointment and decided to come see him."

Goldie nodded, recalling the conversation they had shared that time at the cafe. He was having nightmares, about her. At least that was what he told her.  She wondered if anyone else close to her was suffering the same fate, forever tormented by dreams of her. She herself suffered from the same nightmares. The real Valentina it seemed, had no plans of leaving her alone. 

"And was he helpful?"

Colin's expression dimmed. "Actually, I haven't seen him yet, but I'm optimistic. He came highly recommended so I wanted to see him."

Goldie felt deeply for Colin. She could only imagine what he was going through, having to deal with nightmares every night.  

"I don't mean to pry, but is it still the same nightmare? The one with your friend Goldie?"

Colin nodded. 

"Yes. Every night I see her... it's the same thing I guess."  

Goldie just couldn't understand. Why was Colin having nightmares about her?! 

Was it because a part of him suspected that she was still alive?! 

"Colin... can I talk to you?"

She asked and he looked a bit confused before nodding.

"Yea sure. Let's find a seat."

He led her to the closest table and chair, Goldie sat facing him, her hands shaking in anxiety. 

What she was about to tell him, there was only one way he would take it. 

He could either believe her, or tell her to fuck off. 

She took a deep breath and told him a memory that only the two of them shared. 

"It happened around late July, five years ago. We were in my room, we just settled after having a huge fight about you going to MIT and me going to UCLA."

Colin leaned forward, his brow furrowing in confusion.

"What are you talking about?!"

He murmured.

"I tried to beg you to stay, you said you wanted to go for away since I wasn't sure I would ever feel the same way you felt for me..."

"Valentina..."

Goldie continued, tears blurring her vision. 

"Someone called you, you said it was your mother, you stood up to leave and I stood up and pulled you closer. I kissed you..."

There was a morbid silence as Goldie looked at Colin's face pale face, searching his eyes for any emotion, any emotion at all. 

"How do you know that??"

He murmured. 

"You pulled away first, then you asked me if I loved you. I didn't reply to that, you waited for me to reply... I didn't even know what to say..."

"I asked you again. You didn't reply, I opened the door and left." 

Colin finished.

Goldie nodded, tears blurring her vision. 

"How do you know that?"

He asked for the second time.

Goldie smiled. I remembered the nickname I used to call him when we were much younger, Colonel Sanders. It was my personal nickname for him all through middle school. He hated it, but I loved it, I only stopped when we reached high school. 

"Isn't it obvious Colonel Sanders?!"
###chapter 48 - A lot to say 


Colin sat in the hospital cafeteria, his mind weighed down by the impossible truth he'd just been confronted with. Goldie had told him everything, everything from the beginning to the end. He didn't interrupt her once. He didn't ask her any questions, even when she knew things only Goldie would know. Even though she knew things about him no one else knew, he didn't say one word. He just sat there and listened as she poured out her heart. What she had said, all she had said shook him to his core. 

And he wasn't sure he could even comprehend or understand it. As he searched her face, the baby blue eyes, the short black hair, all the ways in which she was different from his own Goldie, he couldn't understand. How could it be his own Goldie? 

How could Goldie still be alive?!

For a second he had wondered if he was dreaming again and punched himself to know if it was real, but it was. The woman in front of him was claiming to be Goldie. 

"Colin, I don't know how it happened... or what happened, but somehow I'm still alive in this body," she said softly, her eyes filled with earnest sincerity. "I'll give you all the time you need to accept it."

He looked at her, searching for any sign of deception. Magic?! Could it be magic?! Was she a sightseer?! Some sort of liar? He didn't even know how to describe what was happening.

Goldie reached into her bag and pulled out a piece of paper. She scribbled down her phone number and slid it across the table. "Call me when you're ready to accept the truth, Colin."

Colin's head was spinning. He needed time to process this revelation, to reconcile with everything that she had said. He pocketed the number and nodded, his voice shaky. "I'll...I'll need some time."

......

Remy walked into the hospital cafeteria. The procedure had been faster than he had thought and although he was feeling a little dizzy, he still wondered where Valentina was. He scanned the hospital hallways for Goldie, till a nice nurse told him she was in the cafeteria. He had been searching for her, desperate to thank her for her help. She had offered to go with him when she didn't need to, she could have stayed home instead and let him handle it, but she wanted to go, all by herself too. 

When Remy spotted Goldie, his heart sank. She was sitting with a man. The man was of average build, he was wearing a dark blue suit, he had short dark blond hair and he was staring at her with an expression he didn't understand. She was seated across from him, Remy could still see her from the side. She was talking to the man, it looked like tears were streaming down her face, but she didn't mind them, she just kept talking and crying. He tried to listen in on their conversation, but he was too weak, the pints of blood he had given still  made him very weak, he shouldn't have left his temporary bed, but he had left his bed to find her. The man's eyes never left her face, almost as if he was in some sort of trance. 

Remy felt like he was interrupting a very private conversation, but he couldn't help but wonder who the man was. Or why his  presence seemed to sting him so much. Remy didn't say a word; he only frowned, the disappointment and hurt clear in his eyes. She must have recovered her memories and from the looks of things, she must have recovered it a while ago for her to know the man she was speaking to so passionately. 

Perhaps he was her lover, perhaps that was Valentina's big secret. A lover that she had hid from him. Remy felt stupid. Stupid for pouring out his feelings during that dinner. 

He turned and left the cafeteria without uttering a single word.

...... 

Marielle anxiously clutched her phone, her heart racing as she picked Madame Eloise's call. The witch had called her out of the blues and she wondered why the witch had called her. Nothing about their last conversation suggested that the woman would call her back, so she was curious this time. Perhaps the witch had decided to give her more information, seeing as it would benefit her greatly. The phone rang, and she took a deep breath before answering. "Madame Eloise?" 

A raspy voice on the other end replied, "Marielle Mason right? it's been a while, hasn't it?"

Marielle scoffed. "Yes, Madame Eloise. I'm a little surprised seeing as you called me. What can I do for you?" 

The witch's voice was laced with an air of mystery. "You once mentioned that you have access to Valentina. Well I need to reach her."

Marielle knew better than to make promises lightly, especially to a seasoned witch like Madame Eloise. But this was an opportunity that she couldn't let go, she could find out what was between Madame Eloise and Valentina had discussed about.

She could find out more about the concealment spell that Valentina was paying for and what it was for. If she played her part well, she could get all the information she needed. Gathering her courage, she said, "I can help you, but you will have to help me in return." 

"What is the concealment spell for? You mentioned that Valentina employed your services for a concealment spell, but you never mentioned what or who it was for." 

Madame Eloise let out a sinister chuckle, "My dear, we've been through this. I cannot divulge such information to you. Client confidentiality is very important to me. Since you're so close to Valentina, why don't you ask her yourself!"

Marielle refused to back down. "Valentina is too secretive for her own good and my alpha is concerned about her. If you don't help me, I'm afraid I won't help you either." 

"... that is unless you tell me the purpose of that concealment spell Valentina asked you for."

The witch's voice turned icy. "You're very persistent Marielle. But I will tell you once again, I cannot divulge such information to you." 

"Then you'd have to forget about contacting Valentina, because if she hasn't reached out to you now, it's obvious she's no longer interested in your services." 

There was a long pause on the other end of the line, Marielle feared that the witch had probably ended the call. Perhaps she had gone too far, bluffed too much. She had no way of knowing if Valentina was still involved with the witch after her memory loss. Truthfully, there was a lot of things that came out of Valentina's mouth lately that Marielle found particularly hard to believe. 

"I cannot divulge anything of note to you. But I can tell you that the concealment spell is for a person. Valentina is hiding someone, someone very important to her." 

Someone very important to her?! 

"That's incredibly vague."

Marielle complained. She didn't even know anyone related to Valentina, had never seen her with friends or family of her own, how was she supposed to know who was important to her?! 

The information didn't help at all, it just got her very confused. 

"Well I've done my part. It's time for you to do yours."

Marielle weighed her options. Despite what she had said earlier, she had no intention of giving Madame Eloise Valentina's contact, but she was curious about how it would all play out. So she decided to.

"Fine, I'll help you, but only this once."

Madame Eloise replied. 

"Very well, for your sake I hope I'm able to reach her, because I'm expecting payment for the concealment spell for the next month."

Marielle felt the weight of her promise bearing down on her, and decided to let Madame Eloise know that she couldn't make any promises. 

"I cannot guarantee anything. I can only provide you with her contact and hope that you reach her. She's not an easy person to get a hold of."

"But I wish you good luck Madame Eloise."

With that, she angrily hung up the call. She would have to call Kale and let him know. It was also time for her to tell Remy, time for her to tell him the truth of what she had found out about his Luna. 

She looked at her phone again and forwarded Valentina's  contact to the witch. Then she called Remy, she had to tell him. 

Remy picked up the call on the second ring. 

"My mother's fine. She's out of the woods. We should be back in a few hours."

 Marielle felt bad for not calling about that. She had almost forgotten that Ellen had been rushed to the hospital. 

"That's good to hear. I need to tell you something... it's about Valentina." 

There was a short pause, then Remy grunted. 

"Wait till I get home, we have a lot about Valentina to talk about."
###chapter 49 - Without the baggage 


Goldie and Remy were returning from the hospital with a strong and healthy Ellen. After the blood transfusion, she became energetic and strong again, almost as if nothing happened to her. 

She talked animatedly after the procedure, telling Goldie that she was happy she had come with her and sorry for scaring them so badly. 
Dr Brooke persuaded them to stay the night just for observation and they agreed. There were private rooms for them in the building so Goldie was given a room. Remy retired to bed much later than she did because he was catching up with Dr Brooke. She didn't see him after the blood transfusion and one of the nurse told her that he was weak and he was likely resting. 

The next morning, they had dressed up and left very early, eager to get back home. Goldie was so drained from the day's events that she had slept off during the ride home. It was only when they arrived home that she finally woke up. 

As the car pulled into the driveway, she could already see a few of the pack members she recognised waiting outside to welcome Ellen. 

"Welcome back!" 

Kale was the first person to greet Ellen, his arms outstretched to give her a huge hug. 

"Thank you! Oh you all didn't have to come out like this!"

Ellen complained. 

"It's the least we could do!" 

One of them called out. 

Goldie busied herself with getting her carry on bag out of the car, a staff rushed to take it from her. 

"Let me help you with that."

The staff offered.

"Thank you." 

They retreated inside, all of them talking animatedly and joyously. Goldie went upstairs to her room, eager to take a much needed shower and freshen up for later. 

The chef had mentioned that he had prepared a special lunch in honour of Ellen to celebrate her good health and return. Goldie was hoping she would at least have time to nap a little before it all happened. 

As Goldie excused herself to go upstairs and freshen up, she noticed Remy's cold and withdrawn demeanor. Something was amiss, and she couldn't ignore it. He had been like that last night too, after the blood transfusion. She had assumed that it probably just had something to do with the fact that he was tired after the procedure but the more she looked at him, the more she was convinced that it was something else. 

In the privacy of their bedroom, Goldie couldn't hold back her concern any longer. "Remy," she began, "how do you feel? Are you still weak?"

"No. I'm fine." 

Remy replied coldly, he didn't even look at her, he just removed his watch and walked into the closet. 

Goldie continued. 

"But is everything okay? You've been so quiet since we left the hospital and I didn't even get a chance to check up on you yesterday after your procedure, the nurse said you had to rest." 

Remy didn't face her, his expression was still distant, she could hear him sigh. "I'm just tired, Valentina. It's been a long and draining day."

Goldie searched his eyes for the truth, sensing that there was more to his unease. "Are you sure that's all it is? Is this about your mom?"

Remy  didn't reply. Goldie continued, pressing him further. 

"Did I do something to upset you? This is very unlike you." 

Remy hesitated, torn between his desire to share and his reluctance to tell her what he had found out. How was he going to tell her that he found her talking to another man who she was supposed to have no memory of unless she had recovered her memories? Finally, he turned to look at her, "I'm going to my study. I need some space."

"Space?" 

Goldie repeated. 

"From me?" She asked and Remy shrugged. 
What was going on with him? This was very unlike him. 

"Whatever it is, I'm here for you, Remy. We'll get through this together. You don't have to carry it all on your own."

For a moment, Remy's icy facade began to thaw, and he gave her a faint smile. "Thank you, Valentina. I appreciate that." He glanced at her again and he left the room, his steps echoing in the corridor.

Alone in the room, Goldie picked up her phone and looked through it. Not one call from Colin so far, he was probably still having a very hard time accepting what she had told him. She wondered if he would ever call her. Perhaps she had made a mistake telling him, but she couldn't help herself, it felt good telling someone. 

It felt good getting it all out of her chest. She didn't know if Colin would ever believe her, but at least she knew she tried. 


............ 

Remy walked into his study, his head still replaying the moment in the hospital cafeteria, where he had sought Valentina out and found her with another man. He should have asked her about it when she asked him what was wrong earlier, but he wanted to wait a little to see what Marielle had uncovered. 

Kale walked in moments later, his phone in his hand. 

"Marielle's on the line. She wanted to speak to you."

Remy nodded.

"Hello?"

"Remy, you won't believe what I've discovered," Marielle began, her voice laden with worry. Remy listened intently and Marielle  went on to explain how in the process of trying to find out more about Valentina, she got the contact of a witch who Valentina had been seeing for months. The witch, Madame Eloise had last contacted Valentina two months ago and was wondering if their deal was still on. The witch had reached out to Marielle again to get her contact. 

Remy furrowed his brow, puzzled. "Why on earth would Valentina be mixed up with a witch?  What does the witch have to do with her?"

Marielle hesitated before responding, her voice dropping to a whisper, "Madame Eloise claims there's something very important to Valentina that she's been hiding. This is more information about Valentina than we have ever learned, apparently she's been in contact with the witch for a long time now. I think when she lost her memories, they lost contact with each other." 

As Remy pondered the mysterious connection, he suddenly remembered the moment at the hospital.  "I think she might have regained her memories, Marielle. I saw her at the cafeteria, talking with a man. They seemed very familiar, especially with the way they were talking."

"I just don't understand why she wouldn't tell us if she has regained her memory." 

Marielle's mind raced as she considered the implications of Remy's observation. "If she's remembering and she's not telling you, then we need to be cautious. You know how Valentina was before the accident, she was very secretive, she could be going back to that." 

Remy and Kale shared a look, Kale shrugged, he seemed to share the same sentiments with Marielle. 

"She's right Remy. If the old Valentina is back, then she's probably hiding something from you again." 

With a heavy sigh, Marielle ventured further, "Remy, I know this is a very weird question to ask, but do you like Valentina? I know since she lost her memories, the two of you have been somewhat closer, whatever's between you now, it's not the same as before." 

Remy hesitated for a moment, his heart heavy with conflicting emotions. "It's impossible not to. We grew much closer when she came back. It's like she became a whole new person and now I'm wondering if I've made a mistake all along..."

Remy sighed.

"With the old Valentina it was easier for me not like her in that way. She made it very hard to like her. She didn't even try to like me, she didn't make an effort to even care...."

Marielle's words grew even more serious, "Well, now that we think she might have her memories I believe she knows she can use them to her advantage. Valentina will use your love against you, Remy. We have to be careful. Whatever is going on might be more complex than we thought."

Remy knew that Marielle was right. His relationship with Valentina was entangled in a web of secrets, memories, and potentially dangerous alliances. But when she lost her memories, there was a glimmer of hope, there was a chance between them that he had never seen before, a chance for them to be together. Valentina without all her baggage and whatever secrets she was holding on to was a joy to be around, when she wasn't trying to run away from him. And these past few days with her Remy had grown so close to her that he couldn't help but confess how he truly felt about her to her,  believing that there was a chance they could be together. 

It was hopeless for him to dream, yet he dreamed anyways. 

"Can you connect me to the witch? I need to talk to her, maybe she would be able tell me who Valentina is hiding."
###chapter 50 - A lone bar 

Goldie was a little late for lunch. That was because she had napped a little longer than she had expected to. But she went downstairs as fast as she could. 

"Oh Valentina you're here. I was beginning to worry about you." 

Ellen said as she looked up from her food, a large smile on her face. She patted the seat next to her and Goldie joined her and sat next to her. 

She looked round the table and found Remy sitting at the end of the table, he didn't look up from his food. He didn't even acknowledge that she had come in. 

"I wouldn't miss it. How are you feeling?" 

She asked Ellen and Ellen smiled. 

"I feel much better now that I'm back home. It's almost as if nothing ever happened."

"You had us all worried, but I'm glad you're fine now." 

Goldie said as she held her fork. The table was already set, there was chicken, salad, gravy, greens and mashed potatoes. She would have her pick. 

"Valentina how are you doing? I noticed we haven't had the chance to talk in a while." 

Kale asked and Goldie looked up at him, surprised by his statement. They barely talked, the two of them. In fact, if there was one person she was the least close to in the pack, it would be Kale. 

"We don't really do much talking."

She said and Kale nodded.

"You're right. That could change." 

She doubted that. But he could try if he wanted. What was there to talk about in the first place? She had more luck talking with Ellen or Marielle than Kale. 

"Remy said you went to see the specialist. How are your memories coming up? Remember anything yet?"

He asked and Goldie glanced at Remy, he had paused, even though he was looking down athis food. Was he waiting for her answer? Goldie shrugged. 

"I didn't get to see the specialist. And no, I don't remember anything. Nothing so far." 

Remy's eyes shot up to hers. There it was, how did he miss it? She had lied. Her heartbeat had skipped. He never thought of listening to it because for a while now he didn't think there was ever any reason for her to lie. But she had lied and he had caught her. 

Kale exchanged glances with Remy. Their glances held the confirmation that they needed. She was lying to them. Goldie was oblivious to everything that was going on between Remy and Kale and their silent conversation, she was about to take a sip of her water when her phone rang. She picked it up and looked at it.

Her eyes widened as she saw the number. She knew that number from anywhere, she had it memorized. Just like how she had her number and her parents' numbers memorized, she would recognize Colin's number anywhere. 

"Excuse me."

She murmured to nobody in particular as she stood up from the table and rushed out of the dining room. 

"Colin?!"

She murmured as she got outside. Her heart was beating really fast, she wondered if he believed her, if he did, or if he was calling her for another reason. 

"Goldie?!"

Goldie. He called her Goldie, she sighed in relief. He believed her. 

"Yes? Yes it's me." She said as she let out a sob, tears almost streaming down her face. 

"Can we talk? Last night was the first night I slept through the night without a single nightmare. I think we need to talk."

"What are we going to do about this Goldie?"

"Where? Where do you want us to meet?"

She asked as she looked at the time on her phone, she could make it, even if it meant her having to drive the long way and going back into the city. 

"I'm still in LA, I don't know if you'll be able to make it or something but we could meet up somewhere closer to your place if you want." 

"Anywhere's fine with me, just, just give me an address and I'll be there."

"Okay. I'll send you an address."

Colin said as he finally hung up the call. 

Goldie sighed in relief as she ended the call. As she turned back to go into the house, she wondered what she was going to tell Remy. She didn't like lying to him, especially now since that he seemed to be giving her the cold shoulder. He was upset about something and she didn't know what it was yet. If she told him she was going to see a friend, then he would know that she had recovered her memories and that was a whole lot of things she couldn't explain, because they were her memories, not Valentina's. 

She would have to tell him the truth too soon, because she couldn't keep lying, it didn't work, it wouldn't work.

.........

Goldie sat nervously at the bar, her fingers tracing the rim of her glass, her thoughts racing. After her call with Colin, she had lied through her teeth again to Remy, telling him she needed to get some supplies, that her period was coming up and there was only one specific brand of sanitary product she liked using and she'd rather take the time to go get it herself. He agreed, in fact, he didn't seem to care that she was going out all alone. But he had suggested she went along with one of his pack members for protection. 

So a man named Michael drove her to town. Then she had told Michael to stop at the bar, that she wanted to say hello to a friend. Michael didn't seem to particularly care, he just did whatever she asked him to do. 

When Colin walked in, Goldie spotted him walking in, he was wearing a familiar green T-shirt and simple jean trousers. He took a seat beside her. The bar hummed with laughter and music, a stark contrast to the weight of the conversation they were about to have. 

"You still have that shirt..."

She murmured and Colin nodded. 

"You remember?"

"Of course I do." 

"How did you manage to come? When you told me where you lived and all, I assumed you wouldn't be able to come out and see me."

Goldie shrugged. 

"Remy is a reasonable man. I told him I was coming here to get some supplies that I can't find anywhere else and he didn't mind." 

Colin nodded, his face held no emotion. He signaled to the bartender for a drink. The bartender took his order. 

"So... when you called, I wasn't expecting your call. To be honest I didn't think you'd believe me..." 

She started. 

Colin cleared his throat. 

"You told me things only you would know... and I remembered the first day we met, something about you felt so familiar, especially the way you ate that croissant and maple syrup in that cafe..." 

"You didn't have your memories then right?"

He asked and she nodded in reply. 

"You didn't have them and yet you were so much like yourself. Sitting where you would normally sit and ordering what you'd normally order even when you had no memory of who you truly were."

Taking a deep breath, Goldie nodded her head. He was right, even back then she didn't remember who she was yet, yet her mannerisms and actions remained the same. 

After a moment of silence, he continued, "Goldie, I trust you and I've known you for years, I've seen you go through a lot of happy and sad moments in life, and I know you wouldn't make something like this up. But the question now is, how are we going to get you back into your own body?"

Goldie sighed, her relief palpable. "I wish I knew, Colin. I have no idea how to? I'm trapped in Valentina's life and I don't have a clue how to fix it or what to do, it is so frustrating!" 

Colin looked at her intently and then said, "I know you might not want to hear this, but maybe it's time to face Remy and tell him the truth."

Goldie shook her head.

"Would that work?! Will he even believe me?" 

"I don't know if he will but you're not his wife. You're not Valentina Combe and you can't keep pretending that you are." 

"What if I stay like this forever?! I've thought about this, the real Valentina is probably dead. What if I have to live as Valentina for the rest of my life?!" 

The bartender brought a coke for Colin. He and Goldie sat there for a while in complete silence, before Colin remembered something. 

"I just remembered something..."

"What?"

She asked. 

"Before I left, I ran into your Nana. She seemed to believe you were alive. She wouldn't stop repeating that you were alive." 

"She never believed for one second that you were dead." Colin added with confidence. 

Suddenly, Goldie's eyes lit up with a spark of realization. Of course! 

Nana! 

Her nana must have known something. 

"I remember something about Nana," she said, her voice trembling with a mix of emotions. "She gave me an amulet. She always said something cryptic about it, like it would protect me. She was always begging me never to take it off. But on the night I had the accident I took it off because it didn't fit the dress I wanted to wear. Maybe she knows something about this!"

Colin nodded thoughtfully, his mind racing. "That's it, Goldie. We should see her."

"If anyone can help you, I'm very sure it's her."
