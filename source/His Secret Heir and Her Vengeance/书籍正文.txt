###chapter 1: Is She The “Wife”？
********
Trapped in a sham marriage, Angela guards a dangerous secret: her billionaire husband’s child. When his legendary first love returns, she faces an ultimatum—abandon her baby or lose everything. But in this game of power and passion, the greatest threat might be the truth she hides… and the vengeance she craves.
********

Angela POV
Pregnant, six weeks.
I stared at the test results in my hands, the paper trembling slightly despite my best efforts to keep steady. 
I thought of that wild night.
His fingers curled into the delicate silk, and with one swift motion, the fabric tore.
He followed my collarbone down and kissed his way across my entire body. 
My body arched involuntarily, drawn into the inferno of him, my hands grasping at his shoulders, his hair...
"Congratulations, Mrs. Shaw," Dr.Morrison's warm voice cut through my daze. "The initial tests show everything is progressing normally."
I looked up at her, grateful for the familiar face who had been handling my annual check-ups since I started working at Shaw Group. 
"I... thank you, I wasn't expecting..."
"First-time mothers rarely are," she said kindly, pulling up my chart on her tablet. "We'll want to schedule regular prenatal check-ups. Is Mr. Shaw available to join us? We should discuss the care plan together."
"He's handling some urgent matters at the company," I replied automatically. 
The truth was, I hadn't even told him about today's appointment. 
"Of course, I understand. Wall Street waits for no one," Dr. Morrison nodded sympathetically. "But do make sure to bring him next time. There are several decisions you'll need to make together."
Together？
Sean and I hadn't made any real decisions together in the two years of our marriage. 
It had started as a business arrangement - a way to appease his grandmother's concerns about the family legacy - and had remained exactly that.
My phone buzzed, Sean's name lighting up the screen. For a moment, my heart leaped - had he somehow sensed the news? But the message was purely practical:
"I'm at Metropolitan Club for a meeting. Please bring me an umbrella."
I glanced at the darkening sky. The weather forecast had mentioned possible thunderstorms, and Sean never liked to be caught unprepared. 
I'm not just his wife-I'm also his secretary, and it's my job to handle any unexpected situations that come up.
I touched my still-flat stomach absently, wondering if this was the right moment to tell him. 
"To the Metropolis Club," I flagged down a cab and told the driver.
***
The first fat drops of rain began to fall as we pulled up to the club's entrance. I stepped out, clutching the umbrella, only to be stopped by the security guard's politely raised hand.
"I'm sorry, madam, but we have strict member-only access rules during business hours."
"I understand, but my husband Sean Shaw is inside. I just need to-"
"I'm sorry, but it's the rule-you can't go in." The security guard eyed me up and down, his tone laced with disdain. "Every day, plenty of people show up claiming to be Mr. Sean's girlfriend or wife. But just now, Mr. Sean already went in with his real wife."
I froze. What? His wife?
That's impossible. I took a deep breath and tried to explain to the guard that I was Sean's wife. The only wife. But he merely shrugged, indifferent.
Frustrated, I pulled out my phone and called Sean. The call was declined.
My heart clenched. I quickly typed out a message:
 "I brought you an umbrella. I'm at the club entrance."
Several minutes passed before his reply came:
"Meeting still ongoing. You can just head back."
My fingers hovered over the phone. 
"I need to tell you something important."
"We can discuss it at home."
The dismissal was clear.
I was angry and frustrated, but I forced myself to stay calm. He's in a meeting right now. A professional secretary wouldn't disturb him. 
Taking a deep breath, I turned to leave-only to freeze in my tracks.
A familiar figure caught my eye.
No way!
That fiery red hair, impossible to ignore. That tall, curvy silhouette. That dangerously tight dress.
Christina Jordan!
The sight of her was like a punch to the gut - she was supposed to be at Paris, not here, not now.
Then, I saw Sean step out-his hand wrapped around Christina's-as he led her into a room.
Is she the "wife" the security guard was talking about? 
Is this so-called "meeting" just an excuse to meet with Christina?
I was still trying to wrap my head around what I had just seen when two fashionable girls walked out of the club, talking loudly.
"I can't believe Christina's back!" one of them said. "I thought she'd stay in Paris."
"Of course she came back for Sean," 
"Their love story is so romantic!"
"Yeah, I just don't get it, Sean is so good-looking, why would he end up with the daughter of a bankrupt banker?"
The first girl laughed. "Exactly! Christina's way out of Angela's league. Just thinking about Angela's silly smile makes me lose my appetite."
...
The words hit like slaps. I took a step back, barely noticing that I'd moved out from under the shelter until the rain was soaking through my blazer.
I turned and walked away, the rain grew heavier, but I barely felt it. 
***
By the time I reached our apartment in the evening, I was soaked to the bone. 
James Morrison, our building's longtime manager, took one look at me and immediately sprang into action.
"Mrs. Shaw! Let me call Sarah to bring you some warm towels." He was already reaching for his phone. "And I'll have some hot tea sent up immediately."
"Thank you, James, but I'm fine." The words came out automatically, even as a shiver ran through me. "I just need to-"
"What the hell were you thinking?"
Sean's voice cut through the lobby like a whip crack. I turned to find him striding toward me, his face set in lines of anger I rarely saw directed at me.
"Walking in the rain without an umbrella?" He continued, his voice lowered but no less intense. "Have you completely lost your mind?"
I felt a lump form in my throat, the frustration rising fast. 
Wasn't I out here in the rain because of him? 
I'm carrying his child, running through the storm just to bring him an umbrella-and yet, behind my back, he's out there dating another woman.
When did Christina come back? How long had they been seeing each other in secret?
The thought twisted in my chest, but I couldn't even bring myself to confront him. I didn't have the right. 
In everyone's eyes, maybe Christina was the one who mattered. The one who was really his wife.
"I didn't realize you cared about my well-being," I said quietly.
Something flickered in his eyes - surprise, perhaps, at my uncharacteristic show of defiance. Then his jaw tightened, and he stepped forward, sliding an arm around my waist.
"You're freezing," he said flatly. "We need to get you warm."
I tried to step away, but he tightened his grip, practically lifting me off my feet as he guided me toward the elevator. 
"Sean, I need to tell you-" I started, but he cut me off.
To my surprise, he scooped me up in his arms.
###chapter 2: Get Out of My Clothes Or Get Out Of My Room?
Angela POV
"Whatever it is, it can wait until you're not at risk of pneumonia."
I stopped talking and stopped resisting, just lying quietly in his arms.
Just like the two girls at the club said, Sean was unbelievably handsome-strong, sexy, and easy to fall for. 
With his dark, wavy hair, olive-green eyes, and that classic Italian look, it was hard not to be drawn to him. His family had come to America from Italy generations ago.
Who wouldn't be captivated by him? Some of the younger women at the company even joined just because of him.
When Sean carried me into the bathroom, he immediately went to turn on the hot water. The steam began to fill the room, curling around us like a thick, warm mist.
As I started to unbutton my shirt, I noticed he was still standing there, watching me.
I paused, the soft sound of the water filling the silence between us. 
"Can you... can you leave?"
He didn't move. Instead, he leaned casually against the doorframe, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. 
"Get out of my clothes or get out of my room?" 
Heat rushed to my face.
"That's not funny!"
I pushed him out of the room, shutting the door behind him with a force I hadn't intended.
What the hell was he doing? A low laugh escaped my lips, cold and bitter. 
Just hours ago, he'd been with Christina at the club. And now, here he was, flirting with me like nothing had happened. 
What was I to him? A backup? A distraction? Something to pass the time with?
The pregnancy report was still in my blazer pocket, now wrinkled and damp. I pulled it out carefully, the paper threatening to tear under my shaking fingers. 
Six weeks. 
The words were starting to blur, whether from tears or water damage, I couldn't tell.
I couldn't help but think that, when I went to bring him the umbrella, Christina was probably upstairs, watching me through the floor-to-ceiling windows, laughing at me.
Thirty minutes later, I emerged from the bathroom wearing dry clothes.
Sean sat in the living room, his laptop open on the coffee table. A steaming cup of tea waited beside it.
"Drink this," he said without looking up. "It'll help prevent a cold."
"Thank you." I settled into the armchair across from him, wrapping my fingers around the warm cup. 
The familiar scent of ginger rose with the steam - he'd remembered my preferred tea for warding off illness.
I opened my mouth to speak, though I wasn't sure what I planned to say. 
Before I could decide, Sean closed his laptop and moved to stand in front of me.
"Are you mad at me?" Sean asked, his voice tense. "I asked you to bring the umbrella, but I didn't go down to see you. So, you purposely got soaked?"
I wanted to scream yes. I wanted to shout at him, to let him know how hurt I was. But in the end, I just pretended like it didn't matter.
"No," I said calmly. "I gave the umbrella to a pregnant woman who didn't have one. She needed it more than I did."
It was a lie. I didn't tell him about the pregnancy. And now, with Christina back, everything was more complicated than ever.
He stepped closer, wrapping his arms around my waist. His hot breath brushed against my face, and I realized I was only wearing a thin nightgown. 
Through the fabric, I could feel the hard muscles of his chest pressed against me,and the hard cock...
"Really?" he murmured, his eyes locked onto mine.
I lowered my gaze, unable to meet his stare. But then, he lifted my chin, and before I could react, his lips were on mine.
His kiss caught me completely off guard. 
"Don't. I'm not in the mood, Sean."
"I know you're pissed," he murmured, tugging it loose despite my weak grip. It fell to the floor, leaving me bare-my skin prickling, my breasts heavy under his gaze, the soft patch between my thighs suddenly too exposed.
"Let me make it up to you"
"Sean, I said no," I snapped, but my voice wavered as his hands found my waist, warm and unyielding, sliding down the curve of my spine to cup my ass. 
I pushed at his chest, half-hearted, my resolve crumbling as he pressed me back against the bed.
His lips crashed into mine, hot and insistent, tasting of scotch and unspoken apologies. 
I wanted to fight it, but my body betrayed me, arching into him as he parted my thighs with his knee. His hardness pressed against me, teasing the wet heat aching for him. 
"You're an asshole," I breathed, even as I felt him nudge closer, the tip of him brushing my entrance. 
Then the phone rang-sharp, insistent-snapping us out of the haze, leaving me trembling and furious all over again.
Sean pulled back as if waking from a dream, his expression shuttering closed once more.
"Drink the tea and get some rest," he said, already turning away, phone in hand.
The night air on the terrace was cool against my skin as I leaned against the railing, listening to Sean's voice drift through the partially open door to his study.
"Yes, of course I'll stay." His tone was gentle, nothing like the clipped businesslike manner he typically used. "Don't worry about it. Get some sleep."
I closed my eyes, remembering a similar gentleness two years ago, when my family's investment bank was collapsing and Sean had appeared in my office with an unexpected proposition.
"Marry me," he'd said, no preamble, no romance. "My grandmother's health is declining, and she needs to know the family legacy is secure. You need financial stability and social protection. It's a sensible arrangement."
We'd laid out the terms like any other business deal: a two-year minimum commitment, shared public appearances, separate bedrooms, and absolute discretion. 
Elizabeth Shaw got her picture-perfect granddaughter-in-law, and I got a shield against the worst of the social fallout from my family's downfall. It had seemed so logical then.
I didn't hear Sean approach until he spoke.
"We should get divorced."
I turned to face him, oddly calm. The words should have felt like another blow, but instead they were almost a relief. At least this was honest.
"When?"
"Soon." He leaned against the railing beside me, our shoulders not quite touching. "After grandmother's heart surgery."
"Thank you," I said softly, "for these two years."
Sean's jaw tightened. "Don't be sentimental."
But he didn't move away, and for a while we stood in silence, watching the lights of passing planes blink across the dark sky. 
Somewhere in the city, Christina Jordan was probably still awake, perhaps planning her triumphant return to Sean's life. 
Not that it mattered now.
I walked back into the bathroom, and the tears I'd been holding in finally came rushing out. I didn't dare let myself sob aloud-if I did, Sean might think I was trying to drag him into some drama. My pride wouldn't let me show any weakness.
I took the physical exam report I'd carefully dried earlier and, with a steely resolve, I tore it up.
Just then, I heard a knock at the door.
"Are you okay? Do you need any help?" Sean's voice was soft, but there was a hint of concern in it.
I quickly wiped away my tears. "I'm fine."
He didn't give up. "Dinner's ready. Come join me."
I hurriedly tossed the torn report into the trash and took a deep breath.
The report lay in shreds at the bottom of a bathroom waste basket, along with the last of my illusions about my marriage. 
###chapter 3: Just the Wrong Medicine
Angela POV
"These are all your favorites," Sean said, cutting a piece of fish and placing it on my plate.
"Thank you!" I forced a smile, even though something about the fish suddenly made my stomach turn. 
It had always been one of my favorites, but now, it felt off. Maybe it was the pregnancy changing my taste, or maybe it was just the overwhelming sadness I couldn't shake.
Not wanting him to notice, I quickly searched for something to talk about. 
"Two years ago, thanks for all your help," I said with a smile, looking at Sean.
He seemed a little surprised.
"You don't have to thank me," he said softly. "Our marriage was always a deal. You've helped me a lot, too."
As he turned to leave the dining table, he suddenly stopped and looked back. 
"If you need anything, just let me know. I'll do my best to make it right. I think we can still be friends after the divorce."
I nodded and gave a polite smile.
Just friends? If you truly love someone, how could you settle for just being friends?
But if you truly love someone, you'll understand that sometimes love means letting go.
Sean, I shouldn't expect anything more from you.
The morning light streaming through our penthouse windows did nothing to ease my pounding headache. I reached for the medicine cabinet, my fingers closing around the familiar bottle of cold pills. 
It wasn't until I'd popped one into my mouth that reality crashed back - pregnant. 
I rushed to the bathroom, spitting the pill into the sink. Water ran pink with the dissolving medication as I rinsed my mouth repeatedly, heart pounding. 
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
"Are you alright?"
I jumped at Sean's voice behind me. He stood in the doorway, perfectly pressed suit a stark contrast to my disheveled appearance in the mirror.
"What's wrong?" he pressed. "You seem agitated. Are you feeling ill?"
"It's nothing," I managed, avoiding his gaze in the mirror. "Just took the wrong medicine."
His reflection studied me for a long moment.
"You should stay home today," he said finally.
"I have meetings."
He made a sound of frustration but didn't argue. 
When we prepared to leave，Sean gave me a concerned look .
"Let Peter drive you today," Sean said, reaching for his phone. "You're in no condition to-"
His phone rang, Christina's name lighting up the screen. 
He glanced at me before finally answering the phone.
I stepped away, giving him privacy for their conversation, though fragments still reached me: "...of course... yes, I remember... tonight then..."
The familiar ache in my chest had nothing to do with my cold. 
I sent Sean a quick text - "Taking a cab."
***
The Shaw Group offices buzzed with their usual morning energy, but today it felt like sensory overload. Every phone ring sent daggers through my skull, every clicking heel against marble floors echoed like thunder.
"Angela, you look unwell." Emily's concerned face appeared at my office door. "Are you feeling okay?"
"I'm fine," I assured her, though the words felt like gravel in my throat. "Just didn't sleep well last night."
"You should take sick leave," she pressed. "The quarterly reports can wait a day."
I shook my head. "I need to finish these before the board meeting."
The truth was, I needed the distraction. 
Every quiet moment left me alone with thoughts of the torn pregnancy test in my bathroom trash, of Sean's gentle voice speaking to Christina, of the impending divorce hanging over everything like a guillotine blade.
***
I was halfway through the quarterly projections when a sweet perfume wafted into my office. Christina Jordan stood in my doorway, resplendent in white Chanel dress.
She walked in, flashing me a smile. 
"Long time no see," she said, her eyes scanning me from head to toe.
Her tone dripped with sarcasm as she added, "You look... emm, not so great."
I forced a polite smile, doing my best to keep my composure. "Long time no see."
"Sean told me everything. You must feel awful."she said, concern etched perfectly across her features. 
For one heart-stopping moment, I thought she meant the divorce. 
But soon, she feigned sympathy. "I heard you got caught in the rain last night and got sick."
"I'm fine," 
"You really should rest," she insisted, moving further into my office like she belonged there. "Sean and I are both worried about you."
The way she spoke made it sound like they were already married.Of course he'd discussed my health with her. What else did they discuss in their private conversations?
Movement in the doorway caught my attention - Sean himself, watching our interaction with an intensity that made my head spin. 
"Why are you being stubborn when you're clearly sick?" he demanded. "The company won't fall apart without you. Go home and rest."
I saw Christina's perfectly shaped eyebrows rise at his forceful tone, saw the surprise flicker across her face at his obvious concern.
"I have work to do," I said quietly, turning back to my computer screen. 
I couldn't bear to watch another moment of their silent communication, couldn't stand to see the way they gravitated toward each other even when trying to maintain professional distance.
"Angela-" Sean started, but I cut him off.
"I said I'm fine."
"We should leave her be," Christina murmured, then she linked her arm with Sean's and walked out of my office.
The sight in front of me hit me all over again！
Even though I'm Sean's wife on paper, we've never shown any affection in the office!
Sean and I weren't even officially divorced yet, but here they were, openly showing their love in the office!
###chapter 4:She Knelt Between My Husband‘s legs
Angela POV
Once they left, I slammed the door to my office behind me.
Few hours later，I pushed through the headache and finished organizing the papers, then headed to Sean's office.
When I pushed open the door, I froze. 
Christina was on her knees-right between Sean's legs!
I never expected them to do something so shameless in the office！
Sean's head snapped toward me, his expression a mixture of shock and panic. He scrambled to his feet, nearly knocking over the chair behind him. 
"Wait, this isn't what it looks like!" he blurted out. "Christina accidentally spilled coffee on me, and she was just-"
My gaze flicked to his pants. A dark stain spread across the fabric, confirming part of his story. But I wasn't interested in explanations. Who knew what had actually happened before I walked in?
Cutting him off, I stepped forward and placed the report on his desk with a sharp thud."Here's the report you need for this afternoon's meeting."
The room swayed slightly as I straightened, but I forced myself to remain steady.
"She's clearly unwell," Christina murmured to Sean. 
I turned to leave before either could see how deeply the words had cut, but Sean's voice stopped me.
"Angela, wait-"
"If there's nothing else?" I kept my voice professionally neutral, not turning back.
His sigh of frustration followed me out the door.
But Christina called out to him, "Sean, there's something I need to discuss with you."
Sean didn't chase after me. Instead, he went back to Christina.
"Don't get upset," I told myself. I should've seen this coming two years ago, right?
Back in my office, the pounding in my head had intensified.
"Angela?" Emily's concerned face swam into view. "You really should lie down. You're white as a sheet."
"Just need to finish...".
I blinked, trying to clear my vision, but the office kept tilting at odd angles.
The last thing I heard was Emily's startled gasp as the world went dark.
***
The gardens of Phillips Exeter Academy stretched out before me, perfectly manicured and dotted with graduating seniors in their formal wear. 
I smoothed down my own dress - pale blue silk that had cost more than some people's monthly rent - and tried to steady my nerves.
Tonight was the night. After years of careful friendship, of being the perfect study partner and confidante, I would finally tell Sean Shaw how I felt. 
The timing was perfect - we were both headed to Ivy League schools, both part of the same social circle. It made sense.
I spotted him near the fountain, surrounded by his usual group of friends. My heart did that familiar flutter as I watched him laugh.
"Did you hear about Christina?" One of the boys was saying as I approached. "On that yacht last weekend-"
"She saved my life." Sean's voice carried clearly across the garden. "I still can't believe she knew exactly what to do when I started having that reaction. If she hadn't been there..."
"Sounds like fate," someone else chimed in. "The perfect meet-cute for the perfect couple."
"There will always be a place for her by my side," Sean agreed, his tone soft with something I'd never heard before.
I backed away before they could notice me, the blue silk suddenly feeling like it was choking me...
The scene shifted, blurred, reformed. Sean's face loomed over me, but older now, harder.
"Be reasonable about this," his voice echoed strangely. "Or don't blame me for taking matters into my own hands."
Christina stood behind him, a white-clad angel of mercy with a devil's smile. 
"It's for the best, Angela. You understand, don't you? Some things are just meant to be..."
***
I jerked awake to find myself in the back of a car, the privacy partition raised. My head was resting against something firm - Sean's shoulder, I realized with a start. 
The familiar scent of his cologne mingled with Christina's perfume, making my stomach roll.
"She's awake," Christina's voice came from my other side. "Thank goodness. We were so worried when Emily called down to say you'd collapsed."
I tried to sit up, but Sean's arm kept me firmly in place. 
"Don't move," he ordered. "We're taking you to hospital."
"No." I pushed against his hold. "No hospitals."
"This isn't a negotiation." His tone was pure CEO - the one that brooked no argument from subordinates. "You're burning up with fever, you collapsed at work, and-"
"I said no." I managed to put some space between us. "Just take me home."
"Angela, be reasonable," Christina interjected, "We're only trying to help."
The dream fragments swirled in my mind - young Sean declaring Christina's place at his side, older Sean threatening... what? 
The memory slipped away like smoke, leaving only a vague sense of dread.
"Home," I repeated firmly. "Or I'll get out at the next light and take a cab."
Sean made a sound of pure frustration, but I saw him signal the driver through the partition. 
The car smoothly changed direction, heading toward Central Park West instead of the hospital.
I closed my eyes, not wanting to see the looks passing between Sean and Christina over my head. 
"You know," Christina said with confidence, "I graduated from the best medical school, you should listen to me."
I didn't respond. I knew she wasn't really concerned; she was just trying to flaunt her credentials.
"Enough games, Angela." Sean's voice cut through the air-conditioned silence. "Why are you refusing to go to the hospital?"
###chapter 5: The Last Shred of Dignity
Why had he been pretending to care about me? He was the one who'd made me stand in the rain yesterday!
Now, his concern just felt even more fake, even more disgusting.
Christina shifted beside me, her perfume making my stomach roll. 
I couldn't go to the hospital.
If I had, my pregnancy would've been exposed.
It sounded silly, but I didn't want anyone to know about the baby-I needed to hold on to whatever little self-respect I had left.
Especially in front of Christina.
"That's not your business." I siad coldly and pressed my forehead against the cool window.
"Sean," Christina's voice was honey-sweet with concern, "maybe it's because of my presence? I could get out here, and you can take Angela to the hospital? Her condition seems serious, we shouldn't delay."
"Don't be ridiculous," Sean snapped, though his tone softened as he continued. "This isn't about you."
I caught Christina's perfectly practiced look of contrition in the window's reflection.
 "Angela, I apologize if I've misunderstood. I thought you might be uncomfortable because of my relationship with Sean."Christina played the victim, acting hurt.
"It's fine." I said coldly.
Sean's hand moved toward my forehead, but I flinched away before he could make contact. 
The hurt that flashed across his face was gone so quickly.
"I know a private clinic," Christina offered after a moment of tense silence. 
"Dr. Thomas Carter - he's absolutely brilliant, very discreet. No waiting rooms, no publicity."
Sean's eyebrows drew together. "Carter? What are his credentials?"
"Harvard Medical, top of his class." Christina's smile was knowing, intimate. "He handles most of the Upper East Side's more... delicate situations. Elizabeth's heart specialist actually consulted with him about her upcoming surgery."
The mention of Sean's grandmother sent another wave of guilt through me. Here I was, carrying her desperately wanted great-grandchild, while planning to divorce her grandson. 
The irony would have made me laugh if I weren't so focused on not throwing up in a car worth more than most people's annual salary.
Sean studied me for a long moment before nodding. 
"Fine. Peter, change of plans. Dr. Carter's clinic on East 76th."
***
The clinic occupied the first two floors of a pristine townhouse, its discrete brass plaque the only indication that it wasn't just another multi-million-dollar residence. 
Christina's hand on my elbow as we entered felt like a brand, her solicitous attention more suffocating than the fever.
I tried not to flinch as the doctor raised the thermometer, but my body betrayed me with an involuntary step backward. 
Sean's hand appeared at the small of my back, steadying me. The gesture felt achingly familiar - a echo of genuine concern from a man who would soon be my ex-husband.
"102.3," Dr. Carter announced after finally managing to take my temperature. "Not dangerous yet, but heading that way. I'd like to start an IV to bring the fever down and prevent dehydration."
"No." The word came out sharp, panicked. An IV meant blood work. Blood work meant pregnancy hormones. Pregnancy hormones meant...
"Angela." Sean's voice held a warning. "Don't be difficult."
"No needles," I insisted, hating how weak I sounded. "Just... whatever you can prescribe orally."
Dr. Carter's eyes flickered between Sean and me, professional mask firmly in place. "There are other cooling methods we can try, though they're less efficient. Christina, would you mind helping my nurse set up the cooling blankets?"
"Of course." She squeezed Sean's arm as she passed - a casual gesture that spoke volumes about their comfort level with each other.
I closed my eyes, not wanting to see Sean's response. The room felt like it was slowly spinning, though whether from fever or emotional exhaustion, I couldn't tell.
"Mrs. Shaw," Dr. Carter's voice was carefully neutral, "would you prefer to discuss your treatment options privately?"
"That won't be necessary," I managed. "Whatever you think is best, as long as it doesn't involve needles."
Sean made a sound of frustration. "This is ridiculous. You've never had problems with medical procedures before."
Before I was carrying your child, I thought bitterly.
"The cooling blankets are ready," Christina announced, returning with the same perfect timing she always seemed to manage. 
Of course she would know her way around medical equipment - the future Dr. Jordan, savior of Sean Shaw, had to maintain her image of competence.
"The fever's coming down," Dr. Carter announced finally. "But she needs rest - real rest, not the kind that involves checking emails from bed."
"I'll make sure of it," Sean said.
"I can stay with her," Christina offered. "My rotation doesn't start until next week, and it would be no trouble..."
"That's not necessary," Sean cut her off. "I'll handle it."
The surprise on Christina's face mirrored my own.
I never thought Sean would want to take care of me himself.
"Let's get you home," he said quietly, helping me to my feet. 
The world swayed, and I grabbed his arm for balance. He steadied me without comment, his hand warm through the thin material of my blouse.
I closed my eyes as Sean helped me into the car. 
At least my secret was still safe.
###chapter 6: My Husband’s Lover Gave Me A Bath？!
Angela POV
Sean lifted me from the town car as if I weighed nothing, cradling me against his chest. 
His steady heartbeat against my cheek. 
For just a moment, I allowed myself to sink into his warmth, to pretend this tenderness meant something more than obligation. 
Behind us, Christina's Louboutins clicked against the floor in perfect rhythm, each step a reminder of her unwanted presence in my home.
Sean gestured toward the living room. "Christina, please make yourself comfortable. Sarah, would you bring Miss Jordan some lemon water?"
"You still remember," Christina's smile carried years of shared history. "Though I suppose some things never change. This place looks exactly the same as it did two years ago - you never were one for redecorating, Sean."
The casual familiarity in her voice made my stomach turn.
Of course she knew every detail of this home - she'd practically lived here before our marriage. 
I forced myself to look away as she settled onto the leather sofa with the ease of someone returning to their rightful place. 
Perhaps this was always meant to be her home, I thought. I'm just keeping her seat warm.
Sean carried me toward the master bathroom, his movements careful but sure. The marble countertops gleamed under soft lighting as he set me down, steadying me with one arm while reaching for my shirt with his other hand.
Heat that had nothing to do with my fever rushed to my face as his fingers slipped beneath the hem of my shirt. 
"I can manage," I whispered.
"You can barely stand," he said softly, continuing his gentle but methodical undressing. "Besides, it's nothing I haven't seen before. Don't be shy."
The intimacy of the moment shattered as Christina appeared in the doorway, still carrying her lemon water. 
"Let me help," she offered, setting her glass aside. "I have a medical degree, after all. I know exactly how to care for patients in this condition."
I watched Sean's reflection in the mirror, a part of me desperately hoping he would refuse, would insist on staying. But of course, that was just another foolish fantasy. 
As expected, he stepped back. "I'll be in my study if you need anything."
The door closed behind him with a quiet click, leaving me alone with the woman who knew every inch of this home as well as I did.
"I'll take it from here," she announced, reaching for my blouse buttons. 
I swear, this is the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me:
My husband's lover gave me a bath!
"My, you've gotten thin,"  she exclaimed, genuine surprise coloring her voice."Men generally prefer women with more curves, you know. Sean especially - he's always appreciated a more... feminine figure."
"Really?" I met her gaze in the mirror. My voice came out colder than intended. 
In two years of marriage, Sean had never once mentioned his preferences in women. Perhaps it didn't matter whether I was thin or curvy - he simply didn't care about me at all. 
I couldn't help but notice Christina's perfect curves reflected in the mirror. So this was the type of figure Sean preferred.
"These past two years... you've done Sean such a service, helping him maintain appearances in society. Though I imagine it must have been difficult, playing the role of Mrs. Shaw when everyone knows it's temporary." Christina smiled.
I closed my eyes, too exhausted to maintain the pretense of polite society any longer.
"You don't need to worry about me, Christina. I know my place in Sean's life - and yours."
"Oh?" 
"The position by his side will always be reserved for you." 
Something flickered in her eyes - triumph, perhaps, or uncertainty. Before she could respond, a knock at the door announced Sean's return.
"Is everything alright?" 
"Perfect timing," Christina called back. "I was just about to help Angela out of the bath. Though perhaps you should wait in the other room - we wouldn't want to make anyone uncomfortable."
"I should drive you home later," Sean told Christina after helping me back to my room. But Christina shook her head, her perfect smile never wavering.
"I insist on staying the night," she said softly. "Angela needs proper medical supervision, and I'd feel terrible if something happened while I wasn't here."
Sean hesitated for just a moment before nodding. "I'll prepare the guest room for you."
The pain in my chest had nothing to do with my fever as I watched him lead Christina down the hallway. 
She hadn't even waited for our divorce to be final before moving into our home. But what right did I have to object? 
I retreated to my room, trying to ignore the sound of Sean's voice giving instructions to the staff about preparing Christina's accommodations.
Later, tucked into bed with fresh cooling cloths on my forehead, I heard footsteps approaching. Sean appeared in the doorway, a glass of water in one hand and my medication in the other.
"You need to take these," he said, his voice gentler than I'd heard it in months. He sat on the edge of my bed, the mattress dipping slightly under his weight.
"Thank you," I managed, already anticipating his departure. "You don't have to stay. I'm sure Christina-"
"I'm staying until you fall asleep." The words were quiet but firm, brooking no argument. "Take your medicine, Angela."
His tenderness caught me off guard. It had been so long since he'd shown this side of himself - the Sean I'd known before contracts and convenient arrangements had complicated everything. 
Something pulled tight in my chest as he helped me sit up, his hand warm against my back.
"We're getting divorced," I reminded him, hating how small my voice sounded. "You don't need to pretend to care anymore."
His jaw tightened, but his touch remained gentle as he handed me the pills. "Close your eyes and rest. You're burning up."
I was too exhausted to argue, my head pounding with each heartbeat. The cool pillow welcomed me back as Sean adjusted the blankets, his cologne wrapping around me like a familiar comfort I shouldn't allow myself to feel.
Sleep came in fits and starts, punctuated by fever dreams of graduation nights and yacht parties, of moments I'd lost before I'd ever had them.
Then suddenly, I was jolting awake from a nightmare I couldn't quite remember, Sean's name escaping my lips before I could stop it.
The bedroom was empty, the silence broken only by the distant hum of the city below.
Christina was somewhere in our home tonight - the thought sent a fresh wave of pain through my chest. 
Was Sean with her now?
The image of them together, making love, invaded my mind before I could stop it.
A tear slipped down my cheek, disappearing into the pillow before I could brush it away. 
###chapter 7: I Found My Husband's Cufflink On Her Bed
Angela POV
When I woke the next morning, both Sean and Christina were gone.
The suspicion that had been gnawing at me all night suddenly felt like certainty - they must have spent the night together.
I couldn't help myself; I had to know.
My feet carried me to Christina's guest room before I could think better of it. I hesitated for just a moment before pushing the door open, slipping inside like an intruder in my own home.
The room was immaculate, pristine sheets perfectly made, everything in its proper place. There was no obvious sign that Sean had spent the night here, but Christina's signature perfume still lingered in the air, marking her territory.
I was suddenly distracted by a small shiny object next to the pillow.
I walked over, picked it up, and realized it was a pure gold cufflink. The engraved "S" reminded me-it was Sean's! The one I gave him for his birthday last year.
So he really did sleep with Christina last night!
Soon this will be her bedroom, not just a guest room, I thought bitterly. Everything that's mine will become hers.
"Oh! Excuse me, Mrs. Shaw."
I startled at the maid's voice, turning to find the maid Sarah hovering uncertainly in the doorway with cleaning supplies.
The knowing look in her eyes made my cheeks burn - how pathetic must I seem, sneaking around my own home looking for evidence of my husband's infidelity?
I retreated to my room, mortification following me like a shadow. I had barely sat down when a knock came at my door.
"Mrs. Shaw?" Sarah's voice came through the door. "Would you like your breakfast brought up?"
"No, thank you." The thought of food made my stomach roll. "When did Mr. Shaw and Miss Jordan leave?"
A slight pause. "They left early this morning. Mr. Shaw had a breakfast meeting, and Miss Jordan accompanied him."
Of course she did.
I managed to shower and dress, each movement requiring more energy than it should. The mirror reflected a pale version of myself - designer clothes hanging slightly loose, makeup carefully applied to hide the shadows under my eyes.
The perfect mask of an Billionaire's wife, even as my marriage crumbled around me.
The lobby of our building buzzed with the discrete energy that meant gossip was circulating. The usual morning parade of dog walkers and personal trainers moved with studied casualness, voices dropping to whispers as I approached.
"...always knew it was temporary..."
"...saved his life on that yacht..."
"...just waiting for her to ..."
I kept my head high, pretending not to hear the fragments of conversation that followed me. Two years of practice had perfected my ability to maintain dignity in the face of society's judgment.
"Mrs. Shaw." James Morrison's voice cut through the whispers like a knife.
"A moment of your time?"
I followed him to his office, grateful for the escape.
"Mr. Shaw asked me to ensure you take these." He placed a small pharmacy bag on his desk.
I stared at the bag, my throat suddenly tight. "Did he say what they were?"
"Anti-fever medication, I believe. He was quite insistent about the timing - every four hours, with food."
My hand trembled slightly as I picked up the bag. Through the white paper, I could feel the sharp edges of pill boxes that might or might not be safe for pregnancy.
The irony of it hit me then - Sean's concern for my health could unknowingly harm his unborn child.
"Thank you, James." I turned to leave, but his voice stopped me.
"Mrs. Shaw..." He hesitated, something unusual for the usually unflappable manager. "Perhaps you'd like to know that Miss Jordan's previous visits were always... discrete. This morning's departure was rather public."
The message was clear - Christina wanted to be seen leaving with Sean.
"I appreciate your concern," I said quietly.
James's expression remained professionally neutral, but something like sympathy flickered in his eyes. "Even the strongest bonds can be tested by time and distance, Mrs. Shaw. Two years is a long time to maintain appearances."
The words hit closer to home than he could know. I clutched the pharmacy bag tighter, nodding once before retreating to the elevator.
In our bathroom, I emptied the pills onto the marble counter, studying the labels with desperate intensity. The warnings blurred before my eyes - potential side effects, contraindications, nothing specific about pregnancy.
I should call Dr. Morrison, my regular physician, but that would mean explaining everything. The news would reach Sean within hours.
Maybe it would be better if there was no choice to make.
I opened the bottle and started pouring the pills into the toilet
"What are you doing?"
Sean's voice froze me in place. In the mirror, I could see him standing in the doorway, his expression unreadable. The pills felt like burning coal in my palm, each one a potential betrayal of the secret I was desperate to keep.
"Angela." He stepped closer, his reflection growing larger in the mirror. "Put the pills down."
"I don't need them."
"You're still burning up. What's really going on?" His hand came to rest on my forehead, the touch startlingly gentle.
"Nothing." I opened my eyes, meeting his reflection's stare. "I just don't like taking medication I don't need."
"Since when?" His other hand closed around mine, carefully taking the pills. "You've never been afraid of medicine before. What's changed?"
Everything, I wanted to say. Everything has changed.
"Shouldn't you be with Christina?" I tried to change the subject.
"She's working," he replied simply.
Of course. The perfect Dr. Jordan, balancing her medical career with her careful conquest of Sean Shaw.
I watched in the mirror as Sean methodically returned the pills to their bottles, his movements precise and controlled.
"You need to take these," he said finally, voice soft but firm. "I won't watch you make yourself sicker out of stubbornness."
The irony of his concern nearly made me laugh.
My life felt like something from a poorly written soap opera.
"I can take care of myself." I reached for the bottles, but Sean pulled them away.
"Clearly, you can't."
"You don't need to pretend anymore," I said quietly. "Christina's back now. You can stop acting like you care."
His expression darkened. "Is that what this is about? You're refusing medication because you're jealous?"
The accusation stung, mostly because it was partly true. But not in the way he thought.
"I'm not jealous." I turned away from the mirror, needing to escape his searching gaze. "I'm tired. Of all of it. The pretense, the gossip, the careful dance we do for your grandmother's benefit. Just... tired."
Sean's hand caught my arm as I tried to move past him, his grip gentle but firm. "Angela, look at me."
I kept my eyes fixed on the floor, afraid of what he might see if I met his gaze. His other hand came up to cup my chin, forcing me to face him.
"Whatever game you're playing," he said softly, "it stops now. "
Then Sean did something that completely shocked me. He picked up a piece of pill to put in his mouth, then kissed me on the lips.
He was feeding me the medicine with his mouth!
###chapter 8: Give Her The Medicine Mouth-to-Mouth
Sean POV
The defiance in her eyes challenged me, pushed at something primal and possessive I hadn't known existed.
Before I could think better of it, I popped one of the pills into my mouth and pressed my lips to hers.
The kiss was meant to be functional - a way to force her to take the medication she needed.
But the moment our lips touched, something shifted. Her gasp of surprise parted her lips, and suddenly I was drowning in the taste of her, in the soft warmth of her mouth against mine.
For a heartbeat that seemed to stretch into eternity, we stood frozen in that moment of unexpected intimacy.
Then her hands came up hard against my chest, shoving me backward with surprising strength.
The crack of her palm against my cheek echoed in the bathroom's confined space.
"How dare you?" Her voice shook with fury. "You decide we should get divorced, and then you pull something like this?"
The sting of her slap was nothing compared to the fire in her eyes. This wasn't the carefully controlled Angela I'd known for two years. This was something else entirely - raw and real and somehow more compelling than I wanted to admit.
"You needed to take the medicine," I said, the excuse sounding weak even to my own ears.
"Don't." She backed away, putting space between us. "Don't pretend this is about my health. You've made your choice clear. Christina's back, the arrangement is ending - fine. But you don't get to play with me like this."
"Is that what you think I'm doing?"
"What else would you call it?" Her laugh was brittle. "Making me take medicine like a child while you plan your future with another woman?"
The mention of Christina sent an unexpected wave of irritation through me. "This has nothing to do with her."
"Everything has to do with her!" Angela's voice rose. "The great Christina Jordan, who saved your life, who holds your heart, who-"
My phone's sharp ring cut through her words. Christina's name lit up the screen.
"You should get that," Angela said, the fight draining from her voice. "Your soulmate's calling."
She slipped past me before I could stop her, leaving me alone with the echo of her words and the lingering taste of her on my lips.
"Sean?" Christina's voice came through the speaker, warm and familiar. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything important."
I sat behind my desk, trying to focus on the conversation and not on the phantom sensation of Angela's mouth against mine.
"What do you need?"
"Always so direct," she laughed. "I wanted to discuss the potential partnership between Shaw Group and my family's medical technology division. Perhaps over lunch?"
The invitation was clear in her tone - this would be more than a business meeting. Two years ago, I would have welcomed it. Now, something held me back.
"Send the proposal to my office," I said, keeping my voice professionally neutral. "We can review it there."
"Sean." Her voice softened to the intimate tone she'd always used to get her way. "We both know this conversation would be better had in person."
"Alright," I finally gave in to Christina's suggestion.
After hanging up, I called out to Angela. "I'll be back soon."
Only silence answered me.
***
The Four Seasons' private dining room was as elegant as ever, but I found my thoughts drifting.
Christina sat across from me, radiant in white Chanel, yet all I could think about was how pale and tired Angela had looked this morning.
I knew I should end our marriage as planned, but the thought of hurting Angela bothered me more than it should. Our marriage might have been arranged, but I'd always considered her a really good friend.
"Sean?" Christina's voice pulled me back to the present. "You seem distracted."
"Nothing"
"Please take me home!" Christina suggested after lunch.
Her hand found my thigh as soon as we were in the car, then moved to my cock, the touch bold and familiar.
Two years ago, this would have been enough to ignite desire. Now, it felt like an intrusion.
"Don't," I said, keeping my eyes on the road. "It's dangerous while driving."
She laughed softly, but something in my tone made her withdraw her hand. "How's Angela feeling?"
"Better."
"Good." She paused. "When are you filing for divorce?"
"I'm sorry." She added, "I just hate seeing you trapped in this... arrangement. Especially now that I'm back. We both know it's time to end it."
The same words I'd said to Angela days ago, yet somehow they felt different coming from Christina's perfectly painted lips.
"My grandmother's surgery-"
"Is in less than a month," she finished. "And then there's no reason to maintain this charade. Unless..." She leaned forward, her perfume washing over me. "Unless you've developed real feelings for her?"
"Don't be ridiculous." The denial came automatically, even as my mind flashed to the kiss we'd shared hours ago.
Christina's smile was knowing. "Then there's nothing stopping us from picking up where we left off. "
Her hand came to rest on my arm. "Some things are meant to be, Sean. You and me, we're inevitable. This detour with Angela - it's just that. A detour."
"It's not that simple..."
"Of course it is." Her confidence was absolute. "Once your grandmother's surgery is successful, you can end this farce. I love you,Sean."
The word 'love' hung in the air between us, suddenly making the car feel too small. The weight of it pressed against my chest, unexpected and suffocating.
***
The penthouse was quiet when I returned that evening, the silence broken only by the soft footsteps of Sarah, our longtime maid, as she approached me with obvious hesitation.
"Mr. Shaw?" Her hands twisted nervously in her apron. "I found something while cleaning Mrs. Shaw's bathroom. I... I wasn't sure if I should bring it to you, but..."
She held out a crumpled piece of paper, obviously retrieved from the trash. "It looked important, sir. Like medical results of some kind."
I took the paper, noting the New York-Presbyterian letterhead. Angela's name jumped out at me, along with a date from earlier this week.
"Thank you, Sarah. "
Alone in my study, I smoothed out the torn document, Angela's name at the top catching my eye immediately. 
A routine check-up?
No, there had to be more.
Angela wouldn't be this secretive about a simple fever. The way she'd been acting lately, refusing medication, her emotional changes...
What else was wrong with her?
###chapter 9: Would You Actually Want Me To Be Pregnant
Sean POV
The medical report felt heavy in my hands as I stood outside Angela's bedroom.
Through the partially open door, I could see her silhouette against the window, the lights creating a halo around her slender frame.
She had long, flowing black hair that cascaded down her back like strands of silky seaweed, swaying with the slightest movement. Her amber eyes, always warm and luminous, held a gentle glow, as if capturing the golden light of the setting sun.
But now, she looked fragile in the darkness, nothing like the composed woman who handled Shaw Group's most delicate negotiations.
My fingers tightened on the crumpled paper. In two years of marriage, I'd never seen Angela genuinely ill, never known her to hide medical information. Yet here was evidence of a hospital visit she'd kept secret, torn into pieces and discarded like evidence of a crime.
"You can come in," she said without turning around. "I can hear you thinking from here."
I pushed the door open.
"Want to explain this?"
She turned, moonlight catching the shadows under her eyes. Her gaze dropped to the medical report in my hand, and something flickered across her face - fear?
"Where did you get that?"
"Sarah found it while cleaning." I held it out to her. "Care to tell me why you're hiding medical reports?"
Angela snatched the paper from my hand, scanning its contents. Her shoulders relaxed slightly. "It's just my annual physical. Nothing to concern yourself with."
"Then why tear it up?"
"Because it's private." Her voice carried that edge of steel I'd come to recognize - the one that appeared whenever she felt cornered. "Though I suppose privacy means little in this house lately."
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"Shouldn't you be at Christina's?" Her smile was razor-sharp. "Though I suppose you're planning to bring her back here instead. I should remind you that we are still legally married, at least for now."
"What are you talking about? Christina only stayed here last night to help you. And I didn't sleep in her room!"
"No?" Angela turned back to the window. "My mistake. Your cufflink was sitting there on her bed."
The implications in her voice made something hot and uncomfortable curl in my chest.
"Nothing happened with Christina."
"It doesn't matter." She crumpled the report in her fist. "We're getting divorced, remember? Your private life is no longer my concern.I just hope you can maintain some dignity until we're officially divorced. I don't want to hear the servants gossiping about us!"
I caught her wrist before she could tear the paper further.
"Don't try to change the subject. Something's wrong with you. The fever, the medication avoidance, these hidden doctor visits - don't lie to me, Angela."
"Let go!" Her pulse raced under my fingers, betraying her calm exterior.
"Not until you tell me the truth."
"The truth?" She laughed. "You don't know me well enough to handle the truth, Sean."
"Two years of marriage says otherwise."
"Two years of convenience," she corrected. "Two years of playing our parts for your grandmother's benefit. Don't pretend it was more than that."
But my hand was still on her wrist, and I could feel her trembling.
"You're shaking."
"I'm tired." She tried to pull away, but I held firm.
"Sean, please..."
Without thinking, I pulled her closer, until I could feel the heat of her fever through her silk robe. "Tell me what's wrong."
She looked up at me, moonlight catching the tears she was trying to hide.
"You want the truth? Fine. I'm pregnant."
The words knocked the breath from my lungs. My grip on her wrist loosened involuntarily, and she stepped back. Then, unexpectedly, a contemptuous smile curved her lips.
"How could I be pregnant?" Her laugh was brittle in the darkness. "I was just joking. But even if I were..."
Her voice hardened.
"I would get an abortion anyway."
Anger flared hot in my chest. "Is the thought of carrying my child really that repulsive to you?"
"Let me ask you something instead," Angela's voice was ice-cold. "Would you actually want me to be pregnant? We're getting divorced, Sean."
Her words hit home like a physical blow.
She was right - we were getting divorced. Bringing a new life into this mess wouldn't be fair to anyone. Not to Angela, not to Christina, and certainly not to the child.
I had made my choice when I decided to be with Christina. The proper thing to do now was to maintain appropriate distance from Angela. Any other path would only lead to more complications, more pain.
My phone buzzed again in my pocket, Christina's name illuminating the screen. The timing felt like fate's way of confirming my decision.
"Goodnight, Sean," Angela said quietly, slipping past me into the hallway.
I stood alone at the window, watching the city lights blur beneath me. The right choice wasn't always the easiest one to live with.
My phone buzzed again. Opening it, I found Christina's goodnight message, accompanied by a photo of her in silk pajamas.
Two years had transformed her from the fresh-faced medical student I remembered into an even more alluring woman.
The sight stirred memories of that night on the yacht - her quick thinking when I collapsed, the way she'd stayed by my side through my recovery, risking her own life to save mine. She'd been so young then, yet she hadn't hesitated to put herself in danger for me.
I couldn't betray that kind of devotion. Christina had earned her place in my life, paid for it with her own blood on that yacht deck.
As for Angela... I already had plans for how to compensate her properly.
###chapter 10: Does Sean Know?
Angela POV
I heard Sean close the door as he left, and found myself letting out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding.
Lying in bed, I was really tired, but sleep still eluded me.
Sean's recent behavior left me confused and unsettled.
Today he had kissed me - supposedly just to make me take the medicine - but that kiss had nearly made me fall for him all over again.
My fingers traced my lips, still able to recall the peculiar taste of that medicinal kiss. He had even made a point of explaining that he hadn't spent the night with Christina.
The thought rekindled my anger. If he was going through with our divorce, why was he doing things that left me so confused?
And I hated myself even more for being so weak - a hundred times I had resolved to let him go, yet one kiss was all it took to set my heart trembling again.
When I got up the next morning, Sean was already gone. He had always been dedicated to his work. After hurriedly eating breakfast, I rushed to the office myself.
I had barely settled into my office when Nathan appeared in my doorway.
His golden curls caught the morning light, and his athletic build filled out his tailored suit in a way that made him look more like a hockey player than a Wall Street executive.  
"The Lawrence Capital team is being deliberately obtuse about the merger terms," he said, walking into my office with his usual confident stride. "They're wasting your time."
"Nathan..." I started, trying to maintain my professional tone.
"You look exhausted," he cut in, moving behind my chair. His fingers brushed through my hair with surprising gentleness, a gesture so unexpected it made me freeze. "Let me handle this. Please."
The tender touch transported me back to six years ago - Nathan at seventeen, the youngest trader Wilson Investment Bank had ever hired, brilliant and brash and so eager to prove himself. My father had seen something special in him, had even hinted at a possible match.
But...
I pulled away slightly, careful not to hurt his feelings. "I appreciate the concern, but I can manage."
"You always say that!" The frustration in his voice was raw, unfiltered. His hand dropped from my hair, but he remained standing close behind my chair. "Even when you could lean on others, you just..."
"The Lawrence Capital meeting is in an hour. Send me the latest projections."I rubbed my temples, fighting another wave of nausea.
"Already done." His efficiency was one of the reasons he'd risen so quickly in the company. "But Angela..."
"Yes?"
"Never mind. I'll have Emily bring up the files."
After hanging up, I barely made it to my private bathroom before morning sickness hit in full force.
A phone call came in just as I was returning to my desk. It was my best friend Sophie, her voice as bright and clear as a songbird.
"I just got back from Fashion Week in LA, and I brought you a gift! Let's meet after work!"
***
Bluestone Lane's discrete corner booth offered a welcome refuge from the office's watchful eyes.
The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I spotted Sophie sitting by the window.Her edgy, bold style always made her stand out in a crowd.
Before I could even pull out my chair, she thrust a small velvet jewelry box into my hands.
"This pair of earrings matches your eye color perfectly."
"Thank you!"
"Spill," she demanded before I'd even settled into my seat. "And don't give me that 'everything's fine' corporate face. I've known you since freshman year."
I glanced around before lowering my voice. "The test was positive."
"Oh my God." Sophie's perfect composure cracked. "I can't belive you're gonna be a Mom! Dose Sean know?"
"No..."I shook my head and took a sip of tea.
"Angela! You can't keep this from him. This is your child - Sean has a right to know!"
"Christina's back."
The words hung between us like smoke, bitter and choking. Sophie's expression shifted from shock to understanding, then to fierce protectiveness.
"So what? That perfect little princess's return doesn't change the fact that-"
"That what?" I cut in. "That I'm carrying the child of a man who's planning to divorce me? That I got pregnant during a marriage that was never meant to last?"
"Stop it." Sophie reached across the table, gripping my hand. "You're not thinking clearly. Despite all Sean's flaws, he's not the kind of person who would abandon his own child."
"No," I agreed quietly. "He wouldn't. And that's exactly why I can't tell him."
Sophie sat back, studying me with the same intensity she used on potential cover stories. "Explain."
"If Sean knows about the baby, he'll do the 'honorable' thing. He'll call off the divorce, stand by me, play the perfect father." I traced the rim of my untouched tea cup. "And he'll resent every minute of it."
"You don't know that."
"I do." The certainty in my voice surprised even me. "Because I've watched him these past two years, Sophie. I've seen how he looks at Christina, how his voice changes when he talks to her."
"And what about your claim?" Sophie demanded. "Two years of marriage, shared memories, and now this baby - that counts for nothing?"
"It counts for exactly what it was meant to be - a business arrangement that's reached its natural end."
"God, I want to shake you sometimes!" Sophie's frustration burst out. "You're acting like this is all set in stone. Sean's not married to Christina. He married you."
"For his grandmother's sake." The words tasted bitter. "And once her heart surgery is done next week, that reason disappears."
Sophie opened her mouth to argue further, but her phone buzzed - probably her assistant with another crisis at the magazine. She glanced at it and sighed.
"This conversation isn't over," she warned, standing to leave. "But I have to run. Just... promise me you'll think about what you're doing. Really think about it."
I watched her go, her Louboutins clicking against the floor with decisive purpose. She made it sound so simple - tell Sean, keep the baby, live happily ever after.
But life was never that easy.
Sometimes I wished I could be as optimistic as Sophie. On my way home, her advice kept echoing in my mind.
Should I just follow her suggestion, tell Sean the truth, and keep this baby?
###chapter 11: Deciding to Tell Him
Angela POV
The setting sun cast long shadows in the master bedroom, the elegant furnishings as untouchable as a museum exhibit.
I slipped off my shoes, remembering this morning's encounter with Sean in the Shaw Group lobby.
"Mrs. Shaw," he'd said. "The quarterly projections look promising. Good work."
Just another executive assistant who happened to share his last name. The thought drew a bitter laugh from my throat.
I moved to the window, watching the last rays of sunlight glint off the glass towers of Manhattan. How many evenings had I spent like this, alone in our supposed marital home while Sean attended another "essential" business dinner?
The city lights were beginning to flicker to life, each one a reminder of the countless social events I'd never been invited to attend.
His friends - Evan, William, the whole Wall Street crowd - they all knew the truth about our marriage. I'd seen it in their careful politeness, the way they excluded me from their intimate gatherings. After all, why include a temporary placeholder in their permanent social circle?
The buzz of my phone made me jump. For a moment, my heart leaped - but it was just Emily, confirming tomorrow's meeting schedule.
I set the phone aside, trying to ignore the disappointment that shouldn't exist. This was what I'd agreed to, after all. A marriage of convenience, nothing more.
I could picture Sean in his office now, suit jacket draped over his chair, sleeves rolled up as he pored over contracts and spreadsheets.
Perhaps Christina was there too, just like that afternoon, kneeling between his legs, doing that disgusting thing.
"Mrs. Shaw?"
Sarah's soft voice drew me from my thoughts. Our longtime maid stood in the doorway, holding an elegantly wrapped package.
"This just arrived from Mrs. Elizabeth Shaw," she said, stepping forward. "She insisted it be delivered immediately."
The package was heavy, wrapped in cream paper bearing a Madison Avenue boutique's logo. Inside was a wooden box inlaid with mother-of-pearl.
Inside, nestled in midnight blue velvet, sat a small bronze statue. The figure of a woman, her belly swollen with child, her face serene and knowing.
A fertility goddess, I realized, my throat suddenly tight. The base bore an inscription in Elizabeth's elegant hand:
"For my dear Angela, may you bring joy to our family."
"Would you like me to place it on the mantel?" Sarah asked, her voice carefully neutral.
"No," I managed. "I'll... I'll find a place for it."
Alone again, I cradled the statue in my hands, feeling the weight of Elizabeth's hopes - and my reality - pressing down on me. She'd always treated me more like a true granddaughter than an arranged match for Sean. Her genuine warmth made our deception feel that much heavier.
My mind drifted to yesterday's conversation. I'd tried to test the waters, jokingly telling Sean I might be pregnant. His face had changed instantly - not anger or shock, but something worse. His eyes had held no joy, no trace of excitement at the possibility.
The memory made my hand drift to my still-flat stomach.
Then Sophie's words from our coffee shop conversation echoed in my mind:
"Tell Sean, keep the baby, live happily ever after."
Sophie's words kept growing in my mind.
I set Elizabeth's gift carefully on my bedside table, its presence both comforting and accusatory. The goddess's serene smile seemed to hold secrets, to know things I couldn't yet see.
The thought spurred me to action. Before I could second-guess myself, I picked up my phone. A text would be better than a face-to-face conversation. More controlled, less chance of revealing the storm of emotions behind the news.
My fingers hovered over the keyboard. How do you compress such life-changing information into a text message?
 'We need to talk' felt too cliché, too dramatic. 'I have news' was too vague.
In the end, simplicity won out. Three words that would change everything:
"I'm pregnant."
The message showed as delivered immediately. I held my breath, watching the screen, waiting for those three dots that would indicate he was typing a response. Nothing.
Minutes ticked by, marked by the gentle sweep of the antique clock Sean's grandmother had given us as a wedding present. Each second felt like an eternity, each minute a small death of hope.
I forced myself to set the phone down, to step away from its mocking silence. The city spread out below our windows, millions of lives moving forward while mine seemed suspended in this moment of waiting.
How would Sean react?
Would he insist on staying married for the child's sake?
Would he try to buy my silence, to protect his impending reunion with Christina?
Or would he...
My hand drifted to my stomach again, a gesture that was becoming habitual. An hour passed. I checked my phone again - still no response from Sean.
A knock on the bedroom door made my heart leap. For a moment, I thought it might be Sean, but Sarah's voice came through instead.
She brought in a cup of cinnamon tea. "Mr. Shaw specifically asked me to make this for you, Mrs. Shaw."
Warmth spread through my chest. He must have seen my message, I thought, to be thoughtful enough to send cinnamon tea.
But Sarah's next words turned that warmth to ice.
 "Mr. Shaw also said he won't be coming home tonight."
###chapter 12: There Would Never Be Any Real Sex Between Them！
Christina POV
City lights sparkled like a sea of stars through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Sean's executive office.
I sat in his leather chair, my fingers scrolling through medical investment data on his iPhone.
Until the message appeared.
"I'm pregnant."
Two words from Angela Wilson Shaw that made my world tilt on its axis. I glanced up at Sean. He was absorbed in his work, completely unaware.
Taking a deep breath, I forced myself to stay composed, careful not to let him notice any change in my demeanor.
Time seemed to stop as my mind raced through the implications. 
A baby. How was this possible? 
I'd always thought their marriage was purely for show, that there would never be any real sex between them. But she was pregnant!
She must have seduced him, I thought bitterly.
With her plain figure, how else could she have attracted Sean's attention?
But... they had been living together for two years. Sean was a man, after all. He had... needs. The thought of them together, of them being intimate, made my chest tighten until I could barely breathe.
Angela had always pretended she didn't care about their marriage, acting so noble and detached. But look at her now - secretly trying to compete with me.
What a cunning little bitch！
This baby would be the one thing Elizabeth Shaw wanted more than anything - the perfect weapon for Angela to secure her place in the family permanently.
Suddenly, everything made sense. This was why Angela had refused to go to the hospital the other night, why she'd been so adamant about not getting any injections.
I felt a wave of relief wash over me - thank goodness I'd insisted on staying with Sean that evening. If I hadn't been there, Angela might have already told him everything.
Suddenly, Sean looked up from his work, his eyes meeting mine. "Who just sent a message?"
"Just spam," I replied smoothly, keeping my voice casual. "I deleted it already."
His brow furrowed immediately, a flash of annoyance crossing his features. My heart skipped a beat.
"I'm sorry," I said quickly. "I shouldn't have deleted anything without asking. Please don't be angry."
He shook his head. "I'm not angry." But something in his tone suggested otherwise.
I walked over to his desk and returned his phone, my fingers lingering on the smooth surface for just a moment. Thank goodness I deleted it in time, I thought.
I need to act fast now.
I placed my hands on Sean's shoulders. "How's work going today?"
"Making progress," he replied quietly.
I began massaging his shoulders, feeling the tension in his muscles. Though his body remained stiff under my touch, he didn't pull away.
I pressed my body against his back, my curves molding to his shoulders. My fingers slipped beneath his collar, a gesture that had once been welcome, expected even.
But Sean stepped away, polite but firm. "We should focus on the proposal."
To break the awkward silence, I managed a casual smile. "Let me get you some coffee."
Once outside his office, anger and frustration washed over me. I know when a man truly loves a woman, he never rejects her touch.
Yet yesterday in the car, he stopped my wandering hands. And just now, when I was clearly inviting him to kiss me, touch me, even... he pulled away again.
I checked my reflection in the break room mirror. The woman staring back at me was still beautiful, still seductive. I had absolute confidence in my allure - few men could resist my charms.
Sean must just be exhausted! Of course he loves me!
After this little pep talk, I picked up his coffee and headed back to his office. We were the only ones left on the floor now. This was my chance!
"Your favorite blend," I said, placing the coffee on his desk.
He took a sip and nodded. "It's good."
I leaned against his desk, deliberately casual. "Remember how we used to share coffee at that little café near Harvard? Those morning study sessions..."
But Sean's mind seemed elsewhere. "Angela doesn't like coffee," he said suddenly. "She always prefers tea."
Before I could respond, he pulled out his phone and dialed.
"Sarah? Make Angela some cinnamon tea." His voice softened when mentioning her name.
Rage and jealousy coursed through me. Here I was, trying to create an intimate moment, and he was thinking about her? About her drink preferences?
Sean glanced at his watch, not noticing the shift in my expression. "It's getting late. I'll have the driver take you home."
"I thought maybe we could..." I let the suggestion hang in the air, heavy with possibility.
"Christina." His voice was gentle but firm. "It's been a long day."
The dismissal was clear, though couched in politeness.
I straightened, adjusting my dress with fingers that wanted to shake. "Of course. Don't work too late."
As Sean walked me to the elevator, my mind was racing. I had to find a way to keep him with me tonight. If he went home, Angela would tell him about the pregnancy.
What could I do?
When we reached the steps at the building entrance, an idea suddenly struck me.
I deliberately caught my heel on the edge of a step and let myself fall, crying out in pain.
"Christina!" Sean rushed to my side, helping me up. "Are you alright?"
I collapsed into his arms, feigning weakness. "I think I twisted my ankle... I'm not sure if it's broken."
"Hospital," Sean immediately instructed the waiting driver. Then he lifted me into his arms and carried me to the car.
As he settled me into the backseat, I allowed myself a small smile. The pain would be worth it.
Angela, you will never win!
###chapter 13: He's Having Shower In My Bathroom
Angela POV
The cinnamon tea Sarah had just brought steamed gently in my hands, its usually comforting aroma now seeming to mock me.
Her words still echoed in my mind: "Mr. Shaw won't be coming home tonight."
I stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of our penthouse, watching the city lights flicker against the darkening sky.
My phone sat silent on the marble windowsill, its screen dark and unresponsive, just like Sean after my message.
Had he seen it?
The words that should have changed everything: "I'm pregnant."
The tea's warmth seeped through the delicate china cup into my palms, but it did nothing to dispel the chill that had settled in my chest.
Sean had asked Sarah to make this tea specifically for me. Now it felt like another cruel joke. He could remember my favorite tea but couldn't bother to respond to news of his child.
The phone remained stubbornly silent. I touched my still-flat stomach, each passing minute making the weight of my unspoken secret feel heavier.
Stop it, I told myself firmly. You're acting like a lovesick teenager, not the independent woman you're supposed to be.
But the thoughts came anyway, unwanted and unstoppable.
Where was he?
The possibilities of his silence tormented me.
I took a sip of the tea, but its sweetness had turned bitter on my tongue. My fingers hovered over Sean's number. I wanted to call him, to demand an explanation for his silence.
But what right did I have?
We were nothing more than a business arrangement, and my pregnancy announcement might seem like a desperate attempt to save a marriage that was never real.
My last shred of dignity wouldn't allow me to appear so eager, so invested in something he had already decided to end.
When my phone finally lit up near midnight, my heart leaped - only to plummet when I saw it was Sean's number but heard Christina's voice.
"Angela? I hope I didn't wake you." Her tone was perfectly modulated, dripping with false concern.
 "I just wanted to let you know that Sean will be staying at my place tonight. He's... having a shower."
The implication in her pause was clear as crystal. My hand instinctively moved to protect my stomach, as if I could shield our unborn child from the truth of its father's choices.
"You don't need to call specially to inform me," I said, my voice cold and controlled. "Whether Sean comes home at night, or who he's with - none of that concerns me."
"I know you haven't been feeling well," Christina continued, her voice honey-sweet with venom. "So I thought it best to let you know not to wait up. Doctor's orders, you know."
The tea cup clattered against its saucer as my hands began to shake.
"Thank you for letting me know," I managed, my voice surprisingly steady despite the storm raging inside.
"Of course, darling. That's what friends are for."
As soon as the call ended, my phone buzzed again. A photo from Christina loaded on the screen. 
It showed a man showering, naked, his broad back and undeniably sexy hips framed by the steam. Even without seeing his face, I knew instantly - it was Sean. 
I barely made it to the bathroom before the nausea hit.
I told him I was pregnant. His response? He went to fuck another woman. 
Yes, his actions screamed it loud and clear: he didn't want my child. He wanted to have a baby with Christina!
The marble floor was cool against my skin as I sat there, one hand still protectively curved around my abdomen.
***
Sleep was impossible. I wandered the penthouse like a ghost, watching the city's lights dim as dawn approached. When my phone rang again at first light, it was Sophie's name that appeared on the screen.
"I've been thinking about our coffee shop conversation," she said without preamble. "Did you tell him?"
I laughed, the sound hollow even to my own ears. "Oh yes, I told him. Want to know how he responded? By fucking Christina."
"What? Angela, are you sure-" Sophie paused. "I know Sean isn't this heartless. Even if he doesn't see you as a real wife, how could he possibly...? There must be some misunderstanding."
"She called to tell me herself," I said, the words tasting like ash in my mouth. "And then she sent me a photo of him showering at her place. He was too 'indisposed' to come to the phone."
Sophie's sharp intake of breath carried clearly through the line. "That bastard. I'll kill him."
"Don't bother." I moved to the window, watching the sun begin to paint the sky in shades of pink and gold. "I've made my decision."
"Angela..."
"I'm getting an abortion."
"What?!"
The words hung in the air between us, heavy with finality. I could almost see Sophie's expression - the shock, the protest forming on her lips.
"You can't be serious," she finally managed. "This is your baby - your child!"
"A child whose father chose to fuck another woman after learning of its existence." My voice was surprisingly calm. "I won't bring a baby into this world just to watch it be rejected by its father."
"You're not thinking clearly. This is the shock talking-"
"I've already made the appointment." I cut her off, knowing if I let her continue, my resolve might waver.
"Angela, please. Just wait-"
"Promise me you won't tell anyone." I pressed my forehead against the cool glass of the window. "Not Sean, not Elizabeth, no one."
###chapter 14: He Carried Her Into The Restaurant
Angela POV
Morning light filtered through the penthouse windows, casting long shadows across the hardwood floors.
My phone buzzed for the third time - Sophie, again. I'd been avoiding her calls since our conversation at dawn, but she was nothing if not persistent.
Finally, I answered. "Sophie, please..."
"Just hear me out." Her voice carried that fierce protectiveness I'd known since our college days. "You're not thinking clearly. Even if these two years of marriage mean nothing, you and Sean were classmates since primary school. Doesn't that count for something?"
I cut her off, my voice carefully controlled. "Sophie, don't. Please."
The silence stretched between us, heavy with all the things she wanted to say. Finally, she sighed. "I hate seeing you like this."
"I'm fine." The words came automatically, a shield I'd perfected over the past two years.
"No, you're not. And that's okay. You don't have to be strong all the time."
"I have to go," I said quietly. "Work's waiting."
***
The Shaw Group offices hummed with their usual morning energy, but today it felt like every eye followed my movements, every whispered conversation died as I passed.
I locked myself in my office, pulling up investment reports that needed reviewing.
I typed "Hospital OB-GYN" into my browser. The appointment system loaded, looking at next week's slots.
Should I really give up this child? The thought came unbidden.
But what's the alternative? Let them grow up carrying the stigma of being unwanted? Watch them reach for a father who's already chosen another family?
A knock at my door made me quickly close the browser. Emily entered with a stack of files, her usual efficient smile in place.
"The Lawrence Capital merger documents," she said, placing them on my desk. Then she hesitated. "How are you feeling? After the other day, when you fainted..."
"I'm fine."
"Mr. Shaw was so worried," she continued. "I've never seen him like that. He dropped everything - even cut short the Hong Kong conference call - the moment he heard you'd collapsed."
"He spent the entire day with Christina yesterday, didn't he?" My voice was cool, controlled.
Emily's smile faltered. She shifted uncomfortably, suddenly very interested in straightening the already perfectly aligned files. "I should get back to work."
I returned to the hospital website. The cursor blinked over next week's slots.
I clicked "Confirm."
***
"Lunch?" Nathan appeared in my doorway just before noon, his golden curls catching the sunlight. "You've been staring at that screen for hours."
I started to refuse, but remembered how he'd covered for me yesterday while I was... indisposed. "Give me five minutes."
He took me to an elegant restaurant hidden away on a quiet street.
"Here." He placed an elegant silver box on the table. "For you."
Inside was an assortment of herbal supplements, each carefully labeled. "You need to take better care of yourself," he said softly. "For those of us who still care about what happens to Angela Wilson."
The gentleness in his voice made my throat tight. "Nathan..."
"The loyalty we shared at Wilson Bank - that doesn't just disappear." He reached across the table, his hand warm on mine. "No matter what name you're using now."
I watched Nathan as he studied the menu. With his talent and background, he could have had his pick of positions at any top firm. I knew he'd chosen Shaw Group because of me.
I used to see him as just an arrogant boy, an immature younger brother figure. But these past two years had proven me wrong - he'd grown into someone far more capable, more caring than I'd ever expected.
"You're very gentle, Nathan. Your future wife will be very happy," I said, trying to keep my tone light.
"Of course she will." His response was immediate, confident.
"So, anyone special in your life lately?"
He gave me a long, meaningful look. "No one."
"Really? There are so many beautiful young women at the company. None of them catch your eye?"
A slight smile played at his lips. "The best one's already been taken."
His words left me speechless.
I managed an awkward smile, grateful when the waiter arrived with our first course. "The foie gras looks good," I said quickly, desperate to change the subject.
But before Nathan could respond, movement outside the window caught my eye.
A car pulled up, and Sean stepped out. He turned to help Christina, wrapping his arms around her waist and lifting her from the car as if she weighed nothing. Her gorgeous dress caught the sunlight as her laughter floated through the windows.
He carried her towards the restaurant entrance, cradling her against his chest like something precious.
Sean didn't notice me, but Christina did. Her eyes found mine through the window, and she flashed a triumphant smile.
Then, deliberately, she tightened her arms around Sean's neck, pressing her face against his throat in what looked like an intimate kiss.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
The Sean I knew had always been reserved, polite, careful about public displays of affection. This man who let a woman hang all over him in broad daylight - he was like a stranger to me.
"Angela?" Nathan's voice snapped me back to reality. "You're spacing out."
He followed my gaze, his expression darkening when he spotted Sean and Christina.
"How could he do this?" Nathan's voice was tight with anger. "So... are those office rumors true?"
I looked up. "What rumors?"
"I heard some gossips at the office today talking about Christina and Sean being together." He hesitated, watching my reaction carefully.
"It doesn't matter," I said quietly. "What people say about me has never mattered."
"That's not true and you know it." Nathan's voice carried an edge of frustration. "Why are you still protecting him? After everything..."
"I'm not protecting anyone." But even as I said it, my hand drifted to my stomach.
Nathan's eyes followed the movement, something like understanding dawning in his expression.
"Angela..." His voice softened. "Is there something you need to tell me?"
I pulled my hand away quickly. "No."
Through the window, I could see Sean helping Christina into her chair, his hand lingering on her shoulder.
"You deserve better than this," Nathan said quietly. "Better than watching your husband parade around with his... whatever she is."
"She's his soulmate." The words tasted bitter. "The girl who saved his life, who holds his heart."
"Who showed up conveniently just when his family needed a society marriage?" Nathan cut in. "Who disappeared to Paris the moment you and Sean were married, only to return now that Elizabeth's surgery is approaching? Don't you think that's a bit too perfectly timed?"
I stood abruptly, unable to bear another moment of watching Sean and Christina's intimate lunch. "I need to get back to the office."
Nathan caught my arm as I turned to leave.
"Just... promise me you won't make any major decisions without talking to someone first. Someone who actually has your best interests at heart."
Nathan's eyes held mine , his expression unreadable.
"When were you planning to tell me?"
###chapter 15: Words Left Unsaid
Angela POV
My heart stopped. Had he somehow discovered the pregnancy?
The thought sent a wave of panic through me, making the crystal water glass in my hand tremble slightly.
"Christina's been back for over a week," he continued, his voice gentle but firm. "And the divorce... I had to hear about it all through office gossip. Angela, why keep all this from me?"
Relief flooded through me, followed immediately by guilt. Nathan had always been honest with me, yet here I was, keeping the biggest secret of my life from him.
"It wasn't intentional," I managed, setting down my glass carefully. "Everything's been happening so fast..."
"Like old times, isn't it?" His smile held a touch of nostalgia. "Remember those last days at Wilson Investment? The way we fought together, trying to save what we could?"
I did remember. Nathan had been barely twenty then, the youngest trader we'd ever hired, and the only one who stayed loyal through Wilson Investment's collapse.
I reached across the table and grabbed his hand. "Thank you, Nathan."
The sincerity in his voice made my throat tight. For a moment, I was tempted to tell him everything - about the pregnancy, about Sean's silence, about the impossible choice ahead of me. Nathan would understand. He might even help me figure out what to do.
But then I imagined his reaction. Nathan's protective instincts had only grown stronger over the years. If he knew I was carrying Sean's child, he would definitely get into a fight with Sean.
"Angela?" His voice pulled me back to the present. "Whatever's going on, you know I'm here, right? No matter what happens, I'll always be your strongest backup."
"I know." I managed a smile. "And I'm more grateful than you know."
"Then trust me enough to tell me what's really wrong." His eyes searched my face. "You've been different lately. Distracted. Is it the divorce? Or is there something else?"
Just then, both our phones buzzed. Emily was calling an emergency board meeting at 2 PM.
"We need to get back," After hanging up, we said in unison.
We caught each other's eyes and shared a laugh at our synchronicity.
***
The Shaw Group boardroom buzzed with tension when we arrived.
Sean stood at the head of the table, his presence commanding as ever. Apparently, he had cut short his lunch with Christina.
His eyes flickered briefly to where Nathan held the door for me, something hard and unreadable crossing his features.
The room erupted in murmurs as Sean began to speak about the Lawrence Capital deal.
"Angela." Sean's voice cut through the chaos. "You'll head the revised proposal team. We need a new framework by end of week."
"I'd like to join that team," Nathan spoke up immediately. "Given my experience with similar acquisitions at Wilson Investment-"
"Approved." Sean cut him off, his tone clipped. "Though some of us might question whether experience from a failed bank is relevant here."
I felt Nathan stiffen beside me.
The reminder of Wilson Investment's collapse was a deliberate jab, the kind of casual cruelty Sean rarely displayed in public.
"At least at Wilson Investment," Nathan's voice carried clearly across the room, "we knew how to properly care for our key personnel's health and wellbeing."
The implied criticism hung in the air. Several board members shifted uncomfortably, no doubt remembering my recent fainting spell.
Sean's jaw tightened, but his voice remained perfectly controlled. "Your concern for Mrs. Shaw's welfare is noted, Nathan. Though perhaps misplaced, given that she is, in fact, Mrs. Shaw."
The emphasis on my married name made something twist in my chest. How dare he stake his claim now, after spending the night with Christina? After ignoring my message about our child?
The meeting finally drew to a close. When it finally ended, Nathan touched my elbow gently.
"Dinner?" he asked, his voice deliberately pitched to carry. "We should discuss the proposal timeline."
I saw Sean's shoulders tense, his hand pausing in the act of gathering his papers.
"Actually," Sean's voice was arctic, "I need to speak with Angela privately. Nathan"
Nathan hesitated, clearly reluctant to leave me alone with Sean. "I'll wait outside,"
The boardroom emptied slowly, leaving Sean and me in a silence that felt charged with all our unspoken words.
"You and Nathan seem close," he said finally, still not looking at me.
"He's a valuable colleague."
"Is that all?"
"You spent the night with Christina," I said instead of answering. "I don't think you have the right to question my relationships with colleagues."
"She fell on the office steps," Sean's voice softened slightly. "Twisted her ankle badly. I had to take her to the emergency room."
"And staying the night was medically necessary?"
His jaw tightened. "Angela-"
His phone rang, Christina's name lighting up the screen. Of course. Her timing was always impeccable.
Sean glanced at the phone, then back at me. Something flickered in his eyes - regret? Frustration? But he answered anyway, turning slightly away as he spoke.
"Yes... No, don't try to walk on it yet... I'll have Peter bring the car around..."
I gathered my things, preparing to leave. Whatever he'd wanted to say to me clearly wasn't as important as Christina's needs.
"Wait." He caught my arm as I passed, his hand warm through the silk of my blouse. "Transfer the Lawrence project to Nathan."
"What? But you just assigned-"
"You're taking a leave of absence. Starting tomorrow."
"I don't need-"
"This isn't a suggestion." He said, "It's an order. You're clearly not well, and I won't have you collapsing again."
"Sean." I hesitated, my heart pounding. "Did you... did you get my message last night?"
His phone rang again before he could answer. Christina, again.
"Take the rest," he said, already turning away. "That's final."
I walked out of his office, my question still unanswered, the weight of all our unspoken words pressing down like lead in my chest.
Nathan waited by my office, concern etched on his features, but I couldn't bear his kindness right now.
"I need some air," I managed, heading for the elevator.
Sean must have seen my message from last night.
This sudden forced leave... was it his way of giving me time? Time to quietly get rid of the baby?
Otherwise, there was no reason for him to insist on my taking leave right now.
###chapter 16: Just An Accident
Angela POV
"You can't go through with this alone," Sophie said, her voice barely above a whisper as we sat in our usual corner at Bluestone Lane. Her fingers wrapped around her untouched cappuccino, knuckles white with tension.
"Let me come with you."
I stared into my cup of milk, watching the steam rise in delicate spirals. "The appointment's set for Wednesday morning."
"Angela..." Sophie reached across the table, her manicured fingers closing over mine. "I can't believe this," Sophie's voice shook with anger.
 "If he never saw you as a real wife, why would he let this happen? I'm not saying you two couldn't have sex, but he should have thought about the consequences. He should have taken precautions!"
I felt my face flush hot with embarrassment. "He did use protection. I didn't expect this to... I mean, we were careful."
Sophie's eyes flashed with renewed fury. "And now he's just letting you go through with this? Does he have any idea what an abortion does to a woman's body? The physical and emotional toll?" She gripped her cup so tightly I thought it might shatter. "How can he be so heartless, pushing you into this decision?"
I fell silent, words failing me. Deep down, I knew Sophie was right about everything. My eyes grew wet with tears I'd been holding back for so long. Only with her could I let my guard down like this, let the carefully maintained facade crack to reveal the raw pain underneath.
Sophie reached across the table and gripped my hand tightly. "Don't be afraid," she said softly. "I'll be right here with you. Always."
***
Flashback
This pregnancy was an accident. 
Just like that crazy night two month ago - it was all just an accident.
After our marriage, I moved into Sean's luxury penthouse apartment. The master bedroom was mine. Sean would only move in from his office-bedroom when Elizabeth came to visit. On those nights, we'd share the bed with a wall of pillows between us.
But after that charity gala, we crossed the line we'd drawn.
That night, Sean and I attended Elizabeth's charity gala together. I stood beside him, wearing a carefully chosen midnight blue gown that perfectly matched his navy suit.
The evening had been a triumph. Elizabeth's annual charity gala attracted Manhattan's oldest money, and I'd navigated the social minefield flawlessly. 
Even Victoria Pierce, who'd delighted in spreading rumors about Wilson Bank's collapse, had been forced to acknowledge my presence with more than a cold nod.
"You were magnificent tonight," Sean murmured as we rode the elevator to our penthouse. "Grandmother couldn't stop smiling."
Perhaps it was the champagne, or the lingering high of social victory, but I found myself smiling back. "We make a good team."
Sean studied me for a long moment in the car's dim interior. Then, without warning, he leaned across the space between us and kissed me.
This wasn't the carefully rehearsed affection we performed for prying eyes-it was raw, unfiltered, and ravenous. 
His kiss was fierce, his tongue slipping past my lips with a hint of tobacco and whiskey, claiming me with an urgency that set my pulse racing.
His hands found my hair, fingers threading through the strands and tugging with a rough edge, unraveling the perfect updo I'd spent hours crafting. 
Strands fell messily around my face, but I couldn't care less-I was lost in the heat of him. 
We stumbled through the penthouse door, barely making it inside before his touch consumed me. 
His palms roamed my spine, tracing every curve with deliberate pressure, sending shivers cascading through me. 
When his thumbs brushed over my breasts, kneading with a teasing rhythm, a needy ache bloomed deep within me, drawing a soft whimper from my lips.
His mouth charted a blazing path along my collarbone, each kiss a spark that ignited my skin as he worked his way down my body.
The rough scrape of his stubble grazed the tender flesh of my inner thigh, and a molten warmth radiated from my core, intense and overwhelming. 
The burning ache between my legs grew unbearable, forcing me to press my thighs together, the friction coaxing out a quiet moan. 
I needed him. 
The only thing I wanted was having him between my legs, whether it was his hand, face, or cock.
His hand slipped around to my back, gripping my ass with possessive strength as he lifted me from the couch. 
My legs parted instinctively, and he settled between them, his body a solid, grounding weight. 
His breath was hot against my skin as he shifted, and then I felt him-his cock sliding against my slick, aching entrance. 
A loud, unrestrained moan tore from my throat, 
"Sean" 
I knew this might be the first time-or the last. 
But in that moment, rules meant nothing, and I surrendered completely to the reckless fire between us.
"I'm sorry about last night," Sean had said the next morning, his voice uncharacteristically hesitant as he straightened his tie. "I had too much champagne. It was a mistake - it shouldn't have happened."
I'd kept my face carefully blank, though something in my chest felt like it was bleeding. 
"We both had too much to drink," I said softly. "Of course."
He'd pulled out his phone, fingers moving across the screen with businesslike efficiency. "I've transferred funds to cover any... potential complications."
The notification pinged on my phone - a sum large enough to buy a small apartment. The perfect price tag for a moment of weakness.
"I don't want your money." My voice came out steadier than I felt. "It was just sex. Adults have needs - you don't need to apologize for that."
"Take it anyway." His expression was unreadable.
I wanted to scream, to cry, to beg him to admit that at least for that one night, he had truly felt something for me. That in those desperate moments on the sofa, his heart had raced for me the way mine had for him.
Instead, I'd smiled my perfect corporate wife smile. "As you wish, Mr. Shaw."
He'd left without another word, and we'd never spoken of that night again. In the weeks that followed, we carefully maintained our distance, treating each other like polite strangers sharing the same space.
Only Elizabeth's worsening condition forced us to maintain some semblance of connection. The upcoming heart surgery required a united front, a show of family stability. 
***
Three days later, Sophie called me in the morning.
"Angela, are you ready? I'll pick you up at 9," she said softly. "We can have breakfast together first."
###chapter 17: Secrets in The Surgery Wing
Angela POV
"I'm ready," I told Sophie over the phone. "See you in thirty minutes."
It had been three days since our coffee shop conversation. After my sleepless night, I felt both exhausted and strangely calm. The decision was made - there was no point in tormenting myself anymore.
When Sophie arrived at our penthouse, Sean was just stepping out of his private study.
"Going somewhere?" Sean's eyes moved between Sophie and me.
"None of your business." Sophie's voice could have frozen the Hudson.
Sean's jaw tightened. "Angela hasn't been well. She should be resting at home, not going out."
"Oh, now you care about her health?" Sophie's laugh was brittle.
"Have you ever wondered why she's not well? She was on the gymnastics team in college, remember? The healthiest girl I knew. But look at her now - she's lost so much weight since marrying you, getting weaker by the day. Is this how the great Shaw family takes care of its own?"
I felt my heart rate spike. Sophie had been furious since I told her about my plans, and now I could see that anger bubbling to the surface. One wrong word about the pregnancy, and everything would fall apart.
"That's enough." I cut in, my voice sharper than intended. "We're going to be late."
I practically dragged Sophie toward the elevator, feeling Sean's gaze boring into my back. Only when we were safely in Sophie's Mercedes did I let out the breath I'd been holding.
"He deserved worse," Sophie muttered, pulling into traffic with more force than necessary. "The way he's treating you-"
"Please," I interrupted. "I can't... I can't think about him right now."
***
The private clinic was hidden in an elegant suburban mansion, with only a small brass plaque marking its presence. Everything about it spoke of discretion and luxury.
"Why here?" Sophie asked quietly. "We could have gone to New York-Presbyterian or Mount Sinai. They have the best facilities."
"Too many familiar faces." I stared at my perfectly manicured hands, focusing on keeping them steady. "Elizabeth's entire social circle practically lives at those hospitals' charity boards."
The receptionist called my name - my real name, not Mrs. Shaw - and led us to a private consultation room. The doctor was younger than I expected, with kind eyes and a gentle manner.
"Two month along," she confirmed, reviewing my paperwork. "The procedure is relatively simple at this stage. We can schedule it for-"
"Today," I cut in. "It needs to be today." I couldn't bear to drag this out any longer.
The doctor's eyes flickered between Sophie and me. "There's a mandatory waiting period-"
"I understand the risks. I've made my decision."
Sophie's phone buzzed, breaking the tension. She glanced at it, frowning, then declined the call. Seconds later, it buzzed again.
"Take it," I said softly. "It might be important."
"Nothing's more important than-"
"Sophie." I managed a small smile. "I'll be fine for a few minutes."
After Sophie left, I went to the restroom. The corridor was filled with well-dressed women, barely any men in sight. Everyone kept to themselves, lost in their own thoughts. The silence spoke volumes - each woman here carried her own secret, her own burden.
My hand drifted to my still-flat stomach. I'm sorry, I thought. I'm so sorry.
"Angela? Is that you?"
The voice made my blood run cold. I turned to find Rachel Miller - Shaw family friend, society gossip, and Elizabeth's bridge partner - standing in the doorway.
"Rachel." I forced my features into a polite smile. "What a surprise."
"Isn't it just?" Her perfectly lined eyes swept over my figure. "I never expected to see you here, of all places. Nothing serious, I hope? Nothing that the Shaw family lawyers should know about?"
"I'm just accompanying a friend," I said calmly.
"Oh?" Rachel's perfectly lined eyes narrowed. "I don't see any friend with you. You know, Elizabeth always speaks so highly of you... I hope you're not keeping any secrets from her?"
Anger flared in my chest. "Mrs. Miller, be careful with your accusations. I could sue you for defamation."
Rachel's expression quickly shifted to a practiced smile. "Dear, I was just joking. Why so defensive? Unless you're-"
Before she could finish, a young girl emerged from one of the consultation rooms. My heart stopped - it was Rachel's daughter, Jessica. She looked pale, clutching what appeared to be a medical report.
"Mom?" Jessica's voice trembled slightly when she saw Rachel.
The color drained from Rachel's face. Mother and daughter stared at each other, the air thick with unspoken words.
I could guess why Jessica was here - she must be pregnant too. While I usually had no interest in other people's private affairs, I felt compelled to speak before Rachel could leave.
"Rachel," I said in a low voice. "Don't tell anyone about seeing me here today."
I knew her gossiping nature well, and how she always competed with Elizabeth behind the scenes. But Rachel's lips curled into a sneer.
"Who do you think you are to threaten me?"
"I'm sure you wouldn't want anyone to know about Jessica's pregnancy either," I replied coolly. "She's only just started college, isn't she? And not married..."
Rachel's face contorted with rage before she stormed off, practically dragging Jessica with her.
Sophie returned shortly after, leading me to the reception desk to handle the pre-procedure paperwork. As we waited, raised voices caught my attention. In the corner of the waiting area, Rachel and Jessica were having a heated argument.
"You can't keep this baby!" Rachel's voice was shrill despite her attempt to keep it down. "That boy is penniless - he'll never be able to give you the life you deserve!"
"But we're in love!" Jessica's eyes were brimming with tears. "I want to keep this baby. It's a living being - your grandchild! How can you be so cruel?"
Before Rachel could respond, Jessica turned and ran out of the clinic, leaving her mother standing there helplessly. Their argument left me unsettled, stirring up the doubts I'd been trying so hard to suppress.
A sudden scream from the operating floor above made me flinch, the sound cutting through the artificial calm of the waiting room.
As the chaos of emotions threatened to overwhelm me, my phone buzzed with a text message. I opened it:
"Angela, I need to see you. Just the two of us. We need to talk. -Christina"
###chapter 18: An Unexpected Meeting
Angela POV
Moments later, Christina sent the meeting address: La Bohème Café on Madison Avenue. 2 PM. -Christina
Sophie glanced at the message and cursed. "She has some nerve! After everything... Angela, you can't seriously be considering meeting her?"
"I have to know what she wants."
"What she wants?" Sophie's laugh was bitter. "She wants your husband, your life, everything you've built these past two years. Did Sean tell her about the baby? Is that why she's suddenly so eager to talk?"
I moved my hand to my stomach. "I don't know if Sean told her about the pregnancy."
Just then, a nurse approached us. "Mrs. Shaw, I'm sorry, but all surgeries are fully booked today. You'll need to make another appointment."
For some reason, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. Sophie seemed pleased too.
"Maybe it's fate," Sophie said softly. "Maybe you should think about this a bit more." She looked at my pale face. "Come on, I'll drive you home. You need rest."
***
Back home, I lay in bed trying to rest, but my mind kept wandering. The scene I'd witnessed at the clinic earlier kept replaying in my thoughts - Jessica Miller's tearful defense of her unborn child.
Lying there, I couldn't stop thinking about what I'd witnessed at the clinic. The words kept echoing in my mind: "This is a life... this is a life..."
For the first time, I truly let myself feel the reality of the life growing inside me. Not just a problem to be solved, but a baby. My baby. Sean's baby.
"Angela?" Sophie's voice pulled me back to the present. "Promise me you won't meet with Christina alone. Whatever she has to say, she can say it with witnesses present."
"Don't worry, Sophie. I'll be fine," I assured her with a small smile. "Thank you for everything today."
Sophie hesitated for a moment, clearly concerned, but finally nodded and left.
After she left, my phone kept ringing non-stop. I glanced at the screen - all unknown numbers. I knew it must be Christina. Without bothering to answer any of them, I turned off my phone.
I was exhausted and drifted off to sleep without realizing it. A knock at the door woke me up. Looking out the window, I could see it was already afternoon. I opened the door to find Sarah standing there.
"Mrs. Shaw? Miss Jordan is here to see you. She... she's quite insistent."
Of course Christina would show up unannounced. This was her style - forcing situations, demanding attention. I took a deep breath. "Show her to the living room. I'll be right there."
When I entered the living room, Christina was standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking impeccable as always in an elegant white dress. She turned with practiced grace, a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes already in place.
"Angela, darling. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice."
Sarah walked in with a plate of freshly cut fruits, while Christina brought over an iced coffee from the kitchen.
"Thank you, Sarah," Christina smiled with a sense of superiority. "I must say, Angela, you've trained the maid quite well. When I move in, it'll save me the trouble of finding new household staff."
Her tone made my stomach turn - she was already acting like she owned the place, like she was the rightful mistress of this home.
Just then, Sarah's voice rang out deliberately loud and clear: "Mrs. Shaw, you've only just recovered from your fever. Mr. Shaw specifically emphasized that you shouldn't have anything cold." She turned to me with genuine concern. "Let me brew you some hot tea instead."
I shot Sarah a grateful look, knowing full well she'd said that intentionally for Christina's benefit. Sarah had been with the Shaw family for years, and her loyalty meant more to me than she knew.
Christina's face darkened momentarily at this reminder of Sean's care for me, but she quickly masked it with another practiced smile.
"Shall we move to the terrace? The view is lovely this time of day."
Her words made my chest tighten - she knew this apartment's layout intimately, had probably spent countless hours here before I moved in. 
It was a subtle power play, and I knew exactly what she was doing.
"I believe this will make things easier for everyone," Christina said softly, pulling out an envelope and holding it out to me.
"What is this?" I asked, staring at the envelope.
"Why don't you open it and see?" Christina's smile didn't waver.
I opened the envelope with unsteady fingers. Inside was a check from the Jordan Family Medical Foundation.
Three million dollars. The amount was so large it made my breath catch in my throat.
"What exactly is this for?" I barely managed to whisper.
Christina's expression remained carefully neutral. "I think we both know what it's for, Angela. This is me trying to help you do the right thing - for everyone involved."
"The right thing?" My fingers tightened on the check. "And what exactly do you think that is?"
"Come now, Angela. You're an intelligent woman. You must understand that your... current situation... complicates things unnecessarily."
"Say it plainly," my voice had gone ice-cold. "What exactly are you trying to buy?"
Christina sighed, as if explaining something to a particularly slow child. "I'm offering you a clean break. A way to handle this... delicate matter... with dignity."
I looked at her with suspicious eyes. 
Could she know about my pregnancy? My heart started beating faster at the thought.
###chapter 19: Moving Out
Angela POV
Christina stirred her iced coffee with practiced grace, studying me from across the terrace table. 
"I've been so concerned about your future arrangements after the divorce," she said, her voice dripping with artificial warmth. "After all you've done for Shaw Group these past two years, I feel personally responsible for ensuring you're taken care of."
"Just a small token of appreciation. Three hundred dollars should help with the transition."
I stared at the check, a bitter smile tugging at my lips. "Three hundred dollars? Is that how little you think of my contributions?"
"Oh darling, don't misunderstand." Christina's smile remained perfectly fixed. "This is just to thank you for being such a wonderful caretaker of Sean's interests these past two years. Consider it a friendly gesture."
"I appreciate the thought," I said carefully, "but my position at Shaw Group provides more than adequate compensation. I don't need charity."
"Angela, dear." She leaned forward, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "We both know how... precarious corporate positions can be after a divorce. I'm simply trying to help ease the transition."
"My position was earned through merit, not marriage." I met her gaze steadily. "But thank you for your concern."
Christina's perfect composure cracked slightly. "Don't be naive. Once Elizabeth's surgery is over and the divorce is final, how long do you think Sean will want his ex-wife around?"
"That's between Sean and me." I stood, smoothing my skirt. "And definitely not something requiring your financial intervention."
"You're making a mistake." She snatched up the envelope, her manicured fingers crushing the expensive paper. "This offer won't remain open indefinitely."
"Good. Because my answer won't change."
The check landed on the table with enough force to rattle the coffee cups. Dark liquid sloshed over pristine white china.
"You'll regret this." Christina's voice trembled with barely controlled anger. "You had your chance to leave gracefully."
I watched her storm off, her heels clicking against the marble floors with military precision. Only when the elevator doors closed behind her did I allow myself to exhale.
Sarah appeared silently to clean up the spilled coffee. "Shall I bring fresh tea, Mrs. Shaw?"
"No, thank you." I paused. "But I do need your help with something else. Could you start packing my personal belongings?"
Sarah's hands stilled on the cleaning cloth. "Are you going somewhere, Mrs. Shaw?"
"Yes." I managed a small smile. "It's time for a change."
***
Night had fallen by the time Sean returned home.
I looked up from the suitcase I was packing to find him standing in the bedroom doorway, still in his office suit.
"What are you doing?" His voice was carefully neutral, but his eyes fixed on the half-packed suitcase.
"I've found an apartment on 82nd Street," I said, continuing to fold a silk blouse. "I'm moving out tonight."
Sean stepped into the room, his presence filling the space. "Tonight? What brought this on?"
"Your grandmother's surgery is next week. After that, there's no reason to maintain this charade." I closed the suitcase with a decisive click. "I'm also returning these."
I held out an envelope containing the check he'd given me after our night together. "Along with any other... compensation."
"Angela-"
"I don't want your money, Sean. Or Christina's."
His jaw tightened at the mention of her name. "She came to see you?"
"She did." I resumed packing, carefully wrapping my jewelry. "She was quite generous with her appreciation."
"Whatever she offered-"
"Doesn't matter," I cut him off. "I refused."
"The apartment here on Park Avenue," he said after a moment. "It's already in your name. I had it transferred months ago."
I paused, then shook my head. "Thank you, but no. I prefer to make my own way." A faint smile touched my lips. "You should keep this apartment for Christina. She seems quite fond of it."
"You don't have to prove anything. If Christina wants a house, I'll just buy her a new one. No way I'm letting her take your stuff."
"This isn't about proving anything, Sean. It's about choosing my own path forward."
"And where does that path lead?" Something flickered in his expression. "Are you really planning to leave everything behind?"
My hand brushed my stomach briefly before I could stop myself. "My position at Shaw Group remains unchanged. Unless you plan to fire me?"
"Of course not." He ran a hand through his hair - a rare gesture of frustration. "But living alone..."
"I've managed on my own before." I picked up my suitcase. "I'll have the rest of my things moved tomorrow."
Sean stepped forward. "Angela-"
"No." I walked past him, my voice firm. "I'll send someone for the rest of my things tomorrow."
###chapter 20: I never meant to buy you off
Angela POV
Just as I pressed the elevator button, heavy footsteps sounded behind me. Sean's voice cut through the silence.
"Stop."
I didn't turn around, but my grip tightened on the suitcase handle.
Footsteps echoed down the hallway as Sarah hurried toward us, clearly having heard our raised voices. "Mrs. Shaw?" she called out, concern evident in her voice. "Do you need any help?"
I shook my head, forcing a reassuring smile.
"Sarah," Sean's voice was quiet but firm. "I need to speak with my wife privately. Please give us a moment."
Sarah hesitated, her eyes meeting mine with a look of sympathy before she reluctantly turned away, leaving us alone in the tense silence of the hallway.
I let out a soft sigh, then turned to face him with determined eyes. "I've made my decision, Sean."
"Have you?" His voice was closer now. "Or is someone else making it for you?"
Before I could respond, my phone's ringtone shattered the tense atmosphere. Nathan's name lit up the screen. I saw Sean's jaw tighten as he caught sight of the caller ID.
"I should take this," I said quietly.
Sean's expression darkened, but he made no move to stop me as I answered.
"Angela?" Nathan's voice carried clearly in the quiet hallway. "You haven't been to the office for three days. Did something happen? Are you feeling any better?"
I was acutely aware of Sean's presence as I replied, "I'm fine. I'm just taking an extended leave. Thank you for your concern."
"Are you sure? I could bring over some-"
"That won't be necessary," I cut in quickly. "Goodnight, Nathan."
I ended the call, but the damage was done. Sean's eyes had turned to ice.
"Nathan." He practically spat the name. "Calling at this hour to check on your... health?"
"He's a friend who's concerned about my wellbeing." I tried to keep my voice steady. "Nothing more."
Sean moved forward suddenly, taking my suitcase before I could react. "A friend who takes you to intimate lunches? Who calls you at midnight?"
"Give that back." I reached for the suitcase, but he held it easily out of reach.
"Answer me first." His voice dropped dangerously low. "What's really going on between you and Nathan?"
Anger flared in my chest. "You have no right to question my relationships with colleagues. Not when you spent last night with Christina."
"That was different-"
"Was it?" I laughed bitterly. "At least Nathan's concern is genuine. He's not trying to buy me off with insulting checks."
"Christina shouldn't have come to see you alone," Sean's voice tightened. "And she had no right to give you that check. I'll warn her about this."
Something dangerous flashed in Sean's eyes. "She had no right-"
"No?" I cut him off. "Isn't that exactly what you did? Writing checks after our night together, as if I could be bought and paid for?"
Sean moved closer, his tall frame towering over me. The heat radiating from his body made my skin tingle, and for a moment, I was acutely aware of every inch of space between us.
His presence was overwhelming, possessive - reminding me of that one passionate night we'd shared.
"I never meant to buy you off," he said, his voice rough with emotion. "That night..."
I tried to maintain my composure, but suddenly the room started spinning. A wave of dizziness hit me, and I swayed slightly.
"What's wrong?" Sean's anger seemed to evaporate instantly, replaced by concern.
"Nothing." I pressed a hand to my forehead. "I just need to sit down for a moment."
His touch was surprisingly gentle as he guided me to the nearest chair. "You've been like this for days now," he said quietly. "What's really going on, Angela?"
I closed my eyes, unable to meet his searching gaze. My hand drifted unconsciously to my stomach before I caught myself.
"I told you, I'm fine." I started to stand, but he placed a hand on my shoulder, keeping me seated.
"Grandmother could visit any day now," he said suddenly. "With her surgery coming up..."
My resistance faltered at the mention of Elizabeth. The older woman's health was precarious enough without the stress of finding her grandson's wife moved out.
"At least wait until after the surgery," Sean continued, his voice softer now. "If anyone needs to leave... it should be me. This is your home too."
The gentleness in his tone made my throat tight. For a moment, I could almost believe he actually cared.
"Fine," I managed finally. "I'll stay. For Elizabeth's sake."
Without another word, Sean turned and walked out of the apartment, the heavy door clicking shut behind him.
###chapter 21: Whiskey Won't Lie
Sean POV
The door slammed behind me with a satisfying crash that echoed through the penthouse hallway.
I stood there for a moment, waiting - for what, I wasn't sure. Maybe for the sound of hurrying footsteps, for Angela's voice calling my name.
Two years ago, she would have followed.
Would have appeared in the doorway with that mix of concern and stubbornness in her amber eyes, ready to continue whatever argument we were having until we reached some sort of resolution.
But the hallway remained silent.
I pulled out my phone, scanning through the banking alerts that had triggered my initial anger.
Two years of marriage, and Angela hadn't touched a single cent of the money I'd transferred to her account.
Not the monthly allowance, not the "compensation" after our night together, nothing. The balance sat there, untouched, like some sort of silent accusation.
And now she wanted to move out? To get her own apartment? The thought made my blood boil all over again.
The elevator arrived with a soft chime. As I stepped in, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the polished brass - my normally immaculate appearance slightly disheveled, tie loosened, a muscle working in my jaw.
I looked exactly like what I was: a man who'd lost control of a situation he thought he had perfectly managed.
"Metropolitan Club," I told the driver as I slid into the back seat of the waiting town car. Peter nodded silently, already familiar with my preferred destination after difficult days.
As the car pulled away from Park Avenue, my mind drifted back to another time, another version of Angela.
She'd been waiting outside the student council room at Saint Paul's School, her dark hair caught in the winter wind, two cups of coffee steaming in her gloved hands.
"You missed dinner again," she'd said, holding out one of the cups. "The dining hall's closed, but I saved you a sandwich."
Even then, she'd been taking care of me, anticipating my needs before I knew them myself. We were only thirteen, but she already had that quiet strength about her.
When had that changed?
When had she become this stranger who refused my money, who spent lunch hours with Nathan Harrison, who looked at me with such careful distance in her eyes?
Nathan. The thought of him made my hands clench. The way he hovered around Angela's office, always ready with a suggestion or a helping hand. The casual familiarity in his voice when he called her, as if he had any right to check on her wellbeing.
The car turned onto 44th Street, and I pushed the memories away. Tonight wasn't about Angela, or Nathan, or the mess my carefully ordered life had become.
Tonight was about expensive whiskey and the blessed numbness it promised.
William and Evan were already waiting at our usual table.
 "You look like shit," William observed cheerfully, pushing a glass of Macallan 25 across the table. "Trouble in paradise?"
"Angela's trying to move out."I dropped into my seat, loosening my tie further.
"What?" Evan's eyebrows shot up. "I thought you two had an arrangement."
"We do. Did." I took a long swallow of whiskey, letting it burn away the confusion in my chest. "She's found an apartment on 82nd Street. Says she wants to make her own way." The words came out more bitter than I'd intended.
"After everything you've done for her?" William shook his head. "The monthly allowance alone would set most people up for life."
"She hasn't touched it." I signaled for another drink. "Two years of marriage, and she hasn't spent a single cent of what I've given her."
A low whistle from Evan. "Seriously? Not even after... you know, that night?"
My grip tightened on the glass.
That night.
The charity gala, the champagne, the way Angela had felt in my arms - soft and warm and right in a way I didn't want to examine too closely.
The way her body moved in rhythm with my own, and how she moaned at every single sensation that shot through her had me feeling more pleasure than I had ever felt before. I hadn't ever done anything, even remotely as intimate with someone who gave me as much gratification as Angela had.
I fell asleep that night feeling so elated and at peace that I almost forgot about the current status of the world.
It was a very big possibility that I would become completely addicted to her.
But...I knew I can't.
"Not a penny," I confirmed. "Says she doesn't want my charity."
"Has to be Harrison's influence," William muttered. "That upstart from Wilson Investment's been filling her head with ideas about independence."
The mention of Nathan made something dark and ugly twist in my chest. "He called her tonight. At midnight."
"Just a colleague checking on her health?" Evan's tone made it clear exactly what he thought of that excuse.
"She's been different lately," I found myself saying. "Ever since Christina came back..."
"Ah." William and Evan exchanged knowing looks. "How is the good doctor?"
I waved away the question, focusing instead on the amber liquid in my glass. "Angela and I agreed from the start - this marriage was temporary. A business arrangement. Once grandmother's surgery is done..."
"Then why does her moving out bother you so much?" Evan's question cut uncomfortably close to thoughts I'd been avoiding.
"It doesn't." The lie tasted worse than the whiskey. "I just don't understand why she's being difficult about this. We can still be friends after the divorce. Nothing has to change."
William's laugh was sharp. "You really expect your ex-wife to stick around playing best friend while you build a life with Christina? Come on, Sean. Even you can't be that naive."
"Angela's different," I insisted, the words slightly slurred. When had they refilled my glass? "She's always been there. Since we were kids. Through everything. She can't just..."
"Can't just what?" Evan pressed. "Can't just move on? Can't just build her own life? With someone like Harrison, maybe?"
The glass slammed down harder than I'd intended, whiskey sloshing over the sides. "Nathan Harrison is a second-rate trader who got lucky. If he thinks he can-"
"Whoa, easy there." William's hand on my arm was steadying. "Maybe you should slow down."
But the whiskey was doing its job, melting away the careful walls I'd built around certain thoughts. "She used to wait for me," I heard myself saying. "After student council meetings. With coffee. Even in winter. She always... she was always there."
"Sean." Evan's voice was gentler now. "Maybe it's time to admit this isn't just about keeping your grandmother happy anymore."
The room had started to spin slightly, memories blurring together like watercolors.
Angela at thirteen, snowflakes catching in her hair as she waited with coffee.
Angela at twenty-five, in that midnight blue gown at the charity gala, her lips soft and yielding under mine.
Angela yesterday, her hand brushing unconsciously across her stomach as she told me she was moving out.
"Should we call someone?" William's voice seemed to come from very far away. "Christina maybe?"
"No." The word came out sharper than I'd intended. "Not Christina. Don't... don't call anyone."
"What about Angela?" Evan suggested. "She should know you're-"
"No!" I struggled to focus on their faces. "Can't... can't let her see me like this. She'll think..."
But what would she think? What did it matter what she thought? She was leaving anyway, choosing Nathan and independence over the life I'd given her. Over me.
The thought followed me down into darkness as consciousness finally slipped away.
Before consciousness slipped away completely, I heard William's voice drifting through the haze. "Christina's perfect for you, Sean. She's brilliant, sexy - the kind of woman every man dreams of."
He paused before adding, "As for Angela... she's just ordinary. Not even in the same league as Christina."
"Shut up, William," Evan cut in sharply. "This is something Sean needs to figure out for himself."
The last thing I remembered thinking before everything went black was the way Angela used to smile at me, back when we were young and everything was simpler.
###chapter 22: A Late Night Call
Angela POV
Ever since Christina's return, Sean rarely spent his nights at home.
After he stormed out earlier today, I knew he must be with her again. I couldn't understand why he insisted I stay in this apartment, why he was even offering to give me the property.
Didn't he realize how cruel that was?
The one left behind always suffers more, don't they?
I would rather move out on my own, start fresh somewhere new and let these wounds heal faster.
Sarah approached me with her usual quiet efficiency. "Should I help you unpack your suitcase, Mrs. Shaw?"
"No need," I replied softly. "I'm just postponing the move by a few days. I'll be leaving eventually anyway."
Sarah nodded, her eyes holding a mix of understanding and sympathy as she helped carry my suitcase back to my bedroom.
This simple action made me feel like a hotel guest. That's what I had become in this place - a temporary occupant, waiting for checkout time. Even in what had been my home for two years, I was already feeling like a stranger passing through.
My phone buzzed against the marble nightstand, its gentle vibration seeming thunderous in the quiet room.
I hesitated, my heart rate quickening. Would it be Christina again, calling to gloat about another evening with Sean?
The name that appeared on the screen surprised me: Evan White.
I answered on the third ring. "Evan?"
"Angela." His voice carried the careful neutrality I'd come to associate with bad news. "I apologize for calling so late, but... it's Sean."
My fingers tightened on the phone. "What happened?"
"He's at Metropolitan Club. He's had... quite a bit to drink." Evan paused. "More than I've ever seen him drink, actually."
I frowned. In all the years I'd known Sean, I'd never seen him truly drunk. Even at college parties, he'd maintained iron control, never allowing himself to become vulnerable.
"I'm sure Christina can handle it," I said, trying to keep my voice steady.
"Christina isn't here yet," Evan paused. "He's... not himself tonight."
I heard another male voice in the background - William's unmistakable drawl. "I told you we should call Christina. Sean needs Christina right now, not this pretend wife."
"Shut up, William." Evan's sharp rebuke carried clearly through the phone. Then his voice softened as he addressed me again. "Angela, please... I hope you can come take Sean home."
I hesitated. Part of me wanted to refuse, to let Christina handle this like William suggested. After all, wasn't that what Sean wanted?
But another part of me, the part that still cared despite everything, couldn't just leave him like this.
"I'll be there in thirty minutes."
I hung up before Evan could respond, already moving to my closet. I slipped on a black coat over my clothes, not bothering to change into anything more formal.
The keys to my Porsche felt cold in my palm. I could have called Peter, our longtime driver, but something about this moment felt too private for witnesses.
Manhattan's streets were relatively empty at this hour, the usual chaos reduced to a gentle hum.
As I merged onto Fifth Avenue, my mind wandered to earlier that day. Had Sean's uncharacteristic drinking been triggered by Nathan's midnight call?
The thought sent an unexpected warmth through my chest. Could Sean actually be jealous?
A yellow cab swerved suddenly into my lane, forcing me to brake hard. The Porsche's tires squealed against wet pavement, my heart thundering in my chest. I pulled over, hands shaking on the steering wheel.
"Get it together," I whispered to myself. "You're carrying precious cargo now."
The rest of the drive passed in a blur of streetlights and shadow. I found a parking spot on Park Avenue, the cold night air biting through my silk blouse as I walked the remaining block to Metropolitan Club.
The club's entrance was still active despite the late hour, clusters of Wall Street's elite lingering over last drinks and deals.
I was halfway up the marble steps when a familiar figure caught my eye - Christina Jordan, hurrying toward the entrance in four-inch Louboutins, her red hair a flame in the darkness.
"What happened?" Christina's voice carried clearly across the quiet street. "Sean never drinks like this! William, how could you let this happen?"
William West stood in the doorway, his usual smooth charm replaced by genuine concern. "You think we didn't try to stop him? But you know Sean - he doesn't listen to anyone except you."
"Some elite businessmen you all are," Christina scoffed, though her voice held more worry than bite. "Acting like college freshmen."
Before William could respond, Sean appeared in the doorway, his usually immaculate appearance disheveled, tie loose around his neck. He reached for Christina's wrist, his movements uncharacteristically clumsy.
"Sean." Christina's voice softened to that honeyed tone she reserved just for him. "It's alright. I'm here now. Let me take care of you."
My chest tightened as I watched, but then something unexpected happened. Sean's grip suddenly released, his hand falling away as if burned. "Evan," he called out, his voice rough. "Take me home."
I turned away, unable to watch any more of this scene.
The cold night air felt appropriate now, matching the chill that had settled in my chest. I'd been foolish to come, to think that Sean might need me. Even drunk, he knew exactly who he wanted - and didn't want - by his side.
"Christina." William's voice followed my retreat. "Don't take it personally. He's too drunk to recognize anyone. You know you're the one he really cares about."
"Evan," he called out, his voice rough. "Take me home." "William, why don't you make sure Christina gets home safely?"
"He should come to my apartment," Christina insisted. "I'm a doctor - I can monitor his condition properly."
My steps quick and purposeful as I headed toward my car.
Just as I reached the car, the familiar voice of Evan called out from behind me.
"Angela, is that you?"
I paused for a brief second.
But I didn't turn around. Instead, I slid into the driver's seat and slammed the door shut.
###chapter 23: When the Wrong Name Slips
Sean POV
My head felt like it was being crushed in a vice. Sunlight stabbed through my eyelids, making the pounding even worse.
I forced my eyes open, squinting at an unfamiliar ceiling.
Evan's guest room.
The realization came slowly, along with fragmented memories of last night. Expensive whiskey. William's knowing smirk. Evan's quiet concern. And underneath it all, a gnawing ache that had nothing to do with alcohol.
"Good morning." Evan's voice came from the doorway, followed by the soft clink of glass against wood. "Water and aspirin when you're ready."
I managed to push myself up, ignoring the way the room tilted. "How did I end up here?"
"You insisted." Evan settled into a chair by the window, his expression carefully neutral. "Rather forcefully, actually, when Christina offered to take you to her place."
Christina. The name stirred something in my memory - her voice, heavy with concern, floating through the haze of whiskey. But there had been someone else I'd wanted to see last night. Someone whose absence had felt like a physical wound.
"She was there?" I asked, though I wasn't sure why it mattered.
"Showed up right after you passed out. Quite concerned about your wellbeing." Evan watched me with that penetrating gaze that always saw too much. "William drove her home."
I reached for the water and aspirin, using the movement to avoid his eyes. "I should call her. Thank her for her concern."
"Probably," Evan agreed. "Though you might want to check your other missed calls first."
My phone sat on the bedside table, its screen lit up with notifications. Christina's name appeared several times, along with messages from William.
But it was another name that made my heart stutter - Angela, timestamped 2:47 AM.
"She called?" The words scraped against my dry throat.
"After I reached out to her." Evan's tone was deliberately casual. "She deserved to know you were safe."
Something hot and uncomfortable curled in my chest. "You shouldn't have worried her."
"Shouldn't I? She's still your wife, Sean. And despite what you both pretend, I don't think this marriage is as purely business as you claim."
"It was an arrangement," I said automatically, falling back on the explanation I'd repeated countless times. "For grandmother's sake. Nothing more."
"Really?" Evan leaned forward, his expression serious. "Then why did you keep asking for her last night? Before you passed out completely - you kept saying her name. Not Christina's. Angela's."
My fingers tightened around the water glass. Had I really called for her?
The admission felt dangerous, like acknowledging it might crack open something I'd worked hard to keep contained.
"I was drunk."
"Exactly. And drunk men, as they say, speak sober thoughts." Evan paused, something knowing in his eyes. "She came to the club last night."
The glass froze halfway to my lips. "What?"
"I saw her car in the parking lot. But she never came inside. I think... I think she saw Christina arrive and decided to leave instead."
"That's ridiculous," I snapped, but the words felt hollow. Would she have come if I'd asked? Would she have stayed if Christina hadn't shown up?
A knock interrupted my spiraling thoughts. William's voice carried through the door: "Visitor for the invalid."
Christina swept in before I could respond, looking fresh and perfect in a pale pink sundress.
The sight of her should have sparked something - desire, affection, anything. Instead, I felt my shoulders tense.
"Sean, darling. How are you feeling?"
"I'm fine," I said, my voice sliding into its usual controlled tone. "Thank you for your concern last night."
"Of course." She perched on the edge of the bed, her hand reaching for mine. "I was so worried. You never drink like that."
"I should get home," I said, already moving to stand. "Change before the office."
"You can't possibly be thinking of working today," Christina protested. "You need rest. Doctor's orders."
But I was already reaching for my jacket, needing to escape the suffocating concern in her voice. "I have meetings that can't wait."
"At least let me drive you," she offered. "My car's right outside."
"I'll handle it," Evan cut in smoothly. "We're headed to the same building anyway."
Something flickered across Christina's perfect features - frustration? disappointment? - but her smile never wavered. "Of course. I'll check on you later, Sean."
After she left, I struggled with my tie, my usually steady hands betraying me. Evan watched for several moments before speaking.
"You know, for someone so brilliant at business strategy, you can be remarkably blind about certain things."
"Meaning?"
"Meaning that maybe it's time to ask yourself why you really got drunk last night. Why you kept asking for Angela, not Christina. Why the thought of Angela seeing Christina at the club bothers you so much."
"You're reading too much into this," I said flatly, though something in my chest twisted at his words. 
"Plans change," Evan noted quietly. "People change. Feelings change."
"Not these feelings." But I couldn't meet his eyes in the mirror. "Christina and I... we have history."
"So do you and Angela. Longer history, actually." He moved to help with my mangled tie. "The question is, after all these years, do you actually know what - or who - you really want?"
I stared at my reflection, at the perfectly knotted tie that felt suddenly too tight.
Last night's drinking hadn't been about the Lawrence Capital deal, or grandmother's upcoming surgery, or even Christina's constant presence.
It had been about Angela.
About the way she'd looked at me when I'd forced her to stay in the apartment.
About the pregnancy joke that had felt more like a punch to the gut.
About watching her with Nathan Harrison, seeing the gentle way he touched her hair, the soft concern in his voice when he called.
"I need coffee," I said instead of answering Evan's question. "And the quarterly reports better be on my desk by nine."
###chapter 24: The Day I Lost Everything But My Pride
Angela POV
"You seem different today," Sophie observed, studying me over her untouched cappuccino. "More... settled."
I smiled, surprising myself with how genuine it felt. "I've made my decision."
"About the baby?" Sophie leaned forward, her expression a mix of concern and curiosity.
"I'm keeping it. Whatever happens with Sean, this child is mine."
Sophie's eyes lit up. "Have you thought about names yet?"
"It's too early for that," I laughed, "I need to focus on practical matters first."
"Like where you'll live? You can't stay in that penthouse forever, watching Christina circle like a shark."
"I've been looking at properties in different neighborhoods. Maybe Boston or Chicago. A fresh start, away from Wall Street's gossip mill."
"Or you could join your father," Sophie suggested. "Alexander would love having you - and his grandchild - close by."
The mention of my father brought a flood of memories, taking me back to that day two years ago when everything changed.
***
Flashback
Two Years Ago Wilson Family Townhouse, Greenwich Village
A crowd of creditors had gathered at our house, their angry voices filling the hallways.
"The Monets are family treasures," my father's voice carried from the library, strained but dignified. "They're not part of the bank's assets-"
A crash, followed by the sound of breaking glass. I pushed through the crowd to find my father on the floor, blood trickling from a cut on his forehead where he'd apparently hit the corner of his desk.
"Dad!" I rushed to his side, my phone already out to call an ambulance. But in the chaos, someone knocked it from my hand, the screen shattering against the hardwood floors.
"The Wilsons are finished!" Someone in the crowd shouted. "Where's our money?"
"That's enough." The voice cut through the chaos like a knife through butter. Christina Jordan stood in the doorway, two private security teams flanking her. "Everyone out. Now."
The crowd hesitated, but Christina's next words carried the weight of old money and serious legal threats. "The Jordan family's lawyers will be very interested in any damage done to personal property today."
As the security teams cleared the house, Christina knelt beside us, her medical training evident in the way she examined my father's wound. "He needs stitches. I've already called for a private ambulance."
"We don't need your help," my father managed, trying to stand.
"Dad, please." I squeezed his hand. "Let them help. For your health, if nothing else."
Christina's smile held just a touch of satisfaction. "Of course I'll help. After all, Sean would want me to take care of his... business partner's family."
***
Present Day Bluestone Lane
"Earth to Angela?" Sophie waved her hand in front of my face. "Where did you go just now?"
I blinked, the memory fading. "Just thinking about how much has changed. Two years ago, I thought accepting Christina's help was the only option."
"She played it perfectly," Sophie's voice held barely contained anger. "Swooping in like some avenging angel, making sure everyone knew the Wilsons only survived because of her generosity."
"Dad saw through it immediately." I smiled, remembering his quiet dignity in the ambulance. "He told me not to let gratitude cloud my judgment. That some debts come with too high a price."
"Smart man." Sophie signaled for the check. "Speaking of which, I've been looking at properties too. There's a lovely pre-war building in Boston's Back Bay..."
"Sophie Parker, are you trying to become my real estate agent?"
"I'm trying to be your baby's godmother," she corrected with a grin. "Someone needs to make sure this little one grows up with proper style."
For the first time in weeks, I felt truly light. The path ahead wasn't clear, but at least I knew which direction I was heading.
"First things first," I said, pulling up my calendar. "I need to schedule proper prenatal care, away from the usual Upper East Side practices. The last thing I need is running into Elizabeth's society friends at doctor's appointments."
"Leave that to me." Sophie was already typing furiously on her phone. "I know a brilliant OB-GYN in Greenwich - totally discrete, zero connection to the Shaw social circle."
I watched my best friend's enthusiastic planning with a mixture of amusement and gratitude. The Wilson name might have lost its financial power, but some bonds were worth more than any bank account.
"We sold the townhouse in the end," I said quietly, the memory still bittersweet. "Dad refused to mortgage it for a new venture. Said he'd rather start fresh than risk another collapse."
"You never told Sean about that, did you?" Sophie's voice was gentle. "About selling your childhood home?"
"What would have been the point?" I stirred my cooling tea.
Sophie's expression turned serious. "And now? With the baby?"
"Now..." I touched my stomach, feeling stronger than I had in weeks. "Now I make my own path. Just like Dad did. Without Shaw money, without Jordan 'charity', without compromising what matters most."
"And what matters most?"
I remembered my father telling me after we went bankrupt ,"Never let them make you feel small, princess. Wilson blood runs deeper than Wall Street's billions."
"Dignity," I said finally. "The kind money can't buy and status can't grant. That's what I want to give this child."
Sophie reached across the table, her fingers closing over mine.
"Then that's exactly what we'll do."
###chapter 25: Are You Trying to Make Grandmother Suspicious
Angela POV
Having decided to keep this baby, I felt more emotionally stable than I had in weeks.
After saying goodbye to Sophie, I told Peter, "Let's head home."
"Home?" Peter looked surprised. "But Mrs. Shaw, aren't we supposed to visit Mrs. Elizabeth today? It's Saturday."
The realization hit me like a physical blow. With everything else happening, I'd nearly forgotten our standing sanatorium visits.
"What time is it?" I asked, though I already knew we were cutting it close.
"Just past two, ma'am. Shall I inform Mr. Shaw?"
"No," I said quickly, perhaps too quickly. "He's probably busy with the quarterly reports. I'll go alone."
Peter's expression didn't change, but something in his eyes suggested he understood more than he let on. "I can have the car ready in five minutes."
"That won't be necessary." I reached for my own car keys. "I'll drive myself today."
It was one of the few things I'd kept from my life before the Wilson Bank collapse - a graduation gift from my father that represented independence rather than luxury.
The sanatorium's VIP wing was as luxurious as a five-star hotel, with its private entrance and elite security team.
"Mrs. Shaw." Dr. Thomas Carter's voice carried across the lobby. "Perfect timing. Elizabeth was just asking about you."
"How is she today?" I asked as the elevator climbed smoothly upward.
"Stable. Her numbers are exactly where we want them for the surgery." He paused, then added more softly, "She's been looking forward to your visit. You have a way of brightening her mood that none of us can quite match."
The words sent a fresh wave of guilt through me. In two weeks, Elizabeth would undergo major heart surgery. In two weeks, the countdown to my divorce from Sean would begin. And she had no idea about any of it.
"Angela, darling." Her face lit up as I entered, making her look years younger. "I was beginning to think you'd forgotten your old grandmother today."
"Never." I bent to kiss her cheek. "I brought those macarons you love from Ladurée."
"Always thinking of others." She patted the seat beside her. "Now, tell me everything. How are you feeling? You look a bit pale."
I forced a smile, grateful that morning sickness had given me a reprieve today. "Just busy with work."
"You should rest properly, dear," her sharp eyes studied my face with motherly concern. "A healthy body makes it easier to conceive. I do hope you and Sean are planning for children."
I felt my cheeks warm with embarrassment, unsure how to respond. Before I could gather my thoughts, Elizabeth continued, "Speaking of which, where is Sean today?"
"He's busy with work," I said politely.
Inside, my thoughts turned bitter - he was probably with Christina right now. 
And what were they doing? Perhaps trying to give Elizabeth the great-grandchild she so desperately wanted.
Elizabeth's expression suggested she didn't quite believe me, but she was too well-bred to press the issue. Instead, she gestured to the wheelchair beside her bed. "Would you mind taking me for a turn around the garden? The doctors insist I get some exercise, but they hover so terribly when I walk alone."
We went to the sanatorium's rooftop garden. Elizabeth seemed to enjoy the fresh air as we walked among the flowers.
"You know," she said as we paused by a burbling fountain, "I've been thinking about the future lately."
My hands tightened involuntarily on the wheelchair's handles.
"Oh?"
"Yes. About legacy, about family." She reached back to pat my hand. "About what truly matters in the end."
"Elizabeth-" I started, but she pressed on.
"Let me finish, dear. When Sean first proposed this marriage, I'll admit I had my doubts. Not about you - never about you. But about the circumstances." She sighed softly.
"I worried it might be too much pressure, too much expectation. But watching you these past two years... you've become more than just my grandson's wife. You're the daughter I never had."
Tears pricked at my eyes, and I blinked them back furiously. "I feel the same way," I managed, hating how my voice trembled.
"I know you do, darling. Which is why-"
"Grandmother?"
Sean's voice cut through the peaceful garden atmosphere like a knife.
I turned to find him standing at the garden entrance, impeccable in a charcoal suit - a stark contrast to his drunken state last night.
"Sean." Elizabeth's tone held just a hint of reproach. "How nice of you to join us."
I stepped back from the wheelchair, maintaining careful distance as Sean bent to kiss his grandmother's cheek.
The tenderness in his movements, the warmth in his voice as he greeted her - everything showed how much he truly loved his grandmother. 
In front of Elizabeth, Sean tried to maintain our usual facade of marital affection. He stepped closer, one arm moving to wrap around my waist while he leaned in to kiss me - a familiar performance we'd enacted countless times before.
But today, the thought of his touch made my skin crawl. All I could think about was how he had spent last night in Christina's arms, drunk and vulnerable in a way he'd never allowed himself to be with me.
I smoothly sidestepped, pretending to adjust Elizabeth's blanket, putting deliberate distance between us. His eyes flashed with irritation at my obvious evasion.
I gave Elizabeth a small smile.
"Let me make you some tea."
She nodded, her eyes soft. "You're so thoughtful. Sean is lucky to have you. Marrying you was the best thing that ever happened to him."
I awkwardly chuckled, my gaze drifting toward Sean, hoping to escape his sight for a moment.
Then my phone buzzed in my pocket.
A text from Sean:
"What are you doing? This deliberate distance - are you trying to make grandmother suspicious?"
###chapter 26: A Temporary Truce
Angela POV
Before I could reply, I looked up to find Sean standing before me, his expression unfathomable. He stepped closer and said quietly, "We need to talk."
I glanced at him and set down my teacup. "Go ahead," I said.
"This has to stop," he said, gripping my wrist. "Whatever issues we have, we can't let them affect grandmother right now."
I pulled my hand free, careful to keep my voice low. "I'm well aware of our responsibilities, Sean. I've been managing appearances for two years now."
His jaw tightened. "Then why are you suddenly acting like my touch burns you?"
"Maybe because I'm tired of pretending." The words slipped out before I could stop them. "Tired of playing the perfect wife while you spend your nights with-"
"Don't." His voice carried a warning edge. "Not here."
As if to prove his point, a nurse walked past, her curious glance lingering on our intimate positioning. Sean immediately shifted closer, one arm sliding around my waist in a practiced display of affection.
"Smile," he whispered against my hair. "We have an audience."
I forced my lips to curve upward, even as my body tensed against his chest. This close, I could feel the steady beat of his heart, could smell the faint traces of expensive whiskey still clinging to his clothes from the night before.
I pulled away from his embrace, saying, "Grandmother is waiting for her tea."
I picked up the teacup and headed toward the garden to find her. Sean followed, his arm wrapping firmly around my waist as we walked side by side.
Elizabeth beamed at the sight of us together.
"You two remind me so much of my younger days with your grandfather," she said wistfully. "Such a handsome couple."
Her eyes sparkled with joy, but before she could continue, a nurse came over to inform us it was time for Elizabeth's routine checkup.
We waited outside the examination room, Sean still holding me close.
"You went to the club last night," he said suddenly, his fingers tightening fractionally on my hip. "Evan told me."
I could feel the temperature rising between us, and I tried to pull away from his embrace, but his grip remained firm.
"I didn't go last night," I said quietly.
"You're lying," Sean's voice hardened. "Evan called you, and he saw you there."
"Yes, Evan did call me," I admitted. "But I went to bed early last night. He must have seen someone else. Besides, taking care of you is Christina's responsibility now, not mine. Why would I interfere between you two?"
He finally released me from his grip, saying arrogantly, "Evan called you on his own initiative. I never asked him to call you. And I certainly wasn't expecting you to come pick me up."
Just as our argument was escalating, Dr. Carter opened the examination room door.
"Mr. and Mrs. Shaw?" His expression was carefully neutral. "Could I have a moment?"
Sean's arm stayed around my waist as we followed the doctor to a private waiting area. The room was decorated like an upscale living room, with plush leather chairs and tasteful artwork, but nothing could completely disguise its clinical purpose.
"Elizabeth's latest tests show some concerning developments," Dr. Carter began. "Nothing immediately dangerous, but I believe we should move up the surgery schedule."
"How much sooner?" Sean's voice remained steady, but I felt the tension in his body increase.
"We need to move the surgery up by a week." Dr. Carter glanced between us. "I know it's short notice, but waiting carries unnecessary risks."
A week earlier than planned. The timeline we'd been using to measure our marriage's remaining days had suddenly shortened dramatically.
"Does she know yet?" I asked.
"I thought it best to discuss it with you first." Dr. Carter's smile was sympathetic. "Elizabeth tends to handle such news better when it comes from family."
"We need to tell her together," Sean said finally. "Present a united front."
"Of course."
"Angela..." He ran a hand through his hair, a rare display of frustration. "This isn't about playing parts. Grandmother needs both of us right now."
"I know." My voice softened despite myself. "I won't let her down."
His hand found mine, fingers intertwining with practiced ease. For a moment, I allowed myself to remember how natural this used to feel - the simple comfort of his touch.
"Truce?" he offered quietly. "Just until she's recovered?"
"Truce."
When we returned to Elizabeth's room, she was sitting up in bed, her sharp eyes taking in our joined hands with obvious approval.
"There you are, my dears." Her smile could still light up a room. "Such perfect harmony. I always knew you two were meant for each other."
"You know, I've been thinking about the future lately. About legacy, and what truly matters." Her gaze moved between us, unusually serious. "Promise me something?"
"Anything," Sean said immediately.
"Promise me you'll take care of each other. No matter what happens with this surgery." Her voice carried the weight of years of observation.
 "Life is too short for pride to stand in the way of love."
###chapter 27: Perfect Husband. Perfect Wife. Perfect Lie
Angela POV
My throat tightened as Sean murmured appropriate reassurances.
If only she knew how temporary this peace was, how quickly it would shatter once she was safely through surgery.
"A week isn't long to wait," Elizabeth said when we finally told her about the revised schedule. Though her voice remained steady, I saw fear flicker in her eyes.
Without thinking, I perched on the edge of her bed, taking her fragile hand in mine. "You'll be fine. Dr. Carter is the best, and Sean and I will be right here the whole time."
"My sweet girl." Elizabeth squeezed my fingers. "What would this family do without you?"
Find out soon enough, I thought, but managed to keep smiling. "Let's focus on getting you better first."
As the sun started to set, painting the room in warm golds and pinks, a middle-aged nurse walked in, politely reminding us,
"Your visiting time is almost up. I need to start getting Mrs. Elizabeth's dinner ready soon."
But Elizabeth wasn't ready to let go of our hands, holding on to both me and Sean. So, I suggested, "How about we take Elizabeth home with us tonight? She can stay at our place for the night, and I'll cook."
Elizabeth's face lit up at the idea. But the nurse looked a little hesitant.
After a bit of back-and-forth, Elizabeth insisted, and Sean went to speak to the doctor, asking for permission to discharge her for just one night, promising they'd have a family doctor come by to help look after her.
When Elizabeth heard that, her whole face brightened.
That evening, Sean and I cooked dinner together. Our hands brushed a few times as we moved around the kitchen, and it felt both strange and familiar at the same time.
For some reason, I was reminded of those awkward chemistry lab days back in high school. I was always so focused on not burning anything, and every time Sean's hand brushed mine, I'd feel this odd spark, like there was some kind of chemistry going on inside me.
It probably didn't help that we hadn't cooked together in ages-dinner ended up taking nearly two hours to prepare.
After we got married, we didn't spend a lot of time eating together. Even though we worked in the same place, I'd always order lunch for him and have it delivered to his office. After work, he didn't have much time to eat at home, let alone now, when he's hardly ever home in the evenings.
When dinner was finally ready, Elizabeth sat down at the table, watching us with a smile and saying,
"Perfect husband, perfect wife, perfect life."
Then she took our hands and closed her eyes to say a prayer before eating.
Elizabeth's a devout Christian, so that made sense.
But as she closed her eyes, I couldn't help but think to myself, "Perfect husband, perfect wife, perfect lie."
Midway through the meal, Sean's phone rang. He glanced at it, then hung up. But just a minute later, it rang again.
I figured it was probably Christina.
When it rang a third time, Sean just turned it off. Then he smiled at Elizabeth and said,
"Work's been crazy lately, but nothing beats having dinner with Grandma."
After that, he shot me a look, one of those "don't give me away" looks, like I shouldn't bring up anything about Christina.
I just quietly chewed my steak and kept my mouth shut.
By the time we finished eating, Elizabeth was in a great mood, chatting away and not wanting to rest.
Finally, Sean glanced at his watch and said, "The doctor said you need to get to bed before 10, remember?"
When we left Elizabeth's room, I went straight for our bedroom, and Sean followed right behind me.
My heart was pounding because I knew-I knew tonight, I had no choice but to sleep in the same room, in the same bed, with Sean.
After my shower, I made sure to put on a super modest pair of pajamas before coming out.
Sean looked me up and down, raising an eyebrow. "Did you borrow Grandma's pajamas? This is a whole different vibe from what you usually wear."
I shot back, "Since when do you care about my pajama style?"
"We agreed on a truce. Why do you seem so... tense?" Sean chuckled, clearly teasing.
I didn't answer. Instead, I grabbed a fresh blanket from the wardrobe and set a pillow down in the middle of the bed before lying down.
Luckily, the bed was King Size, so even with a pillow between us, I still had plenty of space. But just to keep some distance from Sean, I scooted toward the edge. As soon as I closed my eyes, I felt this pressure at the edge of the bed.
"What's that supposed to mean?"
I opened my eyes to find Sean standing at the side of the bed, his face stormy, staring me down.
"What's going on?"
I was genuinely confused. Why was he suddenly so pissed?
###chapter 28:Does The Act Have To Be That Convincing?
Angela POV
"Angela, you"
Sean leaned over the bed, bracing himself with one arm, his face hovering way too close to mine. His breath grazed my skin-warm, familiar, and honestly, a little unsettling.
I stared up at him, totally thrown.
"What's going on? Did I screw up the whole 'happy couple' thing in front of Grandma today?" My voice came out groggy, still heavy with sleep, and I blinked at him lazily. "Just tell me what I did wrong, and I'll fix it tomorrow, okay?"
I flashed him a big, goofy grin and threw in a teasing, "Darling!"
He arched an eyebrow, pulling back with a frown. "Cut it out. When it's just us, you don't need to lay it on so thick."
Then-bam-the bathroom door slammed shut. By the time he came back out, I was already drifting off.
***
The next morning, I woke up to an empty bed. Sean was gone. The pillow we'd shoved between us the night before? Missing too. He must've moved it when he got up, probably paranoid Grandma would barge in and notice the gap.
When I shuffled into the dining room, Elizabeth and Sean were already parked at the table.
"Morning, Elizabeth!" I chirped, sliding into the seat next to her. Then I glanced at Sean. "Why didn't you wake me up? I was gonna make breakfast for Grandma."
"Oh, honey, you need your sleep," Elizabeth said, patting my hand with a sly little grin. "I was young once too. I know how you kids get at night-all that energy."
Her meaning hit me like a freight train, and my face went beet red.
I let out a shaky laugh, knowing I couldn't exactly correct her. No, Elizabeth, I'm just wiped out from being pregnant, not that.
After breakfast, Sean mentioned he'd drive me to the office.
"Hold up," I said as we were heading out. "Your tie's all messed up."
I stepped in close, stretching up on my toes to straighten it. "There," I said, stepping back-only to have him yank me into his arms and plant a kiss right on my lips.
I flinched, instinctively pulling away, but then I remembered Elizabeth was watching. I froze instead, letting it happen.
Sean didn't let go right away-his tongue slipped into my mouth, warm and insistent, tasting faintly of coffee, deepening the kiss with slow, deliberate pressure.
When he finally let go, I shot him a look. He just raised an eyebrow, smirking.
Really? I thought. Does the act have to be that convincing?
At his car, he opened the passenger door for me. I ignored it and climbed into the back seat instead.
He shut the door harder than necessary. "What's that about? Too chicken to sit up front with me?" He paused, then grinned. "Kinda funny, considering you were all over me in your sleep last night. Couldn't even shove you off."
"Stop lying," I snapped. "I was practically falling off the edge of the bed. No way I was anywhere near you."
"Oh yeah?" His voice was pure sarcasm as he slid into the driver's seat and started the engine.
Was he seriously trying to mess with me? I knew I hadn't been clinging to him. He was just yanking my chain.
It wasn't long before Christina strolled into my office.
"Lost?" I glanced up from my desk. "Sean's office is next door."
"Angela, I'm here for you."
"You? For me?" I shut my laptop and leaned back, giving her my full attention.
"Christina, I get why you're here, but I've already decided. Nothing's changing my mind. So, honestly, there's not much to say."
Last time we talked, she'd handed me a three-million-dollar check-and Sean had promptly shipped me off on an "extended leave." 
I didn't buy that the money was just about me leaving him. I'd already planned to walk away from Sean, cash or no cash.
No, that three million was for an abortion.
I'd sent the money back to Sean, so as far as I was concerned, their little plan for my baby was off the table.
Maybe I came on too strong, because Christina went quiet for a minute. Then she said, "You're really set on this?"
"Yep," I replied, not budging.
"Angela," she said, her voice softening, "remember two years ago? Your dad got roughed up by those debt collectors. I stepped in, stopped them, got him to the hospital. That was me, right?"
My stomach twisted, and my face darkened.
She kept her tone low, almost gentle. "What if I called in that favor now? Would you still say no?"
I bit my lip, trying to hold it together, but my pulse was hammering in my chest.
"No rush to answer," she said. "How about we grab lunch downstairs at the café and talk it over?"
###chapter 29: Then Why Don’t You Date Him?
Angela POV
I followed the address Christina texted me and found this cozy little café tucked away near the office. 
As I approached the door, I noticed a "Closed for Rest" sign hanging there. Just then, my phone buzzed.
"Angela, don't worry about the sign-just push the door open and come in. This is my friend's place, and I asked him to shut it down for a few hours so we could talk privately."
I didn't bother replying, just hung up and nudged the door open. The moment I stepped inside, I saw Christina sitting in the corner, waving me over. 
I headed toward her and slid into the seat across the table.
Next to her was a bald, slightly chubby middle-aged guy. 
The second he laid eyes on me, he stood up, walked over, and-without warning-placed a hand on my shoulder. The gesture felt way too familiar, and I couldn't help but tense up, a little put off by it.
"Hey, you must be Christina's friend, right? Can I get you something to drink?" His voice was softer than I'd expected, almost warm, but his eyes lingered on me a bit too long, sizing me up in a way that made my skin crawl.
I shifted slightly to shake off his hand and shook my head. "No, thanks. I can't have coffee right now-doctor's orders because of the baby."
He froze for a split second, clearly caught off guard. Then, with a weird little grin, he said, "Pregnant, huh? No problem-I like mature women!"
I blinked, unsure how to respond to that, but Christina jumped in before I could. "Drake, just grab her a hot milk, will you?"
"Sure thing," he said with a quick nod, shooting me one last glance before heading off. "You two catch up. I'll be right back."
Once he was out of earshot, Christina leaned in with a small, knowing smile. 
"Drake's an old friend I met in Paris. He's pretty laid-back-came back to New York and opened this café. No grand plans, just likes keeping things simple. And when it comes to relationships, he's a total romantic. Treats his girlfriend like gold."
She paused, her tone shifting to something more deliberate. "You know, after your divorce from Sean, if you don't have anyone else in mind maybe give Drake a thought."
Wait, hold on. Was that her angle all along?
No wonder he'd been acting so weirdly friendly. 
She'd clearly already decided I was some kind of package deal to pitch to him. I bit back the urge to snap, but a hint of sarcasm slipped out anyway. 
"Christina, I owe you one, sure-but are you seriously trying to run my love life now too?"
She looked startled for a moment, then laughed it off like I was overreacting. 
"Oh, come on, Angela. I'm not meddling in your marriage or anything. I just think Drake's a decent guy"
"Really? Then why don't you date him?" I cut her off, not letting her finish.
Her smile faded, and the air between us grew tense. Our friendship had always been more surface-level than either of us liked to admit-I didn't buy for a second that she was doing this out of kindness.
There was a long pause. Christina picked up her spoon and stirred her coffee slowly, like she was buying time. 
"I didn't expect you to get so defensive about someone who's helped you out," she said, her voice cool, her eyes sharp with judgment.
Oddly enough, that jab actually made me relax. I grinned. 
"Oh, good-so you're finally dropping the act? Honestly, the real you isn't half bad. At least you're not forcing that fake smile anymore."
Her expression darkened. "I just don't think you deserve me being nice to you! I didn't peg you for someone this ungrateful," she shot back.
"Ungrateful?" I raised an eyebrow, studying her. "Just because you helped my dad, does that mean I should throw away a life for you?"
Her face paled. "What are you even talking about? When did I ask you to kill someone?"
"Isn't that what you're after?" I said coolly. "For me to get rid of my baby?"
She froze, stunned, then scrambled to argue. 
"It's just an embryo, Angela. You're getting divorced-why keep it? Don't pretend I don't see through you." She leaned forward, her voice dropping. 
"Your family's broke, and that baby's your last tie to Sean. Even after the divorce, you'll use it to cling to him-maybe even squeeze him for cash. You think I'm going to let that slide?"
I rolled my eyes. "You're overcomplicating it. Once the baby's born, it's got nothing to do with the Shaw family. It'll take my last name."
She gave me a skeptical look, clearly not convinced.
"And don't try to guilt me," I added. "If I want to keep this baby, that's my call. You can't force me to abort-it's not even legal."
"You" Her voice shook with frustration. After a long, heavy sigh, she finally backed down. "Fine," she muttered, defeated. 
"Keeping the baby might be a mess for you, but if you're dead-set on it, we'll need to sign an agreement."
###chapter 30: An Agreement
Angela POV
Before Christina could say anything, Drake came over with a cup of hot milk.
"Here you go, hot milk," he said with a smile.
Christina paused and, without missing a beat, flashed him a sweet grin. "Drake, thank you!"
Drake winked at her. "No problem, it's my pleasure. Enjoy, ladies!" He gave us a polite nod before walking away.
Christina pushed the milk toward me with an almost exaggerated 'thoughtful' look. "You can't drink anything else right now. The milk's warm, so just have a sip."
I glanced at her, noticing that her fake smile was back.
"What's the matter? Worried I'll slip something in the milk?" Christina laughed. "Relax, if I wanted to pull something shady, I wouldn't have invited you here in the first place."
I took a sip of the milk, then decided to turn the conversation to the agreement. "So what exactly is this agreement you mentioned?"
Christina chuckled. "Looks like you're really not planning to stay long, huh?"
"Well, do you want to wrap this up quickly or not?"
"Of course."
She pulled a brown paper envelope from her tote bag and handed it to me.
"This is the agreement. Take a look."
I took it without saying a word.
Inside, the agreement was several pages long, but the main points were simple. There were four key conditions:
First, after the divorce, she must leave the country immediately and stay out for at least five years.
Second, she can't mention the child in front of Sean, nor can she use the child for sympathy.
Third, she's not allowed to have any further intimate interactions with Sen before the divorce.
Fourth, she'd receive a sum of money, and if she wanted to raise the child, Jiang Chuchu would also bear the responsibility for their support until adulthood.
I finished reading and placed the agreement on the table. "I have a few questions about this."
"What's the problem?" Christina forced a smile.
I glanced at her, then back at the paper, tapping my fingers lightly on the table. "Why can't I bring up the child in front of Sean?"
Christina's eyes flickered, and she responded softly, "Not bringing it up is for your own good."
"For my good?" I gave a slight sneer, raising an eyebrow.
Christina took a sip of her coffee, now showing a hint of disdain. "Look, you two were childhood friends. Even if he doesn't love you, he'll always see you as a good friend.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have helped your family two years ago, right?
But now he's going to be with me, and your child-it's not just a barrier between us; it's a thorn in the side of your relationship with him. He cares about that. Do you understand?"
She paused for a second before adding, in a lower voice, "And I'm worried that, one day, he might try to take the child away. Angela, I really don't want to raise someone else's kid."
When I didn't reply, Christina pressed, "So, you're not agreeing?"
I glanced at her casually. "You seem really worried about this."
"I'm not worried. I just..."
She trailed off under my gaze, and after a beat, she changed her tone. "Alright, take your time. Think it over."
I definitely needed to think carefully.
The truth was, whether I signed or not didn't matter much to her. Even if I didn't sign, all the conditions-except the first one-were things I was already planning to do.
The first point was still up in the air because I hadn't decided where I'd settle yet, but I was definitely planning to stay far away from Sean.
"Well?" Christina asked cautiously. "If I follow these conditions, we're clear, right?"
She nodded eagerly. "Yes."
"Okay."
When she heard me agree, she quickly grabbed a pen and handed it to me. "Then go ahead and sign."
I took the pen with a smile. "I'm not signing this agreement."
For a moment, Christina's eyes widened. "What do you mean? You're not signing?"
I leaned back in my chair, calm and composed. "I'm not signing a private agreement like this."
Christina reacted immediately. "What's going on? Are you trying to mess with me?"
"No," I shook my head, keeping my tone serious. "I won't sign, but I'll still follow through with everything you asked."
I paused for a second, then added slowly, "If you didn't create this agreement to trap me, then whether I sign it or not shouldn't make a difference."
Christina, clearly holding back her frustration, forced a smile. "Angela, how could I trick you? If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't have helped you in the first place."
"Really?" I raised an eyebrow. "Then why are you so scared?"
"You're supposed to be Sean's number one, right? What's with all this insecurity that you need me to sign an agreement?"
Christina's face shifted slightly, a flash of bitterness crossing her expression. "If you didn't insist on keeping the baby, would I need this agreement?"
"Then, please trust me. Even without signing, I'll do what you asked."
"Really?" Christina seemed taken aback by my confidence. "If you don't sign, how will I know you won't back out?"
"Even if I sign, how will you know I won't change my mind later? If I really want to do something, do you think the penalty clause in your contract will stop me?"
"So what do you want then? You won't get rid of the child, and I've agreed to that, but you can't even sign to put my mind at ease?"
"Christina, there's one thing you need to understand-the decision about the child is mine. And just to make it clear, Sean and I are still legally married, whereas you"
Christina's face went pale.
"Are you sure you can keep your promises?"
"If I couldn't, I wouldn't have come here today. If I've already made my decision, why would I waste any more time sitting here with you?"
"Fine, you said it."
Christina extended her hand, putting on a smile. "I hope you can keep your promise. Here's to a smooth cooperation."
I stared at her outstretched hand but didn't take it. Instead, I simply said, "From now on, I don't owe you anything."
###chapter 31: Two kisses
Sean POV
I sat back in my office chair, the meeting with the board finally over.
The afternoon sun filtered in through the windows. I tugged at my tie, the fabric slightly too tight around my neck, and my thoughts began to drift.
The image of Angela tying my tie this morning flashed into my mind. The way her fingers moved so carefully, the quiet focus in her eyes, and that kiss.
It was only the second time I had kissed her since I'd proposed the divorce.
The first kiss was when I'd forced her to take the fever medicine-one of those strange, almost accidental moments.
But this time, it had been in front of my grandmother, a performance, nothing more than a charade to maintain appearances.
Two kisses. Neither one meaningful, not really.
Still, my mind kept returning to them, as if something had shifted that I wasn't willing to acknowledge.
I shook my head, trying to clear the thoughts. I'd made my decision. If I was going to walk away from this marriage, I had to let go completely.
As I scrolled through my phone, I found myself dialing Angela's number without even thinking.
"Where are you?" I asked. "You weren't at the meeting today."
"I just dropped Grandma off at the nursing home," she replied.
"I'm on my way there now. Wait for me."
I checked my watch. It was still early enough to make it to the nursing home.
The heavy glass door of the meeting room clicked shut behind me as I stepped into the bustling corridor.
My thoughts were still lingering on the tense board meeting, and I barely noticed Christina until she called out to me, her voice ringing clear and loud in the quiet hallway.
"Sean!"
I turned, and there she was-Christina, wearing a white dress that seemed to glow under the fluorescent lights.
The sight of her immediately drew the attention of a few nearby executives, and I could feel their eyes on us, watching closely.
It made me uncomfortable, more than I cared to admit.
Lately, Christina had been showing up at the office more and more.
Sometimes it was for business-something I could rationalize-but other times, I had no idea why she was here. She didn't always have a reason.
And I couldn't ignore the subtle whispers from a few board members who had pulled me aside, suggesting I keep things professional.
"Keep it low-key, we don't need any rumors spreading around here."
I understood their point.
I was still technically Angela's husband, and if word got out about me and another woman, it would hurt the company's reputation-maybe even tank the stock price.
I wasn't willing to risk that, no matter how complicated things had gotten on the personal front.
Christina smiled brightly as she approached, but I didn't return the warmth.
Instead, I furrowed my brow and asked, "Is there something you need?"
Without missing a beat, Christina reached into her bag and pulled out a small, beautifully wrapped box. She held it out to me with a grin.
"I made you some cookies! I know you've been working late, so I thought you might want a snack. You can have them tonight if you get hungry."
A few executives, still loitering nearby, chuckled.
"Sean, you're lucky!"
"Christina's looking more beautiful every day!"
Christina's face flushed bright red at the comments, and she lowered her gaze, clearly flustered.
My gaze shifted to the executives, and I shot them a sharp, cold look.
"Got nothing better to do?" I snapped. "All this nonsense, and not one of you could speak up during the meeting?"
The room immediately fell silent. The executives quickly averted their eyes, shuffling awkwardly as they scattered, clearly unsettled by my outburst.
Christina, now wide-eyed and a little taken aback, looked up at me.
"Sean... what's wrong?"
I hesitated for a moment, my anger simmering beneath the surface. Then, taking a breath, I softened my tone and forced myself to calm down.
"Nothing," I said, "It's just... today's meeting didn't go well."
"Ah," Christina nodded, her hand still holding the box of cookies in mid-air, uncertain of what to do with it.
I took the box from her and set it down on a nearby table.
"Thanks, but you didn't need to bring this. You know... this is a workplace." I gave her a quick, polite smile.
I glanced at my watch, already feeling the weight of my responsibilities pulling me elsewhere.
"I have something I need to take care of. I'll have the driver take you home."
Christina looked surprised.
"What?" She tilted her head, a small smile forming again, though I could sense a little confusion. "Sean, what's so urgent? If you're not going to be gone long, I can wait for you in your office."
I gave a small shake of my head, not wanting to drag this out.
"Sorry, I'll be out for a while. You go ahead and head back."
She opened her mouth, as if she wanted to argue, but before she could say anything more, Peter appeared beside us, cutting the tension.
I nodded at her quickly, said a brief goodbye, and left in a hurry.
***
When I arrived at the nursing home and pushed open the door to Grandma's room, I found Angela sleeping beside Grandma's bed.
For a moment, I stood frozen in the doorway, watching the peaceful rise and fall of her chest. Her breathing was soft and even, a stark contrast to the tension I'd been carrying with me all day.
I stepped inside, the faint scent of lavender filling the room, and closed the door behind me with a quiet click.
Grandma's eyes flicked up to meet mine, a knowing smile curling at the corners of her lips.
She motioned toward Angela with a finger pressed gently to her lips, signaling for me to stay quiet.
I nodded, understanding.
Moving as silently as I could, I approached Angela. She looked so vulnerable in that moment, her face softened in sleep.
I bent down slowly, careful not to wake her, and reached out to lift her. She stirred for a brief second, but her eyelids remained closed, her body completely relaxed in my arms.
I moved her carefully, laying her down on the small bed beside Grandma's. She instinctively nuzzled into the softness of the cushion, pulling the blanket closer to her chest as if she were still wrapped in a dream.
Grandma's voice broke the silence. "She probably hasn't been resting well lately."
I didn't respond right away. My eyes lingered on Angela's face, noticing the dark circles under her eyes-the telltale signs of sleepless nights.
I felt a pang of guilt, wondering if it was something I hadn't noticed, or something I had overlooked.
I lowered my head, my fingers hovering near her face as I carefully reached for a few stray strands of hair that had fallen across her cheek. Before I could touch her, though, Angela's eyelids fluttered open.
Her gaze locked onto mine, momentarily disoriented.
 "Sean?" she murmured, her voice hushed and sleepy.
###chapter 32: Angela Had Never Once Held Me Like This
Sean POV
"Sorry, I was still half-asleep," Angela murmured, her voice drowsy and slow.
She started to get up, and out of habit, I reached out to help her. But the moment my hand moved toward her, she flinched, pulling away as if I'd burned her.
It stung.
"What's wrong? Do I have thorns or something?" My voice came out colder than I intended.
I'd told Angela more than once that even after our divorce, I still saw her as a friend. But lately, it felt like she was doing everything possible to keep her distance-cold, distant, almost like she found me repulsive.
"Sorry, I just forgot about our arrangement," she whispered. She leaned in briefly, almost too close, then quickly pulled back and glanced at Elizabeth.
The apology barely registered. That tiny movement-her pulling away-only made the space between us feel wider, the distance heavier.
"Lunch together?" I asked, forcing a smile.
"Oh, I already have plans with Sophie. I need to go."
She didn't even wait for a response. Instead, she hopped out of bed, walked over to Elizabeth, and kissed her forehead with effortless warmth-something she never did with me. Then, just like that, she was gone, slipping away like smoke through a crack in the door.
Any guilt I'd felt for snapping at her disappeared instantly.
***
By the time I got to my office, frustration had built up inside me. I yanked off my black suit jacket and tossed it onto the couch.
Michael walked in, took one look at me, and seemed ready to turn right back around.
"Something wrong?" I asked before he could leave.
He shrugged and set a gift box on my desk.
It was the batch of cookies Christina had dropped off earlier. I'd handed them to Michael at lunch before heading out.
That's when it hit me-I hadn't eaten all day. I'd made time to visit Angela, hoping to have lunch with her, but she had been as cold as ever.
Michael glanced at me, smirking. "Oh, don't mind me. These are from the one and only Miss Christina. How could I possibly dare lay a finger on them?" His voice dripped with sarcasm.
I shot him a sharp look. "Are you mocking me?"
He let out a low chuckle but didn't say another word.
"Get out," I said coldly.
He made a face but didn't argue, turning and walking out.
I loosened my tie and threw it onto the couch, exhaling sharply. But barely five minutes later, Michael knocked and walked back in.
"What now?" I asked, barely containing my irritation.
He held up a beautifully wrapped bag. "An Italian restaurant just delivered this for you. They said Miss Angela placed the order."
Right then, my phone buzzed with a new message.
It was from Angela.
"Grandma mentioned you haven't eaten, so I ordered something for you. The restaurant just confirmed delivery. Did you get it?"
The tension in my chest loosened slightly. My mood lifted, though I still muttered, "Wasn't she avoiding me? What's with the sudden thoughtfulness?"
I glanced at Michael. "Bring it in."
"On it."
He set the takeout on my desk, then gestured toward the cookies. "So what do you want me to do with these? You said I could have them."
"Hm?" I barely looked up.
"I mean, I can't eat all of them myself. Should I share with the office? Feels like a waste to throw them out."
I sighed, already tired of the conversation. "Do whatever you want with them. Just don't bother me with this."
"Got it."
Once he left, I opened the takeout box. Most of it was food I liked.
A small, reluctant smile tugged at my lips.
That stubborn woman-she acted like she didn't care, but she still did.
After finishing my meal, I was just settling into work when a sharp knock interrupted me.
"Come in," I called, already annoyed.
To my surprise, it was Christina.
I frowned. "Oh. I thought it was my assistant. What's wrong?"
She looked hurt. "I stayed up late baking those cookies for you, and now I find out you gave them away?" She lowered her head for a moment before looking up, eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Sean did I do something to upset you? If you don't want me to come by anymore, just tell me."
I sighed. Looking at her, remembering how she had once nearly died saving me, I felt my irritation soften.
"Don't overthink it. I just don't really like sweets."
"Really? You're not mad? You don't think I'm bothering you?" She wiped at her eyes.
"How could I be mad at you?" I smiled, trying to ease her worries. "You can come by whenever you want."
Her expression brightened instantly as she slipped her arm through mine. "Sean, you're always so good to me."
"If it weren't for you back then, I wouldn't be standing here now. If you ever need anything, just ask."
She hesitated, then said, "Since I've been back, I haven't had a chance to visit Elizabeth. Do you think I could see her next week?"
I frowned, shaking my head. "Let's wait a bit. I don't want anything upsetting her recovery."
Elizabeth had never been fond of Christina for some reason.
Christina nodded obediently. "Okay, I'll listen to you."
Then, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, she leaned in and wrapped her arms around my neck.
For a second, I felt like pulling away. It was too intimate-especially during office hours. But seeing the remnants of tears on her face, I didn't have the heart to.
So I let her hold me.
And as I stood there, I couldn't help but think-Angela had never once held me like this.
###chapter 33:I Thought He Didn't Like Sweets
Angela POV
I kept reminding myself that this was all just an act-I shouldn't let it get to me.
But then I thought about the kiss Sean gave me this morning, and my face warmed instantly.
I'd already agreed to Christina's deal. Soon, I'd be out of Sean's life for good.
I needed to start getting used to it.
A little affection in front of Elizabeth was one thing, but having lunch together? That was crossing a line I wasn't willing to step over.
Still, when I thought about Sean rushing to the nursing home at noon without eating, I felt a pang of guilt. I ordered him an Italian lunch and had it delivered to his office.
It had become a habit.
For the past two years, I had been the one making sure he ate.
He doesn't like sweets, but he loves spicy food.
He can't stand cilantro, but he's crazy about basil.
I shook my head, pushing those thoughts away. From now on, I needed to focus on myself-and the baby growing inside me.
***
My long vacation was over, and today was my first day back at work.
Even though I had handed off my tasks before leaving, things had been rushed. Now that I was back, I was seeing all the mistakes in Emily's work.
While I was swamped, Emily walked in and set a cup of coffee on my desk.
"Emily, from now on, just bring me water instead of coffee."
She looked at me, confused. "Aren't you the one who loves coffee?"
I couldn't tell her I was pregnant, so I just said, "Tastes change."
I kept my head down, working straight through the morning. By lunchtime, my phone rang. It was Sean.
"Have you eaten yet? If not, come to my office. We can eat together."
Then he added, almost awkwardly, "Don't get the wrong idea-Michael ordered too much, and I can't finish it all."
This morning, I had told Michael to take over ordering Sean's lunches. Maybe he had overdone it on his first try, unsure of Sean's preferences.
"No thanks, I've already eaten." I hung up before he could say more.
I turned to Emily. "Let's go grab lunch."
We headed downstairs to a fast-food place.
Just as we sat down, I overheard a group of women at the next table whispering.
"I heard Christina sent the boss food again today."
"Yeah, and yesterday she made cookies. I tried them-they were amazing. I didn't expect her to be so beautiful, smart, and a great cook too."
I picked at my salad, pretending not to hear.
Sean doesn't like sweets. Or at least, I thought he didn't.
But if Christina made them, he'd eat them.
I remembered how I'd ordered him lunch yesterday, worried that he hadn't eaten. The realization stung. He had Christina looking after him now-there was no way he was skipping meals.
Was inviting me to his office just his way of rubbing it in?
Emily shot me a knowing look, but I kept my expression neutral.
The women behind us kept talking.
"I heard Christina is the one he really likes."
"Yeah. She's so much better than that poker-faced woman. That one's family went bankrupt, and she only got a job at the company because the boss helped her."
"I can't stand gold diggers. We work hard, but some women just use their looks to get ahead."
"I bet the boss is going to marry Christina soon."
.......
Bang!
Emily slammed her fork down. "These people are too much! I'm going to shut them up."
I grabbed her wrist before she could stand. "No, don't."
"But-"
I gave her a warning look, and she sat back down, fuming.
"Angela, didn't you hear what they said? It's disgusting! They have no idea what they're talking about."
"I'm not in the mood to argue, and you can't stop people from talking. Save your energy."
Emily huffed but said nothing.
I didn't have the time or energy to fight, but more than that-I couldn't risk the stress affecting the baby.
Emily had a lot on the line too. She came from a poor background and was drowning in student debt. I had hired her, and if I was leaving soon, I needed to make sure she was secure in her position before I was gone.
As for the gossip Once I was out of the picture, it would die down.
When Christina and Sean got married, no one would care about his ex-wife anymore.
After lunch, Emily and I returned to the office. Just as we stepped inside, I saw Christina leaving Sean's office.
She waved at me. "Angela!"
I forced a polite smile but kept walking.
To my surprise, she followed me and slipped into my office behind me.
"Do you need something?"
"I made some snacks, and since Sean couldn't finish them all, I thought I'd bring some for you."
I scoffed. "So, I only get what's left over?"
Her face fell. "That's not what I meant I just wanted to be nice."
Emily crossed her arms, unimpressed. "We're working. If you have nothing else to do, maybe go bother someone else."
Christina gasped. "You guys are unbelievable!"
She turned on her heel and stormed out.
Emily grinned, satisfied.
But something about the whole thing made me uneasy.
I turned to Emily. "Do you like working here? Do you want to stay long-term?"
She blinked at me. "Yeah. I mean, I like it. As long as they don't fire me, I'll stay."
"Then focus on your work. Leave personal feelings out of it."
Emily frowned. "What are you trying to say?"
I sighed. "Christina might marry Sean one day. Even if you don't like her, it's not worth making enemies."
Emily's face fell. "I was just trying to help you."
I gave her a long look. "You're just an employee. I'm your leader. Our relationship is professional-why do you think you need to defend me?"
Emily's eyes welled with tears.
The office fell silent.
Then, someone cleared their throat.
"Ahem."
I turned and saw Nathan standing in the doorway. I hadn't even noticed when he arrived.
I motioned to Emily. "Get back to work."
She gave me one last glance before scurrying out.
Nathan stepped inside and shut the door behind him.
"Why were you so harsh with her? She was just trying to help, and you made her feel like an idiot."
I leaned back in my chair, sighing. "I don't care how she feels. I won't be here much longer anyway."
Nathan's eyes sharpened. "You're leaving?"
He stepped closer, watching me carefully. "When?"
###chapter 34: Stop Treating Me Like A Kid
Angela POV
I met Nathan's gaze, doing my best to stay calm despite the unease creeping in my chest.
"The exact time hasn't been set yet, but it'll be soon."
His brows furrowed even more at my response, his lips pressed into a thin line.
I could see the gears turning in his mind, calculating, analyzing.
"I told you before, you can always consult with me before making any big decisions," Nathan said, his tone more serious now, but there was an edge of concern beneath it.
I shrugged, forcing a smile. "I only decided a couple of days ago. It's not really a big deal."
Nathan's gaze softened, but only for a moment. He nodded, though his thoughts seemed to be elsewhere.
"Nathan, what's going on in that head of yours?" I asked, unable to bear the silence any longer.
He blinked, as if snapping out of a trance, and looked at me, a flicker of sadness in his eyes that I hadn't seen before.
"I..." He hesitated.
"You're not thinking about resigning, are you?"
Nathan had come to work at Sean's company because of me, and I knew he'd follow my lead in everything-even quitting if I decided to leave. The thought of him leaving without a second thought hit me hard, a mix of protectiveness and guilt.
But instead of answering, Nathan raised an eyebrow and gave me a half-smile-one that didn't reach his eyes.
"Don't worry, that's not what I'm thinking about."
"Alright," I said, "but don't forget about your own situation. Are you really planning to leave?"
"Yeah, I've already made up my mind." I nodded, trying to keep my tone light.
"Angela, I'm not criticizing you," Nathan said, his voice softer but still laced with frustration. "But Christina's back, and you're just going to walk away? Is it really that easy to push you around?"
His words stung, but I didn't flinch. I knew it wasn't just about Christina-it was about me, about how Nathan saw me giving up, how he thought I was weak.
There was a pause, and his voice dropped lower, his brow furrowing.
"Angela, you weren't always like this. Why is it when it comes to Sean, you just... give up?"
I lowered my eyes, feeling a lump form in my throat.
If it had been anyone else, I might've fought for them. But Sean didn't love me-not the way I needed him to. And I couldn't keep holding on to something that would never be mine.
"You didn't come here to talk about Christina, did you?" I asked, trying to shift the conversation.
Nathan glanced down at the folder in his hands, clearing his throat.
"Oh, the project Sean had us working on before your vacation? I've already handled it. Take a look." He placed the folder gently on my desk.
I picked it up, impressed.
"You finished it a week ahead of schedule?"
"It was easy." Nathan grinned, his usual cocky smirk back in place.
His pride was contagious, and I couldn't help but smile.
The afternoon wore on, and soon the warm rays of the setting sun filtered through the office window, casting a golden glow on Nathan's hair. Time had passed faster than I realized.
"To reward you, I'll take you out to dinner tonight." Without thinking, I ruffled his hair, a playful gesture that always felt natural between us.
But this time, Nathan didn't just let it happen. In one smooth motion, he grabbed my hand, his grip firm, and lifted his head, closing the space between us.
His eyes were darker than I'd ever seen, and his voice dropped low as he whispered, "Stop treating me like a kid."
There was something in his gaze-something unspoken-that made my heart skip a beat. I quickly pulled my hand back, stepping away, suddenly aware of the distance that had grown between us.
"To me, you'll always be like a little brother," I said, laughing to hide the awkwardness.
Nathan didn't answer, his eyes lingering on me as if he was considering the space I'd put between us.
I closed my laptop with a soft click and pushed it aside.
"Let's go. I know a great restaurant. You'll love it," I said, offering him a smile.
Nathan glanced at me, and we both made our way toward the door. The office was quiet now, with most of the employees having left for the day.
But as we stepped out of the office, we came face to face with Christina and Sean, who were walking toward us. The air shifted instantly, thick with unspoken tension.
Sean's gaze flicked briefly to mine, and then, almost instinctively, his eyes landed on Nathan. His expression hardened, and I felt an odd chill pass between them.
Christina, always ready to stir the pot, didn't miss her chance. "Angela," she said, her voice dripping with sweetness, "It looks like you and Nathan are pretty close. I hear you've known each other for years?"
I didn't answer immediately, and I could feel Nathan's stance shift beside me-his posture stiffening just slightly.
Christina wasn't done. "I also heard that before your family went bankrupt, Nathan worked at your family's bank. Your father even planned to arrange your engagement, didn't he?"
Before I could respond, Nathan spoke up, his voice sharp with sarcasm.
"How do you know so much about Angela's family? Did you have someone dig into her past?"
Then, taking a small step forward, he added, "And by the way, Angela and I are colleagues. We talk about work. But you, Christina-what's your excuse? Why are you always hanging around someone else's husband?"
Christina went silent, her face flushing with anger, but she quickly turned to Sean, hoping he'd step in to defend her.
But Sean didn't move. Didn't speak. He just stood there, his face an unreadable mask, his gaze icy. Finally, he turned to me, as though Christina had disappeared.
"The workday's over. Let's go home together."
"We already have plans for dinner," I said, my voice steady.
Sean's expression darkened even further, his jaw tightening as if my words had struck a nerve. I couldn't understand why he was so upset. I was just having dinner with Nathan-there was no reason for this hostility.
Is this what they call possessiveness?
Even if Sean didn't have feelings for me, was I not allowed to be around another man as long as I was still his wife?
I didn't wait for Sean to say anything else. I wasn't asking for permission anymore.
Grabbing Nathan's arm with finality, I smiled and said,
"Let's go! The restaurant is really popular, and if we're late, we won't get a seat."
###chapter 35: Are You Jealous?
Angela POV
After dinner with Nathan, he drove me home. To avoid any tension between him and Sean, I didn't invite Nathan inside.
I walked through the door, but Sean wasn't anywhere to be found. He must still be with Christina, I thought. Or maybe he wouldn't be coming home tonight. Either way, I didn't feel like waiting around for him.
I pulled out my laptop and set it on the table, determined to finish up some work I needed to pass along to Emily.
As soon as I opened the spreadsheet, the door clicked open, and I heard footsteps. Startled, I looked up and saw Sean standing in the doorway of our bedroom.
He was only wearing a towel, his chest bare, water dripping from his damp hair onto his bronzed skin. A bead of water slid down his chest, catching the light as it moved lower, tracing the muscles in a way that almost hypnotized me.
I couldn't help but stare. It was impossible not to. He looked so effortlessly tempting, like something out of a dream. No wonder so many women at the office were drawn to him.
"What's the matter? Am I that good-looking?" he teased, a wicked smile tugging at his lips. "You look stunned."
"Who's staring at you!" I snapped quickly, my face flushing. I tried to focus, but my heart was still racing. "Why didn't you knock before coming in?"
He didn't even flinch, walking over casually. "This is our bedroom," he said with a shrug. "Why would I need to knock?" His eyes flicked to my laptop screen, and his lips curled into a mocking smile. "Isn't Nathan helping you? Why do you still need to bring work home?"
I clenched my teeth, frustration rising. "I didn't finish it during the day," I muttered, trying to focus on my task.
"Then just do it tomorrow," Sean said, his voice dripping with annoyance.
I glanced up at him, his tall frame looming by the bed. There was an air of arrogance to him that I couldn't ignore. After his shower, the scent of body wash lingered in the air, clean and fresh. Still, his expression was off-he was upset, annoyed, even.
He was upset that I had interrupted his rest.
I sighed, shutting my laptop. "I'll go work in the study," I said, trying to give him space.
But as soon as I moved, he stepped in front of me, blocking my path.
"Was the time at the office not enough for you to finish your work?" he asked, his voice low and dangerous. "Or is there something more important that's making you slack off?"
I raised my eyebrows, caught off guard. "What do you mean?"
Sean didn't answer immediately. Instead, his gaze hardened. "How was your chat with Nathan?"
And just like that, everything clicked. I understood what was going on now. It wasn't about work. It wasn't even about me interrupting his downtime.
It was about his stupid male pride.
I didn't want to deal with this right now, so I tried to push past him, ready to walk away.
But before I could get past, he grabbed my wrist and pulled me toward him. Before I could protest, he pressed me down onto the bed, his grip tight and unyielding.
"Sean, what are you doing?!" I gasped, my heart pounding as I struggled beneath him.
He pinned my arms above my head with one hand and his knee on my legs. His body pressed against mine, and I could feel his warmth, the dampness of his skin clinging to me. I tried to pull away, but his hold was too strong.
"Stop moving," he murmured, his voice dangerously calm. "You're going to knock off my towel..."
I froze. It hit me then-Sean was barely covered, his towel hanging by a thread, his arousal growing with every movement I made.
"Pervert!" I yelled.
I bit into the hard muscle of his arm, hoping to make him release me.
His arm was like stone.
"Let go!" I spat, still trying to break free.
Sean winced slightly, his face tightening in pain.
"Angie, let go of me!" he growled, his grip tightening.
That name. The way he said it made something inside me shift-a memory of a time when things were easier between us. It had been so long since he'd called me that.
The sound of it almost made me crumble.
I finally loosened my grip, but before I could do anything, Sean grabbed my chin and forced my face to turn toward his. His eyes locked onto mine, dark and intense, as his breath came heavy.
The taste of blood lingered in my mouth, heat rising to my cheeks.
Sean looked at the mark on his arm, a wicked smile curving his lips. A deep, mocking laugh rumbled from his chest.
"Biting so hard, Angie... do you even have a heart?"
"Then let me go," I glared at him, anger bubbling up.
 "It was just dinner with Nathan. Why are you so angry? Are you jealous?"
###chapter 36: Tempted To Let Go 
Angela POV
"Jealous?"
Sean froze for a moment, as if caught off guard. His gaze softened just a fraction before he reached up with his fingertip and gently wiped the blood from the corner of my lips.
The touch was tender, but his voice was anything but gentle.
"Even if I am jealous, so what?" he murmured, his breath hot against my skin. "Don't forget, legally, you're my wife."
His face leaned closer, his lips nearly brushing mine. The heat from his breath washed over me, sending a shiver through my body.
And for a split second, I was tempted. 
Tempted to let go.
To let him kiss me, to feel the weight of his presence suffocate all the frustration I'd been holding in.
But as soon as his lips were inches from mine, I turned my face away, breaking the moment.
"Being your wife legally doesn't mean anything," I said, a faint smile curling my lips, laced with mocking humor. "Or let me put it this way-if you're jealous of me, doesn't that mean you're betraying Christina?"
The mention of her name hit like a slap, and I saw his expression darken immediately. His jaw tightened.
"Why bring her up?" he demanded, his voice low, almost growling.
"Can't I?" I shot back, my tone biting. "Then why bring up Nathan?"
Silence fell.
His anger simmered in the space between us, but neither of us spoke. We just stood there, locked in a standoff.
Finally, with a slight loosening of his grip on me, Sean rolled off the bed, standing up with an abruptness that left the air thick with tension.
He wrapped the towel around his waist again, but the image of his huge cock lingered in my mind longer than I cared to admit.
I refused to look at him. Instead, I forced myself to focus on the pain in my wrist-the spot where his grip had bruised me earlier.
"Savage," I muttered under my breath, getting to my feet. I reached down to pick up the laptop that had fallen to the floor in the struggle.
But when I turned it on, nothing happened. The screen stayed black, stubbornly refusing to respond.
Great！My work for the night was ruined.
Sean was still standing nearby, his cold presence unwavering. He wasn't leaving, and that unsettled me even more.
"Not going to work anymore?" he asked.
I snapped, my frustration boiling over. "You broke it! How am I supposed to work now?"
Sean hesitated for just a moment, then reached for the laptop. "Let me take a look."
"No need,"
His eyes flicked to my face, catching the anger in my expression. He swallowed, his Adam's apple bobbing as his tone softened.
"Then I'll buy you a new one."
I laughed , finding it both frustrating and almost amusing.
"Do you really think I need your money for a laptop?"
But as soon as the words left my mouth, reality hit me. Someday, when I had a child to care for, when I was scrimping and saving, I'd need every penny I could get. Maybe the price of a laptop could buy diapers, formula, or toys for a little one.
I changed my tone, still irritated but calculating.
"Fine. Just transfer the money to me now."
Sean's eyebrows shot up in surprise, but quickly, he pulled out his phone and made the transfer.
"I thought you didn't need money," he said, his voice laced with mockery. "Should I also transfer the fifteen million you gave back me?"
I scoffed, dismissing the idea. "No need."
I checked my phone as the notification came through. 100,000.
"That's too much! A laptop only costs a few thousand."
"Consider the extra as my apology."
"My laptop cost 8,000," I said flatly. "I'll just take what I'm owed." I handed the excess money back to him without another word.
"Do you really have to be so precise about everything?" Sean asked, his voice carrying an undercurrent of frustration."You and Nathan... are you so precise with him, too?"
I didn't answer. Instead, I picked up the broken laptop and walked toward the guest room.
***
The next morning, I walked into the small repair shop with my damaged laptop.  After all, I didn't have much time left at the company, and buying a new one felt like a waste.
When lunch came around, Emily and I sat down in the small cafeteria. She was uncharacteristically quiet, pushing her food around on her plate instead of talking and laughing as she usually did. I raised an eyebrow, concerned.
"What's wrong?" I asked, setting my own fork down. "Is it because I've been forcing you to work overtime lately? Are you too tired?"
Emily shook her head, her gaze lingering on her plate. When she finally looked up, her eyes were wet with unshed tears.
"Angela... are you going to quit?"
I froze. I had planned on keeping it from her for a while longer. The last thing I wanted was to upset her. I cleared my throat before replying, trying to sound casual.
"Did Nathan tell you?"
Emily shook her head again"No. He didn't say anything, but I can feel it... you're rushing to hand everything over to me."
"Please, keep it to yourself for now, don't tell anyone,"
Emily's face scrunched up. She leaned in closer, her voice growing more desperate. "Is it because of Christina? Is she the one pressuring you?"
"Didn't you hear what I said yesterday? You're just a junior employee! Focus on your own work! You have to learn to survive in the company without me."
"I just... I just don't want to lose you."
I sighed and reached across the table, gently grasping her hand.
"I understand," I said softly, squeezing her fingers.
After lunch, we returned to the office.
I walked through the familiar hallways, still thinking about Emily's words. I didn't notice the time passing until we reached the lobby and I saw the large digital clock on the wall.
I froze mid-step. Only a week left.
Elizabeth's surgery was just around the corner.
Time felt like it was slipping through my fingers, and I couldn't help but wonder if everything would turn out as I hoped.
Would Elizabeth be alright?
And would my divorce with Sean go smoothly, as planned?
I shook my head, pushing the doubts away.
I had to keep going. For now, all I could do was hope.
###chapter 37: Would He Sacrifice His Employees Just To Keep Her Happy？
Angela POV
As I climbed the stairs to the office, I saw a familiar figure standing at the top of the landing.
Christina was there, holding a lunchbox with both hands, her face lit up with a proud smile.
"Looks like someone's delivering lunch again," I muttered under my breath, eyeing the lunchbox she was holding.
"Angela!"
She quickly approached, and I braced myself for what was coming.
"I made ham and mushroom soup for Sean today. Want to try some?"
I raised an eyebrow and glanced at the lunchbox she was offering me, as if it were some sort of offering.
"The ham is something a friend of mine had airlifted from Spain just for this," she added, almost bragging.
I couldn't hide my disinterest and replied bluntly, "Aren't you tired of doing all this?"
I meant it as a comment on her exhausting need to play the dutiful girlfriend in front of Sean-wasn't it tiring, acting like this all the time?
But Christina just beamed, completely missing the sarcasm.
"Cooking for someone you like and watching them enjoy it is so rewarding. How could I ever get tired of it?" she said, sounding genuinely happy.
I didn't respond immediately, just forced a tight smile as I tried to move past her, hoping to escape the conversation.
"Angela," she continued, her voice softening with what seemed like pity. "When you find your true love, you'll understand how I feel."
I stopped in my tracks and stared at her for a moment. She had the nerve to say it so kindly, so confidently. I gave a forced smile.
"Oh? Really?" I said. "Well, I hope you enjoy cooking every day," I added, trying to edge around her.
But just as I thought I could get away, Sean's assistant, Michael, appeared in the hallway.
Christina practically beamed at the sight of him, standing up straighter as she greeted him with exaggerated enthusiasm.
"Michael! Did Sean send you to find me?" Christina asked, "Tell him I'll be there soon."
But it was Michael's next move that surprised me.
He looked at the lunchbox in Christina's hands, then at me. "Angela," he said with a grin, "Christina's cooking is amazing. The other day, Sean gave out some cookies she baked, and everyone loved them. Won't you try some?"
I shook my head. "No, I've already eaten."
"Angela doesn't want it," Michael said, turning to Christina with a playful grin. "So, can I have it?"
Christina's smile faltered for a moment as she glanced at the lunchbox, then back at him, clearly confused.
"This is for Sean, not for you guys," she said, but Michael wasn't done.
"It seems like Sean doesn't really care about it. He always shares it with us. How about this," he continued, "We won't make you do it for free-just name your price."
I watched as Christina's face darkened, her grip tightening on the lunchbox as her shoulders tensed.
"Michael, what's your attitude? Do you think I'm a chef or a maid?"
Michael threw his hands up, feigning innocence. "You misunderstood! I just think your cooking is really good!"
The conversation quickly spiraled as Christina struggled to keep her polite smile, but eventually, she gave up, muttering something under her breath before storming off.
I watched her go, wondering if she'd be complaining to Sean in the next office, but Michael's voice interrupted my thoughts.
"Who'd want to eat her food anyway?" he said with a laugh, rolling his eyes. "It's all store-bought. How dare she act like she made it herself?"
I couldn't help but laugh. "So you were just messing with her, huh?"
Michael leaned against the doorframe, still smirking. "I was standing up for you. You're spoiling her, Angela."
His words were an unexpected comfort. Michael and I rarely spoke outside of work, but somehow, I felt like he understood me more than most. It was strange, but oddly reassuring.
"Angela," he added, his tone turning serious, "Don't worry. No matter what anyone says, I've got your back. Don't disappoint me."
I didn't know how to respond. His words left me feeling uncertain, especially since I was starting to worry that I might disappoint him.
"Don't go against Christina anymore," I said.
Michael raised an eyebrow, clearly taken aback.
"Angela," he said, his voice softer now, "Don't worry about me. If Sean wants to fire me over that woman, then this company isn't worth working for."
A strange feeling stirred inside me. I respected him for saying that, but it also raised a question I couldn't shake.
What would Sean really do for Christina?
Would he sacrifice his employees just to keep her happy?
I couldn't help but wonder if Christina was already in Sean's office, telling him her side of the story.
As expected, my phone rang a moment later-Sean.
"Come to my office," he said before hanging up abruptly.
"I can't believe Sean would cause trouble for you because of that woman!" Michael said, his face angry, though mostly disappointed. "I'm going to talk to him now!"
"No need," I said, stopping him.
I was planning to quit anyway, but Michael still needed the job.
###chapter 38: Bite Marks
Angela POV
I stepped into Sean's office, and the moment the door clicked shut behind me, his voice hit me like a brick.
"Christina just wanted you to try the soup she made. Why did you have to insult her?"
Insult her?
I was already regretting walking in here.
How had Christina managed to twist things so badly?
I glanced at Sean, unsure whether to be angry or confused. He didn't look upset, though-just mildly amused, like he was enjoying this. His lips curled into a faint smirk, and his eyes were almost challenging me, daring me to respond.
I turned toward Christina, who was standing by the desk, her posture too stiff, her smile too sweet.
"Our agreement didn't say I had to eat your food," I said, my tone sharp.
I couldn't help but notice how her eyes flickered with worry when I mentioned the agreement.
Christina's smile faltered for a split second, but she quickly masked it with exaggerated innocence. She took a step forward, her voice sickeningly sweet.
"Angela, I really want to get along with you, to be friends. Why do you always reject me?"
I didn't bother hiding my annoyance. "The company hired me to do my job, not to make friends," I said, giving her a pointed look.
I turned to Sean. "Unless Mr. Shaw has something else for me, I need to get back to work."
I turned toward the door, eager to escape the tension, but before I could take a step, Sean was up from his desk, his hand grabbing my arm.
"Why do you always have to be so aggressive?" he said, his voice laced with frustration. "I just-"
"Let go," I snapped, pulling my arm out of his grip with more force than I'd intended.
I didn't understand it. We'd agreed to move on, to leave the past behind, but here he was, trying to drag me back into the mess.
"I just wanted to ask if you've had lunch," Sean said, clearly annoyed now, rolling up his sleeves as if trying to cool off. "If not-"
But before he could finish, Christina screamed, cutting him off.
"Sean, how did you hurt your arm?" she exclaimed, grabbing his arm and inspecting it like it was the most important thing in the world.
I glanced at the mark. A deep, purple bruise had already formed where my teeth had sunk into his skin last night.
I couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt, though I tried to push it away. It wasn't like it was intentional.
"It's nothing, just a scratch from a cat." Sean said quickly, pulling his sleeve down and avoiding my gaze.
But I could see the brief look he gave me, the one that silently said, Don't say anything.
"A scratch from a cat?" Christina asked, her eyes narrowing as she examined the wound more closely. "That doesn't look like a cat scratch."
"It's just a small injury," he said, brushing her off.
"Small injury? If an animal scratches or bites you, you need a vaccine!" Christina's voice was rising now, full of fake concern as she leaned in closer. "It looks like a bite, not a scratch."
I could feel the tension in the room, thick and suffocating. I exchanged an awkward glance with Sean, but I wasn't interested in staying for this.
With a sigh, I turned and walked out, closing the door behind me.
***
The clock struck noon the next day when Christina walked into the office, exactly on time. I barely looked up from my paperwork, assuming she was here for Sean. But then, to my surprise, she walked straight to me.
"Let's go to that café and talk," she said, her voice devoid of its usual sweetness. Today, there was nothing but coldness in her eyes.
I didn't have time for this. I had to teach Emily some new procedures later, and I wasn't in the mood to deal with Christina's games.
"Why can't we talk here?" I looked up at her, a little annoyed.
Christina didn't answer. Instead, she glanced around the room as if checking for anyone who might overhear us. Then, with a firm push, she nudged me back toward my office.
"Angela, why did you go back on your word?" she demanded, her voice sharp now.
I stopped short, staring at her. "What do you mean?"
She gritted her teeth, her hands trembling slightly, but her grip on the edge of the desk was so tight, her knuckles went white.
"Are you pretending? Do you remember the third rule in our agreement? No intimate contact with Sean before the divorce. Do you remember that?"
I looked her squarely in the eyes. "I remember. So?"
She was trembling with anger now, her face flushed. "Then did you follow it?"
"I did," I replied, not flinching. "Except when we need to pretend to be a happy couple in front of Elizabeth. Other than that, there's been no intimacy between me and him."
I felt confident in my words-after all, I'd stuck to the agreement. I thought I'd done well, but Christina wasn't having it.
"You're lying!" she slammed her fist against the desk. "You didn't follow the agreement!"
"Sean's arm-those bite marks-" she continued, her voice trembling with fury. "You did that, didn't you?"
I froze, the words sinking in slowly.
My mind raced. Was a fight considered "intimate contact" in her eyes?
"Why aren't you saying anything? Feeling guilty?" Christina's voice dropped, but her tone was venomous, cutting. "Tell me the truth."
"Yes, I bit him," I admitted, my voice flat, uninterested in the drama she was trying to create. "But it's not a big deal. If he hadn't... Anyway, it wasn't like I did it on purpose."
Christina's eyes flashed with disbelief, her hand shaking as she pointed at me. "So, he didn't force you to bite him?"
"I bit him in self-defense," I shook my head，"I didn't break the agreement. If you want to know more, go ask Sean yourself."
Christina's face turned pale, and I could see the fear creeping into her eyes. She stumbled over her words. "W-well"
She couldn't bring herself to ask Sean directly. She knew she couldn't-so she had come here, looking for something to latch onto, to find an excuse to accuse me.
"Are you sure you're telling the truth?" Christina's voice cracked. " Are you deliberately trying to cause problems between Sean and me?"
"Is that really necessary?" I asked, raising an eyebrow, my tone as flat as ever. "Besides, aren't you the woman he loves most?"
###chapter 39: Our First Real Moment Together
Angela POV
"Or are you actually insecure about him?"
She didn't flinch, but I could see her jaw tighten. For a moment, we just stood there, staring at each other.
Seeing she wasn't going to give in that easily, I softened my voice, stepping a little closer to her.
"Look, don't worry. Elizabeth's surgery is in a few days. Just hang in there a little longer. As long as everything goes as planned, I'll leave, and I won't come back for five years."
She folded her arms, her voice quiet but firm. "Alright. I'll trust you-for now. But you'd better keep your word when the time comes."
With that, she turned and walked out of my office without another word.
The sound of her footsteps faded, leaving the room in a thick, almost eerie silence.
I exhaled and let my gaze drop, my hand instinctively resting on my stomach.
"Baby," I whispered softly. "Let's just hope everything goes smoothly. When it's time, I'll take you to meet your grandfather. He'll love you so much."
The thought of my father brought a bittersweet ache to my chest. I had meant to tell him about the pregnancy. But every time I called, he was too busy.
The first time, he had rushed through the conversation, his voice distracted. The second time, he barely gave me a chance to speak before hanging up.
I understood why. His career was his focus right now-his comeback, his work.
***　
The day before Elizabeth's surgery, Sean and I decided to visit her at the nursing home, hoping to ease some of her anxiety. We picked up a few gifts, wanting to lift her spirits.
As soon as we arrived, I started sharing some funny stories from work-tales of strange clients and bizarre situations that had happened over the past week. Elizabeth's laughter filled the room, and for a moment, I could see the tension in her face start to fade.
Sean didn't say much, just sitting quietly beside me, watching. I caught his gaze more than once-gentle, warm, and strangely soft. It was a look I didn't often see from him.
As the evening wore on, I suggested that I stay the night with Elizabeth. I thought she might appreciate the company before her surgery tomorrow, but she waved it off with a tired smile.
"No need," she said. "I'm not a child. You two should go home and rest. Come back tomorrow."
I hesitated, but Sean stepped in and gently placed his hand on my arm. "Since Grandma says so, we'll come back early tomorrow."
Elizabeth nodded. "Exactly. It's late, and I need to rest."
I gave in, though reluctantly, and stepped forward to give her a hug.
"Alright," she said, reaching up to pinch my nose with a teasing grin. "You're getting more and more talkative, huh?"
I smiled, but inside, my heart tightened. I couldn't shake the feeling that it might be the last time I saw her. I pushed the thought away, not wanting to dwell on it.
Once we were back at home, sean slipped off his jacket, and his deep voice cut through the silence.
"Go take a shower, then rest early."
"Okay," I nodded, turning to grab my clothes.
But before I could leave, something lingered in my mind. I had been holding onto a question all day, one I wasn't sure was the right time to ask.
"Sean," I said, turning back around, "I need to ask you something."
He had already begun untying his tie, but when he heard my voice, he stopped. His dark eyes fixed on mine, sharp and unreadable.
"Go ahead,"
I hesitated for a moment, then asked, "Should we go to the divorce office before Grandma's surgery tomorrow, or wait until after?"
As soon as the words left my mouth, I felt the atmosphere shift. It was as if the air had grown colder, heavier.
I immediately realized it probably wasn't the right time to ask, especially with everything going on with Elizabeth. She was about to undergo surgery, and Sean was likely feeling the pressure of it all.
"I'm sorry," I said quickly, rushing to backtrack. "I shouldn't have brought this up now. Let's wait until after her surgery. You should rest."
But before I could turn to leave, Sean stepped forward, blocking my path. His voice dropped low, almost like a warning.
"You really want to get a divorce tomorrow, don't you?"
That wasn't what I meant, but before I could explain, he cut me off, his tone turning ice-cold. "Then, as you wish. We'll go to the civil affairs office when it opens tomorrow."
"Sean..." I stood there in shock for a moment, not sure what to say.
Sean didn't wait for me to respond. Without another glance, he turned and walked into the bathroom, his back stiff with tension.
The bathroom door slammed shut with a deafening bang.
I stood by the bed, my eyes lingering on the wedding photo still sitting on the bedside table. It felt surreal to look at it now, like a ###chapter from someone else's life.
I couldn't help but remember the day we took those photos. I had been so nervous, every tiny detail feeling like it mattered so much. The photographer kept directing me, and none of the shots seemed right.
"Miss Angela, relax your shoulders."
"Miss Angela, tilt your head just a little higher."
"Miss Angela, smile a bit wider."
......
I couldn't figure out why it was so hard. It was just a pretend wedding, after all-just an act. But despite knowing that, I was completely on edge.
I didn't even realize how tense I was until I felt Sean's hand gently wrap around mine, his voice soft in my ear.
"Don't be nervous, Mrs. Shaw."
And then, unexpectedly, his lips brushed against my earlobe, the lightest, teasing bite.
In that moment, everything else faded away. It wasn't much, but it was something real. A small, intimate touch that broke through the formality of it all.
And somehow, the photographer caught it-our first real moment together, captured forever in that shot.
###chapter 40: Went To Court 
Angela POV
When those memories resurfaced, the small moments of intimacy we once shared-those careless touches, the soft words-felt like sharp blades, each one slicing through me, reopening old wounds.
If only he had shown me even the slightest bit of affection, maybe I wouldn't feel so completely broken.
I sighed and took the wedding photo from the bedside table. I didn't want to look at it anymore, so I placed it into the drawer and shut it, hoping to leave the past behind.
Footsteps pulled me from my thoughts, and I looked up to see Sean standing behind me, freshly showered. He looked the same as always-calm, composed, distant.
"Cleaning up already?" he asked, his voice flat, his gaze fixed on me. "In a hurry?"
"Once Christina moves in, she won't want to see this," I said, trying to sound indifferent.
He opened his mouth as if to say something, but after a beat, all he said was, " I'll sleep in the study tonight."
And just like that, he was gone, leaving me standing in the emptiness of the room.
***
The alarm blared, dragging me from a restless sleep. Groggily, I pressed my hand to my forehead, wincing at the dull ache pounding there.
I hadn't slept much at all last night. Thoughts of Elizabeth's surgery, the divorce, and the baby kept cycling through my mind. Every time I closed my eyes, I drifted into a haze of jumbled dreams.
I sat up for a moment, trying to shake off the exhaustion. Then, dragging myself to the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would clear the fog.
When I looked up at the mirror, I almost didn't recognize myself. My face was pale, dark circles under my eyes, and my eyes themselves bloodshot and tired.
I quickly washed my face and threw on some makeup, trying to hide the signs of a sleepless night. My phone buzzed, and I saw a message from Sean.
"Come downstairs. I'm waiting in the garage."
His tone was as cold as ever.
I responded with a simple "ok" and grabbed my jacket, heading downstairs.
The morning was still young, and the chill in the air hit me as soon as I stepped outside.
Sean was leaning against the car, wearing nothing but a thin shirt, holding a cigarette between his fingers. He looked exhausted-his stubble unshaven, his eyes tired and dark.
He didn't move as I approached, and there was this strange silence between us.
After a long beat, he finally spoke.
"Did you sleep well last night?"
His voice was hoarse, and I hadn't realized how much until he asked.
I paused before answering, not quite meeting his gaze. "Yeah, pretty well. How about you?"
He flicked the cigarette away, his eyes locking onto mine. "Yeah, pretty well."
I nodded, though I could see the dark circles under his eyes and the tension in his face. He looked just as worn out as I felt. But of course, he was too proud to show it.
We stood in silence for a while. The air between us felt thick, uncomfortable. I shifted under his gaze and finally asked, "Shall we go?"
Sean didn't answer right away. Instead, he raised an eyebrow. "In a hurry?"
I shrugged, trying to keep my voice light. "I'm fine. Just worried you might be."
He scoffed, glancing at me. "What would I be in a hurry for?"
"How would I know what you're in a hurry for?"
His expression hardened for a second before he sighed, clearly irritated. "Did you bring the documents? Don't forget them at the court."
At that, I snapped. "I brought them. I prepared them last night. How could I forget?"
"Angela..." He seemed at a loss for words.
I didn't want to stand around any longer. I opened the car door, slid into the seat, and buckled up. I leaned out and said,
"Let's go. After the divorce, we'll head to the sanatorium."
Sean followed me into the driver's seat, his expression unreadable. The drive to the courthouse was quiet.
The early morning traffic was light, and soon, we were pulling up in front of the building.
Another ###chapter of this strange, painful day.
After getting out of the car, Sean walked ahead, his pace quick.
I followed behind and muttered under my breath, "Never saw you in such a rush when we got married!"
When we reached an office, he stormed in with a scowl, but a staff member stopped him at the door.
###chapter 41: You Both Can’t Afford To Be Hurt
Angela POV
"Sir, please wait your turn!" A middle-aged woman called gently from behind the desk.
I looked around and realized there were several couples ahead of us, all sitting with the same heavy expressions, avoiding eye contact. We sat down in silence, the weight of the situation settling over us.
Then Sean broke the silence. "Did you eat breakfast?"
I blinked, surprised. "Huh?"
"Do you want something to eat?" there was a slight softening in his features.
"Are you asking me?" I asked, confused.
His eyes flashed with impatience. "Is there anyone else here but you?"
"No, I'm not hungry."
Without another word, Sean stood up. "I'll go get you breakfast. You wait here."
He walked toward the door before I could protest. His sudden shift in behavior left me confused. One minute he was cold, and the next he was going out to get me food.
By the time he came back with a cup of hot milk and a sandwich, the staff was already calling our names.
"Angela, Sean," the woman said, glancing up from her paperwork.
We hurried into the office.
"Is the property division settled?" she asked, barely looking up as she checked our IDs.
"It's settled," Sean replied, handing her a document before I could speak.
"Do you have children?" she asked without lifting her eyes.
"No," we answered at the same time.
I gripped the cup of milk, my fingers trembling slightly.
I glanced at Sean, his face unreadable. It was clear-he wasn't expecting this child. The long leave he'd given me last month was probably to give me time to take care of it, to end it quietly.
If he knew... if he knew the baby was still here, would he want it to stay?
I quickly pushed the thought aside. There was no need to tell him. He didn't need to know.
I set the breakfast he bought me aside, my appetite gone. The warm milk felt empty now, a gesture that didn't change anything.
"Can we get this done quickly?" I asked, my impatience showing.
The woman glanced up at me, understanding in her eyes. She nodded.
"No problem. I'll print the papers. You can sign them in a minute."
I turned to look at Sean. His gaze was intense, almost like he was trying to see through me.
"Angela," he said, his voice sharp with sarcasm. "Looks like these two years of marriage have really been tough on you."
"It wasn't tough," I said flatly. "Just... tiring."
Before he could respond, his phone rang. He checked the caller ID and frowned.
"It's the sanatorium," he said, his voice low.
I felt a chill run through me. "Then answer it!"
He picked up the call, and I watched as his face grew darker with every word.
When he hung up, my heart sank. I grabbed his hand, fear creeping up inside me.
"What happened?" I asked.
"Elizabeth's in a coma," he said, standing up, his voice tight with urgency. "I have to go."
I followed him immediately, panic rising in my chest.
Behind us, the staff muttered as we rushed out.
"Where are they going all of a sudden?" one woman said. "If they weren't sure, they shouldn't have come."
I stepped out of the courthouse, my mind racing with all the things left unsaid between us.
But as I started to cross the street toward Sean's car, I was too distracted to notice the traffic light had turned red. My heart pounded, thoughts scattered, my body moving on autopilot.
Then, out of nowhere, a car barreled toward me.
Time slowed as I froze, panic flooding my chest. My legs felt heavy, unresponsive, and before I could take a single step back, the vehicle was too close.
"Angela!" Sean's voice cracked through the air.
In an instant, he was there, yanking me back with surprising force. My feet slipped, my balance faltered, and the next thing I knew, I was falling forward, landing hard against his chest.
We hit the ground with a thud. My lips brushed against his throat, just above the pulse point. Sean's arms wrapped around me, holding me tightly against him as if trying to shield me from everything around us.
For a moment, I was frozen, caught in the intensity of the position, the rush of emotions, the panic in his grip. His heart pounded against my chest, and I could feel the heat of his body beneath mine.
"Get up," he said, his voice strained but urgent, "How long are you going to stay on top of me?"
My mind snapped back to reality. I pulled my face away, feeling the heat rush to my cheeks as I realized what had happened. The world around us felt like it came to a screeching halt.
People were gathering, staring at us, their eyes wide with curiosity and judgment. My stomach dropped with embarrassment.
I quickly scrambled off him, my knees shaky as I stood up.
"Are you hurt?" Sean asked, his tone softer now but still laced with concern. His eyes searched me, looking for any sign of injury.
"No... I'm fine."I shook my head.
But my eyes flicked to his shirt-his white shirt-now smudged with dirt. His left shoulder had a small smear of blood on it.
"You're hurt," I said, my voice catching in my throat.
Sean didn't respond right away. He simply grabbed my hand tightly and led me toward the car.
The grip on my hand was firm, like he was trying to hold me together, to make sure I was real, that I hadn't been broken in the chaos of those seconds.
When we reached the car, he opened the passenger door for me. His face was pale, but his eyes were intense, and I could see the concern still etched there.
"You know how dangerous that was?" His voice was low, almost strained. "Didn't you see the red light?"
I thought he was angry, and my heart sank. I slid into the passenger seat, fumbling with the seatbelt, my hands still shaky.
"I'm sorry," I whispered, my voice cracking. "I wasn't paying attention. I just I was so worried about Elizabeth, and I" I paused, glancing at him, noticing the blood on his shoulder again. "I'm sorry. I caused you to get hurt."
His expression softened for a moment, but his eyes remained clouded with something deeper, something I couldn't quite place.
I glanced at his shoulder, my voice barely audible. "Your shoulder is it hurting? Should I drive instead?"
Sean turned to face me, his eyes unexpectedly red and wet.
His usual composure was cracked, and for a moment, I saw the raw vulnerability beneath the surface. His voice softened, and he exhaled slowly.
"I'm fine. Just a scratch," he said gently. "But you don't ever put yourself in danger like that again, okay? You and my grandmother... you both can't afford to be hurt."
###chapter 42: What I Was, Was Terrified
Sean POV
When I saw that car speeding toward Angela, my heart stopped. Time seemed to freeze for a split second as my mind went blank. I didn't think. I didn't hesitate. I just moved.
My legs propelled me forward as if they had a mind of their own. There was no question in my head-I couldn't let her get hurt.
I reached her just as she froze in the middle of the street, too caught in her thoughts to move. Without a second thought, I grabbed her, yanking her into my arms. We both fell to the ground, the impact of the fall sharp against the pavement.
For a moment, all I could hear was the rush of blood in my ears, my breath ragged as I clutched her to me.
I was afraid to let go, afraid to check if she was okay, afraid that if I did, she might be hurt. But I could feel her-her soft, warm body pressed tightly against mine, her breath a steady rhythm under my fingers.
I held her tighter, relief flooding through me in waves.
I couldn't get rid of the images from the seconds before. The car coming straight for her. The way she hadn't seen it. The fear that had clenched my chest so tightly I couldn't breathe.
But as I held her, my mind began to calm.
She was okay.
She was real.
She was safe.
I even felt the warmth of her lips brush against my throat, soft and almost hesitant, like she didn't realize what had just happened.
The world around us started to return to normal. I was aware of the whispers, the murmurs of the onlookers who had gathered.
"Are you two alright?" A voice from the crowd.
I barely acknowledged them, my focus only on Angela. I could still feel the heat of her body in my arms, the way her chest rose and fell with each breath.
My fingers tightened around her, and I couldn't let go-not yet.
When we finally got to our feet, I made sure to keep my hand firmly wrapped around hers. The grip was tighter than necessary, but I didn't care.
As I stood there, my mind still racing from the events that had just unfolded, Angela's voice broke through the haze.
"Your shoulder... it's bleeding."
It wasn't until she spoke that I felt a sharp, insistent pain shooting from my left shoulder.
But the pain in my shoulder was nothing compared to the fear of losing her.
She was apologizing again, her voice soft, uncertain. "I'm so sorry, Sean..."
I wanted to tell her that it wasn't anger I was feeling, that I wasn't mad at her. I wasn't angry at all. What I was, was terrified.
Our two years of marriage had been a lie.
But the memories we shared-the countless moments where we laughed together, where we comforted each other-those were real.
We'd known each other for so long-since we were kids, sharing secrets and dreams, seeing each other at our worst and our best.
Even now, as we were about to part ways, I couldn't imagine my life without her in it.
"I wasn't paying attention. I just I was so worried about Elizabeth, and I" Angela explained.
"I can understand!"
I could see the truth in her eyes. I knew she cared for Elizabeth, just as much as I did. Their bond was undeniable-one forged over years of friendship and shared moments.
I also understood why.
Angela had lost her mother when she was young, and I often wondered if Elizabeth's care for her had filled that void, even if just a little.
I remembered before we even got married, how Elizabeth had shared advice with Angela-advice on dealing with things like menstrual pain, things women often discuss among themselves in private.
It was those small, intimate exchanges that spoke to the closeness they shared.
When Elizabeth found out I was going to marry Angela, her concern was less about the wedding itself and more about me-she wanted to make sure I would treat Angela well, that I wouldn't hurt her.
But if Elizabeth knew the truth, if she knew this marriage was just a formality, a lie we'd been living... I couldn't help but think that two years ago, she would never have supported it. She would've seen right through us.
It hurt to think about that-how we had deceived the people closest to us, how we had played this role without ever being honest. But Angela and I were too deep in it now, tangled in the mess we'd created.
And if Elizabeth ever found out... I couldn't bear to think of the disappointment in her eyes.
***
When we arrived at the sanatorium, the doctor looked at me with a bit of surprise but quickly composed himself.
I could only imagine how bad I looked-probably like a zombie. I hadn't slept at all last night, dark circles under my eyes, and I hadn't shaved in two days. On top of that, Angela and Elizabeth had almost scared me half to death today.
"Elizabeth fainted because of the stress. Her vital signs are normal, and there's nothing else to worry about," the doctor said.
Both Angela and I let out a relieved breath.
But then the doctor added, "That said, given her current mental state, it's not ideal to perform surgery right now."
"What can we do? Is there a solution?" Angela asked, her voice filled with worry.
"We'll start her on medication to help stabilize her, but you'll also need to support her emotionally," the doctor explained.
Angela pressed her lips together, clearly troubled by the news.
I stepped closer and took her hand. "We'll help her get through this. Let's go see her now."
Angela nodded, then suddenly paused.
"Wait, let the nurse clean the wound on your shoulder first."
###chapter 43: Surgery Was Delayed
Sean POV
"It's just a small injury, nothing to worry about," I said, brushing it off.
But for some reason, her concern made something stir inside me-a flicker of warmth I hadn't expected.
This morning, when she'd been urging me to hurry up and finalize the divorce paperwork, I felt a sharp burst of anger. I thought she didn't care about me at all.
But now... now, it seemed like she did-at least a little.
Then she spoke again, and the warmth faded as quickly as it had appeared.
"I'm not worried about your injury," she said, her voice flat. "I'm just afraid Elizabeth will get more upset if she sees you like this."
I felt the familiar frustration rise in my chest.
"Fine," I muttered, turning and heading toward the medical room.
The nurses were all busy, so Angela offered to help clean the wound.
She stood in front of me, her fingers moving with precision as she undid the buttons on my shirt. I couldn't help but watch her. Her face was unreadable, no sign of anything behind her eyes. It was as if I was just another patient, just another task.
"What are you staring at?" Her voice was sharper than I expected. "Just take it off yourself."
I shot back quickly, "I wasn't staring at you. Don't get the wrong idea." I yanked my shirt off and tossed it aside, trying to hide the slight embarrassment creeping up my neck.
She cleaned the wound carefully with distilled water, then applied iodine. The sting made me flinch slightly, and I couldn't help but shrug.
"Does it hurt?" she asked, her voice softer than before.
"No," I said, but the warmth of her breath on my neck made me feel something else entirely-something much less comfortable.
Once she finished, she placed a large band-aid on the wound. I put my shirt back on, then turned around. Our eyes met for a second, and something caught in my throat.
Her makeup was heavier today-darker than usual.
She'd always been the type to wear light, natural makeup. But today, her eyes had that red, tired look to them, and I couldn't help but wonder if the makeup was just a mask.
Had she been up all night? Had she been crying?
"Didn't you say you slept well last night?" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. "Your eyes look like you haven't slept at all."
She rolled her eyes.
"Not as bad as yours," she replied. "Come on, let's go. Elizabeth should be waking up soon."
"When did you get so sharp-tongued?" I asked, raising an eyebrow, but she didn't respond.
When we got to Elizabeth's room, the caregivers were there. They quickly reassured us that Elizabeth was still asleep, but everything seemed stable.
Angela nodded, her face serious. "Thanks. We'll stay here. You go ahead and take care of what you need to."
She sat by Elizabeth's bed, her movements so light it was almost like she was trying not to disturb the air itself.
A few minutes passed in silence, and then my phone rang. I glanced down-it was Christina.
I quickly switched it to silent, but Angela must have seen the name. She looked at me for a brief second, then turned away, like she was trying not to acknowledge it.
"You should go out and take it," she said quietly.
I paused, my hand still on the door. I wasn't sure why, but something about the way she said it made me feel... guilty. Like I was doing something wrong by just being here, by not dealing with things.
I hesitated for a moment longer, then stepped outside to take the call.
"Sean?" Christina's voice came through the phone, full of concern.
I paused, trying to keep my emotions in check, even though I wasn't in the best mood. "Is something wrong?"
"I didn't sleep much last night," she said, her voice worried. "I'm really worried about your grandmother's surgery. How's Elizabeth? Can I... come by and check on her? Don't worry, I'll just stay outside the room and won't disturb her."
Her tone was so soft, almost pleading, that I couldn't help but frown.
Christina had saved me once, and I owed her so much. She should be my wife. But now, with everything that had happened, I couldn't shake the thought of Elizabeth. She seemed to be more drawn to Angela these years. I wasn't sure she'd want to see Christina at all.
"Elizabeth hasn't gone into surgery yet," I said.
There was a pause on the other end of the line, then Christina asked, "Oh? Did the surgery get delayed or...?"
"Yes, it's been delayed. Elizabeth fainted this morning from anxiety," I replied, glancing toward Elizabeth's room. "The surgery will be pushed back for a while."
"Ah... postponed? How long?" Christina sounded shocked.
"We're not sure yet," I said quietly. "It could be days... or more."
"Then... you and Angela..." she trailed off, as if unsure whether to ask.
Just then, I heard familiar laughter from the room. My grandmother must've woken up. I didn't catch what Christina said next, too distracted by the sound of her voice, so I quickly cut her off.
"I'll contact you later," I said.
Without waiting for her response, I hung up and put the phone in my pocket.
###chapter 44: We’ll Make Sure You Get Justice
Christina POV
Doo doo-
The busy tone echoed through my phone as I stood there, frozen.
I had thought that today, with Elizabeth's surgery going smoothly, Sean and Angela would finalize their divorce. So, last night, I arranged a little celebration with a few friends at a resort, thinking we'd be toasting to a fresh start.
"How'd it go, Christina? Was that Sean on the phone?" One of my friends asked, holding up a glass of champagne.
I nodded, but it felt like my heart was sinking.
She didn't seem to notice, though. Still, she wrapped her arm around me, her voice bright. "Wow, congratulations! Is Sean coming by later? Can we stick around to celebrate with you?"
"Finally! Your Sean can get rid of that woman. After today, you'll be the real CEO's wife, right?"
"Mrs. Shaw, don't forget about us when you get rich!" another friend teased, laughing.
"And when you get married, I better be on the VIP guest list!"
"I want first-class seats! Oh, and Christina, toss the bouquet to me! I might marry my boyfriend by the end of the year."
"Really? You're getting married? Congrats!"
The words kept coming, each one a stab of discomfort, but they didn't notice. I couldn't take it anymore.
"Can you all just stop talking?" I snapped, my voice sharper than I intended.
The room fell silent, everyone blinking at me in confusion.
"Christina...?"
"You're just going on and on about yourselves, and no one's even asking how I'm doing," I said, my voice rising before I could stop it. "Don't you realize how selfish you're being?"
The surprise on their faces hit me like a cold wave. I was the easygoing one, always polite, always the listener. To see me snap like this seemed to shake them.
I took a deep breath, feeling my anger and frustration slip away. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to explode like that. I've just been in a bad mood. I I apologize."
I let my eyes well up with tears, wanting to salvage what little grace I had left. The last thing I needed was for them to see me as weak, but I didn't know how else to act.
My friends immediately softened, concern flooding their faces.
"Christina, what's going on? Please don't cry."
"If something's wrong, just tell us. We'll help you, okay?"
I wiped my eyes, forcing a small, sad smile. "It's just... Sean told me he's not going to divorce yet."
The words felt like a punch in the stomach, and I immediately wished I hadn't said anything.
"What? Not getting divorced? Why?"
"But we all agreed-once Elizabeth's surgery was done, he'd go through with it. What changed?"
"I know, it's that Angela, isn't it?" one friend said, narrowing her eyes. "She's holding onto Sean, doesn't want to let him go."
I opened my mouth, ready to explain, but before I could, another friend jumped in. "I knew it! She's lying to you, Christina. Don't trust her!"
"Don't worry," another friend said firmly. "If she dares to take your Sean, we won't let her get away with it."
I had been planning to just wait until Elizabeth was out of surgery. But with my friends now riled up, I couldn't help but start to entertain another thought.
What if... what if I could get rid of the child Angela was carrying?
Even if everything eventually came to light, if Sean found out, the child would be gone. The threat would disappear.
And then, when everything came out, my friends could take the fall. I wouldn't have to face any consequences.
To solidify their support, I softened my tone. "Don't be so harsh on her. Maybe Angela has her reasons."
"Reasons?" One friend scoffed. "What reason could she have to hang onto someone else's boyfriend for this long? She probably just wants to be a mistress and doesn't want to let Sean go."
"Exactly," another added. "How could she give up being Mrs. Shaw? Christina, you're too kind. Why didn't you stop Sean when he first asked her to fake a marriage?"
I didn't answer. What could I say? I wanted to stop it, but...
I lowered my gaze and fell silent.
"Don't ask Christina about it. You all know how generous she is. She felt bad for Angela when her family went bankrupt. But Angela? She's just using her family's situation to play the victim. She's shameless."
"Christina, don't worry. We'll make sure you get justice," one friend promised.
I could feel their support. They were on my side, completely.
"Please... don't. I know you're trying to help, but Angela's still in the hospital, taking care of Sean's grandmother. She's doing what she can."
They paused, taking in my words.
"Really? Well, in a few days, we'll teach her a lesson. We won't let her get away with this."
I forced a smile, even as the plan started to take shape in my mind. "No need. Let's not ruin the mood today. We're here to relax, after all. Let's just enjoy ourselves. I'm buying."
"Christina..."
I uncorked a bottle of red wine and grabbed some glasses from the cabinet.
I knew it now. I had them all on my side.
###chapter 45: Who’s That Woman
Sean POV
When I walked back into the hospital room, I was surprised to hear Grandma laughing-really laughing.
Angela had clearly told her some joke. But instead of feeling relieved, a tight knot formed in my chest.
The more Angela and Grandma bonded, the more unsettled I felt. It was as if the closer they grew, the harder it would be to tell Grandma about the divorce.
What if she took it badly?
What if it made her so upset that she collapsed again, like before?
The thought made me wince.
As I stood there in the doorway, lost in my worries, Grandma noticed me. Her face brightened when she saw me. "Ah, there you are," she said, her voice soft with affection.
"How are you feeling, Grandma?" I asked, walking over to her bedside. "Are you hungry?"
Grandma waved me off with a smile. "Angela already made sure I'm taken care of. She's having mushroom soup sent up." She patted Angela's hand, clearly proud of her.
"As long as I can see you both, I'm fine."
Not long after, the nurse brought in the soup. Angela immediately took charge, gently feeding Grandma herself.
There was something about the way Angela cared for Grandma that made her seem like she was already a part of the family.
Once Grandma finished her soup, she sat back against her pillows, her gaze softening. "You two should head back to the office now," she said, sounding almost guilty. "I've wasted your whole day."
"Grandma, how could spending time with you be a waste?" I said. My frustration with the situation was starting to show.
Angela smiled at me, her tone calm. "We're happy to be here with you, not just because it's our responsibility. You need to get better so you can be ready for the surgery."
Grandma shook her head. "I'm getting old, dear. Whether I have the surgery or not it doesn't really matter. I don't want to be a burden to you."
"Grandma, don't say that," I said quickly.
The doctor had warned me that if she didn't have the surgery, she might not make it another two years.
"We need to talk about this. You don't have much time."
Angela, sensing my anxiety, spoke to Grandma gently."What if we bring you home to stay with us? It'll be better than here. You'll be more comfortable, and we'll be able to take care of you."
"No, your house isn't like a nursing home. There's no one there to look after me the way they do here."Grandma hesitated.
With a soft sigh, she lay back down, clearly exhausted.
I didn't want to pressure her anymore. She needed rest, and I wasn't about to disturb that. I motioned for Angela to follow me out of the room.
But as soon as we stepped into the hallway, Angela's frustration poured out.
"How can we leave her here alone like this? Can't you see how much stress she's under about the surgery?"
"But she doesn't want to come back with us, Angela. She needs rest. We can't push her."I rubbed my temples, trying to stay calm.
"We shouldn't have left her at the nursing home yesterday. And we shouldn't have gone to handle the divorce paperwork this morning. We should've been here earlier. This is all my fault."
Angela's voice cracked with guilt.
I realized then that Angela wasn't angry with me-she was blaming herself. Her guilt was weighing her down.
"I understand," I said softly. "I'll talk to her. I'll convince her to come home with us tonight."
I arranged for Grandma's things to be packed up and for the housemaid to prepare her room. I even bought a bouquet of her favorite tulips. An hour later, Angela and I returned to Grandma's room, where she looked up, clearly surprised to see us again.
"What are you two doing here?" she asked, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.
"I had the driver bring your things home," I said. "You're coming with us tonight. No arguments."
"You didn't ask for my permission!" Grandma grumbled, though her eyes were full of amusement.
"Just listen to Sean. You won't be staying here tonight anyway." Angela added.
Grandma hesitated but allowed us to help her out of bed. She grumbled a bit more, but the smile on her face said it all-she was happy we were there. As much as she pretended to resist, I could see that she was relieved to have us by her side.
Angela had been right all along. Grandma may have seemed independent, but deep down, she was scared of the surgery and longed to be with family.
On the drive home, the mood lightened. Angela and Grandma chatted and laughed, their conversation easy and full of warmth. For the first time all day, I felt a sense of relief.
During the drive, my phone rang. It was my mother.
She asked about Grandma's surgery. Grandma answered the phone with a calm, reassuring tone, telling my mother that the surgery would be delayed and that she shouldn't worry about rushing back to see her.
"With Sean and Angela here, I'm in good hands," Grandma said, her voice steady.
"Then we'll come tomorrow and have dinner with you," my mother said on the other end, her tone relieved.
Hearing that made me feel lighter. We hadn't had a family gathering in so long, and knowing that one was coming made Grandma even happier.
"Don't forget the doctor's orders-no alcohol," Angela teased Grandma.
Grandma shot her a playful look. "You little thing, you're even more nagging than Sean!"
I couldn't help but laugh. It felt good to finally relax, to let go of the tension I'd been carrying all day.
As we pulled into the driveway, though, I noticed something that made my heart skip a beat. A familiar figure stood near the entrance, speaking to the building security.
She was dressed in a white dress, and as the security guard gestured toward us, she turned and looked in our direction.
The headlights of the car illuminated her face.
It was Christina.
I froze for a second, my heart tightening. Why was she here?
"Who's that woman?" Grandma asked, her voice curious. "She looks... familiar."
I didn't know what to say. All I could do was watch as Christina stood there, looking right at us.
###chapter 46: Whose Bed Will You Claim?
Angela POV
The car rolled to a stop at the entrance of the estate, headlights casting long shadows in the cold night.
My heart skipped a beat, and for a moment, I wasn't sure how to respond to Elizabeth's words.
I shifted my gaze to Sean.
From the back seat, we'd already spotted Christina-there was no way Sean, in the driver's seat, hadn't noticed her too.
Before the engine even fully died, Christina had already made her way to the driver's side, her small hand tapping lightly on the window.
With a quiet hum, the window slid down. Christina smiled, her voice soft, almost coaxing.
"Sean, you're back. How's your Grandma? I know you told me not to worry, but I still wanted to come and ask in person."
Her gaze flickered past him, landing on me and Elizabeth in the back seat. The warmth in her expression faltered for just a second before she masked it with another smile.
Elizabeth studied her, her brows knitting together slightly.
I kept my voice calm and even. "Elizabeth, don't you remember her? Christina-she once saved Sean."
Elizabeth's eyes widened slightly in realization.
"Oh! Of course! No wonder I didn't recognize you-you've grown even more beautiful. Don't hold it against me, will you?"
Now that she knew who Christina was, her tone softened, polite and appreciative.
Christina shook her head with a sweet smile. "Oh, don't be silly. How could I be mad over something like that?"
She turned back to me. "I actually asked Angela about you before. I didn't expect to see you again so soon."
She seemed like she wanted to say more, but Sean cut in before she could.
"Get in the car. We'll talk inside."
The night air was sharp, and Christina was dressed far too lightly for the weather. The thin fabric of her dress did little to shield her from the cold, and I could already see the way her skin had gone pale, the tip of her nose red from the chill.
She looked delicate. Vulnerable.
She knew it too.
Still, she shook her head with a soft laugh.
"It's too late. I won't go inside-it's not very convenient. I mainly came to check on your grandma after her surgery. Since she's fine, I can head back now with peace of mind."
She made no move to leave, though, standing there in the cold like some tragic heroine from an old film.
I glanced at her dress, piecing it together.
It was obvious-she was putting on a show.
She must have heard Sean and I couldn't divorce yet and panicked, rushing here in the dead of night, dressed like this, to win his pity.
What she hadn't expected was to run into Elizabeth.
To keep Elizabeth from suspecting anything, I spoke up first.
"It's not that late. Just come inside for some hot tea. I'll have the driver take you home later."
Christina looked at me, clearly surprised. She hadn't expected an invitation from me. But something clicked in her mind a second later, and she nodded gracefully.
"Okay, Angela. Thank you."
Instead of getting into the passenger seat beside Sean, she made her way to the back and slid in next to me.
Clever. She knew exactly when to keep her distance, playing the part of the considerate friend.
When we arrived home, Sarah's brows lifted slightly at the unexpected guest, but she quickly smoothed her expression and went to prepare tea.
Elizabeth struck up a conversation about Christina's life in Paris, but Christina seemed different tonight-less confident, more careful. Her gaze kept flickering toward Sean, as if searching for something in his expression.
When the clock struck ten, Sean spoke up.
"The doctor said you need to rest before ten, Grandma."
Christina let out a slow breath, as if she'd been waiting for that. But just as she relaxed, Elizabeth turned to her with an unexpected suggestion.
"Christina, it's late. Why don't you stay the night? Angela can have the maid prepare a guest room for you."
Christina, who had just taken a bite of a pastry, froze mid-chew. She quickly set it down and shook her head.
"Oh, that's really not necessary. I wouldn't want to be a bother."
"Nonsense," Elizabeth said lightly. "There are plenty of guest rooms, and it's no trouble at all. Stay the night."
There was no room for argument.
Christina hesitated for a moment before offering a small nod. "Alright, if you insist."
After Elizabeth left, she turned to Sean, lowering her voice.
"Sean are you sure it's okay for me to stay?"
She asked, but she didn't move. She had no intention of leaving.
"One night won't make a difference," Sean said simply. His face was unreadable.
Christina hesitated, then turned to me, her voice soft, almost cautious.
"Angela you don't mind, do you?"
I looked at her, then let out a quiet laugh.
"Of course not. I'm thrilled. Do you want me to prepare my bedroom for you?"
Her expression faltered, caught off guard.
"What do you mean by that?" she asked, a trace of irritation slipping through her usual sweet demeanor.
Sean frowned. "There's no need for that, Angela. Grandma is still home."
I nearly laughed at the irony. If he cared so much about Grandma being here, he might've kept his little mistress on a tighter leash.
Christina's face softened again as she turned to Sean, her voice laced with hesitation.
"Sean, did I say something wrong? I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset Angela. Maybe I should just go."
She stood abruptly, her movements just a little too hurried, her steps just a little too unsteady as she stumbled toward the door.
She barely made it past Sean before he caught her wrist, stopping her in place.
"Grandma asked you to stay. Just stay," he said flatly. "Don't worry about what Angela says."
The grip he had on her arm sent a bitter taste to the back of my throat.
I scoffed under my breath and turned toward the stairs, heading to my room without another word.
I didn't hear Sean follow me.
Instead, I heard Sarah's voice, calm and measured.
"Miss Christina, your guest room is ready."
###chapter 47: Do You Really Think So Little of Me?
Angela POV
The moment I shut the bedroom door behind me, I headed straight for the bathroom. My hands gripped the edge of the sink as I stared at my reflection in the mirror.
I looked exhausted.
Christina's pitiful expression from earlier flashed in my mind, making my stomach twist. I clenched my jaw, forcing the feeling down. I wouldn't let her get to me. She wasn't worth it.
They say a mother's emotions can affect her unborn child. I needed to stay calm.
A sudden sound broke my thoughts.
The bathroom door swung open without warning.
Sean.
His tall frame filled the doorway, making the already spacious bathroom feel small and suffocating.
I turned my gaze back to the mirror, my fingers tightening against the cool porcelain. "What do you want?"
"What did you mean by what you said just now?" Sean's voice was low, edged with frustration.
I let out a short, humorless laugh. "What do you think? I was just giving you what you wanted. Don't you want to share a room with Christina?"
His frown deepened, his silence stretching between us like a drawn bowstring.
I had no interest in whatever excuse he was about to throw my way. I turned to leave, but he didn't move. He was blocking the doorway.
"Excuse me," I said flatly.
Sean stood firm, unmoving.
I shifted to his left, trying to squeeze past, but just as I was about to get through, he stepped in my way again.
I exhaled sharply, biting back my irritation. "Move."
He didn't.
I tried the other side. Same result.
Annoyance flared, hot and sharp. "Sean, what is your problem? If you're so free, why don't you go find your little lover?"
I barely got the words out before his hands were on me, grabbing my shoulders and pushing me back against the cold tile wall.
My breath hitched.
His grip was firm, unyielding, his body close enough that I could feel the heat radiating off him.
I glared up at him, refusing to look away. "What the hell are you doing? Did I hit a nerve?"
Sean didn't answer. He just stared at me, his expression unreadable.
Then, without warning, he leaned down, his lips crashing against mine.
I gasped, but he didn't give me a chance to protest. His kiss was rough, almost desperate, his breath warm and familiar against my skin.
A bitter pang twisted in my chest.
I used to crave this.
Back then, his rare kisses had felt like stolen moments, something I had secretly treasured. But this-this wasn't like before. This was frustration, anger, something deeper he refused to say aloud.
I pushed against his chest, shoving him back with all my strength. The moment I broke free, I didn't hesitate-I slapped him, hard.
The sharp crack echoed in the bathroom.
Sean stilled.
A red mark bloomed across his cheek, but he didn't flinch. He just stood there, his gaze dark and unreadable.
My chest rose and fell, my lips tingling from his kiss. I wiped them furiously before brushing past him toward the door.
But before I could take more than two steps, his hand wrapped around my wrist, yanking me back.
"Let me go," I snapped, struggling against his grip.
Sean held on tighter.
I glared up at him. "What the hell is wrong with you? If you're so horny, go to Christina. Don't touch me."
Something in his expression shifted-his eyes darkened, sharp as a blade. "What did you just say?"
I lifted my chin, refusing to back down. "I said, if you're horny, go find the person you should be with. Don't take it out on me."
I smirked. "It's not like this is your first time sleeping together, right? Relax. You helped me when my family went bankrupt-if you need me to, I can cover for you. Elizabeth will never find out. Sound good?"
Sean's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean we've already slept together? Are you misunderstanding something?"
"Misunderstanding?"
Seriously? He had the nerve to call this a misunderstanding?
Sean let out a slow breath. "It's not what you think. That night, she twisted her ankle, and I took her to the hospital. But I didn't-"
"I don't care what happened that night," I cut in, my tone flat. "You don't need to explain."
What, did he think as long as I hadn't caught them in bed with my own eyes, it didn't count as cheating?
What a joke. Ever since Christina came back, he'd been staying out late almost every night. Who knew what they were really up to?
I reminded myself-stay calm, don't let this get to me.
After a few deep breaths, I looked at Sean again, my gaze now cool and unreadable.
He noticed.
For a long moment, he just stared at me. Then, he let out a short, humorless laugh.
"I wouldn't stoop so low as to sleep with another woman before finalizing my divorce. Do you really think that little of me?"
"I don't care."
His fingers twitched against my wrist. "Am I really that terrible in your eyes?"
I let out a slow breath. "Does it matter?"
His gaze flickered, like he wanted to say something, but the words never came.
I reached up and brushed the corner of his mouth where my slap had split his lip. My touch was light, almost absentminded.
"Sorry about that," I murmured. "Does it hurt? If you want to stay with Christina tonight，I can help you."
His grip on me tightened, his patience wearing thin. "Do you have to keep bringing this up?"
"Let go," I said quietly.
He didn't.
For a long moment, neither of us moved. The bathroom felt suffocatingly silent.
Then-
A knock at the bedroom door.
Sean didn't move.
Another knock.
His jaw ticked. "What?" he barked, voice sharp.
A brief pause, then a soft, hesitant voice.
"It's it's me."
Christina.
I let out a short, amused chuckle and glanced up at him, shaking my trapped wrist lightly.
"Are you still not letting go?" I murmured. "If you don't go out soon, your little lover is going to get anxious."
###chapter 48: How Did Your Lipstick End Up On His Mouth？
Angela POV
Sean finally released my wrist and turned away, striding toward the door. The moment he left, I couldn't help but let out a mocking smile.
Through the door, I heard Sean's irritated voice. "What do you want?"
I froze. In all our years of knowing each other, I had never heard Sean speak to Christina with such obvious annoyance.
"Sean, I just I need to borrow sleepwear from Angela. Sarah didn't prepare the guest room properly...."
I couldn't help but laugh to myself. Was she really here just to borrow sleepwear?
Or was it an excuse to check up on me? Or perhaps she was looking for a chance to get closer to Sean?
When I opened the bedroom door, the tableau before me was exactly what I'd expected.
Christina stood too close to Sean. Her fingers fidgeted with her Cartier bracelet, drawing attention to her delicate wrists.
She'd positioned herself perfectly in the warm glow of the crystal chandelier, the light catching the red highlights in her hair.
"Oh, Angela!" Her surprise seemed genuine, though we both knew it wasn't. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything. I just needed to borrow some sleepwear..."
As she spoke, her eyes traveled over me with careful attention, searching for any tell-tale signs of intimacy with Sean-a misplaced hair, smudged makeup, or wrinkled clothing that might betray what had transpired between us moments ago.
I met her gaze steadily. "Of course not. Come in-the closet's this way."
Sean's eyes followed us as we moved past him, his expression unreadable. The small cut at the corner of his mouth seemed darker now, more pronounced against his tanned skin.
The walk-in closet was a testament to the lifestyle I'd married into-rows of designer clothing, shelves of carefully arranged accessories, all bathed in soft, flattering light.
Christina's eyes darted around, her expression darkening before she forced a smile, her voice thick with envy.
"Your closet is absolutely beautiful, Angela. Sean really takes good care of you, doesn't he?"
I didn't answer her. Instead, I thought to myself, won't all of this be yours soon enough?
As soon as we were out of Sean's earshot, her demeanor shifted. The vulnerability vanished, replaced by something harder, more calculating.
"You promised," she said quietly, her voice tight with controlled anger. "You said you'd leave after Elizabeth's surgery."
I turned to face her, keeping my expression neutral. "The surgery was postponed."
"That's not what we agreed to."
"No," I acknowledged, "it wasn't. But circumstances change, Christina. Elizabeth needs support right now-surely you can understand that?"
Her fingers tightened around her bracelet. "Don't pretend this is about Elizabeth. I saw how you looked at Sean tonight. How he looked at you."
A laugh almost escaped me then-not because it was funny, but because it was so absurd.
Did she really think Sean had fallen in love with me? If Sean truly loved me, he wouldn't have asked for a divorce, let alone deny the existence of our child.
"I've kept my word," I said carefully. "I've kept my word-I haven't interfered with you and Sean."
Christina's eyes narrowed accusingly. "I saw your lipstick on Sean's mouth. Were you two kissing in the bathroom?"
"It's not what you think," I replied evenly. "I didn't initiate the kiss."
"Oh?" Christina's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Then how did your lipstick end up on his mouth?"
"Sean kissed me. He initiated it."
Christina stumbled slightly, her eyes widening in disbelief. "That's impossible! How could Sean possibly want to kiss you?"
I met her gaze steadily. "Whether you believe it or not, I've never broken our agreement. I've never made the first move with Sean."
I paused, then added pointedly, "Why don't you ask Sean about it? Why do you always come after me instead? Are you afraid to confront him?"
"You want to know something interesting, Christina?" I said, my voice soft but clear. "We could stand here all night, arguing about who has the right to what, who promised what to whom. Or we could accept that maybe, just maybe, the agreements we made before don't matter anymore."
She stilled, her eyes narrowing. "What are you saying?"
"I'm saying that perhaps it's time to stop playing games. Elizabeth's condition is serious-you know that. She needs stability right now, not drama."
For a moment, something like uncertainty flickered across her perfect features. Then, slowly, she nodded.
"You're right," she said, her voice softening. "I... I shouldn't have come at you like this. I'm just worried about Elizabeth too."
I handed her the pajamas, noting how her fingers trembled slightly as she took them. "I understand. We all want what's best for her."
Christina forced another one of her trademark fake smiles. "I didn't mean to argue with you just now. You know how it is-I just love Sean so much, I get a bit too anxious sometimes."
She reached out and grabbed my hand. "We're still good friends, aren't we?"
I fought back the wave of nausea that rose in my throat, forcing myself not to pull my hand away from her grip.
When we emerged from the closet, Sean was still there, leaning against the bedroom wall. His eyes tracked our movement, lingering on the pajamas in Christina's hands.
"I'll have Sarah bring up extra toiletries," he said, his voice clipped.
Christina smiled, but it didn't quite reach her eyes. "Thank you, Sean. Goodnight, Angela." She lingered in place, clearly expecting Sean to offer to walk her back to her room.
But Sean showed no intention of escorting her. Finally, she had no choice but to leave on her own, her eyes filled with a mix of hurt and resentment as she walked away.
The door closed behind her with a soft click, leaving Sean and me alone again. The tension from earlier crept back into the room, heavy and undefined.
Sean's gaze fell to my lips, where his kiss had erased my carefully applied makeup hours ago. Something darkened in his expression.
"What were you two talking about in the closet for so long?"
###chapter 49: The Smell That Betrayed Me
Angela POV
"What Christina and I talk about is none of your business," I said coldly. "Are you worried I'll bully your precious Christina?"
Sean's jaw tightened. "That's not what I meant at all. Why are you being so difficult?"
I didn't bother responding. Instead, I turned away and walked to the bathroom, closing the door behind me with quiet finality.
After a long shower, I changed into the most conservative pajama set I owned-long-sleeved, high-necked, perfect for maintaining distance.
I was too exhausted from my sleepless night to care when Sean came to bed. The moment my head hit the pillow, I was gone, barely registering the line of decorative pillows that created a barrier down the middle of our king-sized bed.
When I opened my eyes the next morning, Sean's side of the bed was already empty. I glanced at the clock on the bedside table-8:30 AM. I'd overslept.
I quickly dressed and made my way downstairs. The sound of laughter drifted up from the dining room-Christina's voice mixed with Elizabeth's warm chuckle.
When I entered, Christina was serving Elizabeth her morning tea, her auburn hair gleaming in the morning light.
"Good morning, Angela," Elizabeth's face lit up when she saw me. "Did you sleep well, dear?"
Before I could answer, Christina chimed in, "I was just telling Elizabeth about this wonderful new tea blend I brought back from Paris. It's supposed to be excellent for heart health."
I caught the slight narrowing of Sean's eyes as he watched the exchange from behind his newspaper. His gaze flickered to me, then back to his paper, but I could feel his attention lingering.
"That's thoughtful of you," I said, taking my seat. Sarah appeared silently at my elbow with a cup of hot milk, prepared exactly as I liked it.
"The chef has prepared something special this morning," Christina announced, her voice warm with practiced charm. "A recipe from a famous French restaurant. I mentioned to him that it's one of Elizabeth's favorites."
The rich aroma of the soup wafted across the table as the chef himself appeared, proudly presenting his creation. But as the scent reached me, my stomach lurched violently. The nausea I'd been fighting all morning rose up like a tidal wave.
I pushed back from the table abruptly, my chair scraping against the marble floor. "Excuse me," I managed to say, before hurrying toward the nearest bathroom.
I barely made it to the bathroom before the wave of nausea overwhelmed me. Bending over the sink, I tried to catch my breath. Suddenly, I felt large, warm hands gathering my hair back from my face.
Sean.
"Are you alright?" His voice was low, concerned.
I wanted to push him away, to tell him I didn't need his help. But another wave of nausea hit, and I could only grip the edge of the marble counter harder.
"Angela?" Elizabeth's worried voice called from the doorway. "Should we call a doctor?"
"No, I'm fine," I straightened up, forcing a smile. "Just a bit of a stomach bug, that's all."
"Nonsense," Sean's voice was firm. "We're going to the hospital to have you checked out."
"That's really not necessary," Christina appeared behind Elizabeth, her face a mask of concern. "It's probably just a touch of food poisoning. I'm sure with some rest-"
"I'm taking her to the hospital," Sean cut her off, his tone brooking no argument. His hand was still on my back, steady and warm.
I caught Christina's expression in the mirror-a flash of panic quickly hidden behind a sympathetic smile.
She knew what this could mean. If I went to the hospital, there was a chance they'd discover my pregnancy. Everything she'd worked for would unravel.
"Sean's right," Elizabeth said decisively. "Better to be safe than sorry. Christina, would you be a dear and ask Sarah to bring Angela's coat?"
I met Christina's eyes in the mirror. The message there was clear: she wouldn't let this happen without a fight.
But as Sean's hand tightened slightly on my back, I realized this might be beyond either of our control now.
"I'm fine, really," I tried one last time, but Sean was already shaking his head.
"No arguments," he said, his voice softening slightly. "Let me take care of you."
The tenderness in his tone made my heart twist. If only he knew what he was really trying to protect.
"I'll come with you," Christina hurried after us. "Actually, I have a friend who runs a private clinic nearby. She's really good, and there won't be any wait-"
"We're going to the hospital," Sean cut her off firmly. "A proper medical center will be more reliable."
Christina's smile faltered for just a moment before she caught herself. I could see the panic building behind her eyes.
Sean carried me to the car, then gently set me down. I could feel Sean's gaze flickering to me every few minutes.
"Are you hiding something from me?" Sean asked suddenly, his voice cutting through the tense silence. "Last month, Sarah found your medical report in the bathroom. You said it was nothing at the time, but you were lying, weren't you?"
"I didn't lie," I said quietly. "It really was just a routine annual checkup report."
"Then why were you so sick this morning?" He pressed, his tone heavy with suspicion.
"It was the lobster soup," I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. "The seafood might not have been fresh. The smell was quite strong."
Sean's eyes narrowed. "You used to love seafood."
Just as I struggled to find a response, Christina quickly came to my rescue. "The seafood soup was rather pungent today," she chimed in. "I had a sip and felt a bit queasy myself."
Sean looked unconvinced, but he dropped the subject. I caught Christina's eye in the rearview mirror, and we both let out a quiet sigh of relief.
"Get in the car," Sean said firmly.
"I'm feeling much better now," I protested. "There's no need to go to the hospital."
Sean shook his head, but I pressed on. "I haven't had breakfast yet, and I'm actually quite hungry now. Could we go back to eat first? If I still feel unwell later, Christina can accompany me to the hospital."
Christina nodded eagerly, stepping forward to support my arm. "I can look after Angela," she assured Sean. "You don't need to worry so much."
As I linked arms with Christina and started to turn back toward the house, Sean ran his fingers through his hair, a puzzled expression crossing his face.
"Since when did you two become so close?" he asked, his tone colored with curiosity.
###chapter 50: If You'll Be As Stubborn As Your Father
Angela POV
I forced myself to walk steadily as I made my way back to the dining room, with Christina hovering at my elbow.
Elizabeth's worried eyes met mine the moment I entered. "Are you alright, dear? You gave us quite a fright."
"I'm fine," I managed a reassuring smile as I settled back into my chair. The familiar scent of Elizabeth's morning tea wafted across the table, a comfort I desperately needed right now. "Just a bit of seafood sensitivity, that's all."
"I don't understand," Elizabeth's brows furrowed with concern. "I remember you used to love lobster. You never had any allergies before."
"People's tastes change," Christina interjected smoothly as she leaned forward to pour Elizabeth more tea. "I used to adore oysters, but now I can barely stand the smell."
Elizabeth nodded, but her sharp eyes didn't miss the way my fingers trembled slightly as I reached for my water glass.
"Perhaps we should still have you checked by a doctor," she suggested, her voice gentle but firm. "Better safe than sorry."
"That won't be necessary," I kept my voice steady, though my stomach was still churning. "I'm feeling much better already. Besides, we have that board meeting to prepare for this afternoon."
Sarah appeared silently at my side with a plate of plain toast and fresh fruit. My throat tightened at her thoughtfulness-she'd been with the family long enough to recognize the signs, even if others hadn't. Or perhaps she just knew me better than I thought.
"Thank you, Sarah," I murmured, catching the brief flash of understanding in her eyes.
I could feel Christina watching our exchange, her gaze calculating beneath her perfect smile. "The garden looks lovely this morning," she observed, changing the subject with practiced ease. "Elizabeth, you must tell me about those gorgeous hydrangeas I spotted earlier."
Elizabeth brightened visibly. "Oh, you should see them up close. They're a rare variety from Japan-"
"Why don't we take a short walk?" Christina suggested, rising gracefully. "The morning air would do us all good."
I followed them into the garden, hanging back a few steps to give myself space to breathe. The morning's events had left me drained, and maintaining my composure was becoming increasingly difficult.
"Mrs. Shaw?" Sarah's quiet voice came from beside me as she appeared with a shawl. "The morning air is a bit cool."
As she draped it around my shoulders, her voice dropped to barely a whisper. "That woman is clearly trying to take everything from you, Mrs. Shaw. And now she's acting like..." Sarah's voice trailed off meaningfully.
"I know," I cut her off gently, conscious of Christina's occasional backward glances. "Thank you, Sarah."
By noon, I had retreated to the study under the pretense of work. The room had become my sanctuary over the past two years, its quiet solitude offering refuge from the constant performance my life had become.
My laptop displayed Shaw Group's financial reports, but I couldn't focus. The morning's nausea had subsided, but in its place was a bone-deep exhaustion that seemed to seep into every part of me.
A soft knock announced Christina's presence. "I should head back," she said, closing the door behind her. "I've stayed longer than I planned, and we wouldn't want Elizabeth to start asking questions, would we?"
I met her gaze steadily. "No, we wouldn't."
"I'd like to come see Elizabeth again tomorrow," she continued, her voice taking on that familiar sweet tone. "Perhaps you could help arrange that?"
"Why do you need me to invite you?" I asked. "Can't you contact Elizabeth directly?"
Christina's lips curved into a small smile. "That would make me look too eager to please her, wouldn't it?"
I understood then - every move she made was carefully calculated. Even this simple request was part of her strategy.
"You know, Angela," she said, examining her nails with false casualness, "you really should be more careful. Morning sickness can be so... revealing."
My fingers curled into fists beneath my desk, but I kept my face impassive. "I appreciate your concern, but I can manage my own affairs."
"Can you?" Her eyebrows rose slightly.
"Because from where I stand, you're barely holding things together. One slip, one moment of weakness, and everything comes crashing down."
She paused, her voice softening with mock concern. "Think about Elizabeth. The stress of a scandal right now, with her health so fragile..."
"Was there anything else you needed, Christina?"
A knock at the door saved us from further conversation as Emily's face appeared on my laptop screen for our scheduled call.
The afternoon stretched on in a blur of meetings and reports. I threw myself into work, grateful for the distraction it provided. 
Once I was finally alone in the study, I gently placed my hand on my stomach. Though still flat, I could somehow sense the tiny life growing inside me. A soft smile spread across my face.
"You're being quite troublesome today, aren't you?" I whispered, my voice tender. "Making Mommy so dizzy in front of everyone." I traced small circles on my abdomen. "But it's okay. I'll protect you, no matter what."
 "I wonder if you'll be as stubborn as your father..." I paused, lost in thought.
 "Or maybe you'll be more like me? Either way, I'll love you more than anything in this world."
When I finally stood and turned to head to the bathroom, I froze. 
Sean was standing in the doorway, his expression unreadable, watching me.
###chapter 51: Did They All Know My Secret?
Angela POV
The moment I saw him, my mind went completely blank. 
How long had he been standing there? 
What had he heard?
"Who were you talking to?" His voice was carefully neutral, but I could hear the edge beneath it.
I avoided his question, asking instead, "Weren't you supposed to be at the office? Why are you still home?"
"Elizabeth was worried about your health," he replied, his eyes never leaving my face. "She insisted I stay back to keep an eye on you. The meetings have been switched to video calls." He paused for a moment, then pressed on, "You still haven't answered my question. Who were you talking to just now?"
I turned to face him, keeping my expression composed. "I was practicing for a presentation," I replied smoothly, moving toward my desk. "The quarterly numbers for the Morgan acquisition."
"Really?" Sean stepped into the study, closing the door behind him. "Because it sounded more like you were having a rather intimate conversation."
"You must have misheard." I kept my voice light as I sorted through the papers on my desk, giving my hands something to do. "I've been reviewing these reports all morning."
His eyes narrowed. "Do you really think I'm that easy to fool?" He took a step closer, his voice dropping. "I heard you say 'baby'."
My heart was pounding so hard I could barely breathe.
"Why are you so nervous?" Sean's voice grew colder. "Is there something you're hiding? Is that 'baby' Nathan?"
Hearing his suspicion about Nathan, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. So he hadn't heard clearly what I'd said earlier. He had no idea about the child I was carrying.
I couldn't help but let out a short, surprised laugh. "Is that what this is about? Nathan is helping me understand the technical aspects of the Morgan deal. You know how complex these leveraged buyouts can be."
"And for your information," I added, keeping my voice casual, "I was calling Emily 'baby'. She's been doing an excellent job lately, and I'm thinking of giving her a raise."
"There are other analysts who could help you with that."
"None as qualified as Nathan," I countered. "He has the most experience with this type of acquisition."
"I don't like how much time you're spending with him."
"And I don't like how much time you spend with Christina," I shot back before I could stop myself. "At least I haven't invited Nathan to stay overnight in our home, wearing your pajamas!"
I could feel the tension thickening in the room. Sean took a step forward, his hands gripping the edge of my desk. "Are you blaming me? I wasn't the one who invited Christina over last night," he said defensively. "Besides, you didn't seem to object when she borrowed your sleepwear, did you?"
I said sarcastically, "Who could resist angel Christina?"
Sean stood there, trying to find words to argue back, but ultimately remained silent. Taking advantage of his hesitation, I grabbed my laptop, pushed past him, and walked out of the study.
"We're not finished discussing this."
"Yes, we are." I walked past him toward the door, then paused. "By the way, Christina left her scarf in the guest room last night. You might want to have Sarah return it to her."
I headed straight for the kitchen, hoping to find something to settle my churning stomach. The morning sickness was getting harder to hide.
I found Chef David busy preparing lunch when I entered the kitchen. He looked up as I came in, and I saw the concern flash across his face before he masked it with a warm smile.
"Mrs. Shaw," he greeted me, "I just finished a batch of macarons. Would you like to try one? They're your favorite - vanilla bean."
My stomach, which had been threatening to revolt moments ago, suddenly perked up at the mention of sweets. "Thank you, David. That would be lovely."
Sarah appeared with a glass of mint tea just as I settled at the kitchen island.
 "This should help with the nausea, Mrs. Shaw," she said quietly, her eyes knowing but discrete.
I took a grateful sip, touched by their silent understanding.
When we sat down for lunch, Elizabeth glanced at me, her expression soft with concern. "Feeling any better?" she asked.
I smiled and nodded. "I'm fine now. My appetite's back."
But as soon as Sean sat down at the table, I noticed his brow furrow. He called David over and asked, "Why does the food look so different today?"
It was only then that I really took in the spread on the table. It was unusually light-no spicy dishes, no fried food, just simple, delicate options.
David, ever the smooth talker, explained with a knowing look, "I selected these dishes specifically for Mrs. Shaw and Elizabeth."
His gaze lingered on me for just a moment too long, and I couldn't help but feel uneasy. The dishes in front of me looked strikingly similar to those pregnancy-friendly meals I'd seen online.
Had Sarah and David already figured it out? Sarah, with all her experience as a nanny, must have a sixth sense when it came to things like this. But how could they possibly know?
I quickly glanced down at my plate, trying to keep my face neutral. David's eyes met mine again, and I could see he wasn't fooled. He knew.
###chapter 52 She Won’t Wear Your Clothes Anymore
Angela POV
I quickly turned to David, wanting to divert Sean and Elizabeth's attention. "You're so considerate," I said with a smile. "Elizabeth can't handle greasy or spicy food right now, so we should keep meals like this from now on."
Then, glancing at Sean, I added, "If it's not to your taste, David can always make something just for you."
Sean shook his head, dismissing the idea. "I'm not picky. I just worry about you."
Elizabeth beamed at us. "It's so nice to see how much you care for each other. "
As lunch came to an end, David brought out a chilled fruit cake. Elizabeth, looking a little tired, excused herself to rest in her room.
I didn't hesitate. I ate two slices, then finished the one Elizabeth hadn't touched.
Sean raised an eyebrow, eyeing me. "Are you sure you're not eating too much?"
I grinned, teasing him. "What's the problem? Don't you like curvier girls? A little extra weight wouldn't hurt, right?"
He looked surprised, but there was something almost defensive in his response. I remembered two weeks ago when Christina had said I was too thin, implying Sean preferred women with more curves. It made me realize that for all his serious demeanor, Sean was just another guy with typical tastes.
To my surprise, Sean snapped back, "Who said I like curvier girls?"
I raised an eyebrow and made a playful gesture with my hands, forming an exaggerated "S" shape. "Come on. You don't have to hide it. Christina's big ass-you can't tell me that's not your type."
Sean's face turned red, his jaw tightening. "You don't understand anything," he muttered before standing up and walking away.
I watched him leave, a small, satisfied smile on my face. Another close call-my secret was still safe. I let out a quiet breath of relief.
***
The next morning at breakfast, I remembered I'd promised Christina I'd invite her over to meet Elizabeth. I suggested calling her and asking her to come by.
Sean, who had been casually sipping his coffee, looked up in surprise when he heard me mention Christina. "Why do you want her here?"
I shrugged, trying to keep things light. "She gets along so well with Grandma. She really knows how to make her laugh. I thought it'd be nice to have her over for a bit."
Sean's lips pressed into a thin line, and his voice was colder than usual. "So, you just call her, and she shows up? Doesn't she have her own things to do?"
I didn't expect him to react like this. Wasn't he happy to see Christina? I was just trying to help her bond with Elizabeth before they got married. Why was he stopping me?
Was he worried I was trying to make things awkward for Christina?
Before I could say anything, Elizabeth, who'd overheard us, smiled. "It's okay, Angela. Sean's right. Christina already spent a lot of time with me yesterday. I don't want to take up more of her time today."
I thought about it for a moment. Well, I'd already promised Christina. If Sean didn't want her over, then that wasn't on me.
I gave Sean a quick glance, then nodded at Grandma. "Alright, I won't call her."
Elizabeth smiled and didn't press further. But there was something about the way Sean's mood had shifted that made me uneasy. From the moment I mentioned Christina, his energy had become sharp, tense. It lingered, even as breakfast ended.
After Elizabeth suggested going for a walk downstairs with Sarah, and once she had left, Sean suddenly turned to me.
"Come to the study. We need to talk."
I kept my tone even. "I think we've already covered everything yesterday. What's left to say?"
Sean's dark eyes locked onto mine, calm but intense.
"Are you walking, or am I carrying you?"
I blinked, confused. "What?"
"Three seconds to decide."
"Wait, you-"
"One."
I stared at him, bewildered. Was he really being this childish?
"Two."
Before I could react, Sean took a step forward, effortlessly lifting me into his arms.
I gasped, thrown off balance by his sudden move, my head spinning as I tried to catch up.
Didn't he say three seconds? He barely made it to two!
When we reached the study, he still didn't put me down.
"Put me down," I said, pounding his chest lightly.
He didn't even react, only looked down at me with those calm, ocean-like eyes.
"I'll make sure Christina won't show up in front of you," he said quietly.
I raised an eyebrow, confused. "What do you mean?"
He held me tighter, his voice low. "From now on, Christina won't come to the office. She won't come here. She won't wear your clothes."
A chill ran through me at his words. What was he saying? Why was he so determined to cut Christina out completely? What was really going on in his mind?
###chapter 53 You Can’t Call Him Anymore—Ever
Angela POV
"Why?"
I kept my voice steady, but Sean's intense gaze sent a shiver down my spine. There was something different about him-something unreadable and unsettling.
"You can't call Nathan anymore," he said suddenly.
I blinked. "What?"
"And don't call him 'baby' again. In fact, you can't call any man 'baby' ，ever again." he added, his jaw tightening. "I know you weren't talking to Emily last night. I asked her. It was Nathan, wasn't it?"
I froze for half a second, unsure how to respond.
Should I even bother explaining? Maybe it was better to let him misunderstand than risk him learning the truth.
After a pause, I shrugged. "You're overthinking things. Nathan and I are just friends. And no, I won't stop talking to him-he's my colleague. That's not how the world works."
Then, as if this conversation were nothing more than an inconvenience, I patted his shoulder lightly. "Now, put me down."
Instead of letting go, Sean tightened his hold. His eyes, dark and piercing, locked onto mine.
"If you don't agree, I won't let go," he said, his voice low and firm.
I let out a breath. "Can't we have this conversation like normal adults? Do you really think this is appropriate?"
His lips curled slightly, but there was no amusement in his expression. "It's perfectly appropriate."
Then he added, "Angela, do you even remember that you're a married woman?"
I arched a brow, scoffing. "Have you forgotten? This marriage isn't real."
His arms stiffened around me. For a moment, something flickered in his eyes-something unspoken.
Then, without another word, he finally let me go.
As I stepped away, I chuckled softly, but there was no real humor in it.
So he had remembered. His little display had just been his pride talking.
I straightened my clothes and left the room without looking back.
By the time I headed to work, one thing was certain-I was driving myself. No way was I getting in a car with him today.
***
The workload had piled up over the past few days while I was busy taking care of Elizabeth. The moment I stepped into the office, Emily handed me a thick stack of reports.
By the time afternoon rolled around, my stomach growled in protest, reminding me that I hadn't eaten.
"Sorry, little one," I murmured, instinctively placing a hand on my stomach before grabbing my coat and heading out for lunch.
At a nearby sandwich shop, I joined the queue, my mind still occupied with work. But a strange sensation crept over me-an unsettling chill, as if someone were watching me.
I turned my head slightly and caught sight of a sleek black sports car parked across the street. Its windows were tinted, making it impossible to see inside.
Was it just my imagination?
"Ma'am, your bacon sandwich is ready."
The server's voice snapped me back to reality. I quickly took the bag, pushing aside the strange feeling, and headed back to the office.
But as I walked, that same black car seemed to follow at a steady distance. It didn't speed up, didn't honk-just stayed there, lingering. Then, at the next intersection, it suddenly turned and disappeared.
I shook my head. Maybe I'm just being paranoid pregnancy hormones messing with me.
Later That Evening
Emily was a nervous wreck. She had a big business dinner tonight, and her anxious pacing in the office was making me restless.
"Relax," I said, closing my laptop. "I'll go with you."
Her eyes lit up with relief.
Just as I was about to leave, my phone buzzed-Sean.
Sean: After work, we'll go home together.
Me: I can't. I'm going with Emily to a business dinner.
Almost immediately, my phone rang.
"Emily is your subordinate. Why do you need to go to her business dinner?" His voice was calm, but there was an edge to it.
"I need to train my successor, Sean. Someone has to take over when I leave, right?"
Silence.
I didn't wait for a response before ending the call.
At the Dinner Venue
When we arrived, I frowned.
"A bar? Seriously?"
Emily winced. "The client picked it."
I exhaled sharply. "Bars are too noisy and full of distractions. Did you even try to suggest another location?"
Emily's face turned red. "I I didn't think I could."
"Next time, you pick the place. Never let the client dictate something inappropriate."
She nodded quickly, looking ashamed.
I sighed. "Well, we're here now. Let's just get it over with."
As we stepped inside, I felt an immediate wave of nausea. The air was thick with cigarette smoke, strong alcohol, and the clashing scents of cheap cologne and expensive perfume.
I took a step back, pressing a hand over my nose and mouth.
"Angela, you actually came?"
A familiar, smug voice rang out.
I glanced up to see him-Luca, the notorious playboy son of a corporate giant. He lounged on the couch, a sultry dancer draped over his arm, his lips curved in amusement.
"Didn't think you'd show up to a place like this," he said, twirling a glass of whiskey in his hand before taking a slow sip.
Ignoring him, I turned to Emily. "Let's find the client and wrap this up."
But Luca leaned forward, snapping his fingers at his entourage. "Make room for Angela."
His friends scrambled to clear a seat, but I didn't move.
"Luca," I said coolly. "Can we talk somewhere else?"
His brows lifted. "Why? I spent a fortune reserving this VIP suite."
"The smoke is too heavy. I don't do business in places like this."
The room fell silent.
The surprise on his face quickly morphed into amusement. He leaned back, studying me with interest. "You really are as tough as they say."
I crossed my arms. "Are we moving, or not?"
###chapter 54: You’re No Better Than These Hookers！
Angela POV
Luca's smirk deepened as he watched me, lounging back into the plush leather of the VIP suite.
His eyes held that familiar entitled gleam I'd seen too many times in men who confused wealth with worth.
"Come now, Angela," he drawled, gesturing to one of his friends to pour more champagne. "Why so serious? We're all friends here."
I kept my stance firm, one hand protectively near Emily. 
"I've made myself clear, Luca. This isn't an appropriate venue for business discussions."
One of Luca's friends-a tall man with slicked-back hair and an expensive but tasteless suit-sidled closer to Emily.
"Hey beautiful, how about a drink?" He held out a glass of champagne, his smile predatory. "A pretty thing like you shouldn't just stand there all stiff."
Emily shifted uncomfortably, pressing closer to me. "No, thank you," she said firmly, but I could hear the tremor in her voice.
"Leave her alone," I snapped, my patience wearing thin. "She's here in a professional capacity."
Another of Luca's entourage laughed, the sound crude and mocking. 
"Professional? Come on, sweetheart. We all know why pretty girls like you two really come to places like this."
Luca raised his hand, silencing his friends with a lazy gesture. He stood, walking toward me with exaggerated casualness.
"You know, Angela, I've been hearing interesting things about you and Sean." His voice dropped lower, meant for my ears alone. "Word is, he's getting ready to throw you aside. Christina's quite the upgrade, isn't she?"
I felt my jaw tighten but kept my expression neutral. "My marriage is none of your concern."
He chuckled, taking another step closer. "Why keep playing the loyal wife? Everyone knows you're just hanging on by a thread. When Sean dumps you, what will you have left? A failed family name? A bankrupted legacy?" His eyes raked over me appreciatively. "But you could do better. Someone like me could give you everything you need."
Luca's lips curled into a sneer. "Stop acting so high and mighty, Angela. Everyone knows you only married Sean for his money. How are you any different from these hookers?" He gestured dismissively at the women in the room. "At least they're honest about what they're selling."
My eyes flashed dangerously. "And that's exactly why you'll always be nothing but a trust fund playboy who's never earned a dollar on his own," I shot back, my voice dripping with disdain. 
"Tell me, Luca, besides spending daddy's money, what exactly can you do?"
"Watch your mouth, Angela. You're not in a position to-"
"To what?" I cut in, my voice ice-cold. "To point out that you're nothing but a parasite? Unlike you, I can actually earn my own living. Take away your father's connections, and what are you? Just another mediocre man with an inflated ego."
Rage flashed across his features. Before I could step back, he grabbed my arm, yanking me closer. 
"You think Sean will protect you? He doesn't give a damn about you anymore. I could take you right here, and he wouldn't lift a finger."
He laughed, harsh and ugly. "What are you going to do? Tell Sean? Go ahead. Everyone knows he's too busy with Christina to care about his soon-to-be ex-wife."
Luca leaned in closer. "Why don't you become my mistress instead?" His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "I can make sure you maintain this luxurious lifestyle after your divorce. Remember that island party five years ago? I liked you from the moment I saw you."
The memory suddenly flooded back-that resort party where I'd first encountered Luca. We'd had a heated argument that night.
I remembered it clearly now: he'd made crude comments about my dress, suggesting I was trying to seduce men with my "provocative" outfit. He'd propositioned me for a one-night stand, treating me like some easy conquest.
I felt bile rise in my throat as his face loomed closer, alcohol heavy on his breath. I tried to pull away, but his grip tightened painfully.
"Let go of me," I warned, "or you'll regret it."
"Angela!" Emily's voice suddenly cut through the tension. She rushed forward, trying to pull Luca's arm away from me. "Stop it! Let her go!"
Two of Luca's friends pounced on Emily, their hands rough and greedy. One pinned her slender neck in a bruising grip, his fingers digging into her soft skin, while the other shoved his hand under her blouse, groping her curves with shameless hunger.
"Look at this tasty little treat," one of them growled, yanking her closer, his voice dripping with lust. "Such a loyal assistant, huh? Time to show this sweet thing what happens when good girls step out of line." He pressed himself against her, his bulge obvious through his pants.
"Now, now," the other purred, his hot breath tickling her ear as he dragged his tongue slowly up her cheek, leaving a wet trail across her flushed face. "Don't scare her too much. She's just a pretty little pet trying to please her boss-let's break her in nice and slow."
"Stop!" I struggled harder against Luca's grip, watching helplessly as tears welled up in Emily's eyes. "Leave her alone!"
Luca just laughed, clearly enjoying the scene. "See what happens when you try to act above your station? Now your precious assistant has to suffer the consequences."
Just as one of the men started to force a glass of champagne to Emily's lips, the door burst open with a thunderous crash. 
A massive figure filled the doorway-broad-shouldered and intimidating, like a Marine stepped straight out of a recruitment poster.
In the dim light, I could barely make out his features, but his presence commanded immediate attention.
Everything happened in a blur after that. Luca was suddenly on the ground, clutching his jaw. His friends scattered like cockroaches, a few trying to fight back only to be efficiently dispatched by the newcomer's precise, powerful movements.
"Mrs. Shaw," the man's deep voice cut through the chaos, "please come with me. Your car is waiting."
He moved with military precision, creating a safe path through the now-chaos of the VIP room. I grabbed Emily's hand, pulling her along as we followed our unexpected rescuer.
"Are you alright?" I asked Emily as we hurried toward the exit, my heart still racing.
She nodded, though her face was pale. "Yes, thanks to you. And... whoever that is."
As we reached the corridor, I turned to our mysterious savior. "Who are you?"
The man remained silent, his expression unreadable beneath the dim lights. Finally, he spoke, his voice deep and professional. "My employer sent me to assist you, Mrs. Shaw. He would like to meet with you."
More security personnel emerged from the shadows, surrounding us in a protective formation. Despite their intimidating presence, I felt oddly calm. These men had just saved us from Luca-surely I could trust them.
I nodded slowly. "Alright, take me to your employer."
But as Emily and I started to move forward together, the large man held out his arm, blocking Emily's path. "I apologize, Miss Miller, but my employer wishes to speak with Mrs. Shaw alone."
Emily's eyes widened with concern. "But Angela-"
"It's okay, Emily," I reassured her, though uncertainty flickered through me. "Have someone from the office pick you up. I'll be fine."
###chapter 55: A Friend I Never Forgot
Angela POV
The burly man who had rescued me from Luca led me to a hotel called Sapphire, its elegant facade rising high into the night sky.
The security detail maintained their professional distance as we ascended toward the top floor, their presence both reassuring and somewhat unnerving.
My phone buzzed with another message from Emily:
Angela, are you sure you're okay? I've contacted Sean. He's on his way.
Emily meant well, but she didn't understand. After this morning's argument with Sean, the last thing I needed was another confrontation. His controlling behavior, the way he tried to dictate who I could talk to-it was suffocating. Let him worry for a change. I slipped my phone back into my purse without responding.
The elevator chimed softly as we reached the penthouse level. The security team led me through a corridor adorned with elegant sconces and original artwork, their footsteps muffled by the plush carpeting.
Everything about this floor screamed old money and refined taste-a far cry from Luca's gaudy attempt at luxury in the club below.
"Please make yourself comfortable, Mrs. Shaw," one of the security team members said, gesturing to a plush armchair. "My employer will join you shortly."
I settled into the chair, trying to ignore the growing unease in my stomach.
Something about this felt too deliberate, too carefully orchestrated.
A server appeared almost immediately, presenting a silver tray laden with fresh berries, chocolate-dipped strawberries, and delicate macarons in my favorite flavors.
My eyes narrowed slightly. These weren't just random refreshments-they were all things I particularly enjoyed. Even the arrangement mimicked how I preferred my desserts presented at home.
The coincidence was too perfect to be chance.
The baby seemed to share my apprehension, a slight flutter of movement making me place a protective hand over my stomach.
Stay calm, little one, I thought. We'll figure this out together.
My phone buzzed again. This time it was a message from Sean:
Sean：Where are you?
I stared at the screen, debating whether to respond. Before I could decide, another message appeared:
Sean：Angela, answer me. NOW.
The imperious tone made me want to throw the phone across the room. Instead, I typed out a quick reply:
Angela：I'm fine. Don't bother coming.
His response was immediate:
Sean：Too late. I'm already on my way.
I was about to fire back a sharp retort when I heard footsteps approaching. They were measured, unhurried-the confident stride of someone who knew exactly what kind of impression they wanted to make. I turned toward the sound, and my heart nearly stopped.
"Hello, Little Angel."
Besides my father, only one person in the world ever called me that. I should have known it was him!
Now，Christopher stood in the doorway - tall and lean, with neatly styled golden-brown hair.
His mixed Italian-British heritage was evident in his features: high cheekbones, light amber eyes, and a natural tan that spoke of his Mediterranean background. He looks much more mature and tougher than before, but compared to Sean, he has a softer vibe.
Christopher?" I exclaimed, my mouth dropping open in surprise.
"You remember me. I'm flattered."He smiled, that same devastating smile that had turned heads at every Ivy League social event years ago.
Of course I remembered. Christopher Blake, Sean's closest friend from college, had always been there in the background. He never missed a chance to remind me of my place.
Once, when I was planning Sean's birthday gift, he'd said with that knowing smile, "Sean gave Christina a sapphire necklace for her birthday this year. What did he give you? Oh right... nothing."
"What's on your mind?" Christopher crossed the room and stood beside me, pulling me out of my thoughts.
His eyes were locked on mine.
"You're even more beautiful than I remember, Angela," His brow furrowed slightly as he studied me. "but too thin. Much too thin. Sean hasn't been taking proper care of you, has he?"
I forced a polite smile, trying to maintain my composure. "I can take care of myself, Christopher. I always have."
His gaze dropped to my left hand, where my wedding ring caught the light.
"Yes, I suppose you have." He reached up, absently touching the tie clip I'd given him years ago-an exquisite piece of Italian craftsmanship that I'd chosen as a graduation gift. "Though some of us might wish you didn't have to."
I never expected he'd still have this tie clip. It's been five years since we last saw each other, and suddenly, all these memories came flooding back, leaving me with a warm feeling inside.
Before I could respond, he closed the distance between us in two smooth strides and pulled me into an embrace.
"I've missed you, Little Angel," he murmured against my hair. "Five years is far too long."
"Me too!"
This hug is exactly what I need right now-a genuine, comforting embrace from an old friend. It helped ease the insults and pressure I've been dealing with tonight.
But a sound of rushing footsteps interrupted me.
I turned my head just in time to see Sean burst through the doorway, his usually impeccable appearance slightly disheveled. His T-shirt was wrinkled, his tie loosened-clear signs he'd rushed here straight from the office.
He froze in the doorway, taking in the scene before him.
His eyes locked onto Christopher's arms around me, and something dark and dangerous flickered across his face.
###chapter 56: Who’s Protecting Her Now?
Sean POV
Emily's message flashed across my phone screen: "Angela's in trouble. Some men tried to... Please hurry!"
My blood ran cold. The quarterly reports scattered across my desk, the conference call droning in my earpiece-none of it mattered. I ripped off my headset and grabbed my coat, already calling for the elevator.
"Cancel everything," I barked at Michael as I strode past his desk. "Have security track Angela's phone. Now."
The drive to the Sapphire Hotel was a blur of red lights and honking horns. 
Every second felt like an eternity. 
I kept seeing Angela's face, imagining what could have happened, what might be happening right now. Just imagining it made my hands grip the steering wheel harder.
When I finally reached the penthouse floor, my tie was loose, my suit wrinkled-a far cry from my usual polished appearance. But I couldn't have cared less about how I looked. 
All that mattered was finding her.
The sight that greeted me as I burst through the door stopped me dead in my tracks.
There she was-my wife-wrapped in another man's embrace. The stranger's back was to me, but I'd know that lean frame anywhere. 
Nathan Harrison. 
The ambitious young analyst who'd been hovering around Angela for months. The same one I'd caught her calling "baby" just days ago.
Something primal roared to life inside me. "Angela," I snapped, my voice cutting through the quiet like a blade. "Come here. Now."
She turned her head, surprise flickering across her features, but made no move to leave his arms. If anything, his grip on her seemed to tighten. 
I crossed the room in three long strides. Before I could even see his face clearly, my fist had already connected with his jaw. The impact sent him stumbling backward.
Then he turned around, and my blood ran cold.
"Christopher?"
Despite the punch, that familiar smile-the same one that had charmed us out of countless scrapes during our college years-spread across my old friend's face as he rubbed his jaw. 
"Hello, Sean. Still leading with your fist, I see. Some things never change."
My mind reeled. 
Christopher Blake-my best friend from Andover, my roommate at Yale, the man who'd stood beside me through every major milestone of my adult life-was holding my wife.
"When did you..." 
The words died in my throat as Christopher finally released Angela, stepping forward to clasp my shoulder warmly.
"Just got in from London this afternoon," he explained, his British accent slightly more pronounced after his years in the City. "Imagine my surprise when I heard about the trouble at Luca's club. I couldn't very well leave your wife in that situation, could I?"
My attention snapped back to Angela, who had moved to stand by the window, her arms crossed defensively. 
"Luca?" The name came out like a growl. "What happened with Luca?"
"Nothing I couldn't handle," she replied coolly, but I noticed her unconsciously rubbing her arm. Angry red marks were beginning to form on her pale skin.
The sight of those marks made my vision blur with rage. "What did he do to you?"
"It's been dealt with," Christopher cut in smoothly. "My security team made sure Luca and his friends won't be bothering anyone for a while." He gestured to the spread of refreshments on the coffee table. "Why don't we sit down? We have a lot to catch up on."
But I couldn't take my eyes off Angela. She was trying to hide it, but I could see the slight tremor in her hands, the way her shoulders were held just a fraction too straight. 
"Tomorrow," I said firmly. "We'll catch up tomorrow. Right now, I'm taking my wife home."
A flash of something-concern? disappointment?-crossed Christopher's face, but he nodded. "Of course. Dinner tomorrow then? The usual place?"
"I'll have my assistant set it up," I replied, already moving toward Angela. I placed my hand at the small of her back, guiding her toward the door. She stiffened at my touch but didn't pull away.
The moment we stepped into the elevator, however, she shrugged off my hand. "Emily," she said, her voice tight with worry. "Is she okay? Where is she?"
"I told her to take a cab home," I answered, studying her reflection in the mirrored walls. "She should be fine."
Her laugh was bitter, cutting. "Fine? You let her go home alone after what happened?"
"She's a grown woman, Angela. She can handle-"
"Handle what?" She turned to face me, her eyes blazing. "Do you have any idea what it's like for a woman to go home alone after being assaulted? Do you think the fear just disappears because she's in a cab? Because she's reached her front door? God, Sean, how can you be so blind?"
Frustration surged through me. "No one would dare touch my employee-"
"You really think you're invincible, don't you?" Her words dripped with sarcasm. "The great Sean Shaw, who can protect everyone and everything. Well, if you were half as powerful as you think you are, Emily and I wouldn't have been attacked tonight. Some protector you turned out to be."
"I'll protect you," I said quietly as we reached the car. "Both of you. No one will dare-"
"Protect me?" Her laugh was sharp enough to cut. "With what? My status as your soon-to-be-ex-wife? That's working out really well so far, isn't it?"
The words hit me like a physical blow. 
"Angela-"
"Everyone knows I'm just your temporary wife, Sean. This identity you gave me-it doesn't protect me from anything. It just makes me a target."
She wrapped her arms around herself, suddenly looking very young and very tired. "How long do you think you can keep playing at being my protector? Until Christina becomes the new Mrs. Shaw? Until the divorce papers are signed?"
I reached for her, but she turned away, leaning against the car window. Her silence cut deeper than any words could have.
###chapter 57: Your Promises Don't Mean Much anymore
Sean POV
I drove in silence, my mind still churning with the scene at the hotel. 
Christopher's unexpected return, his arms around Angela, her tear-stained face - everything blurred together into a poisonous mix of anger and something else I couldn't quite name.
Angela sat beside me, her eyes fixed on the passing city lights. The silence stretched between us until she finally broke it.
"These past two years at Shaw Group, I've worked so hard trying to prove myself," she said, her voice carrying an edge I hadn't heard before. "I thought if I showed everyone my professional worth, they'd see past the 'Mrs. Shaw' title."
She turned to look at me directly. "But tonight made one thing crystal clear - without the Shaw family's protection, I'm nothing in this world. After all, I'm about to become the former Mrs. Shaw, aren't I?"
My grip tightened on the steering wheel, but I couldn't find the words to respond. Emily's earlier phone call kept replaying in my head:
"Everyone knows Shaw's president has already brought his new woman into the company. She'll be tossed aside soon enough, become the laughingstock of high society. The Wilsons are bankrupt - nobody will protect her anymore."
Luca's words, delivered through Emily's trembling voice, made my blood boil all over again.
The thought of him and his friends threatening Angela, treating her like some disposable trophy wife - it took every ounce of my self-control not to turn the car around and deal with him personally.
We pulled into the underground parking garage of our apartment. The engine's quiet purr died away, leaving us in a charged silence. When Angela reached for her seatbelt, I leaned over, my fingers brushing against hers as I moved to help her.
She drew back sharply, pressing herself against the car door as if my touch had burned her. The subtle movement sent a jolt of something - irritation? hurt? - through my chest.
"What are you afraid of?" I tried to keep my tone light, teasing. "Think I'm going to kiss you?"
Angela remained perfectly still, her face turned away, refusing to acknowledge either my attempt at humor or my presence. The silence stretched painfully.
I caught the lingering scent of champagne on her clothes, mixed with that familiar jasmine perfume she always wore. The combination made my head spin slightly.
"Grandma is waiting up," I finally said, breaking the tension. "But you should change first. The champagne smell is too strong."
Angela gave a slight nod, still not meeting my eyes. 
Without another word, she slipped out of the car. I watched her retreating figure, wondering when exactly we'd become such strangers to each other.
As soon as she disappeared into the elevator, I pulled out my phone.
"Michael," I barked into the device, not caring about the late hour. "I need everything you can find on Luca's family enterprises. Every weakness, every vulnerability - especially their recent acquisitions."
Michael's pause told me he understood this wasn't just business as usual. "Right away, sir. And... the timeline?"
"Tomorrow." I ended the call and headed upstairs.
Luca was a dead man now, I swore to myself.
***
In Grandma's suite, Angela sat with her hand clasped in Grandma's grip while I stood by the window, watching their reflection in the glass.
"Angela, dear, are you alright?" Grandma asked, concern evident in her voice. "Sean told me you ran into some trouble?"
Angela's face transformed instantly, her previous distress completely hidden behind a warm smile. "I'm fine, Grandma. Please don't worry."
It was remarkable how different she looked now compared to just moments ago in the car. She'd mastered the art of wearing masks, I realized, and I wasn't sure how I felt about that.
"That boy," Grandma said softly to Angela, her eyes flickering to me, "when he heard you were in trouble, he ran out without even grabbing his coat. In this weather, of all things."
I busied myself with my tie, uncomfortable with the knowing look in Grandma's eyes. She'd always been too perceptive for her own good.
"Sean, darling," she continued, her tone taking on a familiar edge that made me tense. "I understand business requires certain... social obligations. Christina is a lovely girl, but you need to maintain appropriate boundaries with all women." She paused meaningfully.
"Especially now."
My hands froze on my tie, a cold sweat breaking out across my neck. Those words - "especially now" - echoed in my head like an accusation.
 The weight of Grandma's gaze felt unbearable. How much did she know? About Christina?
 About the whispers in the company?
About my own confused feelings that I couldn't even sort out myself?
I caught Angela watching me from beneath her lashes, her expression unreadable but somehow knowing. The slight curve of her lips held a hint of mockery that made my chest tighten with an emotion I couldn't name.
Here I was, the mighty CEO of Shaw Group, reduced to a guilty schoolboy under the combined scrutiny of these two women.
"Christina and I are just friends," I explained to Grandma, hating how defensive my voice sounded.
The words felt hollow even as I spoke them, especially with Angela's quiet presence beside me serving as a silent reminder of all my recent choices and their consequences.
Then I caught the sarcasm in Angela's eyes.
After leaving Grandma's room, I called out to Angela.
"Angela..."
She turned, her expression carefully blank. "What about it?"
"Luca will never touch you again. I promise you that."
Her laugh was sharp and bitter. "Your promises don't mean much anymore, Sean." She gestured between us. "This arrangement we have? It's temporary, remember? Soon enough, I won't be your responsibility anymore."
Something inside me snapped.
"You're my wife," I muttered under my breath.
###chapter 58: That Damn Speakerphone Spill
Angela POV
I closed the bedroom door behind me as quietly as possible. 
Sean sat in the leather armchair by the window, dressed in just a white T-shirt and dark loungewear pants.
His usually perfect appearance was nowhere to be seen-his hair slightly disheveled, as if he'd been running his fingers through it repeatedly.
Elizabeth's words from earlier echoed in my mind: "That boy... when he heard you were in trouble, he ran out without even grabbing his coat." 
I found my eyes drawn to his broad shoulders, noting how the thin cotton material of his T-shirt did little to hide his tensed muscles. 
The thought of him rushing out into the cold night, focused only on reaching me, stirred something deep within my chest.
For a moment, I nearly broke the heavy silence between us.But pride held my tongue. 
What would I say? 
Thank you for coming to my rescue? 
I'm sorry for worrying you? 
None of it felt right, not when our marriage was nothing but a convenient arrangement with an expiration date.
As I moved toward the walk-in closet, my phone buzzed with a message. Christopher's name appeared on the screen:
 "Save my new number, Little Angel."
My fingers hovered over the keyboard before I replied: "I'm not that little girl anymore, Christopher."
His response came quickly: "What should I call you then?"
"Just Angela is fine."
"Alright then, Angel it is."
I stared at the last message, a slight frown creasing my brow. 
Angel-the name Sean used in his most tender moments with me, when his guard was down and his voice would soften with affection. 
Hearing it from Christopher felt wrong somehow, like he was unknowingly intruding on something private, something that belonged only to Sean and me.
Sean's voice cut through my thoughts. "You should get some rest." His tone was carefully neutral, betraying nothing of what he might be thinking.
I nodded slightly, not trusting myself to speak. I gathered my nightclothes and headed to the bathroom, grateful for the excuse to escape the charged atmosphere of the bedroom.
By the time I emerged, freshly showered and wearing silk pajamas, Sean had disappeared.
***
Morning light filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows when I awoke.
Sean's side of the bed remained untouched, the pillows still perfectly arranged. 
I found myself reaching out, my hand hovering over the cold sheets where he should have been.
After dressing in a cream-colored Chanel suit, I made my way toward the home office. 
The door was ajar, and I caught sight of Sean inside, his tall frame bent over his laptop. He'd changed into a fresh shirt and suit pants, but the subtle shadows under his eyes suggested he'd spent the night there.
He looked up as I passed, our eyes meeting briefly. 
"Good morning," he said, his voice cold. "Christopher's hosting a gathering at his house tonight. We should make an appearance."
My grip tightened slightly on my leather portfolio. "Both of us?"
"Unless you'd prefer to give the gossips more fuel?" His tone was light, but there was an edge to it. "They're already having a field day with last night's events."
I thought back to our prep school days, when our arguments would follow this same pattern. Sean would always be the first to extend an olive branch, even while maintaining that stern expression of his. 
Some things, it seemed, never changed.
"What time?" I asked, relenting.
"I'll have Peter pick you up at seven."
I nodded, turning to leave, but his voice stopped me. "Angela." I paused, not turning around. "Be careful today."
His sudden show of concern caught me off guard, sending an unexpected warmth through my chest.
The executive floor of Shaw Tower hummed with its usual morning activity as I settled into my office. 
Sophie's call came through just as I finished reviewing the quarterly reports. I put it on speaker, confident in the privacy of my corner office.
"How's the divorce coming along?" Sophie's voice filled the room.
I sighed, massaging my temples. "It's... complicated."
A knock at the door interrupted our conversation. 
Emily stepped in, her expression hesitant. 
"Angela, I... I wanted to apologize properly. I shouldn't have agreed to meet the client at that bar last night. I put you in danger, and I feel terrible about it."
I softened my expression. "Emily, what's done is done. Consider it a learning experience. Just be more careful with venue selections in the future, okay?"
She nodded gratefully, relief washing over her features. "Thank you, Angela. I won't let you down again." With a small bow, she left my office.
I returned to my phone call with Sophie. "Sorry about that. Where were we?"
"The divorce, Angela. You can't keep avoiding this conversation."
I was about to respond when movement caught my eye. Emily was back, pushing open my office door again, with Michael right behind her. At that exact moment, Sophie's voice rang out clearly through the speaker:
"If you weren't pregnant, I wouldn't be this worried! How are you planning to handle this? You can't keep dragging this out day after day-that baby bump isn't going to stay hidden forever!"
At that moment, I looked up to see Emily at the door, Michael right behind her, both clutching documents with eyes wide in shock.
###chapter 59: Had Sean Really Let Her Choose My Dress?
Angela POV
I quickly shut off my phone. Emily was the first to move. Without a word, she stepped forward and began arranging reports on my desk with careful precision. Her movements were different now-gentler, almost protective.
"The quarterly projections, Angela," she said softly, meeting my eyes with quiet understanding. "I've highlighted the key points from the Asian markets."
Michael closed the door behind him and moved to stand beside Emily. Though his face was composed as ever, his eyes held an unexpected warmth.
"Angela," he said, his voice low and careful as he placed his own stack of documents beside Emily's. "The board meeting has been rescheduled to three o'clock." He paused, studying my face with quiet concern.
"I've also taken the liberty of clearing your morning schedule. You've been working exceptionally hard lately. Perhaps some rest would be beneficial."
The gentle consideration in his voice made my eyes burn with unexpected tears. 
These two people-who had been thrust into the middle of this complicated situation through no fault of their own-were already moving to protect me, finding ways to lighten my burden without explicitly acknowledging why.
"I..." My voice caught, and I had to take a moment to steady it. "Thank you. Both of you."
Emily's hand twitched, as if she wanted to reach out to me but was restraining herself.
"I'll make sure to have fresh tea available in your office throughout the day," she said softly, her words careful and measured. "And perhaps some light snacks. Just in case you need anything during those long meetings."
I stared at her, touched by the simple thoughtfulness of the gesture. "You don't have to-"
"We want to," Michael interrupted, his tone brooking no argument. "Whatever you need, Angela. Whatever helps."
They turned to leave, moving in perfect synchronization as if they'd choreographed it. 
At the door, Emily paused, her hand resting lightly on the frame. Without turning around, she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper but filled with conviction，"We're on your side, Angela. Always."
Michael stood just behind her, his presence solid and reassuring. "No matter what," he added quietly, and in those three words I heard a pledge of loyalty that went far beyond professional obligation.
They slipped out quietly, closing the door behind them. 
Their loyalty wrapped around me like a protective blanket-unexpected and precious, like the secret growing beneath my heart.
***
The executive conference room felt unusually tense that afternoon.
"With all due respect, Mr. Shaw," Michael said, his tone suggesting respect was the last thing on his mind, "but that strategy seems shortsighted given the current market volatility."
Sean's eyebrows rose slightly at the challenge. I could see confusion flash across his face before he composed himself.
"Elaborate," he commanded.
Michael launched into a detailed critique that, while technically sound, carried an unmistakable edge of hostility. I watched as Sean's jaw tightened, his fingers tapping restlessly on the table.
When the meeting finally ended, Sean called out, "Michael, a moment."
But Michael was already gathering his materials with efficient movements. "My apologies, Mr. Shaw, but I have another meeting scheduled. Perhaps we can discuss this tomorrow." 
He left before Sean could respond, his departure just barely on the professional side of abrupt.
Sean turned to me, confusion evident in his green eyes. "What was that about?"
I kept my expression neutral as I stood, gathering my own materials. "Perhaps he's just having a bad day."
"He's the most even-tempered person I know. Or at least, he was until today." Sean countered.
I shrugged and chuckled to myself. Michael's behavior was a bit childish, but it still made me feel warm inside.
***
Back in our penthouse that evening, I found a garment bag hanging on my closet door. The Chanel label caught the light, and a small card was pinned to the front: "For tonight's dinner at Christopher's. - S"
Inside was a midnight blue evening gown, its silk surface catching the light like liquid starlight.
My phone buzzed with a text from Christopher: "Looking forward to seeing you tonight, Angel."
I stared at the message, then back at the dress. The evening stretched before me like a minefield, with Christopher's mysterious agenda, Christina's inevitable presence, and now this unexpectedly thoughtful gesture from Sean.
As if summoned by my thoughts, Sean appeared in the doorway. He'd already changed into a black tuxedo, his bow tie hanging loose around his neck. His eyes met mine in the mirror.
"The dress should fit perfectly," he said, his voice carefully neutral. "I had Sarah check your recent measurements."
I wondered if he'd noticed the subtle changes in my body, if he'd registered the slight softening of my waistline even before I had.
"Thank you," I replied, matching his neutral tone. "It's beautiful."
He stepped closer. "We should leave by seven. Christopher's particularly insistent about your attendance tonight."
Sean's hand reached out, almost touching my cheek before dropping back to his side. "Just... stay close to me tonight."
His sudden gentleness felt strange to me. But I tried to reassure myself-it was just one evening, what could possibly go wrong?
Christopher's townhouse stood as a masterpiece of understated luxury on one of the city's most prestigious streets, its limestone facade glowing warmly in the evening light.
As Sean and I ascended the front steps together, I could feel the eyes of the other guests on us.
We made quite the picture-Sean in his perfectly tailored black tuxedo, the cut emphasizing his broad shoulders and athletic build, while I wore a midnight blue gown that seemed to catch every shimmer of light. The sapphire earrings completed the ensemble, twinkling with each step.
I caught sight of Christina across the room, her fingers tightening visibly around her champagne glass as she took in our entrance.
The flash of raw jealousy in her eyes was unmistakable-Sean and I looked every bit the perfect couple, and she knew it. Her dramatic red gown suddenly seemed gaudy in comparison, trying too hard where my outfit spoke of effortless elegance.
But within seconds, her expression transformed into a bright, artificial smile.
"Angela, darling!" She approached us, her voice honey-sweet with practiced charm, though I could still see the tension in her shoulders.
"That dress is absolutely perfect on you. I knew it would be when I helped Sean pick it out."
Her words hit me like ice water, sending an uncomfortable chill down my spine.
Had Sean Really Let Her Choose My Dress?
The thought of them shopping together, Christina offering opinions about what would suit me... I pushed the image away, forcing myself to breathe slowly, steadily.
I felt Sean stiffen slightly beside me, but I couldn't bring myself to look at his expression, afraid of what I might see there.
Instead, I kept my smile carefully in place, making sure my voice remained perfectly steady. "Did you? How thoughtful."
###chapter 60: Dancing on My Grave
Angela POV
Christina's smile widened, triumph gleaming in her eyes.
 "Oh yes, Sean was so worried about getting it right. He said something about wanting to make sure you looked appropriate for the occasion. Luckily, I know exactly what works for your... current situation."
"Actually," Sean's voice cut through the tension, his green eyes fixing Christina with an unexpectedly stern look, "I happened to run into Christina at Bergdorf's while I was choosing your dress. She offered her opinion, that's all."
I stared at Sean, caught off guard by his swift correction of Christina's implication. Even more surprising was the warning glance he shot in her direction, causing her triumphant smile to falter slightly. 
This was... unexpected. Sean rarely contradicted Christina about anything.
Looking around the ballroom, I recognized so many familiar faces from the past two years. 
There was a time when their presence would have filled me with anxiety-when I would have obsessed over every detail of my appearance, every word I spoke, desperately seeking their approval and acceptance. 
But now? Now it all seemed so meaningless. 
Soon, I would leave this artificial world behind forever. How foolish I'd been, wasting so much energy trying to win the approval of people who were never truly friends to begin with.
"Sean! Angela!" William West's voice cut through the ambient chatter as he approached, champagne glass in hand. His smile was just a touch too wide, his eyes holding that familiar glint that usually preceded trouble. "You both look spectacular tonight."
I tensed slightly, recognizing the mischievous tone in William's voice. I'd known him long enough to sense when he was about to stir things up.
"Christina!" William called out suddenly. "Come join us! You remember that amazing waltz you and Sean performed at the university Spring Formal? The one that had everyone talking for weeks?"
The crowd parted slightly as Christina made her way over, her red dress a stark contrast to my more understated choice. 
She moved with practiced grace, but I could see the calculated nature of each step, the way her hips swayed just a bit too deliberately.
"How could I forget?" Christina's laugh tinkled like wind chimes. "Sean was always such a magnificent dancer. Remember how we used to practice in the student lounge after hours?"
William's grin widened. "Why don't you two show us if you've still got it? For old times' sake?"
The suggestion sent a ripple through the gathered crowd. I could hear the whispers starting already:
"They were such a perfect couple in college..." 
"Remember how everyone thought they'd end up together?" 
"Well, this marriage to Angela is just business anyway..."
I kept my expression carefully neutral as I sipped my water, disguised in a champagne flute. I turned my attention to the elaborate spread of hors d'oeuvres nearby.
"Sean and Christina were legendary at every social event," someone in the crowd added. "When are we going to see that magic again?"
Evan White cleared his throat. "I believe Sean's dancing these days is reserved for his wife." His tone was pleasant but firm, his eyes meeting William's with quiet warning.
Christina's smile didn't waver, but I noticed her fingers tightening almost imperceptibly around her champagne stem. 
"Oh, I wouldn't dream of imposing," she said sweetly, taking a step closer to Sean. "Unless, of course, Angela doesn't mind? We could give everyone a little taste of nostalgia."
I continued selecting carefully from the appetizer selection, appearing completely absorbed in the task. I could feel Christina's presence beside me, practically vibrating with barely contained anticipation.
"Angela?" Christina's voice took on a harder edge. "I'm speaking to you. The polite thing would be to respond."
The room grew quieter, the background conversation dying down as people turned to watch the interaction. I delicately picked up a smoked salmon canapé, examining it with profound interest.
"Angela," Christina's voice softened with practiced concern, her eyes searching the watching crowd. "I only want to be friends. Is something wrong? You seem so... distant lately."
"Angela knows exactly what she's doing," Jennifer Moore, Christina's closest friend, cut in sharply. "Playing the quiet, dignified wife while she's nothing but a gold-digging opportunist from a bankrupt family. Everyone knows she trapped Sean into this marriage. A failed investment banker's daughter trying to climb the social ladder-how pathetic. At least Christina comes from real money, not some washed-up-"
"Choose your next words very carefully." Sean's green eyes had turned to ice as he stared her down.
"Sean," Christina laid a hand on his arm, her voice honey-sweet. "Jennifer's just had a bit too much champagne. She doesn't mean-"
"Apologize to my wife." Sean's tone left no room for argument. "Now."
Jennifer's face flushed red. "I won't apologize to someone who-"
"Then leave." Sean's voice cut through the air like a whip. "Either apologize to Mrs. Shaw, or security will escort you out."
"Sean!" Christina's voice held a note of panic. "You can't be serious. Jennifer's one of my oldest friends!"
"Which is the only reason she's being given the choice to leave on her own rather than being removed immediately." Sean's expression remained impassive. "Your friendship doesn't give her the right to insult my wife in my presence."
The tension in the room was palpable as Jennifer stood her ground for a moment longer before turning on her heel and storming out. 
Christina watched her go, her perfectly maintained composure showing its first crack of the evening.
"May I have this dance?"
The quiet question came from Christopher, who had appeared at my side. He held out his hand with an elegant flourish, his expression warm but carefully neutral.
I set down my plate and placed my hand in his without hesitation. "You may."
###chapter 61: Blood in the Garden
Angela POV
I placed my hand in Christopher's, acutely aware of the eyes watching our every move.
As we stepped onto the dance floor, I caught Sean's expression darkening from the corner of my eye. Even with Christina trying to hold his attention, his gaze remained fixed on us.
The string quartet had just begun a slow waltz. Christopher's lead was impeccable, each step flowing naturally into the next. I had to admit, he moved with the kind of grace that came from years of prestigious boarding schools and social training.
"You've changed, Angela," Christopher observed as we moved across the floor. "There's a strength in you now that wasn't there before."
"Life has a way of teaching us what we need to learn," I replied carefully, maintaining the proper distance between us as we turned. I felt the sapphire earrings Sean had given me catch the light, a subtle reminder of the complexities of my situation.
"Indeed it does." His hand at my waist was perfectly proper, yet somehow still managed to convey an intimacy that made me uncomfortable. "Tell me, does it bother you? The way they talk about your marriage?"
My step never faltered, though my pulse quickened slightly. "Which part? The fact that it's a business arrangement, or the speculation about its impending end?"
Christopher's laugh was low and private. "Both, I suppose. Though I must admit, you wear the role of Mrs. Shaw with remarkable grace for someone who knows it's temporary."
"Practice makes perfect," I answered with a smile that didn't quite reach my eyes. As we turned again, I caught another glimpse of Sean. His jaw was clenched, his posture rigid. Christina stood beside him, her red dress a stark contrast to his black tuxedo, her hand resting possessively on his arm.
"Ah, but is it just a role?" Christopher's fingers brushed against my hair as we completed another turn, the gesture so subtle it might have been accidental. "You've always been more than you appear, Little Angel."
The old nickname struck me like a physical blow. Memories flooded back-his subtle cruelties, the way he'd use that gentle tone while reminding me of my place, his smiles masking contempt as he watched me struggle to fit into Sean's world.
The music drew to a close, and Christopher stepped back with an elegant bow. "Thank you for the dance," he murmured, his eyes holding mine for a moment too long. "We should do this more often."
Before I could respond, Sean's voice cut through the moment. "You and Christopher seem quite comfortable together." His tone was carefully neutral, but I could hear the tension thrumming beneath the surface.
I turned to face him, noting how the perfect knot of his bow tie had somehow come slightly loose. "Do we? How observant of you to notice, considering how busy you've been with Christina."
"At least I haven't danced with Christina tonight," Sean snapped.
I didn't want to argue anymore. The crowded ballroom suddenly felt suffocating, and a wave of dizziness washed over me. I turned and left the ballroom, heading toward the powder room.
***
I stood before the mirror in the powder room, pressing a cool, damp cloth to the back of my neck. 
The evening's tensions had left me feeling slightly lightheaded, though I couldn't be sure if it was the pregnancy or simply the emotional toll of navigating these treacherous social waters.
After leaving the powder room, I decided to take a moment to catch my breath in Christopher's garden. The cool night air was a welcome relief from the stuffiness of the party. 
As I walked along the stone path, voices carried from around the corner, making me pause.
"Did you see how she was throwing herself at Christopher?" Jennifer Moore's voice dripped with venom. "Sean hadn't even finished breaking up with her, and she's already moving on to the next rich man."
I froze, realizing with shock that Jennifer was still here despite Sean having thrown her out earlier. Christina's laugh joined in, sharp and mocking.
"What else would you expect from a girl like her?" Christina's voice was thick with disdain. "She's nothing but a gold-digger who got lucky with Sean. And now that he's finally seeing through her act, she's desperately searching for her next target."
"The way she was dancing with Christopher..." another voice chimed in. "Like a born whore. Did you see how close they were?"
"Christopher really is the perfect catch," one of Christina's friends sighed. "I was planning to ask him for a dance tonight. But that bitch Angela stole all his attention!"
My hands clenched into fists at my sides. The rational part of my mind told me to walk away, to not give them the satisfaction of a response. I was tired, and all I wanted was to go home and rest. 
But as I turned to leave, my heel caught on a fallen branch, the crack echoing in the quiet garden.
"Well, well," Jennifer's voice turned gleeful. "Look who's been eavesdropping."
I turned to face them, keeping my expression neutral. "Eavesdropping implies I care what you have to say. I was simply taking a walk."
Jennifer stormed toward me, her face contorted with rage. "You think you're so much better than us, don't you?" She reached for my hair, but I stepped back quickly, my hand instinctively moving to protect my stomach.
"Don't touch me," I warned, but she kept coming.
When she grabbed my arm, I reacted without thinking. My heel came down hard on her foot, making her howl in pain. But she didn't let go. Instead, she yanked me forward, her other hand still reaching for my hair.
"Jennifer, stop!" I tried to pull away, increasingly worried about my baby. The struggle grew more intense, with Jennifer pulling and pushing while I tried to protect myself without escalating the violence.
Christina moved closer, presumably to help Jennifer. In the chaos of the moment, she lost her balance on the uneven garden path. I watched in horror as she fell backward, her head connecting with the base of a marble statue with a sickening thud.
The garden went silent except for Christina's pained moan.
###chapter 62: The Jealous Wife？
Angela POV
For a moment, no one moved.
Then everything erupted at once. Christina's friends rushed to her side, their voices rising in panic as they saw blood beginning to trickle from a cut on her forehead.
Jennifer released my arm, stumbling backward as if she'd been burned.
"Christina!" The cry came from the direction of the house. Sean's voice, filled with alarm.
He appeared on the garden path, Christopher close behind him. Sean's eyes found me first, taking in my disheveled appearance with growing concern. "Angela," he said, moving toward me. "Did someone-"
"Mr. Shaw!" One of Christina's friends called out. "Christina's bleeding!"
Sean's head whipped around, his expression changing as he saw Christina on the ground.
"She's hurt," he said to me, already moving toward her. "I need to check on her. Wait here."
I watched as he knelt beside Christina, his hands gentle as he examined her injury. The sight sent a sharp pain through my chest that had nothing to do with my recent struggle with Jennifer. I should be used to this by now, shouldn't I?
After so many years of watching him put Christina first, after countless moments just like this one, why did it still hurt?
"She pushed her!" Jennifer's voice cut through the night air. "Christina just wanted to talk, and Angela pushed her into the statue! I saw it with my own eyes!"
"That's right!" Another voice joined in. "We all saw it!"
Sean's head snapped up, his eyes finding mine again. The question in them felt like a physical blow.
"I didn't-" I started to say, but Christina's dramatic groan cut me off.
"Sean," she whimpered, reaching for him. "It hurts..."
Without hesitation, Sean gathered her in his arms. "We need to get you to the hospital," he said, his voice soft with concern. "You might have a concussion."
As he carried her past me, Christina's head resting against his chest, I caught the flash of a smile on her face. It was gone in an instant, replaced by a grimace of pain, but I knew what I'd seen.
"She did this on purpose!" Jennifer's shrill voice pierced through the tense atmosphere. "Angela pushed Christina because she was jealous. Everyone knows Christina is the woman Sean truly loves!"
"That's right!" Another voice chimed in. "She couldn't stand seeing them together. She's always been nothing but a gold-digger trying to hold onto the Shaw family fortune!"
The whispers and accusations swirled around me like poison. I could feel the weight of judgmental stares, some hostile, others filled with a particularly crushing form of pity.
Their expressions said it all:
Poor thing, her husband just carried another woman away in his arms. What did she expect? Everyone knows she's just the temporary Mrs. Shaw.
"That's enough." Christopher's voice cut through the chaos, sharp and authoritative. "I won't tolerate baseless accusations at my home. If anyone has a problem with Mrs. Shaw, they can leave immediately."
The garden fell silent, but the damage was done. The image was already set in their minds:
Christina, the innocent victim in Sean's arms, and me, the jealous wife who'd resorted to violence.
"Angela." Christopher stepped closer, his amber eyes filled with concern. "Angela, are you alright?" His voice was gentle, almost tender, as he reached out as if to comfort me.
I shook my head, already moving toward the house. "I need to be alone."
In the grand foyer, Evan caught up with me as I retrieved my wrap. "Angela," he said softly, "you should know that Sean was looking for you first. When we heard the commotion, you were his first concern."
I gave him a sad smile. "Was I? Then why is he in his car right now, rushing Christina to the hospital?"
"Angela-"
"It's fine, Evan." I cut him off gently. "I've known for a long time where I stand. Tonight just made it clearer."
I walked out of Christopher's townhouse into the cool night air. Sean had driven us here together, but now I was left to find my own way home.
With slightly trembling fingers, I opened the Uber app on my phone. Just as I was confirming my ride, Sophie's call came through.
"I heard what happened," she said without preamble. "Are you okay?"
"I'm fine." The words felt hollow even as I spoke them. "Christina's the one in the hospital."
"Please," Sophie scoffed. "That fall was about as accidental as my last designer bag. Think about it, Ang. The secluded garden, the convenient witnesses, the dramatic injury... It's all too perfect."
"What are you saying?"
"I'm saying that Christina Jordan doesn't do anything without a plan. She wanted to be alone with you in that garden. She wanted those witnesses there. And most of all, she wanted Sean to see her vulnerable and hurt, with you as the villain."
The truth of Sophie's words settled over me like a heavy blanket. "She's good," I admitted quietly. "I'll give her that."
"She's desperate," Sophie corrected. "The pregnancy rumors are starting to circulate, and she knows her time is running out. A woman like that is capable of anything."
I placed a protective hand over my stomach, thinking of the tiny life growing inside me. "I need to be more careful."
"You need to be ready," Sophie said firmly. "This is just the beginning. Christina won't stop until she gets what she wants."
###chapter 63: Old Friends, New Games
Angela POV
"You sound upset," Sophie said softly. "Come stay at my place tonight. We can talk, just like old times."
"Elizabeth is waiting for us at home," I told Sophie. "I don't want her to worry. I should head back. And I don't want to burden you too much, Sophie - you've already helped me so much." After I hung up the phone, I felt something drape across my shoulders, startling me.
I turned to find Christopher draping his cashmere coat over me, his amber eyes reflecting concern as they lingered on the faint scratches Jennifer's nails had left on my cheek.
"I'll call you back," I murmured to Sophie, ending the call.
Christopher's fingers brushed lightly over the marks on my face. "These should heal quickly," he said softly, "though I doubt the social damage will fade as easily."
I stepped back slightly, maintaining a polite distance. "The social damage was precisely what Jennifer wanted. She's quite skilled at manipulating situations to her advantage."
"Indeed." Christopher's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Would you join me for some tea? There's an excellent French patisserie just around the corner. We have quite a bit of catching up to do, Angel."
The old nickname stirred something in my chest-a mix of nostalgia and wariness. After a moment's hesitation, I nodded.
I was surprised when he took me to the dessert shop we used to frequent in high school. It was small and inexpensive, but filled with memories of our youth. "I can't believe this place is still here," I said.
"Your old friend is still here," Christopher said as we settled into a quiet corner table.
I couldn't help but smile. "You always did know all the best places."
"Some things never change." He gestured to the waiter, ordering in perfect French. "Though other things..." his eyes met mine, "have changed quite dramatically."
Christopher absently touched the tie clip I'd given him years ago-the one he still wore after all this time.
"Actually, I just got back yesterday afternoon," he admitted suddenly. "I saw you at Sean's company building downstairs. I thought you were doing well."
"The black Bentley?" I asked, remembering the car I'd seen while buying a sandwich yesterday afternoon. I had thought I was imagining things.
"Yes."
"Then why didn't you get out of the car and say hello?" I asked teasingly. "I thought I was being stalked! You should know that even being Sean's wife in name only, this title is quite valuable."
Christopher's lips curved into an amused smile. "I wanted to surprise you," he said softly.
"How long will you be staying in New York this time?" I asked, stirring my tea.
"I'm planning to develop my business here for the long term," he replied, his eyes holding mine. "We'll have plenty of chances to meet up from now on."
I laughed lightly. "Don't get ahead of yourself. I'm not exactly swimming in free time these days."
"Have you been well these past few years?" Christopher asked softly.
I fell silent, my fingers tracing the rim of my teacup. So much had happened in these years - my family's bankruptcy, my marriage to Sean, the pregnancy... Had I been well? I wasn't sure. Perhaps there were moments, those days with Sean, when I had found some happiness.
Seeing my prolonged silence, Christopher's expression filled with regret. "I shouldn't have asked that," he said quietly. "Actually, these past couple of days, I've seen you and Sean..." He trailed off, leaving the words hanging in the air.
After a moment, he leaned forward slightly, his voice growing serious, "When I left for London five years ago, I thought I was making the right choice. The opportunity at the City was too good to pass up. But then I heard about Wilson Investment's collapse, and..."
He paused, his fingers tightening around his teacup. "If I had been here, things might have been different. You wouldn't have had to-"
"Please," I said softly, gently interrupting him. "What's done is done. The past can't be changed." My voice was quiet but firm, trying to cushion the finality of my words.
His smile turned sad. "No, I suppose it can't. But the future... that's still unwritten, isn't it?"
Before I could respond, his phone lit up with an incoming call. The name "Kate" flashed across the screen, but Christopher silenced it without a second glance.
"Your sister?" I asked, remembering Kate.
Christopher nodded slightly. "Don't worry about her. It's nothing important."
The conversation shifted to safer topics after that-memories of shared classes, mutual friends, the changing landscape of Wall Street. But underneath the pleasant reminiscence, I could sense something else building, like storm clouds gathering on the horizon.
It was well past midnight when Christopher's car pulled up outside my building.
"Thank you for the night," I said politely, preparing to step out of the car. "I'm sorry I ruined your party tonight."
Christopher smiled. "Don't worry about it. New York never runs out of parties, does it?"
As I reached for the door handle, Christopher caught my hand, his grip gentle but insistent. "Angela." His voice was low, intense. "Whatever happens in the coming weeks, remember you're not alone."
I withdrew my hand carefully. "Goodnight, Christopher."
The elevator ride to the penthouse felt longer than usual. Elizabeth would be asleep by now, sparing me the need to explain my late return.
But as the doors opened, I found Sean standing in the hallway, his expression unreadable in the dim light.
"Where have you been?" His voice carried an edge I hadn't heard before. "Why aren't you answering your phone?"
###chapter 64: Did You Come Back Just to Blame Me?
Angela POV
I stood in the dimly lit hallway of our penthouse, still processing his unexpected presence.
After Christopher's gentle concern at the patisserie, Sean's harsh tone felt like a slap. The night had already been exhausting enough with the drama at the party, and now this confrontation seemed inevitable.
"My phone died," I replied, keeping my voice steady despite the lie.
It was easier than explaining my evening with Christopher, easier than dealing with Sean's reaction to knowing I'd spent hours reminiscing with his oldest friend.
Sean crossed the space between us in three long strides.
"Your phone died?" His hand extended expectantly. "Show me."
The demand sent a surge of indignation through me, but I retrieved my phone anyway, unlocking it with deliberate slowness. I watched his eyes narrow as he noticed the nearly full battery indicator.
"You were with Christopher." His voice was flat, accusatory.
"And you were at the hospital with Christina," I countered, unable to keep the edge from my voice. "How is she? Did the doctors manage to save her from that terrible, life-threatening scratch?"
Sean's jaw tightened visibly. "Christina's injury was serious. The cut required stitches, and she might have a concussion."
"How convenient," I murmured, moving past him toward our bedroom. "I'm sure she'll milk every moment of attention she can get from it."
"Angela." His voice held a warning as he followed me. "Christina was hurt. You should visit her in the hospital, show some concern."
I froze mid-step, turning slowly to face him. "Visit her?" A bitter laugh escaped my lips. "Why should I visit the woman who orchestrated this entire situation? The woman who had her friends falsely accuse me of assault?"
"It wasn't like that," Sean argued, running a hand through his already disheveled hair. "Jennifer was out of line, yes, but Christina tried to stop her. She was caught in the middle-"
"Caught in the middle?" My voice rose slightly. "Is that what she told you while you were carrying her to your car? While you were rushing to be her knight in shining armor, leaving your wife to find her own way home?"
Sean's expression darkened. "You're being unreasonable. This isn't about-" He paused, then continued with an accusing tone, "Have you forgotten how Christina took care of you when you were sick? Can't you just be a little nicer to her?"
His words made my blood boil. Christina's "care" during my fever?
What a joke. She hadn't been concerned about my wellbeing at all-she'd simply used it as another opportunity to get closer to Sean, to prevent any intimacy between us.
But Sean either couldn't-or wouldn't-see through her act. Or perhaps worse, he saw the truth and still chose to take her side, just like he was doing now.
"Whatever you think," I cut him off, my careful composure finally cracking, "I won't be visiting your precious little girlfriend. And more than that, I want her and Jennifer to publicly apologize on Instagram for spreading lies about me pushing her deliberately tonight."
"Let's end this here," Sean said firmly. "Christina is seriously hurt right now. She can't handle any more stress. Besides, she didn't say anything against you today."
A bitter smile crossed my face as I fought back tears. "Then why aren't you with her right now?" I asked, my voice dripping with sarcasm. "What are you even doing here? Did you come back just to blame me?"
His words made my stomach churn. Even now, after everything that had happened, he was still defending her, still protecting her. The scratches on my face from Jennifer's attack apparently meant nothing to him, but Christina's minor injury was somehow a crisis requiring his complete devotion.
Sean's expression softened, his voice gentling. "It's not like that, Angela. Let me explain..."
But I didn't want to hear his explanations anymore. I'd heard enough of them over the years-all the ways he would try to rationalize his behavior, all the excuses he would make for Christina. I was tired of it all.
I pushed past him into our bedroom suite, heading straight for the master bathroom. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for my makeup remover, desperate for some mundane task to focus on.
I could see Sean's reflection behind mine in the mirror as he followed me into the bathroom. His expression softened as he noticed the faint scratches on my cheek from Jennifer's nails. He reached out, his fingers ghosting over the marks.
"You're hurt," he said softly. "Let me help you with that."
I jerked away from his touch as if burned. "Don't," I whispered, my voice breaking. "Don't pretend to care now."
"Angela-"
"No!" I grabbed the nearest object-a crystal perfume bottle-and hurled it at him. It shattered against the wall beside his head, filling the air with the scent of jasmine. "Don't touch me! Don't you dare touch me!"
Sean stared at me, shock written across his features. In all our years together, through all our arguments and tensions, I had never lost control like this.
"You're being hysterical," he said, his voice hard with anger. "This isn't like you."
I grabbed another bottle, my hands shaking. "You don't know what I'm like! You've never known, because you've never cared to look past your precious Christina long enough to see me!"
The bathroom counter between us was littered with broken glass and spilled perfume, a physical manifestation of our shattered facade. My chest heaved with emotion, one hand unconsciously moving to protect my stomach-a gesture that didn't escape Sean's notice.
His eyes narrowed, focusing on that protective placement of my hand. For a moment, something like understanding flickered across his face, but before he could speak, I found my voice again.
"Get out," I whispered, my tone leaving no room for argument. "Just... get out."
Sean stood frozen for a moment longer, his expression a complex mix of anger, confusion, and something else-something that might have been concern. Then, without another word, he turned and left, the bedroom door closing behind him with a decisive click.
In the sudden silence, I sagged against the counter, my legs barely supporting my weight. A wave of nausea hit me-whether from the pregnancy or emotional exhaustion, I couldn't tell.
As I sank to the cold marble floor, careful to avoid the broken glass, I pressed my hand protectively against my stomach. "I'm sorry, little one," I whispered. "Mommy will be strong for you."
###chapter 65: When She Smiles For Another
Sean POV
The elevator descended to the parking garage. I caught my reflection in its brass walls - disheveled hair, loosened tie, a face I barely recognized. The events of the night had taken their toll.
I'd chosen to leave the penthouse temporarily, hoping to give Angela some space to cool down.
Our argument was getting nowhere, and the last thing I wanted was to wake Grandmother Elizabeth with our fighting. She needed her rest, not the stress of mediating another conflict between us.
I strode toward my Bentley, each footstep echoing against concrete in the dim garage.
My phone felt like lead in my hand, Angela's name still illuminated on the screen from my last failed attempt to reach her.
Three missed calls. Seven unread messages. Her silence spoke volumes.
Inside the car, I sat motionless, staring through the windshield at nothing in particular. The leather seat creaked softly as I reached for my cigarette case-a habit I'd supposedly quit years ago.
The flame from my lighter briefly illuminated the space around me, and I watched the smoke curl toward the ceiling.
I wasn't trying to blame her, I thought, taking a long drag. I just wanted to know she was safe.
But it seemed she had misunderstood me. No matter how I tried to explain, she refused to listen.
The events at Christopher's mansion kept replaying in my mind: the commotion in the garden, Christina's injury, Angela's stony expression as I carried Christina to the car. Everything had spiraled so quickly, like a carefully choreographed dance gone terribly wrong.
After making sure Christina's injury wasn't serious, I rushed back home immediately. I needed to know Angela was alright too. 
But as soon as I stepped into our building's lobby, I stopped dead in my tracks. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I saw Christopher's Mercedes pulling up outside.
Angela was with him, stepping out of his car with a bright smile on her face. They were chatting and laughing together, as if the chaos from earlier tonight had nothing to do with them. 
The sight hit me harder than I expected - while I'd been worried sick about her, she was perfectly fine, enjoying Christopher's company.
She can smile like that for others, I thought bitterly, but she can't even stand my touch anymore. The cigarette ash fell onto my tailored pants, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
My phone buzzed, Christina's name lighting up the screen. Her voice came through weak and trembling: "Sean... where are you? I'm so scared being alone, and the wound is bleeding again..."
My grip tightened on the steering wheel. The doctor's words echoed in my mind-possible concussion, need for observation. And it had happened because of...
I cut off that thought before it could fully form. Starting the engine, I tried to push away the image of Angela's smile at Christopher. 
Christina needed help now. Questions about Angela would have to wait.
***
I had just arrived at the hospital when I heard a woman's voice raised in argument with Michael.
"I asked for strawberries, not cherries!" she was shouting.
"The strawberries are sold out," Michael replied, his voice ice cold.
"Then can't you just go to another store?"
"Mr. Shaw asked me to look after Miss Christina, but I'm not your servant!"
I pushed open the ward door. "Keep it down," I snapped. "Christina needs rest."
The woman fell silent instantly. When I got a better look, I recognized Jennifer - the same one who had falsely accused Angela earlier. My irritation deepened.
"Why are you still here?" I asked Jennifer coldly. "Haven't you caused enough trouble today? Who are you trying to pick a fight with now?"
"Sean!" Jennifer immediately turned to complain. "Your employee can't even do something as simple as buying strawberries! What kind of service is this?"
"That's right," another woman chimed in, her designer dress and perfectly manicured nails speaking of old money and entitlement. "If you can't even manage such a basic task, how can we trust you to look after Christina properly?"
My jaw tightened. "Since when," I asked coldly, "do my employees take orders from anyone but me?"
"Sean!" Christina's voice, soft and pained, drew my attention. She stood in the doorway of her private room, barefoot and swaying slightly. The white bandage around her head made her look especially vulnerable. "I'm so sorry... I heard Michael was upset, and I wanted to apologize to everyone."
I moved quickly to steady her, noting how she seemed to lean into my touch just a fraction more than necessary.
 "You shouldn't be out of bed,"
"I know," Christina's voice trembled. "I just... I feel terrible about everything. Are you angry with me?"
Seeing her in such a vulnerable state, I softened my tone to comfort her. I guided her back to her bed, aware of the eyes watching our every move.
"How could I ever be angry with you?"
Christina's hand found mine, her touch light but insistent. "Thank you for coming back," she whispered. "I was so scared, and you're the only one who..."
"You should rest," I cut her off, gently but firmly extracting my hand. "I'll have the nurse check on you."
In the hallway, I turned to Michael. "Make sure Jennifer and the others leave. Then go home. It's late."
"Of course, Mr. Shaw." Michael's tone was perfectly professional, but there was something in his eyes-disapproval? judgment?-that made my skin prickle. "Will you be returning to the office tomorrow morning, or should I reschedule your meetings?"
"I'll be there," I replied shortly, already heading for the elevator.
"Sean, are you leaving?" Christina's tearful voice echoed behind me.
###chapter 66: Midnight Promises
Sean POV
I took in Christina's fragile form in the doorway of her hospital room. She stood barefoot, swaying slightly, the white bandage around her head making her look unnaturally pale under the harsh fluorescent lights.
"You should be in bed," I said, moving to steady her as I guided her back to her room.
"I just..." Christina's voice wavered. "I don't want to be alone right now."
"I'm not leaving," I assured her, loosening my bow tie. "I was just going to get something for you."
Her eyes widened slightly. "At this hour?"
"You mentioned wanting strawberries earlier, didn't you?" I checked my watch-just past midnight. "I'll find some for you."
"Sean, you don't have to-"
"Rest," I cut her off gently. "I won't be long."
***
The city stretched before me, a maze of neon signs and empty sidewalks. Most shops had closed hours ago, their darkened windows reflecting the occasional passing car.
I drove methodically, scanning for any sign of an open market or convenience store.
Waiting at a red light, my mind drifted to another late-night food run, years ago. Angela had shown up at my apartment at 2 AM with soup from my favorite Chinese restaurant, knowing I'd been working late on a merger deal.
She hadn't said anything about the hour, just set up the food on my desk and sat quietly beside me while I ate, occasionally pointing out errors in my financial models.
The memory hit me with unexpected force. Angela had always done things like that-quiet acts of care that never demanded acknowledgment. Even now, years into our marriage, she still...
My hands tightened on the steering wheel. No. I wouldn't think about Angela right now.
Not about the way she'd looked at me earlier, hurt and betrayal etched across her features.
Not about the sound of shattering glass in our bathroom, or the way she'd recoiled from my touch as if it burned.
Finally, after nearly an hour of searching, I found a 24-hour Korean market in the East Village. The owner eyed me curiously as I purchased their last container of strawberries-a executive in evening wear was probably not their usual 1 AM customer.
***
Christina's face lit up when I returned with the fruit.
"You actually found some," she said softly, watching as I arranged the strawberries on a plate. "I can't believe you went to all that trouble for me."
"It wasn't trouble." I placed the plate on her bedside table, noting how the harsh hospital lighting made the cut on her forehead look worse than it was.
"Sean..." Her fingers brushed against mine as I adjusted the plate. "About what happened at the party..."
"Actually," I cut in gently, "I wanted to talk about that. The things Jennifer said about Angela-they weren't true, were they?"
Christina's hand withdrew slowly. "Why are you asking me this now?"
"Because accusations like that can damage someone's reputation." I kept my voice carefully neutral. "It would help if you could clarify what really happened on social media."
"Oh." Christina's expression shifted, something calculating flickering behind her eyes. "So you brought me strawberries just to ask for Angela's sake?"
"That's not what this is about," I said firmly. "Christina, I need you to understand something. The rumors and accusations from tonight-they need to be addressed. I can't stand by and let anyone insult or humiliate Angela anymore."
I used to think that being my wife would protect her from all of this. That no one would dare disrespect her.
But I was completely wrong. Maybe it's my own negligence that's given others the courage to attack her. My silence has made her vulnerable.
Christina picked up a strawberry, taking a delicate bite before nodding slowly. "Sean," she said softly, her voice honey-sweet, "whatever you want me to do, I'll do it."
A nurse appeared in the doorway, clipboard in hand. "Mr. Shaw? The Doctor would like to discuss Miss Jordan's treatment plan."
The doctor's news was direct: while the cut would heal, there might be scarring. Christina's reaction was immediate-her composure crumbling as tears filled her eyes.
"A scar?" Her voice trembled. "But... my face..."
"The procedures for scar reduction are quite advanced now," the Doctor assured her. "With proper treatment-"
"What if it doesn't work?" Christina's hand clutched my arm. "What if I'm left with this mark forever? You won't want..."
"Christina, look at me. It's going to be fine. We'll get you the best treatment available."
I couldn't help but feel a little irritated. It was just a tiny scar-why was she so panicked about it? She seemed to care way too much about how she looked.
She raised her tear-stained face to mine, and before I could react, Christina had pressed her lips against mine. The kiss lasted only a moment before I pulled back.
"I'm sorry," Christina whispered, though her eyes held no real regret. "I just... I'm so scared of losing you, Sean. First Angela, and now this..."
I stepped back, creating careful distance between us. "You should get some rest," I said quietly. "It's late."
But as I moved toward the door, Christina's voice stopped me:
"Are you going back to her?" Her voice grew softer, almost pleading.
"Please, stay with me tonight. My head hurts so much, and I'm scared..."
###chapter 67: Instagram Wars
Angela POV
The insistent buzz of my phone dragged me from sleep, Sophie's name flashing across the screen. Sean's side of the bed remained untouched from the night before. Obviously, he hadn't come home-no doubt spending another night at the hospital with Christina.
"Have you seen it?" Sophie's voice crackled with barely contained fury. "Tell me you've seen what that manipulative little-"
"Sophie," I interrupted, pressing my fingers against my temple where a headache was already beginning to form. "It's barely dawn. What are you talking about?"
"Christina's Instagram post. Check it. Now."
With a sigh, I pulled up the app, immediately spotting Christina's latest update. The timestamp read 1:17 AM. The image showed a man in evening wear-though his face was partially obscured, his tall, commanding figure was unmistakable-arranging fresh strawberries on a hospital bedside table.
The caption read: "Some people bring flowers. He searches the city at 1 AM to find my favorite fruit. #TrueLove #MyHero #BlessedAndGrateful
The comments section was already flooded with responses:
"This is what real love looks like! "
"You two are literally perfect together!"
"OMG, he went looking for strawberries at 1 AM? That's so romantic!"
"Power couple goals! "
My stomach churned, though whether from morning sickness or the sight before me, I couldn't tell.
"Angela?" Sophie's voice softened with concern. "Are you still there?"
"I'm here." I kept my voice carefully neutral, even as my free hand unconsciously moved to rest on my still-flat stomach. "It's just an Instagram post, Sophie."
"Just an Instagram-" Sophie's incredulous laugh cut through the line. "This is a calculated move and you know it. She's marking her territory, making sure everyone sees her as the woman he truly loves. And after last night's drama? The timing is no coincidence."
I closed my eyes, remembering the shattered perfume bottles in our bathroom, the look on Sean's face as he'd walked away. "None of it matters anymore."
"Angela-" Sophie's voice caught. "You're not feeling well again, are you? I'm coming over."
"No, I-" A wave of nausea hit me suddenly, forcing me to swallow hard. "I'm fine."
"I'll be there in twenty minutes."
***
The private wing of the hospital was eerily quiet this early in the morning. Sophie's designer heels clicked against the polished floor as she paced the examination room, her fashion editor's eye critically assessing every detail of the supposedly luxury space.
"This is ridiculous," she muttered. "You're Sean Shaw's wife. You should be in the VIP suite, not this glorified closet."
"Sophie," I warned quietly. The last thing I needed was her starting another scene. Last night's drama at Christopher's party was still fresh enough.
The door opened, admitting a young female doctor, her white coat immaculate despite the early hour. "Mrs. Shaw," she greeted me with professional warmth. "What brings you in today?"
"I've been feeling unwell since morning," I explained softly.
The young doctor's eyes settled on me with gentle concern. "Any changes in diet? Stress levels?"
I almost laughed at that. Stress levels? Where would I even begin?
"The usual morning challenges," I said instead, keeping my voice light. "Nothing serious."
"I see." She made a few notes on her tablet. "Well, given your condition, we should run some basic tests. And I'd strongly recommend limiting sugar intake for now."
After the examination, Sophie and I sat in her car, the privacy screens providing a moment of sanctuary from the outside world. She reached over and squeezed my hand, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.
"I can't believe him," she said, her voice tight with anger. "His wife is here dealing with morning sickness, and where is he? Spending the night in the hospital with another woman." She shook her head in disgust. "What kind of man neglects his pregnant wife like this?"
"Sophie..." I started, but she cut me off.
"No, Angela. Don't defend him. You're carrying his child, and he's out there playing knight in shining armor for Christina?" She took a deep breath, visibly trying to calm herself. "Listen to me. You don't have to go through this alone. I promise you, I'll be here every step of the way. We'll make sure this baby comes into the world healthy and strong, with or without Sean's support."
Her fierce protectiveness made my throat tight with emotion. For a moment, I couldn't speak, just squeezed her hand back in silent gratitude.
"Now," Sophie said, straightening her shoulders with determination, "let's go shopping. You need some new clothes that will keep you comfortable as the pregnancy progresses."
We headed to her favorite luxury boutique. As we browsed through racks of designer dresses, her phone buzzed. Her expression darkened as she checked the screen.
"Have you heard?" she asked, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Christina's been posting more hospital updates. Apparently, the cut might leave a scar." She paused meaningfully. "Some people are already suggesting it was a deliberate attack."
I closed my eyes, suddenly exhausted. "Sophie, please."
"I'm just saying, you need to be careful. Christina and her friends aren't going to let this go. If she really ends up with a scar-they'll use it against you. You know how these society women operate."
I nodded slowly, remembering how Jennifer had lunged at me in the garden last night. The memory sent a chill down my spine.
She had been so aggressive, so unpredictable... I instinctively placed a protective hand over my stomach.
Sophie was right-I needed to be more careful now. Not just for my sake, but for my baby's safety.
***
The apartment was silent when I returned that evening, my arms laden with shopping bags-retail therapy at Sophie's insistence.
My phone, which I'd turned off hours ago to avoid the constant stream of social media notifications, showed multiple missed calls from Sean.
He was waiting in the foyer, his expression stormy. "Where have you been?"
"Shopping with Sophie." I set the bags down carefully, noting how his jaw clenched at my casual tone. "My phone died."
"All day?" His voice carried an edge of disbelief. "You've been unreachable all day?"
"Is there something urgent you needed?" I turned to face him, my voice deliberately calm. "If this is about Christina, I want you to know that I've decided not to care about Jennifer and her slander anymore."
 A small, tired smile crossed my face.
"There. Are you satisfied now?"
###chapter 68: I Bought Those Strawberries Because—
Angela POV
Sean's jaw clenched visibly in the dim foyer light.
"Christina's going to post about the accident on Instagram. Clear up any... misunderstandings."
"Oh?" I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. "Like that touching midnight strawberry delivery photo? How thoughtful of her to document your devotion so thoroughly."
"She was injured," Sean's voice rose defensively. "And I bought those strawberries because-"
I cut him off, not wanting to hear the rest. I didn't need him to explain how important Christina was to him-his actions had already made that crystal clear.
 "Of course," I said, my voice dripping with quiet venom. "Buying strawberries for your beloved in the middle of the night is perfectly natural. No explanation needed."
The flash of hurt in Sean's eyes gave me a moment of bitter satisfaction. Let him feel a fraction of what I felt every time he rushed to Christina's side.
The muffled sound of a television drifted from Elizabeth's room, making me lower my voice to a warning whisper.
"Elizabeth's still here, Sean. You might want to be more careful about flaunting your relationship with Christina."
His expression darkened dangerously. "That's rich, coming from you. Should we discuss your cozy lunch with Nathan last week? Or perhaps your little dance with Christopher?"
"Oh, you're right," I replied, my voice honey-sweet with mockery. "Maybe I should post those moments on Instagram too. I'm sure Elizabeth would love to see everything that's happening in the Shaw family's perfect little world."
The threat in my words was clear-if he could parade his relationship with Christina on social media, two could play at that game.
Just then, Sean's phone started ringing. I rolled my eyes, already turning toward our bedroom. No need to stick around and listen to another intimate conversation with Christina.
"Angela, wait." Sean's voice stopped me. "It's Dr. Carter."
He caught my arm gently, pulling me back. "Listen with me," he said, his tone completely changed. "It must be about Elizabeth."
The earlier hostility between us evaporated instantly, replaced by shared concern for his grandmother. Sean put the phone on speaker as Dr. Carter's voice filled the foyer.
"Mr. Shaw, I need you and Mrs. Shaw to bring Elizabeth in for an examination this week," Dr. Carter's tone was professionally urgent. "We need to reassess and schedule her surgery date."
I watched the tension in Sean's shoulders shift instantly, our personal grievances temporarily overshadowed by concern for Elizabeth. He moved to take the call, but not before fixing me with a look that clearly said our discussion wasn't over.
After my shower, Sean came to the bedroom.
"You're sleeping here tonight?" I asked.
"Where else do you think I should sleep?" he retorted, his face darkening.
"Well, please take a good shower before getting into bed. I'm allergic to Christina's perfume."I said sarcastically.
 Sean suspiciously lowered his head to smell himself, then said, "Stop being so passive-aggressive. Nothing happened between Christina and me, how could I possibly smell like her?"
I just ignored him, falling onto the bed and closing my eyes.
But even with my eyes closed, I could feel him standing by the bed, staring at me angrily. Finally, he let out a sigh and walked into the bathroom.
***
The next morning's chill had settled deep in the underground parking garage of Shaw Tower.
I pulled my oversized down coat tighter around myself as I walked toward my car, conscious of how the loose fabric helped conceal my slowly changing figure. The sound of my heels echoed off concrete walls, creating a lonely symphony in the empty space.
"That's quite a change in style."
Sean's voice startled me. He stood beside his Bentley, his critical gaze taking in my loose-fitting clothes and bulky jacket.
"I wasn't aware I needed your approval for my wardrobe choices," I replied coolly, pressing my key fob to unlock my vehicle.
"You don't." His tone carried an edge of sarcasm. "Though I must say, you've been full of surprises lately. New clothes, new friends, new... priorities."
I turned to face him, feeling anger rise in my chest. "Speaking of priorities, shouldn't you be checking on Christina? I heard there might be scarring."
Sean replied calmly, "It's just a small scar, nothing serious."
His attitude caught me by surprise. I had expected him to be angry with me about Christina's facial scar, or to show more concern for her.
But he didn't seem particularly bothered. I didn't dwell on it though, hurrying off to my office instead.
After a busy morning, I went to the sandwich shop downstairs from the office for lunch as usual.
"What a fortunate coincidence."
Christopher's smooth voice made me turn. He stood there in an impeccably tailored suit, looking every bit the successful Goldman Sachs partner he was.
"I just finished a client meeting nearby," he continued, his amber eyes warm with familiar affection. "Join me for lunch? You still owe me for disrupting my party."
I hesitated, acutely aware of the curious glances from passing finance executives. In our world, every interaction was noted, every lunch meeting analyzed for hidden meanings.
"I really shouldn't," I began, but Christopher was already holding the door open.
"Didn't you say you'd make it up to me?" he said jokingly.
I looked at my watch and agreed, telling him I only had an hour for lunch break.
"One hour," I conceded. "I have meetings this afternoon."
###chapter 69: A Slap for Another Woman's Man
Angela POV
"The Grand?" I asked as Christopher's Mercedes pulled up to the iconic hotel entrance. "Isn't this a bit excessive for a casual lunch?"
Christopher's amber eyes met mine briefly in the rearview mirror, a hint of amusement playing at his lips. "Since when has Angela Wilson ever settled for casual? Besides, I remember how much you used to love their afternoon tea."
I did love it, once. Back before Wilson Investment collapsed. Back when my family name still meant something in this city.
"Things change," I said softly.
"By the way," Christopher said, "how is Christina's injury?"
"You're asking the wrong person," I said coolly. "Maybe you should ask Sean. He's been at the hospital with her."
Christopher's lips curved into a knowing smile. "And here I thought you didn't care about Sean anymore. But your tone suggests otherwise."
We settled at a quiet corner table. I ordered a light salad and some clear soup, avoiding my usual favorites.
"No lobster roll today?" Christopher asked, watching me scan the menu. "You used to love their seafood."
"I'm trying to be more health-conscious these days."
Christopher's eyes narrowed slightly at my response, but he simply nodded and turned to the waiter. "A pot of cinnamon apple tea for the lady, please. And bring us the full afternoon tea service."
"You remember my tea preference?" I asked, surprised.
"I remember everything about you, Angel."
There was something in his tone-a careful observation that made me wonder just how much he'd noticed about my recent changes.
"You know," Christopher began as he poured the steaming liquid with practiced grace, "My company is hiring right now. Someone with your experience would be particularly valuable."
I took a careful sip of tea, using the moment to gather my thoughts. "Are you offering me a job, Christopher?"
"I'm offering you options." His voice was gentle, but his eyes were intent. "The world is bigger than Sean Shaw's shadow, Angela. You're too talented to play the role of trophy wife forever."
The tea suddenly tasted bitter in my mouth. "Is that what you think I am? A trophy wife?"
"I think," Christopher leaned forward slightly, "you're someone who deserves more than being defined by your marriage to Sean Shaw. The Angela I knew would never have settled for such a limited role."
"The Angela you knew didn't have to watch her family's legacy crumble," I replied sharply. "Sometimes we make choices we never thought we'd make."
A flash of regret crossed Christopher's face. "If I had been here when Wilson Investment collapsed-"
"Don't." I cut him off. "We both made our choices, Christopher. You chose London, I chose-"
I smiled slightly. "Can we not talk about this?"
Christopher nodded apologetically. "I just want you to be happier."
"I need to use the restroom," I said with a small nod.
As I walked towards the ladies' room, I noticed Rachel Miller's daughter in the hallway.
The last time I'd seen her was at that discreet clinic. It was her love for her unborn child that had moved me, that had made me change my mind about the abortion.
In a way, her determination had given me the courage to keep my own baby.
Now her face was tear-stained as she argued in hushed but heated tones with a man I recognized as a senior manager from Morgan Stanley.
I slowed my pace, not meaning to eavesdrop but unable to avoid hearing their conversation.
"You can't just pretend this isn't happening," she was saying, her voice trembling. "I'm pregnant, and you-"
"Lower your voice," the man hissed. "This isn't the place for this discussion."
"Then where is the place?" Her voice wavered between anger and desperation. "Your office, where your wife might stop by? Or maybe your house, where your children-"
"I said, be quiet!"
I felt a surge of sympathy for the girl as she continued in a whisper that carried the weight of steel. "You have until tomorrow to decide. Either you help me handle this, or your wife finds out everything."
She turned and walked away quickly, leaving the man standing there. I waited a moment before continuing to the restroom, not wanting him to notice me. When I returned to the table, Christopher was checking his phone.
"Everything alright?" he asked, glancing up. "You were gone a while."
"Just ran into someone I know," I said vaguely, noticing my tea had grown cold.
I hurriedly ate a little of my food, then said to Christopher, "It's getting late. I should head back to the office."
When I tried to get the check, I discovered he had already paid.
"I thought I was treating you to lunch?" I asked.
He smiled. "Next time then. You still owe me a lunch."
I couldn't shake the feeling that he had planned it all-the "chance" encounter downstairs, paying the bill before I could, deliberately creating an opportunity for another lunch.
But why? Could he possibly...?
I shook my head, dismissing the thought.
I was surely overthinking this. How could there ever be anything between Christopher and me?
He was just an old friend, albeit a somewhat annoying one.
Christopher insisted on driving me back to the office. As we walked out of the hotel, a familiar figure caught my eye-Rachel's daughter's boyfriend, that manager, with his arm around a sensual, mature woman.
The rage that bubbled up inside me was sudden and overwhelming. Perhaps it was my own situation that made me particularly sensitive, knowing I too would soon be facing life as a single mother. Without thinking, I strode over to them.
"How dare you!" I slapped him hard across the face, my palm stinging from the impact. "She's pregnant with your child, and here you are with another woman!"
The man stared at me with confusion and anger. "Who are you? I don't even know you!" he snapped. Then he raised his hand to strike me, but Christopher was there in an instant, catching his arm in a grip that made the other man wince.
"I suggest you reconsider that action very carefully," Christopher said, his voice carrying a dangerous edge I'd never heard before. The man struggled briefly before Christopher's grip tightened, forcing him to step back.
After the man and his companion hurried away, Christopher pulled out a silk handkerchief and meticulously wiped his hands.
"You know him?" Christopher asked casually, though his eyes remained sharp.
"He hurt someone I care about," I replied simply. Something in my tone must have told Christopher not to press further.
"I didn't realize you had such a strong aversion to touch," I commented, watching as he disposed of the handkerchief in a nearby bin.
Christopher's lips curved into a slight smile. "Not an aversion to touch in general," he said softly. "Just to touching anyone who isn't you."
The intimate tone of his voice made me uncomfortable, but before I could respond, my phone rang. It was Sean.
"Where are you?" he demanded. "The meeting's about to start and you're nowhere to be found."
"I was out for lunch," I said, keeping my voice steady. "I'm on my way back to the office now."
When Christopher's car finally pulled up to the office building, I saw Sean waiting at the entrance, his expression stormy.
###chapter 70: You Can't Be Too Greedy
Sean POV
I stood at the entrance of Shaw Tower, watching Christopher's Mercedes pull up to the curb. My jaw clenched involuntarily as Angela stepped out, the afternoon sun catching those sapphire earrings I'd given her.
She moved with that characteristic grace of hers, as if the whispers and stares of passing employees meant nothing to her.
"Where have you been?" I couldn't keep the edge from my voice. "The quarterly review meeting starts in ten minutes."
She straightened her coat-that oversized one she'd taken to wearing lately-with deliberate calm. "I was having lunch, as I'm entitled to during my break hour."
"Lunch?" My gaze shifted to Christopher, still seated in his car, watching us with that infuriatingly knowing expression. "With him?"
"Yes, with him." Angela's voice took on that steel edge I knew too well. "I don't believe who I have lunch with is any of your concern. After all, I'm not the one spending nights at the hospital with someone else."
The jab hit its mark. I felt my jaw tighten further, acutely aware of the junior analysts slowing their pace to eavesdrop. Damn it. This wasn't the place for this conversation.
"You're my executive assistant," I lowered my voice to a whisper, though the anger still leaked through. "Your whereabouts during office hours are absolutely my concern."
"I have a one-hour lunch break, as clearly stated in my contract." She met my gaze without flinching. "I haven't violated any company policies. And perhaps you should consider the audience before continuing this discussion."
She was right about the audience-I could see the growing crowd of onlookers, poorly concealing their interest. But seeing Christopher finally emerge from his car, I couldn't stop myself from turning to him.
"Blake," I kept my voice low but threatening. "I suggest you keep your distance from my wife in the future."
Those amber eyes of his held a hint of amusement that made my blood boil. "I wasn't aware lunch between old friends was forbidden territory, Shaw. Unless, of course, there's another reason for your... concern?"
Before I could respond, Angela stepped between us. "We have a meeting to attend," she reminded me coolly. "Shall we maintain some professional decorum?"
Without waiting for my response, she strode into the building. I watched her go, fighting the urge to grab her arm and demand more answers. Christopher's thoughtful smile as he watched us only intensified my anger.
***
Hours later, I sat alone in a corner booth at the Plaza Hotel's bar, an untouched glass of aged scotch before me.
William's arrival shattered my brooding. His designer loafers squeaked slightly against the polished floor as he slid into the booth, with Evan following more sedately behind him.
"The Plaza? Really?" William dropped into the seat across from me, signaling for service.
"William? How did you-" I looked at him in surprise. "I only called Evan." I'd wanted a quiet evening to think things through, but that wasn't going to happen now. William had never been what anyone would call a quiet presence.
"What, do you and Evan have some secret I'm not supposed to know about?" William grinned. "I just came from visiting Christina at the hospital. Her wound still hasn't fully healed. How could Angela do something so vicious? I don't understand how you can put up with that woman-"
"That woman," Evan cut in quietly, "is still Sean's wife."
William scoffed, and I felt my hand tighten around the glass. "In name only. Everyone knows it's just a business arrangement. And after what she did to Christina-"
"What exactly did she do?" Evan's voice remained calm, but I could hear the challenge in it. "Did you actually see it happen?" Evan's voice remained calm, but there was an edge to it. "You were in Christopher's garden that night too, weren't you?"
"I didn't need to be there," William retorted. "Jennifer saw everything. Angela deliberately pushed Christina into that statue. She's always been jealous of Sean and Christina's connection."
"Angela didn't push Christina. She didn't do anything wrong." The words came out before I could stop them.
"Of course it is!" William leaned forward, his voice dropping to an urgent whisper. "Sean, be honest. You've always cared about Christina. Even back in college, everyone knew you two were meant to be together. This marriage to Angela-it was just to please your grandmother, wasn't it?"
I stared out at the glittering cityscape, seeing my own reflection fractured in the window glass. The memory of that day five years ago suddenly surfaced-the moment I'd heard about Wilson Investment's collapse.
"You weren't there," I said finally, "when Wilson Investment collapsed."
William blinked, clearly thrown by what seemed like a change of subject. "What does that have to do with-"
"I was in London," I continued, barely hearing him. "When I heard about the crisis, I took the first flight back. Not for the business opportunity. Not because Grandmother asked. But because..."
I couldn't finish the sentence. The truth of why I'd rushed back from London that day was something I'd never fully admitted, even to myself.
"Because of Angela," Evan completed quietly. "You came back for her."
William stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. "I need some air." He stalked toward the bar's entrance, leaving Evan and me alone with too many unspoken truths hanging between us.
Evan waited until William was out of earshot before speaking again. "You need to be honest with yourself, Sean. About Angela, about Christina-about all of it."
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"It means that I've known you since Yale," he replied steadily. "I was there when you first met Christina. And I was there when you dropped everything to fly back from London the moment you heard about Wilson Investment's troubles."
My jaw tightened. "That was different. The situation-"
"The situation," Evan interrupted gently, "was that you couldn't bear the thought of Angela facing that crisis alone. Not because of business, not because of family obligations, but because even then, she meant more to you than you were willing to admit."
I stayed silent, watching the city lights blur in the window glass. The truth of his words hit too close to home.
"Christina's a convenient distraction," Evan continued, his voice softening. "She represents the simple choice-the path everyone expected you to take. But Angela..." He paused, and I could feel him choosing his words carefully. "Angela challenges you. She makes you question things you'd rather not examine too closely."
"You don't understand," I managed finally, my voice rough. "The expectations, the responsibilities-"
"I understand perfectly," Evan cut in. "I understand that you're letting other people's expectations dictate your choices. I understand that you're using Christina as a shield against feelings you're not ready to face." He leaned back, his expression thoughtful. "What I don't understand is why you're willing to lose something real for the sake of maintaining an illusion."
The ice in my untouched scotch had long since melted, diluting the amber liquid into something weaker than it appeared. Like so many things in my life lately, nothing was quite what it seemed.
"If you can't choose," Evan said quietly, rising from his seat, "then perhaps the kindest thing would be to let Angela go." He placed a hand briefly on my shoulder. "Remember, Sean, a person can't be too greedy in life."
###chapter 71: Jerking Off to Her Picture
Sean POV
I stood in the darkness of our bedroom, watching Angela sleep. She lay curled on her side, and even in the dim light, I could see the traces of dried tears on her cheeks. The sight made something in my chest tighten uncomfortably.
Evan's words from earlier at the Plaza bar kept echoing in my head:
"You can't have it both ways, Sean. You can't keep playing this game with both of them." 
I'd brushed off his concern at the time, but now, watching Angela's troubled sleep, those words carried a different weight.
She seemed different lately-more withdrawn, less energetic.
The Angela I knew would never miss our morning meetings, yet lately she'd been arriving late, looking pale and tired.
Without thinking, I reached out to smooth the worry lines from her forehead. My fingers were still cold from the scotch glass, and the contact made her eyes snap open, immediately alert and wary.
"What are you doing here?" Her voice was rough with sleep but sharp with accusation. "Shouldn't you be at the hospital with Christina?"
I withdrew my hand slowly, noting how she shifted away from my touch. "We need to talk about your lunch with Christopher today."
A bitter laugh escaped her lips as she pushed herself up. "That's rich, coming from you. Did you enjoy your midnight strawberry hunt for Christina? The Instagram post was quite touching."
"Don't deflect. You've been spending an awful lot of time with Christopher since his return." I couldn't keep the edge from my voice. "And let's not forget your cozy conversations with Nathan Harrison."
"Are you having me followed now?" Angela's voice dripped with derision. "How thoughtful of you to take such an interest in my social life, considering you can barely spare a moment away from Christina's hospital bedside."
"This isn't about Christina."
I moved closer, bracing my hands on the bed. "What I want to know is why Christopher Blake suddenly seems to be everywhere you are. The lunch dates, the private conversations, the way his car lingers outside Shaw Tower-"
"Stop." She held up a hand, her voice tight with controlled anger. "This is exactly what you wanted, isn't it? A marriage of convenience, each of us free to pursue our own interests?"
"Is that what Christopher is to you? An 'interest'?"
Before I could stop myself, I closed the distance between us, capturing her lips in a fierce kiss. Angela remained rigid for a moment before shoving me away, her palm connecting sharply with my chest.
"If you're looking for a sex toy, go find Christina!"
I stepped back, her words hitting me like a physical blow.
How could I explain this surge of emotion that had driven me to kiss her?
Every time I imagined her with another man-having lunch with Christopher, smiling at Nathan-something inside me snapped. I'd come here tonight intending to comfort her, to have a real conversation.
How had it turned into another fight?
The silence that followed was deafening. Angela turned away first, lying back down with deliberate casualness.
"We should get some rest. Elizabeth has her hospital appointment tomorrow morning."
I stood there for a long moment, watching as she pulled the covers up and effectively dismissed me.
The familiar scent of her perfume seemed to mock me, reminding me of countless nights when the line between business and pleasure had blurred dangerously.
In my study, I poured another scotch, though the one from the Plaza still sat heavy in my stomach. My phone lit up with a text from Christina, but for once, I ignored it.
Instead, I found myself scrolling through photos of Angela-moments captured over our two years of marriage.
Her laughing with Elizabeth over Sunday brunch,
her concentrated expression during board meetings,
her peaceful face as she dozed against my shoulder during late-night car rides home.
Evan's parting words haunted me: "You need to be honest with yourself, Sean. Could you really watch her build a life with someone else? Because that's where this path leads."
The ache was a living thing now, throbbing in my chest and lower still. I shoved my pants down, boxers too, my cock springing free-hard, leaking already.
I gripped it tight, staring into her frozen eyes as my hand moved, rough and fast. I pictured her beneath me, thighs spread wide, her wet heat swallowing me whole, her moans filling the air.
My balls tightened, sweat beading on my neck as I pumped harder, the photo shaking in my other hand.
Her name slipped out-a hoarse, broken sound-until I came, hot and messy across my fist, the pleasure sharp as a blade, leaving me panting and wrecked in the silence.
When exhaustion finally claimed me, I chose the leather sofa over returning to our bedroom.
Morning arrived with unsettling abruptness, announced by a familiar voice that sent me bolting upright.
"Sean?" My mother's refined tones carried clearly from the foyer. "Why on earth are you sleeping on the sofa?"
I blinked against the morning light, my neck stiff from the awkward position. The sound of Angela's bedroom door opening down the hall told me this morning's performance was about to begin-another carefully choreographed dance of pretending our marriage was everything it appeared to be.
"Why did you suddenly come back?" I asked, straightening my rumpled shirt and studying my mother's face carefully. Something about her unexpected appearance made me uneasy.
"Can't a mother visit her son without a reason?" Victoria replied smoothly, but I caught the calculating look in her eyes as she glanced toward the master bedroom.
"I thought we could all have breakfast together. You, me, Angela... and perhaps you can explain why my son is sleeping on the sofa instead of in his bed."
###chapter 72: Who Keeps Calling You?
Sean POV
"Victoria." Angela's voice was warm, though I caught the slight tension in her shoulders. "What a lovely surprise."
"Darling." My mother moved to embrace Angela, shooting me a disapproving look over her shoulder. "I hope my son hasn't been making things difficult for you."
Before Angela could respond, the sound of a door opening down the hall drew our attention. Elizabeth appeared, her silver hair perfectly coiffed despite the early hour.
"Victoria!" Elizabeth's face lit up. "Alexander called to say you were both coming, but I hardly dared believe it."
"Mother." I cut in, studying her face carefully. "Why did you suddenly return from Europe?"
"Can't parents visit their son without an interrogation?" Victoria's tone was light, but her eyes were sharp as she glanced between Angela and me.
"I thought we could all have breakfast together. Though I must say, Sean, if you've done something to make Angela kick you out of bed, you should have had the decency to sleep on the floor, not the expensive Italian leather."
Angela stepped forward, her professional mask firmly in place. "It's not what you think, Victoria. Sean was just-"
"Working late," I finished quickly. "I didn't want to disturb anyone."
"How considerate." My mother's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Though I seem to recall you having no such concerns when you were living at home. The number of times you stumbled in at dawn..."
"Victoria," Elizabeth interrupted gently, "shall we have breakfast? Sarah has prepared your favorite croissants."
As we settled around the dining table, I couldn't help but notice how naturally Angela fit into this tableau of Shaw family domesticity.
She moved with easy grace, ensuring Elizabeth's tea was exactly how she liked it, engaging Victoria in conversation about her latest charitable endeavors in Europe.
"I'm sorry I've been away so long," Victoria said to Elizabeth, genuine regret in her voice. "The foundation's new projects have been all-consuming."
"Don't apologize," Elizabeth smiled. "Angela has been taking wonderful care of me. Such a thoughtful girl-always remembering my medications, accompanying me to every doctor's appointment."
I watched as my mother's expression softened, noting how she reached out to squeeze Angela's hand. The gesture sent a wave of guilt washing over me.
All this time, I'd been so focused on maintaining the facade of our arrangement that I'd failed to see the reality: Angela wasn't playing a role.
She was genuinely caring for my family, filling gaps I hadn't even noticed existed. The realization made my throat tight with shame.
How many of her quiet acts of kindness had I dismissed or taken for granted?
***
The drive to the hospital should have taken thirty minutes. In the tense silence of the Bentley's interior, it felt like hours.
My parents had taken Elizabeth in their car, leaving Angela and me alone.
As soon as we pulled away from the curb, Angela's warm demeanor vanished. She sat rigid in the passenger seat, staring straight ahead, her hands folded tightly in her lap.
"Angela-" I started, but she cut me off.
"Don't." Her voice was ice. "Let's just get through this morning."
Something in her tone made my hands tighten on the steering wheel. The familiar surge of frustration rose in my chest-the same feeling that had driven me to kiss her last night, only to be pushed away. Without thinking, I pressed harder on the accelerator.
The screech of tires came with barely any warning. A delivery truck appeared around the corner, its horn blaring as I swerved sharply to avoid it. Angela's gasp cut through the air like a knife.
I pulled over immediately, my heart hammering. "Are you alright?"
When I turned to look at her, I saw tears sliding down her cheeks. The sight hit me like a physical blow. Angela Wilson Shaw didn't cry-not when her family's company collapsed, not during our countless arguments, not even last night when I'd crossed a line.
"Angela, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have-" I reached for her, but she flinched away.
"Don't touch me." Her voice broke slightly. "Just... don't."
She opened the door and stepped out onto the sidewalk, leaving me alone with the weight of my mistakes. Through the windshield, I watched her pace slowly, one hand pressed against her stomach as if she felt ill.
The gesture triggered a memory from two months ago-another morning, another car ride.
She'd been laughing then, her head thrown back against the seat as I told her about William's latest romantic disaster.
When I'd reached over to brush a strand of hair from her face, she hadn't pulled away. Instead, she'd caught my hand, pressing a kiss to my palm that sent electricity shooting through my veins.
What had changed since then? When had we lost that easy intimacy?
Angela returned to the car after a few minutes, her composure restored.
We drove the rest of the way in silence, but I couldn't shake the image of her tears, or the growing certainty that I was somehow losing something precious without understanding exactly what it was.
***
When we arrived at Presbyterian Hospital, I hurried around to Angela's side before she could open her door.
I offered my hand and she took it, allowing me to help her from the car.
Then, driven by an impulse I couldn't quite name, I slipped my arm around her shoulders as we walked toward the entrance. Her body tensed slightly at the contact, but she didn't pull away.
We found my parents already waiting in the VIP wing. Elizabeth was being prepped for her tests, leaving us to wait in the pristine corridor.
My phone vibrated in my pocket. Christina's name flashed across the screen, and I quickly hit decline, hoping no one had noticed. Minutes later, it buzzed again. Another call from Christina. Again, I ended it without answering.
When her name appeared for the third time, I felt a bead of sweat form at my temple as I terminated the call. Glancing up guiltily, I found Angela standing with her arms crossed tightly over her chest, deliberately looking anywhere but at me. My mother, however, fixed me with that penetrating stare I remembered from childhood interrogations.
"Who keeps calling you?" Victoria's voice was deceptively casual. "And why aren't you answering?"
"I asked you a question, Sean." Victoria's voice took on that dangerous sweetness I remembered from childhood scoldings. The silence that followed felt heavy with unspoken accusations, but before I could respond, Dr. Carter appeared.
His expression was professionally neutral as he approached our group. "Mrs. Shaw is ready for her consultation. Would you all follow me, please?"
###chapter 73: Revenge in White Silk
Christina POV
I stared at my phone in disbelief, my finger hovering over Sean's number for the fourth time. Three calls. Three rejections. The sharp ache in my chest had nothing to do with my injury.
Sean Shaw never ignored my calls. Never.
I pushed myself up against the silk pillows of my VIP hospital bed, wincing as the movement pulled at my bandaged forehead. My gaze drifted to the mirror on the opposite wall, and I found myself studying my reflection with growing anxiety. Dr. Carter's words echoed in my mind: "There might be permanent scarring."
"I can't believe he actually hung up on you." Jennifer's voice dripped with calculated sympathy as she settled into one of the plush chairs beside my bed. "But then again, have you seen how cozy Angela's been getting with Christopher Blake? They were having lunch at The Grand just today."
My fingers tightened around the phone. "The Grand?"
"Mmhmm." Jennifer took a delicate sip of mineral water, her eyes watching me over the crystal rim. "And that's not all. Haven't you noticed something strange about Elizabeth's surgery schedule? It keeps getting pushed back and back..."
I turned to look at my friend, my eyes narrowing. "You think Angela is deliberately delaying Elizabeth's surgery?"
The thought sent ice through my veins. It would be just like that calculating little gold-digger to pull something like this.
The late afternoon sun painted my hospital room in shades of gold, casting long shadows across the expensive furnishings. I was about to respond when a commotion outside my door drew our attention.
"Miss Jordan?" A flustered nurse appeared in the doorway. "There's a young man downstairs insisting on seeing you. He says his name is Mike?"
My initial reaction was to refuse. Mike was a nobody-a street thug who'd developed an inconvenient fixation on me after a chance encounter at a charity event.
I had to admit, he was handsome in that dangerous, rough-around-the-edges way. One night, after too much champagne at some forgettable fundraiser, I'd let my guard down.
We had sex in his apartment in some questionable part of town. I'd made him swear to keep it our secret. What was he doing here now?
He wasn't supposed to show up like this, especially where there was any chance Sean might find out about his existence.
But I needed to know what he wanted. After a moment's consideration, I decided to see him.
"Let him up," I said, ignoring Jennifer's look of shock.
"Christina!" Jennifer hissed. "You can't be serious. He's... he's..."
"A concerned friend," I cut her off smoothly, already adjusting my designer hospital gown to look more vulnerable. "Please, Jennifer. Stay with me while I receive him?"
I used the few minutes before Mike's arrival to perfect my pose. The bandage needed to catch the light just so, highlighting the injury without being too obvious about it.
When Mike burst through the door, it was like watching a bull crash into a china shop.
His knockoff designer clothes and rough manners couldn't have been more out of place in my refined hospital suite.
The bouquet of roses in his hands looked like they'd been bought from a street vendor-cheap and gaudy against the elegant flower arrangements already filling my room.
"Miss Jordan!" His voice was too loud, making me wince internally. "I heard what happened. I came as soon as I could."
I managed a weak smile, carefully angling my face. "Mike, you shouldn't have..."
"Who did this to you?" His fists clenched at his sides, his street-hardened face darkening with anger. Perfect.
I caught Jennifer's perfectly plucked eyebrows arching as she took in Mike's appearance. "My, my. What... interesting company you keep, Christina darling."
I noticed how Mike's jaw tightened at Jennifer's tone, how his eyes narrowed at the obvious dismissal in her voice. The tension in the room was exactly what I needed.
"Jennifer," I made my voice hold just the right note of gentle reproach. "Mike was kind enough to visit me."
The way Mike's expression softened as he looked at me was almost pathetic. His obvious adoration made Jennifer roll her eyes behind his back, but I had to fight to suppress a smile. Everything was falling into place.
"It must have been terrifying," Mike said, stepping closer to my bed. "Being attacked like that..."
"Oh, I wouldn't say attacked," I demurred, then winced theatrically. "It was just... well..."
"Just Angela Shaw shoving her into a marble statue," Jennifer finished sharply. "And now look-there might be permanent scarring. All because that gold-digger couldn't handle seeing Christina with Sean."
Mike's expression grew thunderous. "She did what?"
I touched my bandage gently, letting my hand tremble slightly. "Please, it's nothing. I'm sure she didn't mean to-"
"Like hell she didn't!" Mike's voice rose dangerously. "In my neighborhood, we know how to handle people who think they can get away with hurting others."
"Miss Jordan," Mike's voice had dropped to a dangerous growl. "Where I come from, we have ways of dealing with this kind of thing. Nobody hurts someone I care about and gets away with it."
I reached out, letting my fingers brush against his sleeve. The cheap fabric made my skin crawl, but I forced myself to maintain contact. "You're sweet to want to protect me, but please... I couldn't bear it if you got into trouble."
The look he gave me was filled with such fierce devotion it almost made me laugh. Instead, I let my eyes fill with tears.
"I just... I never thought someone could be so cruel," I whispered, my voice breaking just enough. "And now, my face..."
Mike's expression hardened with resolve. "Don't worry, Miss Jordan. I'll make sure she learns her lesson. Nobody's gonna hurt you again."
As he turned to leave, I caught his sleeve. "Mike, please," I said softly. "I tried to tell you... you shouldn't do anything reckless..."
"Christina," Jennifer cut in sharply before Mike could respond. "You're too kind-hearted. That woman hurt you, and now there might be permanent scarring. Someone needs to teach her a lesson." Her eyes glittered with malice as she looked at Mike. "If you want to be her knight in shining armor, why should she stop you?"
After Mike stormed out, I gazed out the window at the setting sun. "I have no idea what you mean, Jennifer. I simply received a concerned friend's visit." My lips curved into an innocent smile, but my mind was already several steps ahead.
The shadows lengthened across my hospital room floor, and I closed my eyes, exhausted by the day's events.
###chapter 74: The Impact Came Without Warning
Angela POV
Dr. Carter's words from this morning's appointment still rang in my ears: Elizabeth's condition had improved enough to schedule the surgery for this weekend.
It was the news we'd all been waiting for, though I couldn't help but notice how Sean's shoulders had tensed at the announcement.
Alexander needed to return to Europe first to handle some urgent foundation business, but Victoria had decided to stay and help take care of Elizabeth. Her presence would likely bring some peace to our household in the coming days.
After leaving the hospital, Victoria took Elizabeth home while Sean and I returned to the office.
I glanced at my watch as I finished reviewing the last quarterly report. The afternoon sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Shaw Tower, and I found myself craving something sweet.
The doctor had warned me to limit my sugar intake during the pregnancy, but I'd made a deal with myself - one small piece of cake each day.
The bakery downstairs had become my guilty pleasure, their hazelnut chocolate cake worth every calorie.
Standing up from my desk, I smoothed down my oversized blazer - a recent wardrobe addition to conceal my slowly changing figure.
The street outside Shaw Tower bustled with the usual midday crowd. I waited for the crossing signal, adjusting my wool scarf against the winter wind.
The impact came without warning.
One moment I was standing at the crosswalk, the next I was stumbling forward as something-someone-slammed into me from behind.
Even in my comfortable sneakers, the force of his impact was too strong, and I couldn't maintain my balance. I fell forward, my hands instinctively moving to protect my stomach as I fell.
The pavement was rough against my palms as I caught myself, my heart pounding with both fear and fury. "What do you think you're-"
The words died in my throat as a large hand wrapped around my wrist, squeezing with deliberate cruelty as it yanked me upward.
"Watch where you're going, miss." The man's voice was slurred with affected drunkenness, but the anger in his eyes was unmistakably clear and intense as they locked onto mine.
Something about him seemed strangely familiar. I had a nagging feeling that I'd seen him somewhere before, but I couldn't quite place where.
Anger surged through me as I stood up, my voice sharp with indignation. "You were the one who crashed into me! You should be the one apologizing!"
His response was to grab my wrist, his grip tightening painfully. "This is a dangerous city," he said in a low voice. "All sorts of accidents can happen to pretty ladies who aren't careful."
The threat in his words was unmistakable. I tried to pull away, but his fingers only dug deeper into my flesh. Perhaps it was his intimidating build that kept others at bay - no one dared to intervene, choosing instead to hurry past us.
"I believe the lady would like you to let go." The new voice was calm but carried an edge of authority. Michael Smith, Sean's assistant, stood a few feet away, his expression neutral but his stance ready for confrontation.
The man released my wrist with exaggerated care. "Just trying to help a lady who took a fall," he said, his mock-innocent tone making my skin crawl. "No harm meant."
But as he turned to leave, he leaned close enough for only me to hear his final whisper: "Better be careful in your condition. Wouldn't want anything to happen to the little one, would we?"
I felt the world tilt beneath my feet. The casual mention of my pregnancy, delivered with such calculated menace, sent a chill down my spine.
This was no random encounter-someone had been watching me, following my movements, even tracking my doctor's appointments.
"Angela?" Michael's voice seemed to come from very far away. "Should I call security?"
I forced myself to breathe, to think past the panic clawing at my throat. I shook my head. "No need."
Back in my private office, I examined my wrist in the afternoon light. My palms were scraped and raw from the fall.
My phone buzzed with an incoming call from Sophie.
I told her about what had just happened - the collision, the threat, the way he knew about my pregnancy.
"Oh my god, Ang!" Sophie's voice rose with alarm. "We need to call the police right now!"
"And tell them what?" I touched my scraped palms. "That someone accidentally bumped into me at a crosswalk? They won't find anything."
"This wasn't just some random accident," Sophie insisted. "Look, I'll do some digging, try to find out who this guy is. But right now, the most important thing is keeping you and the baby safe."
She paused for a moment. "The person who can protect you best is actually right there with you."
I knew she meant Sean.
"He's still your husband," Sophie pressed. "And whatever game he's playing with Christina, he wouldn't let anyone hurt you. Not like this."
I considered her words, remembering the flash of genuine concern I'd sometimes catch in Sean's eyes, the way his touch would linger just a moment too long when our hands brushed in passing.
"Maybe you're right," I conceded. "But approaching him means admitting weakness."
"Better to appear weak than end up hurt-or worse." Sophie's voice softened. "Promise me you'll at least think about it?"
After hanging up, I stood at my office window, watching the sun sink behind Manhattan's gleaming towers.
A knock at my door made me turn. Emily stood there, looking apologetic. "Mr. Shaw is asking for the Morrison portfolio."
I glanced at the clock-nearly six. Usually, I would have Michael deliver any late files, maintaining the professional distance Sean and I had cultivated. But Sophie's words echoed in my mind, mixing with the phantom ache in my wrist.
"I'll take it to him myself," I decided.
Sean was at his desk when I entered, his tie loosened, sleeves rolled up as he studied something on his laptop.
He looked up at my entrance, surprise flickering across his features.
"The Morrison portfolio," I said, placing the file on his desk. I turned to leave but hesitated at the door. "Sean..."
"Yes?" There was something in his tone-expectation? hope?-that made my heart skip.
"Would you..." I took a deep breath. "Would you mind if I rode home with you tonight?"
###chapter 75: Wounds and Whispers
Angela POV
His eyes narrowed slightly, studying my face with the intensity he usually reserved for complex business deals.
"Is everything alright?"
"I'm just tired," I lied smoothly. "It's been a long day. And with Victoria back... I think we should try to appear more..."
I added softly, before he could respond. "united. At least in front of the family."
Something shifted in Sean's expression - a softening around the eyes that I hadn't seen in weeks.
"Of course, you're right about Victoria. She's always been particularly... perceptive."
I managed a small smile, grateful he'd understood without further explanation. "Thank you. I know it's short notice, but-"
Before I could finish, Sean's expression changed suddenly, his eyes fixed on my hand where I'd unconsciously gripped the edge of his desk.
"You're hurt." His voice carried a sharp edge of concern as he rose from his chair.
I tried to pull my hand back, but he was faster, catching my wrist with surprising gentleness. His fingers were warm against my skin as he turned my palm upward, revealing the raw scrapes.
"It's nothing," I said quickly. "I just... took a small fall earlier."
"A fall?" Sean's thumb traced the edge of my palm, careful to avoid the abraded skin. "These look fresh. When did this happen?"
"This afternoon. Really, Sean, it's fine-"
But he was already reaching for his phone. "Michael," he said when his assistant answered, "bring up the first aid kit from the medical office. And some ice."
"You don't need to-"
"Sit." His tone brooked no argument as he guided me to the leather sofa near the window. The city lights were beginning to twinkle to life beyond the glass, Manhattan preparing for its nightly transformation.
Michael appeared moments later with a well-equipped medical kit and an ice pack. Sean dismissed him with a nod, then settled beside me on the sofa, opening the kit with practiced efficiency.
"This might sting," he warned, holding an antiseptic wipe. His touch was surprisingly gentle as he cleaned the scrapes, his breath warm against my skin as he bent over his task.
"Remember when you used to patch me up after hockey practice?" he asked, his voice soft with memory. "Junior year, that championship game against Westbrook?"
I did remember. Sean had taken a brutal check into the boards, emerging with a split lip and a fierce grin of triumph. I'd been the one to clean him up afterward, lecturing him about unnecessary risks while he just smiled that infuriating, blood-stained smile.
"You were always too reckless," I murmured, watching as he carefully applied antibiotic ointment to my palms.
"And you were always there to put me back together." His fingers lingered on my wrist, just above where the mystery attacker had grabbed me. "Angela..."
The softness in his voice made me look up, finding his face much closer than I'd expected.
The office lights caught the green of his eyes, reminding me of summer storms over the Atlantic.
For a moment, I could almost forget the complications between us-Christina, the marriage contract, the baby I still couldn't tell him about.
His free hand came up to cup my cheek, and I felt myself leaning into the touch despite every rational argument against it. His thumb brushed across my lower lip, and I knew with absolute certainty that he was going to kiss me.
The sharp trill of his phone shattered the moment.
Christina's name flashed across the screen, and reality came crashing back. I pulled away, gathering the scattered pieces of my composure as Sean stared at the phone with an unreadable expression.
"You should answer that," I said, standing perhaps too quickly. "Your girlfriend might need something urgent."
"Angela-"
"Thank you for the first aid." I managed a smile that felt brittle even to me. "Shall we head home? Victoria will be expecting us for dinner."
The ride down in the private elevator was silent, the tension from our almost-kiss still crackling in the air.
Sean stood closer than strictly necessary, his shoulder occasionally brushing mine as the car descended.
Each point of contact sent little sparks of awareness through me, making it hard to maintain my careful mask of indifference.
When his phone rang for the third time, Sean finally answered it. Christina's voice, thick with tears, carried clearly in the confined space of the elevator.
"Sean... where have you been? I've been trying to reach you..." Her voice trembled with carefully crafted vulnerability. "The doctor says the scar might be permanent..."
I tuned out her words, my mind suddenly catching on a detail that had been nagging at me all afternoon. The man who'd attacked me at the crosswalk-why had he seemed so familiar?
Then it hit me with the force of a physical blow.
I'd seen him before, at Christina's party！
He had been part of the security detail, wearing an earpiece and watching the crowd with those same cold, calculating eyes. I distinctly remembered him escorting Christina home at the end of the night.
My blood ran cold as the pieces started falling into place.
###chapter 76: Christina Is Missing！
Angela POV
"Angela?" Sean's voice was tentative as he ended the call. We were still in the elevator, and I could feel his eyes studying my face.
"You look pale. Are you feeling alright?"
I managed a small nod, though my scraped palms still stung beneath their bandages. Before I could respond, Sean cleared his throat, a hint of apology in his voice.
"About Christina... she's still in the hospital, so I need to-"
"You don't need to explain," I cut him off, forcing a smile that felt brittle even to me.
Looking at his concerned expression, I made a decision. I wouldn't tell him about the attack, or my suspicions about Christina's possible involvement.
Without concrete evidence, he would never believe me. He loved Christina too much to even consider she might be capable of such things.
The drive home was quiet, Manhattan's evening traffic creating a cocoon of silence around us. His earlier tenderness in the office already felt like a fading dream, dissolving like mist in the harsh light of reality.
The next few days fell into a pattern.
Sean insisted on driving me to and from work, his protective instincts apparently triggered by my scraped hands though he never pressed for details about my "fall."
No more mysterious men appeared, no more threats were made. Perhaps I had been overly paranoid. Maybe the man had only meant to frighten me, not cause real harm.
I gradually let my guard down, though I couldn't quite shake the memory of his knowing words about my pregnancy. Still, life went on.
Until Friday arrived, and with it, Elizabeth's surgery. As I stood in her hospital room that morning, all other concerns faded away. Nothing mattered now except getting her through this.
***
Elizabeth lay propped against pristine pillows, her silver hair perfectly coiffed despite the early hour.
I couldn't stop myself from adjusting her blankets for the third time.
"You're fussing, dear," Elizabeth said fondly, reaching for my hand. Her grip was warm and reassuring despite her condition.
Victoria watched us from her position by the window, a gentle smile playing at her lips. In moments like these, I could almost forget the complexity of my position in the Shaw family.
"Angela," Elizabeth's voice carried that gentle authority I'd grown to love, "you look pale. Have you been taking care of yourself?"
I opened my mouth to reassure her, but Dr. Carter's appearance in the doorway cut me off. "Mrs. Shaw? It's time."
I couldn't make myself let go of Elizabeth's hand, even as the surgical team assembled around us.
Then Sean's arm slipped around my waist, strong and steady, helping me find the strength to step back.
"Everything will be fine, dear," Elizabeth assured me as they prepared to wheel her through the surgical doors. "Take care of each other while I'm sleeping, won't you?"
I could only nod, my throat too tight for words. Sean's arm tightened around my waist as we watched the doors close behind her.
The private waiting area of New York-Presbyterian's VIP surgical wing offered every luxury money could buy, but nothing could ease the weight of waiting.
I stood at the floor-to-ceiling windows, my forehead pressed against the cool glass as I watched the city below.
Sean remained close, one hand resting lightly on the small of my back.
When Sean's phone buzzed for the third time in an hour, Victoria's perfectly manicured fingers drummed against the armrest.
"Perhaps,you should put that on silent, Sean."
He complied without argument, though I felt him tense slightly beside me. The surgical wing's indicator light glowed steadily, marking the hours as they passed.
"You're shivering," Sean murmured, shrugging off his suit jacket and draping it over my shoulders. The fabric carried his warmth and familiar scent, and I found myself unconsciously leaning into it.
"Thank you," I whispered, both for the jacket and the steady presence beside me. His hand found mine again, our fingers intertwining with practiced ease.
The quiet moment shattered as Sean's phone lit up again, this time with rapid-fire text messages. Though he tried to angle the screen away, I caught glimpses of Christina's name and increasingly urgent messages.
Victoria angrily asked, "Who keeps calling you?"
Before Sean could respond, another message appeared-this one from Jennifer: Christina left the hospital. She's upset and no one knows where she went. Her injury started bleeding again.
I felt Sean's grip tighten on my hand, saw the conflict etched across his features. Drawing a deep breath, I made a decision that surprised even myself.
"Sean," I said softly, extracting my hand from his. "You should go check on her."
His head snapped up, eyes searching my face. "Angela-"
"She's injured and potentially in danger," I continued, forcing my voice to remain steady.
Even though I suspected she might be behind my attack, I could understand how devastating it would be for a young, beautiful woman to have a scar on her face.
People might do foolish things when acting impulsively. Just like Christina right now.
"However, before you leave, you should explain things to Victoria," I added.
###chapter 77: Watching Your Husband Rush Off to Another Woman?
Angela POV
Sean approached Victoria and Alexander in the waiting area, his expression determined despite his mother's obvious displeasure. Looking at his parents, he said, "I need to go out for a while."
"You're leaving?" Victoria's voice carried despite her attempt to keep it low. "Now? When your grandmother is about to have heart surgery?"
"Are you going to see that woman?" Victoria's tone sharpened as she glanced at me. "I saw her Instagram post, you know. The one with you bringing her strawberries in the middle of the night. Did you think you could hide everything from me?"
Sean remained silent for a moment, accepting the criticism. "Christina's missing. She's injured and emotionally unstable. I need to help find her."
"Of course." Victoria's tone turned icy. "It's always about Christina, isn't it? Don't forget that Angela is your wife."
I felt grateful for Victoria's defense, though she didn't know the truth - that I wouldn't be his wife much longer... She turned to me, disbelief evident in her expression. "Angela, surely you can't approve of this?"
"Christina's injured and potentially in danger," I said quietly. "Sean should help look for her."
"How magnanimous of you," Victoria replied sarcastically, "to be so understanding about your husband running off to another woman at a time like this."
I felt heat rise in my cheeks but maintained my composure. Sean stepped forward, his voice taking on an edge. "Christina might have a permanent scar. She's not thinking clearly-"
"And whose fault is that?" Victoria demanded, though her expression softened slightly at the mention of scarring. She pressed her lips together, leaving the rest unsaid.
The weight of Christina's status as Sean's "savior" hung in the air, the yacht party incident years ago having left the Shaw family eternally in her debt.
"Go," Alexander said quietly, placing a hand on his wife's arm. "But make sure you're back before the surgery is over."
Sean nodded and started toward the elevator. I began to remove his jacket, but he stopped me.
"Keep it on," he insisted. "I don't feel cold, and you need it more than I do."
With one last glance back, he added, "I'll be back soon."
His concern only makes it worse. If he were colder, maybe after the divorce, I could move on from this broken marriage more easily. But the little gestures of care he throws my way only leave me more tangled up, more in pain. Isn't that a kind of cruelty too?
But Sean-he'll never get it.
Victoria moved to stand beside me after he left. "Doesn't it hurt?" she asked softly. "Watching your husband rush off to another woman? Angela, you're either very kind, or very foolish!"
"He's just looking for someone who's injured," I replied, the words tasting bitter.
"Oh, darling." Victoria's laugh held no humor. "A wife doesn't always have to be so understanding. Sometimes a little jealousy lets a man know you care."
Alexander spoke up gently, "I trust Sean's character. He would never do anything to hurt Angela. If he ever did, I would teach him a severe lesson!" After a pause, his expression softening with paternal concern, he added, "I'll have my assistant bring some fruit for you both. You need to relax a little."
I watched as Alexander brought Victoria her tea, his affection evident in every small gesture. Their easy intimacy after decades of marriage made my chest ache with longing.
I envied Victoria deeply. Her marriage was everything I'd once dreamed of having. But my own parents' marriage had been far from happy - perhaps unhappiness in marriage ran in families, like some cruel inheritance. Was that why I couldn't seem to find happiness in my own marriage? Maybe I simply wasn't meant for that kind of love.
A wave of nausea hit suddenly, reminding me I'd barely touched breakfast. The hospital's smell made me feel uncomfortable.
"I need to use the restroom," I said, stepping away from Victoria's perceptive gaze.
"Would you like me to come with you?" Victoria asked, starting to rise.
"Please don't trouble yourself," I added quickly. "I'll only be a moment."
The hallway seemed oddly quiet as I walked, making the normally pristine corridor feel ominous. Despite the stuffiness inside, the winter wind whistling past the windows suggested Manhattan was about to get its first real snowfall of February.
Lost in thought, I almost missed it-the sound of footsteps behind me, too measured to be casual. The same feeling of being watched that had plagued me during the attack at the crosswalk a few days ago returned full force.
I turned, but too late. Strong hands grabbed me from behind, one covering my mouth while the other pressed something sweet-smelling against my nose. The world began to spin, and my last coherent thought was of the jacket still draped over my shoulders.
Then everything went black.
###chapter 78: Kidnap
Angela POV
Consciousness returned slowly, like wading through thick fog.
The first thing I registered was cold-a deep, bone-chilling cold that seemed to seep through my clothes.
Then came the awareness of restraints around my wrists and ankles, professional-grade zip ties cutting into my skin.
My head throbbed, the lingering effects of chloroform making the dim room spin slightly. As my vision cleared, I took in my surroundings: sleek steel storage units lined the walls, their high-security locks gleaming dully in the half-light.
Stay calm, I told myself, fighting down the surge of panic as I thought of my unborn child.
The doctor's warnings about stress during the first trimester echoed in my mind.
"Finally awake?" The voice came from behind me, followed by deliberate footsteps. "I was starting to worry I'd used too much chloroform."
I recognized him instantly-the same man who'd threatened me at the crosswalk, who I'd seen working security at Christina's parties.
As I watched him, the pieces suddenly clicked into place. Christina's dramatic disappearance from the hospital, the timing of it all-it wasn't just about luring Sean away. She was crafting herself a perfect alibi.
He moved into my field of vision, carrying a designer travel bag that looked jarringly out of place against his knockoff suit.
The bag's presence sent a chill down my spine-what exactly did he have planned?
"If you promise not to scream," he said, studying my face, "I'll remove the tape."
I nodded slowly, maintaining eye contact. When he peeled the tape away, I didn't give him the satisfaction of wincing at the sting.
"I've seen you before," I said quietly, watching his reaction. "Not just from when you pushed me the other day. Years ago, at one of Christina's evening parties." I paused deliberately, as if searching my memory.
 "Your name is... Mike, isn't it?"
His eyes widened slightly, a flash of surprise crossing his face before he could mask it.
"You remember me？" It wasn't a question. His tone carried a mix of surprise and something else-satisfaction?
"Mike," I said, keeping my voice steady. "You worked security at Christina's summer garden party. And the New Year's Eve celebration at the Plaza."
A flicker of emotion crossed his face-pleasure at being remembered, quickly masked by determination. "Then you know why I'm doing this."
"Because Christina asked you to?" I watched his expression carefully. "Or did she just manipulate you into thinking this was your idea?"
His hand shot out, gripping my chin. "Don't talk about her like that. You're the one who pushed her into that statue, who tried to ruin her face-"
"Is that what she told you?" I met his gaze steadily. "Did she mention that she orchestrated that entire scene? That her friend Jennifer was the one who attacked me first?"
"Shut up!" But I caught the momentary doubt in his eyes. "You rich people are all the same-thinking you can twist everything to suit your narrative."
"I know more about you than you might think," I said carefully. "Would you like to know why I remember you?"
Mike's expression shifted, curiosity warring with his attempt to maintain control. "Why?" His lips curved into a forced smirk. "Don't tell me it's because I'm so handsome."
"I don't find that joke amusing at all," I replied quietly.
"That night, at Christina's party, there was a woman whose dress was torn by a stray cat. The dress was worth a hundred thousand dollars. She insisted on having the cat killed right there and then."
 I watched his face carefully as recognition dawned. "But you stopped her. You even adopted the cat afterward, despite her threats to have you fired."
Mike's practiced sneer faltered, genuine emotion flickering across his features.
"That's why I believe there's goodness in you," I continued softly. "In that moment, you showed more nobility than any of the wealthy people present. You chose to protect a helpless creature, regardless of the cost to yourself."
I pressed, ignoring the way his fingers dug into my jaw. "Tell me, Mike, did she promise you something? A better position? A chance at that society life you've been watching from the sidelines?"
Mike let go of my chin, stood up, stepped back a few paces, and then pulled out his phone to check it.
The confidence he'd shown earlier was crumbling. His fingers kept fidgeting with his collar as if his tie was suddenly too tight.
Each time he glanced in my direction, the conflict in his eyes grew more obvious. The mask of the hardened criminal was slipping, revealing the man who'd once risked his job to save a stray cat.
"Stop trying to manipulate me!" But I could hear the uncertainty creeping into his voice.
"I'm not manipulating you, Mike. I'm trying to save you from being manipulated." I softened my tone.
His silence told me I'd hit the mark.
"But here's what you don't know," I continued carefully. "Christina isn't acting out of some misguided sense of justice. She's scared. Because I know something that could ruin her perfect plan-something that would make Sean choose me over her without hesitation."
Mike's head snapped around. "What are you talking about?"
Before I could answer, a sharp knock echoed through the storage unit. We both froze, listening to footsteps approaching from the corridor outside.
The warehouse door suddenly slammed hard.
"Mike, don't listen to her. She's lying."
A familiar voice shouted from outside.
###chapter 79: Will He Answer My Call?
Angela POV
The warehouse door swung open, and Jennifer's slim figure appeared in the doorway.
Her eyes scanned the space until they found me-bound and disheveled on the concrete floor. Her lips curved into a smile of pure satisfaction, one that made my skin crawl.
"Angela Wilson," she said, drawing out each syllable with malicious pleasure. "Look at you now."
The cold of the concrete floor seeped through my clothes, but I focused on remaining calm. My baby needed me to stay strong.
"What are you doing here?"Mike closed the door behind Jennifer, his expression darkening.
"What do you mean, what am I doing here? If I hadn't come, were you planning to let Christina's attacker go free?"Jennifer turned to him, perfect eyebrows arched in surprise.
Mike's jaw tightened visibly. "This has nothing to do with you."
"Nothing to do with me?" Jennifer laughed. "I'm Christina's best friend. If you're avenging her, why shouldn't I be part of it?"
"If you want to avenge her, do it yourself," Mike snapped. "Don't use me as your tool. Now get out."
"Get out?" Jennifer's voice rose in pitch. "That's not happening."
Before either Mike or I could react, Jennifer strode over and delivered a sharp kick to my legs.
Pain shot through my body, and though I bit my lip to keep from crying out, tears sprang to my eyes involuntarily.
I wasn't concerned about the pain in my leg-my only thought was for my baby. Please be okay, please be okay, I repeated silently, curling protectively as much as my restraints would allow.
"Are you insane?" Mike shouted, lunging forward to grab Jennifer before she could strike again. He yanked her backward with enough force to make her stumble. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"
"What's wrong with you?" Jennifer spat, struggling against his grip. "You've gone soft, haven't you? She's right here-the woman who scarred Christina for life-and you're just standing around doing nothing!"
"This isn't what I agreed to," Mike growled, maintaining his hold on her.
Jennifer's eyes narrowed. "Wait a minute. You're not actually developing feelings for her, are you? Is that it? You think she's pretty, so you're having second thoughts?"
She turned toward me, her face twisted with hatred. "You're just a natural-born slut, aren't you? Always seducing men wherever you go! Maybe I should call a few guys over right now to satisfy you!"
"Don't be ridiculous," Mike said, releasing her with disgust. "I'm doing this for Christina. Only for her."
"Prove it," Jennifer challenged, straightening her designer clothes with quick, angry movements. "You always said you'd make anyone who hurt Christina pay tenfold. Well, here's your chance. She's right in front of you. What are you waiting for?"
Mike fell silent, his gaze shifting to me. I could see the conflict on his face-the desire to please Christina warring with his own moral compass.
I saw my opportunity.
"Mike, please...don't..."
"Shut up!" Jennifer snapped at me.
" Do you think the Shaw family will let you walk away if anything happens to me? " I replied, fighting to keep my voice steady despite the fear churning in my stomach.
Something flickered in Jennifer's eyes-a moment of uncertainty quickly replaced by malicious calculation.
"You're right," she smelled, "I'm not going to seriously harm you. That was never the plan. We have plenty of time ahead of us, Angela. Why don't we play a little game?"
Jennifer moved closer and crouched in front of me. "Do you have your phone on you?" she asked with false sweetness. "Don't look at me like that. It's just for a little test."
Before I could respond, Jennifer roughly flipped me onto my side, searching through my pockets.
I winced as the movement put pressure on my abdomen, fear for my unborn child escalating. I had no idea what she was planning, but her erratic behavior was increasingly concerning.
"Stop moving!" Jennifer hissed as I tried to shift away from her searching hands. "Keep fighting me, and I might accidentally hurt something... or someone... important."
Her words ignited something fierce and protective inside me. Without thinking, I slammed my head forward, connecting with Jennifer's face with a sickening crack.
Jennifer fell backward, screaming in pain and clutching her nose. "You bitch!"
"Don't you dare talk about my child like that," I snarled.
"What the hell are you trying to do?" Mike pulled Jennifer to her feet
Wiping blood from her nose, Jennifer glared at us both. "Where's her phone? She must have had it with her when you grabbed her. What did you do with it?"
"Why do you care?" Mike asked warily.
"I need it to make a call," Jennifer insisted. "Give it to me now, or I'm calling Christina to tell her you've completely failed her."
Reluctantly, Mike reached into his pocket and produced my phone. Jennifer snatched it from his hand, a triumphant smile spreading across her face despite her bleeding nose.
She crouched near me again, though this time maintaining a safer distance.
"Let's play a game, Angela. If I call Sean from your phone right now, do you think he'll answer?"
I met her gaze with cold indifference, refusing to give her the satisfaction of seeing my uncertainty.
Of course I'd wondered the same thing myself-would Sean even care that I was missing?
Or was he too preoccupied with Christina to notice?
"Still playing the dignified Mrs. Shaw?" Jennifer taunted. "We both know you're just using this pregnancy to trap Sean. You can drop the act."
"Whether I'm using this pregnancy or not," I replied evenly, "it's none of your business. Or is it that you wish you were in my position? Jealous that you'll never be Mrs. Shaw yourself?"
Jennifer's face flushed crimson, her composure cracking. "Y-you're talking nonsense!"
"Am I?" I pressed, seeing I'd struck a nerve. "Strange how defensive you are about that idea."
With hands shaking from rage, Jennifer pulled up Sean's contact on my phone.
"Let's see how important you really are to your husband, shall we? We both know exactly who he's with right now, don't we? I wonder if he'll even bother to answer when his beloved wife calls."
Mike stepped forward, alarmed. "What are you doing? You're trying to bring other people here now? Are you out of your mind?"
"Relax," Jennifer said with poisonous confidence.
Jennifer held the phone to her ear, the call on speaker. It rang once, twice, three times.
After six rings, the call went to voicemail. "Hello, you've reached Sean Shaw. I'm unavailable at the moment. Please leave a message, and I'll return your call as soon as possible."
Jennifer's laughter filled the warehouse. "See, Angela? He won't even answer your calls! You mean absolutely nothing to him."
I remained silent, my face betraying nothing, though Jennifer's words echoed painful doubts I'd harbored myself. Sean was probably holding Christina right now, comforting her. Of course he wouldn't answer my call.
"Why won't you react?" Jennifer demanded, increasingly frustrated by my composed facade. "Don't you care at all?"
When I still said nothing, Jennifer hurled my phone against the nearest wall with a scream of frustration. "I refuse to believe you're this emotionless!"
She lunged toward me, hands outstretched like claws.
"Jennifer, what the hell are you-" Mike started to intervene.
The warehouse door crashed open with explosive force, the metal hinges screaming in protest as it slammed against the wall.
All three of us froze, turning toward the sudden intrusion and the silhouette now framed in the doorway.
###chapter 80: Could it really be him? 
Angela POV
Before we even had a chance to react, a group of people burst in.
Jennifer was grabbed by the arms and thrown to the ground.
Mike received the same treatment.
The already dusty warehouse was now suffocating from the sheer number of people.
I instinctively shut my eyes.
I had no idea who had barged in, but I didn't dare scream for help. Instead, I huddled in a corner, protecting my stomach.
"Grab them and take them out!"
Someone was giving orders, and the voice was unfamiliar, which only made me more uneasy.
"Ah! What are you doing? Let me go!"
I couldn't see, but I could hear Jennifer's desperate struggles and distant screams.
Were they the police? But who called them?
Or was it someone else?
I felt dizzy, and even a little nauseous.
Was it from the earlier impact, or the drug they had given me?
Then, I heard steady footsteps approaching.
She tried to lift her head, but I was just too exhausted. My body, which had been tense, suddenly felt like it had shut down.
My mind went foggy, and all I could hear was the chaos around me.
A few seconds later, a pair of strong hands cradled my head, unlocked the chains around me, and gently picked me up.
Through my haze, I thought the face looked familiar, and the scent of forest-like cologne was too.
But it couldn't be him How could he be here? I must be hallucinating. My stomach ached, and my head felt worse.
"Let's go," I heard him command.
With that, he carried me out.
As we exited the warehouse, we ran into Jennifer and Mike being shoved into a car.
Jennifer was screaming in frustration.
"What do you want with us? Let me go! You can't just kidnap me like this!"
"Kidnap?" The man holding me snapped. "So now you know it's illegal to kidnap someone?"
Jennifer faltered, then tried to shift the blame to Mike.
"It's his fault, not mine! I have nothing to do with this!"
"Really?" The man holding me raised an eyebrow. "If you have nothing to do with this, why were you at the scene? When we came in, you ran right for Angela. Don't tell me you were trying to save her?"
"I I was trying to save her! I thought Mike was going to hurt her, so"
"You're lying! You're a worthless piece of-"
"Shut them up!" The man carrying me barked. "So stupid, so evil."
"Mr. Blake, please get in the car," someone said.
Could it really be him? Christopher? This wasn't a hallucination!
But how is he here?
"Christopher" I tried to speak, but a sharp pain hit my stomach, and I grabbed his shirt instinctively.
"Don't speak. You're safe now," he said, his tone calm as he carried me into the car.
He didn't put me down until the car started moving. I was in too much pain to care, just letting him hold me.
"Mr. Blake, where are we going?" the driver asked.
"To the nearest hospital," Christopher's voice was urgent.
"Got it."
Because I was in the car, the driver drove cautiously, not daring to speed.
A few minutes later, Christopher snapped, "If you keep driving this slowly, her injuries are going to worsen before we get to the hospital. Can you take responsibility for that?"
"Right, right. I'll speed up now," the driver responded, his voice tense.
***
In the speeding car, I finally lost consciousness completely.
I don't know how long I was out-like I'd died, with no dreams, nothing.
When I woke up, the world outside was completely dark.
My head still felt heavy, like something had been pounding inside it.
Then, a thought hit me, and I shot up from the bed, desperate to get out. But in doing so, I accidentally pulled on the IV in my arm, and the pain made me gasp.
The noise startled Christopher, who had been sitting on the couch, and he rushed over to help me, calling for a nurse.
The nurse quickly arrived and adjusted the IV.
While she was doing that, I asked, "Can you take this out? I really need to leave."
The nurse looked at Christopher, standing nearby.
He smiled softly. "It can't come out yet. You're still unwell, and you need both of those fluids."
"Christopher, I'm so grateful for what you did, but I really have something important to do."
"If you're talking about Grandma Sean's surgery, you can relax. It was successful, and she's resting now."
When I heard that, the weight on my chest finally lifted.
"Then I want to see her. What about this IV?"
"Angela." Christopher gently patted my head. "Right now, the most important thing is for you to take care of yourself. Understand?"
I slowly turned to look at him, my mind racing.
We're in a hospital, and since they gave me an IV, they must have done a physical exam.
Does Christopher know everything now?
###chapter 81: He Knows... But He Doesn’t Want The Baby
Angela POV
At that thought, my face darkened slightly. I stared into Christopher's eyes, which seemed to be hiding something-a mist of uncertainty I couldn't quite grasp.
But on the surface, he still wore that calm, reassuring smile.
He must have noticed my tension. "What's wrong?" he asked, his voice soft but probing.
I lowered my gaze, glancing at the nurse still in the room, and stayed silent.
The nurse adjusted the needle in my arm, and the sharp sting cleared my head a little.
Once she left, the room was empty except for the two of us. Now, I could finally say what had been on my mind.
I was still trying to figure out how to start when Christopher suddenly crouched down in front of me. He held a white silk handkerchief, gently dabbing at the bloodstains from where I'd accidentally pulled on the wound.
I assumed his obsessive need for cleanliness was kicking in again.
After about ten seconds, I couldn't take it anymore. "You don't have to keep wiping it. It's not going to come off."
He paused, then stopped wiping.
A moment later, he said, "Someone will bring you some clothes soon. You can change out of that one then."
I nodded, but I couldn't figure out what he was really doing.
He must know by now about my pregnancy, yet he didn't ask a thing.
He and Sean were friends... Would he tell him?
I was lost in thought when Christopher broke the silence.
"You look like you want to say something. What's on your mind?"
I looked up at him. "So, you know, don't you?"
Christopher nodded. "You mean that you're pregnant?"
"Can you promise me something?" I said, my voice steady but serious. "Please, don't tell Sean."
"Sean doesn't know?" Christopher looked shocked, then his lips curled into a small smile. I couldn't tell if it was mockery or... maybe even a little relief?
I could never figure him out.
"Promise me you won't tell him."
"I swear I won't," he said, putting a hand on my shoulder. "But I'm not trying to pry, I'm just curious-why don't you want him to know? He's the father."
I interrupted him. "He knows." My fingers tightened on the bedsheet.
Not every father wants to be one. I thought of the message I sent him that he never responded to, and Christina handing me the check, urging me to get an abortion. Without thinking, I placed my hand on my stomach, trying to force a bitter smile.
"He knows... but he doesn't want the baby."
Saying that felt like a knife to my chest.
Before the kidnapping, I was still wearing Sean's jacket. I had even been moved by that small gesture of his. But now, Christopher's question pulled me back into the harsh reality.
Sean hadn't answered my calls... and he didn't want our baby.
"So, he thinks you've already gotten rid of the baby?" Christopher continued.
"Probably."
"I promise you, I won't tell him."
Christopher looked at me with sympathy, and it made my chest feel even heavier. I couldn't stop the tears from falling, so I turned away, unable to face him any longer.
After a moment, Christopher wiped away my tears with the same handkerchief. He cupped my face in his hands, his touch tender, like that of an older brother, and sighed.
"Little Angel, why are you so foolish? Are you really planning to raise this baby alone?"
"Is that so bad?"
I wiped my eyes and forced a small smile.
"I can be a great single mom. I grew up in a single-parent home. I turned out fine, didn't I? My father loved me, just like any other father would. And I didn't feel like... not having a mom made me different from anyone else."
My words started to spill faster, but my confidence started to fade. I felt my voice quieting with each sentence.
Christopher seemed to notice, his hand still holding mine. He spoke softly, "It's alright. Raising a child isn't a big deal. You don't need to explain everything. Just do what feels right for you."
My breathing was heavy from the outburst, and it took a while before I was calm enough to speak again.
"Sorry... I got a little carried away."
"It's fine," he said gently, his smile never wavering. There was no judgment, no criticism-only understanding.
It made me feel grateful.
Then, with a strange gesture, he tucked the bloodstained handkerchief into his pocket.
That surprised me. Wasn't he obsessed with cleanliness?
Before I could dwell on it, he spoke again.
"Before you woke up, I got a call from Sean. He's probably on his way now." He paused, then added, "Prepare yourself."
Bang!
Before he even finished speaking, the door to the room slammed open.
A familiar figure appeared in the doorway.
Before I could process what was happening, Sean rushed to my side, grabbed my shoulders, his breath coming fast as he asked,
"Angela, are you hurt? Is it serious?"
###chapter 82: You Probably Won't Get Another Chance
Sean POV
"Angela, are you hurt? Is it serious?" The words tumbled from my lips as I burst into the hospital room. The sight of her lying in the bed, looking so fragile against the stark white sheets, made my chest constrict painfully.
But Angela's response wasn't what I expected. She barely glanced in my direction, her face a mask of careful indifference.
 "I'm fine," she said quietly, her voice carrying a chill that made me pause mid-step.
The scene before me-Angela in the hospital bed, Christopher standing guard like some self-appointed protector-made something dark and possessive rear up inside me.
Without thinking, I moved toward Angela. "We need to get you checked properly-"
"That won't be necessary," Angela cut me off, her voice tight with barely contained emotion. "The doctors have already examined me thoroughly." She shifted slightly, wincing as the movement pulled at her injured wrists. "I'm quite tired now. I'd like to rest."
The dismissal in her tone was unmistakable. Christopher cleared his throat softly. "Perhaps we should continue our discussion outside?"
I wanted to refuse, to stay by Angela's side, but one look at her closed expression told me she meant what she said. With a tight nod, I followed Christopher into the hallway, the door closing behind us with a soft click.
"How did you find her?" I demanded without preamble.
Christopher leaned against the wall, his usual impeccable appearance showing signs of strain.
 "I was on my way to visit Elizabeth, actually. When I arrived at the hospital, Victoria mentioned Angela had gone missing. I tried calling her phone and managed to trace its location."
He paused, his expression darkening.
"What I found was... concerning."
"What do you mean?"
"The kidnappers were Jennifer and a man named Mike-a former security guard who used to work Christina's events." Christopher's voice remained carefully neutral, but his implications were clear.
"Rather interesting coincidence, don't you think?"
The suggestion hit me like a physical blow.
"That's impossible. Christina would never-"
"Never what, Sean?" Christopher's amber eyes fixed on me with unnerving intensity. "Never orchestrate something like this? Then perhaps you can explain why her closest friend and former employee were holding your wife captive in an abandoned warehouse?"
I felt the color drain from my face as the implications sank in.
"You don't understand. Christina was missing too. I was looking for her-"
"Yes, quite convenient timing, wasn't it? While you were searching for Christina, Angela was being attacked. Did you even check your phone when she called?"
The accusation hit home with devastating accuracy. I had ignored several calls from Angela's number, too focused on finding Christina.
The realization made my stomach churn.
"How long had Angela been missing before you found her?" The question came out rougher than I intended.
"Long enough." Christopher straightened his cuffs with deliberate precision. "Long enough for her to realize that her husband was too busy chasing after another woman to notice she was in danger."
My hands clenched into fists at my sides. "Watch yourself, Blake. She's still my wife."
"Temporarily." His lips curved into a knowing smile that made my blood boil. "Your marriage contract expires soon, doesn't it?"
The knowledge that he knew about our arrangement felt like another betrayal. "Angela told you about that?"
"She needed someone to confide in," he replied smoothly. "Someone who would put her interests first, instead of running off to buy strawberries for another woman in the middle of the night."
My hand shot out before I could stop myself, grabbing his lapel. "You don't know anything about my relationship with Angela."
"I know more than you think." Christopher didn't resist my grip, his calm demeanor only fueling my anger. "I know she deserves better than being your backup plan while you play house with Christina."
"What exactly are you implying?"
"I'm not implying anything." He removed my hand from his jacket with careful precision. "I'm simply suggesting that you take a good look at your priorities, Sean. Before it's too late."
Through the window in Angela's door, I could see her lying still in the hospital bed, one hand resting protectively over her stomach. The sight made something twist painfully in my chest.
"Just remember," Christopher's voice was quiet but carried clearly in the empty hallway, "the next time your wife calls, you might want to answer. You never know what you might lose by choosing Christina instead."
I lowered my head, falling silent. This time, I had truly made a mistake. But how could I have known...
"Oh," Christopher's voice cut through my thoughts with surgical precision, "I almost forgot. You probably won't get another chance."
His lips curved into a cold smile. "She's unlikely to call you again, isn't she?"
###chapter 83: I Don't Play Games
Sean POV
I stared at him, my anger giving way to a creeping sense of dread.
"What do you mean by that?" My voice came out rougher than intended.
"I mean that Angela trusted me enough to tell me everything, Sean. About your marriage contract, about how it expires soon." His lips curved into a knowing smile. "Did you really think she had no one to confide in?"
I felt the blood drain from my face. "She told you about our arrangement?"
"Of course she did." His tone carried a hint of satisfaction. "Did you think she had no one to turn to while you were falling over yourself to please Christina?"
The casual admission caught me completely off guard.
For all the years I'd known them, Christopher had always treated Angela like a sister. Even during our Yale days, he'd never shown any romantic interest in her.
His sudden departure to London five years ago had only reinforced that impression of brotherly affection.
"This is... unexpected," I said slowly, studying his face. "You've never shown any interest in Angela before. Why now? After five years away?"
Christopher's amber eyes met mine with cool intensity. A slight smile played at his lips.
"Five years can change a lot of things, Sean. The way I see Angela now..." He adjusted his platinum cufflinks with deliberate precision.
"Let's just say I no longer view her as a sister."
"You've been too busy with Christina to notice what's been happening right in front of you." He took a step closer, his presence commanding. "You had something precious, Sean, and you took it for granted. But I won't make that same mistake."
His expression turned serious, almost dangerous.
"When I want something-or someone-I don't play games."
Before I could respond, my phone buzzed insistently. Mother's name flashed across the screen, her third call in as many minutes.
My jaw clenched as I brought the phone to my ear. Mother's voice crackled through immediately, sharp with barely contained fury.
"Get back here right now!" she demanded. "Your wife has been attacked and kidnapped, and where were you? Running after Christina again?"
"Mother, I-"
"Don't 'Mother' me," she cut me off. "Get back here immediately. And Sean? You have some serious explaining to do."
The line went dead. I closed my eyes briefly, feeling the weight of my mistakes pressing down on me.
Christopher was already back in Angela's room when I stepped in behind him.
I made my way to Angela's bedside and sat down, reaching out to touch her face, but she quickly turned away. Her eyes were closed, but I could tell she was awake.
"Angela, I'm going to check on Elizabeth. I'll be back to keep you company soon, okay?"
Her response was nothing but silence.
With a pang in my chest, I stood up, each step toward the door feeling heavier than the last.
***
The atmosphere in Elizabeth's recovery room hit me like a wall of ice. Mother stood by the window, while Father sat quietly in a corner, his usual diplomatic demeanor notably strained.
"Well?" Victoria's voice cut through the silence. "Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
I remained silent, knowing nothing I could say would justify my actions.
"Your wife was attacked today, Sean." Mother's voice trembled with rage as she approached me. "She was kidnapped and hurt while you were chasing after Christina. Do you have any idea what could have happened to her?"
The sharp sound of her slap echoed in the quiet room.
I didn't move, accepting the blow as my due.
"Victoria," Father warned softly, but Mother wasn't finished.
"How dare you?" she hissed. "How dare you betray Angela like this? That girl has stood by your side through everything. She's been more loyal to this family than you deserve. And this is how you repay her?"
"I made a mistake," I admitted, my voice rough. "I should have been there for her."
"A mistake?" Mother laughed bitterly. "You've been making 'mistakes' ever since Christina came back into your life. That girl has you wrapped around her finger, and you're too blind to see it."
"That's not fair," I protested weakly. "Christina saved my life-"
"So What?" Mother's voice could have frozen hell. "Is this how you repay her-by hurting Angela?"
I fell silent...
"I've watched you throw away everything that matters," Mother continued, her voice softening slightly. "Your marriage, your family's peace, Angela's trust-all for what? For Christina?"
"I'll fix this," I promised, meeting her eyes. "I'll make it right."
"Will you?" Mother studied my face intently. "Then prove it. Start making the right choices, Sean. Before it's too late."
"I know," I replied, thinking of Angela lying in her hospital bed. "And I'm going to start now."
Once I confirmed that Elizabeth's surgery went smoothly, I drove to the hospital where Christina was.
Later, when I finally entered Christina's room, the sight that greeted me was achingly familiar-Christina propped against silk pillows, looking delicate and vulnerable in the harsh hospital lighting. But this time, I saw through the careful performance.
"Sean, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have just run off like that today. I know I worried you."
"Where are your friends? Do you have any idea where they went?" I glanced around the room.
"I'm not sure," Christina said, shaking her head, her lip caught between her teeth. "I stepped out earlier, so they're probably out looking for me."
She reached out, tugging lightly at the corner of my shirt. "Sean, please don't be mad at me, okay?" she said softly.
I slowly pulled her hand away.
"I'm asking you again-are you sure you don't know where they went?"
###chapter 84: Should I Trust Her?
Sean POV
"Stop playing games, Christina." My voice came out harder than I'd ever used with her.
"Jennifer and Mike. Your friend and your former security guard. Where are they?"
Something calculated flashed behind her eyes before being quickly masked with confusion.
 "Jennifer? I haven't seen her since this morning. And who's Mike?"
"Don't." I tightened my grip slightly on her wrist. "Don't lie to me. Not about this."
"The security guard who worked your summer garden party," I continued, watching her face. "The one who, coincidentally, was involved in attacking Angela today."
Her eyes widened with seemingly genuine shock. "Angela was attacked? Oh my god, Sean, is she alright? I had no idea-"
"Stop." I cut through her performance.
"The timing of your disappearance. The way you kept calling until I left the hospital. Your closest friend found at the scene."
I moved closer, using my height to loom over her bed.
"Do you really expect me to believe this was all coincidence?"
"You're frightening me. I would never hurt anyone. You know that."Christina's lower lip trembled.
"Do I?" I caught her chin, forcing her to meet my gaze. "Because right now, I'm wondering how much I actually know about you at all."
A tear spilled down Christina's cheek.
"How can you say that? After everything we've been through? After I risked my life to save yours?" Her voice broke. "That day on the yacht-"
I felt my resolve waver at the sight of her tears.
 Despite the anger and suspicion churning in my gut, there was still something about Christina's vulnerability that pulled at me.
Almost unconsciously, I reached for the tissue box on her bedside table and held it out to her.
My hand trembled slightly - caught between the instinct to comfort and the need to remain stern.
Christina took a tissue with trembling fingers, her eyes meeting mine with a mixture of gratitude and hurt that made my chest tighten.
I watched as she dabbed at her tears, the familiar gesture bringing back memories of all the times I'd consoled her before. Had those moments been real, or just another performance?
"I remember," I said finally, my tone softening despite myself.
The weight of that old debt still pulled at me, mingling uncomfortably with my current suspicions.
My emotions were a tangled mess - anger at her possible betrayal, sympathy for her tears, guilt over doubting someone who once saved my life, and a desperate need to know the truth.
"I've always been grateful for what you did. But gratitude has limits, Christina."
"You have no proof," she whispered, her voice trembling as she crumpled the tissue in her hand.
"You're just throwing accusations at me because you need someone to blame. Why would I want to hurt Angela? She'll be out of your life soon anyway-your marriage contract is almost up."
I felt a flash of annoyance at her words, followed immediately by a wave of confusion at my own reaction.
Once, Christina and I had planned together how to remove Angela from my life, and I had welcomed such suggestions.
But now, when she brought it up again, I only felt irritation mixed with an inexplicable protectiveness toward Angela.
Something had changed, though I couldn't quite explain what. These conflicting emotions left me feeling both frustrated and uncertain - I couldn't trust Christina fully anymore, but I couldn't completely dismiss her either.
"I would never hurt anyone, I've only ever hurt myself... to protect my dignity, my feelings." She caught my hand against her cheek.
"That day on the yacht, I didn't even think about my own life when I jumped in to save you..."
I pulled my hand away slowly, torn between suspicion and long-ingrained trust. Something about this whole situation felt wrong, but I couldn't quite piece it together.
I needed more information, more evidence.
"I'll look into what happened today," I said finally, my voice carefully neutral. "If you're telling the truth, it will come out. But if I find out you had anything to do with Angela's attack..."
"Sean, I don't care what other people say about me," Christina's voice grew softer. "Like this incident-people might think I deliberately set up Angela, but I can ignore all of that. But if you misunderstand me too, just like everyone else..."
She lowered her eyes, her expression crumbling into despair.
"And now with my face ruined... if you don't believe in me either, I really don't know what's the point of living anymore..."
I left her room without responding, my mind already working through the possibilities. I needed to talk to my security team, check the hospital cameras, trace Mike's movements. If Christina was behind this, there had to be evidence somewhere.
But first, I needed to check on Angela. The thought of her alone with Christopher for so long made something twist uncomfortably in my chest.
When I arrived at Angela's floor, I heard voices from the nurses' station. A young nurse was speaking to her colleague, her voice carrying clearly down the hall.
"Mr. Blake is so attentive! Did you see how he hasn't left his girlfriend's side since she arrived? That's what I call true love."
I stopped dead in my tracks, my hand tightening into a fist at my side.
 Girlfriend?
 The word echoed in my head like a taunt.
###chapter 85: Did He Change Her Clothes?
Sean POV
I found them in Angela's VIP room-Christopher standing by the window, speaking quietly with the night nurse. The sight of him there, acting as if he had every right to be by her bedside, made something twist in my chest.
"Mr. Blake," the nurse was saying, her voice warm with approval, "we don't often see this kind of dedication, even in our VIP wing."
Christopher's response carried clearly across the quiet room. "Although she's not my girlfriend yet, thank you for your congratulations. I'll do my best to win her heart."
The casual presumption in his tone made my blood boil. Without conscious thought, I found myself stepping into the room, my voice carrying that edge of authority I usually reserved for hostile takeovers.
"I'm here to take my wife home."
Christopher turned slowly, his amber eyes meeting mine with that infuriating calm he'd perfected over the years. He didn't move from his position by Angela's bedside, a subtle challenge in his stance that didn't go unnoticed.
"Why are you still here?" I asked, moving to the opposite side of Angela's bed. The question came out sharper than I'd intended, but seeing Christopher so comfortable in my wife's hospital room set my teeth on edge.
Christopher's lips curved into that knowing smile that had always irritated me. "To look after Angela, of course. How's your investigation going? Found anything interesting about Christina's involvement?"
"There's no concrete evidence linking Christina to the attack," I said, keeping my voice carefully neutral despite the provocative tone in his question.
"Still defending her?" Christopher's voice carried a hint of contempt. "After everything that's happened, you're still taking her side?"
"I'm not taking sides," I responded, fighting to maintain my composure. "I'm simply saying we need actual proof before making accusations. Even you should understand the importance of evidence, Blake."
A soft sound from the bed interrupted our brewing confrontation. Angela stirred slightly, though her eyes remained closed.
I watched as her features tensed then smoothed, recognizing the tell-tale signs of someone pretending to sleep-a habit she'd had since college when she wanted to avoid difficult situations.
"Angel," Christopher called softly, the familiar nickname setting my teeth on edge, "if you're awake, you can stop pretending to sleep now."
Her eyes opened slowly, confusion clouding her features as she took in the scene before her. The sight of her vulnerability made my earlier anger fade, replaced by an overwhelming need to protect her-even if it meant protecting her from my own mistakes.
"Are you feeling any better?" I asked softly, my eyes searching her face for any signs of discomfort. She gave a slight nod, though the pallor of her skin told a different story.
"Elizabeth's surgery went well," I continued, gentling my voice. "She's asking for you. We should head home so you can rest properly before visiting her tomorrow."
"The doctors haven't cleared her to leave yet," Christopher cut in sharply, moving to stand between me and Angela's bed. "The doctor specifically said she needs to stay under observation for at least twenty-four hours. You can't just take her home because you suddenly decided to show up."
His words stoked the anger that had been simmering since I'd entered the room.
"I have the best private doctors in the country," I replied coldly, my eyes never leaving his. "I am perfectly capable of taking care of my wife. Your concern is unnecessary and frankly, unwelcome."
I moved past him to Angela's side, shrugging off my cashmere overcoat. The fabric felt warm from my body heat as I carefully draped it around her shoulders.
"This will be warmer," I said softly, then slipped one arm beneath her knees and the other behind her back, lifting her from the bed.
"I can walk by myself," Angela protested weakly, her hands pressing against my chest in a half-hearted attempt to create distance between us.
But I ignored her resistance, only tightening my hold. Her slight weight in my arms reminded me forcefully of how fragile she could be, despite her usual strength.
Through it all, Christopher watched with that unreadable expression that had always made me want to punch him.
"Little Angel," he said tenderly, though his eyes held a warmth that made my arms tighten around Angela, "please take care of yourself. I'll handle everything we discussed earlier."
The look that passed between them wasn't lost on me-some silent communication that excluded me entirely.
"Something you'll miss?" I couldn't keep the edge from my voice as I caught Angela's lingering glance toward Christopher.
Her response was to close her eyes and turn her face against my shoulder, effectively ending any further discussion. But as I carried her from the room, Christopher's voice stopped me at the doorway.
"Wait," he called out, his tone deliberately casual. "You forgot these things."
 He held out a neatly packed bag, and as he handed it to Michael, I caught a glimpse of its contents-Angela's phone, her purse, and what made my blood run cold:
her intimate personal items, including her underwear.
Rage surged through me, hot and violent.
Had he been the one to handle her personal belongings?
To change her clothes?
The implications made my jaw clench so hard it hurt, but before I could voice my fury, Christopher flashed that provocative smile of his and turned away, disappearing down the corridor with an air of satisfaction that spoke volumes.
My arms tightened protectively around Angela as questions I couldn't bring myself to ask burned in my throat.
The knowledge that he had touched such private things of hers, had perhaps even... I couldn't finish the thought.
It was too infuriating to contemplate.
###chapter 86: You'll Be free To Be With Her Openly
Angela POV
I tried to shift in Sean's arms as we exited the hospital's VIP wing, suddenly too aware of how intimately I was pressed against his chest.
I attempted to loosen my grip around his neck, but his response was immediate and commanding.
"Don't."
 To emphasize his point, he deliberately loosened his own grip, making me instinctively tighten my hold.
"Sean!" I couldn't keep the fear from my voice as I clutched at his shoulders, my heart racing at the thought of falling.
I caught the ghost of a smile playing at his lips as he adjusted his grip, once again holding me securely. The winter air bit sharply as we emerged into the night.
Sean's Bentley idled at the curb, its dark exterior gleaming under the hospital's lights. Peter hurried forward to open the rear door, and Sean lowered me onto the leather seat with surprising gentleness.
"Take the rest of the night off, Peter," Sean instructed as he rounded the car. "I'll drive Mrs. Shaw home myself."
I watched Sean's reflection in the glass, noting how his knuckles were white against the steering wheel, tension radiating from his rigid posture.
"Christopher seemed very... attentive," he finally said, his voice carefully controlled. "You two appear quite close these days."
I continued staring out the window, watching raindrops chase each other across the glass. "He's an old friend who helped me when I needed it. Nothing more."
"Nothing more?" Sean's laugh held no humor. "The nurses seemed to think differently. They were quite impressed by his dedication to his girlfriend."
"Don't be ridiculous." I felt my voice sharpen involuntarily. "Well, it won't matter soon anyway. Elizabeth's surgery was successful, we can start the divorce proceedings as planned."
"Elizabeth needs time to recover properly. This isn't the right moment to-"
"There will never be a 'right moment,'" I cut in.
Sean opened his mouth to respond but suddenly grimaced, one hand flying to his chest. His face contorted with pain as he guided the car to the shoulder of the road.
"Sean?" I felt my anger evaporate instantly, replaced by genuine concern. "What's wrong? "
"I'm fine." he managed through gritted teeth. He caught my hand, pressing it against his chest where I could feel his heart racing erratically. "Just... stay like this for a moment."
I felt the frantic beating beneath my palm slowly steady. I tried to withdraw my hand, but Sean's grip tightened.
"Not yet," he murmured, his eyes still closed. The vulnerability in his expression made my throat tight with emotion.
Later that night, in my suite at the Park Avenue apartment, Sean lingered in the doorway. "I'm sorry about earlier," he said quietly. "I shouldn't have..."
"It's fine." I busied myself arranging pillows, avoiding his gaze. "We both know this marriage was just a business arrangement. There's no need to apologize for anything."
His expression darkened at my words, but he simply nodded. "I'll have additional security assigned to you. No one will hurt you again."
"Thank you." I kept my voice perfectly composed, giving nothing away. "Goodnight, Sean."
***
Forty-eight hours later, in the private parking garage beneath Shaw Tower, I finally broached the subject again.
Elizabeth had been moved to a private recovery suite, her condition stable and improving.
"We should tell Victoria and Alexander first," I said, my voice steady despite my racing heart. "I can take responsibility for the separation if you think that would be easier. Say that I've fallen for someone else, or-"
The screech of tires cut me off as Sean suddenly swerved into a corner of the garage, throwing the car into park with more force than necessary.
"Is that what you want?" His voice was dangerously quiet. "To tell everyone you've fallen for Christopher Blake?"
"That's not what I meant." I fought to maintain my composure. "I'm trying to make this easier for everyone. "
Sean's hands tightened on the steering wheel until his knuckles went white.
 "And you think that's what's best? "
"Isn't that what we agreed to?" The exhaustion of the past few days suddenly caught up with me, making my voice softer than intended. "You'll be free to be with Christina openly. Isn't that what you've wanted all along?"
"What I want," I heard him whisper, "is something I'm only now beginning to understand."
###chapter 87: I Don't Want A Divorce Anymore!
Angela POV
When I woke up the next morning, Sean wasn't home. Remembering we still hadn't set a time to handle the divorce paperwork, I called him.
"Angela." He sounded distant already. "I'm heading into the quarterly board meeting."
I forced my voice to remain steady. "We need to talk about the divorce proceedings. Now that Elizabeth's surgery was successful-"
"I can't discuss this right now." I heard papers shuffling in the background. "The board is waiting."
"Sean-"
The line went dead.
His attitude felt strange to me. Was he trying to avoid the divorce? But why would he do that?
After breakfast, despite the lingering pain in my right leg where Jennifer had kicked me, I decided to visit Elizabeth.
She sat propped against plush pillows, her silver hair perfectly coiffed despite her recent surgery. The sight of her made my heart squeeze with affection.
"Angela, darling." Her face lit up as I entered. "I was hoping you'd come by."
I moved to adjust her pillows, relief washing over me at the healthy color in her cheeks. "How are you feeling?"
"Much better, thanks to you." She caught my hand, her grip surprisingly strong. "The doctors say everything went perfectly. Though I must say, I'm surprised Sean isn't with you today."
I managed what I hoped was a convincing smile. "He's caught up in board meetings."
"Meetings?" Her eyes narrowed slightly in that way that always made me feel transparent. "That boy... he works too hard sometimes. Victoria was just saying the same thing yesterday."
Before I could respond, Dr. Carter appeared in the doorway with news of Elizabeth's remarkable recovery.
As I watched her beam at the prospect of returning home soon, I felt my throat tighten. How many more times would I be able to care for her like this?
Evening found me back at the penthouse, the city lights beginning to twinkle to life outside the windows.
Michael stood in the foyer, his usually perfect posture slightly stiff as he delivered Sean's message.
"Mrs. Shaw." He cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Mr. Shaw asked me to inform you that he won't be home tonight. There are some urgent matters at the office that require his attention."
From her spot by the window, Victoria looked up sharply. "Work? Is it really so busy that he needs to hide in his office all day and work late into the night?"
"The merger season is particularly intense right now, Mrs. Shaw," Michael replied smoothly, though I caught the slight hesitation in his voice. "Mr. Shaw is personally overseeing several critical deals."
Victoria's tone dripped with sarcasm. "Of course he is."
She turned to me, her eyes softening with concern. "Darling, you shouldn't let him get away with this behavior. A wife has certain rights, you know."
I thought Victoria must have misunderstood. She probably assumed Sean was meeting with Christina. But I didn't know how to explain to Victoria that Sean was actually avoiding the divorce discussion with me.
In the middle of the night, as I was drifting off to sleep, I felt a weight press down and something brush against my face. When I opened my eyes, I caught Sean's lips quickly sweeping across my cheek.
Sean jerked back immediately. "I... I was just checking if you were covered properly," he stammered, uncertainty coloring his voice. "The nights are getting colder."
Before I could respond, Sean walked into the bathroom.
I touched my lips, feeling them warm and moist with the scent of whiskey lingering.
So he wasn't really checking my blanket-he was kissing me?!
This realization shocked and confused me. Why would he suddenly kiss me?
But I couldn't ask him now. I was too tired and didn't want to start another argument in the middle of the night. I pulled the blanket tighter around me, deciding to pretend nothing had happened.
As the steady sound of running water echoed from the bathroom, I drifted back to sleep.
The next morning when I woke up, he was still not home. Was he avoiding me again? I decided to go to his office to find him. But when I arrived, there was no sign of him there either.
Emily appeared in the doorway.
"He's been in meetings since dawn," Emily offered, holding out a stack of quarterly reports. "But he left these for you to sign."
I gestured for Emily to place the files on the desk. After she left, I picked up my phone and dialed Sean's number.
"Where are you?"
"About to enter another meeting." His voice sounded distant, distracted.
"Stop hiding behind work, Sean." I fought to keep my voice steady, though anger threatened to break through. "We need to discuss the divorce. You're the one who wanted this, remember?"
A long pause followed, filled only by the sound of his breathing. After a long pause, he finally spoke,
"I don't want a divorce anymore!"
"What do you mean you don't want a divorce?" I gripped the phone tighter, my knuckles turning white. "You were the one who-"
"I just don't, okay?" His voice held a note of frustration I rarely heard.
"Sean, you can't just-"
"Look, I need to think things through," he cut in, his words coming out in a rush. "I have to go. The board is waiting."
"Sean, wait-"
But the line had already gone dead.
I lowered my phone slowly, still trying to process Sean's words. Before I could make sense of it all, movement at the doorway caught my attention. Christina stood there, her red hair catching the morning light like flames. My stomach clenched at the sight of her.
Christina's eyes widened slightly when she saw me. "What are you doing here? Where's Sean?"
I looked at her, thinking about my kidnapping two days ago-most likely orchestrated by her. I let out a cold laugh.
"Did you hit your head too hard or something? I'm Sean's secretary. What's so strange about me being in his office? As for you, those wounds haven't healed yet. You might want to stay home-running around will only make the scars worse."
At the mention of scars, Christina's hand instinctively went to the bandage on her forehead.
A flash of panic crossed her eyes, quickly replaced by anger. Her face darkened as she spat out,
"Angela, when are you finally going to divorce Sean? How much longer are you planning to keep him trapped?"
###chapter 88: We Would Certainly Become Tomorrow's Office Gossip
Angela POV
I met Christina's gaze steadily across Sean's pristine office, watching her fingers nervously adjust the designer bandage covering her forehead wound.
The morning light streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows cast harsh shadows across her face, making her look older, more desperate than her usual carefully maintained appearance would allow.
"Trapped? That's an interesting choice of words, Christina. Especially coming from someone who orchestrated her own disappearance to manipulate him."
Her perfectly manicured hands clenched at her sides. "You have no right to judge me. Not after everything I've done for your family."
"Ah yes, my family. You're talking about two years ago, when you took my father to the hospital, right? Stop using my father's incident to threaten me, I've already fulfilled our agreement. I don't owe you anything anymore." I said, my voice growing cold with suppressed anger.
I stood up, placing both hands on Sean's desk as I leaned forward.
"And let's not forget what your friends just did. They nearly made me lose my baby!" My voice shook with barely contained fury.
"Now, get out!"
Christina's face paled slightly at my outburst, but her eyes narrowed with calculation.
"Your baby?"
she repeated softly, a dangerous edge creeping into her voice.
"I agreed to let you keep the baby on one condition-that you would divorce Sean right after Elizabeth's surgery!" Christina's voice trembled with barely contained rage. "But you haven't kept your promise!"
"Let me?" I felt a surge of cold fury. "Christina, get this straight-I don't need your permission to keep my child! And as for the divorce, I'm not the one who changed their mind. Sean's the one who doesn't want it anymore."
Christina's face went through a rapid series of emotions-shock, disbelief, then anger.
"That's impossible!" She shook her head violently. "Sean would never... You're lying! You must be manipulating him somehow!"
"Manipulating him?" I gave a cold laugh. "Why don't you look at the facts, Christina? He's been avoiding any discussion about the divorce for few days now. You can believe whatever you want, but perhaps you should ask yourself why he's suddenly changed his mind."
"He's just confused," Christina's voice carried a note of desperation that almost made me pity her. "Once you're out of the picture-"
"Once I'm out of the picture, what?" I turned back to face her. "You'll finally have him all to yourself? Is that what you really want, Christina? To be Sean Shaw's second choice?"
"Second choice?" She laughed, but the sound was brittle. "I was his first choice long before you came along. Who do you think he really loves? The woman who saved his life, or the convenient business arrangement his grandmother forced on him?"
The words were meant to wound, but I'd long since developed immunity to this particular poison.
"Love?" I raised an eyebrow. "Is that what you call this endless manipulation? These calculated injuries and perfectly timed crises?"
Christina's face darkened. "You know nothing about love. All you understand is contracts and business deals. That's why Sean will never truly be yours."
"Perhaps." I adjusted my blazer, ensuring it lay smooth over my still-flat stomach. "But at least I've never had to orchestrate accidents or fake injuries to keep his attention."
Christina's hand flew to her bandaged forehead, her expression flickering between outrage and fear.
"You can't prove anything," she whispered, but there was uncertainty in her voice now.
"No?" I smiled slightly. "The interesting thing about warehouse security cameras, Christina, is that they catch everything. Even conversations about planned kidnappings."
Her face went pale. "You're bluffing. There weren't any cameras-"
"Are you sure about that?" I moved toward the door again.
Before she could respond, my phone buzzed with an incoming message. I glanced at the screen briefly before gathering my things.
"If you'll excuse me," I said, "I have an important meeting to attend."
Christina's eyes narrowed as she watched me prepare to leave.
"Running off to another lunch date? You've been seen quite often with Christopher Blake lately."
"I don't need to explain my schedule to you," I replied coolly. "Now, if you're quite finished making threats, I have work to do."
When I reached the entrance of Shaw Tower, I was momentarily taken aback by the sight before me.
Christopher had chosen to make quite the statement today.
He stood there in an impeccably tailored navy coat, leaning against a striking silver Aston Martin-a dramatic departure from his usual understated Mercedes. Even among Manhattan's elite, he commanded attention.
I hesitated at the threshold.
The plaza was crowded with the lunch hour rush, and many of my colleagues were enjoying their breaks at the nearby cafes. Christopher's conspicuous presence was already drawing curious glances.
 Any interaction between us would certainly become tomorrow's office gossip.
But before I could decide how to handle the situation, Christopher made the choice for me.
He straightened from his position against the car and walked directly toward me！
"Shall we?" he asked, offering his arm with a slight smile.
I stood frozen, acutely aware of the eyes watching us.
This wasn't Christopher's typical style-he usually preferred subtle gestures over grand displays.
What game was he playing?
###chapter 89:  A Game of Three Players
Angela POV
"You're enjoying this far too much," I murmured, accepting his arm with practiced grace. The whispers from nearby onlookers were already starting, and I could practically see the text messages flying across the financial district's private networks.
"Can you blame me?" He guided me to the passenger door with fluid ease. "It's not every day I get to escort Manhattan's most intriguing woman to lunch."
As we settled into the leather interior, the subtle scent of his forest cologne filled the confined space. It was distinctly different from Sean's preferred citrus notes - another small detail that emphasized the growing distance between my current reality and the life I'd built with Sean.
"I heard about Sean's sudden change of heart regarding the divorce," Christopher said casually as we merged into traffic. "Rather unexpected, wouldn't you say?"
I kept my gaze fixed on the passing scenery. "You seem surprisingly well-informed about my personal affairs."
"You and Sean are both my dear friends," Christopher's voice carried a gentle warmth tinged with concern. "It's only natural that I care about what happens between you." He paused, his gaze dropping meaningfully to my still-flat stomach. "Besides, you're not alone in this anymore. I promised I would help you, didn't I?"
"Christopher-"
"Care to make a small wager?" he interrupted smoothly, navigating through midtown traffic with elegant precision. "I bet Sean will appear at our lunch venue within thirty minutes of someone informing him you're in my car."
"That's absurd," I replied, though uncertainty crept into my voice. "Sean's too busy with board meetings to-"
"To chase after his wife when she's seen with another man?" Christopher's smile held a hint of challenge. "You underestimate both his possessiveness and his sources of information within Shaw Tower."
"And what exactly would I be wagering?"
"Simple." He pulled up to a red light, turning to face me fully. "If I win, you let me help you secure that divorce - my way. No more waiting for Sean to come around."
I studied his profile in the afternoon light, trying to decode the strategy behind his offer. "And if you lose?"
"Then I'll step back completely. Let you handle things your way." The light turned green, and he accelerated smoothly. "Though I should warn you - I rarely lose bets involving Sean Shaw's predictable nature."
"You're assuming quite a lot about my willingness to be a pawn in whatever game you're playing."
"No games, Angel." The old nickname slipped out with practiced casualness. "Just a chance to finally break free from a marriage that's holding you back."
We pulled up to the Plaza Hotel's private entrance, where an attentive valet waited to take the keys. Christopher rounded the car to open my door, offering his hand with that same carefully calculated gallantry.
"Shall we give them something to talk about?" he murmured, nodding subtly toward a group of Morgan Stanley executives entering the hotel.
I accepted his hand with a slight shake of my head. "You're impossible."
"I prefer the term 'strategic.'" He guided me through the lobby with a proprietary hand at the small of my back. "Besides, news travels fast in our circles. I'd say we have about twenty minutes before Sean makes his dramatic entrance."
The maître d' led us to a private corner table with sweeping views of Central Park. Christopher held my chair with practiced ease, then settled across from me with an air of satisfaction.
"You seem very certain about Sean's reaction," I observed, studying the menu without really seeing it.
"Sean Shaw has always been predictable in matters of possession." Christopher signaled the sommelier with a subtle gesture. "He may claim he wants a divorce, may even convince himself he's in love with Christina, but the moment he thinks he's losing you..." He let the thought hang unfinished.
"I'm not interested in playing games with my marriage," I said firmly, though something in Christopher's confident manner made me uneasy.
"No games necessary." He leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping to an intimate murmur. "Just truth. Tell me, Angela - in all your years of marriage, has Sean ever fought for you the way he fights for Christina?"
The question hit harder than I expected, forcing me to look away. Christopher reached across the table, his fingers brushing mine with deliberate gentleness.
"Let me help you," he said softly. "You deserve better than being someone's backup plan."
Before I could respond, a commotion at the restaurant entrance drew our attention. Sean stood in the doorway, his usual polished appearance slightly disheveled, eyes scanning the room with barely contained fury.
Christopher's lips curved into a satisfied smile. "Right on schedule," he murmured, his hand still covering mine on the table. "Now, Angel, the real question is - are you ready to take control of your own story?"
Sean's gaze locked onto our table, his jaw tightening visibly at the sight of Christopher's intimate gesture. As he strode toward us with purposeful steps, I felt the weight of the moment settle around me like a heavy cloak.
The time for playing roles was over. Whatever happened next would reshape all our lives - I just wasn't sure if I was ready for the consequences of truth.
"Take your hands off my wife." Sean's voice carried clearly across the hushed restaurant, drawing curious glances from nearby diners.
Christopher didn't move, his amber eyes holding mine with quiet intensity.
 "I believe that decision belongs to Angela, doesn't it?"
###chapter 90: I’ll Fulfill My duties As Your Husband Right Now!
Angela POV
Christopher's amber eyes held mine with quiet intensity across the elegant expanse of the Plaza's private dining room. "I believe that decision belongs to Angela, doesn't it?"
Sean's presence seemed to fill the entire space, his barely contained fury radiating like heat. The other diners had fallen silent, sensing the tension crackling between the three of us.
"Take. Your. Hands. Off. My. Wife." Each word dropped like ice from Sean's lips.
Christopher's fingers remained gentle but firm around mine. "You seem upset, old friend. Perhaps you'd like to join us for lunch? We were just discussing the fascinating topic of marriage contracts."
I watched Sean's jaw clench, the muscle ticking beneath his skin. Without warning, Sean strode forward and landed a solid punch across Christopher's face. The sudden violence sent ripples of shock through the elegant dining room.
"Sean!" I quickly pulled away from Christopher's grasp and positioned myself between them, glaring at Sean. "What do you think you're doing?"
Sean's expression darkened further at my intervention. "You're actually protecting him?" His voice trembled with barely contained rage. "Get out of my way!"
I glanced around the restaurant, noting the growing crowd of spectators. Several had already pulled out their phones, eagerly waiting to capture more drama between Manhattan's elite.
"Come home with me!" Sean commanded.
Christopher leaned back in his chair, studying Sean with that maddeningly calm expression he'd perfected.
"I don't believe Angela has finished her lunch. And we were in the middle of quite an important discussion about her future."
"Her future?" Sean's laugh held no humor. "And I suppose you see yourself playing a significant role in that future, Blake?"
"That depends entirely on Angela, doesn't it?" Christopher's gaze shifted to me, carrying a weight of unspoken meaning. "Unlike some, I believe she's perfectly capable of making her own choices."
"Enough." I stood, smoothing my skirt with practiced composure. "You're both acting like children. Christopher, thank you for lunch, but I think it's best if I handle this privately."
"Angel-" Christopher started to rise, but I held up a hand to stop him.
"Please." I met his eyes, hoping he could read the silent message there. "I need to do this my way."
Something shifted in his expression-understanding, perhaps, or resignation. He nodded once, settling back into his chair. "Of course. But remember what we discussed. You always have choices."
Sean's hand found the small of my back as we walked toward the exit, his touch possessive enough to make me bristle. The moment we cleared the restaurant doors, I stepped away from him.
"I can walk perfectly well on my own."
"Can you?" His voice carried an edge I rarely heard. "Tell me, Angela, how long has this been going on? Was he always part of your exit strategy?"
The accusation stung more than I wanted to admit. "Don't you dare. You're the one who's been carrying on with Christina this entire time. At least Christopher has never pretended to be anything other than what he is."
"And what exactly is he to you?"
The question hung between us, heavy with implications. Through the lobby's revolving doors, I could see Sean's Bentley waiting at the curb, Peter standing at attention beside it.
"Take me home," I said finally, exhaustion seeping into my voice. "If you want to have this conversation, we'll have it there. Not here, not like this."
As soon as our penthouse door closed behind us, Sean rounded on me. "Well? We're home now. Let's hear it. What exactly is going on between you and Christopher?"
"Nothing is 'going on,'" I snapped, hanging my coat with more force than necessary. "He's been a friend when I needed one. That's all."
"A friend?" Sean's laugh was harsh. "Is that what you call the way he looks at you? The way he touches you every chance he gets?"
"That's none of your business！"
"You're my wife!"
"HaHave you ever fulfilled your duties as a husband?"
I pushed him, but he yanked me back and pinned me against the sofa.
"If that's the case, I'll fulfill my duties as your husband right now!" He leaned down and began kissing me.
"Sean, what are you doing? Go fuck Christina! I'm not your sex toy!"
"My relationship with Christina is pure and innocent. She's nothing like you-so shameless!"
"Let go of me." My voice shook slightly.
"No."
He bites my lip, the sting bringing my focus back to him. He's switched to pining my arms with just one hand, his other sliding up my shirt.
With practiced ease he unclips my bra and cups my breast, giving a sharp squeeze and I gasp.
He hums tugging my shirt up before he bites at my nipple, then soothes the sting with his tongue.
Another bite causes me to arch forward, the look on his face makes me suspect there will be more. Sean stares into my eyes as he unfastens my jeans and slides them down.
He eases my panties off and starts caressing my thighs. Then again, higher to start touching me at my most sensitive area.
He grips me harder, circles my clit and flicks up over it and my breath catches.
"Stop！" I hiss when Sean tries pushing two fingers inside me, without warning or lubrication.
He doesn't listen, using three of his larger fingers to push inside and stroke until I squirm from discomfort.
"I can't do this anymore." I tried to pull away, but he held firm. "I can't keep pretending-"
"Pretending what?" His other hand came up to cup my face, forcing me to meet his gaze. "That you don't feel anything for me? That every time I touch you, your breath doesn't catch? That when I kiss you-"
A slap landed before he could finish. This time when I yanked my hand back, he let me go.
"I love him." The words fell between us like stones into still water. "I love Christopher."
Sean went completely still, his face draining of color. "What did you say?"
"I love him." Each word felt like glass in my throat, but I forced them out anyway. "He loves me too. Has for years, apparently." I laughed, the sound brittle. "He was just waiting for me to be free."
Something dangerous flashed in his eyes. Without warning, he turned and strode toward the door.
"Where are you going?"
"Out." He paused with his hand on the doorknob. "Have your papers ready in the morning. We'll go to the courthouse first thing."
###chapter 91: Enjoy Your Freedom
Angela POV
The morning air bit through my thin blazer as I stood beside Sean's Bentley in the private parking garage of our Park Avenue apartment.
My breath formed delicate clouds in the frigid December air, a reminder of how quickly the seasons had changed. Just like my marriage.
Sean opened the passenger door with mechanical precision, his movements deliberately lacking their usual protective warmth.
As I slid into the leather seat, I noticed the temperature controls set to their lowest setting despite the winter chill.
A small cruelty, perhaps, but one that spoke volumes about his current state of mind.
The Bentley purred to life, its powerful engine the only sound breaking the heavy silence between us.
As we merged onto Park Avenue, I watched the city prepare for Christmas - storefront windows dressed in holiday splendor, wreaths adorning elegant doorways, twinkling lights strung across bare tree branches.
The festive atmosphere felt like a mockery of our current mission.
We maintained our silence as the car wound through the city streets.
We passed couples walking hand in hand, shopping bags swinging between them, faces bright with holiday cheer.
I forced myself to look away, focusing instead on the folder in my lap containing our divorce papers.
Two years of marriage reduced to a handful of legal documents.
The New York County Supreme Court building loomed ahead, its limestone facade stark against the winter sky.
Sean handed the Bentley's keys to the valet with practiced ease, maintaining a careful distance from me as we climbed the courthouse steps.
"Before we proceed," the judge began, her experienced eyes moving between us, "I must remind you that this dissolution agreement is irreversible once finalized. Your joint assets and business interests will be permanently divided according to the terms outlined in your settlement."
I kept my spine straight, my voice steady. "We understand, Your Honor. Please continue."
I felt Sean's gaze on me but refused to meet it.
Instead, I watched as the judge methodically reviewed our paperwork, each turning page marking another step toward freedom - or emptiness, depending on how you looked at it.
"Very well." The judge's voice carried years of witnessing similar scenes. "Mr. Shaw, if you'll sign here."
Sean's Mont Blanc pen moved across the paper with decisive strokes. No hesitation, no last-minute change of heart.
Just the scratch of metal against paper, marking the end of our union.
"Mrs. Shaw - or should I say, Ms. Wilson?"
I accepted the pen, its weight suddenly significant in my hand. For a moment, I allowed myself to remember:
The way Sean had looked at me during our first meeting at Wilson Investment Bank.
The quiet moments in our shared library, even the silent comfort of his presence during Elizabeth's surgery.
Then I signed, my signature as crisp and professional as ever.
"Congratulations," the judge said, though her tone carried no celebration. "You are now legally separated. The divorce will be finalized in three months, assuming no objections are filed."
Outside on the courthouse steps, the holiday bustle continued unabated. Tourists snapped photos of the courthouse's grand architecture, office workers hurried past with coffee cups clutched in gloved hands, and couples strolled by arm in arm, their laughter carrying on the winter wind.
"Thank you," I said quietly, turning to face Sean one last time.
His expression remained carefully blank, but something flickered in his eyes - regret? Anger? I couldn't tell anymore.
"Enjoy your freedom," he said flatly, then turned and descended the steps without looking back.
I stood alone, watching his tall figure disappear into the crowd.
The facade I'd maintained throughout the proceedings began to crack, my breath coming in short, sharp gasps that had nothing to do with the cold.
I pressed my fingers against my lips, fighting back the threat of tears.
A familiar black Mercedes pulled up to the curb, and Christopher emerged, moving with quiet purpose through the crowd. Without a word, he draped his cashmere coat over my shoulders.
"Shedding so many tears over a business arrangement seems excessive," he murmured, though his tone held no judgment. His hand ghosted over my back, providing subtle support without drawing attention.
"Remember your condition," he added softly as he guided me toward the car. "Stress isn't good for either of you right now."
I allowed myself to be led away from the courthouse, away from the curious stares and whispered speculations. Christopher's presence was steady, undemanding - exactly what I needed in this moment.
Sitting in the car, my tears fell uncontrollably despite my best efforts to maintain composure.
Christopher remained silent, simply offering his quiet presence.
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a white silk handkerchief, then turned toward me, gently wiping away the tears from my face. His movements were incredibly gentle, as if he were handling a delicate piece of porcelain.
I glanced up at him, and for the first time, I noticed the bruising along his jaw and the corner of his mouth - remnants of Sean's punch from yesterday.
The sight made me collect myself, and I whispered an apology, "I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble lately."
He smiled softly. "You've never been trouble to me." After a moment's pause, he added in a gentle tone, "You know, we could leave the city for a while. Take some time away from all of this."
I nodded slowly, realizing I had indeed been considering leaving this city. Not just the city, but the country entirely. Of course, there were still matters I needed to handle first.
"Could you take me to Sophie's place?" I asked Christopher.
###chapter 92: The Day It All Ended
Sean POV
The streets of Manhattan were alive with Christmas preparations as I descended the courthouse steps.
My hands wouldn't stop trembling as I pushed through the holiday crowds.
Salvation Army bells rang out nearby, their cheerful sound mixing with carols drifting from storefronts, creating a cacophony that made me want to scream.
All I could really hear anyway was the echo of Angela's voice from the night before:
"I love him. I love Christopher."
The words had haunted me through my sleepless night, and now they seemed to reverberate with each step I took away from the courthouse.
Away from her. My fingers clenched involuntarily, the ghost of her signature on those damned papers burning into my mind.
I forced myself to keep walking, to not turn around.
I knew if I did, I might see Christopher waiting for her - Christopher, who had apparently loved her for years.
Christopher, who had been patient enough to wait for the perfect moment. Christopher, who now had everything I had foolishly taken for granted.
I arrived at the parking lot, got into the car, and finally found a moment of peace.
The moment I closed the car door, a sharp pain shot through my chest. My vision blurred slightly as I reached for my phone, hitting Peter's number on speed dial.
"Sir?" Peter's voice came through clear and professional.
"I need..." I paused, drawing in a ragged breath. "I need you to pick up the car. "
"Of course, Mr. Shaw. I'll be there in ten minutes."
I don't think I should be driving right now.
A thought came unbidden, unwelcome. I pushed it away, along with the urge to run back up those courthouse steps and... and what?
Demand answers?
Beg her to reconsider?
I was Sean Shaw, CEO of Shaw Group. I didn't beg.
***
Evening found me in my private study at the Park Avenue penthouse, surrounded by the trappings of power that suddenly meant nothing.
The photograph of Angela that had always sat in the corner - a candid shot from a charity gala where she'd been laughing at something Elizabeth had said - lay face down.
I couldn't bear to look at it. Couldn't bear to see the happiness in her eyes and wonder if it had ever been real.
The knock at my door was sharp. Only one person would dare interrupt me tonight.
"Enter," I called out, not bothering to look up from the untouched glass of scotch in my hand.
Victoria's heels clicked against the hardwood floors as she approached my desk. "Where is she?"
My grip tightened on the glass. "Gone."
"Gone where, Sean? What did you do?"
"What did I do?" I laughed, the sound harsh and foreign to my own ears. "I gave her exactly what she wanted - freedom to be with the man she actually loves."
"The man she..." Victoria's voice trailed off as understanding dawned. "Christopher Blake? Those rumors are real?"
My response was to drain my glass in one burning swallow.
"You're a fool," Victoria said quietly. "A blind, stubborn fool who can't see what's right in front of him."
"I saw plenty," I snapped, pushing to my feet. "I saw the way he looked at her, touched her. I saw how she defended him, chose him over me again and again. I saw-"
"You saw what your jealousy wanted you to see," Victoria cut in. "Did you ever once ask her how she felt? Really asked, without accusations or assumptions?"
"She told me herself!" The words exploded from me as I slammed the glass down on my desk. "She said she loved him!"
"And you believed her?" Victoria's eyebrow arched delicately. "The woman who's spent two years protecting your reputation, supporting your grandmother, building a life with you despite your obvious affair with Christina - you really think she'd suddenly throw all that away for Christopher Blake?"
My phone buzzed on the desk - Christina's name flashing on the screen for the tenth time that evening. I ignored it, just as I'd ignored all her previous calls.
"Leave me alone ,Please." I said quietly, dangerously.
Victoria moved toward the door but paused in the doorway. "You know what your real problem is, Sean? "
"Please ,Mother, Just... get out."
The door closed behind her with a soft click. I stood motionless for a long moment, then slowly reached for the bottle of scotch. My hand trembled as I poured, drops spilling onto the mahogany desk.
My Montblanc pen - a gift from Angela on our first anniversary - caught my eye. Without thinking, I grabbed it and hurled it across the room. It hit the wall with a satisfying crack, ink splattering like blood against the cream-colored paint.
My phone buzzed again. Christina's face smiled up at me from the screen, and suddenly I couldn't bear to look at it anymore. With one sweep of my arm, I sent the phone flying off my desk, along with half the merger documents.
I was too focused on breathing through the tightness in my chest, trying not to picture Angela in Christopher's arms or remember how she'd looked at me yesterday and said those three words that broke me.
The city lights twinkled beyond my floor-to-ceiling windows, a million stars that seemed to mock my solitude.
Somewhere out there, Angela was probably with Christopher now. Planning their future. Laughing about how easily I had let her go.
###chapter 93: The Last Goodbye
Angela POV
Morning sunlight filtered through Sophie's guest room curtains, casting unfamiliar shadows across my temporary bed.
My phone buzzed on the nightstand, and I felt my heart stutter at the sight of Sean's name illuminating the screen.
"When will you come get your things?" His voice carried an edge I couldn't quite name-bitterness, perhaps, or regret.
"I'll stop by this afternoon," I replied, fighting to keep my voice steady. "Unless that's inconvenient for you?"
"Do whatever you want." The line went dead before I could respond.
I pressed my fingers against my temples, fighting back the familiar ache that seemed to accompany every interaction with Sean these days.
The day ahead loomed large-Elizabeth was expecting my visit, and then there was the daunting task of packing up two years of married life into whatever pieces I could bear to take with me.
***
The hospital corridor stretched longer than usual as I made my way to Elizabeth's room. Her face brightened when she saw me, though I caught the concern shadowing her eyes.
"You look tired, dear," she observed, patting the space beside her bed. "Come, tell me about your day."
I settled into the familiar chair, sharing small stories about Sophie's cat knocking over a vase, about the barista who always remembered my order-anything except the truth weighing heavy on my chest.
Elizabeth listened with that knowing smile that had always made me wonder how much she really understood.
"You know," she said softly as her eyes began to drift closed, "sometimes the bravest thing we can do is admit when something isn't working." She squeezed my hand gently before sleep claimed her.
I sat there a moment longer, watching the peaceful rise and fall of her chest.
The sound of footsteps in the doorway made me turn-Sean stood there, his expression unreadable.
Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and his usual impeccable appearance seemed somehow diminished, as if he hadn't been sleeping well.
He opened his mouth slightly, then closed it again, whatever words he'd meant to say dying before they reached his lips.
It struck me as odd, seeing him like this. Shouldn't he be happy now? Free to be with Christina openly?
But then I remembered Victoria's stern disapproval, the way she'd made her feelings about Christina crystal clear. Perhaps that was the source of his obvious exhaustion-caught between his mother's expectations and his heart's desire.
Our eyes met briefly before I rose, slipping past him without a word.
That familiar citrus scent that always clung to him wafted between us, achingly intimate yet somehow foreign now.
***
The penthouse felt different now, though nothing had physically changed. Sarah greeted me with worried eyes and an offered cup of  a steaming cup. "Your favorite cinnamon apple tea, Mrs. Shaw. Or should I..." she trailed off, uncertainty coloring her voice.
"Thank you, Sarah." I accepted the cup with a small smile. "But Ms. Wilson is fine now."
I moved through the rooms with purpose, collecting only what I couldn't bear to leave behind-my mother's jewelry box, a few cherished books, the cashmere sweater I'd worn on cold mornings in the library.
Everything else could stay.
They were just things, after all, and I had no desire to strip the walls bare of my presence.
James, the building manager, approached me as I waited for the elevator. He held out an envelope with careful reverence.
"Mrs. Shaw," he said with his usual formal warmth, "I hope you don't mind, but I wanted to give you your Christmas gift early this year."
Inside the card was a delicate hand-drawn sketch of Sean and me, arms linked as we walked through the building's entrance. The detail was remarkable-the way Sean's hand rested protectively at my elbow, the slight tilt of my head as I smiled up at him.
A moment from happier days, captured in gentle pencil strokes.
"I've been working on it for a while," James explained, a hint of pride in his voice. "I hope you like it."
I smiled, carefully tucking the card into my bag.
"It's beautiful, James. Thank you." The words caught slightly in my throat, but I managed to keep my voice steady.
I couldn't bring myself to tell him that the couple in his drawing no longer existed, that the woman who smiled so trustingly up at her husband was already gone.
That card, I thought as the elevator doors closed between us, would probably be the only proof of my two-year marriage that I'd take with me.
Standing in what had been our bedroom one last time, I allowed myself a moment to remember: morning light streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows, quiet Sunday breakfasts on the terrace, the way Sean's cologne would linger in the air long after he'd left for work.
Two years of memories, both bitter and sweet, wrapped in silk and cashmere and Egyptian cotton.
Silent tears slid down my cheeks, blurring everything before me into a soft, indistinct haze of colors and shapes-as if the room itself was fading away, just like the life I had built here.
***
Sophie's apartment welcomed me back with the comfort of friendship and understanding.
"I think I need to leave for a while," I admitted as we sat in her cozy kitchen. "Not forever, just... until things settle."
"I know." Her eyes were soft with sympathy. "I've been expecting this conversation."
The knock at the door announced Christopher's arrival. He entered with his usual quiet grace, though something in his expression suggested news beyond a casual visit.
"I saw your father yesterday," he said without preamble. "He sends his love. And his understanding." He settled into a chair, his amber eyes meeting mine.
"He also mentioned that the villa in Tuscany is empty this time of year. If you're interested in a change of scenery."
Sophie busied herself with packing snacks for my journey, her movements betraying the emotion she was trying to hide.
"You'll need something for the flight," she insisted, tucking homemade cookies into a paper bag.
The city lights were just beginning to twinkle to life as Christopher's car pulled up to the airport terminal.
Sophie's embrace was fierce, her whispered "Call me, promise you'll call me" making my eyes sting with tears.
"I promise," I whispered back, holding my friend close one last time.
Standing at the gate, I turned for one final look at the city skyline. Somewhere out there, Sean was probably in his office, Christina by his side. Elizabeth was sleeping peacefully in her hospital room.
Sarah was perhaps already rearranging the penthouse to Sean's preferences. Life would go on, with or without my presence.
Christopher touched my elbow gently. "Ready?"
I squared my shoulders, adjusting my carry-on bag. The weight of my wedding ring was conspicuously absent from my left hand, but my steps felt lighter than they had in months.
 "Yes," I said softly, "I think I am."
As the plane lifted into the darkening sky, I watched Manhattan's lights grow smaller until they were just a glittering carpet below.
Somewhere in that maze of light and shadow was the life I was leaving behind-the marriage that had started as a business arrangement and ended in heartbreak, the man I had learned to love despite myself, and the dreams I had carefully packed away with my winter clothes.
My hand drifted to my stomach, where our secret still grew, as I watched the city lights fade into the distance.
"Goodbye, New York," I whispered softly, my breath fogging the plane window. "Goodbye to everything that was."
Goodbye, Sean...
###chapter 94: When She's Gone
Sean POV
I stood in the private elevator for what felt like hours, my finger hovering over the penthouse button.
The thought of stepping into that empty space-knowing Angela wouldn't be there-made my chest tighten painfully.
No more gentle scent of her jasmine tea wafting through the halls, no soft click of her heels against the marble floors, no warm smile welcoming me home.
When I finally forced myself to press the button, each floor the elevator passed felt like another weight added to my shoulders.
The doors opened to reveal our-no, my penthouse now. Even the air felt different, heavier somehow, as if the very space knew its heart had been torn out.
Sarah emerged from the kitchen, her usual warm smile replaced by careful neutrality. "Welcome home, Mr. Shaw. Would you like dinner?"
"Did she... did she come back today?" I tried to keep my voice steady, though the words felt thick in my throat.
"Yes, Mr. Shaw," Sarah's voice was gentle, almost pitying. "Mrs. Shaw came by this afternoon to collect some of her belongings." She hesitated, then added softly, "She didn't stay long."
I nodded curtly, loosening my tie as I strode toward our master suite. The bedroom door swung open silently, revealing a space that looked almost unchanged at first glance.
But the small absences began to register: her tablet missing from the bedside table, the vanity cleared of her elegant perfume bottles, the chair where she often sat to read now bare of her cashmere throw.
My eyes caught on something glinting on the dresser.
The check I'd written her lay untouched, alongside the platinum credit card Mother had insisted she keep "for emergencies." Beside them, catching the last rays of sunset through our floor-to-ceiling windows, lay her wedding ring.
I picked up the ring with trembling fingers. Michael had helped me choose it-a custom Cartier design with a cushion-cut diamond that had reminded me of starlight caught in crystal.
I'd never told Angela that I'd spent weeks selecting it, even though our marriage was supposed to be just a business arrangement.
The walk-in closet still held her evening gowns-dozens of them, each carefully chosen for various corporate events and charity galas.
My fingers brushed against a midnight blue Valentino she'd worn to last year's Metropolitan Opera gala. She'd been radiant that night, drawing admiring glances from New York's elite while maintaining that quiet dignity that set her apart from the usual social climbers.
In the back of a drawer, I found our wedding photo, carefully preserved.
Angela's face glowed with a mix of nervousness and something else-something I'd been too blind to recognize at the time.
I remembered how her hands had trembled slightly as we'd exchanged rings, how she'd smiled up at me with such trust in her eyes.
I collapsed onto our bed, overwhelmed by the lingering traces of her presence-the subtle scent of her lavender body wash still clinging to the pillows, the dog-eared novel on her nightstand marking the page she'd never finish.
Each detail felt like a precise cut, small but devastating in its finality.
Anger, grief, and regret warred in my chest as I stared at the ceiling. The weight of my choices-every moment I'd chosen Christina over Angela, every time I'd dismissed her feelings or taken her loyalty for granted-pressed down on me like a physical force.
My phone felt heavy in my hand as I pulled up Angela's number. I'd rehearsed the words carefully: "You left some things here. They're taking up space. If you don't come get them, I'll have them thrown out."
A petty threat, but one that might at least get her to respond.
The call went straight to voicemail. So did the second. And the third.
Frustration mounted as I switched to Christopher's number, only to receive the same response. The image of them together somewhere, deliberately ignoring my calls, made my blood boil.
I hurled my phone across the room, taking grim satisfaction in the crack of its impact against the wall.
***
Morning brought no relief.
The Shaw Tower offices seemed off-kilter, Angela's absence creating a void that even the usual bustle of corporate life couldn't fill.
I found myself staring at her empty desk through my office window, remembering how she'd organize my schedule with quiet efficiency, anticipating my needs before I could voice them.
"Michael," I called out, my voice sharper than intended. "I need you to locate Angela's current whereabouts."
His response was unexpectedly cold. "I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Shaw." He placed two folders on my desk with precise movements.
"I'm here to submit my resignation, effective immediately."
"Resignation?" My mind struggled to process this latest betrayal. "Why?"
"Personal reasons." His tone remained professionally distant as he gestured to the second folder. "Mrs. Wilson prepared this transition guide before her departure. She's outlined all ongoing projects and included detailed handover notes."
My jaw clenched at the mention of her maiden name. "She promised to stay on at the company, even after-"
"If I may speak freely, sir," Michael interrupted, his usual deference giving way to barely contained disapproval,
 "you've lost not only an exceptional wife but an invaluable executive assistant."
He paused at the door, adding quietly, "Though I suspect you'll only realize the true extent of that loss once it's too late."
***
The address Peter provided led to a brownstone in the West Village, its windows glowing warmly against the gathering darkness.
Sophie answered my knock with visible hostility, her usual fashionable poise replaced by defensive anger.
"What do you want?" she demanded, blocking the doorway with her slight frame.
"Is she here?" I fought to keep my voice steady. "She left things at the penthouse. If she doesn't collect them-"
"Throw them out." Her laugh held no humor. "She won't be needing them where she's gone."
The words hit me like a physical blow. "Gone? What do you mean, gone?"
"She's left the country, Sean." Sophie's eyes glittered with a mix of satisfaction and protective fury. "And before you ask, no, I won't tell you where. The best thing you can do for her now is leave her alone. You've caused her enough pain."
My legs gave way, and I found myself sinking to my knees on Sophie's doorstep.
The finality of it-Angela not just gone from our home or our marriage, but from the country entirely-made it hard to breathe.
The sound of Sophie's door closing echoed with devastating finality, leaving me alone with the realization that this time, Angela was truly beyond my reach.
The girl who had been in my life since childhood, who would argue with me over everything from stock picks to coffee brands, who somehow always knew exactly what I needed before I did-was actually gone.
"Angela..." I whispered into the empty night, "why did you have to be so cruel?"
###chapter 95: She Left You, But I'm Still Here
Sean POV
The amber liquid in my glass caught the city lights streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows of my Shaw Tower office, casting dancing shadows across the polished mahogany desk.
I couldn't remember how many drinks I'd had. Three? Four? The bottle Peter had left before departing was nearly empty now.
My phone lay silent and dark beside me. Christopher finally answered my call after dozens of attempts. His voice came through cold and distant, each word deliberately chosen to wound.
"If Angela wanted you to know where she was," he said with calculated indifference, "she would tell you herself. Clearly, she doesn't want you to know where she is or who she's with. It's no longer any of your concern."
His mockery cut deep, reminding me yet again that I had lost her-perhaps forever.
The door creaked open behind me. Soft footsteps approached from behind, quiet but deliberate against the hardwood floors. For a moment, my alcohol-addled brain played a cruel trick. I could almost smell Angela's signature lily of the valley perfume, could almost feel her presence...
"Sean?"
The voice was wrong. Too high, too breathy. But in my drunken haze, I reached out anyway, pulling the figure into my arms.
"Don't go," I whispered, burying my face in soft hair that should have smelled of lily of the valley but didn't. "Please, just... don't go."
Arms wrapped around me, eager and insistent where they should have been gentle and hesitant. "I'm here, Sean. I'll never leave you."
Something felt wrong. The height, the scent, the way she pressed against me-all wrong. I pulled back slightly, forcing my eyes to focus.
Red hair gleamed in the dim light where there should have been midnight black. Christina's face smiled up at me, her lips parted invitingly as she leaned in.
"I'm sorry..." I shoved her away, perhaps harder than I meant to, sending her stumbling back against my desk.
The night was a blur, the alcohol numbing my senses as I stumbled back into my empty apartment, haunted by memories of Angela. Suddenly, the doorbell rang. I opened the door, and Christina stood before me.
"Christina? What are you doing here?" I slurred, my voice thick with whiskey.
"I heard about you and Angela..." she trailed off, her eyes filled with a mix of concern and something else I couldn't quite decipher.
Overwhelmed by grief, I pulled her into a hug, muttering Angela's name. Christina didn't resist, letting me hold her until I snapped back to reality, realizing it wasn't Angela in my arms.
I pushed her away, a mix of guilt and confusion washing over me. "I'm sorry, I..."
"It's okay," she whispered, a glint of something mischievous in her eyes.
She stepped closer, her fingers tracing a line down my chest, lingering at the open buttons of my shirt. Her gaze was intense, a blend of desire and something predatory.
"You're drunk, you need someone to take care of you," she purred, her voice a soothing lie.
Her hand slipped under my shirt, her touch both cool and burning against my skin. Her body pressed against mine, the soft swell of her breasts a stark contrast to my own hard chest.
I tried to pull away, but she was like a vine, wrapping herself around me. Her lips found mine, a taste of sweetness mixed with the bitter tang of my whiskey.
She nipped at my earlobe, her voice a low murmur against my skin. "Don't fight me, tonight, I'll be your Angela."
Her hand moved lower, undoing my belt buckle. I gasped, a shiver running down my spine.
But then, clarity washed over me.
"Get out." The words came out as a growl.
"Sean!" Christina's voice cracked with hurt. "Why are you pushing me away? She's gone! Angela left you, but I'm still here. I'm the one who truly loves you!"
"GET OUT!"
She fled, tears streaming down her face. The door slammed behind her with a finality that echoed through my chest. I collapsed back into my chair, the room spinning slightly as I reached for the bottle again.
The sound of my glass shattering against the wall surprised even me.
***
"Sean?" Father's voice carried clear concern as I stumbled into the penthouse's foyer the next morning, my head pounding with each heartbeat. "Peter called to say he had to drive you home last night. What happened?"
"Alexander, let me handle this." Mother's tone was sharp with barely contained fury. She rounded on me, her elegant features tight with disappointment.
"What were you thinking, drinking yourself into a stupor at the office? You're the CEO of Shaw Group, for heaven's sake!"
I made my way to the bar, fumbling for aspirin in the cabinet above.
"Angela's gone."
"Gone where?" Mother's voice softened slightly.
"Out of the country." The words felt like glass in my throat. "Sophie won't tell me where. Says I've caused her enough pain already."
I turned to my mother, a bitter laugh escaping my lips.
"Have I really hurt her, Mother? She never loved me-it was Christopher she loved all along. How could I have hurt someone who never cared about me in the first place?"
"Oh, Sean." Mother's sigh held years of maternal exasperation. "Why don't you take some time off? Clear your head?"
"I'm fine." I swallowed the pills dry, wincing at the bitter taste. "The Morrison merger needs attention, and the board meeting-"
"Forget the board meeting," Father cut in. "You're in no state to-"
"I said I'm fine." My voice came out sharper than intended. "I don't need time off. I need to work."
The days that followed blurred together in a haze of meetings and merger documents.
Michael's replacement-his's cousin Thomas-proved frustratingly incompetent, constantly mixing up appointments and filing reports incorrectly.
Each mistake was a sharp reminder of the precision with which Angela had managed everything.
***
Christmas arrived with bitter winds and swirling snow, the city dressed in holiday splendor that felt like a mockery of my emptiness.
I stood in Father's study, phone pressed to my ear as I listened to it ring.
"Wilson residence." A maid's crisp voice answered.
"This is Sean Shaw. I'd like to speak with Mr. Wilson, please."
A long pause followed, then John Wilson's cool voice came through. "Sean."
"Sir, I..." I cleared my throat. "I wanted to wish you Merry Christmas. And if Angela is there with you..."
"She isn't." His tone could have frozen hell. "Is that all?"
"Please, if you speak to her... tell her..." The words stuck in my throat. What could I possibly say that would matter now?
"Goodbye, Sean." The line went dead.
I found myself wandering through the penthouse later that night, a glass of scotch in hand.
The Christmas tree in the corner-decorated by the staff this year-seemed dimmer somehow, its lights casting shallow shadows where they should have danced.
Last Christmas, Angela had insisted on decorating it herself.
I remembered finding her balanced precariously on a ladder, trying to place the star at the top. When I'd lifted her down, she'd laughed, her eyes sparkling with joy as she'd wrapped her arms around my neck...
"Sean?" Elizabeth's voice pulled me from the memory. She stood in her wheelchair, Victoria hovering protectively behind her.
"What are you doing sitting here alone in the dark?"
"Just thinking, Grandmother."
"About Angela?" Her voice carried no judgment, only understanding. "You know, when your grandfather left me, I thought my world had ended. But do you know what got me through it?"
I turned to face her, surprised by this revelation about my long-deceased grandfather.
"What?"
"The knowledge that I had done everything I could to save what mattered." She wheeled closer, her aged hand finding mine with surprising strength.
"Can you say the same, Sean?"
The question hit like a physical blow. Had I done everything I could? Or had I been too blind, too caught up in old debts and misplaced loyalty to see what I was losing until it was too late?
"I couldn't sleep," Elizabeth continued softly, "I miss her like you do."
I realized it wasn't just me who lost Angela-it was all of us. My parents, my grandmother, even Sarah, who's barely said a word these last few days.
###chapter 96: The Twins
Angela POV
Five Years Later
"Mama, is it time? Can we start now?" Aria bounced on her toes, her dark curls dancing around her cherubic face as she peered up at me with wide, expectant eyes.
I checked the time on my phone before nodding. "Yes, sweetheart. The Instagram Live can start now." I adjusted the camera angle on the tripod, making sure the rustic Tuscan kitchen was properly framed behind my eager five-year-olds.
These cooking livestreams had been entirely Aria's idea-my little social butterfly had seen a child chef on television six months ago and declared she wanted to "be famous on the internet too." I always stayed carefully out of frame, preferring to keep my own face off social media.
"Remember our rules?" I asked, raising an eyebrow at both children.
"Be polite to viewers," Ethan recited solemnly, his emerald eyes serious as he straightened his little chef's hat. "No shouting. Follow the recipe steps."
"And have fun!" Aria added with a giggle, already reaching for her matching hat.
I smiled, touching each of their cheeks affectionately. "Perfect. I'll be right here if you need me."
I stepped back, tapping the screen to start the broadcast. Within seconds, viewers began flooding in, sending cheerful greetings and heart emojis as the twins' cooking show began.
"Buongiorno, everyone!" Aria waved enthusiastically, her smile revealing a missing front tooth. "Today, Ethan and I are making risotto ai frutti di mare!"
"That's seafood risotto," Ethan explained more formally, already measuring rice with practiced precision. "It's one of Mama's special recipes."
I watched from behind the camera, a warm glow of pride spreading through my chest.
The twins had taken to these weekly cooking sessions with surprising enthusiasm, each bringing their distinct personalities to the show that had unexpectedly gained a dedicated following over the past few months.
The broadcast continued smoothly until Aria, in her excitement to add the shrimp, accidentally knocked one onto the floor.
"Oh no!" Aria's bottom lip trembled as she stared at the fallen shrimp. She glanced up at the camera, then at her brother, eyes suddenly swimming with tears.
Before I could intervene, Ethan was already beside his sister, his small hand on her shoulder.
"It's okay, Aria," he said firmly. "But you shouldn't eat the shrimp anyway. Remember what happened last time? Your face got all puffy."
Aria's lip quivered. "But I love shrimp."
"Your health is more important," Ethan replied with a seriousness that seemed beyond his years. "No shrimp for you. I'll eat your portion."
I watched the exchange with a mixture of amusement and something deeper, a faint ache that never quite disappeared.
Ethan was so much like him sometimes-the same protective instinct, the same decisive tone that brooked no argument.
Aria pouted momentarily before nodding, accepting her brother's verdict with surprising grace. "Fine. I'll have extra scallops instead."
Comments flooded the live feed: "These kids are SO precious!" "Ethan is such a protective big brother!" "Aria's pout is everything!"
I smiled, scrolling through the stream of messages until a notification caught my eye: NightShadow has joined.
Almost immediately, virtual gifts began appearing on screen. Gold stars, animated applause, and premium emojis poured in-all from the same user.
Ethan noticed immediately. "Mr. Shadow is here again," he announced, straightening his little chef hat. "Thank you for the gifts, sir, but Mama says you don't need to send so many."
Aria, however, beamed directly into the camera. "Thank you, super generous Shadow mister!" She made a heart shape with her tiny hands. "We're making your favorite risotto today!"
I felt a familiar tension creep up my spine.
NightShadow had been following their broadcasts for several months now, never commenting but always sending extravagant gifts. I'd tried to block the account once, only to have both twins upset over losing their "biggest fan."
Something about this anonymous donor made me uneasy, though I couldn't exactly pinpoint why.
The cooking demonstration continued, with Ethan methodically stirring the risotto while Aria added ingredients with theatrical flair. As they plated their creation and took ceremonial bites for the camera, the view count surpassed twenty thousand.
"Delizioso!" Aria declared with an exaggerated Italian accent.
"Thank you for watching," Ethan said politely. "See you next week for our special chocolate cake recipe."
I ended the broadcast and both children immediately slid from their kitchen stools, rushing into my waiting arms.
"Did we do good, Mama?" Aria asked, her arms tight around my neck.
"You both did wonderfully," I assured them, breathing in their familiar scent-a mixture of baby shampoo and the garlic they'd been cooking with. "Perfect little chefs."
Ethan pulled back first, his expression serious. "Mama, Mr. Shadow sent a lot of gifts again. I told him not to, just like you said."
I nodded, smoothing back his dark hair. So much like his father's, thick and slightly wavy when it grew too long. "I know you did, sweetheart. Some people just like being generous."
"He's my favorite viewer," Aria announced, still clinging to my side. "He always watches, even when it's super early in New York."
My hand stilled on Ethan's head. "How do you know he's in New York, little one?"
Aria shrugged, already distracted by the remaining risotto. "His profile says so. Can we have real dinner now? I'm still hungry."
"What would you like?" I asked, carefully setting aside my unease about NightShadow for the moment.
"Lobster!" Aria declared immediately. "The fancy one with butter sauce!"
Ethan shook his head slightly. "Anything is fine, Mama. You don't have to cook twice today."
I kissed the top of his head, touched by his concern. Always thinking of others, always careful not to add to my burdens. Sometimes I worried he carried too much weight on his small shoulders.
"How about this," I suggested. "I don't have any investment reports to review tonight, so I can definitely make your favorite lobster with plenty of time to read your bedtime story."
Ethan's face brightened. "Really? No work tonight?"
"Not tonight," I confirmed, already heading to the refrigerator. "Tonight is just for us."
As the twins skipped off to wash their hands, I allowed myself a moment of reflection.
Five years ago, I could barely boil water without setting off smoke alarms. Now, here I was, preparing lobster thermidor from scratch in a Tuscan villa kitchen.
While the lobsters were baking, I checked the earnings from the livestream. NightShadow's gifts alone would cover our grocery bills for the month.
I tapped on the anonymous profile, examining it for the hundredth time. Created six months ago, followed only the twins' account, profile picture a simple shadow against a navy background-everything about it seemed designed specifically to watch my children without revealing the watcher's identity.
The mystery gnawed at me. What kind of person spent so much money on children they didn't know? Was it simply a wealthy individual with too much time and money? Or something more concerning?
I typed a direct message: Would it be possible to speak privately? I appreciate your support of the children's channel, but I'd like to understand who's being so generous.
The message showed as delivered, but like my previous attempts, received no response. I sighed and slipped the phone into my pocket. Another dead end with this mysterious benefactor.
###chapter 97: I'm Not Hiding
Angela POV
"Mama, can I help clean the table?" Aria's small voice pulled me from my thoughts as we finished our dinner.
"I've got the dishes," Ethan announced, already carefully stacking plates.
I smiled at my daughter. "When you're a bit taller, you can help with the table. For now, why don't you put your napkin in the laundry basket?"
Aria considered this, then nodded seriously, treating the simple task with exaggerated importance.
"You're both such wonderful helpers," I said, dropping a kiss on each forehead before helping Ethan with the heavier dishes.
While the twins carried their napkins to the laundry room with ceremonial precision, my phone rang. Sophie's name flashed on the screen, and I felt a familiar warmth at the sight.
"Ciao, bella!" Sophie's voice carried all the bustle and energy of Manhattan through the line. "How are my favorite Italian residents?"
"We're wonderful," I replied, settling onto a kitchen stool. "The twins just finished their cooking show. Risotto was a big hit."
"I watched the first few minutes before my meeting," Sophie laughed. "Aria's face when she dropped that shrimp was priceless. Listen, have you thought more about the Lawrence Capital offer? George called me again yesterday."
I sighed, running a hand through my loose waves. "I don't know, Sophie. Moving back to New York..."
"I know, I know. But Angela, it's been five years. You can't hide in this little Tuscan town forever, no matter how peaceful country life is."
"I'm not hiding," I protested, though the words felt hollow even to my own ears. "I'm raising my children and building a consulting portfolio."
"Speaking of which,"Sophie's voice was full of excitement, "your last market analysis was absolutely brilliant. Which is exactly why you should be running your own firm in New York instead of freelancing from Italy."
"I've been thinking about that, actually," I admitted, lowering my voice as I heard the twins returning from the laundry room. "Not Lawrence Capital, but starting my own boutique investment advisory. Something small that I could build while still having time with the children."
Sophie's squeal of delight made me pull the phone from my ear. "YES! This is what I've been waiting to hear! Angela Wilson back in the game on her own terms. We need to celebrate when you're back!"
"I haven't decided yet," I cautioned, but Sophie was already launching into ideas about office space in the Financial District and potential clients.
By the time I finished the call, the twins had been bathed, pajama-clad, and were waiting expectantly with their favorite storybook.
I tucked them into their beds, reading until both pairs of eyes grew heavy.
"Night, my precious ones," I whispered, placing a final kiss on each forehead.
"G'night, Mama," Ethan murmured, already half-asleep.
"Love you to the moon and Jupiter," Aria added with a yawn, using our special phrase.
"And back again," I completed, turning off the light and leaving their door slightly ajar.
Back in the kitchen, I finished tidying up, then checked my phone once more. Still no response from NightShadow. With a small frown, I set the phone aside and prepared for bed.
Unlike the early years after leaving New York, when sleeping pills had been my only refuge against insomnia, I now found rest came relatively easily.
The quiet of the Tuscan countryside, the physical fatigue from days spent with active five-year-olds, and perhaps simply the passage of time had all contributed to healing that particular wound.
As I drifted toward sleep, my mind wandered to the mysterious NightShadow.
Who was this person, watching my children from a distance?
Some wealthy but lonely soul, perhaps, finding joy in their innocent cooking adventures?
Or someone with darker motives?
I'd tried tracing the account, but Instagram's privacy features made it nearly impossible without professional help.
Tomorrow, I decided, I would speak with my cybersecurity consultant in Milan.
Five years away from the cutthroat world of finance had taught me to trust my instincts. And my instincts said there was something strange about NightShadow's interest in my children.
As I finally surrendered to sleep, a name I rarely allowed myself to think about directly floated through my consciousness.
Sean.
Five years since I'd spoken it aloud.
Five years since I'd made the decision to leave without telling him about the pregnancy. Five years of building a life for myself and our children-children he didn't even know existed.
Sometimes I wondered if I'd made the right choice. But then I'd remember Christina's words, the check Sean had written, the life they had probably built together by now.
No, I decided as sleep finally claimed me. Some doors were better left closed.
###chapter 98: Reconnecting
Sean POV
Evening shadows stretched across my presidential suite at the Plaza as I stared out at the Manhattan skyline.
The city lights were beginning to twinkle to life, a tapestry of artificial stars spreading out beneath the darkening sky. I'd loosened my tie hours ago, but hadn't bothered to change out of my suit despite returning from the business meeting nearly two hours earlier.
A soft knock at the door interrupted my thoughts.
"Mr. Shaw?" Thomas entered with that practiced deference that reminded me how much I missed Michael. Five years, and I still wasn't used to his replacement. "Your dinner has arrived."
"Just leave it there," I murmured, gesturing vaguely toward the side table.
"Sir, you haven't eaten all day," Thomas pointed out, setting down the tray with careful precision. "And Dr. Carter was very clear about taking your medication with food."
I sighed, finally turning from the window. The silver dome covering the plate gleamed in the soft lamplight, but the thought of food only intensified the dull ache in my stomach.
"I'm not hungry."
"Mr. Shaw," Thomas tried again, concern evident in his voice, "your condition won't improve if you don't maintain regular meals. Perhaps just a few bites?"
"Fine," I conceded, more to end the conversation than from any desire to eat. "I'll try some of it later."
Thomas nodded, relieved to have extracted even this small promise.
"Your medication is beside the water glass, sir. And should I confirm your attendance at tomorrow's charity gala? Mr. Lawrence has called twice to personally request your presence."
At the mention of another social obligation-another evening of meaningless small talk and strategic networking-I felt a familiar weariness settle deeper into my bones. "Tell her I'll try to make an appearance."
Once Thomas retreated, I loosened my tie further and sank into the armchair by the window. My phone buzzed on the side table, and I reached for it automatically, expecting another email from the office.
Instead, I found a notification from Instagram-LittleChefsTuscany had gone live. Something inside me softened before I could stop it.
Five years.
Five years since she'd disappeared without a trace, taking with her any chance of understanding what had gone wrong.
Five years of throwing myself into work, of building Shaw Group higher and higher, as if reaching some invisible threshold might finally fill the emptiness she'd left behind.
I tapped on the notification, watching as the screen filled with the image of a sunlit kitchen. Two children in oversized chef hats were arranging ingredients on a marble countertop.
"Welcome everyone!" the little girl-Aria-announced with theatrical flourish. "Today we're making seafood risotto!"
Her brother-Ethan-nodded solemnly beside her, already measuring rice with careful precision.
"It's one of Mama's special recipes," he added, his voice carrying that endearing formality that reminded me strangely of myself at that age.
I'd stumbled across their account six months ago during a particularly bleak night. Something about these children-their unself-conscious joy, their earnest approach to their cooking "show"-had caught my attention and held it.
In a world of carefully curated content, their authenticity shone through.
The boy's methodical precision and the girl's effervescent personality provided a contrast that was both familiar and captivating.
As the livestream was ending, Aria said, "Mom tells us we need to eat properly and stay healthy. Enjoy your meal today, everyone!"
After hearing her say this, I couldn't help but reach for my dinner tray and start eating.
Just after I had finished taking a shower, there was a knock at the door. I thought it was hotel service, but when I opened the door, I saw a woman in revealing, provocative clothing standing there.
She wore a sheer black lace slip dress, so short it barely covered the tops of her thighs, her cleavage a deep shadow beneath the flimsy fabric
"Good evening, sir," she purred, her voice low and sultry, sliding into my ears like velvet. "I'm a special gift from Mr. Lawrence, here to help you unwind tonight." Her eyes locked onto mine, shimmering with brazen intent.
I frowned, immediately understanding who-or what-she was. "No, thank you," I said curtly, turning to close the door.
But she was quicker. One slender arm shot out to brace the doorframe, her body leaning forward until her chest nearly brushed against my shirt.
"Don't be so quick to say no," she giggled,"You've had a long day, haven't you? I know exactly how to make you feel good"
Her movements grew bolder. The hem of her dress rode up as she swayed her hips, revealing the curve of her thighs and the faint outline of her ass beneath the fabric.
She reached up and tugged at one thin strap of her dress, letting it slip off her shoulder. The material fell away, exposing one full breast, the nipple faintly visible through the lace.
"See? I'm here just for you. Are you really going to turn down such a nice gift?"
I inhaled sharply, forcing down the irritation rising in my chest, and grabbed her wrist, pushing her back firmly.
"I said no. Please leave," I stated, my voice cold and final.
"Alright, sir, you're breaking my heart," she teased, slowly adjusting her dress back into place."If you change your mind, you know where to find me."
As she left, I pressed a hand against my abdomen, feeling the familiar burning sensation intensify. The encounter had left a sour taste in my mouth that had nothing to do with food.
Is this what business had become in my world?
Beautiful women offered as incentives, as if I were some hormone-driven teenager rather than the CEO of one of the largest financial groups in the country?
The pain sharpened suddenly, forcing me to sit down. I fumbled for my medication, swallowing the pills dry as I focused on controlling my breathing.
I lay alone in bed, waiting for the pain to slowly fade away.
My phone buzzed from where I'd left it on the sofa. I retrieved it, finding another Instagram notification-not a live broadcast this time, but a direct message from the LittleChefsTuscany account.
Curious, I opened it.
Would it be possible to speak privately? I appreciate your support of the children's channel, but I'd like to understand who's being so generous.
I stared at the message for a long time, considering my options. I'd never responded to previous messages from the account, preferring to remain an anonymous benefactor.
I thought it's better to just ignore it for now.
But after I hesitated for a moment, I replied to the account message:
You want to talk to me? About what?
###chapter 99: Without Giving You What You Really Want
Angela POV
The blue glow of my phone illuminated the darkened bedroom as I stared at the notification. NightShadow had finally responded to my message.
You want to talk to me? About what?
Simple. Direct. Almost defensive. I sat up in bed, the silk sheets sliding away as I considered my response.
Yes, I'd like to know who's been so generous with my children's channel. Your donations are substantial, and I'm not comfortable accepting them without knowing who you are.
I hit send before I could overthink it. The response came surprisingly quickly.
The children bring joy to many people. My donations are simply appreciation.
I frowned at the screen. Again, direct and spare with details. No personal information volunteered.
May I know what to call you, at least? Or how you discovered their channel?
The typing indicator appeared, disappeared, then reappeared.
You can call me Shadow. I found their channel by chance. Your daughter reminds me of someone I once knew.
My breath caught. There was something in the phrasing that made me uneasy. I glanced instinctively toward the twins' bedroom, a protective surge running through me.
I appreciate your generosity, but the amount you've donated is excessive. I'd like to return most of it. Could you provide account information?
Another pause, longer this time.
No need. Consider it an investment in their future.
The brevity was frustrating. Each response revealed nothing while provoking more questions.
The total is over $15,000 in six months. That's not a simple tip for a children's cooking show.
I waited, watching as the typing indicator appeared and disappeared several times. Finally:
I wasn't aware of the total. Keep it. They deserve it.
The dismissive tone about such a large sum of money suggested significant wealth. A Wall Street type, perhaps? The thought made me tense, memories of that world-of Sean-surfacing unwanted.
I'll contact you tomorrow for account details. Goodnight, Shadow.
I set the phone aside, knowing I wouldn't receive more tonight.
***
The gentle clatter of pots and pans roused me from sleep.
I slipped from bed, throwing on a silk robe over my nightgown before padding toward the kitchen. The marble floor felt cold against my bare feet as I rounded the corner and found Christopher Blake arranging breakfast on the dining table.
He looked up as I entered, his amber eyes warming at the sight of me. The elegant lines of his Tom Ford white shirt contrasted with the deep tan of his skin, sleeves rolled up precisely to mid-forearm as he arranged fresh-cut fruit on fine china.
"Good morning, Angela," he greeted, his British-Italian accent more pronounced in the early hours. "I hope you don't mind the intrusion."
I tucked a strand of hair behind my ear, suddenly aware of my disheveled appearance. "Christopher. I wasn't expecting you."
His eyes dropped to my bare feet, a small frown crossing his features. "The marble is cold. You should wear slippers."
Without argument, I retreated to grab a pair of slippers, returning properly shod a moment later.
"Better?" I asked, unable to keep the slight teasing from my voice.
He nodded, satisfied, and pulled out a chair for me.
"I noticed you've been busy with the children's broadcasts and your consulting work. I thought perhaps you might be neglecting your own breakfast."
I settled into the chair, taking in the spread before me. Fresh croissants from the bakery in the village, sliced fruit arranged in a perfect spiral, eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce that looked restaurant-quality.
"You didn't have to do this."
"I wanted to." He poured coffee into a delicate cup, adding precisely the amount of cream I preferred without asking.
I smiled faintly. Christopher had my house keys. Whenever he had free time, he would come help me take care of the children. I couldn't imagine how I would have raised two children alone without his help.
"The twins are sleeping in today?" he asked .
"They were up late last night. Their cooking show ran longer than usual."
I didn't mention my late-night conversation with the mysterious Shadow. Something held me back from sharing that particular concern.
"Their following is growing impressively. Aria has quite the camera presence."
"She does," I agreed, feeling the familiar surge of maternal pride. "Ethan balances her perfectly. He's so meticulous."
"Like his mother," Christopher observed with a small smile.
"Sophie tells me you're considering returning to New York," Christopher said, setting down his coffee cup. "To start your own firm."
"I've been thinking about it," I admitted. "Not Lawrence Capital, but starting something of my own. A boutique advisory firm, perhaps."
Christopher's eyes lit with interest. "That's an excellent idea. "
"It would be small," I cautioned. "Just enough clients to be intellectually stimulating without taking too much time away from the twins."
"Why New York?" he asked casually. "London would position you well for European markets. My firm could provide office space, administrative support..."
I shook my head immediately. "Christopher, I appreciate the offer, but I need to do this independently. I already owe you too much."
His expression softened. "Angela, you've never owed me anything."
"That's not true." I set down my fork, meeting his gaze directly. "The villa, your legal team helping with my residency status, the twins' school tuition-"
"Investments," he interrupted gently. "In people I care about."
I sighed, feeling the familiar weight of his generosity. "That's exactly why I need to stand on my own. I can't keep accepting everything you offer without-"
"Without what?" he prompted when I didn't finish.
Without giving you what you really want, I thought but didn't say.
"New York makes sense," I said instead. "I still have contacts there, and the twins should connect with their American heritage."
Christopher studied me for a moment, then nodded. "If New York is where you want to be, then I'll support that decision."
"Thank you." I took another sip of coffee, relieved that he hadn't pushed the issue.
"Actually," he continued, "I've been considering expanding my firm's presence in the American market."
I looked up sharply. "What?"
"It's been in the planning stages for about a month now." He spoke casually, as though discussing the weather. "New York would be the logical headquarters for our North American operations."
"Christopher..." I started, suspicion creeping into my voice.
He raised a hand. "Before you accuse me of making business decisions based on personal feelings, I have a complete market analysis and five-year projection prepared. You're welcome to review it."
"You just happened to be planning an American expansion right when I decide to move back to New York?" My skepticism was evident.
"Come to my office later," he suggested. "I'll show you the reports. They're quite thorough."
"I might do that"
Later that morning, I visited Christopher's office to review his market reports.
"The projections are sound," I admitted, gathering my portfolio from his desk. "Though perhaps a bit conservative."
"I told you it was a legitimate business decision."
I breathed a sigh of relief.
It seemed Christopher wasn't planning to move his company headquarters to New York just for me.
"I should go home to check on the children," I told Christopher.
But as I walked out of his office building, I heard his employees whispering in Italian.
"Look, there's Wilson visiting Mr. Blake again. Who does she think she is?"
###chapter 100: Whispers and Choices
Angela POV
"I truly don't understand why Mr. Blake is so fond of her. A divorced woman with two children."
"She's clearly using her good looks, knowing exactly how Mr. Blake feels about her."
"You women are just too jealous. Mrs. Wilson is genuinely beautiful and carries herself with elegance."
"Elegant? Hmph. She's nothing more than Mr. Blake's mistress."
"I heard Mr. Blake's father strongly disapproves of her. After all, the Blake family descends from Italian and British nobility. How could they possibly accept a divorced woman with two children?"
Their words stung, especially since I understood Italian perfectly after five years in the country. I stepped into the elevator, reminding myself that my main priority was taking care of my children. There was no need to cause a confrontation.
My phone rang just as I settled into the driver's seat. Sophie's name flashed on the screen, and I felt my mood instantly lighten.
"Sophie!" I answered warmly. "How are you?"
"Angela, guess who's coming to see you?" Sophie's excitement crackled through the line. "I'm in Milan for a fashion magazine assignment, and you're just a short drive away! I thought I'd surprise you and the kids!"
"Sophie!" I couldn't contain my delight. "That's wonderful! I'm heading home right now."
"Perfect! I'm already on my way to your place-should be there in about twenty minutes."
"You're always full of surprises," I laughed. "I'll see you soon."
***
I returned home to find Sophie already there, sitting on the terrace with the twins. Aria was perched on Sophie's lap showing her something on a tablet, while Ethan sat beside them, listening intently.
"Mama!" Aria spotted me first, leaping off Sophie's lap. Ethan followed with a bright smile.
"Sophie Auntie came to see us!" Aria announced, hugging my waist.
I embraced them both. "What a wonderful surprise!"
Sophie approached, looking every bit the Manhattan fashion editor in her designer sundress. "Surprise!" she said before pulling me into a tight hug.
"I've missed you," I whispered.
"Missed you too. You look good. Italian countryside life agrees with you."
"Did you bring us anything from New York?" Aria asked.
"Aria," I admonished gently.
"Of course I did!" Sophie laughed. "What kind of godmother would I be if I didn't spoil my favorite twins?"
Ethan stepped forward, his green eyes-so like his father's-serious. "Thank you for visiting, Auntie Sophie."
"He's getting more formal by the day. Just like-" She caught herself, then turned back to the children. "You two have grown so much!"
She reached into her tote bag. "I brought the latest LEGO set for Ethan, and the limited edition Barbie for Aria!"
The twins accepted their gifts with well-practiced manners.
"Sophie, you spoil them terribly," I said without reproach.
"That's what godmothers are for!" Sophie winked. "Though five years ago, I never imagined I'd become godmother to twins."
I felt a pang in my chest. "And I never imagined I'd suddenly become a mother to twins..."
"Can you help me open my Barbie?" Aria asked Sophie.
"Of course, sweetheart," Sophie agreed, led away by my excited five-year-old.
I watched them go with mixed emotions. These moments were the life I had created from the ashes of my past-a life that held its own kind of contentment.
***
After dinner and bedtime stories, with the twins tucked safely into their beds, Sophie and I retreated to my bedroom with glasses of wine.
We sat cross-legged on my king-sized bed, the Tuscan moonlight streaming through the open windows.
Sophie didn't waste time with small talk. "So, what's going on with you and Christopher? How far have you two gotten? Have you slept together yet?" Her tone was teasing but pointed, her eyes glinting with curiosity.
I hadn't expected Sophie to be so direct. My cheeks flushed hot with embarrassment, and I fumbled to explain.
"Of course we haven't," I said quickly, my voice a little too sharp.
Then I sighed, setting my wine glass on the nightstand. "I overheard some things at his office today."
"Don't listen to them," Sophie said, waving her hand dismissively. "Those women are just bitter that Christopher only has eyes for you. What I don't understand is why you keep him at arm's length. It's been five years, Angela. The man is devoted to you."
"Christopher and I are just friends," I replied firmly.
"Friends?" Sophie raised an eyebrow. "He caters to your every need, supports your every decision, and looks at you like you hung the moon. That's not friendship-that's devotion. He's gorgeous, wealthy, and treats you like a queen. What more could you want?"
"Feelings don't work that way," I said softly.
"Sophie, I have children. I can't just think about myself."
"But Christopher practically raises Aria and Ethan as his own! He adores them," she countered. Then she leaned in closer, her voice softening but firm.
"Listen, you're still young, Angela. Yes, you're a mother, and you're amazing at it, but you deserve more than just taking care of the kids. You should carve out some time for yourself-enjoy love, enjoy sex. Life's too short to hold back."
I fidgeted with the stem of my glass, her words stirring something restless in me. "Yes," I acknowledged, eyes dropping to my hands. "And I'm grateful for everything he's done."
Sophie studied my face carefully. "Is it because of Sean? After all this time?"
I tensed at the mention of the name I'd spent five years trying not to think about. The father of my children. The man whose features I saw every day in Ethan's green eyes, in Aria's determined chin.
"It's not just about Sean," I finally said. "It's about what I want for my future, for the twins' future."
"And what do you want?" Sophie pressed gently.
I gazed out at the star-filled Tuscan sky. "Independence. I spent my whole life dependent on others-my father, then Sean, and now Christopher. I need to stand on my own before I can consider standing beside someone else."
"And that's why you're thinking of moving back to New York? To establish your own firm?"
"Exactly. I need to know I can succeed on my own terms."
Sophie raised her wine glass. "To independence and knowing exactly what you want."
I clinked my glass against hers, feeling more certain of my path than I had in months.
We talked until Sophie drifted off to sleep. I stood by the window, gazing at the moonlit landscape.
Five years ago, I had fled New York with a broken heart and pregnant with twins. Now I was contemplating a return, stronger and more determined.
###chapter 101: Familiar Voices
Sean POV
Thomas was already scrambling out as we arrived at Malpensa Airport, ready to handle the luggage and check-in procedures.
The week-long negotiations in Milan had finally concluded.
"I'll take care of everything, Mr. Shaw," he assured me, the slight tremor in his voice betraying his perpetual anxiety. "The check-in counter is just inside. They're expecting you."
I nodded.Inside, I made my way toward the restrooms. As I pushed open the door with my shoulder, I noticed a small boy struggling with the heavy door, his arms loaded with what appeared to be a toy airplane and a book.
Without breaking stride, I reached over and held the door open for him. The child looked up, his green eyes brightening.
"Thank you, sir," he said politely before slipping inside.
I froze, a strange feeling washing over me. That voice-hauntingly familiar-pulled at my memory.
I turned to glimpse the boy again, but he had vanished into a stall. All I could see was the top of his dark, slightly wavy hair, strangely familiar.
"Mr. Shaw!" Thomas appeared at the restroom entrance. "We need to board immediately. There's been a seating issue."
"What kind of issue?"
He swallowed. "The booking system glitched. First and business class were full when I confirmed your seat."
I stopped and turned to face him. "You didn't secure my seat?"
"I tried, sir, but the flight is overbooked."
"Where am I seated?" I asked, my voice cold.
"Economy, sir. I'm so sorry."
The anger surged. "Thomas, when we return to New York, we'll discuss your future with Shaw Group."
His color drained. "Yes, sir."
The economy cabin felt like a cruel joke. The seats were narrow, the legroom nonexistent for someone of my height.
"Sir," Thomas hovered in the aisle, his expression frantic. "I'm trying to find someone willing to switch seats. Just give me a few minutes."
I didn't respond, instead pulling out my phone to review emails, deliberately ignoring him and the curious glances from nearby passengers who were clearly wondering why a man in a five-thousand-dollar suit was crammed into economy.
Fifteen minutes into boarding, Thomas reappeared, accompanied by a nervous-looking young man.
"Mr. Shaw," Thomas said quietly, "this gentleman has kindly offered to exchange his first class seat with yours."
The young man practically vibrated with excitement. "It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Shaw! I've followed your career for years. I'd be happy to take your seat-no compensation necessary."
I silenced him with a look, rising from the cramped seat with as much dignity as I could muster. "Thomas will take your contact information," I said coldly, collecting my briefcase.
The first class cabin was mercifully spacious and quiet.
I closed my eyes, about to rest, but a childish voice rang in my ear.
"You're really handsome, mister!"
I opened my eyes to find a small girl standing beside my seat, her dark curls framing a heart-shaped face that displayed absolute confidence in her statement.
"Aria?" The name slipped out before I could stop it, surprising me as much as her.
Her eyes widened, and she took a half-step closer. "How do you know my name? Are you one of Mama's friends?"
I blinked, realizing my error. "I... no. I've seen your cooking show on Instagram. The one with your brother."
"You watch our cooking show? Really truly?"
I nodded, finding myself unable to look away from her animated face. "Yes. The risotto episode was... quite educational."
She beamed, rocking back on her heels. "Mama says people who like watching children cook must have really kind hearts. Is that true? Do you have a kind heart?"
The question caught me off guard. In my entire adult life, no one had ever described me as kind-hearted. Brilliant, yes. Ruthless, certainly. But kind?
"I'm not sure," I answered honestly.
Aria seemed to consider this, her head tilting slightly. "Mama says everyone has kindness in them, but some people forget where they put it." She leaned closer, as if sharing a secret. "Like how I always lose my hairbands, but they're usually just under my pillow all along."
A smile tugged at my lips. "Your mother sounds very wise."
"She is!" Aria nodded enthusiastically. "She says even busy people like you should learn to cook, because then you can take care of yourself and the people you love even when work gets crazy."
"Is that so?" I asked, oddly touched by this child's earnest wisdom.
"Yep! That's why we do our cooking show. To help busy people remember how to make yummy food." Her expression turned serious. "Do you know how to cook, mister?"
"Not really," I admitted. "I usually have people who do that for me."
Aria frowned slightly. "That's sad. Cooking is fun! Mama says the best feeling is making something delicious for someone you love and watching their face when they taste it."
Something about her words struck a chord deep within me. When was the last time I'd done anything for someone else's enjoyment?
"Your mother sounds like an exceptional person," I said softly.
Aria nodded with absolute conviction. "She's the best person in the whole world."
A flight attendant appeared then, her expression apologetic. "I'm so sorry, Mr. Shaw. Is she bothering you?"
"Not at all,"
"Nevertheless, sweetheart, you need to return to your seat. We're preparing for takeoff." The attendant held out her hand to Aria.
The little girl sighed dramatically but accepted the attendant's hand. Before leaving, she turned back to me with a bright smile.
"Bye, mystery Instagram man! Maybe you can try cooking something when you get home!"
I found myself watching her as she disappeared down the aisle, the lingering scent of children's shampoo the only evidence she'd been there at all.
For the first time in what felt like years, the constant tension in my shoulders had eased slightly, replaced by a curious warmth I couldn't quite name.
As the plane began its descent, I made a decision. I would find them before they left the airport-just to say hello properly, to thank Aria for her unexpected company.
I watched carefully as the economy section emptied, looking for Aria's distinctive curls or her brother's serious expression. But as the minutes ticked by and the cabin cleared, there was no sign of them.
"They must have already deplaned," I muttered, finally rising from my seat.
"Who, sir?" Thomas asked, confusion evident in his voice.
"It doesn't matter," I replied, gathering my belongings. "Let's go."
###chapter 102: He's Dead
Angela POV
I gripped Aria's hand firmly as we navigated through JFK's bustling terminal, Ethan walking dutifully on my other side.
 My phone vibrated-Olivia Harrison.
I smiled at the familiar name. Olivia and I had become close friends during my time in Italy. We'd bonded instantly over our shared experiences, and she'd moved back to New York about a year ago.
"Olivia, hello," I answered.
"My God, your phone is finally working! I tracked your flight and saw it landed, but couldn't reach you. I was worried sick!" Olivia's melodic voice carried her slight Italian accent.
"We just deplaned," I explained, exhaustion seeping into my voice.
"David is already at the VIP exit-don't move, he'll come to you."
Before I could protest, I spotted David Chen approaching us, his familiar face a welcome sight after the long flight.
"Angela, welcome back to New York," he greeted warmly, then bent slightly to acknowledge the twins. "Hello Aria, Ethan. I hope you had a pleasant flight."
Olivia's Upper East Side brownstone welcomed us with unexpected warmth. She'd prepared the guest rooms with thoughtful touches-my favorite Jo Malone candles, small potted plants, and toys for the twins.
After helping us settle, David quietly approached me. "Mr. Blake asked me to remind you that if you need anything, you can call me anytime."
After David left, Olivia nudged me with a knowing smile.
"Christopher is still so attentive to you," she teased.
Her words didn't comfort me-they only added to the pressure I already felt.
That afternoon, while the twins were taking their nap, Olivia and I stepped out onto the terrace for some quiet conversation.
"Tea?" I raised an eyebrow. "I expected premium champagne to toast our reunion."
Olivia laughed, the sound tinkling like wind chimes. "Champagne? Besides, I've given up alcohol-doctor's orders."
"You? The cocktail queen of Manhattan?"
"The truth is... I met a man."
My interest piqued despite myself. "Oh?"
"At a bar," she leaned forward, voice dropping conspiratorially. "You can't imagine how captivating he is, Angela. His presence, his appearance-absolutely flawless. If I could marry him, my life would be complete."
She sighed dramatically. "He drinks like no one I've ever seen. Trying to keep up to get his attention... well, my stomach paid the price."
"The first time I saw him, he was just sitting there," Olivia's eyes took on a dreamy quality. "He was tall and striking, not the kind of playboy you'd expect. There was something deeper about him, a quiet intensity that never seemed to fade."
She rummaged through her phone. "I could have sworn I saved a photo-it's not very clear, taken from a distance, but that aura is unmistakable. "
"He's just a guy who drinks too much," I told Olivia.
" And those eyes-a striking green, like rare emeralds. I've never seen anything like them."Olivia continued, lost in her recollection.
I nearly choked on my tea. Green eyes. Like Ethan's. Like Sean's.
"Maybe you could join me there sometime?" Olivia suggested. "Help me spot him?"
I shook my head. "Sorry, I need to stay with the children."
"Just joking," she smiled, then added, "Though I truly don't understand why you're not interested in Christopher. He's clearly devoted to you. After all these years, don't you feel anything?"
My expression closed off immediately. "Olivia, please don't joke about that."
As twilight deepened, I caught Olivia staring at Ethan, who sat diligently working on a puzzle in the living room. Her expression shifted from casual observation to puzzled concentration.
"Is something wrong?" I asked, trying to keep my voice light.
She startled. "No, I just..." She continued staring at my son's profile. "It's strange, but his features-especially from this angle-they remind me of someone."
"Who?"
"That man I told you about, from the bar." Olivia tilted her head, studying Ethan more intently.
"Something about the jawline, the way he furrows his brow when concentrating. It's probably just my exhaustion playing tricks."
I forced a laugh that sounded hollow even to my ears. "What a coincidence that would be."
"I know, right?" Olivia laughed, but her eyes lingered on Ethan. "It's just... uncanny. Those eyes especially."
I moved casually to block her view. "Children need routine after travel. I should get them ready for bed."
Later in the kitchen, as we prepared a light dinner, Olivia broached the subject I had been dreading.
"I've always wanted to ask about Aria and Ethan's father..."
"He's dead," I replied flatly, my knife pausing momentarily over the tomato I was slicing.
Olivia's eyes widened in shock. "Oh my God, Angela, I'm so sorry! I had no idea-if I'd known, I would never have asked."
I nodded, returning to my task with renewed focus, letting the rhythmic chopping fill the uncomfortable silence between us.
Then my phone lit up with a text message from Christopher:
"Hope you're settled in. Don't forget the charity auction tomorrow. I've arranged everything. Rest well."
###chapter 103: Another Ghost
Sean POV
I stepped out of the steaming shower, wrapping a plush hotel towel around my waist as water droplets traced paths down my chest.
My phone lit up on the nightstand-Christina's name flashing for what must have been the fifth time that hour. I glanced at it with irritation before moving to the walk-in closet, the device falling silent only to light up again moments later.
A sharp knock at the suite's door interrupted my thoughts. With a sigh of irritation, I pulled on a pair of loose linen pants and left the closet door half-open.
"Mr. Shaw?" Sarah's voice carried through the door. "Miss Jordan is here to see you. She's quite insistent."
My jaw tightened.
"Let her in,"
Christina stepped in front of me, looking as flawless as always
"Sean," she greeted, her voice a practiced melody of warmth and concern. "You haven't been answering my calls."
I moved past her to the bar, pouring a finger of scotch without offering her anything. "I've been busy."
Christina stood awkwardly in the center of the living area, her Louboutins sinking slightly into the plush carpet. "I've heard you've been drinking quite heavily lately, Sean. That can't be good for your health."
"Yes." I took a slow sip, not elaborating further.
Christina walked over to me, her perfume overwhelming my senses as she drew near. With a gentle but firm motion, she took the glass from my hand and placed it on the side table.
"Sean, you know I care about you," she said softly. "Drinking won't solve anything."
Christina's smile strained at the edges as she tried again. "How have you been feeling? Doctor Carter mentioned your last checkup showed improvement."
"I'm fine." I turned toward my bedroom, iPad in hand. "If that's all, I have emails to address before dinner."
"Sean," Christina called after me, her composure cracking slightly. "What's wrong? You've been so distant lately."
I paused at the bedroom threshold, not bothering to turn around. "Nothing's wrong. Everything is exactly as it should be."
***
Flashback
Five years earlier, I sat behind my massive mahogany desk at Shaw Tower, watching Christina's face transition from expectant hope to confusion, then shock as I delivered my decision.
"I appreciate everything you've done," I said, keeping my voice calm and measured. "Especially saving my life during the yacht accident. I'll always be grateful for that."
Christina leaned forward, her fingers gripping the edge of my desk. "But? I hear a 'but' coming, Sean."
"But I can't give you what you want," I continued, meeting her gaze directly. "I thought I could, but I was wrong."
"This is about Angela, isn't it?" Christina's voice trembled. "She left you, Sean. She chose Christopher Blake over you, and you're still holding onto her?"
My expression remained impassive. "This isn't about Angela. It's about being honest with you, and with myself."
In the weeks that followed, Christina called, texted, even appeared at my office unannounced, only to be politely but firmly turned away. Eventually, her approach shifted-from desperate pursuit to patient waiting. She began attending the same charity events as my family, carefully cultivating a relationship with my mother and father.
"Time," she'd assured me at a gala six months after Angela's departure. "I understand you need time. I'll wait."
And wait she had. Five years of carefully orchestrated appearances, of being the supportive friend who understood my mysterious melancholy, of becoming practically part of my family's inner circle.
Yet for all her efforts, nothing changed within me-I remained polite but distant, acknowledging her presence without truly seeing her.
***
"Will you be attending the Lawrence Capital charity auction tonight?" Christina asked, pulling me back to the present. "Victoria asked me to make sure you attend, and specifically requested that I accompany you this evening."
I glanced at my watch. The last thing I needed was Victoria worrying about me again. Ever since Angela left, Victoria had repeatedly urged me to move forward, to begin new relationships.
"Life is too short to dwell in the past, Sean," she would say with that concerned look in her eyes.
If I refused Christina's request, Victoria would undoubtedly arrange for another companion to accompany me-she'd done it before, with disastrous results.
"I'll be there," I conceded, more for my mother's sake than anything else.
Christina's face brightened immediately. "Wonderful! I'll wear the Dior gown I've been saving for a special occasion. The emerald color will look striking beside your black tuxedo."
"Don't wait for me," I replied, turning back to my bedroom. "I'll meet you there."
"Of course,eight o'clock?"
I nodded without looking back, listening to her retreating footsteps and the soft thud of the suite door closing behind her.
My car came to a stop outside the charity auction, and I caught sight of Christina making her way toward me.
"Sean," she breathed, stepping forward and reaching for my arm.
I moved subtly, maintaining a careful distance between us as we approached the entrance.
Christina's six-inch heels caught on the edge of a step, causing her to stumble slightly.
"Those shoes seem impractical," I observed coolly, not reaching to assist her. "Perhaps you should consider changing them."
Christina's smile remained fixed, though her eyes flashed with hurt.
Can't you just hold onto me? You really can't bear to see me twist my ankle, can you?
Something hardened in my expression, but after a moment, I extended my arm mechanically.
Christina took it with poorly concealed triumph, her posture straightening as we passed a cluster of socialites who had been observing our interaction with undisguised interest.
I caught fragments of their whispered conversation as we walked by-my name, Christina's, and inevitably, Angela's.
Even after five years, the social circles of Manhattan hadn't forgotten the woman who had vanished from my life without a trace.
Christina basked in the reflected attention, her posture perfect as she sat beside me during the bidding.
I barely registered the proceedings, my responses automatic when addressed. Midway through a particularly competitive bidding war for a Monet, something caught my eye at the edge of the crowd-a flash of movement, a familiar silhouette.
My heart seemed to stutter in my chest as I caught a glimpse of a slender woman with dark hair, her profile hauntingly familiar before she turned away. Without conscious thought, I rose from my seat, ignoring the startled looks from those around me.
"Sean?" Christina's voice faded into background noise as I moved purposefully through the crowd, my eyes fixed on the disappearing figure.
By the time I reached the spot where she had stood, the woman was gone.
Had it been real?
Or merely another ghost conjured by my stubborn memory, as had happened countless times before?
"Sean!" Christina appeared at my side, concern etched across her perfect features. "What happened? "
I didn't answer, still searching the dispersing crowd below the museum steps.
"I'm leaving," I said finally, my voice flat.
"But the auction isn't over," Christina protested.
"I don't care." I signaled to my driver, who immediately pulled the car around.
Christina hesitated only briefly before following me down the steps. "I'll come with you. You seem... unsettled."
###chapter 104: Their Children Must Be The Same Age As Mine
Angela POV
I clutched David Chen's offered arm as we navigated through the crowded entrance of Sotheby's.
The opulent auction hall buzzed with Manhattan's elite-faces I hadn't seen in five years but who clearly remembered me, if their whispers and sidelong glances were any indication.
"Ms. Wilson, I apologize for the last-minute change," David said in his perfectly modulated voice. "Mr. Blake was called into an urgent meeting. He's asked me to accompany you tonight."
"It's fine, David," I replied. "Christopher has more important things to attend to than a charity auction."
David nodded respectfully. "Ms. Wilson, your seat is in the private box upstairs. Mr. Blake arranged it specifically."
The auctioneer tapped his microphone, drawing the room's attention.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we've concluded our regular offerings and now move to tonight's highlight-original Monet."
I settled into my seat, grateful for the relative privacy of the box as bidding began. Numbers flew across the room, wealth displayed in casual seven-figure increments.
"Six million dollars from Mr. Shaw!" the auctioneer announced with barely contained excitement. "Do I hear six point five?"
Could it really be him? 
I scanned the room frantically, my eyes darting between faces, but couldn't spot him anywhere. He must be in one of the private boxes, like me-hidden from the general audience but very much present.
But what would I even do if I saw him?
What could I possibly say after five years of silence?
"Mr. Shaw increases his bid to six point five million!" the auctioneer called out again, the name striking me like a physical blow each time it was uttered.
My fingers clutched the armrest, knuckles turning white as that name-the one I had avoided speaking for five years-sliced through my composure like a blade through silk.
The room suddenly felt airless, oxygen replaced by memories I'd fought so hard to suppress.
David leaned closer, concern evident in his expression. "Ms. Wilson, are you alright? You've gone quite pale."
"Just...a bit lightheaded," I managed, my voice sounding distant even to my own ears. "I think I need some air."
"Would you like me to accompany you?" David asked, already half-rising from his seat.
I shook my head. "No, please stay. I'll just step out for a moment."
My legs felt unsteady as I made my way to the exit, my heart hammering against my ribs with each step.
The corridor outside was empty. I leaned against the wall, eyes closed, willing my pulse to slow. Winter rain fell gently beyond the windows, the carpet near the entrance damp from guests' footsteps.
I wrapped my cashmere shawl tighter around my shoulders, the New York winter far harsher than the mild Tuscan climate I'd grown accustomed to.
The chill in the air matched the one in my memories-my last encounter with Sean had been during another winter, in another lifetime.
Five years, I thought, pressing my palm against my forehead. I've built a new life, I have Aria and Ethan, I've moved on. Why am I still affected like this?
Taking a deep breath, I straightened, wiping away the cold sweat that had formed on my brow. I turned to walk toward the ladies' room when a tall figure stepped into my path.
"Excuse me," I murmured
The man before me wore an impeccably tailored Armani suit in midnight blue, his tie knotted with mathematical precision.
"Hello," he said, his smile revealing perfect teeth. "You're Angela Wilson, aren't you? I'm Tristan Lawrence, George Lawrence's son."
I blinked, recognition dawning. The sole heir to the Lawrence Capital empire, Tristan's reputation as both a financial prodigy and Manhattan's most eligible bachelor preceded him.
His notorious playboy reputation was equally well-known-gossip columns had famously reported that at his thirtieth birthday party, he'd drunkenly vowed to bed a thousand beautiful women before settling down.
"Mr. Lawrence," I acknowledged, accepting his extended hand.
"My father speaks very highly of you," Tristan continued, his grip firm but not overbearing. "Says you're the most talented investment advisor he's ever tried to recruit."
"That's kind of him to say," I replied, trying to regain my composure.
"My father mentioned he's made several attempts to bring you on board at Lawrence Capital. May I ask why you've declined? Were his terms not satisfactory, or is it something about the company itself?"
I chose my words carefully, unwilling to reveal my plans for establishing my own firm. "I appreciate your father's offers, but my reasons for declining are personal. ."
Tristan's smile widened, transforming his face with boyish charm.
"Fair enough. Though you should know that I'll be taking over operations soon, and if you were to join us, I'd ensure you received... special consideration."
Before I could respond, Tristan removed his jacket and draped it over my shoulders in one fluid motion.
"New York winters are brutal compared to the Italian countryside," he said, his voice lowering slightly. "I've just returned from the French Riviera-the contrast between Mediterranean sunshine and Manhattan ice is quite jarring."
The gesture caught me off-guard, the jacket still warm from his body heat.
"I should return to the auction," Tristan said, glancing at his watch. "I'm hosting at The Plaza later tonight-nothing formal, just drinks and conversation. My driver can pick you up whenever you're ready to leave here."
He stepped back with a slight bow, walking away before I could return his jacket.
I moved to follow him, intending to return the garment, but he had already disappeared around a corner. With a sigh, I headed toward the entrance, hoping to hand the jacket to an attendant.
"Excuse me," I said to a young woman staffing the coat check. "Could you please return this to Mr. Lawrence when you see him?"
The attendant's eyes widened slightly. "I'm sorry, Ms. Wilson, but if Mr. Lawrence gave you his jacket, you should probably return it to him personally."
"I don't know where he's gone," I explained.
"Mr. Lawrence is something of a fixture at The Plaza," the young woman replied, a hint of gossip in her tone. "Hosts parties there almost weekly. Though I must say, him giving you his jacket is unusual-he typically doesn't leave... tokens... with the women he meets."
I raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"
The attendant leaned forward slightly. "Mr. Lawrence never leaves evidence. Giving you his jacket means he wants you to find him to return it-it's his way of ensuring a second meeting."
"I see," I replied. "Thank you for the information."
I straightened, preparing to return to the auction room when a movement at the entrance caught my eye. My heart stuttered to a stop, the world around me seeming to freeze in that singular moment.
Sean Shaw stood just inside the doorway, commanding attention without effort.
His white shirt contrasted sharply with his black suit, his cold, handsome features set in the same impassive expression I remembered all too well.
Beside him stood Christina Jordan, resplendent in a floor-length pink gown, the hem slightly damp from the rain outside. She clung to his arm with practiced intimacy, her red hair gleaming under the chandeliers.
They looked perfect together-the power couple everyone had always expected them to be. Other guests turned to acknowledge them, respect and admiration evident in their deference.
Pain lanced through my chest, sharper than I'd anticipated.
So they really did end up together, I thought, biting my lower lip to ground myself. Their children must be the same age as Aria and Ethan by now...
Sean's head turned suddenly, as if sensing my presence, his gaze sweeping the lobby. I froze, unable to move or breathe, pressing myself deeper into the shadowed corner where I stood. My hands turned to ice as I watched his eyes narrow, searching.
For one terrible moment, I thought he might have seen me.
Then someone called his name, drawing his attention away, and I remained hidden, my heart thundering in my chest.
###chapter 105: A Familiar Stranger
Angela POV
By the time David dropped me off, it was already 10 PM. When I'm with the kids in Italy, I'd usually be getting them tucked in right about now, then catching up on work.
But tonight, ever since I ran into Sean, I just couldn't relax. Olivia suggested we head to one of her favorite bars.
"If I'm lucky, I might run into this guy I've been crushing on! I'm definitely getting his number tonight!" Olivia said, practically buzzing with excitement.
I thought to myself, a drink tonight wouldn't hurt.
Just as Olivia and I were about to leave, David stopped me.
"Ms. Wilson."
I caught David Chen's concerned expression as he stood in the doorway of Olivia's brownstone, his forehead creased with worry.
"Ms. Wilson, the auction ended quite late. Is it really appropriate to go out at this hour?" he asked, his tone carefully respectful yet unmistakably disapproving.
Beside me, Olivia rolled her eyes dramatically. "Good heavens, David! It's barely ten o'clock. When did you become such an old fuddy-duddy? You're still young!"
I saw the tension in David's stance-his well-tailored suit couldn't hide his discomfort. Christopher had hired him to keep me safe, not to watch me venture out at night.
"It's not the time that concerns me, Ms. Harrison. It's your safety. Two women alone at night-"
"This is the Upper East Side of Manhattan," Olivia interrupted, adjusting her designer clutch. "There are security guards and cameras on every corner. We'll be perfectly fine."
I sighed, recognizing the futility of arguing when Olivia had that determined glint in her eye. Instead, I turned to David. "Please make sure Aria and Ethan are in bed by nine. And no more iPad time tonight, even if they beg."
"Of course, Ms. Wilson," David nodded respectfully. "I'll ensure they follow their routine."
"Come on!" Olivia tugged at my arm with childlike impatience. "We need to get there before it gets too crowded."
As the door closed behind us, I caught a glimpse of David already reaching for his phone. No doubt calling Christopher to report my whereabouts.
The thought should have irritated me, but instead, it brought an odd comfort-someone was watching out for my children while I indulged in this rare night out.
***
The Rain was exactly as exclusive as Olivia had described-understated luxury with a skilled jazz pianist playing softly in the corner.
Crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow over the intimate space, and I found myself relaxing slightly as we settled into plush velvet chairs.
"What do you think?" Olivia asked proudly, gesturing around the room.
"It's lovely," I admitted, accepting a glass of sparkling water from a passing server. My gaze swept the room, unconsciously searching for familiar faces-a habit I'd developed since returning to New York.
 "So, when does your mystery man usually appear?"
Olivia's excitement dimmed slightly. "It's getting late. I'm not sure he'll show up tonight."
"Don't be discouraged," I reached across to pat her hand reassuringly. "Let's call it a lucky draw. If he doesn't come, I'll keep you company for a while. The atmosphere is nice enough to sit and chat for an hour or two."
Olivia's eyes softened with affection. "Angela, you're such a good friend. We'll always be friends, won't we?"
Before I could respond, a tall man in an expensive suit approached our table, his confident stance announcing his intentions before he spoke.
I inwardly sighed, recognizing the type immediately from his designer suit and ostentatious watch-another wealthy show-off who thought his money made him irresistible.
"Excuse me, ladies. I couldn't help noticing you from across the room. May I join you?"
"Thank you for the offer, but we're having a private conversation," I replied with a polite smile that I kept deliberately cool.
"I only want to buy you a drink. Do you know how many women would kill for this opportunity?" he pressed, hovering at the edge of our table, his cologne overwhelming as he leaned in closer.
"I'm married. If you don't want my husband to beat you to a pulp and see your face plastered across tomorrow's tabloids, I suggest you leave right now," I stated coldly, my eyes never leaving his.
The man's face drained of color as he took a step back, his previous confidence evaporating instantly.
"My apologies," he stammered, adjusting his tie nervously. "I didn't realize who... I'll just go." He retreated hastily, nearly bumping into a waiter in his rush to escape our table.
As he walked away, Olivia laughed softly. "You've gotten much more direct these days. Five years ago, you would have made up some polite excuse."
"Directness saves time," I replied, sipping my water. "Especially now."
"Your husband？ Christopher?" Olivia asked, eyebrows raised suggestively. "He's clearly interested in you. You should consider giving yourself another chance at happiness."
I shook my head firmly. "Two children are more than enough for me. Taking care of the twins already consumes most of my energy."
 The thought of my beautiful children brought a genuine smile to my face, softening my features.
"Speaking of genetically blessed children," Olivia leaned forward conspiratorially, "I wouldn't mind borrowing some genes from that gorgeous man I told you about. His features and presence are simply perfect."
Olivia's bold declaration made my hand jerk, spilling orange juice onto my white coat. "Damn it," I muttered, dabbing at the stain with a napkin.
"I better deal with this before it sets," I said, rising from my seat. "I'll be right back."
In the restroom, I carefully blotted the stain with damp paper towels, relieved to see it fading.
Satisfied with my cleaning efforts, I gathered my belongings and exited, rounding the corner toward the main lounge. My heart stopped.
Sean stood less than ten feet away, his tall frame unmistakable even in the dimly lit corridor.
He seemed to be heading toward the men's room, his normally precise movements slightly unsteady.
Five years melted away in an instant, and I felt as if all the oxygen had been sucked from the room.
I instinctively retreated, planning to hide in the women's restroom until he passed. I had nearly reached the door when a strong hand gripped my shoulder, spinning me around and pinning me against the wall.
###chapter 106: A Kiss，A Touch
Angela POV
His eyes widened in disbelief, bloodshot from alcohol but still that unmistakable emerald green. For a moment, he just stared, his breath catching as if he'd been punched.
"Angela?" he whispered, his voice breaking. "Is that really you or am I hallucinating?" His fingers trembled as they reached up to touch my face, hesitant and uncertain, as if I might dissolve under his touch.
The overwhelming stench of whiskey hit me as he leaned closer. I had no idea how much he'd been drinking tonight, but it was enough to make my eyes water. his thumb tracing the outline of my cheekbone in a gesture so achingly familiar it made my heart constrict.
"You can't be real," he murmured, his eyes filling with a mixture of wonder and pain. "I've dreamed of finding you so many times..." His fingers tangled in my hair, the touch both gentle and desperate. "Tell me I'm not imagining this."
I could see the war of emotions playing across his features-anger, hurt, longing, and beneath it all, a raw vulnerability that the alcohol had stripped bare.
"Let go of me, Sean!" I hissed, struggling against his grip, trying to ignore how my body still betrayed me with its response to his touch after all these years.
His gaze focused slightly at the sound of my voice, those green eyes-the same ones I saw every day in Ethan's face-searching mine with painful intensity.
His fingers continued their exploration, tracing the contours of my face as if committing them to memory.
"It is you," he breathed, the revelation seeming to hit him anew.
 "Where did you go? Why did you..."
His words slurred slightly as he swayed, his weight pressing me further against the wall. His eyes dropped to my lips, and I knew exactly what he was thinking.
"Sean Shaw, if you dare kiss me, I swear you'll regret it," I warned, my voice deadly cold despite my hammering heart.
Suddenly, his body went slack against mine, his considerable weight nearly crushing me as he collapsed.
 "Angel," he murmured.
I tried to push him away and stand up, but his arms instinctively tightened around me, pulling me closer in his drunken state.
He seemed to have forgotten we were in a public place, his hand moving to the back of my head, pressing it against his shoulder.
His lips found my neck, the stubble of his five o'clock shadow scraping against my sensitive skin as he planted heated kisses along my collarbone.
An unwelcome electric current shot through my body, awakening sensations I'd fought to forget for five years.
For a moment, I was paralyzed, caught between past and present.
"Angela? Where are you?" Olivia's voice cut through the fog of confusion, snapping me back to reality.
Panic surged through me. I pushed Sean away from me, desperate to create distance before Olivia appeared.
The sudden movement caused him to fall backward, and I instinctively grabbed for him to prevent injury. The motion threw me off balance, and we both tumbled to the floor just as Olivia appeared.
"Angela! What on earth is going on?" Olivia gasped, her eyes wide with shock at the scene before her.
I rose with as much dignity as I could muster, smoothing my dress with practiced composure. "This drunk tried to harass me," I said coolly, the lie slipping easily from my lips.
"Harass you?" Olivia's voice rose in disbelief. "No, that can't be right."
I watched with growing horror as Olivia knelt beside Sean, gently turning his face.
"This is him-the man I've been telling you about! He must have had too much to drink tonight. He's not usually like this."
The realization hit me like a physical blow.
Olivia's mystery man-the one she'd been obsessing over, the one whose "emerald eyes" she'd been rhapsodizing about-was Sean.
My Ex-husband. The father of my children.
"A true gentleman maintains his self-control even when intoxicated," I replied icily, fighting to keep my voice steady. "Alcohol merely reveals one's true nature."
"You don't understand," Olivia insisted. "He's always so polite and dignified. I've never seen him disrespect a woman."
I found myself in an impossible position. I wanted to warn Olivia about Sean's complicated history, about Christina, but couldn't reveal how I knew without exposing our past.
"I should get going," Olivia suggested. "You go ahead. I'll make sure he's alright."
"You barely know him," I protested, genuine concern for her safety mingling with a strange, unwelcome possessiveness. "That's dangerous."
Olivia's face softened with determination. "If there are consequences, they're mine to bear."
"How much do you actually know about him?" I asked carefully, trying to gauge exactly what Olivia understood about Sean's life. "His personal life? Is he... seeing anyone?"
"He's definitely single," Olivia insisted with such confidence that I nearly laughed. "If he were married or had a girlfriend, he wouldn't be drinking alone in bars."
I felt my resolve hardening. "I can't let you take this risk, Olivia."
"What's gotten into you tonight?" Olivia's eyes narrowed with suspicion. "I've never seen you this tense."
After a moment of internal debate, I relented slightly. "How do you plan to handle this situation?"
"There's a hotel nearby. I'll help him get a room to sleep it off."
"Fine," I conceded, seeing no other option that wouldn't raise more questions. "We'll get him to a hotel, make sure he's safe, then leave immediately."
The Plaza Hotel's elegant lobby was nearly empty when we arrived, having managed to half-carry, half-drag Sean through the entrance. Olivia approached the front desk, leaving me struggling to support Sean's weight.
Despite myself, I noticed the familiar scent of citrus mingled with whiskey that clung to him.
His unconscious face was relaxed, years of tension erased in sleep, making him look almost like the boy I had known in my youth. A dangerous nostalgia tugged at my heart, and I ruthlessly suppressed it.
"I need a room for tonight," Olivia was saying to the receptionist. "My friend is... unwell."
The receptionist looked skeptically at Sean's slumped form. "I'll need the guest's identification for check-in purposes."
"He's indisposed at the moment," Olivia explained. "Can't we make an exception? He's an important client."
"I'm sorry, madam. Hotel policy requires-"
"It's fine," I interrupted, stepping forward.
Without thinking, I reached into Sean's inner jacket pocket where he had always kept his wallet, extracted it, and removed his ID card and credit card, which I handed to the receptionist.
Only when I caught Olivia staring at me, mouth slightly agape, did I realize my mistake.
"How did you know where his wallet was?" she asked, suspicion clouding her features.
###chapter 107: Another Savior
Angela POV
"How did you know where his wallet was?" Olivia asked, her eyes wide with suspicion.
I swallowed hard, willing my racing heart to slow. I was surprised at myself-after five years apart, I still remembered all of Sean's little habits, down to exactly where he kept his wallet and cards.
"I guessed," I replied, forcing a casual shrug. "Lucky guess."
"That was some guess," Olivia remarked with a playful smile. "If you hadn't spent the last five years in Italy, I'd suspect you two had dated before."
My heart skipped a beat at how close she'd inadvertently come to the truth.
After getting Sean's room key, we had hotel staff help us transport his unconscious form to his room. Once the bellman had departed, Sean sprawled across the king-sized bed, his breathing heavy but steady.
To my horror, Olivia climbed onto the edge of the bed and began working at the buttons of Sean's shirt.
"What are you doing?" I demanded, more sharply than I intended.
Olivia looked up, surprised by my tone. "I'm just helping him out of this shirt. It's wet and covered in whiskey stains. He'll be more comfortable without it."
"Let's have the male hotel staff help him with that," I insisted, pulling her gently but firmly away from the bed. "It's getting late, and my children are waiting at home. We should go."
Olivia cast one last lingering glance at Sean, clearly reluctant to leave. Before turning away, she quickly slipped something into the pocket of his pants.
Just as we were about to exit, Sean stirred slightly, mumbling incoherently. His voice, though slurred, sounded like he was saying my name.
"What's he saying?" Olivia asked, pausing at the doorway.
"I don't know," I replied quickly, my heart racing. "Come on, we need to leave now."
After getting Sean settled and leaving the hotel, our taxi weaved through Manhattan's late-night traffic toward Olivia's brownstone.
My phone buzzed with a text from David: Ms. Wilson, when can we expect you back?
I quickly typed a response: On our way now.
"By the way," I asked Olivia, "what did you slip into his pocket before we left?"
Olivia's eyes widened briefly before she grinned. "Okay, I confess. I left my contact information in his pocket. His phone was locked so I couldn't add my number, but I figured I should leave my details. After all, I did him a huge favor tonight-when he wakes up tomorrow, maybe he'll see me as his savior."
I turned away at the word "savior," a bitter taste filling my mouth.
Through the window's reflection, I watched my own expression go blank, memories of Christina using that exact claim over Sean flooding back.
"Angela? Did I say something wrong?" Olivia's voice held genuine concern.
I forced a smile. "No, just thinking about some old memories."
***
"Angela, there's someone waiting at the door," Olivia said as our taxi pulled up to her brownstone.
I peered through the darkness to see a tall figure standing near the entrance, his posture unmistakable even in the dim light.
"Oh my God, it's Christopher Blake!" Olivia whispered excitedly. "He's here for you!"
Christopher spotted us and walked forward with purposeful strides. As he approached, he removed his cashmere coat in one fluid motion, draping it gently around my shoulders when he reached me.
"The February nights in New York are freezing," he said, his voice carrying a hint of gentle reproach. "How could you go out dressed so lightly? Have you forgotten your pneumonia in Italy?"
The coat enveloped me in sudden warmth, carrying his familiar scent of forest cologne.
"Oh Christopher," Olivia interjected with a playful tone, "don't scold her. If she'd dressed more warmly, would you have had the chance to show off your gentlemanly gestures?"
Christopher's amber eyes crinkled slightly at the corners, but his attention remained fixed on me.
"Let's get inside," he said, nodding politely to Olivia. "It's too cold to stand out here."
Once inside, I excused myself first. "Give me a moment, I want to check on the children."
I quietly made my way to the guest bedroom where the twins were staying. Opening the door gently, I found them both sleeping peacefully, their small chests rising and falling in perfect rhythm. Aria had kicked off her blanket as usual, while Ethan remained neatly tucked in.
I carefully pulled the covers back over my daughter and stood watching them for a moment, grateful for David's care while we were out. He had always been wonderful with the children.
When I returned to the living room, Christopher was waiting patiently. In Olivia's spacious living room, I busied myself pouring water for Christopher while Olivia conveniently excused herself,claiming she was feeling a bit hungry and needed to make something to eat in the kitchen.
I felt Christopher's gaze following me as I moved, his eyes never leaving me even as I handed him the glass.
"What is it?" I asked, settling into the armchair across from him. "Is there something on my face? Why do you keep staring at me?"
A small smile played at his lips. "You smell strongly of alcohol tonight-whiskey, isn't it? Have you been drinking? I remember you haven't had a drink in a long time."
I thought of Sean immediately. It was Sean's scent lingering on me. Could Christopher have discovered this? Impossible-he had just returned.
"I just had a few drinks with Olivia," I said casually. Then, deliberately changing the subject, "How's the New York office expansion going?"
His eyes met mine with quiet intensity. "Angela, do you really think that's why I'm here?"
I looked away, unwilling to engage with the unspoken question hanging between us. "Have you booked a hotel yet?"
He considered for a moment before answering. "No."
"No?" I echoed in surprise.
"I'm thinking of renting an apartment in this neighborhood," he said, his eyes never leaving my face. "The environment suits me."
"I see," I nodded. "Do you have a real estate agent's contact?"
"As it happens," Christopher said, leaning forward slightly, "I was wondering if Ms. Wilson might have time tomorrow to accompany me to Bloomingdale's to select some essentials?"
I couldn't help but smile at his formal phrasing. "I suppose I could manage that."
As Christopher prepared to leave, he paused. "I should say goodnight to Olivia as well. I appreciate her hospitality."
"I'll get her," I offered, making my way to her room.
I knocked gently on Olivia's door, but received no answer.
"Olivia?" I called, pushing the door open slightly. The room was empty.
"Olivia?" I called again, stepping into the vacant bedroom. "Are you here?"
I pushed the door wider, finding the room completely empty. Christopher appeared behind me, concern evident in his expression.
"Her high heels are gone, and so is the coat that was on the sofa," I said, a frown creasing my forehead.
I immediately pulled out my phone and dialed Olivia's number.
No answer. I tried again. Still nothing.
###chapter 108: Now He Was A Beast
Angela POV
"She's not answering. This isn't like her," I said, worry coloring my voice."It's so late, where could she have gone?"
Christopher placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder."Don't worry, I'll stay here with you until Olivia returns."
"She's not answering. This isn't like her," I said, worry coloring my voice.
Christopher placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. "I'm concerned about you and your friend. Let me stay until you reach her."
Just then, my phone chimed with a text message. I quickly opened it to find a message from Olivia:
Don't worry about me! I went back to the hotel to look after that man-the one we took to the hotel together. He'll need someone when he wakes up, and I think this might be my chance! Goodnight! xx
The color drained from my face, and my phone nearly slipped from my fingers.
"Angela?" Christopher's voice sharpened with concern. "What's wrong? What happened?"
I shook my head, struggling to find words.
"Nothing... just... I'm worried about her. She barely knows that him, yet she went to his hotel..." I said, collapsing onto the sofa.
"Olivia is a smart woman," Christopher reassured me. "She knows how to protect herself."
I opened my mouth to explain why I was so concerned, then closed it again.
How could I tell Christopher that the man Olivia was so enamored with was my ex-husband-the father of my children-without revealing the past I'd worked so hard to leave behind?
Christopher leaned forward, his amber eyes searching mine. "Is there something you're not telling me?"
"Nothing significant," I sighed, wrapping my arms around myself. "It's just... returning to New York has been an adjustment."
"Whatever you need, I'm here,"Christopher walked over and wrapped his arm around my shoulders.
"You're shaking," he said, his eyes reflecting concern. "Where's the coat I gave you earlier?"
Only then did I realize that in my panic over Olivia's absence, I had somehow misplaced the cashmere coat he had draped around me earlier.
"I should go find it," I said simply. "Excuse me for a moment."
In the guest bedroom, I slipped on Christopher's cashmere coat, trying to gather my composure. The evening's events had left me rattled in ways I couldn't fully process.
When I returned to the living room, Christopher was ending a call.
"That was David," he explained, slipping his phone into his pocket. "He's gone to look for Olivia."
"Thank you," I said, settling back into my chair.
Christopher studied me for a moment. "Why did Olivia go to that hotel in the first place?"
I hesitated, weighing my words carefully. "To check on... the man we helped earlier."
"This man, who is he to Olivia?"
"No one, really. Just someone she's been admiring from afar who happened to be completely intoxicated tonight."
Christopher studied me with suspicion in his eyes, making me feel suddenly uneasy. But ultimately, he said nothing about his doubts.
"I'll make sure Olivia is safe," he said simply.
He typed out a quick message on his phone, then set it aside.
"You should rest now. It's been a long day, and the twins will be up early."
"I should wait until we hear from Olivia," I protested, even as exhaustion tugged at me.
Deep inside, I knew what I was truly worried about. The image of Olivia unbuttoning Sean's shirt at the hotel flashed through my mind... I shook my head, telling myself it wasn't possible, that such a thing couldn't be happening...
Christopher stood and gently guided me toward the bedroom. "I'll wait. Go rest."
"But-"
His finger pressed gently against my lips, silencing my objection.
The gesture was intimate, possessive in a way Christopher had never been before. His eyes held mine, amber depths glowing with an intensity that made my breath catch.
"Trust me," he murmured, his voice dropping lower as he leaned closer. "I'll take care of everything."
I didn't get a word out before his mouth crashed into mine, hard and wet, his tongue shoving past my lips like he couldn't wait another second.
My hands slammed against his chest, clawing at the tight shirt stretched over his muscles, trying to push him off-but it was pathetic, trembling.
He didn't budge. Instead, he grabbed my hips with both hands, yanking me against him so hard I felt the thick bulge in his jeans press into my stomach.
One hand slid up under my cardigan, rough fingers raking over my bare skin, cupping my ass and squeezing tight, pulling me up until my legs brushed his thighs.
My brain was a mess, spinning out. This was Christopher-my quiet, wait-for-me Christopher.
Now he was a beast, grinding against me, his teeth nipping my bottom lip, his tongue thrusting deeper, tasting me like he'd been starving for it.
I wanted to scream, to shove him off as his hand slipped lower, fingers teasing under my waistband, brushing the edge of my panties.
But my body froze, stuck on the guilt chewing me up-I owed him, didn't I?
After all he'd held back, how could I stop him when he groaned into my mouth, hips rocking slow and dirty against me?
But...It's not right, just not right...
###chapter 109: This Is The Most Right Thing I’ve Ever Done
Angela POV
"Stop...that's not right..." 
I pushed against him with all my strength, but he still didn't budge.
Instead, he shoved me against the bedroom wall, his body pressing into mine. In one swift motion, he grabbed my wrists with a single hand, lifting them high above my head and pinning them there.
I squirmed, but his grip was unrelenting, like steel holding me in place.
He leaned in close, his voice low and resolute.
"This is the most right thing I've ever done," he said. "I should've done it sooner."
His breath brushed against my skin as he locked his eyes on mine, intense and unyielding.
"Tell me you want this too, don't you?"
My heart pounded, and I turned my face away, unable to meet his gaze, afraid of what he might see in my eyes.
He didn't wait for an answer. His lips found the left side of my neck, and he bit down lightly-right where Sean had kissed me earlier tonight.
The sensation was strange, a mix of sharp sting and warm pressure that sent shivers racing through me.
My breath caught, and I clenched my jaw to stifle the sound threatening to escape.
It felt odd-too odd.
"Mama?"
Aria's small voice cut through the moment like a knife.
Christopher immediately released me, stepping back as we both turned toward the doorway.
Thankfully, Christopher hadn't turned on the lights when he had pushed me into my bedroom, keeping us partially hidden in the shadows...
My daughter stood there in her pink unicorn pajamas, her dark curls tousled from sleep, eyes wide with confusion as she clutched her favorite stuffed rabbit.
"Aria, sweetheart, why are you awake?" I asked, my voice unsteady as I quickly adjusted my clothing.
Christopher cleared his throat, smoothing down his rumpled shirt. "I should go," he said, not meeting my eyes.
"I'm thirsty," Aria replied, rubbing her eyes as her gaze darted between us. "I wanted water."
Christopher picked up his keys from the coffee table. "Goodnight, Aria," he said, his voice softer than usual. "Angela, I'll see you tomorrow."
As he moved toward the door, Aria tilted her head curiously. "Blake uncle, why were you kissing Mama?"
My cheeks burned with embarrassment. Christopher paused, hand on the doorknob, waiting for me to respond.
"He was just... saying goodnight, darling," I managed, forcing a smile. "Come on, let's get you some water and back to bed."
I took Aria's small hand, leading her toward the kitchen while pointedly avoiding Christopher's gaze. I heard the front door close softly behind him.
"Does Blake uncle always say goodnight like that?" Aria asked innocently as I filled a small glass with water.
"No, sweetheart. That was... special." I handed her the glass, watching as she took small, careful sips. "Let's get you back to bed now."
After tucking Aria in beside her sleeping brother, I retreated to my own room, my mind a whirlwind of confused emotions. I collapsed onto the bed fully clothed, exhaustion claiming me despite my racing thoughts.
***
Morning light filtered through the curtains when I jolted awake.
I squinted at my phone-6:17 AM. My first coherent thought was of Olivia. Had she returned? Was she still with Sean at The Plaza?
I scrambled out of bed, not bothering with slippers or a robe despite the February chill. As I yanked open my bedroom door, I collided with a solid form in the hallway.
Christopher steadied me, his hands warm on my shoulders. "Whoa, careful," he said, concern etching his features. "What's wrong?"
I looked up at Christopher, memories of what he'd done last night flooding back, and my face quickly flushed crimson. I mumbled a "good morning" and awkwardly averted my gaze.
Christopher, however, remained perfectly composed, his shirt and suit impeccably neat-completely different from the wild, disheveled man from last night. Quickly regaining my composure, I refocused on my concern.
"Olivia," I gasped, trying to move past him. "Is she back? Did she-"
"She's fine," he interrupted, his grip gentle but firm. "My bodyguard kept watch at The Plaza until just a while ago. She's safe."
I stared at him, processing his words. "Your bodyguard was at The Plaza? Did she... Did she go inside? Did she go to his room?" The questions tumbled out before I could stop them.
Christopher studied me, his amber eyes narrowing slightly. "If I told you she did go to his room, how would that make you feel?"
I stepped back, frustration flaring. "Why are you testing me like this? Since last night, you've been trying to catch me in... in what? Some kind of reaction?"
"That's not my intention."
"Isn't it?" I challenged, wrapping my arms around myself as the hallway's chill registered. "Every question, every look..."
Christopher's expression hardened. "Fine, call it a test if you want. It's been five years, Angela. Five years, and you still can't let him go? Why should you care if he's with another woman? What does it matter to you anymore?"
I froze, sudden realization washing over me. "You know," I whispered. "You know I saw him last night."
Christopher's silence confirmed it.
"I..." I struggled to find words, to explain feelings I barely understood myself. "I don't care who he's with. Olivia is my friend, and I don't want her involved in... complications."
His gaze softened slightly, though skepticism remained. "You're shivering," he noted, changing the subject. "Go put something warm on. The children will be up soon, and I'll start breakfast. What would you like to eat?"
"Anything is fine," I mumbled, retreating into my room.
As I pulled on a sweater, my mind filled with unwelcome images-Olivia unbuttoning Sean's shirt, Sean waking to find her beside him, the two of them together. I shook my head, trying to dispel the thoughts.
Five years... Christopher was right. Why should I care?
###chapter 110: Sexual Harassment？
Sean POV
Pain throbbed behind my eyelids, a relentless hammer pounding against my skull.
Glancing around, I realized I was in what appeared to be the presidential suite at The Plaza. How I'd gotten here remained a mystery-another blank space in my memory.
Fragments of memories flickered like broken film: the charity auction, leaving abruptly, heading to The Rain-that upscale bar I'd been frequenting lately.
I remembered ordering whiskey after whiskey, letting the amber liquid burn away thoughts that had haunted me for five years.
Then... a face. Her face.
I bolted upright. Had I really seen Angela last night, or was it just another phantom conjured by too much alcohol?
A persistent knocking pulled me from my thoughts. I ignored it, hoping whoever was disturbing me would eventually give up. But the knocking continued, growing more insistent with each passing minute.
"Damn it," I muttered, forcing myself to stand.
I yanked it open, ready to dismiss whoever stood on the other side. A woman-attractive, stylish, vaguely familiar-stood there, her expression lighting up when she saw me.
"Mr. Shaw! You're awake!" Her voice was too bright, too cheerful for my current state.
"What?" The single word fell from my lips like ice.
She faltered slightly but maintained her smile. "May I come in? I'd like to speak with you."
"Say what you need to right here. One minute." I leaned against the doorframe, not bothering to hide my impatience.
"I'm Olivia Harrison," she began. "I helped you last night when you were... indisposed. My friend Angela and I brought you-"
My entire body tensed at the name. "Angela?" I interrupted, suddenly alert despite my hangover. "Angela Wilson?"
The woman-Olivia-nodded, clearly surprised by my reaction.
"Come in," I said, stepping aside immediately.
Once inside, I maintained a careful distance, struggling to keep my expression neutral despite the adrenaline now coursing through my veins.
"You know Angela?" Olivia asked, curiosity evident in her voice.
I took a steadying breath. "We've met. Years ago." The understatement felt bitter on my tongue. "You said she was with you last night?"
"Yes, we were at The Rain when we found you rather... intoxicated. You were quite insistent on talking to her."
So it hadn't been an alcohol-induced hallucination. Angela was really back in New York. And I had seen her-spoken to her even, though I couldn't remember what I'd said.
"I apologize for any inconvenience," I said, my voice carefully controlled. "I'd like to thank her personally for her assistance. Would you be able to arrange that? Today, if possible."
"I can call her right now," Olivia offered, already reaching for her phone.
I nodded, turning away to hide the intensity of my interest as I quickly dressed. After five years of wondering, of searching, of trying to forget-Angela was within reach again.
***
In the lobby, I waited near the concierge desk as Olivia spoke on the phone. Her animated gestures and occasional glances in my direction told me she was discussing me with Angela.
When she returned, her expression was slightly perplexed.
"That's odd," she said. "Angela claims she doesn't know you. Last night, she actually said you were sexual harassing her... but of course, I know that must have been a misunderstanding."
 Of course she'd deny knowing me. What had I expected?
But Sexual Harassing? What the hell？！
"She must have forgotten," I said smoothly. "It was a brief business meeting, years ago. How is she? I hope my behavior last night didn't upset her."
"She's fine," Olivia assured me. "She actually just moved back to New York from Italy last week. She's been living in Tuscany for the past five years."
My heart rate accelerated. Five years in Italy-exactly how long she'd been gone from New York. From me.
"Italy suits some people," I remarked casually. "Though I've always found New York more... stimulating."
"I can take you to her now. She's staying with me temporarily until she finds her own place."
In the back of the town car Olivia had called, I stared out at the passing cityscape, my thoughts racing faster than the vehicle cutting through Central Park.
What would I say when I saw her?
I hadn't shaved this morning-would I look too haggard?
"Mr. Shaw, would you mind if I got your number?" Olivia asked, breaking into my thoughts, her voice taking on a slightly flirtatious tone. "In case I need to reach you directly."
I removed a business card from my wallet and handed it to her. "This is my assistant Thomas's contact information. I rarely answer my personal phone, but he can always reach me."
She seemed slightly disappointed but took the card anyway. "And what business are you in, Mr. Shaw? You mentioned finance earlier?"
I detected the unmistakable note of interest in her voice-one I'd heard countless times from women at charity galas and business functions. I had no patience for it today.
"Yes, finance," I replied curtly, then feigned a sudden wave of fatigue. I closed my eyes and leaned my head against the window. "Please excuse me. I'm still feeling the effects of last night."
The silence that followed told me she'd received my message. I kept my eyes closed, feigning sleep while my mind raced with thoughts of seeing Angela again after all this time.
Upon arriving at Olivia's, I immediately started searching for Angela, barely noticing my surroundings.
"Angela must be out shopping with Christopher," Olivia said after searching the house.
"Christopher?"I stiffened at the name.
"Christopher Blake," Olivia clarified, missing the tension in my question. "You know him？"
"Yes"
I kept my expression neutral despite the surge of jealousy that name provoked. Christopher Blake-of course.
"When do you expect them back?" I asked.
"Hard to say. Shopping with Christopher can take hours-he's quite particular."
"I don't mind waiting," I said, settling onto the sofa. "I'd like to apologize properly."
Five years. Five years of searching, of wondering, of trying to understand why she'd vanished from my life without explanation.
And now, by sheer coincidence or fate, she had reappeared-and I stood in her temporary home, waiting for her return.
This time, I wouldn't let her disappear again. Not without answers.
###chapter 111: The Obsession That Shouldn't Be
Angela POV
"Angela, you're finally back!" Olivia exclaimed as we entered her apartment. "I haven't seen you all day. Was it a special date with Christopher?"
Christopher smiled slightly. "If you want to call it a date, I wouldn't object."
I felt heat rising to my cheeks. "We were looking at schools for Aria and Ethan," I explained, setting down my purse on the console table. "Nothing romantic about registration paperwork."
Guilt flashed across Olivia's face. "Oh my God, I completely forgot about that! I'm so sorry, Angela. I should have gone with you."
"It's fine," I assured her, helping Aria with her coat. "Christopher knows all the best private schools in the city."
I hung our coats in the closet, then turned to Olivia with practiced casualness. "By the way, you called me twice around noon. Was there something urgent?"
I watched as Olivia's expression flickered, her fingers suddenly twisting together. "No... nothing special. Just wondering when you'd be back."
My intuition immediately flared-she was hiding something. But I simply nodded, letting the matter drop.
"Aria, Ethan, go change into your house clothes," I instructed, watching the twins disappear down the hallway before turning back to the adults in the room.
Christopher leaned against the kitchen counter, his posture relaxed but his eyes sharp. "So, Olivia, how was your evening at that bar last night? Did you find what you were looking for?"
Olivia's head snapped toward him, then toward me, her eyes narrowing. "You told him? About the bar?"
"I was concerned," I said simply.
"Angela," Olivia's voice took on a hard edge I'd rarely heard before. "We agreed that even while living together, we'd maintain our independence and not interfere in each other's personal lives. Why would you tell Christopher about me going to a bar?"
"She was merely concerned for your safety," Christopher interjected smoothly, his voice gentle but firm. "Bars these days can be unpredictable environments, especially for a beautiful single woman."
I watched Olivia's expression soften slightly at the compliment, though resentment still lingered in her eyes. This concerned me even more-whenever anything related to Sean came up, Olivia seemed unable to control her emotions.
After her encounter with him at the hotel last night, her infatuation with him appeared to have deepened significantly.
Later in the kitchen, as we prepared dinner, I carefully sliced vegetables while Olivia seasoned the fish.
"So," I ventured, "did you manage to get that green-eyed man's contact information?"
"I did!" Olivia exclaimed excitedly. "He seems cold and distant, but I'm sure I can win him over!"
Olivia's knife paused mid-chop. "Angela," she said, not looking up from the cutting board, "you spent the whole day with Christopher, didn't you? He's been so good to you, even arranging accommodation in the city. If I insist on you staying here, would that interfere with your relationship development?"
I looked up at Olivia, feeling a wave of disappointment wash over me. Despite my outward composure, I could feel something shift between us-a subtle fracture in our friendship.
Dinner was a quiet affair. The tension around the table was palpable; even the twins seemed to sense it, eating quietly without their usual chatter and playfulness.
As we finished our meal, I looked at my children with a gentle smile. "Ethan, Aria, you both behaved very well tonight. Why don't you go rest in your room for a bit, then pack your things?"
From the corner of my eye, I saw Olivia's face drain of color.
"We'll be moving to a hotel downtown tonight," I explained calmly, my voice betraying none of the turmoil I felt inside.
The twins exchanged a quick glance before quietly excusing themselves from the table.
After they left, I deliberately took my time finishing the last bite of seafood salad, savoring the delicate flavors while gathering my thoughts.
"Angela, I'm sorry," Olivia whispered, her voice small.
"It's fine." I smiled.
I knew Olivia wasn't truly concerned about my relationship with Christopher. She simply didn't want me staying here to "interfere" with her pursuit of Sean.
In my room, I methodically packed our belongings while booking a suite at The Four Seasons on my phone. A soft knock interrupted my thoughts.
"Come in," I called, zipping my suitcase closed.
Ethan appeared in the doorway, his small frame silhouetted against the hallway light. "I've packed everything, Mama," he reported solemnly.
"And Aria?"
"She's ready too."
I wheeled my suitcase into the hallway, where Olivia stood waiting, her expression a complex mixture of regret and defiance.
"Are you really leaving?" she asked, arms crossed protectively over her chest.
"We need to be closer to the school for tomorrow's enrollment," I explained, the excuse sounding hollow even to my own ears. "It's more convenient."
"Let me drive you, at least," she offered.
"Thank you, but I've already called a car." I turned to my son. "Ethan, please go get your sister."
Olivia's eyes followed the boy as he disappeared into the guest bedroom.
"Before we go," I said quietly, turning back to my friend of many years, "I have something to say. You may not want to hear this, Olivia, but as your friend, I need to warn you-before falling for someone, make sure he's actually single. Make sure he doesn't have a girlfriend or fiancée. Don't end up hurting yourself." I picked up my handbag. "That's all I can say. We should go now."
I didn't wait for her response. The twins emerged from their room, Aria chattering excitedly about bringing Olivia chocolates from the hotel, both children seemingly oblivious to the tension between the adults.
As the apartment door closed behind us, worry gnawed at my heart. I knew I couldn't stop Olivia's infatuation with Sean-those green eyes had cast a spell too powerful to break with mere words.
Walking toward the elevator, I wondered if I should have told her the truth-that the mysterious green-eyed man was the father of my children, the husband I had deliberately left behind five years ago.
###chapter 112: Missing Her Again
Sean POV
The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office, casting long shadows across the desk where financial reports lay untouched. I'd been staring at the same page for twenty minutes, my mind elsewhere.
Yesterday afternoon, I waited for Angela until 9 PM. Then my mother, Victoria, called, urging me to attend a dinner banquet. I had intended to cancel, but she insisted-it was crucial for a key quarterly business deal.
Before departing, I had made sure to leave my phone number with that woman called Olivia.
"If Angela comes back, tell her I want to see her," I had instructed, my voice betraying none of the urgency I felt. "This is my personal number. Contact me immediately if you hear anything."
The memory of waiting in that brownstone, so close yet so far from Angela, had kept me awake most of the night. Five years of searching, and she had slipped through my fingers again.
Thomas knocked softly before entering my office. "Mr. Shaw, your car is ready. Your lunch appointment is in forty minutes."
"I'll be leaving now," I replied, rising from my chair and adjusting my tie. "I prefer to arrive early."
***
The private dining room door had just opened, I turned immediately, hope rising in my chest only to be crushed when Olivia entered alone.
"Mr. Shaw, hello," she greeted warmly, approaching with a confident smile. "I didn't expect you to arrive so early."
I didn't bother returning her greeting, my eyes searching the empty space behind her. "Where is Angela?"
Olivia's smile faltered. She set her designer handbag on the table, her expression a mixture of nervousness and awkwardness.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw. Angela couldn't make it. She had... other commitments." Olivia settled into a chair, gesturing for me to do the same. "But don't worry, I spoke with her last night about your wish to meet. She's forgiven your behavior from the other night."
I remained standing, studying her face. The slight twitch at the corner of her mouth told me she had never mentioned to Angela about my desire to meet. She was lying!
"She said that?" I asked, my voice deceptively calm. "She specifically said she forgives me?"
"Yes, of course," Olivia replied, her fingers nervously adjusting her napkin.
A cold laugh escaped me. "Hmm."
I buttoned my suit jacket in one fluid motion. This meeting was pointless. I was being played, and I had no time for games.
"I need to go," I said flatly, already heading for the door.
"Wait!" Olivia called after me. "What about lunch? I thought-"
I didn't slow my pace as I strode through the restaurant, ignoring the curious glances from other diners. Outside, I pulled out my phone and dialed Thomas's number.
"I need information on Angela Wilson," I instructed as I slid into the waiting car. " Check all high-end hotels, starting with The Four Seasons and The Plaza."
As the car pulled away from the curb, I glimpsed Olivia rushing out of the restaurant, looking flustered. My phone rang moments later, her name flashing on the screen.
"Yes?" I answered, keeping my voice neutral despite my growing irritation.
"Mr. Shaw, what just happened?" Olivia's voice was breathless. "Did I say something wrong? Is it because Angela couldn't come? I'm really sorry if I misled you, but the truth is, Angela moved out of my place last night with Christopher Blake. I couldn't exactly discuss you in front of him..."
At the mention of Christopher Blake's name, my body reacted before my mind could process the information. My foot slammed onto the brake pedal, causing the car to screech to a halt in the middle of the street. Horns blared around us as traffic swerved to avoid collision.
"Christopher Blake?" The name felt like acid on my tongue.
"Yes, Christopher Blake," Olivia confirmed, oblivious to the chaos she had just caused. "They've known each other for years. He's been very supportive of her and the children-"
I ended the call abruptly, my mind racing. Christopher Blake-my former friend, my business rival, the man who had always looked at Angela with poorly disguised longing. Of course he would be there to pick up the pieces when she returned.
How far had their relationship progressed?
Were they living together?
Had they married?
But I hadn't seen any news about Christopher dating or marrying anyone. And I'd never seen Angela attending any of his business functions.
If they were truly together, why would they keep it hidden?
But regardless of all that, I couldn't forget Angela's words during our last meeting five years ago, when she had looked me in the eye and said, "I love him. I love Christopher."
Three hours later, I received a call from Thomas. "I found her, sir. She's reportedly staying at the Four Seasons Hotel."
Without wasting a moment, I headed straight to the Four Seasons. Inside, I made a beeline for the reception desk.
"I need to speak with Angela Wilson," I stated without preamble. "What room is she in?"
The receptionist's smile remained fixed, though her eyes reflected caution. "I'm sorry, sir, but we cannot disclose guest information. Hotel policy."
Thomas stepped forward. "This is Sean Shaw, CEO of Shaw Group. It's an urgent business matter."
From the corner of my eye, I noticed a group of businessmen nudging each other and pointing in my direction.
"That's Sean Shaw," one whispered loudly enough for me to hear. "Shaw Group's CEO. He was on the cover of Forbes last year. They say getting an interview with him is nearly impossible."
The receptionist's expression remained professionally neutral. "I understand, Mr. Shaw, but I still cannot provide that information. The most I can tell you is that Ms. Wilson has already checked out. She left early this morning."
The news hit me like a physical blow, though I maintained my composure. After five years of searching, I had come tantalizingly close, only to miss her again.
"Did she leave any forwarding information?" I asked, already knowing the answer.
"No, sir, she did not."
I nodded once, turning away from the desk. I felt a surge of anger coursing through me.
"Thomas," I said as we exited the hotel, "call Blake Capital. I want a meeting with Christopher Blake. Today."
###chapter 113: The Knight at the Riding Club
Angela POV
Living in a hotel with two children proved challenging from the very first night.
The suite, while luxurious, wasn't designed for family living. By morning, I was already searching for apartments near the twins' new school, but the rental market offered nothing suitable on such short notice.
Christopher called early the next day, having heard about my abrupt departure from Olivia's.
"I have a house only a few blocks from the children's school."
I hesitated. "That's very generous, but I don't think it's appropriate."
The memory of that night at Olivia's-his unexpected advances-made me wary. I didn't want to be further indebted to him, and I certainly didn't want a repeat of that situation.
Christopher seemed to read my thoughts through the phone. "Angela, I don't live there. It's purely an investment property sitting empty. I'd rather rent it to someone I know than to strangers."
I considered his offer. The twins needed stability, and the location was perfect.
"I'll pay market rate," I said firmly.
"I wouldn't expect anything less," he replied, a smile evident in his voice.
***
After settling into our new home, I threw myself completely into establishing my new company.
Two weeks later, I stood in my newly rented office space, surveying the modest but elegant surroundings. Wilson Advisory Partners was officially operational, though barely staffed.
"Ms. Wilson?" Marcus Reynolds stood in the doorway, his tailored suit and confident posture reflecting his years at a top investment firm. Hiring him as my operations director had been my first real victory.
"Come in, Marcus. How did the interviews go today?"
He closed the door behind him. "Frankly, we're facing challenges. Our size and limited profile make it difficult to attract top talent."
"I expected that," I admitted, gesturing for him to sit. "What I don't understand is why someone with your experience would choose a startup like mine."
Marcus smiled. "I've followed your career since you were at Shaw Group. I spent five years climbing to senior management there, but always admired your approach to client management."
My stomach tightened at the mention of Shaw Group. "You worked at Shaw?"
"Until last month," he confirmed. "Which brings me to my suggestion-we need backing. Two obvious choices: Shaw Group or Lawrence Capital."
"Not Shaw," I said firmly, perhaps too quickly.
Marcus raised an eyebrow but nodded. "Lawrence Capital then. Though I should warn you, Tristan Lawrence has quite the... reputation with women."
"I'm aware," I replied, suddenly remembering the jacket I'd never returned after the charity auction. "Thank you for your candid assessment, Marcus."
That evening, scrolling through my contacts, I paused at Tristan Lawrence's name. After a moment's hesitation, I typed a message:
Mr. Lawrence, this is Angela Wilson. I still have your jacket from the charity auction. Perhaps we could meet so I can return it and discuss a potential business opportunity?
His reply came almost immediately:
Ms. Wilson, I was beginning to think you'd vanished with my favorite Armani. The jacket is merely collateral-I'd love to discuss business. Are you free tomorrow? Greenwich Equestrian Club at 2pm?
I grabbed my purse and scarf, already planning my approach. Lawrence Capital's investment could be exactly what my fledgling company needed.
The Greenwich Equestrian Club exuded old money and privilege. As my car pulled up to the entrance, I noticed a commotion on the main field.
A rider on a powerful black stallion was galloping at breakneck speed, executing jumps with reckless precision. The other riders gave him a wide berth, clearly intimidated.
His impressive performance drew cheers and screams from the ladies present. Another playboy, I thought to myself.
Tristan Lawrence waited at the entrance, immaculately dressed in riding attire.
"Angela, welcome," he greeted me with a charming smile.
"Thank you for meeting me, Mr. Lawrence."
"Please, call me Tristan," he insisted, taking my hand lightly.
"I prefer to maintain professional boundaries, Mr. Lawrence," I replied politely.
He laughed, not offended. "Come, let me show you around. Do you ride?"
"I'm afraid not."
"Then we'll have to remedy that someday," he said, guiding me toward the field. "The grounds here are exceptional."
As we approached, I noticed several women giving me curious glances. One whispered to another, and I caught fragments: "...Tristan's newest girl... never lasts more than..."
"Don't mind them," Tristan said loudly enough for them to hear. "Some people have nothing better to do than gossip."
The women turned away, but I could feel their eyes on my back as we continued walking.
Tristan waved to the skilled rider I had observed earlier, and I watched as he guided his horse in our direction.
My heart stopped.
The rider on the black stallion had pulled up nearby, his face now clearly visible despite the riding helmet. Though his features were set in a scowl, I would recognize those emerald eyes anywhere.
Sean.
My first instinct was to run, to flee before he noticed me. But it was too late-his gaze had already locked with mine.
###chapter 114: Encounter at the Riding Club
Angela POV
"Angela, let me introduce you to my opponent for today's race-Sean Shaw, CEO of Shaw Group."
My face paled instantly at Tristan's introduction, fighting to keep my composure. Know him? If only Tristan knew just how well.
"Sean and I have a friendly rivalry that goes back years," Tristan continued, oblivious to my distress. He turned to me with a charming smile. "Angela, would you like to ride with me? Experience the thrill from horseback?"
I searched frantically for an excuse, any reason to extract myself from this nightmare. But before I could formulate a response, Tristan was already guiding me closer to the field where Sean sat astride his powerful black stallion.
The sight of him after all these years sent electricity through my veins. Dressed entirely in black riding attire that emphasized his athletic build, his sharp features seemed even more defined than I remembered.
In one fluid motion, Sean dismounted, his movements betraying years of equestrian training.
His gaze fell on me like a blade, studying every inch of my face as if committing it to memory-or perhaps searching for changes the years had wrought.
"Angela is my companion today," Tristan announced, his hand possessively touching my elbow.
"Companion?" Sean's voice was low and dangerous, the single word carrying unmistakable skepticism.
Tristan's smile widened, clearly enjoying Sean's reaction. "What do you think? She's quite special, isn't she? For fairness, you should have a companion too."
A woman in riding attire who had been hovering nearby immediately stepped forward. "Mr. Shaw, please allow me! I'm Jessica, I can be your companion. I've studied equestrian sports and I'm not afraid."
"Of course," Tristan agreed with casual magnanimity. "This lady would be perfect."
Throughout this exchange, Sean's attention never wavered from me.
"No, I think I should-" I began, desperate to extricate myself from this situation.
"Don't worry," Jessica interrupted, taking my arm. "Let's go to the changing rooms and get you proper equipment."
As we walked toward the changing areas, Jessica couldn't contain her curiosity.
"Oh my God, how did you meet Mr. Lawrence? Are you his new girlfriend? I'm so envious!" She chattered excitedly as we moved through the elegant corridors of the Greenwich Equestrian Club.
I forced a polite smile, neither confirming nor denying her assumption.
"Could you share your secret? How did you attract Mr. Lawrence's attention? I'd love to learn your technique," she continued, lowering her voice conspiratorially.
It quickly became apparent that her real interest was Sean. Each question about Tristan seemed designed to extract information she could use in her own pursuit of Sean Shaw.
***
Alone in the changing room, I leaned against the wall and took a deep breath. The situation was impossible-I needed Lawrence Capital's backing for my fledgling company, which meant I couldn't afford to offend Tristan.
But facing Sean again, especially in such a public setting...
"Am I going to run away every time I encounter Sean?" I whispered to myself. "That's neither practical nor dignified."
With renewed determination, I removed my jacket and hung it carefully on the rack. I was just about to pull off my T-shirt when a sharp knock at the door interrupted me.
"Just a moment," I called out, assuming it was the woman returning.
I opened the door-and froze.
Sean Shaw stood in the doorway, his tall frame blocking the light from the hallway. Before I could react, he pushed inside, closing and locking the door behind him in one swift movement.
"What are you doing?" I hissed, lunging for the door handle.
Sean caught my wrist, pinning me against the door with his body. The familiar scent of his cologne-citrus and cedar-assaulted my senses, bringing unwelcome memories rushing back.
"Let me go, Sean," I demanded, struggling against his grip.
My hair came loose in the struggle, dark waves cascading over my shoulders. Sean reached out to touch it, his fingers brushing gently through the strands as his gaze followed the motion.
His eyes traveled over me with cold calculation, taking in every detail from my flushed face to my designer outfit.
"How generous of Christopher," he said, his voice laced with contempt. "He allows you to date other men? Clearly, he doesn't value you as much as I thought."
"Who?" I asked, confused, then quickly realized Sean was referring to Christopher. "His opinion of me is none of your concern," I retorted, chin lifting defiantly.
My continued struggles only brought our bodies into closer contact. I felt the moment Sean's body responded to our proximity-there was no mistaking the hardness pressing against my hip. Mortification washed over me, and I stilled immediately, heat rushing to my cheeks.
"You're disgusting," I spat.
"If you hadn't been squirming so much, this wouldn't have happened," he countered, his voice strained.
"Even if I moved, so what?" I challenged, fury overriding embarrassment. "Don't act like a stray dog with no self-restraint."
"What did you say?" His voice dropped dangerously low.
"Am I wrong?" I pressed. "If you're bold enough to act this way, you should be bold enough to hear it called what it is."
"Get out," I commanded, summoning every ounce of authority I possessed. "Now."
I pushed against his chest, and to my surprise, he stepped back slightly.
"If you continue like this," he warned, "I might show you what real loss of control looks like."
"Despicable," I hissed.
"Thank you for the compliment," he replied with a cold smirk.
Sean loosened his grip on me slightly. I immediately moved toward the door, desperate to escape before anything else could happen.
Just as my fingers touched the handle, a knock sounded, followed by the voice of Jessica.
"Hello? Does the riding outfit fit? Do you need any help?"
I froze. The last thing I needed was for anyone to discover Sean and me alone together in the changing room-the gossip would spread through New York's elite circles within hours.
"Not quite ready," I called back, trying to keep my voice steady. "Have you changed? Why don't you go ahead and I'll-ah!"
###chapter 115:Crazy Sex In The Changing Room
Angela POV
Suddenly, a large hand reached up from behind and grabbed my left breast through my T-shirt.
The unexpected touch made me gasp, my breath catching in surprise.
"What's wrong?"
Jessica must have heard me, and I couldn't tell if she was suspicious or just worried. I heard her turn the doorknob, trying to get in.
But Sean had already locked it earlier, so no matter how hard she twisted the handle, the door wouldn't budge.
"Why can't you open the door? Are you okay? Say something!"
"I'm fine," I managed to say, trying to steady my breath. "I just lost my balance for a second, almost fell. But I'm okay now."
"Really?" Her voice sounded unsure, but I could hear her hesitation. She wasn't leaving.
That's when Sean's fingers unhooked my bra with a flick. Panic surged through me, and a sharp scream slipped out.
His hands didn't stop-warm and insistent, they roamed over my skin, igniting a shiver I couldn't control.
My body trembled, caught between resistance and a traitorous ache I hadn't felt in years.
Jessica didn't seem to have gone anywhere yet. "Are you sure you're alright? If you want, you can open the door and let me check if you're hurt."
"No need," I said quickly, praying she'd just go away. "I'm almost done changing. You should head to the racetrack."
Sean's hand slid under my shirt, cupping my bare breast, his thumb brushing roughly against my nipple.
I bit my lip hard, stifling the sound threatening to escape.
Then his other hand clamped over my mouth, his breath hot against my ear as he whispered, "If you don't want anyone to hear, you'd better stay quiet."
His teeth grazed my right earlobe, and I flinched.
Jessica's footsteps finally faded. I exhaled shakily, relief washing over me-until I sank my teeth into his hand. He yanked it back with a hiss, then grinned, wicked and unrepentant.
"Still fierce as a cat," he said, his voice low and teasing.
I glared at him, my chest heaving.
"You're insane-this is a changing room!"
But he ignored me, pulling me closer until our bodies pressed together. His scent hit me-tobacco, earth, and something distinctly him.
I shoved at his chest, but it was like pushing a wall. He pinned me against it instead, his grip unrelenting.
"Five years, Angela," he growled, his tone thick with longing and frustration.
"Do you know how much I've missed you?"
His hand slipped under my shirt again, skin on skin, kneading my breast with a need that made my breath hitch.
I clenched my jaw, fighting the heat pooling in my core, but my body betrayed me-it remembered him too well, every touch, every press of his fingers igniting echoes of a past I'd sworn to forget.
"Let me go,"
I snapped, my voice shaking with a fury I barely felt over the chaos inside me.
I wanted him gone-out of my life, out of my head-but my skin flushed under his touch, craving more even as I recoiled.
He didn't let go.
His lips crashed against my neck, teeth scraping my collarbone as his other hand fumbled with my pants, popping the button open with a reckless urgency.
His fingers slid inside my underwear, bold and unhesitating, brushing against me with a familiarity that made my knees weak.
I grabbed his wrist, trying to stop him, but he was stronger-always had been.
His touch was deliberate, sliding, pressing, until wetness coated his fingers, and I hated how my hips twitched in response, a silent confession I couldn't take back.
"Don't pretend," he rasped, his breath ragged against my skin. "You still want me-I can feel it."
His fingers thrust deeper, and a muffled whimper escaped me, my legs buckling as I gripped his shoulders to stay upright.
My mind screamed no, but my body sang yes, and the contradiction tore at me like a blade.
I wanted to be done with him-truly done.
I'd spent years building walls, convincing myself I was free of Sean, free of the chaos he brought into my life.
But here, pinned against this cold wall, my resolve crumbled under the weight of his touch.
I despised myself for it-for the way my pulse raced, for the way I still felt that flicker of longing when I'd sworn he meant nothing to me anymore.
How could I still be this weak? How could my body revel in him when my heart wanted him erased?
His phone rang, shrill and jarring, shattering the moment.
I jolted, but Sean didn't stop.
He pulled it from his pocket with his free hand, glanced at the screen-Tristan-and answered without hesitation.
"What?" he barked, his fingers still moving inside me, relentless.
I squirmed, torn between shoving him off and the shameful pulse building beneath his touch, a fire I couldn't extinguish.
"Man, where are you?" Tristan's voice crackled through the speaker. "The race is about to start."
"I'm busy," Sean said curtly, his eyes locked on mine, dark with intent. His thumb circled me now, slow and torturous, and I dug my nails into his arm, biting back a moan that threatened to betray me completely.
"Busy? With what? Get your ass out here!" Tristan sounded impatient.
"I said I'm busy," Sean snapped, hanging up.
He tossed the phone onto the bench with a clatter, then grabbed my hips, spinning me to face the wall.
Before I could protest, he yanked my pants down to my knees, his erection pressing hard against me through his jeans.
"I'm not waiting another second," he muttered, unzipping himself with a sound that echoed in the small space.
"Sean, no-" My voice cracked, raw with desperation, but he was already there, nudging my thighs apart.
The blunt heat of him pushed inside, stretching me, and I gasped, my hands splaying against the wall for balance.
He groaned, low and guttural, as he thrust-deep, possessive, claiming me like no time had passed.
My body clenched around him, torn between resistance and a surrender I couldn't stop.
Five years, and he still fit like he belonged there, like my flesh had never forgotten.
His pace quickened, one hand gripping my hip, the other sliding up to squeeze my breast again.
"You're mine," he breathed against my neck, his voice shaking with need. "You've always been mine."
Each word punctuated a thrust, and I couldn't stop the sounds spilling from me-soft, broken, desperate.
The pleasure crashed over me, but so did the guilt, the confusion, the hate. It was too much-too complicated. My chest tightened, and suddenly, the dam broke.
"How can you do this to me?" I choked out, my voice cracking as tears spilled down my cheeks.
I hated him, hated myself more, for the way my heart still stuttered at his touch.
Sean froze, his breath halting as he felt the shift.
His lips brushed my tears, kissing them away with a tenderness that clashed with everything he'd just done.
Then he stopped, pulling back slightly, his hands falling to his sides. He stared at me, lost, his expression crumbling into something uncertain.
"Angela, I'm sorry," he whispered, his voice rough with regret, but it was too late. The tears wouldn't stop, and neither would the storm inside me.
###chapter 116: Prove She Was Still Mine
Sean's POV
For two weeks, I hunted for her, tearing through every lead I could scrape together. Old friends, her favorite coffee shop, anywhere she might've left a trace.
Nothing.
Desperate, I even called Christopher, choking on the suspicion that she'd run to him, that they were together now.
The thought burned like acid, but he stonewalled me. "I don't know where she is," he said, flat and final, before cutting the line. I didn't know if he was lying, but it didn't matter-I was still nowhere.
Then last night Tristan hit me up about some racetrack outing.
"Got a meeting with this woman-stunning, brilliant. She's launching a company, and I might invest. Come check it out." Tristan said excitedly over the phone.
I wasn't in the mood for his conquest stories.
"Not interested in your women, Tris," I said, "but I'll hear the pitch. Need something to do."
He laughed, carefree as ever, and I figured a day out might dull the edge of my obsession.
I never saw it coming.
We got to the racetrack, the air thick with dust and horse sweat, and Tristan dragged me over to meet his "stunning founder."
There she was-Angela. My Angela. 
She wore a fitted jacket and jeans that clung to her like a second skin, her dark hair glinting in the sun. When she turned and saw me, her face went pale, her mouth dropping open in shock.
It was almost satisfying, watching her squirm. Five years of nothing, and now she couldn't hide from me.
She didn't stick around long. After a few minutes of Tristan's chatter about her startup-some tech thing I didn't care about-she mumbled an excuse about changing for the next race and bolted.
I didn't think twice. I followed her, my pulse hammering as I tracked her to the changing room. She didn't notice me until I slipped in behind her and locked the door with a quiet snap.
"Sean-what are you doing?" Her voice was sharp, edged with panic as she spun to face me.
I didn't answer, just closed the distance until she was backed against the wall. She smelled like jasmine and memories, and it hit me like a drug.
"Five years, Angela," I said, my voice low and jagged with everything I'd held in. "You left me. No warning, no goodbye. Just gone."
She pushed at me, her palms flat against my chest, but it was useless-I wasn't budging.
"Get out-this isn't-" Her words died as my hand slid up her side, brushing the swell of her breast through her T-shirt.
She froze, her breath catching, and I couldn't stop myself. I lifted her shirt, my fingers sliding under the fabric and pulling it up.
Her skin was warm, smooth, and when I unhooked her bra with a quick twist, her breasts spilled free-full, perfect, the way I'd dreamed of them too many nights.
"Sean, stop-" she hissed, but her voice wavered, and her body didn't fight half as hard as her words did.
I pressed myself closer, my thigh nudging between hers, feeling the heat radiating off her.
"You don't get to tell me to stop," I growled, my hand cupping her bare breast, thumb grazing her nipple until it stiffened under my touch. "Not after you ran. Not after you left me to rot."
Her head tipped back against the wall, a shaky exhale slipping out as I rolled her nipple between my fingers, harder now, watching her fight the shiver running through her.
I yanked her jeans open, my hand diving inside, past the waistband of her underwear. She was already wet-slick and hot against my fingers-and it drove me wild, knowing she still reacted to me like this.
I pushed two fingers inside her, deep and deliberate, feeling her clench around me as her hips jerked involuntarily.
"You're mine," I rasped, my voice thick with a possessiveness I couldn't rein in. "You don't get to disappear and act like this doesn't belong to me."
She grabbed my wrist, trying to pull me away. I thrust my fingers deeper, curling them, and she bit her lip hard, a muffled whimper escaping as her knees trembled.
I couldn't wait anymore.
I spun her around, shoving her jeans and underwear down to her thighs. My cock sprang free, throbbing with need.
I gripped her hips, pulling her back against me, and pushed inside her with one hard thrust. She gasped, her hands braced against the wall, and I groaned at how tight she was, how she fit me like she'd never left.
"Fuck, Angela," I muttered, my breath hot against her neck as I started moving, deep and relentless, claiming every inch of her.
Her body responded despite herself-her back arched, her walls pulsed around me-and it fueled the fire in my gut.
I slid one hand around to her front, fingers finding her clit, rubbing tight circles as I pounded into her.
"You feel that?"
I whispered, my lips brushing her ear.
"You can't run from this."
Her breaths came in short, ragged bursts, and I felt her tightening, teetering on the edge.
Someone knocked on the door-a girl's voice, asking if she was okay-but Angela stammered out a quick "I'm fine" before I could even pause. Good enough.
My phone buzzed a minute later-Tristan-but I hung up the phone quickly, too lost in her to care.
I thrust harder, my grip bruising on her hips, my other hand still working her clit until she shuddered, a choked cry slipping out as she came apart around me. It pushed me over too, and I buried myself deep, spilling inside her with a low groan, my forehead pressed to her shoulder.
But then she broke.
"How can you do this to me?" she whispered, her voice cracking, and I felt the wet heat of tears against my skin.
I pulled back, stunned, and saw them streaming down her face-raw, unguarded, cutting through me like a knife.
My anger drained away, replaced by a hollow ache. I reached out, brushing her tears with my thumb, my lips following, kissing them away with a tenderness I didn't know I could still muster.
"Angela, shit-I'm sorry," I said, my voice rough and unsteady.
She wouldn't look at me, her shoulders trembling, and I felt like the ground was slipping out from under me.
I'd wanted her so badly-wanted to prove she was still mine-but now she was crying, and I didn't know what to do.
My hands hovered uselessly, afraid to touch her again, afraid I'd already gone too far. Five years of pent-up fury had poured out of me, but seeing her like this-broken, hurting-it gutted me.
What if I'd fucked it up for good this time? What if she walked away again, and I couldn't follow? The thought clawed at my chest, and I stood there, helpless, terrified of losing her all over again.
###chapter 117: Riding the Same Horse
Angela POV
"Angela! Are you ready? The race is about to start!" Tristan's voice called through the door of the changing room.
I took several deep breaths, wiping away the last traces of tears. Focus, Angela. You're here for Wilson Advisory Partners. This is about the future of your company-your children's future.
What happened with Sean was a mistake. A momentary lapse. Five years of carefully rebuilding my life wouldn't be undone by one encounter, no matter how intense.
I yanked my arm from Sean's lingering grip. "Get out," I commanded, my voice shaking but firm.
Sean studied me silently, his emerald eyes revealing a storm of emotions I refused to decipher. After what felt like an eternity, he adjusted his clothing and walked toward the door without another word.
Once alone, I hesitated. Part of me wanted to flee, but the rational side of my brain prevailed. Lawrence Capital's investment was too important. I couldn't sabotage a potential partnership because of personal complications.
I slipped into the riding outfit the club had provided-the smallest size available. It fit reasonably well, though it felt tight across my chest. Professional. Composed. That's what I needed to be.
Through the slightly ajar door, I glimpsed Tristan and Jessica approaching-likely coming to check on my "fall." Their steps faltered when Sean emerged from the direction of the women's changing area.
"Mr. Shaw?" Jessica's voice was high with surprise. "Why are you coming from there?"
Tristan looked puzzled, but Sean ignored them completely, his jacket draped casually over his arm as he strode past.
When Tristan moved toward the changing room, Sean's voice cut through the air like ice. "Where do you think you're going?"
"To check on Angela. She might be hurt," Tristan explained, perplexed by Sean's sudden interest.
Sean's eyes narrowed dangerously. Before the situation could escalate, I pushed the door open and stepped out.
All eyes turned to me. Tristan's gaze lingered appreciatively on my fitted riding gear, and I felt Sean's intense stare burning into me though I deliberately avoided meeting it.
"I'm fine," I assured Tristan with a practiced smile, walking directly toward him. "Though I should warn you-I've never ridden before. I hope that's not a problem?"
"Not at all," Tristan replied, clearly pleased by my presence. "I'll guide you through it."
"Wonderful. And after the race, we can discuss the investment proposal for Wilson Advisory Partners?" I added, maintaining my professional focus.
"Absolutely," he agreed immediately, offering his arm.
At the field, stable hands led out two magnificent horses-a sleek black Arabian and a muscular brown Thoroughbred. Their imposing size made my stomach tighten with apprehension.
"The rules are simple," a staff member explained. "There's a red flag at the summit of the eastern ridge. First to retrieve it wins."
I nodded, watching as Sean effortlessly mounted the black Arabian. His movements were fluid, confident-clearly he'd done this countless times before.
Jessica sidled closer to him, seemingly eager for the opportunity to ride together. Meanwhile, Tristan approached me, preparing to help me onto the Thoroughbred.
Suddenly, Sean guided his horse directly in front of us, blocking our path. "Get on," he commanded, his eyes fixed on me.
I stood frozen, deliberately ignoring him. This was about business-my company's future depended on impressing Tristan.
"I said, get on," Sean repeated, his authoritative tone making everyone around us tense, even the club staff.
I lifted my chin. "You're mistaken, Mr. Shaw. I'm Mr. Lawrence's guest, not yours."
Sean's eyes narrowed to dangerous slits. Without warning, he surged forward on his Arabian, the powerful animal releasing a piercing neigh as it charged toward me.
Gasps erupted around us. Tristan shouted, "Shaw! Have you lost your mind?" and attempted to pull me behind him.
Before I could fully process what was happening, Sean's arm shot out, gripping my waist. With one powerful motion, he hoisted me up onto his horse in front of him. The movement was rough but precisely executed.
As Sean urged the horse forward, I instinctively clutched his jacket, terrified of falling. I'd never been on horseback before, and the animal's powerful movements beneath me were disorienting.
Sean pulled me more securely against him, positioning me properly on the saddle. Once we'd stopped a short distance away, I found my voice.
"What the hell do you think you're doing?" I demanded, though my fingers still gripped his arm tightly, feeling the taut muscles beneath his shirt.
"Saving you from certain injury," he replied coldly. "Would you really trust Lawrence's riding? He broke two ribs at a charity event in the Hamptons last year. Wall Street Journal covered the 'incident'-man can barely stay on a horse."
Tristan had galloped up beside us, his face flushed with anger. "Shaw, what gives you the right to take my guest? Do you two know each other?"
"Your guest?" Sean's voice carried a clear threat.
"I invited her here as a potential business partner," Tristan insisted. "Return her to me immediately."
Looking back, I saw Tristan standing defeated, reluctantly turning to Jessica. "Care to join me instead?" I imagined him saying as Jessica hesitantly climbed onto his horse, her eyes still fixed on Sean.
I faced forward again, acutely aware of Sean's arms encircling me as he held the reins.
Sean paid no heed to the interruption, his focus unwavering as he expertly guided the horse toward the starting line.
His strong arms encircled me, his hands sliding possessively around my waist, fingers pressing into the curve of my hips with a quiet, commanding confidence.
I could feel the warmth of his broad chest flush against my back, his breath hot and steady near my ear, carrying a scent that was unwelcomely familiar.
I felt it, clear and strong-his hard-on pressing against me as we moved with the saddle's rhythm.
Instinctively, I squirmed in his embrace, my body twisting against his in a futile attempt to reclaim some distance, some semblance of control.
But the friction only heightened the tension.
"Stop moving, Angela," Sean murmured, his voice low and edged with a warning, his grip tightening to still me.
"You'll throw us off balance-trust me, you don't want to fall. It's a long way down, and I'd hate to see you hurt." His words were practical, but the husky timbre of his tone betrayed something more, a subtle challenge woven into the restraint.
Trapped in his arms, my heart raced, torn between defiance and the dangerous thrill of the moment.
I hated how my body instinctively remembered his-hated the conflict raging inside me.
For five years I'd convinced myself I was free of Sean Shaw, yet here I was, literally and figuratively unable to escape his grasp.
And the race hadn't even started yet.
###chapter 118: Two Men's Bet
Angela POV
Tristan Lawrence approached on his Thoroughbred, his expression a mixture of annoyance and determination. His gaze darted between Sean and me, clearly displeased at seeing me on Sean's horse.
"Just racing is too dull, Shaw," Tristan called out, his voice carrying across the field. "Care to add a wager to make things interesting?"
Sean barely acknowledged him, seemingly preoccupied with my presence in his arms. The warmth of his chest against my back was an unwelcome reminder of our earlier encounter in the changing room.
"Mr. Lawrence," I attempted to speak, desperate to salvage my business opportunity. "About the investment proposal we were discussing-"
"What's the wager?" Sean interrupted coldly, his voice vibrating against my shoulder.
Tristan's eyes gleamed with calculation. "If I win, we race again. And you return Ms. Wilson to me!"
I stiffened. How dare they treat me like a prize to be won? I opened my mouth to protest but found myself silenced by the sudden tension in Sean's body.
"Don't even think about it," Sean's voice dropped dangerously low. "And you won't beat me anyway."
"Are you afraid to accept?" Tristan taunted. "I'm brave enough to issue the challenge. Are you brave enough to accept it?"
I felt Sean's breathing change against my back, recognizing the signs of his temper rising. I'd witnessed it countless times during our marriage-the slight hesitation before the storm.
"Fine," Sean finally responded. "Here's my wager: if I win, you stay away from her. Completely."
Tristan's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Good God, Shaw, that's rather extreme!"
"So, are we betting or not?" Sean asked coldly.
Tristan turned to Jessica, who was perched nervously behind him. "What do you think? We have to beat him!"
Jessica clutched his jacket tightly. "I think safety should be our priority..."
I silently agreed with Jessica's assessment. These men were turning a simple race into something dangerous, all for their egos. And somehow, I'd become the prize in their childish competition.
An official from the club approached, clipboard in hand. "The race will begin shortly, gentlemen."
Tristan tightened his grip on the reins, determination written across his features. The official continued, "As a reminder, the first rider to retrieve the red flag at the summit wins. There's also a special prize from the club waiting for the victor."
As the countdown began-"Ten, nine, eight..."-I attempted to swing my leg over and dismount. Sean's arm instantly tightened around my waist, preventing my escape.
"Seven..." the official called.
Sean's lips brushed against my ear, sending an unwelcome shiver down my spine. "If you're scared, you can turn and hold onto me."
I was formulating a scathing retort when the official shouted, "Go!"
Tristan shot forward immediately, with Jessica releasing a terrified squeal. "Mr. Lawrence, please slow down! Safety first!"
"Safety is nothing," Tristan called back. "Winning is everything!"
To my confusion, Sean remained motionless at the starting line, making no effort to pursue Tristan's rapidly disappearing form. The silence stretched between us until I couldn't bear it any longer.
"What are you doing?" I finally demanded. "Are you trying to lose the race?"
His response came as a low rumble against my back. "What, worried you'll have to go back to Lawrence if I lose?"
I let out a cold laugh. "Why would I worry? It's better for me if you lose. I came here to discuss financing with Mr. Lawrence, after all."
Sean's body went rigid. His voice, when it came, was dangerously quiet. "What did you just say? Say it again."
"If you're so eager to hear it," I challenged, "I can repeat it twice, even ten times."
Before I could continue, Sean spurred the horse forward with such sudden ferocity that I was thrown back against his chest. The Arabian stallion leaped into motion, racing down the track with breathtaking speed.
Despite my outward composure, my body betrayed me. The force of acceleration pushed me firmly against Sean, my hands instinctively gripping his thighs for stability. I hated the weakness, hated how my body remembered his-remembered the security of his embrace even as my mind rejected it.
"Why so quiet now?" Sean taunted, his breath hot against my ear. His arm held me securely, preventing me from falling despite the breakneck pace.
I refused to respond, focusing instead on controlling my racing heart.
"Turn around and face me," Sean suggested, his voice holding an amused challenge.
"How is that even possible?" I snapped, irritation breaking through my resolve.
Sean's chest vibrated with a low chuckle. "I'll make you win," he promised, the words carrying an intensity that went beyond the race.
The Arabian stallion thundered along the designated track, its powerful strides eating up the distance. The cold wind whipped my long hair, occasional strands catching against Sean's neck.
"Why didn't you tie your hair back?" Sean asked, his voice tight with annoyance.
I bit my tongue, remembering exactly why my hair was loose-my hair clip had broken during our encounter in the changing room. Another thing to blame him for.
We rode for nearly twenty minutes without any sign of Tristan and Jessica. As we approached a fork in the trail, my curiosity got the better of me.
"Where are they?" I asked, scanning the landscape.
"There are three routes to the summit," Sean explained. "Two official tracks and one shortcut trail." He pulled the horse to a stop at the junction. "Which way do you want to go?"
"Why would that matter to me?" I replied coldly, though internally I was calculating the fastest route to victory-and to concluding this nightmare of an afternoon.
Sean's voice turned calculating. "Lawrence might take the shortcut to win. If we take it too and encounter them on that narrow path, things could get dangerous."
When I didn't respond, Sean guided the horse toward the smallest trail. It was barely visible, winding up the hillside through dense trees.
"What are you doing?" I asked, alarm evident in my voice.
"Helping you win," Sean stated simply as the horse plunged onto the narrow path.
The shortcut initially seemed wider than I had feared, but as we continued, it narrowed treacherously, twisting sharply between rocks and trees. The horse moved with surprising agility, but several times I felt certain we would tumble off the edge. Each time, Sean's expert control pulled us back from disaster.
My fingers dug into his forearms as we navigated a particularly sharp turn, the horse's hooves sliding slightly on loose gravel. I bit back a scream, hating my weakness, hating that after five years of building independence, one afternoon with Sean had reduced me to this-trembling and dependent on his protection.
By the time the path widened again, I was exhausted from tension, my body slumped against Sean's chest despite my best efforts to maintain distance. The admission of defeat burned like acid in my throat.
Just as Sean had predicted, the shortcut brought us to the summit first. The red flag was still planted at the designated spot, with an elegantly wrapped gift box beside it.
I straightened myself, preparing to dismount and claim the flag. Without warning, Sean's arms tightened around me, pulling me firmly against his chest in an embrace that spoke of desperation more than victory.
In the stillness of the mountain peak, I could hear the powerful rhythm of his heartbeat. Gone was the sarcasm, the coldness, the aggression-replaced by raw emotion as he held me like I might disappear at any moment.
"Five years," he whispered against my hair, his voice as soft as the mountain breeze. "You finally came back." The words hung between us for a moment before dissipating into the wind.
###chapter 119: Don't You Dare Let Her On Your Horse
Angela POV
"Do you plan to keep holding me like this?"
Sean's movements froze. After a moment that stretched too long, he finally loosened his grip.
"Fine. Let's get the flag first," he replied, his voice carefully controlled.
Sean dismounted with practiced ease, landing gracefully on the rocky terrain. He extended his hand toward me, clearly expecting to help me down. I deliberately ignored his offering, awkwardly sliding off the powerful stallion on my own. The effort left me slightly unsteady, but I'd rather stumble than accept his assistance.
Sean's eyes narrowed dangerously at my rejection. I strode directly toward the red flag, purposely ignoring the beautifully wrapped gift box sitting beside it.
"Damn it, Shaw, you crafty bastard!" Tristan Lawrence called out as he approached on horseback. "You got here before me."
Jessica, clinging behind him, looked deathly pale. When Tristan turned to berate her for not suggesting the shortcut, she could only respond with a nauseated sound.
"Ms. Wilson," Tristan began, climbing down from his horse, "about that investment proposition-"
Sean stepped forward, blocking his path. "I believe we had a wager, Lawrence," he reminded him coldly. "If I won, you stay away from her. Completely."
"Come on, Shaw," Tristan attempted to negotiate, "surely we can make an exception for business matters?"
Sean's emerald eyes flashed dangerously. The barely contained fury was evident in the rigid set of his jaw and the way his knuckles whitened as he clenched his fists.
Tristan glanced between us, clearly sensing the tension crackling in the air. "Alright, alright. I won't speak to her for now. I admit defeat. Happy?"
I prepared to follow Tristan. This entire excursion had been about securing Lawrence Capital's investment for my company. As I passed Sean, he quickly captured my wrist.
"Did I say you could leave?" he asked, his voice low.
I looked down at his hand, then back to his face. Inch by deliberate inch, I freed myself from his grip, my movements elegant but resolute.
"Five years, Sean," I said, giving his hand a final push away. "What makes you think you still have any claim on me? That you can touch me whenever you want? In the future, please show basic respect, or I'll consider your behavior harassment."
Sean's pupils dilated slightly, his breathing becoming dangerously rapid.
"Do you understand?" I pressed, meeting his gaze unflinchingly.
Without waiting for his response, I walked past him with composed dignity.
"Are you with Christopher Blake now?" Sean called after me.
My footsteps faltered momentarily, but I didn't turn around.
"That's none of your business," I replied, continuing to walk away, my back perfectly straight.
"Mr. Lawrence," I approached Tristan with professional poise, "while it's unfortunate we couldn't ride together, I hope you might spare some time to discuss potential business cooperation?"
Tristan seemed ready to decline, but as I outlined my vision for Wilson Advisory Partners, his expression shifted. I could see him reconsidering as I presented the market opportunities my firm could capitalize on.
"Very well, Ms. Wilson. We can talk," he conceded.
I turned to Jessica. "Would you like to join us?"
Jessica shook her head, her gaze drifting toward Sean. "No thanks. I'm not about to pass up an opportunity with a man you're not interested in."
I felt a flicker of confusion-did Jessica not know about Sean's relationship with Christina? Why were all these women so captivated by Sean? Still, I respected her decision.
"The descent is quite long," Tristan noted. "Would you like to ride down together?"
I inwardly recoiled at the thought of getting back on a horse, but considering the investment opportunity at stake, I steeled myself to accept.
"Don't you dare let her on your horse," Sean's voice cut through the air like a whip.
"Perhaps I should call a car for us," Tristan quickly amended.
I exhaled with quiet relief.
***
The car seating arrangement turned into an absurd power play. Sean claimed the back seat immediately.
I attempted to take the front passenger seat to avoid him, but he insisted Tristan sit there instead. When I refused to move, Sean threatened to prevent the car from leaving at all.
After an uncomfortable standoff, Jessica volunteered for the front seat. Tristan tried to enter the back first but was harshly rebuffed by Sean. I finally slid in, followed by Tristan, with Sean completing our uncomfortable trio.
Even then, Sean wasn't satisfied, repeatedly ordering Tristan to move further toward the door until the poor man finally snapped.
"For God's sake, Shaw!" Tristan exploded. "What's your problem? I'm practically plastered against the door! Do you want me to get out?"
"That would be perfect," Sean replied coldly.
"Why don't you get out instead?" I suggested to Sean.
"Are you sure?" His voice dropped dangerously. "If I leave, you're coming with me."
I ignored his threat, closing my eyes and pretending to rest. The entire display was childish and exhausting.
The journey down the mountain took nearly forty minutes.
Despite my intention to merely pretend, I genuinely fell asleep. I was vaguely aware of movement, but the exhaustion of the day pulled me under completely.
The shrill ring of my phone jolted me awake. Without opening my eyes, I reached for it.
"Hello?" I answered groggily.
"Just waking up?" Christopher's voice came through. "Where are you?"
"In a car," I mumbled, adjusting my position slightly.
"Sleeping in a car?" His concern was evident. "Angela, didn't you sleep well last night?"
I suddenly realized I was leaning against something firm and warm-Sean's shoulder. My eyes flew open in horror.
"Comfortable?" Sean asked loudly, deliberately making his presence known.
A tense silence followed on the other end of the line. "Angela," Christopher's voice tightened, "who are you with?"
"I'll explain later," I promised, politely declining his offer to pick me up. After ending the call, I felt a knot forming in my stomach. The last thing I needed was complications between these two men.
I straightened up immediately, returning to my original position.
"Leaning on my shoulder, was it comfortable?" Sean asked, his tone heavy with implication.
I gave him a cold look. "I'm a disciplined sleeper. I wouldn't randomly lean on you."
Sean smirked. "You clearly don't know yourself very well. How would a sleeping person know what they're doing? You always used to cling to me in your sleep and deny it afterward. Seems your ex-husband knows you better than you know yourself, doesn't he?"
###chapter 120: Some of the Kids Thought He Was Our Daddy
Angela POV
"Ex-husband?" Tristan's voice broke the silence, disbelief etched across his features. He looked between Sean and me, his eyes widening with each passing second. "You two were married?"
Jessica's gasp from the front seat was audible. "Oh my God," she whispered, turning to stare at us.
I maintained my composure despite my racing heart. Great, he's really determined to create chaos wherever he goes, I thought, feeling Sean's expectant gaze on me.
"I apologize, Angela," Tristan said, leaning forward slightly. "Had I known about your... history with Shaw, I never would have arranged this meeting."
"It's fine," I replied, my voice steadier than I felt. "Whatever existed between us ended five years ago."
Sean's jaw tightened visibly. "Did it?"
I ignored him, turning to face Tristan directly. "I hope this won't affect our business discussion. My company's proposal stands on its own merits."
"Of course," Tristan nodded, professional courtesy overtaking his curiosity. "My office, tomorrow at ten? We can discuss the investment terms without... distractions."
"Perfect," I agreed, relieved to salvage something from this disaster of a day.
At the club entrance, I hurried out of the car, eager to escape. I could feel Sean's intense stare following me as I gathered my things, his gaze like a physical presence I couldn't ignore.
I checked my watch and cursed under my breath. The meeting with Tristan had thrown off my entire schedule, and now I was running late to pick up the twins.
Rushing into the school building, I found the hallways eerily quiet, most children already collected by their parents. A knot of anxiety formed in my stomach as I approached the classroom.
Mrs. Peterson, the twins' teacher, looked up with a warm smile. "Mrs. Wilson, you just missed them."
"Missed them?" My voice rose sharply. "What do you mean?"
"Their father picked them up about ten minutes ago," she explained casually. "He mentioned you might be running late due to a business meeting."
The blood drained from my face. "Their father?"
Mrs. Peterson's expression changed, noting my distress. "Yes, the gentleman who came with you during registration? Mr. Blake, I believe?"
Relief washed over me so powerfully my knees nearly buckled. Christopher, not Sean. Of course it was Christopher.
"I apologize for my reaction," I said, composing myself. "I was concerned it might have been someone else... someone I didn't authorize."
Mrs. Peterson nodded sympathetically. "We would never release children to unauthorized individuals, Mrs. Wilson. Mr. Blake is listed as an emergency contact."
"Thank you," I replied, already turning to leave. "And please, call me Angela."
***
The aroma of roasting chicken greeted me as I entered our new home. Maria, the housekeeper Christopher had recommended, was bustling around the kitchen, humming softly as she prepared dinner.
"Mama!" Aria's voice rang out as she raced toward me, dark curls bouncing with each step. Ethan followed more sedately, his reserved smile brightening his serious little face.
I knelt, gathering them both into my arms, inhaling their familiar scent. "How was your first day at school, my darlings?"
Before they could answer, Christopher appeared in the doorway of the living room, a gentle smile on his face. His amber eyes swept over me, observant as always, lingering briefly on my slightly disheveled hair and the faded lipstick I hadn't had time to reapply.
"You look exhausted," he commented, his tone careful. "Challenging meeting?"
I nodded, grateful he didn't press for details. "Something like that."
"Mama, Blake uncle took us to get ice cream after school!" Ethan announced, his usual reserve momentarily forgotten.
"Did he now?" I gave Christopher a mock-accusing glance.
He shrugged unapologetically. "First day of school deserves a celebration."
"I had three scoops!" Aria declared proudly.
"Three?" I raised an eyebrow. "No wonder you're bouncing off the walls."
Christopher laughed. "I may have been overruled on portion sizes."
As Maria announced dinner was ready, I found myself relaxing into the domestic scene. Christopher helped set the table while the twins chattered about their day, their voices filling the house with warmth I hadn't realized I'd been missing.
"Will you stay for dinner?" I asked Christopher, surprising myself with how much I wanted him to say yes.
"If you'll have me," he replied simply.
Throughout the meal, I couldn't help but notice how naturally Christopher fit into our little family unit-helping Aria cut her chicken, engaging Ethan in conversation about his math class, seamlessly becoming part of our lives in a way I'd never anticipated.
After dinner and dessert, Maria packed up her things and headed home, leaving the four of us alone in the quiet house.
"It's getting late," Christopher observed, helping me clear the last of the dishes. "Would you mind if I stayed in the guest room tonight? I've had wine, and I'd rather not drive."
The twins had already been bathed and were selecting books for bedtime in their room. I glanced at the clock-nearly ten.
"Of course," I replied, setting down the dish towel. "I'll prepare the room for you."
While Christopher showered, I prepared the guest room, smoothing fresh sheets onto the bed. I was so absorbed in my task that I didn't hear him approach until his arms slipped around my waist from behind, gentle but firm.
I stiffened immediately, memories of Sean's forceful touch at the riding club flashing through my mind. Christopher must have felt my reaction, because he loosened his grip but didn't pull away completely.
"I'm not going to force anything, Angela," he whispered, his voice achingly tender. "I just wanted to give you a goodnight hug. Nothing more, unless you want it."
Shame and relief battled within me. Had I really thought Christopher would pressure me? After all these years of unfailing respect and support?
"I'm sorry," I murmured, awkwardly stepping away. "The room's ready. Goodnight, Christopher."
"Goodnight, Angela."
Instead of returning to my own bedroom, I slipped into Aria's room. My daughter beamed at my appearance, immediately scooting over to make room.
"A sleepover with Mama!" she exclaimed, clapping her hands excitedly.
I smiled, settling beside her. "What story would you like tonight?"
"Tell me about your day first," she said, snuggling against my side. "Did you do important business things?"
"I tried," I laughed softly. "How was your first day at the new school? Did you make friends?"
Aria's expression clouded slightly. "Some of the kids were nice. But..." She hesitated, finger tracing patterns on the comforter.
"But what, sweetheart?"
"Today when Blake uncle came to pick us up, some of the kids thought he was our daddy," she said, her voice small.
"At our old school in Italy, some kids used to make fun of me and Ethan because we don't have a daddy."
###chapter 121: His Protection
Angela POV
My heart constricted painfully. "Oh, Aria..."
"What exactly did those children at school say to you, sweetheart?" I asked gently, brushing a dark curl away from her forehead. Children could be unintentionally cruel with their observations, and I needed to know what my daughter was facing.
"You don't have to worry about what the kids said." Her small hand found mine in the darkness. "I'm not sad about it. When they say mean things, Ethan always protects me."
I swallowed the lump forming in my throat. "Darling, you don't need to worry about any of that. I'm here, and I'll never let anyone make fun of you or Ethan."
"I know," she mumbled, already drifting back toward sleep. "Ethan tells them we have the best mommy in the world instead of a daddy."
I waited until her breathing deepened before carefully extracting myself from her bed. In the hallway, I paused outside Ethan's room, peering through the crack in his door. Unlike his sister, he slept with military precision-straight as an arrow, barely disturbing the covers. So like his father.
In the quiet of the living room, I curled up on the sofa, memories washing over me like waves against the shore. The twins' situation at school had triggered recollections I'd kept locked away for years.

Flashback
I was twelve when I first truly understood what it meant to be different at the elite private academy I attended. As the daughter of John Wilson, I was initially welcomed with open arms. Designer clothes, chauffeured rides to school, invitations to exclusive birthday parties-I mistook it all for genuine friendship.
The illusion shattered one Tuesday afternoon in the girls' changing room. I'd forgotten my gym shirt and had doubled back to retrieve it when I heard my name.
"I'll tell you a little secret-Angela Wilson isn't as perfect as she seems." The voice belonged to Caroline Matthews, daughter of my father's business associate.
"What do you mean? Her family is like, super prestigious," another girl replied.
"Her mother was a scandal-ridden woman who dumped her for another man right after she was born. My mother says we shouldn't get too close to her."
"Seriously? I thought she had this perfect family."
"It's all for show! Her father hardly ever comes home now. He's always traveling around Europe."
"That's awful. We should probably keep our distance."
I stood frozen, the gym shirt clutched against my chest, tears blurring my vision. That day changed everything.
While the invitations continued-my family's wealth ensured that-I now recognized the hollow smiles and performative warmth for what they were.
I maintained the social appearances expected of a Wilson while quietly building walls around my heart, never again mistaking their politeness for genuine friendship.
By high school, I'd constructed impenetrable walls around myself.
Then came Jason Blackwell's sixteenth birthday party-an event I'd only been invited to because his mother and my father had business connections.
I stood alone on the balcony, watching other teenagers laugh and dance through the French doors, when I overheard a group of boys near the refreshment table.
"Fifty bucks says I can get Wilson to go out with me by the end of the month," said Marcus, the lacrosse team captain.
"You're on," replied his friend. "She's probably easy like her mom. Didn't she run off with some Italian count or something?"
Another boy leaned in, his voice dropping to a stage whisper that was clearly meant to be heard. "Hey guys, you think she's still a virgin?"
"No way," Marcus laughed, the sound cutting through me like a knife. "Girls from broken homes are always desperate for male attention. Her mom left, right? That messes girls up."
Their cruel laughter washed over me in waves of humiliation. I pressed myself deeper into the shadows, wishing I could disappear.
"What are you doing out here all alone?"
I turned to find Sean Shaw watching me, those piercing emerald eyes flickering with concern. We'd shared classes for years but rarely spoke, our social circles never intersecting despite our families' similar standing.
I quickly wiped away tears. "Nothing. Just getting some air."
His expression suddenly hardened as he glanced over my shoulder toward the boys. "I heard what those guys were saying about you."
I stared at the garden below, trying to mask my humiliation. "It's fine. I'm used to it."
Sean's jaw tightened. "No one has the right to talk about you like that. I'm going to deal with them."
"Don't," I grabbed his arm. "You'll just get in trouble."
His eyes met mine with unexpected intensity. "You're my friend, and friends stand up for each other. Starting today, no one talks about you like that while I'm around."
Before I could stop him, Sean marched straight to Marcus and his friends. Words were exchanged-I couldn't hear what was said-then suddenly Sean's fist connected with Marcus's jaw, sending him sprawling across the snack table.
"If any of you ever disrespect Angela Wilson again," Sean announced loud enough for everyone to hear, "you'll get worse than that."
Security escorted him out minutes later, but not before he caught my eye across the room, offering a slight nod that somehow felt like a promise.
***
The memory faded as I returned to the present, my fingers absently tracing the edge of the sofa in our new home.
How ironic that the man who had once been my protector was now the person I was protecting my children from.
I thought about Aria's words about children at school. Part of me wondered if I was being selfish, denying the twins their real father. But then I remembered the chaos that shadowed Sean's life, the dangerous rivalries, the complications with Christina, and his volatile temper.
Standing, I moved to the window.
"I'll give you both the security I never had," I whispered to the night, a promise to my sleeping children. "No matter what it takes."
###chapter 122: Her Scent
Sean POV
I stepped into my Park Avenue penthouse, my mood darker than the evening sky outside. The ride from the equestrian club had done nothing to calm the storm inside me.
The sight that greeted me only made it worse-Christina Jordan, perched on my sofa like she belonged there, chatting with Thomas, my new assistant.
Christina rose gracefully, her red hair catching the light as she offered me that practiced smile I'd grown to resent. "Sean, you're finally home. I've been waiting for nearly two hours."
"How did you get in here?" I asked coldly, my eyes shifting to Thomas, who immediately looked away, suddenly fascinated by whatever was on his tablet.
"Don't blame poor Thomas," Christina said, her voice silky. "I insisted he let me in."
"Insisted?"
Thomas cleared his throat nervously. "Ms. Jordan said if I didn't allow her upstairs, she would... create a scene in the lobby." He adjusted his tie, visibly uncomfortable. "I made a judgment call, sir."
I couldn't help the cold smile that formed on my lips. "Threatening to make a scene? When did you become so irrational, Christina?"
Something flickered across her perfect features-hurt, perhaps-before she composed herself again. "I needed to see you," she explained, smoothing her dress. "You haven't returned my calls in days."
Thomas gathered his belongings with hasty movements. "Ms. Jordan appears to have private matters to discuss with you, Mr. Shaw. I'll take my leave." He practically ran for the door.
"Coward," I muttered as it closed behind him.
Christina sighed with visible relief. "At least only Thomas witnessed my moment of desperation." She approached me, every step calculated. "Have you eaten? I could arrange for dinner to be delivered from Le Bernardin-"
"Christina." I cut her off sharply.
She stopped mid-step.
"I've told you before," I continued, feeling nothing as I spoke, "stop wasting your time on me."
Her eyes immediately filled with tears-perfectly timed, I noted cynically. I'd seen this performance before. "I care about you," she whispered. "Someday you'll see that no one understands you like I do."
"No," I replied without hesitation. "I won't." I ran a hand through my hair, suddenly exhausted by this familiar routine. "I made myself clear five years ago. I respect you as my life-saver, but that's all. No matter how long you wait, nothing will change. Do you understand?"
Her lower lip trembled as a tear traced down her cheek. "Five years ago, everything was different. Everything was perfect until she left. Why did Angela leaving change everything between us?"
I scowled at the mention of Angela's name. "It's getting late. You should go home."
"No," Christina responded, suddenly firm. "I won't leave like this."
"I'll have Thomas arrange a car for you."
"I don't want a car!" Before I could react, she closed the distance between us, throwing her arms around my waist and pressing her face against my chest.
I felt her stiffen against me. She pulled back slightly, her nostrils flaring as she inhaled. Her eyes widened with recognition, then narrowed with suspicion.
"What is that scent?" she asked, her voice dangerously soft.
I shoved her away harder than I intended, watching her stumble backward.
Christina steadied herself, her face pale with shock. "That perfume," she persisted. "Lily of the valley. It's not mine, and it's not the type of fragrance women wear to clubs or parties." Her eyes searched my face. "Who were you with today?"
I felt my expression change before I could control it. I lifted my collar to my nose, inhaling deeply. The faint, elegant scent was unmistakable-Angela's scent.
The same fragrance that had surrounded me in the riding club changing room, the same essence that had enveloped me as she sat before me on horseback. For a moment, I was back there, holding her again.
"Who is she?" Christina demanded, her carefully cultivated poise cracking. "Who left her scent on you?"
I dropped my hand, forcing my expression back to neutral. "My private life isn't something I need to explain to you, is it?"
The color drained from Christina's face. Her elegance fractured, revealing the raw emotion beneath.
Without another word, she snatched her purse and marched to the door, yanking it open. The heavy door slammed behind her, the sound echoing through my empty penthouse.
I didn't flinch. I merely exhaled slowly, relieved she had finally gone.
***
Hours later, I stood under the powerful spray of my shower, letting hot water cascade over my shoulders. Steam billowed around me as I braced my palms against the wall, head bowed, trying to wash away the day-and failing.
After toweling off, I moved through my bedroom, struck anew by the emptiness of my king-sized bed. My mind wandered back to the riding club-to Angela's body pressed against mine on horseback, to her skin beneath my fingers in the changing room.
She had changed in five years, grown somehow more beautiful, more assured. The remembered softness of her curves, more generous than I recalled, made my chest tighten with something like pain.
I stretched out on the vast, empty bed, her tears haunting me. Even in my anger, I had never wanted to make her cry. I stared at the ceiling, the hollowness beside me more pronounced than ever.
Five years of searching, only to find her when I least expected it. And now she was gone again, leaving nothing but her scent-a ghost of what once was mine.
###chapter 123: You Still See Me As Nothing But A Commodity?
Angela POV
The next morning, I found Christopher already in the kitchen, preparing breakfast for the children. He'd woken up early to make pancakes and set out fresh fruit.
"Good morning," he smiled, pouring me a cup of coffee. "I thought I'd give you a break. Mornings with kids can be hectic."
As we finished breakfast, Christopher offered, "Let me take the children to school today."
"That's not necessary," I replied quickly. "You must have your own affairs to attend to."
Christopher gently took my wrist, his eyes searching mine. "I know you can't fully accept me yet, but at least give me a chance, won't you?"
His words caught me off guard. I thought of what Aria had said yesterday about being teased at school for not having a father.
Perhaps letting Christopher play temporary dad wasn't such a bad idea. But a wave of guilt followed immediately-was I using him?
It didn't seem fair to Christopher to let him fill a role when my feelings remained so complicated.
"Fine, you can take them to school today," I finally agreed. "I happen to have an important meeting this morning anyway."
As I watched the three of them leave together, Ethan walking close to Christopher while Aria skipped ahead, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was crossing a line I'd promised myself I never would.
***
The gleaming doors of Lawrence Capital reflected my tense expression as I approached. I'd rescheduled my meeting with Tristan after yesterday's debacle, determined to secure the investment my fledgling company needed.
I knocked firmly on the office door, mentally rehearsing my pitch once more.
"Come in," called a deep, familiar voice from inside.
My hand froze on the doorknob. That voice-I'd recognize it anywhere. Sean.
I pushed the door open and felt my face drain of color. Sean Shaw sat behind Tristan's desk, his emerald eyes fixed on me with predatory intensity. My initial shock quickly transformed into burning frustration.
Without a word, I turned to leave.
"Not even staying to see who you came for? Leaving so soon?" Sean's voice stopped me in my tracks.
I paused, remembering why I'd come. My company's future depended on this meeting.
I turned back, my voice glacial. "Where is Tristan Lawrence?"
"Looking for him to discuss business? Seeking investment?" Sean's tone was dangerously light.
My expression must have betrayed me, because his eyes narrowed with satisfaction.
"He won't cross me," Sean stated flatly. "If you want investment, you should come to me."
"That won't be necessary," I replied, straightening my spine. "If Mr. Lawrence is afraid to offend you, I can find other investors."
Sean's expression darkened, his voice dropping to a frosty timbre. "Without my approval, who do you think will invest in that little company of yours?"
"Are you deliberately trying to sabotage me?" I demanded, frustration boiling over.
"Am I sabotaging you," he countered, "or are you desperately trying to erase any connection between us?"
I frowned. "We don't have any connection."
A mocking smile curved his lips. "Is that so? Two years together-kissing, embracing, sharing a bed-and somehow we have no connection at all?"
I felt heat rise to my face, both from anger and humiliation. My lips parted, then pressed together before I finally managed, "Sean, you're despicable."
His behavior was unconscionable. With Christina in his life, how dare he pursue me this way? Hadn't he caused enough damage five years ago?
Sean advanced toward me, backing me against the wall, his arm blocking my escape. "Despicable? You didn't call me that when you were in my bed."
Something snapped inside me. My palm connected with his cheek before I'd even registered the decision to strike.
Sean's head jerked sideways with the impact, shock evident in his expression. When he recovered, he captured my wrist, leaning down as if to kiss me.
Panic surged through me. I slapped him again with my free hand. "Sean, don't you dare! That's all in the past! We've been divorced for five years!"
Something in my words seemed to affect him. He froze, staring at me with an intensity that made me shiver, his breath coming fast.
I seized the opportunity to push him away, turning quickly toward the door.
"Angela," his voice followed me, hard with accusation, "you just walk away. Your heart is ice cold."
I nearly laughed aloud. Who was he to talk about cruelty? He had rejected our children, filed for divorce-and now he dared to call me heartless?
"Don't you care about anything?" he pressed. "Not even Elizabeth?"
The name stopped me mid-step. Elizabeth. My throat tightened with unexpected emotion.
"She misses you," Sean added quietly.
Those three words nearly crumbled my resolve. I'd thought of Elizabeth countless times over the years, had almost called her so many times. But I forced myself to harden my heart.
"So what?" I turned to face him, fighting to keep my voice steady despite my burning eyes. "From the moment our divorce was finalized, she ceased being my grandmother. She's your grandmother-you take care of her."
Sean stood motionless, seemingly stunned by my declaration.
After a moment, his lips twisted into a sardonic smile. "Is that so? Well, I'll be sure to relay your sentiments to her. Save her the trouble of thinking about you."
Pain lanced through my chest, as if something vital had been torn. I didn't mean it-Elizabeth had been more of a mother to me than my own had ever been. But I couldn't take the words back now.
I bit my lip, forcing out the final blow. "Do whatever you want."
As I turned to leave, Sean grabbed my arm. "If you walk out of this office now, I guarantee you won't get Lawrence's investment."
I met his gaze defiantly. "You think you can threaten me?"
"Why are you so stubborn?" His voice softened slightly. "Just come back to me, and you can have all the investment you need."
Anger flared hot and bright within me. "After all these years? You still see me as nothing but a commodity?"
I wrenched my arm free and walked out, closing the door firmly behind me.
In the car heading home, Sean's words echoed in my mind. She misses you.
I knew Elizabeth would think of me-our bond had been special. During my years in Italy, I'd often composed messages to her in my head, picked up the phone to dial her number. But the risk of Sean discovering the twins had always stopped me.
Did she hate me for leaving without saying goodbye? Was she well? Did she truly miss me, as Sean claimed?
My thoughts shifted to my failed meeting with Tristan. Without Lawrence Capital's backing, I'd need to find another investor quickly-a daunting prospect if Sean was determined to stand in my way.
Why couldn't he just let me go? Why, after five years, was he so intent on disrupting the life I'd carefully rebuilt?
###chapter 124: The Unexpected Investment
Angela POV
Christopher's car glided smoothly through the morning traffic.
I gazed out the window at the towering buildings, my mind consumed with worry about my company's investment problems.
After yesterday's disastrous meeting where Sean had interfered, I was back to square one.
Despite my repeated insistence that I could take a taxi, Christopher had insisted on dropping me off after taking the twins to school.
"You're especially quiet today," Christopher observed, his voice breaking through my thoughts. "Still thinking about yesterday?"
I shook my head slightly, returning to the present. "Just mentally preparing for the meeting. Lawrence Capital might be our best investment option."
His eyes studied me with that penetrating gaze that always seemed to see through my carefully constructed facades. "If you need investment, why not consider my firm? I could arrange it."
"Christopher, we've discussed this," I replied softly. "I need to establish my business independently."
He sighed, something unreadable flickering across his expression. "You know I came back from London for you, right? I'm tired of waiting, Angela."
I knew exactly what he meant. For the five years I'd spent in Italy after fleeing New York, Christopher had patiently waited, never abandoning his pursuit. Yet the wound Sean had left in my heart hadn't fully healed.
"I just need more time," I said quietly, turning back to watch the city blur past.
"Is it because you saw him yesterday at the riding club?" Christopher asked, his tone carefully neutral.
Before I could respond, my phone vibrated. Marcus's name flashed on the screen-a call at this hour had to be important. I answered immediately, only to be overwhelmed by his excited voice.
"Angela, you won't believe this!" Marcus was practically shouting. "Shaw Group just invested fifteen million dollars in our company!"
I felt my blood freeze, nearly dropping the phone. "What? Why would they-"
"The terms are minimal. They only want one board seat, and Sean Shaw himself will take it."
My heartbeat accelerated instantly. Sean Shaw, the man who had once dominated my life, was now inserting himself into my company, my new beginning.
Ending the call, I found Christopher watching me intently, clearly reading the shock in my expression.
"What happened?" he asked, his voice unnaturally calm.
"Sean invested in Wilson Advisory Partners." I told him directly, seeing no reason to hide it.
Christopher slammed on the brakes, pulling sharply to the curb. My body jerked forward before the seatbelt snapped me back.
"Christopher!" I gasped. "Be careful!"
He took several deep breaths, quickly regaining his composure. "I'm sorry, I overreacted." His eyes met mine with an intensity I'd rarely seen. "Does he know about the children?"
"No," I shook my head immediately. "I'm certain he doesn't."
"Are you going to see him?" Christopher asked, staring directly into my eyes.
I nodded. "I need to understand his intentions."
After a moment of tense silence, Christopher spoke again, visibly controlling his emotions. "I know I shouldn't interfere with you meeting him, but you understand Sean. He wouldn't invest in your company without a reason."
"I know," I assured him softly. "I'll be careful."
***
In the taxi heading toward the hotel, streets rushed past in a blur. My thoughts were in chaos. Sean Shaw-the name I'd worked so hard to avoid for five years-had forcefully re-entered my life.
My fingers drummed nervously against my knee, a habit from childhood. Yesterday's encounter at the riding club lingered in my mind; I couldn't deny Sean still affected me. More worrying was his complete ignorance about the children. If he discovered Aria and Ethan were his...I couldn't bear to imagine the consequences.
"Ma'am, we've arrived," the driver announced, pulling me back to reality.
I looked up at the hotel's imposing facade, taking a deep breath to steady myself. Whatever Sean Shaw had planned, I needed to remain calm-for myself and for my children.
Thomas had texted me the penthouse suite number. Standing before the door, I composed my expression and rang the bell.
No answer. I tried twice more, still receiving silence. Just as I turned to leave, the door swung open.
Sean Shaw stood before me, barefoot, shirt half-buttoned, hair disheveled-completely unlike his typically impeccable appearance.
"Why are you here?" he asked, his voice low and raspy. The commanding man from yesterday's riding club seemed to have vanished, replaced by someone I barely recognized.
"You invested in my company. As CEO, I naturally came to discuss the situation," I replied evenly.
He simply stared, making no move to invite me in. I noticed tiny beads of sweat on his forehead and an unnatural pallor to his skin. His hand gripping the doorframe trembled slightly-a stark contrast to the nearly invincible Sean Shaw I remembered.
"What exactly are you trying to do, Sean?" I asked, meeting his gaze while fighting to keep my voice steady. "We've been divorced for five years. Why suddenly interfere with my company?"
"I don't want to discuss this now," he answered tersely.
"Yesterday you threatened that without your approval, no one in New York would invest in my company. Today you directly invest fifteen million. What's your endgame?"
He frowned slightly, a flash of pain crossing his features as the perspiration on his forehead became more prominent. "I invested... what more do you... want from me?" His speech became increasingly fragmented, his breathing labored.
I instinctively stepped closer. "Sean, are you alright?"
"Not quite... well enough... for your interrogation, Ms. Wilson." Even in this state, he attempted to maintain his sardonic tone, but before he finished speaking, his body began to sway.
The air between us seemed to solidify. Where was the domineering Sean from yesterday's changing room? The man before me was clearly unwell, possibly seriously ill.
"We can talk another day," I said, turning to leave while suppressing the concern rising in my chest. "When you're feeling better."
Just then, I heard a dull thud behind me. Instinct made me turn quickly, only to see Sean collapsed in the doorway, his face ashen, forehead burning hot.
"Sean!" I cried out, rushing back to his side.
###chapter 125: The Password He Never Changed
Angela POV
"Mrs. Shaw?"
My head snapped up at the doctor's words, a correction poised on my lips before I swallowed it back.
"I'm Dr. Keller," the woman continued, extending a folder. "I have Mr. Shaw's preliminary diagnosis."
I accepted the medical report with steady hands despite my inner turmoil. An hour had passed since Sean had collapsed in the hotel doorway, since I'd called an ambulance while his unconscious form lay heavy against me.
"Mr. Shaw is suffering from severe gastric ulcers," Dr. Keller explained. "The fainting episode was triggered by a combination of acute symptoms, malnutrition, exhaustion, and psychological stress."
"Malnutrition?" I couldn't mask my surprise. The words seemed incongruous with the Sean Shaw I remembered-powerful, invincible, a man who commanded boardrooms and bent industries to his will. "That can't be right."
Dr. Keller's expression softened slightly. "I understand your disbelief, but the tests are quite clear. Mr. Shaw's condition indicates prolonged nutritional deficiency, coupled with excessive alcohol consumption-particularly whiskey, which is especially harsh on the gastric lining."
My mind flashed to Olivia's stories about Sean at The Rain, drinking alone night after night. The image seemed so at odds with the man I had known.
"What happens now?" I asked, refocusing on the present.
"We strongly recommend immediate hospitalization. Without proper treatment, Mr. Shaw risks serious complications, including gastric perforation."
"Of course. Whatever is necessary for his recovery."
"I must emphasize," Dr. Keller added, her tone growing grave, "that your partner must completely abstain from alcohol. Even a single drink could trigger severe consequences given the current state of his gastric lining."
Partner. Five years divorced, yet here I was, mistaken for his wife.
"I'll make sure he understands," I replied instead.
"Excellent. If you'd proceed to the front desk, they'll help you with the admission paperwork and fees."
"The deposit for our VIP suite comes to $30,000, with additional daily charges," the receptionist explained, her voice pleasant but firm. "How would you like to handle payment today?"
I opened my wallet, already knowing the futility of the gesture. My emergency cash wouldn't cover even a fraction of the amount, and my credit card was approaching its limit after the recent business expenses.
For a brief moment, I considered calling Christopher, but quickly dismissed the thought. Explaining Sean's condition to him would lead to questions I wasn't prepared to answer.
"One moment," I murmured, turning to where Sean's personal effects had been stored in a clear hospital bag.
I extracted his wallet-expensive Italian leather, the same style he'd always preferred. Opening it revealed a meticulously organized row of credit cards, placed in the exact order I remembered from our marriage. Nothing had changed in five years, not even this small habit.
My fingers hesitated over the black American Express Centurion card before decisively pulling it out. As I handed it to the receptionist, a new worry surfaced: the PIN code.
What would Sean use now? He'd always been methodical about security, changing passwords regularly-except for the one he'd used during our marriage. The one tied to our anniversary.
He must have changed it by now, I thought, watching the receptionist slide the card through the reader. Five years is more than enough time to erase such vestiges of a failed marriage.
When prompted, I hesitated before inputting the familiar four digits. My heart raced as I pressed the final number, half-expecting an error message.
Instead, the terminal beeped its acceptance.
"Perfect," the receptionist smiled, printing the receipt. "Everything's processed. Here are the admission forms."
I accepted the papers automatically, my thoughts spinning. He kept the same PIN code. For five years, he kept my birthday as his password.
For someone as meticulously careful as Sean Shaw, this wasn't mere oversight. What did it mean that he'd preserved this one connection to our shared past?
I entered Sean's hospital room just as a nurse finished checking his vital signs. She acknowledged me with a quick nod before exiting quietly.
Alone with him now, I approached the bed slowly. Sean lay unnaturally still, his normally commanding presence diminished by the hospital gown and IV lines. His face was ashen, lips cracked from dehydration, dark circles shadowing his closed eyes.
I sank into the visitor's chair beside him, studying this unfamiliar version of Sean Shaw. Never had I seen him so vulnerable, so human. The man who had once possessed my heart completely now looked almost fragile against the white hospital linens.
What had driven him to this state? The Sean I remembered had been disciplined to a fault, meticulous about his health, controlled in all things. This collapse spoke of a different man entirely-one who had abandoned self-care, who had pushed his body beyond its limits.
I recalled his irritability at the hotel room door, his unsteady stance, the sweat beading on his forehead. Signs I should have recognized immediately but had mistaken for anger or arrogance.
I sighed and pulled out my phone, dialing Marcus's number.
"Angela! Where are you? How did the meeting with Shaw go?" Marcus's eager voice filled my ear.
"I'm at New York-Presbyterian." I hesitated. "Sean collapsed during our meeting. I had to call an ambulance."
"What? Is he alright? Did something happen between you two?" The concern in Marcus's voice shifted quickly to business implications. "This won't affect the investment, will it?"
"Nothing happened," I assured him. "He was already ill when I arrived. Listen, Marcus, do you have contact information for his assistant, Thomas? I need to reach him immediately."
"Thomas? No, I don't have his direct line." Marcus paused. "I could try to get it through some connections at Shaw Group, but it might take time."
"That won't work," I replied, glancing at Sean's still form. "The situation is urgent. I'll check Sean's phone-I need to notify Thomas without involving the rest of the Shaw family directly."
After ending the call, I stared at Sean's iPhone on the side table. The simple black device represented a line I wasn't sure I should cross, despite my practical reasons for needing access.
I picked it up, the weight familiar in my palm. Five years ago, I had known his password-my birthday, an unexpected sentimentality from a man who rarely displayed emotion openly. But surely he would have changed it by now.
This is only to contact Thomas, I reminded myself. Nothing more.
My fingers moved automatically, muscle memory guiding them through the familiar pattern. Before pressing the final digit, I paused, looking up at Sean's unconscious form. With a deep breath, I completed the sequence.
The phone unlocked immediately.
I stared at the home screen, my heart pounding. Five years of separation, anger, and hurt-yet he still used my birthday as his password.
"Five years," I whispered, my voice barely audible in the quiet room. "Why would you still use my birthday after all this time?"
Sean gave no answer, his secrets locked away in unconsciousness while I sat alone with my questions.
###chapter 126: She Still Cares About Me!
Sean POV
"Mr. Shaw? You're awake?" Thomas's voice trembled with relief.
I forced my eyes open.
"Where am I?" My voice was weak. I hated it.
"Hospital VIP suite, sir. You've been unconscious for several hours."
I tried to sit up. My body fought against me. Thomas moved closer.
"Please, sir, you shouldn't exert yourself."
I waved him away. "What happened?"
The last thing I remembered was Angela coming to my hotel room to discuss her investment proposal. What happened after that?
Thomas swallowed. "You collapsed, sir. The doctors say it's your gastric ulcers again, but worse than last time. They're insisting on intravenous treatment and at least three days of observation. They've been clear that you must stop drinking and eat regularly or risk serious complications."
"Not happening. Get me discharge papers." Three days in a hospital bed? No chance.
"Sir, the doctors were extremely concerned about your condition. If you're not comfortable with this room, I can arrange a larger suite."
Thomas cleared his throat. "Sir, Ms. Wilson specifically instructed me to take good care of you."
My head snapped toward him. "What did you just say? Who was there?" My heart pounded as memories came back-Angela's scent, her voice, her hand on my forehead.
"Angela Wilson, sir," Thomas replied quietly.
"Is she still here?" I couldn't hide the need in my voice.
Thomas looked confused. "Still here? No, sir. She left after I arrived."
"It wasn't you who called the ambulance?"
"No, sir. Ms. Wilson contacted emergency services, then used your phone to call me. She... arranged everything."
That hit me hard. Angela hadn't run after I collapsed. She'd stayed, called for help, made sure I was taken care of. After five years of nothing, she'd stayed when she could have walked away.
Hope. Dangerous feeling.
"Where is she now?" I sat straighter, ignoring the pain. Maybe she was getting coffee. Maybe-
"Ms. Wilson departed shortly after I arrived, sir. She seemed tired."
The hope died fast. "She left? You didn't ask her to stay?"
"I don't have that authority, sir," Thomas said carefully. "She had already been here for several hours, handling your admission paperwork and expenses. She looked exhausted."
I could see it-Angela sitting by my bed, hair falling forward as she filled out forms, talked to doctors, waited for me to wake up. Then leaving the moment Thomas arrived, like she couldn't face me.
My fingers drummed against the sheets. Why stay at all? Why help me, then disappear before I woke up?
I had a plan. If Angela cared enough to keep me safe, she must still feel something for me. Something I could use.
"Remove these IVs," I ordered. "I'm leaving."
Thomas looked alarmed. "That's impossible, sir. You have two more bags of medication to complete. Ms. Wilson specifically instructed me to ensure you finished the full treatment."
Satisfaction warmed my chest. She'd given instructions for my care. She still cared.
"Is that so?" I let sarcasm fill my voice. "And you're following her orders now? Are you employed by Shaw Group or Wilson Advisory Partners?"
"This is solely for your health, sir," Thomas said weakly.
"I know my own health better than anyone," I shot back, enjoying how he squirmed. "Go handle the discharge paperwork."
When Thomas hesitated, I knew my plan was working. "Thomas Smith," I said coldly, "do you value your position at Shaw Group?"
Something changed in Thomas. He straightened up and looked me in the eye. "Mr. Shaw, if this is truly what you want, why didn't you demand it while Ms. Wilson was present? I couldn't help but notice that she's the only one who seems to genuinely influence your decisions."
I stared at him, speechless. Too accurate, too perceptive from this usually timid assistant.
Thomas's eyes lit up. "One moment, sir. I'll contact Ms. Wilson."
I turned away to hide my satisfaction. Perfect. She'd left clear instructions for my care, had spent hours making sure I was okay. Now I'd see if she meant it, or if it was just obligation.
I moved to the door as Thomas stepped into the hallway, positioning myself to hear his conversation. He called Marcus first, probably to get Angela's number. The wait felt endless.
Finally, her voice. Distant but unmistakable.
"Hello?"
"Ms. Wilson, I apologize for disturbing you, but it's urgent," Thomas explained. "Mr. Shaw has regained consciousness but is refusing treatment and demanding discharge."
"That's his choice," Angela replied coldly.
"The doctors say his ulcers are in a dangerous state. Leaving without completing treatment could be life-threatening."
I held my breath, waiting for her answer, that damned hope rising again despite myself.
"Thomas," she said finally, her voice tinged with irritation, "we've been divorced for five years. What makes you think he would listen to me? And why should I be the one to convince him?"
The words hit like punches. Five years. Divorced. Like what we had could be reduced to legal terms and time.
"You're the only one who can influence him," Thomas insisted. "The doctor explained that his condition is critical-the combination of gastric ulcers, alcohol, and irregular eating has created a dangerous situation."
"If Sean Shaw doesn't care about his own health, what can anyone else do?" Her voice hardened. "I'm sorry, but I can't come back."
I stepped away from the door, feeling empty. Five years of searching, and this was her answer. Five years of holding onto memories, passwords, connections-all meaningless to her.
I stared at the IV in my arm. If she didn't care whether I lived or died, what was the point?
I yanked the needle out. Blood ran down my arm, dripping onto the floor. The pain was almost welcome, taking my mind off the hollow in my chest.
I moved toward the door, determined to leave this place, leave the humiliation of showing weakness only to be rejected again.
The door opened as Thomas finished his call, his face changing from disappointment to horror when he saw the blood dripping from my arm.
"Mr. Shaw!" he shouted, rushing forward.
###chapter 127: I'm Giving You Three Days
Angela POV
After leaving the hospital, I hurried back to the Wilson Advisory Partners office.
As I pushed through the glass doors, I spotted Christopher waiting in the lobby. He straightened immediately when he saw me.
"Back already?" He stepped forward, taking my briefcase. "How was your meeting with Sean?"
He reached out to fix a strand of hair that the wind had blown out of place, his fingers lingering a moment too long. I pulled back slightly, feeling uneasy after the morning's events.
"It was fine," I replied. "Shouldn't you be at Blake Capital handling affairs?"
Christopher's eyes never left mine. "Didn't I say I'd wait for you? Who would take you home otherwise?"
We walked toward my office, our footsteps echoing in the quiet hallway. Most of the staff had already left for the day.
"The fifteen million from Shaw Group has been confirmed," I said, deliberately steering the conversation toward business. "Marcus is finalizing the paperwork as we speak."
Without warning, Christopher grasped my wrist, pulling me toward him. I found myself pressed against his chest, feeling his rapid heartbeat through his suit.
"Shaw's investment," Christopher's eyes suddenly sharpened, his voice taking on an edge I rarely heard. "You accepted it?"
I blinked, startled by his abrupt change in demeanor. "Yes, I did."
"You're really letting Sean Shaw invest in your company? Are you certain that's wise?"
I tried to step back, but his grip on my wrist remained firm. "Marcus already reached a preliminary agreement. I-"
"And what does that matter?" Christopher's voice dropped lower, a barely perceptible anger threading through his words. "Wilson Advisory Partners is your company. He's just the executive director."
"That may be true," I replied carefully, "but he's acting in the company's best interest. As senior management, I should respect his judgment."
Christopher's fingers tightened around mine, almost to the point of discomfort. "If you want to refuse, I'll cover the penalties for breaking the letter of intent. All of it."
"Christopher, that's unnecessary."
He released my hand abruptly, hurt flashing across his features. "Why? You can't bear to sever ties with Shaw?"
"It's not that," I insisted, fighting to keep my voice steady. "I'm making a professional decision. Marcus believes this partnership is best for the company. I shouldn't let personal matters cloud my business judgment."
Christopher stared at me intently, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Are you sure? Are you certain you won't be affected by personal matters?"
"I'm sure," I said, struggling to maintain my composure.
He suddenly stood, moving in front of me with a determination I'd never seen before. "Fine. Then promise me one thing."
"What?"
Christopher leaned down, close enough that I could feel his breath. "Agree to date me. Officially."
My heart pounded as he continued, his voice raw with emotion. "Five years, Angela. Five years! All I want is a chance to stay by your side. Every day I've watched you slip further away, unable to reach you."
He took my hands in his, his eyes burning with an intensity that made it difficult to look away. "Even if you don't love me yet, give me some hope. Let me see just a possibility. Please?"
"He hurt you before," Christopher continued, his voice dropping to a fervent whisper. "I witnessed every tear you shed for him. He doesn't deserve you. Don't look back."
His hands tightened around mine, almost pleading. "Promise me. Just this once."
I felt my resolve wavering under his earnest gaze. "I... I need to think about it."
Christopher's expression hardened. "For how long? I'm tired of waiting, Angela. It's been five years. My patience is exhausted."
"A week?" I suggested.
He shook his head firmly. "No."
"Six days, then?"
"Three days," he stated, his voice leaving no room for negotiation. "I'm giving you three days, Angela. After that, I need a definitive answer."
I swallowed hard, finding it impossible to refuse in the face of such determination. "Alright. Three days."
A sharp knock interrupted us. Marcus stood in the doorway, his expression tense.
***
After Christopher left, Marcus closed the door and turned to me, concern evident in his eyes.
"Are you alright, Ms. Wilson?"
I straightened papers on my desk, not meeting his gaze. "What are you doing?"
"Nothing, just making sure you're okay."
"I'm fine," I replied curtly. "Please maintain professional boundaries."
Marcus hesitated. "Are you planning to accept his pursuit?"
My head snapped up. "You were eavesdropping on our conversation?"
"Please don't misunderstand," he said quickly. "I was waiting outside. Your voices carried quite clearly. I overheard unintentionally."
He studied me for a moment before continuing. "Are you really planning to start a relationship with Mr. Blake instead of considering reconciliation with Mr. Shaw?"
"Reconciliation?" My voice turned cold. "Please don't make unfounded assumptions."
"But judging from Mr. Shaw's attitude, he seems interested in rebuilding your relationship."
"That's absurd speculation."
Marcus leaned against the wall, his posture casual but his eyes sharp. "Is it? Look at Mr. Blake's behavior-eager for your answer. Doesn't that suggest he feels threatened? But there's something else..."
"What?" I demanded when he trailed off.
"I find Mr. Blake's behavior... unusual."
"What's that supposed to mean?" My voice gained an edge.
"I apologize," Marcus said, straightening. "I merely observed from your conversation that his behavior pattern is concerning."
He took a step forward. "He claims to give you time to decide, appearing patient, yet he's pushing you, trying to leverage your guilt to force a decision. Think about it-isn't that what's happening?"
"Stop these conjectures," I said sharply.
I took a deep breath, trying to regain my composure. "Marcus, I hired you as the executive director to help manage the business, not to interfere with my personal affairs or judge my friends arbitrarily."
"Understood," he nodded. "I happened to overhear and wanted to caution you. If you don't want to hear it, I won't mention it again." He paused at the door. "But I still advise you to be wary of him."
After Marcus left, I sank into my chair, exhausted. The day's events had drained me, and Christopher's ultimatum now hung over me. Three days to decide whether to give him a chance-after five years of friendship and support.
My phone rang, Thomas's name flashing on the screen. I considered ignoring it, but professional courtesy won out.
"Thomas," I answered coldly, "please stop interrupting my work. Whether your Mr. Shaw accepts dinner invitations is-"
"Ms. Wilson," Thomas cut in, his voice urgent. "Mr. Shaw has collapsed. He's coughing up blood."
The world seemed to stop. I felt frozen as Thomas's words registered, and before I could think, I was already reaching for my coat.
###chapter 128: The Truth About Elizabeth
Angela POV
I hurried through the hospital corridors toward the high-end ward. Thomas's panicked call had cut through my professional resolve, leaving me with little choice but to come.
As I approached the nurses' station, I overheard a conversation that made me slow my steps.
"He's already coughing up blood. If Mr. Shaw continues to refuse treatment and the necessary rest, we cannot guarantee his safety." The doctor's voice was sharp with frustration.
"Dr. Keller, I'm truly sorry. When Mr. Shaw wakes up, I'll do my best to convince him," Thomas replied, his tone defeated.
"If he's intent on suicide, he shouldn't waste our time and resources at the hospital. We have too many patients who genuinely want to live and need our help."
I froze, my breath catching in my throat. Despite everything that had happened between us, the thought of Sean deliberately harming himself sent a chill down my spine. The doctor's harsh assessment suggested this was far more serious than I'd imagined.
After the doctor stormed off, I spotted Thomas leaning against the wall, hands shoved deep in his pockets, shoulders hunched in dejection. I hesitated before approaching him.
"Ms. Wilson." Thomas straightened when he saw me, looking exhausted behind his glasses.
He quickly turned away, taking a deep breath. I waited silently as he gathered himself. When he finally faced me again, his expression was professional, though strained with worry.
I gently placed my hand on his shoulder. "Where is he now?"
"He just came out of emergency treatment. He's in the ICU for observation."
"Take me to him," I said, my voice steadier than I felt.
"Yes, Ms. Wilson."
As we walked through the long, sterile corridors, Thomas repeatedly thanked me for coming.
"I'm truly grateful you came, Ms. Wilson. I didn't know what else to do."
"Did you only contact me? What about his family? Victoria or Alexander?" I asked, wondering why I was the one being called for this.
"Ms. Wilson, this has happened before. If Mr. Shaw would listen to his family, things wouldn't have progressed to this point."
"What about Christina Jordan? I thought he valued her opinion." The words felt bitter on my tongue.
"Honestly, he doesn't listen to anyone. I'm deeply concerned about him."
I swallowed hard, pushing aside personal feelings. "How severe is his stomach condition?"
"Very serious. The doctors say it's acute gastric ulcers with risk of perforation."
"Has he been refusing treatment all along?"
"Not entirely. Mr. Shaw occasionally takes medication, but he barely eats. It's as if he's completely lost interest in food, not that he's deliberately avoiding it."
"That sounds like some form of anorexia," I observed.
"The doctors haven't diagnosed it as such. Sometimes when he's in the mood, he'll eat a little, but it's rare."
"How long has this been going on?"
"About three years, I think? I'm not certain of the exact timeline. Mr. Shaw's condition seems to have deteriorated significantly after Elizabeth passed away."
I stopped abruptly, my heart skipping a beat. "What did you just say?"
"I was saying that when Elizabeth was still alive, Mr. Shaw's condition was much better. He drank, yes, but before visiting Elizabeth, he always strictly controlled himself-avoided alcohol completely so she wouldn't smell it and worry. But since Elizabeth passed away, there's been no one who could restrain him."
My world seemed to stop. Elizabeth-gone? The woman who had been more of a mother to me than my own, who had welcomed me into her family with open arms, who had taught me what unconditional love truly meant-was dead?
"Ms. Jordan has tried to persuade Mr. Shaw, but it's been completely ineffective. He even refuses to see her. But you're different, Ms. Wilson. Mr. Shaw will listen to you, which is why I took the liberty of..."
Thomas's voice faded as a rushing sound filled my ears. The corridor seemed to blur around me. I felt my knees weaken, and then darkness claimed me.
***
The first sensation was pain-a sharp ache in my chest that had nothing to do with the fall. Elizabeth is gone. The thought consumed me completely.
In the five years I'd been away, I had imagined countless changes that might have occurred in my absence. I'd pictured Sean marrying Christina, Christina having his child, even the Shaw Tower being renamed-but never once had I considered that Elizabeth might no longer be in this world.
My eyes flew open suddenly, and I gasped for air.
"You're awake," a familiar voice said.
I turned to find Sean sitting beside my bed, his face tired and drawn. For a moment, our eyes locked-emerald green meeting my gaze with an intensity that made my breath catch. He opened his mouth as if to speak, then closed it again, uncertainty written across his features.
I pushed myself up, ignoring the slight dizziness that accompanied the movement. "When?" I asked, my voice low but firm.
Sean's eyes widened slightly, recognizing immediately what I was asking.
"When did she die?" I clarified, my voice breaking despite my best efforts.
###chapter 129: I Promise I'll Come Tomorrow
Angela POV
"When?" I asked, my voice steadier than I expected. "When did she die?"
Sean swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing visibly before he spoke.
"Three years ago. Christmas Eve." His voice was barely audible. "It was kidney failure that triggered cardiac arrest. By the time we got her to the hospital, it was too late."
The words hit me like physical blows. Three years. While I had been building a new life in Italy, Elizabeth had passed away with her family by her side - but without me there to say goodbye.
"Elizabeth had kidney failure?" I asked, stunned. "How did I not know this?"
Sean's gaze dropped to his hands. "Her condition had been deteriorating gradually. Age-related, mostly. That night..." He paused, his voice catching. "That night was different. More severe. By the time we found her..."
I let out a bitter laugh, hollow and painful. "What right do I have to ask about any of this? I wasn't even there when she was ill. I didn't even know about her kidney problems."
"She mentioned you," Sean said quietly. "At the end."
My head snapped up, eyes locking with his. "Really?"
"She missed you very much."
Something broke inside me at those words-a dam I'd carefully constructed over five years, holding back emotions I couldn't afford to feel. Tears filled my eyes and spilled silently down my cheeks. I tried to turn away, to hide this moment of vulnerability, but Sean reached out, pulling me gently against his chest.
I should have resisted. I should have pulled away immediately. Instead, I found myself collapsing against him, my tears soaking into his shirt as silent sobs wracked my body. His arms encircled me, one hand stroking my hair with unexpected tenderness.
"It's okay," he murmured. "It's all over now."
We stayed like that, frozen in a moment that seemed to exist outside our complicated history, until the door opened and a nurse entered. She paused momentarily at the sight of us before proceeding to change Sean's IV bag.
Reality crashed back as I suddenly remembered why Sean was hospitalized-gastric bleeding, collapse, his own medical crisis. And here I was, crying in his arms like he was the healthy one.
I pulled away, wiping my face as I moved to the small cabinet in the corner of the room. Finding a clean hospital gown, I turned back to Sean.
"I'm sorry I got your shirt all wet," I said, holding out the garment. "You should change into something dry."
Sean shook his head. "Don't worry about it. It'll dry soon enough."
"You're already sick. Getting chilled will only make your stomach condition worse."
"My hands are a bit occupied at the moment," he replied, indicating the IV line inserted into his arm.
I glanced at the medical equipment, suddenly feeling foolish. Of course he couldn't easily change clothes with an IV in place.
I sat silently in the hospital room for a while, then glanced at my watch and realized it was almost time for the children to be dismissed from school.
"It's getting late," I said, setting the gown aside. "I should go."
I had barely turned toward the door when Sean's hand shot out, grabbing my wrist. His grip was firm, desperate even, as his eyes locked onto mine.
"You're leaving?" The vulnerability in his voice was startling.
I tried to pull my hand free, but his grip only tightened. "Sean, please let go."
"Will you come back tomorrow?" he asked, desperation bleeding into his tone.
"Yes, I promise I'll come tomorrow," I assured him. "The doctor says you need proper rest and care. I'll look after you during this period."
His grip relaxed slightly, but he didn't release me. "What would you like for breakfast? I'll have Thomas arrange it."
"Anything is fine. I'll eat whatever you bring."
"I'll bring breakfast," I offered, "but I won't be able to stay for lunch. I have other commitments."
"That's fine. Thomas can handle lunch arrangements."
I nodded, acutely aware that I couldn't tell him my "commitments" were our children-Aria and Ethan-who needed their mother.
Sean's eyes searched mine, a different question forming. "You... you're not living with Christopher, are you?"
"No," I answered simply.
Relief visibly washed over him, his lips curving into the slightest smile. "Good. You can go now."
Finally, he released my wrist. I rubbed it absently as I moved toward the door.
"Angela," he called just as my hand touched the handle.
I turned back, finding his eyes filled with uncertainty. "You'll really come tomorrow?"
"Of course," I said softly. "I keep my promises."
Outside in the corridor, Thomas straightened from where he'd been leaning against the wall, his expression guarded but apologetic.
"Ms. Wilson, I'm truly sorry for-"
"It's fine," I interrupted, keeping my tone businesslike. "You can arrange dinner for Mr. Shaw tonight. Make sure he eats properly."
"And if he refuses?"
I met Thomas's gaze directly. "Then tell him I won't be coming tomorrow."
Understanding dawned in Thomas's eyes. He nodded slowly. "I see. That should be... effective."
###chapter 130: I Don't Deserve You!
Angela POV
I left Sean's hospital room with practiced composure, only allowing myself to falter once I rounded the corner into an empty corridor, my hand reaching out to steady myself against the wall as the reality hit me: Elizabeth was gone, had been gone for three years while I built a new life in Italy.
After regaining my composure, I made my way toward the exit. Just as I stepped outside, a familiar figure caught my eye.
Christopher.
"You're here," I said, unable to hide my surprise.
"I came to find you," Christopher replied, his voice gentle yet determined. "You left the office so suddenly this afternoon. I was worried."
He reached for my hand, his fingers wrapping around my wrist in a gesture that felt both protective and possessive. The warmth of his touch contrasted sharply with the evening chill.
"You didn't need to come," I said, though the words lacked conviction.
Christopher studied me carefully. "Let me drive you home."
I nodded, too emotionally drained to argue.
The drive was wrapped in silence. Christopher occasionally glanced toward me, his concern evident, while I kept my thoughts to myself. When he finally spoke, his voice was soft.
"Thank you," I said, breaking the silence. "For coming to find me."
Christopher's hands tightened slightly on the steering wheel. "Always," he replied, the single word weighted with years of unspoken promises.
We pulled up outside my house. Despite my exhaustion, I remained seated, my seatbelt still fastened, fingers restlessly tracing the leather stitching of the seat.
Christopher leaned toward me, reaching across to release my seatbelt. His cologne enveloped me as the buckle clicked open.
"Come," he said gently. "You need rest."
As we approached the front door, I suddenly stopped.
"Wait," I said. "There's something I need to tell you."
Christopher turned to face me, his expression guarded. "Angela, whatever it is, can't it wait until tomorrow? You've had a difficult day."
"No," I insisted, my voice growing firmer. "I need to say this now."
The moonlight revealed the pain that flashed across his features before he could conceal it. A bitter smile curved his lips.
"Angela, please don't," he said, his voice dropping to a near-whisper.
"It seems you already know what I'm going to say," I replied, forcing myself to meet his gaze directly. "You said you'd give me three days to consider your proposition, but I've made my decision today. We're not right for each other, Christopher."
Christopher's lips pressed into a thin line, the smile vanishing as his expression darkened with undisguised hurt.
"Made your decision today?" he asked, his laugh hollow and brittle. "Or is this about Sean? Are you afraid I'll retaliate against him somehow?"
"No!" I protested quickly. "It's not that at all. The truth is, I don't deserve you, Christopher. You shouldn't waste any more of your life on me."
"You don't deserve me?" Christopher's eyebrows rose, his voice taking on an edge. "Shouldn't I be the judge of that, Angela? If I believe you're worthy, what other objections could you possibly have?"
I looked away, unable to maintain eye contact.
"Or," he continued, his voice growing sharper, "is your real concern Sean? If you didn't visit him in the hospital, would you-"
"Five years," I interrupted, looking up suddenly.
Christopher froze, shock evident in his widened eyes.
"It's been five years," I continued, my voice trembling slightly. "I know how good you've been to me, Christopher. It's not that I haven't tried to return your feelings. I have. But I can't. I've told you before not to be so kind to me because I can't give you what you want."
"And I told you I can't stop," Christopher replied, his voice intense. "I can't stop being good to you. I can't stop watching over you. And I certainly can't bear to see you and Sean together again."
The space between us closed as Christopher moved closer. His arm encircled my waist, drawing me against him. I placed my hand against his chest, feeling his rapid heartbeat beneath my palm as I tried to maintain some distance.
"You know it's been five years," he said, his voice rough with emotion. "Five years of me being there for you. If you just say yes, I'll give you everything you could ever want or need. Just name it, and it's yours."
I felt my brow furrow with distress, my breathing growing uneven.
"You don't understand!" I exclaimed, frustration breaking through my composure.
"Then help me understand," Christopher urged, searching my face. "Tell me what I'm missing."
"Your kindness makes me feel guilty because I can't reciprocate," I confessed, my voice cracking. "To be blunt, I don't love you, Christopher. Being with you would only hurt you more. Can't you see that?"
For a moment, he said nothing. Then, with quiet determination: "Angela, I don't care."
The statement left me stunned, my eyes widening in disbelief.
"You can love whoever you want," he continued, desperation edging into his voice. "I just want you by my side. We can be together physically, and I'll be a father to Aria and Ethan. I'll give them the best life possible."
I stared at him, unable to comprehend what he was suggesting. "That's impossible," I whispered.
"Why?" he challenged, his eyes burning with intensity. "I get what I want, you live your life. What's wrong with that arrangement?"
Emotion surged through me, and I pushed against his chest, creating distance between us despite the trembling in my hands.
"It's absurd! Completely impossible," I insisted, my voice rising.
"Angela," Christopher's control fractured, raw emotion breaking through. "You've always rejected me without giving us a real chance. How can you know it won't work if you never try? You didn't even take the full three days to consider-is that fair to me after everything?"
His words struck me like a physical blow. Fair. The concept pierced through my defenses, forcing me to confront the truth of his accusation. Had I ever given Christopher a fair chance?
I closed my eyes, wrestling with the weight of my own actions.
"Three days wasn't enough time?" Christopher asked, his voice softening. "Then take a week. Would that be better?"
The fight drained out of me, leaving only exhaustion and regret. My shoulders sagged with the burden of knowing I was hurting someone who had never been anything but good to me.
Christopher was everything I should want-stable, successful, devoted to me and kind to my children. Yet that essential spark remained absent.
"I'm sorry," I said softly, the inadequacy of the words painfully apparent.
Christopher stood motionless, studying my face. I saw the moment something broke in his expression, before he carefully reconstructed it into one of gentle understanding.
"You must be exhausted after today," he said, his voice carefully controlled. "Go get some rest. We can discuss this another time."
"Christopher, I-" I began, but he gently cut me off.
"Go inside, Angela," he said softly. "The children need you."
As I turned toward the door, I felt the weight of his gaze on my back. The kindness in his final words only deepened my guilt, reminding me that even in rejection, Christopher Blake would never be anything less than the gentleman he had always been.
###chapter 131: The Purpose Behind Her Care
Sean POV
I woke early, sitting upright in my hospital bed despite the dull ache in my stomach. Thomas kept giving me concerned glances from the corner of the room, but I refused to lie back down.
"Mr. Shaw, it's barely seven," Thomas said, adjusting his glasses nervously. "Ms. Wilson won't be here this early. You barely slept last night. Perhaps you should rest a bit longer? I could wait by the door and alert you when she arrives."
"You're too loud," I muttered, keeping my eyes fixed on the door.
As minutes stretched into hours, I felt my mood darkening. What if she didn't come? Thomas finally offered to check the hospital entrance, but just as he reached for the door, Angela appeared, carrying a thermal container.
The rich aroma of cream and mushrooms filled the room as she removed the lid, revealing a perfectly prepared cream of mushroom soup.
"You made this yourself?" I asked, taking the bowl she offered.
Angela raised an eyebrow. "Who else would have?"
While I ate, Angela conversed quietly with Thomas about my condition. "The doctor recommends a strict diet regimen even after discharge," Thomas explained. "No alcohol whatsoever, and regular meals are essential."
Angela nodded, her expression professional and detached.
After I finished eating, I watched in dismay as she immediately began gathering her things.
"You're leaving already?" I couldn't mask my disappointment.
"I have work," she replied coolly. "Rest well and make sure you eat lunch." She turned to Thomas with a warning: "If he refuses to eat, let me know. I won't come this evening if he doesn't."
At noon, I watched Thomas read a message on his phone and smile.
"Ms. Wilson asked if you'd eaten lunch," he informed me. "I told her you had."
"What did she say?" I asked, trying to sound casual.
Thomas showed me the screen: a simple "OK." 
I stared at the brief response, feeling my shoulders slump. After a moment's hesitation, I dictated my own message to Thomas: "I ate lunch. When will you come this afternoon?"
The reply came swiftly: "After work."
Darkness had fallen by the time Angela arrived with dinner. My frustration was immediate.
"Why did it take you so long to get here?"
"Does travel not take time?" she countered evenly. "Does preparing food not take time?"
"You don't need to cook," I insisted. "Just coming by would be enough."
Angela's expression remained impassive. "You think I want to?" she replied, offering no further explanation before urging me to eat before the food cooled.
After I finished, she left with only a brief promise: "I'll come tomorrow."
For the next several days, the pattern continued. Angela arrived punctually each morning and evening with carefully prepared meals-French onion soup, bisque, consommé-that progressed from liquid to semi-solid as my condition improved.
I found myself increasingly bewildered by her behavior.
She was meticulously consistent in her care-the food always arrived at the same times, prepared with evident skill-yet she seemed to avoid any real conversation or eye contact.
Even the young nurse who checked my vitals twice daily offered warmer smiles and friendlier chatter than Angela ever did. The contradiction gnawed at me. Why would she dedicate so much effort to visiting me every day, only to treat our interactions with such cold efficiency?
It was as though she was merely fulfilling an obligation, checking items off a list rather than visiting someone she once shared a life with.
On the fourth morning, I accepted the breakfast-a hearty vegetable soup-but didn't immediately begin eating.
"Why do you keep bringing me food?" I asked directly.
Angela didn't answer.
"Why do you care about my recovery?" I tried again.
"Eat first," she replied calmly.
When I'd finished, I repeated my question. This time, Angela answered.
"It's a transaction."
I stared at her, uncomprehending.
"I want to visit Elizabeth's grave," she explained, her voice steady. "I need to lay flowers for her. By bringing you meals and helping with your recovery, I earn the right to have you take me there. That's our deal."
Her words washed over me like ice water. The thermal containers, the carefully prepared meals, the consistent visits-none of it had been about concern for me. All this time, I'd been nothing more than a means to an end.
The realization cut deeper than I could have anticipated. My chest tightened with a pain that had nothing to do with my ulcers. I'd allowed myself to believe, even briefly, that her presence meant she still cared.
"Is that what you think of me?" I asked, my voice barely audible, the hurt raw and evident. "Did you really believe I would refuse if you simply asked to visit her grave?"
I searched her face, looking for any sign that there was more to this-that her care had been genuine even if her motives were not. But her expression remained guarded.
"How could I be certain you wouldn't?"
That hurt the most-that after everything we'd been through, she still thought me capable of such pettiness. That she believed I would deny her the chance to honor Elizabeth's memory out of spite or bitterness.
By noon, I had made my decision. "Handle my discharge paperwork," I instructed Thomas. "I'll take her this afternoon."
###chapter 132: I Used To Place The Pill On My Tongue And Kiss You
Angela Pov
I arrived at Sean's hotel a few minutes early, settling into one of the plush chairs in the lobby's waiting area. My phone showed 2:57 PM-three minutes before our agreed time. I hadn't bothered with luggage; this was a day trip at most. I'd be back in New York by tomorrow afternoon.
The twins were with Olivia. Despite our recent tension over Sean, she'd agreed immediately when I called asking for help.
"Of course I'll watch them," she'd said, her voice softening when I mentioned visiting Elizabeth's grave. "Take whatever time you need."
Two minutes passed. Then five. At 3:08, I texted Thomas: "Are you coming down soon?"
Three minutes later, my phone lit up with his response: "Ms. Wilson, we might need a little more time."
My mind immediately jumped to the worst scenarios. Was Sean having another episode? Had his condition worsened? Setting my jaw, I stood and headed for the elevators.
When I reached the door of Sean's suite, I pressed the bell and waited. The silence stretched before Thomas finally opened the door, his surprised expression telling me everything I needed to know.
"Ms. Wilson! Why did you come up?" he stammered, blocking the entrance.
I fixed him with a look that brooked no argument. Thomas's eyes darted nervously as he insisted nothing was wrong, but years of dealing with Sean's staff had taught me to recognize evasion. Without waiting for further explanation, I stepped past him into the suite.
"Ms. Wilson, please wait!" Thomas called after me, his footsteps hurrying behind me as I strode toward the master bedroom.
Worry tightened my chest. Had Sean collapsed again? Was he coughing up blood? I quickened my pace, reaching for the bedroom door.
As I pushed it open, my breath caught. Sean stood by the bed, shirtless, his fingers working at the buttons of a fresh dress shirt. The lean muscles of his torso-that familiar expanse of tanned skin-momentarily stopped me in my tracks.
He looked up, green eyes narrowing when they met mine.
I quickly averted my gaze, heat rising to my cheeks despite my best efforts. "You're... you're okay?"
A sardonic smile curved his lips. "What, didn't get enough of a view at the riding club? Need a closer look?"
"Don't flatter yourself," I snapped, though my face betrayed me with unwanted warmth. "You were late. I thought something might have happened."
Sean continued buttoning his shirt with deliberate slowness. "We're going to Elizabeth's grave, aren't we? Are you planning to stand there watching me dress, or shall we get going?"
"If you're not feeling well enough to travel, we can postpone," I offered, noting the slight pallor beneath his tan. "I can wait a day or two."
"That won't be necessary," he replied flatly.
Downstairs, Thomas led us to a waiting black Bentley.
"Ms. Wilson, Mr. Shaw has arranged for his private jet to take you to Vermont," Thomas explained as the driver loaded Sean's overnight bag into the trunk.
I stopped short. "Private jet? I thought we'd be taking a commercial flight."
"There are no direct flights to Elizabeth's hometown," Sean said coldly. "Unless you plan to waste an entire day on layovers."
"Whatever you say," I replied, sliding into the car's plush leather backseat. This new development concerned me. A private jet meant hours alone with Sean in a confined space-precisely the situation I'd hoped to avoid.
***
At Teterboro Airport, my phone rang. Christopher's name flashed on the screen.
"You're going to Vermont?" His voice was strained with barely contained tension.
"Yes," I confirmed. "To Elizabeth's hometown. I'll be back tomorrow."
"With him?" The emphasis on the last word was unmistakable.
"Yes."
A pause. "Angela, may I ask why?"
"I have something important to take care of there."
Christopher's voice softened slightly. "Alright. Be careful. I'll pick you up when you return."
"That's not necessary," I said quickly. "I'll just go straight to the office when I get back."
"Why do you always refuse my help?" The hurt in his voice was palpable. "Won't you even give me a chance anymore?"
"It's not that, I just-"
"I'll pick you up," he interrupted with uncharacteristic firmness. "Let me know when you land."
The call ended abruptly-the first time Christopher had ever hung up on me. I stared at my phone, momentarily stunned by this departure from his usually impeccable manners.
I glanced up to find Sean watching me, his expression darkening. His jaw tightened visibly before he turned away, striding toward the waiting aircraft.
The interior of Sean's Gulfstream G650 took my breath away despite myself. Gleaming mahogany, buttery leather, and polished chrome created an atmosphere of understated luxury. Sean quickly gave Thomas a few instructions before settling into a seat by the window, pointedly looking away from me.
"You seem torn," he commented as I took a seat across from him. "Is Blake upset you didn't invite him along?"
I bit back my initial response. "Elizabeth was important to me too. This has nothing to do with Christopher."
Sean's laugh was short and bitter. "Of course. That's why you need me to take you to her grave, not him."
I felt my face flush but remained silent. Any response would only give him ammunition.
Twenty minutes into the flight, Thomas approached Sean with a small pill case. "Mr. Shaw, it's time for your medication."
"I know," Sean replied tersely.
"The doctor emphasized you must take it every six hours without fail," Thomas persisted.
"I said I know!" Sean snapped, his mood clearly deteriorating.
I watched as Thomas retreated, his shoulders slumped in defeat. A few minutes later, he quietly approached my seat.
"Ms. Wilson," he whispered, "could you please help? Mr. Shaw keeps refusing his medication, and his condition will only worsen."
"Why me?" I questioned. "He won't listen to me."
Thomas looked at me earnestly. "You're the only one who can influence him. Since you left... he hasn't listened to anyone."
With a reluctant sigh, I stood and moved to Sean's side.
"Can't you just take your medication as prescribed?" I demanded. "Or do you need to be coughing up blood again to be satisfied?"
Sean raised an eyebrow. "Concerned about my wellbeing?"
"Don't be ridiculous," I retorted. "I simply don't want you collapsing mid-flight and delaying my plans."
His eyes locked with mine, the familiar green depths stirring unwanted memories. "You never liked taking medication either, remember? Do you recall how I used to convince you?"
I glared at him in warning. "Sean Shaw, don't you dare."
A slow smile spread across his face. "Don't remember? I used to place the pill on my tongue and kiss you. Maybe I should remind you... or perhaps you'd like to return the favor?"
###chapter 133: Your Dress Is Wet
Angela POV
I was acutely aware of Thomas discreetly retreating to the front of the cabin. My cheeks burned with indignation and something else I refused to acknowledge.
Before I could respond, Sean's hand shot out, catching my wrist. In one fluid motion, he placed a small white pill on my tongue and pulled me toward him. His lips covered mine, his tongue sweeping into my mouth to reclaim the pill.
"Mmph-you're insane!" I struggled against him, but his grip remained firm.
"Shh," he murmured against my lips. "This way none of the medicine is wasted."
I felt the exact moment he recovered the pill, his tongue skillfully retrieving it before he pulled away and swallowed. The entire episode lasted seconds, but it left me breathless and furious.
Sean smirked, satisfaction evident in his expression.
I turned away sharply, returning to my seat without another word.
My lips still tingled from Sean's unexpected kiss-that familiar sensation I'd spent five years trying to forget.
Settling into the plush leather seat, I pretended to close my eyes for rest, though sleep was the furthest thing from my mind.
Through my lashes, I could see Sean watching me, satisfaction evident in the slight curve of his lips. Even now, after everything, he could read me too well. He knew exactly how that kiss had affected me, how my body had instinctively responded to his touch despite my mind's protests.
I touched my lips unconsciously, then caught myself and quickly dropped my hand. The taste of him lingered-a ghost from my past that refused to be exorcised. I focused on my breathing, trying to calm the rapid beating of my heart while cursing my own weakness.
Five years should have been enough to forget. Five years of building a new life, of raising our children alone, of carefully constructing walls around my heart. Yet one impulsive moment on his private jet, and those walls were already developing cracks.
"You should get some rest," Sean's voice broke through my thoughts. "It's still a few hours to Vermont."
I kept my eyes closed, refusing to acknowledge him. If he thought that little performance had changed anything between us, he was sorely mistaken.
The plane suddenly lurched, a violent movement that made my eyes snap open. The seatbelt sign illuminated with an urgent ping as the aircraft began to shake.
 Only then did I realize I hadn't fastened my seatbelt after returning to my seat.
"Ladies and gentlemen," the pilot's voice came through the speaker, strain evident in his professional tone, "we're experiencing some unexpected turbulence. Please return to your seats and ensure your seatbelts are securely fastened."
Before I could reach for the belt, another violent shake sent the plane dropping. I gasped, my hands gripping the armrests as I felt myself lifting from the seat. In that moment of weightlessness and panic, Sean's arm shot out, pulling me against him with surprising strength.
"Hold on," he commanded, his voice low and steady in my ear as he secured me firmly against his side.
The plane continued to shake violently, my body pressed tightly against Sean's. I could feel the rapid rise and fall of his chest, the tension in his muscles as he held me. Despite everything, he still made me feel safe.
"Is this normal?" I asked, unable to keep the tremor from my voice.
"It's just air turbulence," Sean replied, his breath warm against my temple. "Nothing the plane can't handle. Trust me."
I suddenly remembered that Sean had obtained his pilot's license years ago-one of his many hobbies that he'd pursued with characteristic intensity. He understood aircraft better than most passengers.
The violent shaking continued, and I found myself instinctively pressing closer to him, seeking the security his body offered. His arm tightened around me protectively, and I could feel his heart racing beneath my palm.
"I've got you," he murmured, and despite everything between us, I believed him.
When the turbulence finally subsided, the pilot's voice returned, apologizing for the unexpected rough air. As the seatbelt sign dimmed, I immediately pulled away from Sean's embrace, flustered by our proximity.
It was only then that I noticed the disaster. During the turbulence, a glass of water that had been resting on my tray table had completely overturned, soaking the front of my silk dress. The pale blue fabric now clung to my skin, revealing far more than I'd ever intended in Sean's presence.
I looked up to find his eyes fixed on me, or more specifically, on the now-transparent fabric adhering to my curves. His gaze was dark and heated, traveling slowly across my body with undisguised appreciation.
"Stop staring," I snapped, crossing my arms over my chest.
His eyes finally lifted to meet mine, a dangerous intensity in their emerald depths. "Your dress is wet," he stated, voice rougher than before.
"I'm aware," I replied icily. "I need to change."
I grabbed my handbag and stood, painfully conscious of how the wet silk outlined my body as I moved toward the lavatory. Sean's eyes tracked me the entire way, his gaze almost tangible on my skin.
Once inside the small bathroom, I locked the door and leaned against it, exhaling shakily. The woman in the mirror looked flushed, with bright eyes and parted lips-betraying a response I couldn't control. I splashed cold water on my face, trying to calm the heat in my cheeks and the thundering of my pulse.
This was ridiculous. I'd been divorced from Sean for five years. I'd built a successful life without him. I was a mother, a businesswoman, a complete person in my own right. So why did his touch still affect me this way?
I peeled off the wet dress, grateful I'd packed a spare blouse in my handbag. Just as I was buttoning up the fresh top, I heard the door handle turn. Thinking it might be the flight attendant checking on me, I turned-only to find Sean filling the doorway, his tall frame blocking any escape.
"What are you doing?" I gasped, instinctively pulling the edges of my partially buttoned blouse together.
###chapter 134: You’re Wet Down Here Too
Angela POV
I stared at Sean, my heart thudding against my ribcage as he stood there, his broad shoulders filling the narrow doorway of the private jet's lavatory.
The air felt thick, suffocating in the confined space, and the faint hum of the plane's engines underscored the tension between us.
He tilted his head slightly, his green eyes flickering over me with that infuriating mix of amusement and intensity.
"You've been in here forever. I thought something might be wrong."
"I'm fine," I snapped, gesturing toward the door behind him. "Now get out."
Instead of leaving, Sean stepped fully inside, pulling the lavatory door shut with a soft click that echoed like a gunshot in my ears.
My stomach lurched with a sudden, uneasy premonition. The space was already small, but with him in it, it felt impossibly tighter-his presence overwhelming, inescapable.
"Sean," I said, my tone low and warning, "if you dare-"
He cut me off, his lips curving into a smirk as he tugged at the collar of his shirt. "You got my shirt wet too, you know. Fair's fair-I need to change."
I blinked, momentarily thrown by his casual deflection.
"Fine," I said, forcing my voice to stay steady despite the heat creeping up my neck. "I'll finish changing and get out. Then you can have the damn room to yourself."
I turned away from him, focusing on the buttons of my blouse.
 My fingers trembled slightly as I worked them up, one by one, all the way to the topmost button at my throat. The crisp fabric felt like armor, a thin shield against the chaos of emotions swirling inside me.
I just needed to get out of here, away from him, before I lost control of the situation entirely.
But as I moved to slip past him toward the door, his hand shot out, catching my arm. In one swift motion, he pulled me back, my body stumbling slightly against his. The warmth of his chest pressed against my shoulder, and I froze, my breath catching in my throat.
"Sean, let go," I hissed, trying to wrench my arm free.
Instead, he turned me to face him, his hands sliding to my waist as he drew me closer.
His eyes locked onto mine, dark and unreadable, and before I could protest further, he leaned in, his lips hovering just above mine.
"Stop it!" I snapped, shoving at his chest. "You're disgusting."
He chuckled softly, the sound low and dangerous.
"Keep your voice down, Angela. Thomas is right outside."
I opened my mouth to retort, but the words died as his hand slipped lower. My pulse raced, a mix of fury and something I refused to name surging through me.
Then, with a boldness that stole my breath, his fingers dipped beneath the fabric, sliding into my panties.
"Sean-" I started, but he cut me off again, his voice dropping to a rough whisper.
"You're wet down here too," he murmured, his fingers grazing my skin with deliberate slowness.
My body betrayed me, a shiver running down my spine as heat pooled where his touch lingered.
I hated him for it-hated myself more for the way my breath hitched, for the way my thighs clenched involuntarily.
His fingers moved with a maddening confidence, tracing the slickness between my legs, parting me gently as if he still knew every inch of me by heart. The sensation was electric, overwhelming, and I bit my lip hard to keep from making a sound.
"Get your hands off me," I managed, my voice shaking with rage and something else I couldn't suppress.
But he didn't stop.
His other arm tightened around my waist, pulling me flush against him as his fingers pressed deeper, curling inside me with a precision that made my knees weak. I could feel the hard length of him against my hip, straining through his trousers, and the realization sent a fresh wave of heat through me despite my protests.
His thumb found my clit, circling it with slow, torturous strokes, and I gasped, my hands gripping his shoulders-not to push him away, but to steady myself as my body trembled.
"Sean, stop," I whispered, but it sounded weak, unconvincing even to my own ears.
He leaned closer, his lips brushing my ear. "You don't mean that," he said, his voice thick with certainty. "I can feel how much you want this."
The tiny lavatory seemed to shrink further, the walls closing in as our ragged breathing filled the space.
His mouth found my neck, teeth grazing the sensitive skin there, and I stifled a moan, my nails digging into his arms.
It was wrong-so wrong.
Five years apart, five years of rebuilding myself, and here I was, unraveling under his hands in the cramped bathroom of his private jet.
My mind screamed at me to fight, to resist, but my body was locked in a battle it was losing fast. His fingers pumped faster now, slick with my arousal, and I felt the pressure building, coiling tight in my core.
"Sean, please-" I choked out, not even sure what I was begging for anymore.
He pulled back just enough to look at me, his eyes blazing with a hunger that mirrored the storm inside me. Then his lips crashed against mine, hard and demanding, swallowing my protests as his hand worked me toward the edge.
My hips bucked against him, chasing the release I didn't want to admit I craved, and when it hit, it was shattering-wave after wave of pleasure that left me gasping against his mouth, my legs trembling beneath me.
And then reality slammed back into me like a freight train.
I shoved him off me with all the strength I could muster, my hand flying up to crack across his face.
The slap echoed in the tiny space, sharp and final, and Sean's head snapped to the side, a red mark blooming on his cheek.
"I'm here to mourn Elizabeth," I spat, my voice raw with fury and shame. "Not to fuck you in a goddamn bathroom! If you had even an ounce of respect for her-or for me-you wouldn't have forced this!"
He touched his cheek, his expression unreadable for a moment before it hardened. "Forced?" he said, his tone low and edged with something dangerous. "You didn't exactly fight me off, Angela."
"Get out," I snarled, pointing at the door. "Now."
For a long moment, he didn't move, his eyes searching mine as if looking for something I refused to give.
Then, with a curt nod, he turned and opened the door, stepping out into the cabin without another word. The latch clicked shut behind him, and I sank against the wall, my legs giving out as I slid to the floor.
My hands shook as I pressed them to my face, the taste of him still on my lips, the feel of him still lingering on my skin. I hated him. I hated myself more.
This wasn't supposed to happen-not here, not now, not ever again. I was here for Elizabeth, to honor her memory, not to fall back into the tangled mess of Sean's orbit.
###chapter 135: Wash Me Off Her Skin
Sean POV
I stepped out of the lavatory, the faint hum of the jet's engines buzzing in my ears like a swarm of angry bees.
My shirt clung to my chest, damp and wrinkled from where Angela had pressed herself against me-whether she'd meant to or not.
I ran a hand through my hair, trying to shake off the heat still coursing through me, the memory of her trembling under my touch, the way her breath had hitched despite all her protests.
My cheek stung where she'd slapped me, a sharp reminder of how fast things had spiraled out of control.
As I moved back into the cabin, Thomas glanced up from his seat near the window. His eyes widened for a split second, taking in my disheveled state-shirt untucked, collar askew, hair a mess.
I saw the flicker of surprise in his expression, but then it was gone, replaced by that cool, collected mask he always wore.
A smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth, subtle but unmistakable, like he'd pieced together exactly what had gone down in that tiny bathroom. He leaned back in his seat, folding his arms, and I could practically hear the gears turning in his head.
"You alright, Sean?" he asked, his tone casual but laced with something teasing. He stood and stepped closer, eyeing the wet patches on my shirt. "Looks like you got caught in a storm in there. Want me to grab you a fresh shirt? That one's soaked."
I shot him a glare, my jaw tightening. "No," I snapped, sharper than I meant to. "I'm fine."
Thomas raised his hands in mock surrender, that damn smirk still playing on his lips.
"Alright, alright. Just trying to help."
He backed off, retreating to his seat with a knowing look that made my blood simmer. He didn't say anything else-didn't need to. The way he chuckled under his breath told me he'd already figured out more than I wanted him to.
I turned away, dropping into my own seat and staring out at the dark sky beyond the window, trying to shove down the tangle of frustration and need still clawing at me.
A few minutes later, the lavatory door clicked open again. Angela emerged, her blouse buttoned up tight to her throat, her hair smoothed back into place like nothing had happened.
She looked composed, cold even, but I knew better. I'd felt her unraveling just moments ago-her body had given her away, no matter how much she wanted to deny it.
She didn't look at me as she crossed the cabin, her steps clipped and deliberate, like she could erase me from the room just by refusing to acknowledge I was there.
I leaned forward, resting my elbows on my knees.
"Half an hour till we land," I said, keeping my voice steady, testing the waters.
She didn't respond. Didn't even glance my way. Just sat down across the aisle, her back ramrod straight, staring ahead like I was invisible. The silence stretched, heavy and suffocating, and it pissed me off more than I wanted to admit.
She'd reacted to me in there, I thought, my mind replaying every second of it. When I'd kissed her, she'd kissed me back-at least for a moment, before the walls went up again.
Her body had trembled, her hips had pressed into my hand, chasing what I was giving her. She could lie to herself all she wanted, but I'd felt it.
So why the hell was she so damn stubborn?
Why did she keep pushing me away when I could still taste her on my lips, still feel the heat of her against me?
I hadn't meant to force her. That wasn't what I'd wanted-not really.
But standing there in that cramped space, her scent filling my head, her defiance sparking something primal in me, I'd lost it.
I couldn't stop myself.
It wasn't just now, either-it'd been building for weeks, ever since she came back to New York. Every time I saw her, that need clawed at me, raw and relentless.
And at the airport, hearing her on the phone with Christopher, laughing like that, so easy and light in a way she never was with me anymore-it'd lit a fuse I couldn't put out.
I'd wanted to claim her, to make her mine again, to erase him from her voice, her smile, her life.
I shifted in my seat, the ache in my chest tightening. I didn't regret it-not entirely. But the way she'd looked at me after, the fury in her eyes as she'd slapped me, that cut deeper than I wanted to admit.
By the time the plane touched down in Grandma Elizabeth's sleepy little hometown, the sky was pitch black.
The cemetery was long closed, its gates locked tight until morning. Angela and I would have to wait to visit the grave, so Thomas had arranged for us to crash at a hotel nearby.
My muscles ached as I stepped off the jet, the cold night air biting at my skin through my still-damp shirt. I wanted a shower, a drink, and about twelve hours of sleep-but I knew none of that would come easy with Angela around.
Thomas led the way to the hotel, a small, quaint place with creaky floors and dim lighting. He checked us in, handing over two keycards-one for me, one for Angela.
"Your rooms are next to each other," he said, tossing her a quick glance. "Figured it'd be easier that way."
Angela's head snapped up, her eyes narrowing. "No," she said, her voice flat but firm. "I'll take your room, Thomas. You can switch with me."
"What?" I said, stepping forward, irritation flaring hot in my chest. "That's ridiculous. The rooms are fine-"
"I don't care," she cut me off, snatching the keycard from Thomas's hand without even looking at me. "I'm not staying next to you."
"Angela-"
I started, but she was already moving, brushing past me like I was nothing. I stood there, rooted to the spot in the middle of the lobby, watching her go. Thomas shifted beside me, clearing his throat awkwardly.
"She's just tired," he offered, but I didn't buy it. Tired didn't explain the ice in her voice, the way she couldn't even stand the thought of a wall between us.
"Yeah, sure," I muttered, grabbing my own keycard and turning toward my room.
My hands curled into fists as I climbed the stairs, the weight of her rejection sinking in.
She could run all she wanted-swap rooms, ignore me, pretend I didn't exist-but it wouldn't change what had happened. It wouldn't change the way her body had arched into mine, the way she'd gasped my name before she'd remembered to hate me.
I pushed open the door to my room, the faint scent of old wood and lavender hitting me as I stepped inside. The bed was neatly made, the curtains drawn tight against the night, but I didn't care about any of it.
I dropped my bag by the door and sank onto the edge of the mattress, my head in my hands.
I should've let her go five years ago. Should've let her stay gone.
But seeing her again, being near her-it was like a drug I couldn't kick.
Every look, every word, every damn fight just pulled me deeper.
And now, here we were, stuck in this nowhere town, her one room away-or two, thanks to her little stunt with Thomas-and me still burning for her like some idiot who didn't know better.
I glanced at the wall separating my room from Thomas's, knowing she was on the other side of it now, probably unpacking her things, washing me off her skin.
The thought made my stomach twist. She could scrub all she wanted, but she couldn't wash away what I'd felt-what we'd both felt.
###chapter 136: Farewells and Secrets
Angela POV
I stood under the shower's scalding spray, letting the water cascade over my body as steam filled the small hotel bathroom.
My cheeks burned as unwanted memories flooded back-Sean's hands on my body, his lips against my neck, and worst of all, my own body's betrayal. I squeezed an excessive amount of shower gel onto my loofa, scrubbing my skin with enough force to leave it pink and raw.
"Damn you, Sean Shaw," I muttered, pressing my forehead against the cool tile. "What gives you the right to force yourself on me like that?"
I reminded myself why I was really here-for Elizabeth, to pay respects to the woman who had been more of a mother to me than my own. Not to rekindle anything with Sean.
Yet my treacherous skin still remembered his touch, prompting me to scrub even harder, as if I could wash away the memory itself.
The morning air bit at my cheeks as I stepped out of my hotel room. I'd dressed carefully in a warm cashmere sweater and coat, mentally preparing myself for the emotional day ahead.
My steps faltered when I spotted Sean leaning against the wall near the exit, with Thomas Smith hovering nervously beside him. Thomas immediately straightened when he saw me, his professional smile firmly in place.
"Good morning, Ms. Wilson," he greeted politely.
I forced myself to remain calm, pushing away memories of the airplane lavatory. "You're both here early," I observed, keeping my voice neutral.
"We wanted to ensure the schedule runs smoothly," Thomas explained. "Ms. Wilson, the temperature in town is quite low today. Perhaps you might need an additional layer?"
I couldn't help but notice that Sean was wearing only a thin shirt and light cashmere sweater. Despite my determination not to care about his wellbeing after yesterday's incident, professional habit made me frown with concern.
"Mr. Smith," I said, pointedly not looking at Sean, "rather than worrying about me, perhaps remind your employer that he's dressed more lightly than I am, despite his medical condition."
Sean's lips curled into a slight smile. "I'm not cold."
"But you're still recovering," I countered before I could stop myself.
"Would a sick man accompany you to a cemetery?" Sean replied, his voice low and amused. "Let's go. We shouldn't waste time-don't we need to buy flowers first?"
I swallowed my concern, reminding myself that I would no longer fuss over Sean as I once had. "Let's get moving then," I agreed with a simple nod.
The drive through the small town was quiet, oppressively so. After stopping at the town's only florist, where I carefully selected a bouquet of white lilies-Elizabeth's favorites-we continued toward the cemetery in silence.
I kept my gaze fixed on the unfamiliar scenery passing outside the window, though I could feel Sean's eyes occasionally landing on my profile. I deliberately avoided meeting his gaze, focusing instead on the memories of Elizabeth that flooded my mind.
The weight of guilt pressed heavier on my chest with each passing minute. Three years. Elizabeth had been gone for three years, and I hadn't even known.
No one spoke as the car wound through the narrow roads. I bit my lower lip, determined not to show vulnerability in front of Sean. In the rearview mirror, I noticed Thomas occasionally glancing back at us both but wisely maintaining the silence.
***
The cemetery grounds were still damp from the previous day's rain, the air carrying that distinctive scent of moisture and fresh vegetation. Few visitors roamed the peaceful grounds, giving the small-town cemetery an air of tranquil solitude.
I followed Sean down a shaded path, my heart racing faster with each step. After walking for several minutes, Sean suddenly stopped.
There it was-Elizabeth's headstone. My breath caught in my throat when I saw the colorful photograph embedded in the marble. Young Elizabeth smiled elegantly from the image, her aristocratic bearing undeniable even in her youth.
The memory came unbidden to my mind: Elizabeth's voice, warm and teasing, as she'd once told us, "Sean, Angela, when I leave this world, please put a photo of my younger self on my grave. My husband left too early, and I want him to recognize me in heaven."
"Could I..." my voice wavered slightly. "Could I have some private time with Elizabeth? Please?"
Sean frowned momentarily before nodding. With a subtle gesture to Thomas, he turned and walked away, leaving me alone with my grief.
I stood motionless before the grave, my vision blurring as tears gathered. Carefully, I knelt to arrange the flowers and offerings beside the elegant marble headstone, my hands trembling slightly.
"Elizabeth, it's Angela," I whispered. "I've come back."
Despite all the words I'd rehearsed on the plane, I found myself speechless. I busied my hands with arranging the flowers, gently wiping raindrops from the photograph's surface.
When I finally regained some composure, I continued softly, "I'm sorry I left without telling you the truth five years ago. And I'm sorry I never came back to see you. You must have been so disappointed. You have every right to be angry-I can't even forgive myself. If you can hear me, please visit me in my dreams. There's so much I need to tell you..."
With shaking hands, I pulled out my phone, scrolling to find a specific photograph. "Elizabeth, there's something I never told you... something I never told Sean either." My voice dropped to an almost inaudible whisper. "These are Aria and Ethan. They're... they're your great-grandchildren. Sean's children."
I held up the phone, displaying the twins' smiling faces.
"I should have told you," I choked out as tears finally spilled down my cheeks. "They would have loved you so much, but I'm sorry... they'll never get that chance now."
###chapter 137: At Elizabeth's Grave
Sean POV
I stood among the weathered headstones, watching Angela from a distance. She knelt before Elizabeth's grave, her slender frame bent in grief, whispering words I couldn't hear. The gray sky hung heavy above us, mirroring the weight pressing against my chest.
Thomas shifted uncomfortably beside me. "Should we wait in the car, Mr. Shaw?"
"No," I replied, my eyes never leaving Angela. "I'll stay."
I hadn't seen such raw pain on Angela's face since the day I'd found her at her father's hospital bedside years ago. Even from this distance, I could see her shoulders shaking slightly with silent sobs.
Elizabeth had meant everything to her-more mother than grandmother-in-law-and I wondered if bringing her here had been a mistake. The finality of the grave might break something inside her that couldn't be repaired.
Three years ago, as we'd lowered Elizabeth's casket into the frozen December ground, I had hated Angela. Hated how she could be so cruel, not even coming to see Elizabeth before she died-Elizabeth, who had given her so much. But now, watching her grief-stricken face as she knelt before the grave, I couldn't bring myself to condemn her anymore.
A rumble of thunder rolled across the cemetery, echoing between the marble monuments.
"Mr. Shaw," Thomas's voice cut through my thoughts, "it looks like it's going to rain heavily. Should we alert Ms. Wilson?"
I glanced at the darkening sky, feeling the pressure dropping rapidly. "Go find some umbrellas."
Thomas nodded and hurried toward the cemetery office near the entrance. Minutes later, he returned with two large black umbrellas.
"Give them to me," I said, taking both from his hands.
I approached Angela slowly, careful not to startle her. She sat on the ground now, oblivious to the mud staining her expensive Burberry coat. Her fingers traced Elizabeth's name carved into the stone, her lips moving in silent conversation.
"It's going to rain," I announced, my voice sounding harsher than intended.
No response.
"Angela." I tried again.
She remained frozen, lost in her grief. The first drops of rain began to fall, pattering softly on the surrounding graves. I stepped closer, opening one umbrella and holding it over her. The rain intensified quickly, drumming against the taut fabric above us.
Finally, I crouched down and gently grasped her waist, pulling her to her feet. "You need to come back now."
Thomas rushed over to help, taking the second umbrella from my hand.
"What's the point of this?" I asked, gesturing toward the grave. "Elizabeth is gone. No amount of crying will bring her back."
Angela's head snapped up, her red-rimmed eyes suddenly blazing with anger. "This is all because of you. It's your fault."
I stared at her, confused. "What?"
"If it weren't for you," she spat, "I never would have left Elizabeth. I wouldn't have missed saying goodbye to her."
"What are you talking about?" I demanded, bewildered. "You were the one who wanted the divorce."
Angela's laugh was bitter, almost hysterical. "I wanted the divorce? Is that what you think?"
She pushed away from me, stepping back into the rain. I moved forward immediately, shielding her again and gripping her waist to prevent her retreat.
"You'll get soaked," I warned.
"That's none of your concern," she replied coldly.
I caught her wrist. "Of course it's my concern. Why don't we just clear the air right here, in front of Elizabeth?"
Something flickered in Angela's eyes-recognition, perhaps, that a cemetery wasn't the place for such a confrontation. Her shoulders sagged slightly, the fight draining from her.
"I have nothing to say to you," she murmured. "Let's just go."
But I couldn't let her words go unchallenged. "What did you mean? That you wouldn't have left Elizabeth if it weren't for me? What exactly are you saying?"
Her eyes met mine, cold and distant. "Exactly what it sounds like. Can't you understand plain English?" She yanked her hand free of my grip.
In that moment, Angela's face went ashen. Her eyes rolled back, and she crumpled before I could process what was happening.
"Ms. Wilson!" Thomas cried out in alarm.
I caught her before she hit the ground, her body alarmingly light in my arms. Her skin had turned a sickly pale, and panic gripped me as I felt for her pulse.
"Is she alright?" Thomas hovered anxiously, umbrella forgotten.
"Give me that," I ordered, nodding at the umbrella he still held. I shifted Angela in my arms, cradling her against my chest as I stood.
Thomas immediately abandoned his own umbrella to hold one over us, rain soaking him instantly as he hurried alongside me toward the car. My own back was getting drenched, the rain seeping through my suit jacket, but I barely noticed. All I could focus on was Angela's shallow breathing against my neck.
Once inside the car, I carefully laid Angela across the back seat, her head resting on my lap. Thomas handed me a dry towel from the car's storage compartment, and I gently dabbed at the raindrops on her face and hair.
"Drive to the hospital," I instructed the driver.
Thomas, dripping wet himself, offered me another towel. "Mr. Shaw, your suit is soaked through. You should dry off."
I took the towel but continued tending to Angela, meticulously ensuring she was completely dry before finally running the cloth over my own damp hair and shoulders.
Halfway to the hospital, I felt Angela stir. Her eyelids fluttered open, disorientation evident in her gaze as she took in her surroundings. She noticed the blasting heat in the car, then Thomas's wet clothes as he sneezed. Finally, her eyes found mine, tucked into the corner of the seat, watching her silently. I saw her gaze linger on my soaked jacket.
"Mr. Shaw," Thomas said, unaware Angela was awake, "your suit is completely wet. Aren't you cold?"
Before I could answer, the driver announced, "We're almost at the hospital, Mr. Shaw."
"Ms. Wilson!" Thomas exclaimed, finally noticing she was conscious. "You're awake?"
"Yes," she replied softly. "We don't need to go to the hospital. Let's return to the hotel."
Thomas looked to me questioningly. "Mr. Shaw?"
The driver pulled to the side of the road, waiting for new instructions. I continued watching Angela, searching her face. Something had shifted between us-something I couldn't quite define. After a long moment, I nodded.
"Back to the hotel," I said quietly.
###chapter 138: Secret Escape
Sean POV
The rain dripped from my hair as I stared out the window of the town car, watching the dreary landscape scroll past in a blur of grays and muted greens. Angela sat across from me, wrapped in my jacket, her skin still too pale after her collapse at the cemetery.
I couldn't understand her anger back there, her accusation ringing in my ears: "If it weren't for you, I never would have left Elizabeth." What the hell did that even mean?
Five years ago, she was the one who told me she loved Christopher Blake. I still remember that moment with painful clarity-standing in our living room, her eyes avoiding mine as she said those words that shattered everything: "I love him. I love Christopher."
Yes, technically I was the one who suggested we go to court to finalize the divorce, but what choice did she leave me? She'd already decided to replace me.
And now she had the audacity to act like I was the villain in our story? Like I was the reason she missed saying goodbye to Elizabeth? What right did she have to place that guilt on me?
The car pulled up to the hotel, and Thomas rushed forward with an umbrella, helping Angela inside while I followed, my clothes still soaked through despite the towel I'd used earlier.
Once back in my hotel suite, I peeled off my wet clothes and stepped into a scalding shower, trying to wash away both the physical chill and the confusion clouding my mind.
After changing into dry clothes, I picked up my phone, staring at Angela's contact.
Despite my irritation, I found myself tapping out a message: Lunch in thirty minutes?
Her response came quickly: No, I need to rest. Thank you.
I tossed the phone onto the bed, frustration building beneath my ribs. Thomas knocked tentatively at the door, then entered when I called out.
"Ms. Wilson declined the lunch invitation?" he asked carefully, quickly pocketing his phone when he saw my expression.
"She says she needs to rest," I replied, not bothering to hide my annoyance.
Thomas nodded sympathetically. "She's had a difficult morning, sir. The emotional strain of visiting Mrs. Shaw's grave, plus her fainting spell... Perhaps she genuinely needs the rest?"
I said nothing, just walked into the bedroom and closed the door behind me. If she wanted space, fine. I'd give her space.
Around noon, Thomas arranged for food to be delivered. While I was still on a restricted diet, I'd graduated from bland soups to more substantial fare. I picked at the grilled chicken and steamed vegetables, my appetite dampened not by my physical condition but by my thoughts of Angela.
"She's been resting for how long now?" I asked, breaking the silence.
Thomas checked his watch. "About two hours, sir."
"Order lunch for her too," I instructed, ignoring the twist of hunger in my stomach that had nothing to do with food.
Thomas hesitated. "But Ms. Wilson said-"
"Is there something wrong with eating before resting?" I cut him off sharply.
"Of course not. I'll arrange it immediately," he replied, reaching for his phone.
I returned to the window, watching raindrops race down the glass. Rest. That's all she seemed to want-rest from her company, rest from her responsibilities, rest from me.
Twenty minutes later, I heard voices in the hallway. Stepping out of my thoughts, I moved to the door, listening.
"I've rung several times, but there's no answer," a hotel staff member was saying.
Something cold slithered through my chest. I yanked open my door and stepped into the hallway.
"Is there a problem?" I asked, eyeing the food cart parked outside Angela's room.
"Sir, we've brought the meal you ordered, but it seems your friend isn't answering," the server explained.
Thomas immediately stepped forward. "I'll call her," he offered, already dialing. The phone rang on speaker, and my muscles tensed with each tone.
"Hello?" Angela's voice came through clearly-too clearly for someone who'd just woken up.
"Ms. Wilson, have you rested well?" Thomas asked carefully. "If you're awake, could you please open the door? Mr. Shaw has arranged lunch to be delivered to your room."
"That won't be necessary, Thomas. Thank you for your concern, but I've already left the hotel."
The words hit me like a physical blow. Left? After we'd just visited Elizabeth's grave together?
"What? Ms. Wilson, you-" Thomas stammered, looking as surprised as I felt.
"I'm on my way back to New York. Please let Sean know."
I snatched the phone from Thomas's hand. "What did you just say?"
"You heard me correctly. How convenient that you're already on the line, so Thomas doesn't need to relay the message." Her voice was infuriatingly composed.
"Angela, what is this supposed to mean?" I fought to keep my anger in check.
"Nothing in particular. This was just a transaction between us, remember? I told you at the hospital-I only came to see Elizabeth. Now that I've fulfilled our agreement, I need to get back to New York. I have work waiting for me."
"Weren't you supposedly unwell and needing rest?" I gritted out, my fingers tightening around the phone.
"Yes, I rested for twenty minutes. Is that a problem?" Her casual dismissal made my blood boil.
"Wait for me there," I commanded.
"I'm afraid that's not possible, Mr. Shaw. I've already purchased my ticket and will be departing shortly. Even if you came now, you wouldn't make it in time."
"Angela, do you think returning to New York puts you beyond my reach?" The threat slipped out before I could stop it.
"What exactly are you implying, Mr. Shaw? I'm simply returning to work. Is there something wrong with that?" Her feigned innocence was like gasoline on a fire.
"Fine. Go back to New York. Just wait for me there." My voice had gone cold, detached.
"Of course. I'll eagerly await your grand arrival," she replied, sarcasm dripping from every word.
The call ended, and I stood frozen, a wave of betrayal washing over me. We had just stood together at Elizabeth's grave. She had collapsed in my arms, her vulnerability so raw and real. And now she was fleeing like a thief in the night.
I handed the phone back to Thomas, my expression dark enough that he took a step back.
"Ms. Wilson has already left town?" he asked cautiously.
"Gone back to New York," I replied curtly, my mind already mapping out my next moves.
Thomas turned to the server. "You can take the food back. The guest has departed."
As they left, I remained in the doorway, staring at the empty hallway. What was she running from?
###chapter 139: They Actually Look More Like...You
Sean POV
I slammed my office door behind me, the glass walls vibrating with the force.
Our trip had been a complete disaster-Angela fleeing after our visit to Elizabeth's grave, leaving me with nothing but questions and a renewed sense of betrayal.
Thomas entered cautiously, informing me about the division reports while I massaged my stomach, the ulcers acting up again.
When he left, I turned toward the city view from my window, needing something substantial to quiet my mind.
Slumping into my chair, I pulled out my phone, opening Instagram almost without conscious thought. My thumb hovered over the search icon before tapping it, entering the now-familiar handle: @TwinsAdventure.
To my surprise, there was a new video posted just two hours ago. An unexpected brightness cut through my dark mood as I tapped the thumbnail.
The video quality was poor, shot with a shaky hand in what appeared to be an indoor playground. But the sound of children's laughter-those familiar voices-immediately soothed something in me that I hadn't realized needed soothing.
Aria's face filled the screen, her dark curls bouncing as she jumped excitedly. She had the same radiant smile that I'd watched in dozens of videos before, the same energy that inexplicably drew me to her channel in the first place.
"Olivia aunt, Aria wants to eat takoyaki!" she exclaimed, her voice carrying that slight, endearing accent I'd come to anticipate.
"Takoyaki? Of course we can," a woman's voice answered from behind the camera.
The camera panned shakily to Ethan, who was more reserved as always, methodically climbing a rope ladder at the edge of the frame.
"Ethan, come with us," the woman called again. The camera briefly turned, capturing the woman's face as she waved at the boy.
I tapped the screen, pausing the video. Something didn't feel right. I rewound slightly, listening to the children's exchange with the woman again.
Olivia aunt.
The realization hit me like a physical blow. Olivia. I knew that name. Olivia Jordan-Angela's friend. The same woman who had approached me at The Rain, who had tried to arrange a meeting with Angela.
My mind raced as I connected dots I hadn't seen before. Why would Angela's friend be with these children? The coincidence was too great to ignore.
I quickly opened WhatsApp, an app I rarely used anymore. There, buried beneath months of unread messages, were multiple notifications from "Olivia J."
Mr. Shaw, I had such a wonderful time meeting you... 
Mr. Shaw, would you like to have dinner sometime? 
Mr. Shaw, I'll be at The Rain again this Friday...
Dozens of messages, all unread, all attempting to pursue me romantically. And now this same woman was filming with the twins I'd been following for months.
I switched back to Instagram, scrolling through Olivia's profile. There they were-multiple photos of her with the twins. In a park, at a restaurant, in what appeared to be an apartment.
Why would Angela's closest friend be spending time with these children I'd been drawn to? The coincidence seemed increasingly impossible with each passing second.
I called Olivia right away.
The line rang three times before she answered, her voice breathless with excitement.
"Mr. Shaw, hello?"
"Hello,"
"Is there something I can help you with?" The eagerness in her voice was unmistakable.
"I'd like to ask you about something, if you have a moment."
"Of course, Mr. Shaw! What would you like to know?"
I chose my words carefully. "I happened to see your Instagram. There were some photos that caught my attention."
"Photos?" Her voice rose slightly, uncertain.
"Yes. Posted last night. I noticed two children in them."
"Oh, you mean Aria and Ethan!" Relief colored her tone. "I do watch their videos. Are you a fan too? What a coincidence!"
"Something like that," I replied, measuring each word. "Are they your children?"
Her laugh tinkled through the phone. "Goodness, no! If I had children, would I have been trying to get your attention at The Rain? They're my friend's kids."
My grip tightened on the phone. "Wilson? The friend you mentioned before?"
"Yes, exactly! They're her children."
The admission hit me with the force of a physical blow, and I fell silent, the implications washing over me in waves.
"Mr. Shaw? Are you there?" Olivia's voice seemed distant through the roaring in my ears.
"Hmm. Your friend Wilson is quite fortunate," I finally managed, my voice unnaturally calm.
"I think so too! The twins are so adorable and well-behaved."
"Thank you for the information, Olivia. I need to handle some business now."
"Of course, I understand. You must be very busy."
I ended the call. Angela had children. Two children whose faces had drawn me in from the first moment I'd seen them. Two children whose ages would put their birth...
"Mr. Shaw?" Thomas stood in the doorway, concern etched across his features.
"Come here," I instructed.
He approached cautiously. "What's wrong?"
Without a word, I held up my phone, displaying a photo of the twins with Olivia.
"Those are the children you often watch videos of," he remarked, then frowned. "Who's the woman with them?"
"Angela's friend."
His eyebrows shot up. "Friend? Angela Wil- Ms. Wilson? Wait, you're not suggesting these children belong to Ms. Wilson's friend, are you? That would be quite a coincidence."
"A coincidence indeed." I leaned forward, watching his expression carefully. "What if I told you these children belong to Angela Wilson herself? Would that seem more or less coincidental to you?"
Thomas's jaw dropped. "Ms. Wilson has children? This big already? Then... then you have no chance with her anymore, do you?"
"No chance?" I echoed, something dangerous entering my voice. "How would you know whether I have a chance or not?"
"Mr. Shaw, if her children are this age, it means they have a father," Thomas blurted, gesturing wildly. "That means you definitely have no chance! If you pursue her now, you might even become the third party in someone else's marriage. Is that what you want your reputation to become?"
"Do you remember what you said before?" I asked quietly.
"What did I say? Mr. Shaw, could you please be more specific?"
"Take another look at the photo," I instructed.
Thomas sighed. "Mr. Shaw, I've already examined this photo thoroughly. What else is there to see? They're just Ms. Wilson's children."
"Look at their features. Their eyes."
"Well, they are quite attractive children. They look similar, but with distinct qualities. The girl has her own charm, and the boy has a different presence. It's just-"
"Just what?" I prodded.
He squinted at the screen, then his eyes widened. "They don't really look like Ms. Wilson. They actually look more like..."
"Go on," I prompted, though I already knew what he'd say.
"Like you, Mr. Shaw. They really do resemble you. I mentioned before that these children reminded me of someone, but I didn't think much of it. But now... Mr. Shaw, if these children are connected to you somehow, doesn't that mean that five years ago, Ms. Wilson was already-"
"I want everything on these children, Thomas" I said without turning around. "Birthdays, residence, schools, regular activities-every detail you can find."
###chapter 140: My children. Mine. 
Sean POV
The black Bentley idled at the corner of the street, strategically positioned to observe the school's entrance while remaining inconspicuous. I sat in the back seat, eyes fixed on the elegant brownstone building where Angela was dropping off the twins.
She knelt to straighten Ethan's uniform collar, her movements gentle and practiced. The morning sunlight caught in her hair as she leaned forward to accept Aria's enthusiastic goodbye kiss.
"Bye, Mama!" Aria called, waving energetically.
"Remember to wait for me right here after school," Angela reminded them, her voice carrying that tender firmness I'd once known so well. "Go on now."
As they disappeared through the large wooden doors, Angela stood for a moment, watching them go. Something in her posture-the slight tension in her shoulders, the way she suddenly glanced around-told me she sensed something. Her eyes swept the street, lingering momentarily in our direction before she turned and walked away.
I lowered the window slightly, watching her retreating figure until she disappeared around the corner.
"Ms. Wilson seems remarkably perceptive," Thomas observed from beside me. "We're just sitting here, yet she appeared to sense something. Fortunately, she didn't spot us, but... Mr. Shaw, why don't you want her to know you're here?"
I shot him a cold glance. "If she knew, do you think I'd ever get to see those children?"
Thomas nodded slowly. "Indeed. If those children truly are yours... the fact that Ms. Wilson never told you of their existence clearly indicates she doesn't want you to know. If she discovers you're aware, she might immediately disappear with them. The risk is considerable."
***
"Excuse me, sir, may I ask who you are?" The security guard's tone was polite but firm as he blocked our path to the school entrance.
Thomas stepped forward smoothly. "I'm Thomas Smith, executive assistant to Shaw Group. This is Mr. Sean Shaw, who's here to make a generous donation to your institution."
The mention of my name and "donation" worked their usual magic. Within minutes, we were being escorted to the principal's office, where a middle-aged woman in a tailored suit greeted me with barely contained excitement.
"Mr. Shaw, what an honor to have you visit our school!" The principal beamed, extending her hand. "Your donation is incredibly generous. We cannot thank you enough."
I maintained my neutral expression, shaking her hand briefly. "Principal, now that the donation has been arranged, I'd be interested in seeing the educational environment you provide. Would it be possible to tour the classrooms?"
"Of course!" she exclaimed, clearly thrilled by the request. "I'd be delighted to show you around personally. Please, follow me."
As we moved through the hallways, the principal enthusiastically detailed the school's curriculum and facilities. I nodded at appropriate intervals, but my attention was elsewhere, scanning each room we passed for two specific faces.
After visiting three classrooms, we approached a bright corner room with colorful artwork adorning the windows.
My heart rate quickened as I caught a glimpse of dark curls through the glass-Aria's unmistakable bouncing energy as she danced around a table where several children were engaged in an art project.
"This is our kindergarten special activities room," the principal explained. "The children come here for creative projects and-"
"Those children in the corner," I interrupted, gesturing toward the twins. "Who are they?"
The principal followed my gaze. "Ah, Aria and Ethan Wilson. They're quite the little celebrities, actually. They have quite a following on social media with their travel videos."
I moved closer to the door, drawn by an invisible force I couldn't resist. The principal continued talking, but her words faded into background noise as I stepped into the room, my eyes locked on the two small figures.
Aria noticed me first, her head snapping up with recognition flashing across her features.
"It's the handsome mister!" she exclaimed, dropping her crayon and pointing at me.
Ethan turned more slowly, his green eyes-my eyes-widening slightly as he recognized me too.
I crouched down to their level, my heart thundering so loudly I was certain everyone could hear it. The world around us seemed to blur as I focused entirely on these two small humans who, I was now certain, carried my blood.
"Ethan, he's the gentleman I met on the airplane, remember I told you?" Aria bubbled, tugging her brother's sleeve.
Ethan nodded, his expression guarded as he regarded me. "Hello, sir," he said, his tone polite but distant.
"Don't call me sir," I replied with a small smile. "You can call me Mr. Night, or Mr. Twilight."
"Mr. Twilight?" Aria's eyes grew round.
"Are you that Night person from our videos?" Ethan asked skeptically, his gaze shrewd and assessing in a way that felt like looking into a mirror.
"Don't I look like him? Or don't you believe me?" I kept my voice gentle, fighting to control the surge of emotions threatening to overwhelm me.
"Mr. Night!" Aria cheered, instantly accepting, while Ethan maintained his distance, studying me with those piercing eyes that were so unnervingly familiar.
I turned to Ethan, respecting his caution. "You can look more carefully to be sure. There are many imposters online, so it's good to be cautious."
After a moment of scrutiny, Ethan spoke again. "I've confirmed it's you, but why didn't you tell us who you were before?"
"Mr. Night," Aria interjected excitedly, "are you here to register your children for our school?"
The question hit me with unexpected force. I swallowed hard before answering softly, "My children are already at this school."
"Really? What are their names?" Aria bounced on her toes.
"I'll tell you next time," I said mysteriously, though my heart ached with the truth I couldn't yet share.
Twenty minutes later, I slid back into the Bentley, my mind reeling from the encounter. Thomas handed me a warm thermos.
"Mr. Shaw, it's cold today. This will help protect your stomach," he said, gesturing for me to drink.
I accepted it wordlessly, taking a careful sip of the honey-infused milk.
"Mr. Shaw, please drink more," Thomas urged. "Your health is particularly important now, especially with the potential changes coming to your life."
I nodded. "Indeed."
"Seeing you with those children was quite touching," Thomas continued. "I couldn't resist taking a photo."
"Photo? Send it to me," I demanded immediately.
As I examined the image on my phone, something unfamiliar happened-a genuine smile spread across my face. The photo captured a moment when both children were looking up at me, Aria with open fascination and Ethan with thoughtful curiosity.
"You seemed to connect well with them," Thomas observed, "though I noticed the boy was quite wary of you. Remarkable caution for someone so young."
"It's good that my child has such vigilance," I replied, approval evident in my tone. "It will protect them from harm."
"Mr. Shaw, you've already determined they're your children? Without DNA testing?"
"Is that necessary?" I countered, my gaze unwavering.
"And now, do you plan to tell Ms. Wilson?"
"No," I said decisively. "Not yet."
As the car pulled away from the curb, I took another look at the photo, my chest tight with an emotion I hadn't allowed myself to feel in years.
My children. Mine.
###chapter 141: Mr. Night Visited Your School?
Angela POV
I stood at the school entrance, watching Christopher guide the twins through the large wooden doors.
They looked so small next to his tall figure, with Aria bouncing excitedly as she told him about her upcoming art project while Ethan walked with his usual measured steps.
A knot of discomfort tightened in my stomach. I had already declined Christopher's advances the last time we spoke, yet here he was again, inserting himself into our daily routine.
He'd appeared at my door this morning, saying, "Didn't we agree you'd think about it? It's been days, I'm guessing you've made up your mind."
His persistence felt suffocating, but with my old secondhand car broken down, I'd reluctantly accepted his help for today.
As the twins disappeared inside, I felt a prickle at the back of my neck-that unmistakable sensation of being watched. I scanned the street until my eyes landed on it: the same black Bentley I'd noticed yesterday, now parked across the street in a different position.
Or perhaps, this is just another wealthy parent's car, I thought, trying to reassure myself. This is an exclusive private school after all. Luxury cars are common here.
Still, something about its presence felt deliberate, calculated.
Christopher emerged from the school, his expression warming as he approached me.
"The children are safely inside," he said. "Aria made me promise to come see her art exhibition next week."
I smiled politely, though my attention remained divided. "Thank you for bringing us. I know you're busy," I said, then added deliberately, "I'm planning to buy a car tomorrow. That way, you won't need to take time out of your schedule to help with the children anymore."
Christopher fell silent for a moment, his expression clouding slightly. "Have you chosen one already?"
"Yes, I've found one within my budget. I'll go see it tomorrow."
"Then I'll accompany you," he said, his tone leaving little room for argument.
I hesitated, then nodded. "All right. And when we go... I'll have something important to tell you." This would be my opportunity to formally decline his pursuit, once and for all.
My eyes drifted back to the Bentley, and this time Christopher noticed, following my gaze.
"Angela."
"It's nothing," I replied quickly, forcing my attention back to him. "You should head to the office. Blake Capital needs you."
Christopher's eyes narrowed slightly. "Are you sure you're alright? I can drive you to the office."
"I'm fine. It's a short walk from here," I insisted. "We'll talk this afternoon. I'll explain everything then."
After a moment's hesitation, he nodded. "Until later, then."
As Christopher's car pulled away, I took a deep breath and did something impulsive-I walked directly toward the black Bentley.
My heart pounded as I approached. The windows were tinted nearly black, making it impossible to see inside. I stopped beside the driver's side door and, before I could lose my nerve, rapped my knuckles against the window.
No response.
I knocked again, harder this time.
Still nothing.
Bending down, I tried to peer through the window, shading my eyes against the morning sun's glare. The tint was too dark, revealing nothing but shadowy outlines that might have been my own reflection.
After several attempts, I straightened up, frustrated. Perhaps I was being paranoid-seeing threats where none existed. Still, my instincts rarely led me astray, and something about this vehicle felt wrong.
Reluctantly, I turned and headed toward my office, unaware of the movements inside the car as I walked away.
***
That evening, I stood by my bedroom window, pulling the curtains closed as the twins prepared for bed. Aria was still chattering about her day, particularly excited about a visitor who had come to their classroom.
"Mama, he knew about our videos! He called himself Mr. Night, like from the comments!"
I froze, curtain still in hand. "Mr. Night visited your school?"
"Yes! He was very tall with green eyes," Ethan added from the doorway, more reserved but equally intrigued. "He said his children already attend our school."
My blood ran cold. Before I could question them further, my phone chimed with a notification.
Night: Hello.
I stared at the message, my fingers suddenly unsteady as I typed a reply.
Me: Mr. Night, good evening.
Looking out the window, I noticed with a jolt that the black Bentley was parked across the street, barely visible in the evening shadows.
Me: Mr. Night, have you been busy lately? You never responded about the bank account when I asked earlier.
Night: Yes.
Me: Could you send your account number now? I need to return the money to you.
Night: Fine.
I waited, but no account information arrived.
Me: Mr. Night?
Night: When are you free? Let's meet in person.
Me: Mr. Night, can't I just transfer the money to your account?
Night: I only accept cash.
Night: If you don't want to repay it, that's also fine.
My heart raced as I stared at his messages. Something felt off-dangerous, even.
Me: Where should we meet?
I waited for his response, but none came. When I looked out the window again, the black Bentley had vanished.
###chapter 142: This Man Thought He Could Be A Father To My Children? 
Sean POV
Through the Bentley's tinted windows, I watched as Christopher Blake helped my children out of his car. My children. The possessive thought burned like acid in my stomach.
And there was Angela, smiling politely at Christopher as he leaned closer to speak to her. Something twisted painfully in my chest.
Five years apart, and now this man thought he could simply step into my place? Into my family?
"Thomas," I said, not taking my eyes off the trio, "did you hear what Blake just said to her?"
Thomas adjusted his glasses, peering through the window. "I'm afraid not, Mr. Shaw. They're too far away for me to read lips accurately."
My jaw clenched as Christopher's hand briefly touched Angela's arm before he turned to walk the twins to the school entrance. The casual intimacy of the gesture made my blood boil.
This man thought he could be a father to my children? My children?
I unlocked my phone and typed quickly:
Me (as Night): Today convenient for our transaction?
Angela's response came almost immediately:
Angela: What time were you thinking?
Me (as Night): Afternoon.
Angela: I'm afraid this afternoon won't work. Could we reschedule for tomorrow?
I knew it. She had plans with Christopher. My fingers moved swiftly across the screen:
Me (as Night): No. I need the money urgently today. Can't you change your plans?
I could almost picture her expression-that slight furrow between her brows when she felt cornered. She didn't know "Mr. Night" was me, of course.
Angela: If it's that urgent, I could wire the money directly to your account. Carrying that much cash isn't safe anyway.
I smiled grimly. Of course she'd try to find a compromise. That was Angela-always practical, always trying to find the middle ground. But I needed her away from Christopher Blake today.
Me (as Night): No. I need cash. Le Bernardin, 4pm. Private room upstairs.
***
"So we're agreed on the plan?" I asked Thomas as we sat in my office later that morning, the Manhattan skyline stretching beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows.
Thomas nodded, flipping through his tablet notes. "I believe I've found a suitable candidate, Mr. Shaw. They're distant relatives of the Shaw family-so distant that I'd have trouble explaining the exact connection. They live in the Bronx, both parents work at mid-level corporate jobs, and they have a son about the same age as your children."
"Current school situation?"
"Local public preschool. Nothing special." Thomas adjusted his glasses. "I've arranged to contact them today, but I should mention there might be resistance. The social and economic gap is substantial, and they might question why a distant relative like yourself would suddenly take interest in their child's education."
I leaned back in my chair, drumming my fingers against the polished mahogany desk. "Offer them whatever it takes. Full scholarship, housing allowance, future college fund-make it impossible to refuse."
"And if they ask about your sudden interest?"
"Tell them I'm expanding the Shaw family's charitable initiatives, starting with those who share our blood. Make it sound altruistic." I waved my hand dismissively. "Just get it done."
Thomas made a note. "And once they agree? What's the next step?"
"The child transfers to my children's school immediately. We arrange 'coincidental' meetings. The children become friends. It's simple."
"And the parents? They'll expect to meet you."
I hadn't considered that. "Keep my involvement minimal. I'm a busy man supporting their child's future. Any necessary meetings can be brief and formal."
Thomas hesitated. "Mr. Shaw, if I may... this plan requires the child to stay somewhere near the school. The commute from the Bronx would be impractical."
"Put them up in a hotel near the school."
"I've been thinking about the logistics," Thomas continued. "As part of the scholarship, we could arrange for the child to visit your apartment on weekends for enrichment activities. This would create natural opportunities to invite Aria and Ethan over for playdates."
I raised an eyebrow. "You expect me to entertain a child I barely know every weekend?"
"It would be limited to scheduled visits, sir. And it provides the perfect pretext to invite your children to your home without raising suspicions." Thomas adjusted his glasses. "We would never separate the child from his parents-that would be cruel. This is simply an educational opportunity with some social benefits."
I considered this. The thought of my empty penthouse occasionally filled with children's laughter-a stepping stone to eventually having my own children there-stirred something unexpected within me.
"Fine," I conceded. "But be clear with the family-this is about educational opportunities, not taking their child away from them."
***
By late afternoon, I sat in the private dining room at Le Bernardin, scowling at the empty chair across from me. Thomas stood near the window, his reflection visible in the darkened glass.
"She's not late yet, Mr. Shaw," he observed quietly. "It's only 3:55."
I didn't respond, staring instead at the entrance visible from our elevated position. My mood had darkened throughout the day, thoughts of Angela meeting with Christopher consuming me despite my efforts to focus on work.
"May I ask why you're still so upset?" Thomas ventured. "Ms. Wilson has already agreed to meet 'Mr. Night' here."
"She agreed to meet 'Mr. Night,'" I said coldly. "She has no idea it's me. For all I know, she already spent the afternoon with Blake."
Thomas was quiet for a moment. "Mr. Shaw, if I may speak frankly..."
I gestured impatiently for him to continue.
"Ms. Wilson has been raising your children alone for five years. You were legally divorced. Her keeping some distance from you isn't unreasonable, especially given the circumstances."
His words hit me with unexpected force. Five years. My children had lived five years without me. And Angela had been alone all that time, raising them by herself. Instead of remarrying or moving on, she'd remained single-focused solely on our children.
Rather than feeling angry that she might be spending time with Blake, shouldn't I be grateful she hadn't married someone else in all this time?
"You're more perceptive than I give you credit for, Thomas," I admitted, feeling the tension drain from my shoulders.
"Thank you, sir." He paused. "Though such insights might merit consideration during our next compensation review."
I almost smiled. "We'll discuss that back at the office."
"About the child from the Bronx," Thomas continued. "Everything is arranged. The family has agreed to the scholarship and weekend program. We can meet them tomorrow to discuss the details."
"Good." I nodded. "Though I won't have him calling me 'father' or anything similar. That title is reserved for my own children."
"'Uncle' would be more appropriate," Thomas suggested. "It matches how Aria and Ethan know 'Mr. Night' already. And it maintains appropriate boundaries with the family."
"Acceptable. Make sure the parents understand their child will always return home to them. This is about creating opportunities, not separating families."
We spent the next few minutes discussing logistics when movement at the restaurant entrance caught my eye. My heart stuttered as a familiar figure appeared in the doorway.
###chapter 143: Is She That Eager To Meet A Strange Man?
Sean POV
"Ms. Wilson has arrived!" Thomas suddenly exclaimed, pointing toward the entrance.
"Lower your voice," I hissed, pulling him back. "Don't let her see us."
Thomas immediately covered his mouth with his hand and hunched down, his eyes still peering anxiously over the railing. I glanced at my watch-still thirty minutes before our scheduled meeting time.
My breath caught as I observed Angela more carefully. She had dressed with particular care today-a tailored navy dress that accentuated her figure, hair styled in loose waves that framed her face, makeup applied with subtle precision.
Her lipstick was a vibrant shade that made her lips look irresistibly kissable, drawing attention to their moist fullness.
She looked elegant yet undeniably sensual.
I felt something shift inside me-admiration quickly giving way to a burning jealousy, then to cold anger.
Why is she here so early? Is she that eager to meet a strange man?
And why would she dress so beautifully for a stranger? She never put in this much effort when meeting me...
My fist clenched involuntarily. After a moment, I consciously relaxed my fingers, reminding myself, Calm down. The stranger she's meeting is "Mr. Night"-which is me.
Angela entered with confident grace, her designer handbag complementing her polished appearance. The uniformed waiter immediately approached her.
"Ms. Wilson, good afternoon," he greeted with practiced professionalism.
"Hello," she replied. "I have a reservation with Mr. Night."
The waiter nodded and began guiding her through the restaurant. I watched with growing confusion as he led her not toward the window tables but in the opposite direction-toward the staircase leading to our private level.
"What's happening?" I muttered. "Did the waiter misunderstand, or is there a problem with the reservation?"
The waiter continued leading Angela toward the stairs that would bring her directly to our section.
"Oh my God," Thomas whispered, panic evident in his voice. "The waiter isn't bringing her up here, is he? Mr. Shaw, what do we do?"
Thomas's eyes widened with anxiety. "What now? She'll discover us! You're not really here to meet her-you're using Mr. Night's identity to disrupt her date with Christopher Blake. If she sees you now, won't your identity be exposed?"
"Why are you panicking?" I replied calmly. "Take a breath. She's merely coming upstairs. What's strange about running into us here? Do you really think she'd connect me to Mr. Night?"
Thomas seemed to collect himself. "You're right. We're not sitting at the table where she was supposed to meet him. She can't possibly figure out this scheme."
He grabbed his coffee cup and took a large gulp, trying to steady his nerves.
Moments later, the waiter led Angela up the stairs and toward the private area where we were seated. To my astonishment, he stopped at the table directly next to ours.
"Ms. Wilson, this is your reserved table with Mr. Night," the waiter announced.
A tense silence fell over all three of us. Thomas froze mid-sip. I maintained a neutral expression despite my surprise. Angela, who had already noticed us while ascending the stairs, stood perfectly still, her expression shifting rapidly.
I observed as confusion gave way to dawning comprehension, then to unmistakable disgust on her face.
"I'm sorry," she said to the waiter, her voice crisp with barely contained irritation, "but I've changed my mind about this location. Could we move to a different table?"
She inquired whether there were any available tables downstairs.
"Yes, we do have several open tables," the waiter confirmed.
"That would be better," Angela nodded. "Please find me a window seat-"
Before she could finish, I rose from my chair and moved to stand beside her. She instinctively stepped backward.
Her heel caught, and she stumbled. I reacted instantly, my arm circling her waist and pulling her against me. She collided with my chest, and I breathed in the familiar scent of her perfume, feeling the softness of her body against mine.
"That nervous to see me?" I asked, my voice low and teasing.
Once steady, Angela pushed against me. "Let go of me."
I remained immovable, my arm firmly around her waist. The waiter, sensing the tension, took two steps back.
"Since we know each other," I said smoothly, "why not join my table? No need to trouble yourself going downstairs."
I guided Angela toward my table, my arm still possessively around her waist.
"Who says I want to sit with you?" Angela struggled against my hold. "Let me go! And why are you even here? What are you trying to do? Are you following me?"
I gave her a cold smile. "Angela, why don't you ask the waiter when we arrived? You might find the answer interesting."
She paused, suddenly realizing that I had been here before her.
Thomas stood quickly, attempting to ease the tension. "Ms. Wilson, what a coincidence! You're here for lunch too? It's already late afternoon and you're just having lunch now? Well, since we've run into each other, why not join us?"
"No thank you," Angela replied firmly. "I won't be dining with you."
"Even if it's with Wilson Advisory Partners' main investor?" I asked, the threat barely veiled in my tone.
Angela's eyes flashed. "Are you threatening me?"
"If you see it as a threat, then perhaps it is."
"Go ahead and withdraw your investment," she challenged. "See if I care?"
"You really think I wouldn't?"
"Well, you went to such great lengths to invest in the first place," she replied with biting sarcasm. "So you tell me."
My expression hardened, my green eyes narrowing dangerously.
"Let go."
I made no move to release her.
"Mr. Shaw, Ms. Wilson," Thomas interjected nervously, "please, both of you calm down. "
He leaned closer to me and whispered, "Sir, perhaps you should let her go now."
Reluctantly, I loosened my grip.
The moment she was free, Angela stepped back, putting distance between us. I kept my gaze fixed on her, my eyes never leaving her face.
"Ms. Wilson," Thomas tried again, "why not sit with us? Let's all be civil, shall we?"
"No need," Angela replied. "I have another appointment."
"With whom?" I demanded.
"That's none of your business."
"A man?" I pressed.
"Why does it matter to you?"
I felt a flare of jealousy but forced a dismissive smile. "Christopher Blake, I assume?"
Thomas watched me carefully, noting my rising irritation.
"Yes, actually," Angela confirmed with a cold smile. "I'm meeting Christopher for lunch, and then we're going to look at cars this afternoon. If there's nothing else, I'll be leaving now."
She pulled out her phone and began walking toward the exit, pretending to dial Christopher's number.
As she passed by me, I quickly caught her wrist in my grip.
"Let go of me!" she demanded.
"Going car shopping?" I replied. "I'll come with you."
###chapter 144: I'll Buy It For You
Sean POV
I grabbed Angela's wrist, pulling her toward the elevator with unwavering determination.
Behind us, Thomas called out in confusion, "Mr. Shaw, aren't we having lunch anymore?"
I ignored him, focused only on keeping my grip on Angela as I urged her to move faster.
I could feel her resistance, the subtle tension in her arm as she tried to pull away, but it only strengthened my resolve.
"Let go of me!" she demanded, her voice sharp with indignation as we descended in the elevator.
"No," I replied simply, my tone leaving no room for argument.
Outside the restaurant, I maneuvered her swiftly toward my waiting Bentley, Peter already standing at attention by the open door. I practically lifted her into the backseat, sliding in beside her before she could escape.
"Drive," I instructed Peter, maintaining my grip on Angela's wrist.
She continued struggling, her eyes flashing with genuine anger. "You need to let me go. I really do have an important appointment at Le Bernardin today."
"What important appointment?" I asked coolly, studying every minute shift in her expression.
"That's none of your business," she replied curtly, but I could sense the secret behind her words. Her eyes darted away too quickly-the way they always did when she was hiding something.
"None of my business? Fine, don't tell me," I said with a cold smile. "Then we'll just consider it unimportant and go car shopping first."
I'd chosen this excuse deliberately, knowing she genuinely needed a car, but more importantly, I needed time to confirm my suspicions.
"Sean!" Angela's voice suddenly rose, her amber eyes blazing with fury. "Whatever was between us ended five years ago. What gives you the right to harass me and interfere in my personal affairs? What's wrong with you? Is one Christina Jordan not enough?"
The mention of Christina's name immediately chilled the atmosphere in the car. I narrowed my eyes, about to explain, "Christina and I-"
"I don't care about you and her," Angela cut me off abruptly. "I just want you to stop hounding me."
A surge of anger burned in my chest. How could she so easily dismiss everything between us? Especially after potentially concealing our children from me.
"Angela, there's something you're hiding from me, isn't there?" I demanded, watching her carefully. "Why else would you be so eager to keep your distance?"
Though she maintained a facade of professional coolness, I caught the momentary panic that flashed across her features. Instead of answering directly, she countered, "Hiding? What would I possibly be hiding from you?"
I held her gaze for a long moment, feeling that familiar charge between us-the challenge, the pull that had always existed. "You tell me. Why are you so desperate to avoid me?"
"I'm not hiding anything," she shot back, but the slight tremor in her voice betrayed her.
"Fine" I replied with deliberate casualness.
Then I noticed Angela turn toward the window, pulling out her iPhone to send a text. I could see the iMessage screen, and my heart rate quickened as I realized she might be contacting "Mr. Night"-unaware that this was my alternate identity.
"Angela!" I called out, my voice sharper than I'd intended.
She startled, nearly dropping her phone. She frowned at me in annoyance.
"Who are you texting?" I asked, trying to mask my tension.
"Why do you care?" She quickly closed the screen and tucked her phone away. I was tempted to grab it from her, but decided against it. If I appeared too eager, she might become suspicious.
Peter caught my eye in the rearview mirror. "Where to next, Mr. Shaw?"
"The BMW showroom on Fifth Avenue," I answered, discreetly taking out my own iPhone and switching it to silent mode. I couldn't let Angela discover that "Mr. Night's" messages would come directly to my phone.
***
At the BMW showroom, Angela immediately pointed to a mid-range 3 Series sedan, declaring it the best option within her budget.
"Not that one," I immediately objected. "The performance is inadequate, and the safety features are insufficient." I turned to the sales consultant hovering nearby. "Show her the top-of-the-line 7 Series instead."
Angela's expression hardened. "I can't afford that, and I don't need something so extravagant."
"I'll buy it for you," I said casually, enjoying the flash of irritation that crossed her face.
"I don't need your charity," she refused flatly, her eyes sparking with defiance.
"Why not?" I tried appealing to her business sense. "Isn't it better for the CEO of Wilson Advisory Partners to have a safe, reliable vehicle? It's practically a business necessity."
She countered swiftly, "Really? So the president of Shaw Group gives luxury cars worth over $100,000 to all his business partners?"
I held her gaze steadily. "If they were like you, I might."
I watched as Angela turned to the sales consultant, insisting on test driving her chosen model. I knew how stubborn she could be, but I could match her obstinacy any day. When she prepared to get into the driver's seat, I quickly claimed the passenger side.
"Why are you so persistent?" she asked, exasperation evident in her voice.
I fastened my seatbelt and deliberately asked, "How's your driving?"
"Terrible. Absolutely awful. I'm practically a menace on the road," she retorted with a cold smile, clearly hoping to discourage me.
I raised an eyebrow, unfazed. "Oh? I've never ridden with a road menace before. It's about time I tried."
I observed her tense jaw and slightly trembling fingers, sensing that familiar tension between us-a mixture of anger, frustration, and an undeniable attraction neither of us could fully suppress.
###chapter 145: Not For Your Attention
Angela POV
I caught his reflection in the rearview mirror-that confident, self-assured expression that had once captivated me and now only fueled my anger. Without warning, I stomped on the accelerator, launching the car forward with enough force to push Sean back into his seat.
The BMW responded immediately, gliding through the dealership's exit and onto the test drive route. I deliberately took corners faster than necessary, watching Sean's expression shift from amusement to surprise.
"Taking the scenic route?" he asked casually, though his white-knuckled grip on the door handle betrayed his discomfort.
I guided the car toward an open plaza, where a large modern sculpture dominated the center. As we approached, I accelerated instead of slowing, driving straight toward the imposing metal structure.
"Angela!" Sean's voice lost its composure. "Watch out!"
His hand shot out, reaching for the steering wheel. Just before he could interfere, I executed a perfect controlled drift, the tires squealing as the car circled the sculpture with practiced precision. The BMW responded beautifully, exactly as I had anticipated.
I slowed to a normal pace, unable to suppress the satisfaction I felt at Sean's stunned expression.
"Were you trying to kill us?" he asked, his breathing slightly elevated. His eyes studied me intently, surprise giving way to something that looked remarkably like admiration.
"You did that on purpose," he stated, not a question but a realization. "When did you learn to drive like that?"
I kept my eyes on the road, refusing to acknowledge the slight flutter in my chest at his impressed tone. "You don't know a lot about me anymore, Sean. Five years is a long time."
"Indeed it is," he agreed, his voice dropping lower.
Without warning, his hand reached across the console, fingers capturing my chin with gentle firmness. His thumb brushed across my lower lip, the touch sending an unwelcome shiver down my spine.
"You never used to wear such bold lipstick," he murmured. "This shade suits you."
I jerked my head away, my pulse betraying me by quickening at his touch. "Don't."
Sean leaned closer, invading my personal space. The scent of his cologne intensified, wrapping around me like a memory I couldn't escape. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, focusing on the road ahead rather than the alarming proximity of his face to mine.
"If you touch me again," I warned, my voice steady despite my racing heart, "I'll report you for sexual harassment."
His chuckle was low, almost predatory. "You dress like this, looking so irresistible, and expect men not to notice? Isn't that the point?"
My knuckles whitened on the steering wheel.
"Even if it was, it certainly wasn't for your attention."
The temperature in the car seemed to drop ten degrees. From the corner of my eye, I saw his expression harden, the playfulness vanishing entirely. The air around him shifted, a cold anger radiating from his rigid posture.
I guided the car back to the dealership in tense silence, pulling into the same spot we'd departed from.
The sales consultant immediately approached, his practiced smile faltering slightly at the palpable tension between us.
"How was your experience, Ms. Wilson?"
"I'll take it," I replied firmly, stepping out of the vehicle. "I'd like to complete the paperwork now."
"Excellent choice! If you'll follow me to the office-"
"I'll handle the payment," Sean interrupted, following us.
"No," I stated firmly. "I'm purchasing this vehicle myself. If Mr. Shaw attempts to pay, I'll walk away immediately."
The salesman looked between us, clearly confused by the hostility, but quickly recovered. "Of course, Ms. Wilson. Whatever you prefer."
As we entered the office, Sean's phone buzzed. He checked the screen, his expression darkening further.
"Due to production constraints, the vehicle will be ready for pickup in two days," the salesman explained as I signed the paperwork and handed over my credit card for the deposit.
"That's fine," I nodded. "I'll be back then."
"If you'll excuse me," I said to no one in particular, "I need to use the restroom."
In the privacy of the restroom, I pulled out my phone and opened my conversation with Mr. Night. My fingers hesitated over the keyboard before typing:
Would it be possible to postpone our meeting until later today?
I waited several minutes, anxiously checking for a response, but none came. With a sigh of disappointment, I tucked the phone away and splashed cool water on my face, careful not to smudge my makeup.
When I emerged, Sean was waiting outside the showroom, his tall figure silhouetted against the afternoon light. The coldness in his demeanor hadn't dissipated, though his expression softened slightly when he spotted me.
"I'll drive you back," he offered, gesturing toward the black car parked nearby.
"No, thank you," I declined, already raising my hand to hail a taxi. "I prefer to go alone."
For a moment, I thought he might insist, but instead, he simply watched as I climbed into the cab that pulled up. Through the window, I caught one last glimpse of him standing there, unmoving, making no attempt to follow.
As the taxi pulled away, I exhaled slowly, torn between relief and an unexplainable disappointment. I glanced back, half-expecting to see his car following us, but the street behind remained clear.
My phone rang, Christopher's name lighting up the screen.
"Angela," his voice came through, warm and expectant. "I'm waiting outside your office. Are we still looking at cars today?"
Guilt washed over me. I had completely forgotten our arrangement, too caught up in my encounter with Sean and the mysterious Mr. Night.
"Christopher, I-" I began, then stopped. His persistent kindness suddenly felt suffocating rather than comforting. "I already bought a car."
"Oh," he sounded genuinely surprised. "You went by yourself?"
###chapter 146: Don't You Know How Annoying You Are?
Christopher POV
"You went by yourself?" I asked, keeping my tone light despite the suspicion gnawing at me.
A noticeable pause. "Yes, I went alone."
The lie hung between us, invisible but palpable even through the phone connection. I didn't need to see her face to know she was hiding something-her hesitation said everything.
She had gone with Sean.
The realization made my knuckles whiten around the phone.
"I see," I replied, forcing a smile into my voice that my face didn't mirror. "Would you like to meet for coffee tonight? We haven't had a proper conversation in days."
"I can't tonight," she said quickly. "The children-"
"I'll have my assistant look after them," I interrupted smoothly. "We'll stay at the café near your home. An hour at most."
"Christopher, I don't think-"
"I'll see you at eight," I said firmly before ending the call, refusing to give her another chance to reject me.
***
I watched Angela from across the small table, studying the subtle tension in her shoulders, the forced politeness in her smile. The café's ambient lighting cast soft shadows across her face, highlighting her cheekbones but failing to soften the weariness in her eyes.
"What do you think about the hazelnut latte? Or perhaps the caramel macchiato?" I asked, deliberately weighing each option as I examined the menu. "They also have a new vanilla bean pastry that pairs well with either."
"That sounds fine," Angela nodded, her patience still intact.
"Or the chocolate croissant? I've heard it's exceptional here."
A flash of impatience crossed her features. "Christopher, honestly, I don't need anything elaborate. Just coffee is fine."
I continued as if I hadn't noticed her growing irritation. "What about their almond cake? Would you prefer that instead?"
"It doesn't matter," she said, her polite mask slipping. "I won't eat much anyway. Let's just order."
I handed the menu to the increasingly uncomfortable server. "We'll start with these, thank you."
When the server departed, I reached into my inner jacket pocket and withdrew a small blue box, sliding it across the table toward Angela.
"Aria and Ethan already have their Christmas gifts," I said softly. "This is for you."
Angela hesitated before accepting the box. Opening it, she revealed an elegant brooch-a delicate design from this season's most exclusive collection, perfectly matching the beige coat she favored.
I watched her expression carefully, noting the conflict playing across her features. She recognized the thought behind the gift, knew rejecting it outright would seem ungrateful after everything I'd done for her family.
"This brooch is beautiful," she said finally, offering a polite smile.
My heart accelerated as I leaned forward slightly. "I'm glad you like it."
Her next words cut through my optimism like a blade. "I do like it. But I like the brooch-not the person giving it."
My expression froze as the words registered, a sharp pain blooming in my chest.
"Beautiful jewelry deserves appreciation," Angela continued, her voice gentle but firm. "But accepting gifts depends on who's giving them. Not everyone's gifts should be accepted."
She carefully returned the brooch to its box and pushed it back toward me. The simple gesture felt like a physical blow.
"This gift... you should save it for someone deserving. And please stop wasting your time on me. These past five years, you've been so kind to me and the children. I'm grateful, truly. If you ever need anything, I'll help however I can."
I pressed my lips together, fighting to maintain my composure despite the ache spreading through me.
"When I choose a gift, it's because I, Christopher Blake, believe the recipient is worthy. Your existence inspired me to buy this brooch. If you won't accept it, what value does it have now?"
I lowered my gaze, attempting to hide my devastation. "Is that why you refused to let me accompany you to look at cars this afternoon? To tell me this?"
"No," Angela replied. "I just don't want to waste your time anymore."
She paused, then added with unsettling calmness, "If you hadn't shown up unannounced, we wouldn't be having this conversation now. I'm... tired, Christopher."
"Tired?" I echoed, surprised by the depth of pain her words inflicted.
"Yes, tired. I've made it clear I don't have feelings for you, but you continue to pursue me. I spend energy every day managing this situation, and it's exhausting. Especially since returning to New York, I don't have the patience for this anymore. Please stop wasting your time on me. Find someone who deserves your attention."
Her words triggered something deep within me. A cold flash shot through my eyes as unbidden memories suddenly surfaced.
"Don't you know how annoying you are?" My mother's voice, sharp and cruel, echoed from my childhood. "Is your world only about me? Why do you always cling to me? Go bother your father! You useless child, what are you telling me? It's because you're so worthless that he treats me this way!"
I could feel the cold marble floor beneath my knees, the icy water poured over my head, the sensation of nearly drowning in that apartment so many years ago.
"Mom... I'm sorry... I was wrong..." My childhood voice trembled in my memory as my mother turned away, leaving me shivering alone.
I bit my lower lip unconsciously, my hands clenched into fists so tight my knuckles turned white. I struggled to contain the emotions threatening to overwhelm me.
Angela continued, oblivious to my internal turmoil. "I've been very clear. I hope from now on you'll focus on your own life and stop seeking me out."
She gathered her purse and stood. A server approached with our order. "Ma'am, your latte..."
"No need, thank you," Angela responded, then walked out of the café without looking back. I watched her silhouette disappear into the night, feeling a cold emptiness spread through me.
The server noticed the change in me-the sudden chill emanating from my body, the pallor that must have overtaken my face and lips, as though I'd been struck physically.
"Sir, are you alright?" he asked, leaning closer with concern.
"Get away!" I exploded suddenly, violently sweeping the tray from his hands.
Hot coffee splashed across his uniform and skin. He cried out in pain, stumbling backward. The café fell silent as other patrons turned to stare, whispers and gasps filling the space.
Reality crashed back into me. I blinked, suddenly aware of my outburst and overcome with shame. I quickly moved to help the server up.
"I'm terribly sorry," I said with genuine remorse. "I lost control. Are you hurt? I should take you to the hospital to be checked."
Confusion and wariness filled the server's eyes as he struggled to reconcile the enraged man from moments ago with the polite gentleman now helping him.
"I-I'm fine, sir," he stammered.
I gently pulled up his sleeve to examine the injury. His arm was already turning red and swelling. My expression darkened with concern.
"Use cold water immediately to reduce the temperature," I instructed, accompanying him to the back of the café to rinse the burn.
I watched his hands grow numb under the cold winter water and insisted, "I truly apologize. Please let me take you to the hospital."
"It's not necessary, sir," he protested weakly. "It's just a minor burn. The cold water helps."
"Please, come with me," I persisted. "This is my responsibility."
Eventually, he relented with a hesitant nod.
As I led him out of the café, Angela's words continued to echo in my mind: "I'm tired."
###chapter 147:  Christopher Uncle... Does He Want To Be Our Father?
Angela POV
I pushed open the door to my apartment, feeling a strange lightness in my chest. The evening air had cleared my head during the walk home from the café, and despite the uncomfortable conversation with Christopher, I felt as though a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.
Ethan was sitting on the bench in the entryway, his small face lighting up when he saw me.
"Mama, you're back," he said, sliding off the bench and walking toward me.
I smiled, setting my purse down on the side table. "Yes. Were you waiting for me?"
Ethan nodded. "Mama, did you and Christopher uncle have a fight?"
His perceptiveness sometimes caught me off guard. I knelt down to his level, keeping my voice gentle. "No, we didn't fight. I just needed to make some things clear to him."
Ethan hesitated, his fingers fidgeting with the hem of his pajama top. "Mama, Christopher uncle... does he want to be our father?"
The directness of his question made me pause. I chose my words carefully, not wanting to burden him with adult complexities.
"He might have wanted that before," I admitted. "But after tonight, I don't think he'll want that anymore."
"So you rejected Christopher uncle?" Ethan's gaze was unwavering, almost too mature for his young face.
"Yes," I said simply. "I did."
His brow furrowed slightly. "Will Christopher uncle still come to see us?"
"I don't know," I answered honestly.
Ethan was quiet for a moment, then asked, "Are we still going to live here?"
The question gave me pause. I hadn't fully considered the implications of my conversation with Christopher. This apartment was his-he'd arranged it for us when we first returned to New York. While the rent was paid for several months in advance, continuing to live in his property after rejecting him felt wrong.
"I'm not sure," I admitted. "I've paid the rent already, but... this is Christopher's apartment. Would you mind if we moved? Would it be difficult for you and Aria?"
A small smile touched Ethan's lips. "If you want to move, Mama, I'll help explain to Aria. She'll understand."
My heart swelled with pride and gratitude. My little boy, so young yet so understanding. "Thank you, sweetheart. I appreciate that."
Later that night, after putting the twins to bed, I sat cross-legged on my own bed with my phone in hand. The conversation with Mr. Night remained open on my screen, my last message still unanswered.
Had he gone to Le Bernardin after all? Was he angry that I hadn't shown up? Or perhaps something had come up on his end as well.
With a sigh, I set my phone on the nightstand. I'd have to try contacting him again tomorrow. After the emotional toll of the day, sleep was what I needed most.
***
"You're looking for a new apartment?" Marcus's eyebrows shot up in surprise as he leaned against my office door the next morning. "That's sudden. I thought you had everything arranged before moving back to New York."
I didn't look up from the rental listings on my computer screen. "I have my reasons. Just help me find some options, please."
He folded his arms, his expression turning knowing. "Wait a minute. Don't tell me your current place was arranged by that Blake guy? And now you're moving out because you turned him down?"
I finally looked up, fixing him with my most professional stare. "Marcus, if you channeled your gossip energy into actual work, our company's performance might improve significantly."
He laughed, unfazed by my deflection. "Fine, fine. But if you're planning to stay in New York long-term, you should consider buying a place instead of renting. Save yourself the hassle of moving again later."
His casual suggestion triggered a chain of thoughts I'd been avoiding.
Was I planning to stay in New York permanently?
What if Sean discovered the twins and tried to take them from me?
Had returning from Italy been a mistake?
I shook my head slightly, pushing away the doubts. No one could simply take my children-not even Sean. I had raised them for five years on my own. They were mine.
"Boss? Everything okay?" Marcus's voice pulled me from my thoughts.
"I'm fine," I replied, straightening in my chair. "Let's focus on finding a suitable place."
I couldn't keep second-guessing myself. My employees were counting on me. I wouldn't let them down.
I left the office early that afternoon to pick up my new BMW.
New York's traffic was congested as always, and I drove carefully toward the twins' school, still getting used to the new vehicle.
As I approached the school entrance, I spotted Aria's dark curls bobbing animatedly as she spoke to a small boy I didn't recognize. Neither child noticed me immediately, too engrossed in their conversation.
"Mama!" they called in unison when they finally spotted me, Aria's face lighting up with excitement.
"Tommy, this is my mom," Aria said proudly, gesturing toward me with elaborate formality.
The little boy-Tommy-offered a polite nod. "Hello, Mrs. Wilson."
"Hello," I replied, studying him curiously.
I reached into my bag and pulled out the imported candies I'd picked up earlier, offering one to the unfamiliar child. Tommy hesitated, seemingly unsure whether he should accept.
"Tommy, take it!" Aria insisted, grabbing the candy and pressing it into his hand. "We're friends now, so you don't have to be shy with us."
I noticed Ethan watching silently, his lips pressed together in an expression that seemed neither welcoming nor hostile-just cautious.
"Thank you, Mrs. Wilson," Tommy said, his cheeks flushing slightly as he accepted the treat.
"He's Mr. Night uncle's relative," Aria explained cheerfully. "Mr. Night uncle brought him to school today."
I felt my heart skip a beat. "Mr. Night's... relative?"
"Uh-huh," Aria nodded enthusiastically. "Mr. Night also sponsors our school and has given us lots of gifts!"
My mind raced to process this information. So Mr. Night was connected to our school somehow, and wealthy enough to sponsor a child's education at this exclusive institution. It made sense that he might help a relative attend such a prestigious school.
The whole situation felt increasingly strange-if he was wealthy enough to send a relative's child to such an elite school, why would he claim to need money so urgently?
And why insist on being repaid in cash rather than through a simple bank transfer?
Something about the situation still didn't feel right, and as I gathered my children to leave, I couldn't shake the sensation that I was missing an important piece of the puzzle.
###chapter 148: Dangerous Proximity
Angela POV
The past week had been unusually quiet. Christopher Blake had seemingly vanished from my life-no calls, no messages, no unexpected appearances at my door or office.
Even Sean Shaw had maintained his distance since our car shopping excursion.
I should have felt relieved. This was exactly what I wanted, wasn't it? Peace and quiet to focus on my children and growing my company without emotional complications.
Yet the sudden silence felt more like the calm before a storm than genuine respite.
My instincts proved correct when my phone lit up that morning with Sean's name on the screen.
I deliberately silenced it, setting the device face-down on my desk. Whatever he wanted could wait-indefinitely, if I had my way.
Minutes later, a knock on my office door broke my concentration. Marcus entered, extending his phone toward me with an apologetic grimace.
"It's Sean Shaw," he whispered. "He says it's urgent."
With a deep sigh, I accepted the phone. "Sean, do you find this amusing?"
"What would you like me to say?" His voice carried that familiar cool detachment that always managed to infuriate me.
"Why are you calling my company when I didn't answer my phone?"
"Why didn't you answer your phone in the first place?" he countered smoothly.
"That's funny. Why would I need to answer your calls at all?"
A brief pause filled the line before he replied, "Have you forgotten our relationship, Angela? I'm your company's primary investor."
My irritation instantly transformed into professional concern. "I apologize. I assumed it was a personal call. Is there something we need to discuss?"
"Investment strategy proposals. We need to review them tonight."
As I returned Marcus's phone, I mentally calculated how this would impact my evening with the twins. "Send me the details," I said curtly before ending the call.
***
That evening, I stood before my closet, deliberating longer than necessary over my outfit.
I finally selected a black pantsuit-professional, conservative, and distinctly non-provocative. The perfect armor for whatever game Sean was playing.
"You and Aria need to go to bed early tonight, aunt Olivia Will take care of you." I said, kneeling to straighten Ethan's collar as he nodded solemnly.
"Where are you going, Mama?" Aria asked, her small fingers tugging at my sleeve.
"Just a business meeting, sweetheart. I'll be back before you know it."
My phone chimed with a text message from Thomas Smith:
Ms. Wilson, Mr. Shaw expects you at the Four Seasons Hotel, Suite 2801, at 8 PM to discuss investment proposals.
I stared at the screen in disbelief. A hotel suite? Was he serious?
"Why a hotel?" I muttered to myself, pacing the living room. "We could meet at his office, or a restaurant, or literally anywhere else."
Deep down, I knew exactly what Sean was doing-establishing control over the situation, creating an environment where he held all the power.
The Four Seasons lobby exuded luxury as I walked toward the elevators. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, reminding myself that this was strictly business. Nothing more.
The elevator chimed softly as it reached the 28th floor. Thomas Smith opened the door before I could knock, offering a polite nod before excusing himself and disappearing down the hallway, leaving me alone in the suite with Sean.
He stood by the window. I was struck by how much healthier and more handsome he looked than when I'd seen him just a week ago. It seemed his stomach condition had improved.
Instead of his usual impeccable suit, he wore dark slacks and a white button-down shirt with several buttons undone at the neck. I could faintly make out the defined muscle lines beneath the fabric.
The casual attire immediately put me on edge-this didn't look like someone prepared for a business meeting.
"You're here," he observed, turning to face me. "Would you like a drink?"
"Let's get straight to work," I replied, deliberately maintaining my distance.
A slight smile played at the corner of his mouth. "Don't be so tense, Angela. This is business, not personal."
Something in his tone suggested otherwise.
"This proposal is completely unworkable," Sean declared, tossing the document onto the coffee table between us. "Do you genuinely believe this risk assessment is reasonable?"
I straightened, meeting his gaze directly. "The data supports my conclusions, Sean."
"Five years, and this is all you've learned?" His words cut deeper than they should have.
"Please don't bring personal emotions into a business discussion."
"You're the one injecting personal feelings into this proposal, Angela." He leaned forward, his eyes narrowing. "Your projections are clouded by emotion, not reality."
I fought to keep my voice level. "I disagree. My analysis is sound."
"Is it?" Sean stood abruptly, moving around the table to my side. "Look here," he said, pointing to a specific section of the document. "This forecast completely contradicts current market trends."
He stood directly behind me now, close enough that I could feel the warmth radiating from his body. I tried to step away, only to find myself backed against the desk.
"You're too close, Sean," I warned, my voice quieter than intended.
He placed one hand on the desk, effectively trapping me. "Does this make you uncomfortable? I'm simply showing you where the problems are."
"I can see perfectly fine without you hovering over me."
His proximity was disorienting-the familiar scent, the steady rhythm of his breathing. My body remembered him even as my mind rebelled against the memories.
"Enough," I finally declared, gathering the documents. "This clearly isn't a productive business meeting. I'm leaving."
As I moved toward the door, Sean's hand caught my wrist. His grip wasn't painful, but it was firm enough to stop me in my tracks.
"We're not finished here," he said, his voice dropping lower.
"Let go of me, Sean." I tried to pull away, but he held fast.
"Five years later, and you're still running away when things get difficult."
"I'm not running," I retorted. "I'm removing myself from an unproductive situation."
"Look me in the eyes and say that."
I made the mistake of meeting his gaze. Something electric passed between us-anger and something more dangerous, something I refused to acknowledge.
His eyes dropped momentarily to my lips before returning to meet my stare, and I felt a familiar flutter in my stomach that I immediately tried to suppress.
"I need to go," I insisted, reaching for the door handle.
In one swift movement, Sean stepped forward, his palm flat against the door, preventing me from opening it. His other arm came up on my opposite side, effectively caging me between his body and the door. We were inches apart now, his breath warm against my skin.
"I'll leave when you approve a proper proposal," I said, fighting to keep my voice steady.
"Have I said you could leave?" His eyes darkened as they searched mine.
I was suddenly acutely aware of our positions-my back against the door, his body nearly touching mine.
I drew a deep breath, reminding myself of everything that had happened, of the life I'd built without him, of the promises I'd made to myself.
"Sean," I said firmly, my tone stern and unyielding, "move."
###chapter 149: Is He Just Enjoying the Thrill of Cheating?
Angela POV
His emerald eyes studied me with that infuriating intensity, his arms forming a cage around me.
For a moment, I thought he might refuse, but then he stepped back with deliberate slowness, his fingers deliberately brushing against my arm as he withdrew.
"Fine," he conceded. "But we still have work to do."
I exhaled slowly, straightening my jacket as I stepped away from the door. "Then let's focus on the investment proposal and nothing else."
Sean gestured toward the documents spread across the coffee table. "After you."
I moved to the sofa and sat at the far end, conscious of his eyes following me, tension still thick in the air.
Sean didn't immediately join me. Instead, he walked to the bar, the subtle flex of his shoulders visible beneath his shirt. "Drink?" he offered, glancing over his shoulder with a raised eyebrow.
"No, thank you," I replied coolly. "I'd prefer to keep a clear head."
His lips quirked into a half-smile. "What are you afraid of, Angela? That you might actually enjoy my company?"
I met his gaze steadily. "I'm afraid we'll waste more time on irrelevant conversations."
Sean returned with only a glass of water for himself, sitting down closer than necessary. I shifted away, creating more space between us.
"Am I making you nervous?" he asked, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Is my proximity that distracting?"
"Don't flatter yourself," I replied, reaching for the proposal. "I simply prefer to work without someone hovering over me."
I watched with reluctant admiration as he meticulously revised section after section. His fingers occasionally grazed the back of my hand as we both reached for the same document, and I couldn't tell if these contacts were accidental or deliberate.
"Your liquidity projections need work," Sean murmured, his face uncomfortably close to mine as he showed me another page.
"I see it," I replied tersely, trying to maintain some distance. "I can read it better if you'd move back a bit."
He chuckled, his breath warm against my cheek. "So tense, Angela. Is working beside me really that difficult for you? We used to spend hours like this, if you recall."
"That was a lifetime ago," I said, keeping my eyes fixed on the document.
"Yet here we are again," he observed, his voice dropping lower. "Some things never change."
Despite my determination to remain detached, I couldn't deny the value of his input. His revisions were thoughtful and precise, demonstrating a depth of financial acumen that reminded me why he was so successful.
The minutes stretched into hours as we worked, the tension in the room shifting from professional antagonism to something more complex.
Just as Sean finished explaining his final adjustment, my stomach let out an embarrassingly loud growl.
His eyebrow arched. "Sounds like someone needs to refuel."
Heat crept up my neck. "The proposal is finished. I should head home now."
"It's already past midnight," Sean said, checking his watch. "Let's grab something to eat first."
"That's not necessary. I can handle it myself at home."
Sean's expression softened unexpectedly. "I just helped you rewrite your entire proposal. Can't you at least buy me dinner as thanks?"
"Is that what this was about? Securing a dinner date?" I asked, arching an eyebrow.
"Not a date," he corrected, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Unless that's what you want it to be. "
I stared at him, momentarily thrown by his teasing. After considering the hours he'd just invested in improving my work, I reluctantly nodded. "Fine. A quick bite only."
Sean's face brightened visibly. "Perfect. Let me change into something more comfortable. Wait here for a few minutes."
As he disappeared into the bedroom, I reminded myself to remain vigilant. This was simply a thank-you dinner for his professional assistance, nothing more.
I settled back on the sofa, mentally reviewing the revisions we'd made. My thoughts were interrupted when Sean's phone, left on the coffee table, began to ring. I glanced at it reflexively, then looked away, not wanting to invade his privacy.
The ringing stopped, only to start again moments later. This time, I couldn't help but notice the name illuminated on the screen: Christina Jordan.
Something cold and bitter spread through my chest. Christina. Of course.
Memories flooded back-nights during our marriage when I'd wake to find Sean's side of the bed empty. The whispered calls, the late "work meetings." Always with Christina.
And now here I was, about to have dinner with him while Christina waited for his call. Was I simply the appetizer before his main course?
By the time Sean emerged from the bedroom in a fresh shirt and slacks, I had already gathered my belongings and was standing by the door.
"That was quick," he remarked, adjusting his cuffs. "Ready to go?"
"I need to get home," I said coldly, my voice betraying none of the anger simmering beneath the surface. "Something's come up."
Sean frowned. "We just agreed to have dinner. What's suddenly so urgent?"
"I remembered a prior commitment," I replied, my hand already on the door handle. "The proposal is finished. Our business is concluded."
"Angela-" he stepped toward me, confusion evident in his expression.
"Goodnight, Sean," I cut him off, yanking the door open and stepping into the hallway before he could see the hurt in my eyes.
I strode toward the elevator, ignoring Sean's calls behind me. The doors slid closed on his bewildered face, and I released the breath I hadn't realized I was holding.
In the elevator, memories flooded back.
During our marriage, Sean would slip from our bed in the middle of the night to meet Christina. Now he was trying to play both sides again.
Was this just a game to him? Did he simply enjoy the thrill of cheating?
###chapter 150: Old Feelings Die Hard
Sean POV
I stood frozen in the doorway of my Four Seasons penthouse suite, watching Angela storm away without a word. The elevator doors slid shut on her retreating figure, leaving confusion swirling in my mind.
What the hell just happened?
One minute we were dissecting investment proposals, the next she was bolting like I'd set the room on fire.
Her sudden shift gnawed at me. Unless Had Christopher Blake gotten to her? The thought ignited a blaze of anger in my chest, my hands curling into fists.
No one meddled in my affairs-and Angela, despite our tangled history, was still mine to handle. This wasn't over.
My lips pressed into a hard line as I strode toward the elevator, determined to catch her before she slipped away. Whatever had sparked this, I'd drag the truth out of her tonight.
My phone buzzed relentlessly in my pocket, halting my pursuit. I yanked it out, answering with a sharp,
 "What?"-my voice a blade of cold authority.
Silence stretched for a beat before a tentative female voice broke through.
"Sean, it's me."
"Christina." Not a question-a fact.
"Yes. You sound upset. Is something wrong?" Her tone softened. "I've been calling, but you didn't answer."
My mind sharpened instantly. "You've been calling me repeatedly?"
"I called once or twice, but when you didn't pick up, I got worried," she said, her voice syrupy. "I kept trying. You're not angry, are you? I was just concerned."
The puzzle snapped into place. I glanced at my phone-missed calls from Christina lighting up the screen like a neon sign.
Angela must've seen it. Her abrupt exit clicked into focus.
"Don't ever call me like that again," I ordered, my tone leaving no room for debate.
"I'm sorry, Sean. I was just worried something might've happened-"
"Enough." I cut her off. "If something had happened, how would spamming my phone help? You'd just drain my battery when I might need it."
She murmured an apology, but I didn't wait for more. "I have bigger things to deal with." I ended the call and shoved the phone back into my pocket, my strides purposeful as I hit the elevator.
Angela Wilson had just tipped her hand-she still cared. A flicker of satisfaction curled my lips. Her jealousy was a confession scrawled in bold ink.
The hotel parking garage loomed dim and shadowed. I spotted her instantly-her slender frame cutting through the gloom toward her car with that defiant grace of hers.
I reached her in seconds. As she yanked the car door open, I slammed it shut with one forceful shove, pinning her between me and the cold metal in a single, fluid motion.
She squirmed, her hands shoving against my chest.
"Let go of me," she snapped, her voice tight. Her eyes darted to where my fingers clamped her wrist, but she twisted her face away, refusing to meet my gaze.
I wasn't having it. My free hand shot up, gripping her chin firmly, forcing her head back until her hazel eyes locked with mine.
"I need to talk to you,"
Her lips parted, breath hitching. "Fine. Talk."
"You bolted from my suite like it was a crime scene," I said, "Was it those calls on my phone?"
Her jaw tightened under my fingers. "Why would I care about your phone? Your private life's got nothing to do with me."
"Doesn't it?" I pressed, my thumb brushing the edge of her lip, feeling the faint tremble there. "You didn't see anything?"
"No," she shot back too fast, her defiance brittle. "Let me go."
I shifted closer, my hips pinning hers against the car. My cock stirred at the feel of her body wriggling against me, her curves grinding into me with every futile twist.
I tightened my grip on her wrist, the other hand sliding from her chin to brace against the window, caging her in.
"If you didn't see anything," I murmured, voice dropping to a possessive growl, "why'd you turn to ice up there? Don't play me for a fool, Angela."
Her scent-jasmine and heat-flooded my senses, and fuck, it was intoxicating. Her breasts pressed against my chest as she fought to pull away, and I felt the blood rush south, my cock hardening against her thigh.
Five years hadn't dulled the way her body fit mine, like she was carved for me. My breath came heavier, desire tangling with the need to dominate this moment.
"There's nothing between Christina and me," I said, my words a hard, unyielding truth. "Nothing."
Her eyes flared-hurt, anger, something raw-before she masked it. "Why tell me? I don't give a damn about your girlfriend. Just let me go."
"I won't," I said, my voice a vow. My fingers dug into her wrist, and I leaned in, my lips grazing the shell of her ear. "If you don't care, why'd you flip like that?"
"It didn't change," she lied, but the crack in her voice betrayed her. "I've been the same."
"Bullshit." I pressed my body harder against hers, feeling her hips shift, her thighs brushing mine. My erection throbbed, straining against my trousers as her squirming stoked the fire in my veins.
"You've always been cold, but after those calls, you turned hostile. I know the difference."
She went still, her breath ragged.
The night wind whipped through the garage, tossing her hair across her flushed cheeks.
I wanted to bury my hands in it, to yank her head back and claim her mouth, her throat, every inch of her trembling frame. My cock ached at the thought, pulsing with a need I hadn't felt this sharp in years.
I dipped my head, lips hovering over hers, close enough to feel her shaky exhale. "That's the difference, Angela," I whispered, my voice thick with lust and certainty. "Why can't you just admit you're pissed at me over another woman!"
###chapter 151: That Night Wasn't an Accident
Angela POV
"Why can't you just admit you're pissed at me over another woman!"
Sean's accusation hit like a slap. I felt exposed, as if he'd peeled back my carefully constructed facade and revealed the raw hurt beneath. Yet even as I recognized the truth in his words, indignation flared within me.
"Don't flatter yourself," I replied coldly, trying to mask how his words had pierced me. "I'm not jealous. I simply despise men who can't remain faithful or constant."
My mind flashed unexpectedly to last month's charity auction. I'd spotted Sean across the ballroom, Christina Jordan clinging to his arm, her red lips curving into a possessive smile as she whispered something in his ear. The image burned in my memory, bringing a bitter taste to my mouth.
"There's nothing between Christina and me," Sean insisted, his green eyes searching mine with an intensity that made my breath catch.
Before I could snap back, his hands were on me-strong fingers curling around my hips, yanking me flush against him. My back hit the cool metal of the car as his body pinned me.
"What do I have now, Angela?" he murmured, his breath warm against my ear. "All I have are these tiny changes in your demeanor to judge whether you still feel anything for me. Even if it's just a trace."
I remained rigid in his embrace, desperately fighting to maintain my composure. I felt like ice, frozen in his arms, unable to move away yet refusing to yield.
"What exactly are you trying to say?" I challenged, injecting as much derision into my voice as possible. "Has the mighty CEO of Shaw Group suddenly turned sentimental?"
Sean's eyes narrowed, his jaw tightening. "Can't you hear what I'm saying, Angela?"
His voice echoed in the empty parking garage, amplifying the tension between us.
"Let me guess," I said with mock thoughtfulness, my tone deliberately provocative. "You regret our divorce? You want to start over? The great Sean Shaw wants to give us another chance?"
I infused each word with scorn, already preparing the cutting rejection I would deliver when he admitted it. Part of me anticipated-perhaps even hoped for-seeing him retreat the way he had five years ago.
But Sean saw through my strategy. His lips curved into a knowing smile that sent a jolt of awareness through me.
"Why provoke me when I've made myself painfully obvious?" he asked softly. "Yes, you're right. I do regret it."
He leaned closer, his face mere inches from mine. I could feel his breath against my lips, the heat of his body overwhelming my senses. Just as our lips nearly touched, I let out a contemptuous laugh.
Sean immediately froze, pulling back slightly.
"And what makes you think I'd ever accept your change of heart?" I demanded.
The garage lighting cast harsh shadows across his handsome features, highlighting the intensity in his gaze.
"You were the one who contacted the lawyer first," I continued, the old pain seeping into my voice despite my efforts to sound indifferent. "You initiated our divorce, Sean. You walked away first."
"I gave you what you wanted," he countered. "Filing for divorce was fulfilling your wish."
"My wish?" I repeated incredulously.
"Don't you remember what happened after our first night together?" Sean's eyes darkened with hurt. "You called it 'just a normal physiological need.' As if what we shared meant nothing."
His voice hardened as he continued, "And then you asked me for five million dollars in compensation. You turned what we had into a transaction."
"That money was an investment," I shot back defensively. "I've already returned every cent through the investment account. I don't owe you anything."
I tried to step around him toward my car, but he blocked my path.
"The money was never the issue," Sean said, frustration evident in his tone. "It was how easily you dismissed what happened between us. And then there was your confession about Christopher."
I stared at him, genuinely confused. In my recollection, Sean had been the one to call our night together "an accident," forcing me to save face by agreeing it was merely physical.
"Wasn't it you who said that night was just an accident?" I challenged, my voice steady despite my racing heart. "Those were your exact words."
Sean's expression shifted, something unreadable flickering in his eyes.
"Or are you changing your story now?" I pressed, sarcasm dripping from my words. "Should I believe you had ulterior motives all along? Even Hollywood's best screenwriters wouldn't buy that script."
"Why not?" Sean asked simply.
The question hung between us in the silent garage.
His hand moved to the nape of my neck, gentle yet firm as he drew me closer once more. I could feel his breath caressing my cheek, his lips hovering just above mine.
"Haven't you ever considered," Sean whispered, his emerald eyes gleaming dangerously in the dim light,
"that I might have wanted you all along? That night wasn't an accident, Angela. I truly wanted you."
###chapter 152: Extinguished Passion in the Parking Garage
Angela POV
Sean's voice cut through the chilly air of the parking garage, his emerald eyes darkening with a heat that made my chest tighten.
His hand slid to the back of my neck, fingers tangling in my hair as he pulled me closer, his touch soft but possessive. His breath brushed my skin, hot and heavy.
"You know what I want," he murmured, his voice dropping low, husky, vibrating through me. "It's always been you. Only you."
Before I could say a word, his lips crashed into mine, hard and hungry. He kissed me like he owned me, his tongue slipping past my lips, tasting me.
His body pinned me against the car, his chest pressing tight against mine, radiating heat that chased away the garage's cold.
Then his hand moved-sliding under my shirt, his warm palm rubbing my back. The slow, deliberate strokes made me shiver, my skin prickling under his touch.
This wasn't like the last time on the private jet, when he'd taken me fast and rough, like he couldn't wait to fuck me.
This time, even though the kiss was forceful, he didn't rush to rip my clothes off. His hand stayed gentle, tracing my spine, his fingers teasing my skin like he was savoring every second.
My knees went weak, my breath hitching as his warmth sank into me. He pulled back just enough to kiss my jaw, then my neck, his lips brushing softly before he nipped my earlobe.
"You're still so sensitive," he whispered, his voice a low growl that sent a jolt straight through me.
For a split second, my body betrayed me.
But then reality hit like a slap. I shoved him back, hard, my hands slamming into his chest.
"Let me go!" I gasped, ripping my lips from his. My voice bounced off the concrete walls.
His eyes burned with raw hunger as he stared down at me, his breathing rough. "Angela-"
The crack of my hand hitting his cheek echoed through the garage. My palm stung, and his head snapped to the side, a red mark blooming on his face. He looked stunned, but I didn't care.
"How dare you!" My voice trembled with fury, my chest heaving. "You shameless bastard!"
Sean slowly turned back to face me, one hand rising to touch the reddening mark on his cheek. Instead of anger, I saw something more dangerous in his eyes-determination, mingled with a flicker of wounded pride.
"Maybe so," he said quietly, "but every word I've said is the truth."
"The truth?" I spat, my voice still shaking. "What does that matter? Am I supposed to believe you now? Have you forgotten how you treated me before?"
I fumbled behind me for the door handle, desperate to escape his overwhelming presence.
The car door finally gave way, and I slipped inside, slamming it shut and immediately hitting the lock button.
Sean remained outside, one palm pressed against my window, his eyes never leaving mine as I started the engine.
My hands trembled on the steering wheel as I reversed, refusing to look in the rearview mirror where I knew Sean still stood, watching me drive away.
***
The water ran cold over my hands as I stood in my bathroom, furiously scrubbing at my lips for the third time.
My lips were slightly swollen, a visible reminder of what had just happened. The sight only fueled my anger and humiliation.
"Why is my heart still racing like this?" I whispered to my reflection. "It's just anger. Nothing more."
I dabbed at my face with a towel, trying to compose myself.
With one final, steadying breath, I turned away from the mirror and opened the bathroom door.
"There you are!" Olivia looked up from the children's book she was reading to the twins. "How did your investment meeting go?"
I managed a smile, hoping she couldn't see the lingering turbulence in my eyes. "Thank you so much for watching the kids tonight. Let me take you to dinner tomorrow to thank you properly."
"It's no trouble at all. The twins are always a delight."
I watched her interact with my children, a complicated guilt settling in my stomach.
Olivia had been a faithful friend these past years, always available when I needed help with the twins.
Yet I had never told her the truth about their father-about Sean. I knew of her infatuation with him, had seen the way she lit up at the mere mention of his name. Some truths were better left unspoken.
The following evening, I pushed through the crowded mall toward the indoor playground where I'd arranged to meet Olivia and the twins.
I spotted them immediately-Aria's enthusiastic bouncing as she waited for her turn on the bumper cars, Ethan's more reserved stance beside her, and Olivia's slender figure bent slightly as she captured photos on her phone.
"You made it!" Olivia called as I approached. "Was traffic bad?"
"Not terrible," I replied, setting my purse down on a nearby bench. "Just the usual midtown congestion."
She showed me the series of photos she'd taken, scrolling through images of Aria's joyful face and Ethan's rare, genuine smile.
"We haven't taken pictures together in ages," she suggested. "Should we get one now?"
I nodded, moving closer as she prepared to take a selfie. As she exited the camera app, I caught a glimpse of her WhatsApp screen-and froze.
There, at the top of her recent contacts, was a profile picture I recognized instantly. The same distinctive avatar I'd seen countless times in my online interactions with "Mr. Night."
My stomach lurched as the implication hit me.
 Olivia and Mr. Night were in contact?
How was that possible? The coincidence was too precise, too deliberate to be accidental.
I forced my expression to remain neutral as my mind raced with possibilities, each one more disturbing than the last.
Who exactly was "Mr. Night"? And what was his connection to Olivia？
###chapter 153: Mr. Night's True Identity
Angela POV
Olivia reached for her water glass as her phone lit up with a notification, briefly revealing a familiar avatar-the same stylized silhouette I'd seen in my chats with Mr. Night.
During the rest of dinner, I watched Olivia closely. She checked her phone often and smiled slightly when new messages came. Each time her phone lit up, I tried to peek at the screen to make sure I wasn't imagining what I saw before.
When Olivia excused herself to order dessert for the twins, I found my opportunity. Her phone lay unattended on the table, and before I could reconsider, I tilted my head just enough to see the notifications banner.
"That was lovely," Olivia commented as we walked toward the exit. "We should do this more often."
I took a deep breath. "Olivia, I couldn't help noticing the profile picture on your phone. The one with the black silhouette against the gray background."
Her steps faltered almost imperceptibly. "Oh? Which one?"
"In your WhatsApp messages," I pressed. "It looked familiar."
"Really?" Her voice pitched slightly higher. "It's probably just a generic avatar. You know how these messaging apps are-limited options for profile pictures."
"May I see your phone?" I asked directly.
Olivia clutched her bag closer. "What for? It's just a random contact."
"I'm curious, that's all," I insisted, maintaining a light tone despite the tension building between us.
"Angela, we should get the children to the car," she deflected. "It's getting late."
I nodded, conceding temporarily.
The parking garage was dimly lit, casting long shadows between the rows of cars. I spotted Olivia helping Ethan with his seatbelt through the rear window of my car.
"All set?" I asked, approaching them.
"Yep! They're ready to go," Olivia replied, closing the door and turning to face me.
With the children safely in the car, I took my chance. "Olivia, I need to see your phone. Please."
Her expression tightened. "Angela, why are you so interested in my contacts?"
"I'm concerned about someone who's been messaging me online," I explained, keeping my voice low so the twins couldn't hear.
"Someone who calls himself Mr. Night. He's been following my children's social media accounts, sending them money. I just want to make sure it's not the same person."
Olivia's face paled in the harsh fluorescent lighting. "I'm sure it's nothing to worry about," she said, but her voice lacked conviction.
"Then you won't mind showing me," I insisted gently. "I just want to check the profile picture."
After a long moment of hesitation, Olivia sighed in defeat.
"Fine. Here," she muttered, unlocking her phone and reluctantly handing it to me.
My hands trembled slightly as I navigated to her WhatsApp. There it was-the exact same avatar I'd been communicating with for months. I pulled out my own phone, opening my conversation with Mr. Night, and placed the two screens side by side.
"It's him," I whispered, my suspicion confirmed. "How do you know this person, Olivia? Who is he?"
Olivia shifted uncomfortably, avoiding my gaze. "We've only talked a few times. It's really nothing."
"Then why are you so nervous?" I challenged, my voice hardening. "Look, I'm not trying to pry into your personal life. But this man has been strangely interested in my children. He's donated thousands of dollars to their accounts. He even visited their school. I need to know who he is."
Olivia's eyes widened in alarm. "He went to their school?"
"Yes, Aria mentioned meeting 'Mr. Night uncle' there. He apparently introduced a new student-some distant relative of his." I studied her face intently. "Olivia, please. If you know who this person is, tell me. I'm worried about my children's safety."
Something in my plea seemed to break through her resistance. Her shoulders slumped as guilt washed over her features.
"You really don't know who he is?" she asked incredulously.
I shook my head, confusion mounting.
Olivia took a deep breath. "Angela, it's Sean Shaw. The man we met at the bar last month-the one you said was harassing you before we realized it was a misunderstanding."
The world seemed to tilt beneath my feet.
"Sean is Mr. Night?" I whispered, my voice barely audible over the distant sound of cars.
Suddenly, everything clicked into place-the generous donations, the interest in my children, the coincidental meetings. The mysterious online benefactor who had seemed to appear from nowhere after my return to New York was the same man I'd spent five years trying to leave behind.
"How..." I managed, leaning against my car for support.
"Two weeks ago, he called me after seeing a photo I posted of the twins," Olivia admitted, her words tumbling out in a rush of confession. "He asked about Aria and Ethan-their ages, where they go to school, their personalities. I thought he was just being friendly, showing interest because we'd met before."
The implications hit me like a physical blow. If Sean had been asking about the twins' ages, then he must know-or at least suspect-the truth about their parentage.
"He knows," I murmured, more to myself than to Olivia. "He knows the truth."
Olivia stepped closer, confusion etched across her face. "What truth? Angela, I'm so sorry if I've caused problems. I had no idea you were trying to keep anything from him."
"But why does he care so much about your twins?" Olivia continued to ask.
But I didn't directly answer her question.
I shook my head, trying to process this revelation. All those comments from Aria about "Mr. Night uncle" visiting their school, the new student he'd sponsored, the special attention he'd shown them-it had all been Sean, methodically inserting himself into their lives while I'd maintained the story that their father had passed away.
"Olivia," I said, struggling to keep my voice steady, "if Sean contacts you again, please don't tell him anything more about us. Not where we live, not our routines, nothing. Can you promise me that?"
She nodded solemnly. "Of course. Angela, I truly am sorry."
I managed a weak smile. "It's not your fault. You didn't know."
As I drove home that night, the twins chattering happily in the backseat about their desserts, my mind raced with implications.
Sean knew about Aria and Ethan. The secret I'd guarded for five years had been discovered.
###chapter 154: He Feels Like A Daddy Should Feel
Angela POV
My hands still trembled slightly as I guided the twins through our apartment door, the shocking revelation weighing heavily on my mind.
"Can we have hot chocolate, Mama?" Aria asked, skipping ahead to the kitchen while I set my purse down on the entryway table and hung our coats in the closet.
"Sure, sweetheart," I replied, taking a deep breath to compose myself. I couldn't let the children see how shaken I was.
I followed them into the kitchen, where Aria was already climbing onto her favorite stool. Ethan stood quietly by the counter, his observant gaze studying my face with unusual intensity.
"Mama, are you okay?" Ethan asked, his gaze unwavering.
My smile faltered momentarily. "I'm fine, sweetheart. Just thinking about some work things."
"You've been quiet since we left the mall playground," he persisted, showing that perceptiveness that sometimes caught me off guard.
Aria jumped down from her stool and tugged at my hand. "Come see what I drew today! I put it in my backpack. It's a unicorn with rainbow wings!"
As I helped her retrieve her artwork, I noticed Ethan still watching me, clearly unconvinced by my casual dismissal.
"Mama, you look worried," Aria remarked suddenly, her small face turning serious. "You shouldn't think about work now. It's after-work time!"
I laughed softly, grateful for my daughter's simple wisdom. "You're right, darling." I stroked her dark curls, then glanced between both children. "Actually, I wanted to ask you both something. Did Mr. Night visit your school during lunch today?"
The twins exchanged glances before Ethan shook his head. "No, not today."
"He came yesterday and the day before," Aria added helpfully. "He probably had work today. But his assistant came and brought us special lunches!"
My suspicions solidified instantly. Was Sean's absence from the school because of our argument in the parking garage last night? The timing seemed to fit.
"Mr. Night's so nice," Aria continued, oblivious to my churning thoughts. "I asked him if he was married or had a girlfriend."
My attention snapped fully to my daughter. "You asked him what?"
Aria grinned, unperturbed by my sharp tone. "I asked if he was single, and he said yes! Isn't that good news, Mama?"
I struggled to maintain my composure. "Aria, why would you ask him something like that?"
"Because..." Aria's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper, "I think he would make a good daddy for us."
Her innocent statement hit me like a physical blow. I sank into a kitchen chair, trying to process her words. My heart raced as a cold fear gripped me. Had Sean somehow managed to manipulate my daughter?
"Aria," I said carefully, "why would you think that about Mr. Night specifically? Christopher is nice to you too. So is Marcus from my office."
Aria wrinkled her nose. "They're different. Mr. Night feels right."
I leaned forward, my voice growing serious. "Aria, I need you to be honest with me. Did Mr. Night suggest that he could be your father? Did he tell you to think of him that way?"
"No!" Aria looked genuinely surprised by the question. "I asked him first. Right, Ethan?"
To my surprise, Ethan nodded firmly. "Mama, Ethan can confirm Aria is telling the truth. She asked him first."
I sighed, momentarily relieved yet still troubled. "Aria, you can't just ask strangers to be your father. That's not how it works."
"But he's not a stranger anymore," Aria protested. "And I like him. He feels like a daddy should feel."
"What do you mean?" I asked, my heart in my throat.
Aria shrugged, struggling to articulate her feelings. "I don't know. He's just... he feels right. Ethan likes him too."
I turned to my son, whose cheeks flushed instantly.
"N-no, I don't," Ethan stammered, avoiding my gaze. "Ethan doesn't like Mr. Night."
His denial was so transparently false that I almost smiled despite my concerns. After a moment, Ethan looked up, his expression worried.
"Mama, do you not want us to be around Mr. Night?"
The direct question caught me off guard. I hesitated, uncertain how to respond without revealing my complicated history with Sean.
"It's getting late," I said finally. "Why don't you both go get ready for bed? We can talk more tomorrow."
After tucking the twins in, I retreated to my bedroom, pulling out my phone. I opened WhatsApp and stared at Mr. Night's contact information.
I scrolled through our previous conversations, seeing them now in an entirely new light. Sean had been watching the twins' Instagram account, donating money, communicating with me through comments, all while keeping his true identity hidden.
The timeline suddenly made sense. Sean must have only recently discovered the twins' existence, likely through Olivia after my return to New York.
If he had known earlier that the Instagram twins he'd been following were his own children, he would have flown to Italy immediately.
I set my phone down, my decision made. Tomorrow at lunch, I would go to the school and confirm what I already knew in my heart to be true.
***
The next day, I pulled up to the school just as the lunch hour began. My suspicions were immediately confirmed when I spotted the familiar black Bentley parked near the entrance.
"That must be Sean's car," I murmured to myself, my knuckles whitening as I gripped the steering wheel. "I knew something was off about that vehicle. I even tried knocking on its window before. My instincts weren't wrong after all."
The security guard at the gate recognized me immediately. "Ms. Wilson, what brings you here at this hour?"
"I had some free time and thought I'd surprise the children," I replied smoothly. "May I go in?"
"Of course," the guard nodded. "There's another parent who came to have lunch with the children. Been coming regularly lately."
My pulse quickened. "Is that so?"
"Yes, very nice gentleman. I've seen your children playing with his relative quite often." The guard smiled kindly. "If you hurry, you might join them for lunch."
"I'll do that," I replied, my voice betraying none of the storm brewing inside me. As I walked toward the school building, a cold smile touched my lips.
Lunch together? That's never going to happen.
###chapter 155: My Daughter Just Fed My Ex-Husband！
Angela POV
I approached the school's high-end cafeteria, my heart beating frantically against my ribs.
From a distance, I could see Sean-Mr. Night, as the children knew him-sitting with Aria and Ethan.
The elegant lunch spread before them looked like something from a five-star restaurant, complete with artfully arranged fruit platters that I recognized as the work of a renowned pastry chef.
My daughter's cheeks were stuffed with food, her expression one of pure delight as she chewed enthusiastically. Sean sat beside her, occasionally dabbing the corner of her mouth with a pristine handkerchief. The tender gesture sent a sharp pain through my chest.
"Mr. Night, you eat too, don't worry about me," Aria said, looking slightly embarrassed by the attention.
"It's fine, I'm not hungry," Sean replied, his voice carrying that gentle tone I'd once known so well.
"But Mr. Night hasn't had lunch yet, right?" Aria persisted, looking up at him with concern.
"I'll eat later. You go ahead," Sean assured her.
I watched, frozen in place, as Aria considered this for a moment. Then, with determined concentration, she scooped up a piece of roast beef with Sean's spoon.
"Mr. Night, I'll feed you," she announced.
The shock that registered on Sean's face quickly melted into something softer, more vulnerable than I'd seen in years. He gently stroked the back of her head. "Mr. Night really isn't hungry."
"Mr. Night, come on, eat!" Aria insisted, her small arm stretching upward, struggling to reach his mouth.
My heart nearly stopped as Sean lowered his head slightly, accepting the bite she offered.
The intimacy of the moment-my daughter feeding this man who had once been my husband-made my blood run cold.
"That's enough. Aria, you should eat your food," Sean said after swallowing.
"Okay, but Mr. Night has to eat too," Aria replied firmly.
The tender look in Sean's eyes as he gazed at my daughter sent a wave of fear and rage through me that was almost paralyzing.
I stood rooted to the spot, unable to process what I was witnessing. My children had grown up in Italy, far from their father and any male influence. They had never shown such immediate affection for any man, yet in just a few days, Sean had somehow earned their trust, especially Aria's.
 The thought that he might use their growing attachment to eventually take them away from me felt like ice water in my veins.
I clenched my fists, took a deep breath, and forced myself to approach their table with measured steps.
"Mommy?" Aria's surprised voice rang out.
The smile instantly vanished from Sean's face at her words. Ethan stopped eating and looked up at me, his eyes quickly darting away-a clear sign that Sean had already begun influencing my son.
As Sean began to rise from his seat, I decided to take control of the situation.
"Mr. Night?" I said coolly.
Sean paused mid-motion, his eyes narrowing slightly, jaw muscles tightening subtly as he slowly stood and met my gaze.
"Mommy, why are you here?" Aria asked, abandoning her spoon and wiping her mouth before running over to hug my legs.
I wobbled slightly in my high heels but quickly steadied myself, drawing comfort from my daughter's familiar warmth against me.
"Ms. Wilson," Sean greeted with polite coldness, extending his hand.
I inwardly scoffed but maintained my composure, briefly accepting his handshake before quickly withdrawing my hand.
"Hello," I replied flatly.
I noticed Ethan observing my reaction carefully, his small brow furrowing with concern. The fact that he seemed worried about my interaction with Sean only heightened my anxiety.
"Aria, Ethan, what did Mommy tell you about accepting food from strangers?" I said firmly.
I caught the slight frown that crossed Sean's face at the word "strangers." Clearly, he didn't appreciate being categorized that way.
Both children remained unusually silent, another sign of Sean's troubling influence.
"I apologize, Mr. Night," I said with deliberate formality. "I understand from Aria and Ethan that you've been bringing lunch for your nephew. My children can be inconsiderate sometimes, always trying to get free food. How much do I owe you for these past few days?"
Sean's lips tightened, but he remained silent, exactly as I'd expected.
"Mommy, this is Mr. Night!" Aria interjected. "Mr. Night wouldn't charge us for lunch."
My anxiety deepened-my daughter was already taking his side.
"Mr. Night is an adult," I explained quietly. "Of course he wouldn't ask children to pay for food. But Mommy has taught you not to accept things from strangers, so naturally I should reimburse him."
I deliberately used the word "strangers" again, noting Sean's deepening displeasure. He had clearly anticipated my reaction, confirming my suspicion that his approach to my children was calculated.
"But Mommy," Aria protested, "we've already accepted lots of sponsorships from Mr. Night on Instagram. And if Mr. Night agrees to be my daddy, then he won't be a stranger anymore."
My expression froze, her innocent words piercing my heart like a blade. I watched, horrified, as Sean's lips curved into a charming smile. He gave Aria a thumbs-up.
"Aria makes an excellent point," he said smoothly.
My eyebrow twitched involuntarily, but I forced myself to remain composed for the children's sake. This wasn't a battle to be fought in front of them.
"Mr. Night, could we speak somewhere else?" I asked.
Sean raised an eyebrow. "Of course."
"Aria, Ethan," I called, noticing Tommy watching us curiously. I suspected he wasn't actually Sean's relative, but I wouldn't confront that issue now.
I managed a strained smile for all three children. "You three stay here and finish your lunch. Mommy needs to talk with Mr. Night about something. We'll be back soon."
All three nodded silently.
I turned toward the door, each step feeling like I was walking on burning coals. After a brief hesitation, I heard Sean follow, his footsteps echoing behind me.
***
Once we reached the parking lot, I stopped beside my car and turned to face Sean, who stood a few feet away, his presence as commanding as ever.
"Mr. Shaw?" I asked with bitter sarcasm. "Or should I call you Mr. Night?"
Sean pressed his lips together, his Adam's apple bobbing once-the only sign that my discovery of his identity had caught him somewhat off guard.
"Whichever you prefer," he replied with maddening casualness.
I turned away, not wanting him to see how his nonchalance affected me.
"I don't care who you are or what you want," I said coldly. "From now on, stay away from my children."
"Angela," Sean said with a soft chuckle that sent chills down my spine, "they're my children too."
His words hit me like lightning, freezing the blood in my veins.
"What do you mean, your children?" I demanded, glaring at him. "What gives you the right to say that? Do you have any proof?"
Sean looked slightly taken aback by the intensity of my reaction.
"Do I need proof?" he sighed, shaking his head. "Just look at their features. Anyone can see they're my children. Not just Ethan's eyes-Aria looks like me too."
###chapter 156: The Children Have Already Been Picked Up
Angela POV
I forced a cold laugh. "You're giving yourself too much credit. Green eyes aren't exactly rare."
"If they're not mine," Sean countered smoothly, "then whose are they?"
The question hung between us like a blade. I clenched my jaw, fury building in my chest.
"They're not yours," I hissed. "You have no right to them."
Sean stepped closer, his voice dropping to that dangerous, silky tone I remembered all too well. "Even without a DNA test, I'm certain they're my children, Angela. It's obvious they're my flesh and blood."
"We've been divorced for five years," I shot back. "You have no legal right to demand anything from my children."
"Our divorce was finalized when you were already pregnant," Sean observed, his eyes never leaving mine. "A fact you conveniently failed to mention."
I fell silent, memories flooding back-five years ago, when I had texted him about my pregnancy. His response had been nothing but silence, followed by insisting on our divorce. He clearly hadn't wanted our children. That painful rejection had sealed my decision to leave without further discussion about the pregnancy.
"I just want to fulfill my responsibilities as their father," Sean continued, his tone softening slightly. "I've missed five years of their lives already."
"That's rich," I snapped. "You didn't even know they existed until recently, and now suddenly you want to play the devoted father?"
"I acknowledge my failings," he admitted, shocking me with his candor. "But I have the resources to give them everything they deserve-the Shaw family name, the best education, opportunities beyond what you could imagine."
"We were doing perfectly fine without you," I countered, stepping back. "Don't disrupt the life we've built just because your conscience is suddenly bothering you."
Sean's expression hardened. "They're my children too, Angela. If necessary, I have an entire legal team prepared to establish my parental rights."
Something cold and primal surged through me-the fierce protective instinct of a mother. I turned away, my voice low and dangerous.
"No one will take my children," I warned. "Not even you."
Inside the school, I immediately transformed my expression, softening my features as Aria spotted me and came running.
"Mommy!" she called excitedly. "Did you talk to Mr. Night? Isn't he handsome?"
I knelt down, embracing her tightly. "Aria, sweetheart, I need you to promise me something. You can't eat the food Mr. Night brings anymore, okay?"
Her small face crumpled in confusion. "But why? His food is so yummy!"
"Because..." I hesitated, searching for words a five-year-old would understand.
"Mommy," Aria interrupted, her eyes lighting up with inspiration, "why don't you just let Mr. Night be my daddy? Then it would be okay, right?"
I froze, her innocent suggestion striking me like a physical blow.
"It sounds like an excellent proposal," Sean's smooth voice came from behind me. I hadn't even heard him approach.
I stood, positioning myself slightly in front of Aria. "Mr. Shaw," I greeted icily.
"Ms. Wilson," he nodded, then smiled warmly at my daughter. "Aria seems quite fond of me. Perhaps you should consider her suggestion seriously."
"Mr. Night," Aria tugged at his sleeve, "do you like my mommy?"
Sean crouched down to her level, his eyes twinkling with calculated charm. "I liked your mommy from the very first moment I saw her. Love at first sight, you might say."
"What's love at first sight?" Aria asked, fascinated.
"It means Mr. Night admires your mother very much," Sean explained gently.
I recognized his strategy immediately-using the children to manipulate the situation. I'd seen him deploy similar tactics in business negotiations countless times.
"Aria, Ethan," I interjected firmly, "it's time to return to class."
Ethan, who had been watching silently from a few feet away, approached cautiously. I noticed how he deliberately avoided coming too close to Sean-a stark contrast to his previously reported friendliness toward "Mr. Night." This brought me a sense of relief; my more mature Ethan always stood firmly by my side.
As Tommy prepared to follow them, he glanced uncertainly at Sean, who gave him a subtle nod of permission. The interaction confirmed my suspicions about their relationship.
With the children gone, I began mechanically gathering the elaborate lunch spread from the table.
"Don't touch that," Sean said sharply. "I've arranged for it to be taken care of."
I arched an eyebrow. "You clean up after yourself now? I thought the Shaw family was above such menial tasks."
"Tommy isn't actually my relative," Sean admitted unexpectedly. "He's from a distant branch of the Shaw family. I arranged for him to attend this school to facilitate my relationship with the twins."
The casual admission of his manipulation infuriated me. "You used an innocent child as a pawn?"
"I'm providing him with opportunities he wouldn't otherwise have," Sean countered. "His family is grateful. And it allowed me to know my children."
"They were doing perfectly fine without you," I repeated, gathering my purse. "We don't need Shaw money or Shaw opportunities. We just need peace."
Sean remained seated, watching me intently. "I've already set up education trust funds for them. It's the least I can do after missing five years."
I turned away, exhaustion suddenly weighing heavily on my shoulders. "Stay away from us, Sean. Please."
***
Back at my office, I couldn't focus on work. Files remained untouched on my desk as I stared blankly at my computer screen, mind racing with contingency plans. What if Sean pursued legal action? What rights did he have after five years of absence, even if unintentional?
By late afternoon, Marcus stopped by my office, concern etched on his face. "Angela? We need your input on the Davidson portfolio."
"Not now," I replied distractedly, gathering my belongings. "I need to pick up the children."
As I drove to the school, an unexplainable sense of dread built in my chest. The afternoon traffic seemed deliberately designed to slow my progress, each red light a personal affront.
When I finally arrived, the administrative assistant's expression immediately set off alarms.
"Ms. Wilson," she began hesitantly, "the children have already been picked up."
"What?" I gripped the counter. "By whom?"
"Their father," she replied, checking her records. "Mr. Shaw. He's on the approved list."
"I never put him on any list!" I protested, panic rising in my throat.
"I'm sorry, but he showed proper identification and legal documents. The children seemed to know him well."
Fumbling for my phone, I dialed Sean's number repeatedly, each unanswered call increasing my panic. After the sixth attempt, I made my decision.
"I'm going to the Shaw Tower," I said through clenched teeth, already heading for the door.
As I drove toward midtown, I dialed my attorney's number with trembling fingers. My hands shook with a mixture of fear and fury as I gripped the steering wheel. Sean Shaw had just declared war on the wrong mother.
###chapter 157: Welcome Home, Mrs. Shaw
Angela POV
I rushed into Shaw Tower's lobby, my heart pounding against my ribs.
Most employees had already left for the evening, with only a few security personnel still at their posts-a small mercy, as I didn't want to be recognized by former colleagues.
Sean had taken my children-our children-directly from their school, and every minute that passed only intensified my anxiety.
At least it was after hours. I wouldn't have to face curious stares from former colleagues who might recognize me. Five years had passed since I'd last walked these halls as Mrs. Sean Shaw, and I had no desire to resurrect those memories now.
"Good evening," I said to the receptionist, forcing my voice to remain steady. "I need to speak with Thomas Smith."
The young woman glanced up from her computer, offering a polite smile. "I'm sorry, ma'am, but Thomas has already left for the day."
"He's gone? What about Sean Shaw? Is he still in his office?"
Her brow furrowed slightly at my informal use of her boss's name. "Mr. Shaw hasn't been in the office this afternoon. Thomas left about ten minutes ago."
A cold knot formed in my stomach. Sean hadn't been in the office? Where had he taken my children?
I stepped away from the desk, pulling out my phone. Something felt wrong-deeply, irrevocably wrong. Sean picking up the children without warning was one thing, but disappearing with them was quite another.
Thomas answered on the third ring, his voice cautious. "Ms. Wilson?"
"I need to find Sean," I said without preamble.
"Mr. Shaw?" There was a slight hesitation in his voice. "He's not with me at the moment. Is there something urgent you need to discuss with him? Perhaps you could try his personal number?"
"I've tried. He's not answering."
"That's... unusual," Thomas replied, surprise evident in his tone.
"Do you know where he is?" I demanded.
"Well..." Thomas paused. "Mr. Shaw didn't come to the office this afternoon. I'm not entirely sure of his schedule."
A cold laugh escaped my lips. "You're his executive assistant, and you don't know his schedule? Does that make any sense to you?"
Silence stretched between us.
"Fine. If you won't tell me, I'll find him myself."
"Are you planning to go to his residence?" Thomas asked quickly. "Ms. Wilson, you should know that Mr. Shaw moved after the divorce. He no longer lives in the apartment you would remember. Would you like his new address?"
I froze. Sean had moved? The thought struck me as oddly significant. He had always been particular about his living space, curating every detail with meticulous care. Moving would have been a major decision for him.
"Yes," I replied tersely. "Text me the address."
***
The address Thomas sent brought me to one of the city's most exclusive residential buildings-a sleek glass tower in the wealthiest district. As I approached the entrance, a uniformed doorman stepped forward, blocking my path.
"Good evening, ma'am. May I help you?"
"I need to see Sean Shaw," I stated firmly.
The doorman's expression remained professionally neutral. "I'm sorry, but Mr. Shaw's residence requires pre-authorization for visitors. Do you have an appointment?"
"No, but this is urgent. I'm Angela Wilson."
Recognition flickered briefly in his eyes, but he shook his head. "I apologize, Ms. Wilson, but I cannot allow unauthorized access."
I stepped away, frustration mounting as I dialed Thomas again.
Twenty minutes later, his sleek black sedan pulled up to the curb. He emerged looking somewhat flustered, adjusting his glasses as he approached.
"Ms. Wilson, please allow me to escort you upstairs?"
"Thank you," I nodded, following him into the marble-clad lobby.
As we rode the elevator to the penthouse floor, I studied Thomas's profile. His nervousness suggested he might not be fully informed about Sean's plans regarding the children. Still, I maintained a cautious distance, unwilling to reveal too much.
The cold evening wind had tousled my dark hair during my wait outside, and I brushed it back impatiently, my thoughts focused solely on finding Aria and Ethan.
"Here we are," Thomas said as the elevator doors slid open. "The security code is 0425. I should get going now. Good evening, Ms. Wilson."
I watched him retreat into the elevator before turning to the keypad beside Sean's door. My fingers hovered over the numbers as the significance of the code hit me-04/25, my birthday.
Something twisted in my chest as I punched in the familiar digits. Even after five years of separation, Sean had kept this small piece of me in his daily life.
The door unlocked with a soft click, and as I stepped into the foyer, a melodious female voice announced, "Welcome home, Mrs. Shaw. Interior temperature has been adjusted to your preferred setting."
I froze, the automated greeting catching me completely off guard. Mrs. Shaw. A title I hadn't heard in five years, yet Sean's system still recognized me as his wife.
Shaking off the unsettling feeling, I moved deeper into the apartment. The space was immaculately designed-minimalist yet luxurious, with floor-to-ceiling windows. Despite being a completely new residence, elements of our shared past were everywhere-the particular shade of gray on the walls, the specific arrangement of furniture, even the artwork displayed in the hallway.
"Aria? Ethan?" I called out, moving swiftly through the living area. No answer.
I tried Sean's number again, listening to it ring endlessly as I searched through each room. Where had he taken them?
A sound from the master suite caught my attention-running water. I followed the noise to a closed bathroom door, my heart pounding against my ribs.
"Sean!" I pounded on the door with my fist. "Sean! Come out!"
When no response came, I knocked harder. "Where are my children? Give them back to me!"
The water shut off abruptly. Moments later, the door swung open to reveal Sean standing there, a towel wrapped around his waist, water droplets still clinging to his tanned skin. His chiseled torso and defined abdominal muscles momentarily caught my attention before I forced my gaze back to his face.
His brow furrowed as he took me in, surprise giving way to something more complex in his emerald eyes.
"What do you mean, give your children back to you?" he asked, his deep voice sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.
###chapter 158: Were They This Big? 
Angela POV
"Stop the act," I snapped, watching Sean's confused expression with growing irritation. "The school said their 'father' picked them up. Who else would they mean?"
Sean's expression shifted instantly, his casual demeanor replaced by sharp intensity. He gripped my shoulders firmly. "The children are missing?"
"Don't pretend you don't know," I tried pulling away from his grasp. "You obviously took them."
"Angela," his voice hardened, emerald eyes boring into mine, "are you saying Aria and Ethan have actually disappeared?"
Something in his reaction made me pause. The alarm in his eyes seemed genuine, not manufactured.
"They're not with you?" My certainty began to waver.
Without answering, Sean reached for his phone on the nightstand, frowning when he found it dead. "Give me your phone," he demanded, holding out his hand.
I hesitated before complying. He immediately called Thomas, his voice sharp with urgency.
"The children are missing. Check the school surveillance footage immediately. Find out who took them." He listened briefly. "No, they weren't with me. Someone claimed to be their father. Find them." He ended the call and returned my phone.
I sank onto the edge of his bed as reality hit me. "If you didn't take them, who did?"
"Do you see any signs of children here?" Sean countered, still wearing only the towel around his waist. "Why would I take them, then come home to shower?"
"But the school said their father-"
"Exactly," Sean interrupted. "It had to be someone they know and trust. Aria and Ethan wouldn't go with a stranger."
"I can't think of anyone else with a motive," I insisted, trying not to look at his bare chest.
"If I wanted to take them," Sean replied coldly, "I'd have my legal team handle everything officially."
"Then who-"
"We'll find out soon." Sean moved toward his closet. "You should know that Aria and Ethan are exceptionally intelligent. They're not easily fooled."
Despite everything, I felt a flicker of pride. "I know."
"So whoever took them must have been very convincing."
I wrapped my arms around myself. "You seem to have an idea who it might be."
A dark, humorless smirk tugged at his lips. "You'll see soon enough.Don't worry, the children should be safe right now."
Then, without warning, Sean ripped the towel from his waist, letting it drop to the floor. My breath caught as he stood there, utterly naked and unashamed.
His body was a masterpiece of raw power-broad shoulders tapering to a sculpted chest, abs carved like they'd been chiseled from stone, and those lean, muscular thighs that radiated strength.
A faint sheen of water still clung to his skin from the shower, glistening under the dim light, drawing my eyes to the sharp V of his hips and the undeniable, provocative heft below.
I spun away, heat flooding my cheeks.
"What the hell is wrong with you?" I hissed, my voice pitching higher than I meant.
"What?" he teased, his tone dripping with mock innocence. "You're the one standing there staring. Haven't you had your fill yet?"
"You're disgusting," I spat, storming toward the door.
"Isn't this what you wanted?" he called after me, his voice a deliberate, velvet taunt.
I whirled back, fury igniting my courage. "Don't flatter yourself. I've seen plenty of gorgeous, ripped Italian men over the past five years-men who'd make you look average. Why would I waste my time on you?"
A dangerous glint sparked in his eyes.
In one fluid, predatory motion, he closed the distance between us, grabbed my arm, and yanked me hard against his bare chest.
My body collided with his, and I could feel the heat radiating off him, his skin scorching against mine. His breath brushed my ear as he leaned in close, voice low and dripping with challenge.
"Is that so?"
I shoved against him, desperate for space, but he held me tighter. His free hand seized mine, guiding it down with deliberate intent until my fingers brushed the thick, pulsing heat of his cock.
"Tell me," he murmured, his lips grazing my jaw, "were they this big? Did they make you feel like this?"
My pulse roared in my ears, my body betraying me as it trembled under his touch.
"If you're done with your little show," I managed, forcing my voice to steady, "can we focus on finding our children?"
Sean released me, stepping back with a smug glint in his eye.
He dressed in silence-black shirt, jeans-each movement accentuating the lethal grace of his frame. "Let's go."
I started toward the elevator, determined to find my children on my own.
"I don't need your help."
"Angela," Sean called after me. "You won't find them without me."
Outside, a black sedan pulled up. Sean opened the passenger door.
"Get in," he commanded. "I know where they are."
"I don't need your help," I insisted, though my heart leapt at his words.
"Get in the car, Angela," Sean repeated, his voice dropping lower. "I know where our children are."
The emphasis on "our" wasn't lost on me, but all that mattered now was finding Aria and Ethan. With reluctance, I slid into the passenger seat.
###chapter 159: I'd Even Told Him He Was "Annoying"
Angela POV
The sleek black vehicle pulled away from the luxury apartment complex and merged into Manhattan traffic.
"Tell me Christopher Blake's address," Sean demanded, his jaw clenched tight at the mere mention of Christopher's name.
"Christopher?" I repeated, surprised by the question.
My mind raced as pieces began falling into place. Christopher's recent behavior, his unexpected absence after I'd rejected him, the strange timing... Could it be? I fell silent, processing the implications.
After about ten seconds of contemplation, I recited Christopher's midtown address.
Sean smirked. "You seem quite familiar with his address," he said sarcastically.
The car interior grew silent except for the soft classical music. I didn't bother arguing with Sean, too preoccupied with trying to understand why Christopher would take my children without telling me. Nothing about this made sense.
Had I been so quick to blame Sean because it was easier than considering alternatives? Christopher had been nothing but kind to me and the children for years. Yet I couldn't ignore how hurt he'd been when I rejected him last week. Still, abducting my children seemed completely out of character for him. I needed to see them with my own eyes to be certain they were safe.
Sean's phone rang, interrupting my thoughts. I kept my gaze fixed on the passing streetscape, trying to calm my racing heart.
"Did you find anything?" Sean answered sharply.
"Mr. Shaw, we retrieved the school security footage as quickly as possible," Thomas's voice came through the speaker. "I've sent it to your phone."
"Good work. Who took them?"
"You should see for yourself, sir."
Sean glanced at me briefly. "Do you want to look at my phone now, or should we wait until the next stoplight?"
I hesitated before responding, "I'll look now."
"The password is your birthday," he said matter-of-factly.
"I know."
I unlocked his phone and opened the video Thomas had sent. The security footage showed the school entrance, time-stamped from earlier that afternoon.
My heart sank as I watched Christopher approaching the front desk, speaking with the receptionist, then leaving with Aria and Ethan holding his hands.
I stared at the screen in silent confirmation. It was indeed Christopher who had taken my children without telling me. But why? Where had he taken them? And why hadn't he answered any of my calls?
The car stopped at a red light, and Sean turned toward me.
"In your eyes, am I responsible for everything bad that happens?" he asked, his voice unnervingly calm. "When the children disappeared, your first thought was that I took them."
"What else was I supposed to think?" I shot back. "You show up at their school every day, showering them with attention. Isn't your ultimate plan to take them away from me? Can you honestly deny that thought has never crossed your mind?"
"I've been trying to make amends, not to-"
"I don't want to discuss this," I interrupted, noticing the traffic signal changing. "The light's green. Drive."
We continued in tense silence. My mind replayed last week's conversation with Christopher when I'd rejected him. I had been deliberately harsh, hoping to make him give up on me.
I'd even told him he was "annoying" - words that now filled me with guilt. After all he'd done for us over the years, I'd called him "annoying" to his face.
Yet even then, he hadn't reproached me for my cruelty.
This whole situation was my fault...
Twenty minutes later, we arrived outside Christopher's midtown apartment building. I unbuckled my seatbelt and reached for the door handle before Sean had fully parked.
"You should go back," I said firmly.
Sean frowned. "What did you say?"
"I'll handle this myself. You don't need to come with me."
A cold smile crossed his lips. "Really? He took not only your children but my children as well. I'm not comfortable letting you go up there alone."
"They are my children," I snapped, anger flaring instantly. "They have nothing to do with you."
"That's not for you to decide," Sean replied, his tone flat and final.
Before I could protest further, Sean had exited the car and circled around to my side. He slipped his arm firmly around my waist and guided me toward the building entrance, cutting through the busy sidewalk traffic.
"Come on. Let's go get our son and daughter," he said, his grip unyielding.
"Let go of me, Sean! Have you lost your mind? Let go!" I struggled against his hold, earning curious glances from passersby.
"Stop making a scene," he said in a low voice. "Do you want Ethan and Aria to see us fighting?"
His words stopped me cold. The children's wellbeing had to come first.
Sean's expression softened slightly. "You're worried I'll get into a fight with Christopher in front of the kids?" Sean's voice softened slightly. "Don't worry. Although I'd love to punch him in the face right now, I won't do anything physical."
I stared at him, surprised. "How did you know that's what I was thinking?"
"Because I know you, Angela," he replied simply. "No matter how much you try to deny it."
###chapter 160: Two Men, One Family
Angela POV
My heart pounded as we stood outside Christopher's luxury apartment building.
After what felt like an eternity, the door swung open. David, Christopher's personal assistant, greeted me with a warm smile.
"Ms. Wilson." His tone was welcoming and familiar.
"David, is Christopher inside?" I asked, unable to mask the urgency in my voice.
"Mr. Blake is in the-" David's words died on his lips as his gaze shifted behind me, registering Sean's imposing presence. The friendly smile vanished instantly, replaced by a guarded expression.
I barely noticed the change, my mind entirely focused on finding my children. I pushed past David into the foyer, moving quickly across the marble floor.
Sean moved to follow, but David instinctively stepped forward to block his path.
"Sir, I'm not sure if-"
Sean's emerald eyes locked with David's, the intensity of his gaze so palpable it seemed to physically push the other man back. Without a single word spoken, David retreated, allowing Sean to enter.
The subtle aroma of polished wood and luxury enveloped me as I moved through the apartment. Then I heard it-Aria's distinctive laughter, bright and carefree, followed by a man's gentle voice.
I followed the sounds through the open glass doors leading to the terrace.
There they were.
Christopher sat in a plush outdoor chair, Aria perched on a cushioned bench beside him, her small face lit with delight. Ethan sat across from them, his posture characteristically more reserved.
The terrace table was adorned with an assortment of gourmet pastries and several expensive-looking toys.
Ethan noticed me first, his watchful eyes widening slightly. "Aria, Mama's here," he said, his voice measured and calm as always.
Aria's head whipped around, her curls bouncing as she spotted me. "Mama!" she squealed, leaping from her seat and racing toward me with outstretched arms.
I crouched down, enveloping her in a tight embrace, breathing in her familiar scent mingled with chocolate. Relief crashed over me in waves as I held her solid, warm body against mine. Ethan approached more slowly, but I reached out an arm to include him in our embrace.
"Angela, you're here," Christopher said, his voice gentle and untroubled.
I examined Aria's face, noting the chocolate smeared around her mouth. "Look at you," I said, attempting a light tone despite my still-pounding heart. "Eating like this, are you a little piggy?"
"Aria is not a little piggy!" she protested indignantly. "Piggies aren't pretty!"
Christopher approached us, his movements fluid and graceful as always.
"I'm sorry," he began, his tone genuinely apologetic. "I was passing by the school today and missed Ethan and Aria, so I decided to pick them up for a little while. I forgot to let you know. I hope I didn't cause you any trouble."
Before I could respond, Sean's voice cut through the air from behind me. "Not trouble-just hours of frantic searching."
I shot Sean a warning glance, silently pleading with him not to escalate the situation in front of the children. Christopher's expression flickered momentarily-a brief shadow crossing his features-before his composed mask returned.
"You were searching for that long?" Christopher's voice remained level. "I apologize for my oversight. It was truly careless of me."
"It's fine," I interjected quickly. "These things happen."
Christopher's gaze lingered on me before shifting to Sean, then back to me. "You haven't had dinner yet, have you? Why not stay and join us?"
"No need," I replied, forcing a smile. "I've already arranged food at home. Everything would go to waste if we stayed. Perhaps another time."
"Very well," Christopher nodded. "Let me have David drive you home, then."
"That won't be necessary," Sean interjected immediately, his tone brooking no argument. "I'll take them myself."
Christopher's eyes hardened as they met Sean's. "I wasn't asking you. I was asking Angela."
The tension between them was palpable, like static electricity charging the air. I stepped forward, placing myself subtly between them.
"Really, it's fine," I assured Christopher. "I can manage."
Christopher conceded with a graceful nod. "If you're sure. Be safe, and call me if you need anything."
"I will," I promised, already gathering the children's belongings.
As we prepared to leave, Christopher disappeared briefly, returning with two elegant gift bags. "These are for Aria and Ethan," he said, extending them toward me.
"No, I-" I began to refuse.
"Please," he insisted gently. "Aria has already accepted hers."
I glanced at my daughter, who was indeed clutching a small stuffed unicorn that hadn't been in her possession earlier. With a resigned nod, I accepted the bags.
As I took Aria's hand, preparing to leave, Sean unexpectedly bent down and scooped Ethan into his arms. The boy looked startled but didn't protest. For a moment, something passed between them-a look, a feeling-that made my heart constrict.
Christopher stood motionless on his terrace as we left, his expression carefully blank.
As I looked back at his solitary figure watching us leave, a storm of emotions churned within me.
Anger rose first - how could he take my children without telling me? - followed quickly by guilt for how harshly I'd treated him last week. Yet beneath these feelings lurked something else: fear.
If Christopher, who had always been so dependable, could do this... would it happen again?
 Would someone else try to take my children next time?
 The thought sent a chill through me as Sean and I carried my children away.
###chapter 161: He Can Sing Disney Songs?
Angela POV
I stepped out of Christopher's luxury apartment building, Aria nestled securely in my arms. Despite her small size, she felt heavier than usual-or perhaps it was the weight of my conflicting emotions that made my steps slower.
Sean walked beside me, carrying Ethan with surprising gentleness.
"Thank you for helping me find the children," I said, breaking the tense silence. "But we can manage from here."
Sean raised an eyebrow. "This late? How do you plan to get home?"
"I'll call an Uber," I replied firmly. "You can put Ethan down. We'll be fine on our own."
With visible reluctance, Sean lowered Ethan to the ground. The boy immediately stepped closer to me, his small hand finding mine. Yet I couldn't miss how his eyes lingered on Sean's face, studying him with that intense, calculating gaze so unusual for a child his age.
"Mama, why did we leave Christopher uncle's house?" Aria mumbled sleepily against my shoulder.
"Because it's late, sweetheart," I answered softly. "Time to go home and get some sleep."
I turned to Sean with forced politeness. "Thank you again. Goodnight."
"Angela," Sean called after me as I began walking away. "Don't be stubborn. It's too late. Let me drive you home."
I pretended not to hear, guiding the children toward the street corner to hail a taxi. The sidewalk was mostly empty at this hour, with only a few late-night pedestrians hurrying past.
A figure emerged suddenly from the shadows between two buildings, blocking our path. My instincts flared with alarm as I registered his disheveled appearance-torn jacket, unshaven face, the unmistakable odor of alcohol.
"Hey, beautiful," the man slurred, swaying slightly. "Spare some cash? I haven't eaten in three days."
I tightened my grip on Aria and pulled Ethan closer to my side. Not wanting to appear callous in front of my children, I reached into my purse and extracted a hundred-dollar bill.
"Here," I offered, extending the money.
His bloodshot eyes caught sight of the other bills in my wallet, and his expression shifted from desperate to predatory. "That's not enough. Give me everything you've got."
My heart hammered against my ribs. "No, I can't. We need money to get home."
"I'm not asking twice," he growled, stepping closer.
I pushed both children behind me, my hands trembling as I prepared to surrender my wallet. Their safety was all that mattered.
"Stay away from her."
Sean's voice cut through the tension like a blade. In one fluid motion, he grabbed the man's wrist and shoved him backward with enough force to make him stumble.
The man regained his balance and lunged forward, but Sean was faster. His fist connected with the man's jaw in a sickening crack that sent him sprawling onto the pavement.
"Leave," Sean commanded, his voice dangerously calm. "Now."
The man scrambled to his feet and disappeared into the darkness, casting one final glare over his shoulder.
I quickly covered the children's eyes, not wanting them to witness such violence. But when I removed my hands, I was stunned to see excitement rather than fear on their faces.
Ethan's eyes were wide with undisguised admiration as he stared up at Sean. Aria clapped her tiny hands in delight.
"Mr. Night is like a knight from cartoons, rescuing the princess!" she exclaimed.
I felt a chill run through me. How could they find such violence exciting?
Sean approached us, straightening his jacket. "Now do you understand why I didn't want you leaving alone?"
"It was just an unfortunate incident," I replied, my voice still unsteady.
"In this city, with two children, you never know what might happen." His tone softened slightly. "Please, let me drive you home."
I glanced at the children's expectant faces and sighed in defeat. "Fine. Just this once."
***
The interior of Sean's luxury car enveloped us in silence. Aria had recovered her energy and was bouncing slightly in her seat, while Ethan remained unusually quiet, his eyes frequently finding Sean in the rearview mirror.
"Would you like some music?" Sean asked unexpectedly as he started the engine.
"Can we hear songs from Frozen?" Aria piped up before I could respond.
I was about to say it wasn't necessary when Sean's fingers were already tapping the car's touchscreen. The opening notes of "Let It Go" filled the space between us, and Aria immediately began singing along, knowing every word by heart.
To my absolute astonishment, Sean started humming along under his breath, occasionally murmuring a line or two.
He caught my stunned expression and shrugged nonchalantly. "What? It's a good song."
I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. In all our years together, Sean had always been the epitome of corporate coldness-calculated, controlled, unyielding. This playful side was entirely foreign to me.
Had he actually watched animated children's movies?
The thought of Sean Shaw, ruthless CEO of Shaw Group, sitting through Disney films was so incongruous I almost laughed.
The contrast with his earlier behavior-practically strong-arming Christopher to take the children-couldn't have been more stark.
As the song continued, I noticed Ethan softly joining in, despite his typically reserved nature. Sean's eyes met mine in the rearview mirror, and I quickly looked away, though I felt some of the tension drain from my shoulders.
"What do the children like for breakfast?" Sean asked quietly. "I could bring something over tomorrow morning."
My guard instantly went back up. "Who said you're coming over tomorrow?"
When we finally arrived at my building, Aria was still humming contentedly.
"Thank you for driving us home, Mr. Night," she said with genuine warmth. "You sing so well!"
Sean smiled at her through the mirror. "When I become your father, we can sing together every day."
I froze in my seat, shock and anger coursing through me at his audacity.
"Sweetheart," I said loudly, "Mommy can sing with you every day too. He wasn't singing well at all-he was completely off-key!"
Sean's expression darkened. "Which part was off-key, exactly?"
I ignored him and gathered the children to exit the car. As I moved past Sean, his hand suddenly caught my wrist, his breath warm against my ear.
"You think this will make me back off?" he whispered. "Don't dream, Angela."
An involuntary shiver ran down my spine at his proximity. He released me with a gentle push toward the building entrance. "Go on. Goodnight."
"Goodbye, Mr. Night!" the children called out cheerfully.
"See you tomorrow," Sean replied with a smile. "I'll pick you up for school."
I didn't respond, just hurried the children inside, feeling Sean's eyes on my back the entire time. He remained standing by his car, a dark silhouette in the night, until the building doors closed behind us.
Christopher and Sean. Two men seemingly competing to be father to my children. How could I keep them from disrupting the life I'd carefully built?
Inside our apartment, I immediately went to the window after turning on the lights. Carefully pulling back the curtain, I peered down at the street, releasing a sigh of relief only when I saw Sean's car finally driving away.
"Mama, what are you looking at?"
Aria's voice startled me. I hadn't heard her approach.
"Nothing, baby," I said quickly, letting the curtain fall back into place.
Her innocent eyes studied my face. "Are you sad because Mr. Night is leaving? Do you miss him already?"
###chapter 162: The Last Thing I Need in My Life is Sex
Angela POV
"Mommy."
Aria's voice startled me out of my thoughts. I turned to find her standing in the middle of our living room, her small face scrunched up in curiosity.
"Who taught you to say those things earlier?" I asked, moving away from the window.
She tilted her head, dark curls bouncing. "Nobody taught Aria, Mommy. It was Aria's own thinking. Mommy came home and went straight to the window to peek. Weren't you looking for Mr. Night?"
My cheeks warmed. "No, I was just closing the curtains."
"But I saw you open them a little bit to look outside," she insisted, her innocent eyes watching me carefully.
I sighed, running a hand through my hair. "Aria, why are you contradicting me so much lately?"
"Mommy, Aria is just telling the truth," she replied with that childish logic that was impossible to argue with.
I knelt down to her level, meeting her eyes. "Aria, can you promise me something?"
Her eyes brightened. "What is it, Mommy?"
"When we're with Mr. Night, whatever I say is final. You can't contradict me in front of him, okay?"
Aria's expression changed to something more thoughtful than a five-year-old should be capable of. "Mommy, do you not like Mr. Night?"
"No, I don't," I answered firmly.
"Then... do you hate Mr. Night?"
I paused, choosing my words carefully. "Aria, there's a difference between not liking someone and hating them. Not liking means you don't want to spend time with that person, but hating means you feel very strong negative feelings toward them."
Aria absorbed this distinction with surprising focus. "Then play with Mr. Night, Mommy. He's really nice."
Exhaustion suddenly weighed on me. "Aria, why don't you go to your room for now? I'll call you when dinner's ready."
"So Mommy agrees to play with Mr. Night?" she asked hopefully.
"We'll see about that later."
"Okay!" With that simple acceptance, she skipped off to her room, content with my non-committal answer.
Later that night, after tucking both children into bed, I slipped under my own covers, desperately seeking sleep.
Instead, unbidden images of Sean filled my mind-Sean standing in his penthouse bathroom doorway, water droplets still clinging to his bare chest, the towel loosely wrapped around his waist.
Then my treacherous mind removed even that minimal covering, reconstructing his naked form with disturbing accuracy.
I turned over, burying my face in the pillow. What was wrong with me? For five years, I'd focused entirely on the twins and building my career. I hadn't thought about men or sex-there simply wasn't time or energy for such distractions. Yet now, with Sean back in my life, my body seemed to be reminding me of long-ignored needs.
"Stop it," I muttered to myself in the darkness. "I have two children to raise and a company to run. The last thing I need in my life is sex."
***
The next morning, I deliberately woke the children earlier than usual, hoping to avoid Sean by leaving before he arrived. We hurried through our morning routine, and I rushed them down to the lobby.
"Ms. Wilson, good morning."
Thomas Smith's polite greeting stopped me in my tracks. He stood near the entrance, and behind him, leaning against a sleek black car, was Sean.
"Ms. Wilson, I didn't expect you to come down so early," Thomas continued. "On our way here, I told Mr. Shaw we didn't need to arrive this early, but he insisted you would try to leave early. It seems Mr. Shaw knows you quite well."
I pressed my lips together, irritated that Sean had predicted my actions so accurately.
"Mr. Night!" Aria's excited cry echoed through the lobby as she broke free from my grasp and ran toward Sean. He crouched down, opening his arms to catch her as she launched herself at him.
Ethan remained by my side, watching the interaction with cautious eyes.
"Ms. Wilson, you and the children must not have had breakfast yet, coming down this early," Thomas observed.
Sean straightened, still holding Aria. "Let's go get breakfast."
I hesitated, looking for any excuse to decline.
"Ethan, come on," Sean said, extending his hand toward my son.
Ethan glanced up at me, uncertainty written across his features. He clearly wanted to go but was waiting for my permission.
"Mommy, Ethan, hurry up!" Aria called from the car where Sean had already secured her in a booster seat.
I placed a gentle hand on Ethan's shoulder. "Go ahead."
When he still hesitated, I added, "Your sister's already in the car. What are you worried about? We can't leave her alone."
Ethan nodded and walked toward the car, climbing in beside his sister while I reluctantly followed.
After a tense breakfast at an upscale café, we arrived at the children's school.
Aria hugged Sean goodbye with the same enthusiasm she'd shown earlier, while Ethan offered a more reserved farewell.
I watched them enter the building before turning back to find Sean studying me.
"Let me drive you to your office," he offered.
"That's not necessary," I replied coolly.
Sean raised an eyebrow. "You didn't drive here. Are you planning to walk to work?"
"How I get to work is none of your concern."
"Are you sure you don't want a ride?"
"Quite sure."
Thomas approached cautiously. "Mr. Shaw, there are several matters at the office requiring your attention..."
I turned away, already walking in the direction of the subway station.
"Ms. Wilson is heading toward the subway," I heard Thomas observe behind me.
"I can see that," Sean replied.
"Mr. Shaw," Thomas continued hesitantly, "since Ms. Wilson is going to the subway, perhaps we should return to the office? There are many urgent matters waiting-"
"Take me to the office," Sean cut him off.
###chapter 163: He Didn't Show Up At The Engagement Party
Angela POV
I quickened my pace as I entered the subway station, unable to resist glancing over my shoulder to check if Sean had followed me.
The morning crowd provided welcome camouflage as I scanned the entrance.
Nothing.
No sign of his tall figure or those penetrating green eyes.
A sigh of relief escaped my lips.
Disappointment? I shook my head, annoyed at my own traitorous feelings.
What was wrong with me? This was exactly what I wanted-Sean Shaw out of my sight.
I purchased my ticket and descended to the platform, pushing aside those conflicting emotions with practiced efficiency.
***
Hours later, I sat in my office , staring blankly at spreadsheets that should have commanded my full attention.
"Angela? Angela?"
I blinked, suddenly aware that everyone at the conference table was staring at me.
"I'm sorry," I said, straightening in my chair. "Could you repeat that?"
The meeting continued, but my focus remained elusive. I nodded mechanically at appropriate intervals, contributed the minimum required comments, and exhaled with relief when it finally concluded.
As I gathered my papers to leave, Marcus appeared at my side, concern evident in his expression.
"Angela, got a minute?" he asked, following me into the hallway.
"What is it?" I replied, not slowing my pace.
"You seem off these past couple days. Everything okay?"
I brushed past him. "I'm fine."
"Did something happen?" he persisted, easily keeping stride with me. "Want to talk about it?"
I stopped abruptly, turning to face him. "Not interested. If I told you, the entire company would know by tomorrow morning."
Marcus's expression shifted from concern to wounded dignity. "That's not fair. I may enjoy office gossip, but I know how to keep secrets. Look at our company-barely anyone knows about your history with Mr. Shaw, right?"
His words gave me pause. Despite his chatty nature, Marcus had indeed kept my connection to Sean remarkably quiet. Perhaps he was more trustworthy than I'd given him credit for.
I hesitated, then gestured toward my office. Once inside with the door closed, I leaned against my desk, arms crossed defensively.
"So what's really going on?" Marcus asked, settling into a chair.
I remained silent, unsure where to begin or how much to reveal.
"Is it about your ex-husband wanting to take the children?" Marcus ventured.
My head snapped up. "How did you-"
"Educated guess," he replied with a shrug. "Don't forget, I'm a married man too. If I were in his situation, I'd probably want my children back as well. But why assume he wants to take them rather than co-parent?"
"Co-parent?" I scoffed. "That's impossible."
"Why? There must be a reason."
I looked away, unwilling to explain the complicated truth.
Marcus leaned forward. "Your ex-husband is influential, right? Has resources, status. Wouldn't his involvement benefit Aria and Ethan?"
"Help raise them?" I shook my head vehemently. "No. He just wants to take them away. He has a girlfriend anyway-all this co-parenting talk is just a façade. He wants my children."
"Girlfriend?" Marcus caught the word immediately. "Angela, are you worried he'll have another woman become a stepmother to your children? Is that it?"
My expression must have confirmed his suspicion, because his face softened into a knowing smile.
"If that's your concern, I can tell you it's completely unfounded."
"What do you mean?" I asked, trying to hide my sudden interest.
"Not to defend Mr. Shaw, but in the five years you've been gone, he hasn't had any stable relationships. Even Christina Jordan, his supposed 'savior' that everyone thought was a sure thing-they never ended up together."
I froze. Sean and Christina weren't together?
But that made no sense. He'd demanded our divorce, had even implied I should terminate my pregnancy when I texted him about it. Wasn't that all so he could be with Christina?
"Shortly after you left Shaw Group," Marcus continued, seemingly oblivious to my internal turmoil, "rumors flew that Sean and the Jordan heiress were getting engaged. Everyone knew Christina had saved Sean's life in that yacht accident, so their engagement seemed inevitable. Many believed Sean's marriage to you was just to help Wilson Bank through its crisis, and that Christina would take your place once she returned to New York."
I maintained a carefully neutral expression.
"We all thought that," Marcus said. "Especially when engagement announcements started circulating. The date was set, invitations sent-some socialites even posted photos of them online. Reporters camped outside Shaw Tower for comments." He paused dramatically. "Then Shaw Group's PR department declared it all a rumor."
"Did Sean make the statement himself?" I asked, my voice unnaturally steady.
"No, just PR, but that's essentially Sean's voice, isn't it?"
Marcus leaned closer. "Christina orchestrated the whole thing to force Sean's hand. If he didn't show up at the engagement party, she'd lose face. If he wanted to protect her reputation, he'd have to marry her."
"Sounds like pressure tactics," I observed, "but where did she get the confidence?"
Privately, I wondered: Hadn't Sean himself given her that confidence? His refusal to personally deny the rumors could have been to save her face, but it also gave Christina hope. She recognized his gratitude for saving his life and took a calculated risk.
"You're right," Marcus nodded. "But Sean owed her a debt, and the Shaws care deeply about honor. The Jordan family has leveraged that 'life debt' to climb the social ladder for years. Being someone's savior creates powerful obligations. I might have felt compelled to attend that engagement party myself. But Mr. Shaw-" Marcus shook his head admiringly,
 "-he didn't show up."
Though I'd guessed the outcome, hearing the confirmation made my heart skip a beat.
###chapter 164: Why Did You Two Divorce in the First Place
Angela POV
"He didn't go?" My voice sounded strange to my own ears, barely audible yet somehow too loud in the quiet of my office.
Marcus leaned forward, clearly relishing his role as information broker. "No, he didn't. Sean Shaw never showed up at his own engagement party with Christina Jordan."
I forced my expression to remain neutral, though I felt anything but composed. "Then what happened?"
"At first, Wall Street insiders were speculating wildly. According to my media friends who were there, the venue was decorated extravagantly." Marcus's eyes gleamed with the thrill of sharing insider knowledge. "But no photos were published. Anyone who tried would have lost their job immediately. The story was completely suppressed."
"Then how do you know all this?" I asked, working to keep my voice steady.
"I was working at Shaw Group back then," Marcus replied with undisguised pride. "I was actually at the engagement party! You should have seen Christina Jordan's devastated expression. She was still holding her bouquet, looking utterly abandoned. It was quite the spectacle."
"You were there? You really are incredibly nosy." I deflected, uncomfortable with how this information was affecting me.
Marcus shrugged, unperturbed by my comment. "My point is, I don't think your assumption about Mr. Shaw having a girlfriend is accurate. In all these years, he hasn't had any stable female companions." He paused, studying my face carefully.
"Perhaps he genuinely just wants to help raise the children? Or maybe... Angela, why did you two divorce in the first place? Is it possible there was some misunderstanding between you?"
"That's enough," I cut him off, my voice turning to ice. "Whether there was a misunderstanding or not, I know exactly what happened."
Marcus retreated slightly, recognizing he'd crossed a line. As he left my office, I turned to the window, my mind racing.
Sean hadn't attended the engagement party with Christina? That contradicted everything I'd believed for five years.
Yet just last month at the charity auction, I'd seen them together, her red lips whispering in his ear, her arm linked through his.
What was I even thinking? Why should I care about Sean's relationships? The only thing that mattered was protecting my children from his sudden interest in claiming them.
I tried to focus on work, but Marcus's words kept echoing in my mind.
Is it possible there was some misunderstanding between you?
***
The afternoon dragged by in a haze of meetings and phone calls, none of which I could fully concentrate on. As evening approached, my phone chimed with a message from Sean. My stomach dropped as I read it:
Sean: "I had no important business at the company today, so I left early and picked up the children from school. I've taken them home to play. You can come directly here after work."
My fingers trembled as I typed back:
Me: "I do not agree."
Sean: "What don't you agree with?"
Me: "I don't agree with you taking my children to your home. Please respect my wishes."
I gripped the phone tighter, tension building in my chest with each passing second.
Sean: "Angela, do I need to remind you? Aria and Ethan are my children too."
Me: "No reminder needed. They're the children I raised. I know exactly whose children they are, and they're certainly not yours."
I stood abruptly, as if preparing for physical confrontation, though Sean was miles away.
Sean: "Is that so? Then perhaps I should take them for a paternity test?"
The threat sent ice through my veins. Every word he typed was a calculated move in a game where my children were the prize.
Me: "Just don't take my children away."
I hated how my words read like a plea rather than a command. I despised this feeling of powerlessness.
Sean: "We're already in the car, heading home."
Sean: "If you're planning to call, remember to control your emotions. The children are with me."
My hand shook as I set down the phone. He had outmaneuvered me completely. I couldn't even express my anger over the phone because the children would hear. Each time I reread his threat about paternity testing, my stomach clenched painfully.
I grabbed my coat and purse, heading for the door. "I'm leaving early today," I called to my assistant as I rushed past.
In the elevator, I leaned against the wall, trying to steady my breathing. Sean had taken my children without permission. He was asserting control over the situation, over them-over me.
As the elevator descended, a cold determination settled in my chest.
If this was how it would be-Sean making unilateral decisions about my children, threatening paternity tests, gradually inserting himself into their lives-then I needed to take more drastic measures.
Perhaps it was time to consider returning to Europe permanently. I could take the children back to Italy, away from Sean Shaw and his machinations.
###chapter 165: Interests Can Be Inherited Too
Sean POV
The elevator doors opened, and I guided Aria and Ethan into my penthouse. Watching their small faces as they took in the expansive space filled me with an unfamiliar nervousness.
I'd closed multibillion-dollar deals with less anxiety than I felt introducing my children to my home.
"Welcome," I said, ushering them inside. "I hope you like it here."
Aria's eyes widened as she spun around, taking in the floor-to-ceiling windows and the impressive city view. Ethan remained close to her, his expression carefully guarded.
Thomas appeared from the kitchen, bowing slightly. "Everything is prepared, Mr. Shaw."
"Thank you, Thomas. That will be all for now."
After he left, I crouched down to the children's level. "I've arranged for a special dinner tonight," I told them. "But first, I thought we might have some fun."
I led them down the hallway to what had once been a home office. The door slid open to reveal a room transformed-filled wall-to-wall with toys, games, and electronics. I'd instructed my assistant to purchase everything a five-year-old might possibly desire, cost irrelevant.
Both children froze in the doorway, their expressions a mixture of disbelief and awe.
"Mr. Night..." Aria whispered, her voice tiny with uncertainty. "Are all these things for Aria and Ethan?"
"Of course," I replied, resting my hand lightly on her shoulder. "I want to become your father, so I need to do better. This is just the beginning. Go ahead, see if you like anything."
I gently guided them into the room, then stepped back to observe their reactions. This was uncharted territory for me-no business strategy or financial model could prepare me for winning over my own children.
Aria tugged at her brother's sleeve. "Ethan, can we play with these things?"
Ethan hesitated, his eyes scanning the room cautiously. "Let's just look for now. Try not to touch anything."
"Why not?" Aria's face scrunched in confusion. "Didn't Mr. Night buy them for us?"
"He did," Ethan conceded, his voice dropping to a near whisper. "But Mr. Night isn't our father yet."
His words struck me like a physical blow. For a moment, all my power and control meant nothing in the face of this small boy's hesitation. I maintained my composed exterior, but inside, his reluctance to accept me cut deeper than I'd expected.
Aria, unswayed by her brother's caution, broke away and made a beeline for a large box containing an intricate Boeing 787 model airplane. Before Ethan could intervene, she had already torn open the packaging with childish enthusiasm.
I approached quietly, watching as her small fingers began sorting through the pieces.
"You like this one?" I asked, kneeling beside her.
Aria nodded vigorously. "Yes! Aria's dream is to become a pilot when she grows up."
"That's a very cool dream," I replied, unable to contain my surprise-and a sudden, overwhelming surge of pride.
In college, I'd obtained my pilot's license, still flying my private jet whenever time allowed. The coincidence felt like confirmation of our shared blood, a genetic thread connecting us despite the years of separation.
Aria thrust out her chest proudly, then suddenly deflated. "But Mr. Night, some kids at school say girls can't easily become pilots."
"Who told you that?" I asked, keeping my voice gentle despite the instant flare of protectiveness. "Don't listen to outdated ideas. If you love it and work hard for it, I'll support you completely. There are so many female leaders in the world-the sky should be no different." I paused, then added, "Actually, I have a pilot's license myself. If you're really interested, I could teach you quite a bit."
"Really?" Her eyes widened. "You can fly planes?"
"Absolutely. Private jets and helicopters both."
"That's amazing!" Aria clapped her hands together. "Aria will work even harder then!"
"Of course," I promised. "I'll take you to the airport sometime. You can sit in the cockpit, see how everything works. Maybe even meet some female pilots."
As Aria turned her attention back to the model with renewed enthusiasm, I felt a warmth spreading through my chest. This small connection, so unexpected yet so perfect, felt like a gift.
I turned my attention to Ethan, who stood slightly apart, watching us.
"What about you, Ethan?" I asked.
He startled slightly. "What?"
"Your sister dreams of becoming a pilot. What's your dream?"
Ethan looked away, fingering the cuff of his custom-tailored shirt-one I'd had specially made for him. "I haven't decided yet."
I studied him, noting the way he avoided my gaze. "Is that the truth, or you just don't want to tell me? You seem to be keeping your guard up around me."
"No, I'm not," he denied quickly, but his body language told a different story.
I wondered if he somehow sensed the truth about Angela and me, if he understood more than his five years should allow. Winning his trust, I realized, would be more challenging than any negotiation I'd ever undertaken.
The doorbell's sudden chime cut through the moment. I stood, straightening my suit jacket.
"That might be your mother," I told Ethan. "I'll get the door."
The doorbell rang again, insistently. I frowned, puzzled. Angela had access codes to my apartment; the security system would recognize her automatically. Perhaps she was deliberately ringing the bell to express her displeasure-it would be characteristic of her.
I swung the door open, already speaking: "You clearly have access, why would you-"
The words died in my throat. Christina Jordan stood in the hallway, flanked by Evan White and William West-not Angela at all.
Christina lunged forward for an embrace, her overpowering perfume invading my space. I stepped back instinctively, avoiding her touch. I didn't want the children smelling her perfume on me.
"Sean..." she said, her expression falling at my retreat.
I surveyed the three of them coldly, my gaze finally settling on Evan, the only one I still marginally respected.
"What are you doing here?" I asked sharply, acutely aware of the children just rooms away. These people were the last complication I needed right now.
William stepped forward, hands spread wide. "What do you mean, 'what are we doing here'? It's my birthday, remember? You promised to come to my party. We've been calling you for hours, man. Got worried when you didn't answer."
I silently cursed myself for forgetting. My mind raced, calculating how quickly I could send them away before they disrupted what precious time I had with my children.
###chapter 166: Unwanted Visitors
Sean POV
I stood in the doorway, deliberately blocking their view into my apartment. William continued to plead his case, oblivious to my mounting irritation.
"Christina's been missing you," he said, gesturing toward her. "She's called you what, twenty times this week? You can't be that busy that you can't pick up for her."
I stood in the doorway, deliberately blocking their view into my apartment while silently cursing myself for forgetting about William's birthday. My mind had been entirely occupied with the children-with my children.
"Christina's been missing you," William continued, oblivious to my mounting irritation. "She's called you what, twenty times this week? You can't be that busy that you can't pick up for her."
I remained silent, deliberately ignoring his comment. William had always lacked social boundaries, saying whatever crossed his mind without filter. It was simultaneously his most endearing and most infuriating quality.
I noticed Evan shooting William a warning glance. Of my friends, Evan had always been the most perceptive, the one who could read my moods before I voiced them. The one who dared speak truth to me when others wouldn't.
"Happy birthday," I finally responded, my tone making it clear our conversation was ending. "I'll send a gift tomorrow. If there's nothing else, you should get back to your party."
I began to push the door closed, only to find William's hand suddenly bracing against it.
"Seriously?" he protested, eyebrows shooting up in disbelief. "That's it? I paused my entire birthday celebration, drove all the way across town because we were worried about you, and you're just going to close the door in our faces?"
I felt a vein throb in my forehead, my patience rapidly evaporating. "I'm busy today. We'll catch up another time. I'll prepare a special birthday gift to make it up to you. Go back and continue your party-I'll cover all the expenses."
My thoughts raced to the two small occupants waiting for me inside-particularly to Aria, who was probably wondering why I'd disappeared. And worse, Angela would be arriving soon to collect them. If she encountered Christina and the others, it would create exactly the kind of complicated scene I'd been meticulously avoiding.
"Busy?" William scoffed. "Too busy for friends? What happened to you, man? Do you even consider us friends anymore?"
Christina's eyes glistened with unshed tears, her voice softening to that wounded tone she'd perfected over years of practice. "Sean, we just wanted to check on you..."
I shot Evan a sharp look, silently pleading for him to intervene. He understood my boundaries better than the others, respected them more. But before he could speak, a small voice cut through the tension from behind me.
"Uncle Night, did someone come to visit?"
My heart froze. I turned to see Aria standing at the base of the stairs, wearing the pale blue dress I'd purchased for her, one small hand clutching the model airplane we'd been assembling. With her fair skin, those dark curls that mirrored my own, and eyes bright with curiosity, she stood like a miniature revelation.
The silence that followed was deafening. I watched as three pairs of eyes shifted from me to the child, their expressions morphing from surprise to shock to swift calculation.
Christina's face transformed as she took in Aria's features-features that undeniably echoed my own.
"Sean," Christina managed, her voice almost trembling, "who is this?"
Before I could answer, William blurted out what everyone was thinking: "That kid looks just like you. Is she your daughter?"
I felt my jaw tighten. This wasn't how I'd planned for any of this to unfold. Angela and the children hadn't fully accepted me yet, and I wasn't ready to navigate the complex social aftermath of acknowledging my children publicly.
Christina forced a brittle laugh. "Don't be ridiculous. Obviously some woman is trying to take advantage of Sean's position. You know how these things work-they target wealthy men, claiming their children are related."
The insinuation against Aria's legitimacy-against Angela-sent a surge of cold fury through me. I narrowed my eyes at Christina, but she was too busy staring at Aria with barely disguised resentment to notice.
I glanced at Aria, who stood composed under their scrutiny. Even at five years old, she carried herself with a dignity that made my chest swell with pride despite the circumstances.
"This is none of your concern," I stated flatly. "I'm asking you all to leave. Now. Before I lose my patience."
William, ever oblivious to danger signals, stepped forward. "Come on, just let us in for a minute. We want to understand what's-"
My control snapped. I grabbed William's custom-tailored collar and physically propelled him backward, through the doorway and into the hallway.
"Get out!" I growled, the force of my anger surprising even me. I hadn't intended to resort to physical confrontation, especially not with Aria watching, but William had pushed past my final boundary.
He stumbled, landing ungracefully on the hallway carpet, his expression stunned. Christina froze in shock, her mouth forming a perfect 'O' of surprise at my outburst.
And then, as if the moment needed one final complication, the elevator doors at the end of the hall slid open.
Angela stepped out, her amber eyes immediately taking in the chaotic scene before her-William sprawled on the floor, Christina and Evan standing stunned in the hallway, and me, still holding the door, with Aria visible just behind me.
The perfect storm I'd been trying to avoid had arrived.
###chapter 167: This Woman Abandoned you!
Angela POV
The elevator doors slid open silently, revealing the elegant hallway that led to Sean's penthouse. I stepped out and immediately froze at the unexpected tableau before me.
William West lay sprawled on the plush hallway carpet, his expression stunned as he struggled to right himself. Christina Jordan stood nearby, her hand covering her mouth in shock. Evan White stood slightly apart, watching the scene with his usual calculated reserve.
And there was Sean, standing in his doorway, one hand still gripping the handle, his normally composed demeanor cracked by obvious anger.
My heart rate accelerated instantly. My children were inside that apartment, and Christina Jordan was here！
The woman who had once offered me three million dollars to terminate my pregnancy was mere steps away from meeting those same children I had protected from her. The thought sent ice through my veins.
I moved forward, ignoring the chaos. Getting to Aria and Ethan was my only priority.
Christina noticed me first.
Her eyes widened, recognition flickering across her features like lightning.
The shock on her face quickly transformed into something harder, more calculating.
I recognized that look-the rapid assessment of a potential rival, the mental tallying of strengths and vulnerabilities.
Evan's eyes met mine next, a flash of understanding passing between us. Unlike the others, he seemed unsurprised by my appearance, as if he'd suspected this connection all along.
William had managed to stand by now, brushing off his expensive suit with indignant huffs. Following Christina's gaze, he turned and spotted me.
"Angela Wilson??" he exclaimed, his voice echoing down the hallway. "How is this possible??"
Sean, who had been about to close his door, froze. Our eyes met briefly, his expression unreadable.
I assessed the situation quickly. This was not the confrontation I had come for. My children were somewhere inside Sean's apartment, and that was all that mattered. These people-with their tangled histories and complicated agendas-were irrelevant obstacles.
With practiced composure, I stepped forward, intending to walk past them all without acknowledgment. My gaze remained fixed on the doorway beyond Sean.
"Sean," William suddenly called out, his voice sharp with accusation. "Why is Angela Wilson here? Didn't you divorce her years ago? And what about that child inside-what's your relationship to her?"
I kept walking, determined not to engage.
"How can you do this to Christina?" William continued, his voice rising. "After everything she's done for you?"
From the corner of my eye, I saw Christina's eyes grow glassy with carefully timed tears, her lower lip caught between her teeth in a perfect picture of feminine distress. The performance was flawless-I had to give her that.
Sean's expression hardened as he turned to William, his voice dropping to that dangerous register I remembered all too well. "That's enough."
"No, it's not nearly enough," William shot back, stepping closer to Sean. "We deserve answers. Today, with all of us here, you need to explain yourself. Or this isn't over."
William lunged forward, reaching for Sean's collar again. Sean didn't move, but his voice cut through the tension like a blade of ice.
"Don't touch me."
Something in his tone made William pause mid-stride, his hand hovering in the air between them.
"Fine, I won't touch you," William huffed, stepping back. "But you're going to explain what's happening here."
Sean's eyes narrowed coldly. "Since when do I need to report to you about my personal affairs?"
I stood quietly, waiting for my opportunity to slip past them. My patience was wearing thin, but creating a scene would only make things worse.
A small movement caught my eye-a flash of dark curls peeking around the doorframe behind Sean. My heart stopped. Aria and Ethan had come to investigate the commotion.
They stood just inside the apartment, their small faces curious and concerned as they tried to understand the adult drama unfolding before them. The realization that they might be hearing this entire exchange-accusations about divorces and relationships they couldn't possibly understand-sent a surge of protective fury through me.
I moved decisively then, stepping around William and heading straight for the door. My only thought was to reach my children and remove them from this toxic situation.
I'd almost made it past when William's hand shot out, gripping my shoulder hard enough to stop me in my tracks.
"This woman abandoned you!" he shouted at Sean, using his free hand to point accusingly at me.
 "Five years without a word! She didn't even come back when Elizabeth died! And you're throwing away what you have with Christina for her? Have you lost your mind?"
I frowned, trying to twist away from his grip. William's fingers dug into my shoulder, refusing to release me.
Something shifted in the atmosphere-a sudden drop in temperature that had nothing to do with the building's climate control. I looked up to see Sean's face transform, his usual mask of control slipping to reveal something darker, more primal.
"William West," Sean growled, "get your fucking hands off her. Now."
###chapter 168: I Will Never Marry You
Angela POV
"For a woman, you punch me?" William steadied himself against the wall, nostrils flaring. "I'll fight you too, Sean! This is insane!"
Sean gently shifted me behind him, placing himself between William and me in a gesture that was unmistakably protective.
"Try it," Sean challenged, his tone still unnervingly calm.
William lunged forward, fist drawn back. Sean caught his punch mid-air with disturbing ease, fingers closing around William's knuckles like a vise.
"Don't lose your mind in my home," Sean warned softly.
"Who's losing their mind?" William spat back. "You're the one who's lost it! How can you face Christina after this? What kind of man are you?"
William's other hand shot up unexpectedly, connecting with Sean's jaw. I gasped involuntarily, my heart racing as I watched the two men square off.
"Sean, please stop!" Christina's voice cut through the tension as she stepped forward, eyes glistening with tears. She grabbed William's wrist desperately. "William, don't hit him! Please!"
Her knuckles whitened as she clung to William's arm. "Both of you, just talk it out. Don't fight because of me."
I observed the scene with quiet detachment, noting the hidden currents beneath her words. This fight isn't really about you, Christina.
What struck me most was the way Christina looked at Sean-her eyes brimming with expectation and dependency, her entire body angled toward him even as she restrained William.
Evan stepped forward, his practical nature asserting itself. "Gentlemen, this is beneath both of you. We've all been friends for years. Let's talk like adults."
"He threw the first punch!" William protested, yanking against Christina's restraining grip.
"Would he have done that if you hadn't grabbed Angela's shoulder?" Evan countered, raising an eyebrow. "You instigated this."
"I just grabbed her shoulder," William huffed indignantly. "I didn't hit her."
Evan shook his head in disapproval. "That's hardly gentlemanly behavior, William."
"What's so special about Angela Wilson anyway?" William sneered, his gaze raking over me dismissively. "Is she untouchable now? Too precious to even be touched?"
"Too precious for you to touch," Sean replied, his voice dropping an octave. The possessiveness in his tone sent an involuntary shiver down my spine.
Evan raised both hands, his patience visibly thinning. "Enough! Are you two planning to continue this ridiculous display all night? Because if so, I'm leaving."
Evan raised both hands, visibly frustrated. "Enough of this ridiculous display!"
I watched the tense standoff, deliberately staying silent. This wasn't my fight, and I had no desire to mediate between Sean and his so-called friends. My only concern was retrieving my children and leaving this toxic situation.
"Shaw uncle, are you fighting?"
The small voice sent ice through my veins. I turned to see Aria standing in the doorway, her small fingers clutching Sean's suit jacket. Her dark curls framed her innocent face as she looked up at the adults with wide, curious eyes.
Everyone's attention immediately shifted to her. I watched as they took in her features, the striking resemblance to Sean unmistakable even to strangers.
I moved quickly, pulling Aria to my side. "Aria, don't get involved in adult matters," I said firmly, trying to mask my panic. "Where's your brother? Go get him. We're leaving."
Ethan appeared in the doorway, moving to stand beside us. With his serious expression and unmistakable green eyes, his resemblance to Sean was impossible to miss.
I watched Christina's face drain of color as her gaze darted between Ethan and Sean. The truth was written plainly on her face-she recognized immediately whose children these were.
Sean's entire demeanor transformed the moment Aria appeared. He immediately released William and stepped back, all aggression vanishing from his posture. I noticed how he positioned himself to subtly include me and the children within his protective radius.
"What the hell, Sean?" William exploded, looking from the children to Sean and back. "Are these your kids? You've had children with Angela all this time? What about Christina? What has she been to you all these years? Does she deserve to be strung along like this?"
The hallway fell silent as everyone awaited Sean's response.
William spun toward Christina. "What is he talking about? What did you two discuss that I don't know about?"
Christina's face had gone ashen, her lips pressed into a thin line as she seemed unable to formulate a response.
"Do I need to spell it out for everyone?" Sean asked, his voice glacial as Christina remained mute.
"Fine. Since you all want to know, I'll say it plainly. Five years ago, when Angela left, you came to my room in the middle of the night pretending to be her. Later, you spread rumors about our engagement.
I've kept quiet about these things to protect you, Christina, but I've repeatedly told you that I will never marry you. I'm saying it again now, in front of everyone, so there will be no more misunderstandings. I will never marry you."
I stared at Christina in disbelief. The calculated deception Sean described was shocking even to me, who had experienced her manipulations firsthand.
William's expression morphed from anger to confusion to shock as he processed Sean's words. Christina couldn't meet anyone's eyes, her silence confirming everything.
"Is this true?" William asked her, his voice suddenly quiet. "Did you really do those things?"
Christina's continued silence was answer enough.
Evan shook his head slowly. "Everyone heard about that engagement party. All this time, I thought Sean had abandoned you."
An uncomfortable silence descended as everyone absorbed this unexpected revelation. Sean's eyes found mine again, a hint of apology in them for airing all this dirty laundry in front of me and the children.
"I just thought..." Christina finally spoke, her voice breaking, "that even if you didn't love me at first, with time you would see that I was the one who truly loved you, that you would eventually change your mind..."
William's face displayed a kaleidoscope of emotions before settling back on indignation. "What's so wrong with that? She only did those things because she loves you so much! At least she didn't abandon you like Angela did!"
His words stung, but I remained silent. Sean's expression hardened further.
"I never promised Christina anything," Sean stated firmly. "I never agreed to that supposed engagement."
"It's all clear now," Evan said, looking at Christina. "You need to let this go, Christina. It's over."
"Sean," Christina attempted one last plea, "that day on the yacht, if it weren't for me, you would have-"
"I will repay the life debt," Sean interrupted coldly, "but not with marriage. I've been perfectly clear about that."
###chapter 169: You're Just As Pathetic As She Is!
Angela POV
Sean stood before me, his emerald eyes locked with mine. "Angela, there's nothing between Christina and me. There never has been."
The hallway fell silent as his declaration hung in the air. From the corner of my eye, I could see Christina standing a few feet away, her lips pressed white with tension. She clearly hadn't expected Sean to deny their relationship so publicly and definitively.
I glanced toward the corner where Aria and Ethan had retreated. Aria was tugging at her brother's sleeve, whispering something as she watched the adults with undisguised curiosity.
I needed to end this confrontation quickly-my children had already witnessed too much.
"Ethan," I heard Aria ask in a small voice, "did Mr. Night and Mommy know each other before?"
I immediately shot Ethan a warning look. Thank goodness for my son's perceptiveness. He quickly took his sister's hand and led her away. "Aria, let's go look over there, okay?" They moved to the far end of the hallway, away from the tension.
As the children walked away, I noticed Christina's gaze following them, lingering particularly on Ethan's green eyes-eyes identical to Sean's.
My heart clenched, and I felt an overwhelming urge to shield them from her scrutiny.
I looked down at my wrist, still firmly in Sean's grip, and pulled it away decisively. "So what?" I asked coldly. "What does that have to do with me?"
Christina's expression shifted at my words, as if my apparent indifference offered her some strange comfort. Sean frowned, clearly caught off guard by my dismissal of his explanation.
Five years had taught me how to protect myself from emotional harm. I wouldn't easily trust anyone again-not even Sean.
I straightened my posture, looking at each person in turn. "I haven't had any relationship with Sean Shaw for five years. Whatever grievances exist between you all have nothing to do with me."
I turned toward my children. "Aria, Ethan, we're going home."
Seeing them dutifully come to stand behind me filled me with relief. No matter what happened, they would always be my priority.
As I led the children past William, he suddenly grabbed my arm. "Nothing to do with you? If that's true, why are you here with these children? Aren't you just trying to use them to get Sean back?"
I looked down at his hand on my arm with disgust. "Mr. West, in your eyes, is Christina always right no matter what she does?"
William responded immediately, "Of course! To me, Christina is a thousand times better than you. She's the one who deserves Sean."
I gave a cold laugh. "That's only because you're in love with Christina but can't have her, isn't it? You're just as pathetic as she is."
William's expression froze-I had clearly hit a nerve. I yanked my arm from his grasp and continued toward the elevator. I wouldn't let anyone stop me from taking my children away from this toxic situation.
Behind me, I heard William's panicked explanation: "Christina, I..."
I didn't look back, but I could imagine the disappointment on Christina's face. Exposing William's secret feelings hadn't been my intention, but I wouldn't apologize for it either.
I quickened my pace, desperate to reach the elevator and escape this place. Yet something told me William wouldn't let this end so easily.
Sure enough, I heard his footsteps approaching from behind. "Stop right there, Angela Wilson!"
To my surprise, Aria suddenly stepped in front of me, bravely positioning herself as a shield. "You bad man! Don't touch my mommy again!"
My heart swelled with both pride and fear. William's face contorted with rage, seemingly provoked further by Aria's appearance-her features so unmistakably inherited from Sean.
"Get out of my way!" he shouted, raising his foot to kick toward her. "How dare a little girl stand in my way?"
"Aria!" I screamed, instinctively lunging forward to protect my daughter.
I saw Sean rushing toward us, his face pale with fear. Even Christina looked shocked by William's actions, clearly not expecting him to attack a child.
In that moment, my only concern was protecting my child. I successfully pushed Aria aside and shielded her with my body, but William's kick had too much force behind it. Pain shot through me as I lost my balance and fell backward.
Before consciousness slipped away, I felt my head strike the corner of a decorative console table.
Excruciating pain radiated through my body. I heard Ethan's terrified voice: "Mommy!"
I wanted to respond, to tell him I was okay, but my body wouldn't obey. Darkness closed in around me.
In the last moment before losing consciousness, I felt someone lift me into their arms.
Even through the haze of pain, I recognized Sean's scent.
###chapter 170: The Weight of Her in My Arms
Angela POV
The chaos around us faded into a dull roar.
Christina was screaming something at William, who stood paralyzed, his face drained of color.
Evan was already on the phone, presumably calling for an ambulance. None of it mattered.
All I could focus on was Angela's face. Even unconscious, even with blood matting her hair, she was beautiful. If things were different, if she wasn't injured, having her lie quietly in my arms like this would have been...
"Mommy!" Aria's terrified wail cut through everything, her small body rushing toward us. Ethan was right behind her, his eyes-my eyes-wide with panic though he was clearly struggling to remain calm.
"She's breathing," I told them, trying to sound reassuring despite the fear clawing at my throat. "But we need to get her to a hospital right away."
"An ambulance will take too long," I decided, already moving toward the elevator. "We're going now."
I turned briefly, fixing William with a stare so cold it seemed to physically make him recoil.
I'll never forgive him-no way. But now's just not the time.
The elevator ride down was excruciating. Each second felt like an eternity as Angela remained motionless in my arms.
Ethan and Aria stood pressed against my legs, both silently crying. I wanted to comfort them, to assure them everything would be alright, but the words stuck in my throat.
You can't leave me, I thought fiercely, gazing down at Angela's pale face. Not when I've just found you again. Not when we have so much unfinished between us.
With the children secured, I carefully placed Angela across the back seat, her head resting on Ethan's lap. I hated relinquishing her, even to her own son, but I needed to drive.
I caught Ethan's solemn gaze in the rearview mirror. "Ethan, can you help watch your mother? Make sure her head stays still."
"I can," he responded, his small voice shaking but resolute.
"Good. You and Aria help take care of her. Mr. Night is going to take you all to the hospital."
"Okay," Ethan nodded, gently placing his small hand over his mother's.
"Mama, you'll be okay. You won't be hurt. You'll be fine." The tenderness in his voice, the way he stroked Angela's hair away from her face-it pierced my heart.
My son. This is my son comforting his mother.
"Is Mommy going to die?" Aria's terrified question shattered the tense silence.
"Aria, don't say stupid things!" Ethan snapped, though I could hear the fear beneath his forced bravado.
"But she's not waking up..." Aria's voice dissolved into sobs.
"Mama just hurt her head," Ethan insisted, his voice rising. "Mama won't die! She won't!"
I gripped the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles turning white as I navigated through traffic.
"Ethan, Aria," I said, struggling to keep my voice steady, "Mr. Night... I won't let anything happen to your mother. I promise. Please believe me."
I caught a glimpse of Aria's tear-streaked face in the mirror.
"Mr. Night, Aria hates you," she declared, her childish voice thick with tears.
The words stung more than they should have, coming from a five-year-old in distress. I forced a bitter smile. "Hate me if you want. Right now, we need to get to the hospital."
***
"Stay close," I instructed the children as we hurried through the automatic doors. "Help is coming."
"My wife needs immediate attention," I called out, the word 'wife' slipping out naturally despite our years apart.
In that moment, in my heart, she was still my wife. She would always be my wife.
Medical staff quickly surrounded us, efficiently transferring Angela to a gurney. I watched helplessly as they wheeled her away, the doors to the emergency ward swinging closed behind them.
Thirty minutes later, I paced the waiting room floor while Ethan and Aria sat huddled together on uncomfortable plastic chairs. Neither child had spoken since Angela was taken away, their small faces tight with worry.
The sound of hurried footsteps drew my attention to the corridor, where Thomas Smith appeared, looking flustered and out of breath.
"This... this is a disaster," he gasped, adjusting his glasses. "What happened? How did Ms. Wilson end up in the hospital?"
"It was sudden," I replied tersely.
"Buy some food the children might like," I added, suddenly remembering that neither Ethan nor Aria had eaten dinner. "Something suitable for kids."
Thomas glanced around, his expression confused. "Ethan young master and Aria young miss are here too? Where-"
"They're in the room with their mother," I cut him off, not wanting to admit that the children had refused to let me accompany them once the doctors allowed visitors. "You won't need to look for them."
"In the room?" Thomas repeated, looking perplexed. "The patient's room?"
His gaze drifted to the closed door of Angela's room, then back to me standing alone in the hallway. A flicker of understanding crossed his face.
"Mr. Shaw," he ventured cautiously, "if I may ask... were you perhaps asked to wait outside by the twins?"
My jaw clenched involuntarily.
The truth was too humiliating to acknowledge aloud.
My own children had made it crystal clear they wanted me nowhere near Angela's bedside.
Took me forever to get the kids to like me, and now my idiot friends went and screwed it all up!
###chapter 171: How Am I Supposed to Use the Bathroom With You Watching?
Angela POV
I stirred awake to the rhythmic beep of machines, my eyelids heavy as if weighed down by the night itself.
A dull ache pulsed in my skull, sharp and unrelenting. As my blurry vision sharpened, I saw Sean perched beside my bed, his tired eyes locked on me with a quiet intensity that made my skin prickle.
Memories flickered back-his apartment, William's rage, the searing pain that followed.
"You're awake," Sean murmured, his voice low, almost a caress in the stillness.
I tried to sit up, but a jolt of pain pinned me back. Panic clawed at my chest. "Aria and Ethan-where are they?" My voice scraped out, rough and raw.
"They're safe," he said, gesturing across the room. I followed his gaze, relief flooding me as I spotted my twins curled together on a sofa, cocooned under a blanket and his coat, their small faces peaceful despite the chaos.
"What time is it?" I whispered, careful not to disturb them.
"Almost two in the morning," Sean replied. "You've been out for about four hours." He leaned closer, concern softening his features. "How do you feel? Dizzy?"
I turned my head away, avoiding his gaze. "Seeing you makes me uncomfortable."
He nodded, easing back just enough to give me space, though his presence still lingered too close, too warm.
"So?" I pressed when he didn't speak. "Are you leaving?"
"Not until I know you're okay," he said, his tone firm yet edged with something softer.
He reached for the water pitcher. "Thirsty? Let me pour you some."
"No," I snapped.
"You haven't eaten all night," he countered, undeterred. "You've been unconscious for hours. You need something."
"I don't want water. I don't want food. I don't want you here." I met his eyes, defiant. "If you feel guilty about tonight, call Christopher. Tell him to come."
A flicker of anger flashed in his gaze, quickly masked. "Not possible," he said, voice icy.
"Then stop bothering me," I shot back, turning away.
I reached for the call button, desperate for a nurse to shoo him off, only to realize my right arm was swathed in bandages, immobile. The memory hit-shielding Aria, tumbling, my arm twisting beneath me. Pain flared through my shoulder and skull as I moved, a gasp slipping out as my body trembled.
Sean was at my side in an instant. "Did you hurt yourself again? Are you in pain?"
"Don't touch me," I hissed through gritted teeth. "Why act concerned now? If you hadn't taken my kids, I wouldn't have chased you down. I wouldn't have met your charming friends, and I wouldn't be here."
His face softened, guilt shadowing his eyes. "You're right. I screwed up, and you got hurt because of it. I'm sorry." He raked a hand through his tousled hair. "But right now, you need rest. We'll sort the rest later, when you're better. Okay?"
His calm reason stoked my irritation. I didn't want him sensible or gentle-I wanted my anger, a shield against the pull I still felt toward him.
The room tilted faintly, my headache worsening. I needed the bathroom but loathed asking him for help. Finally, I had no choice.
Bracing my left arm, I tried to stand. The world swayed, my vision blurring.
Before I could collapse, Sean's arms caught me, strong yet impossibly tender.
His chest pressed against mine, solid and warm, his breath grazing my ear. Despite my fury, the heat of his body seeped into me, coaxing a shiver I couldn't suppress. His hands, firm on my waist, held me steady, and for a fleeting moment, I wanted to sink into that comfort.
"What are you trying to do?" he murmured, his voice a low rumble against my skin. "Let me help you."
"I don't need your help," I lied, even as the room spun.
His arm tightened around me, a possessive yet gentle grip. "You need the bathroom, don't you?" When I didn't reply, he nodded. "I'll carry you."
Before I could protest, he scooped me up, his muscles flexing beneath my weight. My body stiffened-pain and his closeness warring within me-but his warmth enveloped me, his scent stirring memories I'd tried to bury.
"Put me down," I demanded, my voice faltering as dizziness surged.
"Be still," he whispered, his lips too close to my temple. "Do you want to wake the kids?"
I glanced at Aria and Ethan, still asleep, and went quiet. Sean carried me to the bathroom, his steps deliberate, his hold unwavering. At the door, I tensed.
"You can leave now," I said, sharper than intended.
He hesitated, worry etching his face, then set me down with care. His hands lingered a moment too long, brushing my hips.
As he moved to unbutton my pants, his fingers grazing the fabric, I yelped, "What are you doing?!"
He froze, raising an eyebrow. "Helping you. Your arm's busted, remember? What did you think I was doing?"
Heat flooded my cheeks, my pulse racing. "I-I can manage. Get out!"
He chuckled softly, stepping back to the doorway but not leaving entirely. I shot him a look over my shoulder. "What, are you going to watch me piss? Go further!"
He moved back a few more steps, just enough to keep me in sight while giving me some privacy.
I closed the door and leaned against it, catching my breath. In the mirror, I saw my messy appearance - a bandage on my forehead, tangled hair, and dark circles under my eyes.
After using the bathroom, I splashed water on my face with my good hand, careful not to wet the bandage. I took a deep breath and prepared to face Sean again, determined to walk back to bed on my own.
Near the bed, he appeared beside me. "Let me help," he said, reaching out.
"Don't touch me," I snapped, though my strength was fading. "I'm fine. It's my arm and head, not my legs."
He sighed, then swept me up again, ignoring my weak protests. His arms cradled me, warm and sure, and I was too exhausted to fight the way my body relaxed against his.
"This isn't necessary," I mumbled as he lowered me to the bed.
"Maybe not," he said, his breath brushing my cheek, "but it's easier this way."
###chapter 172: The Text Message from Five Years Ago
Angela POV
Sean carefully laid me on the hospital bed, his movements gentle as he tucked the blanket around me. My head throbbed beneath the bandages, a constant reminder of the evening's chaos.
"You can leave now," I said, my voice strained but determined. "I'm fine."
He glanced toward the twins, still curled together on the sofa across the room. "Even if you don't need care, the children do."
I felt a flare of indignation burn through my exhaustion. "Why are you suddenly trying to take my children? Why this sudden interest in being the perfect father?"
The question that had haunted me for five years suddenly burned on my tongue, demanding release.
 "You were the one who didn't want them in the first place!"
His brow furrowed, confusion flickering across his features. "What are you talking about? I never said I didn't want children."
A bitter laugh escaped me. "Don't pretend, Mr. Shaw. Just because you didn't say it aloud doesn't mean it wasn't your decision."
Sean's fingers drummed lightly against the edge of my bed. "If I didn't say it, then how exactly was it my decision?"
I couldn't believe his audacity. After everything that had happened, he still couldn't admit the truth. My voice trembled slightly despite my efforts to control it.
"Sean, do you really not have the courage to admit what you did?"
"How can I admit to something I never did?" His shoulders tensed, voice dropping lower. "Whatever you think happened, you're wrong."
Exhaustion washed over me suddenly, stealing whatever fight remained. I turned toward the window, watching the city lights shimmer through the darkness.
"The text," I finally said, breaking the heavy silence that had settled between us.
Sean's eyes narrowed slightly. "What text?"
"The text I sent you," I replied wearily, "telling you I was pregnant."
He went very still, brow furrowed in concentration. After a moment, he asked carefully, "Did I respond to it?"
"No." The word fell between us, simple yet weighted with five years of pain.
Sean's expression shifted, something like realization dawning. "Angela, would you believe me if I told you I never received that message?"
"I figured you'd deny it," I replied with a cold smile. "Since you never replied, it's convenient to claim you never saw it."
"Think about it," he pressed, urgency coloring his tone. "Would I really ignore something that important? We've known each other since childhood. Am I really the type of person who would do that?"
I kept my expression neutral despite the sting of his words. "We did know each other for years. I thought I understood you completely. But people change, don't they? Christina was the one you truly loved. Maybe you changed for her."
His eyebrows shot up, green eyes flashing with sudden heat. "You think I would hurt you for her?"
I met his gaze directly. "Didn't you?"
"When?" The question rumbled from him like distant thunder.
Sean reached for my hand, his touch surprisingly gentle. "About that text-I honestly didn't know. If I didn't respond, it's because I truly never saw it. I never received it."
"How is that possible?" I maintained my composure. "I confirmed the message was sent successfully."
"Maybe the signal was bad," he suggested, his voice low but determined. "Or perhaps my phone wasn't in my possession at that moment."
I raised an eyebrow skeptically. "Your own phone wasn't in your possession? Who would dare touch your phone?"
The question hung between us, neither willing to voice the obvious suspicion. The room fell silent again.
"I'm tired," I said finally, punctuating the statement with a yawn. "Can I rest now?"
Sean nodded. "Of course. Get some sleep. I'll get to the bottom of this, Angela. I'll find evidence to make you believe me."
I rolled my eyes. "Whatever you say."
I turned onto my side, facing away from him, and closed my eyes. My breathing slowed deliberately, creating the illusion of sleep, but I watched Sean's reflection in the window with careful attention.
He adjusted my blanket gently before moving to stand by the floor-to-ceiling window, his silhouette dark against the city lights.
After several minutes, he pulled out his phone, studying the screen intently. A flicker of realization crossed his face before quickly fading. Of course, after five years and multiple phone upgrades, those old messages would be long gone.
He dialed a number, speaking in hushed tones that nonetheless carried clearly in the quiet room. Clearly, he thought I was asleep.
"Thomas?" His voice was barely above a whisper. "I need you to track down all my text messages from a specific date five years ago, including anything that might have gone to spam folders."
Thomas's sleepy voice was faint but audible. "Mr. Shaw? Is something urgent?"
"This is urgent," Sean insisted. "I need you to find these records. Contact the telecommunications company, search everything. I need to know every message that came to my phone on that date."
"But sir," Thomas protested weakly, "records from that long ago-"
"You're my chief administrative assistant," Sean cut him off. "Figure it out."
After ending the call, Sean returned to my bedside, releasing a quiet sigh. I maintained my pretense of sleep, though my mind raced with new questions. He was truly investigating, searching for evidence. Could it be possible? Had he really never received my message?
With these confusing thoughts, I finally drifted into a restless sleep.
###chapter 173:How Can You Have Sexual Desire For A Patient?
Angela POV
The hospital room greeted me with a dull hum as I stirred awake, my forehead throbbing and my right arm a useless, aching weight at my side.
Across the room, my twin children slept soundly on a small bed, their soft breathing a fragile tether to calm.
Sean sat beside me, his laptop casting a faint glow over his chiseled features. The moment I moved, his gaze snapped to mine, sharp and attentive, sending an unexpected flutter through my chest.
"You're awake," he said, his voice a low, silken drawl as he glanced briefly at the kids. "How do you feel?"
"Like someone took a bat to my head," I muttered, struggling to sit up with my left arm, the right one dangling painfully.
He shut his laptop with a decisive click and leaned closer, his presence filling the space. "The doctor wants a final CT scan to rule out anything serious. Your arm's mildly dislocated-nothing permanent, but it'll hurt for a while."
I dodged his concern. "When can I leave this hellhole?"
"After the scan this morning," he replied, hesitating before adding, "You need to change first. The doctor's coming soon."
I glanced at the hospital gown clinging to me, stained with dried blood from my forehead. "I'll manage."
"Your arm's dislocated, Angela," he said, his tone firm yet edged with a warmth that made my skin tingle. "Don't be ridiculous."
"I can do it," I insisted, though a sharp stab of pain shot through my shoulder as I shifted.
He raised a brow, lips quirking faintly. "Sure you can." He reached for a shopping bag by the bed. "Thomas brought these-soft, easy clothes."
I glared at him, pride clashing with necessity. "I don't need-"
"You do," he cut in, his voice a quiet command that brooked no argument. "Unless you want a nurse?"
The thought of a stranger's hands on me was worse. I relented, looking away as heat crept up my cheeks. "Fine."
Sean stood, his frame towering yet gentle as he pulled back the blanket with care. My breath hitched as he sat on the bed's edge, his thigh brushing mine through the thin sheet.
He reached for the ties of my gown, his fingers deft as he loosened them. The fabric fell away, and cool air hit my bare torso. Instinctively, I clamped my left arm over my chest, shielding my breasts, my heart pounding as I felt his eyes on me.
"Relax," he murmured, his voice a low rumble. Before I could protest, he gently pried my arm away, exposing me completely.
My breasts hung heavy and bare before him, nipples hardening in the chill-and, damn it, under his gaze. I turned my head sharply, cheeks flaming, unable to meet his eyes.
He didn't speak, just picked up a black lace bra from the bag. "Lift your arms as much as you can," he said, his tone steady, though his eyes darkened as they lingered on me.
I hesitated, then obeyed, wincing as my shoulder screamed. He slid the straps up my arms, his palms grazing the sides of my breasts-slow, deliberate.
A jolt of electricity shot through me, pooling low in my belly as his hands cupped me briefly, adjusting the fit.
My breath caught, and then-God help me-he leaned down, his lips brushing the swell of my breast in a soft, searing kiss.
I jolted back, shock and heat warring in my chest. "What the hell, Sean?!" I snapped, voice shaking. "You pervert-how can you even think about that with a patient?"
He pulled back, a wicked, unrepentant grin spreading across his face.
"Sorry," he said, not sounding sorry at all. "I couldn't help it. Your breasts are beautiful. I lost control for a second." He raised his hands in mock surrender. "I promise I won't touch you again."
My face burned, outrage mixing with something I refused to name.
He grabbed the cotton shirt next, sliding it over my arms with careful precision-first the good one, then the injured one-his fingers brushing my skin just enough to keep my pulse racing.
He buttoned it up, his knuckles grazing my collarbone, then draped a cashmere coat over my shoulders, the fabric soft and warm against my still-flushed skin.
When he reached into the bag again and pulled out a pair of silk panties, my stomach flipped. His hand slipped under the blanket, fingers brushing the bare skin of my thigh as he moved to help me.
I froze, then yanked the blanket tighter. "No," I said, firm and final, my voice cutting through the thick air. "I'll do it myself."
He paused, that infuriating half-smile tugging at his lips. "Your arm-"
"I said no," I snapped, clutching the silk with my good hand, my cheeks still hot from his earlier stunt.
He chuckled-a low, throaty sound that sent a shiver down my spine-and stood. "I'll make a call. Be right outside."
Half an hour later, he returned with a nurse and a wheelchair. "Ready for your scan?" he asked, as if he hadn't just kissed my breast like it was nothing.
I glared at the chair. "I hurt my head, not my legs."
"I know," he said, unfazed, stepping closer. Before I could argue, he lifted me from the bed, his arms strong and warm beneath me. My body pressed against his chest, and a traitorous shiver ran through me-his scent, his heat, the memory of his lips on my skin.
The CT scan was quick, clinical-nothing serious, just a mild concussion. Rest, they said. Discharge by afternoon.
As Sean wheeled me back, I spotted Christina Jordan and William West outside my door, peering in like scavengers. My stomach twisted, dread sinking in.
Sean's hand brushed my shoulder, a brief squeeze. "I'll handle this," he murmured.
"Your mess," I shot back coldly, though my pulse still thrummed from his touch.
Christina saw us first, her face shifting to fake concern as she glided over. "Angela! How are you feeling? We were so worried!"
I didn't believe a word of it.
