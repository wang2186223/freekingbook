###chapter 1 Marrying Just Anyone
********
Trapped by family betrayal, Isabella marries a stranger to survive. But her "ordinary" husband hides a deadly secret: he's the heir to a fortune—and her enemies' worst nightmare. Can their fake love destroy a conspiracy that wants her dead?
********

'Where am I? Why can't I move?' Isabella Taylor thought, a wave of dizziness washing over her. 

She managed to crack her eyes open just a bit, but everything around her kept spinning wildly.

'I feel like I'm being pushed somewhere. Where is this? The smell of disinfectant is so overwhelming. Am I in a hospital?' 

With what little awareness she had left, Isabella finally caught sight of the bright surgical lights and the medical staff in their scrubs bustling around her.

"I'm not sick! Why am I in a hospital? Let me go! I just want to go home!" 

She tried to scream, but all that escaped her lips was a feeble sound.

When Isabella was pushed into the operating room, the last thing she saw was a very familiar face, that of her sister Bianca Taylor.

"Isabella, do you know how long I've waited for this moment? I can finally watch you die."

Bianca's eyes were full of resentment, and she left the operating room laughing with a mocking smile on her face.

"Come back! I don't want to die! Someone, please save me!" Isabella's eyes widened in sheer terror. She desperately wanted to scream, but all that came out was a raspy, unsettling sound that barely filled the room.

Until the doctor injected Isabella with anesthesia again, her consciousness once again fell into a stupor.

'Am I really going to die this time? I didn't do anything wrong. Why is this happening to me? If I die, what will happen to my husband? Will he cry? Probably not, since we've only known each other for a short time.'

Isabella's life flashed quickly through her mind.

'I've heard that when people are about to die, they quickly review their entire life. It feels like I'm in that moment right now.'

Isabella couldn't help but laugh at herself inwardly. It felt like time had frozen in the entire world at this moment. 

In those fleeting memories, she saw a man who had brought her so much pain. 

"John, you bastard. If I make it through this, I swear I'll never let you off the hook,"  she cursed John Williams silently, her heart filled with resentment.

Isabella had once been engaged to John, with Mason Williams as their witness. She had loved him for eight long years, only to recently discover that he had been with Bianca all along. They had even planned to use Isabella's kidney to treat Bianca's uremia.

"How could I have been so blind to fall for that bastard, John? My current husband is so much better than him! At least he wouldn't hurt me!"

Isabella cursed John, but at the same time, another man's image appeared in her mind.

Time rewound to two days ago.

Isabella stood at the entrance of City Hall, gazing into the distance as she waited for someone to arrive. He was a man she found through a dating website, eager to settle down and escape the pressure from his family to get married.

"John, you bastard, trying to use marriage as a threat against me. I'll marry whoever I want! I'll show you that you're not irreplaceable," she muttered to herself, her anger boiling over and her thoughts a bit irrational. It was all John's fault for using their engagement to manipulate her. If she didn't agree to give up her kidney to save Bianca, he would never even consider marrying her.

Suddenly, Isabella noticed a very ordinary car approaching from a distance. Then a man in a black suit got out of the car.

Isabella saw the man's appearance and immediately recognized that he was the one she was going to marry.

The man's name was Michael Williams. When Isabella first saw the surname, she was worried that he might be related to the Williams Family.

However, Michael's profile indicated that he was just a low-level employee at a company owned by the Williams Family, and the same surname was just a coincidence.

Isabella took a deep breath and walked toward Michael. As he approached, he looked her up and down, a hint of admiration in his eyes.

"You must be Ms. Taylor! I have to say, you're even more beautiful in person than in your photos," he said, flashing a charming smile.

Michael was strikingly handsome, radiating that mature male charm. The way his mouth curved when he smiled was both elegant and slightly roguish, making Isabella think he'd be better suited for a modeling agency than stuck in a small office job.

"Thank you for the compliment! You're quite handsome yourself," Isabella replied, trying to keep the conversation light.

"So, Ms. Taylor, are you really sure you want to marry me?" Michael asked again, his tone a mix of curiosity and seriousness.

Faced with this question, Isabella thought of the man she once deeply loved, John. But thinking of him being intimate with Bianca filled her with grievance and hatred.

"I've made up my mind. Let's get married," Isabella said seriously, looking at Michael.

"Alright, then let's go inside," Michael said, naturally taking Isabella's hand and leading her into City Hall.

Michael's natural action made Isabella suspicious.

'We're meeting for the first time, isn't this a bit impolite? Could his profile be fake? Maybe he's a playboy, but what does it matter? We're not marrying for love anyway.'

Isabella pushed aside her slight discomfort and began filling out the forms. When the staff collected their paperwork and handed them their marriage license, a wave of relief washed over her.

'Now, no one can use marriage to threaten me anymore,' she thought, smiling at the license in her hands.

Just then, her phone buzzed in her bag. She glanced at the caller ID, and her expression shifted subtly, a mix of surprise and apprehension crossing her face.

The call was from John's grandfather, Mason.

If John made her feel disgusted, John's grandfather Mason still brought a sense of warmth. He was the one who had arranged their marriage, after all. 

Mason's cheerful voice came through the phone, inviting Isabella to a family dinner and mentioning he wanted to introduce her to John's mysterious uncle. 

"I understand, Mason. I'll be there," Isabella replied, agreeing while mentally noting she needed to find a moment to tell him about her marriage.

After hanging up, Isabella sensed someone approaching from behind. She turned to find her new husband, Michael, standing there.

"Do you need something, Mr. Williams?" she asked, curious.

Michael shrugged, that casual smile still on his face. "I just wanted to check if you remember our agreement from earlier?"

###chapter 2 Meeting Her Parents

Isabella heard Michael bring up the agreement, and for a second, she was taken aback. But she quickly got her bearings.

She looked at Michael and said, "So, during the marriage, we stay out of each other's personal lives until the engagement ends in three years, and then we get divorced. Yeah, I remember. Anything else?"

Michael nodded with a grin, "Just one more thing: don't fall in love with me. I mean, I am pretty irresistible."

Isabella rolled her eyes. She didn't expect Michael to be so full of himself. He was good-looking, but she wasn't that shallow.

"Don't worry, I won't fall for you," she said, staring him down.

Michael looked back at her, trying to see if she was bluffing. When he saw she was dead serious, he frowned a bit.

'Is my charm fading?' he wondered. Women usually couldn't resist him.

"Alright, now that we're married, let's go our separate ways. Bye," Isabella said, turning to leave, while Michael grabbed her arm.

"Got something else to say?" she asked, annoyed.

Michael smirked, "Since our marriage is basically a show, we should play the part. So, how about I meet your parents?"

Isabella was taken aback. She wanted to say no, but then she figured her parents would find out eventually, so she decided to take advantage of her courage today and confess to them directly.

"Fine, but don't expect a warm welcome," she said, surprising Michael by pulling him into the car.

On the way to her place, Michael finally got why Isabella was in such a rush to get married. Her family was pushing her to marry some guy she didn't love, so she married a random dude to rebel.

'Rebel without a cause.' Michael thought, shaking his head. He wasn't worried; he could handle anything with his background.

At this moment, Michael was unaware that Isabella's original fiancé had a significant connection to him.

When they got to Isabella's house, Michael met her parents. He was about to say hi when they stormed over and started yelling at her.

Jasper was fuming, "What did you do to piss off John? He called us, demanding we control you!"

Her mom, Mia Wilson, grabbed Isabella's hand, worried, "Did you two fight? It's okay. In love, there's no right or wrong. Just apologize, and he'll forgive you."

Isabella felt crushed. Her heartbreak was bad enough, but her parents' reaction made it worse.

"Mom, it's not about an apology. Do you know what he wants? He wants me to give up a kidney to save Bianca, the woman he really loves. He's using marriage to blackmail me into donating a kidney," Isabella said, her eyes welling up. She hoped that by telling the truth, her parents would finally support her.

After hearing Isabella's words, her parents' faces did change, but what they said next crushed her.

"Isabella, it's just a kidney, and Bianca is your cousin. What's so hard about saving family? Don't forget our family's status. If we want to get back to where we were, we need their influence!" Jasper said sternly.

"Yes, Isabella. It's just a kidney, and their family will get the best doctors. You'll be safe during the surgery," Mia added, holding her hand and pleading.

Isabella's eyes filled with despair. She felt a chill run through her.

Michael, standing behind her, couldn't believe what he was hearing.

"Are you two really her parents? Did you pick her up off the street? What kind of parents force their daughter to give up a kidney for her rival and then marry a man who doesn't love her?" Michael stepped in front of Isabella, glaring at her parents.

"And who are you?" Jasper snapped at Michael.

Michael adjusted his collar, lifted his chin, and said proudly, "I'm Isabella's husband. We just got married."

"What?" Her parents were shocked, then furious.

"Isabella, what is this? You were already engaged! Are you trying to ruin our family?" Jasper raised his hand to slap her.

Before he could, Michael caught his wrist.

"With parents like you, she's truly unlucky," Michael said coldly, his earlier smile gone.

Even if he and Isabella had no real feelings, she was still his wife in name, and Jasper's actions were a direct insult to him.

Jasper tried to pull his hand away, but Michael's grip was iron. Michael's gaze was icy, almost murderous.

Suddenly, Michael felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to see Isabella, tears streaming down her face, shaking her head.

"Let's go; I don't want to stay here anymore," she said, not looking at her parents, and walked out.

Michael shot one last cold look at her parents, let go of Jasper's hand, and followed her.

Once outside, Isabella sat in the car, staring blankly at the windshield, her hands gripping the steering wheel, tears falling.

Michael sat in the passenger seat, feeling a pang of sympathy for this woman he barely knew.

"You remind me of those troubled princesses, but I hope things get better for you. Is everything okay?" he asked.

Isabella gave a bitter smile, "Every troubled princess finds true love eventually, but I can't even control my own life. I don't know why I'm even here."

Michael raised an eyebrow, reached over, and pulled the keys from the ignition.

Seeing her confused look, he said seriously, "Stay calm. I'm not done living yet."

###chapter 3 Stay Away from Bad Men

Michael's words left Isabella speechless, but when her parents started pressuring her, she did have some dark thoughts.

Michael seemed to have an idea and said, "If you're feeling lost, let me take you somewhere."

"Where?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

Without explaining, Michael hopped into the driver's seat and pulled Isabella down from her spot.

"It's a place that'll help you shake off this funk," Michael said with a wink, then started the car.

He felt a sense of relief gripping the wheel again, as long as Isabella wasn't driving.

During the drive, Isabella's phone rang. She hesitated, staring at the caller ID.

"If you don't wanna answer, just hang up or turn it off. That ringtone is annoying. Do you actually like it?" Michael shrugged, clearly irritated.

Isabella shot him a glare and answered the call.

John's angry voice blasted through the phone. "Isabella, you idiot! When are you coming? I've got the best doctor lined up for you. Do you even want to get married? Bianca's waiting!"

Isabella's grip tightened on the phone, her knuckles turning white. She was so mad her lips trembled, but she couldn't get a word out.

Annoyed, Michael snatched the phone from her and yelled, "Let that damn bitch die, and you can go with her!"

Then he chucked the phone out the window.

Isabella panicked and grabbed his arm. "Stop the car!"

Michael frowned. "Are you still hung up on that jerk who hurt you?"

"I'm upset about my phone! You threw away my new phone!" Isabella snapped. Why couldn't he just hang up? Did he not care about anything that wasn't his?

Feeling awkward, Michael pulled over and went to find her phone on the side of the road.

The phone was completely smashed, beyond repair. Isabella held the broken pieces, feeling wronged and on the verge of tears.

Michael scratched his nose, embarrassed. "I'm really sorry. I got too mad at that jerk and lost it. I'll get you a new one."

Isabella didn't respond, just got back in the car. Today was just not her day; nothing was going right. But she had no idea things were about to get worse.

Michael drove her to an abandoned factory with a huge chimney and led her to the top.

Isabella peered into the chimney, seeing nothing but darkness. She had no doubt that a fall would be fatal.

"Why did you bring me here? This place isn't helping my mood," Isabella said, confused.

"If you want to know the meaning of life, jump from here. In that moment, the rush of adrenaline and the fear of death will make you realize that all the hardships in this world are nothing compared to life itself," Michael said, flashing a bright smile.

Isabella thought he was nuts.

"If you want to die, go ahead and jump. Leave me out of it," she said, turning to leave, but Michael grabbed her.

The next thing she knew, Michael hugged her tight, and they both fell into the chimney.

"No!" Isabella screamed as the weightlessness took over. She felt the terror of death.

But just before despair could consume her, she felt herself hit something soft. They bounced back up like they were on a trampoline.

Looking down, Isabella saw a large elastic net hanging in the middle of the chimney, keeping them safe.

"See? Wasn't I right? Still wanna die?" Michael laughed, and Isabella's response was another scream.

"Michael, you're insane!" Isabella's hair was a mess, and she glared at him, but he just kept smiling.

"Alright, but at least you're feeling a bit more alive now, right?" Michael grinned.

Breathing heavily, Isabella did feel lighter, but that didn't mean she was okay with what Michael did.

"So, Mr. Williams, how do we get down from here now?" Isabella asked, her face stern.

She was sure no one else was around. How were they supposed to get out of this giant chimney?

"I kinda forgot about that part," Michael's smile froze, and he slapped his forehead in regret.

Before Isabella could get mad again, Michael quickly pulled out his phone.

"Hang on, I'll call for help," he said, dialing a number. But he was told they could only come the next morning.

After hanging up, Michael shrugged. "Looks like we're stuck here for the night. But hey, at least it won't be too cold."

"Am I always gonna be this unlucky around men?" Isabella lay down helplessly, staring up at the sky through the chimney. The sun was setting, and the clouds were tinged red by the evening glow.

"Troubled Princesses usually have a rough time before they find true love," Michael shrugged, but Isabella wasn't in the mood to chat.

As time passed and night fell, gravity took its toll, and Isabella dozed off, leaning on Michael, resting in his arms.

The moonlight shone in, illuminating her skin, making her look almost ethereal.

Michael gazed at her face, and in that moment, she truly seemed like a distressed princess.

He gently kissed her forehead, a smile playing on his lips as he closed his eyes and fell asleep with her.

Meanwhile, John kept calling Isabella but couldn't get through. Frustrated, he threw his phone. "Isabella, you bitch! How dare you not answer my calls!"

###chapter 4 The Princess Can Strike Down Her Enemies

John was fuming because Isabella wasn't picking up his calls. Just then, Bianca, in her hospital gown and pushing a wheelchair, rolled up next to him.

"John, don't be mad at Isabella. It's my fault. I betrayed her first by taking away you. She's probably heartbroken and that's why she's ignoring your calls," Bianca said, holding John's hand with a sad look.

John gently touched Bianca's face, gazing at her lovingly. "It's not your fault. I never liked Isabella. My grandpa set up that engagement. You're the one I truly love. Once you get your kidney transplant, I'll explain everything to my grandpa and then we'll get married."

"Thank you, John," Bianca's eyes filled with grateful tears.

John hugged Bianca, completely missing the malicious glint in her tear-filled eyes.

'Damn Isabella, why aren't you dead yet, you wretched woman? If it weren't for you, I'd have married John ages ago. Once my plan is done, I'll make sure you die on that operating table,' Bianca thought, seething with hatred.

Meanwhile, Isabella had no clue about the plot against her. She dreamt she was a distressed princess, saved by a mysterious prince.

When Isabella woke up, it was already morning.

The staff arrived just in time to free Michael and Isabella from the big net.

"Sleeping on this net, I still prefer a bed," Michael stretched and glanced at Isabella beside him.

"So, where to next? How about I take you to get a new phone?" Michael suggested.

Isabella shook her head. "No need, I have another phone at a friend's place. I can use my old one."

Michael nodded and handed her the car keys. "I guess you're not suicidal anymore, so I trust you to drive back now."

Isabella rolled her eyes. Yesterday, she thought she was a goner.

"Well, I guess this is goodbye." Isabella took the keys and got ready to leave, not even thinking about giving Michael a ride.

Suddenly, Michael called out from behind, "Don't you want to get revenge? A real princess would crush the villains' plans and make them pay!"

Isabella paused, silent for a few seconds, then waved without looking back. "Got it. Thanks for the tip."

Michael watched her leave. With his influence, he could easily help Isabella handle everything, but he had other matters to attend to.

After a while, a Rolls-Royce pulled up, and the driver respectfully invited Michael into the car.

"Mr. Williams, the driver of the crashed car is dead; our lead is cut off," the driver said coldly while driving.

Michael's eyes turned icy, a smirk playing on his lips. "I just got back to the country and received such a big 'gift.' If I don't return the favor, wouldn't that be rude?"

The driver kept quiet, knowing Michael's plans were always hush-hush until they were set in motion.

"Mr. Williams, Mr. Mason Williams wanted me to remind you about the banquet tonight," the driver said.

"Got it," Michael replied.

Meanwhile, Isabella drove over to her best friend Amelia Martinez's place.

As soon as Amelia saw her, she rushed over, "Isabella, where were you last night? I couldn't reach you. I was so worried."

Seeing Amelia's anxious face, Isabella felt a warmth in her heart. Amelia was one of the few people who genuinely cared about her.

"It's fine, my phone broke. Can you give me my old one?" After Amelia found the old phone, Isabella popped in her SIM card. The moment it powered up, she saw a bunch of missed calls.

Some were from her parents, but most were from John.

Seeing John's name, Isabella's eyes filled with disgust, and she remembered Michael's words.

'Michael's right. Why should I let them walk all over me? I need to get back at that witch Bianca and that jerk John!' Isabella thought, clenching her fists.

Suddenly, Amelia gasped, "Isabella, are you married? This guy is so handsome. Who is he?"

Isabella's bag had fallen, and Amelia had spotted the marriage documents inside.

"His name is Michael. He's just a junior employee at some company," Isabella said, taking the documents with a sigh. John was awful, but Michael didn't seem much better.

Who would take their newlywed wife to such a dangerous activity right after getting married?

"They have the same last name as John. Too bad he's not John's elder; you could've really rubbed it in John's face," Amelia said, knowing Isabella's situation.

Just then, Isabella's phone rang again, but it wasn't John this time-it was Mason.

After the call, Mason told Isabella the exact time of the banquet and hoped she could make it.

Isabella sighed after hanging up.

Amelia noticed and asked, "Are you worried that telling Mr. Williams the truth will upset him and make his health worse?"

Isabella nodded. "I plan to tell him at the right time, but a banquet isn't the place for it."

"I can see you're nervous. Want me to come with you?" Amelia offered.

Isabella shook her head. "I'll handle this on my own."

She declined Amelia's offer, not knowing that Michael would also be at the family banquet.

LuxeHaven Retreat.

In a luxurious private room, only a few people were seated, with Mason, the head of the Williams Family, at the head of the table. Sitting next to Mason was Isabella's new husband, Michael.

If Isabella were here, she'd be shocked by the conversation, as Michael referred to Mason as "uncle."

###chapter 5 Attending the Family Banquet

Next to the table were three people: Mason, Michael, and Mason's son, Owen Williams.

Mason glanced at Michael and grinned, "Honestly, I was hoping you and your dad would come back together this time, but he turned me down. So, you gotta stick around a bit longer."

Michael nodded, smiling. "Got it, Uncle Mason. I'm back to expand our market here, so I'll be around for a while. Also, Dad wanted me to tell you he misses you too, but he's swamped overseas."

Owen, who'd been quiet, finally spoke up, "John's coming over soon. He's always looked up to you. Perfect chance to introduce you two."

Michael nodded again, but then his smile faded, replaced by a hesitant look like he had something on his mind but didn't know how to say it.

Mason noticed and asked, "Michael, what's up?"

Michael sighed, "The day I got back, right after I landed, I was in a car accident. The weird part is, the other driver died, but the report said the crash wasn't bad enough to kill him."

Mason and Owen's faces changed instantly.

"Do you think it wasn't an accident?" Mason's eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint in them.

Michael nodded, looking a bit helpless. "Yes, I doubt it, after all, the driver's fatal injury was to the back of his head"

Mason drummed his fingers on the table, thinking. "Very few people knew you were coming back. Besides our family, the only ones who could find out are the other three major families."

Owen clenched his fists and slammed the table, his face full of anger. "Who else would dare? They must've heard about your skills and got scared you'd make our family even stronger. Don't worry, Michael, I'll help you get to the bottom of this."

Michael shook his head and smiled at Owen, "Thanks, Owen, but I want to handle this myself. It's too interesting to pass up."

Owen looked like he wanted to argue, but Mason's glare shut him up.

Mason turned to Michael and smiled, "If you want to investigate, go for it. If you need help, just ask. We're family. By the way, you came at a good time. John is about to marry his fiancée, Isabella."

Michael's smile vanished instantly. Wasn't Isabella the wife he had just married not long ago? Could it be that they simply shared the same name?

Owen looked at Michael and grinned, "Michael, you're a few years older than John and at the perfect age to get hitched. Got anyone special in mind?"

Michael nodded, "Actually, I met a girl a few days ago and fell for her right away. We're already married."

Owen and Mason raised their eyebrows at the quick timeline but soon relaxed.

"With your charm, I'm sure your wife is totally devoted," Owen said with a wink.

Michael smiled back but then excused himself to hit the restroom, leaving the banquet hall for a bit.

In the restroom, Michael pulled out his phone and called his subordinate. "Send me the info on John and his fiancée."

A few minutes later, he got the photos. When he saw Isabella's picture, he trembled and his eyes went cold.

LuxeHaven Retreat.

After changing outfits, Isabella finally arrived. She was led to the door of the box where Mason was.

She stood in the doorway, hesitating. Should she confess to Mason today? After all, he had been so kind to her, and he was the one who had arranged the marriage.

 Suddenly the door of the box was opened from inside , Isabella saw the person she least expected to see: John.

John was sitting on Mason's right, staring at Isabella with a cold gaze.

In the past, that look would've intimidated Isabella, but now she stared back without hesitation.

John narrowed his eyes, feeling challenged.

"Isabella, you finally made it. Come, sit here." Mason patted the seat on his left, inviting her over.

"Why are you here? I thought you were hiding, too scared to show your face," John sneered.

Mason furrowed his brow, sensing some tension.

Isabella sneered back, "You haven't scared me enough to avoid you. I just don't want to see you with that woman. It disgusts me."

"Isabella, what's going on? Did John do something to you?" Mason asked, frowning.

Isabella took a deep breath as she finally decided to come clean. She looked at Mason and said, "Thanks for your care all this time. Actually, I came here today to tell you I want to annul my engagement with John."

Mason looked surprised, and John shot up from his chair.

"Are you out of your mind, Isabella? Are you trying to threaten me?" John glared at her, looking murderous.

Mason slammed the table and glared at John. "Sit down. If you can't keep quiet, then get out."

Mason's anger shut John up, but he kept staring coldly at Isabella, who ignored him.

"Mr. Williams, the woman John truly loves is my cousin Bianca. They've been together for a long time. Instead of forcing us into a loveless marriage, let them be together," Isabella said, looking at Mason.

Mason turned to John with a frown, "Is what Isabella said true?"

John stayed silent, but Isabella spoke up first.

"You better tell the truth to your grandfather and swear it. If you lie, Bianca will die tomorrow," Isabella said, tilting her head with a cold smile.

John glared at Isabella with angry eyes but didn't say a word. Isabella brushed off his look and turned to Mason, asking, "Isn't there another elder coming today?" 

Mason glanced out the door. "He went to the bathroom; he should be back soon."

Meanwhile, Michael had read all of Isabella's messages and now, in the bathroom, he was certain that his new wife was John's fiancée. 'So, after being betrayed by your fiancé, you're trying to get close to his uncle? If that's your intention, it's pretty foolish,' he thought, a sneer creeping onto his face as a mischievous idea began to form.

He imagined the look on John's face when he found out his fiancée had married him. "My poor nephew," Michael muttered, shaking his head as he walked out of the restroom.
###chapter 6 John Gets Beaten Up

Facing Isabella's pressure, John kept his mouth shut. He couldn't betray Bianca, not when he loved her so much.

Mason, sharp as ever, picked up on John's silence. He quickly figured out the truth, likely close to what Isabella had hinted at.

"Have you two slept together?" Mason suddenly asked, eyeing John.

John shook his head right away. Bianca was still recovering, and he hadn't been with her like that.

Mason's face softened a bit. He drummed his fingers on the table and said, "Since you two haven't slept together, it means things are still early between you. I've seen how Isabella feels about you over the years. She really likes you. I hope you feel the same."

Isabella's face changed. She was already married and had planned to tell Mason about it.

"I'm not getting involved in your issues. You young folks need to sort this out yourselves. Once you do, I'll set the wedding date. Let's wrap up today's dinner." Mason said, getting up and leaving the room.

As soon as Mason left, John grabbed Isabella by the neck.

"You witch, what are you trying to pull? Think you can take me on just because of my grandpa? Don't forget, you're just an outsider, and I'm his real grandson." John's eyes blazed with anger.

Isabella struggled to breathe under John's grip. Her hand brushed against a bottle on the table, ready to grab it, but she let it go, tears streaming down her face.

Seeing her cry, John thought she was scared. He sneered, "Weren't you all high and mighty just now? What's the matter, scared now?"

Suddenly, there was a whooshing sound behind John, followed by a sharp pain in his back.

John let go of Isabella, falling to the side as the pain made him cry out.

"Mr. Williams," Isabella cried, hiding behind Mason.

John was shocked to see Mason back and blurted out, "Grandpa, why are you back?"

Mason was shaking with anger. He gripped his cane tightly, raised it high, and brought it down on John.

"If I hadn't come back for my phone, were you planning to strangle your fiancée?" Mason yelled, hitting John with each word.

Isabella felt a rush of satisfaction, like drinking ice-cold water in a scorching desert. Every scream from John was music to her ears.

After about twenty strikes, Mason's swings slowed. Isabella, noticing he was getting tired, rushed to help him sit down.

"Mr. Williams, calm down. Don't let this get to you." Isabella said, pouring him a glass of water.

"Sorry, Isabella. I didn't think that jerk John would pull something like that. You head home first; I need to teach him a lesson." Mason patted Isabella's arm and had his bodyguard escort her out.

Isabella didn't argue. She just reminded Mason to go easy on John before happily leaving the room.

On her way out of the restaurant, Isabella asked the bodyguard about John's uncle.

"Unfortunately, he left before you got here," the bodyguard replied.

Feeling great, Isabella declined the bodyguard's offer to take her home. She wanted to enjoy a walk instead.

Just as she stepped out of LuxeHaven Retreat, she spotted a familiar face-Michael. He saw her too and waved.

"Hey, what are you doing here? Grabbing dinner too?" Isabella ran over, grinning.

To her surprise, Michael just stared at her, frowning like he was deep in thought.

"Do you know who I am?" Michael asked, looking her straight in the eyes.

Isabella nodded, and Michael's expression darkened.

"Aren't you just a company employee? Is your company having a get-together here?" Isabella looked around, curious if she could spot any of Michael's colleagues.

Michael kept his eyes on her, trying to figure out if she was lying.

"Do you really think I'm just a lowly employee?" Michael lowered his head, his sharp gaze cutting through her.

Isabella tilted her head, studying him. Finally, she leaned in and whispered, "I've always thought you had this aura that doesn't fit a regular company employee."

Michael raised an eyebrow, clearly interested in what she'd say next.

"You have this vibe like a high-ranking exec or a movie star. I haven't seen you on TV, so you're not an actor. You wouldn't happen to be a top stripper at some club, would you?" Isabella asked, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.

Michael's face turned dark. He was now sure Isabella had no clue about his real identity, but he definitely wasn't a stripper!

"I'm just a regular company employee who works out a lot, so I might seem different. But I'm definitely not a stripper!" Michael said seriously.

"Okay, okay, I was just kidding. I actually think you're a big star." Isabella shrugged.

Michael furrowed his brow, sensing a hint of disappointment in her voice.

"Ms. Taylor, there's something I need to tell you. Let's cancel our engagement and finalize the divorce tomorrow." Michael's words made Isabella freeze.

###chapter 7 Beating Banica

"Alright, let's set up an appointment and get the divorce papers signed tomorrow," Isabella said, her face calm as ever.

Isabella figured Michael must've found out about her fling with John at LuxeHaven Retreat, so he wanted out of this mess.

Michael kept asking if she knew who he really was, probably to remind her he was just a regular guy who couldn't mess with John's powerful family.

Isabella took Michael's divorce request in stride, which threw him off for a second. Now he was sure she had no clue about his true identity.

"Okay, see you tomorrow," Michael said, turning to leave.

Isabella watched him go, sighing. Marrying Michael felt like a spur-of-the-moment rebellion fueled by anger.

"Ending this is probably for the best. At least he won't have to worry about John and his family coming after him," Isabella shrugged. Still, getting married and divorced in less than a day left her feeling pretty uneasy.

She felt that when she was in a bad mood, she needed to vent it out.

Isabella suddenly remembered Bianca was in the hospital, so she hopped in her car and headed there.

She knew the hospital well, not because of Bianca, but because Amelia's mom was also a patient there. Sometimes, Isabella would help take care of her.

When she got to the hospital, Isabella made a beeline for the luxury ward. Knowing how John felt about Bianca, there was no way she'd be in a regular room.

Just as Isabella reached Bianca's ward, she heard a bunch of people inside buttering Bianca up. 

"Ms. Taylor, Mr. Williams really loves you! Look at this jewelry and the fancy dinner. I could never afford this stuff in my lifetime."

"Indeed, Ms. Taylor are about to become Mrs. Williams soon."

Bianca soaked up the praise, lifting her chin proudly. "Of course, John only loves me."

"A pet gets a few pats from its owner and thinks it's the favorite. Bianca, how are you any different?" Isabella walked in, arms crossed, glaring at Bianca with a sneer.

Bianca's face twisted like she'd just bitten into a lemon when she saw Isabella.

"Isabella, I know you think I stole John, but even if you two were together, how long could a loveless marriage last?" Bianca pouted, playing the victim.

Seeing Bianca's fake pitiful act made Isabella's stomach churn. She felt like throwing up.

"Besides us, the only people here are your suck-ups. Who are you putting on this show for?" Isabella's lips curled into a cold smile.

Bianca's face darkened, realizing she didn't need to keep up the act.

"I already told Mr. Williams I want to break off the engagement with John," Isabella said, making Bianca's eyes widen.

But then Isabella added, "But Mr. Williams didn't agree. He said if John keeps messing around with you, he'll break his legs. He also said the only person John can marry is me. You will never get into their family."

Bianca's face went pale.

"If you don't believe me, you'll see tomorrow. Mason caused all those injuries on John. It's really pathetic, his miserable state. I almost want to hire an artist to paint it." Isabella laughed, making Bianca feel humiliated and furious.

"Grab that bitch Isabella for me, I want to tear her mouth apart," Bianca ordered the bodyguards.

The bodyguards moved towards Isabella, but she didn't flinch.

As they approached, Isabella sneered, "You must be the Williams Family's bodyguards, right? Don't forget, I'm currently John's fiancée, appointed by Mr. Williams himself. Can you handle his wrath?"

The bodyguards hesitated, their expressions uncertain.

Seeing them pause, Bianca screamed, "What are you waiting for? Grab Isabella! John only loves me!"

The bodyguards were stuck. They were supposed to protect Bianca, but Isabella had a point. They couldn't afford to anger Mason, but they also couldn't cross John.

'Damn, why did we have to get stuck in this mess?' they thought.

Suddenly, the sound of a slap echoed through the ward, making the bodyguards flinch.

Bianca clutched her face, staring at Isabella in disbelief. Isabella had slapped her hard, leaving a red mark on her cheek. Grabbing Bianca's hair, Isabella pulled her close.

In a cold tone, Isabella said, "Listen, you bitch. Even though I don't love John anymore, he's just trash I've thrown away. Only you would treat that bastard like a treasure."

She let go of Bianca's hair.

"Something's missing," Isabella mused, then slapped Bianca on the other cheek.

Looking at the red marks on both sides of Bianca's face, Isabella nodded in satisfaction.

"I have OCD. It looks more symmetrical this way. Much better." Isabella smiled, then turned and left, feeling pleased.

As she walked out, Bianca's screams echoed behind her.

###chapter 8 She Disappeared

After leaving the hospital, Isabella headed home and called up Amelia to fill her in on the day's events.

"That's awesome! You should've done this ages ago. Give 'em a good lesson," Amelia said, clearly thrilled about Isabella's newfound resolve.

After sharing the good news, Isabella mentioned she was planning to get a divorce the next day.

Amelia felt bad about Isabella's short-lived marriage but stood by her decision.

Night fell, a bar perched on the rooftop. Michael held a glass of wine, gazing at the lights below.

His buddy, Benjamin White, walked over with his own glass of wine.

"I heard you got hitched. Is the bride a looker?" Benjamin teased.

Michael pulled out his phone and casually showed Benjamin a photo of Isabella.

"Wait a sec! She looks familiar. Isn't she John's fiancée?" Benjamin said, stunned.

Michael nodded. "I had no clue who she was at first."

Benjamin burst out laughing. "No way! You actually married John's fiancée?"

He laughed so hard he almost cried. Michael shot him a fierce glare, and Benjamin finally stopped.

Michael took a sip of his wine and said, "Tomorrow, we're getting a divorce. This ridiculous marriage ends."

"She's gorgeous. Are you really gonna let her go?" Benjamin asked.

Michael thought of Isabella's calm demeanor, like a princess in that big chimney.

He hesitated for a moment but then firmly replied, "I hate drama."

Benjamin shrugged, raised his glass, and said, "Well, Michael, here's to your happy divorce. Too bad I have surgery tomorrow; otherwise, I'd totally hang out with you."

"I'm not sad; I don't need your company," Michael rolled his eyes and walked away from the rooftop with his glass of wine.

The next morning, Isabella left home to head to City Hall. She had to stick to the agreement with Michael.

"Weird, why won't the car start?" Isabella tried several times, but the car just wouldn't start.

Just then, a taxi passed by her apartment. Isabella flagged it down and got in.

She didn't notice the driver was wearing a mask and kept glancing at her through the rearview mirror.

After she told him her destination, the driver started the car. But halfway there, Isabella realized they weren't heading to City Hall.

When she tried to ask the driver what was going on, he suddenly stopped the car, lunged from the driver's seat with a handkerchief, pressed it against her face, and made her pass out.

Isabella struggled, trying to open the door, but her strength faded, and she lost consciousness.

Meanwhile, Michael had arrived at City Hall. He checked his watch, frowning because Isabella was nowhere in sight.

For some reason, Michael felt a knot in his stomach, so he called Isabella.

Her phone was ringing like crazy in the back seat of the taxi, but she was already out cold and couldn't answer. The driver had no intention of helping either.

The driver sped towards the hospital, where a medical team and a gurney were waiting.

Michael stared at his phone, feeling more and more uneasy. Little did he know, Isabella was already handcuffed to a hospital bed and being wheeled into the operating room.

Just as Michael was debating whether to go look for Isabella, he saw a crowd of people surrounding a young man heading his way.

"Mr. Williams, are you really going to finalize the marriage contract with Ms. Taylor today?"

"Rumors say there's a rift between you and Ms. Taylor. Is that true?"

"Mr. Williams, where did the injury on your wrist come from? Can you tell us?"

Reporters swarmed John as he walked towards City Hall, and Michael quickly ducked into a corner.

'Why is John here?' Michael wondered.

John walked towards City Hall, looking annoyed by the reporters' questions. He didn't want to marry Isabella today, but Mason had ordered it.

In the hospital's operating room, Isabella briefly regained consciousness and saw Bianca.

'Bianca? Is she trying to take my kidney by force? I can't believe John would go this far. He's a madman!' Fear gripped Isabella, but she quickly realized something was off.

Bianca wasn't in surgical scrubs but regular patient clothes. If she really wanted Isabella's kidney, she'd be lying in bed, not standing there.

'Bianca is deceiving me, deceiving everyone. She doesn't need a kidney transplant. Is she trying to kill me?' Isabella was terrified by her own thoughts, realizing just how malicious Bianca was.

"Dr. White, the patient is ready." A group of people surrounded a male doctor in surgical attire.

Benjamin entered the operating room and frowned when he saw Bianca standing there without any protective gear.

"Who is this woman? How did she get in here? This is a surgery, not a circus!" Benjamin's angry voice startled everyone.

Bianca looked annoyed at Benjamin. She was only there to watch Isabella die on the operating table.

"Dr. White, actually, I'm in charge of today's surgery. You just need to observe and make sure nothing goes wrong," another doctor said coldly.

Benjamin furrowed his brow, sensing something was off. There was a big problem with today's surgery!

"Alright, let's get started then." Benjamin nodded, still trying to figure out what was going on. He planned to keep a close eye on things.

As Benjamin approached the operating table and saw Isabella's face clearly, his eyes widened in shock.

###chapter 9 Angry Michael

When Benjamin saw Isabella, he instantly knew it was a setup against her.

"Hold up. I gotta call the guy who hired me for this surgery. Just remembered he specifically asked for me. Need to double-check," Benjamin said, then walked out of the operating room.

Once outside, he quickly dialed Michael's number.

As soon as Michael picked up, Benjamin blurted out, "Michael, where are you?"

An irritated voice came through the phone, "Didn't I tell you last night that I wanted a divorce? Where do you think I'd be?"

"Are you kidding me? Your wife's been kidnapped, and you're talking about a divorce!" Benjamin snapped.

"I'll send you the location. Get here ASAP. Isabella's on the operating table, and someone's trying to hurt her. I'll stall as long as I can." With that, Benjamin sent the location and rushed back into the operating room. Michael, seeing the message, immediately thought of an "organ transplant." His face darkened, and he sped off in his car.

When Benjamin got back, his heart sank. The surgery had already started. This was definitely a setup.

"What the hell are you doing? Did you just evolve from a monkey? Why are your hands shaking? Been partying too hard? And why's your forehead sweating like that? This is the worst surgery I've ever seen. Move over; let me handle this." Benjamin berated the lead surgeon and the staff, trying to buy time.

Finally, the lead surgeon had enough.

"Dr. White, I know you're a big deal, but stop messing with my surgery. If you keep this up, I'll have to ask you to leave." The lead surgeon glared at Benjamin from behind his mask.

Benjamin shot back, "If you kick me out, I promise no hospital will ever let you touch a scalpel again."

The room went ice-cold, and everyone felt the tension.

Suddenly, the lead surgeon's hand slipped, and the monitors blared.

Blood gushed from Isabella's wound.

"You idiot, you're killing her!" Benjamin yelled, punching the lead surgeon in the nose and kicking him away from the table.

The lead surgeon lunged at Benjamin, but just then, the door flew open.

Michael stormed in, looking ready to kill, and grabbed the lead surgeon by the collar.

"Michael, get him out of here! Isabella's bleeding out; I need to finish this surgery. Don't distract me," Benjamin barked.

Michael's heart pounded as he glanced at Isabella. He dragged the lead surgeon out of the room, leaving Benjamin to save her.

A few minutes later, Michael's crew finally showed up at the hospital. Michael was outside the operating room, his foot planted on the bruised and unconscious lead surgeon.

Michael lifted his foot and, with a cold stare, said, "Interrogate him thoroughly. I want to know who's behind this."

His guys nodded and dragged the lead surgeon away like he was a sack of potatoes, heading to an empty ward.

Once they were gone, Michael's eyes stayed glued to the operating room door. He couldn't shake the image of Isabella's pale face, drained from all the blood loss.

Right now, all Michael could do was hope Benjamin's top-notch skills would pull Isabella through.

The operating room door swung open, and a nurse rushed out. "Are you Mr. Williams?"

Michael jumped up. "Yeah, how's it going in there?"

"Dr. Benjamin said the patient's bleeding a lot and needs more blood bags. The hospital's running low, but he said you could handle it." The nurse eyed Michael curiously, clearly wondering who he was.

Michael stepped aside, pulled out his phone, and started making calls. He already knew Isabella's blood type from his earlier investigations. He had his people contact every nearby hospital to send over blood bags ASAP.

That day, folks were baffled to see a bunch of ambulances from different hospitals all heading to the same place.

Thanks to Michael's quick action, Isabella's life was saved.

Not long after, Michael's crew came back with the interrogation results.

"Mr. Williams, we got the info. This surgery wasn't for an organ transplant; it was a hit. The lead surgeon was ordered to make sure Mrs. Williams died on the table. Also, Mrs. Williams and Bianca's kidneys don't match." Hearing this, Michael's rage hit the roof.

His crew watched as Michael's phone bent and the screen started to crack under his grip.

"Mr. Williams, should I take care of the lead surgeon?" One of his guys made a shooting gesture, suggesting they off him.

This kind of thing wasn't new for Michael and his team. They usually dealt with enemies by burying them deep or dumping them in cement-filled barrels into the sea.

But this time, Michael had a different plan.

"Lock him up and treat his injuries. He'll be our best evidence," Michael said coldly.

His guy nodded and got to work.

The operating room door opened again, and Benjamin walked out. "Good thing I'm a damn good doctor. Isabella's gonna be fine. She just needs some rest now."

Michael didn't even look at Benjamin. His eyes were fixed on the surgical bed being wheeled out, with a tired-looking Isabella lying on it.

###chapter 10 Punishing Bianca

Isabella felt like she was stuck in this long, weird dream. There was this creepy river and a ferryman in raggedy gray robes who came up to her.

"Come on, Isabella, I'll take you to a place with no hate or worries," the ferryman said, reaching out his bony hand. It looked like just skin and bones, dry as a skeleton.

Something inside Isabella kept screaming at her not to get on the boat, but she couldn't control her body. She reached out to the ferryman anyway.

Just then, a voice shouted from behind her, "I'm here, and you can't take her away!"

Isabella snapped back to herself and turned around. She was shocked to see Michael running towards them, looking furious.

"What are you waiting for? Get on the boat!" The ferryman's voice turned nasty.

He grabbed Isabella's wrist with his icy hand, making her jump. When she looked back, the ferryman's face had morphed into Bianca's angry face.

"Let go of me! Let go!" Isabella struggled like crazy.

But the ferryman felt as heavy as a statue. Her body kept moving towards the boat.

"Go to hell, Isabella. Once you step on this boat, you're done for," the ferryman cackled.

Suddenly, Isabella felt a hand on her shoulder, pulling her back. She saw Michael kicking Bianca in the face, sending her flying into the river.

After that, Michael grabbed Isabella's shoulders, looking worried. "Isabella, are you okay? She's waking up. Benjamin, hurry up!"

The scene around Isabella changed. The river and boats vanished, replaced by a hospital room.

"What's wrong with me? Are my kidneys still there?" Isabella panicked, trying to touch her incision, but Michael stopped her.

"Don't worry, your kidneys are fine. I got here just in time. They only cut your skin and did some simple stitching," Michael said, trying to calm her down.

Finally, Benjamin walked in, checked her over, and nodded. "Now that she's awake, it's not serious. You can relax. She just needs some quiet time to recover." He winked at Michael and left the room.

It was their time now; no need for anyone else to hang around.

Michael gently touched Isabella's cheek. Her pale face felt cold, and it broke his heart.

"Sorry, looks like the divorce will have to wait," Isabella said, looking at Michael apologetically.

Michael shook his head with a smile. "I don't want a divorce now. Otherwise, I'd have to find another woman to deal with my dad, and that's too much hassle. At least you have good character and looks."

Isabella shook her head. "This time, it's John who's after me. His family's got serious power, not something you can mess with. Divorce is the safest bet for you. I thought they wouldn't go too far, but I was way too naive."

Michael patted her hand, trying to reassure her. "Don't worry, I'm not scared. I have a friend whose uncle is a congressman. John won't dare mess with me."

Seeing the determination in Michael's eyes, Isabella felt a warmth spread through her. She smiled. "Thank you. I owe you big time for saving me."

Michael was about to respond when he noticed his subordinate signaling him from outside the room.

"You rest up. I'll be right back." Michael patted her hand again, tucked her in, and stepped out.

"What's up?" Michael asked.

"Mr. Williams, John already knows about Mrs. Williams' marriage at City Hall," the subordinate reported seriously.

Michael narrowed his eyes and nodded. "Got it. Don't worry about him."

The subordinate continued, "And about Bianca. We found her at the hospital. Should we...?"

Bianca had wanted Isabella dead on the operating table, but the sight of blood freaked her out, so she bailed halfway through.

The subordinate made a shooting gesture, and Michael rolled his eyes.

"No need to deal with her. Let Isabella handle her own revenge," Michael said.

The subordinate nodded quickly. "Okay, Mr. Williams. We'll kidnap Bianca and lock her up. When Mrs. Williams recovers, she can take care of Bianca herself."

Michael smacked the back of his subordinate's head. "Don't always jump to thinking about killing!"

The subordinate scratched his head, finally getting that he had misunderstood Michael.

"So, we're really not doing anything?" the subordinate asked.

Michael's eyes narrowed. Doing nothing wasn't his style. He wanted Isabella to get her revenge, but he had to set the stage first.

Michael whispered a few instructions to the subordinate, who nodded and left. Michael then headed back to the room.

Not long after, Isabella, resting in bed, heard Bianca screaming from downstairs. "You can't treat me like this! John won't let you get away with it! This is the Williams Family's hospital! Why are you kicking me out?"

"What's going on?" Isabella struggled to sit up.

Michael had a wheelchair ready. He lifted her from the bed and placed her in it.

He pushed Isabella to the window, and they looked down.

Bianca, dressed in hospital gown, was dumped at the hospital entrance. Despite her screams, no one came to her aid, as onlookers stared at her with indifference.

###chapter 11 Screaming Bianca

Isabella stood there, totally stunned.

"Why'd they kick Bianca out of the hospital? No one messes with John's girl, right?" Isabella mumbled, scratching her head.

In the room, it was just Isabella and Michael. She always thought Michael was just some regular middle manager at the company, no way he'd know anything about the Williams Family.

Michael's eyes flickered open a bit. He didn't bother answering because he knew Isabella wasn't really looking for one.

"How about I peel an apple for you to munch on while you watch?" Michael said, heading over to the fruit basket. He grabbed an apple and started peeling it, nice and slow.

Isabella glanced over at Michael. His fingers were long and steady, and the apple peel came off in one long, unbroken strip.

"Didn't think you'd be so good at peeling apples," Isabella said, turning back to watch Bianca.

Michael smirked a little. Peeling apples wasn't the only thing he was good at.

Outside the hospital, Bianca was fuming, yelling her head off, but no one was paying her any mind.

"Do you even know who I am? I'm John's girlfriend! How dare you kick me out! You ready to face John's wrath?" Bianca screamed, pulling out her phone to call John.

But to her horror, she couldn't get through to him.

"Why is this happening? John, pick up! They're bullying me!" Bianca cried, hitting redial over and over.

Little did she know, John was already at city hall, finding out about Isabella's marriage from the staff.

John, furious, demanded to know who Isabella got the license with and asked for his records, but was denied due to insufficient clearance.

John thought, even if he didn't love Isabella, everyone knew she was supposed to marry him.

But now, Isabella had suddenly gotten married, making a fool out of him in front of everyone.

John tried calling Isabella, forgetting she was in surgery and couldn't answer. In a fit of rage, he smashed his phone, missing Bianca's call.

Outside the hospital, someone watched the restless Bianca with a mocking gaze, fueling her agitation even more.

"Don't get too cocky. John's dad will definitely help me!" Bianca shouted, dialing Owen.

This time, the call went through. But when Bianca said her name, a cold voice replied, "I don't know any Bianca; you've got the wrong number."

Bianca had the call on speaker, so everyone heard it loud and clear.

Her face went pale. Whoever had laughed at the hospital entrance had started a chain reaction, and now everyone was laughing.

Isabella, by the window, chuckled too, but then winced as her wound started to hurt from laughing too hard.

"Stop laughing for a bit; you don't want to reopen that wound," Michael said, handing Isabella the peeled apple.

"Thanks, but seeing her like this is just too satisfying," Isabella replied, taking small bites of the apple.

"I won't let you off! I definitely won't let you off!" Bianca was losing it, screaming at everyone outside.

Suddenly, Bianca looked up and saw Isabella munching on an apple by the window.

"Isabella, why aren't you dead yet? Did you do this? Did you have me thrown out of the hospital? You think John will fall for you like this, you bitch?" Bianca shrieked.

Isabella's mood soured. The apple didn't taste sweet anymore. She wanted to snap back, but every time she tried, her wound ached.

Suddenly, Isabella saw a ring of apple peel land squarely on Bianca's face.

Bianca was stunned. When she realized it was apple peel, she got even angrier.

"Isabella, you bitch! First, you splashed food on me, now you're throwing fruit! What makes you think you deserve to be Mrs. Williams?" Bianca yelled, throwing the peel back, but it fell short by six feet.

Isabella ignored Bianca's tantrum and turned to Michael, amazed.

"Did you just drop the apple peel?" Isabella asked, surprised. The angle formed between Bianca's position and Michael's standing spot required a precise maneuver to accurately toss the soft apple peel onto Bianca's face.

Michael shrugged, gently touching Isabella's hair. "I'm a gentleman. I wouldn't do something as rude as throwing apple peel at Bianca."

Michael's serious face made Isabella laugh, but she quickly stopped to avoid hurting her wound.

"Then where did the apple peel go? I bet it's not in the trash," Isabella said, curious.

Michael grinned. "I ate it, obviously. Apple peels are full of vitamin C. That's why I look this good."

Isabella couldn't help but laugh again.

Down below, Bianca saw Isabella ignoring her, chatting and laughing with someone, which made her even angrier.

"Isabella, you bitch! I'll kill you! I swear I'll kill you!" Bianca kept screaming.

Suddenly, a car pulled up, and John jumped out.

Seeing John, Bianca burst into tears. "John, help me! I don't know why I got kicked out, and that bitch Isabella threw apple peel at me."

John looked up at the window, but Michael had already moved Isabella out of sight.

What shocked Bianca was John's response. "I'll take you to another hospital."

###chapter 12 The Charm of Men

Bianca was in a daze, barely able to grasp what John was saying. Her rock, her constant ally, was telling her to get out of here, and fast.

She wanted to know why, but John wasn't giving her any answers. Instead, he just scooped her up and shoved her into the car.

John was pretty rattled himself. One of his guys had just handed him a new phone and mentioned Bianca's situation at the hospital.

John was very angry, just as he was about to call her to find out what was going on, Owen's call came in.

"Why haven't you sorted out Bianca yet? She even called me! Don't forget what your grandfather told you!" Owen barked before hanging up.

John's face twisted in frustration. He was worried Mason might have found out about the kidney swap for Isabella. But then he figured if Mason knew, it wouldn't be Owen calling.

Taking it as a warning from Owen, John decided to get Bianca out of the hospital and move her somewhere else.

Isabella had left before John showed up, missing the chance to see his sour face.

With Michael's help, Isabella settled back into bed. Giving Bianca a hard time had lifted her spirits and worn her out, making her feel sleepy.

With Michael by her side, Isabella drifted off.

Michael watched her sleep, a slight smile on her face.

'Why do I feel happy when she's happy? Have I really fallen for her?' he wondered, gently touching the back of her hand.

Michael still wouldn't admit he had feelings for Isabella. He saw it as part of his duty in their marriage.

Looking at her hand, he seemed to remember something. He pulled out a beautiful bracelet from his pocket. The emerald bracelet was flawless, carved from a natural gemstone. It could fetch a high price in any jewelry store.

Michael slipped the bracelet onto Isabella's wrist.

When she woke up, she quickly noticed it.

"What's this?" she asked, surprised, looking at Michael.

"It's a gift. Do you like it? I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you. Even though you weren't in danger, you still got hurt," Michael said with a smile.

"I told you, it's not your fault. You don't need to give me a gift to apologize," Isabella said, trying to take off the bracelet, but Michael stopped her.

"Let me do something for you, okay?" he said seriously.

Isabella looked at him, his eyes shining as brightly as the bracelet.

She pursed her lips and nodded. This time, she didn't take off the bracelet, but she decided she'd give Michael a gift of equal value in return.

Michael then grabbed an apple from the fruit basket.

"What's next? Are you going to tell John's grandfather about this?" he asked as he started peeling the apple.

Isabella let out a deep sigh, staring up at the ceiling. "What's the point in telling him? At best, John might get locked up or get a good beating from Mr. Williams. But as that jerk John said, he's the heir to the Williams Family. I almost lost my life, and he still gets to live his. I don't have any good feelings towards the Williams Family anymore, except for Mr. Williams."

Michael was peeling an apple when his hand suddenly shook, causing the peel to fall to the ground with a soft thud, catching Isabella's attention.

She looked at Michael, who seemed a bit off, and laughed. "What are you doing? I was talking about the Williams Family. Not everyone with the last name Williams is the same. You're just an ordinary company employee."

Michael paused for a couple of seconds before laughing along. "Yeah, it's just a shame the apple peel can't be eaten."

He continued peeling the apple, but now he was slower and less efficient.

After a moment of laughter, Isabella got serious. "To really get revenge, I need to build up my power. I have to pull together what's left of my family's strength and help them rise again. Only then will I be able to take on John."

Michael looked at her, curious. "Are you that confident?"

Isabella nodded with a smile. "A drowning man will clutch at a straw. There's still life in the old dog yet. My family might be in decline, but we still have a solid foundation!"

Michael stayed silent for a couple of seconds. He knew the truth about the Taylor Family's finances-they weren't as strong as Isabella thought. Her parents had been hiding things from her.

"I'll help you. Legally speaking, I am your husband," Michael said with a smile, handing her the peeled apple.

Isabella nodded gratefully, finding the apple in her hand to be very sweet.

She stayed in the hospital for about a week, and after some rest, she was finally able to walk again.

On the day she was discharged, she got a call from her friend Amelia.

"You must be having a great time with your new husband these days, right? I feel like you've almost forgotten about me, your good friend," Amelia teased with a hint.

Not wanting Amelia to worry, Isabella lied and said she had been traveling out of town with Michael during her hospital stay.

"Of course, I haven't forgotten you. Actually, I have something to discuss. Let's meet up," Isabella said, mentioning a location and heading there directly.

They met at the most famous jewelry store in the city.

Isabella didn't waste time chatting. She showed Amelia the bracelet Michael had given her.

"Is this the bracelet your husband gave you? It's gorgeous. Men are at their best when they're giving gifts," Amelia said, gently touching the bracelet and sighing.

"Amelia, let's get this bracelet appraised here. I want to know its value," Isabella stated. She needed to know the bracelet's worth so she could give Michael a gift of equal value.

###chapter 13 A Bet

Isabella and Amelia strolled into the swankiest jewelry store in the city, where many wealthy individuals had custom jewelry made, as it was also the most authoritative gem appraisal institution.'

As soon as they told the staff why they were there, the head honcho appraiser was called in right away.

The staff were sharp. The moment they saw Isabella, they connected the dots to the Williams Family, the biggest name in the city, and knew they had to be on their A-game.

"Mrs. Taylor, please show me the jewelry you want appraised," the appraiser said, gesturing politely.

Isabella slipped off her bracelet and handed it over. The appraiser carefully placed it on a soft pad and got to work.

Under the light, the emerald bracelet seemed to glow faintly.

But then, an irritating voice cut through the air. "Well, if it isn't Isabella from the Taylor Family. Has your family fallen so low that you're here to sell jewelry to make ends meet?"

Isabella and Amelia turned to see a woman with permed hair. She was pretty, but her words were like daggers.

"Pearl, I think it's best if we end this conversation now." Isabella shot back, giving Pearl Brown a cold look.

Pearl was from the Brown Family, who had taken the Taylor Family's spot among the city's elite. Isabella couldn't stand the Browns, especially after her family's downfall.

Pearl's face twisted with anger at Isabella's retort.

"I heard John's into Bianca now. How sad for you! Did he cut you off, so now you're selling jewelry to get by?" Pearl sneered, thinking she'd hit a nerve. Little did she know, Isabella couldn't care less about John anymore.

"I'm just here to get this piece appraised. If you've got nothing better to do, back off," Isabella disdainfully remarked.

"You!" Pearl spat, but her bodyguard quickly held her back.

Pearl remembered she couldn't afford to lose her cool. The Brown Family, now one of the top families, was under scrutiny for their lack of class. They were trying hard to appear more refined in public.

Taking a deep breath, Pearl put on a haughty expression and looked at Isabella.

"How could the Taylor Family still have such treasures? I bet it's a fake, and you fell for it," Pearl smirked.

Isabella didn't want to waste her breath on Pearl, but Amelia couldn't hold back.

"Pearl, have you forgotten how your Brown Family used to grovel when the Taylor Family was on top?" Amelia's words hit a nerve.

The Browns had indeed relied on the Taylors in the past. Their rise was seen as a betrayal, and they hated being reminded of it.

Pearl noticed people were starting to watch, so she quickly switched gears. "Alright, Isabella, how about a bet? I say that bracelet's a fake. If I win, you both have to kneel and apologize to me."

"And if we win?" Isabella shot back, turning to face Pearl.

Pearl almost blurted out, "How could I lose?" but with all eyes on her, she had to think twice.

"If I lose, then I..." Pearl hesitated. The thought of kneeling and apologizing to Isabella, someone she loathed, was unbearable.

Isabella smirked, letting Pearl stew for a moment. "If you lose, you owe me $10 million. Deal?"

Pearl was stunned but quickly agreed, confident she wouldn't lose.

Amelia pulled Isabella aside, whispering, "Are you sure about this? What if the bracelet's fake? Are you really gonna apologize to that witch Pearl?"

Isabella patted Amelia's hand, smiling. "I trust my husband. He wouldn't lie to me."

Amelia rolled her eyes, still skeptical. She couldn't understand Isabella's faith in Michael, especially since they hadn't known each other long.

Isabella and Pearl stood by the appraiser, waiting for the verdict.

After a thorough examination, the appraiser gently placed the bracelet back on the pad.

"After careful appraisal, this bracelet is authentic and an antique," he announced seriously.

Isabella's face lit up with a smile, while Pearl's turned anxious.

"No way. How could this shabby bracelet be real? Are you lying to me? Are you scared of the Williams Family?" Pearl accused, glaring at the appraiser.

The appraiser frowned. "Ms. Brown, are you questioning my integrity? I swear, this bracelet is genuine. It's over 100 years old and worth around $40 million. "

Pearl was speechless. No one doubted the appraiser's word; he was renowned and deeply religious.

Amelia couldn't help but laugh at Pearl's sour expression. "A $10 million bet, huh? So, Ms. Brown, card or cash?"

Pearl's face darkened. "I don't have that kind of money on me. Give me a few days."

"Trying to dodge payment? No way. You need to write an IOU," Amelia insisted, giving Isabella a nudge.

"Does the Brown Family have no integrity?" Pearl snapped, glaring at them.

Isabella looked at Pearl coolly, then turned to the appraiser.

"Sir, you heard our bet. Please be our witness," Isabella said.

The appraiser politely responded, "Ms. Taylor, if you decide to take legal action, I will testify."

###chapter 14 Art Comes from Life

Pearl walked out, feeling all eyes on her like she was the main act. She was way too embarrassed to stick around in the jewelry store.

Amelia and Isabella were both grinning ear to ear.

"Today was awesome, right? While you were gone, Pearl was trash-talking you everywhere. Let's see if she dares to open her mouth now," Amelia said, pumping her fist in excitement.

Isabella nodded, but her eyes were fixed on the bracelet on her wrist, looking puzzled.

"My husband doesn't seem like he's loaded. How did he get this bracelet?" Isabella wondered out loud.

Amelia grabbed Isabella's arm, gently stroking the emerald bracelet. "Maybe your husband's secretly rich and just pretending to be a regular guy to live a normal life."

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Have you been binge-watching too many TV dramas? Stuff like that only happens in novels."

Amelia, dead serious, replied, "Art imitates life. If it didn't happen in real life, why would it be in TV shows? Or you could just call and ask him."

"Why don't you say I found an injured old man on the road, took him to the hospital, and he turned out to be a hidden billionaire? And since he has no kids, he decided to leave all his money to me because I saved him?" Isabella laughed. If such a chance existed, she might as well buy a lottery ticket; at least her odds of winning would be better.

"Just call him and find out. Why are you stalling?" Amelia pushed Isabella to make the call.

Isabella, feeling cornered, finally dialed Michael's number.

Michael was in a meeting when his phone buzzed in his pocket. Everyone in the room looked surprised.

What shocked them even more was when Michael saw who was calling, he smiled and stepped out to take the call.

"What's going on? Mr. Williams usually hates answering calls during work," someone whispered.

"I heard Mr. Williams got married. Maybe it's his wife?" another person guessed, hitting close to the truth.

"When did that happen? Spill the details," someone else chimed in, and soon the whole room was buzzing with gossip.

Michael stepped out to answer the call, and to his surprise, Isabella asked if he was secretly a millionaire.

Michael didn't answer right away. Instead, he asked why she thought that.

"I took the bracelet you gave me to a jewelry appraiser today," Isabella paused, worried Michael might get the wrong idea.

"I wanted to know its value so I could get you a gift of equal worth, but the appraiser said it's worth 40 million dollars. You know I don't have that kind of money," Isabella finished, sounding helpless.

When Michael heard she had the bracelet appraised, he felt a bit annoyed, thinking she doubted him.

But when he realized she wanted to buy him a gift of equal value, he couldn't help but laugh. "Did the appraiser tell you it's worth 40 million dollars and is an antique over a hundred years old?"

Isabella was taken aback. "How did you know? Is this bracelet real?"

Michael chuckled and shook his head. "I have a buddy who makes top-notch fake jewelry. Even the experts at big auction houses can't tell the difference. I had him whip up that gem, and the whole thing, including the custom fee, only cost me 4,000 bucks."

The massive price difference left Isabella intrigued about Michael's friend.

"Is your friend really that good? What other fakes has he made?" Isabella asked, genuinely curious.

Michael scratched his head. He'd spun a lie, and now he had to keep it going. He didn't actually have such a friend.

"I can't really get into that. Some of it's kinda illegal, and I don't want to risk losing my friend. So, did you call just to chat about this?" Michael quickly changed the subject.

Isabella picked up on his cue and switched gears. "Your bracelet really helped me out today, and I wanted to thank you. How about coming over to my place? I'll cook for you. Anything you want to eat?"

Michael was surprised by the invite. Even though they were married, they still lived separately and hadn't spent much time together.

"I'm not picky. As long as it's not terrible, I'll eat anything. Just make something you like," Michael said with a smile.

Michael's words left Isabella a bit stunned. She'd put so much effort into pleasing John, but he'd never asked her what she liked to eat.

"Okay, got it. I'll go grab the ingredients now," Isabella said, smiling, and hung up the phone.

"Amelia, come over for dinner tonight," Isabella said, looking at Amelia.

Amelia immediately shook her head. "You and your husband need some alone time; don't drag me into it! And keep it down tonight. If you don't want kids, remember to take precautions."

Amelia's words made Isabella's face turn bright red.

That evening, Isabella prepared a feast. As she brought the last dish to the table, there was a knock at the door, and Michael's voice called out.

"Here I am." Isabella opened the door to find Michael standing there.

Michael was holding a bottle of red wine. He brought it to the table, opened it, and the aroma filled the dining room.

Isabella didn't recognize the wine brand and assumed Michael had picked it up at the supermarket on his way over.

"This is amazing; I didn't know you could cook this well," Michael praised after taking a bite.

Isabella tasted the wine. It was excellent but also strong, making her cheeks flush.

"I heard you want to give me a gift of equal value. Have you picked one yet?" Michael teased, looking at Isabella.

Isabella shook her head. "I haven't decided what to give you yet."

"But I already know what I want," Michael said, suddenly standing up and walking over to her.

"What do you want me to give you?" Just as Isabella finished speaking, Michael suddenly bent down and kissed her on the lips.

###chapter 15 Suffocating Family

Isabella was caught off guard by Michael's sudden move and just froze, forgetting to push him away.

Her heart started pounding, and she felt her body heat up. When Michael's tongue tried to slip into her mouth, she quickly shoved him back.

"What the heck, Michael? We're just married on paper. Kissing wasn't part of the deal," Isabella said, blushing and looking at him with wide eyes.

Michael couldn't help but find her reaction adorable. He leaned back in his chair, grinning. "Look, even if this marriage is just for show, we gotta sell it. If we don't act like a real couple, people will get suspicious."

Isabella remembered that Michael's whole plan was to fool his dad. Did this mean he was planning to introduce her to him?

"Wait, are you actually gonna take me to meet your dad? What's he like? Is he easy to get along with?" Isabella asked, curiosity piqued.

Michael nodded. "Relax, my dad's a nice guy. He'll treat you as well as he treats his cat."

Isabella didn't quite get the cat comparison, but she let it slide. She just needed to play her part when the time came.

After dinner, they both pitched in to clean up the kitchen.

Michael helped her with the dishes, and for a moment, he felt like they were a real married couple.

'Do I actually have feelings for Isabella? No way, it's just because this is new to me. Yeah, that's gotta be it,' Michael thought, trying to push down any romantic feelings.

Once the kitchen was clean, they settled in the living room and turned on the TV.

Isabella picked a comedy, plopped down on the carpet with a bucket of popcorn, and laughed along with the movie.

Michael sat on the couch, but his eyes kept drifting to Isabella's face instead of the screen.

She looked so happy and carefree, a stark contrast to the first time he met her. Back then, she always seemed weighed down by something. But tonight, she seemed to have let go of that burden, even if just for a little while.

Isabella was genuinely happy today. Getting out of the hospital, winning the bet against Pearl, and even that unexpected kiss with Michael had all lifted her spirits.

However, when she was feeling happy, she was suddenly doused with cold water.

Halfway through the movie, Isabella's phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID and saw it was her mom, Mia.

She hesitated but answered the call, and Mia's angry voice came through the line."Isabella, why haven't you divorced yet? John came over today and gave your dad a hard time. Are you trying to ruin us?" Mia's voice was sharp and filled with anger.

The good vibes between Isabella and Michael vanished instantly because of that call.

Isabella's hand shook as she held the phone. "Mom, do you even know what John and Bianca did to me? They drugged me and dragged me to the hospital to steal my kidney. And guess what? My blood type doesn't even match Bianca's!"

"Of course, your blood types don't match," Mia's voice cut off suddenly. Isabella felt like she'd been punched in the gut.

"Mom, you knew? You knew Bianca didn't need a kidney and still let them do this to me? Do you know I almost died because of them?" Isabella's head spun, and she collapsed backward.

A strong arm caught her, pulling her into a comforting embrace.

"Isabella, we're doing this for the family. I know it's been tough, but can you hang in there? Marry John, and we'll fix everything," Mia's words shattered Isabella's last bit of hope.

Michael was disgusted. He grabbed the phone from Isabella and snapped at Mia, "You two don't deserve to be her parents. If you're so desperate to please the Williams Family, why don't you divorce your husband and marry John yourself? Maybe he'd go for an old hag like you."

Mia's voice turned frantic. "It's you! The bastard who took Isabella away! The Williams Family isn't something you can mess with. Divorce Isabella now!"

"Why don't you and your husband get divorced? If someone has to make a sacrifice, why not you? I'm sure your husband would happily send you to John's bed for the family's sake," Michael mocked before hanging up and turning off the phone.

"I feel sorry for you, having parents like that," Michael said, handing the phone back to Isabella.

Isabella lay on the couch, her eyes dull. "They used to be good to me. But now I see it was all conditional. I've been their puppet. Marrying you is the first taste of freedom I've had."

Her words seemed directed at Michael but also at herself.

Michael suddenly felt a deep pity for her.

Isabella wiped her tears and forced a smile. "Your place is far from the city center, right? Isn't it a hassle to commute? Why not stay here? It'll save you rent."

Michael shrugged. "No need; the commute's not bad."

Isabella's eyes dimmed. She just wanted him around more. Her family's betrayal left her feeling fragile.

The rest of the comedy movie didn't make them laugh. When it ended, Michael left and went back to his place in the city center.

Isabella had trouble sleeping and only dozed off as dawn approached. She was barely asleep when a knock on the door woke her.

"Michael? Did you forget something?" Isabella mumbled, still groggy as she opened the door. But when she saw who was there, she snapped awake.

Standing outside were her parents.

###chapter 16 Meet with John

Jasper and Mia shot daggers at Isabella.

Isabella instinctively took a step back but mustered up the courage to ask, "Dad, Mom, what are you doing here? I'm not marrying John."

Jasper exploded, pointing a finger at her. "Do you have any idea what you've done? Because of your stubbornness, John is pulling all his funding from the Taylor Family. Every single project we have is now on hold."

Isabella stood there, stunned. "Dad, what are you talking about? Have we been relying on the Williams Family all this time?"

Jasper was too furious to speak. Mia, on the other hand, looked down, clearly embarrassed because she knew exactly what Isabella was thinking.

Isabella took another step back, her face pale. She felt like her world was crumbling. She had plans to slowly rebuild the Taylor Family's companies and restore their former glory. This was the last thing she expected from her parents.

"Dad, you're such a disappointment. Grandpa left those companies so we could rise again, and you chose to depend on the Williams Family. You might as well hand over all our shares to John!" Isabella shouted, her eyes welling up with tears.

Jasper felt a pang of fear. He couldn't bring himself to meet Isabella's eyes, which were filled with anger and despair.

"If Grandpa were still alive, he'd give you a piece of his mind!" Isabella spat out before slamming the door shut.

Jasper felt a surge of anger and failure as both a father and a son. He couldn't accept it. He clenched his fists, ready to pound on the door again, but it suddenly opened. Isabella stood there in a coat.

"Aren't you supposed to take me to see John? Let's go." She locked the door behind her without even glancing at her parents and walked out.

"She has no respect for me. I'm her father!" Jasper fumed.

Mia grabbed his hand. "Enough, at least she's willing to meet John. That's what we wanted."

Jasper waved her off angrily. They hurried to catch up with Isabella, worried she might bolt.

Meanwhile, over at the Williams Group office, Michael and John were lounging on the sofa in the CEO's office, sipping tea.

John poured a cup for Michael and grinned. "Michael, when are you bringing your wife over to meet us? Grandpa's been dying to meet her."

Michael took a sip, raised an eyebrow, and smiled. "I'm not ready yet, but trust me, when she shows up, she'll turn heads."

"Is she that stunning? Now I'm really curious," John said eagerly.

Michael smirked to himself, thinking, 'You have no idea what's coming.'

Just then, John's assistant rushed in. "Mr. John Williams, Ms. Taylor and her parents are here."

John smirked. "Looks like my little threat worked. Can't wait to see the look on Isabella's face."

Michael glanced at John, got up from the sofa, and headed towards the lounge.

"I'm not interested in your drama. I'll excuse myself." Michael waved his hand dismissively, not giving John a chance to respond, and walked into the lounge.

John had his assistant bring Isabella in, then sat back down.

The assistant relayed John's message to Isabella and her parents.

Jasper, trying to be respectful, slightly bent over and asked the assistant, "I'm Isabella's father. Don't I have the right to enter John's office?"

The assistant glanced at Jasper and Mia, then impatiently waved his hand. "Mr. Williams said only Ms. Taylor is allowed in. Please, Ms. Taylor."

The assistant made an inviting gesture, and Isabella coldly chuckled at her parents. "The head of the Taylor Family, reduced to this. I wonder if Grandpa would be so mad he'd come back from the dead?"

Jasper was speechless with anger, while Isabella shot him a cold look and walked towards John's office.

When Isabella entered, John looked up at her. "I'm curious to see the guy you're marrying. He dares to steal my woman."

Isabella kept a straight face despite John's taunting.

"I'm not here for your nonsense, and I'm not divorcing." Isabella's words wiped the smirk off John's face.

John's expression turned cold. "You know your family's in deep trouble, and marrying me solves it. Why are you so stubborn?"

Isabella slammed her hands on the table, glaring at John. "Do you even know my blood type doesn't match Bianca's? She can't use my kidney, and she's trying to kill me!"

John frowned. "That's impossible. Bianca wouldn't do that."

Isabella laughed at John's ignorance. "You're really clueless. Is it so hard to do a simple compatibility test? Why believe Bianca's lies instead of checking yourself?"

John hesitated, realizing he had never done the test because he trusted Bianca. But soon, he looked up and smirked at Isabella. "I see, you've gotten clever."

Isabella frowned, not understanding his sudden change in tone.

"You know Bianca and I truly love each other. People in love trust each other. Asking me to take the test would make Bianca think I doubt her, causing problems between us. You've become quite cunning." John smirked, thinking he had figured out her game.

Michael, hiding in the lounge, listened to the conversation and felt speechless.

After a moment, Isabella resisted the urge to slap John and said, "Let's make a bet. If I win, you stay out of the Taylor Family's business and stop pressuring my parents!"

###chapter 17 The Bet with John

John's first thought after hearing Isabella was that she had lost her mind.

"Isabella, do you still think you're some kind of heiress? What makes you think you can negotiate with me?" John shot back, dripping with sarcasm.

Isabella leaned in, locking eyes with him. "If you don't agree to my terms, I'll tell your grandfather how you dragged me to the hospital. Have you thought about how he'll react?"

John's face twitched. The bruises from Mason's beating still throbbed.

"What do you want to bet?" John asked, his voice icy.

Isabella straightened up, her tone serious. "I've crunched the numbers. To keep the Taylor Family's remaining businesses afloat and pay the employees, we need 30 million dollars. If I can get that in a week, I can save them."

John chuckled. "Do you even know what 30 million dollars means? The old Taylor Family could've pulled that off, but now? Your dad probably can't even scrape together 10 million."

"I don't need his money. I can handle it," Isabella said, her voice brimming with confidence.

John sneered but then looked at her seriously. "Fine, you have a week. If you can't get the 30 million, then you'll have to get a divorce."

"Divorce isn't on the table, but I can give my kidney to Bianca. She wants it, right? Then you'll have to find the best hospital and doctor for the transplant." A wild look flashed in Isabella's eyes. She wanted to see if Bianca would dare to take her kidney, given their mismatched blood types.

After a moment's hesitation, John agreed. Saving Bianca was his top priority.

With John's agreement, Isabella left the CEO's office. But there was a little hiccup.

As she opened the door, Jasper and Mia, who had been eavesdropping, tumbled to the floor.

They'd heard about Isabella's 30 million dollar bet and thought she was being reckless. They tried to talk her out of it, but she shoved them aside.

"Mr. Williams, you shouldn't have agreed to her. Isabella's not thinking straight. Give me some time to talk to her," Jasper pleaded, but John was done and had security escort them out.

After Isabella and her family left, Michael emerged from the lounge.

"Michael, Isabella's changed a lot. Do you think it's because of her husband?" John asked, scratching his head.

Michael glanced at him and shook his head. "I don't know her well. But she's right about one thing."

"What's that?" John asked, confused.

Michael pointed to his head. "Your IQ is definitely questionable."

With that, Michael walked out, leaving John puzzled.

"Is he insulting me? My IQ is fine," John muttered, still not getting it.

After leaving the John's office, Isabella headed home and pulled out a thick address book. It was filled with contacts her grandfather had helped over the years. She planned to use these connections to borrow the 30 million dollars she needed.

But to her dismay, every time she mentioned borrowing money, the person on the other end would hang up immediately.

As her phone battery dwindled, she still hadn't secured a single dollar.

"Grandpa, if you can see this from heaven, you'd be so disappointed. Your kindness hasn't been repaid. Everyone's so selfish," Isabella muttered, staring out the window.

She dialed the last number in the book. It belonged to Eric Allen, the city's top electrical supplier, who had also been helped by her grandfather.

Meanwhile, in Eric's office, a scandalous scene was unfolding. Eric was sprawled in his chair, pants around his knees, while his secretary was on her knees, giving him a blowjob.

When his phone rang, he glanced at the number and hung up.

The secretary looked up, puzzled. Eric stroked her hair and chuckled coldly. "It's Isabella. Everyone knows about her bet with John. She must be calling to borrow money. I'm not risking John's wrath for her. But, you know, Isabella is pretty hot."

A lecherous look flashed in Eric's eyes as he imagined Isabella in place of his secretary. He grabbed her head and pushed it harder against him.

The secretary, struggling to breathe, slapped his thigh until he climaxed, releasing into her mouth before letting her go.

Just as Eric was pulling up his pants, his phone rang again. He looked at the number, surprised.

"John? Why's he calling me?" Eric frowned and quickly answered.

The conversation left him with a strange expression.

Back at Isabella's place, she was pondering her next move when there was a knock on the door.

She opened it to find Michael standing there.

"I heard about your situation. Do you have a plan to get the 30 million dollars?" Michael asked bluntly.

"Looks like John told everyone about our bet. They're all waiting for me to fail," Isabella shrugged, her face showing her frustration.

Michael could tell she hadn't had any luck borrowing the money.

"I can help you get the money. Just say the word, and I'll have 30 million dollars ready for you," Michael said seriously.

Isabella looked at him in surprise, then remembered Michael mentioning a friend who made counterfeit antiques. She misunderstood his offer.

"I appreciate your help, but we can't break the law. You've already done so much for me, and I don't want you ending up in jail," Isabella said, looking at him earnestly.

Michael's mouth twitched. He had no idea what she was thinking, but he knew she had misunderstood him completely.

###chapter 18 Malicious Eric

Michael was about to explain that he could actually get his hands on 30 million dollars, but right then, Isabella's phone buzzed in her pocket.

She picked up, and Eric's cheerful voice came through.

"Sorry, Ms. Taylor. I was in a meeting and missed your call. What's up?" Eric asked.

Isabella quickly filled him in about needing 30 million dollars, and to her surprise, Eric was all in.

"I've got 30 million. Your grandfather helped me out back in the day. Let's meet tonight, and I'll transfer the money to you," Eric said.

After hanging up, Isabella was thrilled. She finally had a way to get the money.

Michael, who had overheard the whole thing, frowned. "Isn't it weird? Everyone in our circle knows about your bet with John. Who's this Eric guy who can stand up to John?"

Michael's words were like a splash of cold water, cooling Isabella's excitement.

Taking a deep breath, Isabella thought it over. "You're right. It is suspicious. But Eric's my only shot right now. I'll be careful, thanks to your heads-up."

Seeing Isabella's determined look, Michael knew he couldn't change her mind. He just nodded, already forming his own plans.

After lunch at Isabella's place, Michael left and made a call.

"Get me everything you can on this Eric guy," he instructed his subordinate before hanging up. He needed to make sure Isabella stayed safe that night.

Meanwhile, in a hospital room, Bianca put down her phone, a malicious glint in her eyes.

"Isabella, this time I'll make you the joke of the town. Let's see if you still think you can join the Williams Family," Bianca muttered with a cold smile.

Just then, John walked in with some freshly washed fruit, and Bianca's expression softened instantly.

"Thanks for washing the fruit, John. I'll eat it all," Bianca said sweetly.

John smiled and nodded, then picked up his phone from beside Bianca.

"Did anyone call while I was washing the fruit?" he asked.

Bianca shook her head. "Nope, no calls."

John nodded and started peeling the fruit for Bianca, clueless about what she'd done with his phone while he was gone.

As night fell, Isabella dolled up with perfect makeup and her most stunning dress, heading to her meeting spot with Eric.

Eric was already waiting at the hotel entrance. He'd only seen Isabella a few times at parties, but this private meeting made him realize she was even more stunning up close.

Her flawless makeup, elegant neck, and red, form-fitting dress added a touch of allure to her natural beauty.

"Ms. Taylor, great to see you again. I've got dinner ready. Let's head to the private room and chat," Eric said, gesturing for her to follow him inside.

Not long after Isabella and Eric entered the hotel, Michael showed up, heading straight for the entrance.

Inside the private room, Eric popped open a bottle of top-notch red wine, filling the room with its rich aroma.

As they ate, Isabella brought up the 30 million dollars, but Eric kept dodging the topic.

"Ms. Taylor, let's not rush. I prefer not to mix business with pleasure. How about we finish our meal first? You've got a week, and today's just the first day," Eric said, sounding reasonable enough to Isabella.

Throughout the meal, Eric kept refilling Isabella's glass. The wine made her cheeks flush, giving her a rosy, alluring look.

"Mr. Allen, I think I've had enough to eat. Can we talk about the 30 million now?" Isabella said, rubbing her temples, looking like she might topple over any second.

Eric's eyes greedily roamed over Isabella. He even tried to help her up, saying, "Ms. Taylor, you seem a bit tipsy. Let me take you to a room upstairs to rest. We can talk when you're feeling better."

Isabella pushed him away. "I don't need your help. I can get upstairs on my own, and I'm not even drunk," she said, wobbling as she clung to the handrail and slowly made her way up.

Eric's desire burned as he watched her struggle. He wanted to scoop her up and rush her to the room, but with too many hotel staff around, he had to wait.

Finally, Isabella reached the second floor. Eric quickly led her to a room he had prepped and opened the door.

The room was dark, but when Eric flicked on the light, a camera pointed straight at the bed came into view.

"Ms. Taylor, you want 30 million dollars? Spend the night with me, and it's yours. No one else would pay that much," Eric said, ripping off his tie and lunging at her.

Just as he was about to grab her, Isabella whipped out a small stun gun and jabbed it into his side. The electric shock made Eric's body convulse uncontrollably.

Isabella, now stone-cold sober, glared at him. "Did you really think I'd drink alone with a guy like you without some kind of protection?" She cranked up the stun gun's power, making Eric collapse to the floor.

She crouched down, pressing the stun gun to his neck. "Spill it. What's your plan? If I zap you at this range, you could end up brain-damaged or paralyzed."

Terrified, Eric blurted out, "Ms. Taylor, calm down! It was John! He told me to rape you and take nude photos!"

Isabella frowned deeply; although John wasn't very bright, everyone in the city knew that Isabella was his fiancée, and he would never do anything to jeopardize the Williams family's reputation.

###chapter 19 Beating Up Eric

Isabella couldn't wrap her head around the idea that John would actually pull something like this. She figured someone must be using John's name to get Eric to do their dirty work.

"Are you sure it was John you talked to on the phone?" Isabella asked.

Eric shook his head. "It was a woman who called, but the number was definitely John's." Isabella's mind immediately went to Bianca, the only person who would have access to John's phone.

'Bianca must've known I'd hit up Eric for money, so she got to him first. That witch, I'll deal with her eventually.' A flash of anger crossed Isabella's face. Just then, there was a knock on the door.

Thinking it was one of his guys, Eric yelled, "Help, help me! I've been kidnapped, hurry!"

Panicking, Isabella tried to cover Eric's mouth, but the noise outside the door suddenly stopped.

The next moment, the door swung open. Michael walked in.

Isabella let out a sigh of relief seeing it was Michael.

Eric, not recognizing Michael, thought he was hotel staff and shouted again, "Quick, save me! This woman wants to zap me with a stun gun. I'll pay you a lot of money!"

Michael ignored Eric and turned to Isabella, looking concerned. "Are you hurt?"

Isabella shook her head.

"Are you nuts? I'm gonna report you to the hotel! Just 'cause she's a woman, you're taking her side? I'm the victim here!" Eric kept yelling from the floor.

Annoyed by Eric's noise, Michael kicked him hard in the mouth. Blood poured from Eric's mouth, and it was clear he lost a few teeth from the kick.

"John hired this moron to mess with you?" Michael questioned John's intelligence again.

Isabella quickly filled Michael in on Bianca using John's phone without permission. By now, Eric realized Isabella and Michael were in on this together.

"Step outside for a bit; I need to have a word with him," Michael said firmly, pushing Isabella out of the room and locking the door.

Now it was just Michael and Eric. Michael turned off the cameras, then walked over and lifted Eric up.

"This bank card has 30 million dollars on it. Later, you're gonna give it to Isabella in your name," Michael said, handing the card to Eric.

Eric was stunned for a moment but thought he got what Michael was trying to do.

"You wanna lend money to Isabella but don't wanna piss off John, so you're using me? No way, I'm not helping you or her." Eric laughed, but his laughter quickly turned into a scream of pain.

Michael coldly twisted one of Eric's fingers.

"Will you help or not?" Michael asked.

In too much pain to respond right away, Eric felt Michael twist his second finger.

"I'll do whatever you say, whatever you say!" Eric screamed, kneeling in front of Michael.

Outside the door, Isabella heard Eric's screams and started to worry about Michael.

"Michael, chill out! This could get really bad. Open the door, now!" Isabella shouted as she pushed the door open.

Inside, Michael had Eric's third finger in his grip, but since Eric had agreed to his demands, he let go.

"Sir, I agreed to your terms. Can I leave now?" Eric asked, trembling.

Eric, scared out of his mind, slowly got up to leave.

"Did I say you could go?" Michael's voice was ice-cold.

Terrified, Eric dropped to his knees again, crying. "I agreed to your terms. What more do you want from me?" 

"You dared to mess with my woman. I need to settle this." Michael stepped toward Eric, repeatedly punching him.

The room echoed with Eric's screams.

"Please stop! It's too much! You'll kill me! I know I was wrong. Please, stop!" Eric begged, his cries loud enough to alarm Isabella outside.

Just as Isabella was about to get hotel staff to open the door, it swung open, and Michael walked out, dragging Eric.

Isabella turned away, unable to look at Eric's swollen, bruised face.

With his uninjured hand, Eric shakily handed a bank card to Isabella. "Ms. Taylor, here's the 30 million dollars I prepared for you. Please take it."

Isabella looked puzzled. "You're giving me money? Aren't you scared of John retaliating?"

'Even if John wants to retaliate, it'll take time. But if I don't give you the money, this man might kill me right now,' Eric thought but didn't dare say.

"It's fine, Ms. Taylor. My wife's family is influential; they can protect me," Eric lied.

Isabella touched the recorder in her pocket. She had planned to blackmail Eric with evidence of his affair, but Michael's appearance had derailed everything.

'It's not what I planned, but at least the outcome is the same,' Isabella thought, taking the bank card and putting it in her purse.

Seeing Isabella accept the card, Eric sighed in relief. He looked at Michael, silently asking if he could leave.

Michael gave a slight nod, and Eric, almost crying with relief, bolted out of the hotel.

"Eric might come after you; you need to be careful. You beat him up pretty bad," Isabella said, concerned.

Michael smiled, patted her head, and said, "Don't worry. The camera inside recorded all his criminal plans. If he tries anything, he'll end up in jail."

Seeing Michael had it all figured out, Isabella finally relaxed.

###chapter 20 Michael hit John

After leaving the hotel, Isabella and Michael hopped into the car.

"So, when did you get to the hotel? Were you worried about me?" Isabella asked, her eyes sparkling.

"Of course, I was. You're my wife, after all. Gotta do my husbandly duties," Michael replied, leaning in closer.

Isabella's heart started racing as she felt Michael's breath getting heavier.

Michael moved in until he was almost touching her. She could feel her temperature rising.

As his lips got closer, Isabella closed her eyes, ready for the kiss.

"What are you doing? Just helping you with your seatbelt," Michael teased, making Isabella snap her eyes open in surprise.

"Seatbelt?" She looked down, seeing it fastened around her.

Her cheeks turned red as she realized her mistake. Out of nowhere, Michael leaned in and kissed Isabella, whose eyes widened in shock.

The kiss was brief, just a few seconds, before Michael pulled away.

"Thought I was gonna kiss you, huh? Well, wish granted," he said with a mischievous grin.

Isabella pushed him away, wiping her mouth. "I closed my eyes 'cause I was tired, not 'cause of you. Don't get any ideas."

Michael found her flustered look adorable and couldn't help but smile.

"Alright, beautiful. Since you're tired, let's get you home so you can rest," he chuckled, starting the car.

On the way, Isabella rolled down the window, letting the cool breeze calm her nerves.

'Isabella, do you actually have feelings for Michael? You didn't push him away, and you were ready for his kiss. But remember, this is just a contract marriage,' she thought, mocking herself.

When the car stopped, Isabella quickly opened the door and bolted. Michael watched her run off, a smile tugging at his lips.

Just then, his phone rang. It was Benjamin.

"Hey, Michael, there's a gathering tonight with the young folks from the four big families. You coming? Everyone's talking about you and your marriage," Benjamin teased.

Michael raised an eyebrow. "You said all the families are there. Is John there?"

"Yeah, he's here. He's the star of the night," Benjamin replied, glancing at the private room where John was. The noise and cheers were still loud.

"John seems to be celebrating something," Benjamin added, noticing the silence on the other end.

"Tell me where you are. I'm coming over. Keep an eye on John; don't let him leave," Michael instructed coldly before hanging up.

Benjamin stared at his phone, eyebrow raised. He had a feeling John was in for a rough night.

About half an hour later, Michael showed up at the bar where Benjamin was waiting. With Benjamin leading the way, Michael stormed into the private room where John was partying.

John, in the middle of celebrating with his friends, lit up when he saw Michael.

"Hey, everyone! Meet Michael, the business genius you all admire," John said, pulling Michael towards his friends.

The room erupted in cheers, glasses raised for a toast, but Michael just gave them a cold stare. He grabbed a bottle from the table, weighing it in his hand.

Before anyone could react, Michael smashed the bottle over John's head, glass shattering everywhere.

The room fell silent, everyone stunned by Michael's brutal move.

John, reeling from the shock and pain, looked at Michael. "What the hell, Michael? What are you doing?"

Michael ignored him, turning to the room. "I'll count to three. Everyone but him, get out."

As soon as Michael counted the first number, everyone in the room disappeared, leaving only Michael, John, and Benjamin.

Without a word, Michael started pounding on John, fists flying. John screamed in pain, and Benjamin's face twitched with unease.

"Enough, Michael! Stop it! You'll kill him!" Benjamin shouted, grabbing Michael's waist to pull him off.

With Benjamin's help, the beating finally stopped.

Michael shoved Benjamin away, pointing at John. "Isabella said you're a fool. Now I see it. Letting yourself get tricked into taking nude photos of her."

"What are you talking about? I'd never do that!" John yelled back, furious.

Michael's eyes narrowed. "Check your phone. Did you call Eric today?"

John pulled out his phone, checking his call records. His face went pale at the unfamiliar number.

"I didn't make any calls today. How...?" He trailed off, remembering Bianca had his phone earlier.

"Looks like you figured it out. If you can't handle Bianca, I will," Michael said, adjusting his clothes before walking out.

John stared at his phone, muttering, "No way. Bianca wouldn't do this. There must be a mistake."

Outside, Michael turned to Benjamin. "The younger generation is getting worse. John got played by a woman. What an idiot."

Benjamin chuckled. "Love makes men stupid. Just like you right now. Aren't you the same?"

###chapter 21 Who Do You Think You Are?

Michael shot Benjamin a sideways glance, clearly annoyed by what he just said.

"I'll say it again, the only reason I helped Isabella was out of pity and because it's my basic duty as a husband," Michael stressed, dead serious.

Benjamin raised his hands in mock surrender and nodded. "Yeah, yeah, I get it. You did it to save face for the family. Can't have the heir bullying his future wife, right?"

Michael snorted, kind of agreeing with Benjamin.

Benjamin chuckled and shook his head. Then he spotted a stunning woman walking their way, a mischievous grin spreading across his face.

"So, if you're not into Isabella, what about this beauty?" Benjamin teased Michael.

Michael frowned, looking at Pearl as she approached, clearly puzzled. "Who is she? She looks kinda familiar."

"That's Pearl from the Brown Family, one of the big four. Also, she's the girlfriend Mason picked out for you," Benjamin's grin widened.

Pearl walked up, extending her hand with a charming smile. "You must be Michael! I've heard so much about you. I've always admired you. I'm Pearl."

Michael didn't shake her hand. He gave her a quick glance, and the look in her eyes made him uneasy. He'd seen that greedy look before in women who saw him as a stepping stone.

Pearl felt awkward when Michael didn't shake her hand and looked to Benjamin for help.

Benjamin sighed, reached out, and shook Pearl's hand. "Ms. Brown, nice to meet you. We've had a bit too much to drink tonight and are heading home. Let's catch up another day." He smiled and started to pull Michael away.

Pearl smirked, but then she noticed Michael stopping and turning back to look at her.

Just when Pearl thought Michael was interested, his cold voice cut through the air. "I don't like others meddling in my marriage. Not even my father has that right," he said, walking away without a backward glance, leaving Pearl standing there, pale-faced.

"And you say you're not into Isabella? You didn't even give a beauty like Pearl a chance," Benjamin teased.

"I'll say it again, I just don't like others meddling in my marriage," Michael shot back coldly and walked off.

Benjamin shrugged. "Let's see how long you can keep denying it."

Meanwhile, at Isabella's place.

Isabella lay in bed, unable to sleep. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw Michael's mischievous smile. Whenever she was about to drift off, she'd dream of him kissing her.

"Damn it, another sleepless night?" Isabella sat up, frustrated, running her hands through her hair.

She got out of bed to get a glass of water. As she passed through the living room, she suddenly heard a knock on the door.

Who the heck would come knocking at 3 am? Isabella had a bad feeling. Ever since she got kidnapped, she had some serious trauma. She quickly grabbed a kitchen knife and stared at the door, her heart racing.

"Who's out there? I'm warning you, leave now or I'll call the cops!" Isabella's hand was shaking as she held the knife, shouting loudly to scare off whoever was outside.

The knocking stopped, and Isabella felt a bit of relief.

Then she heard Michael's voice from outside. "Isabella, open up, it's me."

Isabella was stunned but didn't drop the knife. She cautiously looked through the peephole and saw a flushed Michael standing there.

She quickly put the knife away and opened the door. Michael practically fell into her arms.

"Oh my God, how much did you drink? You reek of alcohol!" Isabella helped him inside and shut the door.

"You're lucky you didn't pass out on the street. If some thugs found you, they'd have dragged you off," she muttered, half to herself, as she threw Michael onto the bed.

She looked at the drunken Michael, grabbed a towel from the bathroom, and started wiping his face.

"Thirsty," Michael mumbled.

Isabella quickly got a glass of water and helped him drink.

Michael gulped it down, his Adam's apple bobbing, then flopped back onto the bed.

Isabella kept wiping his face, her eyes lingering on his throat. Tiny beads of water sparkled like diamonds, tracing a path from the corner of his mouth, making him look oddly vulnerable.

Her heart pounded wildly. There was something different about Michael tonight.

Suddenly, Michael grabbed her wrist, his eyes half-open, and in a mesmerized voice, he said, "Don't go!" He smiled and pulled her into his arms.

Isabella was startled. She felt his warmth and heard her own heartbeat pounding in her chest. Her body warmed up, and her breath quickened.

Then, his alcohol-scented mouth kissed hers.

Isabella's eyes widened as Michael's tongue found its way into her mouth, searching for hers. She couldn't control her wildly beating heart anymore and pushed him away forcefully.

"Sorry, I'm not ready yet." Blushing, Isabella jumped off the bed and rushed into the bathroom.

Leaning against the bathroom door, she breathed heavily, her heart pounding like it was about to burst.

"Oh my God, what am I doing? We're just in a contract marriage, and kissing is already too much. Are we really going further tonight?" she whispered, with her hand over her heart.

After staying in the bathroom for over ten minutes, Isabella finally calmed down. When she came out, she found Michael already asleep.

"I hope Michael won't remember any of this when he wakes up," she chuckled to herself and helped him take off his clothes.

###chapter 22 Bianca's Apology

Isabella wasn't about to strip Michael down completely. She just helped him out of his shirt and socks, and loosened his belt so he could sleep more comfortably.

After that, she was ready to crash in another room when she remembered a news story she'd read. Some guy got wasted, passed out face down, and choked on his own vomit. Not a pretty way to go.

Isabella thought, 'For such a handsome man like Michael, dying in a pool of vomit would be a really humiliating way to go.' So, she grabbed a chair and sat by the bed to keep an eye on him.

The next morning, just as the sun was peeking over the horizon, there was a knock on the door. Isabella, fighting off sleep, got up and shuffled to the door.

"Isabella, can you open up? I need to talk to you," John kept knocking like he wasn't gonna stop until she answered.

Peeking through the peephole, she saw John and Bianca outside. She really didn't want to deal with them and even thought about pretending she wasn't home.

She glanced back at the bedroom and saw Michael stirring. With a sigh, Isabella opened the door.

"What do you want?" she asked, giving John and Bianca a cold stare.

John took a deep breath. "We're here to apologize."

Isabella was taken aback.

"My uncle told me everything. It was all a big misunderstanding. Bianca, explain," John said, turning to Bianca.

Bianca wiped her eyes, looking like she'd been crying. She grabbed Isabella's hand, her voice shaky. "Isabella, I'm so sorry. I had no idea Eric would try to hurt you. I called him, pretending to be John, just to scare him and get some money for you. I never thought he'd do something like that." 

Isabella pieced it together. John's uncle knew what went down last night and had given John a serious talking-to. That was why John brought Bianca to apologize.

With a cold smile, Isabella looked at Bianca, fully aware of what she was up to.

"Bianca, a simple 'sorry' isn't gonna cut it," Isabella said, pulling her hand away.

Bianca, avoiding Isabella's gaze, asked, "What do I need to do for you to forgive me?"

Without warning, Isabella slapped Bianca hard across the face.

Grabbing Bianca's hair, she yanked her face close. "You think I don't know what you were planning? You wanted Eric to assault me, ruin my reputation so I couldn't marry into the Williams Family, and you could marry John instead, right?"

"Isabella, stop it! Let go," John tried to intervene, but Isabella released Bianca's hair before he could reach her.

"It's not that easy for Eric to trick me into bed. Instead, I caught him and got $30 million out of him. John, listen up, I've already won our bet for my family's company. I don't need your interference anymore," Isabella said, her eyes cold as ice.

John was taken aback. He hadn't expected Isabella to actually pull off getting $30 million.

Bianca's eyes flashed with resentment. "Isabella, are you lying? I don't believe anyone would give you $30 million."

Isabella pulled a bank card from her pocket. "There's $30 million on this card. If you don't believe me, go check at the nearest bank."

She smirked at both of them.

As they stood there, stunned, Isabella turned to Bianca. "From now on, don't play the victim with me. That slap was just a lesson; you won't get my life that easily."

Isabella started to head back to her room but suddenly stopped, turned around, and slapped Bianca again.

"Now I feel much better," she said with a smile, then shut the door.

Bianca, humiliated, tried to get out of her wheelchair to knock on Isabella's door.

"Enough, Bianca. Let's go," John said, stopping her and pushing her wheelchair downstairs.

"Even Michael is paying more attention to Isabella now. If we keep bothering her, she might report us to Grandfather, and then we'll be in real trouble," John said, reluctantly pushing Bianca away from the building.

When Isabella got back to the bedroom, she found Michael was already awake.

"Sorry for the noise earlier," Isabella shrugged, giving a helpless smile.

Michael had heard the commotion at the door and knew Bianca and John had been there, but he didn't pay much attention to it.

"Did you stay by my side all night?" Michael asked with a smile.

Isabella blushed slightly and shook her head. "No, I slept in the guest room."

Michael pointed to a small wet mark on the bed. "If I'm not mistaken, that's from you drooling in your sleep."

Isabella's face turned bright red. "I just remembered, it's time to make breakfast."

She quickly left the bedroom and headed to the kitchen to prepare breakfast, avoiding Michael's gaze.

Michael smiled, got out of bed, and went to the bathroom to freshen up, looking forward to the breakfast Isabella was making.

Meanwhile, outside the building, Bianca and John didn't leave right away.

John called a driver to take Bianca home while he went back inside.

"When Isabella went in earlier, I saw a pair of men's shoes on the shoe rack," John muttered to himself as he took the elevator to Isabella's floor.

He remembered reading that some single women would place men's shoes by the door to make it look like a man lived there, deterring intruders. But John was sure those shoes had been worn. Isabella's husband must have been in her house.

Standing outside Isabella's door, John reached out but didn't have the courage to knock.

###chapter 23 He Regretted It

Isabella brought the breakfast over to the table, ready to dig in with Michael.

Just then, there was a knock at the door. Isabella got up, a bit puzzled, and headed over to see who it was.

"Why is everyone knocking on my door this morning?" she muttered as she opened it, only to find no one there.

With a mouthful of food, Michael asked casually, "Someone at the door?"

Isabella shook her head and closed it again. "Probably just someone at the wrong door."

She shrugged it off and went back to her breakfast. Not long after she closed the door, John appeared at the end of the hallway.

John was sure he hadn't misheard. There was definitely another guy in Isabella's place.

Feeling a mix of emotions he couldn't quite pin down, John stood there with a gloomy look. He didn't really like Isabella, but seeing her with another man bugged him.

If Isabella knew what was going through John's head, she'd probably laugh at him.

John always treated Isabella like something he could toss aside whenever. But now that this "something" was with someone else, he was not happy about it. After standing there for a bit, John sighed and walked away.

Back at the table, Isabella and Michael were chatting.

"So, what's on your agenda today?" Michael asked.

Isabella thought for a moment and remembered something important.

"I'm going to an auction. There's a painting I want to buy for an elderly man," she said.

Michael raised an eyebrow. "John's grandfather, right?"

Isabella looked at him, surprised. "Wow, you're sharp. How'd you guess?"

Michael just smiled.

Resting her chin on her hand, Isabella sighed. "Manson has always been so kind to me. I haven't told him about us getting married yet, and I feel like I've let him down. So, I want to buy this painting for his birthday as a sort of apology."

Michael nodded, not saying much. After breakfast, he said he had to get to work and left.

After cleaning up, Isabella called her friend Amelia, and they met up at the auction house. As they caught up, Amelia's eyes lit up when she heard Michael had stayed over at Isabella's place.

"Did you two sleep together last night? How was he in bed? What positions do you like? How long did you last?" Amelia's questions got more and more explicit.

Blushing, Isabella quickly covered Amelia's mouth.

"Nothing happened! He drank too much and passed out as soon as he hit the bed," Isabella explained quickly.

Amelia looked disappointed. "Seriously? A hot guy in your bed and you just watched him sleep?"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "We're just contractually married. No sex involved."

To steer Amelia away from more explicit questions, Isabella quickly brought up John and Bianca's apology visit that morning.

"You slapped Bianca twice? That must've felt good. She totally deserved it. Did you get a chance to slap that jerk John too?" Amelia asked, eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Isabella realized she had missed her chance to slap John and felt a twinge of regret. Just then, they noticed a luxury car pulling up to the auction house. Isabella recognized it immediately as the Brown Family's car.

Pearl stepped out, looking glamorous in a stunning dress. Reporters swarmed her, snapping photos and bombarding her with questions.

"Ugh, look at her pretending to be all innocent. It's disgusting," Amelia said, glaring at Pearl.

Isabella gave Pearl a quick glance but then turned her attention away.

In the city's elite circles, Pearl's family was known as typical nouveau riche, always trying to act like aristocrats to boost their status.

"Let's go. We don't need to waste our time on her," Isabella said, pulling Amelia into the auction house.

As they walked past Pearl, Pearl noticed them too. Normally, Pearl would have gone out of her way to mock Isabella, but with reporters around, she had to keep up her noble act.

"Alright, everyone, I need to head inside before all the good stuff is gone," Pearl joked, waving to the reporters before heading into the auction house.

Once inside and away from the cameras, Pearl's smile vanished, replaced by a sinister look. She quickly spotted Isabella and followed her into the women's restroom.

Isabella was washing her hands when she heard the click of high heels behind her and saw Pearl's reflection in the mirror. Ignoring her, Isabella continued washing her hands, which only made Pearl angrier.

"Isabella, who do you think you are? I'm about to marry John's uncle. Once I do, I'll cancel your engagement with John! Let's see how you fare without the Williams Family's protection," Pearl spat, her face twisted with malice.

Drying her hands, Isabella turned to face Pearl.

"If you've got issues, see a doctor. Whether you marry John's uncle or not, it's none of my business. Do you expect me to respect you like an elder? Get real, you old hag," Isabella said mockingly, then walked out of the restroom.

Pearl's eyes widened with rage. She pointed at herself and shouted after Isabella, "How dare you call me an old hag! Just wait, Isabella. Once I marry John's uncle, I'll make sure to crush you under my feet."

###chapter 24 Auction Controversy

Isabella just didn't want to deal with Pearl. Who Pearl decided to marry was her own business; it had nothing to do with Isabella.

Isabella couldn't be bothered to argue with Pearl, a woman who only knew how to "step on others." She really didn't have any interest in getting into it with her.

Just as Isabella was about to head back to her seat, she spotted John following someone upstairs to the auction room.

From where Isabella was standing, she could only see the guy from behind, and she guessed that the man walking in front of John was the rumored uncle.

When she got back to her seat, Isabella noticed Pearl sitting not too far away. A hint of mockery crossed her lips.

Amelia saw Isabella's smile and asked, "Isabella, did you find something interesting?"

Isabella nodded and filled Amelia in on what had happened in the restroom.

"John and his uncle went to the upstairs room. If Pearl is really going to marry John's uncle like she claims, why is she sitting down here in the hall?" Isabella speculated, and Amelia agreed.

"Looks like Pearl is just trying to get in with the Williams Family. That's why she's lying," Amelia said, looking at Pearl with a hint of disdain.

Isabella shook her head. "I heard John's uncle isn't married, so Mason might be trying to set him up. But Mason doesn't seem to have a good knack for matchmaking."

This was probably one of Isabella's few complaints about Mason. Mason's choice of spouses for them was terrible. John was a jerk, and Pearl was just a nouveau riche without any class.

Upstairs, John and Michael sat comfortably. From there, they could look down at the auction hall through the largest floor-to-ceiling window.

John looked at Michael in confusion and asked, "Michael, why did we come to this auction? If you like something, we could go to a higher-end auction."

Even though there were a lot of big shots at today's auction, they were nothing compared to the Williams Family.

Michael, with his legs crossed, asked, "I heard a painting your grandfather liked is going to be here today. I'm planning to buy it and give it to him as a birthday gift."

"Is that so? Then why not just tell the organizers and buy it directly?" John still couldn't understand why Michael was making such a simple thing so complicated.

Michael looked at John, exasperated. "Even though we're rich, we can't solve everything so straightforwardly. Otherwise, life would be much less fun."

John shrugged, still not getting what Michael meant.

Michael didn't expect John to understand. His gaze was fixed on Isabella below.

"Michael, did you notice Isabella followed us here too? Last time, when Bianca and I went to apologize to her, she slapped Bianca right in front of me. You know, Bianca is her cousin," John said, looking at Isabella below with disdain.

Michael glanced at John and asked, "Last time Isabella asked you to check the compatibility between her and Bianca, did you investigate?"

John shook his head, sneering, "Michael, don't be fooled by her. This is clearly Isabella's scheme. She wants to create conflicts between me and Bianca using this method."

Michael looked at John speechlessly. Owen seemed quite intelligent, so why did John, his son, seem so unintelligent?

Michael had originally wanted to throw Isabella and Bianca's test report in John's face for him to see carefully, but when he saw John's unconditional trust in Bianca, he gave up on the idea.

Michael shook his head helplessly, thinking, 'John, even if I throw the evidence in your face, you won't believe it, will you?'

Suddenly, John pointed below and said, "Michael, that's the person Grandpa has arranged for you to marry, Pearl from the Brown Family. She seems like a nice person. What are your thoughts?"

Michael disdainfully pursed his lips, "She's not worthy."

Suddenly, Michael's brow furrowed. He noticed Isabella clutching her stomach in discomfort. Then he saw Amelia taking out a white object from her bag and handing it to Isabella, who then left her seat and headed towards the restroom.

Michael immediately understood what was happening. He called a staff member to prepare heating pads to send to Isabella below.

"That girl must be on her period. Go down and give her the heating pads to warm her stomach. And don't say it's from the Williams Family; just say it's a benefit from the auction house owner to the customers," Michael instructed before having the staff member prepare it.

John looked at Michael discontentedly. "Michael, you don't need to be so kind to Isabella."

Michael smiled. "After all, she is the fiancée your grandfather arranged for you. You don't have to always stare at her like she's an enemy."

After saying that, Michael ignored John.

The auction soon began.

The first item up for auction was the painting Isabella wanted. The starting price was $300,000, with increments of at least $50,000.

Isabella had prepared $800,000 for this auction, which was her savings over the years.

After a few rounds of bidding, the painting had already reached a price of $700,000.

"Is there a higher price than $700,000?" The auctioneer looked at the crowd with a hammer in hand.

"It seems no one is bidding higher than $700,000, so this painting will go for $700,000..." Before the auctioneer could finish, someone suddenly raised their paddle.

"$1 million!" Pearl raised her paddle high and shouted loudly.

Isabella had thought no one would bid higher than $700,000, so a smile appeared on her face. However, Pearl's sudden bid made her smile disappear instantly.

Isabella looked at Pearl coldly, and Pearl had a smug look on her face.

"$1 million! Is there a higher price than $1 million?" The auctioneer shouted loudly with the hammer raised, but her gaze was on Isabella.

Narrowing her eyes, Isabella stood up from her seat. "I bid $2 million!"

Amelia, on the side, was almost frantic. She knew how much money Isabella had. If Isabella insisted on a higher price, she would have to dip into that $30 million.

Pearl smirked as she watched Isabella slowly raise her paddle. "I bid $3 million!"

###chapter 25 Struggle Between Women

The auction kicked off with a fierce showdown between two women.

A painting that was only worth $700,000 got jacked up to $3 million by them.

John, chilling on the balcony, glanced down at Pearl and Isabella going at it, and sneered. "Seriously? Bumping up the price of a basic painting to almost five times its worth? What a couple of idiots."

Michael shot John a dirty look. One of those "idiots" was his wife.

Michael smirked as he watched Isabella. "Just wait. It's all part of the plan."

John was confused by Michael's words. Soon enough, the painting's price skyrocketed to $10 million.

When the auctioneer excitedly announced the $10 million bid, Isabella put her paddle down.

"Any higher than $10 million? $10 million once, $10 million twice, and sold! Congrats to Ms. Brown for winning our first item." The auctioneer was practically bouncing with excitement.

Pearl stood up, looking all smug at Isabella, but got a mocking smile in return.

Pearl suddenly felt something was off. Her anger towards Isabella faded, and she noticed everyone around her was looking at her like she was a fool.

It hit her. Isabella had played her, using her hatred to keep bidding higher, just to make her look stupid in front of everyone.

"A painting worth $700,000 bid up to ten times its value. Any auction house would love a fool like that." Isabella's voice wasn't loud, but everyone heard it.

Some people tried to hide their laughter, while others, not caring about the Brown Family's power, laughed out loud.

Pearl's face turned sour. Her friend next to her pulled her back and whispered something in her ear.

Pearl's expression brightened. She stood up and said loudly, "Some of you might think I was competing with Ms. Taylor, hence the $10 million bid."

"Isn't that true?" Amelia shouted from the side, making everyone laugh again.

Pearl's face darkened. She shot Amelia a death glare and continued, "This auction is for charity, and all proceeds go to good causes. I just wanted to donate this money, not compete with Ms. Taylor."

After Pearl finished, she smiled, thinking her words made sense and would make everyone see her as a philanthropist, not a fool.

Isabella clapped and smiled, "How generous! Ms. Brown donated $10 million just for the first item. The later items must be even pricier!"

Pearl's face fell. Even though the Brown Family was wealthy, they had just made it into the top four families, and their assets couldn't compare to the other three. $10 million was her limit.

Isabella noticed Pearl's expression and said with a smile, "Looks like Ms. Brown is only donating once, but that's okay. Thanks for your generosity."

Isabella's polite words felt like a slap to Pearl.

The auctioneer, not wanting their spat to mess up the auction, cut in and moved on to the next item.

The next items up for auction weren't really Isabella's thing, so she didn't bother bidding. Pearl, after dropping $10 million, was done too.

Once everything was auctioned off, the event wrapped up. Isabella and Amelia were getting ready to leave.

"Other than that first painting, which I really wanted, nothing else was good enough for Mason," Isabella sighed.

Amelia, always the optimist, held up some heating pads and grinned, "Hey, at least we didn't leave empty-handed. How did they know you were on your period today?"

Isabella just shrugged, not having a clue. Just then, Pearl stormed over with her entourage.

"Isabella, you bitch! You made me lose $10 million!" Pearl yelled, lunging to grab Isabella's hair.

Isabella frowned and smacked Pearl in the face with the heating pads, making her stumble back.

"Ms. Brown, are you nuts? That $10 million was your donation. What's it got to do with me?" Isabella said with a mocking smile.

"Bitch, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have spent $10 million!" Pearl spat, glaring at her.

"Hey, you guys, grab these two bitches! I want to scratch their faces!" Pearl ordered the auction house security guards.

Amelia quickly stepped in front of Isabella, looking worried.

Isabella stared coldly at Pearl. "You're really dumb, aren't you? Everyone knows I'm engaged to John. Anyone who touches me is messing with the Williams Family. Think twice before you face their wrath."

Pearl screamed, "Don't get too cocky. When I marry John's uncle, I'll-"

Isabella cut her off. "I'll just crush you under my foot! Seriously, can't you come up with something new? It's always the same old crap. I'm bored." She rolled her eyes, making Pearl even angrier.

The security guards, hearing this, decided to stay out of it. They weren't about to get involved in Williams Family drama.

Realizing the guards weren't going to help, Pearl screamed and charged at Isabella, with her friends following suit.

Amelia and Isabella weren't about to back down. The two groups of women started fighting, screaming and going wild.

Even though Isabella and Amelia were outnumbered, they were way tougher than Pearl and her crew. Hair-pulling, slapping, kicking-Pearl and her friends, who had never been in a real fight, were getting their butts kicked.

Soon, Pearl and her friends were out of breath, their clothes torn, exposing large patches of skin, which made the nearby security guards' hearts race.

###chapter 26 Unlucky Pearl

For guys, women were always a hot topic.

A bunch of women was sure to grab every dude's attention. If those women ended up exposed because of a fight, it would certainly draw a crowd of frenzied men.

The security guards at the auction house just stood by, watching Isabella and Amelia attack Pearl and her crew without stepping in.

First off, they didn't want to mess with the Williams Family drama. Second, Pearl and her friends, who were not only gorgeous but also had killer bodies, ended up showing a lot of skin during the fight, which the guards didn't mind watching.

Suddenly, the doors flew open, and a swarm of journalists with cameras barged in.

The guards, trying to be somewhat decent, quickly blocked the journalists, giving the women a chance to cover up. Pearl and Isabella stopped fighting as soon as they saw the cameras.

Pearl and her friends screamed and scrambled to get dressed. But then Pearl remembered she had called these journalists herself, so she wasn't too worried about the day's events getting out.

"Isabella, don't think this is over," Pearl snapped, glaring at her.

Just as Pearl was about to leave, Isabella stopped her.

"Hold up, Pearl. Forgetting something?" Isabella asked.

Pearl looked puzzled, "What else is there between us besides bad blood?"

Isabella's eyes were cold. "Remember our bet? The one for 10 million dollars? You lost. You said you needed time to get the money, but it's been a while now. Planning to back out?"

Pearl's face fell. She did remember the bet, and there were plenty of witnesses.

"You can drop 10 million on charity, so you must have it to pay me," Isabella smirked, holding out her hand.

Pearl's face twisted. She'd blown all her cash on charity and didn't have 10 million lying around. She could borrow it, but she didn't want to hand it over to Isabella that easily.

"Pearl, don't forget, there were lots of witnesses when we made that bet. You don't want this getting out, right? Especially with all these journalists here," Isabella said with a sly smile.

Pearl glared, realizing Isabella was blackmailing her. If she didn't pay up, she'd be known as a sore loser and a debtor, and that reputation would stick.

Pearl gritted her teeth. "I don't have that kind of money right now. Give me two days."

Isabella shook her head. "No need to prepare anything. I've got a way for you to pay me back."

Pearl frowned, sure that Isabella's plan would screw her over. She was about to refuse, but Isabella cut her off.

"For this charity event, donors have to sign their names. Go tell the organizers to put my name on the donation," Isabella said, knowing Pearl would refuse right away.

"Are you seriously suggesting I use my money to do charity for you? No way, that's humiliating!" Pearl snapped at Isabella.

Isabella shrugged. "Well, then, you leave me no choice. Either you pay up now, or I'll get the journalists to spill the beans."

Isabella wasn't giving Pearl any time to gather the money. Pearl knew she was cornered. Seeing Isabella about to make a call, Pearl had no choice but to nod fiercely.

"Fine, I'll inform them," Pearl said, only to see Isabella pulling over a security guard.

"Call your supervisor, or Ms. Brown here might make a run for it," Isabella said with a smile that looked devilish to Pearl.

The security guard nodded and quickly called the auction house manager. After hearing both sides, the manager handed over the signing rights to Isabella.

Isabella signed her name on the donation form without hesitation, then ignored Pearl's sour expression and left the auction house with Amelia.

Not long after they left, Pearl's furious screams echoed through the auction house. "Damn you, Isabella! I won't let you get away with this!"

Isabella and Amelia didn't pay any mind to Pearl's outburst. They headed straight to a department store.

"Isabella, you were awesome back there. That witch Pearl not only lost money but also her dignity. So satisfying," Amelia praised.

Isabella just smiled and led Amelia into a men's grooming store.

"Isabella, what are you planning to buy here? This stuff is for young guys; Mason wouldn't need any of this," Amelia asked, curious.

Isabella asked the staff to show her some razors. As she browsed, she said, "I'm not buying for Mason; this is for my husband."

"You're actually getting him a gift? I thought you two were just in a contract marriage," Amelia teased.

Isabella smiled helplessly. "Remember the bracelet he gave me last time? This razor is just a return gift."

With the staff's help, Isabella quickly picked out a razor she liked.

As they left the mall, a luxury car passed by, and they had no idea Michael and John were inside.

"Michael, are you serious? Can you really help Bianca find a kidney donor?" John asked excitedly.

Michael nodded. "It's not that hard, but leave Isabella's kidney out of it. You don't want her getting mad and complaining to your grandfather."

John nodded, excited, thinking Michael's help would soon cure Bianca.

Michael sighed inwardly at John's excitement. 'This idiot doesn't even know Bianca doesn't just want Isabella's kidney; she wants Isabella dead so she can take her place.'

Just then, Michael spotted Isabella and Amelia walking by with a men's gift box, his eyebrows raised in surprise.

###chapter 27 Shaving His Beard

Isabella and Amelia split up after leaving the mall.

Isabella headed home and dropped the gift box on the table. Just then, there was a knock on the door. Curious, Isabella walked over and peeked through the peephole. It was Michael standing outside.

"What are you doing here?" Isabella asked, opening the door and looking puzzled.

Michael, holding a box, followed her inside.

"My buddy got some manuscripts from the painter Eleanor Grey. I'm not into them, so I thought you might like them," Michael said, opening the box to reveal some old, yellowed papers.

Isabella's eyes widened as she quickly moved closer to check out the papers.

"These are really Eleanor's manuscripts. Where did your friend find these?" Isabella asked, stunned.

Michael shrugged. "He just likes collecting stuff that most people don't get. He's kind of a weird collector."

"These are super valuable; I can't just take them," Isabella hesitated. Even though they would make a perfect gift for Mason, she felt uneasy accepting something so precious.

Michael sighed and tossed the box towards the trash. "If you don't want them, I'll just throw them out. To us, they're not worth more than toilet paper."

"Are you crazy? Do you know what you're doing?" Isabella exclaimed, quickly rescuing the manuscripts from the trash.

"These are worth millions! What would you do with that kind of money?" Isabella clutched the box, glaring at Michael.

Michael just smiled. "They're only valuable to people who appreciate them. To me, they're worthless. You're my wife, so if you like them, they're yours."

Isabella rolled her eyes, baffled by Michael. He was just an ordinary office worker, yet he was giving up a chance to make a fortune.

"My friend didn't have a good place to keep these manuscripts. If you can find a real collector, it's better than letting them rot in the trash," Michael explained, giving a reason Isabella could accept.

"Mason would be a perfect collector. He knows how to take care of these," Isabella said, deciding not to argue anymore and carefully storing the manuscripts.

Michael then pointed to the men's gift box on the table. "Is that for me?"

With a hint of excitement, Isabella nodded and opened the box, pulling out a razor.

"Since you gave me that bracelet last time, I wanted to get you something too. I got this razor because your beard's been getting pretty thick," Isabella said, handing it to Michael.

Instead of taking the razor, Michael sat down and asked, "Can you help me shave?"

Surprised, Isabella pointed to herself and asked, "You want me to shave you? I've never done that before."

"Give it a shot. You're my wife, after all," Michael said with a wink.

Blushing, Isabella stepped closer with the razor.

"Alright, here goes nothing." She took a deep breath and sprayed shaving foam on Michael's face.

With his eyes closed and head tilted back, Michael relaxed into Isabella's touch.

Feeling her gentle fingers on his face and hearing the razor scrape his beard like dry leaves, Michael could sense her breath on his skin.

Isabella moved carefully, afraid of nicking Michael's face. The warm air from her breath tickled his skin. Opening his eyes, Michael saw Isabella's focused expression.

Their eyes met, and Isabella quickly looked away, her face turning red and her breathing uneven. Michael's lips curled into a slight smile.

As Isabella shaved down to his chin, her fingers brushed against his Adam's apple, making him look even more attractive.

'Oh my gosh, what am I thinking? Is it because I haven't been close to a man in so long? Why is my heart racing?' Isabella thought, blaming her reaction on a surge of hormones.

Michael watched her intently, his eyes soft and smiling.

Under his gaze, Isabella felt her face heat up even more. Finally, with the last stroke, she finished shaving his face.

As she wiped his face with a wet towel, she sighed in relief, ready to leave. But then, Michael grabbed her hand. Startled, Isabella turned to face Michael's handsome face.

Their eyes locked, and this time, Isabella found herself in Michael's arms, her heart pounding. The tender look in his eyes made her feel breathless. She watched as his mouth slowly moved closer to hers.

When their lips finally met, Isabella felt her body melt, leaning into Michael's chest and gripping his shirt to keep from falling.

This time, she responded to his kiss. Their tongues danced together, exploring each other like a shy couple discovering love.

As the kiss deepened, Isabella felt her breath grow short and her mind foggy. Just in time, Michael pulled away.

"Thanks for the shave. That was the best one I've ever had," Michael said with a gentle smile.

Blushing, Isabella nodded. Just as she was about to speak, her phone rang. The caller ID showed it was Amelia.

"I need to take this," Isabella said, blushing even more as she hurried back to her room and closed the door firmly.

###chapter 28 Unexpected Help

When Isabella picked up the phone, Michael grabbed the razor from the table and took off. He had other stuff to handle and couldn't hang around with Isabella all day.

Isabella, still in the room, had no clue Michael had left. She was deep in conversation with Amelia, who was sharing some juicy gossip.

"Quick, check the news. Pearl's in deep trouble this time. Every media outlet is talking about her fight," Amelia said, all excited.

Isabella pulled up the news and was shocked to see everyone trashing Pearl. They painted her as a total troublemaker, despite her rich background. The news even claimed Pearl had picked a fight with Isabella, got her butt kicked, and was dodging a $10 million debt.

As Isabella scrolled through the news, she noticed that in all the videos and pictures, her and Amelia's faces were blurred out, but Pearl and her crew were clear as day.

Isabella was stunned by these reports. If she remembered right, these journalists were originally hired by Pearl. How could they turn on her like this? She shared her thoughts with Amelia, who agreed.

"Money talks. It seems someone wealthier outdo an employer," Amelia speculated.

Isabella immediately thought of the three major families left and figured the Williams Family must be backing her.

"This can't be John's doing. He'd love to see me humiliated. Could it be someone else from the Williams Family?" Isabella wondered out loud.

Amelia, a bit exasperated, said, "Why don't you just call and ask? It's better than us guessing here, right?"

Isabella saw the sense in that and quickly hung up, dialing a media editor she knew. The editor didn't hold back and told Isabella straight up who was behind it.

After finding out, Isabella called Amelia right away.

"Amelia, you won't believe it. The person who helped me is actually John's uncle, the super mysterious tycoon!" Isabella said, totally amazed.

Amelia laughed, "Well, that makes sense. Have you noticed that besides that jerk John, the elders of the Williams Family seem to like you?"

"What's the point of them liking me? They want me to marry John, not the elders," Isabella said with a self-deprecating shrug.

Suddenly, Isabella remembered Michael, who she'd left in the living room. She rushed out of the bedroom, only to find the living room empty.

"What's up? Why'd you go quiet?" Amelia's voice came through the phone.

Isabella, feeling a bit helpless, said, "It's my husband. I got so caught up talking to you that I forgot about him."

Amelia immediately teased over the phone, "Hope I didn't interrupt anything spicy between you two. Sounds like my call came at the worst time."

Isabella's mind flashed back to that kiss with Michael in the living room, and her cheeks turned bright red.

Amelia picked up on the silence right away. "Wait, you guys didn't actually do anything, did you? You're still on your period," she exclaimed, making Isabella jump.

"What are you thinking? We just kissed, that's all," Isabella said, blushing even more.

"So you really were kissing. Looks like my call was a total buzzkill. Sorry for interrupting. I'll hang up now," Amelia teased before ending the call.

Rolling her eyes, Isabella thought about how she should thank John's uncle for his help, but she didn't have his number.

"Better to thank him in person. Guess I need to set up a meeting with Mason," Isabella decided and called Mason.

When the call connected, Mason's warm voice came through. "Isabella, what's up? Did John give you trouble again?"

Isabella felt a wave of warmth. Even though Mason wasn't her real grandfather, he always made her feel like family.

"Mason, John's uncle really helped me out this time. I want to thank him in person. Can you set up a time for me?" Isabella asked.

Looking at Michael sitting across from him on the couch, Mason smiled. "John's uncle is right here with me. Let me ask him."

Isabella was surprised to hear that and felt a bit nervous.

After setting up the time and place, Mason sighed as he looked at Michael. "I know Isabella doesn't really like John anymore. She used to talk about him so fondly, but now, she's so cold towards him, probably because of what happened with Bianca."

Michael just nodded, staying silent, unsure if he should spill the whole truth to Mason.

The situation with John and Bianca wasn't just about emotional betrayal; John had almost cost Isabella her life.

But seeing Mason's aged face, Michael felt that he might not be able to handle the shock, so he stayed silent.

"I heard Isabella got married. Do you know who she married?" Mason suddenly asked.

Michael's heart skipped a beat, but he played it cool, looking at Mason with a puzzled expression.

"My relationship with Isabella's grandfather was really good, and I've heard about her parents. Isabella can only rely on me now, but I don't know how long I'll be around. If I suddenly pass away, taking care of her will be up to you," Mason sighed, looking at Michael.

Michael nodded silently, feeling that the care Mason mentioned was more about the care of an elder for a younger one rather than a husband for a wife. It seemed Mason didn't know that Michael was actually Isabella's husband.

###chapter 29 Terrible Parents

Isabella showed up right on time at the spot they agreed on. She stared at the door of the private room, feeling a bundle of nerves. Today, she was finally going to meet the mysterious tycoon everyone talked about.

Taking a deep breath, Isabella knocked on the door.

The door creaked open, and to her surprise, it was Michael standing there.

"Michael? What are you doing here?" Isabella's eyes widened in shock.

Michael gave a small smile. "Why can't I be here?"

"Wait a minute, are you..." Isabella's hand flew to her mouth as a wild thought crossed her mind, even though it seemed crazy.

Just as she was about to ask if Michael was John's uncle, her phone rang.

It was Mason.

"Hey, Isabella. Sorry, but John's uncle had an emergency and can't make it. He asked me to apologize for him," Mason's cheerful voice came through the line.

Isabella let out a sigh of relief. Even though John's uncle didn't show up, at least she knew Michael wasn't him.

"No worries, Mason. He must be really busy. We can reschedule," Isabella replied politely before hanging up.

Turning back to Michael, she said with a resigned smile, "I was supposed to meet someone, but it looks like they bailed on me."

Michael shrugged. "Same here. I was meeting a client, but their flight got delayed."

Isabella chuckled. "Seems like we're both out of luck today. How about we grab a bite together?"

Michael nodded in agreement.

As they drove, Michael asked, "I overheard your call. You were meeting John's uncle? Why?"

"Yeah, he helped me out with something. I can already picture Pearl's face when she finds out. It's gonna be priceless," Isabella laughed, covering her mouth.

Michael grinned. "So, what do you think this mysterious John's uncle looks like?"

Isabella tilted her head, thinking. "He must have that aristocratic vibe. If this were the Middle Ages, he'd totally be a king!"

Michael's smile grew wider, clearly pleased with her description.

"I heard he's still single at his age." Isabella said, glancing at Michael.

Michael's expression darkened a bit. "Maybe he's just too busy with work to date."

"Really? A guy like him wouldn't turn down someone like Pearl, would he? She's not exactly a saint, but she's definitely pretty. Yet, he seems uninterested," Isabella mused.

"Guys like him care about more than just looks. They value character too. Let's not jump to conclusions. How about we decide where to eat?" Michael cut her off, worried about where her thoughts might lead.

Just as Isabella was pondering their next meal, her phone rang again. It was her mom, Mia.

"Isabella, come home quick. Your dad had an accident," Mia's voice was frantic.

Michael overheard and immediately sped towards Isabella's place.

He drove like a man on a mission, and they reached the Taylor Villa in no time. Michael parked outside but stayed in the car. He and Isabella's parents didn't exactly see eye to eye, and it was best to avoid any unnecessary drama.

Isabella rushed inside, and Mia led her straight to the bedroom. There, Jasper lay on the bed, looking pale with a mark on his neck.

"Dad, what happened? What's going on?" Isabella asked, her voice shaking as she leaned over him.

Jasper opened his eyes, glanced at her, and then shut them again, clearly not wanting to talk.

Isabella turned to Mia, desperate for answers.

With tears streaming down her face, Mia sighed. "Your father tried to kill himself today. John pulled all his investments, and your dad thought the Taylor Family was done for. I found him just in time."

Isabella was stunned. "But I gave the family $30 million! That should be enough to keep the company running."

Jasper opened his eyes again, glaring at her. "That $30 million won't last. I've told you, without John, we're finished."

Mia grabbed Isabella's hand, crying. "Isabella, you need to divorce and remarry John! The company is your father's life work. This is the only way to save him. Do you want to see us die?"

Isabella's face went pale. She stood up, glaring at her parents. "Are you asking me to die for the company? Do I mean nothing to you?"

Mia looked down, unable to meet her eyes. Jasper struggled to sit up, pointing at her angrily. "I don't believe John wants to kill you! Even if he did, it has nothing to do with us!"

Isabella felt dizzy, unable to believe her parents were pushing her to this.

The room fell silent. After a few minutes, Isabella suddenly burst into bitter laughter.

"This is just great. I've never been so disappointed. No, I'm beyond that. You want me to marry John? Fine. You want me to die? I'll grant your wish." Tears streamed down her face as she staggered out the door.

Mia watched her leave, worried. "Will she really go through with this?"

Jasper snorted. "Don't worry. She won't let us die. She'll do whatever we ask."

He touched his neck, wincing in pain. "Damn it, couldn't you have been a bit gentler when you strangled me? You almost choked me for real."

###chapter 30 Despair and Hope

Isabella had no clue that Jasper's suicide was just an act. The whole point was to make her feel guilty enough to cave into her parents' demands.

'I used to believe that no matter how much I was wronged outside, my parents would always be my home. Now it seems I have no home.' Isabella thought, feeling hopeless.

She stumbled out of the Taylor Villa and right into someone's arms.

"What's wrong? Why do you look so pale?" Michael asked, looking down at her with concern.

Tears filled Isabella's eyes as she looked up at Michael and whispered, "I have no home; they're pushing me to the edge."

Michael's brows knitted together. He gently wiped her tears with his fingers, looking at her with compassion.

"Let's talk in the car," he said, helping her inside.

"What happened? Tell me. I'm your husband; I deserve to know," Michael said seriously, looking at her.

Isabella sat in the passenger seat, her eyes unfocused, staring blankly at the windshield. Michael waited patiently. After a long silence, Isabella finally spoke.

"Michael, let's get a divorce," she said slowly, looking into his eyes.

Michael felt a sharp pang in his heart, but he didn't show it. Instead, he continued to look at her with tenderness.

"What happened? You can tell me," he said, gently wiping away her tears.

"They're threatening me with suicide, forcing me to divorce you and marry John. I told them John wanted me dead, but they didn't believe me. They even said that if I die, it has nothing to do with them." Isabella collapsed onto Michael, crying loudly.

Michael's sharp gaze shifted to the Taylor Villa.

Inside, Jasper and Mia suddenly felt a chill, as if some terrifying presence was targeting them.

"What's going on? Why do I suddenly have a bad feeling?" Mia shivered, looking around anxiously.

Jasper swallowed nervously and tried to stay calm. "What could happen? We're about to become the in-laws of the Williams Family. Who in this city would dare to harm us?"

Suddenly, the pressure around them disappeared.

Jasper breathed a sigh of relief. "See, nothing happened. We were just overthinking it."

What they didn't know was that the pressure disappeared because Michael drove away.

"Where are you taking me?" Isabella asked, looking out the car window at the unfamiliar surroundings.

Michael smiled. "You said you have no home, right? I'm taking you to a new one."

He didn't say more, and Isabella had to suppress her curiosity until they reached their destination. When they arrived, a man in a suit ran over respectfully.

"Are you Mr. Williams and Ms. Taylor?" the man asked politely.

Michael nodded. "Yes. Is the house ready?"

The man in the suit nodded quickly and pointed to a mansion that was three times bigger than the Taylor Villa. "This is the house I prepared for you."

Isabella's jaw dropped when she saw the mansion. She turned to Michael, completely stunned.

"What do you mean by this? What do you mean by a house prepared for us?" she asked, still in shock.

Michael took her hand and walked into the mansion with the man in the suit.

"I actually prepared this house. I was planning to tell you after all the furniture was moved in a few days, but since you said you have no home, I'll give you a new one," Michael said with a smile.

"Wait, are you saying this house is for me?" Isabella asked, hardly believing her ears.

Michael nodded seriously, and the man in the suit handed the keys to Isabella.

"Ms. Taylor, these are the keys to this mansion. Mr. Williams has already paid for the house," he said with a smile.

"Wait, this mansion must cost at least tens of millions of dollars. Where did you get so much money?" Isabella asked, feeling like she was dreaming.

Michael shrugged. "You may not believe it, but I won several hundred million dollars in the lottery! I found that my luck improved a lot after marrying you. You're probably my lucky charm."

Isabella still couldn't wrap her head around it.

"I hope you understand, but I can't accept this. It's too much," she said, trying to hand the keys back to Michael. His sudden generosity was overwhelming.

Michael waved his hand, and the man in the suit tactfully left the mansion.

Michael looked at Isabella, then suddenly squatted down to look her in the eyes. "Although we are just contractually married, let me take care of you, okay? I want to give you the best home ever."

Michael's sincere expression left Isabella speechless. For the first time, she felt truly cared for by a man. Even Jasper had never made her feel this way.

Tears welled up in her eyes again as she hugged Michael and cried loudly in his arms.

Michael held her tightly. He knew that after being betrayed by her family, Isabella was teetering on the edge.

Crying was the best way for her to vent, and Michael, like a family member, was the best person for her to turn to at that moment.

"I know you are very good to me. Thank you for everything you have done for me, but I really can't watch my parents die," Isabella cried, torn between the kind Michael and her parents who raised her, caught in a difficult decision.

Just then, someone burst into the mansion, shouting as soon as they entered.

"Michael, what's going on? I haven't even moved the furniture you mentioned. Why are you suddenly moving?" Benjamin walked in and was stunned to see the two hugging.

When Isabella saw Benjamin, she stopped crying. She didn't understand why he was there.

Feeling Michael's intense gaze, Benjamin shuddered and awkwardly said, "Sorry to bother you, I was just passing by."

###chapter 31 Damn Fate

Isabella stared blankly at Benjamin standing outside the door, while Michael's eyes flashed with a dangerous glint.

Benjamin, sweating bullets, stammered, "Uh, looks like I came at a bad time. Just remembered I have a surgery at the hospital. Gotta go!"

He quickly shut the door and bolted.

Isabella turned to Michael, puzzled. "How does Benjamin know you?"

Michael shrugged. "We were high school classmates. I asked him to help me find a place."

"Oh, got it." Isabella didn't question him further.

Her thoughts drifted back to her troubled family. She pushed Michael away, tears streaming down her face. "Why are you so good to me? I don't deserve this. We're just in a contract marriage."

Michael wrapped his arms around her from behind, whispering, "Even so, I should still act like a husband."

Isabella wiped her tears and bit her lip. She could feel Michael's sincerity, but she knew the Williams Family's power was something Michael couldn't handle. She didn't want him to get hurt.

Michael watched her in silence, feeling down. He really wanted to tell her who he really was. Seeing his hesitation, Isabella thought he was weighing whether she was worth the trouble with the Williams Family.

She forced a bitter smile. "I have to go. I'll see you later."

With that, she walked out the door.

Benjamin, who had been eavesdropping, fell to the ground as she opened the door.

Embarrassed, he looked up. "The patient ate something before surgery, so it got canceled."

Isabella ignored him and kept walking. Benjamin approached Michael, curious. "Did you guys have a fight?"

"No," Michael muttered.

Benjamin raised an eyebrow. "Dude, you look like you just lost a fight. Did you say something dumb? Girls need comforting. Just talk to her, and it'll be fine."

Michael shot him a look. "If you're such an expert, why are you still single?"

Benjamin went quiet. Michael, frustrated, scratched his head and headed for the door. "Let's go grab a drink."

Benjamin shrugged and followed him to the car.

Michael drove slowly, scanning the streets, but he didn't see Isabella anywhere. His frown deepened.

Benjamin teased, "Stop looking. She probably took a cab home."

"Shut up!" Michael snapped, tempted to punch him.

Isabella did take a cab, but she didn't go home. She went to Amelia's place.

Outside Amelia's apartment, they ran into each other. Seeing Isabella's distressed face, Amelia rushed over. "Isabella, are you okay?"

Isabella's eyes welled up with tears. "Can I stay with you for a few days?"

Amelia could tell something was really off with Isabella. She grabbed her hand and said, "Of course, no problem. Stay as long as you need. Come on, let's go."

She led Isabella back to her place. Isabella plopped down on the sofa, staring blankly out the window like she was in another world.

Amelia felt awful for her and hugged her tight. "I heard your dad's sick. Is it serious?"

At the mention of her dad, Isabella broke down. "They want me to marry John. If I don't, they said they'd kill themselves."

Amelia's eyes went wide. "Did they really say that?"

Isabella nodded, tears streaming down her face. "They even have marks on their necks from trying to hang themselves."

Amelia jumped up, furious. "They threatened you with suicide? What kind of parents do that? That's insane!"

Isabella just stared at the ceiling, too drained to defend her parents.

"You didn't agree to it, did you?" Amelia asked, worried.

"I didn't have a choice. My whole life, they've told me I was born to marry John. They've treated me well, but now I see it was all for this." Isabella's voice was hollow, like she'd given up.

Amelia looked at her with pity. "But if you marry John, you'll have to give your kidney to that witch Bianca. Are you really okay with that? I can't stand it!"

Isabella gave a bitter smile. "I talked to a doctor. I can live a normal life with just one kidney."

Amelia didn't know Bianca wanted Isabella dead, and Isabella didn't want to tell Bianca that marrying John would be her death sentence.

Amelia scratched her head in frustration. "Why don't you tell Mason?"

"He's getting older. I really don't want to upset him," Isabella said seriously.

Amelia kicked the sofa in anger. "I hate these powerful people! They think they're above the law! It's like Congress makes laws just for us, not them!"

Isabella hugged her tightly. "Stop cursing. I've made my peace with it."

Amelia cried out, "Damn it!"

During her stay at Amelia's, Isabella found some peace and a sense of normalcy. But soon, it was time for Mason's birthday party. The party was a big deal, with people from the four major families invited.

Since Isabella was John's fiancée, Jasper and Mia were also on the guest list.

Dressed to the nines, Jasper and Mia were surrounded by reporters snapping photos and asking questions. Little did anyone know, they were secretly planning to sell their daughter.

Suddenly, the reporters' attention shifted to a diamond-encrusted Rolls-Royce pulling up. They swarmed around to see who was inside.

Inside the car, Pearl saw everyone looking and lifted her chin proudly.

###chapter 32  The Banquet

The buzz from the last auction really did a number on Pearl's rep, and folks were having a field day talking smack behind her back.

This time around, she was dead set on fixing the mess she made at Mason's birthday bash and getting her image back on track.

With curious eyes on her, the door of the Rolls-Royce swung open, and Pearl stepped out in her high heels. The paparazzi went nuts, snapping pics like crazy.

Pearl rocked a black evening gown that hugged her curves just right, showing off her sexy figure and oozing charm from every angle.

Someone whispered, "Is that really the same Ms. Brown we used to know?"

"Pearl looks absolutely stunning in that dress, and her figure is to die for!"

"I haven't seen anyone as gorgeous as her in ages."

Hearing the chatter, Pearl couldn't help but smile.

'I've been practicing my manners and picking out the perfect outfit and makeup for this banquet, just to show everyone I'm better than Isabella!' Pearl thought, strutting towards the venue, taking her sweet time so the cameras could get their fill and she could make the headlines.

Suddenly, there was a gasp behind her. Thinking something was wrong with her dress, she checked but found nothing amiss. She turned around, eyebrows furrowed, and was stunned.

A taxi had pulled up outside the fancy venue, sticking out like a sore thumb among all the luxury cars. And out stepped Isabella.

Isabella was also in a black dress, flaunting her beautiful shoulders. A pearl-colored belt cinched her slim waist, and she wore red high heels that highlighted her slender neck and butterfly-like collarbones.

The journalists were floored. Isabella, who usually dressed conservatively, was now rocking a sexy look just like Pearl.

Both in black dresses, both stunning, and both with a history of conflict-this was a story waiting to happen.

Who was more beautiful, Pearl or Isabella?

Pearl's face darkened. She hated to admit it, but Isabella seemed to be stealing the spotlight. Isabella's new look was a big hit, sparking even more curiosity.

Unlike Pearl, Isabella didn't give a damn about the admiring glances. Amelia had picked out this dress for her, reminding her, "You've lived your whole life under your parents' expectations, always dignified and elegant. It's time to live for yourself!"

Isabella agreed, and since this was her last shot, she went for the daring dress.

As Isabella was about to head in, Pearl blocked her path. Isabella's voice was icy, "Move aside."

Pearl, glaring at Isabella's beautiful face, wished she could rip it off. Pearl got closer, using her body to block the reporters' cameras.

She hissed, "Can't win John's heart, so you're trying to seduce his uncle instead?"

Isabella frowned, "I'll say it again, move, or I'll hit you right here."

"Do you dare!" Pearl scoffed, not believing Isabella would actually do it.

Isabella raised her hand to slap, of course she dared-what did she have to care about when she was close to death?

Pearl, seeing Isabella's hand go up, suddenly felt a pang of fear.

Luckily, the staff noticed the tension and quickly stepped in, saying, "Ms. Brown, Ms. Taylor, the banquet's about to start, and there are people waiting behind you. Please don't block the entrance."

Isabella lowered her hand, and Pearl let out a sigh of relief. But the fact that Isabella had managed to scare her made Pearl even more resentful.

Pearl followed Isabella inside and blocked her path again. She leaned in and sneered, "Don't think that cozying up to Mr. Mason Williams will get you to marry John's uncle. Only someone with my background is worthy of him! Don't get any ideas."

Isabella shot her a cold look and then slapped her hard across the face.

They were inside the banquet hall now, so the reporters were kept outside, but there were still people around. Pearl's anger flared up instantly. Just as sh was about to lose it, Jasper and Mia quickly approached.

"Pearl, long time no see. How's your father?" Jasper greeted her.

Mia quickly pulled Isabella away.

Pearl glared at Jasper, "Your daughter just hit me, and you want to walk away?"

Jasper kept his smile. "I'll talk to her about it. There are a lot of people here. Let's discuss this after the banquet."

Pearl knew Jasper was warning her and could only glare resentfully at Isabella before walking away.

"See, your dad still cares about you. Don't be mad at us anymore," Mia tried to comfort Isabella.

Isabella stayed cold, knowing Jasper was only helping her because she was still useful, not out of genuine affection.

Seeing Isabella silent, Mia continued, "You look so beautiful today. You'll definitely catch John's eye."

Jasper nodded, "Isabella, you've really grown up."

Isabella didn't want to stay with her parents any longer. She finally spoke up, "I'll go over to Mr. Williams' table."

She walked towards the main table, where several important members of the Williams Family were already seated. Isabella scanned the crowd, looking for John's uncle, but he wasn't there.

Mason waved at her, "Isabella! Come sit over here."

Isabella took a seat next to Mason. Mason was dressed in a suit today, looking rejuvenated, like he'd suddenly become ten years younger.

Isabella smiled, "Mason, happy birthday."

"Finally willing to sit at my table this year?" Mason teased.

"That's right. You're going to marry John, so you should sit here," Mason said with a smile.

Every year, Mason reserved a seat for Isabella at the main table, but she always declined, fearing John's disapproval.

Now, Isabella didn't need to consider John's thoughts anymore; she just wanted to be happy.

Isabella was about to speak when her expression suddenly changed. She saw John and Bianca behind Mason. Bianca looked worse for wear, sitting in a wheelchair, her face pale and fragile. John stood beside her, gently holding Bianca's hand.

The onlookers' gazes playfully fell on Isabella. They all knew the complicated relationship between the three of them. How would Isabella, as John's fiancée, handle this?

Bianca looked at John, only to find him staring at Isabella the whole time. This made her very unhappy.

"John," Bianca called out.

John snapped out of it, realizing he'd been staring at Isabella. She looked so stunning today that she caught his attention.

Unhappily, John said to Isabella, "Why are you at this table?"

###chapter 33 Swearing in Public

Isabella rolled her eyes, not even trying to be polite to John and Bianca.

"Seriously, you have the worst memory. Mason always had a seat for me at the main table every year. Don't you remember?" Isabella shot John a challenging look.

Mason's smile faded as he could tell Isabella was over John.

John frowned, clearly annoyed by Isabella's attitude. He remembered when she used to be so respectful.

Bianca coughed, grabbing John's attention again.

John squatted down, looking worried. "What's wrong? You feeling sick? Should I take you home?"

Bianca shook her head, but there was a smug look in her eyes, showing off how much John cared for her.

Isabella smirked and shook her head, thinking that Bianca was really dumb to use John to provoke her; it seemed both her kidneys and brains were failing.

Mason looked at Bianca and John, his voice deep. "I don't remember inviting her."

Mason had set up Isabella's engagement with John. Even if they didn't love each other, Bianca's behavior towards John in front of everyone was humiliating for Mason.

Bianca's face went pale, looking helplessly at John.

John stood in front of Bianca, pleading, "Grandpa, Bianca meant well. How can you say that about her?"

Watching this, Isabella suddenly remembered the first time Michael had protected her. As a mid-level leader of the Williams Family, he had to be at the banquet. She scanned the hall, hoping to spot him.

But to her disappointment, Michael was nowhere to be seen. Mason's voice snapped Isabella back to reality.

"Isabella, Bianca is your cousin, a member of the Taylor Family. Whether she stays or leaves, it's up to you," Mason handed the decision to Isabella.

Everyone's eyes were on Isabella, John, and Bianca.

Mason wanted to show everyone that Isabella was the hostess of the Williams Family, with the power to make big decisions.

Under Mason's encouraging gaze, Isabella nodded slightly. "Mason, I'd like to ask them a few questions."

Mason nodded. "Go ahead."

Isabella walked towards John, step by step. As she got closer, John couldn't look her in the eye.

'Damn, how can Isabella have such a strong presence? It must be because of my grandpa.' John reluctantly raised his head, staring into Isabella's eyes.

But Isabella ignored him, looking down at Bianca instead.

Bianca nervously held John's hand, feeling intimidated by Isabella.

"Bianca, tell me. Do you really love John? Or is it just out of respect?" Isabella asked with a smile.

Bianca was stunned, not expecting Isabella to ask such a question in front of everyone.

Everyone knew Bianca liked John, but being put on the spot like this made her panic. She could feel Mason's stern gaze.

Bianca looked at John in a panic. John wanted to step forward but was blocked by Mason.

"Isabella wants to talk to Bianca. What's your business? Step aside!" Mason glared at John.

John stepped back, sulking and not daring to speak again.

"Is it so hard to answer? Are you in love with John, feeling like a mistress and too embarrassed to admit it?" Isabella said sarcastically.

Bianca's lips turned pale. The pressure from Isabella and Mason was too much. She hurriedly explained, "You misunderstood, Isabella. I only respect John. I've always seen him as a brother."

Isabella patted Bianca's shoulder, smiling. "So I misunderstood you, Bianca. But sometimes, you do make me feel insecure. Why not swear in front of everyone to put my mind at ease?"

"What?" Bianca had a bad feeling about this.

Isabella locked eyes with Bianca and said in a heavy tone, "If you marry John, not only will you never recover from your illness, but you'll face misfortune every time you step outside!"

Bianca's hands clenched so tight her fingertips turned white from anger and resentment. Her silence made Isabella's cold smile reappear.

"What? You don't really want to marry John, do you?" Isabella suddenly raised her voice, making sure everyone heard.

Trembling, Bianca looked to John for help, only to meet Mason's icy gaze.

"It's just a simple oath. What's so hard about it? Say it to reassure Isabella. Or do you really want to steal a man from her?" Mason frowned, putting immense pressure on Bianca.

Bianca bit her lip tightly. Under everyone's scrutiny, she was sweating bullets.

"I, Bianca, swear that if I marry John, not only will I never recover from my illness, but I will also face misfortune every time I step outside!" After speaking, Bianca raised her head, staring at Isabella with resentment in her eyes.

Isabella was very satisfied. If Bianca wanted her to die, then she would make sure Bianca could never marry John in her lifetime. Even if Banic had married John, she wouldn't have gained a good reputation.

"Bianca, my dear cousin, today is Mr. Williams's birthday. Since you're unwell and have already come, why not stay?" Isabella took Bianca's hand and led her to the table to sit down.

After doing all this, Isabella looked at John and said, "John, thanks for taking care of Bianca during this time. It's difficult to manage a household without a man."

Isabella displayed the elegance and demeanor of a hostess. Mason smiled at Isabella for handling the situation. When Isabella sat down, he whispered, "Isabella, you are still too kind."

Mason was a ruthless man in his youth, or else he wouldn't have his current status.

Isabella smiled and whispered back, "It's your birthday today. I can't be too harsh. There will be other opportunities."

Satisfied, Mason nodded.

Watching Isabella's smile, John felt annoyed. Instead of sitting in his seat, he turned and headed towards the backstage.

"Where's my uncle?" John asked the butler.

The butler smiled, "Mr. Williams is resting in the backstage lounge."

"Okay, I see," John said.

In the lounge, Michael sat on the sofa, watching the monitor screen. Leaning back on the sofa, he swirled a can of cold beer in his hand, a slight smile appearing on his face as he watched Isabella on the screen.

The door to the lounge opened, and John walked in, heading straight to the fridge.

John adjusted his collar, took a can of cold beer from the fridge, and took a few sips, cooling down his anger, before saying, "Michael, did you see that? That woman, Isabella, actually forced Bianca to make an oath. I've never seen such a malicious woman in my life!"

Michael looked up at John with a hint of disdain in his eyes.

Compared to other women, who could be more ruthless than Bianca? Due to the rivalry, Bianca even wanted Isabella to die on the operating table.

"Compared to other women, she's already quite gentle. If it were me, I would be even more ruthless than her." This was Michael's response, clearly siding with Isabella.

John looked at Michael discontentedly, "Michael, are you kidding me? A woman as malicious as Isabella? She's a disaster, and marrying her won't change that. Who knows when she'll stab me in the back?"

Michael looked at the foolish John in silence. Even if he told John the truth, John wouldn't believe that Bianca was a malicious woman. Bianca had already assessed John's intelligence and held it in her grasp.

Michael didn't want to deal with the foolish John. He touched his chin and suddenly felt the stubble on it prickly. He remembered he had forgotten to shave before going out today.

Michael asked his subordinate to bring his razor from the car, and soon, the subordinate returned with it.

As Michael shaved, John suddenly approached him, staring at the razor in his hand. "Why does this razor look so familiar?"

###chapter 34 The Competition of Gift

Michael paused mid-shave, his mind drifting back to that time he and John spotted Isabella shopping from the car.

John couldn't remember such a minor detail and decided to let it go.

"Hey, Michael, that shaver looks kinda cheap. Why not get a fancier one?" John asked, puzzled.

"This one works just fine and feels good in my hand. Why spend more? Just 'cause I'm rich doesn't mean I'm dumb," Michael replied, giving John a look.

John awkwardly sipped his beer and switched topics, "So, Michael, you going to the banquet?"

Michael glanced at Isabella on the screen, not ready to reveal his identity.

"No, I like staying in the shadows. It's more fun. Plus, I might catch the guy who's after me," Michael said with a confident grin.

John nodded, trusting Michael's instincts. They still hadn't found the mastermind behind the car accident when Michael got off the plane, but Michael was sure it wouldn't be long before he did.

"Alright, I'm off to have dinner with Grandpa," John said, leaving the lounge, annoyed at the thought of sitting with Isabella.

In the banquet hall, Isabella was chatting with Mason. When John walked in, he heard the Williams Family members praising Isabella, calling her the best hostess. Some even said John was lucky to marry her.

John felt irritated, thinking Isabella was the lucky one to marry him. He sat next to Isabella, not really wanting to, but needing to save face after the embarrassment with Bianca.

Owen and Mason didn't know what John was thinking and assumed he was falling for Isabella again, raising their hopes for the marriage.

As soon as John sat down, he felt a chill on the back of his neck. But when he turned around, there was nothing.

In the lounge, Michael stared coldly at the monitor, crushing his beer can.

Isabella ignored John, not even glancing his way. She was more curious about John's uncle, who had helped her several times.

"Mason, when will John's uncle arrive?" Isabella asked Mason.

Before Mason could answer, John snorted, "He's already here."

Isabella still didn't look at John, continuing to ignore him. She turned to Mason, "Mason, do you know where he is? I want to thank him in person."

Mason smiled, "I don't know. Why don't you ask John?"

Mason was trying to get Isabella and John to talk, but Isabella wasn't having it.

John leaned in with a mischievous grin, "Beg me, and I'll tell you where he is."

Isabella frowned, resisting the urge to slap him.

"Keep dreaming if you think I'll beg you, idiot," Isabella scoffed, turning away.

John's position, blocking Isabella, made it look like they were super close, giving everyone the wrong idea about their relationship.

Mia excitedly nudged Jasper, "Jasper! Look at John and Isabella, they're so close!"

Jasper grinned, "I've been saying John has feelings for Isabella. Once she marries into the family, we can finally relax and enjoy life."

Meanwhile, Bianca was gripping her wheelchair's armrest so hard it looked like it might snap. Jealousy burned in her eyes, and if looks could kill, Isabella would be toast.

Isabella turned away from John, deciding to ask the staff about Michael's whereabouts. Just as she was about to approach the staff, she saw Pearl walking over with a glass of red wine. Pearl smiled briefly at John before her gaze landed on Isabella.

Isabella knew Pearl well; the cunning woman was here to provoke her again. Despite this, she was curious to see what Pearl would do this time, especially with Mason watching.

Pearl raised her glass to Mason, "Mr. Williams, happy birthday, and may you stay forever young. I have a little gift for you. I hope you like it."

Mason smiled and thanked Pearl.

Everyone around looked at Pearl with curiosity, wondering what gift she had prepared.

Pearl called a staff member over and presented her gift. "I heard Mr. Williams has recently taken a liking to antiques. I found an antique bronze statue for you. I hope you like it."

Mason opened the exquisite box to find a small, well-preserved bronze statue inside, clearly of great collectible value.

"It seems to be from a couple of centuries ago. Thank you for the gift; I really like it," Mason said kindly, nodding at Pearl.

Seeing Mason's interest, Pearl continued, "I'm glad you like it. It's not expensive, just over thirty million dollars."

Pearl pretended not to care about the price, but her heart was bleeding. Her family's wealth wasn't as strong as the other three major families, so she didn't have as much money as the other heirs. But once she married Michael, she wouldn't have to worry about money.

The best part was that this price would completely overshadow Isabella's gift.

Mason, holding the statue, smiled and said, "You've put in so much effort; I want to give you a fair deal. I agree with what you proposed earlier."

Pearl's face lit up with joy, but Isabella wasn't worried. She had a feeling that John's uncle didn't like Pearl and wouldn't marry her.

Sometimes, Isabella was puzzled. Although she had never met John's uncle, she had this feeling.

Pearl suddenly approached Isabella, smiling, "Isabella, you are the one Mr. Williams cherishes the most. I wonder what gift you have prepared for Mr. Williams?"

Pearl's eyes flashed with resentment as she looked at Isabella. Isabella, seeing Pearl pretending to be innocent, felt disgusted.

'Idiot, do you think Mason is like you, all about the nouveau riche? He values the sentiment of the gift, not the price,' Isabella thought to herself, mocking Pearl in her mind before taking out the gift she had prepared.

###chapter 35  Isabella's Second Gift

Isabella's gift turned out to be Eleanor's manuscript, which Michael had prepped for her.

She handed the small box to Mason. Mason figured Isabella wouldn't give him something lame, so he opened the box right away.

Pearl tiptoed to peek inside and smirked when she saw a bunch of old papers.

Pointing at the papers, Pearl sneered, "Isabella, is this your gift? Just some random old papers? Do you really think this is good enough for Mr. Williams? Does this show how much he means to you?"

People around started giving Isabella puzzled looks, kinda agreeing with Pearl.

Ignoring the crowd, Isabella shot Pearl a mocking smile. "You Brown Family folks are just new money. You have no clue about the collectible value of these papers."

"What did you say? You think these scraps are collectibles? Do you think they're century-old masterpieces or something?" Pearl snapped.

Isabella walked up to Mason, smiling. "I know Mr. Williams is a big fan of Eleanor, so I went through a lot to find these manuscripts."

"How is that possible? How can someone from a declining family like yours get Eleanor's works?" Pearl shouted. Even though she was new money, she knew Eleanor's status in the art world.

"Eleanor, it's really her manuscript!" Mason was so excited his hands were shaking.

Worried he might damage the papers, Mason gently placed the box on the table.

The crowd was shocked. They'd never seen Mason so emotional.

Mason closed his eyes, took a moment to calm down, and then grabbed Isabella's hand excitedly. "Isabella, thank you. Someone gave me an Eleanor manuscript years ago."

Mason stared deeply into Isabella's eyes.

Isabella felt like Mason wasn't looking at her but trying to see someone else through her. She guessed it might be her grandfather, and that the two old folks had a special bond.

Smiling, Mason held Isabella's hand and said, "Isabella, I really love this gift. I can grant you any wish you have."

Isabella just pursed her lips and stayed quiet. Pearl, standing nearby, was fuming because it was clear Isabella's gift had more emotional value.

"Mr. Williams, but what Isabella gave you is just a manuscript, not a real artwork. It doesn't have much value," Pearl tried to downplay Isabella's gift but got sternly rebuked by Mason.

"Pearl! Only new money would measure a gift's value by its price! Isabella's gift is my favorite, and that's all that matters." Mason glared at Pearl, his powerful presence making her step back.

Pearl felt super embarrassed as she heard the crowd's mocking laughter.

'Damn Isabella, I'll remember this, and I'll get back at you,' Pearl thought. She was about to leave when she saw a staff member coming in with a painting.

The staff member held the painting carefully, saying, "Mr. Williams, this is the second gift prepared for you by Ms. Taylor."

Isabella was startled; she had only prepared one gift and didn't remember having a second one.

'Is someone trying to mess with me?' She eyed the staff member suspiciously.

Mason took the painting with a smile, "Isabella, how many surprises did you plan for me tonight?"

Just as Isabella was about to stop him, Mason had already unrolled the painting. It showed a half-naked man pointing to the side, as if trying to convey something.

The painting was incredibly well done. Even Isabella had to admit it was a masterpiece. She was so shocked she forgot to tell Mason this wasn't her gift.

Among the guests were collectors who immediately recognized the painting as Eleanor's.

"This is Eleanor's artwork!" someone shouted.

Everyone stared at Isabella in shock!

Eleanor's manuscripts were more common than her actual paintings. While it was tough to get her manuscripts, it was still possible. But Eleanor's famous paintings were only a few dozen. Getting one wasn't just about money; it required serious connections.

Mason stared at the painting for a long time before snapping out of it. He anxiously asked, "Isabella, how did you get this oil painting?"

Isabella was at a loss. She couldn't answer because she hadn't prepared this painting. She even thought someone was trying to set her up. But after so many people confirmed it was genuine, who would use such an expensive painting to harm her?

No one noticed John frowning deeply. Others didn't know whose painting it was, but he did.

'Wasn't this painting a gift Michael prepared for Grandpa? Why did he say it was Isabella's? Why is he so concerned about Isabella? Is it just for the family?' John couldn't figure it out.

In the lounge, Michael watched Isabella on the screen, arms crossed. Isabella was blushing and looked like a deer in headlights, which gave Michael a mischievous thrill. Although this prank was costly, he didn't care about the money.

Michael also noticed John's puzzled expression and guessed what he was thinking.

"The reputation of the Williams Family doesn't concern me, but I can't stand seeing Isabella being bullied. Since they say Eleanor's manuscripts have no value, let's just bring out Eleanor's actual works." Michael looked at Pearl with a hint of a cold smile.

However, seeing Isabella looking embarrassed in the center of the crowd, Michael knew this prank had to end.

Michael called the butler into the lounge and whispered a few words to him.

The butler nodded and left the lounge, heading towards the banquet hall.

###chapter 36 Isabella's Tears

The butler strolled into the banquet hall and made a beeline for Mason.

"Mr. Williams, it's time. The chef's got everything ready, and the banquet's about to kick off," the butler said with a respectful nod.

Mason nodded back, knowing the main event was about to start. He had to put his curiosity on hold for now. Handing the oil painting to the butler, he said, "Can you get someone to send this back home right away?"

"Of course, Mr. Williams," the butler replied, taking the painting and making the necessary arrangements.

As the waitstaff started serving up the fancy dishes, everyone raised their glasses to toast Mason.

"Mr. Williams, congrats on getting such a valuable gift. Definitely worth celebrating."

"Ms. Taylor is so thoughtful."

"Yeah, Ms. Taylor isn't even part of the Williams family yet, and she's already so generous and caring towards Mr. Williams. That's impressive."

Mason couldn't stop smiling.

Meanwhile, no one was paying attention to Pearl anymore. After Mason scolded her, she didn't dare to approach and just sat in the corner, glaring at Isabella, who was soaking up all the attention.

"Damn, Isabella, why don't you just drop dead? Why do you always have to go against me? I hope you get hit by a car or something," Pearl muttered under her breath, her eyes shifting to the painting being carefully handled by the staff.

'No way! Isabella can't afford something that valuable. There's gotta be something fishy here!' Pearl's suspicion grew.

Isabella received everyone's praise, but she remained puzzled about who had sent the painting in her name.

Noticing the butler leaving the banquet hall, Isabella quickly made an excuse to go to the restroom. In reality, she intercepted the butler, Charles Green, outside the hall.

"Charles, can you tell me who sent the painting in my name?" Isabella asked, looking at Charles hopefully.

Charles smiled and pointed in a direction, "It was John's uncle. He told me to do it. Want to thank him? I can show you the way."

Isabella's heart raced. She had always wanted to thank John's uncle, but John never took her. Now, she finally had the chance.

"Thanks, Charles. I want to thank Mr. Williams in person," Isabella said, following Charles to the lounge.

'Rumor has it John's uncle is young and very handsome. Now, I finally get to see him. I wonder if he's more handsome than Michael.' Isabella's heart was full of anticipation.

After a short walk, Charles stopped at a door and smiled, "Ms. Taylor, here we are. I'll leave you to it."

Isabella nodded and waited until Charles left before gently knocking on the door, holding her breath for a response.

After knocking three times, there was no answer.

Isabella tentatively called out, "Mr. Williams, are you there? It's Isabella. I want to thank you."

"What are you shouting at an empty room for?" a deep, familiar voice suddenly sounded behind her, making Isabella jump.

She turned around in a panic and saw Michael standing there. Surprised, she asked, "What are you doing here?"

Michael stepped closer to Isabella.

In reality, Isabella was even more stunning than on screen, and Michael felt his heart race. "I might just be a mid-level leader at the Williams Group, not high-ranking, but I still have a reason to be here."

Feeling Michael's magnetic presence, Isabella blushed and took a step back. She blinked nervously, "I know you're here for the banquet, but why are you here? This is where John's uncle stays."

Michael teased, "Are you here to find Mr. Williams? Do you have a thing for him?"

His words made Isabella uneasy. "Mr. Williams is someone I respect as an elder. Please don't talk like that."

Michael smirked and suddenly wrapped his arm around Isabella's shoulder, pressing her against the door.

Startled, Isabella's breathing quickened, her heart pounding.

"Don't do this. This place is dangerous and easily discovered. If the Williams Family finds out, you're done for," Isabella tried to push Michael away, but her strength was no match.

"Don't move," he warned in a low, stern voice.

Isabella froze, feeling her temperature rise and her breathing become rapid. Surprisingly, her body seemed willing to obey Michael's command.

Michael lifted Isabella's chin, her delicate face illuminated by the light like a perfect sculpture.

Nervousness and fear made her eyelashes tremble slightly, adding a strange allure.

Suddenly, Michael's body tensed because he noticed Isabella was crying, and his playful intentions vanished instantly.

"Don't cry, I was just joking," Michael apologized anxiously.

Isabella's eyes welled up, tears streaming down uncontrollably.

"It's not about you. I'm crying for my tragic fate," Isabella suddenly hugged Michael's waist, crying in his arms.

As a young woman barely in her twenties, knowing her end was near, she couldn't help but fear death. Despite trying to appear strong, seeing her parents and John with Bianca made her feel extremely unwilling.

Michael's heart ached to see her cry. He gently wiped the tears from Isabella's face, but they seemed endless.

Isabella suddenly stopped crying because Michael directly cupped her face and kissed her red lips. He was kissing her.

The kiss was intense, and Isabella felt her strength draining, her body almost collapsing if not for Michael holding her tightly against the door.

Just as Isabella felt like she was suffocating, Michael finally released her lips.

"Don't do this. There might be someone in the lounge," Isabella said.

Michael chuckled lightly, picked up Isabella, and opened the door. "No one's here."

Isabella was startled by Michael's actions, but he pushed the door open, revealing an empty room inside.

Michael gently placed Isabella on the sofa, his eyes burning with desire. The kiss from earlier had awakened the 'beast' within him, a primal desire.

During the days Isabella stayed at Amelia's house, Michael had been thinking about her. Biting her lip, Isabella locked eyes with Michael, knowing what was about to happen next.

'Since I'm about to leave this world, I might as well indulge once before I go.' Isabella decided to leave one last mark on the world before her death.

Seeing Isabella close her eyes, Michael understood her inner thoughts. He excitedly moved his hand towards her hip, finding the zipper of her dress.

Isabella's body trembled, and she suddenly hugged Michael, weakly saying, "Be gentle, it's my first time."

Kissing her ear gently, Michael whispered, "Okay."

At that moment, there was suddenly the sound of footsteps outside, followed by the sound of the door handle turning.

###chapter 37 The Truth About Suicide

The two in the lounge jumpy. Isabella clutched Michael's collar, her eyes wide with panic.

"Don't worry, I got this," Michael whispered to her.

Taking a deep breath, Michael pushed down his anger. He stood up, straightened his clothes, and headed for the door.

Michael opened the door and saw John, who was about to speak but had his mouth covered.

"Come with me; we need to talk," Michael said, dragging John away from the lounge.

With the door closed, Isabella could only hear their footsteps fading away. She knew Michael was buying her time. Quickly, she got dressed, peeked out to make sure the coast was clear, and hurried to the restroom to fix her makeup.

Isabella planned to touch up in front of the sink, but her flushed cheeks and frazzled look made her think twice. She ducked into a stall and pulled out a small mirror.

Just then, she heard Mia's voice outside. "Bianca, thanks to your idea, once Isabella and John are married, I'll make sure you're taken care of."

"Thanks, Mia. Isabella's all about family. If you threaten her with your life, she'll cave," Bianca's sweet voice felt like daggers to Isabella.

"Bianca, you snake," Isabella, angry, pushed the stall door open.

Mia was about to urge Isabella to go on stage to announce the wedding, but she was startled by Isabella's sudden appearance, as was Bianca, and the bathroom fell eerily silent.

"Isabella," Bianca stammered, trying to wheel away.

Isabella stormed up to her and slapped her hard. The slap echoed in the restroom. Bianca's face swelled up instantly.

She lost it, stood up from the wheelchair, and flailed her arms, "Isabella, you lunatic!"

Mia tried to step in, but Isabella shoved her aside. Isabella then kicked the wheelchair, sending Bianca sprawling on the floor.

"Isabella, stop! Bianca's your cousin," Mia cried, rushing to hold Isabella back.

Isabella shoved Mia away again, grabbed a vase from the sink, smashed it, and held the shards to Bianca's throat. Mia froze, too scared to move.

"Isabella, have you lost your mind?" Mia gasped.

"If I have, it's because of you all!" Isabella shouted, her eyes red with rage.

Pressing the sharp shards to Bianca's throat, a trickle of blood appeared. "Tell me, did you make my parents threaten me with suicide?"

Bianca cowered on the floor, shaking.

It was true. Mia and Jasper had threatened Isabella with suicide to force her to marry John, and it was Bianca's idea.

Bianca hadn't wanted to do it, but John had told her Michael was overseas looking for a kidney donor for her. Bianca knew she was running out of time. If it came out that her kidney didn't match Isabella's, all her lies would unravel.

Luckily, John didn't catch on. She still had a shot.

"Think staying quiet will save you?" Isabella yanked Bianca's hair, pressing the shards against her face this time.

"If I mess up your face, will John still want you?" Isabella's words finally broke Bianca.

In sheer terror, Bianca snapped. "Even if you know it was me, so what? Will you defy your parents? Watch them die in front of you?"

Isabella pulled so hard she nearly ripped Bianca's scalp off. With bloodshot eyes, she glared at Bianca.

Bianca shook with fear. Isabella's stare could've burned a hole through her.

"Isabella, please, don't do anything rash. Just listen to us this once, okay?" Mia begged, kneeling in front of her.

Isabella looked at Mia on the ground, feeling a wave of sadness.

She slowly let go of Bianca's hair and, with a cold smile, said, "Alright, you want me to marry John so badly? I'll go announce it now, and I want you to be my bridesmaid. I want you to witness my 'happiness,' from picking out the ring to the wedding. Remember, you made a big promise in front of everyone. If you dare to marry John, Mason will be the first to object."

Isabella tossed the shards aside and walked out of the restroom.

"Isabella, you witch! You can't do this, or I'll haunt you even after I'm dead," Bianca screamed, crawling on the floor, trying to grab Isabella's feet.

Isabella kicked Bianca's hand away and left the restroom. If no one wanted her to be happy, she'd make sure no one was.

As she walked out, she caught her reflection in a glass mirror on the wall. She looked up, staring at the woman with red eyes and messy hair.

'Is this me? Yeah, this is me, a woman betrayed by everyone she loves.' Isabella thought, feeling a wave of sadness.

'They all want me dead, so why not take them all down with me and then end it? It's all the same in the end.' Dark thoughts started creeping into her mind, slowly eating away at her sanity.

Suddenly, a door opened, and a bright light poured in. Isabella looked up and saw a pair of concerned eyes. A ray of light pierced through her dark thoughts.

Michael saw Isabella crying again, his heart aching. He rushed over and asked, "Why are you crying again?"

This was the second time he'd seen her cry that day.

Isabella quickly wiped her tears and tried to fix her hair and makeup. She didn't want Michael to see her like this.

"It's nothing. Just got something in my eye," she lied, turning around after fixing her makeup.

Michael gently wiped away the tears from the corner of her eyes, not calling out her lie.

"Before you say anything, I want to show you something," Michael said, pulling out a piece of paper.

"What is it?" Isabella asked, taking it curiously, then froze.

It was a property deed, and more importantly, it had her name on it. From the details, Isabella quickly realized it was the mansion Michael had shown her last time.

###chapter 38 She Wanted to Live

Isabella clutched the property deed, her hands trembling like crazy.

"Why are you doing this? I'm not worth it!" Tears streamed down her face.

Michael closed his eyes for a moment, gently rubbing her hand with his fingertips. "I told you before, whether it's worth it or not, that's for me to decide."

His gaze was so intense, it felt like it could melt her.

'There are still people who care about me in this world. They want to push me into the abyss, but it's not that easy.' Isabella thought, feeling deeply moved as she held the deed.

Michael could tell, even though she wasn't saying anything, that her eyes were filled with growing affection.

As he stared at her, Isabella's face turned red. She stammered, "You're too domineering, but you shouldn't spend money like this. We don't need such a big mansion."

Michael felt a rush of happiness. Her words showed she was willing to be with him.

"Michael, I appreciate the mansion and putting my name on the deed, but I can't accept it. Don't try to fool me with the lottery story. Big wins always get reported, and no one mentioned this one. So don't lie to me." Isabella looked up at him seriously.

Michael smiled. She was worried about him.

"What if I told you this money means nothing to me? A mansion is just another number in my assets." He smiled at her. To him, it was just another addition to his wealth.

"Don't deceive me. Even as a senior employee at the Williams Group, it would take centuries to buy a mansion in Everglow City, let alone for a middle-level employee like you." Isabella rolled her eyes. Her parents still lived in their mansion thanks to the Williams Family's secret support.

Michael knew he needed a convincing reason. Frowning, he thought for a moment and then said, "Actually, I got it cheap because it's supposedly haunted and no one wanted to buy it."

Isabella blinked, "Really?"

Michael nodded, "Yeah. The first owner died tragically, and the murderer was never caught. Later owners claimed they heard a woman's screams every night and saw crimson liquid flowing from the pipes. But I checked, and there's nothing like that."

He told a cheesy ghost story, trying to sound mysterious. But instead of being scared, Isabella looked amused.

"Aren't you afraid? It's a ghost," Michael said, making a ghostly face, which only made her laugh.

"I'm not afraid. What's scarier than ghosts is human nature. Isn't Bianca more ruthless than any ghost?" Isabella smiled.

Michael knew she felt wronged. He held her hand again, gently comforting her. "You're brave. That's good because you can protect me. I'm afraid of ghosts."

Isabella rolled her eyes, finding Michael's current look pretty cute.

She held the property deed, biting her lip. A voice in her head screamed that she was about to announce her engagement with John, and she couldn't accept such a valuable gift.

But then she looked up at Michael's deep features and felt a profound love from him. In that moment, she suddenly wanted to live. Tears welled up in her eyes again.

Michael cupped her face with both hands, affectionately asking, "Why do you cry so much? You should have a lot in common with the ghost in that haunted house."

Playfully pushing his hands away, Isabella retorted, "You coward, you should have something in common with those ghosts too."

Watching her playful reaction, Michael felt his heart melting. He instinctively leaned down and gently kissed her forehead.

Blushing, Isabella gently pushed him away, creating some distance. "I should go back. I've been away too long, and Mason will be looking for me."

Shyly turning around, she quickly walked away.

Her legs felt weak, and she feared that if she stayed any longer, she would fall back into Michael's arms.

Isabella's mind was filled with Michael's face. He had a damn charm she couldn't forget, leading her to bump into John, who was walking towards her.

Seeing the blush on her cheeks, John thought she was blushing because of him and sarcastically remarked, "Is it my charm that's making you unable to resist me again?"

When Isabella saw John, her good mood vanished instantly. She didn't want to interact with the jerk. She chose to walk past him expressionlessly. However, before she could take a few steps, John grabbed her.

"Let's end this game. When are you going to announce our marriage, and when are you going to divorce?" John impatiently asked.

Isabella was like an angry cat, forcefully breaking free from his grip and glaring at him with fierce eyes.

"John, stop acting so self-righteous. I once thought you were an excellent and ambitious nobleman, but since I got married, I've realized that you don't even come close to measuring up to my husband!" Her eyes were fierce as she spoke coldly to him.

John might have more money, connections, and business savvy, but in her eyes, Michael was a devoted husband who always put her needs first.

John was just a fool deceived by Bianca!

Isabella spoke her mind, ignoring the fact that her words might have angered John.

Angered, John grabbed her by the neck and pushed her against the wall. Isabella grabbed his hand, biting her lip, staring at him defiantly.

Furrowing his brows, John coldly spoke, "Are you trying to provoke me this way? A nobody dares to compare to me? Stop pretending. You know it won't work on me, don't you?"

She forcefully hit his arms, feeling dizzy. The lack of oxygen made her lungs feel like they were about to burst.

Crossing his arms, John smirked and leaned closer, "You seem good at pleasing my family. How about pleasing me?"

The suffocating fear, coupled with his words, pushed Isabella into complete anger. She raised her foot fiercely and kicked towards his crotch.

###chapter 39 Isabella Got Married

John's body shook like a leaf for a second. He dropped to his knees, clutching his crotch, veins popping out on his forehead from the pain.

Isabella finally caught her breath, bolting away from John and sprinting towards the banquet hall. She knew Mason was the only one who could keep her safe.

"Damn it, Isabella," John grunted, using the wall to pull himself up, instinctively wanting to chase after her.

"John." Bianca suddenly appeared. She had initially wanted John to teach Isabella a lesson, but now it looked like John was worse off than her.

John turned around and saw Bianca's swollen left cheek. He frowned and asked, "What happened to your face?"

Bianca opened her mouth but quickly thought of a better plan. She didn't answer his question and instead put on a hurt expression.

"John, can you help me with something?" Bianca's eyes looked like they were about to spill over with tears.

John wiped away her tears, trying to comfort her. "Sure, tell me."

Bianca bit her lip and said, "Isabella wants to announce your engagement at the birthday party to surprise Mr. Williams."

John frowned.

Bianca started crying, "I want you to marry Isabella. I've sworn not to marry you, and my health is getting worse. I probably won't last long. I just want to see you happy."

John thought about Isabella's past insults, feeling a surge of irritation. He waved his hand impatiently. "Stop it; I'm not marrying Isabella!"

Seeing the familiar look of disgust in John's eyes, Bianca finally felt relieved.

"But I might not live to see that day; my condition is getting worse. I just want to see you happy." Bianca tearfully told her most vicious lie, and sure enough, John believed her once again.

John grabbed Bianca's hand, his heart aching. "Don't worry. I'll marry Isabella, but right after the wedding, I'll arrange for you and her to have surgery immediately. I want you to live well!"

Bianca cried and hugged John. Behind the clueless John, Bianca revealed a wicked smile.

Inside the banquet hall.

Isabella had no idea Bianca was up to her dirty tricks again. As she sat down, Mia and Jasper came up to her.

Mia whispered, "Where did you go? I couldn't find you anywhere!"

Jasper said, "It's time. You should go on stage and announce your engagement with John!"

Isabella glared at Mia and Jasper. "What if I don't want to? Are you still going to threaten me with suicide?"

Mia and Jasper's faces fell, and Isabella tossed the steak knife and fork in front of them. "Go ahead, show me if you have the guts to do it."

Mia and Jasper looked horrified. They stared at the utensils on the ground, but neither of them picked them up.

"Stop pretending you're doing this for my sake. If you really care about me, then kill that bitch Bianca instead of letting her compete with me for John. Sometimes, I really wonder if I'm your daughter." Isabella shot a fierce look at her parents, then turned and walked towards the stage.

The image of Michael popped into Isabella's mind, and this time, she wasn't about to just roll over and accept her crappy fate. She was ready to fight. She was going to fight for a future with Michael.

As Isabella walked past Mason, she stopped next to him.

"Mason, remember when you asked me what reward I wanted?" Isabella asked.

Mason nodded, "Yeah, I remember."

Isabella's smile grew, and with a hint of apology in her eyes, she said, "No matter what I say on stage later, I hope you'll grant my wish."

Mason felt a pang of unease. He glanced over at John chatting with Bianca in the corner, feeling pretty ticked off.

After a moment, Mason nodded. "I'll grant your wish, no matter what you say."

A smile spread across Isabella's face like a blooming flower. She finally stepped onto the stage, but not to announce her marriage to John.

Isabella walked onto the stage, catching everyone's attention. She spoke into the microphone, "Everyone, today I want to announce something worth celebrating at Mr. Williams' birthday party."

With that, Isabella glanced at John.

Many people didn't know about Isabella and John's drama, and they cheered, thinking she was about to announce the engagement.

Jasper, in the audience, let out a sigh of relief, thinking Isabella had come to her senses and was willing to marry John.

"I told you, Isabella is very sensible," Jasper nodded in satisfaction, not noticing Mia's nervous expression.

Earlier in the restroom, Mia had seen Isabella's madness. She didn't think the seemingly crazy Isabella would stay rational.

In the corner, Bianca's eyes flashed with resentment.

'Go ahead and announce it. John is just temporarily with you. When you die, he'll still be mine,' Bianca thought maliciously.

John had a faint smile on his face. Even though he was reluctant, he still had to keep up appearances in front of everyone.

His face flashed with astonishment as he noticed Michael standing in the corner behind Isabella, looking grim.

Everyone in the audience eagerly anticipated Isabella's announcement of her marriage to John. Even the Williams Family members, except for Michael, wore joyful expressions.

Michael clenched his fists, watching Isabella on stage, slowly walking towards her, his steps heavy as if carrying a huge weight.

But just as Michael was about to reach Isabella, he suddenly stopped in his tracks, his expression turning to one of surprise.

Michael, along with everyone in the audience, looked shocked and confused, the earlier joy replaced by bewilderment.

The reason was what Isabella had said on stage. "I know many of you want me to marry John, but I'm sorry. I'm already married, and he's not the groom."

###chapter 40 The Groom is Not John

Isabella's announcement hit everyone like a ton of bricks. They'd heard whispers about her getting hitched, but no one took it seriously. It was just too wild to believe.

"Wait, what? Isabella actually got married, and it's not to John?"

"She gave up being Mrs. Williams? No way! So many people would kill for that spot. Is she nuts?"

"I heard she was marrying some regular guy. Could that be true?"

Michael stood in the shadows, watching Isabella bask in the spotlight. Her smile was radiant, and he knew she was doing this for him. He had somehow become her reason to keep going.

Michael wanted nothing more than to run up and hug her, but he couldn't. He couldn't risk revealing his identity as a member of the Williams Family to her.

The crowd's murmurs washed over Isabella like waves, but she stood firm, letting them say whatever they wanted.

"Ms. Taylor, why would you give up John for someone else? Is this new guy better than John?" someone blurted out, unable to contain their curiosity.

"My husband is just an ordinary guy, not from any big family or the upper class. I chose him over John because he loves me," Isabella said, her smile blooming like a flower.

John's face darkened, her words a clear declaration that there was no love between them.

Even though Isabella was telling the truth, John felt a pang of loss, his heart tightening with nowhere to vent his frustration.

Isabella's words plunged the room into silence, and all eyes darted between her and John.

Charles glanced at Mason, worried. Mason closed his eyes, sighed deeply, and waved his hand.

Charles got the message. He quickly ordered the onlookers to leave.

Soon, the grand hall was empty except for the Taylor and Williams families.

Everyone's eyes kept shifting between Isabella and John, but eventually, they all looked at Mason, the one who had arranged this engagement.

Isabella glanced at Michael in the shadows, smiled, and shook her head slightly, then walked towards Mason.

Michael watched her, his heart in knots. He understood. Isabella was asking him to stay silent, to protect him.

'I've always been the one to face everything head-on. When did it become Isabella's turn to protect me?' Michael thought, clenching his fists so hard his nails dug into his palms.

Isabella crouched down in front of Mason, took his hand, and said, "Mason, you promised to grant my wish. I hope you'll let me out of this engagement."

Mason saw the tears in her eyes and gently wiped them away. He patted her head, sighed, and said, "Everyone has their own path. Maybe I shouldn't have arranged this engagement. It's only caused you trouble."

Mason paused, looked at her with a glimmer of hope, and asked, "Isabella, are you sure you don't want to marry John?"

Isabella nodded. "Yes, my husband treats me well. He truly loves me."

John felt like he'd been punched in the gut, his fists clenching tight.

Mason, curious, asked, "Is he really that good to you?"

Isabella nodded again, a blush creeping up her cheeks as she thought about her moments with Michael in the lounge.

Mason got the hint-John didn't stand a chance anymore.

Mason's breathing got heavy, and he started to tremble. People rushed to check on him.

Feeling anxious, Isabella said, "Mason, I didn't mean to upset you. You can yell at me or whatever, but please take care of yourself."

She never thought that just calling off the engagement would almost make Mason faint.

Isabella wondered how Mason would react if he knew the whole truth. Would it send him straight to the hospital?

After Mason's breathing gradually became steady, he asked, "I don't blame you; this is just how things turned out. But I'm curious about your husband. Can I meet him?"

Isabella nodded shyly, "I'll need to ask him first."

Mason looked at her, a mix of emotions in his eyes, then smiled and said, "Yes, you should ask him if he's willing to meet me."

Mia and Jasper were stunned. Even Mason, who had been the biggest supporter of Isabella and John's relationship, was agreeing to her request.

Jasper quickly said, "Mr. Williams, please don't listen to Isabella! We've met that guy. He can't hold a candle to John."

Mia wanted to chime in but was cut off by Mason.

"I've made up my mind. The engagement between Isabella and John is off. Young people should make their own choices. Let's end this here. John, help me home." Mason waved his hand, signaling for John to come over.

John nodded silently, helping Mason towards the exit. As they were leaving, he couldn't help but glance back at Isabella.

"Don't look back; it's too late for regrets now," Mason's low voice echoed in John's ears.

John quickly averted his gaze and helped Mason leave. The rest of the Williams Family followed Mason out of the banquet hall.

The hall was now empty, except for the Taylor Family and Michael hiding in the shadows.

Jasper looked at Isabella, rage boiling inside him. The Taylor Group was beyond saving, and he and his wife had become a laughingstock.

"Why did you do this? Are you trying to ruin us?" Jasper angrily questioned Isabella.

Isabella looked at Jasper coldly and said, "It's done. You don't have to worry about it anymore because the outcome won't change."

"I'll kill you, you fool!" Jasper, furious, raised his hand to slap Isabella.

Mia opened her mouth but didn't stop him; she looked away instead.

Isabella didn't flinch. She stood there quietly, knowing someone would come to protect her. Sure enough, Michael rushed out from the shadows and grabbed Jasper's wrist.

Jasper, with his wrist held, glared at Michael. "How dare you show up here. Do you know where you are?" Jasper spat.

Michael shook off Jasper's hand, turned around, pulled Isabella up, and stood in front of the Jasper couple. "I've had enough of you. It's time to settle this once and for all."

###chapter 41 Tense Michael

Michael yanked Isabella out of the banquet hall, not realizing someone was still lurking in the shadows.

Once they were gone, Bianca wheeled herself out from behind a pillar.

John and the rest of the Williams family had left with Mason. Bianca didn't dare follow, scared Isabella might beat her up again, so she just stayed hidden.

Bianca had never met John's uncle, so she didn't recognize Michael. She was just a bit jealous that every man Isabella liked was so handsome.

"What's the point of being handsome if he's broke? Anyway, he's definitely not as high-status as John. But hey, at least Isabella can't marry John now, so I kinda got what I wanted," Bianca was smugly talking to herself, but when she smiled, it pulled at the wound on her face, causing her some pain.

Touching the bruises on her face, Bianca's eyes flashed with anger. "Damn you, Isabella. I'll get back at you for this someday."

Meanwhile, Isabella and Michael headed straight to her place after leaving the banquet hall.

Back home, Isabella clung to Michael's hand, sitting on the couch in silence. Michael let her hold his hand, staying quietly by her side.

"Still upset about your parents?" Michael asked gently.

Isabella shook her head. "I lost all hope in them when they threatened me with suicide. I just feel like I hurt Mason too much."

Michael stroked her forehead and pulled her into his arms. "Didn't Mr. Williams say people should always chase their happiness? If marrying John won't make you happy, then there's nothing wrong with going after your own happiness."

Isabella inhaled the faint scent of tobacco from Michael, his strong arms holding her close, and her heart started racing.

Michael felt her body heat up. He looked down and saw her face turning red.

A smile played on Michael's lips. "How about we finish what we started in the lounge?"

Isabella hesitated, remembering how close they were to going all the way in the lounge. If John hadn't interrupted, they might already be a real couple.

Her face turned even redder, but then Michael kissed her. This time, Isabella didn't resist. After an awkward start, she responded to Michael with growing passion.

Michael felt the desire burning inside him like a bomb about to go off. He couldn't hold back anymore. He loosened his tie, took off his shirt, picked up Isabella, and carried her to the bedroom.

At the bedside, they kissed again, the intense, suffocating feeling bringing waves of pleasure. Their primal desires drove them to strip off their clothes.

Just as Isabella was down to her underwear, she suddenly screamed and fell back onto the bed.

Michael's desire-clouded mind snapped back to reality, and he quickly checked on her.

"What's wrong? What happened?" Michael asked, worried.

Isabella winced in pain and pointed to her foot. "I lost my balance in these high heels. I think I twisted my ankle."

Michael quickly checked Isabella's foot, took off her socks, and saw her ankle was a bit swollen.

Worry for Isabella took over Michael's mind. He grabbed the clothes off the floor and started helping her get dressed. "Come on, put your clothes on. We're going to the hospital."

"Isn't that a bit much? It's just a little twist. We can just get some medicine," Isabella said with a weak smile, thinking Michael was overreacting.

But Michael was dead serious. "No, we need to go to the hospital now."

He helped her get dressed, and then carried her to the car and drove to the hospital.

From the parking lot to the hospital entrance, Michael carried Isabella the whole way, drawing curious looks from everyone around, making Isabella feel a bit embarrassed.

Even though all the attention made her shy, Michael's concern made her feel warm inside. Once they got to the doctor's office, Isabella finally got to stand on her own.

The doctor, thinking she was seriously hurt, did a thorough check-up. After a moment, he said, "It's just a twisted ankle. No big deal. I'll prescribe some meds. Just rest at home for a few days."

Isabella nodded, but Michael wasn't having it.

"This is serious. She needs proper care. Get us a high-end room; she needs to stay in the hospital for observation," Michael insisted.

Both Isabella and the doctor were stunned.

"It's just a minor injury. Hospitalization isn't necessary, and you're wasting medical resources," the doctor said, a bit annoyed.

Michael frowned, pulled out a credit card, and said, "I don't care about the cost. My wife needs to stay here tonight."

"No, really!" Isabella blurted out, feeling super embarrassed. She tugged at Michael's clothes, but he wouldn't budge.

The doctor looked at Michael, then at Isabella, and sighed. "Alright, she can stay for three days. Let's see how it goes." He shook his head and arranged for Isabella to be admitted.

As Michael took Isabella to pay, the doctor watched them leave and sighed softly. "This is love."

Once Isabella was settled in the high-end ward, she quickly shut the door, not wanting to see Michael because the whole thing was just too embarrassing.

Michael thought he had acted perfectly reasonably. If he got any more worried, he was ready to call Benjamin over.

Just as he was about to knock on the door and ask Isabella to let him in, his phone rang.

Seeing it was a call from a subordinate, Michael answered. 

"Mr. Williams, we've caught Ms. Taylor's parents. What should we do next?" the subordinate asked.

In a remote house on the outskirts, Jasper and Mia, tied up and terrified, were shaking all over.

###chapter 42 Not Worthy of Sympathy

Michael hesitated for a moment when his team asked him what to do. He finally had an answer.

What Isabella's parents did was ridiculous and maddening, but they were still her family. Even if he couldn't stand them, he wasn't about to kill them.

"Teach them a lesson, make them suffer a bit, but don't kill them," Michael said before hanging up. His guy knew exactly what to do.

Just as he finished giving those orders, his phone rang again.

Michael glanced at the caller ID, frowned, and headed to the hospital rooftop where it was quieter. When he answered, an older voice came through.

"Have you been back home for so long without even giving me a call? Do you know how much I miss you, Michael?" It was his dad, Kenna Williams, teasing him.

Michael sighed, leaning against the railing. "Dad, you know I've been swamped since I got back. The new company just started, and there's a ton to handle."

Before he could finish, Kenna cut him off.

"I get that you're busy, but I heard you're married now. How's the new wife? What's she like?" Kenna's curiosity about Isabella was obvious.

"She's beautiful, gentle, kind, and strong-willed. I think you'd really like her," Michael said, a smile creeping onto his face.

"You don't usually talk about women like this. Sounds like you're really in love. When can you bring her to meet me? I want to see her," Kenna said eagerly.

Michael went quiet for a moment, reminded of what Mason had said. He wasn't ready to face Mason yet.

"Dad, she doesn't know who I really am. To her, I'm just a regular guy. When you meet her, please don't spill the beans," Michael said.

Kenna couldn't help but joke, "Worried she's only with you for the money? Even if she is, so what? Our family's got enough cash for her to spend forever."

"Dad, if you want to meet her, just go along with it," Michael said, a bit frustrated.

"Alright, alright. Never thought I'd have to play along at my age. I'm no actor," Kenna grumbled before hanging up.

As Michael was about to leave the rooftop, he spotted a familiar face downstairs-John.

Michael frowned. He couldn't run into John now, so he decided to leave the hospital.

John was at the hospital because he'd arranged for Bianca to stay there after she got kicked out last time. He brought some fancy dinner for Bianca. As he passed a luxurious ward, he thought he saw Isabella.

John stood at Isabella's door, dinner in hand, unsure if he should knock.

When Isabella called off their marriage, he should've been thrilled-finally free to be with Bianca. But instead, he felt a weird emptiness.

"John, wrong door? I'm over here," Bianca called out, wheeling herself out of another room.

Snapping out of it, John took the dinner into Bianca's ward. As he set the food down, he hesitated. "I think I saw Isabella."

Bianca, about to dig in, froze and stared at him.

"John, you sure you didn't mistake someone else for her? Why would Isabella be here? Or... do you still have feelings for her?" Bianca asked, her voice tinged with jealousy.

John quickly shook his head. "No, I don't love her. It's always been you. I just really think I saw her."

Bianca, curious, wanted to know if Isabella was actually there. They asked a staff member and confirmed it-Isabella was indeed in that fancy ward.

"John, are you going to see her? If you want to, I won't stop you. Our relationship did hurt her a lot," Bianca said, holding his hand, her voice filled with sadness.

John shook his head. "I can't see her. The reason I brought her up is that my grandfather told me today to try to win her back."

'Has Mason lost his mind? Isabella already called off the engagement. Why would he want John to chase her?' Bianca thought, frustrated.

"If it's your grandfather's wish, go ahead. I won't mind," Bianca said, looking down, a bitter smile on her face.

John hugged her gently. "Don't worry. Even if he asks, I won't do it. There's nothing between Isabella and me."

Bianca finally smiled, relieved.

Just then, Bianca's phone rang. The number was unfamiliar. She frowned and answered. The words on the other end left her stunned.

"What happened?" John asked, confused.

After hanging up, Bianca looked at John, bewildered. "That was Isabella's mom. She said she and Jasper were robbed. The thieves took their stuff, tied them up, and whipped them before running off. They managed to escape and took a taxi here, asking us to cover the fare."

John stood there, processing, then headed out of the hospital.

Soon, he returned with Isabella's parents, Jasper and Mia. They were still in their evening gowns, now dirty and stained, with visible whip marks.

###chapter 43 Isabella's Mockery

Isabella's parents looked like they'd been through the wringer. Gone was their party glitz; now they looked like they'd been living on the streets.

"John, you gotta help us! We need to find that thief!" Jasper was fuming, his face red with anger. He'd never been this humiliated before.

John just frowned. He didn't have much sympathy for Jasper and Mia, and their robbery didn't really concern him.

But since Jasper and Mia were Bianca's folks, he figured he could at least call the cops and push them to catch the thief.

Bianca squinted, a new plan forming in her mind to mess with Isabella.

"Jasper, Mia, remember what Isabella's husband said when they left?" Bianca nudged.

John, who'd left early, had no clue what Michael had said, but Jasper and Mia did.

"That jerk said he'd had enough of us and wanted to show us who's boss. This has to be his doing," Mia spat, her face twisted with anger.

Jasper was just as mad. He reached for his phone to call Isabella, only to remember it had been stolen too. He turned to Bianca, looking helpless.

"Bianca, can I use your phone to call Isabella?" Jasper asked.

Bianca shook her head. "No need. Isabella's here in the hospital; she sprained her foot."

John nodded. "Yeah, she's here. I'll take you to her."

John led the worn-out Jasper and Mia to Isabella's room.

Isabella was lying in her hospital bed talking to Amelia when they were suddenly interrupted by a rapid knocking on the door, causing her to frown.

"Who is it?" Isabella called out, opening the door to find John, Jasper, and Mia standing there.

"John, what are you doing here?" Isabella asked, frowning.

She wasn't worried about John seeking revenge; she could always call Mason to handle him.

John pointed at her parents and sneered, "I'm not here for you. Your parents want to see you. Ask your husband what he did to them."

Jasper stormed forward, pointing a finger at Isabella. "How could I have a daughter like you? Teaming up with outsiders to bully us."

Isabella's smile was icy. "How could I have a father like you? You two threatened to kill yourselves to force me to marry John. Is that what parents do?"

John was taken aback. He hadn't expected them to pull something like that. Jasper and Mia looked away, embarrassed, avoiding John's gaze.

John, who already had little respect for Isabella's parents, now looked down on them even more.

Even though John despised Jasper and Mia, he had to side with them because he was using their being bullied as an excuse to confront Isabella.

"Even if your parents messed up, that doesn't give your husband the right to bully them!" John said, his voice stern.

Isabella glanced at Jasper and Mia's injuries and sneered, "Got any proof my husband did this? Last time, those marks on your neck were self-inflicted. Who knows what happened this time? Maybe you two are into some weird stuff."

Jasper shook with rage, pointing a trembling finger at Isabella. He and Mia were too old for such accusations.

Before Jasper could retort, Isabella turned to John.

"Even if my husband did hurt them, that's a Taylor family issue. What's it got to do with you, John? You know, I once heard about a guy who lived to be 107. Wanna know his secret?" Isabella asked with a sly smile.

John frowned, confused by the sudden change in topic, but shook his head.

Isabella's smile turned mocking. "He lived so long because he never stuck his nose in other people's business."

John realized she was mocking him, and his anger flared.

"When did you turn into this? You weren't like this before. Now you're just a thug!" John snapped.

Isabella's smile vanished. "Why did I become like this? Because of you all pushing me! Not only can I mock you now, but I can also curse you. You're a piece of crap, a jerk! Just seeing you makes me sick. Get out of my room, or I'll tell your grandpa about the time you almost had my kidney taken out!" Isabella's eyes blazed with fury.

John, seething, knew he couldn't afford to cross Isabella right now, so he stormed out. Jasper and Mia, feeling awkward, followed John out.

After they left, Isabella felt a wave of relief. She closed the door, pulled out her phone, and called Michael.

As soon as he picked up, Isabella asked, "Did you have my parents taught a lesson?"

Michael was silent for a moment, then chuckled. "If I said no, would you believe me?"

"Of course, I believe you!" Isabella replied without hesitation.

Michael was taken aback by her unwavering trust, and it touched him.

He took a deep breath. "Actually, I did it. I thought they needed a wake-up call."

Michael waited, wondering if Isabella would still love him knowing he had acted against her parents.

To his surprise, Isabella's voice was warm. "They did need a lesson. John brought them here to cause trouble, but I gave it right back to him." She sounded proud but then grew worried.

"Even though it felt great to curse John out, I know the Williams family is powerful in this city. If he targets you because of this, you might be in a tough spot," Isabella said, her voice filled with concern.

Michael didn't expect her to be so worried about him. He smiled. "Don't worry; he can't touch me. He doesn't have any evidence."

###chapter 44 Michael's Mood

Michael felt a bit ticked off after hanging up the phone, all because of Isabella's last words.

"Since you told me not to worry, I won't. I trust you," Isabella had said, dead serious.

Michael shoved his phone back into his pocket, still annoyed. He was sure now-he was head over heels for Isabella, and she was clearly into him too.

But that love weighed heavy on him.

'If Isabella knew who I really was, would she still want to marry me? She trusts me, but I've been lying to her.' Michael remembered Isabella saying she couldn't stand anyone from the Williams Family except Mason.

Michael pushed the door open, feeling irritated, and went back to his private room.

Ten women, clearly drunk, were sprawled all over the floor. Benjamin was lounging on the sofa, a bottle of wine dangling from his hand.

"Michael, you're such a weirdo! First time I've seen a guy in a bar with beautiful women, and he's just drinking!" Benjamin quipped.

Michael ignored Benjamin's jabs and plopped down on the sofa, looking all gloomy and deep in thought.

Benjamin noticed Michael's mood and asked, "What's up? Let me guess-it's not work, or you wouldn't be here. Must be about your relationship. Did you and Isabella have a fight?"

Michael just shook his head.

"I'm just thinking, what if Isabella finds out who I really am? She hates being lied to." Michael grabbed a glass of wine and downed it.

Benjamin patted Michael's shoulder sympathetically. "I'm afraid I can't help you with that now, as I haven't experienced it myself. Maybe I'll think of something, but not now."

Michael shot Benjamin a look, not expecting any useful advice.

Benjamin sighed, leaning back on the sofa. "A lie is like a soap bubble-tell one, and you gotta keep blowing more to keep it from popping. But no matter how many pretty bubbles you make, one poke and they're all gone. It's a mess."

Michael grabbed the wine bottle, chugged it, and slammed it on the table.

"If you can't help, stop talking about it. I'm really annoyed!" Michael snapped, getting up and storming out of the bar.

Watching him leave, Benjamin smirked but then frowned.

"I feel like there's something I need to tell Michael... damn, I've had too much to drink, and I can't remember." Benjamin scratched his head, then passed out on the sofa.

Meanwhile, Michael sat in his car, wondering where to go. He really wanted to see Isabella, but he knew John was at the hospital.

"Why am I scared? Even if John finds out, so what? Drive to the hospital!" Michael ordered his driver.

The driver nodded and headed to the hospital where Isabella was.

In her hospital room, Isabella received the clothes Michael had sent over. Among the usual clothes, there were some interesting pieces.

Blushing, Isabella picked up a red lingerie set. It had a cut-out design, with thin fabric barely covering the essentials. She couldn't imagine how she'd look in something so seductive.

"Why did Michael send me this? Does he want me to wear it for him?" Isabella wondered, feeling a sudden urge to try it on.

Just then, she heard a strange noise from the window. She put down the lingerie and looked out, seeing a figure climbing up.

Startled, she thought it was John coming to retaliate. She rushed to lock the window, but a hand blocked it.

Unable to close the window, Isabella instinctively grabbed a lunchbox and hurled it at the intruder. The lunchbox hit Michael's head, and blood trickled down his forehead.

Seeing it was Michael, Isabella was shocked and quickly grabbed tissues to wipe his wound.

"Why is it you? Why are you climbing through the window?" Isabella asked nervously, wanting to take him to a doctor.

"It's just a scratch, no big deal," Michael reassured her, grabbing her hand.

Isabella smelled the strong scent of alcohol on him and frowned. "You should drink less. It's bad for your health and can affect sperm quality, leading to deformed fetuses."

Michael froze. "Have you already thought that far ahead?"

Blushing, Isabella lowered her head. "Isn't that what you're thinking? Why else would you send me that kind of clothing?"

"What clothing? What are you talking about?" Michael looked confused, but then he noticed the pile of clothes on the bed, especially the red lingerie on top.

His expression stiffened. He had his subordinate send some clothes, but he didn't expect lingerie to be included.

'Damn, who bought this? But it does look sexy.' Images of Isabella in the lingerie flashed through his mind, making his throat dry and his Adam's apple bob.

Feeling Michael's rising body temperature and rapid heartbeat, Isabella softly said, "If you want to see, I can wear it for you now."

She held the red lingerie in her hand.

Michael's breathing quickened. He wanted to tell her there was no rush, but he couldn't speak. His brain and eyes seemed to have taken over.

Just then, the door to the hospital room swung open, and Amelia walked in carrying a bag. "Isabella, I brought you what you asked for."

###chapter 45 Amelia's Probe

The room went dead silent.

Amelia shot a look at Isabella, then Michael, and finally at the lingerie in Isabella's hand. She seemed to get the picture.

"Didn't see a thing. Carry on," Amelia chuckled, shutting the door behind her.

Isabella's face turned as red as the lingerie she was holding, and she quickly shoved it under a pile of clothes.

"Sorry, I forgot. I asked Amelia to bring me something. You know, I studied fashion design in college, and I needed something to keep me busy while I'm stuck here." Isabella stammered, clearly embarrassed.

Michael sighed. He was used to her getting flustered at the worst times.

"It's fine. I should've warned you. I forgot people could walk in anytime." Michael tried to sound reassuring, but he was still pretty annoyed.

Just then, the door swung open again, and Amelia walked back in.

"Sorry to barge in, but I saw John, and I really don't want to deal with him right now." Amelia shrugged, looking apologetic.

Hearing John's name made Michael's brow furrow.

John hadn't seen Amelia; he was busy tracking down Isabella's doctor to ask about her husband.

"Ms. Taylor's husband is quite the looker. But, of course, compared to Mr. Williams, he's not as good-looking as you," the doctor said to John, trying to be polite.

John frowned and said, "I don't need flattery. Just give me the facts."

The doctor hesitated, then said, "Well, Ms. Taylor's husband is indeed very handsome. He has an elegant look and a great physique. Even through his shirt, you can tell he's got strong muscles."

The doctor thought back to Michael's appearance. "He's not bulky, but his muscles are well-defined. If he weren't married, he'd definitely catch a lot of women's attention."

John frowned, not expecting the doctor to praise Isabella's husband so much.

"He must really love his wife. Ms. Taylor only sprained her foot and could've rested at home, but he insisted on her being hospitalized, just to be safe. That's love." The doctor looked a bit envious, hinting at his own past.

John didn't care about the doctor's story; he was focused on the fact that Michael loved Isabella a lot.

"Alright, I've heard enough. If you see Isabella's husband again, find a way to keep him here or snap a picture of him secretly." John said before leaving the office.

Standing in the hospital corridor, John's eyes were filled with anger and frustration.

He didn't love Isabella, but he couldn't stand the thought of her being with someone he considered beneath him.

He thought, 'Even if that man is handsome and charming, he is nothing compared to me. After all, I am the heir to the Williams family.'

John had no idea Michael was in Isabella's room at that very moment. Meanwhile, in Isabella's room, she was introducing Amelia and Michael to each other.

Michael already knew about Amelia; he had done his homework on everyone close to Isabella.

"Hey, I've heard a lot about you. You're Isabella's best friend, right?" Michael greeted Amelia with a nod.

Amelia smiled back. "Yeah, she talks about you a lot too. Always saying how handsome you are. I thought she was exaggerating, but I guess not. So, what do you do?"

"I told you, he works at the Williams Group as a mid-level manager," Isabella chimed in.

Amelia looked at Michael, curiosity sparking in her eyes. "Even as a mid-level manager, you must have a specific role, right? Which department are you in?"

Michael grinned. "I'm in the research and development department, working on new cosmetics for the company."

Amelia's interest piqued, and she started asking a bunch of questions about cosmetics. Michael answered all her questions patiently, even breaking down the pros and cons of different brands.

Amelia was surprised by how much Michael knew about cosmetics; she had been trying to test him. "Wow, now I know which products to use. By the way, I have a college friend named Luna Bailey who works in your department. Do you know her?"

Michael shook his head and chuckled, "She must be pulling your leg. We don't have anyone by that name in our department."

Amelia laughed, "Looks like Luna's been fibbing. I'll have to tease her about it next time."

Even Isabella noticed something was off; Amelia seemed to be testing Michael on purpose.

Suddenly, Isabella clutched her stomach and said, "Amelia, my stomach hurts. Can you help me to the bathroom?"

"Sure, let's go," Amelia said, helping Isabella to the bathroom.

After they left, Michael sat on the hospital bed, furrowing his brow. He could tell Amelia was testing him, but he didn't get why.

In the bathroom, Amelia said seriously, "I think he's a bit weird!"

Isabella looked at her helplessly. "What's so weird about Michael? Why are you testing him? He seems perfectly normal."

Amelia threw her hands up, exasperated. "You need to pay more attention. Haven't you noticed his aura? It's not what you'd expect from a mid-level manager. He has this noble vibe, like a prince!"

Isabella thought back to when she first met Michael. He always had a mischievous smile, more like an elegant troubadour.

But a troubadour wouldn't climb into someone's house through a water pipe. Michael moved with the grace and strength of a seasoned adventurer.

Isabella remembered Michael climbing into the ward through the water pipe and thought of the red lingerie, her cheeks turning red again.

Amelia saw Isabella's blush and sighed, "Oh my, are you blinded by love? Stay alert!"

###chapter 46 He is No Ordinary Person

Isabella caught wind of Amelia's comments and playfully tapped her forehead. "I'm perfectly clear-headed. What are you trying to say?"

Amelia gave Isabella a nudge and whispered, "Don't you think Michael's a bit off? He says he's just a middle manager, but he acts like he's running the place! I think he's got some hidden agenda getting close to you!"

Isabella rolled her eyes at Amelia's wild theories. She met Michael by chance and didn't see why he'd be interested in her.

Isabella knew she was pretty, but she wasn't drop-dead gorgeous. There were plenty of women more beautiful than her, and she didn't think Michael was joking about marriage.

"Alright, thanks for the heads-up. I'll be careful," Isabella said, though it was clear she wasn't too worried about it.

Amelia, knowing Isabella better than anyone, could tell what she was thinking. She sighed, "Just be careful, okay? By the way, Mr. Williams wants to meet Michael. Did he say yes?"

Isabella blushed a bit. Mason was like a grandfather to her, and introducing Michael felt like a big deal, almost like meeting the parents.

"I was going to tell him tonight, but then John showed up with my parents," Isabella explained, recounting how Michael had stood up for her.

"So you're worried John might use this to mess with Michael?" Amelia guessed, understanding Isabella's concern.

Isabella nodded, exasperated. "Yeah, that's why I don't want him meeting Mason. John will definitely tag along."

Amelia waved her hand dismissively. "John's a jerk. He deserves to get hit by a car or at least break his legs so he can't bother anyone."

"Shh, keep it down. Bianca and that jerk John are in this hospital too. We don't want them hearing us," Isabella said, peeking outside the restroom and feeling relieved when she saw no one.

"What are they gonna do? I'm not scared. And don't get me started on that witch Pearl. I don't get it. You never try to piss anyone off, but trouble always finds you. Are they nuts?" Amelia ranted, unable to hold back.

As Amelia continued her tirade, they suddenly heard Pearl's voice nearby.

"Where's that bitch Isabella? Where did she go?" Pearl was yelling at a nurse.

Isabella and Amelia peeked out of the restroom.

Seeing Pearl, Isabella gave Amelia a look. "You jinxed it!"

Amelia scratched her head, embarrassed. "Sorry, I'll try to be more positive next time."

"Let's go deal with Pearl. If we don't, she'll spread rumors that I'm scared of her," Isabella sighed, stepping out of the restroom with Amelia trailing behind.

"Pearl, this is a hospital, not your personal stage. Stop yelling and disturbing everyone," Isabella said, frowning as she approached.

Pearl's face twisted with anger. "Cut the act, you bitch. I found out that the painting of Eleanor was a gift from John's uncle to Mr. Williams. Did you seduce John's uncle to get that painting?"

Amelia, standing beside Isabella, sneered. "Pearl, not every woman uses their looks to get what they want like you do."

Pearl shot Amelia a venomous glare. "Then explain how she got the money for that expensive painting with her family's business in ruins."

Their argument drew a crowd from the nearby wards.

Bianca, hiding in the back in her wheelchair, smirked coldly. She had leaked Isabella's hospitalization to Pearl and told her that the painting actually belonged to Michael, thanks to John.

"Isabella, let's see how you handle this mess," Bianca said to herself, her lips curling into a malicious smile.

Isabella, unfazed by Pearl's accusations, furrowed her brow. "The elders of the Williams Family are much kinder than you. Maybe they gave me the painting because they couldn't stand seeing me harassed by someone like you."

"That's bullshit! John's uncle is my fiancé; why would he help you?" Pearl screeched, like a cat with its tail stepped on.

Isabella recalled the auction scene and sneered. "At the auction, he wouldn't even let you sit with him. Even when we argued, he chose to help me, not you. Since when did you start dreaming you're his fiancée?"

Isabella's sharp words hit Pearl hard. She screamed and lunged at Isabella, but a large hand grabbed her wrist before she could make contact.

Isabella looked up, surprised to see Mason's bodyguard.

"Let go of me! Do you know who I am? How dare you grab my hand! Who's your boss?" Pearl yelled at the bodyguard.

"He works for me, Ms. Brown. It seems your father never taught you any manners," Mason's voice boomed from the elevator.

The crowd parted as Mason, supported by the bodyguard, walked towards them. Pearl's face fell; she hadn't expected Mason to show up. In the back, Bianca quietly wheeled herself back to her ward.

"Damn it, why is Mason here? Looks like my plan to mess with Isabella failed again," Bianca muttered angrily, cursing Mason under her breath.

###chapter 47 Michael Escaped

Isabella and Pearl had no clue that Bianca had set up their whole argument.

Right then, they both spotted Mason at the same time and rushed over to greet him, flanking him on either side.

"Mr. Williams, I admit I might've overreacted a bit, but it's all because of Isabella. The painting she gave you wasn't even hers; it was from John's uncle. I couldn't stand her lying to you; she's just so vain," Pearl said, clinging to Mason's arm and pouting.

Isabella stayed quiet, knowing Mason would clear things up for her.

Mason shook off Pearl's hand, frowning. "I know exactly whose painting it is. Isabella's right. You all mocked her gift for being too simple, so..."

Pearl cut him off before he could finish. "That's impossible. I'm his fiancée; why would he treat me like this?"

Mason's face darkened as he stared at Pearl. "When did you become his fiancée? Why didn't I know?"

Pearl quickly replied, "At the banquet, you mentioned it. Lots of people heard it; you can't deny it."

Isabella looked at Mason curiously. She had also thought Mason had agreed to Pearl and John's uncle's engagement back then.

Mason angrily tapped his cane. "I meant to give you two a chance to meet. When did I ever mention that you two should get married? His father is still alive, and I have no right to decide who he marries. Besides, he's already married."

Pearl's face went pale. She hadn't expected all her efforts to be a joke. Michael was already married, and she'd been dreaming of marrying into the Williams Family.

Someone in the crowd couldn't help but laugh, and soon others joined in.

Pearl felt the laughter was unbearable and too embarrassing to stay.

"You're hurting me with your words and actions; it's bullying," Pearl cried and ran out of the hospital.

Isabella watched Pearl's retreating figure, a smile forming on her face.

"Mr. Williams, why are you here?" Isabella asked Mason curiously.

Mason looked kindly at Isabella. "I heard you were hospitalized, so I came to check on you. How are you feeling?"

Isabella shook her head. "I'm fine; I just sprained my foot. My husband thought it was serious and insisted on bringing me to the hospital."

Isabella suddenly remembered Michael was still in the room.

'Now that Mason is here, why not let them meet?' she thought, but quickly dismissed it, thinking she should ask Michael first.

"By the way, did your husband agree to meet me?" Mason suddenly asked.

A hint of panic flashed in Isabella's eyes, and she glanced at the hospital room door.

"I haven't asked him yet. Would you mind waiting a bit longer?" Isabella said cautiously.

To her surprise, Mason had already noticed her unusual behavior and the hospital room door.

"I suddenly feel a bit thirsty. Mind if I go in and grab some water?" Mason smiled and opened the hospital room door, catching Isabella off guard.

But to everyone's surprise, the room was empty, except for an open window with the curtains fluttering in the breeze.

Isabella looked at the window, a bit surprised, while Mason's face showed a hint of disappointment. 

"Mr. Williams, let me get you a glass of water," Isabella said, reaching for a cup. But Mason stopped her before she could get up.

"No need. You should rest that injured foot of yours. I just remembered I'm not that thirsty after all. I'll be on my way." Mason smiled, waved, and left Isabella's hospital room.

Isabella and Amelia walked Mason out of the hospital, then headed back to the room.

"I just realized, when Pearl saw no one in your room, Michael must've already left. But where did he go?" Amelia asked, curious.

Isabella smiled bitterly and pointed to the window. Amelia was shocked and leaned out to look. The outside wall was smooth, with only a water pipe to climb.

"Did he climb down from the window? This is the third floor; a fall would at least break a bone," Amelia said, astonished.

Isabella shrugged with a bitter smile. "He didn't just climb down. He climbed up when he came. I thought he was a thief and hit him with a lunchbox."

"Michael's pretty agile. If he can climb buildings, why wouldn't he meet Mr. Williams?" Amelia commented.

Isabella sighed. "This can't go on. I'll just ask him what he wants."

She took out her phone and sent a message to Michael. Meanwhile, Michael arrived at a bar to meet Benjamin.

Benjamin noticed the wound on Michael's forehead and frowned.

"Why'd you come to me only now?" Benjamin asked in a deep voice.

Michael looked puzzled. "Is my injury serious?"

Benjamin shrugged. "You come to me after it's healed. What's the point? This little wound won't even leave a scar."

Michael rolled his eyes, then his phone buzzed. It was a message from Isabella.

Michael looked at the message for a few seconds, then typed a reply: [I can do anything as long as you like it.]

Back in the hospital room, Isabella saw Michael's message and a sweet smile appeared on her face.

In the bar, Benjamin saw the message Michael sent and grinned mischievously.

"Think Mr. Williams will be so mad about you stealing John's fiancée that he'll hit you with his cane?" Benjamin teased.

"If Mason only uses his cane, I can handle it. I just don't know if Isabella will," Michael said irritably, finishing his drink.

Suddenly, Michael's phone rang again. This time, it was a call from John.

John told Michael to hurry back home; Mason had something to discuss with him.

###chapter 48 Conversation

Michael fidgeted with his phone, looking pretty serious.

"Benjamin, what should I do? Should I just come clean to Mason?" Michael asked Benjamin, his eyes pleading.

Benjamin scratched his chin, deep in thought. "Yeah, confessing to Mr. Williams first might be the way to go. Better than ticking off both of them, right? Handle one mess at a time. Sounds like a solid plan."

Michael let out a heavy sigh and said, "Alright, I'll give it a shot."

Benjamin waved lazily from the couch. "Go for it, Michael! If things go south, hit me up. I'm the best surgeon around."

Michael rolled his eyes and walked away, ignoring Benjamin's antics.

When Michael reached the Williams Villa, he found Mason chilling on the sofa, watching TV, leaning on his cane, looking pretty serious.

"John's been digging into Isabella's husband lately, but he's come up empty. I think the guy's got a hidden identity," Mason said, eyeing Michael.

Michael felt a pang of guilt.

"Actually, I..." Michael started, but his voice was too soft, and Mason cut him off.

"I told John to drop the investigation," Mason said.

Michael blinked in surprise. "Why? Weren't you always curious about who Isabella's husband is?"

Michael thought Mason might know something, but Mason's next words made him cringe.

"If John keeps digging, it might piss off Isabella, and then he'll never have a shot with her," Mason sighed.

"I don't get why you're so set on Isabella marrying John. She doesn't love him anymore," Michael frowned.

Mason sighed, "I'm doing this for Isabella's sake. Her grandpa and I were tight. But after he passed, the Taylor Family lost its shine. The business world is brutal; her grandpa made a lot of enemies. I can protect Isabella while I'm alive, but what happens when I'm gone?"

Michael got where Mason was coming from. If Mason died, the only family that could protect Isabella would be the Williams Family. But Isabella was still an outsider, and if she didn't marry John, the Williams Family wouldn't really have her back.

"Plus, Isabella and John were together for 8 years. Haven't you noticed how lost John looks since they broke up? He still cares about her," Mason said with a sly grin.

Michael's brows knitted together, feeling uneasy. Maybe Isabella's long history with John was stirring something inside him.

"Mason, I've heard all about it. Isabella's been into John for 8 years, but he never gave her the time of day. I think John doesn't really like her; he's just jealous someone else has what he thinks is his," Michael said, sticking up for Isabella.

Mason waved him off. "You don't get it. Emotions are tricky. I trust my gut. Just like with your dad and me back in the day. We had a falling out, and he took off overseas. I brought you back to patch things up between us."

Mason grabbed Michael's hand and gave it a reassuring pat, his eyes softening.

Michael licked his lips, feeling his courage to confess to Mason slip away.

'If I tell Mason the truth, will it just cause more drama between him and Dad?' Michael wondered, hesitating.

"Isabella told me her husband agreed to meet me. Wanna come along?" Mason asked out of the blue.

Michael shook his head. "No, I'll pass. The company's swamped with the new cosmetics launch, so I gotta stay on top of that."

Mason didn't seem too bothered. After a bit more chatting, Michael left the Williams Villa.

As he was heading out, he bumped into Charles, who was holding some documents. Michael didn't think much of it.

Charles went straight to Mason and handed him the papers. "Mr. Williams, our team found a lead on Ms. Taylor's husband."

Mason opened the file and saw a photo of a bracelet.

Charles explained, "Ms. Taylor had her husband's bracelet appraised at our jewelry store. She even made a bet with Ms. Brown and won $10 million."

Charles detailed the bet between Isabella and Pearl, mentioning that the Williams family had auctioned off the bracelet.

Mason tossed the documents on the table, his expression cold. "The Taylor Family helped the Brown Family in the past, and they repaid them with betrayal."

"Should we warn the Brown Family?" Charles asked.

Mason shook his head. "A warning won't cut it. If I die, Jasper won't be able to protect Isabella. The best move is still for Isabella to marry John."

Mason sighed, thinking about Isabella and John's rocky relationship. He switched gears and asked, "Any luck finding out who bought the bracelet?"

Charles shook his head. "The buyer's pretty secretive, and the auction was anonymous, so it's tough to track."

"Forget it. We'll find out tomorrow," Mason said, not too worried.

The next day, Isabella got all dolled up and went to the meeting spot with Mason. But when she got there, she realized Michael hadn't shown up.

###chapter 49 You Are Everywhere

Isabella had no clue where Michael had disappeared to. She figured he was just too scared to show up, so she gave him a call to check in.

"I'm swamped at the office. Just hang tight. I'll be there soon. Be patient," Michael said, sounding rushed.

Isabella could hear hurried footsteps and heavy breathing on the other end. It seemed like Michael was really hustling.

"If I'm interrupting your work, you don't have to come. I can handle it," Isabella offered.

Michael couldn't help but smile a bit. "No way I'm letting you deal with this alone. We agreed on this, remember?"

"Alright, I'll wait here," Isabella said with a smile, then hung up and headed upstairs to keep Mason occupied and buy Michael some time.

Michael wasn't lying; work was crazy busy. But he also used it as a way to mask his mixed feelings.

"Screw it. Let my dad and Mason deal with their own stuff. I'm fighting for my love," Michael thought, finally making up his mind as he sprinted to his car.

Just as he was about to get in, someone stopped him.

"Michael, wait," Pearl said, grabbing his hand, looking all upset.

Michael frowned at her. He knew Pearl, almost his fiancée once. She even caused trouble for Isabella at the hospital, making him jump out a window to avoid being seen.

"I've got things to do. I need to see Mason. Don't get in my way," Michael said, trying to get in the car, but Pearl hugged him, pressing her face to his chest.

"Please don't go. I really like you. Everyone thinks I'm a fool, and only you can help me," Pearl cried.

Michael felt a wave of disgust and pushed her away. "I'm warning you, come near me again, and you'll regret it."

Pearl saw the anger on his face and his clenched fists, and she stepped back, scared.

"I heard from Mr. Williams that you're married, but I can't help my feelings for you. Aren't you often abroad? I heard things might be different there," Pearl said, biting her lip.

Michael looked at her with a mocking smile. He didn't see it as love; he thought she was nuts.

"I'm quite shocked by what you just said. I think it's best if we don't continue this conversation," Michael said coldly.

Pearl's face went pale. She clenched her fists and bit her lip. Suddenly, her ears perked up. "But I really care about you. Can't you reconsider?" she said.

Michael's brows furrowed. He couldn't understand why Pearl would go to such lengths. Even her family wouldn't agree.

Suddenly, Michael noticed a faint blue light flashing on Pearl's ear. It was a Bluetooth earpiece. He immediately understood that someone was instructing Pearl to do this. That person was likely Pearl's father, Paxton Brown.

"I will never consider being with you. Please stay away from me, or I won't be polite about it," Michael said, leaning against the car.

Seeing that Pearl still refused to leave, Michael sneered, got into his car, started the engine, and drove off to meet Isabella.

After Michael left, Pearl, with a gloomy face, went to another car in the parking lot and got in.

"I've lowered myself so much, and he still doesn't want me! Am I really your daughter?" Pearl looked at the middle-aged man next to her discontentedly, who was her father, Paxton.

Paxton looked at Pearl coldly and said, "Although Isabella canceled the engagement with John, Mr. Williams will definitely find a way to marry Isabella into the Williams Family to protect her. When that time comes, Isabella will definitely retaliate against our Brown Family. The best way is to marry you into it."

In a sense, Paxton and Jasper were the same kind of people. They could sacrifice anyone for the family.

Pearl knew she had no choice. With a stern face and closed eyes, she asked, "What should we do next? He has rejected me."

Paxton sighed. "Let's go find Mr. Williams. You made a scene at the hospital yesterday, obviously making him angry. We need to go apologize to him and try to salvage his impression of you."

Pearl thought of that night. The scene where Mason protected Isabella made her very resentful, but she had no choice but to do as Paxton said.

Their car left the parking lot and headed towards where Mason was.

On the other side, Michael finally arrived at his destination. After parking the car, he fell silent for a moment and took out a file bag from the passenger seat.

Michael planned to trick Isabella away from Mason first, then meet Mason alone to continue with his original plan. Got one thing done first, then dealt with the other.

Isabella, who was making tea for Mason, suddenly heard her phone ring and saw that Michael was calling, so she answered happily.

"Okay, I'll go downstairs to meet you," Isabella said on the phone before hanging up. Then she looked at Mason.

"Mason, my husband has arrived downstairs. I need to go down to meet him." Isabella said with a smile.

Mason nodded and watched Isabella leave. When Isabella arrived downstairs, Michael leaned against the car, waiting for her.

As Isabella approached, Michael smiled and said, "I have an important document that my subordinate needs to pick up. When he arrives, give him the file. He has seen your photo and knows you, so you don't have to worry about mistaking him. I'll go up first to meet Mr. Williams alone."

###chapter 50 Misunderstandings

Isabella was a bit taken aback when she heard Michael was heading upstairs to meet Mason alone.

"Are you sure about this? Should I call Mr. Williams and ask him to wait a bit longer so we can meet your subordinate together?" Isabella still felt uneasy.

Michael shook his head, touched Isabella's face, and said, "I can't keep Mr. Williams waiting any longer. He might think I'm disrespecting him and get upset."

Isabella thought about it and found Michael's reasoning sound.

"Alright then, good luck! By the way, I've been making tea for Mr. Williams and chatting with him before you arrived, hoping to leave a good impression. So he shouldn't dislike you either." Isabella smiled at Michael, having made a lot of preparations for today's meeting.

Feeling touched, Michael gently caressed Isabella's face, nodded, and then walked upstairs.

Not long after Michael went upstairs, another car pulled into the parking lot.

When Isabella saw Pearl and Paxton getting out, she couldn't help but shake her head.

"Why do I keep running into her everywhere I go?" Isabella muttered.

Pearl and Paxton also saw Isabella, and Pearl's face immediately darkened.

"Isabella, you despicable person!" Pearl thought of the humiliation from yesterday and couldn't swallow her pride.

"I'm going to tear your face apart today." Pearl lunged at Isabella, who was already prepared to fight back.

But Isabella didn't need to do anything as Pearl's arm was already pulled back by Paxton.

"Enough, do you even realize where we are? Mr. Williams is still here. Do you want Isabella to go complain to him?" Paxton, with a stern face, pulled Pearl away.

Although Pearl felt resentful, she didn't dare defy Paxton and could only glare fiercely at Isabella.

Paxton smiled at Isabella and said, "Isabella, it's been a long time. How's your father doing?"

Isabella found Paxton's smile disgusting. Although he appeared to be a kind gentleman on the surface, deep down, he was very malicious, like a cunning, hungry wolf.

"My father is doing very well. He hopes to outlive you every day." Isabella's lips curled into a cold smile as she looked mockingly at Paxton.

The smile disappeared from Paxton's face. Everyone knew there was resentment between them, and there was no need to pretend anymore. He couldn't be bothered to deal with Isabella any longer.

"Isabella, I really want to shut that mouth of yours." Pearl clenched her fists and glared fiercely at Isabella.

Isabella looked back at Pearl coldly.

"No need to talk to her anymore. The Taylor Family won't last much longer anyway. Let's go see Mr. Williams first." Paxton grabbed Pearl and headed upstairs.

Isabella furrowed her brows for a moment but then thought their reason for being here would be to apologize to Mason and restore their image.

Isabella wasn't interested in the Brown Family's affairs. She believed Mason would make the right decision. However, to her surprise, Paxton and Pearl were driven away without even seeing Mason.

"Mr. Williams went to the hospital. Please leave," the bodyguard said coldly, shooing Paxton and his daughter away.

Isabella hung around the parking lot for a bit, finally handing the documents to Michael's subordinate, Jerry Nelson.

Worried about Michael, she hurried into the elevator.

As the elevator doors closed and it started going up, another elevator opened. Paxton and Pearl stepped out.

"Dad, that old man Mason clearly doesn't want to see us," Pearl fumed.

Paxton shook his head. "Not necessarily. Let's first find out what happened to the Williams Family and why they had to go to the hospital."

Paxton and Pearl had left, and when Isabella finally arrived at the private room, she found only Michael sitting at the table, with no sign of Mason.

"Where did Mr. Williams go? How did your conversation go?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

Michael smiled bitterly and shook his head. "I didn't even see Mr. Williams. They said he had something urgent and left in a hurry."

Isabella frowned, unsure of what had happened. Suddenly, Michael pulled her into an embrace.

"Thank you for everything you've done for me," Michael said, his voice full of tenderness.

Isabella's face turned red, and her heart started racing.

"What do you want to do to me? This is a hotel," Isabella said nervously, her voice barely above a whisper.

Feeling Isabella's body temperature rising, Michael reassured her, "Don't worry, no one will come in here. We won't be disturbed this time." He then lowered his head and kissed her.

Isabella's eyes widened as she felt her body weaken. Michael's tongue broke through her lips and entered her mouth.

Gradually, Isabella felt herself losing control. She instinctively wrapped her arms around Michael's neck, responding to his kiss. Their tongues intertwined, and saliva dripped from the corners of their mouths.

The hotel room was filled with a restless atmosphere as primal instincts took over. Michael quickly took off his jacket, revealing his muscular body underneath his shirt.

Before coming, Michael had instructed the bodyguard that no one should enter the room, so he believed they wouldn't be interrupted.

The passionate kiss made Isabella feel breathless. Michael's mouth left hers and kissed her neck, his hot breath making her body even hotter. But then, Isabella's body suddenly stiffened. She saw a lipstick mark on the left side of Michael's shirt.

Her rationality returned instantly. She pushed Michael away and pointed at the lipstick mark, questioning, "Why is there a lipstick mark on your shirt? It's not mine because I didn't wear this shade of lipstick. And I noticed something else. There's a familiar scent on you, a scent I seem to have smelled somewhere before."

Isabella suddenly remembered the conflict with Pearl downstairs earlier, and the scent on Michael seemed to match Pearl's.

###chapter 51 Am I Your Grandson?

Michael glanced down at the lipstick mark on his chest, and his face went pale. He was sure he hadn't been with any other woman, so he didn't know how the lipstick mark got on him.

"You smell like Pearl's perfume. Is that lipstick from her?" Isabella snapped at Michael.

When Isabella mentioned Pearl, it hit Michael-Pearl had thrown herself at him before he left.

"I didn't do anything with Pearl; the lipstick must've rubbed off by accident," Michael protested. He couldn't admit Pearl had thrown herself at him; it would blow his cover as a member of the Williams Family.

But women have a sixth sense about cheating. Isabella quickly figured out Michael was lying.

"If you don't want to tell the truth, fine. I don't need to hear it. We're just married on paper. I'm sorry for thinking you actually cared about me." Isabella turned away, disappointed, and left the room.

Michael watched her go, then looked at the lipstick mark on his chest. Furious, he ripped his shirt off and threw it on the floor.

Isabella stormed out of the hotel. Not only did she fail to get Mason's approval of Michael today, but she also found out about Michael's thing with Pearl.

Today was a total disaster. Isabella could guess why Pearl would try to seduce Michael. That witch Pearl was just trying to piss her off.

Isabella also doubted Michael could resist Pearl. Even though Pearl was a piece of work, she had the looks and the body.

Frustrated, Isabella got home and saw Michael's slippers. She angrily tossed them into the closet and slammed the door.

She thought about throwing out the few clothes Michael had left behind, but for some reason, she couldn't do it. Instead, she stuffed them in a drawer and locked it.

Just as Isabella was about to lie down, her phone rang. It was Mason's butler, Charles.

"Ms. Taylor, we're at the hospital. Can you come over?" Charles said, making Isabella nervous.

"Why are you at the hospital? Did something happen to Mr. Williams?" Isabella asked, worried.

Charles quickly clarified. "No, it's not Mr. Mason Williams. It's Mr. John Williams. He had an accident while street racing today." 

As soon as Charles finished speaking, Isabella was stunned. She remembered chatting with Amelia, who had wished John would have an accident and at least break a leg.

"Is John dead?" Isabella asked quickly.

Charles glanced at his phone in confusion, wondering if he had misheard, because he sensed a hint of anticipation in Isabella's voice.

"Mr. John Williams isn't dead; he just broke a leg. He's still in the hospital. Mr. Mason Williams hopes you can come see him," Charles said.

When Isabella heard that John wasn't dead, she felt a twinge of disappointment. "Alright, I'll be there soon," she said.

Charles hung up, scratching his head. "Am I losing it, or did Ms. Taylor sound a bit disappointed?"

"Did you get through?" Mason's voice cut in.

Charles snapped out of his thoughts and nodded. "Yes, Ms. Taylor is on her way."

In the hospital bed, John lay there with one leg in a cast, suspended in the air.

"Grandpa, why did you have to call her?" John grumbled.

Mason shot him a fierce look. "Shut up. This is your chance. If you can't get Isabella to remarry you, I'll break your other leg and give you another shot."

John's eyes nearly popped out. "Grandpa, am I really your grandson? Isabella can't be your granddaughter, right?"

Mason sneered. "If I had a granddaughter like Isabella, I'd be laughing in my sleep."

A little while later, Isabella arrived at the hospital. Seeing John in such a pitiful state, she couldn't help but smile.

"See? Isabella still likes you. She smiled as soon as she saw you," Mason said to John with a grin.

John's eyes widened. "Which eye of yours saw her smile because of me? She's clearly mocking me!"

"Shut up and remember what I told you," Mason snapped.

John could only close his mouth, defeated.

"Mr. Williams, I've seen John. If there's nothing else, I'll head back now," Isabella said, satisfied with John's miserable state.

Mason grabbed her hand. "Wait, Isabella. John is a picky eater. He doesn't like the food the maid cooks. When he was sick before, you took care of him, right? He says he wants your cooking."

Isabella didn't hesitate to refuse. "I'm sorry, Mr. Williams. I have a husband, and taking care of John would cause misunderstandings."

"Alright, how about this? I'll pay you. Be his caretaker for a few days, just cook for him. If he bullies you, call me, and I'll break his other leg," Mason offered.

After a moment of hesitation, Isabella, who was currently in a design competition and temporarily unemployed, decided to earn some money and agreed. Once Mason left, Isabella didn't rush to the kitchen.

John watched as Isabella approached him. Unable to move his legs, he lay stiffly on the bed, staring at her in horror. "What are you doing? Aren't you going to cook? The kitchen's over there."

Isabella coldly approached his suspended leg. "Do you know how terrified I was lying on the operating table, watching the scalpel come closer? It's a thousand times scarier than what you're feeling now!"

###chapter 52 My Mom's Diamond Ring

Mason and Charles were just about to leave the hospital when they heard John screaming from the ward behind them.

Charles's muscles tensed up a bit. "Mr. Williams, are you really not going to do anything about that?" he asked, a bit unsure.

Mason kept his smile. "Why should I? A little roughhousing between young folks is pretty normal, right? It's just how they bond, I get it."

Mason left the hospital, leaning on his cane, while Charles just pressed his lips together.

"This doesn't sound like flirting at all, more like someone getting back at him," Charles muttered, but he didn't step in either. Mason was John's grandpa, and if he didn't care, why should a butler like him?

Inside the ward, Isabella wasn't doing anything too crazy to John. The worst she did was burn his leg hair with a lighter or pinch his waist.

"Had enough?" John snapped at Isabella.

Isabella smirked. "Can't handle a little pain? I almost bled out on a hospital bed, you know."

"Don't try to fool me with that crap. I don't believe a word you say. Bianca would never do something like that!" John shot back, glaring at her.

Isabella had long given up on John's smarts, but she still had to take Mason's orders seriously.

"Once I'm done cooking, I'm outta here. Just looking at you makes me sick," Isabella snorted and headed to the kitchen.

John's hospital room was top-notch, with a private bathroom and a kitchen for the maid to cook in.

Isabella checked out the kitchen's fancy ingredients, some of the best in the world. Without a second thought, she grabbed a plastic bag, packed the ingredients, then cooked some broccoli, sprinkled a bit of salt, and served it to John.

"You're giving me this? I don't even work out, why this stuff?" John glared at her.

Isabella stared back coldly. "Mason said if you don't eat it, he'll break your legs. So, if you don't like it, too bad."

John shoved the plate of broccoli away. "I'm not eating this. I want a top-notch steak and Boston lobster."

"If you don't eat, I'll make that call," Isabella said, pulling out her phone to find Mason's number.

John, scared of Mason's wrath, reluctantly started eating the broccoli.

"Alright, meal's done, I'm outta here," Isabella said, grabbing the bag of top ingredients and leaving the hospital.

John watched her leave, feeling an unexpected sense of reluctance.

"Damn, do I have a thing for pain?" John angrily threw the empty plate to the ground.

Meanwhile, Isabella got home with the bag of fancy ingredients. As she put them in the fridge, she couldn't help but think of Michael.

"Why am I thinking of Michael? There's not a single good guy out there. I'll eat all this stuff myself and not leave any for him," Isabella muttered at the fridge, but in the end, she didn't eat it all, mostly because she couldn't finish it.

Meanwhile, Michael, totally clueless about what he was missing, hit the bar with Benjamin, downing drink after drink, looking pretty down.

"Seriously, Michael? You're this upset over something so small? It's just a misunderstanding," Benjamin said, shaking his head at Michael's mood.

"So, what should I do? Got any bright ideas? I always feel like there's this invisible wall between us. Even without the Pearl thing, there'd be something else," Michael said, staring into his glass, looking miserable.

Benjamin took a sip of his drink and smirked. "Actually, I do have a plan that'll have Isabella falling for you in three weeks, tops."

Michael's eyes lit up at that.

"Alright, spill it. What's the plan?" he asked, looking hopeful.

Benjamin put down his glass, looking all smug. "It's pretty simple. You know Isabella and Pearl don't get along, right? Just tell her Pearl was trying to make her jealous by flirting with you, and that lipstick mark on your shirt? Blame it on Pearl."

Michael nodded, taking it all in.

Benjamin shrugged and continued, "When a woman starts doubting her partner, even if you tell her it's a misunderstanding, she'll only believe half of it. The other halfis on you to show her you're sincere."

Michael waited, but Benjamin didn't say anything else. Annoyed, he glared at him. "I don't know if Isabella will buy that half, but I swear, if you only give me half a plan, my fist is gonna land on half your face."

Seeing Michael clench his fist, Benjamin chuckled nervously and took a step back. "No need to get violent. You two have been married for ages and you haven't even given her a ring, right? The other half of the plan is simple: give her a wedding ring. Trust me, women go nuts for that."

Michael frowned, then immediately pulled out his phone to check out rings on the big jeweler websites.

Benjamin peeked at his phone and saw prices ranging from tens of thousands to millions of dollars. Suddenly, Michael closed the website and called Kenna directly.

"I want the Eye of Aurora ring. Bring it to me," Michael said, then hung up.

Benjamin, who had just taken a sip of his drink, spat it out in shock.

"Wait, are you talking about the Eye of Aurora? The ring that sold for a billion dollars 30 years ago? There's only one in the world, right?" Benjamin asked, stunned.

Michael nodded casually. "Yeah, my dad bought it and gave it to my mom. After she passed, he planned to give it to my wife."

Benjamin clapped his hands, impressed. "Looks like you finally realized how much you love Isabella."

Putting his phone away, Michael patted Benjamin on the shoulder. "Thanks for the advice, but here's some for you: find a girlfriend while you're still young."

Benjamin watched Michael walk away and sneered. "Only a rough guy like you would fall in love and not want to get out. Smart guys like me never fall in love."

###chapter 53 Michael's Workplace

Michael didn't even bother to turn around when Benjamin started yelling. Some folks had all the book smarts, but when it came to actually doing stuff, they were clueless.

After leaving the bar, Michael paused for a second and decided to head over to Isabella's place.

He had a key to her house from last time. He unlocked the door like a pro and instinctively looked for his slippers, only to find them tossed into the cabinet.

"Seriously? Mad at me and taking it out on my slippers?" Michael muttered, pulling them out and slipping them on, shaking his head.

It was late, and Isabella's place was dark, except for a faint blue glow coming from her bedroom.

"Why's she still up?" Michael wondered, heading to her room. He found her passed out at her desk, her computer still on.

"How come she's still working so late?" Michael said, surprised, but then he saw what was on the screen and froze.

The screen showed some cosmetic design sketches, and they were for the new products his company was about to launch.

'So, Isabella's in on this design competition too. And her stuff looks pretty impressive,' Michael thought, feeling proud. If he didn't have to keep his identity a secret, he'd crown her the winner right then and there.

He looked at her, her hair falling over her face, her lips slightly parted as she slept. He felt a strong urge to kiss her.

'Damn it, calm down. We just had a fight, and we can't afford any misunderstandings right now. Let's wait until the ring is in my hand before we talk.' Michael told himself inwardly. He gently lifted her legs, picked her up, and laid her on the bed.

Even though he was careful, Isabella stirred and opened her eyes as he set her down.

"You're back; I'm so tired," she mumbled, wrapping her arms around his neck before drifting off again.

Once he was sure she was out cold, Michael tucked her in. He watched her sleep, feeling a strong pull to stay by her side all night. 

'She didn't seem mad when she saw me. Maybe she's forgiven me? Maybe I don't need Benjamin's advice after all.' The thought crossed his mind, but he quickly dismissed it. 

Benjamin did have more experience in some areas. He'd stick to the plan; the ring was already on its way. He watched her for a bit longer, then quietly left the room.

The next morning, Isabella woke up in bed, scratching her head as she remembered Michael coming back last night. Suddenly, she jumped up and rushed to her computer. Seeing her design still on the screen, she let out a sigh of relief.

"Thank goodness Michael didn't shut it down. If he hadn't saved it, all my work this week would've been gone," she muttered to herself, relaxing in her chair. Then she caught a whiff of something delicious.

Isabella opened the bedroom door and headed to the kitchen. To her surprise, there was Michael, wearing an apron and cooking up a storm.

"You're up? Perfect timing for breakfast. I found some great ingredients in the fridge, so this should be pretty tasty," Michael said, grinning as he set the food on the table.

The smell was mouthwatering, and Isabella quickly dashed to the bathroom to freshen up before sitting down to eat.

"Wow, your cooking is amazing. I didn't expect this. Looks like I won't need to cook for John later; I'll just use these leftovers," Isabella said, catching Michael off guard.

Michael frowned. "Why do you need to cook for John?"

"Didn't you hear? John got into a car accident. Mason asked me to cook for him and offered to pay me. I don't have a job right now, so I could really use the money," Isabella explained, enjoying her meal.

Michael's eyebrows knitted together. He knew John was in the hospital but didn't expect Mason to ask Isabella to cook for him.

'Is Mason still trying to set up John and Isabella? At least she doesn't seem too thrilled about it,' Michael thought, feeling a bit relieved.

Just then, Michael's phone buzzed with a message saying the ring had been delivered.

"You go ahead and eat. I need to take care of something at the office," Michael said, taking off the apron, slipping on his shoes, and heading out.

Isabella quickly finished her meal. She looked at the leftovers and called John's bodyguard to come over.

She packed the leftovers into a lunch box and handed it to the bodyguard to take to John. With that done, Isabella went back to her computer to continue her design work. The prize for this competition was huge, and she was confident she could win.

When she finally finished her last piece, she stretched and checked the time. It was already afternoon. Just as she was about to make lunch, her phone rang. It was Amelia.

"Isabella, want to see what your husband looks like at work?" Amelia teased, sending a photo right after.

The photo showed Michael's back as he walked into the Williams Group building. Isabella knew Michael worked there but had never seen him in action. People always said men looked their best when working, and she was curious.

"Have you eaten? I'm cooking now; I'll bring you some," Isabella said with a smile.

Amelia rolled her eyes on the other end. "If you want to see Michael, just say so. And go easy on the chili. I've been a bit sensitive to spice lately."

Isabella laughed and hung up, then started preparing a lavish meal.

After finishing, she called John's bodyguard to pick up the food for John, then took a lunch box and headed to see Amelia.

When Amelia saw Isabella with the lunch box, she was stunned.

"Isabella, I have to admit, I'm jealous. You've never brought me anything this fancy," Amelia said, looking at Isabella with a hint of envy.

###chapter 54 Break Her Fingers

Isabella shot Amelia an awkward glance. She'd never whipped up such a fancy meal for her before, mostly because this time, all the ingredients were top-notch, courtesy of John.

"I didn't buy this stuff. We kinda lucked out thanks to some jerk," Isabella quickly spilled the beans about John's mess.

Amelia's jaw dropped. "Wait, my words are that powerful? How did I not know? Maybe I should buy a lottery ticket."

She immediately started making a wish on her phone. "Let me win the $50 million jackpot, let me win the $50 million jackpot, let me win the $50 million jackpot!"

Both of them leaned in, eyes glued to the phone as the lottery numbers were drawn. When the results popped up, they were both floored.

"Amelia, you didn't get a single number right. It's like you dodged all the winning ones on purpose," Isabella chuckled, giving Amelia a pat on the shoulder.

Amelia, looking grim, muttered, "Does my mouth only predict bad stuff? Should I say we're gonna run into Pearl or that witch Bianca next?"

Just as she said that, a familiar car pulled up in front of the Williams Group building. Isabella and Amelia watched in disbelief as Pearl stepped out and walked into the building.

"Should I predict Pearl's gonna get hurt or something?" Amelia whispered.

Rolling her eyes, Isabella grabbed the lunchbox. "You keep predicting; I'm off to deliver food to Michael."

Amelia suddenly stopped her. "Pearl's still upstairs. Aren't you worried about bumping into her?"

Isabella shook her head. "She's probably here to see John's uncle. Michael's on a different floor, so no worries."

After calming Amelia down, Isabella headed to the Williams Group building. She asked the security guard for directions to the product development department and hopped into the elevator.

What she didn't know was that Michael had set up an office in product development to keep up his lie, turning his original office into a rest area.

As Isabella got closer to Michael's office, she heard a woman's voice inside. "This ring is gorgeous. It fits perfectly."

She instantly recognized the voice as Pearl's. Remembering the lipstick mark on Michael's chest, she angrily pushed the door open, startling Pearl.

Thinking it was Michael, Pearl snapped, "What are you doing here? This isn't a place for you."

Isabella ignored her, eyes locked on the diamond ring on Pearl's finger.

"Where'd you get that ring? Why are you here?" Isabella's questions left Pearl momentarily speechless.

A mocking smile spread across Pearl's face. "I'm wearing it, aren't I? Isn't it obvious? Just like you guessed, he gave it to me."

Isabella's face went pale, thinking the ring on Pearl's finger was a gift from her husband, Michael.

Pearl looked smug, hoping Isabella would think the ring was a gift from John's uncle, Michael.

Both women were thinking about the same guy, but they didn't know each other's identities, leading to a pretty clever misunderstanding.

Fuming, Isabella turned and stormed out, leaving a confused Pearl behind.

"She just left like that? Did I win? Why was it so easy this time?" Pearl found it incredibly hard to believe and muttered to herself.

"Well, it's good that she left. This ring is really beautiful. Too bad I don't know who Michael intends to give it to," Pearl said, still talking to herself and even reaching for her phone to snap a pic of the ring.

A cold voice suddenly cut through the air behind her. "You don't need to know who my ring is for. From the moment you put it on, that finger of yours no longer has a reason to exist."

Pearl spun around, startled, to find Michael standing close behind her. His gaze was locked on the ring, and beneath his quiet stare, Pearl sensed a storm brewing.

Michael couldn't believe someone had dared to touch his ring while he was away for just a moment.

"Wait. This ring..." Pearl tried to explain, desperately trying to pull it off, but it seemed stuck on her finger like it was welded there.

Panicking, Pearl's inner turmoil grew, and Michael suddenly grabbed the ring and yanked it forcefully, causing Pearl to scream as her finger got scratched.

"You don't deserve to wear it; you don't need that finger anymore." Michael, in a fit of rage, grabbed the finger on which Pearl had just worn a ring and twisted it forcefully.

With a slight sound of a bone breaking, Pearl's finger was dislocated. She screamed in pain, rolling on the office floor.

"This isn't fair. Isabella also touched this ring just now. Why don't you cut off her hand?" Pearl's mind was very malicious. Even at this moment, she wanted Isabella to share her misfortune.

"Isabella was here?" Michael's heart suddenly tightened. He quickly left Pearl behind and rushed towards the elevator.

When Michael got outside the building, he saw Isabella driving away. Michael quickly ran up and tapped on Isabella's car window. "Isabella, why are you here?"

Isabella, still fuming, didn't give Michael a chance to explain. She stepped on the gas and drove forward quickly. To her shock, Michael actually climbed onto her car.

"Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?" Startled, Isabella quickly hit the brakes, causing Michael to fall off the car due to inertia.

"You're a lunatic," Isabella yelled angrily at Michael, even kicking him.

However, Michael just smiled at Isabella, noticing the lunchbox on the passenger seat.

"Did you come here specifically to bring me dinner?" Michael asked with a grin.

"You're overthinking it. It's for Amelia, who didn't have dinner tonight. I just came to see you on the way," Isabella said, not bothering to look at Michael's displeased face after saying that.

Isabella waved to Amelia, who was standing across the street. When Amelia came over, Isabella handed her the lunchbox.

"You haven't eaten, right? Hurry up and eat," Isabella urged.

###chapter 55 The War of Two Women

Amelia was stunned; she had just eaten and was already full, so there was no way she could eat anything else.

"What are you waiting for? Dig in," Isabella said, opening the lunch box and shoving a piece of beef into Amelia's mouth.

Amelia's eyes welled up, almost tearing up. Not because she was touched, but because she was so full she felt like she might puke. She chewed the beef, but swallowing it was a whole other story.

Isabella finally noticed she was putting Amelia in a tough spot. She pulled Amelia into the car, and this time, with no Michael in the way, they drove off easily.

Michael watched the car's taillights fade with a complicated look on his face.

In the car, Amelia finally managed to swallow the beef. She could finally talk. "What's going on? Are you and Michael fighting?" she asked, curious.

Isabella silently recounted what she saw in the office.

"How could they do that? Damn it, I thought Michael was a good guy, but he couldn't resist Pearl's temptation! Men are always unfaithful," Amelia fumed and asked Isabella to stop the car. She wanted to go back and give Michael a piece of her mind.

"Alright, forget it. I was just guessing. Pearl was the only one in the office at the time. Maybe she was messing with me," Isabella tried to calm Amelia down.

"Yeah, maybe. You should've checked it out earlier," Amelia said, tapping the glass regretfully.

Isabella felt bitter, thinking, 'One coincidence might be a fluke, but two or three? The lipstick stain on the shirt last time, and now the ring. Is my marriage with Michael really just a sham?'

After parting ways with Isabella, Michael felt pretty down, so he went to see Benjamin.

"No way, Michael, why are you two fighting again? Didn't my plan with the ring work?" Benjamin asked, confused.

Usually, Benjamin's plans worked, but for some reason, Michael always messed them up.

"I don't know why Isabella's so mad this time. I didn't even get to give her the ring," Michael said gloomily, taking a drink.

Benjamin knew something was off. "Tell me exactly what happened between you and Isabella."

Michael recounted the evening's events to Benjamin.

Benjamin quickly zeroed in on the issue. "Pearl's the key. Maybe she said something that made Isabella misunderstand. Remember, she caused the lipstick stain on your shirt last time."

"Damn Pearl, breaking one of her fingers is too easy," Michael said angrily, slamming his glass down, ready to confront Pearl.

Benjamin quickly stopped him. "Hold on, Michael. You can't go after Pearl now. If it leads to another misunderstanding, you'll be in even deeper trouble."

"So what do I do?" Michael frowned, looking at Benjamin.

"All suspicions, without solid proof, are just guesses. And as long as they're guesses, they don't matter!" Benjamin said with a confident smile.

"Time will eventually clear up Isabella's doubts. As long as she doesn't catch you and Pearl in bed, your relationship will get back on track," Benjamin's words finally calmed Michael down.

"Like I'd ever sleep with someone like Pearl! Just tell me straight, what should I do?" Michael asked.

Benjamin rubbed his chin, thinking. "Does Isabella have a dream or regret she's always wanted to fulfill? If you help her achieve it, she might be really grateful."

Michael suddenly remembered the makeup design competition Isabella was in. "I know what to do now. Thanks, Benjamin," he said, patting Benjamin's shoulder before rushing out of the bar.

Benjamin looked puzzled. "What did you think of? Tell me! How can I help if you don't share? Wait up!"

He quickly caught up, worried Michael might mess things up again.

"Since we can't give these meals to Michael, what are you gonna do?" Amelia asked, holding the lunch box with a wry smile.

Amelia was worried Isabella would force her to eat more. She was already stuffed, and the food wouldn't be as good the next day.

Isabella sighed and shook her head. "It's fine; we'll just feed it to the dogs."

The next morning, John frowned at the meal in his hand. "Are you sure you made this fresh today and it's not leftovers from last night?"

Isabella nodded seriously. "I made it this morning, but the fridge broke down yesterday, so the ingredients might look a bit off."

John frowned at the meal that looked suspiciously like last night's dinner.

"What's with that face? If you don't want it, don't eat it. I don't feel like cooking for you anyway," Isabella snapped, rolling her eyes and leaving the room.

With no stray dogs around, Isabella decided to be lazy and put the food in the fridge, planning to microwave it the next morning to save time on breakfast.

After delivering the meals, Isabella returned home to find her place trashed. Bianca had smashed her computer.

"Why are you trying to steal John from me? You're already married, you bitch!" Bianca yelled, glaring at Isabella.

Isabella looked at her broken computer, seething with anger. "I spent a week on that project, and you ruined it!"

Furious, Isabella kicked Bianca hard, sending her sprawling. She grabbed Bianca's hair and started slapping her face.

Bianca fought back, and their brawl was so intense that the neighbors called the police. Soon, the cops arrived and took both women to the station.

When Isabella came out, she saw a man standing next to Bianca.

"Hello, Ms. Taylor. I'm Terry Perez from the Williams Group's legal department. We're suing you for the harm you caused my client," Terry said proudly.

"Before you sue me, did your client tell you who I am?" Isabella asked, looking at Terry like he was an idiot.

###chapter 56 Are You an Idiot?

Isabella couldn't believe Terry had the guts to butt into her fight with Bianca.

Terry, standing his ground in front of Isabella, raised an eyebrow. He wasn't sure who Isabella was, but her attitude screamed connections.

"Just so you know, I'm Isabella! I used to be John's fiancée," Isabella sneered at Terry.

Terry thought the name Isabella sounded familiar. After a moment, his face went pale. Seeing Terry's reaction, Isabella knew he had figured out who she was.

"Although I've already broken off the engagement with John, Mr. Mason Williams treats me like his own granddaughter. If you mess with me, I'll report you to him. Mr. Williams might not hurt John, but someone will pay for his anger. Guess who that might be?" Isabella said, patting Terry's arm coldly.

'Bianca, that idiot, told me she just had a spat with someone. Why didn't she tell me the true identity of Isabella?' Terry's face turned white, cursing Bianca in his mind.

Even though the beef between Isabella and Bianca wasn't public knowledge, Terry, working for the Williams Family, had heard some whispers. This task was given by John; he didn't think much of it at first, but now it seemed like a big mess.

"Sorry for the interruption, Ms. Taylor," Terry forced a smile and quickly left the police station.

As he walked out, Bianca stopped him.

"How'd it go? You said you had a way to deal with that bitch Isabella. Is she scared of going to jail now?" Bianca asked eagerly.

'Bianca is such an idiot, almost got me killed, damn it,' Terry cursed Bianca in his head but kept a smile on his face.

"I'm sorry, Ms. Taylor. This is a bit complicated. I need to talk to Mr. Williams first." After saying that politely, Terry left the police station.

Even though Terry wanted to punch Bianca to vent his anger, his position didn't allow it.

John, who was in the hospital, suddenly got a call from Terry.

"What's up, Terry? How's it going?" John asked casually, not really caring who Bianca wanted to mess with, as no one dared to cross him in this city.

Taking a deep breath, Terry said over the phone, "Mr. Williams, Ms. Bianca Taylor wants to deal with Ms. Isabella Taylor. They had a fight today; I checked it out. Ms. Isabella Taylor's stuff got smashed, but it wasn't clear if Ms. Bianca Taylor did it. You know Ms. Isabella Taylor has ties with Mr. Williams. I think we should just drop this."

Terry's plan was to avoid pissing off either side. He already knew Bianca had smashed Isabella's stuff, leading to the fight.

But Terry didn't want to cross Bianca now, so he left it to John to sort out the mess between the two women.

John frowned, realizing Terry might be scared of Mason, so he didn't push him. He told him to finish up at the police station and come back.

After hanging up, Terry let out a big sigh of relief. Finally, he could dodge this mess. Just as he was about to head back to the police station, he spotted a familiar face.

"Mr. Evans, what brings you here?" Terry asked, surprised to see the middle-aged man.

The man was Nathan Evans, a top-notch lawyer and Terry's old mentor. Nathan had been semi-retired for a while and rarely took on cases.

Nathan greeted Terry with a smile, "One of my clients got into a fight. I'm here to help her out."

Terry raised an eyebrow, guessing that Nathan's client was probably Isabella.

"I'm here for a case too, so I won't keep you, Mr. Evans. Please, go ahead." Terry said politely, inviting Nathan into the police station before quickly finding Bianca.

Bianca was on the phone with John.

"I didn't lie to you, John. I just went to talk to Isabella, but she went nuts, smashed stuff, and hit me. I was just defending myself. How could I, in a wheelchair, possibly beat her? I'm the victim here," Bianca whined, tears streaming down her face.

Terry's brow furrowed as he watched Bianca, feeling a wave of disgust.

'Why did Mr. Williams fall for someone straight out of a trashy TV drama?' Terry thought, but he put on a neutral face as Bianca finished her call.

"Ms. Taylor, let's drop it for today. Isabella isn't someone we can mess with," Terry said politely.

Bianca wasn't having it. She pointed to the bruises on her face, fuming, "Why? That bitch Isabella did this to me! Why can't she go to jail?"

Even though Terry was disgusted, he had to lay it out for her.

"Ms. Bianca Taylor, Ms. Isabella Taylor has probably already told Mr. Mason Williams about what happened. He has stepped in. You know what that means," Terry said, giving Bianca a reality check.

Terry didn't actually know if Mason had brought in his mentor Nathan, but it didn't matter. He just wanted out of this mess.

When Bianca heard Mason was involved, she clammed up and silently wheeled herself out of the police station.

"Ms. Taylor, let me help you." Terry said, a cold smile playing on his lips as he helped push her wheelchair. He wanted her out of there before she ran into Isabella.

A few minutes later, Isabella and Nathan left the police station.

"Thanks for your help today, Mr. Evans," Isabella said with a polite smile before saying goodbye.

Nathan watched her leave, puzzled. "Didn't Isabella call off the engagement with John? Why is Michael still helping her like this?"

Isabella had no idea what Nathan was thinking, but she had learned from him that Michael had sent him to help her.

###chapter 57 Michael's Explanation

Isabella was pretty sure she could walk out of the police station without a lawyer, but Michael's actions still made her feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

"It's so nice to be cared for." she thought, a smile tugging at her lips.

Just then, her phone buzzed in her pocket. It was Amelia calling.

As soon as she picked up, Amelia's worried voice came through. "Isabella, I heard you got into it with Bianca and ended up at the police station? Are you okay? That witch didn't give you too much trouble, did she?"

Isabella chuckled. "No, I handled her just fine. She's a woman in a wheelchair; do you think she could fight me? I'm good. Michael got me a top-notch lawyer."

"Thank God you're okay. You had me freaked out. I was actually gonna drop by your place today, but when I got there, it was a mess. Michael was cleaning up and told me you got taken in by the cops," Amelia explained.

Isabella was taken aback. She hadn't expected Amelia to hear about it from Michael, and she wondered how Michael knew.

Isabella quickly realized that it was the neighbor who had called the police, and it was likely that Michael had found out about her fight with Bianca from the neighbor.

"Seriously, I'm fine. I'm heading home now. Let's catch up tomorrow," Isabella said, ending the call with a grin.

She was about to call Michael but figured he might still be at her place, so she decided to head straight home.

When she walked in, she was shocked to see everything back in place. Even the broken stuff had been replaced.

And there was Michael, in the kitchen, whipping up dinner.

"You're back? Go wash up, dinner's ready," Michael said, smiling as he brought out a spread of her favorite dishes.

Seeing all her favorite foods, Isabella felt a lump in her throat.

She used to cook for John, always making his favorites. No one ever cared about what she liked. Except for Amelia, Michael seemed to be the only one who did.

"Why are you tearing up over dinner? No need to get all emotional," Michael teased, wiping away her tears.

"Everything okay at the station? Didn't Nathan sort it out for you?" Michael asked, looking concerned.

Isabella shook her head. "Yeah, Nathan handled it. Everything's cool now. But isn't he retired? How'd you get him to help?"

Michael shrugged. "Just a lucky break. Lawyers make enemies, you know? He got jumped once, and I happened to save his butt. He owed me one."

Isabella nodded, not doubting his story but feeling a bit bummed. "Nathan's a big deal in the legal world. Everyone wants him. My situation wasn't that bad. Bianca wouldn't have dared to do much. Feels like a waste of a big favor."

Michael looked at Isabella and grinned, "To me, anything involving you is a big deal."

Isabella's heart skipped a beat, and she felt her cheeks heat up. Michael sure knew how to say the right things.

'No way, he still hasn't sorted things out with Pearl. I can't fall for the same guy as her,' Isabella thought, trying to keep her emotions in check.

"I'll go wash up," she said, darting into the bathroom and splashing cold water on her face to calm down.

A few minutes later, she finally felt composed and sat back at the table to enjoy the meal Michael had prepared.

The dinner was amazing, all her favorite dishes, and they tasted fantastic.

As Michael watched her eat, something seemed to cross his mind. He hesitated before speaking, "That night you came to the office and got upset, was it because you saw Pearl?"

Isabella stopped eating, her expression souring, but she didn't say anything, which was as good as a yes.

Michael looked at her seriously, "Isabella, trust me. I have zero interest in someone like Pearl. She's just trying to mess with you."

Isabella looked up, uncertainty in her eyes. "Are you serious?"

Michael stood up, looking determined. "If you don't believe me, I'll have someone rough her up right now and bring back a video. Would that convince you?"

His serious tone made Isabella laugh. She shook her head, "No need for that. I'll believe you this time. Pearl does pull some nasty stunts, but you don't need to bother with her. After all, she is also from ne of the big families. Although her family's influence is not as strong as the Williams family, they are not to be easily offended."

Michael felt a warmth in his heart. Isabella still cared about him.

'Even though Isabella believes me this time, Pearl is really a piece of work. I can't deal with her directly right now, but I'll find a way to get some payback for Isabella,' Michael thought, already planning his next move.

Meanwhile, Pearl was having a rough time. Her hand was in a cast because Michael had broken one of her fingers when she wore his ring.

Pearl was seething with anger, but Paxton had warned her not to do anything that would tarnish Michael's reputation and to try to become his woman instead.

"You guys only care about the family, not my reputation! I'm the laughingstock of the city now!" Pearl yelled into her phone, but the call had already ended.

She had just been on the phone with Paxton, who showed no concern for her, only giving orders.

Furious, Pearl left the hospital. Her hand was badly injured, and she had to return for daily check-ups. But as she was leaving the hospital today and getting into her car, she suddenly fell into a sewer.

###chapter 58 I'm in Bed

Pearl let out a scream as she tumbled into the sewer, smacking her head on the wall and blacking out. When she came to, the sewer cover was shut tight.

"This place reeks. Is anyone out there? Help me! Somebody?" Pearl pinched her nose, gagging at the stench and the sludge covering her.

She fumbled for her phone to call for help, but there was no signal down here.

With no other choice, Pearl glanced up at the opening she fell through, gritted her teeth, and started climbing the ladder.

"Just my luck. How the hell was the manhole open? Must be those lazy sewer workers again. City pays them, and this is what we get? When I get out, heads are gonna roll!" Pearl finally reached the top, but no matter how hard she pushed, the cover wouldn't budge.

"What the hell? Is anyone up there? Help me!" Pearl yelled, not knowing that a car was parked right on top of the manhole.

Inside the car, a man pulled out his phone and texted Michael: [Mission accomplished.]

Meanwhile, Michael and Isabella had just finished dinner. He glanced at the message and turned off his phone.

"I'll handle the dishes," Michael said, pocketing his phone and grabbing the dirty plates.

"I can do it," Isabella said, following him into the kitchen.

But as Michael carried the plates, he spilled some soup on the floor. Isabella slipped on it and fell backward.

"Watch out!" Michael caught her by the waist, stopping her fall.

Startled, Isabella straightened up but ended up in Michael's arms. Feeling his warmth and the scent of his cologne, Isabella blushed and looked up into his eyes. Michael held her close, feeling a spark ignite inside him.

"You've done enough today. Let me take care of the dishes," Isabella whispered softly.

"I'm not tired. In fact, I feel like doing a lot more," Michael said, leaning in to kiss her.

Isabella froze for a second, then wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him back passionately.

Their lips moved together, tongues dancing. The heat between them rose, and their desires awakened. The dishes in the sink were forgotten.

Suddenly, Michael lifted Isabella, placing her on the countertop. Now at eye level, they gazed into each other's eyes, desire burning bright.

"No one's gonna bother us tonight, right?" Michael asked, his breath heavy, eyes intense.

Isabella nodded and kissed him again. 

Michael peeled off his shirt, showing off his chiseled upper body. His muscles were like something out of a fitness magazine. 

Isabella's fingers traced the hard lines of his back, her desire growing with every touch. She tilted her head back, offering her neck for Michael's kisses.

Just as Michael started unbuttoning her shirt, revealing her shoulders, Isabella's phone rang out of nowhere. The sudden ringtone made them both jump.

Michael shot a glare at the phone while Isabella answered it, clearly annoyed.

"Why hasn't my dinner been delivered yet? Are you trying to starve me, your employer?" John joked on the other end.

"John, you jerk! That witch Bianca wants to throw me in jail, and you have the nerve to ask about dinner? Tell Mason I quit! And guess what? I'm in bed with a man! Call me again, and next time, I'll burn more than just your leg hair!" Isabella snapped and hung up.

John's face darkened as he stared at his phone.

"Isabella, that damn woman dares to sleep with another man!" he yelled, smashing his phone against the wall.

In the hospital room with him was Bianca, looking none too pleased.

"John, why do you care so much about Isabella? Do you still like her? I can hear the jealousy in your voice," Bianca said, narrowing her eyes.

John took a deep breath. "Don't worry, Bianca. I'm not mad because of that. I just think she should do her job. But she delayed my dinner to sleep with a man; she deserves to be fired."

"Alright, if Isabella won't cook for you, tell me what you want, and I'll get it," Bianca said, smiling sweetly.

John rattled off some food, and Bianca wheeled out of the room. As soon as she was out of sight, her smile turned sinister.

'Don't think I don't know you're jealous, John. Even though Isabella called off the engagement, you still can't forget her! She deserves to pay!' Bianca thought, plotting her next move.

While waiting for the food at the restaurant, Bianca had John's bodyguard bring her a laptop. She plugged in a USB drive filled with Isabella's cosmetic design drafts, each one a masterpiece.

"No one takes John from me. This time, I'll teach you a lesson!" Bianca muttered, a cold smile on her lips as she submitted all of Isabella's work to a cosmetics design competition under her own name.

###chapter 59 Fixing the Computer

Isabella had no clue about Bianca's sneaky plan to use her work against her.

Right now, Isabella was tangled up in bed with Michael. They had a little spark going while washing dishes in the kitchen, but then John called and killed the mood.

Once the call was over, Isabella wrapped her arms around Michael's neck, and he scooped her up, heading straight for the bedroom.

Michael fell back onto the bed with Isabella, and as they rolled around, their clothes started coming off. Soon, Isabella was left in just her black lingerie.

Her skin turned a deep shade of red, a mix of shyness and desire, made even more striking by the black lingerie. Just as Michael began to gently knead her breasts, Isabella opened her eyes a bit.

She shyly whispered, "This is my first time. Can we turn off the lights?"

Michael didn't hesitate. He jumped off the bed, turned off the lights, and the room went pitch black. He found Isabella in the dark, unclasped her bra, and his hands moved back to her breasts.

When his palms touched her, Isabella's body shivered. She felt her breasts being gently massaged, a strange pleasure spreading through her.

She let out a soft moan, feeling Michael's tender touch, not rough but lovingly caressing every inch of her skin.

Michael's fingers traced over her skin. A subtle tremor, like a feather-light tickle, radiated through her core, leaving an ache that wouldn't go away.

Isabella nervously gripped the bedsheets, then felt her panties being slowly pulled down.

'Is it finally happening? I'm about to become a real woman,' she thought nervously, but then a sudden pain hit her stomach.

Isabella's eyes flew open, her face changing. She pushed Michael away and jumped off the bed.

Michael sat there, confused. After a bit, Isabella came back, wrapped in a towel. She turned on the light, looking at Michael with a shy expression. "I'm sorry, but my period just started."

Michael glanced down and saw a few spots of blood on the sheets and the floor. Any frustration he had vanished. He sighed, got off the bed, and left the room. Isabella was puzzled until he came back with a mop.

"You rest. I'll clean up the blood," Michael said with a smile.

Feeling both embarrassed and touched, Isabella sat back on the bed, watching him mop the floor. Michael was only in his underwear, and as he mopped, his muscles moved in rhythm. Isabella bit her lip, eyeing the bulge in his underwear.

"If you don't mind, I heard using hands and mouth is also an option," she said, her face blushing deeply.

Michael stopped mopping, his throat tightening, eyes showing a mix of hesitation and anticipation.

In the end, Michael shook his head. "Let's just forget about it. I'd rather explore those fantasies after we've really been together."

Blushing, Isabella nodded.

After cleaning up, Michael turned off the lights and lay down on Isabella's bed, this time just holding her gently.

"You need to rest during your period. Just holding you like this feels good. It's getting late. Goodnight, honey," Michael's gentle voice echoed in the darkness.

"Goodnight, honey." Isabella gave him a light kiss on the lips, then snuggled into his arms and gradually fell asleep.

The next morning, Michael made breakfast for Isabella again before heading back to work. After breakfast, Isabella took her broken computer to get it fixed.

Since Bianca had smashed it, all the data inside was inaccessible, and Isabella was freaking out because she needed those design drafts for a competition. She went to several repair shops, but they all said her computer was toast. Just when she was about to give up, Amelia called.

"Isabella, have you seen the news today? The cops nabbed a thief who said he found an unlocked car near the hospital and stole some stuff. When they took him back to the scene, they heard someone crying for help from under a manhole cover that was pinned down by a car tire. They rescued Pearl! You have to see the picture on the news; it's hilarious!" Amelia's voice was buzzing with excitement. It seemed like the more unfortunate Pearl was, the happier they were.

Curious, Isabella clicked on the news story Amelia mentioned. Sure enough, there was a photo of Pearl. The always glamorous Pearl looked a mess-her hair was tangled, her clothes were torn, and her face was covered in gross green mud. People around her were pinching their noses. The smell must have been awful. This news lifted Isabella's spirits; it was a good laugh.

After running around the city all day and finding no place to fix her computer, Isabella had no choice but to head home, where Michael had already prepared dinner for her.

"Did you have something to do with Pearl's incident?" Isabella asked Michael, thinking about the news.

Michael nodded. "Yeah, I did. Don't worry. I handled it cleanly, and no one will find out."

Relieved, Isabella nodded, and Michael frowned as he looked at the damaged computer in her arms.

"Did you try to get the computer fixed today?" Michael asked curiously.

Isabella nodded helplessly. "Yeah, Bianca broke it. It had my makeup design drawings in it. I was planning to enter a competition in two days, but now it seems too late."

"What's wrong? Couldn't they fix it? Let me take a look." Michael picked up the computer from Isabella's hands and examined it.

"All the repair guys said it can't be fixed. Looks like I'll have to drop out of the competition this time." Isabella sighed, losing her appetite even for the delicious food in front of her.

"If they didn't say that, how would they make you buy a new one? Leave it to me. I'll fix it." Michael smiled and then made a phone call.

###chapter 60 Michael's Scheme

Isabella and Michael were chilling on the couch, with Isabella leaning in to watch Michael fix her computer.

A few minutes earlier, one of Michael's guys had dropped off all the parts he needed, and Michael got right to work.

Isabella propped her chin up, watching Michael work his magic on the computer. Her heart was pounding as she stared at his intense expression.

"All done. Come check it out," Michael said, turning around to catch Isabella gazing at him like she was in a trance.

"Hey, my face isn't part of the design," Michael teased, grinning at her.

Isabella blushed and shifted her gaze to the computer, her eyes widening in surprise.

"You really fixed it? That's awesome!" she exclaimed, looking at the screen. Even though it was cracked and some images were messed up, she could still transfer her files to a USB drive and get a new computer later.

"I've been into electronics since I was a kid," Michael said, a hint of pride in his voice. Seeing Isabella so happy made him smile too.

"Now, go ahead and upload the design," he said with a grin.

Isabella nodded and quickly uploaded her design. But then, a message popped up on the official website, leaving her stunned.

"What the heck? They're saying my design is a copy?" she said, staring at the screen in disbelief.

Michael frowned. He'd seen her work on that design from scratch, so there was no way she copied it.

"I know someone at this design company. Let me give them a call," Michael said, reaching for his phone. But Isabella stopped him.

"Wait, it might just be a coincidence. Sometimes designs look similar. It's rare, but it happens. Plus, I've got some new ideas. I can tweak it," she said, smiling and brushing it off.

Michael looked worried. "But the deadline's in two days. Can you finish in time?"

Isabella's eyes lit up with determination. "Two days is enough, but I need you to handle the cooking. I need every minute for this."

Michael chuckled. "You're really pushing it. What if you don't win and just end up exhausted? Wouldn't that suck?"

"Let's take the risk!" Isabella said, dead serious.

Michael shrugged. "Alright, good luck. I'll go find some recipes."

He left the room, his expression turning serious as he pulled out his phone and called someone at his company.

"Extend the submission deadline by a week and get me all the current designs by tomorrow," he ordered before hanging up.

Ten minutes later, Isabella burst out of the bedroom and hugged Michael tightly.

"The deadline got extended! I've got enough time to tweak my design. You must be my lucky charm," Isabella said, grinning.

Michael smiled back. "So, do I need to whip up some more meals for you?"

Isabella blinked and then nodded enthusiastically. "Yes! I want to be pampered!"

Michael rolled his eyes playfully. "Alright, Ms. Taylor, your butler at your service. To the bathroom we go!"

With that, he scooped her up and started towards the bathroom.

"Stop! I don't need to go to the bathroom! Put me down!" Isabella blushed, wriggling out of his arms and darting into the bedroom, slamming the door behind her.

Michael laughed heartily outside the door.

The next day at the office, Michael dove into reviewing the competition entries. When he saw Bianca's work, his expression turned icy.

"So, it's you," he muttered, reaching for his phone to give Bianca a piece of his mind. But then he paused.

A brilliant idea struck him. He'd always wanted to build a business empire separate from the Williams Family. Maybe this cosmetics design competition was his chance.

He called his right-hand man, Jerry. "Leak that Bianca is John's lover. Be discreet. No one should trace it back to us."

Jerry nodded and got to work.

Meanwhile, after days of grinding, Isabella finally finished her redesign. She uploaded it to the official website and let out a huge sigh of relief.

She called her friend Amelia. "Hey, let's go shopping this afternoon. I need a break."

"Shopping? With me? What about Michael?" Amelia teased.

Isabella chuckled. "He's been swamped lately, so you're my date today."

"So, I'm just the backup? Ouch! I need a good meal to cheer me up," Amelia joked.

"Deal. Lunch is on me after shopping." With plans set, Isabella and Amelia changed and headed out.

As they shopped, they caught up on the latest gossip.

"Did you hear? Pearl's been MIA since that sewer incident. Probably too embarrassed to show her face," Amelia said, giggling.

Isabella laughed too, remembering the news photos. "Yeah, that was something."

After a good laugh, Isabella got serious. "Okay, enough. Remember your jinx? Every time you mention Pearl, she shows up. It's freaky."

Amelia shrugged. "No, after that scandal, she's probably hiding out for a month."

They walked into a luxury store to buy a handbag, but their smiles vanished when they saw Pearl.

"I'm sorry. I won't mention her again," Amelia said, miming zipping her lips. But it was too late. Pearl had already spotted them.

###chapter 61 Benjamin and Amelia

Amelia always had a knack for getting herself into trouble with her big mouth. No matter how hard she tried to do something good, it always seemed to backfire.

Just then, Pearl saw Isabella and walked over with a cold sneer on her face. "Well, well, look who decided to show up! Didn't you know my family owns this place?"

Isabella frowned. She had no clue about that. The city was divided among the four major families, each owning different businesses, but keeping track of who owned what was impossible.

Isabella was about to drag Amelia away, but Amelia had already found something amusing.

"Pearl, what's up with the cast on your finger? Did you trip and fall in the sewer?" Amelia teased, eyeing Pearl's bandaged finger.

Isabella glanced at Pearl's finger too, surprised. That was the same finger Pearl had worn a ring on the other day.

Pearl quickly hid her hand behind her back, glaring daggers at Amelia.

"Get these two out of here!" Pearl barked at the store staff, who started pushing Isabella and Amelia towards the door.

Naturally, Isabella and Amelia were not thrilled with Pearl's attitude.

Amelia pushed the door open and yelled, "Hey, everyone! This store is bullying customers! They think we're too poor to shop here and want to kick us out! They're even humiliating us!"

Amelia's loud voice quickly drew a crowd on the bustling commercial street, and people started gathering to see what was going on.

Pearl's face turned pale. She did look down on ordinary folks, but she wasn't dumb enough to show it openly.

"Amelia, how dare you spread lies! Do you want me to call the cops?" Pearl shouted, pointing at Amelia.

Amelia stood her ground, hands on her hips. "Did you or did you not order them to kick us out? Just admit it!"

Pearl, who was fuming, suddenly had an idea. She looked at Amelia coldly. "Yeah, I did tell them to kick you out, but not because of your lies! I did it because you came here to cause trouble, claiming everything in my store is fake!"

Amelia's face fell. She had wanted to annoy Pearl, but now, if she and Isabella left, it would look like Pearl was telling the truth.

Isabella sighed, feeling stuck. The crowd was growing, and neither side had any proof. Even if the cops showed up, all they'd do was listen to both sides.

Just then, a voice called out to Isabella. "Isn't this Ms. Taylor? What's going on?" Benjamin pushed through the crowd, curious about the commotion.

Pearl's expression shifted when she saw Benjamin. She knew he was Michael's good friend, so she quickly put on a pitiful look.

"Benjamin, you have to help me! These two women are saying everything in my store is fake! I can't let them slander me like this." Pearl clung to Benjamin's hand, looking at him with pleading eyes.

Benjamin frowned and pulled his arm away from Pearl. "Ms. Brown, I think there's been a misunderstanding. Let's go inside and clear this up." He didn't believe Isabella would do something like that, so he decided to smooth things over.

Pearl had to respect Benjamin, so she shot Isabella a nasty look and led the group back into the store.

Once inside, Benjamin made a quick call, and soon enough, the police arrived to disperse the crowd.

"Ms. Brown, I won't get into the issues between your families. Just do me a favor and let me take these two friends and leave." Benjamin smiled at Pearl and then gestured to Isabella and Amelia.

Isabella nodded and led Amelia out of the store.

"Isabella, who was that guy? He seemed pretty important," Amelia asked, curious.

"He's a top-notch surgeon and a good friend of Michael's. They met at the hospital," Isabella explained.

Isabella noticed Amelia curiously staring at Benjamin and teasingly asked, "Mr. White looks very handsome. Do you have a crush on him?"

Amelia quickly shook her head. "No way, but I did feel like Benjamin was checking me out."

Isabella raised an eyebrow and glanced at Benjamin. He was still talking to Pearl, but her expression suggested she wasn't thrilled with what he was saying.

Soon, Benjamin walked out of the store.

"Let's go; she won't bother you anymore," Benjamin called out, smiling, and turned his gaze to Amelia.

"Ms. Taylor, is this your friend?" Benjamin asked, curious.

Amelia extended her hand. "Hi, I'm Amelia."

"Hello, Benjamin. I'm a friend of Ms. Taylor," he introduced himself simply.

Isabella noticed Benjamin's gaze linger on Amelia for a few seconds before turning back to her.

Benjamin smiled. "Ms. Taylor, I heard you recently entered a cosmetics design competition. Did you ask Michael for help? He knows some of the judges; maybe he can give you a heads-up."

Isabella shook her head, smiling. She knew Michael had connections on the organizing committee, but she had turned down his offer to help.

"Thanks, but I want to do this on my own. I'm confident I'll do well," Isabella said, her smile full of confidence.

Benjamin nodded at her determination and didn't push further. He just changed the subject. Knowing Michael's high regard for Isabella, he was sure Michael would help if needed.

"Well, good luck then. I've got a surgery to prep for, so I need to head out." Benjamin smiled, said his goodbyes, and walked away.

After he was out of sight, Isabella turned to Amelia. "Did you get the wrong idea? I don't think he was interested in you."

Amelia scoffed. "He's playing it cool. Guys are good at that. Didn't you notice he only said goodbye to you and didn't even nod at me? That's not normal behavior."

###chapter 62 Having His Eyes on Amelia

Women can be pretty intuitive around men, and Benjamin had no clue that Amelia was already suspicious of him.

If Benjamin knew what was going through Amelia's mind, he'd probably be amazed at how women can be such mysterious creatures with their uncanny ability to guess things.

Benjamin definitely had his eyes on Amelia.

He walked into this fancy restaurant where Michael was having dinner. Benjamin sat down across from him and started spilling the beans about what just went down.

"That Pearl, I'll deal with her eventually. She's been nothing but trouble," Michael said, a flash of anger in his eyes.

Benjamin waved it off. "We'll get to Pearl later. I got a question for you."

Michael looked at him, curious. "What's on your mind?"

Leaning in, Benjamin asked quietly, "Do you know much about Isabella's friend, Amelia?"

Michael raised an eyebrow but then smirked. "Why do you wanna know? You into her or something?"

Benjamin quickly shook his head. "No, don't get the wrong idea. I just met her today. I'm asking for your sake."

Michael frowned a bit. "What's this got to do with me? If you like her, go for it yourself. You want me to set you up with Amelia?"

Benjamin looked at him, exasperated. "Michael, you know, to win over a woman, you gotta win over her friends too!"

Michael looked intrigued and motioned for him to go on.

Benjamin got serious. "Think about it. If you and Isabella ever have a fight, who do you think she'll vent to? It's gotta be Amelia! If you can get Amelia on your side, then when Isabella's mad at you, Amelia will back you up and help keep things smooth between you two."

Michael had to admit, Benjamin had a point.

Isabella had been hurt by her family and friends before. If she was upset, the only person she'd confide in besides him was Amelia.

"You're onto something, but you're missing one thing," Michael said with a sly smile.

Benjamin raised an eyebrow. "What's that?"

"If I start being nice to Amelia, she might think I have some hidden agenda. Women are pretty cautious about that stuff. And if Isabella finds out, she might think I'm trying to hit on Amelia. That kind of misunderstanding wouldn't be good for any of us," Michael explained, a mysterious glint in his eyes.

Benjamin rubbed his chin, nodding thoughtfully. "Good point. So, you can't be the one to butter up Amelia. You need someone else to do it, someone who knows all about your relationship with Isabella and who you trust completely. So, that person is... me?"

Benjamin pointed at himself, finally catching on to Michael's plan.

Michael patted his shoulder, looking serious. "Benjamin, I'm counting on you to save my marriage!"

Benjamin wanted to kick himself. He'd just meant to give Michael some advice, but now he was roped into the whole thing.

"Hey, Amelia's not bad looking either. It's a win-win. Go for it, Benjamin!" Michael said with a mischievous grin, but then his phone rang.

Michael glanced at the caller ID, and his smile vanished, his brow furrowing.

It was John. When Michael answered, John's anxious voice came through.

"Michael, weren't you supposed to go abroad to help Bianca find a kidney? Have you found one? Her condition's getting worse. I'm worried she won't last much longer," John asked, clearly worried.

A cold glint flashed in Michael's eyes. He knew Bianca was probably manipulating John again, trying to push him into taking Isabella's kidney.

Michael reassured John, "There's a lead. I heard a death row inmate's kidney matches Bianca's. I'm arranging for someone to talk to the inmate's family. I believe we can save Bianca soon."

John was relieved and thanked Michael profusely before hanging up.

Michael's smile disappeared as he turned to Benjamin. "Is Bianca's kidney issue sorted?"

In reality, Michael was lying to John. He hadn't found any death row inmate, but he had plenty of ways to cover up the lie since it was all happening abroad.

Benjamin shook his head. "I've contacted a lot of medical institutions but couldn't find a match. And something's off-Bianca's condition doesn't seem like a typical uremic patient. I need to dig deeper."

Michael nodded, not too worried. After finishing his meal, he stood up to leave.

"I gotta go. Bianca's issue isn't the priority right now. What's crucial is you helping me win over Amelia," Michael said, patting Benjamin's shoulder before leaving the restaurant.

Michael didn't see Isabella for the next few days. The design competition was about to announce its awards, and the organizers were busy prepping for a banquet, keeping Michael tied up.

Two days later, the design competition kicked off, and the awards were announced. Isabella changed into her gown and arrived at the banquet venue, where a lot of people were already gathered, including contestants and guests invited by the organizers.

Amelia tagged along to support Isabella and witness her big moment. She had submitted a design too, but it was pretty half-hearted, just a mix of an invitation, so she wasn't taking the competition too seriously.

Carrying a tray of fruits and snacks, Amelia stuffed her mouth with fruit and asked, "What place do you think you'll get?"

Isabella smiled and shook her head, "I'm being modest. I know there are definitely stronger competitors, so I'll aim for second place."

Amelia rolled her eyes. "You're not modest at all! Try this cheesecake. It's amazing. I heard the chef is some royal chef from a king's palace."

"How can someone come here just to freeload? It's really despicable," a disdainful voice suddenly cut in.

###chapter 63 The First Place is Actually Her

Amelia and Isabella turned around, and when they saw Pearl coming up behind them with a glass of wine, they were both a bit taken aback.

Isabella thought of Amelia's jinxing ability and looked at her in surprise, asking, "Did you mention her again?"

Amelia shook her head, equally shocked. "Why would I? Trying to stir up trouble for us?"

Pearl, meanwhile, was completely ignored by their conversation.

"Are you two just here to freeload? Trust me, I can get security to kick you out," Pearl snapped at Isabella, gripping her glass tightly.

Isabella gave Pearl a cold stare. "We were invited as contestants. Why do we keep running into you everywhere?"

Amelia nodded. "Maybe we should hit up a church tomorrow, get a priest to read us some Bible verses to ward off evil spirits. Maybe even sprinkle some holy water to break the curse."

Isabella agreed with a nod.

Pearl's face darkened. They were treating her like some kind of curse.

Just as Pearl was about to retort, Isabella leaned in and whispered, "Don't forget your current situation. You're the laughingstock of the city's elite. If you keep arguing with us and draw attention, who do you think they'll mock first, me or you?"

Pearl's expression shifted. She didn't want to be here, but there were rumors Michael was hosting. Paxton had ordered her to come to see Michael.

Pearl took a deep breath, her hand gripping the glass so hard her knuckles turned white. She shot a fierce glare at Isabella and Amelia, stomped her foot, and stormed off.

"Wearing stilettos and still stomping around, she's gonna fall," Amelia muttered, rolling her eyes.

As Pearl walked away, she suddenly felt her heel snap, causing her to lose balance and fall sideways into a wheelchair.

Amelia, mid-drink, almost spat out her wine. "Is my mouth really cursed?"

Isabella frowned, not because of Amelia's so-called curse, but because Pearl had fallen on Bianca, who was also at the banquet.

"Is that Bianca? What's she doing here?" Amelia asked, annoyed.

Isabella shrugged. "The host invited some wealthy folks and members of the four major families. Bianca might've come with John."

Isabella never expected Bianca to be a contestant, let alone that Bianca had plagiarized her work.

When Pearl fell on Bianca, she didn't hold back.

"You're just like Isabella. A despicable person, a cripple, both disgusting to look at," Pearl spat at Bianca before limping away to find a place to change her shoes.

Bianca was left speechless and started to resent Isabella, knowing she was being dragged into this mess because of her.

"Just wait, Isabella. When the competition results are announced, you won't believe your eyes," Bianca muttered, a glint of malice in her gaze as she watched Isabella.

Meanwhile, as the guests finally settled in, the banquet officially kicked off.

The host had set aside a section for the contestants, each with their own designated seat. To Isabella's surprise, Bianca wasn't sitting with the invited guests but in the contestants' area.

"Bianca's a contestant? How is that even possible? Can she even draw?" Amelia asked, bewildered.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "She can't even doodle right. You think she can design? Back in school, I used to do her art homework for her."

Amelia gave Bianca a puzzled look. "So, is she just here to freeload like me?"

Isabella glanced at Bianca, her brows knitting together. She certainly didn't think Bianca was here just to freeload at the party; this woman definitely had another motive, but Isabella wasn't sure what it was yet.

Soon, the event host took the stage. After introducing a bunch of new products, he started announcing the winners of the makeup and image design competition.

"Now, announcing the 10th place. The winner is Ellie Thomas." Following the host's announcement, a young woman in a black and white dress walked up to the stage.

All contestants who didn't place would get a set of the host's new cosmetics. For those who did place, the 10th place prize was $10,000, with each higher rank getting an extra $5,000. Starting from 5th place, the prize was $50,000, increasing by $10,000 for each higher rank. The first-place prize was $100,000.

As the host called out names and contestants went up to get their awards, Isabella finally smiled when it was time to announce the second-place winner.

"The second-place winner is Isabella Taylor! She will receive an $80,000 reward! Thank you for your support and for the design you created." At the host's invitation, Isabella went up to receive her award.

Amelia clapped enthusiastically from below. She hadn't expected Isabella to actually win second place.

"Next up is our first-place winner, also our champion tonight, who will receive $100,000 in prize money and an important position in our company! Her name is Bianca Taylor!" As the host announced Bianca's name, the stage erupted in applause once again.

Isabella and Amelia's faces instantly fell.

"How can someone who can't even draw win first place? Is there some shady business going on here?" Amelia fumed.

Watching Bianca being pushed onto the stage, looking all smug, Isabella started to piece things together. 'Bianca must've bought a design from somewhere, entered the competition, and then John must've pulled some strings with the organizers to get her the win. Damn it, I knew there might be some shady dealings, but I never thought she'd actually win!'

###chapter 64 I Want to Thank Isabella

Bianca couldn't help but smirk as she walked past Isabella. Isabella shot her a frosty glare.

But Bianca didn't give a damn. She strutted to the center of the stage, and the host handed her the mic.

"Ms. Taylor, please share your acceptance speech," the host said before stepping aside.

With the microphone in hand, Bianca beamed. "Winning this award was a shocker for me since all my entries were guided by my cousin Isabella. Honestly, I think she's way more talented than me, but the organizers liked my stuff better. I snagged her championship; hope she doesn't hold it against me."

She glanced at Isabella, and the crowd burst into applause and laughter, thinking Bianca was just being funny.

Reporters zeroed in on Isabella, snapping away as her face darkened.

"Today's headline is here; Isabella actually thought the first place was hers!" one reporter exclaimed, thrilled with the shots he got.

Everyone knew about the drama between Isabella and Bianca in high society. The media often caught John visiting Bianca, stirring the pot even more.

The cousins had clashed over John before, and people ate up that kind of gossip.

Isabella noticed the reporters' eager looks but didn't care. Ever since she called off her engagement with John, she couldn't care less about the media's opinions.

But then, out of nowhere, the host handed the microphone to Isabella.

"Ms. Isabella Taylor, do you want to congratulate Ms. Bianca Taylor on her win?" he asked, echoing the audience's curiosity.

Isabella's lips curled into a faint smile. "Of course, I'll congratulate her. I hope she creates even better works in the future and stays at the top of the design world."

Bianca's face fell; she didn't understand design at all, let alone create a better piece than the current one.

Isabella looked at Bianca coldly and thought, 'A fake is a fake. Sooner or later, she'll be exposed. The higher she stands now, the harder she'll fall then.'

The host, bummed that Isabella didn't give him the drama he wanted, turned to the audience. "Next, let's check out the award-winning works from each contestant."

Isabella watched the screen, curious about where Bianca had bought the designs.

Logically, the designs Bianca bought shouldn't be too bad. Even if the organizers were shady, they wouldn't dare put terrible work in first place. That'd be a huge blunder for their new company.

But when Bianca's designs flashed on the big screen, Isabella was floored.

Amelia jumped up, pointing at the screen. "What a joke! That's clearly Isabella's work!"

Amelia had seen Isabella's designs before and recognized them instantly.

Bianca, playing the victim, clutched the microphone and said, "Miss, what are you talking about? I already said I did these under Isabella's guidance. It's not weird for my style to look like hers, right?"

Isabella grabbed the microphone from the host. "I never guided you on anything! You broke into my house, smashed my computer, and stole my work. You thought smashing my computer would keep me from competing, but you didn't count on the organizers extending the deadline, giving me time to finish my designs."

Her words sent shockwaves through the venue.

Right then, Isabella's designs popped up on the big screen. Even folks who didn't know much about design could see the uncanny resemblance between the two sets of work.

The reporters were buzzing with excitement. "This is gold! An invisible 'war' is brewing. Will John get involved? Tomorrow's headline is set!"

The organizers were blindsided by the drama. The event manager whispered something to the host, who nodded and took the stage again.

"Ladies and gentlemen, due to unforeseen circumstances, we're pausing the award ceremony. But the banquet will go on as planned. Enjoy the food!" With that, all the contestants left the stage.

Amelia stormed up to Isabella, fuming. "I can't believe Bianca had the nerve to use your entry! How could the organizers miss the obvious similarities? Didn't they check?"

Isabella shook her head, just as confused. "I'm sure the organizers will explain."

Amelia, still worried, said, "But with John backing Bianca, won't he try to smear you online?"

Isabella's lips curled into a faint smile. "If he tries, I'll just tell Mason. He'll set John straight."

Amelia finally relaxed a bit.

After the banquet, the story of who copied whom between Isabella and Bianca blew up online. Netizens were all over it, debating fiercely.

Some backed Isabella, others sided with Bianca, but everyone agreed to wait for the organizers' investigation.

Later, Jerry filled Michael in on what went down.

"Tell our people to hold off on investigating. Let's see how this plays out. I'll handle it," Michael said before hanging up.

'Even though this mess might help me with Isabella, it's gotta be rough for her,' Michael thought, feeling a pang of guilt. He decided to head over to Isabella's place to be with her.

When Michael got to Isabella's house, she had just said goodbye to Amelia.

To his surprise, Isabella didn't look sad at all.

"I saw the news. I know about you and Bianca. Aren't you worried about the fallout? People are really going at you online," Michael asked, curious.

###chapter 65 Who is the Plagiarist?

Isabella grinned when she heard Michael's worries.

"Isn't it just normal for folks online to throw shade? Even if you're a big movie star, they won't cut you any slack. They'll always find something to nitpick and blow it up. People love jumping on the bandwagon, trash-talking to let off steam," Isabella's words put Michael at ease.

"Didn't think you'd be so chill about it. Looks like those comments don't get to you," Michael said, smiling at Isabella.

Isabella shook her head, still smiling. "Just because I get why people do it doesn't mean I like being insulted. That's why I stay offline."

Isabella was lounging on the couch with a book on image design. Michael noticed what she was reading.

"Looks like you trust the organizers a lot," Michael said.

The top prize would land a key role in a new company. Michael figured Isabella was confident about winning and joining the new company.

Isabella shook her head. "Honestly, I don't care what the organizers think, especially with John's connections. But getting second place still looks good on my resume, no matter where I end up."

Michael smiled, surprised by Isabella's laid-back attitude.

"I bet you'll nail that job at the new company!" Michael grinned.

Isabella smiled back, but then her phone rang. It was Amelia.

As soon as she picked up, Amelia's frantic voice came through. "Isabella, check the news! Those idiots from the organizers are saying you plagiarized Bianca's work!"

Isabella frowned and grabbed her phone to check. Michael scooted closer to see too.

After reading the news, Isabella's fists clenched in anger while Michael's face turned dark.

"There were rumors that even the big families wouldn't mess with this new company, but now it seems like total BS! They're scared of John too!" With that, Isabella quickly dialed Mason.

Michael excused himself to the restroom and made a call to his subordinate.

"The fish took the bait. Make sure we remember who they are. I'll handle them one by one," Michael ordered coldly.

After calling Mason, Isabella told him about her troubles.

"Mason, I just want the truth! Please warn John to stay out of this," Isabella pleaded.

"Don't worry, Isabella. If John's behind this, he won't get away with it!" Mason reassured her before hanging up, his face darkening.

At the hospital, John stared at Bianca, looking for answers.

"Did you really create those works yourself and not steal them from Isabella?" John asked.

Tears welled up in Bianca's eyes as she looked at John, hurt. "John, don't you trust me?"

John's brow furrowed slightly. He didn't want to doubt Bianca, but Isabella had never seemed like the type to falsely accuse someone.

"If you don't believe me, John, I might as well go online and admit I stole the works. I'm not a celebrity; no one will remember me," Bianca said, disappointed, as she wheeled herself toward the computer.

"No, I believe you." John quickly walked over and hugged her.

"I never thought Isabella would do something like this. Her jealousy must be off the charts!" Bianca complained sadly.

John furrowed his brow again. He still didn't want to believe that Isabella was that kind of person.

Suddenly, John's phone rang. He answered and heard Mason's stern voice.

"Did you tell the organizers to announce that Isabella plagiarized Bianca?" Mason's question left John stunned.

"Grandpa, what are you talking about? I didn't tell the organizers anything. Besides, that's Michael's company; I have no say in it." John felt wrongly accused.

Mason was silent for a few seconds before saying, "I'll believe you this time, but I know Isabella wouldn't plagiarize. You need to find out the truth."

"Okay, Grandpa, I got it." After hanging up, John furrowed his brow tightly.

John told Bianca what Mason had said, and she looked confused.

'What is Pearl up to? If the organizers just clear my name, why accuse Isabella of plagiarism?' Bianca felt nervous.

After the banquet, Bianca had met with Pearl. They had planned to use the Brown Family's influence and Bianca's relationship with John to get the organizers to clear her name. With two major families involved, the organizers wouldn't dare to offend them.

But Bianca didn't expect Pearl to be so ruthless. Instead of just defending her, Pearl had turned the tables and accused Isabella of plagiarism.

Now, with Mason involved, Bianca felt a hint of panic. If Pearl's plan was exposed, it wouldn't end well for her.

"Why would the organizers say Isabella plagiarized your work?" John asked Bianca.

Bianca shook her head bitterly. "I don't know. I can assure you Isabella didn't plagiarize my work. Maybe the organizers made a mistake because the styles are similar."

John still believed Bianca. He nodded and prepared to call Michael to discuss investigating the matter.

After Michael left, Bianca immediately called Pearl.

"Why didn't you tell me you were framing Isabella? I have no evidence she plagiarized! I've been in the hospital this whole time. She hasn't even visited me! She has an alibi!" Bianca shouted into her phone.

On the other end, Pearl sneered, thinking that Bianca was just a fool.

###chapter 66 The Plan for Isabella

Pearl hung up the phone, not giving Bianca a second thought. To her, Bianca was just a pawn in her game against Isabella.

As for Bianca betraying her, Pearl was pretty sure Bianca wouldn't dare.

Bianca had always played the sweet, thoughtful girl, even while dealing with her illness. But working with her, Pearl saw just how nasty Bianca could be. If things went south, Bianca would be in just as much trouble, and her goody-two-shoes act in front of John would be toast.

'So, one should never create a persona for oneself. Once it collapses, others will find it hard to accept.' Pearl thought, a smirk forming as she picked up her phone.

"What did Ms. Brown say?" asked the guy across the table, eyeing Pearl with curiosity.

This guy was Tom Harris, a senior exec brought in by Michael from overseas.

"Nothing much, just a yappy Chihuahua. I tossed her a bone, and now she won't leave me alone. Gotta thank Mr. Harris for that," Pearl said with a grin, throwing some shade at Bianca.

Tom had been the one to expose Isabella's plagiarism of Bianca's work. He had a lot of clout in this new company.

Tom swirled his glass of red wine, his eyes on Pearl.

"Thanks for the dinner invite, Ms. Brown. But the wine here isn't that great. I have some much better wine at my place. Would you like to come over for a glass?" Tom smiled, but Pearl saw right through him.

'Does this creep really think he can get into my bed?' Pearl thought, keeping her smile sweet.

"Before you get too cozy, Mr. Harris, I've got some questions. Don't you know about Isabella and Mason? Aren't you worried about ticking Mason off?" Pearl asked, curious.

Tom shook his head, smiling. "Sure, Isabella's got Mason, but what else? Bianca's got John, the heir, and you. Smart folks know where to place their bets."

Pearl sipped her wine, amused. Tom had no clue the "Chihuahua" she mentioned was Bianca.

Tom took a sip too, his face getting a bit more serious. "Isabella might be tight with Mason, but Mason doesn't control me."

"Why's that?" Pearl asked, intrigued.

Tom leaned in, whispering, "There was bad blood between Mason and our CEO's dad. Our CEO's new company was established entirely without the influence of the Williams Family, so if Mason wants to help Isabella to command our CEO, it's very likely that our CEO won't be willing to assist."

Tom looked pleased with himself as he leaned closer, catching a whiff of Pearl's perfume.

Pearl smiled and subtly shifted away from Tom, trying to ignore his sweaty, oily face that was making her feel queasy.

"Got it. Thanks for the info," she said, raising her glass and clinking it with his.

Tom kept trying to get closer, but Pearl skillfully dodged him each time. He didn't seem to mind, though.

'Even though my boss turned her down, Pearl's got this irresistible charm. If I can win her over, her family's backing will skyrocket my position in the company,' Tom thought, already plotting his next moves.

Meanwhile, online comments were overwhelmingly in Bianca's favor. Almost everyone was slamming Isabella for plagiarism.

Even though Bianca told John the organizers might have misunderstood, she didn't clear things up online. She just let the situation blow up.

[How did she have the nerve to accuse Bianca of plagiarism on stage?]

[Don't you know? It's all for John!]

[Women's jealousy is scary. Props to the organizers for clearing Bianca's name.]

[Isabella, as a plagiarist, should be expelled from the design industry!]

"This is driving me nuts! Are the organizers brain-dead? How dare they accuse you of plagiarism?" Amelia fumed, angrily tapping away at her keyboard.

Isabella calmly handed her a grape. "Don't let those comments get to you. Stay cool."

Amelia chewed the grape, still fuming. "How can I stay cool? You're getting roasted online! If you can't prove your innocence, your reputation's gonna be worse than trash."

Isabella smiled, popping a grape into her mouth, lounging barefoot on the couch with a plate of fruit on her lap.

"I trust Michael. He said he's got this, and actually, the organizers reached out to me last night." Isabella winked at Amelia, a mysterious smile playing on her lips.

"The organizers? But aren't they against you?" Amelia asked, confused.

Isabella shrugged. "It's complicated. There are two factions within the organizers. One's targeting me, the other's got my back."

Amelia scratched her head. "This is getting more confusing. And what's Michael got to do with it?"

Isabella shook her head. "I don't know the details, but Michael said he can help, so I believe him."

Amelia rolled her eyes. "Isabella, you're totally love-struck. Michael hasn't even explained, and you trust him blindly!"

Isabella blushed. "I just do!"

Over at Michael's company, Jerry stood in front of him, reporting his findings.

"Mr. Harris played a big role in this mess. As the head of the selection, he ordered his team to smear Ms. Isabella Taylor online," Jerry said respectfully.

Michael tossed the documents onto the table. "Proceed as planned," he said coldly.

###chapter 67 The Truth

The next morning, when Tom walked into the company, he could tell something was off. His coworkers were giving him all sorts of looks-some looked sorry for him, some were pissed, and others had this smug grin.

Just as he was about to hop into the elevator, Jerry showed up with a bunch of people.

"Mr. Harris, come with us," Jerry said, and his two guys grabbed Tom.

Tom, feeling his arm being yanked, snapped at Jerry, "Wait, Jerry, what the hell is going on?"

"Because of your bad calls, the company took a big hit. Mr. Williams is really disappointed in you," Jerry replied coldly.

Tom's face went pale. "No way! I'm Mr. Williams' most loyal guy! I need to see him! Let me talk to Mr. Williams now!"

Jerry just waved his hand. "Take him away!"

Tom fought back, but he couldn't break free. They shoved him into a car and drove off to the police station.

Someone caught the whole thing on video and posted it online.

At first, no one really cared. Tom wasn't exactly a household name. But then the organizers dropped a bombshell, and the internet went nuts.

The organizers: [After our investigation, we found out that a senior executive at our company took bribes and messed with the evaluation results, causing unfair treatment to contestants. Under the chairman's investigation, it turns out the top two designs were both by Isabella Taylor. We sincerely apologize to Isabella Taylor and invite her to be our Chief Design Director.]

Amelia had been glued to the updates, and when she saw the organizers' message, she immediately called Isabella.

"Isabella, check online! They cleared your name, and everyone knows Bianca plagiarized! Bianca's done for!" Amelia shouted excitedly into her phone.

Isabella was thrilled too. She had been keeping it cool, but deep down, she was super anxious.

[How could this happen? Can a senior executive really be bribed?]

[Your new company's credibility is trash!]

[Is Isabella really the victim here?]

[Is this just a power play between these two women?]

[If the organizers say Isabella was wronged, they better show some proof.]

With all the mixed messages, people online were still skeptical. But then the organizers dropped some video evidence.

The video showed Bianca and Isabella in a room, separated by a curtain, each with a whiteboard and a pen.

"Please write down your design concepts for this product," someone off-camera, probably an investigator, said.

In the video, Bianca looked super uneasy. She wrote really slowly, constantly glancing towards Isabella, even though the curtain blocked her view.

Isabella wrote quickly and confidently, showing off her whiteboard after just a few minutes.

She explained her design concept, starting with a female perspective on cosmetics packaging. But then she realized she couldn't speak for all women, so she switched gears and looked at it from a business angle, reworking her draft.

Bianca, on the other hand, was struggling big time. After some prodding from the organizers, she finally showed her whiteboard.

Her design concept was super basic; she just thought some colors looked nice.

With this video out, everyone got the picture. How could someone snag first place with such a lame take on color?

[Wow, Bianca really played us. She doesn't get design at all.]

[We were all fooled by her.]

[Bianca's the biggest fraud!]

But one piece of evidence wasn't enough. The organizers seemed to have it out for Bianca and quickly dropped other bombshells.

The second piece of evidence was a video of Isabella's trashed home, with everything scattered and her computer totally wrecked.

The third piece was a neighbor's testimony. The neighbor said Bianca did come to Isabella's place and wrecked it, and Isabella only got home after Bianca had already done the damage.

"I was so scared! Bianca was in a wheelchair, going nuts and smashing everything!" said the neighbor, a guy in a dark blue hoodie, clutching his chest as he remembered Bianca's rampage.

"Why didn't you stop her?" a reporter asked.

The neighbor rolled his eyes. "She was in a wheelchair. How was I supposed to know what was wrong with her? What if I hurt her more and she sued me?"

The organizers added a note after the neighbor's interview: [Bianca's designs were uploaded the same night she trashed the place.]

With each new piece of evidence, public opinion swung hard in Isabella's favor.

Almost everyone online was now bashing Bianca, who had become the latest target for internet hate.

Mason, fuming, called John and demanded he get Bianca under control. He warned John that if he couldn't handle it, he'd step in himself.

John hung up, glaring at Bianca. "Why did you lie to me? Damn it, I should've known. You've never studied design, never drawn anything. How could you suddenly come up with such great work?"

Bianca bit her lip, looking pale. She had played the victim online, even sharing her address, and had gained a lot of sympathy.

Now, angry fans were swarming the hospital, demanding answers. If it weren't for John's people holding them back, they would've torn her apart.

"Sorry, John. I didn't see this coming. I know Mason's always hated me, so I wanted to impress him. That's why I stole Isabella's design," Bianca cried, begging for John's forgiveness.

###chapter 68 See You in Court

John glanced at Bianca, who was in tears, and felt his heart soften once more.

"This whole mess has caused a huge scandal. Even my grandpa's pissed at you. I've got the best PR manager on it, but he says you need to apologize to Isabella, ask for her forgiveness, and try to contain the damage." John sat down next to Bianca, gently stroking her hair.

"You want me to apologize to her?" Bianca instinctively resisted.

John's face hardened. "Got a better idea? I'm all ears."

Despite her reluctance, Bianca could sense John's anger and knew she had no other options. She quickly pulled out her phone to call Isabella, but it wouldn't go through.

"Isabella's not picking up. Maybe she blocked me." Bianca looked at John, hoping for help.

John sighed and handed her his phone.

Bianca dialed Isabella's number, but after a few minutes, she put the phone down, both she and John looking disappointed.

"Isabella blocked my number too," John muttered.

"What now?" Bianca asked, looking desperate.

"Try another phone." John called over a bodyguard and used his phone to call Isabella again.

This time, the call finally connected.

Isabella, at home and puzzled by the unfamiliar number, answered, thinking it might be the organizers. Instead, she heard Bianca's voice.

"Isabella, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Can you forgive me?" Bianca pleaded, her voice trembling.

Isabella felt a wave of disgust. Did Bianca think she could manipulate her like she did John?

"I've never met anyone as shameless as you. Forgiving you is up to God. I don't want to hear from you again." Isabella coldly hung up and blocked the number.

Bianca stared at the phone, then looked at John with wide eyes. "John, she hung up on me. She won't forgive me."

"Isabella doesn't even respect me," John fumed, dialing again, but it wouldn't go through.

"Damn it, she blocked this number too!" Furious, John hurled the phone at the wall.

The bodyguard, quick as a cat, dove to catch the phone before it hit the ground.

'Since when did being a bodyguard mean saving phones? Good thing I trained with the men's volleyball team,' he thought, feeling a bit sorry for himself as he pocketed the phone.

"Mr. Williams, maybe Ms. Isabella Taylor isn't accepting the apology because we're not offering enough?" the bodyguard suggested.

John's anger flared. He was used to getting his way and hated the idea of bending to anyone. "What are you saying? As the heir to this family, I have to grovel to her? Who in this city dares to disrespect me?"

The bodyguard was at a loss for words but still nudged John, "Mr. Williams, remember, Ms. Isabella Taylor is tight with Mr. Mason Williams. Think of it as keeping him happy. A little gift wouldn't hurt, right?"

John paused, mulling it over. He glanced at Bianca, then called another bodyguard over and handed his phone to her.

"Whatever it takes-money, jewelry-let her name her price. If it gets her to forgive you, it's worth it." John waved his hand, stood up, and walked out.

Bianca's apology was also John's way of trying to patch things up with Isabella, something he'd never done before.

'Like the bodyguard said, I'm not really apologizing to Isabella. I'm just trying to keep Grandpa from getting pissed,' John reassured himself silently.

This time, Bianca managed to get through to Isabella again.

"Isabella, I know just saying sorry isn't enough. Tell me, what do I need to do?" Bianca cut straight to the point.

Isabella was about to hang up but then had a thought. She smiled and asked, "What are you willing to offer? Or rather, what is John willing to offer?"

Bianca gritted her teeth. "Money, jewelry, whatever you want. Just name it, and we'll make it happen."

Isabella laughed. "The organizers already made me their chief designer. I don't need money. As for jewelry, I don't like that stuff either. What I want is for you to go to jail. Do that, and I'll forgive you."

Bianca's face twisted in anger. "I'm your cousin. Can't you forgive me?"

Isabella chuckled. "You stole from me, trashed me online. Did you think about being my cousin then? When you had your lawyer threaten me, did you think about being my cousin? You're shameless! I've got a lawyer now. See you in court!"

Isabella hung up without hesitation, likely blocking this number too.

"Damn it, she wants me in jail! We've lost any leverage!" Bianca looked at John, panicked.

John stared at her in silence. Maybe he should never have let Bianca apologize. If Mason had been the one asking, Isabella would have agreed. But John knew Mason would never help Bianca.

"I'll get the best lawyer to defend you in court, try to minimize the damage, and keep you out of jail." John sighed, waved his hand, and left the hospital room.

Bianca watched him go, feeling his disappointment. It made her panic, like she was losing her grip on him.

'Pearl, she helped me plan all this. She must have a way to fix it!' Bianca thought, clinging to that hope.

###chapter 69 Angry Pearl

Bianca wanted to get in touch with Pearl, so she gave her a ring. But all she got was a message saying Pearl's phone was off.

"Damn it, Pearl, are you avoiding me too?" Bianca muttered, realizing this was the final nail in her reputation's coffin. She angrily tossed her phone to the ground.

"Fine, Pearl, if you're giving up on me, don't blame me for what happens next." Bianca squinted, looking seriously pissed. She decided to wait for the lawyer and then pin everything on Pearl.

Meanwhile, Pearl had no clue Bianca was plotting against her because her phone was off. Actually, She turned off her phone because Tom had been blowing it up non-stop.

After Tom got hauled to the police station that morning, they didn't take his phone and let him make calls.

Tom first tried Michael, but Michael didn't pick up. He called a bunch of other company bigwigs, hoping someone would help him out, but no one answered.

Starting to freak out, Tom finally called Pearl, hoping her family's influence could bail him out.

"Ms. Brown, I only did this because you told me to. You have to help me," Tom pleaded over the phone.

Seeing the online buzz, Pearl was already panicking. She knew she couldn't admit anything now; otherwise, the Williams Family and Michael would never let her off the hook.

"Mr. Harris, I have no idea what you're talking about. If you keep accusing me, I'll have to get a lawyer," Pearl warned sternly.

Tom was stunned. He shouted into the phone, "Ms. Brown, you can't deny we were at the hotel talking about this last night."

"Are you nuts? I was home all night yesterday, didn't go anywhere! How could I be at the hotel with a creep like you? Looks like I need a lawyer to stop you from defaming me!" Pearl snapped and hung up.

When Tom tried calling back, he couldn't get through. It seemed Pearl had blocked him.

"Pearl, you damn bitch, you won't get away with this!" Tom cursed. In a fit of rage, he immediately spilled everything to the police, knowing they'd inform Michael.

Pearl also got a summons from the police and calls from the organizers, making her both panicked and annoyed, so she turned off her phone.

"What mess have you gotten into now?" Paxton stormed in, furious.

Pearl was freaking out. She thought it was just a small issue, but she didn't expect such a strong reaction from Michael's side.

"Dad, you have to help me. I just wanted to target that bitch Isabella, but why is Michael helping her? Is that bitch Isabella seducing Michael?" Pearl speculated angrily.

Paxton looked disappointed. "I can only help you get a lawyer, but you have to stick to your story that you never met Tom. I'll work on public opinion to make everyone believe Tom is slandering you and just trying to please John by helping Bianca."

Pearl could only nod, but inside, she was seething with hatred for Isabella and Michael.

After Paxton left, Pearl muttered angrily to herself, "It must be that bitch Isabella seducing Michael. Otherwise, Mason couldn't have found out the truth so quickly! Damn you, Isabella, I won't let you off the hook!"

But Pearl and Paxton had no idea things were about to get way more complicated.

Out of nowhere, an "informed source" popped up online, posting an article that exposed Pearl from the Brown Family for using her beef with Isabella to stir up drama around the competition. The post even had a photo of Pearl and Tom having dinner together.

Suddenly, all those people who were trashing Bianca online turned their attention to Pearl's social media.

Meanwhile, John had his team start targeting the Brown Family to help Bianca shift the heat. Soon enough, the Brown Family's company stock started tanking.

Paxton was scrambling to handle the mess. He kept trying to clear Pearl's name online, insisting that she and Tom were just discussing business and were being falsely accused, hoping the Williams Family would get to the bottom of it.

Isabella had no clue about the drama between the two families, and even if she did, she wouldn't care. She had no love for John, Bianca, or Pearl.

Unlike Isabella, Michael knew exactly what was going on and was even pulling the strings behind the scenes. His goal was to make sure these people paid the price.

When Michael got home that night, he found a cheerful Isabella waiting for him with a table full of food.

"I got promoted to a senior executive! I'm gonna be making bank. My salary's gonna be higher than yours as a middle manager, so let me take care of you from now on!" Isabella said, propping her chin on her hand, grinning.

Michael, who was mid-drink, almost choked. He wiped his mouth and smiled at her. "You want to take care of me? That's awesome. What do I need to give in return?"

Isabella opened her mouth but didn't know what to say, her face turning bright red. Michael saw her blushing and stood up with a grin, walking over to her.

"As the woman who's gonna take care of me, I think I need to serve you well." Michael suddenly scooped her up from the chair and headed for the bedroom.

"Wait, I'm not ready! Hold on, I changed my mind!" Isabella, blushing, playfully slapped Michael's chest.

With a smile, Michael kicked open the bedroom door and carried her to the bed.

A woman who really wanted to refuse wouldn't be so gentle; she'd fight back with everything she had.

"Sorry, I don't accept your refusal. Life's pretty sweet right now. Why should I work hard when I've got you to take care of me?" Michael's lips curled into a mischievous smile as he pressed his body against hers and kissed her.

From the bedroom came the sounds of kissing and shoes hitting the floor.

###chapter 70 Annoying Phone Calls

In Isabella's room, clothes were scattered all over, from the doorway to the bed. Isabella and Michael were down to their underwear, hands exploring each other's skin, lips locked in a passionate kiss.

"Your period's over, right?" Michael asked with a grin.

Blushing, Isabella nodded. She was breathless from their kiss. Her chest was rising and falling as she caught her breath. Her full breasts, snug in a black bra, trembled slightly with each breath.

Michael's eyes drifted to the deep cleavage between her breasts. Noticing his gaze, Isabella shyly turned her head, only to feel Michael's lips on her chest.

Michael kissed her breasts, and the moment his lips touched her skin, a jolt of sensation shot through her, making her body tense and her heart skip a beat.

Isabella let out a soft moan as Michael's hands moved behind her, unhooking her bra. Her breasts bounced free, perfectly presented in front of Michael.

"Look at them. They're so lovely. I just want to admire them," Michael said, making Isabella even more shy.

"Stop looking," Isabella mumbled into the pillow, her voice barely a whisper.

Michael smiled, leaned down gently. His tongue lightly traced over one of her nipples, eventually circling the areola.

The tingling sensation made Isabella moan softly. Her hands gripped the sheets tightly. A strange pleasure spread from her breasts to her brain.

"Your breasts are so elastic," Michael said, cupping her other breast and gently kneading it.

Isabella's breasts were like creamy pudding, full of elasticity and smooth to the touch. Under the pleasure, Isabella's nipples began to harden.

Michael's fingers pinched her nipples, gently rubbing them. The slight pain mixed with pleasure sent waves through Isabella's brain.

"Michael, I...I can't take it anymore," Isabella's voice had a hint of pleading.

Michael started kissing down her body, reaching her lower abdomen. His eyes fell on the crotch of her panties, where a small wet spot had formed. Isabella's body had instinctively reacted to their flirting.

Suddenly, Isabella's body trembled as she felt Michael's hand touch her through her panties. Instinctively, she squeezed her legs together, trapping Michael's hand.

Michael smiled, feeling the heat and tension in her body, his fingers tracing the contours of her labia through the fabric.

"I know you're nervous, but if you keep tensing up, it's gonna be tough to move forward," Michael joked.

Isabella pulled the blanket over her face, but her legs gradually relaxed and slowly opened. Under the blanket, Isabella suddenly screamed as Michael roughly pulled off her panties.Now Isabella was completely naked. She instinctively tried to curl up to cover herself, but Michael firmly pressed down her legs.

"Calm down, babe, the next part's important," Michael whispered soothingly in her ear.

Once he felt her body stop resisting and her muscles relax, he slowly spread her legs apart, exposing her completely.

Her neatly trimmed pubic hair pointed like an arrow between her legs. Her moist labia looked like a pink bud wet with morning dew. At the tip of the bud, a small clitoris hid like a pearl.

Michael's fingers gently touched her labia, causing her body to tremble again, followed by a tingling sensation from her lower body. His fingers rubbed back and forth along the slit of her labia.

Isabella let out a soft moan, her body responding to the tingling stimulation. Her clitoris began to swell and enlarge under his touch. As the most sensitive part of her body, it was packed with nerves.

Whenever Michael's fingers gently touched her clitoris, Isabella's body would tremble violently. Breathing heavily, driven by desire, Michael could no longer control himself. He quickly took off his underwear, ready to go all the way.

"I'm going in," Michael said, positioning himself.

Isabella didn't answer, just nodded gently. Just as Michael was about to enter, the phone at the head of the bed suddenly rang.

Michael felt a surge of annoyance; he picked up the phone and hung up directly. As he was about to continue, the phone rang again.

This time, Michael answered, his tone full of irritation. "Oh no, do you really have to call me right now?"

On the other end was Kenna. "Who do you think you're talking to? Aren't you supposed to bring your wife to see me? When can I expect a grandson?"

Michael took a deep breath and looked at Isabella, who had curled back up.

"If you hadn't called, maybe you'd be holding your grandson next year," he said into the phone.

"What do you mean by that? Wait, are you two..." Kenna seemed to catch on.

"Sorry for interrupting. Carry on," Kenna quickly said.

Michael took a deep breath and turned off his phone. He looked at Isabella, who had already covered herself with the blanket, and asked, "Can we continue?"

Blushing, Isabella didn't know how to respond. Although she had been ready, the sudden phone call had shattered all her courage.

###chapter 71  BBQ Party

Isabella was curled up in the corner with a blanket, her face so red it looked like she might burst. Just one step away, and she'd be all Michael's.

Michael was perched on the edge of the bed, a cigarette hanging from his lips, unlit because Isabella hated the smell.

He was feeling pretty frustrated. He glanced down at the bulge in his underwear, took a deep breath, and tried to calm himself down. Slowly, the bulge went away.

Right then, Isabella's phone rang. She picked it up and saw it was Amelia calling.

"Hey, Amelia, what's up?" Isabella answered.

Amelia's voice was cheerful. "I just realized we finally cleared up that misunderstanding and even beat Bianca. Plus, you got the job! We should totally celebrate."

Isabella agreed and looked over at Michael.

"Amelia wants to celebrate. You in?" she asked him.

Michael remembered what Benjamin had said about winning over Isabella's friends.

"Sure, I'm down," he nodded.

Isabella quickly told Amelia the good news.

"Awesome, see you tomorrow. Oh, and ask Michael to bring Benjamin too," Amelia added, catching Isabella off guard.

Isabella's face showed her surprise. "Why do you want Benjamin there? You into him or something?"

Amelia sounded a bit flustered. "No, no, it's not like that. I just heard he's a great doctor, and I want to ask him about my mom's illness."

"Is that really all?" Isabella, knowing her friend well, was skeptical.

"Well, if you don't believe me, forget it!" Amelia's voice had a shy tone.

"Okay, I'll ask Michael if Benjamin can come. Stay tuned for good news," Isabella said with a smile, then hung up.

Michael sat back on the bed, pulling Isabella close. "I heard Benjamin's name. You want to invite him too?"

Isabella nodded. "Amelia's mom is sick, and she wants to ask Benjamin about treatment. But I think she might have other reasons. By the way, Benjamin doesn't have a girlfriend, right?"

Michael looked surprised. "Yes, he doesn't. Are you trying to set them up?"

Isabella nodded again. "Amelia's had boyfriends before, but they were all jerks, so she broke up with them. She's been looking for a good guy, and I think Benjamin fits the bill."

Michael nodded and pulled out his phone. "I'll let him know."

He called Benjamin, who sounded exhausted, like he'd just fallen asleep.

"Michael, you're interrupting my sleep. If you don't have a good reason, I'm gonna stab you with a scalpel!" Benjamin grumbled. He'd just finished a surgery and was dead tired, only to be woken up by Michael's call.

Michael could tell Benjamin was annoyed, and it reminded him of Kenna's call earlier. So, he didn't bother being nice.

"I'll text you the time and place later. Clear your schedule for tomorrow. If you don't show up, I'll post your nude photos online for everyone to see your butt!" Michael snapped and hung up.

Benjamin lay there, staring at his phone. "What the hell is Michael up to now?"

After grumbling to himself, he went back to sleep.

The next day, Benjamin showed up outside Michael's new villa.

"Outdoor barbecue, huh? Hope they don't make me grill," Benjamin muttered, taking off his sunglasses and heading towards the villa.

Michael had picked the new villa for the get-together. It had a big yard with a great view, perfect for a barbecue where everyone could eat, chat, and enjoy the vibe.

"Morning, Isabella. Morning, Michael. Morning... Ms. Martinez," Benjamin greeted. He was surprised to see Amelia.

"Perfect timing. You and Amelia can handle the grilling while Michael and I go grab some beer. Barbecue needs beer!" Isabella said, clapping her hands and dragging Michael out of the villa.

As Michael walked past Benjamin, he gave him a wink.

Benjamin sighed internally. 'Damn it, Michael. Leaving me alone with Amelia? Guess I'll have to wing it.'

After Michael and Isabella left, Benjamin walked over to the grill, trying to think of a good conversation starter.

He thought to himself, 'Maybe I should just talk about grilling? I know a lot about that.' But before he could say anything, Amelia spoke up.

With a slightly flushed face, Amelia leaned in and asked, "Mr. White, my mom's in the hospital. I was hoping you could suggest better treatment options for her?"

She handed him a medical record, and Benjamin blinked, caught off guard, but took it and started reading.

'Wasn't I supposed to talk about barbecue? How did I end up back at work?' Benjamin thought, but since this was his field, he quickly got into a conversation with Amelia.

Meanwhile, Michael and Isabella got into the car, ready to hit the supermarket for some beer.

"Can they hit it off?" Isabella asked Michael.

Michael shrugged, buckling his seatbelt. "Who knows? Benjamin's got a shot. He might not be as handsome or charming as me, but he's still a hit with the ladies."

Isabella rolled her eyes and quipped, "You're so full of yourself."

###chapter 72 Bad Girls

When Michael and Isabella got back from the supermarket, they found Benjamin and Amelia deep in conversation, laughing and having a good time.

"Back when I was in Evernia doing some medical work, I met this local guide. He had this crazy story about rescuing a lion. The lion was like a big, friendly cat, always sticking close to him," Benjamin was saying, sharing his wild tales from Evernia.

Amelia was totally hooked, her eyes wide with interest.

Michael and Isabella walked up behind them, but the two were so engrossed in their chat they didn't even notice.

"So, what happened next?" Amelia asked, leaning in.

Benjamin's face fell a bit. "Well, the next time I went back, I heard the guide had died. The lion bit him."

Amelia's jaw dropped. "Wait, was he hit by the lion he raised?"

Benjamin nodded. "Yeah, apparently, he saw the lion on the grassland and ran towards it, thinking it was his old buddy. Turned out, he was wrong."

Isabella, who had been sipping her beer, choked and sprayed it all over Michael's face when she heard the end of the story. The sudden chaos made Amelia and Benjamin finally notice Michael and Isabella standing there.

Michael just pulled out a handkerchief and started wiping his face, not saying a word.

Isabella, looking mortified, grabbed the handkerchief to help him clean up. "I'm so sorry. Did that really happen? It sounds like a dark joke," she said, turning to Benjamin.

Michael shot Benjamin a cold look. "It is a dark joke. It's one I told him a while back."

Benjamin rubbed the back of his neck, looking sheepish.

Amelia jumped in, "I figured it was a joke, but Mr. White here has a great sense of humor."

Isabella raised an eyebrow, noticing how much Amelia seemed to like Benjamin.

Amelia, blushing a bit, handed Benjamin a beer. "The beer is here. Let's have a toast!"

Everyone grabbed a beer, ready to toast.

Amelia raised her can high. "Cheers! We beat Bianca again!"

After the toast, Benjamin's face grew serious. "Speaking of Bianca, I'm her doctor. Her latest medical reports are weird. Her symptoms don't match uremia."

Amelia rolled her eyes. "I don't buy it. She's probably faking it. She used to fake being sick all the time to mess up Isabella and John's dates. Maybe she thought she'd up her game and fake something serious this time."

Benjamin's brows knitted together. If Bianca was faking it, her health reports would make perfect sense.

"Does John really trust Bianca that much? Hasn't he had her get another check-up?" Benjamin asked, still frowning.

Isabella took a big swig of her beer, wiped her mouth, and slammed the can down on the table. "John is not only a jerk but also a fool! Bianca's been playing him like a fiddle! I told him my kidney didn't match Bianca's, but he always thought I was just trying to stir up trouble between them," she ranted, her anger flaring up again.

Amelia walked over, took Isabella's hand, and tried to calm her down. "Okay, let's not talk about that moron John anymore. If we keep this up, we'll ruin our night."

Benjamin suddenly said, "We're running low on barbecue. Who's up for grabbing more stuff from the fridge?"

"I'll go," Isabella said, getting up from her chair. She and Amelia headed into the villa to fetch more ingredients.

Once they were gone, Benjamin turned to Michael. "You know, most exes who are really over each other act like strangers. But Isabella clearly still cares about John. Doesn't that bother you?" he whispered.

Michael took a sip of his beer, glanced at Benjamin, and said, "Don't forget, Isabella almost died on the operating table because of John. Who can stay indifferent to someone who nearly killed them? If it weren't for our family ties, I wouldn't have let him live this long."

Benjamin nodded. "Good to hear you're thinking straight. I was worried you might get the wrong idea."

Michael rolled his eyes. "Do you think I'm as brainless as John?"

Meanwhile, at the hospital with Bianca, John suddenly sneezed.

"Weird, why do I feel like someone's talking about me?" John muttered, rubbing his nose and looking around.

"What's wrong, John? You okay?" Bianca asked, concerned.

John shook his head and stood up. "I'm fine. Just need to hit the restroom."

As John left the room, Bianca felt a pang of unease. Even though she'd pinned everything on Pearl, she knew this wasn't over.

Sure enough, not long after John left, the door opened again, and in walked Pearl.

"What are you doing here?" Bianca asked, surprised but keeping her cool. With John around, she felt safe.

Pearl sneered as she approached. "You've really screwed me over this time! Thanks to your lies, John's been on our case like a madman!"

Bianca smirked. "So, you're here for payback, huh?"

###chapter 73 Conspiracy

Bianca wasn't scared of Pearl coming after her; honestly, that wasn't even why Pearl showed up today.

"There's this doctor who owes our family some cash, and since he can't pay up, he gave us some info instead. Can you guess what it is?" Pearl leaned in, squinting at Bianca.

Bianca felt a chill run down her spine. "What are you getting at?"

"It's about you faking that kidney disease report with the doctor!" Pearl's words made Bianca's face go pale.

Pearl gave Bianca's leg a light pat, grinning. "If John finds out you've been lying to him, do you think he'll still be into you?"

"What do you want from me? Are you trying to blackmail me?" Bianca clenched her fists, glaring at Pearl.

Pearl shook her head, still smiling. "What do you have that I could use? Sure, John listens to you, but you have no say in the Williams Family's business. I need you to do something else-keep an eye on Isabella for me."

Bianca frowned. "Can't you do that yourself? Why drag me into it?"

A flash of bitterness crossed Pearl's face. "Thanks to your betrayal, I'm under house arrest. My dad's got me locked up and warned all my people to stay away. I'm on my own now."

Bianca smirked. "So that's how it is. But for the record, I never betrayed you. If you hadn't messed with my plan last minute, things wouldn't have gone south."

Pearl's fists tightened but then relaxed.

"Pointing fingers won't help us now. Do you want to get back at Isabella? From what I've heard, Mason wants John to keep chasing her." Pearl's words reignited Bianca's jealousy.

"I'll tell you where she is, but what's your plan?" Bianca asked, curious.

Pearl whispered her plan, and Bianca's eyes widened.

"That's twisted! You're basically destroying Isabella!" Bianca looked at Pearl, a hint of fear in her eyes.

Pearl sneered. "Compared to your plan to let her die on the operating table, I'm being merciful."

Bianca nodded. "I'll tell you where Isabella is. Just make sure you follow through this time."

"I will!" A cruel glint flashed in Pearl's eyes as she quickly left Bianca's hospital room.

Meanwhile, at the villa, Isabella had no clue a plot against her was brewing. They were drinking and having a barbecue, and the vibe was super chill.

"It's getting late. I'm stuffed," Isabella said, patting her stomach full of barbecue and beer.

Benjamin's grilling skills were top-notch, just like his medical skills. Amelia had eaten and drunk the most and was now passed out in Isabella's arms.

Out of the four of them, Amelia had the worst alcohol tolerance. Isabella was a bit better off but still couldn't stand straight.

Michael helped Isabella stumble towards the villa. Before heading in, he called out, "Benjamin, can you get Amelia to her room?"

Benjamin sighed, looking at the passed-out Amelia. He scooped her up and carried her inside.

"You're a real weight. Good thing I've been hitting the gym," Benjamin panted as he laid her on the bed.

After setting her down, he sat on the edge, wiping the sweat off his forehead.

Just as he was about to leave, Amelia grabbed his shirt. She woke up, eyes half-open, clutching his clothes tightly.

"You're awake? Need something?" Benjamin bent down to check on her.

Out of nowhere, Amelia wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him down. Their lips met, and Benjamin's eyes went wide, his body freezing up.

"Cutie!" Amelia kissed him fiercely.

Benjamin touched his lips, feeling like he'd just been ambushed. He suddenly felt flustered. He was great at giving Michael advice on wooing Isabella, but he'd never actually tried any of it himself.

"Ms. Martinez, if you don't need anything else, I'll go," Benjamin stammered, trying to get up. But Amelia sat up and pushed him back down.

"Don't go; it's been ages since I've had a boyfriend. How could I let a handsome guy like you slip away?" Amelia grinned, a bit tipsy.

Her skin was flushed from the alcohol, and her body temperature was rising.

Benjamin's throat felt dry, unsure if it was from the alcohol or something else.

"Ms. Martinez, we can't do this. We've only met twice," Benjamin awkwardly tried to push her away, but she bit his hand.

His heart skipped a beat, feeling the softness of her lips and the warmth of her tongue.

"Ms. Martinez, it's hard to control myself when you do that," Benjamin gasped, a spark of desire in his eyes.

Amelia's eyes were seductive as she sucked on his finger, slowly letting it out, a strand of saliva connecting her lips to his fingertip. 

When the strand broke, so did Benjamin's last bit of self-control. He rolled over, pinning her beneath him, kissing her passionately. Amelia responded, their lips moving together, tongues entwining. 

They rolled on the bed, shoes hitting the floor, clothes gradually coming off. In the quiet room, only the sound of their heavy breathing and occasional soft sighs filled the space.

Meanwhile, in another room of the villa, Michael and Isabella were also lost in each other. They'd turned off their phones, sure that this time, nobody would interrupt them.

"We can finally finish what we started," Michael breathed heavily, nibbling on Isabella's earlobe.

Isabella nodded, the alcohol having washed away her shyness. She was ready.

###chapter 74 Passion in Two Rooms

Isabella cracked her eyes open, quietly watching Michael in front of her. His strong body looked like an ancient sculpture, radiating beauty and art.

Isabella's hands gripped the sheets nervously, her legs held by Michael, spread apart, exposing her completely to him.

Michael undressed, his erection standing firm, already pressing against Isabella's entrance.

"I'm coming in," Michael growled, his thick tip pushing into her, gradually stretching her, then sliding inside.

Isabella's back arched immediately, the intense pain making her feel like she was being torn apart. As Michael pulled back, drops of blood trickled down her labia.

Michael smelled the blood and looked down, seeing the stains. He froze for a moment.

He thought Isabella had been with John for eight years and assumed they had done everything, but he never expected she had never had sex with John. He was actually her first.

Michael wasn't obsessed with virginity, but knowing he was her first touched something deep inside him.

"Baby, does it still hurt?" Michael bent down, gently asking in her ear.

Isabella closed her eyes, her face showing a hint of pain, and nodded slightly.

"It's a little painful, but I can bear it," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

"I'll be gentle." Michael bent down, his hips moving slowly, like a scene in slow motion.

Isabella grabbed her legs, spreading them wider to ease the pain and welcome him better. With Michael's gentle movements, Isabella gradually adapted to the pain.

The blood from her broken hymen stained the sheets. Michael's body got some bloodstains, but he didn't show any disgust, his gaze still gentle.

"Does it still hurt?" Michael asked again.

This time, Isabella shook her head. "You can try to speed up a bit."

Concerned, Michael carefully spread her legs to check some bruising on her inner thighs. He put his arm near her mouth, and Isabella looked at him, confused.

"If it still hurts, you can bite my hand. I don't want you to hurt yourself." Michael smiled gently.

A tear rolled down Isabella's cheek; she felt the tenderness and love in that moment.

"No, I really don't feel pain anymore." Isabella smiled.

"Then I'll continue," Michael said, moving his hips again.

As the thrusting quickened inside her, Michael felt Isabella's body responding with a swift release of fluids. With the natural lubrication, Isabella's tense expression softened, her face no longer showing discomfort, and a pleasant hum escaped her nose.

Michael could tell Isabella was starting to enjoy herself.

Some people might throw around dirty talk to spice things up, but Michael wasn't about that. He respected Isabella too much to make her feel like he was some sleazy guy, especially their first time.

He kept it clean, leaning down with his hands on either side of her. Isabella's legs were pressed against her chest, letting Michael lower his head and kiss her deeply. Their lips met, and the kiss only fueled their desire.

As things heated up, their pace quickened, and Isabella instinctively lifted her hips, letting Michael go deeper.

When the kiss broke, Isabella finally let out a moan. Just a simple sound, but it drove Michael wild. He picked up the pace, thrusting into her harder. Their bodies were slick with sweat, and fluids dripped down, soaking the sheets.

Meanwhile, in another room of the villa, a different scene was playing out.

Benjamin lay naked on the bed while Amelia straddled him. His penis was deep inside her, and she moved up and down, taking him in and out.

"This feels amazing! It's been so long!" Benjamin gasped, moaning.

Amelia's moans were loud, her sweat dripping from the effort, the pleasure clouding her mind.

"Are you just gonna lie there and watch? Do something!" Amelia moaned.

Benjamin looked confused. "What should I do?"

"Seriously? Aren't guys supposed to know this stuff? Don't just lie there like a log; I'll treat you like a sex toy." Amelia grabbed his hand and placed it on her breasts.

Benjamin finally got the hint, squeezing her breasts firmly.

Amelia screamed again, her breasts changing shape under his hands, the intense stimulation flooding her brain with pleasure.

"So good, it's been so long since I felt this good. I'm gonna climax!" Amelia screamed, her body trembling violently.

Benjamin felt a hot stream wash over his penis, her vagina writhing around him.

"So good." Benjamin closed his eyes, savoring the moment.

Three hours later, Benjamin got dressed and opened the door, feeling completely spent.

###chapter 75 Kidnapped Isabella

Benjamin stumbled out of the room, wiping sweat off his forehead.

"How thirsty is she for men? My back's killing me," he gasped, half-complaining.

Just then, the door across the hall swung open, and Michael stepped out.

Unlike Benjamin, Michael looked composed, no sweat in sight, but his shirt was unbuttoned at the top, revealing a chest covered in hickeys.

Michael raised an eyebrow at Benjamin. "What were you doing in Amelia's room? Did you two..."

Before he could finish, Benjamin cut him off, "Don't get the wrong idea; nothing happened."

Michael smirked, eyeing Benjamin's shaky legs and the hickeys all over him. "Oh really? These marks say otherwise. Should I call the cops for you?"

Michael pretended to pull out his phone, and Benjamin quickly stopped him.

"Wait, Michael, okay, fine, I did sleep with Amelia," Benjamin whispered.

Michael grinned, throwing an arm around Benjamin's shoulder. "Since you and Amelia got close, treat her right. Don't mess things up. If Isabella ends up hating me because of you, you'll regret it."

Michael's smile was friendly, but his eyes had a warning.

Benjamin gulped and nodded earnestly. "I'll do my best to make her happy!"

Satisfied, Michael let him go.

"By the way, I'm thinking of giving Isabella a diamond ring soon. Should I plan something special?" Michael asked, rubbing his chin.

Benjamin nodded. "Absolutely. Every girl loves a romantic proposal, even if you're already married. It still needs to be special."

"What kind of ceremony should I have?" Michael asked.

After a moment's thought, Benjamin suggested, "How about taking a yacht out to sea and setting off a big fireworks show for Isabella? Picture it: a white moon, romantic fireworks, the sound of the waves. It's like a movie scene, right?" His eyes sparkled with excitement.

Michael nodded. "That sounds perfect."

"Alright, I gotta head to the hospital now. Need to check on Bianca's illness. If she's faking it, I'll expose her. Consider it a wedding gift for you and Isabella," Benjamin said with a shrug, heading towards the mansion's gate.

Michael didn't pay him much mind, already pulling out his phone to arrange the fireworks and yacht.

Isabella had no clue about Michael's surprise. When she woke up, Amelia was just getting up too.

Isabella noticed something was off with Amelia. "Amelia, what's wrong? You don't seem happy," she asked, concerned.

Amelia looked a bit uneasy. She forced a smile and said, "I just drank too much last night. Feeling a bit off. I need to go see my mom."

With that, Amelia grabbed her handbag and quickly left the mansion.

"Why is Amelia acting so weird?" Isabella muttered, scratching her head. She had a feeling Amelia was hiding something.

As Amelia left the mansion and got into her car, she felt a wave of anxiety. 'What the hell did I do today?'

She thought about her drunken hookup with Benjamin. She didn't love him; they'd only met a few times. But being drunk and lonely had led to some wild decisions.

Amelia needed to find a place to clear her head.

Back at the mansion, Isabella stayed put. Michael cooked dinner for her, and they had a sweet night together.

Since not many people knew about Michael's mansion, Bianca, with John's help, couldn't find anything. She only knew Isabella hadn't been home all day.

But the next day, Isabella had to report to her new job, giving Bianca an opening.

Bianca tipped off Pearl about Isabella's whereabouts.

After hanging up, Bianca's eyes gleamed with resentment. "If Pearl's plan works, Mason will never let Isabella marry John again!"

Isabella arrived at her new company for orientation, which turned out to be Michael's company. Since her office wasn't ready yet, she had the next two days off. After filling out some paperwork, she left.

Driving home, Isabella noticed a car tailing her. At first, she thought it was just a coincidence. But after a few turns, the car was still there, making her uneasy.

She forced herself to stay calm. "I can't panic now. I need to get to a busy area; it'll be safer."

But as she turned a corner, another car came out of nowhere and rammed into her, forcing her to stop. Isabella quickly locked her doors and windows, dialing 911.

Four masked men got out of the cars and approached her with a window breaker. Isabella gave her location to the emergency operator, but the next moment, her window shattered. The men tried to grab her phone.

She quickly pressed the emergency button on her phone before it was snatched and smashed.

The men dragged her out of the car, trying to pull her into theirs.

Thinking fast, Isabella took off her smartwatch and hid it in her hand. Pretending to resist, she lunged at one of the men, slipping the watch into his shirt pocket.

Meanwhile, Michael was in his office when his phone buzzed. Seeing the message, he bolted out of the office.

###chapter 76 Similar Scenes

Isabella's phone had emergency contact permissions. All she had to do was hit the dial key five times, and it would send a distress signal to the closest contact.

Originally, Amelia was her emergency contact. But when Michael found out, he insisted Isabella change it to him.

So, when Michael got Isabella's distress signal, he bolted out of his office and rallied his team.

"Track Isabella's phone right now and find out where she is!" Michael barked, his eyes blazing with fury.

Ten minutes later, Michael arrived at the scene of Isabella's car accident. All he found was a wrecked car and pieces of a broken phone scattered around.

Jerry rushed over to Michael. "Mr. Williams, we just got word from the police. Twenty minutes ago, Mrs. Williams called them, saying she was being followed. The operator heard a crash and her screaming."

Michael's fists clenched. "Keep searching. I need to know where Isabella is."

Jerry nodded and took off. Michael sat on the curb, trying to steady his breathing and calm down.

He called John, who was at the hospital with Bianca. John was confused when he saw Michael's name pop up on his phone.

"Hey, what's going on, Michael?" John answered, but Michael's voice was ice-cold.

"Did you have someone kidnap Isabella?" Michael asked in a low, dangerous tone.

"Is Isabella kidnapped?" John shot up from his chair, shocked.

Michael realized John had no clue about Isabella's kidnapping.

"It wasn't me, Michael. Grandpa even wants me to go after Isabella. Why would I do something like that?" John replied, clearly annoyed.

Michael warned, "It better not be you. If I find out you're trying to take Isabella's kidney, Bianca is done for."

With that, Michael hung up. Bianca noticed John's tense expression and started to worry.

"John, what's wrong?" Bianca asked softly.

John put down the phone, looking grim. "Michael said Isabella was kidnapped. He threatened to kill you if it was me!"

Bianca felt a twisted sense of satisfaction at first, but then her face went pale with fear.

'Damn Pearl, you better not get caught. If you do, I'm finished,' Bianca thought, panic rising.

Bianca had always felt safe under John's protection. But if Michael came after her, she wasn't sure John would defy his family to save her.

Back at the accident scene, Michael was on edge.

'If it's not John and Bianca, then who? Who hates Isabella this much? Or did they take her for ransom?' Michael's mind was racing.

Suddenly, Michael spotted something white under the car wheel. He walked over and picked it up. It was a watch strap.

The strap looked like it had been ripped off, and the watch face was missing.

Michael's eyes narrowed. He recognized it as Isabella's smartwatch.

He quickly searched around the car but only found the strap, not the watch face.

'This is a clue Isabella left for me!' Michael's heart raced. He immediately ordered his team to track the smartwatch's location.

In an abandoned factory on the outskirts, Isabella was dragged out of a car with a hood over her head.

When the hood was yanked off, the bright sunlight made her squint. As her vision cleared, she saw Pearl standing in front of her.

"Pearl, you're committing a crime!" Isabella shouted angrily.

Pearl walked up and slapped her twice, leaving red marks on Isabella's face.

"You didn't just seduce John, you went after his uncle too!" Pearl spat, her eyes blazing with hatred.

Isabella's hair was a mess from the hits, but she smirked. "I don't know what's in your head. Mr. Williams is married and doesn't care about you!"

Pearl's anger flared at Isabella's taunt. She yanked Isabella's hair and screamed, "Do you know the cosmetics company you work for is owned by Mr. Williams? You've already broken off the engagement with John. Why would Mr. Williams help you? It's because you seduced him, isn't it?"

Isabella was stunned to realize Mr. Williams owned the company she worked for.

"Since you're such a shameless whore, let these men take care of you today." Pearl let go of Isabella's hair, her face twisted with resentment as she fiddled with a camera on the ground.

Isabella felt a surge of panic. "You bastard, my husband won't let you get away with this!"

Pearl turned on the camera, aiming it at Isabella, and sneered. "When I spread your sex tape all over the city, let's see if he still loves you."

With a wave of her hand, four men lunged at Isabella, tearing at her clothes.

Isabella screamed and fought back. But then, the sound of a helicopter filled the air.

A rope dropped from the helicopter, and Michael slid down it.

The helicopter's arrival made everyone in the factory freeze.

Michael pulled a gun from his waist and aimed it at the four men near Isabella. With a few shots, they were all dead.

In the end, only Pearl was left standing.

###chapter 77 Isabella Got Injured

Pearl was floored when she saw Michael.

Before she could even utter a word, Michael slapped her hard across the face. Her cheek puffed up, and she even spat out a tooth.

"Michael, what are you doing here? Did Isabella lure you?" Pearl stammered, clutching her face and backing away in fear.

Her words were garbled from the swelling, and Isabella couldn't make out what she was saying.

Michael ignored Pearl and went straight to Isabella, his face full of concern.

"I'm sorry, Isabella. I'm late," he said, pulling her into a tight hug.

"It's okay, I knew you'd come," Isabella replied, tears of relief streaming down her face. No one knew how terrified she had been just moments ago.

Pearl finally caught on that something was off. The way Isabella and Michael interacted wasn't like a fling; it was more like a loving couple.

"No wonder you turned down John's proposal. You're already in love with Michael! You're his secret wife!" Pearl shouted, but her voice was still unclear.

"What is she saying?" Isabella asked, looking at Michael, confused.

Michael couldn't make out Pearl's words either, but he had a pretty good idea.

"Ignore her. Her mouth's swollen. Once it heals, I'll have someone question her," Michael said, gently patting Isabella's back to comfort her.

Pearl lost it completely. She spotted a sharp piece of iron on the ground, grabbed it, and charged at Michael.

"You bastards, go to hell!" she screamed, the iron piece getting dangerously close to Michael's back.

Isabella was the first to notice. She shoved Michael out of the way, taking the hit herself.

The sharp iron pierced her body, and blood soaked her clothes.

"Isabella!" Michael yelled, furious. He rushed over and kicked Pearl hard, sending her flying into the wall, where she passed out.

Isabella looked at her wound, feeling the searing pain and the cold grip of death.

"Michael, I'm so scared," she whispered, collapsing into his arms.

"You'll be fine. I'm getting you to the hospital now!" Michael said, scooping her up and running towards the helicopter outside.

Not long after Michael left, Jerry and his crew walked in.

Jerry surveyed the four bodies on the ground and the unconscious Pearl.

He waved his hand and ordered his men, "Strip the clothes off the bodies, knock out their teeth, crush them into powder, and burn everything in the incinerator. As for Pearl, take her away."

Two of his guys stepped forward, grabbed Pearl, and dragged her into a car before driving off.

Outside the ward, Michael waited anxiously by the operating room. He had contacted Benjamin before boarding the plane. When he brought Isabella to the hospital, Benjamin was already in surgical scrubs, ready to go.

While waiting for Isabella's surgery, Jerry came up to Michael and quietly let him know that Pearl was secured.

Michael's face was ice-cold. "Find out what she planned to do to Isabella, then do the same to her," he said to Jerry.

Jerry nodded and left the hospital.

Not long after Jerry left, the operating room door swung open, and Benjamin wheeled Isabella out.

Michael rushed over to Benjamin. "How is she? Is it serious?"

Benjamin shook his head. Normally, he might've cracked a joke, but he knew how worried Michael was and didn't want to mess around.

Taking off his gloves, Benjamin patted Michael's shoulder. "Don't worry. Thanks to the helicopter, you got her here quickly, and her wounds aren't too severe. She should regain consciousness soon."

Michael finally relaxed a bit. He looked at Isabella lying unconscious on the hospital bed, a pained expression on his face.

Once Isabella was settled in her room, Michael sat by her bedside, keeping a quiet vigil.

As time passed, sunlight streamed through the window, and Isabella slowly opened her eyes.

She looked around, realizing she was in a hospital room. She also noticed her hand was being held. Turning her head, she saw Michael, asleep by her side.

Her movement woke Michael, who quickly looked up at her.

"You're awake! Benjamin! Benjamin, get in here!" Michael shouted.

Benjamin hurried in from his office. Seeing Isabella awake, he sighed in relief. "You scared me. I thought something had gone wrong."

He walked over to Isabella, checked on her, and after confirming she was okay, left the room to give them some privacy.

"I'm sorry for making you worry," Isabella said, holding Michael's hand and giving him a weak smile.

Michael looked at her, silent but determined. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a small gift box, and opened it to reveal a pink diamond ring.

Isabella's eyes widened in surprise.

"Benjamin told me I should plan a romantic proposal and then put the ring on your finger. I was preparing for it, but after what happened today, I don't want to wait any longer. Now feels like the perfect time," Michael said, suddenly dropping to one knee in front of her.

"Ms. Taylor, will you marry me?" he asked, holding the gift box and looking at her with love.

"Yes, I will!" Isabella's pale face lit up with a smile. She extended her hand, tears of joy in her eyes.

Michael smiled as he gently slid the ring onto her finger.

###chapter 78 Interrogation

Isabella stared at the diamond ring on her finger, realizing it was the same one Pearl used to wear. She also figured out why Pearl's hand was in a cast-Michael had broken her finger.

"Do you like the ring? It was my mom's, and only my wife gets to wear it," Michael said, confirming Isabella's suspicions.

Isabella suddenly thought of Pearl and turned to Michael, asking, "What are you going to do about Pearl? Maybe you should just call the cops. You don't want to mess with the Brown family."

Seeing the concern in Isabella's eyes, Michael felt touched. He reached out and gently caressed her face, saying softly, "I already called the police. They came while you were in surgery. They must have found Pearl by now."

Michael wasn't lying. He knew Isabella was a kind person, so he had thought through all the consequences before acting.

Just as Michael finished speaking, there was a knock on the door, and two police officers walked in.

"Hello, Ms. Taylor, we heard you woke up, so we came to see you. Can we talk now?" a female officer asked politely.

Michael frowned. Isabella had just woken up, and he didn't want anyone disturbing her.

Isabella gently squeezed Michael's hand and smiled, nodding.

"It's okay, officer. I'm awake and can answer your questions," Isabella said.

The female officer approached Isabella and asked, "Ms. Taylor, your husband, Michael, said he saw Ms. Brown at the scene, the one who kidnapped you, is that right?"

Isabella nodded. "Pearl has always hated me. She even thought I ruined her engagement. I think she's lost it."

The female officer looked serious and said, "But we didn't find her at the scene."

Isabella paused, glancing at Michael.

Michael feigned innocence and frowned. "Pearl and her four goons attacked me. I managed to take them down, but since Isabella was hurt, I had to get her to the hospital first. I didn't do anything to Pearl and her crew after that. Maybe they got away?"

The female officer gave Michael a long, hard look. She felt he was too calm.

A normal person, even if innocent, would feel nervous when questioned by the police. But Michael was too calm, like he had already anticipated what would happen next.

The male officer walked over with a smile and said to Isabella, "Thanks for your cooperation, Ms. Taylor. We'll let you know if there are any updates on the case."

After he finished speaking, he and the female officer left the room.

"My gut tells me Michael is definitely hiding something," the female officer whispered to her partner.

Her partner chuckled. "I feel the same way. But let's treat this as a normal kidnapping and follow the usual leads. We don't want to get mixed up with these people. Neither Isabella nor Pearl are folks we want to mess with."

The female officer frowned. "Are you saying this case is connected to the Four Families?"

The male officer nodded. "Yeah, they're like four fierce beasts, especially the Williams Family, which is like a tiger. And don't forget Michael's last name."

The female officer's eyes widened, and she was about to blurt out the name of that family, but her partner quickly covered her mouth.

"If that's the case, then Pearl's disappearance makes sense," the male officer whispered in her ear, cautiously looking around.

The female officer nodded, pushed away the male officer's hand, and they walked out of the hospital together.

After the officers left, Isabella turned to Michael.

"Did you take Pearl away?" Isabella asked, worried. If Michael was behind it, she'd have to ask Mason to protect him from Pearl's family.

Michael saw the concern in Isabella's eyes and shook his head. "I was telling the truth. I didn't have time to deal with Pearl. There might have been others at the scene who took her away. Or maybe Pearl is hiding on purpose to frame you for her disappearance."

Isabella rubbed her chin, sensing a conspiracy.

"It could also be the other two families of the Four Families," Isabella said cautiously.

Michael raised an eyebrow, looking puzzled. "What do you mean?"

Isabella glanced at Michael reproachfully and lightly patted his hand.

"You're usually pretty sharp, so why are you acting so clueless now? The four families may seem like friends on the surface, but behind the scenes, they're all scheming against each other, trying to take over. That's exactly how the Brown Family took over my family back then," Isabella said, waving her hand angrily.

Michael found Isabella's angry look somewhat cute and playfully tapped her nose. "So, you think this might be the work of the other three families?"

Isabella tilted her head and speculated, "Everyone knows I'm close to Mason. Someone might have kidnapped Pearl to frame me, hoping to drag Mason into the mess. That way, they could pit the Williams Family against the Brown Family."

Michael squinted, finding Isabella's speculation quite reasonable. It gave him a new perspective.

"Mason will probably hear about your injury soon. If Pearl doesn't show up, you should tell Mason your suspicions. He'll know what to do," Michael said, patting Isabella's hand reassuringly.

Isabella nodded and sighed. "Mason will be so upset when he finds out I'm in the hospital again."

Suddenly, while caressing Isabella's hand, Michael said, "Actually, not only Mason, my father also called to ask about your condition."

Isabella was surprised. "Your father knows I'm in the hospital?"

Michael shook his head, a mischievous smile playing on his face. "He asked me when I will give him a grandson."

###chapter 79 The Anxious Bianca

Isabella's kidnapping and Pearl's missing rocked the city like a pair of bombs going off.

Pearl's dad, Paxton, put up a $10 million reward for any info on Pearl, but she seemed to have vanished into thin air.

Meanwhile, reporters were going nuts over the story of Pearl supposedly kidnapping Isabella. Some gutsy ones even tried to get a word with Paxton, but his bodyguards kicked them out.

All they got was one line: "Pearl couldn't be the kidnapper. This is all slander from that bitch Isabella!"

Paxton even had that statement printed in the newspaper.

Mason heard about Isabella being in the hospital and went to see her again.

"Don't worry, Isabella. I'll make sure you get justice!" Mason slammed his cane on the ground, fuming over Isabella's kidnapping. He ordered John to start digging into it.

Isabella leaned back on the hospital bed, looking at the angry Mason, and softly said, "Mason, don't make yourself sick over this. It'll just make me sad. Plus, I have something to tell you."

She glanced at the bodyguards around Mason.

Mason waved his hand, and the bodyguards moved to the door and closed it behind them.

"What do you want to tell me?" Mason asked, getting closer to Isabella.

"I can promise you, Pearl's disappearance has nothing to do with me. This might involve the other two families," Isabella told Mason.

Mason nodded, gently patting Isabella's hand. "Rest up and take it easy. I'll get to the bottom of this. Whoever's behind it, they won't get away with it."

Isabella looked at Mason with deep gratitude.

After chatting for a bit, Mason left Isabella to rest. He walked out of the hospital with John and the bodyguards.

Mason filled John in on Isabella's theory.

"Now that you're in the know, as the family heir, I'm counting on you to figure out who's behind this. If it's the other two families, don't let them off easy!" Mason's eyes gleamed with authority.

The old lion had been quiet for too long. Did the hyenas think he was weak and try to take a bite out of him?

John nodded seriously. Dealing with the four great families required caution. This was also a test from Mason.

When Mason got home, he found Paxton waiting for him.

"What are you doing here?" Mason said coldly, not hiding his disdain for Paxton.

Whether Pearl was missing or not, the fact that she kidnapped Isabella was set in stone.

Paxton took a deep breath and bowed to Mason. "Mason, I admit I failed to keep Pearl in line, but she's still my daughter. If this has anything to do with Isabella, please have her return Pearl."

Mason furrowed his brows and slammed his cane on the ground. "Are you out of your mind? How's she gonna pull this off with her family's power on the decline?"

Paxton looked at Mason calmly, unfazed. "Even if Isabella didn't do it, what about her husband? That guy who never shows up-I've heard he's pretty formidable. Even you haven't figured out who he is."

Mason fell silent for a moment. Paxton had a point. Even the four major families hadn't uncovered Michael's identity, which meant he was no joke.

Mason sighed. "Paxton, you should know this isn't as simple as it looks. Until you have proof, don't jump to conclusions. No matter what, I won't let you harm Isabella."

"Then stay out of my investigation." Paxton shot Mason a cold look before turning to leave.

Mason narrowed his eyes and said to Charles behind him, "Get a few more bodyguards for Isabella."

Charles nodded and went to make the arrangements.

At the hospital, John filled Bianca in on Pearl's disappearance.

"Grandpa wants me to find out if another family is behind this, trying to stir up trouble between us. Damn it, who the hell kidnapped Pearl?" John said, frowning.

Bianca looked uneasy. She gently patted John's hand and smiled. "In detective novels, if something happened, there will be traces left behind. I believe you'll find the truth."

John nodded and ruffled Bianca's hair. "I came here today to let you know that I'll be busy looking into this, so I might not be able to visit for a while."

Bianca bit her lip and said, "But I'll feel really insecure without you around. Can you get me a few more bodyguards?"

John looked at Bianca in surprise. "Didn't I already assign two bodyguards to you? Why do you need more?"

'It's all because of what Michael said! If Pearl gets caught and spills that I leaked Isabella's location, he'll come after me!' Bianca thought, panicking.

Bianca forced a bitter smile. "It's because of the cosmetics incident last time. I faced too much online hate. A few days ago, my friend helped me with a package and found a razor blade inside. I'm worried those crazy people will come after me, so I want you to get me a few more bodyguards."

John nodded; her reason made sense. "Alright, I'll assign four more bodyguards to you, making it six in total."

"Great, thank you, John," Bianca said with a smile.

After John left the room, Bianca's smile turned into a scowl.

'Damn you, Pearl, you idiot. I never should have trusted you again! Damn it, she won't rat me out, will she?' Bianca thought anxiously.

###chapter 80 Pearl Has Been Found

Bianca had been freaking out that Pearl might get caught and rat her out, making her so anxious she hadn't slept well for days.

When Bianca finally dozed off, she had another nightmare.

In the nightmare, Pearl, covered in blood, was crawling towards Bianca. Her body was twisted like a zombie thrown into a blender, her eyes wide open and mouth agape.

"Bianca, help me! We're in this together! Are you really gonna sit there and watch me get tortured by them?" Pearl reached out to grab Bianca's ankle, but Bianca kicked her away.

Bianca backed away in terror, desperately trying to escape. But the short corridor seemed to stretch out endlessly, and she couldn't shake off Pearl.

"You bitch, you told me where Isabella was so I could kidnap her, but then you abandoned me! Why didn't you save me? Why?" Pearl screamed, her body twisted as she crawled towards Bianca.

"Stay away from me! You told me you could take down Isabella, I trusted you so much, but you failed! You're the liar. Stay away!" Bianca screamed, tears streaming down her face.

Just as Pearl's hand was about to grab Bianca, a huge axe from the sky ruthlessly chopped down on Pearl's neck, and Pearl's head rolled to Bianca's feet.

Blood splattered on Bianca's face, leaving her petrified. Pearl's head detached from her neck, but she was still moving her mouth.

Bianca could read Pearl's lips; she was asking Bianca why she didn't come looking for her.

Bianca looked up dazedly to see a masked man standing before her, the mask devoid of features except for a black mouth.

"I warned you, if you hurt Isabella, I'll kill you. Looks like you didn't listen." A chilling laugh escaped the man's lips, like the cry of a night owl.

He raised an axe high above Bianca, the blade still stained with Pearl's blood, gleaming ominously as it was about to come down on her head.

"No, don't come any closer! I'm John's fiancée. We're family. Uncle, don't kill me, please," Bianca screamed, trying to crawl back, but she felt a sharp pain in her ankle.

She looked down to see Pearl's severed head, bloodied and grotesque, biting into her ankle.

"Bianca, come to hell with me!" Pearl grinned with blood oozing out, towards Bianca.

The giant axe above Bianca's head came down, and she screamed, sitting up in bed.

The bodyguards outside heard Bianca's scream and rushed in, only to find everything in order and looked at Bianca in surprise.

"Ms. Taylor, are you okay?" one bodyguard asked.

Bianca shook her head. "I'm fine, just had a nightmare."

The bodyguards sighed in relief, searched the ward carefully, and left when they confirmed there was no danger.

After the bodyguards left, Bianca wiped the cold sweat from her forehead. She felt dampness on her back and realized she was drenched in sweat from the nightmare.

"When will this nightmare with Pearl ever end? This waiting game is killing me," Bianca muttered, clutching her hair, her eyes filled with deep fear.

Thanks to the nightmares, Bianca had been a wreck these past few days. After another bad dream today, she decided to give up on sleep altogether. She grabbed her phone and started scrolling through the latest news.

It had been almost a month since Pearl went missing, and there was still no word on her whereabouts.

Bianca felt like she was going to lose it if she didn't hear something about Pearl soon.

Suddenly, the ward door swung open. John walked in, looking completely wiped out.

"John, what's up? You look exhausted. Come lie down for a bit," Bianca said, tidying up her bed.

Without a second thought, John lay down next to Bianca and hugged her.

With a long sigh, he said, "They found Pearl."

Startled, Bianca asked anxiously, "Really? Where is she? How is she?"

John looked at Bianca, surprised. "Why do you care so much about Pearl?"

Feeling embarrassed, Bianca shook her head. "I'm not worried about her. I'm worried about Isabella. There are rumors online that Isabella was out for revenge on Pearl, so I wanted to know how Pearl is doing."

John didn't doubt Bianca's words and sighed, "Pearl's been found, but she's in a really bad way. I won't show you the photos; they'll give you nightmares."

"Then tell me what happened. I can't stand being in the dark. It will keep me up all night," Bianca said, shaking John's arm to urge him.

John sighed again. After a moment of silence, he said, "Pearl's eyes were gouged out. She was made deaf. Her nose and tongue were cut off. Her limbs were severed, and her body is covered in whip and burn marks. Her vagina and anus suffered severe tears. She's gone mad now; if anyone touches her, she thrashes around like a lunatic."

Bianca's face turned ghostly pale. Just from John's description, she could imagine the horrific torture Pearl had endured.

John was right; he couldn't possibly show Bianca Pearl's current photos. She would definitely have nightmares. In fact, the nightmare Bianca had earlier was nothing compared to Pearl's actual condition.

Meanwhile, Mason looked at the photos of Pearl on the table, closed his eyes, waved his hand, and Charles came over to take the photos away.

Charles said seriously, "Mr. Williams, the place where Ms. Brown was found used to be owned by the Taylor Family, but now it belongs to the Brown Family."

Mason closed his eyes and said in a deep voice, "The perpetrator wants everyone to believe the Taylor Family is responsible for such brutal torture. But the actions are so deliberate that it seems like a setup."

###chapter 81 Going Abroad

Pearl's tragic state left everyone in shock, and fingers were pointed at Isabella.

Paxton stood outside the ICU, staring at Pearl through the glass. His face was a mask, but inside, he was boiling with rage.

Pearl lay there, motionless on the hospital bed, her head shaved. With her limbs gone, she was kept alive by IV meds through her scalp.

Paxton shut his eyes, tears slipping down his cheeks. Regret hit him hard. If he hadn't pushed Pearl to go after Michael, maybe she wouldn't be in this mess.

The sound of hurried footsteps echoed down the hospital corridor as one of Paxton's guys rushed over.

"Mr. Brown, the hospital's locked down by the Williams Family's security and the cops. Our guys can't get in," the subordinate said.

Paxton looked at him, his face blank, but his eyes were cold and deadly, making the guy sweat bullets.

"I need an answer. Pearl can't go through this hell for no reason. Someone must be held accountable. I don't care which of the big families it is, they owe me an explanation," Paxton said, ice in his voice.

The subordinate nodded, sweat dripping. "Got it, Mr. Brown."

He quickly left to set things in motion.

Meanwhile, Mason got word that the Brown Family was heading to the hospital and had a run-in with the cops.

The police held them off, but Mason knew Paxton wouldn't stop until he had Isabella.

Leaning on his cane, Mason started pacing the living room.

Charles followed him, asking, "Mr. Williams, should we warn the Browns?"

Mason shook his head. "It's too late. Paxton's lost it. Get Isabella out of the hospital and bring her to me. I'll keep her safe."

Charles nodded and went to make the arrangements.

Mason quickly set up a security detail from the family's company to escort a car to the hospital.

The Brown's men outside the hospital saw the Williams' move and tipped off Paxton.

"I don't care what it takes, I want to see Isabella today," Paxton said coldly into his phone.

Outside the hospital, a frail figure in a hospital gown was surrounded by bodyguards and hustled into the car. The car headed towards the Williams Villa.

As they hit an intersection, the car stopped at a red light. Out of nowhere, a heavy truck came barreling towards them.

"Convoy under attack! Alert! Quick, alert!" a guard in the lead car yelled into the walkie-talkie.

The truck smashed into the convoy, splitting the cars apart.

A bunch of armed guys jumped out of the truck and started fighting with the guards.

Gunshots and screams filled the air as several attackers made a beeline for Isabella's car. The bodyguards fought back, but the attackers were relentless.

Despite the bodyguards' best efforts, the thugs muscled through and yanked open Isabella's car door.

As the door swung open, a foot shot out, nailing one of the attackers in the chest and sending him flying. Then, a figure in a hospital gown stepped out of the car.

The figure pulled off a wig, revealing a man underneath.

"Isabella's not here. We've been duped. Fall back!" one thug shouted, and they scattered in all directions.

Some guards wanted to give chase, but their captain held them back.

About fifteen minutes later, the guard convoy rolled back into the Williams Villa.

Meanwhile, Mason got a call from Paxton.

"Mason, you're a real piece of work. I'll give you that-I fell for your trick this time. But how long can you keep Isabella safe? Pearl needs answers," Paxton said, his voice icy and disrespectful.

Mason replied calmly, "Pearl deserves answers, but does that mean an innocent person has to be held responsible? I've told you, Isabella didn't do it. Don't let yourself be manipulated. Someone's trying to pit our families against each other."

"Then you better find the real culprit, Mason. Because I won't stop," Paxton snapped before hanging up.

After the call, Mason turned to the guard captain. "Are you sure Isabella was gone when you got to the hospital?"

The captain nodded. "When we arrived, Ms. Taylor's room was empty. We asked her doctor and nurses, and they said a man took her. From their description, it sounded like Mr. Michael Williams."

"Michael? How's he involved in this? I didn't give him any orders," Mason said, frowning, a sense of unease creeping in.

Mason immediately tried calling Michael, but got no answer. He then tried Isabella, but her phone was also unreachable.

Feeling anxious, Mason said, "Isn't Isabella friends with Amelia? Get her number."

The guard captain quickly found Amelia's number.

A few minutes later, Mason dialed Amelia.

Amelia was surprised to get Mason's call.

"Mason, are you looking for Isabella? She and her husband went abroad. Didn't she tell you?" Amelia said, puzzled.

"Got it. Thanks for the info," Mason said, hanging up. He figured Isabella's phone was off because she was on a plane. But why couldn't he reach Michael either?

Just then, John walked in. "Grandpa, Michael went abroad today. He said he was going to see his dad, Kenna. He was in such a rush he asked me to tell you."

John plopped down on the sofa, still confused. "Why was he in such a hurry he couldn't call you himself?"

Mason looked at John like he was an idiot. "I guess he was too embarrassed to call me."

###chapter 82 The New Rival

A plane touched down in Seraphim, landing at Sunrise City Airport.

After more than ten hours in the air, Isabella felt like her whole body was stiff. She stretched as she got off the plane, feeling her joints pop.

"Is this where you live? The air is so fresh," Isabella said, spreading her arms and taking a deep breath.

Michael smiled, carried the suitcase over, and hugged Isabella. "Yep, lots of trees around here, so the air's great. Come on, my dad sent someone to pick us up."

Michael suddenly noticed Isabella's hands shaking and stopped, looking at her puzzled.

"Did we bring enough gifts? Will your dad like them?" Isabella asked, looking worried.

Michael chuckled, knowing she was nervous. Ever since they left home, Isabella had been obsessing over what to bring for Kenna. When Michael saw her list, his eyes nearly popped out.

If they bought everything on Isabella's list for Kenna, they'd need a whole other plane to get it all here.

"Don't stress. My dad's super chill. Even if you didn't bring anything, he'd be happy. Remember what I told you? What he really wants is a grandson," Michael whispered to her.

Isabella's face and ears turned bright red. She shot Michael a playful glare and quickly walked towards the airport exit.

Michael grinned and followed her.

As they stepped outside, Isabella looked around and asked, "Where's the person who's supposed to pick us up?"

Michael frowned, scanning the area. He didn't see the familiar driver or car.

Just as he was about to call and check, a red and a blue sports car pulled up.

The cars stopped at the entrance, and a man and a woman got out of each one.

When Michael saw them, his frown deepened.

"Michael, it's been ages!" the woman said, opening her arms for a hug.

Michael stepped back, hiding behind Isabella, and then nudged her forward into the woman's arms.

The woman realized something was off and opened her eyes to see she had hugged the wrong person. A flash of embarrassment and annoyance crossed her face, but then she noticed the ring on Isabella's finger.

Isabella sensed the sudden hostility from the woman. Though confused, she politely introduced herself.

"Hi, I'm Isabella, Michael's new wife," she said, extending her hand.

The woman shook her hand and replied, "Hi, I'm Scarlett Ramirez, Michael's friend. We grew up together. His dad, Kenna, always joked about us getting married. I didn't expect him to come back married after just one trip abroad."

Isabella immediately understood why Scarlett was giving her the cold shoulder. Scarlett thought Isabella had stolen her destined husband.

A smile tugged at Isabella's lips as she wrapped her arm around Michael's. "Michael, why didn't you tell me you had such a good friend here? If I'd known, I would've brought a gift for her too."

Scarlett narrowed her eyes, realizing Isabella wasn't someone to mess with.

Isabella's words seemed to chide Michael for not telling her about Scarlett sooner, but her real intention was to let Scarlett know that she was not a priority in Michael's life.

Michael sighed, sensing the tension between Scarlett and Isabella. He knew Scarlett's feelings for him, but he had always seen her as a sister and never thought of marrying her.

"Let me introduce you. This is Scarlett's brother, Lucas Ramirez," Michael said, pointing to the guy next to Scarlett.

"Hi, Isabella. Before I came, I wondered how beautiful Michael's wife would be. Now that I see you, I have to admit you're even more beautiful than I imagined," Lucas said warmly, extending his hand to Isabella.

Isabella shook hands with Lucas, feeling the sincerity in his smile. Whether he was genuine or not, she decided to keep things friendly.

Scarlett glared fiercely at Lucas. What an idiot! Couldn't he read the situation? He was actually shaking hands with her rival, Isabella!

"It's getting late. Let's head home. Kenna has prepared food for us," Scarlett said, heading towards the sports cars. Then she suddenly stopped as if she had remembered something.

Scarlett turned around apologetically. "I'm really sorry, but we were in such a hurry today that we could only find two sports cars, and they each only have two seats. So, we'll have to split up. I haven't seen Michael in a long time, so Ms. Taylor, I hope you don't mind if I ride with him to catch up?"

Isabella nodded with a smile, inwardly mocking Scarlett's little trick. Did she think this would make her jealous?

Scarlett had just started to smile when Michael shook his head.

"If you want to chat, do it at the dinner table. I hate it when drivers talk while driving; it's distracting and dangerous," Michael said, reaching out to Lucas.

"Give me your car keys. You and Scarlett can ride together, and I'll ride with Isabella," Michael said.

Lucas nodded and immediately handed his car keys to Michael.

Michael led Isabella towards the blue sports car. They put their luggage in the car and got in.

"Scarlett, let's go. I'm starving," Lucas said, trying to pull Scarlett towards the red sports car.

"If you're hungry, go eat shit! Get a cab home, idiot!" Scarlett snapped, glaring at Lucas before pushing him away. She got into the red sports car and drove off, leaving Lucas standing at the airport entrance.

Lucas scratched his head as he watched the red sports car drive away. "Did I do something wrong? Why is she mad at me?"

With no other choice, Lucas took an airport taxi home.

Sitting in the sports car, Isabella looked at Michael beside her and said with a smile, "It seems Scarlett isn't too fond of me."

###chapter 83 Have a Grandson

Michael grinned at Isabella's question. "You're so gorgeous, everyone hates you 'cause you steal their thunder."

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Cut it out. What's really going on with you and Scarlett?"

"Just like she said. I've always been a standout, so she's had a crush on me since we were kids. But I don't feel the same; she's like a sister to me," Michael said nonchalantly. Isabella scrutinized Michael's face, convinced he was telling the truth.

Isabella smiled at Michael. "You handled that well. I'm impressed."

Michael's hand slid onto Isabella's leg. "I can do even better in bed."

Isabella's face turned bright red. She grabbed his hand and put it back on the steering wheel. "I hate it when you're not serious while driving. It's dangerous!"

Michael chuckled and soon they arrived at their destination.

When Isabella stepped out of the car, she was stunned by the luxurious villa in front of her.

"Didn't you say your family wasn't rich? Where does this villa come from?" Isabella asked, eyeing Michael suspiciously.

Michael had his story ready. "The land here is super cheap. My dad has some investments here. He always wanted me to stay and take over his business, but I wanted to make it on my own, so I went abroad."

"I see. Well, staying here wouldn't be so bad. The manor style is pretty nice," Isabella said, looking around the villa curiously.

Once Isabella looked away, Michael's face darkened. He had called Kenna before boarding the plane, asking him to find a cheaper place. And this is what he arranged? A villa?

Their original villa had five floors, and this one had four! Did Kenna think a four-story villa was cheap?

"Michael, you're finally back!" A sturdy old man walked out from the doorway, arms open wide.

Michael opened his arms too, but just as they were about to hug, the old man pushed Michael aside and embraced Isabella instead.

After the hug, the old man looked at Isabella excitedly. "You must be Michael's wife, Isabella. You've been married for a while now, right? Are you pregnant yet?"

Isabella smiled awkwardly and shook her head. The old man looked familiar, but she couldn't place him.

Michael's face darkened. "Father, that was rude. Isabella just got off the plane; she needs to rest."

"You're right. Your room is ready. I'll have the butler show you inside," Kenna quickly said, taking Isabella's hand and leading her into the villa.

Michael sighed and started unloading the luggage from the car himself.

Just as he got inside, Scarlett drove up. Seeing Michael carrying the luggage alone, she seized the opportunity and rushed over to help.

"Michael, let me help you. Isabella is so selfish. How can she not help with the luggage?" Scarlett said, reaching out, only to be refused by Michael.

Michael turned slightly, dodging Scarlett's hand. "No need."

Michael lugged two bags in his hands and had two more tucked under his arms as he made his way to the villa.

Behind him, Scarlett clenched her fists, her face twisted with hatred. She thought bitterly, 'Why is Michael so cold to me now? He wasn't like this before. Damn it, it must be Isabella! She must have turned Michael against me.'

Inside the villa, Isabella sneezed. Kenna immediately asked with concern, "Isabella, are you catching a cold? I have a private doctor. Should I have him check on you?"

Isabella shook her head just as Michael walked in and dropped the luggage on the floor.

Kenna looked at Michael in surprise. "Why didn't you get a servant to help with the luggage?"

Michael was taken aback. "We have servants here?"

"Of course! Do you expect me to clean this huge villa all by myself?" Kenna's expression darkened.

Michael smirked and flopped down on the sofa. "Forget it, it's already done."

Isabella found it amusing and started massaging Michael's shoulders.

Kenna watched the couple with a smile. "You two lovebirds. Why haven't you had kids yet? Michael, is there something wrong with your health?"

Kenna's expression turned serious as he looked at Michael.

Isabella's face immediately turned red.

Michael looked at Kenna, speechless. "Getting pregnant takes time. Can't you be a little more patient?"

Kenna slapped Michael on the back, annoyed. "I'm getting old and just want to see my grandson before I die. Why can't you fulfill my wish?"

Isabella came over to massage Kenna's shoulders. "Dad, you don't look that old. You're not even seventy yet!"

Kenna smirked.

Michael laughed, "That's right. My dad is only sixty-nine this year, still a year away from seventy."

Isabella felt embarrassed.

Michael got up from the couch, took Isabella's hand, and headed upstairs. "Dad, we're going upstairs to rest. Sleeping on the plane was really uncomfortable."

Kenna nodded, watching them go. Then he turned to Scarlett, who had been silent since she arrived.

"Scarlett, where's Lucas? Weren't you two out together?" Kenna asked, confused.

Scarlett had been lost in thought, annoyed by Michael and Isabella's closeness. It wasn't until Kenna called her name twice that she snapped out of it.

"Lucas? He said he was going out. You know how young people are, always fooling around." Just as Scarlett finished speaking, Lucas walked in from outside.

"Uncle Kenna, don't listen to her nonsense. She left me alone..." Lucas felt a murderous intent halfway through his sentence and couldn't finish the rest.

Kenna looked at Lucas in confusion. "Go on, how did Scarlett treat you?"

Lucas saw the anger in Scarlett's eyes and swallowed hard. "Scarlett is so annoying. I wanted to go out, but she kept nagging me to spend more time with Michael and bond with him."

Lucas forced a bitter smile, and only then did Scarlett nod in satisfaction.

"Scarlett means well. Michael and Isabella have gone upstairs to rest. I'm going to check with the chef about dinner." Kenna stood up with a smile.

Scarlett clenched her fists, suddenly feeling the urge to go upstairs.

###chapter 84 I'm Not a Fool

Scarlett made her way up to the second floor and paused outside Michael and Isabella's room.

Just as she was about to knock, she hesitated. She needed a solid reason to disturb them.

Then, she thought she heard a scream from inside. She frowned and pressed her ear against the door.

Isabella's voice came through. "Stop it. Don't touch me there. I haven't showered yet."

"You smell great even without a shower. Remember what we talked about in the car? Don't you want to see how good I am?" Michael's teasing voice followed.

Scarlett then heard playful scuffling and Isabella's laughter from inside.

Scarlett clenched her fists. She had no reason to knock now. If she interrupted Michael, he'd definitely be pissed.

Scarlett stormed downstairs and saw Lucas lounging on the couch, playing with his phone.

She walked up to him and ordered, "Go find Michael and ask him what he wants for dinner."

Lucas shook his head. "Nope, not doing it."

"Are you going against me?" Scarlett frowned, clenching her fist.

Lucas rolled his eyes. "You just came down from upstairs. Why didn't you ask him yourself? Clearly, Michael's doing something that bothers you. What could a married couple be doing? Even an idiot could figure that out."

Scarlett raised her fist angrily. "Aren't you afraid I'll hit you?"

Lucas shrank back but then straightened up, saying defiantly, "If I interrupt Michael and Isabella, Michael will definitely beat me up. His punches really hurt. But I can still handle yours."

Furious, Scarlett swung her fist at Lucas, who quickly dodged.

"I can see it plain as day. You're just jealous that Isabella took Michael away. Michael doesn't like you. He's married now. Why can't you let go? Just because I'm young doesn't mean I'm stupid," Lucas shouted while dodging Scarlett's attacks, covering his head.

"You little brat, I'm going to kill you!" Scarlett's face turned red with anger as she grabbed a cushion from the sofa and threw it at Lucas.

"I'm not fighting with you. I'm outta here." Lucas quickly ran out of the villa, found his blue sports car, and sped out of the estate.

With no one left to vent her anger on, Scarlett sat on the sofa, crossing her arms and fuming.

'If only I could get rid of Isabella. I can't believe that my years with Michael mean less to him than that woman!' Scarlett thought, narrowing her eyes.

Soon, Scarlett came up with a plan. Given the local geography, she could easily get rid of Isabella.

Meanwhile, Isabella was blissfully unaware of the plot against her. She was enjoying a sweet moment with Michael.

Isabella nestled in Michael's arms, her upper body bare, wearing only a pair of shorts.

Michael's hands roamed over Isabella's smooth skin, then slipped into her shorts, caressing her perky buttocks.

Isabella's legs rubbed together restlessly. Her face was flushed, and the tingling sensation in her lower body made her want to spread her legs wide.

Michael smirked at Isabella's shy demeanor, but his smile quickly faded as Isabella reached into his pants and pulled out his penis.

Isabella felt Michael's penis harden in her hand. She stroked it up and down, then moved her fingers to his scrotum, gently fondling his testicles.

Isabella had taken biology classes in school and had a basic understanding of the male anatomy, but this was the first time she was fully exploring it. Even though she had already had sex with Michael once before, she had never touched his genitals with her hands.

Suddenly, Michael's face contorted in pain, and he grabbed Isabella's hand, pulling it away from his penis.

"Hey, Isabella, those two little balls have their place. Don't try to rearrange them, or I might cramp up and need a trip to the hospital," Michael said, rolling his eyes and tapping Isabella on the forehead.

Isabella's face turned a bit red, and she retorted, "Then you shouldn't have messed with my sleep!"

Michael gave Isabella a sharp slap on her butt, making her yelp in pain. A red handprint appeared on her buttock.

"You said you couldn't sleep well in this new room. So I suggested that if you get tired, you'd fall asleep quickly. I'm helping you, and yet you're complaining," Michael said, somewhat exasperated.

Isabella angrily pinched Michael's waist, causing him to grimace in pain.

"I thought you meant doing some exercises like yoga or sit-ups, not this!" Isabella said, her face flushed.

Michael's face broke into a sly grin, reminiscent of the first time he met Isabella. "Isn't this a form of exercise? And my dad has been urging us to give him a grandson. He's even starting to doubt my... capabilities. As my wife, shouldn't you help me prove him wrong?"

Isabella's face turned as red as a tomato. She looked down shyly and whispered, "But we can't just have sex on our first day here, and we haven't even showered. I feel sweaty and probably smell terrible."

"You're right. I don't smell good either. In that case, let's shower together," Michael said, suddenly picking Isabella up and carrying her towards the bathroom.

Isabella struggled in Michael's arms, her legs kicking in the air. "Put me down quickly. This is so embarrassing!"

Michael grinned mischievously. "We're already in bed together. Showering together will only bring us closer! So don't be shy. Let's get cleaned up and then go to sleep."

With that, Michael carried Isabella into the bathroom. Soon, the sound of playful laughter and splashing water could be heard, followed by clothes being tossed out-first the outerwear, then the underwear.

###chapter 85 Passion in the Bathroom

The sound of running water and playful laughter echoed from the bathroom.

Isabella squirmed, trying to stop Michael from undressing her. Under the shower's stream, their clothes quickly got soaked.

"Take them off quick, or you'll catch a cold," Michael said, wrapping his arms around her.

He leaned down to kiss her, one hand caressing her chest while the other started undressing her.

As they kissed, clothes were tossed out of the bathroom one by one.

Their tongues danced together passionately, saliva mixing with the shower water running down their faces.

Michael's hand moved down Isabella's back, and she felt him kneading her butt, making her squirm.

Suddenly, Isabella stiffened as Michael's hand slipped between her lower cheeks and started caressing her.

"Michael, you naughty boy. I can hardly stand it," Isabella gasped, her legs weakening as she leaned against his chest.

"Then lean on me and let me take care of you," Michael smiled, his fingers sliding inside her.

Isabella clung to Michael, feeling his hard-on pressing against her lower abdomen.

His erection felt like a hot iron rod, radiating intense heat.

"Can we not do this in the shower? It feels weird," Isabella said, blushing as she tried to stop Michael, who was already lost in desire.

Isabella suddenly let out a scream as Michael forcefully grabbed her butt and lifted her slightly. Then he positioned himself and entered her.

With the shower's water flowing and their earlier foreplay, Isabella was already plenty lubricated, making Michael's movements smooth and effortless.

"We were gonna do this sooner or later," Michael panted, his eyes full of desire as he looked at her.

Isabella covered her mouth tightly, afraid to make any more noise. She was scared her sounds would attract the attention of the people downstairs.

"Don't worry, the bathroom is soundproof. No one will hear us," Michael reassured her, his hips moving steadily as he continued thrusting inside her.

"Have you done this with other women before? You seem very experienced," Isabella gasped heavily, wrapping her arms around Michael's neck.

"I've watched a lot of adult films! Want me to use everything I've learned?" Michael kissed her on the cheek.

Isabella's face turned red, and she didn't answer, only making nasal sounds instead of moans.

"I'll take your silence as a yes!" Michael said, lifting her shirt and cupping her breasts, kneading them continuously.

Isabella felt waves of pleasure from her sensitive areas, making her feel like she was flying in the clouds.

Suddenly, Isabella let out a gasp as Michael turned her around and lifted her up by her legs.

At that moment, Isabella felt like a capital letter 'M', a position that filled her with a mix of shame and excitement. She clung to Michael's shoulders, panting heavily.

Michael held her legs, lifting and lowering her body in a steady rhythm. Each time she came down, his erection went deep inside her.

Even though Isabella had Michael's shoulders for support, she was still scared of falling. She pressed herself tightly against him, his firm chest and abs giving her a strong sense of security.

"Isabella, I'm gonna come," Michael gasped in her ear.

The next moment, Isabella felt Michael's movements stop abruptly. His erection pulsed, and she felt the hot jets of his release inside her.

Isabella bit her lip tightly, but a scream of pleasure still escaped.

Michael held her close as their mixed fluids dripped onto the bathroom floor.

Isabella breathed heavily, but Michael's breathing remained steady.

Michael lowered her gently and murmured teasingly, "Are you tired? 'Cause I'm not, so can you help me out again?"

Blushing, Isabella nodded. After they finished their shower and came out of the bathroom, they started their second round.

Isabella lay naked on the bed as Michael's erection returned.

"Come on, Isabella. Let's try a different position this time," Michael said.

Isabella looked at Michael in confusion. The next moment, he flipped her onto her side, lay behind her, lifted one of her legs, and entered her again.

"Michael, you jerk, you should let me prepare first," Isabella said, half-annoyed, half-embarrassed, as she lightly slapped his arm.

"Next time, I'll remember," Michael promised, his hips moving rhythmically. Isabella's moans filled the room.

Isabella gripped the bedsheets tightly, the intense pleasure making it hard for her to breathe.

Just as Isabella was getting used to this position, Michael changed it again.

"Isabella, lift your hips," Michael said, holding her waist and positioning her.

Isabella propped herself up on her elbows, feeling Michael thrusting behind her. She moaned with each movement, her breasts swaying with the rhythm.

The room was filled with the sound of their bodies moving together, growing faster and faster. Isabella's moans reached a peak.

"Isabella, I'm coming!" Michael said, gripping her hips tightly as he drove himself deep inside her, releasing his hot seed.

After their exertions, both of them finally felt the fatigue setting in and were able to fall into a deep sleep. When they woke up, it was already time for dinner.

At the dinner table, Kenna looked at the blush on Isabella's face and seemed to guess what they had been doing in the room earlier.

Isabella's face kept getting redder by the minute. She kept her head down, awkwardly eating her food.

Scarlett and Lucas were also at the dinner. Suddenly Scarlett said, "Since Isabella is here, she should enjoy the local traditions. How about we go hunting tomorrow?"

Isabella was taken aback, then looked at Michael, seeking his opinion.

###chapter 86 Hunting

Michael really didn't want to go along with this. He could tell Scarlett had it out for Isabella, and he didn't want them hanging out together.

But before he could say anything, Kenna chimed in.

"I think it's a great idea. You kids should get out and do stuff instead of staring at your phones all day. It's bad for your eyes. What do you think, Isabella?" Kenna asked, turning to her.

"I don't mind. I'm just a bit worried about running into some dangerous animals," Isabella said, not wanting to outright refuse Kenna's suggestion.

Scarlett jumped in, "Don't worry, Isabella. We're going to a legal hunting ground with harmless animals like rabbits, deer, and goats."

"In that case, I'm in," Isabella said, feeling relieved. She figured Scarlett wouldn't try anything crazy with Kenna and Michael around.

But she didn't know just how nasty Scarlett could be.

'Just wait, you won't make it out of the forest alive,' Scarlett thought, even though she was smiling.

The next day, Scarlett took Isabella and Michael to the hunting ground.

Isabella was dressed in sporty clothes with a leather vest, while Michael wore a simple tracksuit. Scarlett didn't bring Lucas this time but brought two of her close friends.

The owner of the hunting ground was a middle-aged, bearded, chubby guy dressed like a cowboy. He greeted everyone warmly.

"Hey there, I'm Austin Roberts. My hunting ground is the best around because you can hunt, have picnics, and feed small animals. We've got koalas, ponies, kangaroos, even bowerbirds and crows," Austin said, eyeing the women. He figured they were the main guests, and Michael was just there to foot the bill.

Michael wasn't too thrilled about this hunting trip. He was already bored with these kinds of activities. Harmless herbivores didn't excite him; only fierce animals like tigers and lions were worth his time.

Suddenly, Isabella noticed they had pandas, which blew her mind. "Austin, you have a panda here? Aren't they only in zoos?" she asked, looking at him.

Michael raised an eyebrow, skeptical. He couldn't believe this place had pandas. Everyone knew pandas were unique to a far-off country called Emberlyn and were super rare.

Austin patted his chest and said earnestly, "Yes, a true panda from Emberlyn. It's incredibly cute."

"Can I see it?" Isabella's eyes lit up.

"Of course, follow me, ladies, and you too, sir," Austin said, leading Isabella and the others to see the pandas.

Michael followed behind, passing one cage after another until they reached the "panda" Austin had mentioned.

"This is the panda you were talking about? It's just a koala painted to look like one!" Isabella exclaimed, pointing at the black-and-white koala in the tree.

The koala lay lazily on a eucalyptus tree, munching on leaves. Its eyes had been painted black, and its fur had been painted white. If it were a bit fatter, it might have actually passed for a panda.

"Well, it does look like a panda, right? You can call it a panda if you like!" Austin laughed heartily, not at all embarrassed.

"This is not funny at all, Austin. When are we going hunting?" Scarlett said impatiently.

Austin waved his hand. "Come with me, I'll take you to choose weapons."

Austin led the group to a warehouse filled with various weapons. There were cold weapons like knives, swords, daggers, and crossbows, while the only firearms were hunting rifles.

"These rifles should be enough for you to enjoy the thrill of hunting," Austin said, handing the rifles to the women.

Michael casually picked up a crossbow hanging on the wall. "I'll use this. It's not much of a challenge to begin with, and using a rifle would just take the fun out of it."

Isabella looked at the rifle in her hand, then at the weapons on the wall, some of which still had traces of blood on them.

"Maybe you all should go hunting without me. I'll wait here. It's a bit too gruesome for me. I think that painted koala is pretty cute, even if it's not a real panda," Isabella said, handing the rifle back to Austin.

Austin shrugged and took the rifle from her. "Alright, Ms. Taylor, I'll get you some food to feed the animals here."

Michael wasn't really interested in hunting. Seeing that Isabella didn't want to participate, he was about to return the crossbow to Austin.

Scarlett stopped him. "Michael, don't give up just yet. Austin said we can have a picnic at the hunting ground. We can hunt some fresh game for a barbecue. Let Isabella wait here."

Austin nodded. "Yes, I released a few young wild boars in the hunting ground today. They make excellent roasted boar. But I suggest you stay within the fenced area. Beyond that is the real wilderness, where large wild animals roam freely."

Michael looked at Isabella, and she smiled and nodded at him.

"I'll wait here and get the grill ready," Isabella said with a smile.

Michael nodded. This time he didn't refuse; he wanted to bring back a young wild boar for the barbecue.

"Austin, make sure Isabella is safe, or I'll tear your hunting ground apart," Michael warned, giving Austin a cold stare.

Austin was frightened by Michael's gaze and shuddered.

"Don't worry, if anyone tries to mess with Ms. Taylor, my rifle will send them straight to God!" Austin reassured, patting his chest.

###chapter 87 Is Michael in danger?

Michael led Scarlett and her two friends into the hunting ground.

Isabella stood quietly outside the cage, eyeing the dyed koala.

"Koalas are Seraphim's animals, right? Seraphim's animals also include kangaroos, but kangaroos have it pretty bad. They end up on dinner tables every year. I've heard they don't taste great," Isabella muttered, leaning on the fence with her chin in her hands, watching the koala snoozing on the tree.

After a bit, Isabella stretched. She was already bored; this koala wasn't nearly as cute as a real panda.

'Compared to seeing news stories about other countries painting crocodiles, dogs, and elephants black and white to pass them off as pandas, this koala looks pretty convincing,' Isabella thought with a wry smile, then wandered over to the other cages.

Isabella walked up to a fence where two kangaroos were hanging out, and their well-developed muscles left her stunned.

'Wow, I've heard kangaroos have no natural enemies. Is it because of their muscles?' Isabella wondered, eyeing the beautifully muscled kangaroos, curious about how Austin managed to feed them.

Just then, Austin strolled over, and Isabella stopped him to ask about the two kangaroos.

"Are you talking about Megatron and Optimus Prime? They're our biggest stars! Every weekend, tons of people come to watch them spar! Trust me, even a boxing champ wouldn't stand a chance against them!" Austin proudly introduced his two kangaroos to Isabella.

Isabella's lips twitched. "Megatron and Optimus Prime, those are some interesting names."

Isabella found Austin to be a pretty funny old guy, so she started chatting with him.

Austin told Isabella about the history and development of the hunting ground, his heroic and great grandfather, and the story of how he once fought a lion on the prairie.

Suddenly, Isabella smelled something burning, like something was on fire.

"Austin, is that your house over there? It looks like it's on fire," Isabella said urgently, pointing to the distance where a plume of thick smoke was rising.

Austin saw the smoke and anxiously covered his head. "Oh no, that's my stable!"

"I'll help you put out the fire!" Isabella offered, but Austin stopped her.

"Ms. Taylor, just stay here and watch the kangaroos fight! If you get hurt, my hunting ground will be in big trouble!" Austin instructed Isabella before grabbing a nearby fire extinguisher and running towards the stable.

Isabella hesitated but decided not to follow. She didn't know how to put out a fire and worried she might just get in Austin's way.

Just then, a bloodied figure came running over. Isabella was startled to see it was one of Scarlett's friends.

"Ms. Taylor, has Scarlett or Mr. Williams come back?" Scarlett's friend, Wren Kelly, asked urgently.

Isabella shook her head.

Wren held her head, screaming in pain. "Oh my god, damn Austin! He didn't check the protective net! There's a tear in it. I found a blood-stained cloth strip and a phone. It looks like a large animal got in."

As Wren spoke, she showed a piece of blue cloth and a phone.

Isabella's face went pale instantly. She recognized the blue cloth strip as Scarlett's clothing, and the phone was Michael's. Both were stained with blood, which meant they were likely in danger.

"Austin went to put out the fire in the stable. What should we do now?" Isabella asked, clearly flustered.

Wren took a deep breath and said calmly, "I've already called the police. They'll be here soon to protect us, but I'm worried that by the time they arrive, Scarlett and Michael may have been taken by the animal. You stay here, I'll go get a hunting rifle!"

Wren's expression was serious as she turned towards the warehouse, but Isabella stopped her. "Wait, I'm coming with you! The more people, the better our chances."

Isabella's expression was determined. She wasn't worried about any potential conspiracy; she was only concerned about Michael's safety.

Wren hesitated but then sighed when she saw Isabella's determination. "Alright, you have a point. I remember Austin has a satellite phone. We can use it in an emergency."

Wren led Isabella to the warehouse, where she prepared hunting rifle bullets, a first aid kit, a compass, and a flashlight for Isabella.

Isabella felt the weight of the backpack on her, but she had no intention of lightening the load. She knew that everything in it could potentially save their lives in a critical moment.

"Alright, everything is ready. Let's go." Wren led Isabella into the hunting ground.

They arrived at a fence that had a large hole, likely made by a big animal like a grizzly bear.

"I'm warning you one last time, this could be dangerous. Are you sure you want to go in?" Wren asked Isabella.

Without hesitation, Isabella slipped through the hole in the fence. Wren followed close behind.

What Isabella didn't notice was that before leaving the fence, Wren placed Michael's phone next to the fence. In the next moment, another woman walked over, took the phone, and disappeared.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the hunting ground, Michael was still tracking the traces of the little boar. Finally, he spotted it and quickly shot his crossbow, hitting its hind leg.

The little boar fell to the ground, squealing in pain.

Michael caught up and grabbed the little boar, then tied it up.

Scarlett walked over, clapping her hands. "Michael, you're amazing! Looks like we'll have roasted boar for dinner tonight."

Michael didn't find it difficult at all. He looked at Scarlett and asked with a frown, "When is your friend coming back? Is she chatting with her boyfriend on my phone?"

Scarlett had two good friends, Wren and Ember. Ember had said she needed to urgently contact her boyfriend but didn't have her phone. Unfortunately, none of the three women had their phones, so Ember had to borrow Michael's.

Just as Michael raised this question, Ember finally rushed back and returned the phone to him.

Michael casually put the phone in his pocket, not noticing the glance Ember exchanged with Scarlett.

###chapter 88 Michael's Fury

Michael decided to call it quits after bagging the wild boar.

"This should be enough for us. If you guys want to keep hunting, go ahead. I'm gonna go find Isabella," Michael said, heading out of the hunting grounds.

"Hold up, Michael! One wild boar? That's it? Let's go for some deer and rabbits too," Scarlett said, trying to keep him from noticing Isabella was missing.

"If you want to keep hunting, be my guest. But I'm out. This is getting boring," Michael said, frowning as he brushed past Scarlett and walked away.

Scarlett watched him leave, her fists clenched tight.

"Are you sure that bitch Isabella went outside the hunting grounds?" Scarlett asked Ember.

Ember nodded. "Wren took her out personally. Don't worry, this forest is huge and crawling with wild beasts. She won't make it out alive."

A cruel glint flashed in Ember's eyes.

Scarlett's plan was to use this hunting trip to lure Isabella deep into the forest. Her friends were in on it too.

Ember set fire to Austin's barn to distract him. Then Wren used a blood-stained cloth and Michael's phone to trick Isabella into thinking Michael was in danger, leading her into the forest.

Everything was going according to Scarlett's plan.

"Good, let's see how a dead woman can compete with me for Michael," Scarlett said with a cold smile.

After leaving the hunting grounds, Michael carried the wild boar and searched for Isabella.

Suddenly, he saw Austin, his face covered in soot. Michael frowned and asked, "What happened to you?"

Austin wiped his face with a towel and said angrily, "My barn caught fire out of nowhere. I'm always careful about fire safety. I even checked the wiring, and everything was fine. It must be one of my competitors trying to burn my horses."

A sense of unease gripped Michael, and he asked urgently, "Where's Isabella?"

Austin pointed toward the kangaroo enclosure. "She should be there, watching Megatron and Optimus Prime fight."

Michael didn't care why the kangaroos had those names. He dropped the wild boar and ran to the enclosure, but Isabella was nowhere to be found.

"Where's Isabella? Didn't I ask you to keep her safe?" Michael's eyes were bloodshot with anger as he glared at Austin.

Austin started to panic too. "I told her not to wander off. Wait here. I'll check the surveillance."

Austin hurried to the surveillance room, and Michael, taking a deep breath, followed him.

But when they got there, they found the surveillance had been tampered with.

"Fuck, am I being targeted?" Austin slumped into his chair, holding his head.

Michael kicked Austin's chair over, sending him crashing to the ground. "If anything happens to Isabella, you're dead meat!"

He pulled out his phone to call for help.

Just then, Wren, covered in blood, came running over. "You need to save Ms. Taylor! She's in trouble."

Hearing Wren's shout, Michael rushed over and grabbed her by the collar. "What happened to her?"

Wren, terrified by Michael's fierce look, trembled as she said, "My gun ran out of bullets, so I went to the warehouse to get more. Ms. Taylor said feeding the animals was boring and wanted to go to the hunting ground with me. While we were hunting, we found a broken fence. Ms. Taylor insisted on exploring outside, and I couldn't stop her, so I went with her. We ran into a wild boar, and it charged at us. We got separated."

Michael's eyes narrowed as he stared silently at Wren.

Wren felt the pressure mounting, causing her to tremble with fear.

"You're lying! Isabella would never have the guts to leave the hunting grounds! If you tell the truth now, I might let you go," Michael's cold voice whispered in Wren's ear.

Wren swallowed hard, her eyes instinctively darting to Scarlett.

Scarlett was also nervous, but she glared at Wren, signaling her to stick to the story.

Wren bit her lip and shook her head. "I'm not lying, I'm telling the truth."

Michael's gaze turned icy. He pulled out his phone and called one of his subordinates. Shortly after, a convoy of vehicles approached. When they stopped, Jerry stepped out of the first car and walked up to Michael.

"Mr. Williams, I've gathered the team, ready to enter the forest to find Mrs. Williams at any time," Jerry said respectfully.

Michael pushed Wren towards Jerry. "In 10 minutes, I want to know the truth out of her. I don't care what methods you use."

Jerry nodded and had two people drag Wren away.

Wren struggled frantically, but the two strong men gave her no chance to break free. "I'm not lying! I'm telling the truth!"

Wren screamed desperately, pleading for Scarlett to help her, but Scarlett was already intimidated by Michael's imposing presence.

Finally, Scarlett bit her lip and decided to plead for Wren. However, as soon as she approached Michael, he pointed the hunting rifle at her.

"You brought these two women here. She lied to me. Are you in on this? If I find out you had anything to do with this, I won't let you off either," Michael's icy tone was like a volcano on the ocean floor, ready to erupt at any moment.

Scarlett was too terrified to speak.

Meanwhile, Isabella was still calling out Michael's name in the forest.

"Michael, where are you?" Isabella used her dagger to push aside the bushes in front of her, stepping deeper into the forest.

As the surroundings grew darker, Isabella suddenly realized that Wren was gone. To make things worse, when she tried to reach Wren with the satellite phone, she found it was broken!

###chapter 89 The Missing Isabella

Isabella stared at the satellite phone in her hand and finally realized something was off. The battery was missing! This rendered the phone completely useless.

A wave of dread washed over her. She thought of Scarlett. If Wren had been brought in by Scarlett to mess with her, it was likely she had tampered with her gear.

Isabella quickly dropped her backpack and checked the hunting rifle in her hand, only to find that all the bullets were blanks except for the one in the chamber. Using these blanks to hunt wild animals would definitely make headlines, and not in a good way.

"Damn Scarlett, does she want me to die out here?" Isabella felt a mix of panic and anger.

If Scarlett really wanted her dead out of jealousy, then Michael would be safe. Scarlett's target was always her.

Isabella immediately checked the rest of her equipment. Luckily, apart from the satellite phone and hunting rifle, the first aid supplies and emergency food were all intact.

But Isabella knew that even with emergency food and medicine, someone with no wilderness survival experience like her wouldn't last long. It would only delay the inevitable.

Suddenly, there was a rustling in the bushes. Isabella gripped her knife, her eyes locked on the moving bushes.

"God, please don't let it be a wild animal," Isabella whispered, her legs shaking with fear.

Maybe God heard her prayer because only a rabbit hopped out of the bushes.

Isabella sighed in relief but knew it was just a stroke of luck. Next time, she might not be so fortunate.

"Stay calm. Think about what to do next! Yes, I need to find my direction!" Isabella took a deep breath, forced herself to calm down, and took out her compass.

Isabella watched as the compass needle swung aimlessly, unable to point to any direction accurately. Frustrated, she angrily threw the compass on the ground.

"Damn Scarlett! She's trying to get me killed out here!" Isabella was furious, realizing even the compass was fake!

Scarlett had prepared too well, which meant they had planned this for a long time. Isabella wondered if Austin was involved too.

At that moment, Austin sneezed in the hunting grounds. He was stuck there, unable to go anywhere, as Michael's people had surrounded the area.

Although there was no evidence linking Austin to Isabella's disappearance, he was still being held.

Feeling dejected, Austin walked to the kangaroo enclosure and opened it.

"Optimus Prime, Megatron, you're free now. I might die here today! I'll release the other animals later! God, if you really exist, please watch over Ms. Taylor. She must not die out there! Damn it! What a cursed fate," Austin muttered as he walked towards the other cages.

The two kangaroos hopped out of the enclosure, glanced at Austin's retreating figure, then looked towards the forest before bounding off into the woods.

Ten minutes later, Scarlett showed up in front of Michael.

Michael glared at her, his eyes cold as ice. "Why did you do it?"

Just moments ago, Jerry had told Michael about Isabella's disappearance. Wren and Ember, unable to withstand Jerry's interrogation, had confessed Scarlett's entire plan.

Scarlett trembled with fear as she looked at the plate in front of her, which held two freshly severed tongues.

"It seems you know whose tongues these are. Your friends lied to me, so I punished them. You know my style! They're still alive for now. But if Isabella turns up dead, they will end up the same way," Michael said in a cold, blood-chilling tone.

Scarlett, filled with fear and anger, glared at Michael and shouted, "I've loved you since we were kids! You didn't give me a chance and instead, you marry Isabella, who came out of nowhere."

Michael grabbed Scarlett by the neck and lifted her up.

"You should be grateful we were friends before. Otherwise, your tongue would be on that plate too," Michael said coldly, throwing Scarlett to the ground.

Without looking at the coughing Scarlett on the floor, Michael walked outside to find Jerry and ask about the search progress.

Jerry, with his head lowered, said in a low voice, "We've found some trampled tracks and are trying to locate her. We haven't found any blood, so Mrs. Williams should still be alive."

Jerry's words carried an implicit warning: "We haven't found Isabella yet. She's safe for now, but that doesn't mean she will be later."

Michael took a deep breath, suppressing his anger and worry. In a hoarse voice, he growled, "Keep sending more people to search!"

Jerry nodded and went to make arrangements.

Meanwhile, in the forest, Isabella was still trying to find her way. She had tried every method she could think of, but it seemed like fate was against her.

The sun, the moon, and the North Star could have been used as navigational markers, but it was a cloudy day. The sky was covered with thick clouds, offering no light at all.

Methods like reading tree rings were also not feasible for Isabella. She couldn't chop down a massive tree, and doing so would attract wild animals with the noise.

'It's completely dark now. I need to find a place to spend the night,' Isabella thought, looking around the forest with frustration.

She had planned to spend the night in a tree, but as she passed a large one, she saw a python hanging from its branches.

Luckily, the python didn't notice Isabella. Although she managed to evade the python, she didn't dare climb any trees after that.

"If I make it through this, I'm definitely signing up for some wilderness survival lessons!" Isabella sighed as she continued to search her backpack, hoping to find something useful.

Suddenly, she caught a strong, foul smell. She turned around in a daze and saw several pairs of green eyes staring at her from the darkness.

###chapter 90 Kangaroos Battle with Wild Boars

When Isabella saw those eyes, her heart skipped a beat. After some moments of peace, she was now facing genuine danger.

The moon peeked through the clouds, casting a sliver of light in front of her.

That's when she saw them: three massive wild boars.

The good news? Wild boars are mostly herbivores.

The bad news? They can eat meat too. And they're super aggressive, ready to charge at anything that ticks them off. Given the size of these three, even a small charge could turn Isabella into a pancake.

A wave of bitterness washed over her. The best way to deal with wild boars? Climb a tree. She didn't care about any snakes that might be up there. However, the trees nearby were tall and smooth, and climbing them would take forever.

The boars had all the time in the world to attack her, but she only had one shot to hide. If one of them hit her, the best-case scenario would be a broken bone.

As the boars closed in, Isabella sighed and gripped her dagger tightly. The best way to scare off wild boars was with a torch, but all she had was an emergency fire starter and no time to make a torch.

"Even if I die, I'm going down like a hero! Bring it on, you beasts!" Isabella shouted, even though fear gripped her heart.

One of the boars lost patience and charged at her.

Isabella held her dagger tight, ready to fight.

Just as the boar was about to hit her, a shadow dropped from above, landing hard on the boar's head, making it skid to a stop, carving a furrow in the ground.

In the moonlight, Isabella was shocked to see her rescuer was a kangaroo. This kangaroo had well-defined muscles and looked oddly familiar.

"Are you Optimus Prime? No, wait, are you Megatron? Sorry, you two look so much alike, I can't tell you apart," Isabella said, almost in tears from excitement.

She had almost been killed by wild boars, but a kangaroo saved her. It sounded ridiculous, but she didn't care. As long as she was saved, it didn't matter if it was by a person or a kangaroo.

Another kangaroo dropped from above, landing on the same wild boar. The two kangaroos started bouncing on the boar like it was a trampoline.

Their powerful legs made the wild boar beneath them howl in pain.

The other two boars decided to help their buddy and charged at the kangaroos.

"Optimus Prime! Megatron, watch out!" Isabella yelled. But her worry was unnecessary.

The kangaroos jumped higher, easily dodging the charging boars.

Then, they simultaneously charged at the other two boars, their powerful legs kicking the boars in the face, knocking their snouts askew.

One of the boars had sharp tusks, but under the kangaroo's attack, its tusks were kicked off.

The boar with the broken tusks had blood flowing from its mouth. It was thoroughly enraged, driven mad by pain and anger.

The wild boar roared and charged at the kangaroo. The kangaroo nimbly leaped onto a tree, using the trunk to spring to another one.

The clever kangaroo kept luring the boar away from Isabella.

There were still two wild boars left. The one that had skidded to a stop slowly got up. Even though wild boars have thick skin, the kangaroo's powerful kicks had done some damage. After being kicked so much, the boar's internal organs were probably messed up.

Isabella hid behind a tree, quietly watching the two wild boars attacking the remaining kangaroo.

The kangaroo moved its mouth, showing no expression, its calm eyes hinting at disdain.

The two wild boars charged at the kangaroo, roaring as they tried to make it pay.

But the kangaroo stayed completely unfazed, standing its ground. This made Isabella start to worry for it.

"Come on, whether you're Megatron or Optimus Prime, just move already!" Isabella shouted from behind the tree.

Just as the two wild boars were about to hit the kangaroo, it finally jumped up, and the two boars crashed into each other like two runaway trains.

Isabella thought she heard the sound of bones shattering.

"This is too brutal!" Isabella muttered, her mouth twitching.

One of the boars slowly got up again. This time, it seemed to have learned its lesson and quickly fled in a different direction, no longer daring to mess with the kangaroo.

The other boar, severely injured, collapsed on the ground and died shortly after.

Isabella waited behind the tree for a bit, making sure it was safe before slowly approaching the wild boar. She gently poked it with a stick to confirm it was dead, then let out a sigh of relief.

Just then, the nearby bushes began to shake, making Isabella nervous again. But in the next moment, another kangaroo jumped out.

"Thank goodness! I can't believe you guys saved me!" Isabella exclaimed excitedly. She rummaged through her backpack and found two energy bars, then placed them in front of the kangaroo.

The kangaroo looked at Isabella, then sniffed the energy bars before taking a bite.

Watching the two kangaroos eat the energy bars, an idea suddenly struck Isabella. Maybe they could lead her out of the forest.

"Optimus Prime, Megatron, can you take me out of here? I'll give you some delicious food as a reward," Isabella said, looking at the kangaroos hopefully.

The two kangaroos tilted their heads, seeming to understand her, then hopped off in a direction.

"Wait for me!" Isabella shouted, chasing after them with her backpack.

The kangaroos hopped quickly, and Isabella struggled to keep up, but she gritted her teeth and kept running, knowing this might be her only chance to escape the forest.

Just as Isabella felt she was about to run out of breath, she saw a light ahead. There were people holding flashlights, seemingly searching for something.

Isabella immediately waved her arms and shouted, "Is anyone there? Help!"

Jerry was leading a search team to find Isabella when he suddenly heard a distant voice. He excitedly waved his flashlight. "Ms. Taylor, we're here to rescue you!"

###chapter 91 Let It Go This Time

Isabella heard Jerry's response and felt a wave of relief wash over her. She sprinted towards him.

When Jerry and his team, flashlights in hand, reached Isabella, she was on the verge of tears.

"Thank God, I'm finally out of this damn forest! I almost got trampled by wild boars," Isabella said, tears welling up.

Jerry quickly fished a tissue out of his pocket and handed it to her.

"Mrs. Williams, Mr. Williams is waiting for you. Maybe you could try to hold on a little longer?" Jerry gently suggested, hinting that she might want to save her tears for when she saw Michael.

Isabella also felt that crying in front of them would be undignified, so she held back her tears and let Jerry lead her to Michael.

Meanwhile, Michael learned through the walkie-talkie that they had found Isabella. He leaped out of his chair in excitement and dashed outside. Scarlett also heard the news of Isabella's return and felt a wave of relief that was quickly replaced by resentment.

When Michael saw Isabella surrounded by the search team, he was overwhelmed with emotion. His usual stern and aloof demeanor was gone as he rushed over and enveloped Isabella in a tight hug.

"Isabella, you have no idea how worried I was when you were missing. Thank goodness you've returned to me in one piece," Michael said, holding her so tightly as if afraid she might vanish again.

Isabella cried, "If you keep hugging me so tightly, I'm going to suffocate!"

Michael quickly loosened his grip. Isabella, gasping for breath and with tears streaming down her face, said excitedly to Michael, "I almost got trampled by wild boars. Three of them, each as big as a tank. It was terrifying! I almost thought I'd never see you again."

Michael then noticed the dirt smudges on Isabella's face, the grass clinging to her clothes, and the scratches on her arms and hands from branches.

Michael felt a pang of heartache, gently wiping the dirt off Isabella's face and removing the leaves from her hair.

"I'm so sorry for what you've been through," Michael said, his heart aching with guilt.

Isabella shook her head. "As long as you're okay, that's all that matters. I thought you were attacked by wild animals in the forest, so I wanted to bring you weapons."

Michael felt even more heartbroken and deeply touched. Isabella, who didn't have much outdoor experience, braved the forest to fetch him gear upon hearing about his injury. Her love ran deep indeed.

"I know, thank you," Michael said, gently touching Isabella's hair. Ignoring the dirt on her face, he planted a firm kiss on her cheek.

Isabella blushed, but her expression quickly changed when she saw Scarlett glaring at her not far away.

"Michael, I was tricked! Wren told me you were attacked by wild animals, so I went deep into the forest. The equipment she gave me, the satellite phone, and the hunting rifle were all broken! If the kangaroos hadn't saved me, I might have died," Isabella said angrily.

Michael's face turned cold. "I know. I've already found out that Scarlett was behind all of this. Whatever you plan to do to them, I've got your back."

Michael's relief at Isabella's safety quickly gave way to a seething anger. If Isabella wanted Scarlett to pay, he'd make sure they disappeared from the world.

Isabella bit her lip, hesitating. She remembered Kenna mentioning Scarlett's connection to their family during dinner. Plus, Scarlett and Michael had been friends since childhood, making it tough for Isabella to decide.

"Let's just call the police and let the law handle it," Isabella sighed, ultimately choosing this approach.

Michael's eyes flickered, and he eventually nodded. He knew that given Isabella's nature, she wouldn't come up with a particularly harsh punishment. Leaving it to the police was one way to handle it.

Knowing Scarlett's family's powerful connections, Michael understood that simply reporting her to the police wouldn't have much impact. Nevertheless, Michael intended to take matters into his own hands as a message to Scarlett's family, so they would know what to do.

Scarlett stood at a distance behind Michael, watching him and Isabella embrace, her fists clenched tightly. The person in Michael's arms should have been her, but she didn't dare approach now.

If Michael hadn't learned the truth from Wren and Ember, Scarlett could have disguised herself as a victim, shifted all the blame onto them, and then expressed concern for Isabella to lower her guard.

But now that Michael knew Scarlett's plan, any act she put on would just make her look like a fool.

'Damn you, Isabella, why didn't you die in the forest? If you had, Michael might have been angry with me at first, but given time, he would have returned to me! I'm the only one who should be Michael's wife!' Scarlett thought, glaring at Isabella with hatred, brewing another crazy plan in her mind.

Just then, someone came rushing over-it was Austin, the owner of the hunting grounds.

"Thank God, Isabella, you're alive! This is great, I won't have to die!" Austin was so excited he was almost in tears.

Michael gave Austin a disapproving glance. He was savoring a sweet moment with Isabella, and Austin's interruption was unwelcome.

Isabella left Michael's embrace and bowed to thank Austin.

Austin was confused by Isabella's actions, and Michael also looked puzzled.

"Ms. Taylor, why are you thanking me? I should be apologizing to you. If I had taken care of you properly, you wouldn't have been in danger," Austin said, looking remorseful.

Isabella shook her head. "Austin, I have to thank you. I encountered three wild boars in the forest. If it weren't for Optimus Prime and Megatron, I would have been trampled to death! They drove the boars away and saved me."

Michael was startled. He suddenly remembered Isabella mentioning earlier that she had encountered wild boars in the forest, but he hadn't realized that it was kangaroos that had saved her.

Austin was stunned for a moment, then exclaimed with joy, "Did my two kangaroos save you? That's amazing! I knew they were the best. Ms. Taylor, do you know where they went?"

###chapter 92 You'll Have to Offer More

Isabella was floored by what Austin said. Those two kangaroos were way faster than her, and she had no clue where they went after they got her out.

"I don't know. They vanished after they got me out of the forest. They were too quick for me to keep up," Isabella said. Just then, she caught sight of two bouncing figures out of the corner of her eye.

Her face lit up with excitement as she pointed and waved. "There they are! Hey, Optimus Prime! Megatron!"

Two strong, muscular kangaroos hopped over to them.

Austin's heart swelled with joy as he ran towards his kangaroos.

"This is incredible! My two darlings, I've missed you so much. You're my heroes!" Austin cried, hugging the two kangaroos tightly.

Austin had thought he wouldn't make it, so he decided to let all the animals in the hunting ground go free. He never imagined that the two kangaroos would end up saving Isabella, and indirectly saving him too!

Isabella quickly told Michael how the kangaroos had rescued her after she ran into wild boars in the jungle.

Michael was amazed. These two kangaroos looked different from any others he'd seen.

"They're even more buff than you," Isabella said, nodding towards the two kangaroos.

Michael rolled his eyes. Why did she have to compare him to kangaroos? Sure, his combat skills were top-notch among humans, but he couldn't match up to a kangaroo.

But Michael could see that Isabella really liked those two kangaroos, and an idea popped into his head.

"You must be starving. Someone just brought me some food, and I hadn't had a chance to eat when I heard you were back. Why don't you eat first?" Michael said, leading Isabella to a temporary resting spot.

Isabella nodded. After a day in the jungle, she was starving. Sure, she could've eaten some energy bars, but they were nothing compared to freshly cooked food.

While Isabella was eating, Michael walked over to Austin.

"Mr. Williams, since Isabella is safe, does that mean I'm safe too?" Austin asked respectfully.

After Michael's men surrounded the hunting ground, Austin gleaned Michael's identity from their conversations. He was the most formidable person in the country, someone who could easily end his life!

Michael looked at Austin with a bit of exasperation. Sure, he could display ruthlessness on occasion, like cutting off someone's tongue, but that didn't mean he was a psycho who derived pleasure from senseless killing.

"Since Isabella is fine, you are safe," Michael said, finally giving Austin some relief.

But Michael's next words made Austin's heart race again.

"Do you want to sell these two kangaroos? How about 2 million dollars?" Michael offered. He could tell that Isabella really liked these two kangaroos, so he wanted to buy them to make her happy.

Austin immediately spread his arms protectively in front of the kangaroos. "No way! I've raised them since they were young. They're like family to me!"

Michael furrowed his brow. Since Austin wasn't willing to sell, he wouldn't push it. He figured he could just bring Isabella to visit them often.

But Austin's next words caught Michael completely off guard.

"These kangaroos are like family to me, so if you want them to leave me, you'll have to offer more!" Austin's final remark nearly made Michael burst out laughing.

Even more amusing was the reaction of the kangaroos. They seemed to understand what Austin had said.

At first, they looked bored. But after hearing Austin mention more money, their eyes widened, and their mouths opened, showing their teeth.

Michael blinked, thinking he saw anger on the kangaroos' faces.

The next moment, the kangaroos jumped up and kicked Austin hard.

Austin let out a scream as he flew through the air in an arc, landing in a nearby fence, creating a small crater in the ground. When he got up, he spat out two mouthfuls of dirt.

"Damn it! I raised you all so darn big!" Austin yelled at the kangaroos, clutching his waist as he slowly got up from the ground.

Michael raised an eyebrow. Normally, a person would suffer internal bleeding or even broken bones from such a strong attack by the kangaroos. Yet, Austin seemed to have only minor injuries.

It looked like Austin had taken a beating from those two kangroos a bunch of times, but hey, his ability to bounce back was pretty darn impressive.

The kangaroos' reaction made Michael furrow his brow. He had planned to buy the two kangaroos and take them to the estate, then have professionals take care of them. But they seemed too aggressive. He didn't want his estate staff ending up in the hospital every day.

"Alright, Austin. I'll buy your hunting ground. We'll come here to visit these two kangaroos often. I hope you take good care of them," Michael said. Since Austin had raised the kangaroos for so long, he must have rich experience. It was best to let him continue caring for them.

Austin was thrilled. His hunting ground wasn't making much money, and maintaining the animals and weapons was costly. Now that Michael was willing to take on all these expenses, he was naturally very excited.

"Alright, Mr. Williams. Rest assured, I will definitely take good care of them!" With Austin's assurance, Michael went back to Isabella.

Isabella had already finished her takeout. She was so hungry that she ate quickly and even let out a loud burp after finishing.

Unfortunately, this burp was heard by Michael, who had just come in. Isabella's face flushed with embarrassment, realizing her behavior just now a bit rude.

Michael looked at Isabella's blushing face and smiled. "We're married now! No need for all those silly rules. Just do whatever makes you happy!"

Blushing, Isabella nodded. Suddenly, she remembered something and said, "Didn't you say you wanted to hunt wild boar? Today, those two kangaroos kicked a big wild boar to death in the forest! You should have someone drag it out; there's a lot of meat on it!"

###chapter 93 Angry Kenna

After hearing Isabella's words, Michael immediately ordered his crew to search the forest. They soon found the dead wild boar in a pit.

They quickly tied up the boar and hauled it back to the hunting ground.

"I remember Kenna saying he loved hunting when he was young. Why don't we take this wild boar back as a gift for him? The staff at the villa can also enjoy a meal of wild boar meat!" Isabella suggested with a smile.

Michael crouched down to inspect the boar. There were no visible wounds on its body, indicating it was indeed killed by internal injuries from the kangaroos' kicks.

Looking at the huge boar carcass on the ground, Michael felt a chill. If it hadn't been for those two kangaroos, it could have been Isabella lying here instead.

Michael's eyes narrowed as he stared at the boar's body, a cold glint in his eyes. "You're right, this boar almost killed you! We must eat it as revenge!"

Michael waved his hand, and his crew immediately brought a truck, tossed the boar into it, and drove towards the mansion.

"By the way, I hunted a little wild boar today. I was planning to roast it for you, but since you've already had takeout and your stomach is probably full, let's take it back, and I'll roast it for you tomorrow!" Michael said with a smile, signaling for his men to bring up the wild boar he had hunted.

Isabella looked at the small wild boar on the ground in surprise. Although it wasn't as big as the previous boar, it was still as big as a wolfhound. Michael had managed to take it down with just a single arrow. Most surprisingly, the little boar was still alive.

To keep the meat fresh, Michael had his men treat the boar's leg wound to prevent it from bleeding out.

"Well, I guess we'll have to wait until tomorrow to taste your cooking," Isabella said with a shrug.

Michael waved his hand, and his crew immediately took the small wild boar away.

"It's getting late. Let's go back. We've been outside for too long. My dad called me just now, and I didn't dare to tell him you were missing. Now we should go back and let him know you're safe," Michael said, gently touching Isabella's hair and leading her away from the hunting ground.

When Michael and Isabella returned home, Kenna was delighted to see the huge wild boar being carried in.

"You're finally back! Did Michael nab this wild boar? Well done, Michael has always had a knack for hunting!" Kenna praised.

However, Michael shook his head, pointing to the small wild boar next to it. "That small wild boar is my prey. The big one was taken down by Isabella."

Kenna was stunned. With his hunting experience, he could tell that the dead wild boar had no external injuries and seemed to have been beaten to death. How could Isabella, with her physique, possibly take down a full-grown wild boar?

Isabella's face turned red, and she shook her head and waved her hands, indicating that she hadn't killed the wild boar.

"Dad, you've got it all wrong. I didn't take down this boar. When I ran into it, two kangaroos showed up and kicked it to the curb," Isabella explained hastily, recounting how she was rescued by the kangaroos after facing the wild boar.

Isabella shot a glare at Michael after she finished speaking. Michael hadn't told Kenna the whole story. Kenna must have misunderstood her, and she didn't want Kenna to think she was some kind of ruthless person.

To Isabella's surprise, as soon as she finished speaking, Kenna gave Michael a hard whack on the butt with his cane.

Michael clutched his butt and let out a yelp, "Are you crazy, Dad? Why did you hit me?"

Kenna angrily pointed at Michael and shouted, "Don't think I'm dumb. Wild boars don't just pop up in hunting spots! How did you look out for Isabella? Are you even a man? You can't even protect your wife, and she was saved by kangaroos. You're embarrassing me!"

"I was tricked!" Michael said, rubbing his sore butt with a pained expression.

Isabella quickly shielded Michael behind her. "Dad, don't blame Michael. I thought he was attacked by wild animals, so I went into the jungle to find him. He didn't know what was happening, and as soon as he realized I was missing, he sent a lot of people to search for me in the forest!"

Isabella shielded Michael as they backed into the villa. When they reached the stairs, Isabella waved behind her, and Michael quickly ran up the stairs.

Kenna watched Isabella protect Michael, a hint of relief in his eyes, but his expression remained stern.

"Don't fall for it! He couldn't keep you safe, and that's on him." Kenna kept on berating Michael for his carelessness.

Isabella sighed and shook her head. If it were anyone else criticizing Michael, she would have stood up for him. But Kenna was Michael's father and had the right to reprimand him.

Isabella gently walked over and took Kenna's arm, her voice soft and pleading. "Dad, please forgive Michael. He didn't mean to, and he promised to make roasted boar for me tomorrow. If you beat him up, where will I get my roasted boar fix?"

Kenna nodded. Isabella gave him a reason not to scold Michael; he had to accept this favor.

"I'm really sorry, Isabella. I didn't expect you to encounter such danger so soon after arriving here." Kenna patted Isabella's arm and sighed.

A touch of emotion flashed in Isabella's eyes. "It's okay. I will take care of myself in the future."

After chatting with Kenna for a while, Isabella went upstairs. She had spent too long in the forest today and needed a bath to clean up.

When Isabella opened the bedroom door, Michael suddenly pulled her into his arms.

"Thank you for saving me from my father's wrath," Michael teased, his voice close to Isabella's ear.

Isabella's face turned red, and she pushed Michael away in embarrassment. "Stay away from me. I need to take a bath. I have scratches on my body that need ointment, or they will leave scars."

However, Michael suddenly picked up Isabella and walked towards the bathroom. "To thank you, I must serve you. Let me think, what can I do for you? Oh, right, you can't reach your back, can you? I can help you wash it."

###chapter 94 Buried Alive

Just like last time, a heap of clothes got tossed out of the bathroom first, followed by the sound of running water and heavy breathing.

When Isabella finally stepped out of the bathroom, her face was all flushed. She gave Michael's muscular chest a playful slap before flopping down on the bed.

"You jerk! You promised you wouldn't mess with me!" Isabella glared at Michael, a mix of shyness and anger in her eyes.

Just a moment ago in the bathroom, Michael had her leaning against the wall, holding her waist while he stood behind her, finishing their intimate moment in a rear-entry position.

Michael chuckled and patted Isabella's thigh. "Alright, alright, don't be mad. Now that you've had a hot bath and your pores are open, let me put some ointment on you."

Blushing, Isabella nodded and lay down.

She felt pretty shy because most of her injuries were on her arms and legs. Her back was fine since she had been carrying a backpack.

She could've taken care of these wounds herself, but for some reason, watching Michael search for the ointment made her heart flutter.

As Michael gently applied the cold ointment to Isabella's legs, it stirred up the desire she had just quenched.

'If Michael wants to get frisky while applying the ointment, should I go along with it or not?' Isabella wondered, her face still flushed.

To her surprise, after Michael finished with one leg, he had her turn over to do the other side.

Isabella lay there, watching Michael. His eyes showed no desire, just concern.

"Sorry, I promise I'll never let you get hurt like this again," Michael said, his eyes slightly reddening.

Isabella looked into Michael's eyes and was shocked to see he seemed on the verge of tears. It moved her deeply.

"I'm okay now. It's no big deal. Please don't cry, or it'll ruin the image I have of you!" Isabella quickly covered Michael's eyes, trying to stop the tears.

Suddenly, Michael laughed. He wasn't crying. "Can you tell me, what kind of image do you have of me?"

Michael grabbed Isabella's hand, letting her palm rest on his cheek.

Isabella touched Michael's face and smiled gently. "You're my hero! You'll always protect me."

"Seeing you hurt breaks my heart," Michael said.

His words were like a flame, almost melting Isabella.

They gazed into each other's eyes, the air thick with intimacy. Their faces drew closer, almost touching.

Just as their lips were about to meet, Isabella's phone rang.

Michael took a deep breath, annoyed, and glared at the phone. Isabella blushed and awkwardly picked it up to check the caller ID.

"It's Amelia. She might need something urgent. I should've called her back when I landed yesterday, damn it, I forgot." Isabella regretfully tapped her forehead and then answered the phone.

"Isabella, you didn't call me. You should have landed already. Have you been having too many sweet moments with Michael that you forgot about me?" Amelia's teasing voice came through, making Isabella blush even more.

"Sorry, I totally forgot to call you back. There are just too many fun things to do here," Isabella joked. She didn't tell Amelia about the danger she encountered in the forest today, not wanting to worry her.

After some banter, Amelia's tone suddenly became serious.

"By the way, I need to tell you something about your parents," Amelia said, her voice turning somber.

Isabella froze for a moment. Ever since her parents tried to force her to marry John, she had been utterly disappointed to them. After she announced the cancellation of the engagement with John, she had not contacted her parents.

"What happened to them?" Isabella asked calmly.

"Do you remember Pearl? When she was found, it was horrifying. The news showed a photo of her with a mosaic over it, but even with that, it was terrifying! Pearl's father, Paxton, has gone mad. He believes you are responsible for what happened to Pearl. After hearing that you went abroad, he turned his anger towards your parents and had them captured." Amelia's words startled Isabella.

Before going abroad, Isabella had heard about Pearl being found, but she hadn't paid much attention to it. However, hearing Amelia's words now made her realize just how tragic Pearl's situation must have been.

Michael, who was lying on the side, had a flash in his eyes, but he didn't say a word.

"What happened to Pearl and my parents?" Isabella asked urgently.

There was a brief silence on the other end of the line before Amelia spoke. "If you really want to know what happened to Pearl, you should check the news yourself. It's too horrific for me to describe! I can only tell you that after Paxton captured your parents, he planned to bury them alive out of revenge. But at the last moment, John, Bianca, and the police arrived and saved them."

Amelia's tone turned angry as she continued, "That Bianca is so infuriating. After she saved your parents, they hugged her and cried, even going as far as telling the media that Bianca is their closest family. Now the news is portraying you as a coward who abandoned your parents to save yourself."

Isabella's eyelids grew heavy, but she felt no sadness. She had long since lost hope in her parents. As for the media's slander, she couldn't care less.

"After the police arrived, was Paxton arrested?" Isabella was actually more concerned about this.

"No, it wasn't that simple. The police only arrested some of his subordinates. Paxton was not at the scene, and there was no evidence to prove that he ordered those people. His men all claimed they were planning to kidnap your parents for ransom. As for the pit they dug, they said it was just for staging photos to make the whole kidnapping thing seem legit." Amelia's words made Isabella feel pressured.

###chapter 95 Cunning Enemy

Paxton and Pearl were father and daughter, but they couldn't be more different.

Pearl was a total spoiled brat with a mean streak, always acting without thinking about the fallout. She wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, so dealing with her was a piece of cake.

But Paxton? He was a whole different story. He'd managed to push the Brown Family up to one of the top four families, showing just how ruthless and capable he was. The fact that he planned to bury Isabella's parents alive? That said it all about his cold-blooded nature.

Paxton was sly and dangerous, like a wolf hiding in the shadows, ready to pounce when you least expected it.

"Amelia, I don't care about my parents. I'm more worried about you. Please be careful. If you run into any trouble, let me know right away. No, scratch that, I'll get Mason to watch over you. You're my best friend, and Paxton might come after you just to get at me," Isabella said, her voice full of concern.

Amelia went quiet for a moment. She didn't tell Isabella that she'd been feeling like someone was tailing her lately. What baffled her was that, considering Paxton's brutality, she should have been grabbed like Isabella's parents by now. However, whoever it was appeared to be tailing her without taking any action.

"Don't worry, I'm safe. Actually, Mason already called me. I'll ask for his help if I need it," Amelia said, trying to sound chill.

Isabella was surprised to hear Mason had already reached out to Amelia, but she felt a bit relieved too. With Mason's protection, Amelia should be okay.

To avoid Isabella getting suspicious, Amelia swiftly changed the subject.

"So, when are you and Michael planning to have kids? Didn't you say his dad's itching for a grandson?" Amelia teased over the phone.

Isabella blushed instantly. "I can't share something that personal, not even with my bestie, you know? Well, since you're fine, I'm hanging up now. I'm going to bed."

"It's not even bedtime there yet, right? Oh, I get it, you're about to start your 'night activities' with Michael, huh? Alright, I'll let you go then," Amelia said with a cheeky grin before ending the call.

Isabella, still blushing, glanced at Michael, who was giving her a playful look.

Isabella took a deep breath, thinking about Paxton, which made her feel a bit uneasy.

"The Brown Family might not be as powerful as the Williams Family, but they can still give Mason a hard time. I wonder if Mason can handle it. Have they figured out who kidnapped Pearl?" Isabella sighed, her face full of worry, wishing she could fly back home right away.

Michael gently hugged Isabella, patting her back. "Mason's been through a lot over the years. He's way smarter than Paxton. Paxton might stir up some trouble, but Mason can totally handle it."

Even though Isabella trusted Mason, she couldn't shake off her worry. She thought about what Amelia had said about Pearl's rough situation and pulled out her phone to look up news about Pearl.

Michael watched Isabella as she searched for news, hesitated for a moment, but didn't stop her.

When Isabella found the news about Pearl, she glanced at the photos and was so shocked that she threw her phone away.

"Oh my god, this is horrifying! It's so cruel!" Isabella's face turned ghostly pale with fear.

She finally got why Paxton was so full of rage. Any dad would lose it seeing his daughter in such a terrible state.

"You didn't do this, did you?" Isabella looked at Michael, her voice shaking.

Michael calmly met her eyes. "Do you think I'm capable of something that brutal?"

Isabella hesitated, then shook her head. "No, you wouldn't be that cruel. Someone's trying to stir up trouble between the Brown Family and the Williams Family. The real culprit might be from one of the other two families."

Michael opened his mouth but didn't say anything.

In reality, Pearl's tragic situation was indeed connected to him. One of his guys had gotten her plans out of her.

Pearl had planned to have Isabella gang-raped and spread the video all over the city. One of the men she recruited had HIV and other STDs. She wanted to ruin Isabella completely.

When Michael found out about Pearl's plan, he wanted her dead immediately. He found a sadistic murderer from prison and handed Pearl over to him.

Michael later learned what the sadistic murderer did to Pearl. After using the murderer, Michael had him dumped into the sea.

According to Michael's original plan, in that city, the only people Isabella cared about were Amelia and Mason. Mason didn't need his protection, and Benjamin would protect Amelia.

A crazed Paxton would kill everyone associated with Isabella, including her parents, Jasper, Mia, and her cousin Bianca.

However, Michael's plan had a slight hiccup. Paxton acted too late, and John had already protected all these people.

But for Michael, getting rid of Paxton was a piece of cake.

"Since everyone thinks this is a conspiracy involving the four major families, let's keep that going," Michael thought, his eyes cold.

Michael was determined to take down the Brown Family that had replaced the Taylor Family. As Isabella's husband, he had to help her restore her family's honor.

Amelia put her phone down on the table and sighed deeply. Even though she hadn't faced any real danger recently, the constant feeling of being followed always made her uneasy.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, which startled her.

Alone in the house, Amelia grabbed a kitchen knife and cautiously approached the door.

She decided to stay silent, hoping the person outside would think no one was home and leave. But the knocking persisted, showing no signs of stopping.

Just as Amelia was about to call the police in fear, Benjamin's voice came from outside. "Amelia, I know you're home. It's me. Open the door."

###chapter 96 Benjamin's Kindness

Amelia let out a big sigh of relief when she heard Benjamin's voice and peeked through the peephole to see him standing outside.

She swung the door open and let him in.

The moment Benjamin stepped inside, he let out a huge yawn. His eyes were all puffy with dark circles, clearly showing he hadn't slept well for days.

"Just wrapped up a 17-hour surgery. Man, I'm exhausted," Benjamin said, flopping onto the couch.

Amelia rolled her eyes and plopped down on the other end of the sofa. "Just a reminder, this is my place. Can you try not to act like you own it?"

Benjamin smirked, "Aren't we a couple? Do we really need to be so formal?"

Amelia blushed but shot back, "Just because we hooked up after drinking doesn't mean we're a couple!"

Benjamin propped his chin up, grinning at her. "You really don't wanna be my girlfriend? I've been worried sick about you these past few days."

"Worried about me? Why?" Amelia paused, suddenly remembering the creepy feeling of being followed lately.

She jumped up from the couch, glaring at him. "So it was you stalking me! You creep!"

Benjamin rolled his eyes and sat up. "Do you even hear yourself? I'm a busy surgeon. How on earth would I have time to follow you around?"

"Then who's been following me?" Amelia asked, realizing how dumb her question sounded. Who else could it be but someone from the Brown Family?

To her surprise, Benjamin pointed at himself. "I had people following you. More like a team of bodyguards secretly protecting you."

Amelia was stunned for a second, then grabbed Benjamin's collar, shouting, "Do you know how freaked out I've been? Why didn't you just tell me you were protecting me?"

Benjamin noticed a kitchen knife on the table and awkwardly scratched his head. "I thought bodyguards would make you uncomfortable, so I had them keep a low profile. Didn't think you'd notice them."

Amelia let go of his collar and picked up the kitchen knife. Benjamin immediately jumped up, hiding behind the couch.

"Considering how tight we've been, there's no call for this, is there? I just want to keep you safe," Benjamin said, pointing at her in panic.

Amelia rolled her eyes and put the knife back in the kitchen. "I was just putting the knife away. Why are you so scared?"

Benjamin let out a sigh of relief as she sat back down. "The security detail gave me a heads-up, mentioning you might have spotted them. Were you attempting to shake them off today? You're incredible! They nearly lost sight of you."

Amelia raised her chin proudly. Since realizing she was being followed, she'd been hitting up crowded places, ducking into women's clothing stores to change outfits, and taking all sorts of convoluted routes-just like in the TV shows!

Seeing Amelia's proud look, Benjamin shook his head with a wry smile. "You know? One of the stores you ducked into today is owned by the Brown Family. The manager tipped them off that you left through the back door."

Amelia's face went pale instantly.

Benjamin saw her reaction and knew she was finally feeling the fear. He rolled his eyes and said sarcastically, "Now you're scared? If my bodyguards hadn't found you and stopped the Brown's people in time, you wouldn't be seeing me right now."

"What should I do now?" Amelia asked, her voice full of anxiety.

Benjamin dropped the teasing and got serious. "I've set up a safe house for you. From now on, bodyguards will be sticking close. To keep things low-key, they'll be posing as your colleagues and roommates."

Amelia wasn't exactly thrilled about Benjamin's plan. Ever since that night they spent together, she'd been feeling all sorts of conflicted. She wasn't the type to easily give her heart away.

But she also knew that without Benjamin's help, the Brown Family could totally ruin her.

"Do I have to keep hiding like this?" Amelia asked, feeling pretty down.

Benjamin sighed. "We can only hope the Williams Family figures out who hurt Pearl soon. If they can't, you'll have to keep hiding-unless Paxton dies."

Benjamin squinted, thinking that if it were Michael, he might already be plotting how to take out Paxton.

"This is too much hassle. Maybe I should just follow Isabella and hide abroad," Amelia suggested.

Benjamin rolled his eyes. "If you go abroad, it'll be even harder for me to protect you. The Brown Family could easily hire mercenaries or assassins to come after you. Wait, there might be one place. You could go to Emberlyn. I've been there; the security is top-notch. It'd be the safest place for you, though foreigners can't stay long. I'll do my best to extend your visa."

Amelia thanked Benjamin. Going to Emberlyn sounded like a good plan, but she didn't want to leave her friends and family behind.

After packing her bags, Amelia left with Benjamin to stay at the safe house for now.

Meanwhile, overseas, Scarlett was fuming in her room. She threw everything off the table and shattered the mirror.

Scarlett had just been bailed out of the police station. Her parents had found out she almost killed Isabella.

"Scarlett, how could you be so foolish? I know you like Michael, but now is not the time to act! Michael and Isabella are on their honeymoon; their relationship is strong. Interfering now is a terrible idea!" Scarlett's mother scolded her.

Scarlett's father glared at her in anger. "Cut the crap. You should be thinking about how to apologize to them!"

Pointing at herself, Scarlett angrily shouted, "Why should I apologize? Why should I apologize to that bitch Isabella!"

###chapter 97 Scarlett's New Plan

Scarlett had no intention of apologizing to Isabella, and she was seriously let down by Michael after today's events. She was holding a grudge against him and had no intention of saying sorry to him either.

Her parents, seeing how stubborn she was being, were at a loss for words. They just told her to think it over and left it at that.

After trashing her room, Scarlett decided she needed a drink to forget her troubles for a while.

She had the maid clean up the mess and then drove herself to a bar.

The commercial street was buzzing with life, full of well-dressed people hugging and even making out in public. The vibe was all about freedom.

Scarlett parked her car under the flickering neon lights and walked into a bar.

The place was called 'Lightning Speed,' and it was actually Scarlett's own bar, a spot she opened mainly for her and her friends to hang out.

She found a booth, sat down, and asked the waiter to bring out her best bottle of wine.

The bar's security guards knew the drill and stood nearby, keeping any guys from bothering her.

In her sexy red dress, black stockings, and red high heels, Scarlett looked absolutely stunning, oozing a seductive charm.

She took a sip of her wine, holding it in her mouth for a moment. The simple act made the security guard watching her swallow hard.

Scarlett knew she was being watched, but she liked it. In this bar, she felt like a queen, commanding everyone's attention.

'I'm amazing, so why doesn't Michael want me or even glance my way? I'm clearly a hit with the guys,' she thought, feeling a bit down. She set her glass down and glanced at the men sneaking peeks at her.

A smirk crossed her face. 'These guys are so beneath Michael. The man I want has to have some serious class.'

Just then, a security guard came over and whispered to her, "Ms. Ramirez, someone wants to see you. Says he has a business proposition."

Scarlett looked over to where the guard pointed and saw a young, handsome guy with blond hair and blue eyes, but he had a bit of a rogue look to him.

A mocking smile played on Scarlett's lips. Every guy who tried to hit on her always had some excuse, and "business" was the most common one.

"Alright, bring him over. I'm bored; this might be fun," she said, signaling to the guard, who brought the young man over.

The guy's eyes flicked to her stockings and heels, a lecherous glint in his eyes before he swallowed.

"Hey there, beautiful. I'm Bob Reed," he said, extending his hand for a shake. But Scarlett just held her wine glass and gave him a look.

"Not everyone gets to shake my hand. So, you want to talk business? What kind of business?" she asked, setting down her glass and fixing her captivating eyes on Bob with a hint of a smile.

Bob was a bit miffed at first when Scarlett didn't shake his hand, but his heart started pounding when he saw her stunning face.

"I've got something that can make you a ton of money! Just let me sell it here. I'll give you twenty percent of the profits-no, thirty percent!" Bob said, pulling out a small bag of white powder from his pocket, thinking it would seal the deal.

Scarlett's smile vanished, and her eyes turned icy. "You want to sell drugs in my bar? Didn't anyone tell you I don't allow that crap here?"

She slammed the table, and the security guards were on Bob in a flash, grabbing him.

"Throw him into the river to cool off," Scarlett ordered coldly.

The guards started dragging Bob out, ready to toss him into the water.

Bob panicked. He knew the bar had a strict no-drug policy, but he thought his charm might win Scarlett over. He had even promised his boss he'd get the job done. If he failed, his boss might cut off one of his hands.

"Wait, Ms. Ramirez, please give me a chance! I'll do anything for you," Bob begged desperately.

Suddenly, Scarlett had an idea and waved her hand.

The guards let go of Bob, who dropped to his knees in front of Scarlett.

"Ms. Ramirez, as long as you agree to my request, I'll do anything you want!" Bob pleaded.

Scarlett's eyes narrowed as she thought of a new plan against Isabella.

"I need you to follow someone and plant your drugs in her bag. I'll send you her photo and details soon. If you can pull it off, I'll let you sell your stuff here," Scarlett said, a wicked smile spreading across her face like an evil Medusa.

Bob nodded eagerly. For a small-time crook like him, planting something in someone's bag was a piece of cake.

After hashing out the plan with Bob, Scarlett let him go. She had someone tail Bob to make sure he didn't double-cross her and arranged for Isabella's photos and info to be sent to him discreetly.

Scarlett's plan was simple: frame Isabella by planting drugs on her. She knew Kenna hated drugs. If he found out Isabella was using or involved with drugs, he'd put a stop to Michael and Isabella's marriage.

Isabella had no clue Scarlett was plotting against her again.

The next morning, Isabella got up, did her makeup, and put on new clothes because Michael was taking her on a city tour.

When Michael and Isabella arrived at a city landmark, Scarlett, who had been tipped off, sent their location to Bob.

Bob got to work right away, gathering a bunch of his thug friends to make sure the mission went off without a hitch.

Scarlett, hearing that Bob had started the job, smirked. After framing Isabella, she'd deal with Bob. A proud swan like her would never agree to the demands of a lowly toad like him.

Poor Bob had no idea that once he completed the task, he would be as good as dead.

###chapter 98 Make a Bet

Bob got Scarlett's message and hustled over to the address with his crew.

After checking Isabella's photo, Bob looked up and was floored.

"Who the heck needs 12 bodyguards just for a city tour? She sure values her life. Even the president doesn't roll that deep." Bob and his buddies were all blown away.

Michael held Isabella's hand as they strolled down the street, surrounded by 12 bodyguards.

The bodyguards in their black suits were so obvious that people couldn't help but stare, some even whipped out their phones to snap pics.

Isabella felt super embarrassed. She squeezed Michael's hand and asked, "Do we really need this many people to protect me? This is so awkward."

"It's fine. It's my dad's idea. He really cares about you," Michael said with a smile, though he felt pretty helpless inside.

"If it weren't for the language barrier, I would've hired those two kangaroos as Isabella's bodyguards! As for you, I don't think you can protect her well." Those were Kenna's exact words.

Even though Isabella got this was Kenna's idea, she still felt really uncomfortable.

"I know your dad's loaded, but isn't hiring so many bodyguards for me too expensive?" Isabella asked, worried. She didn't want Kenna to feel any financial strain because of her.

Michael had already thought of an answer. He grinned and said, "These bodyguards might look tough, but they're actually just local college students working part-time."

Isabella paused and took a closer look at the bodyguards. Besides the two female bodyguards, the other ten were burly guys with fierce looks.

Isabella leaned in and whispered to Michael, "Those guys look like they're 40. Are they really still in college?"

Michael scratched his mouth and whispered back, "They just look older. Don't judge by appearances."

Isabella still found it hard to buy Michael's story. It seemed impossible for someone to look that old at a young age.

Isabella hesitated, then walked up to one of the oldest-looking bodyguards and poked his shirt. "Excuse me, sir, how old are you?"

The bodyguard turned around, revealing a bright smile with deep wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. "Mrs. Williams, I'm 24 years old!"

Isabella's eyes widened in disbelief. "You're only 24? No way! You look like you're 42."

The bodyguard gave a wry smile. "I look older due to years of late nights, smoking, drinking, and indulging in fried foods. Are you saying I'm ugly, Mrs. Williams?"

The bodyguard looked hurt, and Isabella waved her hands frantically.

"No, no, that's not what I meant. You misunderstood. But it's still important to maintain a healthy lifestyle." Isabella awkwardly smiled and then retreated to Michael's side.

Michael looked at Isabella with a teasing grin. "I wasn't wrong, was I? Is he feeling like you're dissing him?"

Isabella glared at Michael, embarrassed. "Enough, let's go."

Just as they were about to leave, a kid on a bike suddenly appeared behind them.

The boy rode up and then crashed right in front of Isabella.

The bodyguards instantly went on high alert.

The bike's wheel was still spinning, and the boy was clutching his leg, groaning in pain.

"He's hurt," Isabella said, moving to help the boy, but Michael held her back.

Michael glanced at the 24-year-old bodyguard, who nodded and approached the boy.

"The security here isn't great. Opportunistic thieves and even robbers exploit people's goodwill to carry out their plans. Take a look. No one's stepping up. It speaks volumes," Michael explained to Isabella.

Isabella looked at the passersby and then at the bodyguards around them, feeling speechless.

"Maybe the passersby think these twelve bodyguards look too intimidating and don't dare to come over. Or maybe they think with so many of us here, we would help the boy, so they don't feel the need to?" Isabella speculated.

Michael shrugged. "Maybe you're right, but you don't know this place like I do."

Isabella looked at Michael defiantly. "But I think that boy is innocent."

Michael's lips curled into a sly smile. "How about a bet? If I'm right, you grant me a wish. If you're right, I'll grant you one."

Isabella found Michael's smile was somewhat mysterious. Yet, she remained assured that she wouldn't lose; there couldn't be that many bad people in the world.

"Alright, I'll take that bet. Let's see if the boy is innocent!" Isabella said, her expression turning serious.

Not far away, Bob and his friends were watching the teenager on the bike, their eyes full of hopeful anticipation.

'Women are kind-hearted, most of them are. She'll definitely come closer when she sees a boy in need of help. Then we can slip the goods into her bag,' Bob thought, a smile spreading across his face. Even with Isabella's bodyguards, they wouldn't lose.

The teenager lying on the ground was named Billy Murphy. When he saw Isabella approaching, he felt a surge of joy, ready to slip the bag of white powder into her purse.

But Michael stopped Isabella and had a bodyguard step in instead.

"Damn it, that guy ruined our plan," Billy muttered under his breath.

The bodyguard walked up and squatted in front of Billy, who continued to clutch his leg and wail.

"Sir, could you please help me? I think my leg might be broken," Billy said, looking up at the bodyguard with a pained expression.

Billy was the best actor among them; his dream was to become an actor, but he never got the chance.

The bodyguard lowered his head and glanced at Billy's leg, a cold smile appearing on his face.

"I've been to the battlefield. No one understands injuries better than me. Kid, I don't care what you're planning, but you'd better leave now, or else." The bodyguard lightly lifted his shirt, revealing the handgun tucked at his waist.

###chapter 99 Friends Turned Foes

Seeing the gun tucked into the bodyguard's waistband, Billy's heart nearly jumped out of his chest. The guy radiated danger, and Billy could feel it in his bones.

Billy wasn't about to try anything stupid now. He got up, grabbed his bike, and bolted.

The bodyguard stood up, flashing a genuine smile of 'a 24-year-old college student.'

"Mr. Williams, this guy's a faker. He probably saw you were a tourist and thought he could scam you. If you help him, he'll claim you pushed him," the bodyguard explained, leaving Isabella both shocked and pissed.

Even if Isabella doubted the bodyguard's take on Billy, she couldn't ignore what she saw. Billy had claimed his legs were in agony, yet he managed to run off with a bike. Clearly, he was full of it.

"My dear Isabella, looks like you lost," Michael teased as he walked over.

Isabella blushed and shot Michael a reproachful look. "I'm just not as familiar with this place as you are. Fine, I lost. What do you want me to do?"

Michael smirked, his eyes roaming over Isabella like he was undressing her with his gaze. Isabella instinctively covered her chest, glaring at him.

Just as Isabella was about to warn Michael not to make any crazy demands, Michael shrugged. "I haven't decided yet. Let's wait and see."

Isabella let out a sigh of relief. For a moment, her mind had been filled with scenes straight out of a dirty movie.

If Michael suggested those awkward sexual positions, Isabella might not refuse, but she still felt shy and nervous.

"What are you thinking? Why is your face getting redder? Are you getting a fever?" Michael reached out and touched Isabella's forehead.

Isabella leaned back. "I'm fine. What's our next plan?"

Michael couldn't figure out what Isabella was thinking, so he shrugged and pulled out his phone to check the itinerary he had set up the night before.

"We're going to watch a movie. It's a popular sci-fi flick," Michael said.

Isabella nodded and linked arms with Michael as they walked towards the nearby movie theater, bodyguards in tow.

Meanwhile, Billy pushed his bike over to where Bob and the others were.

"How could you chicken out like that? You were so embarrassing! Did you forget the task I gave you? You're such a coward," Bob snapped at Billy.

Billy was furious. He knocked over the bike and made a gun shape with his hand. "Do you know those bodyguards are packing heat? They're not just any bodyguards; they've been to war and killed people. Just one look from them nearly made me piss myself, and you want me to plant drugs in Isabella's bag right in front of them? Are you serious?"

Billy angrily threw the bag of white powder at Bob. "If you want to complete your task, do it yourself. Don't drag us into it. We're not ready to die with you." He flipped Bob the bird and stormed off.

The people around Bob started to look uneasy after hearing Billy's words.

Bob's face darkened. He wanted to strangle Billy right then and there, but he knew he couldn't. If he did, his crew would see him as a ruthless tyrant. Even if they didn't bolt now, they'd probably stab him in the back later.

Bob knew he had to win them back.

"Hey, everyone, I know Billy's words freaked you out. But think about the lives we had before! Now there's a golden opportunity right in front of us! All we need to do is slip that bag of white powder into Isabella's purse! We'll be rolling in cash every night," Bob said, trying to reel them in with the promise of money.

For this bunch of thugs, cash was the ultimate motivator.

One of the female thugs spoke up, "They're headed to a nearby cinema, probably to catch a movie. The cinema might be our best shot. My cousin works there; I can get us some uniforms. We can disguise ourselves as staff and sneak in. Maybe we'll find an opening."

Bob's eyes lit up; this was a solid plan.

Led by the female thug, the group made their way to the movie theater.

The female thug found her cousin, chatted her up to keep her distracted, while Bob and the others sneaked into the staff changing room and swiped some uniforms.

Just as they were getting ready, the female thug suddenly stopped them. "Damn it, my cousin just told me that a rich guy rented out the entire cinema! Every employee knows about it. If you show up in the theater, the bodyguards will definitely get suspicious."

Her words made Bob and the others' hearts sink.

"Damn it, what now?" Bob angrily scratched his head, then his eyes landed on the women's restroom, and a bold idea hit him.

"Wait a minute, if I remember right, only two of those twelve bodyguards are women, right? This might be our only shot! Listen up, everyone." Bob gestured for his crew to huddle up as he laid out his plan.

In the theater, Isabella sat next to Michael, glancing around the empty hall. It was just the two of them and their bodyguards, with no other customers in sight.

Isabella had no idea Michael had rented out the entire showing. She looked at him, puzzled, and asked, "I checked online, and this movie has great reviews. Why is it just us here?"

Michael shrugged. "How would I know? Maybe the studio paid for good reviews from online users or critics. The movie might not live up to the hype, which is why no one showed up."

"That could be true. This movie has been out for a while. Maybe everyone who wanted to see it has already seen it." Isabella smiled and let it go.

After a while, the theater door opened, and Bob and the others walked in carrying trays with snacks and drinks.

###chapter 100 No Chance to Act

The door swung open, grabbing everyone's attention, including Michael, Isabella, and the bodyguards.

All eyes landed on Bob and his crew, making the air feel icy. The bodyguards' stares were as cold as Billy had warned-clearly, they exuded an air of combat expertise.

One of the bodyguards stepped forward, squinting. "Wasn't the instruction clear to avoid unnecessary entry?" he said, his voice frosty.

Bob gulped, forcing a smile that looked more like a grimace. "Uh, these are complimentary snacks and drinks from the cinema. Thought you might enjoy them while watching the movie."

The guard eyed the popcorn, fries, chips, and colorful drinks in Bob's hands.

"Wait here." The guard headed back to the audience area to inform Michael and Isabella about the situation.

Isabella's face lit up with a smile when she heard about the snacks and drinks. "Isn't this nice? You've been looking out for us for ages; you must be beat. How about grabbing some snacks and drinks and joining us for the movie?"

Michael glanced at the bodyguard, raised an eyebrow, and the bodyguard got the message.

"Thank you, Ms. Taylor." The guard smiled at Isabella, then walked back to Bob and his group.

"Put it down and you can go." The guards took the items and dismissed Bob and his crew.

The '24-year-old college student' bodyguard, who seemed to be the leader, looked at the food and drinks and said calmly, "Six people will share the first batch. If no one has any adverse reactions in half an hour, the next six can eat."

The bodyguards quickly picked six people, who then ate snacks and drank while watching the movie. After half an hour, they switched with the others.

"The iced tea here is pretty good. Want to try it?" Isabella offered, pointing to the iced tea in her hand.

Michael nodded, then grabbed Isabella's arm and pulled the iced tea towards him, taking a sip from the straw Isabella had just used.

Isabella's face turned red again. "How could you share a straw with me? That's not sanitary."

Michael rolled his eyes. "Do you hear yourself? We've kissed, and your tongue was like a wild snake. You didn't worry about hygiene then, did you?"

Isabella's face turned as red as a beet. She slapped Michael's shoulder and angrily turned back to the movie.

Michael smirked, knowing Isabella was super shy. He could see her chest rising and falling rapidly with her quickened breath.

Outside the cinema, Bob and his team regrouped.

"Damn it, this plan has to work. I spent a fortune on all those snacks and drinks!" Bob felt his heart ache. The cinema didn't provide those for free; he paid for everything himself!

Bob's plan was to give Isabella free drinks and snacks to make her feel the need to go to the bathroom.

If she went to the restroom, there would be only two female bodyguards following her. If they could hide in the restroom stalls beforehand, there might be a chance to slip drugs into Isabella's bag.

Bob's original plan was to drug the drinks, knocking out the bodyguards, Isabella, and Michael, making things a whole lot easier.

But one of his partners quickly shot that idea down.

The military folks had their own poison-testing procedures. They'd probably have one person eat the food first to see if they got poisoned. If not, then the rest would eat.

If they had gone with Bob's original plan, they would definitely have gotten shot by the bodyguards. Those guys were armed and not to be messed with!

Bob had to come up with a new idea. The women's restroom was their only shot.

Over 30 minutes later, Bob's plan seemed to be working. Isabella felt the urge to go to the bathroom.

"I need to use the restroom. I'll be back in a moment," Isabella said as she walked out of the theater. Michael waved his hand, and the two female bodyguards followed her.

"I'm just going to the restroom. There won't be any danger," Isabella said, looking at the two female bodyguards behind her, feeling a bit helpless.

One of the female bodyguards smiled and shook her head. "Sorry, Ms. Taylor, it's our duty. Please understand."

The other female bodyguard entered the women's restroom first to check it thoroughly. She found that out of the five stalls, four were occupied and only one was empty.

Isabella felt a bit embarrassed as she entered the restroom, noticing the bodyguard peering through the gap under the stalls.

"What is she doing?" Isabella asked the bodyguard next to her.

The bodyguard whispered, "She's checking for any suspicious people. There's a noticeable difference between someone genuinely using the restroom and someone just pretending to. Plus, their clothing can indicate if they're a normal person or an assassin."

Isabella swallowed hard. She couldn't believe what she had just heard. The bodyguard was actually on guard against assassins!

If Isabella remembered correctly, the only person who wanted to kill her now was Pearl's father, Paxton. But Paxton didn't seem to have much influence in this country.

The bodyguard confirmed that the four stalls were occupied by female theater staff. Then she nodded towards Isabella.

Isabella sighed helplessly and entered the empty stall.

The women hiding in the other four stalls were actually using the restroom to ensure the success of their mission. They had been crouching there so long their legs were almost numb.

One of them took a deep breath, recalling their entire plan in her mind, 'Next, we just have to wait for Isabella to finish using the restroom, go to the mirror to touch up her makeup, and then we rush out. Three of us will hold the guards back, while the remaining one will slip the drugs into Isabella's bag.'

Just then, they heard the sound of the door opening from Isabella's stall, indicating that Isabella had finished using the restroom.

'Here we go!' one woman thought, enduring the numbness in her legs, she pushed open the stall door, only to find that the doors of the other three stalls remained shut.

And to make matters worse, Isabella hadn't even touched up her makeup in the restroom; she hadn't even brought her purse! How could a woman not touch up her makeup after using the restroom!

###chapter 101 A Bunch of Total Losers

The first thug who stepped out of the restroom stall didn't even get a chance to react.

She was fuming. They had spent money and even swiped clothes for this plan. If this got out, her cousin might lose her job.

All their efforts had gone down the drain.

She took out her frustration on her three companions. She yanked open the stalls and dragged them out.

"Why didn't you come out earlier? That was the perfect chance, and you blew it!" she snapped.

The three thugs looked embarrassed. "Sorry, our legs went numb. We couldn't stand up."

She was beyond exasperated. They had missed the best opportunity for such a simple reason.

She stormed out of the restroom and saw Bob waiting outside.

Bob looked at her with hope. "How did it go? Mission accomplished?"

She glared at him and pointed to the three thugs behind her. "Ask them."

Bob immediately had a bad feeling.

When the three women explained to Bob that their legs had gone numb and they couldn't come out of the stalls, he was almost beside himself with frustration.

'Oh my God, I'm a dead man' Bob thought in despair.

Meanwhile, Isabella returned to the theater and sat next to Michael.

The movie was hitting its climax. The grand explosions, combined with the futuristic and exaggerated yet aesthetically pleasing technology, were exhilarating to watch.

"I think this movie is great. Why is the theater so empty?" Isabella asked Michael, puzzled after watching the spectacular scenes.

Michael shrugged. "How would I know? Maybe the theater didn't advertise it well enough."

He didn't bother explaining; he believed it was wise to let Isabella figure it out on her own.

Isabella thought for a moment and then figured it out. "It must be because people nearby have already seen this movie, so they won't come to watch it again."

"You're really something, my wife, so sharp." Michael patted Isabella's hair with satisfaction.

Isabella raised her swan-like neck, a proud expression on her face.

But then Isabella's expression became serious. "By the way, Michael, I need to tell you something. Ever since we walked into this theater, I've had this weird feeling like we're being followed. It's just... off."

Michael's expression became more serious. "Are you sure?"

Isabella nodded, then hesitated and shook her head. "It's just a feeling; I have no evidence. By the way, did you prepare those things I asked for?"

Michael nodded. "The things you asked for were simple to arrange. I've already taken care of it. Are you sure you want to use them?"

Isabella's expression was very serious. "Yes. I never underestimate a woman's jealousy. Whether it's Bianca or Pearl, they can be quite spiteful. I'm not very familiar with your friend Scarlett; perhaps she'll ease off after your warning, but I can't risk it. I hope you understand."

Michael gently stroked Isabella's hair and nodded seriously. "If I have to pick between you two, it's a no-brainer-it's you, without a doubt. If she dares to harm you, she'll rue regret it."

Isabella blushed a little. Michael's words gave her a surge of confidence, and she found herself even more drawn to him.

Meanwhile, Scarlett was getting a skincare treatment at the beauty salon when one of her subordinates approached.

"Ms. Ramirez, someone named Bob is calling for you," the subordinate said.

Scarlett extended her hand, and the subordinate quickly handed her the phone.

"Hello, Bob? How did it go?" Scarlett asked.

Bob sounded nervous and embarrassed. "I'm really sorry, Ms. Ramirez. There are too many bodyguards around Isabella. We haven't had a chance to act. Could you give us a bit more time?"

Scarlett's face twisted in anger, even causing her face mask to deform. "You're such a useless fool! Do you think I'll give you another chance? Get lost, punk! If I catch you selling drugs in my bar, I'll chop you up and feed you to the fish!"

Scarlett sat up, ripped off the face mask, and kicked everyone out of the room.

"What a bunch of total losers! I shouldn't have relied on a thug! Maybe I should handle this myself," she muttered, her eyes narrowing as another thought crossed her mind.

Scarlett immediately grabbed a spare phone and called her father, Wilder Ramirez. "Dad, I agree to what you said last time. Let's go to Michael's house and apologize to Isabella."

Wilder was overjoyed. Scarlett finally agreed to compromise, which was crucial for the businesses of both families.

"Let's do it tomorrow then. I'll figure out what we should give them as compensation today," Wilder said before hanging up.

Scarlett stared at the phone, her eyes narrowing. "I bet Isabella doesn't have that many bodyguards at home!"

A cold smile spread across Scarlett's face.

Isabella had no idea Scarlett was plotting against her again. At that moment, she was trying to resist Michael's advances.

"Not here, there are so many people around. The bodyguards are watching," Isabella whispered, blushing, as she grabbed Michael's hand that was reaching for her thigh.

Michael's hand continued to caress Isabella's smooth thigh. He whispered softly in her ear, "No one will see. Those bodyguards won't notice."

Isabella glanced back and saw that the bodyguards had moved to the last row, intently watching the movie.

She was stunned for a moment, her face turning even redder. But this time, her resistance to Michael's advances weakened significantly.

"Remember that bet we made? The loser had to grant the winner a wish. Does that still stand?" Michael whispered teasingly in Isabella's ear.

###chapter 102 Flirting During the Movie

Isabella definitely remembered the bet she had with Michael, but she didn't think he'd bring it up now.

Michael was just messing with Isabella; a little flirting never hurt anyone, right?

Just as Michael was about to move his hand off Isabella's thigh, he froze. He felt a cool, soft hand slip into his pants and touch his dick, causing a swift erection.

"I was just kidding around. You're so bold," Michael whispered in Isabella's ear, his breath shaky.

Isabella's face turned even redder. "Why didn't you say so earlier! You're such a pain!"

Isabella was about to pull her hand away, but Michael grabbed it.

"Since you started, you might as well finish," Michael teased, his eyes full of desire.

Michael felt his body heat up. Even without a mirror, he knew his face must be bright red. In this private theater, they didn't have to worry about being seen.

"Relax, no one's gonna notice," Michael chuckled softly.

Michael felt Isabella's hand stroking his dick, her slightly sharp nails gently scratching the skin, sending a faint tickling sensation that made him shiver.

"Michael, why are you getting all worked up?" Isabella teased in his ear, her face flushed, feeling thrilled in this environment.

Isabella's fingers gently played with Michael's dick, which started secreting pre-cum to lubricate.

"Isabella, since you're helping me, it's only fair I help you enjoy it too," Michael said with a mischievous grin.

Isabella paused for a moment, then her body trembled slightly. A hand had slipped under her skirt, fingers brushing against her vulva.

The same tingling sensation made Isabella tightly grab her skirt.

"Isabella, my fingers are a bit cold too," Michael said, his fingers stroking her labia through her panties. Isabella's body trembled slightly in response.

"I was wrong. Michael, please take your fingers out now," Isabella pleaded softly, glancing at the bodyguards behind them.

She had just wanted to tease Michael for a bit, feeling a sudden rush of excitement. She hadn't expected him to react so strongly.

Isabella could feel her vagina starting to get wet. If he kept going, she might climax in the movie theater.

A young bodyguard sitting in the last row looked puzzled at the two of them, whispering, "Is it really that cold in here? Why are Mr. and Mrs. Williams shaking like that?"

The '24-year-old' bodyguard smacked him on the back of the head. "Mind your own business and watch the movie."

The young bodyguard scratched his head, not daring to speak, and just obediently followed the instructions.

Michael and Isabella leaned against each other, like a loving couple. But if you looked closer, you'd notice that each of them had a hand hidden in the other's crotch.

Isabella carefully glanced behind her again and saw that the bodyguards were engrossed in the movie. This made her feel much more relaxed.

Michael suddenly felt a wet sensation on his fingers. Having been intimate with Isabella before, he immediately knew what it was. He leaned in and whispered with a chuckle, "Isabella, looks like your panties are soaked."

Isabella blushed. She hadn't expected that just a few touches through her underwear would make her body react this way. Would Michael think she was too easy?

Suddenly, Isabella let out a short gasp as Michael's fingers slipped past her underwear and into her.

Although Isabella quickly covered her mouth, someone still heard her. The young bodyguard lowered his head again to look at Isabella.

The older bodyguard forcibly lifted the head of the young bodyguard. "Watch the movie. Don't look elsewhere," he warned in a low voice.

Although the young bodyguard was very puzzled, he continued to watch the movie.

Michael, startled by Isabella's earlier sound, didn't dare move, but his fingers remained inside her.

"Stop it, Michael. I promise we'll continue at home," Isabella pleaded softly, her voice trembling from the earlier scare. She withdrew her hand, but Michael didn't stop; his fingers continued to move inside her.

"No way, Isabella. Your hand has been in my pants for so long, it's only fair I get to do the same," Michael whispered back.

Michael felt Isabella becoming wetter and tried to push his fingers deeper.

Suddenly, Isabella let out another gasp. This time, no one looked their way, but she felt a surge of panic.

Isabella leaned close to Michael's ear, gritted her teeth, and scolded softly, "You jerk! You just hit my sensitive spot!"

"Sensitive spot?" Michael grinned mischievously, feeling an urge to keep pressing that spot.

"That's enough. I don't want to watch the movie anymore. Let's go." Isabella couldn't hold on any longer. She forcefully pulled Michael out of the theater. She had a feeling that if they stayed any longer, she might actually climax in the theater, and she didn't want anyone to think she had wet herself-that would be too embarrassing.

After leaving the movie theater, Isabella walked ahead with Michael following behind her. Whenever Michael tried to catch up to her, Isabella would quicken her pace to keep distance between them.

Fortunately, there were enough bodyguards around to split into two groups, with six people protecting each of them.

Michael looked somewhat helpless. He ran to Isabella and grabbed her hand.

"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that in the movie theater." As soon as Michael spoke, Isabella quickly covered his mouth.

Isabella's face turned red with anxiety. She glanced at the bodyguards around them and whispered urgently into Michael's ear, "Don't mention that in front of these people! We'll talk about it at home."

Her face was flushed, and her eyes were filled with panic, like a deer caught in the headlights.

Michael grabbed Isabella's hand, wanting to say something comforting, but then he noticed a curly hair caught under her fingernail.

Michael's mouth twitched immediately. If he remembered correctly, this was the same hand that had been in his pants earlier.

###chapter 103 Scarlett's Apology

When Isabella and Michael got back to their mansion, they were shocked to find someone waiting for them.

Inside, Kenna was sitting on the couch looking pretty down, leaning on a cane. Across from him was Scarlett, and next to her was a middle-aged woman who looked a lot like Scarlett-probably her mom.

Isabella's mood took a nosedive when she saw Scarlett. Michael seemed to have a hunch about why Scarlett was there. He gently guided Isabella to sit on the couch next to them.

"Don't say anything. Just watch," Michael whispered in Isabella's ear.

Isabella nodded, and they sat on the nearby couch, holding hands.

Scarlett's eyes flashed with jealousy when she saw how close they were.

Scarlett was supposed to come the next day, but she couldn't wait to set Isabella up, so she dragged her mom, Lyanna Patel, over today.

Kenna looked at Isabella and said, a bit reproachfully, "Isabella, why didn't you tell me about the danger you faced yesterday? I thought it was just a wild boar, but I didn't know you were actually set up!"

Isabella glanced at Scarlett in surprise. Was Scarlett here to apologize and admit her mistake?

Lyanna, a stunning middle-aged woman, got up from the couch and walked over to Isabella.

"I'm really sorry, Isabella. I'm Scarlett's mom, Lyanna. I apologize on her behalf. Scarlett doesn't really hang out with outsiders, so she's kinda naive and got taken in by those two bad bitches. But please believe me, she wasn't the mastermind behind this," Lyanna said, looking genuinely pained.

Isabella smirked inwardly. 'So they're blaming Scarlett's two unlucky friends? No way those two would dare do this without Scarlett's go-ahead.'

At this point, Michael stood up and said to Kenna, "Dad, Isabella didn't tell you because of the relationship between our families. She knew you and Scarlett's elders were once friends, so she didn't want to upset you. She specifically asked me not to tell you."

Kenna looked at Isabella with appreciation. "Isabella, you're so thoughtful. Michael is lucky to have married you."

Isabella blushed and replied politely, "Dad, you're too kind. It's just what I should do."

Scarlett clenched her fists tightly. The more affectionate Michael was towards Isabella, the more she hated her.

Suddenly, Scarlett noticed a stern look directed at her. She looked up to see it was Lyanna.

Lyanna was sharp. She understood that Michael bringing up the family ties was a warning to Scarlett. There were still some connections between them, but if Scarlett kept targeting Isabella, those ties would eventually break, and they'd become enemies.

"Even though Scarlett wasn't the mastermind this time, she should still be punished for her mistake. This is our way of apologizing to Isabella. I hope you can accept it," Lyanna said, handing a document to Isabella with a sincere expression.

Scarlett felt a wave of anger seeing Lyanna being so humble, and her hatred for Isabella grew even stronger.

'Why? Why would you give such a valuable thing to this bitch!' Scarlett fumed internally, instinctively reaching for her bag where she had a packet of drugs ready to frame Isabella.

Isabella looked at the document Lyanna handed over, then glanced at Michael.

Michael gave her a nod, and Isabella took the document.

"A vineyard?" Isabella was shocked. Scarlett's family was using a vineyard to apologize!

"Lyanna, this gift is too valuable. I can't accept it," Isabella quickly tried to hand the document back.

"You know it's valuable, so why won't you accept it? Quit being fake!" Scarlett snorted, thinking Isabella was just being hypocritical.

Lyanna turned to Scarlett angrily. "Shut up!"

Then she turned back to Isabella. "This is just a token of our sincerity. The vineyard isn't very large, and property prices here are quite reasonable, so it's not particularly valuable. It's just a gesture of apology. Please accept it."

Isabella had a good impression of Lyanna, but she still felt the vineyard was too much. She looked at Michael again.

Michael nodded and casually took the document. "A vineyard as an apology is quite nice. Since it's a gift from Lyanna, you should accept it."

Only then did Isabella agree to accept the document.

Lyanna let out a sigh of relief. Isabella accepting their apology meant the relationship between the two families could continue.

While Lyanna and Isabella were chatting, Scarlett stood up and said, "You guys chat. I'll go to the bathroom."

As she headed upstairs, Isabella instinctively pointed to the restroom on the first floor. "Isn't there one right here?"

Scarlett stopped in her tracks and looked coldly at Isabella. "Do you expect me to use the same bathroom as those servants? I'm not that lowly!"

With that, Scarlett continued upstairs, leaving Lyanna looking extremely embarrassed.

"I'm really sorry, Scarlett has been spoiled by me. I'll make sure to teach her a lesson later," Lyanna said with a bitter smile, cursing Scarlett in her mind.

After reaching the second floor, Scarlett didn't go to the bathroom but instead went to Michael and Isabella's room.

She quietly sneaked in and began to search through Isabella's suitcase.

It didn't take long for Scarlett to find a white suitcase. She remembered seeing Isabella carrying it when they picked her up from the airport.

Scarlett pulled a handkerchief from her pocket, then took out a bag of white powder from her handbag. She opened Isabella's suitcase and placed the bag of powder inside.

"No, if I just leave it like this, it will arouse suspicion," Scarlett muttered, frowning slightly. She took out a sharp little knife from her bag, cut open the lining of Isabella's suitcase, and slipped the bag of white powder into the slit.

'This time, I'm gonna watch you suffer firsthand,' Scarlett thought, a glint of malice flashing in her eyes.

###chapter 104 Give You a Slap

After stashing the drugs, Scarlett bolted out of the room. To make it look less suspicious, she headed to the second-floor bathroom to wash her hands.

Just then, Isabella showed up at the same bathroom.

Scarlett caught sight of Isabella in the mirror. After washing her hands, she sneered, "Well, well, look who's in the second-floor bathroom just like me. I thought you would slum it in the first-floor bathroom."

Isabella gave a faint smile, meeting Scarlett's eyes in the mirror. "I'm not here for the bathroom. I'm here for you."

Scarlett turned to face her. "What do you want? We've got nothing to talk about."

Isabella's smile vanished. "I can tell you're not here to apologize."

Scarlett scoffed, crossing her arms. "You're right, so what? You got lucky this time, you bitch! I heard two kangaroos saved you. Maybe I'll send you some kangaroo meat to try."

Seeing Scarlett's spiteful grin, Isabella slapped her hard.

"If you harm any of those animals, you'll regret it," Isabella said, her expression icy, just like Michael's when he was mad.

Scarlett felt a moment of confusion, seeing a flash of Michael in Isabella. It only made her angrier.

"You bitch, how dare you hit me?" Scarlett tried to strike back, but Isabella kicked her in the stomach, knocking her down.

Isabella bent over slightly, her gaze cold. "I might not be a survival expert, but when it comes to fighting, I ain't losing to nobody!"

Scarlett felt a sharp pain in her stomach; Isabella's kick was strong. She lay on the ground, gasping for air.

Isabella stood up, walked to the sink, and turned on the faucet. The sound of running water drowned out Scarlett's labored breathing.

"Guess what Michael told me yesterday? He said he doesn't like you at all. He only sees you as a friend. He hopes you'll get the hint, and if you mess with his marriage again, he'll make you regret it." Isabella finished washing her hands and looked at Scarlett, a mocking smile on her lips, as if laughing at Scarlett's ignorance.

If John or Bianca saw Isabella now, they'd be shocked. The old Isabella would never say such things or show such expressions.

Love had changed her. Isabella felt true love for Michael, which made her unwilling to let go. Love made her selfish, and for love, Isabella began to adopt Michael's indifference and cruelty towards his enemies.

After Isabella left, Scarlett waited for the pain to subside. She stood up, glaring in the direction Isabella had gone.

"You bitch, just wait. Tomorrow, I won't let you off! I'll make you pay a hundred times over!" Scarlett clenched her fists, adjusted her expression, and headed downstairs.

Back in the day, Scarlett would've flaunted the slap marks and put on a sad face to get Kenna's or Michael's sympathy. But now, she had a better plan and decided to bide her time.

As Scarlett came downstairs, Isabella was still chatting with Lyanna.

Isabella looked so friendly and kind while chatting. It was hard to believe she had just slapped Scarlett and kicked her in the bathroom.

"Mom, I'm feeling a bit tired. Let's go home and rest," Scarlett said to Lyanna.

Lyanna nodded but then frowned. "Scarlett, why is your face red?"

Scarlett gave a bitter smile. "I saw a little bug on my face in the bathroom. It felt itchy, so I tried to swat it away. I missed the bug but ended up slapping myself."

Lyanna believed Scarlett because she thought Scarlett wouldn't lie to her. Besides, Scarlett's personality was such that she never took things lying down. If someone had hit her, she would have fought back hard.

"Well, in that case, let's go!" Lyanna said goodbye to everyone, then took Scarlett's hand and left the villa.

"Isabella, Scarlett has shown sincerity. How about giving her a break?" Kenna smiled at Isabella.

Isabella nodded; she was willing to show Kenna some respect. As long as Scarlett didn't cause trouble for her, she wouldn't go looking for trouble with Scarlett.

"Alright, Dad. Since I was a kid, my grandpa always taught me that we should never hurt others unless they hurt us first. But if they keep hurting us, we must retaliate doubly to make them realize who's boss!" Isabella said with a smile.

Isabella was making her stance clear to Kenna. She could forgive this time, but if Scarlett dared to mess with her again, she wouldn't tolerate it.

Kenna got Isabella's point, and he didn't think there was anything wrong with it. Isabella's approach matched his own style.

"I feel like your grandpa and I have some similarities. I wonder if I'll ever get to meet him," Kenna asked with a smile.

Isabella's expression turned a bit sad. "I'm sorry, Dad, my grandpa passed away many years ago."

"Oh, that's really unfortunate," Kenna said with regret.

"It's okay, Dad. I want to go back to my room and rest for a while. It's been a tiring day," Isabella said, getting up and heading upstairs.

Kenna signaled to Michael.

Michael shrugged and followed Isabella.

"I wonder when I'll get to hold a grandchild. Is Michael even capable?" Kenna said with a tone of frustration.

Michael, who had just reached the second floor, overheard Kenna's voice, and his expression instantly darkened.

'Damn it, am I really his son? Why does he always doubt me?' Michael thought, feeling deeply frustrated. He decided to prove himself.

But when Michael walked into the bedroom, he found Isabella fiddling with the alarm clock, looking serious.

###chapter 105 Finish What We Started at the Cinema

Michael stopped in his tracks when he saw Isabella messing with the alarm clock.

"Do you think someone's been in our room?" Michael asked quietly.

Isabella nodded. "I'm sure of it. Check this out."

She pulled out her phone and showed Michael a video. As he watched, his face turned ice-cold.

"She just doesn't know when to quit, does she? If that's how she wants to play, she can't blame me for what happens next!" Michael said, reaching for his phone, but Isabella stopped him.

Michael looked at her, confused. "What are you doing? Are you going to let her off the hook because of my dad?"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Do I look like someone who would do that?"

Michael nodded. "To me, you've always been a kind person."

Isabella laughed, feeling a bit flattered but still kept a serious face. "Kind, yes. But not stupid. If I keep putting up with her crap, then I'd be an idiot!"

She leaned in and whispered her plan into Michael's ear.

A grin spread across Michael's face. "Isabella, you're getting sneaky."

Isabella rolled her eyes again and said seriously, "Look, except for my bestie Amelia, every other women I know can't stand me! I have to be tougher than them to beat them! It's all because you're too amazing!"

She reached out and touched Michael's face. "You're so handsome."

"And you're just as beautiful! I wonder if someone as amazing as you would want to have an amazing kid with me?" Michael said, stroking her face and moving in closer.

Isabella blushed. "Actually, I need to think about that. I'm still young and not ready for kids yet."

Michael paused, then realized she was joking. If she really didn't want kids soon, why didn't they ever use protection?

"Alright, no kids for now. But we can still enjoy trying." Michael suddenly lifted Isabella and tossed her onto the bed.

Isabella curled up at the head of the bed, covering herself with a blanket. She pointed at Michael, annoyed, "I've been exhausted all day. Can't you let me rest for a bit?"

Michael's lips curled into a playful smile. "You could get pregnant first. Then you'd have ten months of rest! Plus, no periods or cramps during that time."

Isabella's face turned even redder. "I told you, I don't want kids right now."

"Okay, no kids. We'll just enjoy the process. I could barely hold back at the cinema earlier, now we can finish what we started." Michael turned the alarm clock upside down on the table and then jumped onto the bed.

They quickly wrapped around each other, kissing passionately as they rolled on the bed, their clothes flying off piece by piece.

After leaving the villa, Scarlett locked herself in her room, deep in thought. She had stashed the bag of drugs in Isabella's suitcase, but now she needed a way to make sure Michael or Kenna found it.

"Should I just call and report Isabella or fake a drug history for her?" Scarlett frowned, then shook her head. That would be too obvious and raise suspicions.

Isabella was new in town and had no enemies here, except Scarlett. If Scarlett reported her, everyone would immediately suspect her.

"Wait, I could bribe their maid to open the suitcase while cleaning and pretend to accidentally find the drugs, then report it to Kenna!" Scarlett's eyes lit up. This seemed like the perfect plan.

Meanwhile, Isabella and Michael were trying out some new and exciting positions on the bed.

They were both completely naked, with Michael lying on the bed, his erection standing tall.

Isabella was crouched between Michael's legs, holding his shaft in her hand, her tongue swirling around the tip.

Since it was Isabella's first time giving a blowjob, she was a bit clumsy. But her tongue was soft and tender, which was a plus.

The sensation of her soft tongue sliding over the smooth tip sent shivers down Michael's spine. He reached out to stroke Isabella's hair.

"Isabella, this feels incredible," Michael sighed.

Isabella gave him a seductive look, her hand still stroking his shaft as she continued.

"Alright, stop licking the tip. It's too sensitive. Try somewhere else," Michael suggested.

Blushing, Isabella nodded. She let the tip slide out of her mouth and started licking along the length of his shaft, covering it with her saliva.

Isabella then moved her attention to Michael's scrotum. She gently lifted his balls with her fingers and began to lick them, then took his scrotum into her mouth, gently tugging at his testicles.

Michael moaned again, feeling the wrinkles on his scrotum smooth out. The gentle suction on his testicles created a slight, pleasurable pain.

"Isabella, stop sucking. Let's get to the main event," Michael said, stroking her hair like she was a beloved pet.

Isabella nodded. "So, what position do you want this time?"

A smile spread across Michael's face. He suddenly flipped Isabella over, positioning her on her stomach with her back to him.

Isabella's hips were raised high in the air. Michael panted heavily, squeezing her buttocks firmly with both hands before guiding his shaft to her vaginal opening.

"Isabella, I'm going in," Michael said, thrusting his thick member forcefully into her.

Isabella let out a long scream, then lowered her head, emitting soft moans from her throat.

Michael kept thrusting in that position, silently praying that this time he could successfully get Isabella pregnant, or else Kenna would think he was incapable.

###chapter 106 Annoying Mother and Daughter

Isabella's earlier scream, though muffled by the room's soundproofing, still managed to reach Kenna, who was on his way upstairs to find Michael.

Kenna's hand froze mid-air, just about to knock on the door, when he heard the sounds coming from inside.

A servant walked over and greeted Kenna out of habit.

"Mr. Williams, you..." The servant's words trailed off when he saw Kenna's intense gaze.

Under that sharp look, the servant quickly shut his mouth.

Kenna waved him off, and the servant tiptoed away, trying to be as quiet as possible.

Kenna stood at the door, listening to the faint moans from inside, a smirk forming on his lips. He then quietly left the second floor.

"Mr. Williams, do you need a snack tonight?" another servant asked as he passed by.

Kenna smiled and waved his hand, "No, I don't eat at night. Actually, bring me that bottle of fine wine from my cellar."

The servant nodded and headed to the wine cellar. Before long, he returned with a bottle of vintage red wine.

Kenna took the wine and went back to his room.

In Kenna's room, there was a table with a photo of a woman on it. She looked a lot like Michael, suggesting she was Michael's mother.

On the table were also several burning candles, a bouquet of flowers, some sugar skulls, and her favorite foods. Kenna lit an incense stick and placed it in front of the photo. The smoke curled up into the room, carrying a faint, pleasant scent.

This was his way of remembering his late wife, Audrey Carroll. He believed that even though she was no longer with them, her spirit still watched over them.

Death wasn't the end; the souls of the deceased would bless their living relatives, bringing them good fortune.

Although Kenna didn't expect Audrey to bring him good fortune, he hoped she would be waiting for him in the other world.

When the incense had burned out, Kenna sat at the table, looking at Audrey's photo and said with a smile, "Audrey, when I passed by Michael and Isabella's room tonight, I heard some noises inside. I guess they were trying to have a baby. I know it's wrong to eavesdrop, but I swear it wasn't intentional!"

A bitter smile appeared on Kenna's lips, as if he could hear Audrey scolding him.

"All these years, the only thing keeping me going was seeing Michael get married and have a kid. Once we have a grandchild, I'll raise 'em, then I'll just wait peacefully for my time to join you," Kenna said, tears streaming down his face.

"I feel like the day I become a grandfather is not far away! Such a happy day deserves a celebration." Kenna opened a bottle of his cherished wine and poured it into two glasses.

The rich aroma of the wine filled the room.

Kenna picked up one of the glasses and downed it in one gulp. Then he took the other glass and poured the wine in front of the sugar skulls on the table, symbolizing sharing the moment with Audrey.

Tears welled up in Kenna's eyes as he stared blankly at the photo, holding the glass. He murmured softly, as if speaking intimately with Audrey.

The next day, Isabella didn't stick around the villa. She missed the two kangaroos, so Michael took her to Austin's hunting ground.

The hunting ground was just like they remembered. When Isabella and Michael arrived outside the enclosure, Optimus Prime and Megatron were at it again.

The two kangaroos were going at it fiercely, kicking each other with their powerful legs.

Isabella cheered them on, even though she couldn't tell them apart. It didn't matter; she just wanted to root for them.

Michael, watching the two kangaroos, suddenly thought of bullfighting. However, in this scenario, there were no matadors, but rather two furious bulls. No one knew who would win, but it was definitely a display of raw, violent beauty.

Meanwhile, back at the villa, shortly after Isabella and Michael left the room, the maid came in to clean up.

There was an annoying suitcase in the room. The maid wanted to move it to a fixed spot before cleaning, but it suddenly fell to the ground, and a bag of white powder spilled out.

The maid was stunned to see the bag of white powder. She instinctively reached out to pick it up but stopped midway.

"This can't be what I think it is, can it? How on earth did Mr. Williams and Mrs. Williams end up with this?" Her expression turned very serious, and she quickly ran downstairs to inform Kenna.

Scarlett was at home, plotting her next move, when she suddenly got a call from Lyanna.

"What did you say? The maid at Michael's house found a package of drugs while cleaning the room! Is this true? Oh my God, this is fantastic! Mom, wait for me. I'm coming over right now." Scarlett hung up the phone, her face lighting up with excitement.

Scarlett had originally planned to bribe a maid to pretend to find drugs, but she hadn't even put her plan into action before they were discovered.

Lyanna had intended to talk to Kenna about a new business plan but unexpectedly witnessed this drama.

Scarlett joyfully drove to Michael's villa, eager to see Isabella's reaction.

Meanwhile, Michael and Isabella were at the hunting ground, watching the two kangaroos fight. Suddenly, Michael got a call from Kenna.

"Is Isabella with you? Whatever you're doing, come home right now. I have something very serious to tell you." Kenna's voice was very grim.

"Got it, we'll head back now." Michael hung up the phone and looked at Isabella beside him.

"Let's go back. Looks like our prey has taken the bait." Michael's lips curled into a mocking smile.

###chapter 107 Where Did the Drugs Come From?

When Isabella and Michael got back to the villa, they found Kenna sitting on the couch with a cane, looking pretty down.

On the other side of the couch were Scarlett and Lyanna.

Right in the middle of everyone was Isabella's white suitcase, wide open with a bag of white powder inside.

Isabella and Michael shared a quick look, their faces calm but their eyes full of mischief.

Scarlett, feeling all high and mighty, didn't catch their little exchange.

"Isabella, how could you do this? Don't you know the Williams Family hates drugs?" Scarlett scolded, arms crossed.

Isabella looked at Scarlett, puzzled. "Ms. Ramirez, I don't get what you're saying. Are you accusing me of being involved with drugs?"

Before Scarlett could answer, Lyanna pointed at the suitcase and snapped, "The evidence is right there! Are you still going to deny it? Isn't this your suitcase? The drugs were found in your suitcase. What do you have to say for yourself?"

Isabella frowned. She thought Lyanna was reasonable yesterday, but now it seemed like she was just pretending.

"Just because it's in my suitcase doesn't mean it's mine! Prove it!" Isabella sat down on the couch, crossed her arms, and stared calmly at Scarlett and Lyanna.

Michael chuckled, sat next to Isabella, and put his arm around her shoulders.

Scarlett's fists clenched at the sight of them being so close, and she thought, 'Just wait, Isabella, I'll make you pay for this!'

Scarlett pointed at the suitcase. "We don't need proof! Everyone knows Williams hates drugs more than anything! And you, some stranger, are most likely involved! Come clean - are you using or dealing? If you confess, maybe Kenna'll give you a second chance."

Kenna looked at Isabella and Michael, but their faces stayed calm.

"I thought you were a nice girl yesterday, but now it turns out you're mixed up in drugs! Michael, would you want anything to do with a drug user?" Lyanna asked Michael.

Michael shook his head seriously. "I wouldn't want a woman who uses or deals drugs-that would ruin my life."

Before Scarlett and Lyanna could celebrate, Michael continued, "But something's off. I've been with Isabella these past few days. The suitcase is from Avalonia, and I was with her when she packed. I didn't see her put any drugs in it. And even if she did, how could it be found so easily? Something's fishy about this!"

Michael finished, looking at Kenna.

Kenna's brow furrowed slightly; logically, if someone were using drugs, they would hide it discreetly.

Isabella nodded and looked at Kenna with a hint of distress. "Father, if this powder is really drugs, then I must have been framed! I have an alibi-Michael has been with me the whole time."

Kenna nodded and turned to the maid. "Tell us how you found this powder."

The maid, who had discovered the drugs, nodded and explained how she had accidentally knocked over the suitcase while cleaning the room.

Lyanna got all fired up. She stood up, pointing at Isabella, and said, "Did you hear that, Isabella? The maid has been with Kenna for over ten years. She would never betray him! Do you think she would frame you?"

Isabella's face clouded over. Lyanna reminded her of her mother, Mia-a woman who always seemed intent on pushing her to her limits.

But Scarlett didn't look as triumphant as Lyanna; she seemed puzzled.

'I hid that bag of drugs so well yesterday. There's no way it could have been found so easily! Something's off,' Scarlett thought, frowning deeply, unable to figure it out.

Michael looked at Kenna. "Dad, I also believe the maid wouldn't frame Isabella."

Kenna looked at Michael in surprise. Wasn't he always on Isabella's side? By saying this, he was going against her, implying that Isabella was indeed involved in drugs.

Scarlett's initial confusion vanished with Michael's reaction. She thought Michael was finally starting to doubt Isabella.

But before she could smile, Michael suddenly held Isabella's hand and said, "I believe Isabella has nothing to do with drugs! Since it's not the maid framing her, and no one else has touched the suitcase, it's very likely the drugs were already in the suitcase when we bought it!"

Isabella nodded earnestly. "Yeah, that could be it. The guy who sold me the suitcase looks shady."

Scarlett was taken aback by his words. She never expected him to shift the blame to the person who sold the suitcase.

"No way! Airport security is super tight! You couldn't even sneak drugs in your rectum, let alone your suitcase! So the guy who sold the suitcase couldn't have planted those drugs," Scarlett said confidently.

Lyanna nodded in agreement. If they could prove Isabella was guilty of drug possession and trafficking, Kenna would never agree to her marriage with Michael. That would give Scarlett a chance.

Isabella and Michael exchanged a glance, both smiling.

Michael stroked his chin and said, "I also believe our security wouldn't miss such an obvious way of hiding drugs. So, maybe that white powder isn't drugs at all-that's why it got past security."

"Not drugs? How could that be? It must be!" Scarlett blurted out, realizing everyone was staring at her.

Embarrassed, Scarlett quickly added, "I mean, if it's flour or starch, why would it be in such a simple, ugly package? Only drugs would have such careless packaging, right? Of course, that's just my guess."

###chapter 108 It's Flour

Scarlett almost let it slip. If she kept saying it was drugs, everyone would start wondering how she knew so much.

Scarlett's hunch wasn't totally off base. I mean, drugs don't usually come with a logo on the packaging.

Lyanna jumped in, "Isabella, just come clean! You say Michael was with you the whole time and can back up your alibi, but he couldn't exactly follow you into the ladies' room, could he?"

Michael raised an eyebrow and shook his head. "I'm a gentleman; I don't just stroll into ladies' rooms. Only women and creeps do that."

Isabella stood up from the couch, pointing angrily at Lyanna. "Why are you so sure the drugs are mine? Even if Michael can't follow me into the ladies' room, I have two female bodyguards with me! Can't they vouch for me?"

Lyanna was speechless for a moment. Those bodyguards clearly followed Michael's orders. Accusing them of taking bribes from Isabella would be like questioning Michael's judgment.

But then, Michael awkwardly pulled Isabella's hand and said, "Those two female bodyguards protecting you are from the Evernia mercenary group. They went back to Evernia this morning. If we want to call them back, it'll take some time."

Isabella frowned slightly and sat back on the couch.

Scarlett and Lyanna exchanged a glance, their eyes lighting up with excitement. If they could find those two female bodyguards first and bribe them to accuse Isabella, it would nail her for drug trafficking!

Suddenly, a strange light flashed in Scarlett's eyes as she came up with another idea.

Scarlett looked at Michael and said, "Actually, there's something I haven't told you before. I own a bar, and one day a thug came in. He got drunk and told me that a beautiful foreign woman had bought drugs from him! The woman he described looked a lot like Isabella."

Kenna frowned at Scarlett. "Are you serious?"

Scarlett nodded earnestly. "Kenna, you have to believe me. I'm not lying. I'll have my bar security look into that guy's identity and bring him here to confront Isabella."

Kenna nodded, and Scarlett immediately got up from the couch and headed for the door.

"Aren't you two going to follow and see?" Kenna looked at Isabella and Michael, his expression calm.

Kenna had somehow grasped the truth. He noticed that when they saw the white powder, both Isabella and Michael stayed remarkably calm, like they were expecting it. They must have a plan they hadn't shared with him.

"It's okay, Dad, I believe Isabella is innocent. The buyer of the drugs that guy mentioned isn't Isabella." Michael smiled at Kenna and squeezed Isabella's hand.

Isabella nodded. "Dad, please believe me."

Kenna smiled slightly, nodded at Isabella, and then lazily leaned back in the couch, ready to watch the drama unfold.

Lyanna, still hanging out in the living room, started feeling more and more uneasy as she listened to their conversation.

'What are they up to? Do they have some new trick or evidence?' Lyanna thought, her anxiety growing.

Soon, Scarlett finished her call and walked back in. She had called Bob over. offering him a nice reward to testify against Isabella, proving her drug purchases.

Bob was in a tight spot and needed money badly. If he didn't come up with tens of thousands of dollars, he was going to lose a hand.

After getting Scarlett's call, Bob immediately called a car and rushed to the villa.

"Isabella, if you're involved with drugs, come clean. Kenna might go easier on you if you admit it," Scarlett taunted Isabella.

Isabella just shook her head with a smile. "I haven't done anything wrong, so why should I confess?"

Scarlett's expression froze. "You've made your choice. Don't regret it."

Just then, a bodyguard from outside the villa walked in. "Mr. Kenna Williams, Mr. Michael Williams, Mrs. Williams, there's a young man named Bob outside who claims to be a witness."

Michael waved his hand. "Let him in."

The bodyguard soon brought Bob inside.

Isabella was momentarily stunned when she saw Bob; he looked familiar. After a moment of thought, she remembered who he was.

"You're the guy from the movie theater yesterday. You brought us drinks!" Isabella said in surprise.

Although Bob was a thug, he was indeed handsome. So Isabella took a closer look at him, leaving a deep impression.

Bob spotted Isabella, but the sight of Michael set his teeth on edge.

Scarlett stood up, looking at Bob, "Bob, tell us who bought drugs from you yesterday?"

Bob swallowed and pointed at Isabella. "This lady bought a package of drugs from me yesterday. She told me to meet in the ladies' room. I hid in the adjacent stall. When she entered the stall, I passed the drugs to her through the gap under the partition."

Isabella's face instantly darkened, and Michael's expression wasn't too good either.

Seeing Michael and Isabella's changed expressions, Kenna sighed deeply.

Isabella stared at Scarlett and said coldly, "So you've been following me since yesterday! No wonder I felt like I was being watched."

Scarlett sneered, "I have no idea what you're talking about. I have never had anyone follow you. What we need to discuss is why you bought drugs!"

Scarlett pointed to the white powder in the suitcase.

Bob chimed in loudly, "That's right. I personally gave this lady the package of white powder. I remember very clearly, it's drugs."

Isabella's face broke into a mocking smile. She crossed her arms and laughed, "But I don't think it's drugs at all. It's flour. End of story."

###chapter 109 Surveillance Footage

Isabella's words left Scarlett, Lyanna, and Bob completely stunned.

Scarlett quickly broke the silence with a laugh. "Isabella, seriously? You're still denying it? We've got witnesses right here, and you're sticking to this lie? Do you really think that's gonna help you now?"

Michael leaned back on the sofa, watching Scarlett's outburst with a faint smile, though his eyes were cold as ice.

Lyanna sensed something was off and tried to pull Scarlett back, but Scarlett was too worked up to notice.

"Kenna, did you hear Isabella? She claims this is a bag of flour! I've never seen flour packaged like this in my life!" Scarlett's face twisted into a nasty grin.

Ignoring Scarlett, Isabella turned to Kenna with a smile. "Dad, can you have someone test this powder?"

Kenna nodded and called for a bodyguard.

The bodyguard soon left the villa with a sample of the powder.

Scarlett crossed her arms and sat back on the sofa, sneering at Isabella. "Let's see how you explain yourself when the test results come back."

Isabella shot Scarlett a cold look and muttered, "Idiot."

Scarlett was fuming, but she knew she was about to win, so she held back.

About half an hour later, Kenna's phone rang. It was the bodyguard who had left earlier.

Kenna answered and put the call on speaker. "Can you repeat the test results?"

The bodyguard's voice came through loud and clear. "After professional analysis, the powder has been confirmed to be flour."

Scarlett jumped up from the sofa. "No way! It can't be flour! It has to be drugs! Did you test it wrong?"

The bodyguard's voice was firm. "Ms. Ramirez, our testing agency is very reputable. We can definitely tell the difference between drugs and flour."

"This can't be happening. It was supposed to be drugs. Why is it flour?" Scarlett muttered, panicking.

Bob, standing on the outskirts of the group, suddenly had a bad feeling. This might be the end for him.

Scarlett's eyes widened as she realized something. She glared at Isabella. "You knew, didn't you? You knew it was flour all along and just wanted to see me make a fool of myself!"

Isabella smiled faintly. "Oh, I just remembered. Yesterday, Michael and I were shopping and saw a farmer selling homemade flour but nobody was buying. We felt sorry for him, so we bought a bag. I tossed it in the suitcase and forgot about it."

Michael chuckled and ruffled Isabella's hair. "You're too kind, Isabella." Kenna looked at them and shook his head with a smile. "Well, since this was just a misunderstanding, I think an explanation should suffice."

Lyanna stood up awkwardly. "So it was a misunderstanding. I'm sorry, Isabella. I didn't expect it to turn out like this. Please don't take what I said to heart."

Isabella rolled her eyes, marveling at Lyanna's shamelessness.

"Dad, this isn't over yet!" Isabella's expression suddenly turned serious.

Scarlett raised her head, glaring at Isabella. "Isabella, what else do you want to say? Haven't you had enough fun at my expense?"

"No, no, no, this isn't over for you yet." Isabella's lips curled into a mocking smile as she pulled out a USB drive from her pocket and handed it to a nearby servant.

"Play the contents of this USB drive on the TV," Isabella instructed.

The servant took the USB drive and went to the TV to start the playback.

A sudden sense of dread washed over Scarlett. She looked at Isabella, panic creeping into her voice. "What are you trying to do?"

"What am I trying to do? You'll see soon enough," Isabella replied coldly, then leaned against Michael and watched the TV.

As the TV screen lit up, a video started playing.

When Scarlett saw the footage, she froze in place.

The video showed Isabella and Michael's room.

The timestamp on the video indicated it was recorded yesterday afternoon, the exact time when Scarlett and Lyanna came to apologize.

The door to Michael and Isabella's room opened. Scarlett sneaked in, opened Isabella's suitcase, and then pulled a bag of white powder from her handbag, placing it inside the suitcase. After completing this, she left.

At this point, the video sped up. About 20 minutes later, Isabella entered the room.

After taking a phone call in the room, Isabella went straight to her suitcase, opened it, and took out a bag of white powder.

Shortly after, the door opened again, and Michael walked in.

The video ended at this point. Everyone who watched it fell silent.

Scarlett and Lyanna were in a panicked silence, Kenna was in an angry silence, Michael and Isabella were in a mocking silence, and Bob, huddled in the corner, was in a fearful silence.

"So this is it! This is the show Isabella wanted me to see!" Kenna's suppressed anger was like a volcano about to erupt.

Scarlett paled and took a step back, nearly stumbling. She pointed at Isabella, trembling, and questioned, "This video is fake. It must be fake. Who in their right mind would install a camera in their bedroom?"

Michael's lips curled into a smile. He pulled Isabella close, gently touching her chin with one hand, and said, "We wanted to capture our intimate moments on camera. You've got a problem with that?"

Isabella blushed, feeling a mix of embarrassment and annoyance, and lightly slapped Michael's chest.

Of course, the truth was not as Michael said. Isabella had installed the hidden camera in the room just for self-protection.

###chapter 110 Punishment

Ever since Isabella ran into Scarlett's nastiness, she couldn't help but be on guard.

Even though Isabella didn't want to face it, but her enemies were getting totally vicious, like she was playing some crazy death game.

Bianca almost stole her kidney! Then her own parents tried to marry her off to John, pushing her to the edge. After that, Pearl wanted her gang-raped and left to die of some awful disease. And to top it all off, Scarlett wanted her devoured by jungle beasts.

Sometimes, Isabella just wanted to ask God what she did to deserve all this. When she liked John, she was a target. Now that she didn't like him anymore and chose to marry Michael, she was still a target.

Isabella was beyond frustrated; she really wanted to scream about this messed-up world.

There was this saying online that fate was like a relentless boxer. If you couldn't beat him, protect yourself and just hang in there. Eventually, you'd get tougher.

Installing cameras in her room was Isabella's way of protecting herself. It might seem extreme, but in critical moments, it became the most crucial evidence.

Isabella couldn't even imagine what would have happened if she hadn't installed that camera in her room, which caught Scarlett framing her.

Would anyone believe her if they found drugs in her suitcase?

Even if Isabella kept shouting that the drugs weren't hers, who would believe her, especially in a foreign country?

Only the person who framed you knew how innocent you truly were.

What comforted Isabella was that Michael had always been by her side, supporting her. Even when she suggested installing pinhole cameras in the room, he didn't object. He only turned them off during their private moments.

At this point, Scarlett was completely speechless, realizing she had walked right into Isabella's trap. The reason the servant had so easily found the drugs must have been that Isabella had tipped her off. This was a setup against her!

Kenna tapped his cane, his cold eyes fixed on Scarlett and Lyanna. "You owe me an explanation for this."

Before Scarlett could speak, Lyanna slapped her hard.

"How could you do such a thing? Last time you almost killed Ms. Taylor, and now you want to ruin her reputation? Do you really hate her that much?" Lyanna scolded, both anxious and furious. In her anger, she slapped Scarlett twice more.

Scarlett felt the sting on her face. She covered her cheeks and looked at Lyanna with some fear. "Mom, please believe me, I didn't mean for this to happen. Yesterday, when I was in the bathroom on the second floor, Isabella came in. She hit me and kicked me. I had already apologized, so why did she still treat me like that? I felt so hurt, that's why I thought of framing her."

Lyanna frowned at Isabella. "Isabella, is this true?"

Isabella almost laughed out of anger. Scarlett was indeed a master of lying. What she said was true, but she left out the exact timing.

"Ms. Ramirez, do you think I only installed a camera in my room? I also installed one in the hallway, and it just so happens that it also records both time and sound," Isabella said, causing Scarlett's face to change again.

"Because I didn't expect you to use such a method to defend yourself, I haven't yet transferred the footage from the camera outside the bathroom. But that's okay, I can have someone prepare it right now," Isabella continued, calling over a bodyguard to retrieve the surveillance footage.

"No need, I admit it. I do hate you because you took Michael, whom I've always loved!" Scarlett glared at Isabella with fierce eyes, dropping all her pretenses.

Lyanna had planned to slap Scarlett a few times to show Kenna their sincerity, and maybe lessen Scarlett's punishment. But Scarlett seemed to have found a better way.

"Kenna, you know I've grown up with Michael. I've spent more time with you than with my own parents! You even suggested to my parents that I should marry Michael! My parents have always raised me as Michael's wife! All these years, we've never stopped striving, and I believed I was his wife. But what did Michael do? He betrayed me!" Scarlett shouted at Michael through her tears.

Kenna took a deep breath, the anger in his eyes replaced by regret.

Michael stood up from the sofa, his cold gaze fixed on Scarlett. "I have always considered you a friend, and that is why I endured your presence for so long. While my father may have suggested marriage, I never consented, neither as a child nor now. I pursue only what I desire, and that includes the woman I love!"

After speaking, Michael pulled Isabella up from the sofa and held her tightly. "Isabella, tell me, how do you plan to punish Scarlett for harming you a second time?"

Isabella glared at Michael, speechless. How could she punish her? Didn't he see the regret and pity in Kenna's eyes? He must still care about the ties with Scarlett's family.

Suddenly, Michael winked at Isabella.

Isabella immediately understood Michael's intention, thinking, 'He wants me to forgive Scarlett in front of Kenna again to gain more of his favor. Guilt has its limits. Scarlett's two attempts to frame me have already tested Kenna's patience to its breaking point. Michael wants to use this incident to sever the ties between the two families!'

A smile appeared on Isabella's face. She walked over and took Kenna's arm, smiling as she said, "It's okay, Dad. I wasn't seriously hurt this time. I'm sure Scarlett's parents will deal with her fairly."

Lyanna quickly nodded in agreement. "Rest assured, I'll make sure Scarlett learns her lesson when we return. I'll ground her and put a hold on her bank accounts until she grasps the gravity of her actions."

Kenna patted Isabella's arm and sighed, shaking his head. "This is the last time. If it happens again, there will be no more ties between our families."

Lyanna's face changed instantly. She knew this was the best outcome; otherwise, Michael would definitely send Scarlett to jail.

"I'm sorry, we'll leave now," Lyanna said, pulling Scarlett away quickly.

After they left, Michael turned to Bob, who had been silent in the corner. "Almost forgot about you. Isabella, how do you plan to deal with him? Should we bury him alive?"

###chapter 111 Are You Jealous of Yourself?

Bob's legs were shaking like crazy when he heard Michael's threat to bury him alive, and he just collapsed to his knees.

"Mr. Williams, please, have mercy! I don't wanna die. Mrs. Williams, I know I messed up by framing you, but I couldn't risk going against Scarlett. I had no choice. Please, spare me," Bob begged, tears and snot making a mess of his face.

Isabella sighed, clearly exasperated. No matter how good-looking someone was, they always looked awful when they cried like that.

"Don't bother burying him alive. Just hand him over to the cops and let them handle it," Isabella said, waving her hand like she was swatting a fly.

Two bodyguards came in and dragged Bob away.

Bob's voice echoed as he was taken away. "Thank you, Mr. Williams! Thank you, Mrs. Williams! God bless you both. Thank you!"

Honestly, Bob had thought about going to prison before. He just didn't want to lose his freedom, so he never went through with it. But now, Isabella had made the choice for him. At least in prison, he'd be safe from harm.

As for the money Bob owed the mob boss, it wasn't a huge amount. The real problem was the interest. It was a lot for Bob, but just pocket change for the mob boss. He wouldn't bother killing Bob over such a small amount in prison. It wasn't worth the trouble.

After dealing with Scarlett and her mom, Kenna was wiped out. He waved his hand and headed back to his room to rest.

The living room was left with just Michael and Isabella.

"I'm really sorry, Isabella. You've had a rough time here," Michael said, holding her apologetically.

Isabella sighed. "Maybe it's a test from God. I'm used to it by now."

"Isabella, hearing you say that makes me a bit sad," Michael teased with a smile.

Isabella rolled her eyes, slapped Michael's hand away from her chest, and got up from the sofa, heading upstairs. "I've been here too long. I'm starting to miss my friends back home."

Michael raised an eyebrow. Things back home were still dangerous; Paxton was still hunting for Isabella.

'If Isabella keeps hiding abroad, people back home might think she's a coward. With her personality, she wouldn't stand for that. Looks like I need to get ready to send her back at the right time,' Michael thought, narrowing his eyes as he stood up and followed her.

In the bedroom, Isabella lay on the bed playing with her phone, and Michael lay down beside her.

This time, Michael's hand slipped behind Isabella's neck, holding her shoulder, and she leaned against his chest.

Earlier, in the living room with all the servants around, Isabella didn't want to get too cozy with Michael. But now, in the privacy of the bedroom, they were both way more relaxed.

Michael's hand started to slowly slide down Isabella's neck towards her chest, moving like a sneaky snail.

Suddenly, Isabella saw a news notification on her phone and froze. "There's going to be a tech exhibition here! John's uncle is going to be there!"

Michael's hand stopped in its tracks. He was planning to attend that tech exhibition to show off their company's latest tech to the international crowd.

"You seem pretty excited to meet John's uncle!" Michael teased.

Isabella nodded seriously. "Mr. Williams helped me a lot back home! And anyone in business knows his legendary name! People say he's super handsome and has a great physique, like a movie star."

Michael listened to her gush about him, feeling both proud and a bit annoyed.

"You seem to like Mr. Williams a lot!" Michael said, pouting.

Isabella sensed something off in his tone, picking up on the jealousy.

"I just respect him for helping me!" Isabella rolled her eyes.

Michael pulled his hand back and asked, "If you had to choose between me and him as your husband, who would you pick?"

"Of course, I'd choose you! I only feel gratitude towards him, maybe a bit of curiosity at most." Isabella looked at Michael helplessly. How could he be so jealous?

Michael pouted, still looking dissatisfied. "A lot of women fall in love out of curiosity."

"I didn't know you were so jealous! I just look up to him, that's all. You seriously think I'd do something with him or ditch you for his sake? What do you take me for?" Isabella was furious and kicked Michael off the bed.

"If you can't get over your ridiculous jealousy, then don't bother me!" Isabella said angrily, pushing Michael out of the room and slamming the door shut.

Michael looked at the closed door and sighed. He realized he might have gone too far.

Feeling frustrated, Michael scratched his head and pulled out his phone to call Benjamin in another country.

The call was quickly answered, suggesting Benjamin was already on his phone.

"Michael? What's up? Don't tell me you had another fight with Isabella?" Benjamin teased.

Michael sighed and recounted what had happened.

"Tell me, what should I do to get Isabella to forgive me?" Michael asked, noticing Benjamin had gone silent on the other end.

Michael frowned and asked, "Are you still there? Answer me."

Laughter erupted from the other end. "My God, you're jealous of yourself! This has to be the funniest joke of the year! I wish I could open your skull and see what's inside!"

Michael's face darkened from being mocked. "If you keep laughing, when I return, I'll crack open your skull to check out its design."

Benjamin coughed twice, finally holding back his laughter.

###chapter 112 Lucas's Request

On the other end of the phone, Benjamin thought for a moment and came up with a good idea.

"It's perfectly normal for a man to feel jealous if his wife admires another man. Isabella is only angry because you keep harping on it! It makes her feel like you don't trust her," Benjamin analyzed.

Michael frowned, thinking for a moment, and then asked, "So you're telling me I should get into her hobbies and perhaps even root for Mr. Williams like she does."

Benjamin suddenly erupted in laughter, finding the scene so ridiculous it felt like a spoof from a comedy movie. "Root for yourself? No, that would be ridiculous. Seriously, don't do that. If it backfires, Isabella will think you're mocking her. The best approach is to apologize tomorrow and admit you shouldn't be jealous of a man who poses no threat to you," Benjamin suggested, still chuckling.

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Is it really that simple? Just a straightforward apology, no need for gifts?"

Benjamin replied, "Absolutely not necessary. You two are still in the honeymoon phase. During this time, couples tend to forgive each other easily. Just be sincere in your apology. If needed, you could even shed a few tears to plead for forgiveness. That's a popular way to apologize among young people these days."

Michael couldn't help but imagine himself clinging to Isabella, crying and begging for forgiveness.

He shuddered and made a face of disgust. "That idea makes me look foolish."

Benjamin shrugged on the other end of the line, teasing, "Well, it's the only way I can think of. Whether you believe it or not is up to you."

Michael took a deep breath. He could do it. As long as he could win Isabella back, crying wasn't a big deal, especially if no one else saw it.

"By the way, have you tried this method on Amelia?" Michael suddenly asked.

There was silence on the other end of the line.

After a while, Benjamin spoke, "I haven't confessed to her yet. We're not in any kind of relationship. At most, we're just friends."

"Friends who've slept together? Benjamin, psychological studies show that men and women who've slept together can't just be friends," Michael teased.

Benjamin sighed. "I feel like she's been avoiding me, but it's okay. I'll find the right moment to confess to her."

Michael's mouth twitched. He suddenly wondered if seeking relationship advice from Benjamin was a mistake, given that Benjamin couldn't even handle his own relationship well.

"Is Benjamin experimenting with his dating techniques on me?" Michael muttered under his breath.

"Alright, Michael, I have to go now. Looking forward to your return. I need to head into surgery. Goodbye," Benjamin said, hanging up the phone.

Michael put his phone back in his pocket and looked at the closed door in front of him. He raised his hand to knock but sighed and lowered it, letting out a deep breath.

Deciding to practice his apology face, Michael mistook the room's floor-to-ceiling coat rack for Isabella, then hugged the rack and his face pressed against it.

"I'm sorry darling, I was wrong to be jealous of a man who is no threat to me."

Michael mobilized the muscles and in his face did his best to put on a crying expression. He sounded like a child asking his mom for candy.

Suddenly, Michael heard a ringing behind him. He quickly turned around to find Kenna staring at him blankly, with a phone lying at his feet.

"You're apologizing to the hanger?" Kenna asked, surprised.

Michael awkwardly replied, "I just felt a bit hot in the face and wanted to cool down... Dad, what do you need?"

Kenna noticed Michael changing the subject but decided not to press it.

He picked up his phone from the floor and said, "There's something going on at the company that needs your urgent attention."

"Got it, I'll head over now."

Michael immediately ran out of the room, all wanted to now was to get out of this awkward place.

Kenna chuckled as he shook his head after Michael left. "My son's way of apologizing to his wife is just like mine."

By the next day, Isabella's anger from the previous night had mostly dissipated. She was waiting for Michael's apology, but he suddenly said he had to handle some matters at Kenna's company, leaving Isabella alone in the villa.

'I really want to see that tech exhibition. I wonder what Mr. Williams looks like. Is he as handsome as they say? Who's more handsome, him or Michael?' Isabella mused as she lay on the bed, scrolling through her phone out of boredom.

To enter the tech exhibition, one needed an invitation, but Isabella didn't have one. It seemed she would miss another chance to visit her idol.

Just then, a maid came up and knocked on the door. "Mrs. Williams, Mr. Ramirez is here to see you."

Isabella sat up, thinking she had misheard. 

Lucas was Scarlett's brother, and since she and Scarlett were now enemies, why would Lucas come to see her? Could it be that he wanted her to plead for Scarlett?

Isabella frowned slightly but didn't refuse. After all, this was Michael's house, and she wasn't worried about Lucas doing anything to her.

When Isabella came downstairs, Lucas was already sitting in the living room. He looked delighted to see her.

"Isabella, I need your help," Lucas said excitedly.

Isabella sat on the sofa opposite Lucas, her expression cold. "If you're here to plead for Scarlett, you can leave."

Lucas was taken aback and quickly shook his head. "You've got it all wrong. I'm not here for Scarlett. She's been grounded. In fact, I should thank you because now I don't have to listen to her nagging and bossing me around. To me, you and Michael are the real couple."

Isabella looked at Lucas in surprise. He and Scarlett seemed like two extremes-one was sinister and ruthless, the other naive and endearing.

Isabella's expression softened as she asked, "So, what do you need from me?"

Lucas immediately picked up a tablet from the table and handed it to her. "I heard from Michael that you're great at packaging design. This is my favorite car, and I hope you could help me design some cool graphics to put on it. That way, I'll be the coolest among my friends!"

Isabella raised an eyebrow at the sleek, white sports car on the screen. She hadn't expected Lucas to come to her for this reason.

Designing a car's exterior came easily to Isabella. She was about to agree when she remembered Lucas's interest in technological inventions. Maybe he had an invitation to the tech exhibition?

Isabella smiled and said, "I can help you, but you need to get me an invitation to the tech exhibition."

"That's a piece of cake. I can take you in even without an invitation!" Lucas said, then suddenly froze, realizing there might be someone at the exhibition Isabella should not encounter.

###chapter 113 Lucas's Plan

Lucas felt a twinge of regret as something important suddenly hit him.

Before Michael and Isabella came to this country, Michael had warned Lucas not to reveal his true identity. Michael was pretending to be the son of a regular businessman here, which meant he wasn't supposed to attend this tech exhibition.

Lucas asked cautiously, "Isabella, why do you want to go to the tech exhibition?"

Isabella initially wanted to spill her real reason, but remembering Michael's jealousy, she decided to switch up her story.

"I want to check out the design of those tech products. It would be super helpful for my future career," Isabella said with a smile. As a designer, this explanation made perfect sense.

Lucas frowned a bit. If that was all she wanted, he could probably swing it.

Seeing Lucas's expression change, Isabella frowned and asked, "Is this a problem for you? You just promised me. Are you going to back out?"

Lucas scratched his head awkwardly. He didn't want to piss off Michael but he really wanted Isabella's help with designing his car's look.

Suddenly, Lucas slapped his thigh as an idea hit him. "Isabella, all the invitations have already been handed out, so I can't get you a new one. But I can sneak you in. However, you can only stay until 3 PM, because after that, security will start checking invitations."

Isabella frowned. "Why such a weird rule?"

Lucas shrugged. "It's a special rule to deal with industrial espionage. You have to follow it, or we'll both get kicked out."

Isabella nodded. If that was the case, she could roll with it.

A smile spread across Lucas's face. In reality, there was no such rule at the exhibition. He wanted Isabella to leave by 3 PM because that was when Michael would be giving a speech. As long as Isabella didn't see Michael, he wouldn't be breaking his promise.

After hashing out the details, Lucas drove Isabella to the tech exhibition.

Once inside, they found the place packed with tech enthusiasts.

The tech products on display included both items for sale and concept prototypes designed to attract investors for mass production.

Isabella carried a pen and notebook, preferring to jot down her observations. She walked up to various products, noting down their packaging designs and trying to reverse-engineer the concepts behind them to draw inspiration.

Lucas stuck by Isabella at first to avoid any surprise run-ins with Michael.

However, Lucas soon got drawn in by the innovative concept prototypes. The one that caught his eye the most was a concept maglev car. Its futuristic, mech-inspired design lines sparked a strong interest in him.

Guys, at heart, stayed young forever. The appeal of a mech was irresistible. Not even a scantily clad woman could rival it.

Isabella was so focused on product designs that she lost track of time. Soon it was 3 PM. Lucas, equally engrossed, had also forgotten about the plan.

The exhibition hall was massive, and eventually, Isabella and Lucas got separated. She wandered into a new section.

Recognizing the company logo on the booth, Isabella realized it was John's uncle's company. She decided to wait for his appearance, not knowing that John's uncle was actually Michael.

Behind the booth, Jerry was adjusting his suit. He was one of the product presenters. Just as he was about to step out, he quickly retreated, looking alarmed.

Standing behind him was Michael, who frowned at his reaction.

"What are you doing? Get out there!" Michael said impatiently.

Jerry nervously pointed towards the booth. "Mr. Williams, I can't. I saw Mrs. Williams standing in front of the booth!"

Michael's heart skipped a beat. He hid behind Jerry and peeked out, only to be shocked.

"Damn it, why is Isabella here? Who the hell let her in?" Michael angrily clenched his fists.

"Mr. Williams, what should we do? It's time for your presentation," Jerry said anxiously, checking his watch.

Michael frowned, feeling equally flustered. This new tech product showcase was crucial for their company.

Suddenly, Michael glanced at their new product and seemed to get an idea. He whispered something in Jerry's ear, making Jerry's eyes widen.

"Mr. Williams, are you sure about this?" Jerry asked hesitantly.

Michael pushed him out. "Stop talking and do as I say!"

Jerry nodded, took a deep breath, and put on a mask before heading to the booth.

Meanwhile, Michael instructed the staff, "Put this new product on me, quickly!"

Standing in front of the booth, Isabella held her notebook and frowned at the man before her.

This man was Jerry, now wearing a mask.

Since Isabella hadn't interacted much with Jerry, only catching glimpses of him with Michael a couple of times, she didn't realize it was him behind the mask, even though he looked kind of familiar.

'Wasn't John's uncle supposed to be here? Why hasn't he shown up?' Isabella wondered, craning her neck to look behind the booth. Suddenly, a man dressed in black protective gear and wearing a black helmet stepped out.

Michael looked like a futuristic soldier as he stepped towards the booth.

Jerry, holding a microphone, gestured towards Michael and announced loudly, "This is our new tech protective gear! To demonstrate its protective capabilities, our company's president will personally showcase it!"

The crowd around the booth cheered and applauded.

Isabella's mouth twitched, and she thought, 'How am I supposed to know what your president looks like if he's wrapped like that?'

At that moment, Lucas, who had been engrossed in the levitation car, suddenly remembered his plan. Checking his watch, he was horrified.

"Damn it, it's already 3:10. Isabella might have already met Michael!" Lucas's voice trembled with fear as he rushed towards the booth.

###chapter 114 Do You Enjoy Hacking at Me?

When Lucas got to the booth, he saw Isabella totally absorbed in the performance on stage.

"Isabella, we gotta go. Security's gonna check the invites soon. We need to bounce," Lucas said, grabbing her hand. But she yanked it back.

"Hold up, I wanna finish watching this. I don't care if we get kicked out," Isabella said, pointing at the stage, all excited.

Lucas glanced at the stage and was instantly hooked. "Whoa, that exoskeleton armor is sick!"

On stage, Michael looked like a futuristic soldier in black exoskeleton armor, with Jerry next to him holding a sharp military knife.

"This is our new lightweight exoskeleton armor for soldiers. It's got amazing protection. We made it for urban defense. Imagine our counter-terrorism units in this armor; it would seriously boost their safety," Jerry explained, then struck Michael's chest with the knife.

The knife hit the armor with a dull thud, but Michael didn't even flinch.

"Check it out! This is a sharp military knife. Our tests show it can even stop small-caliber bullets without hurting the wearer," Jerry told the crowd, all pumped up.

The audience was totally into the gear.

No one could resist the draw of exoskeleton armor.

Lucas yelled, "You didn't hit hard enough. How do we know you're not bluffing? Go all out!"

Jerry hesitated, then glanced at Michael.

Michael noticed Lucas and Isabella together and quickly figured out Lucas had brought her in.

Michael nodded, signaling Jerry to go harder.

Jerry took a deep breath, excitement flashing in his eyes, and started hacking at Michael with the knife.

'This is my one shot to hit Michael! And he even has to thank me for it!' Jerry thought, getting more excited with each strike, his mind going a bit wild.

The crowd was stunned, jaws dropping. Everyone could see Jerry was giving it his all.

Even though Jerry's face was partly covered by a mask, the exposed parts, like behind his ears, were red-clearly super excited.

Michael swayed a bit, staring at Jerry through his helmet visor. Even though Jerry couldn't really hurt him, it felt like Jerry was taking out his frustrations on him.

After over three minutes of nonstop striking, Jerry finally got tired. He clutched his waist, panting hard, and signaled to the staff by the stage.

"Come on, everyone. Let's beat our boss up!" Jerry joked, but the staff's eyes lit up with excitement.

Some grabbed chairs, others held pens, and a few even took off their high heels.

Just like Jerry thought, this was their one chance to beat up Michael without getting in trouble!

The staff took out all their overtime and work frustrations on Michael.

Michael swayed like a reed in the wind. He wasn't hurt, but he was super annoyed.

'Damn you, Jerry. Just wait!' Michael fumed.

"I wanna play too! I wanna play too!" Lucas's eyes lit up with excitement as he jumped on stage, grabbed the military knife from Jerry, and started striking at Michael.

"This armor is awesome! How much does it cost?" Lucas asked while hitting him.

With Lucas leading the way, the crowd rushed the stage, joining in on the attack.

Even Isabella got into it. She snuck in a couple of kicks at Michael when the crowd was thick, aiming for his groin.

"Oh my god, he's even got protection there. My foot hurts," Isabella said, her face lighting up with excitement.

Michael was beyond frustrated. If it weren't for the groin protection, he might never be able to have sex with Isabella again.

After his initial excitement, Jerry realized things were getting out of hand. He quickly worked with the staff and security to push the crowd back and restore order.

Michael finally managed to get up from the ground.

Seeing the security, Isabella thought they were coming to check invitations, so she quietly slipped away. Meanwhile, Lucas was still on stage, excitedly holding the military knife, wanting to strike a couple more times.

Michael noticed Isabella had left. As Lucas was about to strike him again, he grabbed the knife from Lucas's hand.

Michael then lifted his helmet's visor, revealing a stern face. "You enjoyed hacking at me, didn't you? You struck me 46 times, and I remember every single one!"

Lucas's face turned pale when he saw it was Michael behind the mask.

"Michael, it's you? You actually demonstrated the product yourself!" Lucas said, his legs trembling. He had just been striking the one person he never wanted to cross.

A sinister smile appeared on Michael's face as he signaled for the staff to bring up the second exoskeleton armor.

"Ladies and gentlemen! Let's give a round of applause to this gentleman for bravely stepping up as the second tester of our latest product! He will now don our protective gear and withstand everyone's assaults!" Michael announced to the crowd, then put the exoskeleton armor on Lucas as he watched in horror.

After Lucas was suited up, Michael patted his shoulder and whispered in his ear, "What you're wearing isn't the finished product like mine, but an early prototype! Enjoy!"

Lucas's legs shook with fear. He turned to run but was blocked by a group of excited people, all holding weapons.

"Stay away from me! Help! I need help!" Lucas screamed as he fell to the ground. Then, baseball bats, knives, rocks, and beer bottles rained down on him.

###chapter 115 Michael's Apology

After wrapping up his presentation at the tech expo, Michael headed back to the villa.

Lucas, poor guy, had gotten a serious beatdown. Why? Well, during the scuffle, he took off his helmet and started mouthing off to a woman. The formidable 280-pound woman then pinned him down and slapped him silly.

Lucas took off his helmet for a simple reason: the woman had kissed him! Even though it was just the helmet she kissed, Lucas was seriously freaked out.

When Michael got back to the villa, Isabella was deep into designing a sports car.

"Thinking about getting a sports car?" Michael asked, curious, as he walked over. He glanced at the design and frowned a bit, thinking it didn't quite fit a woman's style.

Without looking up, Isabella kept sketching. "Lucas asked me to design a car for him. I'm using stuff young people like: shooting stars and wild horses. A meteor in the sky, a galloping horse on the ground, surrounded by flames-this sense of freedom should appeal to him."

Seeing Isabella so into designing a car for Lucas made Michael feel a bit jealous.

Michael plopped down next to Isabella, put his arm around her shoulder, and said playfully, "I want one like this too."

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Our car is just a regular sedan; it doesn't need such a design."

"I can buy a sports car, or I can save the design on my computer and get it when I have enough money," Michael said, holding Isabella's arm and rubbing his forehead against it.

Isabella had never seen the usually cool Michael act so childishly. She found it funny but didn't show it. "I went to the tech expo today and met the mysterious Mr. Williams. Are you mad?"

Michael paused, remembering Benjamin's advice.

'Beg her for forgiveness, do whatever it takes.' Michael kept telling himself.

Finally, Michael made up his mind. He squatted down, hugged Isabella's legs, and rubbed his face against them.

Isabella was startled. "What are you doing? Get up!"

"I'm sorry. I was wrong. I won't get up unless you forgive me!" Michael clung tightly to Isabella's legs, not giving her a chance to push him away.

"Get up! There are servants around; this is so embarrassing." Isabella's face turned red. They were in the living room, and the servants were cleaning nearby.

Michael waved his hand, and the servants all scattered, leaving him and Isabella alone in the living room.

"Now no one will disturb us. Isabella, I know I was wrong. I shouldn't be jealous of Mr. Williams, whom you've never even met. I should have been more understanding. Everyone has idols, even if that idol is of the opposite sex!" Michael looked up at Isabella with a pitiful expression.

Isabella's face turned bright red. She found Michael's behavior hilarious but tried hard to keep a stern look, though she couldn't help but smile a bit.

"Alright, I forgive you. Now get up," Isabella said, patting Michael's hair. He looked like a pouting kitten.

But Michael still didn't budge. "I won't get up unless you agree to design a sports car for me too."

"Okay, I'll design one for you. Just get up," Isabella said, covering her face. She felt Michael's behavior was incredibly embarrassing, but she also felt a hint of sweetness inside.

Michael finally smiled happily. Just as he was about to stand up, they heard the sound of a camera shutter.

Michael and Isabella turned around to see Kenna holding a phone, snapping photos of them.

"Isabella, you're amazing! This is the first time I've seen Michael with such an expression! Hahaha," Kenna said excitedly.

"Dad, delete those photos! You'll ruin my image!" Michael chased after Kenna, while Isabella, blushing, ran upstairs.

Michael didn't catch Kenna, who had already locked himself in his room.

Kenna stood before Audrey's photo, skillfully lighting a candle.

"Audrey, Michael has really changed a lot! He's completely devoted to Isabella, and I believe their love will soon bring a new life into the world," Kenna said happily to Audrey's photo.

Meanwhile, Lucas returned home and ran into Scarlett coming down the stairs.

Scarlett frowned as she saw the bruises on Lucas's face. "Who did this to you?"

"It was a bunch of strangers," Lucas said, waving his hand dismissively as he headed to his room. He didn't want to admit he'd been beaten up by a woman.

"Where were your bodyguards? How on earth did you get beaten up by strangers? What happened? Weren't you at the tech exhibition today?" Scarlett demanded, glaring at Lucas.

Lucas, feeling helpless, recounted how he had gone to find Isabella and how they ended up going to the tech exhibition together.

Scarlett was furious. "You went to find Isabella! Don't you know she's our enemy? She hurt me deeply! I'm your sister!"

Lucas felt exasperated. He had expected this reaction from Scarlett.

"Scarlett, you need to face reality! If you can't have Michael, let him go. "Look at the stuff you've been up to lately-none of it's worth praising. I think you should read some books on the philosophy of love; maybe they'll give you some answers," Lucas said before heading back to his room.

Scarlett, in a fit of rage, grabbed a cushion from the sofa and threw it at Lucas, but it bounced off the closed door.

Scarlett's screams echoed through the living room.

The next day, Isabella and Michael were preparing to leave the country and return home. They had work to do in Avalonia.

Upon learning the news of Isabella's departure, Lucas brought a gift to see them off.

Isabella gave Lucas the car design she had created, which he liked very much.

"This is fantastic! I'll surely be the talk of the town among my friends!" Lucas said happily, handing Isabella a rectangular box.

"This is from Scarlett. I don't know what's inside. She asked me to apologize on her behalf," Lucas said.

###chapter 116 Suspicions and Speculations

Isabella gave the box a little shake. She was about to hop on a plane and didn't have time to peek inside. She just hoped it would get through security without a hitch. If it didn't, well, that would be Scarlett's problem.

When the box sailed through security without a fuss, Isabella breathed a sigh of relief. At least it wasn't packed with anything crazy like explosives or drugs.

As Isabella and Michael boarded the plane, Amelia and Benjamin got the news.

"I'm going to pick up Isabella. Want to come with me?" Amelia asked Benjamin over the phone.

Benjamin, who had just wrapped up a surgery and was yawning, was all for it. "Sure, I'll swing by and get you when they're about to land."

Amelia, a bit annoyed, replied, "I think I should drive. You're practically sleepwalking; I don't want to die."

"They're not landing right now. I've got time for a nap while they're flying," Benjamin said, rolling his eyes before hanging up. 

Apart from those two, Isabella had also given Mason a heads-up that she was returning.

Mason immediately called John into the room. "Isabella's coming back. Get some bodyguards to pick her up so the Browns don't catch wind of it."

John nodded but then added, "By the way, Grandpa, Michael's also coming back tomorrow. Should we pick him up too?"

Mason went quiet for a moment, his eyes narrowing as he looked at John. "They're both coming back on the same day. Does that make you think of anything?"

John blinked, and then suddenly his eyes went wide in shock.

Mason thought John had figured something out, but to his surprise, John said, "Is Isabella coming back with Michael to use his bodyguards for protection? When did she get so sneaky?"

Mason was so mad his hands shook. He wanted to grab his cane and knock some sense into John's head.

"Forget it. Just do what I said," Mason said, waving John off.

John scratched his head, still confused, but went off to make the arrangements.

After John left, Mason sat on the sofa and let out a long sigh. "I hope their relationship isn't what I think it is."

After making the arrangements, John headed to the hospital to let Bianca know about Isabella's return.

"Isabella has the nerve to show her face again! She almost got us killed. When she returns, I'll make sure she learns her lesson!" Jasper angrily pounded the hospital bed.

Because of Isabella, Jasper and Mia were almost buried alive by Paxton. They now saw Isabella as their enemy.

"Jasper, Mia, don't think like that. Isabella had no choice but to flee abroad. Maybe she's coming back to confess everything to the Browns. I believe she can handle it," Bianca said with a gentle smile, though her thoughts were far from kind.

'That wretched woman, Isabella, is coming back. If that lunatic Paxton discovers it, she won't see the light of another day,' Bianca thought with malice.

Late at night, outside the ICU, Paxton stood with a pained expression, looking at Pearl inside. A subordinate came to report that someone had tipped them off that Isabella would soon return.

"This time, we must catch her!" Paxton said coldly.

After a flight of over ten hours, Isabella and Michael finally disembarked.

"Life abroad was nice, but I still prefer this city," Isabella said apologetically, holding onto Michael's arm.

Michael smiled at Isabella but kept his eyes on the people around the airport.

Not far away, a bodyguard disguised as a passenger nodded at Michael.

Michael led Isabella to the parking lot, found a car, and they got in.

"When did you arrange for a car? Weren't we supposed to wait for Benjamin and Amelia to pick us up?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

Michael pointed at his watch with a smile. "We arrived an hour earlier than planned. Do you really want to wait at the airport for them?"

Isabella nodded and sent a message to Amelia, telling them not to come.

As Isabella and Michael left the airport, several cars followed them.

Michael's ear twitched slightly; he had a Bluetooth earpiece in. His subordinate reported that everything was normal.

An hour later, another plane landed at the airport. A couple dressed similarly to Isabella and Michael emerged.

They got into a taxi and left the airport, followed by several cars filled with Brown Family's men.

This was all part of Michael's plan. He knew Isabella's return would be leaked. At Seraphim's airport, he used some privileges to get tickets for a faster flight, avoiding the Brown family's tracking.

Meanwhile, Amelia and Benjamin received Isabella's message.

"How did they get here so fast? I thought they wouldn't arrive for another hour," Amelia said, putting down her phone and looking at Benjamin in confusion.

Benjamin had a hunch about Michael's plan. "Someone must have leaked Isabella's whereabouts, so they returned early to avoid being tracked."

Amelia found it unlikely. "Isabella only informed us and Mason about her return. We wouldn't leak it, and Mason wouldn't either. So how could it have been leaked?"

Benjamin looked at Amelia and said, "John, Bianca."

Amelia froze for a moment, then exploded. "Those two idiots! They blabbed to Paxton about Isabella's return! I can't believe it! Those bastards are in for it now!"

###chapter 117 Warning to Some People

Benjamin felt a bit helpless hearing Amelia's words.

"Can you try not to be so impulsive? I'm just making a guess. John probably wouldn't dare betray the Williams Family. I think he might've told Bianca about Isabella's return, and then Bianca passed the info to the Brown Family. But it's all just speculation," Benjamin said, trying to calm Amelia down.

Amelia immediately called Isabella to check on her.

Isabella picked up pretty quickly.

"What's up, Amelia? Something wrong?" Isabella asked, sounding puzzled.

Amelia felt a wave of relief hearing Isabella's calm voice. "I was worried you might be targeted by the Browns."

She quickly filled Isabella in on Benjamin's suspicions.

Isabella's expression darkened. "I get it. Tell Benjamin thanks. He's probably right. Bianca's totally capable of something like that."

After thanking Benjamin, Isabella hung up and looked at Michael, who was driving. "You probably heard what Amelia said. I think we got lucky. Since our flight arrived early, we might've dodged a potential chase."

Michael nodded, already suspecting as much.

"Where to next? Head straight to the villa?" Michael asked, glancing at Isabella.

Isabella sighed and ran her fingers through her hair. "I originally wanted to visit Mason, but considering there might be Brown Family spies within the Williams Family, I'd better not. I'll call him later. While the Browns are still in the dark about our return, take me to my old place first. I need to pack my things so we can move to the villa."

Michael nodded and drove Isabella to her previous residence.

They were surprised to find someone already there when they arrived.

Jasper, Mia, and Bianca were all taken aback when they saw Isabella and Michael.

"Why are you back now? Weren't you supposed to return an hour later?" Jasper blurted out, making Isabella frown deeply.

"So, all three of you knew I was coming back," Isabella said with a cold smile.

After nearly being buried alive last time, Jasper and Mia were too scared to stay in the villa. It was so spacious that if something happened, no one would hear their cries for help.

Following Bianca's suggestion, they moved into Isabella's apartment. The building had many neighbors, and with the security personnel John arranged, they felt much safer.

Isabella glanced around the apartment and saw that it was a mess. Her belongings were all thrown into a shabby cardboard box and carelessly left in a corner.

Isabella smiled at the sight of the box. At least she wouldn't have to pack herself.

"Isabella, was it you who harmed Pearl? If it was, you should apologize to Paxton. If you confess, they might forgive you," Bianca pleaded, looking at Isabella. Isabella shot Bianca a cold look. "Do you really think I have that kind of power? If I did, it wouldn't just be Pearl in the hospital, but you too! Do you really think some pathetic notion of family would stop me from coming after you?"

Bianca's face went pale. She'd seen Pearl's condition and had nightmares for nights. She'd almost killed Isabella before. If Isabella truly had such power, Bianca wouldn't be standing here now.

"How can you talk to Bianca like that? You're insane. You need to go to the Brown Family and cooperate with their investigation right now!" Jasper rushed at Isabella, raising his hand to strike.

Isabella stood her ground, knowing Michael would step in.

As expected, Michael grabbed Jasper's hand, his expression icy. "I've had enough of you idiots!"

Jasper was intimidated by Michael's imposing presence. Mia immediately rushed forward, pointing at Michael and accusing, "Was it you who did that to Pearl? I've always thought you looked like a thug. You're likely the kind of weirdo who'd do something like that!"

Michael ignored them and looked at Isabella. "Are you sure you want to go through with this?"

Isabella nodded. "Let's stick to our plan."

Bianca felt a sense of dread. The same feeling washed over Jasper and Mia.

"What are you going to do to us? We're your parents!" Mia's face turned white as she hid behind Jasper.

Isabella smiled at them, her eyes cold. "Don't you feel unsafe staying outside? I've found a very safe place for you."

At that moment, a group of uniformed individuals entered the room.

The leader showed his badge and said, "We're from the tax department. Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor, your company is involved in tax evasion. Please come with us."

Jasper and Mia were taken away by the tax officials. On their way out, they kept shouting that Isabella was despicable and that they should have thrown her in the trash when she was a child.

Isabella's expression remained unchanged as she looked coldly at Bianca.

Bianca's hands clenched into fists, and she said fiercely, "I haven't done anything illegal! Even if you send me to jail, John will get me out!"

Isabella clapped her hands. "You're right. That idiot John is so whipped by you that he'll do anything you say. That's why I need to find someone else to help."

Isabella smiled and then shoved a bank card in Bianca's hand. "You broke into my house, moved in without my permission, and stole my bank card. That all adds up to a call to the police, right?"

Bianca panicked and tried to throw away the card, but Isabella grabbed her hand, forcing her to hold onto it.

###chapter 118 Plan for Paxton

An hour later, Bianca showed up at the police station, bawling her eyes out, claiming she was set up. But Isabella had already handed over a ton of evidence, including statements from the neighbors.

Bianca quickly called John, hoping he'd bail her out.

But Isabella was one step ahead and had already looped in Mason.

When Mason found out John had tipped off Bianca about Isabella's return, causing the info to leak, he lost it. He whacked John with his cane and told him to stay out of Bianca's mess, threatening to kick him out of the family if he didn't listen.

John, knowing he couldn't go against Mason, had to suck it up and let Bianca sit in jail for a bit.

After packing her stuff, Isabella moved into a new villa with Michael. Hardly anyone knew about this place, making it a good hideout from Paxton for now.

When Benjamin and Amelia heard the news, they came over to the villa too.

Amelia helped Isabella unpack while Benjamin chatted with Michael downstairs.

"So, what's the plan? Paxton's not gonna let Isabella off easy," Benjamin said, looking worried.

Michael stayed cool. "It's just Paxton. I can handle him."

Just as he said that, Michael's phone rang.

"Got it," Michael said into the phone before hanging up.

Benjamin noticed the serious look on Michael's face and quickly asked, "What's up?"

Michael replied calmly, "The decoy I used to throw off the Brown crew just called. They led them into a trap and caught them. They found guns on them. Paxton was planning to kill Isabella."

"Paxton's nuts. What are you gonna do?" Benjamin asked, concerned.

Michael smirked. "Paxton might be the head of the Brown family and the CEO of the Brown Group, but that doesn't mean all the execs are on his side."

Benjamin got the hint right away.

Sure, Paxton might use the family's resources to get back at Pearl, but the other family members wouldn't let him use everything for his vendetta. They had their own interests to protect, and Paxton was stepping on their toes.

"Since you've got a plan, I'll relax. By the way, did you apologize to Isabella? Did she forgive you?" Benjamin asked, curious.

Michael nodded, a happy grin spreading across his face. "Yeah, things are looking up. Our relationship's moving forward."

Michael then looked at Benjamin. "But I'm more worried about you and Amelia. Seems like you guys aren't making any progress."

A brief, bitter smile crossed Benjamin's face before he quickly covered it with a confident grin. "Don't worry about me. I've even given you advice on your love life. I've got my own ways with Amelia!"

Michael chuckled, giving Benjamin a friendly pat on the shoulder. "Good luck, man. If you hit any roadblocks, come to me. I've got more hands-on experience than you."

Upstairs, Amelia and Isabella were wrapping up their unpacking and started chatting.

"So, how far have you two gone? Have you slept together yet? When are you planning to have kids? What's your favorite position?" Amelia asked, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.

Isabella's face turned beet red. She playfully swatted Amelia's butt. "Can you stop with the personal questions? You're making me blush!"

Amelia shrugged. "Alright, maybe I shouldn't pry. Let's switch topics. What did you bring me from your trip?"

Isabella opened her suitcase and pulled out a beautifully wrapped phone. "I won this at a tech expo. There was a raffle, and I hit the jackpot-30 of the latest phones."

Amelia's eyes widened. "30 phones? Wow, the organizers must be loaded! And these are the top models, right?"

Isabella nodded, still a bit puzzled. "Yeah, I don't know how I got so lucky. But hey, they were free. I'll give you one, and the rest are going to my coworkers tomorrow."

Amelia gave Isabella a thumbs up. "If I was into design, I'd want to work for you. You're going to be an awesome boss."

After the compliment, Amelia noticed a rectangular box in the suitcase.

"What's in that box? Another gift?" Amelia asked, picking it up.

Isabella remembered it was a gift from Scarlett, delivered by Lucas.

"This is from a rival," Isabella said, opening the box and explaining her history with Scarlett. She left out the part about Scarlett trying to kill her, just mentioning the framing and attempts to steal Michael.

Inside the box was a photo album filled with pictures of Michael as a child, with Scarlett in every shot.

"That witch Scarlett is clearly trying to mess with you!" Amelia fumed.

But Isabella wasn't too bothered; she found it amusing. "Even though I didn't see Michael grow up, he's mine now, isn't he?"

Despite her smile, Isabella felt the need to respond to Scarlett.

She ran downstairs, found Michael chatting with Benjamin, and suddenly kissed him on the lips, snapping a photo with her phone.

Michael was caught off guard by the kiss.

"Michael, you guys keep chatting. I'm heading back to the room," Isabella said with a grin, heading back upstairs.

Meanwhile, in another country, Scarlett received a message. It was a photo of Isabella and Michael kissing, with a caption: "Thank you for being there for my husband Michael as he grew up."

###chapter 119 Dissatisfaction of the Browns

Lucas was showing off pictures of his car design to his friends when he heard a scream coming from Scarlett's room.

Annoyed, Lucas put on his headphones to drown out the noise.

"A jealous woman in love is seriously scary," he muttered.

He started envisioning himself showing his friends the sports car Isabella had designed.

Meanwhile, Michael's plan was already in action.

A young guy walked out of a bar with two glamorous women. Just as he led them into a nearby hotel, some guys lying in wait threw a sack over his head and carried him off.

A big guy, hearing that his buddy had been bullied, armed himself and went to help, only to get ambushed and beaten up badly.

A woman found her bar on fire.

All these victims had one thing in common-they were from the Brown family!

Early in the morning, a meeting was held at the Brown Villa. Paxton's siblings and other family members sat around the table, all looking grim.

"Paxton, this has to stop. Our family's been attacked, our businesses destroyed, our overseas investments targeted, and our stock's in freefall. Cut it out," a bearded man in a gray vest said coldly, staring at Paxton.

Paxton stayed silent, his face dark.

A middle-aged woman at the table sobbed, "My son's got broken bones and is now recovering in the hospital! You wanted to avenge your daughter, but why are we the ones suffering?"

A man with a grim face slammed the table. "I told you not to go against Mason rashly. We still don't know who hurt Pearl, and Isabella's family is already destroyed-they couldn't have done this. Mason warned us it could be the other two families behind this. We should be looking into this, not keep provoking him! Damn it, my nightclub was burned, and I almost ended up bald!"

Paxton's face stayed dark, his hands trembling slightly, showing his inner rage.

The family members were sending a clear message: leave Isabella alone for now and don't provoke her anymore.

Everyone stared at Paxton, waiting for his response.

The room fell into a long silence until Paxton finally sighed.

"I will withdraw all people targeting Isabella. As for Pearl's situation, I will hire a private investigator to look into it," Paxton said, looking at the family members. This was his biggest concession.

The family members exchanged glances and eventually agreed to Paxton's proposal.

John, who had been keeping an eye on things, immediately got the news and informed Mason about the agreement between Paxton and the other Browns.

Mason, who hadn't gone to bed yet, frowned slightly when he heard the news.

"Was this your doing?" Mason asked, eyeing John.

John quickly shook his head. "Grandfather, I'm a decent man. I wouldn't do something like this! Besides, this method can't solve the problem completely. I've always thought nabbing the one who hurt Pearl is the only real way to settle things between the Browns and us."

Mason narrowed his eyes, a suspicion forming in his mind. This kind of thing wasn't done much at home, but it was pretty common overseas.

"Could it be the group that took Pearl? They might want to escalate the conflict, hence attacking the Brown Family's assets?" John speculated.

Mason glanced at John and shook his head. "Alright, this ends for now."

John's eyes widened in surprise. "Why? If we don't find the real culprit, won't Isabella always be in danger?"

Mason raised an eyebrow, looking at John. He smiled and asked, "Haven't you always hated Isabella? Why are you suddenly on her side?"

John awkwardly smiled. "it's 'cause you care about Isabella. I'm just trying to make you happy by helping her."

Mason's smile hinted at something deeper. He could see that John had genuinely developed feelings for Isabella.

"If you like Isabella, try to win her back. If not, don't hurt her," Mason advised John before heading back to his room.

Once in his room, Mason's expression grew serious. "Who exactly is Isabella's secret husband? Could it really be him?"

Mason sighed. If his suspicions were correct, things would get complicated.

The next day, Isabella went to her new job.

To her surprise, the company had assigned her a personal driver. Isabella thought this was a perk for all department heads, but the driver, Leo Schmidt, explained it was a special compensation for the unfair treatment she received during the selection process.

"Thank you, Leo. Pick me up after work," Isabella said with a smile as she got out of the car, waving goodbye to Leo.

Leo gave a professional smile, nodding at Isabella.

After watching Isabella enter the building, Leo immediately called Michael. "Mr. Williams, Mrs. Williams has safely entered the company. No suspicious vehicles were spotted. She's safe for now."

The response from the other end was brief before the call ended.

In reality, Leo was not just a driver but also a bodyguard assigned to Isabella by Michael. Despite their warning to Paxton, necessary precautions were still needed.

Dwayne Larson, Isabella's direct superior, personally greeted her and showed her to her office.

Dwayne gestured towards the office and the young woman inside. "Here's where you'll be stationed. Meet your assistant, Juliet Larson. You'll manage the key responsibilities, and Juliet will help out with simple tasks like delivering documents."

###chapter 120 9999 Roses

Isabella greeted Juliet, starting their working relationship. Then Dwayne took Isabella around to meet the rest of the team.

Isabella's department had about 30 people, all of whom she'd be leading from now on.

She started off all enthusiastic and friendly, but she couldn't help but notice that after she introduced herself, a lot of folks were sneaking glances at one particular woman.

From Dwayne's earlier intro, Isabella knew this woman was Madeline Eve. Isabella was the new head of the design department, while Madeline was the deputy head.

Dwayne had quietly mentioned to Isabella that if she hadn't shown up, Madeline would have been the one in charge.

"Why's everyone looking at me? Isabella's our new director, let's give her a warm welcome," Madeline said with a smile. Only after she clapped did the others join in.

Isabella could tell Madeline wasn't thrilled about her. With a bunch of employees on Madeline's side, Isabella knew she had to play it smart in this power showdown.

Isabella walked up to Madeline and extended her hand. "I've heard a lot about you from Dwayne. He says you're talented and beautiful. I hope we can learn from each other and make a bigger contribution to the company."

"I don't think we'll learn much from each other. Unlike you, I don't have a powerful family backing me," Madeline said with a smile, but her words were sharp.

Isabella's smile faded a bit. She knew Madeline was hinting that she only got the job because of her connections with the Williams Family.

With a calm smile, Isabella pulled back her hand and said, "I've gotten here through my own hard work. Whether you believe it or not is up to you. The fact that my designs won first and second place in the selection speaks for itself."

Madeline's face soured. Isabella was clearly mocking her for not even making the cut.

Madeline was about to snap back when Dwayne stepped in between them, smiling and separating them.

"Alright, let's wrap up the intros for today. Isabella, you should head back to your office and get familiar with your tasks. The company is newly established, so there's a lot to do. We'll officially start work tomorrow," Dwayne said.

Isabella liked Dwayne and didn't want to make things awkward for him, so she nodded and went back to her office.

Once Isabella was gone, Dwayne turned to Madeline and said, "I know you don't like Isabella, but she's been directly appointed by the top management. We're here to work and make money, so let's try to keep things harmonious and avoid office gossip."

Madeline rolled her eyes. She was a proud woman who believed in her exceptional abilities. She didn't even think much of Dwayne.

Dwayne shrugged off Madeline's attitude, told everyone to get back to work, and headed back to his office.

In her office, Isabella asked Juliet about the work and how things were going.

Just then, Isabella got a call about a delivery.

"Ms. Taylor, I'll get it for you. It's part of my job," Juliet offered, eager to help out.

Isabella had a soft spot for Juliet, the enthusiastic girl. She smiled, "It should be the gifts I got for you guys. Could you help me bring them up? I'll give you a new phone as a thank-you."

Juliet's eyes lit up with excitement. "Ms. Taylor, are you really giving us such expensive gifts on your first day?"

Isabella waved her hand casually. "I won them in a raffle. I can't use them all, so I thought I'd share."

"Thank you, Ms. Taylor!" Juliet exclaimed, practically bouncing with joy before dashing downstairs.

After a while, Juliet came back, pushing a cart loaded with roses.

"Ms. Taylor, it's not the gifts you prepared. It's flowers from Mr. John Williams," Juliet said, pointing to the roses.

Isabella frowned when she heard the flowers were from John. She even saw a card and a jewelry necklace among the roses.

She quickly unblocked John's number and called him.

John answered, thinking Isabella was calling to thank him, but instead, he got an earful.

"John, are you trying to disgust me? Don't you know I'm married? Sending so many roses to a married woman-what are you trying to do? Ruin my marriage? How can you be so malicious? If you send flowers again, I'll complain to Mason!" Isabella yelled and then hung up.

John was stunned for a few seconds and then felt a surge of anger. He couldn't understand why sending flowers to Isabella had caused such a furious response. Just as he tried to call Isabella back, he found his number had been blocked again.

"Isabella is out of her mind! No one has ever rejected me!" Furious, John decided to go to Isabella's company to confront her.

Juliet looked at the furious Isabella, too scared to speak. It wasn't until Isabella turned to her that she asked softly, "Ms. Taylor, what should we do with these flowers?"

Isabella glanced at the massive pile of roses, feeling a headache coming on. The card clearly stated there were 9,999 roses. She wondered where John had even managed to get them.

She waved her hand and told Juliet, "Contact some wedding planners and boutique hotels to see if they need these roses. Sell them at 30% of the market price. Use the money to buy coffee for the department."

Juliet opened her mouth but decided not to argue. She quickly went out to make the calls.

While Juliet was on the phone, Isabella's delivery finally arrived. Since Juliet was not there, Isabella went to get the 30 phones herself. Bad luck-she ran into John on her way downstairs.

###chapter 121 Slap Him

Isabella just wanted to grab her package, but she bumped into John, who had just shown up.

John was just as shocked to see Isabella stepping out of the building right when he was about to look for her.

"Perfect timing," they both blurted out at the same time, then went quiet.

John broke the silence first. "What's the deal with you rejecting my gift and blocking my number? Seriously, who do you think you are?"

John looked pissed and gloomy.

In the past, Isabella would've been scared out of her mind seeing John like this.

She'd have totally freaked, apologized a million times, begged for forgiveness, and even gotten down on her knees-completely humiliated herself.

But now, Isabella was different. She'd learned that love wasn't about giving endlessly and hoping for something in return. It was about mutual feelings, like what she had with Michael now.

"You've got some nerve questioning me. What gives you the right?" Isabella shot John a cold, impatient smile.

"I told you on the phone. I'm married now. Sending me flowers will just cause problems! I'm protecting my own love and marriage! And stop acting all high and mighty. I don't like you anymore. Don't think I'm still the old Isabella," she said, trying to get past John to grab her package.

"Hold it right there!" John, furious, grabbed her wrist.

Isabella felt his strong grip, causing her pain. She snapped, "Let go of me, or I'll call security."

John smirked. "Where do you get the nerve to talk to me like that? Nobody crosses me in this city."

Isabella checked out the guards by the door-they were totally spaced out, staring at the sky. Just like John said, nobody around here was messing with him.

"See that? You'd better just be my woman, Isabella! Your husband might even beg you to be with me once he knows who I am!" John said with a smug grin.

His words made Isabella furious.

"You jerk! Don't you dare insult him!" Isabella spat, slapping John hard across the face.

The slap echoed, leaving John stunned.

The old Isabella wouldn't have dared to even look him in the eye, let alone slap him.

Bullies, when unexpectedly challenged, rarely reflect; instead, they react with anger and a sense of being provoked.

John was that bully right now. His long-term oppression of Isabella had made him forget she was a person with her own will and freedom.

In a fit of rage, John grabbed Isabella by the neck and pinned her against a car.

"How dare you turn me down and raise your hand against me? Who do you think you are? A lowly woman, still pretending to be the affluent heiress you once were?" John spat, his face twisted in anger, completely ignoring Isabella's pained expression.

Isabella struggled to breathe, desperately slapping John's arm, but his grip was like a vise on her neck.

The security guards at the entrance felt uneasy. They were scared of John, but if they didn't do something, they'd be out of a job.

One security guard nervously tried to intervene, while the other ran into the building to inform Dwayne.

Dwayne was on the job when he heard about John choking Isabella. It knocked him sideways.

'Is John out of his mind? Doesn't he know who owns this company?' Dwayne thought as he hurried downstairs to the entrance.

Isabella's breathing was becoming increasingly difficult, and her face had turned pale.

"Mr. Williams, let her go now, or I'll call our boss," Dwayne shouted, grabbing John's hand and pulling it away forcefully.

Isabella finally managed to breathe again, clutching her throat and coughing loudly.

John glared angrily at Dwayne. "Know your place. How dare you stop me?"

Dwayne, unafraid, said coldly, "Maybe my status isn't as high as yours, but I don't think you can harm me."

Dwayne wasn't scared. He worked for Michael and knew Michael's character well.

Michael was a boss who clearly separated work from personal feelings. He wouldn't punish Dwayne for standing up to John.

John understood this too but felt deeply annoyed.

Isabella, having regained her breath, stood up and angrily said to John, "This is the last time, John! I'm telling you, one more time messing with my marriage and I'm going straight to Mason!"

John's face twisted with a sinister smile. Ever since Bianca was imprisoned, he had been in a foul mood.

"Go ahead, call my grandfather. Call him as many times as you want. But don't get too happy. Once I find out who you and your husband really are, I'll destroy both of you!" John spat his threats before turning and walking away.

Isabella watched John's departing figure, a hint of uncertainty in her eyes. She wasn't afraid of John but was worried about what he might do to Michael.

Dwayne gently patted Isabella's arm and asked, "Isabella, are you okay? Do you need me to take you to the hospital?"

Isabella shook her head. "I'm fine, no need for the hospital. But I came down to get a package, and there might be a lot. Could you help me carry some? Of course, I'll give you a thank-you gift."

Dwayne was momentarily stunned, then smiled and agreed. But he didn't take Isabella's words seriously.

When Dwayne moved the 30 phones to Isabella's department, Isabella immediately opened the box.

"This is the latest model, with the highest specs. I hope you like it." Isabella handed the phone to Dwayne, clearly seeing the astonishment on his face.

"Are these phones for real? Oh my God. They just got released! How did you get them?" Dwayne asked, staring at Isabella in shock.

###chapter 122 John's Your Nephew

Isabella told Dwayne she had scored over 30 phones in a raffle at some tech expo.

Dwayne's jaw practically hit the floor. He couldn't believe her luck.

'Hold up, even if there was a raffle, no way one person wins 30 phones. Something's fishy,' Dwayne thought, remembering that Michael had also been at that tech expo abroad.

If Michael had hooked Isabella up with those phones because of their relationship, it would all add up.

Even though Dwayne figured it out, he decided to keep quiet. John had just had a run-in with Isabella, and bringing up Michael might just make things worse.

"Thanks, Isabella. I really appreciate the gift, and I'm sure everyone in your department will be stoked too." Dwayne smiled, then grabbed his phone and headed back to his office.

First thing Dwayne did when he got back to his office was call Michael to fill him in on what went down.

Michael was in a meeting when Dwayne's call came through. As he listened, his face turned icy.

"Is Isabella okay?" Michael asked, his voice low and serious.

Just hearing Michael's tone made Dwayne shiver. He could feel the anger.

"She's physically fine, but there's a handprint on her neck," Dwayne quickly replied, forgetting Michael couldn't see him nodding.

"I get it. I'll take care of it. You did good today," Michael said before hanging up.

After hanging up, Michael called Jerry. "Jerry, find out where John is and give him a good beating! Then pin it on the Brown family."

Jerry was stunned for a moment before cautiously asking, "Mr. Williams, are you sure about this? John's your nephew."

"Owen didn't raise him right. As his elder, it's my job to step in," Michael replied coldly.

Jerry shivered and quickly nodded at his phone. "Got it, Mr. Williams. I'll take care of it."

After Michael hung up, Jerry frowned deeply. 'What did John do to piss Michael off so much?'

It wasn't hard for Jerry to get the scoop, since the incident between Isabella and John happened in a busy area with lots of witnesses.

When Jerry found out John had grabbed Isabella by the neck and nearly choked her, he knew John was in for a world of hurt.

"Mr. John Williams, you can't blame me. This is all on Mr. Michael Williams' orders," Jerry muttered, shaking his head as he pulled a solid wooden baseball bat from his cabinet.

Meanwhile, just as Dwayne was about to dive into work after his call, someone rushed in to report a dispute in the design department.

"Design department again? What now?" Dwayne asked, rubbing his forehead in frustration.

The employee who brought the news gave a wry smile. "Apparently, Isabella handed out new phones to her colleagues, but Ms. Eve thinks they're all fakes."

"So Isabella and Madeline are at it?" Dwayne frowned. From what he knew, Isabella wasn't one to start random fights.

The employee shook his head. "No, it's Isabella's assistant Juliet going at it with Ms. Eve and her crew."

Dwayne raised an eyebrow. Juliet was the assistant he had assigned to Isabella. He didn't expect Juliet to stand up for Isabella on her first day. Isabella must have some serious charm.

"Alright, I'll go check it out," Dwayne sighed, shaking his head as he left his office.

In the design department, Juliet was boiling mad. Isabella had tasked her with giving out the 30 phones to everyone, Madeline included, even though Madeline was trying to ice her out. But Madeline was totally unappreciative, calling all those phones fake.

Sometimes, being nice to your haters, who then act like total jerks, can actually make others feel sorry for you. It's a smart move, whether you're at work or in school.

"Ms. Taylor was nice enough to give you those phones. If you don't want them, that's fine, but why be such a jerk and put her down?" Juliet was indignant for Isabella.

Madeline crossed her arms and sneered. "If Isabella had given us anything else, maybe we'd have taken it. But fake phones? She might as well have given us apples; at least we could eat those."

An employee behind Madeline also sneered. "Ms. Eve is right. Isabella claims she won these phones in a raffle. What kind of raffle gives 30 latest-model phones to one person? Couldn't she come up with a better lie?"

Hearing this, some design department employees hesitated as they looked at the new phones in their hands. Madeline's words did make some sense.

Juliet's anger simmered, barely contained, as Isabella finally emerged from the restroom. She had tried to use cold water to remove the handprint on her neck but had failed.

Seeing Juliet and Madeline in the middle of a heated argument, Isabella quickly understood what was happening.

"Juliet, why bother arguing with them? If they don't want my goodwill, just take back the phones and sell them." Isabella waved dismissively, then looked at her colleagues.

Isabella shrugged. "I meant well, I swear. I wouldn't give you all fake phones. If they turn out to be real, blame Madeline for misleading you."

###chapter 123 The Confrontation Between Two Women

Just as Isabella wrapped up her sentence, Dwayne's voice chimed in from behind her.

"Hey, I heard there was some drama, so I thought I'd check it out," Dwayne said, flashing a smile at the design team.

Dwayne knew exactly what had gone down and that Madeline was in for some trouble. He was here to back Isabella up.

"Mr. Larson, Ms. Taylor brought in some fake phones and tried to pass them off as the latest models from a big brand. We only use the real McCoy. You should set her straight," Madeline said with a smug grin.

Dwayne glanced at the phones on the table, raised an eyebrow, and pulled out an identical one from his pocket.

"Is this what you're talking about? I just checked it out. It's the real deal. You can verify the serial numbers on the official site," Dwayne said, pointing to the phone's serial number with a casual shrug.

Madeline's face fell.

Dwayne looked at her, clearly annoyed. "Ms. Eve, did you accuse Isabella without even checking the phones? Even the cops need evidence to arrest someone. Throwing around baseless accusations is called slander, and it can get you in legal trouble."

Madeline's face darkened. She never thought Isabella would hand out real phones.

These phones were crazy expensive, way out of most people's league, and Isabella's story had seemed like a joke to them.

With Dwayne's confirmation, some of the design team started giving Madeline the side-eye. They were kicking themselves for not taking the phones, especially since Isabella wasn't giving them another chance.

Madeline felt the hostile stares around her, like she was about to be roasted alive.

'Damn Isabella,' Madeline thought, feeling the pressure. 'She actually gave away that many phones? My people will turn on me if I don't fix this.'

Madeline quickly put on a remorseful look. She grabbed Isabella's hand and bowed. "I'm really sorry, Ms. Taylor. I misunderstood you. I shouldn't have doubted you! My colleagues refused the phones because of my bad judgment. It's all on me. I'm not asking for your forgiveness, but I hope you can forgive these innocent colleagues."

Isabella narrowed her eyes, seeing through Madeline's act. If she turned down Madeline now, she'd look unforgiving.

But if Isabella accepted, it would make Madeline look good in front of everyone.

Dwayne watched Isabella, curious about her next move.

Isabella grinned and called out to the design team, "Hey everyone, if you missed out on a phone earlier, come grab one now. And let's give a big thanks to Ms. Eve for her heartfelt apology. We could all learn a thing or two from her."

The design team lit up, eagerly stepping forward to reclaim the phones they had turned down before.

'Isabella's so easily manipulated,' Madeline thought. 'That apology was a small price to pay for having my colleagues firmly in my corner. I always win.'

Isabella caught Madeline's fleeting smile and sneered internally.

'You think I'm that easy to fool? You've got another thing coming,' Isabella thought, already plotting her next move.

Once everyone had their phones, Isabella spoke up again, "These phones are just a welcome gift. From now on, anyone who makes outstanding contributions and excels in their work will get even more rewards!"

Her words were met with cheers and applause from her colleagues, who now saw her in a whole new light.

Nothing gets people motivated like some good old-fashioned perks.

Just when Madeline thought it was all over, Isabella continued, "We strive for excellence, but even the best can learn from their mistakes. Ms. Eve's apology is a valuable lesson for all of us. To prevent similar situations, I suggest we share her experience-and her sincere apology-on the company intranet as a reminder of the importance of humility and staying ahead of the competition."

Dwayne's face lit up with amusement, while Madeline's turned a deep shade of red.

Isabella's smile was saccharine, belying the icy satisfaction in her eyes. 'Want to improve your reputation? I can help with that, and ensure it's not just limited to the design department.'

"Ms. Taylor, isn't this a bit much?" Madeline forced a strained smile.

But Isabella's expression was firm. "Ms. Eve, have you forgotten you're a senior leader here? The higher our position, the greater our responsibility. One mistake from us can cause huge losses for the company. I believe this incident will remind everyone that work is serious and personal feelings should never interfere with company operations!"

Isabella then turned to Dwayne. "Mr. Larson, what do you think of my idea?"

"I think you're spot on. As a company leader, I know that one careless order can mess up the whole operation. I'll get in touch with the PR department right now and have them publicize this incident. Of course, we'll highlight Ms. Eve's positive image of owning up to her mistake," Dwayne said, pulling out his phone and making the call right there in front of everyone.

###chapter 124 Sad Amelia

Dwayne had always had a bone to pick with Madeline. She was always challenging him, thinking she was all that because of her skills.

Now that Isabella had a plan to take Madeline down a notch, Dwayne was all in. Plus, Isabella's reasons made perfect sense to him.

"Thanks for backing me up, Mr. Larson. Madeline, you should thank Mr. Larson too," Isabella said, giving Madeline a look that said, "You better show some sincere gratitude."

Madeline's face contorted with rage. They weren't just insulting her; they expected gratitude for it. Was this some kind of sick joke?

Dwayne waved it off with a grin. "No need for that. Just get back to work. This is nothing. I gotta head back to my office; you all carry on."

He walked back to his office, still smiling. He knew Madeline wouldn't thank him, but he had already humiliated her enough. Pushing it further might make her snap.

Isabella watched Madeline's sour expression with a smug smile before heading back to her office, Juliet trailing behind.

Soon, news of Madeline's apology spread through the company like wildfire. Everyone knew the once-proud deputy director of the design department had bowed down to Isabella.

Back in the office, Juliet was all smiles. "Ms. Taylor, you were amazing! Did you see Madeline's face? She and her crew looked like they just swallowed a fly."

Isabella sighed, sinking into her chair. "Honestly, I don't want this drama. I'd rather work in a place where everyone gets along. It's better for the company and the employees. Sometimes I feel like I'm cursed because no matter where I go, I can't escape this kind of drama."

Isabella's voice was filled with resignation. Suddenly, she remembered something and turned to Juliet. "By the way, did you manage to sell those roses I asked you to?"

Juliet nodded. "Piece of cake. As soon as the companies heard about our low prices, they snapped them up. They sold out fast."

Isabella sighed in relief. "From now on, if John sends me anything, just send it back. If he won't take it, sell it."

Juliet nodded, making a mental note.

In the days that followed, with Juliet's help, Isabella started getting the hang of the company's operations. She needed to get up to speed quickly to avoid giving Madeline and her cronies any chance to exploit her weaknesses.

After a long day, Isabella had just about grasped the basics of the company's operations. She was about to head home, exhausted, when her phone rang. It was Amelia.

"Isabella, can you join me for a drink? I'm feeling really down right now." Amelia's voice was filled with despair, like something bad had happened.

Isabella frowned and asked, "What happened? Don't worry, I'll come to you. Send me your address."

After getting the address, Isabella rushed out of the company, where Leo was already waiting for her.

"Ms. Taylor, are we heading home now?" Leo asked with a smile.

Isabella shook her head, looking worried. "No, Leo. I'll give you an address. Take me there right away."

Leo glanced at the address Isabella handed him, started the car, and drove off.

Meanwhile, at a bar, Amelia had already downed several drinks, but the alcohol wasn't doing its job. She kept replaying what she'd seen earlier that day.

With the Brown Family temporarily backing off from their plans against Isabella, Amelia felt like the usual eyes on her had disappeared.

Feeling a bit safer, she decided it was time to move out of Benjamin's place. So, she headed to the hospital to find him.

But when she got there, she saw Benjamin holding a beautiful woman who was crying in his arms.

The scene made Amelia uneasy; a sharp, unexpected stab of jealousy. It was jarring, considering the casual nature of her relationship with Benjamin. They were friends, nothing more, yet here she was, consumed by jealousy.

"I've heard that physical intimacy can sometimes lead to deeper feelings. Is that what's happening to me? I can't believe I'm developing feelings for Benjamin." Amelia couldn't believe she had feelings for Benjamin.

Noticing Amelia, Benjamin gently pushed the woman away and walked over to her.

"Why are you here? You didn't come to see me, did you? Let me explain: that girl is a patient's family member. I saved her father's life, so she was emotional and hugged me out of gratitude. We're not in a romantic relationship. This kind of thing happens to doctors all the time," Benjamin said with a shrug and a smile.

Hearing his explanation, Amelia felt a bit relieved but didn't show it.

"Why are you telling me this? We're just friends. I came to tell you I'm planning to move back to my own place," Amelia said, getting to the point.

Benjamin frowned. "Paxton won't give up so easily."

"But I feel much safer now. I've troubled you too much these days. I feel really bad about it, so just please say yes to this," Amelia said, turning to leave, not daring to meet Benjamin's eyes.

If Amelia had turned back, she would have seen the sadness, anxiety, and reluctance in Benjamin's eyes. She might have even heard the whispers escaping his lips.

"Are we destined to stay in this kind of relationship? Damn it, I spend all day teaching Michael how to date, but when it comes to me, I can't even muster the courage to confess my feelings," Benjamin muttered to himself.

After leaving the hospital, Amelia went straight to a bar and drank until now.

During this time, many guys tried to hit on the drunken Amelia, but she shot them down with harsh words.

Amelia held it together until Isabella arrived, then, overwhelmed, she collapsed into her friend's arms, sobbing uncontrollably.

###chapter 125 Switch Them All to Steel Ones!

Isabella gave Amelia a gentle pat on the back and asked softly, "What's going on?"

"Is it your mom's illness getting worse?" Isabella guessed, her face full of concern.

Amelia shook her head. Isabella was puzzled. Amelia was usually so cheerful and outgoing. She only cried when Isabella suffered injustice.

Isabella thought back over her recent life and realized she had been pretty happy lately, with nothing that should make Amelia cry.

So, it had to be something about a guy.

"Did some guy dump you? When did you start dating? How come I didn't know?" Isabella asked, surprised.

Amelia shook her head. "I haven't been in a relationship."

Isabella was even more confused. Then a thought hit her, and she asked in shock, "Don't tell me you're all lovesick over some guy? Who is this mystery man? Have I met him?"

Amelia blushed. "Let's not talk about it. Just drink with me. I don't want to bring him up."

But Isabella was serious. She grabbed Amelia's hand and said, "Okay, seriously. Even if you won't tell me who he is, I need to know: Is he hot? Rich? Any red flags? What's he like? And MOST importantly, is he married? 'Cause I'm not hearing about you being a side piece."

Amelia couldn't help but smile at Isabella's flood of questions. "Don't worry, I would never fall for a married man. I'm not into breaking up homes. And you're asking too many questions. I don't even know the answers to some of them myself. Let's change the subject."

Isabella looked at Amelia's face, stayed quiet for a few seconds, then sighed and nodded. "Alright, let's change the subject. Did you get drunk because you confessed to him and got rejected?"

Amelia shook her head helplessly. "Actually, I haven't confessed to him. I don't even know if he likes me. I just can't figure out what our relationship is. Anyway, let's not talk about it anymore. Just drink with me."

Amelia handed Isabella a fresh glass of wine.

Isabella had no choice but to drop it. She picked up the glass and downed it in one go.

At that moment, Amelia noticed a handprint on Isabella's neck.

Amelia shot up from her chair, furious. "Why do you have a handprint on your neck? Who grabbed you? It wasn't Michael, was it?"

Isabella shook her head. "It wasn't Michael. He would never lay a hand on me. It was John. He's a lunatic. Even though I'm married, he keeps harassing me!"

Amelia's anger boiled over. "John again! Didn't you tell Mason? He should teach that jerk a lesson."

Isabella shook her head. "No, I feel like John pursuing me is something Mason has silently approved of."

Amelia furrowed her brows. "How could that be? Didn't Mason agree to cancel your engagement with John?"

Isabella sighed, looking defeated. "Remember when John was in the hospital? Mason asked me to cook for him. Even then, I could tell Mason wanted me to be with John."

"Is Mason losing his mind or something? How can he just ignore your feelings?" Amelia grumbled, clearly frustrated.

Isabella traced the rim of her glass, smiling sadly. "Mason means well. I know he genuinely cares about me. He's probably worried that after he's gone, there won't be anyone to protect me. Marrying John, the Williams family heir, would guarantee my safety."

Amelia was speechless. When it came to status, Isabella's current husband, Michael, couldn't compare to Mason.

"Why is our fate so miserable? Never mind, let's drink. Tonight, we drink until we drop," Amelia said, handing Isabella another glass of wine.

The two of them sat at the bar, drinking non-stop. Any guys who tried to hit on them were quietly chased away by Leo.

Meanwhile, Leo informed Michael about Isabella drinking at the bar.

Amelia didn't stop until she was completely drunk. She leaned on the bar, crying, "Isabella, if anyone ever bullies you, you have to tell me. If Michael dares to bully you, I'll kick his balls!"

Michael's voice came from behind them. "I don't think you'll get that chance."

Isabella turned around and saw Michael. "Why are you here?"

Michael looked at the handprint on Isabella's neck, concern flashing in his eyes. "I heard John choked you, so I came to find you. Does it still hurt?"

Michael gently touched Isabella's neck. The memory of John's hands around Isabella's throat choked Michael's heart.

Isabella, a bit tipsy, tried to stand up from her chair but nearly fell. Luckily, Michael caught her.

She fell into Michael's arms, crying, "It doesn't hurt, but I'm scared. John said he would find out your identity and kill us! He humiliated you in front of me, and I couldn't stand it, so I slapped him. Should I not have hit him? Maybe then he wouldn't be so angry. Maybe you should go abroad, to Kenna. He might be able to protect you."

Michael held Isabella tightly, feeling even more heartbroken. He hadn't expected her to suffer because of him.

'John, you truly deserve to die!' Michael thought, a cold, murderous look flashing in his eyes.

While Isabella was crying in his arms, Michael secretly took out his phone and sent a message to Jerry.

Michael: [How's it going?]

Jerry: [Everything is ready. This time, we're using solid wood baseball bats. They hurt a lot but won't cause serious injuries.]

Michael: [Wooden bats? Switch them all to steel ones!]

Jerry, who was about to take action, was stunned when he saw Michael's message.

###chapter 126 Hit Him!

Jerry checked his phone again, making sure the message was really from Michael. He felt a bit annoyed.

'It's just a slight choking. Why's Michael so mad?' Jerry thought. He pondered for a moment and quickly figured it out.

When someone attacks another person, they rarely do it quietly. John must've said something while hurting Isabella, something the onlookers didn't hear, but Michael found out from Isabella. That's why John was in trouble now.

A car pulled up by the roadside, not far from the bar where John would be coming out tonight.

Jerry and his crew waited in the car for about 20 minutes before finally spotting John.

John's steps were wobbly, showing he'd had a lot to drink at the bar. According to Jerry's investigation, ever since Bianca got locked up, John had been in a bad mood and went out drinking every night. Despite his frequent bar visits, John seemed to have a strong attachment to Bianca, as he turned down every woman who tried to approach him.

"Mr. Nelson, when should we move?" a masked guy whispered to Jerry.

Jerry glanced at John's car parked by the roadside. As the heir to a powerful family, John had bodyguards with him. To get to John, they had to distract his bodyguards first.

"Now. Follow Plan A," Jerry said, waving his hand. The van door opened, and a group of men got out.

These guys were seasoned fighters, pros at handling bodyguards and kidnapping targets.

It was prime drinking time, and a crowd had gathered outside the bar. John's bodyguards, alert and on edge, sensed something was off when they saw a group of men approaching.

"Mr. Williams, get in the car!" a bodyguard shouted, pulling John toward the car.

Jerry's men quickly closed in, throwing a handful of lime powder into the bodyguards' eyes to blind them.

John's reactions were slow due to the alcohol. By the time he realized something was wrong, it was too late. A fighter put a black bag over his head, and another knocked him out with a stun gun.

The bodyguards struggled to open their eyes and tried to rush to John's aid, but they were quickly overpowered by the fighters. These fighters fought dirty, using stun guns, lime powder, and even pepper spray.

The fighters' goal was to prevent the bodyguards from rescuing John. They only needed to buy time until two of their companions carried John away and threw him into a van. Afterwards, the fighters dispersed.

One of the bodyguards, trembling with pain, managed to pull out his phone and make a call. Soon, reinforcements arrived to tend to the bodyguards and began searching for John.

John was jolted awake by a splash of cold water. His eyes were covered with a blindfold, preventing him from seeing his surroundings.

Jerry stood nearby, gripping a steel baseball bat. He looked at John, then at the bat, and finally sighed.

'John, don't blame us. You brought this on yourself by hurting Isabella,' Jerry thought, feeling a bit guilty. He then raised the bat and swung it at John.

John felt a sharp pain in his leg and screamed, "Do you know who I am? You're all dead! Just wait!"

No matter how much John cursed or bragged about his Williams family inheritance, the fighters around him acted like they didn't hear a thing, relentlessly beating him with their bats.

Jerry held back a bit, making sure they avoided hitting John's vital areas like his head and groin. Most of the blows landed on John's back and butt.

When the sound of a bone breaking echoed, John clutched his leg, howling in pain.

Jerry decided it was enough. He planted the bat on the ground and used a hoarse voice to say, "Our Brown Family suffered the same treatment from you before. Consider this payback."

Hearing Jerry's words, John thought the Brown family was nuts. Before he could process it further, he heard the sound of a stun gun. A sharp pain shot through his neck, and he blacked out again.

When John woke up, he was in a hospital. His leg was suspended in a sling. He had injured his leg in a car accident before, and now the other leg was hurt, making them somewhat symmetrical.

Mason was shocked to hear that John had been kidnapped, but soon news came that the kidnappers had dumped John at the hospital entrance.

When John woke up, he saw Mason sitting by his bed.

"Grandpa, you have to help me find those guys! The people who kidnapped me are from the Brown family! They're retaliating against me because they think we attacked their members. I won't let them get away with this!" John's face was filled with anger.

Mason's expression was very grim, but he shook his head. "This might not be Paxton and his people. It could be the same group who kidnapped Pearl. They're trying to provoke further conflict between our families."

Mason's words hit John like a ton of bricks. All this time searching for Pearl and the others - for nothing! If it was the same group, finding them was hopeless, and John's revenge would remain a fantasy.

"Have you offended anyone recently?" Mason asked in a deep voice.

John frowned, thinking carefully, and shook his head. "No, I haven't offended anyone recently."

The words were barely out when a jolt of recognition slammed into him. Isabella. He'd offended Isabella today. Because she rejected his roses and slapped him, he had nearly choked her.

But John didn't dare to mention this. He knew Mason was very fond of Isabella. If he revealed this, his other leg might end up broken too.

###chapter 127 Crying Together

Mason watched John's face closely, knowing the guy was definitely hiding something. But since John wasn't spilling, Mason decided not to push it.

"Think it over. If you want to dig into this, go for it. If not, I'll let Paxton know," Mason said.

John looked shocked. "Didn't you say it's unlikely the Browns did this? Why tell Paxton then?"

Mason squinted. "I have my reasons. Spreading the word about your injury does two things. First, it gives the Browns a sense of balance since they've had a lot of injuries lately and probably hold a grudge against us. Second, it helps steer public opinion. With both heirs hurt and both families denying responsibility, suspicion will fall on the other families. This takes some heat off us for now."

As the head of the Williams Family, Mason was always strategic and resourceful. John's status as the sole heir was prestigious, and no one would believe he got hurt on purpose just to gain sympathy.

Mason wanted to use this incident to sway public opinion in favor of the Williams Family.

John took a deep breath. He wasn't thrilled about it, but since Mason had already made up his mind, he decided to go along with the plan.

"I heard you've been sending people to the prison recently? Are you planning to take care of Bianca?" Mason suddenly asked, his eyes cold.

John felt a wave of nerves because it was true. He had secretly visited Bianca in prison, and she told him she was having a hard time. As a disabled person, she was often bullied by other inmates, so he sent people to protect her.

Mason's gaze was icy. "Didn't you tell me you were planning to pursue Isabella again? Why are you still tangled up with Bianca? I expect more dedication from you. If you're not interested in Isabella, stop bothering her. Your engagement is over."

"I understand, Grandpa. Please give me some time to handle this," John said, lowering his head.

Disappointed, Mason stood up and left the hospital.

Meanwhile, Jerry, after dealing with John, reported to Michael.

Michael acknowledged it and hung up.

Michael was still at the bar, where Amelia and Isabella were hugging and crying at the counter.

"What should I do? I may seem bold, but when it comes to love, I'm a coward." Amelia stopped, thinking about what happened to Isabella, and kept crying, "I can't even protect you, my bestie. I really want to take on John, but I just don't have the guts!"

Isabella cried too, holding Amelia. "Honey, you've done more than enough. My pain shouldn't be yours to bear!"

Amelia kept crying. "But it's okay. I can't mess with John, but I can handle Michael. We're on the same level. If he ever bullies you, just tell me, and I'll take him down for you!"

"Don't worry, I will!" Isabella cried, patting Amelia's back.

Michael rubbed his face in frustration. Just then, someone approached from behind him.

"Why'd you call me here so late? What's going on?" Benjamin appeared behind Michael, but his expression stiffened when he saw Amelia.

Michael glanced at Benjamin. "I remember telling you to treat Amelia well if you like her. But look-she's crying hard like a broken heart."

Benjamin looked embarrassed. "I don't know what's gotten into her today. I think she's even harder to read than Isabella."

"That's how love is. The more you care about her, the harder it is to understand her. You overthink every word, fearing it might hurt her, and end up lost," Michael said calmly.

Benjamin stared at Michael in shock. "Damn, did I just hear that from you? Did an alien take over your body?"

Michael shot Benjamin a cold look and took out his phone. "Amelia and Isabella kicked me out while they cried together. I got bored, so I googled what a husband should do when his wife cries. Everything I just said came from that search."

Benjamin scratched his head awkwardly. "Got it. So, what should I do now? Did the search say anything?"

Michael sighed, running a hand through his hair in frustration. "Just take Amelia home. I need to take Isabella home to sleep."

Benjamin nodded reluctantly and walked over to Amelia and Isabella with Michael.

"Alright, enough crying. We need to go home," Michael said, lifting Isabella into his arms.

"Why are you taking Isabella? She's mine. You can't take her away. I'm not done crying with her," Amelia wailed, holding Isabella's hand.

"I don't want to leave you either, my dear Amelia," Isabella said, holding Amelia's hand back.

"Enough, let's go home. I'll cry with you there," Benjamin said, separating their hands and dragging Amelia out of the bar.

Michael let out a sigh as he looked at Isabella, her eyes still brimming with tears. He gently lifted her up and escorted her out of the bar.

Once they were in the car, Isabella wiped her tears and asked, "Is Benjamin the one making Amelia cry?"

Michael was stunned, looking at Isabella's clear eyes. "Were you pretending to be drunk?"

Isabella nodded. "Didn't I tell you before? I can hold my liquor well! Amelia didn't get drunk, so how could I?"

"Then why were you crying with her?" Michael asked, feeling frustrated. He had really thought Isabella had gotten drunk and had an emotional breakdown.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "You just don't understand the bond between women! Now, tell me, was it Benjamin who upset Amelia? I've always felt there's something off about their relationship."

###chapter 128 Fiery Passion

Michael shrugged, glancing at Isabella. "Isabella, if Amelia didn't spill the beans about their relationship, do you really think Benjamin would clue me in?"

Isabella blinked, a bit taken aback. "Guys and girls think differently. I figured Benjamin would have told you."

Michael wrapped an arm around Isabella's neck and planted a kiss on her cheek. "Even though Benjamin and I are tight, people usually keep their messy family stuff to themselves. They think they can handle it solo and don't feel comfy sharing it with friends."

Isabella mulled it over, nodding in agreement, and let out a helpless sigh.

"Tell Benjamin, if he's involved and he hurts Amelia, I'll castrate him!" Isabella snapped.

Michael's mouth twitched. Amelia and Isabella were really close, which made the usually gentle Isabella speak up so fiercely for her.

"I'll pass on your message, but first, we should handle our own business." Michael's lips curled into a suggestive grin.

Isabella immediately caught on to what Michael meant. Blushing, she glared at him and whispered, "I just got a new job and became a leader at the company. We do need to celebrate."

Michael felt a rush of heat inside. If it weren't for the fact that their car was still in the parking lot with people around, he would have celebrated with Isabella right there.

Michael endured the growing heat in his body, pushing the car's speed to the limit. The black car sped down the street like lightning, cutting the usual half-hour drive home to just 18 minutes.

When Michael and Isabella entered the villa, Michael immediately locked the door, and they embraced and kissed passionately.

"Isabella, I could barely hold back in the car," Michael panted, his eyes burning with intensity as he looked at Isabella.

Isabella's eyes were equally intense, her heart racing. Her skin flushed with a light pink hue from the surge of desire.

"Then don't wait any longer. Let's start now." Isabella cupped Michael's head and kissed him passionately again.

As they kissed, their hands instinctively roamed over each other's bodies.

While they were kissing in the living room, Michael's hand slid down Isabella's back, slipping under her shirt to find the clasp of her bra. With a gentle tug, he unhooked it.

Isabella's breasts, freed from their confinement, were finally liberated. The bra fell to the floor and was kicked aside by Isabella.

Isabella, while kissing, also caressed Michael's firm chest. Her fingers traced over his chest muscles through his shirt, sending a faint shiver through him.

Then Isabella unbuttoned Michael's shirt and took it off.

Michael felt Isabella's soft hands on his chest, her gentle, slender fingers making his body temperature rise.

Michael's hands roamed over Isabella's chest, his fingers kneading and caressing her breasts. Under his touch, her full breasts changed shape like water-filled balloons.

Her nipples began to harden and erect under the stimulation. Each time Michael squeezed, he could feel the subtle firmness of her nipples brushing against his palms.

Isabella's desire surged with each touch, eliciting a soft moan.

Their lower bodies pressed tightly together, and Isabella could feel a firm bulge pressing against the front of her skirt-Michael's arousal was evident.

Isabella's hand stroked Michael's penis through his pants, feeling like she was touching a thick, hidden rod.

Isabella's actions made Michael lose control. Like a beast driven by lust, he lifted Isabella and placed her on the sofa.

With a swift movement, Michael lifted her skirt and removed her panties.

Isabella's round, full buttocks were raised high, her hands supporting her on the sofa, her position reminiscent of a submissive animal seeking affection.

Michael quickly removed his pants, exposing his penis. He leaned over Isabella from behind, kissing her, his tongue tracing along her earlobe and neck.

Both of them were breathing heavily, a sign of their rising arousal.

"Isabella, time for a real celebration," Michael said, his eyes burning with desire. He kneaded her buttocks firmly, then positioned himself, rubbing his penis between her buttocks.

The friction between his hot penis and her labia and anus intensified their arousal. Isabella's body responded instinctively; her originally pink labia began to darken and swell.

As the friction intensified, a sticky fluid seeped from Isabella's labia, coating Michael's penis.

Feeling the lubrication, Michael knew Isabella's body was ready.

"Isabella, I'm going in," Michael whispered, gently nibbling her earlobe before kissing her deeply again. With one hand, he guided himself to her entrance.

With a moan from Isabella, Michael pushed inside, her body yielding to him as he entered her.

The friction between his penis and her vagina drew out Isabella's moans. Her breasts bounced with each thrust as Michael's hips met her backside rhythmically.

The sofa, designed for sitting rather than such vigorous activity, creaked loudly under their movements, almost as if it were echoing their passion.

Michael's hands gripped Isabella's waist as he thrust deeply. In the privacy of the villa, they didn't hold back, Isabella's cries filling the room without fear of being overheard.

Their celebration lasted a full two hours.

###chapter 129 Angry Isabella

The next morning, Isabella was up early for work while Michael was still knocked out in bed. Last night had been wild, and it left him totally wiped. Even with his strong build, he couldn't keep up with Isabella's energy.

Blushing a bit, Isabella gently tucked the blanket around Michael and softly ran her hand over his waist. He had really outdone himself last night, making her super happy. But she knew they couldn't go that hard all the time-it could take a toll on Michael's health.

After getting ready, Isabella left the villa, and Leo was already waiting for her outside.

"Isabella, you're looking fantastic today," Leo said with a grin.

Isabella's cheeks turned a little pink; she did feel fantastic. Last night was incredible.

"Maybe it's because I got a good night's sleep," Isabella smiled and hopped into the car.

After Leo dropped her off at the company, his face turned serious. He noticed a car parked nearby, clearly there to keep an eye on Isabella.

Leo got out and hid in a corner, watching closely. He saw the driver pull out a camera and snap a few shots of Isabella before driving off.

Leo quickly got back in his car and tailed them. He eventually saw the car stop in front of a detective agency.

Leo immediately called Michael.

"Mr. Williams, should I teach this guy a lesson so he stops following Mrs. Williams?" Leo asked over the phone.

Michael got out of bed, stretched, and said, "This is probably Paxton's doing. Don't worry about the detective agency; just keep an eye on them. Even if you rough him up, there are plenty of other agencies. Just monitor him."

Michael hung up and got out of bed to wash up, feeling a slight twinge in his waist.

He chuckled to himself. "Damn it, am I really getting old?"

As he rubbed his waist, his phone rang again, and the caller made him frown.

It was Mason.

Michael answered, and Mason's voice came through.

"Michael, you've been back for a while now. Why haven't you come to see me? Don't tell me you're avoiding this old man?" Mason joked.

Michael laughed and replied, "No way, Mason. I've just been swamped lately, so I haven't had the chance to visit."

They chatted about work for a bit, then Mason asked, "I wanted to ask you yesterday, but got sidetracked by John's issue. Didn't you say you were going to bring your wife to see me? When can I meet her?"

Michael's smile faded, and he paused for a couple of seconds before replying, "Sure, tomorrow. She's still abroad and will be back tomorrow."

"Great, remember to come to the Williams Villa for dinner tomorrow," Mason said with a smile and hung up.

Michael's expression turned serious. He thought for a moment, then called Jerry. "Go to an international talent agency and find an unknown but beautiful actress. She needs to be a good actress and pretend to be my wife. Make it quick; I need her by tomorrow."

Jerry instinctively agreed but quickly realized something was off. Just as he was about to ask for more details, the call had already ended.

He looked at his phone and chuckled wryly. "Yesterday you had me break John's leg, and today you want me to find you a wife abroad. Does Isabella know about this?" Jerry muttered to himself, then quickly arranged for a private jet to fly out. Since Michael had given him this task, he had to get it done.

Jerry could pretty much guess why Michael needed a fake wife: he was probably meeting Mason.

Meanwhile, Isabella had no clue what Michael was up to. When she got to the office, she noticed her colleagues were unusually friendly.

Isabella figured it was probably because of the phones she handed out yesterday. She responded politely to their greetings.

But when she walked past Madeline, Madeline didn't even look up. Since Isabella and Dwayne had spread the news of her apology around the office, Madeline felt like everyone was mocking her, making her super embarrassed.

Isabella got to work in her office. An hour later, when she called Juliet to deliver a document, she noticed a red handprint on Juliet's face and tears in her eyes, like she had just been crying.

Isabella's expression changed immediately. She frowned and asked, "What happened to your face? Who hit you?"

Juliet bit her lip and finally decided to spill. Her voice was choked with emotion as she said, "There was a document that needed to be delivered to Madeline today. When I handed it to her, I accidentally bumped into her, and she spilled her coffee. Her assistant slapped me."

"Come with me," Isabella said, standing up and leading Juliet out of the office.

"Ms. Taylor, where are we going? Are we going to confront Madeline? Maybe we should just let it go. Her clothes cost way more than I can afford, so let's call it even," Juliet said anxiously behind Isabella.

"We're going to the security office to check the surveillance footage. Just because you splashed coffee on her clothes doesn't give her the right to slap you. I'll cover the cost of the outfit. Besides, you're my assistant. If someone hits you, it's like they're hitting me. This isn't just about you; it involves me too. I have to respond, or those people will get even more arrogant," Isabella said coldly as she led Juliet to the security office. At her request, the security guard pulled up the surveillance footage from the design department.

The footage confirmed Juliet's story. Isabella saved the video and then led Juliet back to the design department.

###chapter 130 New Conflicts

After getting back to her department, Isabella didn't rush to find Madeline. Instead, she headed straight to her boss, Dwayne.

She handed over the video she had prepared, and as Dwayne watched it, his face got all serious.

"So, what's your plan here?" Dwayne asked.

Isabella looked determined. "I want the company to take this seriously. We're a new company, and we've already had one scandal with that last evaluation mess. If we don't handle this right, it could blow up into another scandal. I'm pretty sure the boss wouldn't be thrilled to hear about workplace bullying going on here."

Dwayne nodded and told his secretary to bring in Madeline and her assistant.

Meanwhile, Madeline was in the office area, furiously trying to clean coffee stains off her clothes with disinfectant wipes. "That damn Juliet spilled coffee on me. Is she even using her eyes? She's as blind as that bitch Isabella, wandering around without looking."

Madeline's assistant, Thea Ellis, chimed in, "Ms. Eve, we could use this to put pressure on Isabella. Your outfit is really expensive. We could demand Juliet apologize and pay for it. If Isabella covers the cost, she'll take the hit. If not, Juliet will definitely resent her."

Thea's smile was sly. Her plan was pretty sneaky.

Juliet made the mistake, and Isabella didn't have to pay for it. But if Madeline brought it up to Isabella, it would put her in a tough spot. She wasn't obligated to help, but if she didn't, Juliet might hold a grudge. Classic human nature at its worst.

Madeline thought it was a smart move. But before she could decide when to use it, Dwayne's secretary came to tell them to go to Dwayne's office.

Madeline and Thea walked into Dwayne's office to find Isabella and Juliet already there.

Thea immediately sensed trouble.

Dwayne played the surveillance footage for Madeline and Thea.

Madeline's face turned dark. She glared at Isabella and said coldly, "So, you're here to report me?"

"Shouldn't you be reported? As a leader, you let workplace bullying happen. If the boss finds out, what do you think he'll do? Are we just going to sit around until this blows up in the media?" Isabella shot back, staring at Madeline.

"Don't try to scare me with the boss!" Madeline said in a low voice.

Isabella shot her a challenging look, a smirk playing on her lips. "Well, let's see how that goes."

Thea yelled, "Juliet spilled the coffee first!"

Isabella crossed her arms, her gaze fixed on Thea with an icy intensity. "The footage clearly shows Juliet accidentally bumped into the coffee. She apologized sincerely, but what did you do? You grabbed her, slapped her in front of everyone, and humiliated her. Isn't that workplace bullying?"

Isabella then looked at Madeline, whose face was now very unpleasant.

"I'm willing to cover the cleaning cost for your clothes. If the stains can't be removed, I'll compensate you for the full value on behalf of my assistant, Juliet. But you have to face the consequences of your actions too." Isabella then looked at Dwayne, hoping he'd make a fair call.

Juliet looked at Isabella with gratitude, touched by her support.

Dwayne didn't give a verdict right away. Instead, he turned to Madeline. "I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, Madeline, since it was your assistant, Thea, who hit Juliet."

Madeline clenched her fists and glared at Isabella. "I'm willing to compensate Juliet for emotional distress and apologize on Thea's behalf."

Dwayne then turned to Isabella. "Do you agree with this resolution, Isabella?"

Isabella shook her head immediately. "That's too lenient. Thea assaulted my subordinate Juliet in public, so you should apologize publicly. If this isn't handled properly, it could become a company scandal. My suggestion is to fire her."

Dwayne was taken aback by Isabella's harsh stance.

Madeline's face turned anxious. If Thea were fired, it would likely cause other subordinates to lose trust in her leadership.

"I don't think firing Thea is a good idea. Since Isabella mentioned this could become a scandal, wouldn't firing her only draw more attention to it?" Madeline said, looking at Dwayne.

Dwayne found this reasoning sound. He pondered for a few seconds, tapping his fingers lightly on the table. Finally, he came up with a compromise.

"In that case, we'll demote and reduce Thea's salary. Additionally, she will be required to make a formal apology within the design department. Let's keep this matter contained and minimize its impact," Dwayne said, looking at Isabella for her reaction.

Isabella thought for a moment, then nodded in agreement.

"Ms. Eve, please provide me with the receipt for the clothes, and I will reimburse you," Isabella said politely, smiling at Madeline.

Madeline's face was dark. "No need, Isabella. You win this time, but you won't be so lucky next time."

Thea looked pale, not expecting that a single slap to Juliet would result in her demotion and salary cut.

As Madeline and Isabella were about to leave Dwayne's office, Dwayne suddenly called them back.

"Madeline, Isabella, please have your assistants leave. I need to discuss something with you," Dwayne said.

Thea and Juliet left the office, and Madeline and Isabella looked at Dwayne, unsure of what he wanted to say.

Outside, Thea shot a venomous glare at Juliet. But Juliet no longer felt intimidated by Thea's icy stare; she knew Isabella would have her back.

"You're just as disgusting as your master," Thea hissed, leaning in close.

Juliet met her gaze with a cold smirk. "Isabella is my boss, not my master. If you enjoy being Madeline's lapdog, that's on you. I have no interest in that."

With that, Juliet turned on her heel, her victorious posture driving Thea nearly to madness.

"Just wait, you two bitches. I won't let this go!" Thea spat under her breath, stomping her foot in frustration before storming off.

Inside the office, Madeline and Isabella exchanged glances, unsure of what Dwayne was about to say.

Dwayne stood up and handed them a document. With a serious expression, he said, "Our company has recently developed a new cosmetic product, but some of its ingredients involve a patent held by a chemist named Kevin Hamilton. We need to purchase the usage rights from him. Due to the previous design competition scandal, Kevin has set a design requirement for us. Only if we meet this requirement will he agree to continue working with us. I'm assigning this task to both of you."

###chapter 131 Madeline's Conspiracy

Dwayne was originally going to hand the whole project over to Isabella. But with the design department now split into two camps, he had to think about the company's best interests. So, he decided to give the project to both Isabella and Madeline.

Madeline's eyes lit up. "Mr. Larson, I can totally handle this! I've worked with Mr. Hamilton before. When we were abroad, he even said my design style was exactly what he was looking for!"

Dwayne was taken aback by Madeline's experience.

"Alright then, show us what you got. And Isabella, you too, give it your all!" Dwayne said, making sure to be fair and give both of them a shot.

Isabella looked super serious because she knew this was her big chance to prove herself as the head of the design department. Nailing this project was the only way to really secure her position.

Madeline, on the other hand, was a bit miffed. She felt this project should've been hers alone, given her history with Kevin.

Madeline knew how crucial this was for Isabella, which is exactly why she wasn't going to let her have it easy.

Madeline suddenly turned to Isabella and said, "Isabella, how about a little bet?"

Isabella glanced at her and asked, "What kind of bet?"

"Let's see whose design Mr. Hamilton picks! If I win, I become the director, and you become my deputy! Deal?" Madeline said with a confident smirk.

Dwayne frowned. The fact that Madeline was bold enough to propose this bet meant she was in a strong position, which wasn't good for Isabella.

"Enough, this is a company project. We want healthy competition, not gambling," Dwayne scolded, trying to put an end to it.

But Isabella raised her hand to stop him. She looked at Madeline and asked, "Ms. Eve, if you lose, what then?"

Madeline didn't think she'd lose, but a bet's a bet.

"If I lose, I won't bother you or Juliet anymore, and I'll take on any tasks you give me seriously," Madeline said with a smile.

Isabella looked at her, a smile forming on her face. "Alright, let's have Mr. Larson as our witness."

"Are you sure? This isn't exactly in your favor," Dwayne said, puzzled by her decision.

Isabella nodded firmly. "I know a lot of people don't think I should be head of the design department. I want to use this chance to prove myself. If I'm not good enough, stepping down is only fair."

Madeline, for once, gave Isabella a thumbs up. "Isabella, you really are something!"

Dwayne sighed. Since Isabella agreed to the bet, he had no objections.

"Alright then, the bet is on. Isabella, I hope you give it your best," Dwayne said, waving them off.

After Isabella and Madeline left, Dwayne hesitated for a moment before dialing Michael's number.

Isabella's position was personally appointed by Michael. Even if Isabella wanted to resign, Dwayne had to let Michael know.

When Michael heard about the bet between Isabella and Madeline, he was quiet for a moment before saying he understood.

Dwayne sighed in relief; at least Michael wasn't mad at him.

After hanging up, Michael tapped his fingers on the desk. He knew Kevin well, and they had a good relationship. He wondered if he should help Isabella out.

In the end, Michael shook his head. He remembered Kevin's personality. Kevin was very particular about his work, so trying to sway his decision through their relationship was a no-go.

Although Michael couldn't directly make Isabella the winner, he could give her some extra support.

After leaving Dwayne's office, Isabella went back to her own. She carefully read through the documents in her hand.

Kevin was a genius in chemistry, holding numerous invention patents used in various scientific fields. He even owned a research company. Since he didn't develop products in the cosmetics industry, he licensed related patents to other cosmetics companies.

The goal of this design project was to create a new look for Kevin's products to improve their market value.

Meanwhile, Madeline found her assistant, Thea.

"Go and doctor all the files on Kevin, including the company's research on what he likes. I want to make sure Isabella falls into a trap she can't escape," Madeline said, a malicious glint in her eyes.

Thea nodded and got to work immediately. She had just been demoted and had her salary cut, so she was eager to vent her frustration.

Isabella finished reading the documents and started searching the company's internal database for information on Kevin.

But after reading the info, Isabella frowned deeply. "Kevin's taste is so unique? Fluorescent pink and red with green? My God, who would come up with this combination?"

Isabella sensed something was off. She closed the internal data and searched online for Kevin's product designs over the years.

She found that the online information was completely different from the company's internal data.

"Madeline, you are truly malicious." Isabella angrily slapped the table. It was obvious the internal data had been tampered with, and the only person who could have done it was Madeline.

"Is Madeline planning to beat me this way? How ridiculous." Isabella sneered and continued to search for information about Kevin online.

As she read more and more, her understanding of Kevin's preferences grew deeper.

###chapter 132 Kevin's Wife

Changing someone's hobbies and habits is tough, but their tastes and opinions can shift over time.

Isabella was checking out footage of Kevin at different business events over the years, paying close attention to his clothes and accessories. From these, she could get a sense of what Kevin liked.

Then, something caught her eye.

No matter the event, Kevin's wife was always with him. With her designer instincts kicking in, Isabella quickly pulled up the product designs from Kevin's company over the years.

"All these designs go perfectly with his wife's jewelry!" Isabella grinned.

She jumped online to dig up info on Kevin's wife but only found out her name was Gabrielle Nguyen and she was from Thalassia.

Leaning back in her chair, Isabella crossed her arms and frowned. "Kevin's company's past designs were all his work. He's a pretty good designer, and it looks like his inspiration comes from Gabrielle's style. Kevin clearly loves Gabrielle, but there's hardly any info about her. Plus, Kevin's never mentioned that his design ideas come from Gabrielle. So, I can guess that Gabrielle doesn't like being in the spotlight! This complicates things."

Isabella rubbed her temples and called Dwayne to see if he had any more info on Kevin's wife.

Dwayne was a bit surprised when he got Isabella's call, then shook his head. "Sorry, Isabella. All I know is that Mr. Hamilton has a wife. I don't even know her name."

Isabella hung up, feeling a bit let down. She'd have to find another way.

After hanging up, Dwayne thought for a moment before calling Michael to fill him in.

"I get it. Tell Isabella there's a scientific banquet tomorrow at 6 PM on the 17th floor of the Skyline Tower. Kevin and Gabrielle will be there," Michael said before hanging up.

Michael smiled, impressed that Isabella had quickly figured out the link between Kevin and Gabrielle. He had planned to find a way to subtly give Isabella this clue.

"My wife is incredibly sharp," Michael said proudly.

Just then, Michael got a message from Jerry with a woman's profile and photo.

Michael looked at the photo and info, his expression tightening a bit. This was the fake marriage candidate Jerry had picked for him.

The woman was Estella Foster, a little-known actress from abroad. She was decent-looking, but not as stunning as Isabella. Jerry chose her because Estella's personal life was pretty clean, no scandals. Plus, she was desperate to become famous; her dream was to be an international star.

Michael was pleased with Jerry's choice. People with strong ambitions were easier to control, so he decided to have Estella play the role of his fake wife.

After shooting a message to Jerry, Michael put his phone down and took a deep breath.

He wasn't ready to spill all the beans just yet. He needed more time to strengthen his bond with Isabella. By then, even if his true identity came out, she'd be more likely to accept him.

Meanwhile, Dwayne, following Michael's orders, contacted Isabella to brief her on the event Kevin and Gabrielle would be attending.

"Mr. Larson, how did you know about this event? Didn't you say you didn't know much about Kevin and his wife Gabrielle?" Isabella asked, confused.

Dwayne pointed upwards. "I don't know, but someone else does. The boss asked me to pass this info to you."

Isabella paused for a moment; she knew exactly who Dwayne was talking about. It was none other than John's uncle, the most famous and mysterious man abroad.

But she couldn't figure out why John's uncle was still willing to help her, especially since she had broken off her engagement with John.

'Could it be that Mr. Williams is helping me out of respect for Mason? That's possible. Or maybe he really values this project and wants me to create the best design to keep the partnership with Mr. Hamilton alive,' Isabella thought, feeling she'd cracked the case.

Although Isabella didn't have any special feelings for the mysterious Mr. Williams, she was very grateful for the opportunity he provided, so she had to take this task seriously.

"Mr. Larson, please thank Mr. Williams for me," Isabella said with a smile before leaving the office.

Back in her own office, Isabella immediately reviewed photos and videos of Kevin and Gabrielle at various events, trying to figure out Gabrielle's preferences.

Suddenly, she noticed a clue. At various business events, the hosts always provided refreshments. But Gabrielle always held a glass of juice, indicating she didn't like alcohol. But on one occasion, she was holding a glass of red wine, and she seemed to enjoy it, frequently taking sips.

Isabella quickly searched online for the event's host and called to ask about the name of the red wine.

The person on the other end was very friendly and immediately told Isabella the name of the wine.

After hanging up, Isabella searched online but only found that the wine came from the Aurora Continent, with no other information.

Isabella covered her forehead and smiled wryly. "Oh my, where am I supposed to find this wine?"

The wine that Gabrielle liked wasn't from an expensive brand; it was simply made but tasted very good. Its rarity, due to low production and limited distribution, made it difficult to obtain. Isabella had never heard of this wine before.

Scratching her head, Isabella suddenly remembered Scarlett's family had given her a vineyard as an apology when she was in Seraphim.

Since Isabella didn't know how to manage a vineyard, she had asked Michael to find someone to manage it for her. Maybe Michael would know something about this wine.

###chapter 133 Unexpected Delight

Michael was just about to head out for work when his phone buzzed. It was Isabella.

When she started asking about the wine, he couldn't help but chuckle.

"Seriously, you don't know which winery makes that wine?" Michael asked, still laughing.

Isabella frowned. "The wineries I know are all in Solstice. I'm clueless about the ones in Seraphim. I thought you might know, so I called. What's so funny?"

She was starting to get annoyed, thinking he was making fun of her.

After a good laugh, Michael said, "Wow, you're clueless! You don't need me; you can totally handle this yourself."

"Is it sold in this city? Just give me the address, and I'll go grab a bottle." Isabella pulled out a pen, ready to jot it down.

Michael shook his head. "Okay, okay, I'll cut it out. Remember the winery Scarlett gave you as an apology?"

"Yeah, I remember, but I'm not really into wine, so..." Isabella's eyes suddenly widened as it hit her.

"Don't tell me that wine is from my winery!" she exclaimed, jumping up from her chair.

Michael nodded. "Yep. As the owner, you can have as many bottles as you want."

Isabella couldn't help but laugh and facepalmed. She'd been searching high and low for this wine, only to find out it was from her own place.

"But can they get it to me in time? I need it by tomorrow afternoon," she said, starting to worry.

Michael thought for a moment and then smiled. "Jerry's flying back tonight. I can ask him to bring it."

"That's awesome, thanks, Michael!" Isabella said, her voice full of relief.

"Just a 'thanks'? Is that all I get?" Michael's voice had a teasing tone, with a hint of something more.

Isabella's cheeks turned pink. "Once I'm done with this project, I'll celebrate with you properly!"

Her voice had a seductive edge that made Michael's heart race for a moment.

After hanging up, Michael took a deep breath to calm down. "Isabella's amazing, but I need to take it easy. Not as young as I used to be."

He gave a resigned pat on his waist and got into his car.

The next day came quickly. Isabella drove to the building where the banquet was happening. She parked by the curb and waited in her car.

She had thought about going inside to find Kevin and Gabrielle, but the event was invite-only, and most of the guests were from the scientific community, a world she wasn't part of.

'Guess I'll have to wait until the banquet's over to find Kevin and Gabrielle and give them the wine,' Isabella thought, tapping her fingers on the steering wheel in frustration.

Truth be told, she was pretty nervous. Dropping by unannounced like this could come off as rude.

Just then, Isabella spotted a car pulling into the parking lot. The person who stepped out was none other than her husband, Michael.

As Michael walked out of the lot, he noticed a familiar car parked by the roadside. He paused, then headed over to Isabella's car.

Michael opened the door and slid into the passenger seat. "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?"

"I took the day off. I have an important client to meet today. And what about you?" Isabella asked, confused.

Michael pointed to the building. "I'm here for a scientific exchange banquet."

Isabella's eyes widened. "You got an invite to that banquet? But you're not a scientist. How did you get in?"

Michael lightly tapped her forehead. "Don't underestimate me. Remember that time I fixed your computer? I studied physics and information engineering. I'm totally qualified. Plus, a famous chemist friend of mine recommended me."

Isabella's breath caught, a bold guess forming in her mind. She grabbed Michael's hand, anxious. "Is your chemist friend... Kevin, by any chance?"

Michael feigned surprise. "How did you know? Wait, is he the client you're meeting? Why didn't you go inside?"

"Because I don't have an invitation," Isabella said, her face reddening with frustration. She'd spent all day trying to get in, only to realize the solution was right in front of her.

"You have an invitation! Why didn't you tell me earlier?" Isabella playfully slapped Michael's arm, pouting.

Michael shrugged. "You didn't ask."

Isabella bit her lip and glared at him, not saying a word. Michael chuckled, copied the electronic invitation from his phone, and sent it to hers.

"Come on, join me as my plus-one." Michael smiled, got out of the car, and Isabella quickly followed.

"Wait, I need to change. I can't go in dressed like this," Isabella said, looking nervously at her business attire. She worried it might offend Kevin and his wife.

Michael understood. He pointed to his own casual suit and smiled. "Most people here are from the scientific community. They don't have strict dress codes. Some even wear jeans and T-shirts. It's not a formal dinner; just be casual."

Hearing this, Isabella felt relieved. She took Michael's arm, and they walked into the building together.

As soon as they entered the lobby, Michael suddenly slapped his forehead.

"You go up first. I'll catch up. I just realized I need to use the restroom!" Michael hurriedly headed to the restroom.

Once inside, his expression turned serious, and he dialed Jerry's number.

###chapter 134 Isabella's Rhythm

So, Michael wasn't really here for the banquet. Sure, he got an invite, but he had zero plans to actually attend. The real reason he showed up was because Jerry had brought Estella back from overseas, and she was crashing at a hotel right next door.

Michael showed up a couple of hours before the banquet was supposed to kick off. He figured he could dodge Isabella by arriving early, but surprise, surprise, they bumped into each other near the parking lot.

Michael had to think on his feet. He decided to take Isabella to the banquet first, while Jerry kept Estella busy for a bit.

Meanwhile, in the hotel's presidential suite, Estella was nervously perched on the sofa, with Jerry sitting across from her.

Jerry picked up Michael's call and nodded after hearing that Michael would be running late.

Estella asked cautiously, "Mr. Nelson, was that Mr. Williams on the phone?"

Jerry nodded. "Yeah, Mr. Williams has some stuff to handle and might be late. He asked you to hang tight here for a while."

Estella didn't object-or rather, she didn't dare to. She knew her shot at stardom was riding on Michael, the business whiz.

The room got quiet, and things felt a bit awkward. Jerry cleared his throat to get Estella's attention.

"Since Mr. Williams can't make it right now, why don't you go over what I told you again? Refresh your memory. Mr. Williams isn't a fan of repeating himself," Jerry suggested, looking at Estella.

Estella nodded and recited everything Jerry had told her earlier.

"My marriage to Mr. Williams is fake. It's all just to keep his family happy! I must not publicize our marriage or use his status to do anything that could harm his reputation. Until the contract expires, I can't date or get involved with anyone else!" Estella finished and looked at Jerry, her eyes cautious.

Jerry nodded approvingly. "Good, you got it all down. As long as you stick to this, Mr. Williams will help you reach your dreams."

Estella clenched her fists, nodding excitedly. Then she asked curiously, "Can I ask why Mr. Williams is doing this?"

Jerry's expression turned cold. "Don't ask questions that aren't your business."

Estella immediately nodded, looking scared. "Sorry, I asked too much."

When Michael came out of the restroom, he was surprised to find Isabella hadn't taken the elevator up.

"Didn't I ask you to wait for me upstairs? Why are you still here? Do you think the invite I gave you is fake?" Michael joked.

Isabella rolled her eyes and pulled Michael into the elevator. "I don't get any of that science stuff. What if people think I'm some kind of scientist and start asking me professional questions I can't answer? That would be so embarrassing. It's better to stick with you. At least you look more like a scientist than I do."

Michael could feel Isabella's grip on his arm tighten, sensing her nerves.

He smiled but didn't call her out on it.

When the elevator dinged open on the conference floor, Isabella followed Michael out.

Just like Michael had said, the banquet was pretty laid-back. No one was dressed up too fancy; everyone was keeping it casual.

Scientists were mingling, chatting away, and some were gathered around listening to someone talk about their latest invention or discovery.

Isabella quickly spotted Kevin and Gabrielle among the crowd. She'd been studying their profiles for the past couple of days and knew exactly what they looked like.

Suddenly, Kevin noticed Michael. He grabbed Gabrielle and walked over with a big smile. "Mr. Williams, wow, it's been years! I can't believe you actually showed up."

Michael smiled and hugged Kevin. "Yeah, it's been a while. Mrs. Hamilton, you look as stunning as ever. Let me introduce you to my wife, Isabella."

Isabella greeted Kevin and Gabrielle politely. Before her family hit hard times, she had attended numerous formal dinners, so she understood the propriety of a more gradual approach to her request.

"I can't believe you're married! When did this happen? Why didn't you tell me? That's really not cool-I didn't get a wedding invite!" Kevin said, sounding a bit miffed.

Michael waved it off with a laugh. "It's just paperwork for now. We haven't had the actual wedding yet because I've been swamped. But don't worry, when we do have the ceremony, you'll definitely be on the guest list."

Kevin finally smiled, looking satisfied. He turned to Isabella and asked, "So, where do you work, Isabella? I'm curious about the lucky lady who snagged Mr. Williams."

Isabella felt a spark of excitement. Kevin's question was the perfect opening to mention her company and steer the conversation her way.

"I work at Luminous Beauty, and I'm the director of the design department," Isabella said, stopping there. Kevin was sharp; she didn't need to over-explain. He'd get the hint.

As she expected, Kevin hesitated when she mentioned Luminous Beauty, giving her a knowing look. "I'm quite familiar with that company."

Isabella smiled and didn't push further, instead giving Michael's arm a gentle squeeze.

Michael got the message. He smiled and extended his hand to Kevin. "Let's head over there and chat. I've got some academic questions I'd love to discuss with you. No need to bore the ladies with that stuff."

Kevin nodded with a smile and turned to the ladies. "Gabrielle, Isabella, hope you have a nice chat."

Gabrielle returned a warm smile.

###chapter 135 I Do Love her a Lot

After Kevin and Michael wandered off, Isabella made her way over to Gabrielle.

"Hey there, Mrs. Hamilton. You and your husband have such an amazing relationship," Isabella said, switching to Thalassian.

Gabrielle looked a bit surprised but responded in Thalassian too, "I didn't know Mrs. Williams spoke Thalassian!"

Isabella grinned. She knew Gabrielle hadn't been back to Thalassia much since she left with Kevin and had been speaking Avalonian for years.

Isabella used Thalassian to make Gabrielle feel more at home and to get closer to her.

"Thalassia is such a beautiful place. I visited once and even thought about moving there," Isabella shared, reminiscing about her time in Thalassia.

As a Taylor, Isabella had picked up a bunch of languages, including Thalassian.

While Isabella and Gabrielle were hitting it off, Michael and Kevin were having their own chat.

"Michael, you didn't bring Isabella just to catch up with an old friend, did you?" Kevin asked with a knowing grin.

Michael chuckled. "You got me. Isabella's actually the brains behind the design of your new product."

"You know I don't let personal stuff cloud my judgment," Kevin said, swirling his wine.

Michael took a sip and replied, "I have total faith in Isabella. She's just here to get a feel for your preferences for the design."

Kevin raised an eyebrow. "That's all?"

Michael nodded and smiled. "Yep, that's all there is to it."

Kevin laughed heartily. "I'm really curious about what kind of magic Isabella has to win you over. You usually don't get involved in these small matters, so you must really love her."

"You're right, I do love her a lot," Michael said, glancing tenderly at Isabella across the room.

Isabella, who was deep in conversation with Gabrielle, felt Michael's gaze. She turned, blushing as she smiled and nodded at him.

"It really takes me back to when we were young. Gabrielle and I used to be just like that," Kevin said, a bit nostalgic.

Meanwhile, Isabella and Gabrielle were engrossed in their chat. They talked about everything from Thalassian customs to local crafts and even its cultural spirit.

Isabella mentioned that the romantic vibe in Thalassia was unmatched by Solstice, and she liked to call Thalassia the Country of Romance, a sentiment Gabrielle agreed with.

"Speaking of Solstice, their romance might not compare to Thalassia, but their wine is pretty good," Isabella said, smoothly shifting the topic to wine.

Gabrielle showed a hint of regret. "Their wine is good, but I don't drink much, so I can't offer a detailed opinion. However, I have had an exceptional wine on one occasion-a truly rare and difficult-to-find vintage."

A spark of excitement lit up Isabella's eyes. After all this time, she could finally bring up the wine she had in mind.

"I have a vineyard on the Aurora Continent that produces a really nice wine. I think you'd like it. I'm not sure if it's the one you had in mind, but I'd love to give you a bottle for you and Mr. Hamilton to try," Isabella offered, keeping it casual. It wasn't a grand gesture, but she was confident that once Gabrielle tasted it, her plan would be halfway there.

Unaware that the wine Isabella had mentioned was her favorite, Gabrielle accepted the gift with a smile, thinking it was just a friendly gesture.

Meanwhile, Michael and Kevin were deep in conversation when Michael's phone buzzed.

Michael glanced at the caller ID; it was Jerry. He quickly stepped aside to take the call.

"Jerry, what's up?" Michael asked, knowing Jerry wouldn't call without a good reason.

Jerry's tone was serious, "Mr. Williams, my team just reported that Mr. Mason Williams is ready for the family dinner and is waiting for you. You should be getting his message soon."

Michael's expression darkened. "Got it. I'm on my way."

After hanging up, Michael walked over to Isabella and said with a smile, "Isabella, enjoy your time with Mrs. Hamilton. There's something urgent at the company I need to handle."

Isabella blinked but didn't press for details, simply telling Michael to be careful.

Leaving the banquet, Michael headed to a nearby hotel and met Estella in the presidential suite.

Upon seeing Michael, a man renowned in the business world for his enigmatic nature, Estella was struck by his striking appearance.

Michael didn't waste any time. "Did you remember everything Jerry told you?" he asked coldly.

Estella, nervous but determined, nodded quickly. "Yes! We met in a bar where some thugs were bothering me, and you stepped in to help. We didn't talk much then. Later, at a banquet where I was performing, we met again. Feeling a special connection, we exchanged numbers, and eventually, we fell in love and got married."

Estella delivered the script Jerry had provided, a document detailing even the most minute aspects of Michael's preferences, down to the presence or absence of leg hair and a possible mole on his buttocks.

At first, Michael was pleased with Estella's performance. But when she started mentioning private details, he shot a fierce glare at Jerry.

Jerry awkwardly touched his nose. As Michael's most trusted subordinate, they'd been to hot springs together many times, so he knew a lot about Michael's body.

'If I knew how long you lasted in bed with Isabella, I would have included that in the script too, along with your favorite positions,' Jerry thought smugly as he rubbed his nose.

###chapter 136 Introducing the Fake Wife

Jerry was feeling pretty good about his plan, even though it did kind of intrude on Michael's privacy. He figured Mason, being the sharp guy he was, might actually dig into those personal details.

After making sure Estella wouldn't cause any drama, Michael stepped out and called Isabella, letting her know he'd be working late and wouldn't be home.

Isabella understood and said she'd had a pleasant conversation with Gabrielle, who had invited her to their hotel for a chat.

"Alright, let's go. Time to meet my uncle, Mason. And remember, don't say anything you shouldn't," Michael said, giving Estella a stern look before leading her out.

Estella stuck close to Michael, keeping her head down and staying quiet. She felt a wave of nerves hit her as she got into the car.

During the drive, Michael didn't say a word, and Estella didn't dare ask any questions. She just nervously clutched the hem of her dress to calm herself.

Finally, they pulled up to the Williams Villa.

Once out of the car, Michael bent his arm, and Estella quickly linked hers with his.

Mason and John were at the entrance to greet them. John, who had his leg broken by Jerry last time, wasn't too badly hurt and was now in a wheelchair with a cast.

Feigning surprise, Michael asked John, "What happened to your leg?"

John's face turned a bit awkward.

Mason walked over with a smile and said, "John got drunk and crashed his car. It's nothing serious. By the way, is this your wife?"

Michael glanced at Estella.

Estella smiled and stepped forward to greet Mason. "Hello, Mr. Williams. I'm Michael's wife, Estella Foster."

"Ms. Foster, you're indeed very beautiful. Dinner's ready. Let's head inside and chat," Mason said, inviting them in. Estella naturally linked her arm with Michael's again.

Charles pushed John's wheelchair, following Mason. As Mason turned, he gave Charles a meaningful look, and Charles nodded, understanding perfectly.

Mason's look was a signal for Charles to check if Estella was really Michael's wife. As Mason's long-serving butler, Charles knew exactly what to do.

After Charles wheeled John into the villa, he turned back to start his investigation.

"Hello, Ms. Foster," John said politely, shaking hands with Estella.

Estella was super nervous, but she kept her cool. Aspiring to be an international actress, she had trained her acting skills well.

Mason sat at the dining table and smiled at Estella, asking, "Ms. Foster, how did you and Michael meet? Could you share your love story?"

Michael's face softened with a gentle smile as he looked at Estella. Estella smiled and nodded.

"We first met at a bar..." Estella began, recounting the story Jerry had given her.

When she mentioned how Michael saved her and their second encounter at a banquet, she smiled tenderly at Michael, and he held her hand in response. They looked just like a real couple.

"Ah, a classic hero rescuing the damsel. Sounds like fate had a hand in it," John said, raising his glass with a smile.

Estella raised her glass too, noticing a flicker of disdain in John's eyes when he realized she was just a minor actress.

But Estella didn't let it bother her. Compared to these powerful families, she knew she was small potatoes.

"Michael, let Ms. Foster try this wine. It's from our vineyard, and it's pretty good," Mason said, handing Michael a bottle of opened red wine.

Michael nodded with a smile and poured some into Estella's glass.

Estella instinctively said, "Thank you, Mr. Williams."

Michael's eyelid twitched slightly.

Mason looked at Estella with a smile and said, "You're already married. Why so formal?"

Estella's heart skipped a beat; her response had been purely instinctive.

But Michael quickly smiled and said, "At home, we're much more casual. She's just a bit nervous meeting you for the first time."

As he spoke, he gently squeezed Estella's hand, as if to encourage her. Estella shyly nodded at Mason.

"Sorry, Mr. Mason Williams. I am a bit nervous," Estella said with a smile.

Mason took a sip of wine and waved his hand dismissively. "I'm just an old man nearing the end of his days. What's there to be nervous about? By the way, Ms. Foster, you mentioned you're from the Aurora Continent. You must have met Michael's father, right?"

Estella nodded. "Yes, his father, Kenna, is a very kind and humorous gentleman."

Mason's eyes lost some of their sparkle, as if he was recalling unpleasant memories. He sighed and said, "It's been ages since I've seen my brother, Kenna. The last time was probably when Michael was born - I visited him then. Speaking of which, Michael has a butterfly-shaped birthmark on his buttocks. I thought it was pretty funny back then."

Mason laughed after saying this. Michael's pupils contracted slightly; he had no such birthmark.

Estella smiled and said, "Mr. Williams, are you sure you're not mistaken? Michael doesn't have a birthmark on his buttocks."

Mason looked momentarily confused, then laughed and slapped his forehead. "I'm getting old and forgetful. It was John who has the birthmark, not Michael."

John, sipping his wine, was taken aback. He didn't have a birthmark either. Just as he was about to say something, Mason gave him a stern look. John immediately understood that Mason had his reasons for saying this, so he kept quiet and continued eating.

"We're eating here. Can we not discuss my buttocks? Can't you change the subject?" Michael rolled his eyes, feeling exasperated.

Michael breathed a sigh of relief. Luckily, Jerry had been smart and told Estella some personal things about him. Otherwise, Estella not knowing about the birthmark would've been really suspicious.

###chapter 137 Mason's Suspicion 

Michael felt a bit down after the meal. Mason had been grilling Estella, which meant he might've picked up on something.

Estella was on edge. She noticed Mason's questions, but luckily, Jerry had prepped her well, so she managed to handle it.

As dinner wrapped up, Mason had the table cleared, and a maid brought in some tea.

"Michael, since you're not around much, why not stick around a bit longer? I'll have the maid set up rooms for you two," Mason suggested with a smile.

Michael smiled and nodded, but Estella looked uneasy and glanced at him.

"Michael, did you forget something?" Estella whispered.

Mason caught her concern and asked with a grin, "What's up? Ms. Foster, don't you want to stay?"

Estella blushed and quickly explained, "I'm really sorry, Mr. Williams. I'm in the middle of filming a movie. Michael said you wanted to see me, so I took a day off to come here. I have to fly back to Seraphim tonight to finish shooting."

Michael hesitated, then nodded. "Yeah, Mason, this movie is a big deal for Estella. She's working with some big stars and a famous director. It's her first major role. If she's late, it could really hurt her reputation."

They said this to keep Mason from getting suspicious and to make sure Estella could leave quickly after her part.

But they weren't lying; the director and actors were legit. Michael had pulled some strings to get Estella a significant supporting role, which was also a kind of advance payment for her.

Hearing this, Mason didn't feel right keeping Estella any longer.

"Alright, I guess we'll have to catch up next time," Mason said with a smile.

"It's getting late; we should head out," Michael said, tapping his watch and looking at Estella.

Estella nodded, stood up, and smiled at Mason. "Mr. Williams, I'm really sorry about this. Once I wrap up my work, I'll be back to see you and bring some gifts."

"Just having you here is enough; no need for gifts," Mason said with a smile as he stood up to see them off.

John wheeled himself next to Mason. After watching Michael and Estella drive away, John couldn't hold back his curiosity.

"Grandpa, it seemed like you were testing Michael and Estella just now," John asked, puzzled.

Mason's smile faded. He didn't answer John but looked at his watch, as if waiting for something.

After a while, Charles came hurrying over.

"Mr. Mason Williams, I've checked. Ms. Foster and Mr. Michael Williams are indeed married. Their marriage is registered in Aurora Continent. Ms. Foster is really an actress, and she recently took on a major film project, though only as a supporting role," Charles reported solemnly.

John's eyes went wide with shock as he looked at Mason. "Grandpa, you actually had someone dig into Estella. Why'd you do that?"

Mason waved Charles away and said seriously, "Because I think their marriage is a sham. Michael brought Estella here to fool me."

John was even more confused. "Why would he do that? Unless the woman he's really married to is someone special and he doesn't want us to know about her?"

Mason, surprised, smiled. "If such a woman exists, who do you think she could be?"

John furrowed his brows, thinking hard. Suddenly, his face lit up as if he had figured it out.

"Aha! Maybe his real wife is older-like, fifties or sixties! He's probably worried we'll all freak out about the age difference!" John's eyes lit up.

Mason was practically spitting mad at how dumb John was being. He gripped his cane tightly, raised it high, but then sighed and put it down, seeing John still had his leg in a cast.

"Alright, there's nothing more for you here. You can go now," Mason waved his hand, signaling a servant to take John away.

After John left, still puzzled, Mason sighed.

"I sure hope you didn't marry Isabella. That would make things really awkward," Mason grumbled, shaking his head. He then called Charles back.

"Spread the news about Michael's marriage and Estella's identity," Mason instructed Charles solemnly.

Charles nodded and went to make the arrangements.

Meanwhile, Isabella, after chatting with Kevin and Gabrielle, learned about their preferences, especially Gabrielle's.

When Isabella brought out the wine she had prepared, Gabrielle wasn't exactly thrilled. But when she smelled the familiar aroma and tasted the wine, her eyes lit up.

"Oh my God, I can't believe the wine I've been searching for all these years is produced by Isabella's winery," Gabrielle said excitedly.

Isabella smiled and said, "Mrs. Hamilton, if you like it, I'll send you some every year."

"Thank you so much. I'm only into your wine," Gabrielle said gratefully.

Kevin, who had been silent, sighed. "Isabella, you gave us wine as a gift because you want to work with me, right?"

Gabrielle's expression shifted. She knew Kevin well enough to realize he wasn't easily swayed by gifts.

However, Isabella's face was full of confidence. "Please rest assured, Mr. Hamilton. I'm not trying to bribe you into a partnership. I just want to be friends, and I think our work speaks for itself."

Kevin looked at the confidence on Isabella's face and recalled that Michael had said the same thing to him.

A smile appeared on Kevin's face. "I'm eager to see what you've got to show me."

###chapter 138 Benjamin's Sadness 

Isabella hung out in Kevin and Gabrielle's room for a bit before heading out of the hotel. Kevin even walked her downstairs himself.

They planned to check out Isabella's company in a couple of days to see the final product.

But Isabella had no clue that one of her colleagues saw Kevin walking her out.

Meanwhile, after leaving the Williams Family estate, Michael and Estella hit up a bar.

"You did great earlier. Good luck with your next film. The driver will take you to the airport soon. Just keep playing your part, and I'll keep my promise," Michael said, stepping out of the car without looking back at Estella.

Estella watched him go, wanting to say something but staying silent, just giving him a quick goodbye.

On her way to the airport, Estella was all mixed up inside. What kind of woman could snag a guy like Michael? And who was this mystery woman he was hiding from his family?

Her curiosity about Michael's wife was growing.

At the bar, Michael headed straight to a private room where Benjamin was waiting.

"You're here. How was the family dinner?" Benjamin asked, sprawled on the sofa with his shirt undone and tie tossed aside.

Benjamin looked like he'd had way too much to drink; his face was flushed, and he reeked of booze. Empty bottles were scattered all around him.

Michael frowned, confused by Benjamin's messy state. If Benjamin hadn't called him, Michael would already be home chatting with Isabella.

"Not bad, we managed to fool Mason for now," Michael said, sitting down next to Benjamin and cracking open a beer.

Benjamin nodded. "It takes time. They both need to adjust and gradually accept it. But John hurt Isabella too much. Otherwise, she wouldn't have sworn off marrying into the Williams Family."

Michael rubbed his temples. Every time he thought about it, he wanted to break John's other leg.

"Enough about me. What's up with you? Why are you drinking here?" Michael put his beer on the table and turned to Benjamin.

Benjamin gave a bitter smile. "What else? It's about relationships."

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Trouble with Amelia?"

Benjamin's smile turned even more bitter. "What else? Do you know what she said to me? She said our relationship was all just about sex, nothing more. She doesn't care about me at all!"

By the end, Benjamin was furious. He threw the bottle in his hand to the ground, but it didn't break because of the soft carpet.

"To her, am I just a convenient sex toy?" Benjamin yelled, clearly frustrated.

Michael hesitated, then offered a consoling pat on Benjamin's shoulder. He felt like he had no place to comment on Benjamin's relationship issues, especially since Benjamin had helped him sort out his own stuff with Isabella.

"There's this saying I read online, 'Those who advise on love rarely experience it firsthand.' Seems to fit you pretty well," Michael said with a shrug.

Benjamin let out a bitter laugh and took another swig from his bottle. "I haven't felt this way about a woman in forever, and she completely shattered me."

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Isn't it a bit early to say that? I don't know Amelia well, but she doesn't strike me as the type to sleep with just any guy. Women think differently from men; they keep things hidden and have complex views on relationships."

Benjamin suddenly slammed his bottle on the table, eyes wide. "You mean Amelia might actually like me but doesn't know how to deal with her feelings?"

Michael shrugged. "Maybe she was hurt by her ex and is wary of relationships now. But that's just a guess; I don't know much about her past."

"That must be it! Michael, my love life depends on you now," Benjamin said, grabbing Michael's hand seriously.

Michael's mouth twitched. He knew exactly what Benjamin wanted.

Isabella, being Amelia's good friend, probably knew about her past. Benjamin wanted Michael to get the scoop from Isabella to come up with a plan.

Seeing Benjamin's disheveled state, Michael sighed. "Alright, I'll ask her for you."

Benjamin smiled gratefully.

Michael thought for a moment. Looking at the drunken Benjamin, he had an idea.

Michael pulled out his phone and called Isabella. "Isabella, I'll send you an address. Can you come pick me up? Also, bring someone to take Benjamin home. He's had a rough time, and I'm here having a drink with him."

Isabella had just gotten home and was about to take a bath when she got Michael's call. Without hesitation, she drove to find him.

Isabella had called Amelia for help. But when Amelia heard it was Benjamin who needed a ride, she hesitated and then outright refused.

Although Isabella sensed something unusual, she couldn't leave Benjamin at the bar. So, she called her driver, Leo, and offered him extra pay to help pick up Benjamin.

When Michael saw that it wasn't Amelia who came to pick up Benjamin, he felt a twinge of disappointment for his friend.

"Why do you look unhappy?" Isabella asked curiously.

"It's not me who's unhappy; it's Benjamin." Michael shrugged, opening the car door and tossing the drunken Benjamin inside.

###chapter 139 Isabella's Discovery

Isabella watched as Michael practically tossed Benjamin into the car, raising an eyebrow.

'Guess this is how guys show their friendship,' she thought.

Michael didn't seem to care if Benjamin hit his head or not.

"Thanks, Leo," Isabella said politely.

"No problem. I'll make sure Mr. White gets home safe," Leo nodded, giving Michael a quick glance.

After Leo left, Michael slumped into the front passenger seat, and Isabella got in the driver's seat.

As she started the car and headed home, she asked, "Did Benjamin get wasted because of Amelia?"

Michael's eyebrow twitched. "What makes you say that?"

Isabella grinned. "When you called me to pick up Benjamin, you really wanted me to send Amelia, didn't you?"

Michael smirked, leaning against the window. "Correct! But how'd you figure it out?"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "I did call Amelia, but when she heard it was Benjamin, she flat-out refused. Her excuse was lame-she said she was on her period and couldn't exert herself. I know her cycle better than she does! And she knows mine just as well."

Michael's smile turned mischievous. "I know it too."

Isabella blushed and shot Michael a glare. "I'm trying to be serious here."

"So am I," Michael chuckled, reaching out to play with Isabella's hair.

Isabella's blush deepened, and her heart started to race.

"I'm driving. Don't distract me," she said, moving his hand away.

"Women's intuition is sharp. I've noticed something off between Amelia and Benjamin lately. When I saw Amelia drinking at the bar, I realized she must have feelings for him," Isabella explained.

Michael rubbed his chin. "If they're both drinking because of each other, doesn't that mean they care? Why don't we try to set them up?"

Isabella drove in silence for a moment, then shook her head. "There's not much we can do. Amelia has her own thoughts, and I don't want to mess with her love life. As for Benjamin, that's on you."

Michael gave a wry smile. "What can I do? I take advice from him."

"What do you mean? Did Benjamin teach you how to pursue me?" Isabella looked at Michael in surprise.

Michael pointed to the windshield. "Keep your eyes on the road, not on me. Do I look like a traffic light?"

Isabella slapped the steering wheel in frustration and focused on driving.

"Benjamin just told me to treat my wife right, claiming that's the secret to success! But as for pursuing you, I don't really need his pointers. I've got enough smarts of my own!" Michael said proudly.

Michael said this to make sure Isabella didn't get the wrong idea that Benjamin was a player. If Isabella blocked Benjamin and Amelia from getting together because of it, Michael would be in big trouble.

Stuck between Benjamin and Isabella, it was a tough spot.

Isabella blushed and shook her head. "I didn't expect you to be so full of yourself."

"It's not arrogance, it's confidence. And my confidence isn't just about that," Michael said, his hand sliding to Isabella's thigh.

Isabella's body shivered, and she shot Michael a glare, her face red. "If you don't want us to crash, you'd better move your hand!"

Michael reluctantly pulled his hand back. "Alright, let's get serious. How did your talk with Kevin and his wife go? You said Kevin is your client. Didn't you get him to sign the contract?"

Isabella shook her head. "I trust my skills to win them over. No need for tricks."

A smile tugged at Michael's lips. She was just as he had expected.

Soon, they arrived at the villa and parked in the garage.

As Isabella unbuckled her seatbelt and got ready to get out, Michael suddenly stopped her.

"Remember, you still owe me a wish," Michael said, his eyes filled with desire.

Isabella knew what Michael wanted. Her voice trembled slightly as she blushed and asked, "What do you want to do? We're still in the car."

"The car works just fine. Let's try something different." Michael smiled, his hand roaming over Isabella's body.

Isabella's face turned crimson, and her heart began to race, but she didn't refuse. Instead, she closed her eyes and waited.

They shared a familiar kiss, holding each other tightly. Michael leaned over from the passenger seat to the driver's seat, kissing Isabella passionately.

The car filled with the sounds of kissing and soft moans.

As they kissed, they struggled to remove their clothes in the cramped space, making even simple movements difficult.

Soon, they were both naked.

Michael straightened up and reclined the seat. He helped Isabella remove her pants and underwear, then guided her to lie down.

Isabella covered her face, lying on the seat with her legs spread in an M shape, her intimate area fully exposed.

Michael leaned in, gently parting her pubic hair with his fingers and caressing her soft labia.

Just as Isabella was ready to feel Michael inside her, she suddenly felt something wet licking her clitoris.

Turning her head, she saw Michael had taken her clitoris into his mouth, gently sucking it.

Blushing, Isabella reached out to push his head away. "I haven't showered today. It's dirty down there."

"No, Isabella, it's perfectly clean," Michael smiled, extending his tongue to lick her again, gently nibbling her clitoris with his teeth.

Isabella lay back on the seat, no longer resisting. The intense sensations from her sensitive area sent waves of pleasure through her body, making her tremble.

###chapter 140 Making Love in the Car

Isabella's moans filled the garage.

Michael's skilled tongue was giving her a pleasure she had never felt before.

Her body started to react, and she could feel herself getting wetter. Michael didn't waste a drop, eagerly lapping it up.

"Oh my God, this feels so good. How do you know all this?" Isabella moaned louder. They had never tried this kind of foreplay before.

"Isabella, I can't hold back anymore. You're ready; I need to be inside you," Michael said, his eyes burning with desire, his breath heavy like a bull about to charge.

Isabella let out a soft moan and nodded, craving for Michael to enter her and fulfill her deepest desires.

Michael grinned, straightened up, and positioned himself at her entrance, slowly pushing in.

Making love in the car was a whole new experience. The tight space didn't feel suffocating; it added an exciting edge.

As Michael entered her, the warm, contracting sensation shot through his body. It was like a spark igniting a powder keg. 

He lay on top of her, moving his hips rhythmically, thrusting in and out.

"This feels amazing, so much better than in bed. Michael, you're incredible today," Isabella moaned, wrapping her arms around his back.

They had done it many times in bed, but this was different. At first, she used to stay quiet, but now she was more vocal, embracing Michael's varied styles.

The car rocked with their movements, the pace picking up.

Michael suddenly grabbed her breasts, kneading them, adding to her pleasure.

Her moans grew louder, driving Michael to thrust faster.

Luckily, they were in their own villa with no neighbors around, so they didn't have to worry about being overheard.

"Michael, deeper, it feels so good. I've never felt like this before," Isabella moaned, her legs draped over his shoulders.

She lifted her hips, trying to get him deeper.

Michael felt the tip of his penis hitting a soft spot, probably her cervix.

He started thrusting harder, each stroke hitting that spot, making her moans rise in pitch.

"Too fast, oh my God, Michael, slow down," Isabella's face showed a hint of pain.

Michael slowed down but his breathing grew heavier. He lifted her hips, continuing to thrust with his rigid penis.

Streams of milky fluid started to flow from her, trickling down her butt onto the seat.

"Isabella, let's switch it up," Michael said, pulling out and giving her a playful pat on the butt.

Blushing, Isabella did as he asked, kneeling on the seat with her butt raised high. This position made her feel even more embarrassed but not being able to see him just made it all the more thrilling.

Michael admired her slender waist and full butt. He spread her labia with his fingers, then pressed his body against her back, guiding himself to her entrance. Gripping her hips, he eased himself in slowly.

Isabella gripped the seatback tightly, her eyes rolling back, moaning non-stop.

The car rocked more rhythmically, and as the pace quickened, she felt herself trembling violently. A hot liquid gushed from deep inside her.

"I'm coming," Isabella screamed, her body convulsing intensely.

Michael was close too. He thrust forward forcefully, pushing as deep as he could. As the tip of his penis touched her cervix, he came.

He always did this, hoping to get Isabella pregnant.

After they climaxed, they lay in the car, panting heavily. Once they had recovered, Michael grabbed some tissues to clean up.

"Honey, that was amazing. Let's do this every month, okay?" Michael said with a mischievous grin.

Blushing, Isabella threw a tissue at his face, then opened the car door and stepped out.

Michael laughed, picked up the tissue, and tossed it in the trash on his way back.

"I'm gonna take a shower," Isabella said, her face still red as she ran into the bathroom, closing the door behind her. She felt embarrassed about how wild she had been in the car. She had never acted like that before.

Michael smiled, not minding at all. However, he didn't know that a small trouble was brewing for him.

That night, several newspapers got wind that John's mysterious uncle had brought back his new wife, Estella, and photos were leaked.

The newspapers rushed to prepare the news. Jerry quickly caught wind of this and tried to block the information, but it was too late.

Jerry immediately called Michael to fill him in.

Michael had planned to spend some more intimate time with Isabella after she came out of the bathroom, but his expression darkened upon hearing the news.

"This must be Mason's doing. It's too late to stop it now. Go and warn the newspapers; they can publish the photos, but my face better not appear in the news, or they'll face the consequences," Michael said coldly before hanging up.

"Looks like Mason still has some suspicions about my marriage," Michael muttered, his expression serious.

###chapter 141 Audit Begins

When Michael found out Mason still had doubts about his marriage, he got even more on edge.

'Looks like I'm running out of time. I hope Mason doesn't push me, or I'll just take Isabella and leave the country,' Michael thought, rubbing his temples and letting out a long sigh.

In the next few days, Isabella threw herself into designing sketches for Kevin. Two days later, she finished the final touches and nodded in satisfaction.

"This is the style," Isabella said, looking at the design on her computer. She quickly sent the completed sketches to Gabrielle.

Another day passed, and it was time for Kevin to announce the results.

Isabella showed up with Juliet, while Madeline had her assistant, Thea, by her side. The four of them met at the entrance of the conference room, and the tension was thick.

"Ms. Taylor, seems like you've cooked up something you're pleased with in these few days." Madeline said with a fake smile.

Isabella smiled faintly, "You're oozing confidence too, our dear deputy director."

Madeline's eyes narrowed slightly; Isabella's constant mention of her deputy director status was really getting under her skin.

Madeline didn't want to argue with Isabella, but Thea stepped up to speak for her.

"Ms. Eve put in three days and nights of sweat and tears into her design. She even got Mr. Hamilton's seal of approval. Ms. Taylor, you might as well throw in the towel now to save face. It'd be a real shame if Mr. Hamilton ends up giving you a thumbs-down later on," Thea said sarcastically.

Juliet, annoyed by Thea's mocking attitude, jumped in to defend Isabella.

"The results aren't out yet. How can you be so sure we're gonna lose? Ever watched those TV shows? The bad guys who start celebrating too soon always end up eating their words," Juliet shot back with a cold snort.

Thea wanted to say more, but Isabella shot her a glare.

"Why do you have so much to say? Haven't the demotion and pay cut taught you a lesson?" Isabella said coldly.

Thea bit her lip; the demotion and pay cut had made her the laughingstock of the company. Among all the assistants to the executives, she was the only one treated this way.

Madeline shielded Thea behind her and said in a low tone, "You have no right to tell my assistant what to do."

"Just remember, until we have the final results, I have the power to direct not only your assistant but you as well." Isabella looked at Madeline with a hint of disdain.

Madeline's fists clenched instantly. The position Isabella held should have been hers! But due to connections, someone as unqualified as Isabella had taken the seat, which infuriated her.

Dwayne arrived at the conference room entrance and, seeing the four women blocking the door, rubbed his forehead in exasperation.

"What are you all doing blocking the door? Get inside already. Do I need to invite you in personally?" Dwayne asked coldly.

He then opened the door and walked in.

Madeline smiled and gestured towards the open door. "Isabella, you're the director, and I'm the deputy director, so you should go in first. Please."

Isabella didn't hesitate, leading Juliet into the conference room and taking a seat.

"Damn it! Why is she so arrogant? Does she really think she'll win?" Thea said indignantly.

Madeline smirked, "Someone on the verge of defeat always tries to make a final stand. Isabella knows she's going to lose, so she wants to show her presence in front of me one last time. Just bear with her for a few more minutes."

"Ms. Eve, you're absolutely right! How could Isabella ever be a match for you?" Thea said with a fawning smile.

Madeline raised her chin proudly and walked into the conference room, sitting opposite Isabella.

"Mr. Hamilton will be here soon. Which one of you would like to present your design first?" Dwayne asked from the head of the table, looking at Madeline and Isabella.

Isabella, without lifting her head, pointed to Madeline, "Let her go first. I'm not in a hurry."

Dwayne was a bit surprised, thinking Isabella would present her design first to increase her chances of winning.

Madeline was even more convinced that Isabella was ready to concede.

"Given Ms. Taylor's kind offer, I won't hold back. I just hope Mr. Hamilton will still be keen on viewing your work after mine," Madeline remarked with a smile, shaking her head as she plugged her laptop into the conference room's large screen.

At that moment, Dwayne received a call. After a brief conversation, he hung up.

"Mr. Hamilton has arrived. I'll go greet him. You two should prepare your presentations," Dwayne said, heading towards the door.

Just before stepping out, he stopped and turned to the four people in the room. "There are cameras here, so don't do anything foolish. To prevent any sabotage, I didn't even provide water this time!"

His words made the corners of everyone's mouths twitch slightly.

Madeline and Isabella, in particular, rolled their eyes.

They were business elites, not stooping to such childish tactics.

After giving his warning, Dwayne left the conference room and soon returned with Kevin.

"Ms. Eve, long time no see. Ms. Taylor, good afternoon," Kevin greeted as he entered.

Madeline was taken aback, not expecting Kevin to know Isabella, which made her slightly uneasy.

'So what if you know Kevin? This old guy only cares about capability, and I've got that,' Madeline thought confidently, glancing at Isabella.

Isabella paid no attention to Madeline. After greeting Kevin, she quietly waited for the meeting to start.

Dwayne, although not providing water for the four women, served Kevin a cup of coffee.

"Since Mr. Hamilton is here, let's start the presentations. Madeline, you go first," Dwayne said, gesturing to Madeline.

Madeline stood up and began to introduce her design.

###chapter 142 The Final Choice

A design popped up on the conference room screen, and Kevin's eyes lit up the moment he saw it.

"I love these colors! They're bold but not all over the place. Ever since I saw Ms. Eve's draft, I've been super impressed. Now, seeing the final product, it's even more stunning," Kevin said, giving Madeline a nod of approval.

Madeline grinned and started breaking down her design concept.

"I took a deep dive into Mr. Hamilton's past designs and philosophies, and mixed that with my take on your new product. That's how I came up with this design," Madeline explained confidently. Kevin, Dwayne, and even Isabella nodded along, clearly impressed.

Even though Isabella and Madeline were rivals, Isabella had to admit Madeline had some serious design chops.

Juliet, who was on Isabella's team, felt a wave of anxiety seeing Madeline's confident vibe and Kevin's praise.

"Ms. Taylor, aren't you worried? Madeline seems really strong," Juliet whispered to Isabella.

Isabella smirked slightly. She whispered back, "Her design is great, but that doesn't mean I'm out of the game. Watch closely; there's always something to learn."

Isabella listened carefully to Madeline's presentation, knowing there was always room to pick up new tricks from the competition.

Juliet, initially freaked out, saw Isabella's calm and decided to focus on Madeline's presentation too.

Madeline talked for almost 15 minutes, laying out her design in detail. Kevin and Dwayne clapped, and even Isabella joined in.

Juliet hadn't planned on clapping, but when Isabella glanced at her, she quickly followed suit.

"Ms. Eve, your design concept is amazing. I never thought our products could have such deep meaning," Kevin said, giving Madeline an approving look.

Madeline nodded politely and then turned to Isabella. "Ms. Taylor, your turn. Hope my presentation didn't put too much pressure on you."

Isabella smiled and was about to stand up to present her design.

But Thea sneered and said, "I don't think Ms. Taylor's presentation is necessary. Mr. Hamilton seems very impressed with Ms. Eve's work already. Another presentation might be...unwise, if Ms. Taylor's design isn't equally strong."

Juliet was fuming and was about to speak up, but Isabella held her back.

Isabella signaled Juliet with her eyes to stay quiet.

Juliet didn't get why Isabella was doing this. Thea was clearly trying to provoke them; shouldn't they say something?

Isabella looked at Kevin and smiled, "Mr. Hamilton, do you still want to see my work?"

Kevin nodded with a grin. "I watched your company's selection competition before. Both the first and second place were your designs. I took a closer look and found both works were excellent. I believe you have the talent, so I'm looking forward to seeing what you have."

"I hope I won't disappoint you," Isabella said, smiling. She hooked up her computer to the screen and displayed her design.

But as soon as Isabella's work popped up, both Dwayne and Juliet frowned.

Thea laughed mockingly, "What is this? A bunch of random lines? Ms. Taylor, did you spend days just drawing these? Did you have kindergarten kids help you?"

Isabella shot Thea a cold look. "You've said enough."

"What's wrong with what I said? Your drawing is just..." Thea's words trailed off as she felt a sharp gaze on her.

Dwayne was giving Thea a warning look. Madeline also frowned at Thea, shaking her head to signal her to stop talking.

Thea had to shut her mouth, glaring at Isabella with resentment.

After Isabella finished explaining her design concept, she looked at Kevin and asked with a smile, "Mr. Hamilton, what do you think of my work?"

Kevin's reaction was completely different from when he saw Madeline's work. He stared at Isabella's design, rubbing his chin, his brow furrowed as if in deep thought.

Dwayne, watching Kevin's reaction, felt nervous for Isabella.

'Isabella used only a few lines. Although these lines come together to create a highly artistic impression, they are the complete opposite of Madeline's use of vibrant colors. From what we know about Kevin's taste, he's more into Madeline's colorful style,' Dwayne thought, sighing, the ending already written in his mind.

Juliet clenched her fists tightly. She was getting so nervous, she was starting to lose faith in Isabella.

Madeline, who'd been sure she'd win, felt a sense of unease from Kevin's reaction and Isabella's confident smile.

'It's impossible. Just a few random lines-can they really beat me? It can't be. I've studied Kevin's preferences for a long time!' Madeline thought, unconsciously clenching her fists.

The conference room fell into silence. Time passed by, but Dwayne had no intention of rushing Kevin.

'Why hasn't Kevin made up his mind yet? Isn't he supposed to prefer Madeline's work more? But the longer he remains silent, the more it seems to favor Isabella. Could it be that Kevin wants to change his style?' Dwayne wondered.

Finally, Kevin lightly tapped the table, drawing everyone's attention to him. It was clear he had made his decision.

###chapter 143 Isabella's Victory

The vibe in the conference room was super tense. Madeline and Isabella were both staring at Kevin, dying to know who he'd pick.

Even their assistants were holding their breath, scared that any noise might sway Kevin's decision.

Kevin grinned and finally turned to Isabella. "Isabella, maybe your design concept is spot on. My style's been the same for ages. It's probably time to mix things up."

Isabella's face lit up with a smile, while Madeline just sat there, stunned.

Thea jumped up and demanded, "How can this be? Mr. Hamilton, didn't you say you loved Ms. Eve's work? Why pick Isabella?"

Dwayne's face went dark.

But Kevin, still smiling, explained, "I do love Ms. Eve's work. If it were the old me, I'd have picked her design in a heartbeat. But like Isabella said, our product style's been the same for too long, and our customers might be getting bored. It's time for a change."

Madeline and Thea were clearly struggling to accept this.

Seeing Thea about to argue, Dwayne quickly stood up and smiled, "Mr. Hamilton, since you've chosen Isabella's design, can we move forward with the contract?"

"Absolutely, Mr. Larson. Let's sign it now. I've got another meeting this afternoon, so let's not waste any time," Kevin replied with a smile. Dwayne brought the contract, and Kevin signed it right away.

"Isabella, Madeline, let's walk Mr. Hamilton out," Dwayne said with a smile. He didn't mention their assistants, probably to keep things from getting too chaotic, or maybe he just couldn't stand Thea's antics.

Madeline, despite her frustration, had no choice but to go along with Dwayne's plan.

After they saw Kevin off and watched his car drive away, Dwayne's smile disappeared instantly.

"Madeline, if you can't keep your assistant in line, then find a new one," Dwayne said coldly before storming off to his office.

His quick pace showed just how angry he was.

Isabella noticed Madeline's upset expression and smirked. "Ms. Eve, don't forget our bet. From now on, you have to follow my orders to the letter."

"I don't need your reminder," Madeline snapped, clenching her fists and glaring at Isabella before heading to her own office.

Isabella shrugged off Madeline's attitude and went back to her office too.

As soon as Isabella was back in her office, Juliet rushed over.

"Ms. Taylor, you're amazing! How did you know Mr. Hamilton wanted to change his style?" Juliet asked, her eyes wide with curiosity.

Isabella sat down and shook her head with a smile. "I didn't know he wanted to change his style. I just suggested it."

"You suggested it? And he just went along with it? Is there something between you two?" Juliet asked, her eyes wide with shock.

Isabella rolled her eyes and gave Juliet a light tap on the forehead. "What are you thinking? I'm not that kind of woman. I just noticed something about Mr. Hamilton," she said with a smile, then pulled out her phone and handed it to Juliet.

Juliet looked at the phone, confused, and then her eyes widened even more. It was a photo of Isabella, Kevin, and Gabrielle together.

Isabella explained, "Turns out, Hamilton's taste is totally dictated by his wife. He liked that style because she did, but I overheard her saying she was over the fussy colors and wanted something simpler. So, after I finished my design, I showed it to Mrs. Hamilton first. Once she approved, I felt confident."

Juliet gave her a thumbs-up, her face full of admiration. "You're incredible, Ms. Taylor! No wonder you weren't phased by Mr. Hamilton praising Madeline - you knew the real decision-maker was Mrs. Hamilton!"

Isabella just smiled faintly. As a former socialite, she was used to constant compliments and had become immune to them.

"By the way, Juliet, I need to remind you, when you come to meetings with me in the future, don't speak unless I ask you to," Isabella said, her expression suddenly serious.

Juliet was puzzled, not understanding why Isabella said that.

Isabella pointed outside the office. "If I'm not mistaken, Thea is about to be in trouble."

Juliet's curiosity was piqued. "Why is that, Ms. Taylor?"

Isabella sneered. "Mr. Hamilton's a key partner, but he's still an outsider. Thea's mockery in the meeting room makes it seem like we've got internal drama. Every company deals with this stuff, but we usually keep it behind closed doors to save face and keep our client relationships intact."

Juliet quickly caught on and let out a sigh of relief, patting her chest. "Now I get why you shut me down from arguing with Madeline and Thea in there. If I had chimed in, I'd be in the same hot water as her," Juliet remarked anxiously.

Isabella smiled. "You wouldn't be in as much trouble as her. She's already been punished by the company once, and her image with the leadership is already poor. This incident made it worse. Her fate is either being fired or transferred to a remote department."

Isabella's prediction soon came true. Thea was transferred to a base that produces cosmetic ingredients.

###chapter 144 Isabella's Kindness

Madeline snapped the pen in her hand, fuming. Dwayne had just told her that Thea was being shipped off to some remote cosmetics production base in Evernia. The company was clearly trying to push Thea to quit, completely ignoring Madeline's advice.

Madeline leaned back in her chair, rubbing her forehead. She could still hear Thea's desperate pleas, but there was nothing she could do. All she could do was tell Thea to hang tight in Evernia for a bit and promise to bring her back later.

Just as Madeline was stewing in frustration, there was a knock on her office door.

"Come in," she called out.

When Isabella walked in, Madeline's face immediately darkened.

"What do you want? Here to gloat?" Madeline snapped.

Isabella smiled, unfazed. "I just want to talk."

"Well, I don't. If you're here to rub the bet in my face, save it," Madeline said coldly.

Isabella shook her head. "You still don't get it, Madeline. You're a design genius, but you suck at managing people."

Madeline slammed her hand on the table and stood up, leaning forward. "So you did come to mock me!"

Isabella shook her head again. "Do you really think your assistant got transferred because of me? Perhaps you should consider your own actions. How could you allow a subordinate to insult a colleague in front of a client? Your arrogance and your assistant's poor judgment have led to this situation."

Madeline clenched her fists, teeth gritted, glaring at Isabella.

Isabella sighed. "I'm not here to mock you. I want to make peace. I want a stable, peaceful design department. You're incredibly talented, and I'd like to be friends. Together, we can do great things for the company."

Isabella looked at Madeline sincerely. She genuinely believed in Madeline's talent after hearing her product ideas in the meeting. Wasting that talent on hostility was a loss for everyone.

Isabella felt a strong loyalty to the company, not just because the boss had helped her out, but because she believed in the company's future.

"I'll never be friends with you. I don't need your pity or sympathy. Who do you think you are? Still think you're the socialite you used to be?" Madeline spat out.

Isabella could hear the bitterness and a hint of jealousy in Madeline's voice.

Isabella sighed again. "This isn't pity; it's an invitation. Think about it."

Shaking her head, Isabella turned and walked out.

As soon as she was gone, Madeline swept everything off her desk, her office echoing with her roars.

"Why? All this hard work, and I still haven't achieved anything! Is it because I don't have your advantages?" Madeline's teeth clenched, tears welling up.

Madeline's background was worlds apart from Isabella's.

Isabella came from one of the old elite families. Even though they had fallen on hard times, Isabella's life was still wrapped in luxury. The parties she went to, the friends she made-they were all top-tier. And with Mason's promise of marriage, no one dared to look down on her.

Madeline, though, came from a working-class family. She didn't have the luxury, and her only pride was her natural talent for design.

Madeline was fiercely proud because she had outshone the rich kids with her talent. She believed talent could conquer anything.

Her arrogance lasted until she was about to graduate college. A rich girl had sneered at her, "So what if your grades are better? To us, a diploma is just a piece of paper. After graduation, I'll be a manager at my dad's company, while you'll be scrambling for a job."

Those words shattered Madeline's pride, but she didn't give up. She worked even harder, clinging to her beliefs. Eventually, she became the company's deputy director.

Just when Madeline thought she could finally become the director based on her skills, Isabella swooped in and took the job she had always wanted. The irony? She had never even heard of Isabella before.

Madeline thought back to her college classmate.

That rich girl was right. The position she had worked so hard for was something others could get with a few words.

Blinded by intense jealousy and resentment, Madeline ignored Isabella's talent in design.

Isabella could understand Madeline's feelings. But she also knew that changing someone's mindset, shaped by years of experience, couldn't be done with just a few words.

'Anyway, I've shown her my goodwill. The final choice is hers,' Isabella thought with a sigh as she returned to her office to get back to work.

But Isabella had no idea that more trouble was heading her way.

An ambulance was transporting Bianca from prison. Inside, John sat by Bianca's side, holding her hand with a look of deep concern.

"Bianca, it must have been so hard for you in prison. Don't worry, I've paid off your uncle and aunt's taxes, and they've been released," John said, holding Bianca's hand tenderly.

###chapter 146 Celebrating Success

Isabella just gave a little smile at Mia's request.

"Got it. I'll think about it," she said, nodding without really committing.

Mia's face lit up, "That's awesome! Please, think it over carefully. Our family's future is in your hands!"

"I get it. I'll give it some serious thought. My husband's waiting for me at home with dinner ready. Can you hop out now?" Isabella pointed to the door, still smiling.

"Sure thing, just don't forget about it," Mia said happily as she opened the car door and stepped out.

Leo, seeing Mia leave, hung up his phone and slid back into the driver's seat.

Earlier, when he stepped out, Leo had secretly called Michael to let him know about Mia's visit to Isabella.

Once back in the car, Leo stayed quiet, knowing his job was just to drive.

"Ms. Taylor, ready to go?" Leo asked.

Isabella nodded, and Leo started the car, heading towards the villa.

Isabella sat in the back seat with her arms crossed, silent. Leo glanced at her through the rearview mirror; her face was calm, but her eyes seemed a bit sad.

The car ride was pretty heavy with silence. Suddenly, Isabella spoke up, "Leo, if your parents forced you to do something you didn't want to do, like marrying someone you don't love-a marriage that could ruin your life-and they did it for their own selfish reasons, how would you feel?"

Leo blinked, a bit surprised by the question. But he quickly remembered some rumors about Isabella.

There had been talk that Isabella was forced by her parents to marry John, but since no one confirmed it, the rumors gradually died down.

'Guess those rumors were true,' Leo thought with a sigh.

"Ms. Taylor, if it were me, I'd go against my parents! Just because they gave birth to me and raised me doesn't mean I'm their slave! I have my own life and my own thoughts; I'm not anyone's puppet. If I can't fight back, I'd run far away. But if I can, I'm gonna show them what I'm made of!" Leo said, as if talking about himself, but also hinting at Isabella.

With Michael by her side, Isabella didn't have to fear anyone. No matter what came her way, Michael had her back.

A smile curved on Isabella's lips. "You're right, I should fight against my fate."

Soon, the car arrived at the villa. To Isabella's surprise, Michael was standing outside to greet her.

After the car stopped, Michael walked up to open the door and gave Isabella a hug as she got out.

"Why are you here to greet me?" Isabella asked with a smile.

Michael shrugged, "Because today is a big day! If you didn't secure Kevin's project, I'd be here to hug and comfort you. If Kevin chose your design, then I'm here to celebrate and praise you."

Isabella laughed at Michael's words, stood on tiptoe to kiss him on the cheek, and then pulled him into the villa.

Michael had dinner all set up. They sat across from each other at the table, a bottle of red wine between them.

The wine was from Isabella's own vineyard. After sharing it with Gabrielle that day, she had fallen in love with it too.

Halfway through the meal, Michael suddenly said, "A buddy of mine in the tax department told me someone paid off all your parents' taxes. They should be out soon."

Michael brought this up to get Isabella to open up about her mom's visit. He wasn't trying to control her; he just knew that if he didn't mention it, she'd keep it all inside, which would only make her feel worse.

Just as he thought, Isabella's smile faded when he mentioned it.

She put down her glass and said softly, "It's not just my parents; even Bianca has been released from prison."

Michael pursed his lips, staying quiet. He already knew about this.

Isabella's fingers traced the rim of her glass as she sighed, "They've let me down so many times. I thought I was numb to it, but I still get blindsided by how shameless they are. They actually want me to convince Mason to let Bianca marry John."

"What do you think?" Michael asked, standing up and moving behind Isabella. He placed his hands on her shoulders, gently massaging them to help ease her stress.

A cold smile appeared on Isabella's lips. "I told her I'd think about it, but I have no intention of agreeing. If Bianca hadn't tried to kill me before, maybe I would have considered it. But she almost had me die on the operating table. No way I am agreeing, and I'll find a way to get back at her!"

Isabella's eyes narrowed, her voice icy. If John hadn't protected Bianca so well, she would have found a way to deal with her long ago.

"I've been thinking about something. Very few people knew my schedule, yet when Pearl snatched me, she knew exactly where I was. I hadn't talked to anyone else that day except my parents who called me. I casually mentioned my plans, and now I'm thinking they might have sold me out," Isabella said, her voice filled with hatred.

Michael's eyes flashed with cold fury. If Jasper and Mia weren't Isabella's biological parents, he would have dealt with them long ago.

"They tried to force me to marry John, John wanted my kidney, Bianca wanted me dead-they all wanted me gone. But thankfully, you saved me every time." Isabella turned to look at Michael, her eyes filled with tender love.

Michael gently caressed Isabella's cheek, pressing her face against his chest, enveloping her with his warmth.

"How should I thank you, Michael?" Isabella murmured softly.

"How about we have a baby?" Michael suggested, stroking Isabella's hair and lifting her up, carrying her towards the bedroom.

###chapter 145 Mia's Request

Bianca shot John a look, a faint smile creeping onto her pale face. She wasn't supposed to get out early, but thanks to her "medical needs" and John's clever moves, she managed to leave prison ahead of schedule.

Truth is, Bianca wasn't sick at all. John had people looking out for her in prison, making her stay feel more like a weird vacation. No hard labor, and she had a cell all to herself.

One time, some chick tried to mess with Bianca, thinking she was an easy mark. But John's female bodyguard took care of that real quick. The guards, who had been nicely bribed by John, just pretended not to see anything.

The only thing that really got to Bianca in prison was the boredom. She was worried that if she didn't see John for too long, he might cave to his grandpa's pressure and go after Isabella. If John fell for Isabella, all of Bianca's scheming would be for nothing.

"John, thank you! You must've had a tough time with your grandpa to get me out," Bianca said, her eyes darting to John's leg in a cast.

John just shook his head and smiled. "Nah, it's all good. My grandpa doesn't know a thing about this."

He wasn't lying. Mason was totally against letting Bianca out, and John had pulled this off behind his back.

Bianca's eyes flashed with anger. She thought Mason had finally given in, but it turned out he didn't even know. If he found out she was out, she'd be back in prison in no time.

Biting her lip, Bianca asked, "John, have you talked to my sister lately? How's she doing? Has the Brown family messed with her life?"

Bianca's words sounded like she cared about Isabella, but really, she was hoping Paxton would take Isabella out of the picture.

John shook his head. "The Browns have hit some bumps. Paxton pulled back all his people from targeting Isabella. So, for now, she's safe."

Hearing this, Bianca felt a wave of anger. 'I shouldn't have expected anything from Paxton. He's as useless as his daughter!'

'Looks like I'll have to come up with a new plan. Maybe Isabella's parents can be useful. No matter what, I have to marry John!' Bianca thought, her eyes narrowing.

Meanwhile, Isabella's workday was wrapping up. Leo had already brought the car around, ready to pick her up.

But just as Isabella got into the car, someone unexpected showed up at the door and knocked on the window.

"Isabella, can we talk privately?" Mia asked, glancing at Leo in the driver's seat as Isabella rolled down the window.

Leo looked at Mia, frowning a bit, but waited for Isabella's cue.

"Ms. Taylor, should I step out for a moment?" Leo asked.

Isabella hesitated for a second, then nodded.

After Leo stepped out, Mia quickly slid into the seat next to Isabella.

"What do you want? And weren't you arrested? Who bailed you out?" Isabella asked, her tone icy.

Mia's eyes flashed with resentment. She was still fuming over Isabella reporting them. Jasper nearly had a stroke from the stress.

However, realizing she needed Isabella's help, Mia forced a smile.

"We got out thanks to Bianca. She had John pay our back taxes, so we're free now. Bianca is genuinely kind," Mia stated, subtly flattering Bianca before Isabella.

Isabella almost laughed. Bianca, kind? The woman who tried to kill her on the operating table? Did Mia even grasp that Isabella was her own daughter?

Back then, to free her family from John's grip, Isabella had almost been assaulted by thugs while trying to scrape together $30 million. And where did that money go? Thanks to her parents, she had no clue. From that moment, Isabella knew they were a lost cause.

"So you came to sing Bianca's praises? Do you secretly wish she was your daughter instead of me?" Isabella asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Mia's face briefly showed her anger, but she quickly masked it. "Isabella, since you don't like John anymore, why not let Bianca have a shot? You know Mason doesn't like her. If you talk to him, I'm sure he'll come around."

Isabella's face twisted in mockery. "What did Bianca promise you?"

"We've already talked it over with her. If she marries John, she'll use the Williams family's power to bring our family back to its former glory, and your father will stay the head of the family!" Mia said, sounding proud.

Isabella almost rolled her eyes. She couldn't believe her parents were so gullible, trusting Bianca over their own daughter!

Bianca's dad and Jasper were brothers. If Bianca married John, she'd definitely push Jasper out. Even if Bianca kept her word, Isabella doubted the Taylor family could bounce back.

It wasn't that Isabella was biased against Jasper; he just didn't have what it took. The Taylor family's downfall wasn't just because her grandpa died.

One of the country's top families had ended up with only three small companies, all dodging taxes. That alone showed how bad Isabella's parents were at business.

Jasper didn't have the skills to manage the assets he inherited. The Brown family saw this and went after the Taylors, and they succeeded. Even with Mason's help during the crisis, Jasper still failed, proving he was completely incompetent.

###chapter 147 A Promise Realized

In the bedroom, Michael and Isabella were wrapped up in each other, completely naked.

They kissed like there was no tomorrow, their lips locked and tongues dancing together. Things got so heated that a bit of saliva started dripping from the corners of their mouths.

Michael leaned back against the headboard, one arm around Isabella's waist, the other hand gripping the sheet.

As they kissed, Isabella's hand wandered down to Michael's groin, her fingers gently stroking his penis.

Earlier, Michael had joked that if Isabella nailed the deal with Kevin, they'd celebrate with some steamy lovemaking.

Now, they were making good on that promise.

Under Isabella's touch, Michael's penis grew thicker and harder until it was standing tall.

"Honey, this kind of thank you isn't enough," Michael said, pulling away with a cheeky grin.

Blushing, Isabella rolled her eyes at him before bending down to take Michael's nipple into her mouth.

Her tongue swirled gently around his areola.

A guy's nipples can be just as sensitive as a girl's. Michael felt a wave of pleasure shoot from his nipple to his brain, making his breathing quicken and his thoughts go fuzzy. He even let out a soft moan.

Meanwhile, Isabella's hand had left Michael's penis, and her fingers were now lightly tracing circles around his other areola, teasing his nipple.

Michael's body trembled slightly; this new sensation made him want to pin Isabella down.

"Babe, this feels amazing. Where'd you learn this?" Michael teased.

Isabella's face turned even redder. Since discovering the joys of sex with Michael, she'd watched some adult films and picked up a few tricks.

"I watched a documentary on the Animal Channel about how gorillas do it. Learned it from there," Isabella lied with a straight face.

Michael couldn't help but laugh. He playfully slapped Isabella's butt, saying, "I'm not a gorilla, and you're not a gorilla. I'm way more handsome, and you're way prettier."

Isabella laughed at Michael's joke, rolling her eyes again. She then moved away from his chest to his lower half.

Michael already knew what Isabella was planning. He gently spread his legs, making his erection more prominent.

Blushing, Isabella opened her mouth and took the tip into her mouth.

The moment her smooth, tender tongue touched the thick head, Michael let out a moan.

Michael's penis was pretty big, and Isabella had to open her mouth wide to take it all in.

Isabella's blowjob skills were definitely a work in progress; her teeth sometimes grazed the tip, making Michael wince a bit in pain.

But Michael was super understanding and patient with Isabella's efforts.

Isabella's head bobbed up and down as she took Michael's penis in and out of her mouth. When her tongue started to get tired, she let go of his penis and began to run her tongue gently along its length.

Meanwhile, Isabella's hand gently lifted Michael's scrotum, feeling the two testicles inside. She took his balls into her mouth, lightly nibbling and licking them with her tongue.

"Oh my god, babe, this feels incredible," Michael moaned with his eyes closed, gently stroking Isabella's hair.

As Isabella kept going, Michael's hands didn't stay idle. After stroking her hair, his fingers slowly trailed down her smooth back and rested on her butt.

His big hand covered Isabella's butt, feeling its softness and elasticity. He kneaded it firmly, making it turn red, the soft flesh changing shapes under his touch.

Suddenly, Michael felt a bit of moisture on his fingers. His hand had moved between Isabella's thighs.

Michael's fingers gently parted Isabella's labia, then began to stroke the slick folds, feeling her arousal grow.

Isabella's body trembled slightly, and a soft moan escaped her lips.

Her moans grew louder as Michael's fingers touched her clit.

The sensitive nub sent waves of pleasure through Isabella, making her body shudder more violently.

Just as Michael was about to slide his fingers into her entrance, Isabella stopped him.

"Are you planning to make me climax with your fingers?" Isabella asked seductively, looking at Michael before straddling his abdomen.

Michael smiled at Isabella, his hands gently caressing her breasts.

Isabella braced herself on Michael's body, using one hand to guide his penis, positioning the tip at her entrance.

Then, her body slowly descended, taking him inside.

As he entered her, Isabella felt her walls stretch around his thick shaft, the friction creating a wave of pleasure that made her moan in delight.

Similarly, Michael felt the rhythmic contractions of Isabella's walls, the slick, warm sensation sending pleasure straight to his brain.

Both of them moaned together, Isabella's body moving up and down, while Michael's penis slid in and out of her.

With his feet firmly planted on the bedsheet, Michael tried to lift his hips, bringing pleasure to Isabella at his own pace.

Together, their movements allowed him to penetrate deeply, even brushing against her cervix.

As time went by, their pace quickened, and their actions grew wilder. Isabella let go of her restraint, crying out loudly in the room.

The room was filled with their moans and cries, along with the sound of skin against skin.

###chapter 148 Jasper's Call

The steamy session between the couple went on for almost two hours before Michael finally tapped out from sheer exhaustion.

"Honey, you were incredible!" Isabella murmured, snuggling against Michael's chest and tracing the lines of his muscles.

Michael was breathing hard, holding Isabella's hand, looking like he just ran a marathon. This was way more exhausting than fighting off mercenaries in Evernia.

A crazy thought popped into Michael's head. 'God, please give us a kid. At least then I'd get a ten-month break.'

While Michael and Isabella were basking in their afterglow, Isabella's parents were busy updating Bianca about their chat with Isabella.

On the phone, Jasper grinned and told Bianca, "Bianca, Isabella's on board. She's gonna talk to Mason for you, and he'll definitely let you marry John."

But on the other end, Bianca wasn't buying it.

'No way. How could that witch Isabella agree so easily? She's gotta be up to something,' Bianca thought, her face showing a hint of suspicion. She couldn't believe Isabella would just go along with her plan.

"Jasper, cut the crap. Did Isabella really agree, or is there more to it?" Bianca asked, dead serious.

Jasper hesitated, then awkwardly admitted, "Well, she didn't exactly say yes, but she said she'd think about it. Since she didn't say no, that means yes, right?"

Bianca rolled her eyes so hard she almost saw her brain. Did Jasper even know what he was talking about?

"Jasper, ever think that Isabella might be stringing us along? She could be playing us," Bianca said bluntly.

Jasper shook his head. "No way, Isabella's not like that."

Bianca rolled her eyes again, gripping the phone so tight her hand shook. How could someone as smart as her grandpa have such a clueless son?

"Jasper, if you don't believe me, why don't you call Isabella and push her for an answer? Remember who put you two in jail. If she could pull that off, she'd surely deceive you about this too." Bianca said before hanging up, confident Jasper would follow her advice.

Sure enough, after hanging up, Jasper's face turned serious. He called Mia over and asked, "When Isabella said she'd think about it, what was her expression like? Did she seem hesitant or like she didn't care?"

Jasper wanted to figure out what Isabella was really thinking from her expression.

Mia had been pretty happy, but Jasper's question made her start to doubt.

"I can't remember exactly, but she seemed really indifferent. Her face didn't show much," Mia said, unsure.

"Damn it, that woman might really be playing us." Jasper's face darkened, and he immediately grabbed his phone to call Isabella.

But after trying a bunch of times, the call just wouldn't go through. It hit Jasper then-Isabella had probably blocked him.

Mia, now freaking out, tried calling Isabella from her phone, but she was blocked too.

"That damn girl is definitely playing us. I'm her mother! How dare she mess with me?" Mia fumed, trembling with anger.

"She ratted us out to the authorities; there's nothing she wouldn't do," Jasper sneered. He then grabbed the landline and dialed Isabella.

This time, the call went through. Isabella hadn't blocked the landline number.

"Isabella, why are you messing with us? How can you be so heartless? I already stopped pushing you to marry John. Why won't you give Bianca a chance? Have you forgotten all the hard work your grandfather put into building this family?" Jasper yelled into the phone.

On the other end, Isabella had just finished a cozy moment with Michael and was feeling pretty good, only to have her mood wrecked by this call.

Before Isabella could say anything, Michael snatched the phone and coldly said, "Jasper, if you had any brains, you wouldn't say such dumb things! Who was the idiot that wrecked everything your father built? A monkey could've done a better job as chairman and kept the family afloat for two decades. But you? In just a few years after your father's death, you ran the family business into the ground! Was that Isabella's fault? What the hell was her role in your sinking ship of a company anyway?"

Michael's words left Jasper speechless.

Isabella had never held any position in the family business. Jasper was a selfish guy who wouldn't share power with his own daughter or brother. Yet, this fool thought he was a business genius. His series of ridiculous and laughable decisions ultimately doomed the entire family empire.

Jasper stood up and angrily shouted into the phone, "What do you know? Do you even understand business? Do you know how much effort I've put into the company? I've been living and eating at the office every day, and I've lost a lot of weight because of it!"

"You're just a pompous, clueless fool! Even if you lost ten pounds, you'd still be a fool! In fact, you're worse than a fool because a fool wouldn't be in a position to make such laughable decisions!" Michael's words were brutally direct, reducing Jasper's business acumen to less than that of a fool.

Jasper was so enraged that he blacked out.

Isabella and Michael caught the sound of something crashing on the line, then Mia's panicked wails echoing in the background.

"Honey, what's wrong? Don't scare me! Help! My husband has fainted! Help!" Mia screamed.

Michael hung up the phone and turned to Isabella. "Your dad has fainted. Do you want to go check on him?"

Isabella shook her head. "I'm not going. If he wakes up and sees me, he might faint again."

###chapter 149 Bianca's Plan

Jasper passed out and ended up in the hospital after Michael tore into him.

After getting some medical attention, Jasper finally woke up. The doctor had warned him to keep his emotions in check, but Jasper just couldn't hold it in.

"How could he say that? He has no clue how much I've busted my ass for this company. The family's downfall isn't on me; it was the Brown Family and their meddling that screwed us over. This is all Paxton's fault!" Jasper ranted from his hospital bed.

Mia looked at him, worried. "The doctor said you shouldn't get too worked up. Please, calm down."

"Calm down? How can I calm down? That ungrateful daughter and her husband-they're both jerks! They don't appreciate a damn thing I've done and blame everything on me!" Jasper cried out, tears of frustration streaming down his face.

Coincidentally, the hospital where Jasper was staying was the same one where Bianca was.

As soon as Bianca and John heard Jasper was hospitalized because of Isabella, they rushed over to see him.

"Jasper, what the heck happened? How did things get this bad?" Bianca asked right away.

Jasper was too mad to talk, so Mia, through a torrent of tears, explained everything, naturally painting them as the victims.

"We called Isabella to ask her to talk to Mason so you two could be together. But she played us! And her husband Michael insulted my husband, belittling his business achievements and mocking his abilities, saying he's worse than a fool!" Mia cried.

"That's enough! Don't go into such detail. I was starting to calm down, but bringing this up again just makes it worse!" Jasper snapped.

Bianca's lips twitched; she hadn't expected Jasper to be driven to tears by those words.

John's eyes flashed with contempt as he looked at Jasper and Mia.

John was a sharp businessman, and he'd seen how fast the Taylors went downhill-all thanks to Jasper's screw-ups, in his opinion.

A true business leader entrusts authority to competent individuals. Skilled employees are akin to a shepherd's flock, with the leader using their power to steer them and nurture the company's growth.

But Jasper, the fool, couldn't handle giving up control, scared that his underlings would steal the spotlight. So, he yanked back the reins and squashed the talented folks, leading to most of the cream of the crop getting poached by rival outfits.

Even more absurdly, Jasper kicked other Taylors out of the company, claiming that as the heir, he was the only one qualified to manage family affairs, while others were just collateral relatives.

An arrogant, clueless fool-that was John's take on Jasper.

When Jasper was down to just three companies, John had stepped in with investments to create some cooperation opportunities. But Jasper had been dodging taxes! If Isabella hadn't cut ties with John, he might have gotten caught up in Jasper's tax evasion mess.

John knew Jasper had forced Isabella to marry him to secure more deals and use his family's influence to bounce back.

But neither John nor Mason, nor any of the Williamses, had any plans to help Jasper regain his family's power.

Mason had arranged Isabella's marriage to John purely to protect her. Jasper was never part of Mason's plans.

'I've always been confused. Grandpa said he was best friends with Isabella's grandfather, which is why he's willing to help Isabella. But Jasper is Isabella's father, yet Grandpa barely helped him and seemed to favor Isabella. It's so weird. Bianca is Isabella's sister, so why does Grandpa treat Bianca so coldly?' John had always wondered about this but never found an answer, nor did he dare to ask Mason.

Suddenly, John's phone rang. It was Mason calling.

John didn't want to reveal Bianca's presence, so he stepped outside to take the call.

After John left the room, Bianca looked at the furious Jasper and the crying Mia and said, "I have a way to make Isabella apologize."

"What way?" Jasper asked eagerly.

Bianca narrowed her eyes. "Tell the media about how Isabella mistreated you. Let them spread the story, like how Paxton once buried you alive. Mention that when Isabella fled abroad, she left you behind to face the danger. Say that your conflict with her arose because she married a scoundrel, and when you tried to stop her, she betrayed you."

A malicious smile flashed in Bianca's eyes. She planned to use Isabella's parents to ruin Isabella's reputation step by step.

After hearing Bianca's suggestion, Mia hesitated.

"Do we really have to do this? If we go through with it, we might never have any connection with Isabella again," Mia said, looking at Jasper.

"Do you think things are any better now? After I fainted, she didn't even visit me in the hospital. Now go find the media and report how she made me faint! I want everyone to know she's a heartless and cold woman!" Jasper said, slamming his hand on the bed.

"In that case, you should start making arrangements. I'll go find John and see what's going on with him," Bianca said, smiling as she wheeled herself out of the ward.

'Let these foolish parents fight with their daughter. Not my problem,' Bianca thought, a sinister smile spreading across her face.

###chapter 150 Online Opinion

Even though he'd stepped down, Jasper, as the former big cheese of a major company, still had tons of connections in the media.

Pretty soon, news about Isabella ditching her parents and running off solo was all over the headlines.

The next day, when Isabella got to work, she noticed her coworkers giving her weird looks.

While she was still trying to figure out what was going on, Madeline strutted over with her arms crossed and sneered, "Ms. Taylor, I never thought you'd be so cold-hearted, leaving your parents to save your own skin. Did you feel any guilt when you heard your parents were almost buried alive?"

Isabella's brow furrowed. When she left, she had no clue about any of this, not even that Paxton was looking for her. She only found out everything after she got to Aurora Continent.

What really puzzled Isabella was how Madeline knew about all this.

Just then, Isabella's assistant Juliet rushed over. "Ms. Taylor, Mr. Larson wants to see you."

Isabella frowned and headed to Dwayne's office.

Dwayne sighed as he looked at Isabella and placed a tablet in front of her. "This is this morning's news. Take a look."

Isabella clicked on the news and her face immediately darkened.

The news showed an interview with Jasper, who was lying in a hospital bed.

Jasper tearfully talked about the struggles of raising Isabella and the overwhelming pressure he faced after the company went under. He claimed that Isabella not only failed to do her duty as a daughter but also fled solo when faced with danger, leaving him and Mia in a perilous predicament.

"Isabella's husband is a shameless jerk. He once tried to kidnap us, but we managed to escape. He did all this because we didn't agree to our daughter being with him. Yet our foolish daughter still chose to marry him! That jerk even flaunted it in front of me and insulted me! Calling me a lousy, failed man who let down my old man and couldn't raise my daughter right! I feel like I've let down my daughter." Jasper cried into the camera.

The scene then cut to the reporter, who said seriously, "To reduce a strong man to tears like that-doesn't Isabella feel even a little guilty or sorry for what she did to her father?"

"I only feel it's absurd and laughable." Isabella rolled her eyes and handed the tablet back to Dwayne.

"I can assure you that everything my father said is a lie. Whether you believe it or not, the truth is what I'm saying. So, what's the company's decision regarding me? Are they going to fire me because of all this negative publicity?" Isabella asked calmly, looking at Dwayne.

Dwayne shook his head with a wry smile. "Don't worry, your job is safe. The boss personally told me that. He also asked if you need his help."

Isabella was momentarily stunned but quickly shook her head with a smile. "No, I know what to do next."

Dwayne nodded. "The boss figured you'd turn down his offer, and he also said he doesn't think that video shows the real you. If you run into any problems you can't solve, let me know and I'll relay the message to him."

Isabella said, "Thanks, Mr. Larson. And please thank the boss for me too, but I really don't need his help."

After leaving Dwayne's office, Isabella headed back to her own.

As soon as she sat down, Juliet came in holding a box.

"Ms. Taylor, someone sent you a package. We don't know what's inside. And, is the news going to affect you?" Juliet asked, looking worried.

Isabella looked at Juliet and smiled. "Do you believe what the news says?"

Juliet shook her head. "No way, that's not you. You're kind, gentle, confident, and strong! You even stood up for me and argued with others. I don't believe you'd do something like that to your parents."

Isabella took the box from Juliet and smiled. "Thanks for your trust. Don't worry. This won't affect me. The truth will come out soon enough."

"That's a relief. I overheard some people talking trash about you in the office. I was itching to give them a piece of my mind!" Juliet exclaimed, her fists clenched in anger.

"Ignore them. Damn it, what is this?" Isabella frowned as she opened the box.

Inside was a female doll with a note attached to it bearing Isabella's name. The doll had been torn apart, and a blade was stuck in its neck.

"This is a curse, isn't it? Damn it, who sent this? We need to report this to the police," Juliet said, reaching for her phone.

Isabella didn't stop her. She smiled and closed the box.

"Someone found my location so quickly and is already sending me threats! Those bored netizens really have some skills," Isabella said, seemingly unbothered.

Online harassment was just a bunch of losers venting their negative emotions. They claimed to be righteous, spreading their theories and believing everything they did was right. They never considered the truth, nor did they have any evidence. They just believed what they wanted to believe.

There was once a movie called "The Hunt," which had a line that perfectly described this situation:

"He stands in the sunlight, and I can't see his face."

The film spun a dark tale: the protagonist facing injustice, studying psychology, and eventually turning into Hannibal. Thinking about this grim irony, Isabella shook her head and sat down at her desk.

Just then, Isabella got a call from Michael.

Michael originally wanted to offer support to Isabella as her boss, but Dwayne had already told him that Isabella refused his help. So he could only ask if she needed his assistance as her husband.

"Hey honey, I saw the news. Do you need me to handle this?" Michael's gentle voice came through the phone.

Michael's voice exuded confidence, as if this trouble could be easily resolved in his eyes.

"Darling, I know you're worried about me, but rest assured, I have a strong heart, and I already know how to resolve this." Isabella's lips curled into a confident smile, though there was a hint of coldness in it.

###chapter 151 Old Friends

After hanging up the phone, Isabella got straight to work. She had a plan to deal with her parents and just needed to follow it step by step.

Meanwhile, Michael hung up his phone, stroked his chin, and called Jerry over.

"I need you to find a top-notch private investigator to dig up dirt on Jasper and Mia. I want all the negative info you can find," Michael ordered.

Jerry nodded and left immediately.

Isabella was busy working when she got a call from the police station, requesting her presence.

Confused, she took a leave from Dwayne and headed to the station.

When she got there, she found out that her old apartment had been broken into by some thugs. They not only picked the lock but also did an illegal live stream from inside her place and caused some damage.

Isabella watched a playback of the live stream and found it laughable.

Just another fool who bought into Jasper's lies. Or maybe he didn't care if Jasper was lying; he just wanted the fame.

Seeing her old place defaced with graffiti made Isabella furious, even though she didn't live there anymore.

"I'll get a lawyer. You can rot in jail," Isabella coldly told the troublemaker before getting ready to leave the station.

Just then, a handsome young man walked up to her.

A police officer introduced him, "This is Joseph Davis, the manager of your apartment building. He found the break-in and had security catch the intruder and bring him here."

Isabella looked Joseph up and down. He seemed familiar. More importantly, his last name was Davis, and he carried himself with a lot of poise. One of the four major families was the Davis family, so he was probably from that family.

"Isabella, do you remember me? We used to play together before you turned ten," Joseph said, extending his hand.

Isabella was momentarily stunned. When she was ten, her grandfather was still alive, and she had a prominent status. The kids she played with were all from the four major families, so Joseph was indeed one of them.

"You really don't remember me? That makes me kinda sad," Joseph said, pretending to be hurt.

Feeling a bit awkward, Isabella shook hands with Joseph. Since he was an old acquaintance, even if she didn't remember him, she should be polite.

"I'm sorry. Maybe it's just been too long. You do look familiar, but my childhood memories are pretty vague," Isabella said politely.

Joseph withdrew his hand and smiled. "It's okay. Childhood memories fade. We're very sorry that an intruder gained access to your apartment due to our oversight. We will cover all repair and legal costs. Consider it our way of apologizing."

Isabella was a bit surprised by how accommodating Joseph was. But then again, considering his prominent family background, she figured he wouldn't mind covering the expenses.

She didn't hesitate and accepted Joseph's offer.

"In that case, how about we have dinner together after work? We can catch up on old times," Joseph suggested with a smile.

Isabella politely declined, "Sorry, my husband has already prepared dinner at home. Maybe another time when I'm free."

Joseph raised an eyebrow. He had heard rumors about Isabella being married but had been skeptical. Her firm refusal made him reconsider.

"In that case, I won't keep you. Let's exchange contact information so we can stay in touch regarding the compensation and lawsuit," Joseph said, pulling out his phone.

Isabella hesitated briefly but agreed. After all, his reasoning made sense.

After exchanging contact information, Isabella left the police station. Joseph watched her leave for a good ten seconds before turning away, a hint of regret in his eyes.

"Looks like she really is married," Joseph muttered to himself.

After leaving the police station, Isabella checked the time. It was almost the end of her workday, and she had finished her tasks, so there was no need to return to the office. She asked Leo to take her back to the villa.

Michael hadn't returned home yet, probably still at the office.

Lying on the bed, Isabella opened the news about her. Since Jasper released that video, reporters had also interviewed Mia.

Using the same tactics, Mia cried on camera, begging Isabella to leave Michael and return to her side, portraying herself as a loving mother.

Predictably, the comments were filled with sympathy for Mia and insults towards Isabella.

Isabella glanced at the news and then closed it, thinking, 'My parents' aren't this clever. It must be Bianca's doing.'

Thinking of Bianca, Isabella suddenly remembered that Benjamin had mentioned investigating Bianca's illness.

Isabella immediately called Benjamin, only to be surprised when Amelia answered.

"Amelia? Why are you answering Benjamin's phone? Are you two together?" Isabella asked excitedly and curiously.

On the other end, Amelia blushed. "You misunderstood. I'm moving today, and Benjamin came to help. He's busy right now. When the phone rang, I saw your name on the screen and answered."

Isabella remembered that Amelia had moved to a safe house arranged by Benjamin to avoid Paxton. Now, it seemed she was moving back.

"By the way, Isabella, I just heard about the news from Benjamin. Are you okay? Please, take care of yourself!" Amelia said worriedly.

Isabella smiled and shook her head. "Don't worry. Such petty tricks can't hurt me. I already have a plan to fight back."

###chapter 152 Suspicions About Bianca

Amelia felt a wave of relief wash over her after hearing Isabella's confident tone.

Just then, Isabella caught Benjamin's slightly breathless voice on the other end of the line, "What did Isabella say on the phone?"

Isabella suddenly remembered why she called Benjamin in the first place and asked Amelia to hand the phone back to him.

"What's up, Isabella? Need my help with something?" Benjamin asked with a smile as he took the phone.

Isabella's expression turned serious. "I think Bianca's behind the scheme to have my parents trash me online. Since you've been looking into Bianca's illness, have you found any clues?"

Benjamin's eyebrows knitted together, and his face grew serious. "After going through her old medical records, I'm almost sure Bianca's faking her illness. She's not sick at all. But it's complicated because the hospital's records room caught fire yesterday, and some documents, including Bianca's, were destroyed. Plus, the hospital's computer system got hacked. It was brief, but some patient info got wiped. I think someone's pulling the strings here."

Isabella's brow furrowed deeply. In her mind, Bianca was a malicious schemer, but her tricks were pretty low-level. Setting fire to a records room and hacking into a hospital system seemed way beyond her.

Isabella was sure John wasn't behind this. He genuinely believed Bianca had kidney failure, so he had no reason to erase her medical records.

"Bianca couldn't have done this. It makes sense that someone's pulling her strings. But who?" Isabella asked, frowning.

On the other end, Benjamin shrugged. "I don't know. You'll have to figure that out yourself. After all, she's your sister; you know her better than I do."

Isabella bit her lip, forming a plan in her mind.

"Can you arrange for Bianca to have another medical exam? With your status and reputation in the medical field, John is unlikely to refuse. If we can prove she's faking her illness, I can bring her down completely," Isabella said, a cold glint flashing in her eyes.

Benjamin readily agreed.

"Give me the phone. I want to talk to Isabella," Amelia's voice came from the other end.

"Isabella, I heard you closed a big deal. Let's celebrate!" Amelia suggested, hoping to help Isabella relax.

As close friends, Isabella understood Amelia's motives and readily agreed.

They planned to spend the weekend at a vineyard in the countryside, picking grapes and making wine by hand.

While Isabella and Amelia were discussing their vineyard trip, Bianca received a call at the hospital.

A deep male voice came through the line, "Benjamin's been digging into your medical records. He might be onto something about your illness. You know he's Michael's friend. If he finds out the truth, he'll definitely tell Michael, and Michael won't stand for you deceiving their family."

Bianca's face drained of color. She knew nothing of this! If Benjamin discovered her deception, their entire bribery and kidney transplant scheme would unravel.  Worse still, if John grew suspicious and ordered compatibility tests for her and Isabella, the mismatch would expose Bianca's treachery, revealing her long-held plan to harm Isabella.

At that point, even if John loved her deeply, he'd be furious. And Mason, who adored Isabella, might even kill her!

"What should I do now?" Bianca asked, trembling.

The voice on the other end stayed calm. "Don't panic. Things are still under control. I've arranged a car to pick you up. Your new identity and passport are ready. Leave the hospital immediately. The car will take you to the airport. You'll fly to Lumaria. Once you arrive, call John and tell him that your parents found a matching kidney donor for you in Lumaria, and due to the urgency, you had to leave right away."

Bianca nodded in agreement. Soon, a car arrived at the hospital entrance, and Bianca's phone rang. Confirming it was the car arranged for her, Bianca wheeled herself towards it.

John's bodyguard, assigned to Bianca, followed her. "Ms. Taylor, where are you going?"

"I need to handle something urgent. You don't need to follow me. I'll inform John," Bianca said before getting into the car and leaving.

The bodyguard immediately reported the situation to John.

John tried calling Bianca, but her phone was off.

Feeling suspicious, John instructed the bodyguard to investigate Bianca's whereabouts. By the time John received news that Bianca was at the airport, she was already on a flight to Lumaria.

After Bianca's plane landed and she left the airport, she turned on her phone and called John.

"Sorry, John, I'm about to go into surgery. My parents found a kidney donor in Lumaria. The donor was in critical condition, so we couldn't afford to wait. Just as I landed, I was informed that the donor had passed away. I'll come back to you after the surgery is done," Bianca said before ending the call.

John had already been informed by Bianca's parents about her trip to Lumaria for the transplant. He had been suspicious because he hadn't heard it directly from Bianca.

Now, hearing it from Bianca herself, John felt relieved. He had been worried that Bianca might have been kidnapped.

With the call ended, John felt excited. Once Bianca had her kidney transplant, she would be healthy again and no longer need a wheelchair.

Meanwhile, after work, Michael returned to the villa. Seeing Isabella, he smiled and asked, "Can you tell me about your plan? I've been very curious."

###chapter 153 The Winery

Isabella got what Michael was talking about-her plan to handle the mess her parents had caused.

She had no secrets from Michael, so she laid it all out for him.

Michael rubbed his chin, thought for a bit, and then nodded. "Wow, that's a gutsy move. I didn't see that coming."

Isabella grinned. "If I just wanted to trash their reputation, I'd only get a few likes online. That's not enough for me. I need to wait until things get so bad they can't fix it before I make my move."

Michael pulled her close, looking into her eyes with a soft smile.

"I've got your back," he said, gently running his fingers through her hair.

Isabella nodded and hugged him tight, resting her head on his chest. "Amelia and Benjamin invited us to a vineyard this weekend to pick grapes and make wine. Amelia wants to help me chill out, and I don't want her to worry. Will you come with me?"

Michael nodded. "Sure, but I bet you have another reason for this trip, right?"

Isabella laughed. "You got me. I also want to see if Benjamin and Amelia can hit it off."

Michael kissed her forehead and smiled. "You care a lot about your friend. Aren't you worried she might end up with the wrong guy?"

Isabella playfully tapped his chest. "I think people usually hang out with those who are like them. Since you're such a great guy, I'm sure Benjamin's not too bad."

Michael puffed up a bit. "You're right. He might not be as awesome as me, but he's got about 80% of my qualities."

"And what's missing in that 20%?" Isabella asked, grinning.

Michael's eyes twinkled mischievously. He scooped her up and headed for the bedroom. "In the bedroom department, I'm sure he can't compete with me!"

"Put me down, you rascal! I haven't even had dinner yet!" Isabella blushed and playfully smacked him.

"Don't worry. You won't be disappointed," Michael laughed, kicking open the bedroom door.

Soon, the room was filled with the sounds of their passion.

The next day, at the vineyard, a staff member showed Isabella and her friends around.

"One of our main attractions is hands-on winemaking. You can pick your own grapes, put them in barrels for traditional fermentation, and we'll store them for you. Once the wine's ready, we'll ship it to your home," the staff explained, handing out bags for collecting grapes.

Everyone found the whole grape-picking and winemaking thing pretty cool. Amelia, in particular, was super into it, picking the juiciest grapes she could find.

Even though Isabella owned a vineyard back in Aurora Continent, she'd never actually been there, so this was all new to her.

Michael and Benjamin, on the other hand, had done this kind of thing as kids but hadn't touched it since. It was like a trip down memory lane for them.

While they were picking grapes, Isabella sidled up to Michael and subtly pointed at Benjamin and Amelia.

"Michael, look at them. Why are they pretending not to know each other?" Isabella asked, frowning.

Michael glanced over. Despite being at the same grapevine, Benjamin and Amelia weren't talking, just quietly picking grapes like strangers.

Michael shrugged. "If they were real strangers, they'd keep a safe distance. Standing that close, they're more like a couple having a silent argument."

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Good point. Do you think we might have a silent argument someday?"

Michael wiped a grape on his shirt and fed it to her. "Our life should be as sweet as this grape. If we ever do have a silent argument, you better tell me. I'll make sure we break the silence in bed!"

Isabella's face turned bright red. She glared at him and spat out the grape skin.

"Should we do something to help them out?" she asked.

Michael shook his head. "I'm brilliant at some things, but relationships? Not so much. If I hadn't met someone as amazing as you, I wouldn't have a clue about love."

Isabella blushed even more, her eyes glowing with happiness. She picked another grape and fed it to him.

"Have you been reading love quotes or something? Why are you so smooth?" she asked.

Michael winked. "I don't read that stuff. Maybe meeting you unlocked a hidden talent. It's a talent just for you!"

Then he suddenly hugged her and kissed her, transferring the grape skin from his mouth to hers.

"Michael, you big kid!" Isabella spat out the grape skin and chased after him.

Michael laughed and dodged her. They played around under the grapevines, looking super happy.

From a distance, Benjamin watched them, his eyes filled with envy.

"Why can't we be like that?" he muttered to himself.

###chapter 154 Benjamin and Amelia

Amelia had already caught Benjamin's words, her ears turning a shade of red. But she played it cool, ducking her head and moving to another grapevine to keep picking.

Benjamin watched her, a flicker of disappointment in his eyes.

They soon had enough grapes and started washing them. The grapes bobbed in the water, getting cleaned, and then they spread them out to dry.

A girl dressed like a staff member came over with drinks for everyone, her eyes darting between Michael and Benjamin.

Isabella noticed that even though all the staff wore uniforms, the other staff members seemed to treat this girl with a bit more respect. She quickly figured out this girl wasn't just any employee.

Out of nowhere, Michael put his arm around Isabella's shoulder and said to the girl, "Miss, we've had way too much to drink. My wife has already made several trips to the restroom!"

Isabella pinched Michael's waist, annoyed. She knew Michael was just trying to let the girl know he was taken.

Sure enough, the girl looked bummed when she heard Michael was married, and then she turned her attention to Benjamin.

Benjamin was about to say something, but Amelia walked off in another direction, leaving him looking glum.

"Hi, I'm Aria Clark, the vineyard owner's daughter. Sir, it looks like your girlfriend left. Need any help?" Aria said, smiling at Benjamin.

Isabella shook her head, thinking Aria's attempt to figure out if Amelia and Benjamin were a couple was pretty obvious.

Benjamin paused for a moment, then shook his head. "She's not my girlfriend. I'm single."

Aria's eyes lit up instantly.

Suddenly, Benjamin felt a chill. He turned to see Michael giving him a sharp look.

'Haven't you figured out who you want? Stop messing around with other women! If you hurt Amelia and mess things up between Isabella and me, I'll kill you!' Michael's eyes seemed to say.

Benjamin and Michael had been friends for ages and could read each other well. He got the message loud and clear.

Benjamin gave a wry smile and shook his head. Then he turned to Aria and said, "Ms. Clark, could you come with me for a moment? I need your help with something."

Aria was surprised but followed Benjamin with a happy look on her face.

"What are they up to?" Isabella asked Michael, frowning.

Michael shook his head calmly. "I don't know, but I trust Benjamin will handle it well."

Aria followed Benjamin to a corner. She thought he was going to say something to her, but when he turned around, his expression was complicated.

"Ms. Clark, I need a favor," Benjamin said sincerely.

'Is he going to ask for my number or invite me to dinner?' Aria wondered, her heart pounding as she waited for Benjamin's request.

"Look, the lady you saw earlier and I aren't a couple, but I'm trying to win her over. I can tell she's into me, but there's this invisible wall between us. So, I was hoping you could help by acting a bit close to me to see if it makes her jealous. I want to know if she has feelings for me," Benjamin explained, looking at Aria.

Aria blinked, her expression stiffening, feeling like something inside her had shattered.

'So, that's what this is about,' Aria thought, not exactly thrilled to help.

"Please, I really need your help. By the way, your winery offers memberships, right? I'll sign up for the most premium membership if you help me with this!" Benjamin said earnestly, grabbing Aria's hand excitedly.

Aria felt the warmth of Benjamin's hand and thought, 'If that girl doesn't like him, doesn't that mean I have a chance?'

Aria immediately nodded in agreement with Benjamin's request.

Benjamin let out a sigh of relief and looked at Amelia's back in the distance, a smile appearing on his face.

Amelia pretended to go to the restroom, but when she returned, she found Benjamin missing.

"Where's Benjamin? Where did he go?" Amelia asked Isabella, trying to sound indifferent.

Isabella smiled slightly. "He's barely out of sight for two minutes, and you're already on the hunt. Got a thing for him?"

Amelia blushed and waved her hand dismissively. "I just see him as a friend, and he's my mom's primary doctor. It's all about my mom's health, not some crush or anything."

Isabella rolled her eyes, thinking Amelia clearly liked Benjamin but was pretending not to care.

Michael was flipping the grapes to dry them, his movements steady, showing no concern about the situation.

When Benjamin reappeared in front of everyone, they were all stunned.

Aria, who had previously brought them drinks, was now holding Benjamin's arm, acting all flirty. "Benjamin, trust me, I know my stuff when it comes to wine. Let's go pick grapes together later. It must be fun!"

Benjamin patted Aria's head and said with a smile, "Sure, once the grapes are dry, we'll go pick more. You always remind me of my sister. She's just as lively and cute as you."

Isabella frowned and looked at Michael in surprise.

"Does he have a sister?" Isabella asked quietly.

Michael rolled his eyes and replied in a low voice, "That doesn't matter. What matters is your friend's expression. She looks pretty upset."

Isabella immediately looked at Amelia, whose face was dark, as if she had just received some very bad news.

Isabella's mouth twitched. "Amelia, these grapes are for stomping, not squeezing. Hand-crushed grapes won't cut it for the good stuff."

###chapter 155 How to Become a Mean Woman

Amelia stared at the squished grape in her hand, the red juice dripping like her emotions. "Oops, my bad. I didn't mean to crush them," she said, grabbing a handkerchief to clean up the mess.

"I'm kinda beat. Gonna grab some water. You guys keep drying the grapes," she added, turning to leave.

Benjamin called after her. "Where are you getting water? We've got drinks right here," he said, pointing to the drinks Aria had brought.

Amelia shot him a cold look. "I'm on a diet. No sugary drinks for me." And with that, she walked off quickly.

Aria leaned in close to Benjamin and whispered, "Looks like you were right. She's definitely jealous."

A smirk played on Benjamin's lips.

"Hey, Benjamin, I just remembered something from when we were kids. Come over here. Let's talk," Michael said, pulling Benjamin aside.

"What the hell, man? Didn't you catch my warning?" Michael asked, his voice icy.

Benjamin winced under the pressure of Michael's hand on his shoulder. "Chill, let go first. This is all part of my plan!" he explained once Michael released him.

"I think Amelia's been denying her feelings for me. I want to push her to realize we both care about each other. It's just an act, you know?" Benjamin said, rolling his eyes.

"So it's all an act, huh? I thought you were just a player," Isabella's voice came from behind, making Benjamin jump.

"Geez, why do you sneak up like that? Nearly gave me a heart attack!" Benjamin said, patting his chest and glaring at her.

Isabella shrugged. "Not my fault you were so into your whispering you didn't notice me."

Benjamin rolled his eyes. "Since you're in on the plan, what do you think we should do next?"

"I checked, they've got big and small barrels for stomping grapes. We can pick a big one so you and Amelia can stomp grapes together. Perfect chance to get close!" Isabella said, excited like a scriptwriter watching her plot unfold.

"Sounds like a solid plan. Let's do it," Michael agreed, nodding.

Benjamin started hashing out the details with Michael and Isabella.

Aria stood behind them, feeling a bit left out. She sighed, thinking, 'Too bad. He's just not for me.'

Next up was grape stomping, which would help the grapes ferment better.

But getting Amelia and Benjamin in the same barrel was tricky since Amelia was avoiding him.

"I have an idea, but we'll need Aria's help," Isabella said, looking at Aria with her innocent face.

Isabella turned to Aria and said, "Alright, here's the plan. Go up to Amelia, cross your arms, and in the most disdainful tone you can muster, say, 'I know you like Benjamin, but you missed your shot. He's mine now, and I'm his number one!' Then, when Benjamin shows up, you need to hold his hand all sweet and flirty. This will definitely get under Amelia's skin! After that, Michael and I will step in and find a reason to send you away, giving Amelia the perfect chance to step in. She'll for sure get back at you by agreeing to stomp grapes with Benjamin."

After laying out her plan, Isabella looked at the three of them, who were all standing there like deer in headlights.

"So, what do you think?" Isabella asked, practically bouncing with excitement.

Aria's mouth twitched. "Isabella, I'm not really the type to play the villain. I don't think I can pull this off."

Benjamin glanced at Michael, then back at Isabella, and chuckled, "Isabella, I gotta say, I might have underestimated you. You should be writing scripts! But honestly, your plan could work."

Michael gave Isabella a complicated look. "Where did you even come up with this stuff?"

Isabella shrugged. "I know it sounds pretty devious, but I've never actually used these tricks myself. I learned them from Bianca. She used to pull this kind of crap to mess with John and me, and that idiot always fell for it."

Michael let out a long breath, relieved that Isabella wasn't the scheming type. At the same time, his hatred for Bianca deepened.

'Bianca, you damn woman! You've corrupted my wife!' Michael thought, feeling a surge of anger towards her.

Meanwhile, far away in Lumaria, Bianca was lounging on a deck chair, sunbathing and chatting on the phone, when she suddenly sneezed.

"Why did I just sneeze? Is it the climate here? When can I go back home? I'm so bored," Bianca complained into the phone.

A deep voice on the other end replied, "Don't forget you had a kidney transplant. You need to stay there for at least another two weeks before you can go back. And even then, you can't act like everything's normal. You need to appear weak so John won't get suspicious. Remember what I told you?"

"Yeah, yeah, I know. I'll stay put. If John asks why I'm recovering so fast, I'll just say I got the best treatment here and found an excellent doctor who sped up my recovery with some special meds. But seriously, why didn't you send me to Emberlyn? Their medical tech is way better. I could've been back by now," Bianca grumbled.

The voice on the other end sounded irritated. "I have no connections in Emberlyn! If I had to take you there, the cost and effort would be ridiculous. I'd have to pull a lot of strings to make it happen!"

"Fine, I get it. Once I'm better, the first thing I'm gonna do is find Isabella. I want her to see me healthy and thriving! I want to drive her nuts!" Bianca said with a cold smile.

###chapter 156 Awkward Acting

Isabella had no clue that her scheme against Bianca was already a bust. Even if Benjamin found out Bianca was as healthy as a horse, Bianca could just say she had recovered.

Meanwhile, Isabella, Benjamin, and Michael were hiding in a corner, watching Aria strut towards Amelia.

Aria took a deep breath, pouted, crossed her arms, and swayed her hips as she blocked Amelia's way.

"So, you're Amelia. I can see you and Benjamin have something going on. But let's be honest, you're not that into him, are you? So, step aside. I've got my eye on him," Aria said, full of herself.

Amelia frowned. "Whether I like Benjamin or not is my business. What's it got to do with you?"

Aria kept her arms crossed and sneered. "It's obvious Benjamin likes you. Even when he's talking to me, his eyes are always on you. If you don't like him, just reject him and give me a shot. I'd appreciate it."

"I don't need your appreciation. And your tricks are really lame. I'm not interested in playing your silly games," Amelia said, feeling a surge of anger. She turned to leave but Aria blocked her again.

Aria lifted her chin and said arrogantly, "Judging by your clothes, you're not wealthy, are you? But Benjamin is loaded! You two have nothing in common. Why not give me a chance? My dad owns several wineries. I'm the one who truly matches him!"

A cold smile appeared on Amelia's lips. She flexed her wrists and clenched her fists, asking, "Well, I'd like to see if your rich skin and bones are any tougher than anyone else's."

Seeing Amelia about to throw down, Aria stepped back in fear. Isabella patted Benjamin's shoulder, signaling with her eyes that it was his turn to step in.

Benjamin nodded, took a deep breath, and walked over with a smile, pretending to just pass by.

"Amelia, Aria, what are you doing here? The grapes are laid out to dry. We should move on to the next step," Benjamin said as he approached, standing next to Aria.

Aria immediately hugged Benjamin's arm, acting all coy. "Benjamin, I'm ready. Let's stomp the grapes together! I want to make wine with you."

A flash of hesitation crossed Benjamin's face as he instinctively looked at Amelia.

Amelia crossed her arms and said coldly, "Why are you looking at me? If she's inviting you, just go ahead. Plus, I don't like wine that's been stomped with feet anyway."

Benjamin felt a pang of bitterness but pretended to be indifferent as he nodded. "Alright, if you're not into it, then Aria, let's do this."

"Are you sure Aria isn't an actress? She seems better than some movie stars," Michael whispered. Isabella smiled. "You don't understand. In some ways, women are natural actresses. I think Benjamin's acting could use some work. He's kind of dragging Aria down."

Michael's mouth twitched. "So, is it our turn to step in now?"

Isabella nodded and pulled Michael along as they stepped forward.

"What are you all doing here?" Isabella said, pretending to be surprised, then her expression turned anxious.

"Ms. Clark, it's great you're here! My husband lost his watch, probably while picking grapes. We don't know where it is. Could you help us find it?" Isabella said, looking at Aria expectantly.

Aria hesitated for a moment.

Amelia frowned at Michael. "But Isabella, isn't your husband's watch right there on his wrist?"

Isabella froze for a moment, then shot Michael a furious glare. According to the plan, Michael was supposed to take off his watch, but he had forgotten!

Michael's eye twitched, and he said seriously, "She is mistaken. What I lost was a pocket watch, an heirloom from my grandfather! It has my grandmother's photo inside!"

"A pocket watch? Oh my goodness, that's a precious item! Aria, you must help Michael find it. That watch means a lot to him!" Benjamin exclaimed, grabbing Aria's shoulders and shaking her vigorously.

Isabella and Michael simultaneously covered their faces in exasperation. Benjamin's acting was so over-the-top that it was painfully embarrassing to watch.

Aria's mouth twitched, and she forced a smile. "I do have a responsibility to help this gentleman find his pocket watch, but that means we can't make wine together."

Isabella quickly interrupted Benjamin's awkward performance. "It's okay. Amelia can help. Could you help us find the pocket watch first? Thank you so much, Ms. Clark."

As Isabella spoke, she forcibly separated Benjamin and Aria, pulling Aria along and pushing her towards the distance.

Aria looked back at Benjamin, her eyes filled with reluctance and helplessness, her emotions vividly portrayed. Just as Isabella had said, women were natural actresses.

"I never agreed to stomp grapes with Benjamin," Amelia said, tilting her head in dissatisfaction.

"You were the one who invited us out to have fun. Now everyone is participating while you're just standing there watching. That's not good, is it? Come on, it'll be more fun if we all join in," Isabella said, holding Amelia's hand with a hopeful look.

Amelia looked at Isabella, then at Benjamin. Finally, she sighed and nodded.

"Alright, I get it. Let's stomp the grapes together. Wait... why don't we just chill together and let them do the dirty work?" Amelia asked, looking at Isabella.

Michael walked over and wrapped his arm around Isabella's shoulders possessively. "My lovely wife belongs by my side! Only a devil would separate a loving couple! Don't you agree, darling?"

With that, Michael suddenly leaned down and planted a firm kiss on Isabella's lips.

Isabella's cheeks turned bright red, and she glared at Michael angrily. This wasn't in the script!

###chapter 157 Blood on the Feet

Amelia watched Isabella and Michael getting all cozy, feeling a mix of envy and sadness. She knew she couldn't come between them, so she ended up stomping grapes with Benjamin.

The barrels were packed with grapes, and each one could only fit two people, making it a couples' activity.

Michael and Isabella were the first to hop into a barrel. Isabella's feet squished the grapes, and red juice started flowing, covering her feet.

"There's this legend about the goddess of love and beauty walking through a field of thorns, her feet getting pricked and bleeding, which gave birth to roses. Do you think I'm copying her now?" Isabella asked Michael with a smile.

Michael held her hand and smiled back. "To me, you're my goddess of love and beauty! Your love is mine alone, just like my love is only for you. If romantic roses need your blood, then forget it, because I can't stand to see you hurt!"

Michael's sweet words made Isabella's cheeks turn as red as the grapes under her feet.

In the nearby barrel, Benjamin overheard Michael and couldn't help but smirk.

'This guy's a real smooth talker. Why did he need my help to woo Isabella in the first place? Or maybe he was clueless before he met Isabella, and love made him step up his game.' Benjamin thought, shaking his head.

"What's with that look? Are you not happy stomping grapes with me?" Amelia asked, annoyed, thinking Benjamin was still hung up on Aria, who had left.

Benjamin quickly shook his head. "No, I was just thinking that stomping these grapes is gonna take forever. I can't wait to taste the wine."

Benjamin's slightly tender expression made Amelia's heart skip a beat, and a vivid image popped into her mind.

Under a romantic lamp glow, Benjamin was holding her foot, kissing her leg. His hand traced her smooth skin, then he picked up a bottle of red wine, opened it, and poured it down her leg.

The red liquid flowed down her leg to her foot, which Benjamin gently lifted and began to sip the wine from.

'Damn it, what am I thinking? This is way too flirting! And what kind of guy would even do that?' Amelia thought, her face bright red.

Benjamin noticed Amelia's unusual expression and asked, puzzled, "What's wrong? Did something happen? Your face is really red."

Amelia quickly shook her head. "Nothing happened. I'm fine. I just feel a bit hot, yeah, really hot!"

Benjamin looked up at the sky helplessly. Today, there were lots of clouds blocking the sun, and the vineyard had been breezy, making it feel cool, not hot.

"Are you sure you're just hot? Then why are you stepping on my foot?" Benjamin asked, looking at Amelia with a resigned expression.

Amelia looked down and realized that while stomping grapes, she had accidentally stepped on Benjamin's foot.

"It was just an accident. Why are you so nervous? I didn't step hard. Does it hurt?" Amelia asked, blushing.

Benjamin shook his head. "It doesn't hurt at all. Actually, your feet feel really soft and nice."

Amelia's face turned even redder as she remembered her earlier fantasy.

"My foot feels a bit itchy. I need to get out," Amelia said, flustered, as she tried to climb out of the barrel. But she lost her balance and fell to the ground.

"Amelia!" Benjamin exclaimed, jumping out of the barrel to catch her.

Amelia blinked, a pained expression crossing her face. "I think I twisted my ankle. It really hurts."

"I'll take you to the hospital right away!" Benjamin said, picking her up and running towards the entrance.

Isabella and Michael saw the commotion and quickly jumped out of their barrel.

Isabella shouted after them, "Benjamin, wait! There should be a wheelchair or stretcher here. Also, don't run barefoot; you might trip or cut your feet!"

Just as Isabella finished speaking, Benjamin stepped on a stone, felt a sharp pain, and instinctively fell to the ground. Worse, Amelia was pinned under him.

"Damn it, Benjamin, you idiot! I think you broke my rib!" Amelia glared at him angrily.

Benjamin's heart raced with fear as he quickly got up, seeing Amelia holding her chest in pain.

"Don't worry, I'll find a wheelchair right now!" Benjamin said, rushing off to find one, still barefoot.

Isabella quickly checked on Amelia. After a brief examination, she and Michael found that Amelia had only twisted her ankle, and her ribs were just bruised, not broken.

"Amelia is fine. Don't worry. Benjamin will find a wheelchair, and we'll go to the hospital together," Isabella said with a smile.

Amelia shook her head indifferently. "I'm fine. It just sucks that you were supposed to relax today, and now you're all stressed about me."

"It's okay, I wasn't that stressed anyway," Isabella smiled and waved it off. At that moment, Benjamin returned.

"I found a wheelchair. Let's go," Benjamin said urgently.

Benjamin was still barefoot, and his feet were red, not from grape juice but from faint black bloodstains.

Benjamin had run barefoot to find a wheelchair, and his feet had been cut by stones on the ground.

Amelia felt touched. As Benjamin lifted her into the wheelchair, she grabbed his hand and said, "Put on your shoes!"

Benjamin nodded, about to push Amelia's wheelchair, but Michael stopped him.

"Didn't you hear what Amelia said? She told you to put on shoes! I'll push the wheelchair. You two get your shoes on and come to the car," Isabella instructed, having already put on her shoes while waiting for Benjamin. She then wheeled Amelia towards the parking lot.

Benjamin hurriedly found his shoes and socks, putting them on haphazardly. In his worry, he didn't even notice that he had put his socks on inside out.

###chapter 158 Overzealous Behavior

When they finally got to the hospital, Benjamin felt a wave of relief wash over him.

Michael walked up and gave him a pat on the shoulder. "Come on, man. You're a top-notch surgeon. Can't you tell Amelia's injury isn't that bad? Why are you so freaked out?"

Benjamin shot him a look and snorted. "Seriously? You're married and still asking dumb questions like that? Who was it that freaked out and insisted his wife be hospitalized for a sprained ankle? I'm not Isabella's doctor, but I bet her doc was pulling his hair out."

Back in the day, if Michael heard Benjamin talk to him like that, he would've put him in his place. But now, Michael just smiled and sighed. "Yeah, you're right. That's love for you. You can't fake worrying about someone getting hurt."

Isabella came out of the doctor's office and saw them chatting in the hallway. "What are you two gossiping about? The doc gave Amelia some meds. She just needs to rest at home."

"Rest at home? Are you kidding me? Her injury is serious; she should be in the hospital!" Benjamin shot up from his chair, looking all serious.

Isabella blinked and smirked. "Listen to yourself. You're a top surgeon! Amelia's injury isn't even a fracture!"

Benjamin's face turned a bit red. "Exactly, because I'm a great doctor, I can see all the potential complications. Amelia's got no one to help her at home; she can barely hop on one foot. What if she slips and bangs her head on a cabinet? In the hospital, she's got doctors and nurses looking after her. It's the safest place for her!"

Isabella pointed to the doctor's office. "Amelia's still in there. Go tell her yourself."

"I will, and she'll agree with me," Benjamin said, storming into the office.

Isabella didn't follow. Instead, she pulled Michael aside for a quiet chat.

"I think Benjamin's even more lovestruck than you. Love really does make people blind," Isabella said seriously.

Michael wrapped his arm around her shoulder and whispered in her ear, "You're right, babe. Love does make people blind. You've been on your feet all day. Aren't they sore? How about I carry you back?"

Isabella's face turned a bit pink, and she pinched Michael's waist. "You joker! Is your back not sore anymore? Think you've got the energy to tease me?"

Michael felt her hand on his waist, knowing she wasn't really pinching hard. He smirked. "You can test my strength anytime. It's the weekend, after all."

Isabella's face turned even redder, and she glared at him before walking into the doctor's office.

Inside, the doctor and Benjamin were in a heated argument.

Benjamin insisted, "Amelia has to be hospitalized today. Even if God himself tells her to go home, I won't agree. That's final!"

The doctor, fuming, pointed at Benjamin's nose and yelled, "You're a doctor too. Can't you see her condition isn't serious? Stop wasting medical resources. There are plenty of patients who actually need these beds!"

"That just shows how crappy the medical facilities are here. I'm transferring her to my hospital," Benjamin said, trying to push Amelia's wheelchair.

The doctor, just as angry, waved him off. "Fine, transfer her if you want! Get her out of my office!"

Amelia covered her face, too embarrassed to say anything. The office was packed with other patients, their families, and some doctors and nurses, all watching the drama unfold.

The doctor noticed Isabella and Michael standing at the door. He frowned and asked, "Are you two friends with this guy? Why don't you talk some sense into him?"

Isabella and Michael exchanged a look and shook their heads at the same time. "No, no, you've got it wrong! We don't really know him!"

Feeling awkward, they quickly left the hospital.

Benjamin started pushing Amelia's wheelchair, ready to take her to his hospital, but Amelia suddenly stopped him.

"Isabella, Michael, could you two leave us for a moment? I need to talk to Benjamin," Amelia said, looking at them.

Isabella nodded and pulled Michael away. "Let's go and give them some space. If I'm not mistaken, Benjamin's whole lovelife depends on what he does next."

Before leaving, Michael gave Benjamin an encouraging look, hoping he would nail it this time.

Benjamin took a deep breath and pushed Amelia to a quiet spot under a tree.

Michael and Isabella hadn't gone far when Isabella suddenly pulled him onto a different path, sneaking towards the tree.

"Didn't you say to give them space? What are we doing? Eavesdropping?" Michael asked, his mouth twitching slightly.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "I did say to give them space, but that doesn't mean we just sit here doing nothing! Let's at least listen in. That way, if things go south, we'll have a clue what happened."

"You're just being nosy," Michael muttered, rolling his eyes too, but he didn't object.

Meanwhile, Benjamin and Amelia sat under the tree and started talking.

"Benjamin, I want to ask you something. Do you really like me?" Amelia asked directly, looking at him.

Benjamin took a deep breath and nodded firmly. "Yes, I do. I'm very sure of it."

"When did you start liking me?" Amelia asked with a smile, tilting her head.

Benjamin had thought about this question many times. He looked at Amelia seriously and said, "Ever since we first met, I thought you were very beautiful. And the more I got to know you, the more I liked your personality."

Benjamin continued to pour his heart out, and Amelia looked at him with increasingly tender eyes.

Hiding behind the tree, Isabella and Michael exchanged a glance, feeling confident that things would work out between the two.

###chapter 159 Jasper's Call

Amelia and Benjamin finally made it official. Well, sort of.

They both liked each other, but Amelia was still a bit hesitant. She gave Benjamin a trial period to prove himself.

If he could keep his eyes off other women during this time, they'd make it official.

"Let's get out of here. They're probably gonna spend some quality time together now, like grabbing coffee, catching a movie, or just chatting. We shouldn't stick around and cramp their style," Isabella said, smiling at Michael before taking his hand and heading out.

They hopped into the car. On the way, Isabella called Amelia to see if she needed a ride home, but she turned it down.

"I'm gonna chat with Benjamin for a bit. You guys go ahead. He'll take me home, so don't worry about me," Amelia said, hanging up quickly, like she was afraid Isabella might say more.

"See? They don't need us anymore," Isabella shrugged, smiling as she put down her phone.

"If they end up getting married, we can totally take credit for setting them up," Michael said with a grin, genuinely happy for Benjamin.

As Michael and Isabella drove home, they passed by her old apartment building and saw a crowd gathered there.

Michael rolled down the window a bit, listening to the commotion outside. His face gradually darkened.

They could hear people shouting Isabella's name, holding signs with her name, demanding she be punished. Some were even hurling insults, calling her a slut.

Michael rolled up the window and took out his phone, but Isabella grabbed his hand and shook her head.

"I know you want to teach those people a lesson, but hold off. I need to wait until this situation blows up to a point where Jasper and Mia can't control it anymore. That's when it'll be most advantageous for me," Isabella said with a gentle smile.

Michael took a deep breath and put his phone back in his pocket, feeling a deep-seated disgust and hatred for Isabella's parents.

The car started moving again, heading towards the villa. Isabella thought of something, took out her phone, removed Jasper's number from the blacklist, and called him.

The phone rang twice before Jasper's arrogant voice came through. "Why are you calling me? Ready to admit defeat?"

Isabella's fist clenched instinctively. "Mr. Taylor, this is your first and last warning. Take those videos down immediately, and I can pretend this never happened. Otherwise, you won't be able to handle the consequences. I won't let you get away with slandering me online."

On the other end of the line, Jasper scoffed, like he had heard a joke. "Am I lying? Is it a lie that I tried to stop you from being with that man? Is it a lie that you defied us for him? Is it a lie that we almost got buried alive by Paxton because of you?"

"I had no idea about any of this! I didn't think Paxton would come after you. Plus, I'm the victim here! I didn't go abroad to run away. My husband is a foreigner, and I was just with him at his home. You twisted the facts, left out half the story, and made up the rest to fit your narrative. Do you really think that'll get you what you want?" Isabella's voice was full of anger.

"Listen to you now. You don't even want to call me father," Jasper's voice dripped with resentment and mockery.

Isabella took a deep breath, her gaze icy. "I'm not here to play games with you. I have one question: are you going to delete those videos or not?"

"And what if I don't? You deceived me; why should I listen to you?" Jasper sneered, feeling like he had Isabella cornered.

After a long pause, Isabella asked, "If I agree to help Bianca and John get together, will you delete the videos? For your information, Mason hasn't called me in the past two days. That means he hasn't seen the video yet. If he finds out, how do you think he'll react?"

Jasper's tone was laced with resentment. "Don't try to scare me with Mason. As long as everyone believes you're a heartless woman, Mason will be disappointed in you. That'll open the door for Bianca and John, and our family will rise again!"

But as soon as Jasper finished speaking, Isabella started laughing.

"My poor father, do you really think Bianca will keep her promise? Don't forget, Bianca's father also has a claim to my grandfather's inheritance. When my grandfather left everything to you, do you think her father didn't hold a grudge? Think about it, why would Bianca abandon the father who raised her for decades to side with an uncle like you? Do you really think your verbal agreement means anything?" Isabella said.

Jasper suddenly went silent. Isabella didn't say anything either, and the tension between them grew thick.

After several more seconds, Jasper laughed coldly. "Isabella, you think you're so smart, trying to screw up our relationship with Bianca. Think again! Because of what you've done, I'm making more videos. Get ready to be hated by everyone."

Jasper hung up the phone and turned to Mia, who was sitting beside him.

"Isabella might be trying to cause trouble between Bianca and us, but she has a point. Our agreement with Bianca is only verbal. I can't fully trust her. She's in Lumaria, isn't she? When she gets back, we need to sign a contract with her!" Jasper said coldly.

Mia nodded, clearly agreeing with Jasper's plan.

###chapter 160 Private Detective

On the other end, Isabella hung up the phone with a smirk. "My dad is such an arrogant, conceited fool."

She saved the recording of their chat, grinning.

Michael turned to her, smiling. "Looks like you're pretty confident in your plan."

Isabella nodded. "I know my dad too well; he's a control freak. He never trusted me, his own daughter, so there's no way he'd trust Bianca. Just a little nudge from me, and they'll definitely have a falling out. The only way they'll keep working together is with a contract. Remember those hidden cameras?"

She looked at Michael.

Michael nodded. Of course, he remembered. Isabella had set up a hidden camera in her room to avoid getting framed. Those cameras had stopped Scarlett's attempt to set her up.

"Are you thinking about putting hidden cameras in your parents' villa?" Michael asked with a grin.

Isabella nodded. "Yeah, but we need someone to sneak in. Any ideas?"

"I'll take care of it. I know plenty of people for this kind of job." Michael said confidently.

Isabella trusted his connections, so she agreed.

Once they got back to the villa, Michael immediately called Jerry.

"Find me a private investigator, someone who can act and preferably has experience as a thief. I want Jasper's villa filled with cameras!" Michael ordered coldly, his anger towards Jasper and Mia clear.

Jerry nodded. They knew plenty of skilled people abroad and could definitely find the right person.

The next day, Jasper and Mia got a call. A guy claiming to be a journalist named Steve Carter from a newspaper wanted to interview them.

Jasper, eager to teach Isabella a lesson, agreed to the interview.

That afternoon, Steve showed up at Jasper's villa. He was a middle-aged guy in a vest, with a work badge around his neck, looking every bit the dedicated journalist. He had a cameraman with him.

"You must be Ms. Taylor's father! We've heard about the news and are outraged. We can't believe Isabella would do such things! Don't worry, our newspaper has a big audience. The public will make sure Isabella gets what she deserves!" Steve said, even showing the name of his newspaper and its website.

Jasper and Mia were stoked when they saw the website and heard what Steve had to say.

"No, no, I don't want anyone to hurt my daughter. I just hope she realizes her mistakes and comes back to us," Jasper kept up his image as a loving father.

"You are truly a kind father. I'm sure your daughter will appreciate everything you do someday," Steve said, looking impressed.

Steve then started interviewing Jasper and Mia, asking about the struggles they faced raising Isabella and the good times they had together. This was perfect material to create a dramatic contrast for the audience, making Isabella's betrayal seem even worse.

"Alright, would it be possible for us to film some footage inside your villa? We'd like to include Isabella's room as well," Steve asked.

Jasper and Mia didn't hesitate. They'd been interviewed by several journalists recently, all with similar requests.

Steve and the cameraman filmed extensively inside and outside the villa. During this, Steve noted the best spots to place hidden cameras.

"Thanks so much, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, for letting me interview you. We will report the truth faithfully!" Steve said, looking every bit the champion of justice.

Jasper shook Steve's hand, asking him to use the newspaper's influence to make Isabella realize her mistakes.

Steve agreed to everything. Before leaving, he handed Jasper a business card. "Mr. Taylor, in my years as a journalist, I've seen many dark sides of human nature. We've met parents let down by their own kids. This group is for good-hearted parents like you. Lots of families here have been through what you're going through. Maybe talking to them can help you heal from the hurt."

"Thank you, Mr. Carter," Jasper said gratefully, waving goodbye to Steve as he left.

Mia looked at the business card in Jasper's hand, which had an address, a phone number, and a contact person's name.

"Are you really going to this?" Mia asked.

"Why not?" Jasper smiled slyly.

"I've been clueless on what lies to spin lately. We can attend this support group, pick up some stories, and tweak them to fit our tale. Steve has done us a great favor," Jasper said, feeling very pleased with himself as he dialed the number on the card.

Meanwhile, Steve got into a car after leaving the Taylor Villa. Jerry was waiting in the passenger seat.

"How did it go?" Jerry asked.

Steve smiled confidently. "Don't worry, they've taken the bait. As soon as they leave for that support group, I can install the hidden cameras in no time!"

Jerry nodded, curious. "Does that support group really exist?"

Steve shrugged. "Eight billion people on the planet. Statistically, there should be a group like that, right? But I've never seen one." 

He paused, "Don't worry, those actors I hired are professional. During the chat, they'll exchange small gifts. Trust me, the cameras in those gifts won't fall out like in the movies!"

Jerry looked at the confident Steve, a playful smile on his face, and felt a bit of sympathy for Jasper.

'Poor guy, it looks like every day for them is going to be a live broadcast!' Jerry thought.

###chapter 161 Isabella's Discovery

Steve was the PI Jerry hired to dig up dirt on Jasper and Mia. Being a private investigator didn't exactly require a halo, especially when it came to bugging homes and planting hidden cameras.

Lucky for Jerry, Steve wasn't exactly a saint. He had a bag of tricks, and his targets usually spilled their secrets without even knowing it.

For Steve, this job was a piece of cake. Jasper and Mia were easily manipulated, and he won their trust quickly. Honestly, if Michael hadn't paid him so well, he wouldn't have bothered with this gig.

Meanwhile, Isabella got the update from Michael that everything was going according to plan.

After the weekend, Isabella headed to work. As soon as she got to the entrance, she saw the security guards looking pretty fed up.

They said they'd been dealing with a lot of people causing trouble for her and told her to look out for herself.

While they sounded concerned, Isabella sensed their frustration. The extra troublemakers were making their job much harder.

"Sorry for the extra hassle. I'll do my best to sort this out," Isabella said with a weary smile. She knew the guards would have to put up with this mess a bit longer until her plan was done.

Just as she was about to go inside, she heard a voice that made her cringe.

"Isabella doesn't care about you security guys. She's a big shot here. If she doesn't show up, how's she gonna earn that fat paycheck?" a woman trailing behind Madeline said as they approached Isabella.

Isabella glanced at the woman's name badge: Odette Davis, Assistant.

Isabella didn't think Odette was just trying to mock her; it was clear she was trying to stir up trouble between her and the security team.

Isabella shot a cold look at Madeline. "Last time, you didn't keep your assistant in line, and she got transferred. This new one's even worse!"

Odette's face soured, but Madeline stepped in front of her and said icily, "That's none of your business. I'm quite happy with my current assistant."

Isabella looked at Madeline with disappointment. It seemed Madeline had made her choice and wasn't interested in her goodwill.

Without another word, Isabella turned and walked into the building. She headed to her office, ignoring the whispers from her colleagues. She knew that once the truth came out, everything would be back to normal.

In her office, Isabella noticed something was off. The stack of documents on her desk looked like it had been moved.

Isabella always left her unfinished documents neatly in the top left corner of her desk. But now, the top document was slightly out of place.

She immediately called Juliet into her office.

"Did you come into my office today?" Isabella asked.

Juliet shook her head. "No, I haven't been in here. But Ms. Eve mentioned she had a task for me. I overheard her telling her new assistant, Odette, to drop off a document in your office."

Isabella nodded and said to Juliet, "You're my assistant, and from now on, you only take orders from me. If Madeline asks you to do anything, find an excuse to refuse or just say no. Don't worry about workplace politics; she and I are completely at odds now."

Juliet nodded to show she understood.

Isabella waved her hand, signaling Juliet to leave, and then took out her phone.

After reviewing the footage on her phone, her lips curled into a cold smile.

"Madeline, I gave you a chance, but I didn't expect you to stoop even lower," Isabella muttered as she put her phone away. She had to focus on her work and her parents for now. As for Madeline, she could wait until everything else was settled.

Just then, Juliet returned. "Ms. Taylor, Mr. Larson wants to see you in his office."

Isabella left her office and went to Dwayne's office.

"Mr. Larson, what can I do for you?" Isabella asked politely.

Dwayne nodded, his expression serious. "I just got a notice from the security department. They've been overwhelmed lately because of your situation. People keep showing up to cause trouble, and it's really putting a strain on them. They said if things don't calm down soon, they might not be able to keep you safe. So, I wanted to ask if you'd be willing to work from home for a while."

Isabella pressed her lips together. She'd known this day would come. She could have applied to work from home earlier, but she'd waited to build more public anger and get more attention.

Isabella bit her lip and looked at Dwayne. "Mr. Larson, could you please call the boss and ask for his opinion? Honestly, I don't want to work from home. It would look like I'm avoiding the issue. Everything my parents said online is false, and I need to stand my ground."

Dwayne rubbed his face, feeling a bit helpless. He had already called Michael, but Michael told him to follow Isabella's lead.

"If you really want to stay at the office, we can make it work. But we might need to hire more security," Dwayne said, relaying the boss's message.

Isabella was surprised that the boss valued her opinion so much. This was a great help to her.

Just then, the office door was knocked, and Madeline walked in.

"Mr. Larson, those protesters are back, and there are twice as many as yesterday! They want Isabella fired, saying someone as selfish as she is shouldn't be working here," Madeline said, looking at Isabella with a mocking expression.

Isabella's face remained impassive.

Dwayne sighed and immediately called the police.

After a while, the police arrived and dispersed the crowd outside the building.

###chapter 162 Paxton's Purpose

After getting back to her office, Isabella could totally feel the cold vibes from her coworkers. The crowd outside was all because of her, messing up everyone's day.

Isabella felt stuck. She wasn't some big shot with power, just a regular woman. Anyone with half a brain could see Jasper had set this up to mess with her.

These days, you could hire a bunch of people for cheap to hold signs and make a scene, like those fake fans at airports screaming for random celebrities. It was all about creating buzz and getting noticed.

Honestly, those people probably didn't even know what those celebs were famous for. It was all just a big act, and the best actors got to win.

Speaking of acting, there was another woman hustling for her future in showbiz. Michael had found himself a fake wife, Estella, promising her a bright future if she helped him fool his family.

Estella jumped at the chance. This was nothing compared to sucking up to directors or investors. She even thought if Michael wanted to sleep with her, she'd be down.

On the film set in Aurora Continent, Estella had just wrapped up a scene and was chilling when her assistant rushed over, saying someone wanted to see her.

"If it's a reporter, tell them I've got two hours free tomorrow for an interview. If it's a fan, just give them a signed photo and say I'm busy," Estella said, not even looking up.

She used to be cautious, but now she's brimming with confidence, all thanks to Michael.

Michael had kept his word, hooking her up with a killer PR team that got her name out there. Lately, she'd been all over the news, often mentioned as the wife of some mysterious guy. Reporters were all over her, trying to dig up dirt on him, but she kept them at arm's length, only talking about her movies and dodging any marriage questions.

But her assistant shook her head. "It's a woman named Zoey Foster. She says her husband is Paxton."

Estella was caught off guard. She didn't know Zoey, but she knew Paxton's name.

After making the deal with Michael, Estella had picked up some info about him.

Paxton's daughter, Pearl, had chased after Michael but got turned down, which was a big joke. Zoey showing up here had to be Paxton's idea. Since Pearl had made a fool of herself, it seemed weird they'd try to reach out to Michael again. So, what was Zoey doing here?

"Did she say why she wanted to see me?" Estella asked her assistant in a low voice.

The assistant, not quite getting why Estella was being so cautious, whispered back, "She didn't give a specific reason, just said she wanted to make friends and get to know a future star. She also gave me her card and said you could call her if you wanted."

The assistant handed Estella a fancy platinum card.

Estella raised an eyebrow. Just like a high-ranking family's wife, her business card was flashy as expected.

"Got it. You can go now, and don't mention this to anyone!" Estella warned her assistant firmly.

The assistant nodded and left.

As soon as the assistant was gone, Estella called Jerry to fill him in on the situation.

Jerry acknowledged and hung up. After the call, Estella had a bitter smile on her face.

"Everyone says I'm Michael's wife, but I don't even have his phone number!" Estella muttered to herself, then asked the makeup team to touch up her makeup for the next scene.

Meanwhile, Jerry reported the news to Michael.

"Mr. Williams, what is Paxton up to?" Jerry was just as puzzled as Estella.

Michael had embarrassed Paxton and Pearl before, so it didn't make sense for Paxton to keep trying to get involved with him.

Michael smirked. "Paxton wanted his daughter to marry me for the benefits. Capitalists would sell their own souls for enough profit - Paxton's using Estella to get close to me, hoping to score big for his family, maybe even crack some overseas markets."

Michael easily figured out Paxton's game. As the head of a family, Paxton wouldn't waste his time on petty revenge for his daughter.

As a man, Paxton wouldn't approach Michael's wife directly. Sending his own wife was the best way to avoid public scrutiny.

Michael tapped his fingers lightly on the table, new ideas forming in his mind.

Looking at Jerry, Michael said, "Tell Estella to get friendly with Paxton's wife and find out what she wants. She could be useful against the Browns."

Jerry nodded and was about to make the call when Michael stopped him.

"Also, give her my number and warn her not to call unless it's absolutely necessary," Michael added coldly. He didn't want to get a call from Estella while he was with Isabella, which would only lead to more misunderstandings.

Jerry agreed and went to make the arrangements.

Estella followed Jerry's instructions without hesitation. She was thrilled to have Michael's number, though only for emergencies, it was still a major boost.

###chapter 163 Mason's Resentment

Isabella gave Michael a ring to let him know that Mason had caught wind of the news and was definitely going to have John take care of it. She wanted to make sure Michael didn't get the wrong idea.

"Babe, do you really think I'd doubt you? Don't you trust me?" Michael said, rolling his eyes a bit, sounding a tad annoyed.

Isabella laughed and said, "Of course I trust you, but as your wife, I gotta show some concern to keep you calm."

Michael smiled warmly. Isabella's actions showed how much she cared for him.

"Alright, I get it. I won't be jealous of that guy. I know how much you can't stand him! Do you need me to get you some bodyguards? He nearly strangled you last time," Michael said seriously.

Isabella quickly declined. "No worries, the company has hired a whole new security team. They're much better than the old ones, who are now feeling the pressure. Management's considering replacing them. It's kinda funny. I never thought my situation would cause a job crisis for the company's security staff."

Michael just smiled at her words. He had personally picked these guards, and their pay was better than the original guards. Even if the security department's leadership wanted to replace the old guards, the new ones wouldn't agree!

After chatting for a bit, Michael and Isabella hung up.

Meanwhile, over at the Williams Villa, Mason was fuming. As an older guy, he paid little attention to the internet. Consequently, when he finally came across the viral videos of Jasper and Mia in tears, several days had already passed.

Mason was so mad when he first saw the videos that he almost smashed his phone! He knew Isabella well enough to be sure of her innocence; Jasper and Mia's accusations were blatant lies.

"They're hurting their daughter terribly. Charles, I need you to bring Jasper and Mia. I have to make them see what they've done," Mason barked at Charles, gripping his cane tightly.

But Charles didn't follow the order. Instead, he suggested, "Mr. Williams, there are rumors online that Isabella did those things because she has your favor. If you punish Jasper and Mia, it'll just confirm those rumors and make things worse for Isabella's reputation!"

With Charles' advice, Mason slowly calmed down.

"Go get John for me." Mason waved his hand, and Charles immediately went to get John.

John showed up, looking confused. He asked Mason, "Grandpa, what do you need me for?"

Mason handed John the news about Jasper and Mia.

John took a quick look, not showing much reaction since he already knew about it.

"Looks like you're already aware of what's going on with Isabella. This could be your chance," Mason said, eyeing John.

John got the hint. If he helped Isabella out of this mess, it might bring them closer.

But John shook his head. "Grandpa, you know Isabella's too proud. She's turned down all my help and even blocked my number. It's not that I don't want to help; she just won't let me."

Mason slammed his cane on the floor, fuming. "Your idea of 'help' was to strangle her and mess up her marriage? How could you be so foolish?"

John felt annoyed by the scolding but didn't dare to talk back.

Mason took a deep breath and said sternly, "Listen up. Get a PR team and hand it over to Isabella. Let her handle it herself!"

John pouted. "Grandpa, do we really need to go through all this? With our family's influence, we can just call the media and tell them to stop reporting about Isabella."

Before he could finish, Mason whacked him on the backside with his cane.

Mason stood up, pointing his cane at John, his face darkening. "You idiot! Do I need to teach you how to win her heart? The internet never forgets. Even if you use power to stop the media, Isabella will remain culpable in the public eye until the truth is revealed. The best way is to help her uncover the truth!" Mason said angrily.

John rubbed his sore backside and nodded. "Alright, Grandpa, I get it. I'll contact a PR team right away."

John then quickly left the room, running as if afraid Mason would follow and hit him again.

After John left, Mason sat back on the sofa.

'Could I have been wrong? If Isabella's husband is really Michael, how could he see her being slandered and not react? Or does he have other plans?' Mason wondered, gripping his cane, his face clouded with worry. He once again questioned the relationship between Isabella and Michael.

The next day, Isabella arrived at work. As she entered the design department, Odette approached her, arms crossed, with a mocking expression.

"Ms. Taylor, I didn't expect you could actually get John to help you! It seems the rumors in the company were true. You really became our director because you were once John's fiancée!" Odette said, her tone dripping with sarcasm, the jealousy in her eyes almost palpable.

Isabella frowned, realizing her suspicion was correct. John was indeed getting involved in this matter.

###chapter 164 Isabella's Warning

Isabella's face turned icy as she stared at Odette.

"Hasn't anyone told you that Madeline's last assistant got shipped off to Evernia for running her mouth? This is your last warning. I got this director gig because of my skills, not connections! How dare you bring gossip to me? You wanna end up in Evernia too?" Isabella's cold glare made Odette instinctively step back.

"Go back and tell Madeline I have the power to fire every single one of you! Cross me again, and you'll face the consequences," Isabella said, then stormed back to her office.

Odette clenched her fists, glaring at Isabella with pure hatred.

"Just wait. Let's see how long you can keep that attitude. You bitch, you'll regret this!" Odette muttered under her breath.

The other colleagues in the office looked at Odette with mocking and disdainful eyes.

In the workplace, picking sides was risky business, often resulting in conflict. Even if you did, you shouldn't mess with your superiors.

A smart person wouldn't act like Odette. But her situation was different. She was tight with Madeline's former assistant, Thea, and had been one of Madeline's followers in college. Naturally, she was part of Madeline's crew.

Odette harbored a secret crush on John, a wealthy and handsome heir, though she knew he'd never notice her.

Isabella, as John's ex-girlfriend-or rather, ex-fiancée-naturally became the target of Odette's jealousy. What drove Odette even crazier was that Isabella actually turned down such an amazing guy, which made her even more resentful.

So, Odette's behavior was more extreme than Thea's. And Madeline didn't care to stop any of it. As Isabella had pointed out, Madeline didn't bother to discipline her subordinates.

Meanwhile, Isabella opened her office door to find John sitting in her chair. Beside him stood three men in suits.

"Who let you into my office? This is my private space," Isabella said coldly as she walked up to John.

John waved his hand casually, "Technically, you're borrowing our space! This company was founded by my uncle, so it's part of our family's business. As the family heir, what's wrong with me sitting here?"

Isabella's lips curled into a mocking smile. "If I'm not mistaken, you're not one of the shareholders of this company, are you?"

John's smile stiffened. When Michael founded this company, he didn't include any members of the four major families. John, as a family heir, was the first to be excluded.

John didn't want to argue with Isabella over this. He pointed to the three men beside him and said, "I brought this PR team to help you. They're industry-leading, with a 90%+ satisfaction rate, and I trust them to handle this crisis."

Isabella shook her head. "Tell your grandfather thanks, but I don't need it. My husband already hired a PR team for me."

"Your husband? You mean the driver who dropped you off? What kind of PR team can he hire? Are you sure he hasn't been scammed?" John retorted with a mocking laugh.

The three PR guys in the office also smirked. They were there to help Isabella at John's request, but that didn't mean they worked for her. Naturally, they didn't need to show her any respect. Besides, Isabella might have to follow their instructions in the future.

Isabella frowned but quickly realized John had mistaken the driver, Leo, for her husband.

Leo, who had just parked the car, suddenly shivered.

"Damn, why do I have a bad feeling? Is someone planning to mess with me?" Leo muttered, looking around cautiously.

"The person you mentioned is just a driver assigned to me by the company," Isabella said, denying John's assumption. She didn't want him to trouble Leo.

"Are you kidding me? This company doesn't provide drivers." John sneered, clearly not believing Isabella.

Isabella frowned, thinking, 'The company didn't assign a driver? What's going on?'

"Alright, enough joking around. The PR team your husband hired is probably cheap and incompetent. You should trust the team I found. They're very famous in the industry! If you follow their guidance, they can definitely pull you out of this mess!" John said, shrugging as he stood up from the office chair and walked over to Isabella.

"You don't need to thank me this time. Just make sure to join me for dinner once this is all over," John added, reaching out to touch Isabella's chin.

Isabella stepped back and said coldly, "Don't push me, John. One more step, and I'm filing a sexual harassment complaint. Go find Bianca if you want a woman!"

John's eyes flashed with a hint of displeasure as Isabella dodged him. "Bianca went to Lumaria for a kidney transplant. You're lucky; she won't need your kidney anymore."

Isabella's eyes widened instantly. "What did you say? Bianca went to Lumaria?"

Isabella was shocked by this news and quickly realized that her plan to have Benjamin investigate Bianca's health was no longer feasible. That vicious woman must have sensed something! By the time Bianca returned from Lumaria, she would be completely 'recovered,' leaving no reason to check her health.

"She's your cousin. Shouldn't you be happy that she's getting better?" John asked, frowning.

Isabella's lips curled into a cold smile. "So, you conveniently forgot what I said before. You didn't even bother to check if Bianca and I are compatible for a kidney transplant! Don't you find it strange she didn't ask you to go to Lumaria with her? If you're so smart, why haven't you investigated whether she actually had a transplant or just a vacation?"

###chapter 165 Astonishing News

John was super fed up with Isabella's attitude.

"When are you gonna quit this childish game? You just want me to dig up dirt on Bianca and drive a wedge between us. Isn't this getting old?" John snapped at Isabella.

Isabella rolled her eyes, thinking John was a total idiot.

"Enough, get out of my office now, and take your PR team with you. I don't need your help," Isabella said, pointing to the door.

John, who had put up with Isabella's crap for way too long, was now boiling with rage. "Are you seriously turning down my help? This might be your only shot to get out of this mess!"

Isabella's face turned icy. "From the moment you and Bianca kidnapped me and tried to steal my kidney, there was nothing left to talk about. I almost died on that operating table! I've told you a million times that Bianca's diagnosis and kidney match reports are fake, but you act like you can't hear me. You always think I'm out to ruin your relationship. There's nothing more to say to an idiot like you."

John's face went pale, and the three PR people in the office looked stunned.

Isabella's decision to end her engagement with John surprised many, who felt she was forfeiting a marriage into wealth. However, the three PR people now understand her reasons.

"Stop slandering me! Bianca's diagnosis is legit; she wouldn't lie to me!" John yelled at Isabella.

Isabella ignored John and looked at the three PR people, who were now staring at the floor.

"Did you hear that? A family heir being played like a fool by a woman!" Isabella sneered.

The three PR people lowered their heads even more, wishing they hadn't come to the office today and heard all this drama. They were cursing Isabella in their heads, thinking she was safe under Mason's wing, shielding her from John's wrath. Unlike her, they had no shield and could vanish for knowing too many secrets.

John finally had enough of Isabella's taunts. In a fit of rage, he swung his hand towards her face, but she was ready. She blocked his strike and delivered a swift kick to his groin.

John fell to the ground, clutching his groin in pain.

Isabella turned to the three PR people. "Please escort Mr. Williams out. I'll call Mason later to explain the situation."

The three PR people's eyes widened in shock. They deeply regretted coming to the office today and wished they had called in sick.

"Isabella, you bitch!" John snarled, struggling to get up from the floor.

At that moment, there was a knock on the office door.

Isabella opened the door to find a woman she didn't know standing there. The woman wasn't wearing a company badge, so she clearly wasn't from their company.

The woman strolled into the office, taking in the sight of an enraged John and the three PR folks.

"Looks like I walked in at a bad time," she said with a smile.

"Who are you...?" Isabella started to ask, but one of the PR people cut her off with a gasp.

"You're Juniper Fox! No way-you're the PR person Isabella hired?" one of them exclaimed, eyes wide with admiration.

John frowned, recognizing the name. "Are you the so-called PR Queen, Juniper?"

Isabella was stunned. She'd heard of Juniper Fox. If John's PR team had a success rate of over 90%, Juniper's was at least 99%.

Juniper smiled and extended her hand to Isabella. "Hello, Ms. Taylor. I'm the PR expert your husband hired. Leave this mess to us. We'll make sure you're happy with the results."

Isabella shook Juniper's hand, still in a daze. She hadn't expected Michael to hire someone so famous.

"Impossible! This is absolutely impossible! Isabella's husband is just a driver. How could he possibly afford to hire you?" John demanded angrily, unable to believe what was happening. But the facts were right in front of him, but it made no sense to him at all.

Juniper raised an eyebrow. "Mr. Williams, I'm afraid I can't answer that due to client confidentiality. We don't disclose our clients' information. If you're really curious, maybe you should ask Mason."

"You know my grandfather?" John frowned, feeling a surge of anger. Why did these two women always use his grandfather to put him down?

"Mr. Williams, since I'm here, there's no need for your PR team. Leave this matter to me. Thanks for your concern," Juniper said politely.

John clenched his fists, glaring at Juniper and Isabella. He had come here confident, only to face another setback.

Slowly, John walked towards the office door, still feeling the pain from Isabella's kick.

The three PR people hurriedly helped John out of the company.

Along the way, many curious eyes followed John, making him feel both embarrassed and furious.

Once they reached the parking lot, John sat in the car with a cold expression.

"What did you hear in Isabella's office just now?" John asked the three PR people coldly.

They shook their heads frantically. "We heard nothing! Please believe us!"

The three PR people kept their heads down, trembling with fear, worried that John might silence them.

The parking lot fell into an eerie silence. After a minute, John finally spoke, "Forget everything you saw and heard. If you dare to spread a word, you'll be fed to the sharks!"

With that, John ordered the driver to start the car and leave the parking lot.

After John left, the three PR people collapsed to the ground, trembling, grateful to have survived.

###chapter 166 To Do PR

Isabella had no clue what was going down in the parking lot, and honestly, even if she did, she wouldn't give a damn.

Meanwhile, she was in her office, hashing out the new PR strategy with Juniper.

"I've seen the buzz about you online, but I want to hear the full scoop from you," Juniper said, grinning as she settled at the desk.

Isabella nodded and spilled all the details she had.

As Isabella talked, Juniper started piecing things together and was floored by what Jasper and Mia had done.

"I can't believe they'd do you dirty like that!" Juniper said, shaking her head. She was surprised by Isabella's story, but not totally shocked. She'd seen worse in her line of work.

"That's the gist of it, and I've got some solid proof to back it up-recordings, videos, and some things that I'm still working on. I think the current buzz isn't enough; we need to wait a bit longer," Isabella explained her plan.

Juniper nodded. "You're right. We need better timing for this. Dropping it now would be a waste."

Juniper paused, a sly smile creeping onto her face. "Ms. Taylor, after hearing your plan, I feel like you might not even need my help. You've totally got this."

Isabella smiled back. "Actually, I seem to have the upper hand because of the killer evidence I've got. But to really make it work, I need your clout. I want to use your influence to tighten up the plan and turn my 80% chance into a sure thing."

Juniper nodded, getting her role in the whole scheme.

"So, once you have proof of the transactions between your parents and Bianca, your evidence chain will be complete?" Juniper asked.

Isabella shook her head. "Not quite. There's one big piece missing: where my funds went. I invested $30 million in the company, but that money vanished fast. I think my parents didn't use it for business but for something else. I'm digging into where that money went and hope you can keep this under wraps."

Juniper nodded. "Of course, Isabella. You can count on our discretion."

Juniper smiled and started fine-tuning the plan. "To make the biggest splash, you'll need to put on a bit of a show in the coming days. Right now, you look too put-together; you don't look like someone who's been through the wringer. Try to look a bit more worn out. Maybe wear a mask and a hat, like you're trying to stay low-key."

Isabella instinctively touched her face and nodded, realizing she hadn't thought of that.

"Also, we have a pro filming team that will capture footage of how this situation is affecting your life. You can use these scenes to tell your side of the story, but without solid evidence, people online won't buy it. However, once the truth comes out, it'll hit them hard," Juniper explained, and Isabella took notes diligently.

After they wrapped up their chat, Isabella suddenly remembered something.

"Ms. Fox, can you tell me what my husband offered to get you on board? My husband is just a regular office worker. I can't imagine he has the means to hire someone like you," Isabella asked, puzzled.

Juniper recalled that Michael had warned her not to reveal his true identity.

Juniper understood Michael's concern. After all, it was pretty scandalous for an uncle to marry his nephew's ex-fiancée.. What surprised Juniper was that Isabella still hadn't figured out who her husband really was.

"Your husband once saved my life! You know, in our line of work, we might look glamorous, but we make enemies, just like lawyers. I was attacked once and nearly died, but he happened to drive by and took me to the hospital," Juniper casually made up a story.

In reality, Juniper had been attacked and seriously injured once, but it wasn't Michael who saved her. Still, that didn't stop her from using the experience to embellish her story about him.

Isabella didn't really doubt the story. If it was a life-saving favor, it made sense that Juniper would be willing to help.

"In that case, thank you, Ms. Fox. Whether I can get through this public scrutiny depends on you," Isabella smiled, stood up, and shook Juniper's hand, seeing her out of the office.

Meanwhile, John had returned to the Williams Villa after leaving the company.

Mason, leaning on his cane, sat on the opposite sofa and asked, "Weren't you helping Isabella with the PR crisis? How did it go?"

John waved his hand irritably. "Don't ask me that. You should ask Isabella. The PR team she hired is way better than the one I got."

Mason frowned deeply at John's words. At first, he was puzzled about how Isabella, given her current family situation, could afford a better PR team than John's.

But then Mason thought of Michael. If Michael was involved, it made perfect sense.

"Who did Isabella hire for her PR team?" Mason asked John.

John was about to say Juniper's name when Charles suddenly walked in.

"Mr. Williams, there's a woman named Juniper at the door who says she wants to see you," Charles said respectfully to Mason.

The name sounded familiar to Mason. Having been out of touch with business matters for some time, he might have come across Juniper's name before but couldn't recall it.

"Charles, let her in," John said before turning to Mason.

"This Juniper is the most famous PR queen right now. She's the one handling Isabella's PR crisis," John said with a sneer, reclining back on the sofa.

John's groin was still aching from Isabella's attack, even though some time had passed.

'Damn it, I hope it's not permanently damaged. When Bianca gets back from Lumaria, I need to test things out,' John thought to himself.

###chapter 167 Juniper's Purpose

When Mason found out that Isabella's PR team was led by Juniper, he quickly told Charles to bring her in.

Even though Juniper was a big name, it was her first time at the Williams Villa. She kept it cool and didn't let her eyes wander. As soon as she walked in, she spotted Mason chilling on the sofa.

'Michael sure loves to throw curveballs,' Juniper thought. 'I figured handling Isabella was enough, but now I gotta deal with Michael's uncle too. Hope Mason buys what I'm selling.'

"Good morning, Mr. Williams. I've heard a lot about you in the business world. Nice to finally meet you," Juniper said, laying on the charm.

Mason waved it off. "Those were the good old days, nothing special. I'm more interested in you, Ms. Fox."

"And what about me has you so curious? I'm flattered," Juniper joked with a grin.

"Ms. Fox, would you rather stand or take a seat?" Mason pointed to a nearby sofa. Juniper smiled and sat down.

Once she was settled, Mason got straight to the point.

"From what I know, Isabella's current situation shouldn't be enough to afford your PR fees. Why'd you agree to help her? What's in it for you?" Mason asked, eyes locked on Juniper, trying to catch any hint of a lie.

Juniper smiled. "Actually, Isabella hasn't paid me a dime yet. I'm here to ask you for the payment."

Mason was caught off guard, and even John, who was lounging on the sofa, sat up in surprise.

"I don't get it, Ms. Fox," Mason said, frowning.

Juniper kept smiling. "When I saw the news about Isabella, I knew it was a golden opportunity! This case will bring me big rewards, so I approached Isabella myself. I knew she couldn't afford my fees, but you can. You and Isabella are like family, and I believe you'd be willing to cover her PR expenses."

John almost laughed out loud. He thought Juniper must've been paid a fortune to risk ticking him off, but here she was, asking his grandfather for her payment!

"Ms. Fox, you're something else! Coming here to ask us for payment! Aren't you worried we might say no?" John sneered.

Juniper shook her head, still looking at Mason. "Mr. Williams, consider this my gamble-a calculated risk! But I'm confident you'll reward me handsomely."

Mason kept his eyes on Juniper, trying to read her.

After a few seconds, Mason's face broke into a smile.

"Are you sure you can help Isabella out of this mess?" Mason asked, eyeing Juniper.

Juniper nodded confidently. "Piece of cake. I'm 99% sure I can handle it."

Mason liked what he heard. He waved to Charles. "Grab my checkbook."

Charles quickly left the room.

John looked at Mason, clearly annoyed. "Grandpa, are you seriously gonna pay her?"

Mason shot him a look. "Got a problem with that?"

John quickly backed down. "No, just asking. I'll head to my room."

He got up and hurried off, leaving Mason to snort in disdain.

From the moment John walked in, Mason figured he must've had another run-in with Isabella. Useless, as always.

Charles returned with the checkbook, and Mason scribbled down a number, then handed the check to Juniper.

"Ms. Fox, does this amount work for you?" Mason asked with a smile.

Juniper glanced at the check, eyebrows raising.

'Wow, the head of the four major families sure is generous!' she thought, smiling. She was more than pleased with the amount.

"Mr. Williams, your generosity is impressive! I'll make sure Isabella gets through this crisis," Juniper said, bowing respectfully.

Mason nodded, satisfied. "Alright then, I won't keep you any longer. Charles, show her out."

Charles nodded. "This way, Ms. Fox."

After saying goodbye to Mason, Juniper left the Williams Villa with Charles.

Back at her office, Juniper held the check, grinning.

'Getting paid twice for one job feels pretty sweet,' she thought, pulling out her phone to call Michael.

The phone rang twice before Michael picked up. Juniper filled him in on her chat with Mason, just as Michael had suggested, to see if Mason had caught on to something between Isabella and him.

"So Mason bought it and paid you again?" Michael's tone was a bit odd.

Juniper nodded. "Yep, and he was even more generous than you. He paid $2 million more! But think of it as a bonus for my performance. I'm keeping it."

Michael chuckled. He never planned to ask for the money back.

"Got it. You did well. Just remember, don't let Isabella know about my involvement. You know the consequences," Michael said coolly.

"Don't worry, Mr. Williams. I'm a pro," Juniper smiled, then hung up and started planning her next steps.

###chapter 168 Isabella's Consolation

After hanging up the phone, Michael threw on an apron and got to work in the kitchen. Over the past few days, he'd picked up a bunch of new recipes to help ease Isabella's stress, hoping to show his love through some tasty meals.

Just as he finished the last dish, he heard a car engine outside-Isabella was home from work.

The moment she walked in, the delicious aroma hit her.

"Take off your coat and wash up. I've got some new dishes for you to try," Michael said with a grin, setting the food on the table.

Isabella dashed to the bathroom, washed her hands, and then plopped down at the dining table.

Michael grabbed a bottle of red wine, poured them each a glass, and sat across from her.

"So, what do you think of the PR person I found for you?" Michael asked, a curious smile on his face.

Isabella nodded, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "You're incredible! I can't believe you landed the PR queen for me, and even more, you saved her life!"

Michael's smile faltered for a split second but quickly recovered.

'Damn it, what did Juniper tell Isabella? Looks like Isabella asked her the very thing I was worried about. Why didn't Juniper mention this on the phone earlier?' Michael thought, feeling a bit annoyed.

Meanwhile, in her office, Juniper sneezed.

"Feels like I forgot something," Juniper muttered, rubbing her nose, but she shrugged it off.

Isabella went on about her day, talking about Odette's provocations, John bringing in a PR team, and how she ended up kicking him.

Michael listened with a faint smile, but his mind was elsewhere.

'Why does Mason always want John to get close to Isabella?' Michael wondered.

He'd always been puzzled by the relationship between Isabella and Mason. Mason claimed he looked out for Isabella because her grandfather adored her, and as a friend of her grandfather, he felt obliged to care for her too. But there was a big flaw in that logic: Bianca and Isabella shared the same grandfather, yet Mason treated Bianca very differently.

'Maybe I should ask my dad; he might know something,' Michael thought, narrowing his eyes.

"What are you thinking about? Did you even hear what I just said?" Isabella waved her hand in front of Michael's face, a bit annoyed by his daydreaming.

"I was telling you about my day, and you were off in la-la land. What were you thinking about? You're not thinking about another woman, are you?" Isabella swirled her wine, a dangerous glint in her eyes.

Michael quickly shook his head. "No way, you're overthinking it. I was just amazed at how fate works. If I hadn't saved Juniper back then, the PR team I could get for you might not be as good as John's."

Isabella immediately stood up, walked over, and hugged Michael. "Don't worry about it! That idiot John gets played like a fool by women. If it weren't for his good background, he wouldn't have achieved half as much as you have."

She was trying to comfort Michael, hoping he wouldn't feel bad about the situation.

Feeling Isabella's warm embrace, Michael had a different thought.

"If it makes you happy, I don't mind you thinking about other women," Isabella smiled, gently stroking Michael's face.

Michael rolled his eyes. He knew better than to fall for that. When your partner told you it was okay to think about others, it was either a test or a joke. Taking it seriously would only lead to trouble.

"I'm not interested in other women. You're the most beautiful woman to me," Michael said, standing up from his chair and gently stroking Isabella's hair. "But you seem unconvinced, so let me prove it."

Isabella was puzzled. "How?"

Michael leaned in and whispered in her ear, "How about I show you my stamina in bed? That should reassure you that I'm faithful."

Isabella's face turned bright red.

"I haven't even eaten yet," Isabella said, trying to run away, but Michael grabbed her from behind and lifted her onto his shoulder.

"But I can't wait any longer, my dear," Michael said with a laugh, carrying Isabella to the bedroom.

Michael threw Isabella onto the bed, and they playfully wrestled, shedding their clothes piece by piece.

Soon, scattered coats and underwear lay on the floor, and the room filled with their moans and gasps.

While Michael and Isabella were enjoying their intimate moment, a figure arrived at Lumaria's airport.

Bianca was dragging a suitcase, but this time she wasn't in a wheelchair; she was returning home as a healthy person.

'Tomorrow I can finally be back with John! I haven't seen him in so long, I miss him so much! I hope that bitch Isabella hasn't had any contact with him while I've been away,' Bianca thought, her eyes flashing with resentment. Just as she was about to board the plane, her phone rang.

"I told you to stay there for a while longer. Recovering too quickly will raise suspicions," a deep, angry voice said on the other end of the line.

Bianca pouted dismissively. "I've been here long enough. Didn't we already come up with a reason? I got some meds from some medical expert, and they really helped me recover fast."

"Those were just medications! They don't work miracles," the man on the other end shouted angrily.

Bianca remained indifferent. "Relax, Isabella and John are clueless about the meds. They'll just think it's some miracle cure. It's no big deal. Alright, I'm boarding now. Goodbye."

With that, Bianca hung up the phone.

###chapter 169 I Have a Friend

Isabella had no clue Bianca was about to come back home, and they'd be seeing each other soon.

The next morning, Isabella woke up to find Michael still asleep next to her. His muscular body was half-covered by the blanket, just enough to keep things interesting.

She leaned in close and whispered in his ear, "Babe, I'm heading to work."

Michael didn't even open his eyes, just grunted in response.

Isabella got up, got dressed, and headed to the bathroom to freshen up.

After whipping up breakfast for both of them and finishing her meal, she left the villa.

Not long after she left, Michael slowly dragged himself out of bed.

"Man, my back is killing me," he muttered, rubbing his back. Last night had taken a toll on him, thanks to his promise to Isabella.

Michael sat on the bed for a bit, then reluctantly called Benjamin.

Benjamin was confused when he picked up the call.

"What's up? Did you and Isabella have another fight? Need some relationship advice?" Benjamin teased.

Michael was quiet for a moment before saying, "My back's sore. Got any tips for that?"

Benjamin burst out laughing. "I know what you need, but dude, I'm just a surgeon. I'm not a kidney expert. But I do know some people who might help. I'll ask around and get back to you."

Michael's face darkened. "Don't you dare spread this around, or you're dead."

Benjamin chuckled. "Relax, I've got this. It's all about your health. I'll get back to you this afternoon."

With that, Benjamin hung up. After a moment of laughing, a bitter smile crossed his face.

Since that drunken night with Amelia, they hadn't been intimate again.

'Damn, in some ways, I really envy Michael,' Benjamin thought, feeling uneasy.

When Benjamin got to the hospital, he didn't head straight to his office but went to another department.

"Mr. Cox, I have a question. I have a friend who's been, uh, overdoing it with his wife, and now his kidneys are feeling the strain. Any advice?" Benjamin asked.

Louis Cox gave him a weird look. "Are you sure this is for a friend? You don't have to hide it from me. As your colleague, I won't tell anyone."

Benjamin's face soured, realizing how odd his question sounded.

Everyone knew that "It's for a friend" was code for "I'm too embarrassed to ask this myself."

"I'm serious. It's not me; it's for my friend," Benjamin insisted, his face darkening.

Louis stood up, patted Benjamin's shoulder, and said, "No need to explain further. I can see it in your pale face and those dark circles. Your body is clearly going through something. You should check out the doctors at Emberlyn. They might be exactly what you need. I know someone there - let me give you their contact."

Louis handed Benjamin a business card from his drawer.

With a somber expression, Benjamin muttered a thank you and left Louis's office.

As Louis watched him leave, he shook his head and sighed. "People don't control themselves when they're young, and it catches up with them later."

Benjamin gave the doc at Emberlyn a ring. The doc recommended meeting face-to-face, saying some things were better talked about in person than over the phone.

Benjamin passed this info to Michael, leaving the decision up to him.

Meanwhile, when Isabella arrived at the company, she was surprised by the crowd at the entrance.

At first, she thought it was the usual troublemakers trying to get her fired, but then she noticed they had microphones and realized they were reporters.

Since they were reporters, security couldn't just shoo them away like before.

"Ms. Taylor, maybe we should use the back entrance?" Leo suggested.

Isabella shook her head, took out a mirror, and applied some makeup.

"Leo, do I look haggard?" she asked.

Leo glanced at her and smirked. "Ms. Taylor, I had a friend who used to smoke weed. You look a lot like him right now."

Leo admired her makeup skills.

Isabella nodded, deciding to go with this haggard look for her upcoming plan.

When she got out of the car, the reporters swarmed her.

"Isabella, did you really abandon your parents?"

"Isabella, did you know your parents were almost buried alive? What do you have to say about that?"

"Isabella, can you tell us about your current husband? Is he really the scoundrel your parents claim he is?"

###chapter 170  Bianca Came to Apologize

The reporters swarmed around Isabella, firing off questions left and right.

The security guards at the entrance quickly muscled their way through the crowd to shield Isabella, keeping the reporters at a distance. But the reporters stretched out their arms, trying to shove their microphones closer to her.

As the security team escorted Isabella to the company entrance, she suddenly turned around, grabbed one of the reporters' microphones, and gave a weary smile.

"Can everyone please calm down? I'll answer your questions one at a time," Isabella said, sounding exhausted.

The reporters went silent at her request.

Holding the microphone, Isabella looked completely worn out, her eyelids drooping like she hadn't slept in days. "First off, about the rumor that I fled alone, I have no idea where you got that from. No one was trying to hurt me, so why would I run away? I went abroad because my husband's family lives there, and I went to visit his parents."

A reporter shouted, "But your parents said they were almost buried alive because you offended the Brown Family!"

Isabella's eyes welled up, and a tear slipped down her cheek. "If you've talked to the police, you'd know I'm the victim here! I was kidnapped by Pearl. As for what happened to Pearl, I have no idea! And about my parents saying they were almost buried alive by the Browns, you can ask Paxton, the current head of the Brown Family."

The reporters internally groaned. They didn't have the guts to confront Paxton, and even if they did, he wouldn't admit to anything.

Isabella knew this, so she threw Paxton under the bus. Jasper and the others were trying to whip up a frenzy, so she figured she'd let Paxton deal with her parents.

Isabella believed once Paxton saw his name in the news, he'd probably sue her parents for defamation.

What was the truth? As long as Paxton didn't admit it, none of it would be considered true.

"Lastly, I'm deeply shocked and hurt by my parents' accusations online! My husband and I love each other very much, despite what they claim. I oppose their interference in my marriage because I want to be free! We all have the right to pursue our own love! But my parents clearly see me as a tool for the family's revival, which is incredibly heartbreaking," Isabella said, suddenly covering her face as tears streamed through her fingers, looking deeply pained.

"I'm really sorry, but I've said all I need to. I have to get to work." Isabella shook her head, handed the microphone back to the reporter, and dashed into the company.

Once inside, Isabella headed straight to the design department. As she stepped in, she unexpectedly saw Bianca.

"What are you doing here? Is your kidney disease cured? How did you recover so quickly?" Isabella raised an eyebrow, looking at Bianca in surprise.

Bianca crossed her arms, smiling, but her eyes were full of malice. "Isabella, I heard about what happened to you recently. It's really tragic! Maybe you should just apologize to Jasper and Mia. I'm sure they'd forgive you."

Isabella just stared at Bianca, not saying a word. Seeing Isabella's pale and haggard face made Bianca feel even more triumphant.

"Isabella, look at the mess you've caused. Now the employees have to sneak in through the back. Don't you feel guilty? This is all because of you!" Bianca declared with a smirk.

Madeline and her assistant Odette walked over, joining the scene.

Odette, standing behind Bianca, nodded. "Ms. Taylor, your cousin is right! Your drama shouldn't mess with the whole company."

Isabella glanced at Madeline, Odette, and Bianca, realizing they had formed some sort of alliance. She wondered what kind of scheme they were cooking up.

Isabella gave Bianca a cold smile. "A few days ago, Mason called me, asking if I needed help. I said no. I brought you up in our chat, and guess what he said?"

Bianca raised an eyebrow but stayed silent.

"Mason said he believes I'm not the kind of person my parents claim I am. He also said he would never let you into the family! Even if he dies, he will put it in his will that John cannot marry you if he wants to inherit anything!" Isabella said, watching Bianca's face turn pale and venomous.

Isabella took a step closer to Bianca, her smile becoming more manic. "My dear cousin, but there's a loophole in that will. Mason only barred John from marrying you, not from keeping you as his...kept woman. You could still be his mistress, flaunting it to the world! But that's all you'll ever be to him."

Bianca clenched her fists tightly.

Odette stepped forward, about to say something, but Isabella's sharp gaze stopped her.

"Did you bring Bianca into the company?" Isabella suddenly asked.

Odette instinctively nodded.

Isabella's lips curled into a cold smile. "Who gave you the right to bring an outsider into the company? Don't you know Bianca once stole my designs, causing significant reputational damage to the company? Are you planning to let her continue stealing from our design department? Who gave you the guts?"

Isabella then turned to Madeline. "Madeline, did Odette get your permission? Did you inform Mr. Larson about bringing a thief to the company?"

Isabella's words drained the color from Madeline and Odette's faces. Bianca had come to them today with a plan to take down Isabella, making them momentarily forget Bianca's past actions.

Madeline bit her lip, knowing she couldn't let Dwayne find out about this, or she would be punished.

Quickly, Madeline came up with a solution. She pointed to Bianca and said to Isabella, "Your cousin came to apologize to you! That's why we brought her in."

###chapter 171 The Embarrassing Bianca

Madeline's words left Isabella momentarily stunned. Bianca, too, was stunned. She had no intention of apologizing.

However, Bianca quickly realized that this might be her best excuse to enter the company.

"Isabella," Bianca said, all sweetness and light, "I'm so sorry about what happened before. The online harassment freaked me out, so I couldn't face you. But things are calmer now, and I heard about your mess. I feel for you, really. So, I'm here to say sorry. Please, accept my apology." She squeezed Isabella's hand.

To Bianca's surprise, Isabella didn't pull away but instead smiled warmly.

"I didn't expect you to think of me even while undergoing a kidney transplant, Bianca. I'm deeply touched by your concern. Since you care so much about me, of course, I'll accept your apology." Isabella gently patted Bianca's hand, her face showing a kind smile.

Bianca's smile froze, and Isabella's reaction made her uneasy.

"Isabella, it's so good that you think this way." Bianca forced a smile.

"Of course, we're not letting this little thing come between us. We practically grew up together. I even helped you with your homework, remember?" Isabella brought up their childhood, subtly mocking Bianca.

But Isabella wasn't going to forgive Bianca so easily; she had other plans.

"My dear cousin, I can forgive you, but that doesn't mean the public will be so lenient about your past deceit! A quick online apology won't cut it. You need to apologize to the public as well," Isabella said, waving her hand.

"Everyone in the design department, please look over here. If you have friends in other departments, please call them here. I have an important announcement to make," Isabella called out, standing on a chair. The surrounding colleagues looked over curiously.

Madeline and Bianca turned pale, realizing what Isabella intended to do.

"Isabella, there's no need to make such a big scene. You're making me feel very embarrassed," Bianca said, forcing a very awkward smile.

Isabella stepped down from the chair, patted Bianca's head, and said seriously, "Sweetheart, a real apology needs to be heartfelt. You misled so many people online, and they're all waiting to hear from you. I've already told you, apologizing to me isn't enough. You owe those you deceived a proper apology as well."

Isabella then contacted Dwayne to inform him of Bianca's planned apology.

In his office, Dwayne was stunned for several seconds after receiving Isabella's call. After she hung up, his mouth twitched.

"What's going on now? Damn it, who let Bianca in?" Dwayne muttered, thinking that the design department might need a major personnel reshuffle.

Dwayne immediately phoned Michael, updating him on the situation with Isabella. Michael had previously ordered him to report anything concerning Isabella.

Michael smiled upon receiving Dwayne's call.

"Isabella wants you there for her cousin's apology, so you're going. And get people from all departments - everyone, including the cooks andthe cleaning crew," Michael commanded.

Dwayne started to protest, but thought better of it. He just nodded, then ended the call.

"Bianca is such an idiot. Why did she have to mess with Isabella? Isabella's caught in a media storm. Instead of watching the show at home, Biana came here to stir things up. She's just asking for trouble," Dwayne muttered, complaining about Bianca's foolishness while gathering employees from various departments to the design department.

With Dwayne's help, soon all the company's employees gathered in the design department. Due to the limited space, some even stood on tables.

Despite the crowd, the room was silent. Everyone was looking at Bianca with curious and puzzled expressions.

Moments before, all of the employees received directives from management to assemble in the design department and observe. They were instructed to maintain silence until they were told to return to their work.

On the way, some learned about the situation in the design department and shared it with their colleagues. They were all eager to see Bianca apologize, especially since they had been deceived by her and had insulted Isabella online, only to feel foolish when the truth came out.

Bianca's face was extremely grim. With so many people watching her, she felt immense pressure, as if Isabella was publicly humiliating her.

Once all the employees had gathered, Isabella stood on a chair and pointed at Bianca, smiling. "Everyone knows her, right? This is my cousin, Bianca. She stole my designs during the company's design competition. Many people were deceived by her, but there's something I need to say."

Isabella's expression turned serious and kind. "Bianca is my cousin, and I'm willing to give her a chance to admit her mistakes. Today, with Ms. Eve's help, my dear cousin has come here to apologize to me. I'm so glad she's owning up to her mistakes and wants to make things right. Everyone, phones out - let's get this apology on record! Remember how sorry she is, and let's move on."

Isabella then jumped off the chair, held Bianca's hand, and smiled. "Bianca, are you ready? You can start your apology now."

Bianca glared at Isabella with venomous eyes, her fists clenched so tightly that her knuckles turned white.

###chapter 172 Bianca's Apology

Under everyone's watchful eyes, Bianca shut her eyes tight, took a deep breath, and gritted her teeth. "I'm Bianca, and I'm here today to apologize to my cousin..."

Before she could finish, Isabella cut her off with a wave.

"Wait a sec, Bianca. Something's off," Isabella said, tilting her head as she looked Bianca over. Then, as if struck by a brilliant idea, she clapped her hands.

"That's it! You shouldn't be standing on the ground. You need to be up higher, like I was, so everyone can see you properly. People in the back can't see you. You need to be up higher to make this apology count," Isabella said, dragging over a taller stool for Bianca.

Bianca was about to lose it. Inside, she fumed, 'This woman is just trying to humiliate me!'

She shot Isabella a look that could kill. If looks could do damage, Isabella would be full of holes by now.

"Come on, my dear cousin, don't be shy. Get up there. Everyone's waiting for your apology," Isabella said, patting the stool.

Madeline suddenly realized the stool looked familiar. Wasn't that her office chair? What was Isabella up to, making Bianca stand on her chair?

"Isabella, you..." Madeline started, but a cold stare cut her off.

She turned to see Dwayne watching her quietly.

Earlier, Isabella had hinted that Bianca was brought in by Madeline. Dwayne didn't believe for a second that Bianca was here just to apologize. He could guess what Madeline was up to.

Dwayne was furious about this behavior that messed with the company's harmony.

Madeline stopped mid-sentence, giving Isabella the opening she needed.

"Ms. Eve, got something to say?" Isabella smiled at her.

Everyone else turned their attention to Madeline.

Madeline felt like she was being pricked by a thousand needles, making her squirm.

Taking a deep breath, she forced a strained smile. "Ms. Taylor, I was just going to say your idea is spot on. Bianca should definitely stand higher so everyone can see her."

"Ms. Eve, I'm glad you're on the same page. Thanks for bringing my cousin into the company. Without your help, security might have turned her away at the entrance. I'm truly grateful for the opportunity you've given her," Isabella said, feigning gratitude as she held Madeline's hand.

The colleagues around them looked at Madeline with mocking eyes, their gazes like flames, almost melting her.

Bianca's expression clearly indicated that she wasn't there to offer a sincere apology.  She was there to taunt Isabella, who had previously humiliated her.

Everyone knew about the beef between Isabella and Madeline.

Isabella kept hammering home that Madeline was the one who brought Bianca in, just to make her look bad in front of the higher-ups.

"Alright, Isabella, enough already. Let your cousin apologize so we can all get back to work," Madeline said with a forced smile.

Isabella's lips curled into a cold smile as she turned to Bianca.

"Come on,why aren't you on the stool yet? Get up there! We're all waiting for your apology," Isabella urged.

Bianca's fists clenched so tight that her nails dug into her palms, causing pain.

Once she was on the stool, she saw mocking stares and raised phones, and a wave of dizziness and anger washed over her.

'Just wait, Isabella. I'll pay you back for this humiliation tenfold, a hundredfold!' Bianca cursed inwardly, though she kept her face calm.

Finally, as the employees started to get restless, Bianca took a deep breath and began her apology.

"Hey everyone, I'm Bianca, Isabella's cousin. In the last design competition, I stole my cousin's work and claimed it as mine. I thought it was just a prank, but I didn't realize how much it would affect her. I'm sorry for taking up your time. I've learned my lesson and will do better in the future. Please forgive me," Bianca said, bowing to everyone.

"Alright, now that the apology is done, let's all get back to work," Madeline called out, trying to wrap things up.

But Isabella wasn't done. "Hold on, this isn't over yet. I just had an idea."

She turned to Bianca with a smile. "My dear cousin, remember the media attention after your plagiarism and lies? I was the focus of the news then. Well, since the media was involved last time, they should be involved this time too. There are reporters outside; we can use them to publicize your apology. I'm sure they'll love this story."

"Are you out of your mind? What are you trying to do?" Bianca screamed, trying to jump off the stool.

"Watch your tone. Lots of people are recording this!" Isabella said coldly, her icy stare making Bianca freeze.

Isabella pointed to the phones recording the scene. "Even if our colleagues post your video online, it won't get much attention. You're not a big star, after all. But using the media will make sure the public sees your sincerity."

Turning to Dwayne, Isabella said, "Mr. Larson, could you bring in the reporters from outside to film my cousin's apology?"

A smile played on Dwayne's lips. He nodded and headed for the door.

###chapter 173 Excited Reporter

Glenn Cole was an intern reporter at the newspaper, and his editor had sent him out to cover a story. He thought it might be something big, but to his dismay, it turned out to be just a couple griping about their daughter-pretty much the kind of boring stuff they always dumped on interns like him.

But now, Glenn was buzzing with excitement. Because earlier, Dwayne had called him and a few other reporters into the company building, where they caught Bianca on camera, apologizing.

Glenn knew all about the beef between Bianca and Isabella. The plagiarism scandal had just started to die down, but people still remembered it. And with Isabella being so popular right now, Bianca's apology was bound to make waves.

"Reporters, you should have recorded my cousin's apology. Please make sure to show her in a good light, as her apology is sincere," Isabella said, sounding like she was trying to be nice but really just making Bianca squirm.

"Don't worry, Ms. Taylor. We're professionals, and we'll report this accurately," Glenn replied with a polished smile.

"Alright, since the apology is over, everyone please get back to your work. Bianca, since you're done with your apology, please leave the company. These reporters might have some questions for you, but to avoid further disruption, please answer them outside," Isabella said, dismissing the employees with a smile directed at Bianca.

Bianca didn't dare show any anger in front of the reporters. She kept her head down and quickly bolted out of the building.

"A post-kidney transplant patient with uremia running that fast-she's not even trying to hide it," Isabella muttered, rolling her eyes.

Isabella's voice was so low that the surrounding reporters didn't catch it. They were all focused on Bianca. After she left, the reporters said their goodbyes to Isabella and chased after her.

Among the reporters, Glenn was the fastest. He was the first to catch up to Bianca, shoving his microphone in her face and asking, "Ms. Taylor, was your apology sincere?"

Other reporters quickly crowded around her.

"Ms. Taylor, why did you choose to apologize when your cousin is in the middle of a media storm? Is there any special reason?"

"Ms. Taylor, do you really have a good relationship with your cousin?"

Bianca clenched her fists, clearly fed up with the reporters. She grabbed her hair and screamed, "Get away from me! All of you, get lost!"

As she screamed, she flailed her arms wildly. The reporters dodged, and she took the chance to dash to a nearby taxi, urging the driver to take off quickly.

As the taxi sped away, a grin spread across Glenn's face. His newspaper would definitely have a headline-grabbing story today.

Meanwhile, in Dwayne's office, Madeline and Isabella stood in front of him.

"Isabella, I get where you're coming from, but next time, run these things by me first," Dwayne sighed. This whole mess was going to need some serious damage control from the PR team to avoid another scandal.

Isabella smiled and nodded. "I'm sorry, Mr. Larson. I didn't think it through."

Dwayne waved Isabella off but motioned for Madeline to stay.

Once they were alone, Dwayne's expression turned icy.

"Madeline, why did you let Bianca into the company? Don't you know she caused a scandal before?" Dwayne glared at her.

Madeline fidgeted with her fingers and bit her lip, filled with regret. She understood that scheming with Bianca against Isabella should have been kept private, not in the workplace. She hadn't thought about the consequences.

Dwayne stared at her in silence, his anger growing. "Don't tell me you brought her here to apologize. I can see through insincerity. I know what you're planning! Whether it's you or Isabella, anyone endangering the company's interests will face consequences! Take this as a warning. If it occurs again, don't expect leniency from me."

Dwayne finished speaking and slammed the table, the loud noise making Madeline jump.

"Get out." Dwayne waved his hand, dismissing her.

Madeline gritted her teeth and left the office, heading back to the design department.

Odette approached her, asking, "Ms. Eve, how did it go?"

Madeline shot her an angry look. Technically, it was Odette who brought Bianca in, but as her superior, Madeline had to take the heat.

"I hope you'll be smarter next time and not make such a dumb mistake again!" Madeline snapped, glaring at Odette.

Odette shrank back, knowing Madeline was furious.

"Ms. Eve, I've got some news from the other colleagues. I think you'll find it interesting," Odette quickly said.

Madeline gave her a cold look. "What is it? Spit it out."

Odette hurriedly shared the info. "I overheard two colleagues saying they saw Isabella and Mr. Hamilton leaving a hotel together."

Madeline immediately turned to look at Odette. "Are you sure?"

Odette nodded. "That colleague lives near the hotel. He saw it clearly-it was definitely Isabella and Kevin."

Madeline's fists clenched. She'd never bought that Isabella had beaten her fair and square.  She'd always suspected something was up between Isabella and Kevin, and now it looked like she'd been right.  Things weren't as simple as they seemed.

"Ms. Eve, you're far too talented to have lost to Isabella! It's obvious now - she cheated to get Kevin's favor. Let's expose her and clear your name," Odette said.

###chapter 174 Jasper's Contract

Madeline thought for a second and then shook her head.

"Let's not mess with Isabella right now. She's in a bad spot with the media and could get unpredictable. Desperate people do desperate things. Plus, all we saw was her leaving the hotel with Kevin; that's not enough proof. Let's wait until we have something solid," she said, deciding to give Isabella a break for now.

Odette nodded, still a bit hesitant but accepting the decision.

Meanwhile, Isabella had no clue about any of this. If she did, she'd probably laugh at them for giving her more time.

Back at her office, Isabella got a call from Michael.

"Hey, guess why I'm calling?" Michael's voice had a playful tone.

Isabella smiled, "You must have some good news, right? Let me guess, did my parents meet with Bianca?"

"Exactly! You're so sharp! Your parents and Bianca are having a heated discussion about formalizing their agreement with a contract," Michael said, watching a surveillance feed on his tablet.

A few minutes earlier, Bianca had shown up at Jasper and Mia's villa. They had heard she went to Lumaria and didn't know when she'd be back, so her sudden visit was a surprise.

"Jasper, Mia, I just came from Isabella's company. She's still not owning up to her mistakes. You need to turn up the media heat on her," Bianca said with a cold smile.

Jasper and Mia exchanged a look; their silence was neither a yes nor a no. This made Bianca uneasy.

"What's wrong? Is the media campaign not working?" Bianca frowned. Media pressure was her go-to move against Isabella.

As long as Mason started hating Isabella because of her bad rep, Bianca and John would have more chances.

Jasper waved his hand with a smile. "Bianca, relax. The media campaign is working great; the public's on our side! Adding more pressure won't be an issue."

"But you don't seem too thrilled. Are you feeling sorry for Isabella? Don't forget, she ditched you when she ran," Bianca said coldly, trying to stir up more hatred in Jasper and Mia.

Jasper waved his hand again. "No need to remind me. I'm not letting her off the hook. From the moment we leaked her info to Pearl, we knew there was no going back. Actually, we have something else to talk about."

"What is it?" Bianca asked, frowning at Jasper.

Jasper smiled. "Bianca, I want to know if our previous agreement still stands."

Bianca raised an eyebrow and nodded. "Of course. As long as you help me marry John, I'll use his power to restore your family's honor."

Jasper rubbed his hands together, flashing a professional smile. "Bianca, it's not that I don't trust you, but these days, a verbal promise just doesn't cut it. I'd like to get it in writing."

Bianca's eyes narrowed, and she stood up from the sofa, glaring at Jasper. "Jasper, what are you trying to say? Don't you trust me? Remember, it was my idea to use public opinion against Isabella."

Jasper leaned back, still smiling. "Bianca, don't get mad. We know it was your idea, but you needed our help to pull it off, right? I'm a businessman, and businessmen rely on contracts. A written agreement is the only thing that reassures me."

Bianca stared at him for a moment before smiling. "So, you're worried that once I marry John, I'll ditch you and give all the benefits to my father?" Her smile was faint, but her eyes were cold.

Jasper dropped the act, leaning back with a smirk. "Bianca, this contract is for both our protection. If you won't sign, it means you've got something else up your sleeve. Look, you want John, you need us. Don't blame me for being careful. My own daughter stabbed me in the back, so why wouldn't you, my niece?"

Bianca clenched her fists, feeling a wave of disgust towards Isabella and her family. Isabella was a bitch, and her parents were no better.

After a moment of silence, Bianca nodded. "I get it. When do we sign? Now?"

Jasper stood up, excited. "Yes, right now. Let's not waste any time. I'll go get it."

He rushed into the bedroom and quickly returned with two contracts, a pen, and ink for fingerprints.

Bianca glanced at the contracts on the table and smirked. It seemed Jasper had prepared these well in advance.

She reviewed the contract, which matched her previous verbal agreement with Jasper.

She sighed internally, silently apologizing to her father, then quickly signed her name and pressed her fingerprint on the document. In fact, Jasper had guessed correctly; Bianca had no intention of letting him stay in control of the family. She planned to use him and then discard him. She hadn't expected Jasper to be smart enough to bind her with a contract.

Now, Bianca's mind was focused on marrying John. She decided to deal with the contract later.

None of them noticed the faint red glow in the eyes of a nearby deer head decoration on the wall.

###chapter 175 Severing Parental Ties

The whole scheme between Bianca, Jasper, and Mia got caught on a hidden camera.

Michael saved all the footage. That evening, after Isabella got off work, Michael took her and Juniper out to a restaurant.

In a private room at the restaurant, Juniper watched the videos Michael had brought along.

"Ms. Fox, now that we have these videos, when can we make our move?" Isabella asked Juniper.

Juniper glanced at the quiet Michael, then turned to Isabella with a smile. "We could release these videos whenever, but they might not go viral right away. Things on the internet take time to catch on unless we find a better moment to strike."

Just as Juniper finished talking, her phone rang. Seeing it was one of her employees, she answered, and her face lit up with surprise.

"Alright, got it. This is perfect timing. I'll let Isabella know." Juniper smiled as she hung up.

Isabella looked at Juniper, sensing she had something important to share.

"Isabella, it looks like luck is on your side. I just got some news that might interest you," Juniper said, opening her phone to show a video link sent by an employee.

It was a news clip released just a minute ago, showing Jasper and Mia making accusations.

"We've been trying to reach out to Isabella for a long time, hoping she'd come back to us. But to our great disappointment, she still refuses. She even cursed and insulted us over the phone. We are heartbroken! After much painful deliberation, we've decided to take legal action against Isabella and formally cut ties," Jasper said, turning his head and clenching his fists as if making a tough decision. Beside him, Mia was sobbing and wiping her tears.

Isabella watched the video with a blank expression; she was already used to this kind of drama.

Isabella handed the phone back to Juniper and asked, "When's the court date?"

"Thanks to the online firestorm, the hearing's just three days away. We'll lay out all the evidence in court - it's gonna be a bombshell!" Juniper licked her lips, clearly enjoying the drama. What could be more thrilling than a courtroom twist?

Isabella smiled and nodded. "In that case, I'll leave it to you, Ms. Fox."

Just then, Juniper's phone rang again. She answered, then paused, her eyes instantly finding Michael's.

Michael met her gaze and immediately knew who was calling.

"Mr. Williams, what can I do for you?" Juniper asked casually.

"Ms. Fox, I assume you've seen the latest video from Jasper and Mia. They're suing Isabella. You're supposed to be a PR queen, but I haven't seen any action from you lately." Mason's calm voice came through the phone.

Juniper grinned confidently. "Mr. Williams, don't worry. If they want to sue, I'll present all the evidence in court and create a shocking twist. It's an opportunity, don't you think?"

There was a brief silence on the other end before Mason asked, "Are you sure about this?"

Juniper chuckled. "Absolutely, I've never been more sure in my entire career."

Mason sighed. "As long as you're sure of yourself. Don't let me down. Isabella's been through enough; I hope she can take this - cutting ties with her parents on top of everything else."

Isabella, touched by his concern, was about to speak when Michael covered her mouth, and Juniper signaled for silence.

"Rest assured, Mr. Williams, I've got this. You can watch the live broadcast or come to the courtroom in person," Juniper said before hanging up with a smile.

Once Juniper ended the call, Michael let go of Isabella, allowing her to speak.

"Why didn't you let me talk? Mason's so worried about me; can't I at least say hi?" Isabella said, rolling her eyes.

Michael's mouth twitched. He had covered Isabella's mouth because he was afraid Mason would realize she was with Juniper, and even more worried that Mason would notice he was there too. If Mason asked Isabella's husband to say something, Michael would be exposed!

Juniper had the same thought but decided to spin a different story.

"We don't know if John is with Mr. Williams. If he learns we have evidence against Jasper and Mia, he might inform Bianca, blowing our cover," Juniper smiled.

Isabella nodded, finding Juniper's reasoning sound, but then she became puzzled.

"Wait a minute, didn't you just tell Mason you were confident? If John was there, wouldn't he hear that too?" Isabella questioned Juniper.

Juniper shook her head with a smile. "John is a very proud person. I've been dragging my feet for days, he's probably questioning my competence. Even though I say I'm confident, he might think I'm bluffing. But if you say it, he's more likely to believe you really have evidence."

Isabella blinked, feeling something was off with Juniper's explanation but couldn't find a reason to argue.

At this point, Michael finally spoke, "Ms. Fox, for the safety of our plan, could you call Mason again to confirm if John is with him? We need to ensure Mason won't leak the information to anyone."

Juniper nodded. "I understand. I'll call him now."

Juniper smiled and dialed Mason's number, explaining her concerns. After confirming that John was not with Mason, she hung up the phone, satisfied.

Meanwhile, in the villa, Mason's eyes darkened. Juniper's call had revealed an important piece of information: Bianca was behind Jasper and Mia's actions against Isabella! He had no idea about this and still thought Bianca was in prison.

###chapter 176 Court Hearing Time

Mason was about to call John to ask about Bianca, but Charles, who had been standing nearby, suddenly stopped him.

"Mr. Mason Williams, I think it's best not to tell Mr. John Williams about this for now," Charles said, looking a bit worried.

"Why not?" Mason asked, frowning in confusion.

Charles replied seriously, "Ever since Bianca went to prison, you've told John to stay away from her and not help her. This has caused a lot of tension between you two. Haven't you noticed John's been acting out? Why not use this chance to let him see Bianca's true colors? Mr. Mason Williams, it's only three days."

Mason took a deep breath, realizing Charles had a point. John was like a compressed spring; he could use pressure to make John obey, but what if he snapped? Then John and Isabella would never get together.

Mason sank into the sofa and waved his hand. "Fine, let's do it your way. Just make sure John doesn't find out about the call I just made. We can't risk him leaking info to Bianca."

"Don't worry, Mr. Williams, I'll handle it," Charles replied respectfully. He then gathered the servants who had overheard the conversation and sternly warned them not to speak of it.

Everyone was waiting for the court hearing in three days. To be precise, it wasn't a full-blown trial, more like a court-supervised mediation.

Regardless of the format, the dispute between Isabella and her parents had become a hot topic, drawing a lot of attention.

Three days flew by. On the day of the session, a bunch of reporters and onlookers gathered at the courthouse entrance.

A reporter, looking serious, reported to the camera, "Hello, everyone. I'm from the News Times. Recently, Isabella, who was involved in a plagiarism scandal, has once again become the center of public attention. Just as she was emerging from that controversy, she's now involved in another, with her parents accusing her of betraying the family. I'll be covering this event live today."

News about the four major families always dominated the city's trending topics. Although Isabella's family had fallen from their ranks, her former glory wasn't easily forgotten. Everyone was curious to see what kind of drama this once-glorious family would present.

Soon, the crowd stirred as a car approached, carrying Jasper and Mia.

The couple stepped out, wearing faint smiles and formal attire, as if attending a banquet rather than a court session.

Some reporters with microphones approached them.

"Mr. Taylor, what are your expectations for this mediation? Do you still hope Isabella will return to your family?" a reporter asked.

Jasper sighed and shook his head at the camera. "If possible, I'd like my daughter to come back, but from her reactions, I don't think she will."

"Mr. Taylor, you and your wife are all dressed up. I thought you've been worn out by everything that's been going on." Another reporter interjected sharply.

Jasper's expression changed slightly, but he quickly regained his composure.

"I want to show Isabella that even without her, my wife and I can live happily!" he said, then led Mia into the courthouse, hoping to avoid more embarrassing questions from the reporters.

However, the crowd stirred again as another car, a plain black sedan, arrived at the courthouse.

Isabella and Juniper stepped out. In contrast to Jasper and Mia's formal attire, Isabella looked very worn out, as if she hadn't slept well for days, with dark circles under her eyes. She wore a simple business suit, looking like a struggling office worker.

Reporters swarmed towards Isabella like sharks smelling blood, but were blocked by bodyguards.

"Isabella, do you have confidence in this court session? Will you win against your parents?" a reporter asked.

Isabella gave a bitter smile and looked at the reporter. "There will be no winners in this court session."

Suddenly, someone noticed Juniper standing next to Isabella. At first, the reporters only found her familiar, but soon recognized her identity.

"Isabella, is this Ms. Fox beside you? The renowned PR queen?" a reporter asked excitedly.

Juniper, known as the PR queen, also had high news value. Everyone figured Isabella was outmatched against her parents, but with Juniper on the case, nobody knew what would happen.

Reporters simultaneously thought of two possible stories: Isabella's amazing comeback, or her spectacular crash and burn.

At this point, the reporters were no longer concerned with the process of the court session; they only cared about the result. If Isabella won, it would be another victory for Juniper. If they lost, it would still be big news.

"Alright, everyone, no more questions. We will update you through a live broadcast. Please keep following the trial," Juniper said with a smile, waving her hand. The bodyguards immediately cleared a path through the reporters.

Jasper and Mia, standing outside the courthouse, also noticed Juniper.

"Jasper, who is that woman?" Mia asked, puzzled.

Jasper frowned, finding Juniper familiar but couldn't place her. It wasn't until the reporters mentioned the title "PR queen" that he remembered.

"She's Juniper, the famous PR queen who has helped many celebrities and tycoons with their public image! Damn it, how did Isabella get her involved?" Jasper frowned, feeling a sudden sense of unease.

Mia, unfamiliar with Juniper and her reputation, scoffed. "It doesn't matter who she is. We're going to win this trial!"

Jasper thought for a moment, then smiled and nodded. Public opinion and the masses were on their side. What difference could Juniper make? Isabella would definitely be the one to lose.

###chapter 177 Three Major Families

Isabella and Juniper trudged up the courthouse steps, spotting Jasper and Mia, but neither group said a word.

Jasper just snorted and led Mia inside.

Isabella, looking pretty down, followed Juniper with a sad look on her face.

As the courtroom doors swung open, the staff showed everyone to their seats. Once they were all settled, the audience started to file in.

The reporters had their cameras all set up, ready to stream the trial live.

When the first audience member walked in, the reporters gasped.

"Oh my God, that's Mason Williams!" one of them blurted out.

Mason, leaning on a cane and helped by John and Charles, slowly made his way in. Even though he was old, his calm gaze made everyone a bit uneasy.

The old lion might have aged, but his presence still sent shivers down spines.

Jasper and Mia, already seated, jumped up in surprise when they saw Mason.

"I thought Mr. Williams didn't like Isabella. What's he doing here?" Mia asked, worried, looking at Jasper.

Jasper was nervous too but tried to play it cool. "Maybe John brought him along to show how awful Isabella really is," he said.

Mia nodded, looking convinced.

Truth be told, John had no clue why Mason wanted to be part of this insignificant broadcast.

After helping Mason to his seat, John whispered, "Grandpa, you should be resting at home. Why are you watching this? It's Isabella's family drama, not ours. And you being here could influence the judge."

Mason shot John a cold look. "Who do you think you are to tell me that?"

The authority in Mason's eyes made John's heart skip a beat. He didn't dare say more and quietly sat next to Mason, waiting for the broadcast to start.

Mason snorted. Ever since he found out John had secretly bailed Bianca out, his disappointment in him had been growing.

'I hope John realizes just how nasty Bianca truly is from watching this broadcast,' Mason thought with a sigh.

Not long after, there was another stir at the door.

This time, it was Paxton.

Paxton's face was blank at first, but he forced a smile when he saw Mason.

"Mr. Williams, didn't expect to see you here," Paxton greeted him.

Mason looked at Paxton coolly and said, "Shouldn't I be saying that? This broadcast doesn't seem to concern you."

"Mr. Williams, how could that be? The Taylor Family was one of the big four. Even though they've fallen, their legacy still matters. I had to come and see for myself. Besides..." Paxton paused, glancing at the reporters.

"There's this crazy rumor online that I tried to bury Isabella's parents alive. It's got me furious and flabbergasted. I've never even thought of doing something like that. I want to take this opportunity to set the record straight and go after the people spreading these lies. They need to face the consequences," Paxton said, looking straight at Jasper and Mia.

Jasper and Mia were taken aback. Isabella had told reporters she didn't know Paxton had tried to bury her parents alive.

Everyone knew the truth, but without evidence, no one could accuse Paxton. Yet Paxton could use this to sue Jasper and Mia.

"If you're here for the broadcast, then sit down and watch," Mason said coldly, giving Paxton a disdainful look.

Paxton shrugged off the look and sat down next to him.

Just then, the door opened again, and a third call was heard.

This time, a young guy named Joseph walked in.

Joseph was a big name, a young member of one of the top four families, and reporters loved to dish about him. They were always on the lookout for juicy gossip about him and other young elites.

Joseph walked in, surprised to see Mason and Paxton, and greeted them. "Mr. Williams, Mr. Brown, good morning! Didn't expect to see you both here."

Mason smiled at Joseph. "Your father didn't come this time?"

Joseph smiled and shook his head. "Dad's been busy, so he sent me to check things out. If he knew you two would be here, he'd probably be here himself. I feel a little out of my depth here."

Mason waved his hand with a smile. "No need to be nervous. This isn't a formal event. Don't worry about who we are. Find a seat and sit down."

Joseph smiled and agreed, then found a seat. Before sitting down, he saw Isabella and waved at her.

Isabella's pale face showed a faint smile in response.

The reporters were thrilled, practically shaking with excitement. Three of the big four families were here. Would the fourth family show up too?

But to their disappointment, the last family didn't send anyone. It made sense; it was strictly the Taylors' family business. The real surprise was that three major families actually showed up.

Meanwhile, Bianca, watching the broadcast at home, bit her lip and frowned. "Three of the top four families are here? Does Isabella have that much influence? No, it must be the Taylor family's lingering power. Looks like I underestimated how much my family still means."

###chapter 178 Call Records

Bianca's eyes sparkled with a daring idea, completely unaware that her downfall was just around the corner.

As time ticked by, the courtroom staff filed in, signaling the start of the live broadcast.

The judge glanced at the three family reps, then at Isabella and her parents, feeling a wave of frustration. Family drama was the last thing he wanted to deal with because it was always so messy. Plus, having three family reps involved just added to the pressure.

Despite his frustration, the judge went through the usual formalities.

After confirming everyone was present, he turned to Jasper and Mia.

"Let's see your evidence," the judge said, cutting to the chase.

Jasper and Mia handed over a police report about their kidnapping and near-burial.

The judge sighed to himself. This wasn't Isabella's doing, and the evidence was weak-it mostly just looked like she'd ditched her parents to save her own skin.

He then turned to Isabella. "Isabella, got anything to say?"

Isabella nodded. "My parents mentioned in a video that the people who kidnapped and tried to bury them were from the Brown Family. Mr. Brown, the head of the Brown Family, is here. Maybe the judge could hear his side of the story."

The judge looked towards the audience, and Paxton immediately stood up, his face darkening. "This has nothing to do with my family. This accusation is completely unfounded!"

The judge felt a bit stuck. Paxton wasn't dumb; he wouldn't admit to something like this.

Jasper quickly stood up and said, "We might have gotten Mr. Brown wrong. After all, his daughter kidnapped my daughter once, so it's not like our suspicions are completely out of left field."

"You say my daughter kidnapped yours. Got any proof? These accusations are ridiculous!" Paxton angrily pointed at Jasper.

Even though Isabella always said Pearl had kidnapped her, she had no proof that Pearl was there during the kidnapping.

Plus, with Pearl's current miserable state, everyone saw her as a victim. Without evidence, Paxton's anger made sense.

The judge asked Paxton to calm down and then turned to Jasper and Mia.

"Plaintiffs, your daughter's kidnapping isn't part of this trial. Show me other evidence against your daughter," the judge said.

Jasper nodded and handed over a second piece of evidence, Isabella's travel records to Aurora Continent.

The judge's face fell. This was just as flimsy as the police report-not real evidence.

The judge knew Jasper was trying to sway public opinion.

The judge's decision needed evidence, but public opinion didn't. People would judge based on what they believed.

The judge looked at Isabella. "Isabella, got anything to say?"

Isabella nodded and stood up. "I don't see how my parents almost getting buried alive has anything to do with me. But yeah, I did go overseas to see my husband's family. What Mr. Taylor presented isn't evidence."

'Of course, I know this isn't real evidence. This is just a battle of public opinion,' the judge thought to himself.

At that moment, Juniper, sitting next to Isabella, stood up. "Your Honor, I have something to say."

The judge looked at her curiously. "Ms. Fox, what do you want to say?"

He knew Juniper and was curious about her.

As a skilled public relations professional, she expertly managed online public perception, often portraying involved parties in a sympathetic light to protect their reputations. But during Isabella's media storm, Juniper and her team seemed to have done nothing, letting public opinion brew, which was unusual.

Juniper smiled at the cameras. "As everyone can see, Mr. Taylor's accusations against Ms. Taylor are based on pure speculation, not solid evidence. His attempt to manipulate public perception and control the narrative through calculated ambiguity is highly irresponsible."

Everyone in the room raised their eyebrows. While it was common knowledge, saying them out loud was pretty bold.

Jasper jumped up angrily. "Madam, watch your words. These are facts, not baseless speculation!"

"You call those facts? Let's see if my next evidence qualifies as such," Juniper said, a smile playing on her lips as she produced a document.

"This document contains the call logs from the day Isabella was kidnapped. Before she was kidnapped, she made a call to the police and also received a call from her mother. During that call, Isabella mentioned her next destination to her mother, and then she was kidnapped." Juniper's words made everyone turn to look at Mia in astonishment.

Mia's face turned pale. She quickly stood up and said, "What are you implying? Are you suggesting that I would give my daughter's information to the kidnappers?"

Everyone looked on with suspicion. It didn't seem like something a mother would do.

A cold smile appeared on Juniper's lips as she took out a bank transfer record.

"Please take a look at this. Just 10 minutes after Isabella's call with Mrs. Taylor, $1 million was deposited into Mrs. Taylor's bank account, and the sender was Ms. Brown." Juniper's words shocked everyone again.

Mason stared coldly at Paxton, whose face also darkened.

"I just borrowed money from Pearl! That one million dollars was a loan and has nothing to do with the kidnapping," Mia insisted, her hands waving frantically. However, despite her protestations, the audience had already formed their opinions.

The judge finally showed some interest in the matter.

In fact, the call record and bank transfer provided by Juniper had no specific legal significance; they were also meant to sway public opinion. But Mia's claim that the money was a loan made things more interesting.

"Mrs. Taylor, you say this money was a loan from Ms. Brown. Do you have any records of this loan?" the judge asked, looking at Mia.

###chapter 179 Plot Twist

Mia, of course, couldn't show any loan records. With everyone doubting her, all she could offer was, "I only have call logs with Pearl, and they only show me requesting money. There's no mention of my daughter," she explained.

The reporters then turned to Paxton, since he was Pearl's dad and might know something.

Paxton said coldly, "Why are you all looking at me? I only heard my daughter mention that Mia wanted to borrow money. As for the details, I don't know. It's just a million dollars; I couldn't care less."

Paxton didn't want Pearl to get dragged into this, but he also left himself an out. By telling reporters he was unsure of the specifics, he implied the situation was ambiguous, leaving the burden of proof on Isabella.

The reporters silently cursed Paxton for being so slick, but they were also eager to see if Isabella had more solid evidence.

Isabella didn't let them down. Soon, Juniper brought out the second piece of evidence.

"This is a recording of a conversation between Isabella and her father! Mr. Taylor spilled some info during the call, and Isabella recorded it." Juniper played the recording from Isabella's phone.

Everyone clearly heard the exchange between Isabella and her dad.

Jasper: "Why are you calling me? Ready to admit defeat?"

Isabella: "Mr. Taylor, this is your first and last warning. Take those videos down immediately, and I can pretend this never happened. Otherwise, you won't be able to handle the consequences. I won't let you get away with slandering me online."

Jasper: "Am I lying? Is it a lie that I tried to stop you from being with that man? Is it a lie that you defied us for him? Is it a lie that we almost got buried alive by Paxton because of you?"

Jasper's voice was clear to everyone, and Paxton's face turned very dark. But since this had been addressed before, people only glanced at him before focusing back on Jasper and Isabella.

Isabella: "If I agree to help Bianca and John get together, will you delete the videos?"

The reporters were shocked again and turned their attention to John.

John was also stunned, not expecting to be dragged into this. His face quickly darkened, and he even tried to stand up and call Isabella a liar.

But Mason gave his leg a hard slap, coldly staring at him.

"Sit down and listen carefully!" Mason said coldly, making John shiver.

Despite his reluctance, John had no choice but to sit down.

Bianca, watching the live broadcast, also turned pale. Her relationship with John wasn't much of a secret to many people, but having it exposed by Isabella was a huge humiliation for her.

Isabella: "For your information, Mason hasn't called me in the past two days. That means he hasn't seen the video yet. If he finds out, how do you think he'll react?"

The reporters turned their curious eyes to Mason, eager to see his reaction.

But Mason's face stayed calm, giving nothing away.

Jasper: "Don't try to scare me with Mason. As long as everyone believes you're a heartless woman, Mason will be disappointed in you. That'll open the door for Bianca and John, and our family will rise again!"

Mason's calm gaze swept over Jasper and Mia. He had never understood why they were so cruel to their daughter, but now he did. But those two idiots couldn't fathom his thoughts.

At this moment, Jasper and Mia were very pale. They hadn't expected Isabella to record the call.

Jasper immediately stood up, angrily pointing at Isabella, "I never said those things! This is all fake. This recording is fabricated!"

The judge sternly rebuked Jasper, "Mr. Taylor, please remain silent, or I will have to ask you to leave!"

Jasper had no choice but to sit down.

After reprimanding Jasper, the judge continued to listen intently to the recording, finding it more interesting than any boring TV drama.

But he was puzzled. If these recordings were real, why would Jasper believe Bianca would keep her promise to help him restore the Brown family's fortunes?

Many in the audience had the same question. Jasper clearly didn't trust his own daughter, so how could he trust a niece?

Their question was soon answered.

Isabella: "My poor father, do you really think Bianca will keep her promise? Don't forget, Bianca's father also has a claim to my grandfather's inheritance. When my grandfather left everything to you, do you think her father didn't hold a grudge? Think about it, why would Bianca abandon the father who raised her for decades to side with an uncle like you? Do you really think your verbal agreement means anything?"

Jasper: "Isabella, you think you're so smart, trying to screw up our relationship with Bianca. Think again! Because of what you've done, I'm making more videos. Get ready to be hated by everyone."

Bianca felt like her world was falling apart as she watched the broadcast. She angrily threw her remote at the TV, cracking the screen like a spider web.

"Jasper, you idiot! Don't you think before you speak? Don't you know phones can record conversations?" Bianca screamed at the TV, but soon realized something was wrong.

"Did Jasper only think of signing a contract with me after hearing Isabella's suggestion? Did Isabella anticipate this? Could she have recorded or leaked the content of our agreement?" Bianca trembled with fear, her unease growing.

She could only pray Isabella had no other evidence. One recording wasn't enough to prove anything. As Jasper said, recordings could be fabricated.

With trembling hands, Bianca picked up her phone and dialed John's number.

###chapter 180 The Contract

John's face turned dark as he got a call from Bianca right in the middle of the courtroom.

He shot a look at Mason, who instantly knew who was on the other end.

"Don't look at me. Just answer it," Mason said, his voice icy.

John thought about stepping outside to take the call, but Mason stopped him.

"Why bother? Take it here. I want to hear what Bianca has to say," Mason said with a smirk.

With no other option, John answered the call. Bianca's sobbing voice came through, "John, I'm watching the live stream. You have to believe me, I didn't do any of this! Isabella's recording must be fake!"

The courtroom buzzed with whispers. Some folks believed Bianca, while others were skeptical.

Those who believed her thought about how advanced tech is these days. AI can mimic voices and faces, so the recording could be fake.

But the doubters remembered how Bianca had stolen Isabella's work before, making them question her integrity.

John held the phone, hesitated, then tried to comfort her, "I believe you. I trust the judge will make a fair decision."

Despite his words, his eyes drifted to Isabella. For the first time, he realized how formidable Isabella had become; she was a whole new person.

The judge banged his gavel to quiet the room and then looked at Isabella.

"Isabella, this recording can't be used as evidence. Do you have anything else?" the judge asked, curious.

Reporters leaned in, hoping for a big reveal. Jasper, Mia, and Bianca all stared at Isabella, praying she wouldn't have more evidence.

Isabella nodded calmly. "Yes, I have another piece of evidence."

She pulled a USB drive from her pocket and handed it to the judge. "This is a video file. Could you please play it?"

The judge nodded and signaled the staff to play the video.

Jasper and Mia turned pale. They had no idea what was on the video, but they had a bad feeling. Bianca felt the same dread.

'Please don't let it be that video!' Bianca thought, her fists clenched tightly, her nerves on edge.

Everyone was on pins and needles, eager to see what Isabella had up her sleeve. Mason was especially eager to see how Isabella would turn the tables.

John didn't want to believe Bianca was a liar. This video might be the key.

Even Paxton looked intrigued.

The video started playing. The screen showed a scene that Jasper and Mia knew all too well-it was their living room.

Three people were sitting there: Jasper, Mia, and Bianca!

Jasper felt like his world was crashing down. Their house had been bugged with hidden cameras!

Bianca crumpled to the floor, like all the energy had just been sucked out of her. Then, she snapped. She started smashing the already busted TV, tearing through the room like a tornado, breaking remote controls, vases, teapots-everything in her path turned to pieces.

"Jasper, Mia, you idiots! You've ruined me. You're all idiots!" Bianca screamed, losing it completely.

Right then, her phone rang. It was John, but she was too scared to pick up.

Back in the courtroom, the reporters were buzzing. They knew what the video was showing and were practically shaking with excitement, their cameras capturing every second.

Jasper: "Bianca, relax. The media campaign is working great; the public's on our side! Adding more pressure won't be an issue."

The reporters were stunned, and a bit disgusted. Jasper had always played the victim, the poor father betrayed by his daughter, but now he was exposed as a manipulator.

Jasper slumped in his chair, feeling utterly defeated. He didn't need to see the rest; he knew what was coming. The next part would be about the contract.

Bianca: "But you don't seem too thrilled. Are you feeling sorry for Isabella? Don't forget, she ditched you when she ran."

Jasper: "No need to remind me. I'm not letting her off the hook. From the moment Mia and I leaked her info to Pearl, we knew there was no going back. Actually, we have something else to talk about."

The crowd's emotions flared up. Jasper's words clearly showed their involvement in Isabella's kidnapping.

Mason shot a dark look at Jasper and Mia but stayed quiet, waiting for what came next.

When Bianca asked Jasper what he wanted, he finally laid it out.

Jasper: "Bianca, it's not that I don't trust you, but these days, a verbal promise just doesn't cut it. I'd like to get it in writing."

'There really is a contract!' the crowd thought. The reporters were already brainstorming their headlines.

In the next part of the video, after some discussion, Jasper pulled out two contracts.

The camera couldn't catch the details on the papers, but it was enough. The audience could piece it together.

But Juniper wasn't leaving anything to chance. She wanted to expose Jasper, Mia, and Bianca with undeniable proof and make them a public disgrace.

"Please wait a moment. Due to Mr. Taylor and Mrs. Taylor's slander against Isabella, we've reported this to the police. They should have already searched their villa, and you'll soon see the contract," Juniper said with a smile.

Just then, the courtroom doors swung open, and several police officers walked in, holding a clear evidence bag with a piece of paper inside.

The moment Jasper saw the cops, he fainted, realizing he was completely done for.

###chapter 181 Jerk Parents

The live stream cut off suddenly when Jasper collapsed, but by then, no one really cared about the outcome anymore.

Even the judge seemed over it. Sure, the video Isabella provided was sketchy since it was recorded secretly and couldn't be fully used as evidence, but the contract was enough to show Jasper, Mia, and Bianca were in cahoots.

The crowd went nuts, cursing out Jasper and Mia. They'd been duped into thinking Isabella was the villain, but now it was clear she was the real victim.

The judge kept banging his gavel, trying to calm everyone down, but someone had already chucked a shoe at Mia.

"Everyone, chill out! Anyone causing trouble will be kicked out!" the judge warned, pounding his gavel.

The big shots from the three great families stayed quiet in the audience.

Paxton knew the trial was pretty much over with Jasper's collapse. No point in sticking around, so he turned and left.

Mason looked calmly at John, who was clearly freaking out.

"You're calling Bianca, right? Did you get through? Didn't she say the recording was fake? So, is this video fake too? Are the contracts the cops found at Jasper's place fake as well?" Each of Mason's questions hit John like a punch.

"Maybe there's some misunderstanding," John muttered through clenched teeth.

Mason let out a long sigh, like all his energy just drained out of him.

Charles looked at Mason with concern. "Mr. Williams, do you need to step out for a bit?"

Mason waved him off and looked at John. "The truth is right in front of you, and you still don't believe it. Isabella was right; you're a real idiot."

With that, Mason turned away. John gritted his teeth and stormed out.

Charles watched John leave, then turned back to Mason, who had his eyes closed, clearly not planning to stop him.

Charles sighed to himself and turned to the trial, waiting for it to conclude.

After Jasper collapsed, people rushed to check on him. Some thought he was faking it, while others figured he really passed out from anger.

Either way, the trial couldn't go on. Mia, seeing the writing on the wall, rolled her eyes and fainted onto Jasper.

The bailiff whispered to the judge, "Sir, they might be faking it."

The judge glanced at Isabella and motioned her over.

"Your parents might be pretending. What do you want to do next?" he asked quietly.

Isabella looked at her unconscious parents, then at the judge, and smiled. "Give me a minute. I want to say one last thing to the media before you send my parents to the hospital."

The judge nodded, banged his gavel to quiet the room, and then Isabella stepped in front of the cameras. "Before coming here, my parents announced online that they were cutting ties with me. Honestly, I am deeply disappointed in them! Since they are now unconscious, I will finish what they started. I, Isabella, hereby declare that I have no further relationship with Jasper and Mia. From now on, we are strangers."

As she finished speaking, the reporters' cameras went wild, capturing every moment.

The judge banged his gavel again and stood up to announce, "Due to the unconscious state of Jasper and Mia, the trial is adjourned! Arrange for an ambulance to take them to the hospital immediately."

With a wave of his hand, Jasper and Mia were promptly lifted and carried out.

The online sensation ended with a dramatic twist. After the adjournment, reporters swarmed Isabella, bombarding her with questions.

Joseph had planned to congratulate Isabella on her victory, but the reporters surrounded her, making it impossible for him to get close.

He could only stand at a higher point outside the crowd and wave. When Isabella looked over, he made a phone call gesture.

Isabella smiled and nodded at Joseph, who then turned and left the scene.

After dealing with the reporters, Isabella and Juniper left the courthouse.

"Thank you for your help, Ms. Fox," Isabella said, smiling and extending her hand to Juniper.

Juniper shook her hand and joked, "I don't think I did that much this time. Besides using my PR connections to get more attention, my part wasn't as big as your recording."

The incident had already garnered significant public interest, and the presence of the three major families, combined with Juniper's PR influence, had brought the matter to a peak.

Juniper thought Isabella's story would stay in the headlines online for at least a week, maybe even a month.

At that moment, Charles approached Isabella and Juniper, smiling. "Isabella, Ms. Fox, Mr. Williams would like to invite you both for a chat in the car."

Isabella nodded, but Juniper shook her head.

"My deal with Mr. Williams is done, and he probably just wants to say thanks. I'll let Isabella and Mr. Williams have some alone time. I have things to do, so I won't stick around. Tell Mr. Williams I'm sorry I missed it," Juniper said apologetically.

Charles nodded, not refusing her request. Juniper was right; Mason's invitation was simply to express his gratitude.

Once Juniper left, Isabella and Charles got into Mason's car.

Mason looked kindly at Isabella. "Isabella, you've been through a lot lately."

Isabella felt a warm sensation in her heart as she looked at Mason. Her biological parents wanted to drag her into the abyss, but this elderly man, who shared no blood relation to her, treated her like his own granddaughter.

"It's okay, Mason. From the beginning, I never really cared about Jasper and Mia. But what do you plan to do about Bianca?" Isabella asked curiously.

###chapter 182 Michael's Speculation

Hearing Bianca's name made Mason think of John, and his face darkened as he started coughing violently from anger.

Isabella, startled, gently patted his back.

Mason covered his mouth with a handkerchief, coughing for a bit. Once he calmed down, he sighed, "Let's leave her to John. If the heir to the Williams Family can't even handle one woman, that's a huge disappointment."

Isabella wanted to tell Mason about how John and Bianca had nearly killed her, but seeing Mason's pale face, she worried his extreme anger might be too much for him.

"Let's hope John can handle it. Even though I don't have feelings for him anymore, I don't want to see Bianca ruin the family you've built," Isabella said.

Mason sighed again, "Is it the fate of every leader in our family to suffer in love?"

"What do you mean?" Isabella asked, puzzled by Mason's remark.

Mason shook his head, clearly not wanting to elaborate.

"Nothing. Where are you headed next? I can have someone take you," Mason said," Mason offered.

Isabella noticed Mason was changing the subject but didn't mind. She smiled and pointed to the reporters outside. "I plan to keep talking to the reporters. I want to use this opportunity to expand my influence."

Mason was taken aback. "Why? You've never been one to seek the limelight"

Halfway through his sentence, he fell silent as he realized Isabella intended to leverage this media attention for another goal. From the beginning, she knew she would win; Jasper, Mia, and Bianca were just pawns on her chessboard.

"You're becoming more and more like your grandmother...and grandfather." Mason patted Isabella's head.

"If you ever need my help, just let me know. I'll be there for you!" Mason said seriously.

"Thank you, Mason. If I need anything, I won't hesitate to ask." Isabella smiled, nodded, and then opened the car door to walk towards the reporters.

Mason watched her confident, composed figure, his eyes a bit dazed, and he murmured, "Isabella really resembles her."

Charles, sitting in the driver's seat, sighed, gripping the steering wheel without a word.

The atmosphere in the car felt heavy until Mason spoke again, breaking the silence.

"Let's go home." Mason's voice carried a deep weariness.

Charles nodded and started the car, heading towards the Williams Villa.

Meanwhile, Michael was reviewing some documents and files when Jerry knocked and entered.

"Mr. Williams! Good news! Mrs. Williams won! Jasper and Mia fainted in court and were taken to the hospital by ambulance. Mrs. Williams is now giving an interview. Should we send someone to pick her up?" Jerry asked.

Michael remained calm, waving his hand dismissively. "No need. Isabella can handle it herself."

Jerry nodded, picking up on Michael's calm vibe that he already knew the score.

Just as Jerry was about to leave, Michael put down his files.

"Is all the info on the Taylor Family here?" Michael asked, frowning.

Jerry nodded. "Yeah, everything you asked for is here. Did you find something off?"

Michael rubbed his temples, deep in thought. "It doesn't add up. The Taylor family's assets shouldn't be this limited. As one of the four major families, their financial foundation, though not as strong as the Williams Family, should still be comparable to the other two. But the records show that before their bankruptcy, their assets were only on par with the current Brown Family, which is simply impossible."

"Mr. Williams, are you saying there's something fishy with their assets?" Jerry asked, curious.

Michael paced back and forth, hands in his pockets. "Isabella's true goal is to restore her family to its former glory. I thought it would be simple, but it seems her grandfather had some plans we don't know about before he passed away."

Jerry frowned. "But that shouldn't be. When Isabella's grandfather handed the family power to Jasper, if there were any other plans, Jasper would have known. But the way he's handling things, he looks like a total business dummy. Unless..."

Jerry didn't finish his sentence, and Michael completed it for him. "Unless even Jasper didn't know about his father's contingency plans."

Michael turned around, a gleam in his eyes.

"Gather all information on the Taylors, every bit of it! I'm very curious about what treasures Isabella's grandfather left for her before he passed away," Michael said, a slight smile playing on his lips. He always smiled like this when faced with a challenge.

Jerry nodded and left Michael's office.

After Jerry left, Michael took out his phone and called Isabella.

Isabella had just finished her interview with the reporters. Feeling exhausted after answering all the questions, she sat in her car, ready to head home, when she received Michael's call.

"Congrats on your success, my dear. How about we celebrate tonight?" Michael asked with a smile.

Isabella thought for a moment and then nodded. "Let's invite Amelia and Benjamin too. It would be great to celebrate together!"

Michael's smile froze for a second. He'd planned a private celebration, but the thought of sharing the happiness made him agree to her idea.

"By the way, honey, I heard Jasper and Mia were taken to the hospital by ambulance. What are your plans for them?" Michael asked curiously.

Isabella squinted her eyes and smiled. "I've already arranged for Juniper to handle the next steps. She'll take care of everything."

###chapter 183 Broken Collaboration

Jasper and Mia woke up not long after they got there. They'd been pretending to be out cold, which fooled the clueless bystanders but not the doctors.

In the hospital room, Jasper and Mia sat quietly on their beds.

"So, what now?" Mia asked, glancing at Jasper.

Jasper frowned, thinking for a bit before saying, "Let's call Bianca. Maybe she can figure out a way to get us out of here."

Mia's face fell. "You really think she can help? Our contracts with her are already out in the open. There's no way John will still back her."

"Got a better plan? We have to try," Jasper snapped, shooting Mia a look.

With a sigh, Mia dialed Bianca's number.

After a couple of rings, Bianca's raspy voice came through. "Why are you calling me?"

Mia quickly explained their need to leave the hospital.

Bianca let out a cold laugh. "You've got some nerve asking for my help. If I hadn't trusted you, I wouldn't be in this mess! John's been blowing up my phone, and I can't even answer! Don't call me again; I can't do anything for you."

With that, Bianca hung up. When Mia tried calling back, she found her number was blocked.

"That witch is just as bad as Isabella. We never should've trusted her!" Jasper fumed, slamming his fist on the bed.

Mia's face was sour. She walked over to the window, lifting the curtain slightly to see a crowd gathered below.

A bunch of angry people in the crowd were waving signs with their faces, all splattered with red paint. They were clearly out for blood after Mia and Jasper cheated them.

With that mob outside, Jasper and Mia didn't dare leave the hospital.

Meanwhile, Bianca wasn't doing much better. After Isabella exposed the contract, Bianca had quickly left her home.

Now, she was hiding out in a small cabin in the countryside, a place John had bought during one of their hunting trips.

John had so many properties he probably didn't even remember this one. But Bianca had turned it into a little getaway spot because of its great location.

Bianca didn't dare go home, knowing it would be swarmed with people.

Just then, her phone rang. Seeing the caller ID, she quickly picked up.

As soon as she answered, a stream of insults came through. "You're a complete idiot! Look at the mess you've made! I told you Mason wouldn't last long. Once he dies, you could marry John. But you just had to let your jealousy get the better of you and mess with Isabella. Now, you've blown your chance to join the Williams Family!"

Bianca went pale from the scolding. Clenching her phone tightly, she snapped back, "So what if Isabella got me this time? John still loves me. I still have a chance!"

"You've got no chance left. Turn on the TV and watch the latest news. See what Mason told the reporters!" The caller hung up, clearly pissed.

Bianca felt a wave of dread. She quickly opened her laptop to check the news. Soon, a headline caught her eye.

#Retired Mason Reappears to Hold a Press Conference.

Bianca clicked on the headline, and what she saw made her face go white.

Supported by Charles, Mason stood before the cameras, looking serious. "In front of all the media, I am making this declaration: If John wants to inherit my estate, he absolutely cannot marry that vile woman, Bianca! This will be written into my will!"

Bianca slammed the laptop shut, trembling. Mason's statement had just made the public outrage even worse.

His message was clear: if John married Bianca, he'd lose his spot as the family heir. Without that title, John would be stripped of everything by the family, ending up with nothing.

Bianca quickly redialed the previous number.

This time, when the call connected, the other end was silent. Bianca immediately said, "I know I messed up. Is there any way to fix this? I can't lose John, and he can't lose his status as the heir."

A cold laugh came from the other end. "Now you're scared? Why didn't you listen to me before?"

Bianca screamed into the phone, "Stop blaming me! We need to figure out how to fix this mess. Or else you'll never get what you want!"

There was a brief silence before the voice on the other end replied, "Don't worry. Even though Mason said that, it's not like he can just make it happen. The Williams family only has John as an heir. Mason can't just pop out another son. So unless John's dad has another kid, John's still the heir."

Bianca sighed in relief at the analysis. Indeed, Mason had no other choice. He had only one grandson, John, unless he wanted to hand the family over to his long-lost brother.

"What should I do next? I don't even dare to answer John's calls. What should I tell him?" Bianca asked.

The other end laughed coldly. "John has always trusted you. Just pin it all on Jasper and Mia. Tell John you were just their pawn."

###chapter 184 Voluntary Surrender

Bianca listened intently to the advice given over the phone.

After hearing the entire plan, Bianca asked, puzzled, "Why do we have to regain control of the Taylor family? Isn't it already bankrupt? Jasper and Mia's control over those three failed companies is not worth it; we might as well start a new company."

The voice on the other end replied coldly, "Just do as I say. I suspect Jasper's father left something behind in the company. Jasper may be foolish, but he couldn't have blown through the family's cash that quickly. There must be a secret, and those missing assets are crucial for us."

Bianca frowned and agreed reluctantly.

While Bianca was contemplating how to manipulate John, Jasper and Mia were also devising a plan to escape their predicament.

"Heartless parents like you don't deserve to live in this world!"

"Jasper, Mia, you've shamed the whole idea of being parents!"

"You'll pay for what you've done!"

The crowd outside the hospital was not dispersing; instead, it was growing larger. They held various signs and angrily shouted at the hospital.

These people, who once insulted Isabella, were now directing even more anger at Jasper and Mia.

"What should we do now? Those people outside want us dead," Mia cried.

"Can you stop bothering me? I'm trying to think of a solution, and your crying is distracting me!" Jasper shouted irritably.

Mia, on the verge of a breakdown, no longer cared about Jasper's attitude. She angrily retorted, "I should never have trusted you! I told you Bianca was trouble, but you wouldn't listen! We've been played, you idiot! Where's your brain? You think you're so smart!"

Jasper stood up from the bed and slapped Mia hard. "Did you ever stop me when I was doing all this? Now you're trying to blame me?"

"How dare you hit me? I've been helping you all along, and you hit me? I even sold out my daughter for you!" Mia screamed, clawing at Jasper's face, and they started fighting.

"Isabella is my daughter too! Didn't you agree to this? What right do you have to say it's my fault?" Jasper shouted, swinging his fists at Mia.

As they fought, the ward door suddenly opened, and a doctor walked in.

The doctor frowned at the scene. "Stop. This is no time for fighting. I've checked you both; you're good to go. Get out of here now. Because of you two, the hospital's operations have been seriously disrupted!"

"No, doctor, you can't do this. If we go outside, the crowd will tear us apart," Mia pleaded, crying.

The doctor looked at the couple with disdain. He knew what they had done to their daughter, and his eyes showed clear contempt. 

"This is a hospital, not a police station! That crowd's getting bigger, and they might storm the place. But they're not gonna mess with the cops. If you're scared, go get police protection," the doctor said and then turned to leave.

After the doctor left, Mia collapsed to the floor, feeling utterly helpless. She didn't know what to do; she didn't want to die. Jasper, however, had a contemplative look on his face.

Suddenly, he clapped his hands, looking excited. "That's it! We can call the police! They can protect us."

Mia looked at Jasper as if he were an idiot. "Even if the police escort us out of the hospital, what about at home? Do you expect the police to protect us 24/7?"

A strange smile appeared on Jasper's face. "We can turn ourselves in! We defamed Isabella and damaged her reputation. They can arrest us!"

There was a hint of madness in Jasper's eyes. Mia took a step back, distancing herself from him.

"You must be crazy to come up with such an absurd plan!" Mia said, shaking her head.

However, Jasper sneered. "Have you forgotten about the money we hid in the bank? We need to survive first so we can get our hands on that money! Defamation and slander won't get us a long sentence. We'll just spend some time in jail, and by the time we get out, things will have calmed down. Then we can take the money and live abroad."

Mia hesitated. Jasper's plan started to make sense to her, so she nodded in agreement.

Jasper immediately dialed the police. Soon, a large group of officers arrived and escorted the couple out of the hospital.

As Jasper and Mia were led out in handcuffs, the furious crowd tried to rush forward but were held back by the police.

Jasper and Mia, terrified by the furious mob, shrank back and hid behind the officers.

"Stone these bastards! Send them to hell!" someone shouted, and objects were thrown at Jasper's face.

The crowd, taking this as a signal, began pelting Jasper and Mia with stones and food scraps.

The police, disgusted by the smell, quickened their pace, shoving the couple into a police car.

"Hurry up and drive! Damn it, if you wanted to surrender, why not just hail a cab?" one officer complained to Jasper and Mia.

But Jasper and Mia didn't dare respond.

The police car soon arrived at the station, and the plan was set in motion.

What Jasper and Mia didn't know was that as they were being taken from the hospital, the doctor who urged them to leave met Juniper in his office.

Juniper placed an envelope on the doctor's desk and patted his shoulder with a smile. "You did a great job!"

The doctor glanced at the envelope and shrugged indifferently. "It was an easy task, just suggesting they turn themselves in to the police. I wonder if Ms. Fox would like to have a drink with me tonight?"

Juniper licked her lips, eyeing the handsome doctor. "I'd love to, and perhaps you could give me a check-up too."

###chapter 185 Mysterious Medicine

Meanwhile, Isabella had returned home. Since her plans for the day had progressed significantly, she decided to cook a lavish dinner.

While busy in the kitchen, Isabella received a message from Juniper. Learning that Jasper and Mia had been taken to the police station, she smiled with satisfaction.

"Next, we'll see if the private detective can uncover any more evidence against my parents," Isabella said with a smile, putting her phone away and continuing to cook.

At that moment, Michael suddenly came home.

"Why are you back so early? Shouldn't you be at work?" Isabella asked with a smile.

Michael smiled awkwardly and said, "Didn't you say you were inviting friends over to celebrate? So I took the day off to come home early and prepare."

Michael walked into the kitchen and hugged Isabella from behind, but his eyes were scanning the living room.

"Honey, did you happen to pick up any packages or did anyone come by to deliver something?" Michael asked cautiously.

Isabella shook her head in confusion. "No, no one has come by since I got home. Did you order something online?"

"Well, just some ordinary crafts," Michael replied, his smile a bit strained.

In fact, he had planned to come home later for the celebration, but he suddenly remembered something important. Because he had been pushing himself too hard in bed, he was feeling weak and had asked Benjamin to find a doctor from Emberlyn for him.

Michael had secretly visited the doctor's clinic, where he was prescribed some medicine. Today was the day the medicine would be ready.

Since it was a private matter, Michael hadn't even told Jerry. When the clinic called to ask where to deliver the medicine, he instinctively gave his home address.

By the time Michael realized his mistake, he quickly called the clinic, only to be told that the medicine was already on its way. Worse still, the delivery person's phone was unreachable.

Michael felt a surge of panic. He couldn't bear to think how Isabella would react if she found out he had ordered those medicines.

To save face, he came home early, but it seemed he had arrived too soon.

'What is that damn guy doing? Why hasn't he delivered the medicine yet? My sudden return will make Isabella suspicious,' Michael thought angrily.

Just then, Isabella, who was preparing ingredients, turned around and looked at Michael with a serious expression, making him feel nervous.

"What's wrong, darling? Aren't you preparing the ingredients?" Michael asked with a forced smile.

Isabella looked Michael up and down suspiciously, feeling that something was off with him today.

"Are you hiding something from me? You seem very nervous," Isabella asked, her suspicion growing.

"How could that be? I'll never hide anything from you," Michael said, hugging Isabella's waist and kissing her on the lips.

Despite his affectionate gesture, Isabella's suspicion remained.

"No, something is definitely off. Let me guess, does this have anything to do with the package you mentioned earlier?" Isabella speculated.

'She's so smart! That's my wife! But how can I tell her about this? It's too embarrassing,' Michael thought, shaking his head seriously.

"No, it has nothing to do with any package," Michael said earnestly.

At that moment, there was a knock on the door.

A man outside called out, "Is this Williams' residence? Your medicine has arrived!"

"Medicine? Why did you buy medicine?" Isabella asked, puzzled, as she left the kitchen to open the door.

A young man stood outside, looking at Isabella with confusion. "Is this Mr. Williams' residence?"

"I'm his wife. What kind of medicine is this?" Isabella asked, taking the bag from the young man.

The young man was about to answer when he felt a chill. He saw Michael standing behind Isabella, glaring at him.

The young man laughed nervously and said, "It'll help you beat fatigue, get more energy, boost your immune system, and even slow down aging. I'm outta here."

With that, the young man quickly turned and ran, desperate to escape immense pressure from Michael.

"Slowing aging and boosting immunity? Darling, did you buy it for me? Do you think I'm aging too fast?" Isabella asked, glaring at Michael.

Michael rolled his eyes, grabbed the bag from Isabella, and opened the still-warm medicine pack, drinking it all in one go.

"My God, this is more bitter than coffee. It's for me, not you," Michael said.

Isabella tilted her head in confusion, looking at Michael. "You think you're getting old? But you're only a few years older than me."

Just then, Michael's phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID and hesitated to answer, which only made Isabella more suspicious.

"It's just a phone call. Why are you afraid to answer? I'm curious to know who's calling you," Isabella said calmly, a smile playing on her lips.

Michael had no choice but to answer the call in front of her.

A slightly elderly voice came through the phone. "Mr. Williams, I forgot to mention earlier that the medication you purchased is just for the first course. Finish it and see how it works. If you and your wife are still not satisfied with your sex life, we can try the second course."

"Alright, I understand," Michael said, hanging up with a scowl on his face.

Isabella's face turned bright red. She now understood what the medicine was for.

###chapter 186 What Are You Guys Doing?

The doctor's call left Isabella and Michael in silence.

Blushing, Isabella hesitated for a moment before taking the bag of medicine from Michael's hand.

"I'll put this in the fridge for you," she said, heading to the kitchen.

Michael stood still, his face dark with frustration.

After placing the medicine in the fridge and closing the door, Isabella couldn't help but burst into laughter, clutching her stomach.

"Is it funny?" Michael's voice, cold and stern, came from behind her.

Isabella stifled her laughter and stood up. "No, not at all. Just remembered something good. Oh, and guess what? I won my case against my parents!"

Isabella started laughing again, this time patting Michael's chest, tears streaming down her face. "I'm sorry. I can't help it. If you're feeling tired, you can tell me. I'll give you a break for a couple of days."

Michael's face flushed red, embarrassment and anger warring within him.

"I'm just fine. This is just regular upkeep for a man!" Michael said seriously, gripping Isabella's shoulders.

Isabella nodded earnestly. "You're right. Don't give me that look. Sorry, but... I still think it's hilarious!"

Seeing Michael's embarrassed and guilty expression, Isabella couldn't hold back her laughter.

"It looks like I need to prove myself," Michael said angrily, lifting Isabella and carrying her towards the bedroom.

"Hold on! I'm not done chopping veggies yet!" Isabella said, gesturing towards the kitchen.

But Michael firmly pulled her arm back. "We have more important things to do right now. I need to prove to you that I don't need rest!"

Michael threw Isabella onto the bed and began undressing her. Isabella clung tightly to her clothes.

"Okay, okay, no more laughing! Amelia and Benjamin might be here any minute, so I need to get these ingredients prepped," Isabella said, but her lips kept twitching, showing she was still holding back laughter.

Michael didn't believe her and pulled her hands away, stripping off her clothes.

Isabella sighed helplessly. Michael clearly had a big ego in some areas.

Soon, Isabella was left in just her underwear, her graceful body exposed to Michael.

Michael's anger quickly turned into desire. His hands roamed over Isabella's body, and she gradually adapted to his rhythm, starting to enjoy it. Her breathing became heavy, and her skin flushed.

Michael's hands moved to her back, unfastening her bra, revealing her full breasts.

Just then, Isabella's phone rang. It was Amelia calling.

"Don't say anything." Isabella gestured for silence and answered the call.

"Isabella, congratulations! You finally got rid of your annoying parents. They can't hold anything over you anymore!" Amelia's voice was filled with excitement, genuinely happy for Isabella.

"Thanks for your concern. How about coming over tonight for a barbecue to celebrate? And bring Benjamin along," Isabella said into the phone.

"Sure, I think he'll be happy to hear the news too..." Amelia's words were cut off by Isabella's sudden scream.

"What happened? Isabella, are you in danger?" Amelia asked nervously.

Isabella glared at Michael, her face flushed. He had bitten her nipple and misjudged the force, causing her pain.

"No, I was cooking and accidentally burned myself on the pot lid," Isabella quickly explained, her face red.

"Really? You're not lying to me, are you?" Amelia was still suspicious, thinking Isabella might be in danger.

"No, I'm telling the truth. Michael is right here with me. You can ask him if you don't believe me," Isabella said, handing the phone to Michael, her face still red.

Michael's hands were still fondling Isabella's breasts as he lifted his head and responded, "Good afternoon, Amelia."

Hearing Michael's voice, Amelia relaxed. "You scared me! I thought you were really in danger."

"Don't worry about me. My husband will protect me," Isabella said, blushing as she looked at Michael.

Michael smiled and slid Isabella's panties off, leaving her completely naked.

Isabella shot Michael a glare, but he ignored her look, lifting her legs and revealing his erection.

"What are you planning to cook for us? I'm not really in the mood for barbecue. Can you make something else?" Amelia asked playfully over the phone.

Isabella bit her lip, trying to suppress the tingling sensation in her lower body. "Of course, you can have whatever you want tonight."

"Awesome! Do you need me to grab anything from the store? Oh, and do you have any seafood? I'm craving a seafood feast," Amelia said, already listing her cravings.

Isabella's face turned crimson. Michael was teasing her, rubbing his erection against her entrance without actually entering, causing an intense, ticklish sensation. Her vagina was responding by secreting fluids profusely.

"Isabella, are you feeling okay? You sound like you're out of breath," Amelia asked, sensing something off. Isabella's voice sounded strange.

Isabella whacked Michael on the back in frustration, but he didn't stop, continuing to rub against her labia.

"It's just the steam from the boiling water; it's making it hard to breathe. I'll open the window," Isabella lied again.

"Shouldn't you turn on the exhaust fan? Why open the window?" Amelia's suspicion grew.

At that moment, Isabella let out another scream.

This time, it was because Michael suddenly thrust his erection into her. The unexpected move caught Isabella off guard, making her cry out.

###chapter 187 The Mysterious Ring

The itching in Isabella's vagina was finally relieved, and the intense pleasure was overwhelming her. She felt she was about to scream, so she quickly hung up the phone.

On the other end, Amelia stared at the disconnected call for a few seconds, seemingly understanding what had just happened.

"Her husband is with her, she's panting, and she keeps making those strange noises. That damn woman is either being abused or having sex! And she answered my call in the middle of it!" Amelia's face turned bright red.

Amelia decided to tease Isabella about this when went to Isabella's for dinner that evening.

Meanwhile, at the Williams Villa, Mason sat wearily on the sofa, rubbing his temples. It had been a long time since he had been in front of the camera, and it was taking its toll on him.

Charles came over and asked with concern, "Mr. Williams, do you need to rest in your room?"

Mason shook his head. "No rush. How is John? Is he still looking for Bianca?"

Charles hesitated for a moment and then nodded. "Should we inform..."

Before Charles could finish, Mason waved him off. He knew Charles intended to have John's father, Owen, discipline his son, but Mason didn't want that. 

"If Owen could deal with John, we wouldn't have Bianca causing trouble. Let him continue his work abroad; don't call him back," Mason said, standing up from the sofa with the help of his cane.

"I'm a bit hungry. I'll rest in my room for a while. Bring my meal to my room when it's ready," Mason instructed Charles before heading to his room.

He slumped into his old rocking chair, gently rocking back and forth with his eyes shut. Then, his eyes snapped open, a sudden look of understanding in their aged depths.

"Could this be Isabella's plan?" Mason immediately got up from the rocking chair, walked to his desk, opened a drawer, and pressed a hidden button inside.

Soon, a section of the wall beside the desk began to descend, revealing a secret compartment with a safe.

Mason walked over to the safe, entered the code, and opened it, taking out a bronze ring engraved with strange patterns.

"It seems Isabella is ready to take over the Taylor Family. I hope this ring can help her." Mason smiled and put the ring in his pocket.

When Charles came in to deliver the meal, Mason handed the ring to him.

"Isabella should be going to work tomorrow. Go to her office and give her this ring! Make sure to hand it to her personally and don't let anyone else see it," Mason said seriously.

Seeing Mason's serious expression, Charles knew this matter was very important. He took the ring with both hands and nodded earnestly. "Rest assured, I will deliver it to Isabella safely."

After Charles left, Mason's face broke into a smile.

Meanwhile, Isabella emerged from the bedroom, dressed in pajamas with her messy hair tied back with a hairband.

Isabella walked lightly to the kitchen, ready to start preparing lunch.

Shortly after Isabella left the bedroom, the door opened, and Michael slowly walked out, holding his waist.

'Damn it, I couldn't hold back. That bag of medicine was wasted,' Michael cursed himself inwardly for his recklessness and stupidity. The doctor had warned him to avoid sexual activity until he finished the medication, or at most, limit it to once a week to conserve his energy. 

"This week is over. I'll worry about it next week," Michael muttered under his breath as he walked out of the room with his phone.

Meanwhile, on the Aurora Continent, Scarlett was idly scrolling through her phone when a notification popped up, surprising her. It was an entertainment news update, a topic Scarlett typically paid little attention to. Just as she was about to dismiss the notification, she caught sight of a reference to the spouse of a corporate executive.

Scarlett knew the boss was Michael. She initially thought the news was about Isabella, but when she opened it, she found it was about another woman named Estella.

"What's going on? Did Michael get divorced? No, he wouldn't be interested in a woman like Estella. What's really happening here?" Scarlett muttered, extremely puzzled.

Soon, a cold smile appeared on her lips. No matter what, with Michael in the mix, she was ready to stir up trouble for him.

Scarlett immediately sent the news to Michael's father, Kenna.

Kenna, who was having tea in the yard, received the message and sprang up from his chair.

"Damn it, what's going on?" Kenna said, then angrily dialed Michael's number.

Michael, who was in the yard, was about to call Kenna when he suddenly received Kenna's call.

Michael was a bit surprised but answered the call.

As soon as the call connected, Kenna's angry voice came through. "You damn jerk, isn't your wife named Isabella? Who the hell is Estella? When did you get divorced?"

Michael raised an eyebrow but wasn't too surprised. He had known Kenna would eventually see the news.

"The news is fake. Estella is just a decoy to protect Isabella. Her identity shouldn't be revealed right now," Michael explained over the phone.

"What do you mean by that? Is Isabella's identity so special?" Kenna asked, confused by Michael's actions.

Michael sighed and finally revealed the truth, including Isabella's true identity and the fact that she was unaware of his identity.

Kenna was shocked for a few minutes before he could react.

"So you stole your nephew's wife? How do you think Mason's going to react to this?" Kenna roared.

Michael rubbed his ear, speaking casually, "Don't yell at me. Isabella and I are truly in love. It's our marriage, our choice; nobody gets to tell us what to do."

###chapter 188 We Truly Love Each Other

After hearing Michael's words, Kenna fell silent again.

"That explains why Isabella seemed so familiar. Mason married her off to his grandson to fulfill his old regret," Kenna sighed deeply.

Michael raised an eyebrow. The reason he had called Kenna was to find out why Mason treated Isabella so well.

But to Michael's frustration, Kenna fell silent after that statement.

"Dad, do you know how frustrating it is when you start a story and then stop halfway? Please, continue. I really want to know why Mason treats Isabella so well. Don't tell me it's because he had a good relationship with Isabella's granddad. I won't believe that! Isabella has sisters, and Mason's never treated them nearly as well as he treats her," Michael said, eager to hear the truth from Kenna.

Kenna was silent for a while before slowly saying, "This has to do with Isabella's grandmother and my decision to leave Avalonia for Aurora Continent to start my business. There are some... personal matters involved. You should ask Mason directly."

Kenna clearly didn't want to say more about the specifics.

"Dad, I hate it when you only tell half the story. Can you tell me the real reason? Don't make me investigate further. It's a waste of energy," Michael said, dissatisfied.

Kenna sneered, "Didn't you say you and Isabella are truly in love and no one can control you? If you want to know the truth, go ask Mason directly. Why are you asking me? And watch your tone. I'm your dad, not your subordinate. Don't force me to fly over and give you what for!"

With that, Kenna hung up, leaving Michael stunned.

"Oh, my, what a mystery! Between a man and a woman? It's always just about the feelings, isn't it? Why are you so hung up on this at your age? Are you worried we'll make fun of you?" Michael scoffed, putting his phone away.

"Who are you talking to?" Isabella's voice came from behind Michael.

Michael turned to find Isabella looking at him with a puzzled expression.

"I was just on the phone with my dad. He was urging us to have a baby quickly! He said he's getting old and is afraid he won't live to see the day." Michael shrugged.

Isabella blushed. Talking about having babies always made her think about sex.

"Then what did you mean by making fun of him?" Isabella asked.

Michael suddenly hugged Isabella, a mischievous smile on his face. "I told him that if he wants a baby so bad, he should go find himself a wife. I promise not to make fun of him."

Isabella rolled her eyes at Michael's teasing of his father.

"He's your father. Can't you show him some respect?" Isabella lightly slapped Michael's chest.

Michael grabbed her hand, gently stroking it. "That's just how my father and I get along. By the way, is dinner ready?"

Isabella nodded. "Yes, it is ready. I was just coming to call you."

"Great, I burned a lot of energy earlier. I'm starving," Michael said happily, running into the villa.

Isabella stood behind him, sighing as she touched her stomach. "We've been trying so hard. Why isn't there any news yet?"

In the evening, Amelia and Benjamin arrived at Isabella's house as planned. They had dinner together to celebrate their recent success.

During dinner, Amelia kept bringing up topics like phone calls and having babies, clearly teasing Isabella. Isabella knew Amelia was doing it on purpose, so she blushed and glared at her.

After dinner, Amelia helped Isabella clean up. While tidying, Amelia opened the fridge and was surprised to see the packages of medicine inside.

"Isabella, are these all medicines? Who needs to take these, you or Michael?" Amelia asked curiously.

Michael, who was chatting with Benjamin on the sofa, suddenly turned pale. Benjamin noticed his expression and instantly knew what was going on.

Isabella blinked. She didn't want to embarrass Michael in front of everyone, so she smiled and said, "These are vitamin packets we both take."

Michael gave Isabella a grateful look, while Benjamin looked at him teasingly.

Amelia, holding the bag of medicine, asked curiously, "How effective is this medicine? Can Benjamin and I take it too?"

Isabella's eyes widened, and she shook her head vigorously. "No, different medicines have different effects on different people. If you want to take something like this, you should see a doctor to get a custom prescription."

"Exactly, dear. These medicines are custom-made. If anyone else takes them, they could end up with some serious side effects - smaller breasts, acne, or even hemorrhoids," Benjamin warned gravely, hoping to dissuade Amelia from wanting to try the medication.

Benjamin knew exactly what this medicine was and had no intention of taking it himself. He was confident he didn't need it!

Hearing Benjamin and Isabella's warnings, Amelia gave up on the idea of taking the medicine.

"Alright, let me know if it works for you, and give me the doctor's contact information," Amelia said, continuing to help Isabella with the dishes.

Isabella let out a sigh of relief and gave Michael a light glare.

Michael shrugged and pulled Benjamin back to the sofa.

Benjamin leaned in and whispered to Michael, "So, does that medicine really work?"

###chapter 189 Does that Medicine Really Work?

Michael didn't want to dwell on the topic.

"I just took one, so nothing yet. Ask me again in a few days," With that, Michael turned on the TV.

Benjamin understood that Michael wanted to change the subject, so he shrugged and started talking about something else.

A few hours later, Benjamin and Amelia left Michael's villa.

After Michael and Isabella took a bath, they lay in bed. This time, they simply hugged each other to sleep without engaging in any sexual activity. Michael believed he had enough self-control.

The next day, Leo drove Isabella to work.

As Isabella arrived at the company building and was about to enter, she saw a familiar face.

"Charles, what are you doing here?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

Charles smiled and replied, "I'm here to deliver something to you on behalf of Mr. Williams. Since we didn't know where you live, we had to come to the company to find you."

"What did Mason ask you to deliver?" Isabella asked curiously.

Charles pointed to a car. "Isabella, Mr. Williams said nobody else should see this. Let's go to the car."

Isabella nodded and followed Charles to the black car. She trusted that Charles wouldn't harm her.

Meanwhile, Leo didn't go far. When he saw Isabella get into Charles' car, he immediately called Michael to inform him.

Michael frowned upon receiving the call.

"I understand. Don't worry about it; just head to the parking lot," Michael instructed Leo before hanging up.

'Could Mason have figured something out? Why did he send Charles over?' Michael pondered, his brow furrowed.

Meanwhile, inside the car, Charles handed Isabella a small box.

"Isabella, this is what Mr. Williams wanted me to give you," Charles said with a smile.

Isabella opened the small box to find a bronze ring inside. It looked mysterious, like an antique.

"Charles, what's this ring for?" Isabella asked, puzzled by Mason's intentions.

'Is Mason planning to propose to me on behalf of John?' Isabella thought but quickly dismissed it as too far-fetched.

Charles looked at Isabella seriously and said, "Isabella, Mr. Williams didn't give many details. He only asked me to tell you that this ring can help you regain control of the Taylor family."

Isabella's expression changed instantly. She didn't understand how this ring could help her regain control of the Taylor family, but she knew Mason had already guessed what she was planning to do next.

'It seems Charles is clueless about the ring. Guess I'll have to ask Mason myself,' Isabella thought.

"Charles, please tell Mason that I'll visit him in a few days," Isabella said with a smile, carefully putting the ring away before getting out of the car.

When Isabella re-entered the company, she was greeted with confetti and cheers.

Her colleagues in the design department were celebrating her victory in a lawsuit.

Faced with their enthusiasm, Isabella smiled politely and greeted each one.

However, Madeline and Odette were not among those enthusiastic colleagues.

"What's so proud about cutting ties with her biological parents? I guess I get it, though - not everyone gets betrayed by their own parents like that," Odette sneered, crossing her arms.

Isabella acted as if she didn't see Odette and Madeline, walking straight past them towards her office.

"This is so infuriating! She just ignored us. Ms. Eve, she doesn't respect us at all," Odette said angrily to Madeline, pointing at Isabella's back.

Madeline gave Isabella's back a cold glance and shook her head. "Ignore her. Let's just focus on our own work."

When Isabella reached her office, she received congratulations from Juliet.

"Ms. Taylor, congratulations! You've finally got rid of your awful parents. You know, when I heard the evidence you presented, I was furious. I couldn't believe there were parents like that in the world!" Juliet said, waving her hands in anger.

Isabella smiled and shook her head. "Easy now, there's no need to get worked up about this."

Just as Isabella was about to sit down, Juliet remembered something.

"Oh, Ms. Taylor, Mr. Larson wants to see you. He asked me to tell you to go to his office when you arrive," Juliet said.

"Mr. Larson wants to see me? I wonder what it's about," Isabella said, puzzled. If it were an urgent work matter, Dwayne would have called her directly. Since he asked Juliet to relay the message, it probably wasn't serious.

"Got it. I'll go see him," Isabella said with a smile, heading to Dwayne's office.

Dwayne was reading a document in his office. When he heard a knock, he told the person to come in and saw it was Isabella.

"Mr. Larson, you wanted to see me?" Isabella asked with a smile.

Dwayne placed a document in front of Isabella. "First, congratulations on winning the lawsuit. Second, there's a design competition coming up. Do you have any interest in participating?"

Isabella picked up the document and read it. It was a design competition organized by several of the world's top cosmetics companies.

The winner would receive high-end cosmetics from each participating company.

The real purpose of the competition was to showcase new products to the public, much like an auto show.

Although everyone knew what it was about, designers were more focused on the rankings. Winning would bring significant recognition in the industry.

After reading the document, Isabella smiled and placed it back on the table. "Sorry, Mr. Larson, but I don't plan to participate in this design competition."

###chapter 190 Who Sent Her Flowers?

Dwayne looked at Isabella with confusion, not understanding why she would give up on the competition.

Isabella's next words shocked him even more.

"Mr. Larson, I've decided to resign. I was planning to tell you later, but I think it's best to let you know now," Isabella said with a smile.

Dwayne stood up from his chair in shock. "What did you say? You're resigning? Why?"

Isabella was puzzled; she didn't understand why her resignation would surprise him so much.

Dwayne reacted so strongly because Isabella was their boss Michael's favorite, and he feared being blamed for her resignation.

"Isabella, may I ask why you're resigning? Did Madeline upset you? If she's not cooperating with your work, we can transfer her to another department or even fire her," Dwayne said seriously.

Isabella was shocked by his words.

Madeline's talent was highly sought after in the design industry, but Dwayne was actually willing to fire Madeline for her!

Isabella was confused. Did she really have that much influence?

Although she had had conflicts with Madeline, she had always maintained a delicate balance and never thought of firing her.

Isabella put up with Madeline to repay her boss, who'd helped her out several times.

Isabella wanted Madeline to stay in the company. She didn't want to lose her to a competitor.

Though Isabella didn't understand why Dwayne would do this, she decided to give a reason for her resignation.

"Mr. Larson, this has nothing to do with Madeline. I'm resigning because I plan to start my own business," Isabella said with a smile.

"Are you considering starting your own studio? Well, you could maintain an affiliation with the company and utilize our resources." Dwayne suggested. 

However, Isabella shook her head. "No, Mr. Larson, I'm not opening a studio. I'm going back to take over the three remaining companies of my family."

Dwayne was even more surprised. He knew Isabella's background, but he remembered that those three companies were nearly bankrupt. Were they worth saving?

"I understand you want to revive your family, but have you considered how difficult it is?" Dwayne earnestly advised Isabella, hoping she would reconsider.

But Isabella shook her head firmly. "I've thought it through, Mr. Larson. Also, I'd like to take the afternoon off to visit my parents in the detention center."

Dwayne looked at Isabella's determined expression and sighed helplessly, sitting back in his chair.

"You're incredibly talented; I'll really miss you. But since you've made up your mind, I can't force you. I wish you all the best in the future," Dwayne said with a bitter smile.

Isabella smiled. "Mr. Larson, I'll still be here for a while to handle the handover. Why do you sound like I'm leaving right now?"

They shared a lighthearted moment, chatting briefly before Isabella left the office.

When Dwayne was alone in his office, he scratched his head in frustration.

"Damn it, how am I going to explain this to Mr. Williams?" Dwayne took out his phone but hesitated for a long time, unable to dial Michael's number.

He lit a cigarette, and as the smoke swirled around him, he finally gathered the courage to call Michael after finishing it.

The phone rang twice before it was answered.

Dwayne took a deep breath and said, "Mr. Williams, Isabella is resigning to take over her family's businesses. I've tried to change her mind, but she's determined to revive the family companies. What should we do?"

Dwayne explained the situation in detail, hoping Michael wouldn't blame him for it.

To Dwayne's surprise, Michael's reaction was very calm.

"I'm aware. Isabella's leaving, whether we agree or not. When she submits her resignation, hold onto it and don't forward it to HR. Let's leave the door open for her to come back if things don't work out," Michael said before hanging up.

Dwayne stared at the ended call screen, stunned for a long time.

"How ridiculous? I've never heard of an employee being able to come back after resigning," Dwayne muttered, then began to wonder why Michael was so good to Isabella.

'Strange. Isabella's broken things off with his nephew, yet he's still so kind. Is it really family care? And they're the same age... ' Dwayne's thoughts trailed off as a terrifying possibility crossed his mind.

'Could Isabella's mysterious husband actually be Mr. Williams?' Dwayne felt his heart pounding. He knew it was just a wild guess with no evidence, so he buried the thought deep in his mind, vowing never to tell anyone. Otherwise, if Michael found out, he wouldn't go easy on him either way. 

Meanwhile, Isabella, after leaving Dwayne's office, intended to return to her own office.

As she passed through the office area, a security guard came over holding a bouquet of flowers.

"Isabella, a man outside asked me to give you these flowers," the guard said, handing the bouquet to Isabella.

Her colleagues looked curiously at the flowers, wondering who sent them.

Isabella's expression turned cold. "Did John send these? If so, return them to him."

But the guard shook his head. "No. The sender said his name is Joseph."

###chapter 191 A Bug That Flew into My Eye

Isabella was visibly taken aback when she heard that the flowers were from Joseph. Her colleagues also felt the name sounded familiar but couldn't quite place it.

"Joseph? Why is he sending me flowers?" Isabella frowned.

The security guard shrugged and pointed downstairs. "I don't know. Maybe you can ask him in person, he's still downstairs."

"I'll go see him now." Holding the flowers, Isabella headed downstairs. As soon as she stepped outside, she saw Joseph.

Joseph was leaning against a white sports car, dressed in a teal casual outfit, with a fresh smile on his face, looking radiant.

"You said you'd call after court, but it's been days and I haven't heard from you. So, I decided to come find you," Joseph said with a smile as soon as he saw Isabella.

Isabella had planned to ask Joseph about the flowers, but his words left her momentarily speechless.

"I'm really sorry, I've been so busy that I forgot about it. Thank you for your help last time," Isabella said with a smile.

Joseph waved his hand dismissively. "Never mind, I was just joking. Consider the flowers a congrats on your win. How about dinner tonight?"

Isabella thought for a moment and then shook her head. "I'm sorry, Mr. Davis, my husband has already prepared dinner for tonight. I'll have to take a rain check on your invitation."

Joseph raised an eyebrow in surprise. Few people ever turned him down, which piqued his curiosity about Isabella's husband.

"Could you tell me your husband's name? I'm curious about who could be more charming than me," Joseph asked with a smile.

Isabella shook her head without hesitation. "Sorry, I don't want to disclose his information for now. I'm afraid the media will disrupt his life."

Isabella was very aware of the nature of the four top families. If she revealed anything about Michael to Joseph today, he might leak it, and soon all the four families would know.

Joseph looked a bit disappointed. "Oh, come on, you really can't have dinner with me? We haven't seen each other in nearly 20 years."

Isabella shook her head again. "Forget dinner. My parents have turned themselves in, and that's just the beginning. I'll be way too busy."

"Alright, looks like there's no chance then. Your husband really keeps a tight rein on you," Joseph said with a hint of regret in his voice.

Isabella laughed and shook her head. "He trusts me completely. It's just inappropriate to get close to other men while I'm married. I don't want any misunderstanding."

"Wow, you're really loyal to your love," Joseph sighed.

Isabella thought for a moment, then joked, "I'm probably being followed by the press already. Having dinner with me would put you right in the middle of it. You wouldn't want that kind of attention, would you?"

Joseph laughed as if he had heard a joke. "Do you think people like us are afraid of the press? Those gossip hounds are insane, always wanting to make up stories about me. They'll spread rumors no matter what. If I get close to any girl, they'll gossip. If I don't, they'll say I'm gay."

Isabella was amused by his words, laughing so hard she almost doubled over. "You're hilarious! But seriously, I don't want any drama with you. It always happens-I get close to a guy, and some woman starts targeting me. So annoying!"

Joseph found Isabella's words intriguing.

"So, your husband's got a jealous ex or something? Seems like you have rivals wherever you go," Joseph joked.

Isabella thought about Scarlett-that troublemaker from Aurora Continent. She wondered if Scarlett was still ticked off and if she'd heard about what Isabella's been up to.

Isabella shook her head, pushing thoughts of Scarlett aside. Scarlett was no longer a threat; there was no need to worry about her.

Seeing Isabella shake her head, Joseph assumed she didn't want to talk about it and didn't press further.

"Since there's no chance for dinner, I guess I'll head back..." Joseph was about to leave when he suddenly noticed a small black speck flying towards his eye and then into it.

"Damn, my eye itches," Joseph said, grimacing as he covered his eye.

"What's wrong? Do you need to go to the hospital?" Isabella asked, grabbing his arm with concern.

Joseph shook his head. "No need, probably just a bug that flew into my eye. I can rub it out."

Joseph scrubbed at his eye, tears welling up, but that darn bug wouldn't come out. It was driving him crazy.

"Hold still. let me check your eye for the bug and blow it out," Isabella said, holding Joseph's head and gently pulling his eyelid to look for the bug.

Soon, she found the bug. It had died from Joseph's rubbing and was stuck to his lower eyelid.

"Don't move. I found the bug. I'll blow it out now," Isabella said before starting to blow gently.

Joseph stayed still, feeling the warmth of her fingers and the breeze from her breath.

Unbeknownst to them, a group of people were secretly taking photos of them with their phones.

From the angle behind Isabella, her head completely blocked Joseph's face, making it look like they were kissing.

###chapter 192 Colleagues' Gossip

Behind Isabella, a group of colleagues excitedly held up their phones, capturing the moment. Everyone's face was lit with excitement.

"I finally remember, he's Joseph Davis!"

"They look so close! Who was the idiot that said Ms. Taylor's husband was a driver? She is so beautiful and talented; how could her husband be just an ordinary driver?"

"The idiot you're talking about is probably John! He said Ms. Taylor's husband was a driver last time he was here."

"Alright, forget what I just said. But now it looks like Ms. Taylor's husband is Joseph!"

"Both of them are from wealthy families! Oh my God, I'm so jealous of Ms. Taylor. Two rich guys? Ugh, I wish that were me! Who would I pick?"

The colleagues hid behind doors and windows, chatting non-stop. Among them were Madeline and Odette.

Madeline coldly glanced at the girl daydreaming. This girl was actually fantasizing about being pursued by both John and Joseph. How ridiculous! What was she thinking? Had she ever taken a good look at herself in the mirror?

'Madeline watched Isabella's retreating back, her eyes blazing with resentment. "It's all luck," she seethed. "Born into privilege. You have no talent to justify your superiority. These marriages are all about alliances, not love!' Madeline thought, staring at Isabella's back, her eyes burning with jealousy.

Odette's eyes also burned with jealousy. "That two-faced bitch already has Joseph. What's she still hanging on to John for?"

"Are you sure it's Ms. Taylor who's been chasing after John? Isn't it the other way around?" Juliet shot Odette a disgusted look.

"You bitch, what gives you the right to talk to me?" Odette, furious, raised her hand to teach Juliet a lesson.

However, just as Odette raised her hand, Madeline grabbed it.

"The last person who fought in the company was transferred to Evernia. Do you want to go there too?" Madeline glared at Odette angrily.

Odette remembered the tragic fate of Madeline's previous assistant and fearfully retracted her hand.

After scolding Odette, Madeline turned to Juliet.

"Looks like Isabella hasn't taught you any manners. If you've got nothing better to do, I'll find something to keep you busy," Madeline said coldly.

Juliet swallowed nervously, looking at Madeline, but soon she raised her head and bravely met Madeline's gaze.

"I'm sorry, Ms. Eve, but Ms. Taylor told me to only follow her orders and no one else's. So, you have no authority over me," Juliet said courageously.

"You bitch, how dare you disrespect Ms. Eve? Have you forgotten your place?" Odette pointed at Juliet angrily.

Juliet glared at Odette. "Have you forgotten your place? We're both assistants. You're the assistant to the deputy director, and I'm the assistant to the director. I think my position should be higher than yours. What gives you the right to talk to me like that?"

"I can't stand this anymore. Just you wait. I'm gonna teach you a lesson after work," Odette said menacingly.

"What's going on? Are you threatening her?" Isabella's voice rang out behind them.

Juliet, seeing Isabella, excitedly called out, "Ms. Taylor, you're back. These two were badmouthing you behind your back."

Odette didn't expect Isabella to return so quickly, and Joseph was already gone.

Odette jumped out and questioned, "Isabella, since you already have Joseph, why are you hanging on to John?"

Isabella coldly glanced at Odette. "If you can't see straight, I know a good eye doctor. When have I ever shown any interest in John? Isn't he the one always bugging me? I've told him a million times I'm married and to leave me alone. But he won't take a hint. Maybe I should get a dog leash and tie him up."

Odette's face turned red with anger after being scolded by Isabella.

"Ms. Taylor, don't be too smug. We know exactly how you beat Ms. Eve last time!" Odette said with a mocking smile, her eyes filled with disdain.

Isabella was a bit taken aback. Could it be that Odette already knew Kevin was always following his wife's opinions?

But who cares if Madeline and Odette knew? Isabella earned Kevin and Gabrielle's praise with her own skills. She won fair and square. So why was Odette strutting around with that smug look on her face?

Before Odette could even finish hinting at something inappropriate between Isabella and Kevin, Madeline gave her a sharp kick under the table and shot her a furious look.

There was no evidence of any improper dealings between Isabella and Kevin. If they spoke out now, Isabella might sue them for defamation. Madeline had already lost one assistant; she didn't want Odette, her new assistant, to be transferred to Evernia or fired. That would be a huge humiliation for her!

"Isabella, you should manage your assistant better. She's a bit rude," Madeline said coldly, glancing at Juliet.

To steer Isabella away from Odette's suggestive comment, Madeline swiftly changed the subject to Juliet.

Juliet was angry. Why was Madeline always targeting her, a mere assistant?

Juliet looked at Isabella, hoping she would stand up for her. Isabella's words, however, left Juliet stunned.

"Juliet, let me ask you something. If a dog bites you, would you bite it back?" Isabella asked with a smile.

Juliet shook her head in confusion. "Of course not. I'm not a dog. How could I bite a dog?"

Isabella's smile widened. "Exactly. So next time, if a dog bites you, remember to defend yourself with something like a stick."

###chapter 193 Misunderstanding

Isabella's words stunned everyone for a moment, but soon they realized she was targeting Madeline and Odette.

Juliet just pondered for a moment and understood what Isabella meant.

"I got it, Ms. Taylor. I won't bite the dog in the future." Juliet glanced at Odette when she mentioned the word 'dog'.

Odette's face flushed with anger. She turned to Isabella, her voice rising, "Are you calling me a dog? How dare you say that? I'm reporting this to Mr. Larson!"

Isabella sighed, somewhat annoyed. "Keep your voice down, Odette. Why are you shouting so loud? You're practically spraying me with spittle! Did I actually call you a dog? I was just telling my assistant about a stray dog I saw on the way back to the office.  What's that to you? Of course, if you want to think of yourself as a cute little puppy, I have no objection. It's your choice after all."

Isabella's sarcastic words stabbed into Odette's heart like a knife and kept twisting back and forth.

"Enough. Odette, let's go." Madeline quickly pulled Odette away, afraid that if they stayed longer, Odette would attack Isabella, and then Isabella would find a reason to fire Odette.

After Madeline and Odette left, Juliet approached Isabella, smiling, "Ms. Taylor, you are really amazing. I've never felt so good! It was so satisfying watching you get rid of them."

However, Isabella shook her head very seriously. "Let me make it clear, I never meant to insult my colleagues. I was just chatting with them, but obviously my words may have made them uncomfortable. That's their problem, not mine."

Juliet nodded repeatedly. "Yes, it has nothing to do with you."

After Juliet finished speaking, she leaned in conspiratorially and whispered, "Ms. Taylor, is Mr. Davis really your husband?" Curiosity shone in her eyes.

Isabella frowned slightly and denied directly, "Joseph is my childhood friend, not my husband. You've all got the wrong idea. There's nothing going on between us."

"Then why did you kiss him?" Juliet looked at Isabella with confusion.

Isabella hesitated for a moment, frowning at Juliet. "Kiss him? When did that even happen? We just talked briefly by the door, and now the whole company's buzzing with this gossip? It's spreading like wildfire!"

"It's not a rumor; we saw it with our own eyes." Juliet shook her head, then showed Isabella the photos they had just taken.

Seeing the photo, Isabella felt a wave of helplessness wash over her. Taken from behind, it did look like she was kissing Joseph, but it was all a trick of the angle-a completely misleading perspective.

"You've got it all wrong," Isabella explained. "He had something in his eye, and I was just helping him get it out. The photo's just a bad angle," she added, suddenly realizing how many similar pictures might exist. She didn't care about them being online, but she wondered what Michael would think.

"Damn it, looks like I have to trouble Mr. Larson." Isabella sighed, patted her forehead, and headed to Dwayne's office.

Dwayne felt a bit helpless when he understood Isabella's request.

"So, you want me to send a message in the company chat group for such a small matter, informing all departments?" Dwayne asked, somewhat exasperated.

"Mr. Larson, this is serious," Isabella said, her voice firm. "That photo's all wrong, and it could easily cause problems with Joseph. I just got through a huge media mess, and I really don't want another one. And if my husband saw it, he'd be upset and hurt."

After hearing Isabella's explanation, Dwayne sighed and nodded. "Alright, I'll tell the whole company to stop spreading the rumor."

"Thank you, Mr. Larson," Isabella said with a smile before leaving Dwayne's office.

Dwayne looked at the photo Isabella had given him, rubbed his chin thoughtfully, and figured it was a small thing-no need to bother Michael.

Dwayne then texted the whole company on the internal chat.

Dwayne: [To clarify recent rumors concerning Isabella and Mr. Davis, I want to state that they are not married. A photograph circulating within the company has been misinterpreted. Ms. Isabella was simply helping Mr. Davis with a bug in his eye. Please refrain from further dissemination of this image or any related speculation.]

Dwayne's announcement reached everyone in the company, effectively shutting down the rumor mill.

Meanwhile, Madeline and Odette also received the message.

"She thinks we'll just drop it because she says so? Who does she think she is? I don't care what she says, I'm posting this!" Odette, fuming and irrational, was about to post the photo on social media when Madeline slapped her hand away.

"Enough! Do you have to lose this job to be happy?" Madeline scolded Odette sternly.

"That bitch cursed me, but I have no proof! I am so mad! I need to vent!" Odette looked at Madeline, her eyes were a bit red.

Madeline sighed as she looked at the aggrieved Odette. "My point is, you don't need to do this. The press is all over Isabella; they've probably already got pictures. Let them be the ones to release it-it'll have the same effect. And for heaven's sake, remember what we're really trying to accomplish!"

###chapter 194 Angry Michael

Odette started to chill out after hearing what Madeline had to say. They had another plan to take down Isabella, and if it worked, she'd be kicked out of her director spot in no time.

Odette took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. "Sorry, Ms. Eve. I got a little carried away."

Madeline nodded, her eyes serious. "Isabella's no pushover. We need to tread carefully with her."

Meanwhile, Isabella felt a wave of relief after reading Dwayne's message. With the rumors dying down at work, the whole mess could be contained.

But she couldn't help but glance out the window, wondering if any reporters were lurking around. If they snapped similar photos, would they post them online?

The answer was a big fat yes!

Despite Dwayne's attempts to suppress the office rumors, some reporters still managed to get shots of her helping Joseph with the bug.

Ethical concerns held little sway with these entertainment reporters; they prioritized sensationalism, selecting the most provocative image and crafting a lurid story to attract readers.

Soon enough, a headline blared online: #Mystery Solved! Isabella's Husband Unveiled!

Meanwhile, after leaving Isabella's company, Joseph was on his way to meet some friends when he saw the news alert on his phone and froze.

"When did I become Isabella's husband?" Joseph blinked, then a grin spread across his face.

"I'm not her husband now, but who knows what the future holds?" Joseph chuckled and made sure the news spread even more, so Isabella's real husband would see it.

Even though people talked a lot online about Isabella's husband, articles about it usually didn't grab much attention.

But thanks to Joseph, that photo of Isabella and Joseph "kissing" went viral, and it left everyone speechless.

Before, news about Isabella and her mysterious husband was just rumors and personal pics of Isabella. This was the first time a photo of her kissing another guy popped up, making many think it was legit.

But not Michael.

When Michael saw the news, his hands shook with anger. He almost smashed his phone, but Jerry stopped him just in time.

"Mr. Williams, there must be some mistake! You have to trust Mrs. Williams; she wouldn't do something like this!" Jerry said, grabbing Michael's hand.

Michael shot Jerry a cold look. "Of course, I trust her. I'm pissed because there's definitely some plot behind this! That guy's using her to get to me!"

Michael jumped up from the couch. He just noticed the news article had racked up over a hundred million clicks in no time. That kind of attention was insane! Michael didn't believe for a second this wasn't planned.

Michael knew someone was trying to trick him into revealing who he was, but if they thought that would work, they were dead wrong.

"Mr. Williams, this photo might've been doctored. AI editing is pretty advanced these days. Should we dig into Joseph's background?" Jerry asked cautiously.

Michael nodded. "Yeah, go ahead. All I know is he's from the Davis Family. Dwayne mentioned Joseph visited Isabella today. It's definitely fishy."

Jerry nodded and left to start investigating Joseph.

After Jerry left, Michael grabbed his phone and called Isabella.

"Hey, have you seen the news? Please tell me it's not true." Michael's voice was icy.

Isabella had just wrapped up her work and was stretching in her office. Hearing Michael's words, she couldn't help but picture a guy who seemed cold but was actually nervous and a bit resentful inside.

Isabella chuckled at her own thoughts and laughed into the phone. "Are you talking about the kissing photo?"

She had just caught the news alert and was pretty ticked off, not seeing this blow-up coming.

"So, you've seen it too. Tell me that photo's fake! You didn't kiss him, right?" Michael asked again, sounding urgent.

Isabella covered her mouth, laughing. "I'll answer your questions one by one. First, the photo's not fake; it's real."

On the other end, Michael's eyes widened, and his hand holding the phone shook.

But luckily, Isabella quickly answered the second question. "But I didn't kiss Joseph. He had a bug in his eye and looked like he was in pain, so I blew it away. I had no idea someone would snap that moment from an angle that made it look like a kiss."

After explaining, Isabella could practically feel Michael relax on the other end.

"I knew you wouldn't do what the news said, but I'm still upset you helped him," Michael said, sounding a bit sulky.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "I just blew into his eye. He helped me before, and we were childhood friends. Ignoring him would've made me seem really cold."

"I don't care; you have to blow into my eye too," Michael said with a playful tone.

Isabella laughed, covering her forehead. "There's no bug in your eye. What am I supposed to blow? How about... I blow somewhere else instead?"

###chapter 195 Going to the Detention Center

Michael's breath hitched when he heard Isabella's words, and his mind went straight to the gutter. He could feel the blood rushing south, making things... complicated.

Taking a deep breath, Michael tried to get a grip on himself.

'Damn it! The doc said I can only get busy once a week. It's only day two! Gotta hold it together!' he kept reminding himself.

Isabella didn't hear Michael's response, but she seemed to know exactly what was going on in his head. She teased, "Are you imagining it? How about we give it a go when you get home tonight?"

"Let's hold off a bit, babe. You know those meds I got are pricey. I need to finish them all before... No, wait, I don't need to finish them all. Next week, okay? Just one more week, please!" Michael said, covering his face in embarrassment.

Isabella's laughter rang through the phone.

"Alright, darling, I can wait! It's for your health! I have some stuff to do, so I'll hang up now," Isabella said and ended the call.

Michael looked at his phone and let out a deep sigh.

He suddenly felt someone watching him. Turning around, he saw Jerry.

Jerry looked awkward and gave a nervous smile. "Mr. Williams, I'm here to remind you about the meeting."

Michael's expression turned icy, and he became all business. "What did you hear just now?"

Jerry shook his head frantically. "Mr. Williams, I didn't hear anything. I came in right after you finished the call."

Jerry explained anxiously, not wanting to get into trouble. Michael stared him down, saying nothing. It wasn't until Jerry felt sweat trickling down his back, soaking through his shirt, that Michael finally looked away.

"It's fine if you heard. Just keep it to yourself," Michael said with a smile.

Jerry wasn't buying it and kept shaking his head. "Mr. Williams, I really didn't hear anything. The meeting's about to start, and everyone's waiting for you."

Michael patted Jerry's shoulder, satisfied. "Got it. Let's go."

Jerry followed Michael respectfully, but his mind was elsewhere.

'Seems Mr. Williams is having trouble in the bedroom. That's gotta hurt his pride. Should I find some meds for him?' Jerry wondered.

Meanwhile, after wrapping up her work, Isabella left the office. She had taken a half-day off from Dwayne to visit Jasper.

Leo was already waiting downstairs. Once Isabella got in the car, he started driving toward the detention center.

Leo glanced in the rearview mirror and quickly realized they had a tail. He wasn't sure if it was reporters or someone from the four families.

Isabella noticed Leo's frequent mirror checks and asked, "What's up, Leo? Something off?"

Leo nodded. "Yeah, Ms. Taylor. We're being followed, probably by reporters. Buckle up. I'm gonna try to lose them."

Isabella quickly fastened her seatbelt and grabbed the handle. Leo floored it, and the car took off.

Isabella peeked through the rear windshield and saw the cars behind them speeding up too. But Leo knew the roads like the back of his hand and managed to shake them off pretty quickly.

"Leo, what did you do before this?" Isabella asked, curious.

Leo had his answer ready. "I used to be a bodyguard for a rich guy. Took a bullet for him once and got pretty messed up. My family thought it was too dangerous, so I switched to driving. Didn't think my old skills would come in handy again."

"Thanks, Leo," Isabella said sincerely, grateful for his help in losing their tail.

Isabella made a mental note to ask Dwayne about giving Leo a raise. She'd been followed lately, which meant a lot more work for Leo.

Soon, Leo pulled up at the detention center. Isabella had arranged a private meeting with Jasper.

Inside, she found Jasper in a uniform and handcuffs, sitting at a table.

She sat down across from him.

Jasper sneered, "Happy now? Must be a thrill seeing me in here."

Isabella didn't react to his taunts. "You know who really crossed the line between us."

Jasper sneered again, leaning back and tilting his head. "So, you came here just to gloat?"

He spread his hands. "If so, congrats. It's safe here, but the food sucks, and the uniforms are awful. I miss my wine collection. Guess I'll have to wait a few days to enjoy it again."

Isabella, unfazed by Jasper's attitude, pulled a document from her bag and slid it over to him.

"This is why I came today. I hope you'll agree to this, Dad," Isabella said calmly.

Jasper picked up the document, curious.

After reading it, he smiled coldly. "You put me in this hellhole, and now you want me to hand over all the company shares? You're dreaming."

###chapter 196 Negotiation with Jasper

Isabella shot Jasper a calm look. "You know, those three companies are bleeding money under your watch, and you keep throwing cash at them. Why not let me take over?"

Jasper was floored. Sure, the companies were tanking, but why should he hand them over to Isabella? His anger flared, and he felt the urge to put her down.

"Even if these companies are in the red, I'm not giving them to you. It'd look like I'm handing over the family's power to you, a woman. What makes you think you're up to the task?" Jasper wanted to cross his arms defiantly, but with his hands cuffed, he settled for crossing his legs and lifting his chin.

Isabella's eyebrows knitted together. "Got a problem with women?"

Jasper's lips twisted into a sneer. "So what? Gonna sue me for discrimination? Go ahead. I've got nothing left to lose."

Isabella crossed her arms, staring at Jasper's smug face. She sighed. "You got arrested for framing me. If I sign a letter of understanding, you can walk out of here right now."

"No thanks! We don't need your pity! We know what we're doing. Sure, the food sucks and the clothes are ugly, but at least we're safe!" Jasper waved her off.

Jasper wasn't dumb. He knew if he left now, the angry mob outside would tear him apart. He was safest staying put.

Isabella realized she had underestimated Jasper's ruthlessness. But if he thought he could stay safe here forever, he was dreaming.

Isabella crossed her arms, looking at Jasper with a hint of sarcasm. "Dad, I'm just amazed. You managed to bankrupt three companies in under two years. How'd you pull that off?"

Isabella's words made Jasper's eyebrow twitch.

Jasper sneered at Isabella. "What? Trying to rile me up because you can't get the shares? You're wasting your breath. I've heard too many insults to get mad easily. You have no idea how much work I've put into these companies."

Isabella leaned forward, fingers interlaced, taking an aggressive stance. "Is your 'work' transferring all the money to another account so you can live like a king once you're out of here?"

Isabella noticed Jasper's pupils contract and his body stiffen for a moment.

"I don't know what you're talking about," Jasper said coldly, staring at Isabella.

Isabella could tell from Jasper's reaction that she was right; he was indeed secretly moving assets.

"Dad, cut the crap. Remember the 30 million dollars I borrowed for the company? I checked the accounts, and that money's gone. Curious where it went, I hired a private investigator. They found some juicy stuff. Wanna see?" Isabella's lips curled into a smile. She was bluffing; the PI hadn't found anything.

Jasper's throat bobbed, and panic flickered in his eyes.

Isabella stood up and started pacing.

"I've always wanted to take over Grandpa's companies because I knew they'd tank under your management. So, I started digging a while ago. Found some interesting things. John's been pumping money into the company, but the profits are a joke. Even with his help, the numbers don't add up."

Isabella was being honest. When she borrowed that 30 million, she was already gearing up to take over. She had her people in place.

Sweat dotted Jasper's forehead.

"The yearly profits barely covered the employees' salaries, just enough to keep them from quitting. You kept talking about revitalizing the family, but it was all a big joke. That's when I knew you were cooking something up with the company money." Isabella walked behind Jasper, placing her hands on his shoulders.

"Dad, you've been secretly moving the company's money! What's the deal?" Isabella tilted her head, feigning confusion.

She was just missing one key detail: where Jasper had stashed the assets.

Jasper stayed silent while Isabella tapped her forehead thoughtfully and sat back down.

"Dad, you think Mom would rat you out about where you stashed the cash? If she does, you're going down for life, you know. That's a lifetime in the slammer for what you stole." Isabella's smile was sweet, almost saccharine.

Jasper suddenly looked up, glaring at her fiercely.

"Dad, don't give me that look. If you sign the contract, even if I find the money, I won't expose it. That's our deal. What do you say?" Isabella smiled sweetly, just like she used to when she was a kid.

"When did you get so cunning?" Jasper asked, his voice hoarse with tension.

Isabella's eyes softened with a hint of nostalgia. "Probably when I found out about John and Bianca's betrayal. Or maybe it was when you threatened to kill yourselves to force me to marry John. I never thought such crazy stuff, the kind you see in novels and movies, would happen to me. Reality is stranger than fiction."

Isabella laughed bitterly, then looked at Jasper coldly. "So, what's your answer, Dad?"

###chapter 197 Leave in Disappointment

Jasper stared at Isabella for a long moment before bursting into laughter.

"You've got to be kidding me. You don't have any proof; you've been lying to me this whole time! I'm not confessing, and I'm definitely not signing this contract." Jasper sneered, grabbing the papers on the table and tearing them up.

He tossed the shredded pieces into the air, and they fluttered like pale butterflies, some landing on the floor and others on Isabella.

Isabella sighed as she picked the paper pieces out of her hair.

Even though they were at odds now, Isabella was his daughter, and Jasper knew her well. Some habits die hard, even if she was acting different.

Jasper could tell from Isabella's behavior that she was bluffing. She might have guessed he transferred the money overseas, but she didn't know exactly where.

"Seems like no matter if I try to buy you off or promise not to hold you accountable, you won't budge. Is it really worth it to go against me? You could be living the high life." Isabella looked at Jasper in frustration.

"Save your tricks. Do you think I'd still believe you? Even if it's written on paper, it wouldn't hold up in court." Jasper sneered, looking at Isabella with disdain.

Jasper had ripped off the company, plain and simple. He knew that even if Isabella wrote in the contract that she wouldn't hold him accountable, the fact that he broke the law couldn't be changed. The judge wouldn't let him off, and their contract had no legal standing.

As for the contract Jasper had previously signed with Bianca, it also had no legal standing. But it served as a mutual insurance policy. If one party didn't fulfill the contract, the other would use public pressure to ruin their reputation.

"I'll talk to Mom. You'd better hope she's as tight-lipped as you." Isabella gave Jasper a cold look before leaving the detention center.

Leo had been waiting outside for Isabella. When he saw her come out with a grim expression, he immediately understood that her mission had failed.

"Ms. Taylor, your parents wouldn't admit their mistakes?" Leo asked curiously.

Leo didn't know the exact purpose of Isabella's visit, but he could guess it had something to do with her parents.

Isabella shook her head, not wanting to discuss it further, and instructed Leo to drive back to the villa.

'Mia probably knows something about the money's whereabouts, but given Jasper's selfishness, what he told her might not be true. They're guilty of embezzlement, no question. I need to get a confession out of Mia. That'll keep Jasper behind bars and give me time to track down the cash.' Isabella bit her lip, thinking hard.

When Isabella returned home, she was surprised to find Michael already there.

"Why are you home so early? Shouldn't you be at work?" Isabella asked curiously, seeing Michael busy in the kitchen with an apron on.

Isabella had taken the day off, so she came home early. Did Michael take the day off too?

"If I don't come home and show some effort, my wife might end up with someone else." Michael rolled his eyes and placed the fish fillet in the frying pan.

The fish sizzled in the pan, and Michael added a small piece of butter. The aroma of the butter mixed with the fish was mouth-watering.

Isabella put down her handbag and walked into the kitchen. She hugged Michael from behind.

"Darling, are you jealous?" Isabella asked, smiling as she peeked over Michael's shoulder.

Michael shook his head. "Jealous of Joseph? He's from one of the top four families, I'm just a mid-level employee. It's like school - the last-place kid never envies the top student."

Isabella could feel his jealousy; it was almost palpable. "To me, you're number one. Neither John nor Joseph can even come close to my heart."

Isabella hugged Michael, her hand caressing his chest.

Feeling the warmth of her hand, Michael sighed. He flipped the fish in the pan, then turned around and hugged her.

"Have you ever thought that if I were a member of one of the four families, I might be able to help you more? Maybe I could have ended all this sooner, or even prevented it from happening. You wouldn't have had to suffer so much," Michael said softly, gently stroking Isabella's hair, his eyes full of tenderness.

Isabella didn't catch Michael's probing tone and smiled warmly. "Don't forget, my family used to be one of the big four. I know how glamorous they seem on the surface, but behind the scenes, they're like rotten sludge. Honestly, I'm relieved you're not part of that world. Being with you, without all that baggage, is a blessing."

Michael smiled and hugged her tightly.

If Isabella looked up now, she would see the bitter smile on Michael's face.

Isabella used to just hate the Williams Family and refused to marry anyone connected to them. Now, she hated all four big families.

This was partly due to the harm Pearl had caused her, and also the injuries inflicted by Jasper and Mia, who were once part of the four great families.

More importantly, Isabella believed that Pearl's miserable state was due to the other two families trying to provoke a conflict between the Brown Family and the Williams Family. Therefore, she harbored the same hatred for the remaining two families.

Michael's heart grew heavier. If Isabella ever learned the truth, would she leave him in anger?

While Michael was lost in his thoughts about the future, Isabella suddenly screamed.

"Oh no, Darling, your fish is burning!" Isabella quickly pushed Michael aside and took over the kitchen.

###chapter 198 Angry John

In a private room at the bar, John and his crew were knocking back drinks.

Usually, this place was buzzing, but tonight it was dead silent. John was in the corner, downing drink after drink, with empty bottles piling up in front of him.

Everyone else was on edge, watching John. He was the boss here, and nobody wanted to say anything that might set him off.

John's eyes were stormy. He looked up and barked at the group, "What are you all staring at? Drink up!"

The group, startled, erupted into a flurry of loud chatter, forced laughter, dice, and cards - anything to break the tension.

John called the manager over, ordered a pricey bottle, twisted off the cap, and drank straight from it.

The liquor spilled down his mouth, neck, and soaked into his shirt.

John was drowning in sorrow. Mason's announcement to the media had killed any chance of him marrying Bianca.

John had always looked up to Mason, but now there was a growing rift between them.

Frustration gnawed at John, but he had no way to let it out. He'd been trying to reach Bianca for days, but she wouldn't pick up.

Suddenly, the door to the private room swung open, and everyone turned to look. It was like someone hit the mute button; they all stared in shock at the doorway.

John frowned. He needed the noise to drown out his inner chaos. He was about to tell everyone to get loud again, but then he saw who was at the door and froze.

Standing there in a white dress, looking a bit fragile, was Bianca. She seemed nervous.

John locked eyes with Bianca, and she stared right back.

The room was dead quiet, but it felt like it was buzzing with anger. Everyone but John and Bianca was tense, sensing the storm brewing inside John was about to break, and they might get caught in it.

"Everyone, get out," John's low voice cut through the silence.

The others bolted for the door, some even losing a shoe in their rush but not daring to go back for it.

Bianca stepped aside to let them leave, knowing John wasn't talking to her.

John kept his eyes on Bianca but then looked away, focusing on the bottle on the table. He tilted his head back, drained it, and then hurled it at Bianca's feet.

The glass bottle shattered, sending shards everywhere.

John, eyes red with rage, roared like a beast, "Why didn't you answer my calls? And why did you lie to me?"

Bianca bit her lip and walked towards John. Her feet crunched on the shards, some piercing through her shoes and into her feet, staining her shoes with blood.

John glanced at her feet, a flicker of pain crossing his eyes.

"Enough! Don't try to play me with your tricks. Just tell me, why did you lie?" John closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, they were cold as ice.

"What if I told you I was deceived too? Would you believe me?" Bianca's eyes welled up, tears streaming down her face.

John stayed silent, waiting for her to go on.

Bianca stepped closer. "Jasper and Mia came to me, saying they had a way to get Mason to agree to our marriage. All I had to do was go against Isabella and follow their plan. I knew it would hurt Isabella, which I hated, but... I had to choose between her and you, and you won."

John's eyes flickered. He took a deep breath and turned his head away from Bianca's tear-streaked face.

"I just don't get it. Why would Jasper and Mia team up with you against their own daughter?" John asked, his voice deep and rough.

Bianca wiped her tears. "They wanted access to your family's resources. At first, they wanted Isabella to marry you to achieve that, but when she called off the engagement, they turned to me. They knew you liked me and thought I could help the family. They didn't pick me before because I'm not their biological daughter, and they thought Isabella would be easier to control. But their plan backfired."

Suddenly, Bianca started slapping herself. "If you're mad, do whatever you want to me! But please, stop drinking; it's killing you."

Her actions were so sudden that John didn't react in time. By the time he did, she'd already slapped herself several times.

John stood up angrily, pulled Bianca up from the floor, gripped her hand, and shouted, "What are you doing? Do you think this will make me forgive you?"

Bianca's eyes were all red and puffy from crying. She looked at John, quiet and heartbroken. "I don't expect you to forgive me. This is my fate. My uncle is the head of the family, and even though the family has fallen, I still have to dedicate myself to it. I wasn't brave enough to stand up to them like Isabella. I lied to everyone, but please believe me, I love you."

John looked into Bianca's eyes, feeling a pang of pain in his heart.

"I've apologized to you. If you're not going to punish me, then I need to go apologize to Isabella. When Jasper approached me, I was tempted. I thought ruining Isabella's name would make Mason choose me. I was so stupid. I had no idea how important she is to him. I'm leaving now. Goodbye." Bianca wiped her tears and turned to leave.

"Did I say you could go?" John growled angrily, pulling Bianca back and holding her tightly in his arms.

###chapter 199 Venting Desire

Bianca stared up at John, totally stunned, his eyes blazing with a wild, almost animalistic look.

"I haven't even decided your punishment. How can you just leave?" John panted, lifting Bianca and tossing her onto the sofa in the private room.

Bianca had a pretty good idea of what John was planning next. Blushing, she looked at him. "If this is your punishment, then I accept."

John leaned in closer, tearing at her clothes roughly. The room soon filled with the sounds of his heavy breathing and Bianca's soft moans.

That night, the bar owner made sure everyone stayed away from the private room, knowing full well what was likely going on inside. So, John and Bianca were left undisturbed.

Meanwhile, Isabella and Michael were getting cozy too, but they were just lying on the bed, kissing and talking, their bodies close, hands gently exploring each other, without going any further.

Michael's hand softly stroked Isabella's back as he held her close, his eyes deep in thought.

"So, the main thing now is figuring out where Jasper moved the money?" Michael asked.

Isabella nodded and filled Michael in on what had happened at the detention center today.

"I think Mia is our key. We might be able to find out where Jasper hid the money from her, but I doubt her info will be reliable. Jasper never trusted anyone," Isabella sighed.

Michael held Isabella with one hand, his fingers gently playing with her long hair, while his other hand softly massaged her hand.

"You're right to be suspicious, but Mia's still our best lead. For now, we need to prove Jasper stole the money so he stays locked up. That'll give us time to dig deeper," Michael said, looking at Isabella.

Isabella looked up and smiled at Michael. "We're on the same page. So now we need to figure out how to get Mia to spill the beans."

Michael nodded, frowning, and fell into deep thought.

If they were abroad, Michael could easily have someone intimidate information out of Jasper and Mia in prison, but this wasn't his usual stomping ground. His usual methods wouldn't work.

"Jasper and Mia are staying in the detention center to avoid the current media frenzy. Once the hype dies down, they'll come out and probably go back to their lavish lifestyle with that money. Maybe we should tweak our plan: have someone tail them after they get out and track the money's trail," Michael suggested.

Isabella nodded. "Makes sense, but Jasper might ditch Mia and make a run for it. If that happens, we could use it to our advantage and nab him again."

"Exactly. You're a genius, always one step ahead." Michael kissed Isabella's forehead. Isabella met his teasing gaze, realizing he'd already considered this and was having a little fun at her expense.

"You cheeky guy, always knowing what to say." Isabella blushed and gave Michael's waist a playful twist.

Michael winced, sucking in a breath, and then smacked Isabella's butt. "Don't pinch my waist again, okay? It really hurts!"

"How dare you hit me?" Isabella shot back, tickling Michael's armpit.

Michael immediately felt the tickles and retaliated by tickling Isabella's waist.

Isabella burst into laughter, and soon they were in a full-blown tickle fight on the bed.

They blocked each other's arms while trying to tickle each other. After a few minutes, they were both panting heavily on the bed.

"I'm exhausted. This is more tiring than sex." Isabella brushed her hair back from her face.

Michael suddenly climbed on top of Isabella, looking down at her.

Isabella looked at his face and smiled. "What do you want to do? Did you forget the doctor said you can only have sex once a week?"

In their previous chat, Michael had told Isabella what the doctor said. When she mentioned it again, a mix of emotions played across his face.

"How about we try? I don't think I'm as weak as the doctor said. I think I can manage twice a week." Michael gritted his teeth, his gaze slowly moving to Isabella's chest, and he reached out his trembling hand, clearly struggling internally.

Isabella rolled her eyes and slapped his hand away.

She lightly patted Michael's waist. "Honey, I think you should listen to the doctor. I don't want this to turn into something we can't fix. We're still young. I don't want you to turn me on but not be able to satisfy me when we're 30."

Michael's mouth twitched. "Am I really that bad? At worst, it might be a bit shorter. We lasted over an hour now, right? Maybe it'll be half an hour in the future?"

Isabella sneered and pushed Michael off her. "Don't you realize a woman's needs only increase? Mine will keep growing, while you'll just become useless."

"Enough. I'll start taking my medicine on time from tomorrow." Michael covered his head in agony, unable to imagine how miserable his future life would be.

Isabella knew Michael was doubting himself. He always had a certain confidence, but this was clearly getting to him.

###chapter 200 Control Yourself

Isabella saw the disappointment on Michael's face and moved closer, gently touching his cheek. She whispered, "Hey, don't be so down. How about I give you a special surprise in a week?"

Her cheeks turned a bit red as she winked at him.

Michael's mind started racing with all sorts of ideas, and his breathing got faster.

Just as he was about to say something, Isabella put a finger over his lips.

"I know what you're thinking. Don't even go there. Just wait for seven days!" she said, hopping off the bed.

"To make sure you get through these seven days without any trouble, we're gonna sleep separately. No more sharing a bed for now," Isabella said with a smile, waving at him before heading out.

Michael reached out from the bed, pleading, "Oh, come on, babe. You can't do this. I'm so used to having you next to me. I'll feel lost and won't be able to sleep without you."

Isabella stopped at the door and turned around with a sigh. "But I'm really worried about your health."

Michael quickly said, "I swear I'll just hold you quietly and won't do anything. If I break this promise, may I never get erected again..."

Before he could finish, Isabella covered his mouth.

She glared at him. "How could you make such a harsh vow? Have you thought about me?"

Michael took her hand and placed it on his chest. "Feel my heartbeat. It's steady, which means I can control myself."

Feeling his calm heartbeat, Isabella hesitated for a moment, then said seriously, "Alright, we can sleep in the same bed, but we have to use separate blankets!"

Michael was happy at first but frowned at the second condition.

"You still don't trust me. I just want to hold you while we sleep. Please, give it a try," he pleaded.

Anyone who knew Michael, like Jerry, would be shocked to see him like this. Was this really the same strong and confident Michael?

Isabella hesitated but finally decided to give him a chance. She lay down on the bed, and Michael happily wrapped his arms around her.

As the night went on, Michael turned off the light and hugged Isabella like a soft pillow.

Feeling his warmth, Isabella gradually fell asleep, but in her dreams, she felt a tickling sensation on her butt.

She opened her eyes to find Michael's hand exploring her butt, as if checking if she was really asleep, and his heartbeat was speeding up.

Isabella sighed and pinched his nose. "Didn't you say you wouldn't do anything? What are you doing? And your heartbeat is racing."

Michael groaned and rolled onto his back.

"Sorry, I can't help it. You're just too irresistible!" he said in frustration. He had never felt his willpower so weak.

Isabella blushed, feeling flattered by his words. She felt his deep love but knew she had to resist for his health.

"Honey, I think I'll get another blanket. Maybe that will lessen the temptation." Isabella smiled, walked to the closet, and grabbed another blanket, placing it on the bed.

"Goodnight, my love." She smiled as she got under the blanket and turned off the light.

The clock on the wall kept ticking, and in the dark room, Michael's low voice broke the silence.

"Honey, are you asleep?" he asked softly.

From Isabella's side came the sound of steady breathing, indicating she was asleep.

Michael cautiously slipped his hand under Isabella's blanket, but as soon as he touched her, she snorted coldly.

"If you really can't control yourself, I'll have to sleep in another room," Isabella warned him, her eyes bright even in the dark.

"Damn it, you weren't asleep. You tricked me!" Michael grumbled, biting his lip and covering his head with the blanket.

Outside the blanket, Isabella's laughter could be heard, but she didn't leave the bed, which made Michael feel a bit better.

"It's just temptation, I can handle it." Michael scoffed, poking his head out from under the blanket and taking a deep breath to control his desire.

As time passed, he felt tired and finally fell asleep.

That night, Michael and Isabella slept peacefully, but in the bar's private room, John and Bianca were having a wild night.

The next morning, John woke up on the couch in the bar's private room. Beneath him lay Bianca, her clothes torn.

Tears glistened at the corners of Bianca's eyes, and her expression was one of pain. Every slight movement of her legs seemed to intensify her discomfort, indicating that the previous night's events had been particularly harsh on her.

John's gaze moved to Bianca's swollen and red lower body, a clear sign of the rough treatment she had endured.

Seeing the bloodstains on the couch, John remembered it was Bianca's first time.

John quickly left the room. Bianca, with her eyes half-open, watched his retreating figure, a hint of sadness in her gaze.

Soon, John returned with a set of staff uniforms, and Bianca quickly closed her eyes.

"This is the only clothing I could find. Put it on for now." John gently placed the clothes on the table.

Bianca slowly opened her eyes, looking at the clothes and softly thanked him.

John's throat tightened as he watched Bianca dress, not because he wanted to do anything to her, but because he didn't know what to say.

After Bianca was dressed, John suddenly asked, "What do you plan to do next? I can help you find a job."

Bianca was silent for a moment before shaking her head. "I don't want you to do anything for me anymore, and I don't want to cause a rift between you and your grandfather."

###chapter 201 Madeline's Conspiracy

John's hands shook a bit when he heard what Bianca said. He looked up at her, and finally, like he'd finally made up his mind, he pulled her into a tight hug.

"No way anyone's taking you from me, not even my grandpa, unless I say so!" John declared.

Bianca leaned into his arms, tears rolling down her cheeks again, but a small, triumphant smile appeared on her lips.

Meanwhile, Isabella had no clue what was going on with Bianca. After wrapping up plans with Michael, she went back to her usual work. Even though she had told Dwayne she was quitting, she needed to secure all the family company shares before officially leaving.

One day, just as Isabella was about to start her work, she got a call from Dwayne asking her to come to his office.

Isabella knocked on Dwayne's office door. After hearing a response, she walked in.

"Mr. Larson, do you need something?" Isabella asked.

Dwayne smiled and motioned for her to come closer. "Isabella, I knew you wouldn't give up so easily."

Isabella was caught off guard, not getting what he meant.

"Give up? What are you talking about?" Isabella asked, confused.

Dwayne stepped out from behind his desk, holding a fax. "This is a fax from the international design competition, congratulating you on winning first prize."

Isabella frowned as she took the fax, her confusion growing with each word she read.

Dwayne, noticing her reaction, was surprised. "What's wrong? Aren't you happy about winning?"

Isabella got what Dwayne was referring to. He had asked her before if she wanted to join the competition, but she had said no, thinking she would soon take over her family business. Now, getting a congratulatory fax was confusing.

"Mr. Larson, if I tell you I didn't enter this competition, would you believe me?" Isabella asked, putting the fax back on the desk.

Dwayne frowned, puzzled. "What do you mean? Didn't you sign up?"

Isabella shook her head with a bitter smile. "Mr. Larson, I've been swamped with media, dealing with reporters, gathering evidence for lawsuits, and now I'm getting ready to take over the family business. Do you really think I had time for a design competition?"

Dwayne was stunned. Isabella's explanation made sense; everything she said was a huge pain, no way she had time for that competition.

"If it wasn't you, then who?" Dwayne asked, his voice low, sensing something fishy.

Isabella thought for a moment and then got it. "Mr. Larson, what if someone took their work and submitted it under my name? Once I win, they plan to accuse me of plagiarism."

Dwayne caught on quickly. "Madeline?"

Isabella smiled. "Mr. Larson, Madeline's been here for years. You should know her design style. Ask the competition to send the work, and you'll see."

Dwayne nodded. "If that's the case, there's no need to keep her around. Don't worry, I'll look into this."

Dwayne started his investigation, and Isabella went back to her office.

As Isabella walked by the office area, she glanced at Madeline's office, a cold smile on her lips.

Inside Madeline's office, Odette was talking about their next steps with Madeline.

"Ms. Eve, when I was dropping off some papers for Mr. Larson, I saw a fax saying Isabella won that competition. It was a little early, so we should wait for the official online results before we do our thing," Odette said with a smile.

Madeline crossed her arms, smirking. "You're right. It's not time yet. Let's wait a bit longer and let things simmer. Isabella's already in the spotlight, so a whole bunch of people online are gonna see what a jerk she is."

Isabella had already figured out Madeline's plan, but she had no proof. When she got back to her office, she suddenly remembered something and took out her phone to play a video.

The video showed Odette entering Isabella's office, inserting a USB drive into her computer, and doing something. After finishing, Odette removed the USB drive and left.

Since discovering the convenience of hidden cameras, Isabella had installed one in her office, discreetly placed inside a wall clock.

One day, when Isabella heard Juliet mention that Odette had been in her office, she became alarmed.

'Since that day, Odette and Madeline have never entered my office, yet they managed to use my computer and send emails in my name. It seems the USB drive Odette plugged into my computer contained a virus, allowing them to control my account,' Isabella thought as she tapped on her keyboard, pondering how to fix the issue.

Initially, Isabella had considered giving Madeline a chance when she resigned, recognizing Madeline's competence. But Madeline kept going after her, and Isabella felt really let down. Madeline's jealousy had clouded her judgment, making her a liability to the team.

As Isabella was coming up with a plan, her phone suddenly rang. She glanced at the screen-it was Charles calling.

###chapter 202 Mason Was Hospitalized

Isabella stared at her phone, seeing Charles's name pop up. Weird. Charles never called her, especially not since he gave her that ring. What was this about?

She wondered if Mason was looking for her. But why wouldn't Mason just call her himself?

She picked up, and Charles's tired voice came through.

"Isabella, can you come to the hospital? Mr. Williams has been admitted," he said, his voice grave.

"What? Mason's in the hospital?" Isabella shot up from her chair, grabbing her stuff in a hurry.

As she rushed out of her office, she almost bumped into Juliet. She waved her off quickly.

"I've got an emergency at the hospital. Tell Mr. Larson I need half a day off," she said, not stopping for a second.

Juliet blinked, surprised, then ran off to find Dwayne.

Meanwhile, Madeline and Odette caught wind of Isabella's sudden leave.

"That woman is getting so full of herself! She didn't even bother to ask for leave properly, just sent her assistant. So arrogant!" Odette scoffed.

Madeline watched Isabella rush out through the window and smirked. "She won't be so high and mighty for long."

In his office, Dwayne was busy trying to get Isabella's entry from the competition organizers when Juliet burst in with the news. He looked up, startled.

"Did she say why she was going to the hospital? Is she okay?" he asked, worried.

Juliet shook her head. "No, but she seemed really anxious."

"Alright, I'll call her. You can go," Dwayne said, waving her off and dialing Isabella's number.

When he found out she was just visiting Mason, he relaxed. As long as Isabella was fine, Michael wouldn't be worried.

"Okay, send my best to Mr. Williams and wish him a quick recovery," Dwayne said before hanging up.

Isabella ended the call, frowning.

She had asked Charles why Mason was in the hospital. Charles told her it wasn't just a regular sickness; it was all because of John. Apparently, John and Mason had a fight, and it made Mason sick.

With Leo driving fast, Isabella got to the hospital in no time.

She rushed into the ward and found Mason lying in bed, munching on some fruit.

"Isabella, why are you here? I told Charles not to bother you. Sit down," Mason said, motioning to the chair by his bed.

Isabella looked at Mason, worry etched on her face. "Mason, how are you feeling?"

Mason waved her off. "Same old, same old. Just got too worked up and fainted. Nothing serious. I'm already feeling better after some rest."

To prove his point, Mason even stretched his arms and waved them around, showing he was still full of life.

Seeing Mason in good spirits, Isabella felt a wave of relief.

"Mason, what happened? I heard it had something to do with John. What did he do to upset you?" she asked, her voice tinged with anger.

Mason sighed. "Charles tells you everything, huh?"

Isabella squeezed Mason's hand. "Don't blame Charles. Just tell me what happened."

Mason patted her hand. "What else? It's about Bianca."

"Bianca? I thought she was avoiding John. Did she show up?" Isabella asked, surprised.

Mason nodded. "Yeah, and John forgave her again. I should've seen it coming. Ever since I tried to keep them apart, things have been tense between John and me. Now, it's completely broken."

Mason slapped his thigh in frustration, and Isabella held his hand tighter.

"Mason, don't worry. Just tell me what John said," she urged.

Thinking about John's visit, Mason started coughing violently. Isabella patted his back until he calmed down.

"Forget it, Mason. I won't pry. I don't want to upset you again," she said, quickly handing him a glass of water.

Mason looked at her, his eyes distant, and sighed deeply.

"It's my fault. If I had realized sooner that you and John had no feelings for each other, I wouldn't have kept pushing you," Mason said, then began recounting John's visit.

After breakfast, John had shown up out of the blue. Under Mason's puzzled gaze, John told him he would never marry anyone but Bianca.

Mason, furious, grabbed his cane and struck John's back. Normally, John would dodge, but this time he took it.

"Hit me if you want. But I'm not here to talk. I'm just informing you of my decision because it's made! Bianca knows she was wrong. It was Isabella's parents who forced her. Grandpa, you shouldn't blame her. It's not her fault she was born into that family," John said, looking at Mason with determination.

Mason was so angry he trembled all over. After John left, Mason couldn't catch his breath and fainted.

In the hospital, Mason angrily patted Isabella's hand. "Can you believe what that brat said? He said he wasn't here to talk, just to tell me what to think! What gives him the right to lecture me?"

###chapter 203 The Function of the Ring

Isabella's lips twitched a bit. She never thought John, who was always scared of Mason, would actually stand up to him.

'If I told you what John and Bianca did to me, you'd probably freak out and end up in the ER again,' Isabella thought to herself, deciding to keep quiet for now.

Suddenly, an idea popped into Isabella's head. She glanced around the room, puzzled, and then asked Mason, "Didn't you tell your nephews about this? They could totally put John in his place!"

Mason just smiled and shook his head. "Forget it. John grew up with me, and his dad and uncle are always busy. He might respect them, but he doesn't fear them. If he's willing to go against me, he definitely won't listen to his dad or uncle."

"No, Mason, I'm not talking about educating John. I mean, they should really teach him a lesson. Break his legs or something! Keep him stuck at home so he can't see Bianca!" Isabella said, dead serious.

Mason opened his mouth, then gave a bitter smile. "Now I see you really don't like him."

Isabella flashed a sweet smile. John had already broken one leg in a car accident and the other in a street fight. She really wanted to kick him where it hurts and break his manhood.

Even though Mason was mad, he wouldn't go as far as breaking John's legs himself.

"I haven't told my kids and nephews about me being in the hospital. They're too busy, so let's not drag them into this. Besides, even if they came back, it wouldn't change much. I have my annual check-up around this time anyway, so I'll just think of this hospital stay as a big check-up. Don't worry too much about me. By the way, Charles said you had something to talk to me about. Now's a good time. What is it?" Mason changed the subject.

Isabella then remembered the ring Mason had sent her through Charles. She immediately asked about its origin and purpose.

Mason's face lit up with understanding. He knew Isabella would ask about it.

"That ring was left by your grandparents. It's actually a key, but I have no idea what it opens. When your grandpa gave it to me, he said none of his descendants were fit to manage the family business. He thought the family would fall apart if left to them. So, he gave the ring to me, telling me to pass it on to a Taylor who could restore the family's honor," Mason explained with a smile.

Isabella gave a wry smile. "Sounds like a secret society thing."

Mason nodded with a grin. "You're not too far off. It's like something from those novels you young folks read. This ring's a symbol, a way for your grandfather to control his loyal followers - each of the top four families has them."

Mason's words piqued Isabella's interest, but she quickly shook her head with a bitter smile.

"Forget it, Mason. Loyalty's the last thing you can rely on. My grandfather's been gone for ages. I can't guarantee this ring still holds any sway over those people," Isabella said, not taking it too seriously.

Mason got where she was coming from. He couldn't be sure if those people would still respond to the ring's call either.

"I know you want to inherit everything your grandfather left behind and bring the family's glory back. If you need my help with anything, just let me know. I'll definitely help you!" Mason said.

Seeing Isabella about to speak, Mason waved his hand to stop her. "Don't rush to refuse. Think of it as an investment. You've got more potential than your father."

He'd convinced her. She nodded appreciatively and expressed her thanks with a smile.

After spending some time at the hospital, Isabella headed back to the company since she had only taken a half-day off.

Not long after Isabella left the hospital, Michael showed up.

Mason was surprised to see him. "How did you know I was here?"

Michael smiled as he sat down next to Mason. "Did you forget our family sponsors this hospital? The director called me, saying he couldn't stand seeing you upset and asked me to come and cheer you up."

Mason smiled wryly. "You all treat me as if I were senile. It's true I'm getting on in years, but it's infuriating! Why won't anyone let me decide for myself?"

"Because we all care about you," Michael said with a smile, then his expression turned serious.

"Mason, do you want me to teach John a lesson?" Michael asked.

Mason shook his head. "Forget it. Are you planning on breaking John's legs, too?"

Michael was taken aback. "What are you talking about? Did someone else suggest breaking his legs?"

Mason found it amusing. "Isabella said the same thing when she visited me earlier. I don't know if she was serious or just trying to please me. If you think the same, then you two are on the same page."

Michael smiled. "Seems like Isabella cares about you too. Mason, I've always wondered-you know John loves Bianca, right? So why push him to marry Isabella? It's obvious she's happy with her husband."

Michael wanted to get some answers from Mason, as his father Kenna had only given him part of the story last time.

###chapter 204 Break Your Legs

Mason's eyes flickered for a second when he heard Michael's question. He just waved it off. "No big reason. I just think they make a good pair. Plus, Isabella's grandpa and I had this old agreement that if our kids were a boy and a girl, they'd get hitched. It's a promise I made to him."

But Michael wasn't buying it.

He'd always thought it had something to do with Isabella's grandma, probably some leftover drama from the past.

Mason had explained that he wanted John to marry Isabella because her family had many enemies, and only the Williams family's power could protect them.

Now, Michael could see Mason had his own reasons. But Mason wasn't spilling, and pushing him might make things worse.

"Why do old folks love keeping secrets?" Michael muttered, scratching his head as he left the hospital.

He got into the car parked on the street, and Jerry leaned over from the driver's seat.

"Mr. Michael Williams, what's the plan? Should we go find Mr. John Williams?" Jerry asked.

Michael sat in the back, tapping his knee with his fingers, thinking about whether to give John a piece of his mind.

Finally, he shook his head. "Nah, if Mason's not gonna teach John a lesson..."

Before he could finish, his phone rang. He saw it was Leo calling.

Michael's heart skipped a beat, and he quickly answered.

"What's up? Is Isabella in trouble?" Michael asked, worried.

Leo's hesitant voice came through. "Mr. Williams, I'm not sure if I should tell you this, but Ms. Taylor got a call and then went to find John. The caller seemed to be Joseph."

Michael raised an eyebrow. He doubted Isabella went to John for a friendly chat. She was probably planning to break his legs.

Michael took a deep breath. "Did Isabella bring any weapons?"

Leo hesitated, not because of Michael's calm reaction, but because he was right!

"Yeah, she brought a baseball bat. She said she was gonna break John's legs," Leo said.

Michael sighed. He knew he was right. Mason treated Isabella so well, but John had angered him so badly that he ended up in the hospital. Isabella wouldn't let John get away with it easily.

"Listen, you must protect Isabella and make sure she doesn't get hurt, got it?" Michael said firmly.

Leo's voice came through the phone. "Don't worry, Mr. Williams. I've been following Ms. Taylor closely, staying hidden. If John or anyone else tries to hurt her, I'll step in and handle it!"

With Leo's assurance, Michael felt relieved.

After hanging up, Michael turned to Jerry. "Get me a few bodyguards John knows but Isabella doesn't. We're going to find John."

Jerry nodded and got to work.

Meanwhile, after his argument with Mason, John found Bianca again. This time, they were at a friend's yacht party.

Hearing that John had argued with Mason for her, Bianca wept and begged him to apologize, but John refused to be swayed.

"I'm done listening to my grandfather. No one can tell me who to love. It's my choice!" John said firmly.

Bianca was so moved she almost hugged and kissed him right there, but they were surrounded by people.

Just then, a baseball bat came flying, smashing the bottles on their table.

Glass shards flew everywhere, startling everyone. John quickly pulled Bianca back.

"What the hell? Who did that?" John yelled, looking around, only to see Isabella approaching with a cold expression.

"Isabella? Did you throw that bat? What do you want?" John demanded angrily.

Bianca, scared, clung to John, looking at Isabella. "Isabella, I know you're upset about me and John, but you can't do this! The glass almost cut John's face."

"Save your drama and stop talking to me like that, or I'll smash your face with this bat," Isabella said, picking up the bat and pointing it at Bianca with a look of disgust.

Bianca was terrified by the fierceness in Isabella's eyes and didn't dare to speak again.

"Isabella, have you lost it? Do you even know where you are?" John stood in front of Bianca, glaring at Isabella.

Isabella raised the bat and looked at him with disdain. "You're being a complete idiot, letting her walk all over you, while your grandpa's in the hospital because of your dumb moves. And here you are, partying like nothing's wrong? You're such a jerk. You make me sick."

John frowned, confused. "My grandfather is hospitalized? How come I didn't know?"

John's innocent expression only made Isabella angrier. She raised the bat high and swung it at his head.

John was startled and quickly dodged. The bat smashed into the bottles in front of him, shattering another one.

"You didn't know? Too bad, because you're about to pay the price." Isabella, her eyes red with anger, swung the bat at John repeatedly.

Everyone around was shocked by Isabella's fierceness. They had always thought of her as gentle, but today they saw a different side.

"Isabella, I'm warning you, one more move and I'm not holding back!" John dodged continuously, his anger rising. He knew he had done something wrong so he wasn't fighting back.

"You'd better fight back because I'm looking for an excuse to break your legs!" Isabella said, swinging the bat at John's knees.

###chapter 205 Fierce Isabella

Isabella, though tough, wasn't as strong as a guy. In a rush, John grabbed a chair to block Isabella's swing, then quickly snatched the bat from her.

"You crazy woman, you've really pissed me off," John growled, yanking the bat from Isabella's hands and swinging it at her.

Isabella didn't flinch. She grabbed a bottle from the table and chucked it at John.

Just then, a big guy rushed out from behind Isabella and grabbed John's bat.

But Isabella's bottle smashed right onto John's head, shattering and making blood trickle down his forehead.

Bianca screamed and rushed to hold John.

"John, are you okay? Someone call an ambulance, quick!" Bianca cried, but John just patted her head.

"I'm fine. It's just a small cut. Who are you?" John asked coldly, looking at the guy in front of him.

Isabella was shocked to see Leo suddenly appear. "Leo, what are you doing here?"

Leo smiled at John. "Mr. Williams, let me introduce myself. I'm the driver arranged by Ms. Taylor's company."

John's eyes flickered. Leo's words were a reminder that he was there under Michael's orders to protect Isabella.

"Who are you? Are you with Isabella? I'm calling the cops. Isabella will pay for this," Bianca screamed, pulling out her phone to call the police.

John suddenly grabbed Bianca's phone. "Forget it."

Bianca stared at him in disbelief. "Why? You're hurt!"

John sighed. "Serves me right. I ticked Grandpa off so bad he ended up in the hospital."

After speaking, John looked at Isabella. "Are you satisfied now? You've taught me a lesson."

"It's far from enough. What I really want is to break your legs, not just give you a small cut!" Isabella said fiercely.

"Isabella, you're going too far. John's dropped it, so get over it!" Bianca stood in front of John, glaring at Isabella like an angry mother leopard.

Isabella shrugged, barely looking at Bianca. "Oh yeah, you. What are you still doing here? Jasper and Mia are in jail - you should be too!"

Bianca went white. She'd been busted before for trashing Isabella's place and stealing her stuff. Jail was the last place she wanted to be again.

"Enough, Isabella. I'm not going after you for what happened, so back off Bianca," John said, pulling Bianca behind him. He believed that a mature man shouldn't let his woman stand in front to take the hit.

Isabella sneered and shook her head. "Why does it seem like I'm the villain here?"

She looked at John and Bianca with a mocking smile. "This is your final warning. Mason is like a grandfather to me. I won't let anyone hurt him. Especially you, John. Yeah, he's your grandpa - he'll ground you, maybe even belt you, but he won't kill you. I'm not so forgiving. Don't test me."

With a murderous glare at John, Isabella turned and left the yacht.

Leo followed closely behind her, his burly frame shielding her from any sudden attacks.

John's face was pale. Isabella's words had indeed shaken him.

'Shit, I'm seriously freaked out by that woman,' John cursed himself inwardly.

Bianca clung to John's waist, resting her head on his chest, crying, "Isabella's terrifying! John, maybe we should split up. You should go apologize to your grandpa."

"No, not happening. Nobody's breaking us up. Besides, he's probably still mad at me. It'll only make things worse if I show my face," John shook his head helplessly.

John was right. Just mentioning the fight with Mason - that's all it took - and it sent Mason into a coughing fit because of bad memories.

If John went to the hospital now, he was more likely to receive news of Mason fainting rather than his forgiveness. If Mason fainted in the hospital, the entire city's media would converge there. It wouldn't be long before Owen heard the news and returned from abroad.

John had grown up with Mason, and his father Owen hadn't been around much to raise him. Mason's a frail old man now, but Owen was strong as an ox! John shuddered thinking about Owen coming back and beating him up.

'If my father shows up and Isabella is there, that bitch would definitely hand him a baseball bat,' John thought, shivering.

John took a deep breath, trying to dispel the images from his mind. As Mason had said, even if Owen returned, nothing would change. Besides giving him a beating, it wouldn't change anything.

"Forget it. Come on, Bianca, let's go back to the room and rest," John said, pulling Bianca off the yacht.

After Bianca and John left, Michael, who was on his way, received a call from Leo.

Jerry, behind the wheel, heard Leo's report and smirked. "Wow, Mrs. Williams is a real tiger!"

Michael smiled. "That's my wife! Her style is becoming more and more like mine. I love it."

###chapter 206 Investigating Joseph

Michael was pretty stoked about what Isabella did. He'd been ticked off with John for ages. Even if Isabella hadn't stepped in, he would've. But honestly, Michael thought just smashing a bottle over John's head was too easy; John deserved to have his legs broken, just like Isabella suggested.

Jerry, who was behind the wheel, couldn't help but smirk. 'If the Williamses weren't loaded, they'd be the biggest crooks around,' he thought.

But then, Michael's laughter cut off, and he looked annoyed.

"Wait a sec, what did Leo say? Isabella got the info from Joseph? Why's that guy even calling her?" Michael's voice was low, like a brewing storm.

Jerry rolled his eyes discreetly. "Mr. Williams, you gotta have faith in Mrs. Williams. Even if Joseph's got other ideas, she wouldn't go for it."

"No need to remind me. I trust Isabella," Michael said, rolling his eyes. But then something clicked in his mind.

"Didn't I tell you to dig into Joseph? Got anything yet?" Michael asked, frowning.

Jerry silently grumbled to himself, 'I'm drowning! Dealing with your fake wife, running the company, this mess, plus hiring detectives? Give me a break!'

On the outside, Jerry kept his cool. "I've got some leads and I'm checking them out. We should have news soon."

Just as Jerry finished talking, his phone buzzed with an email.

Jerry glanced at it, looking surprised.

Michael noticed and asked, "What's up? What happened?"

Jerry pointed to his phone, grinning. "This email's probably about Joseph. Just came in. Wanna see it?"

"Of course," Michael said, leaning forward to grab Jerry's phone and open the email.

As he read through it, Michael's brow furrowed.

Jerry watched Michael's face change in the rearview mirror, getting curious. He wanted to know what the email said too.

"Eyes on the road. If you wanna know what's in the email, I'll read it to you," Michael said, glaring at Jerry.

Jerry quickly straightened up and focused on driving.

"The email says Joseph and Isabella met when they were eight. Later, Isabella went abroad to study design. That same year, Joseph also went abroad to study. Coincidentally, they were in the same country, and their universities were super close. But according to their roommates, they never seemed to have met," Michael read from the email.

Jerry was shocked. "So much in common, yet they never met?"

Michael grinned. "Guess it means they weren't meant to meet. Isabella's meant for me and me alone!"

Jerry used to dig Michael's bossy vibe, but now that grin of his gave him the creeps.

Of course, Jerry kept his thoughts to himself. He didn't want Michael dumping more work on him. The pay was good, but no time off? Forget it!

'I really need a vacation,' Jerry thought to himself.

At the hospital, Mason was about to get some rest when Charles walked in, looking a bit amused as he recounted Isabella's yacht incident with John.

Mason was taken aback for a moment, then shook his head with a wry smile. "It would be great if Isabella were really my granddaughter."

Mason wasn't too worried about John. If John could be taken down by Isabella that easily, he wasn't worth keeping around.

"Send someone to warn John to stay away from Isabella," Mason said, waving his hand dismissively.

Charles shook his head. "I don't think we need to warn him. According to people on the yacht, Isabella left with a driver-likely arranged by Mr. Williams."

"Michael?" Mason's eyes flickered. He waved his hand, signaling Charles to leave as he wanted to rest.

Meanwhile, Isabella sat in the car after leaving the yacht, still fuming because she really wanted to break John's legs.

Leo, watching Isabella's angry expression in the rearview mirror, couldn't help but smile wryly.

"Ms. Taylor, I know you're really mad, but your safety comes first. You have a husband and friends who care about you," Leo said gently.

Isabella took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. "You're right, Leo. I was just too angry today. But smashing his head did help a lot."

"As long as it helped," Leo said, his mouth twitching slightly.

Soon, Leo brought Isabella back to the company.

"Thanks, Leo. I really appreciate it," Isabella said before getting out of the car. If Leo hadn't grabbed the bat, she might have ended up in the hospital.

"It's nothing, Ms. Taylor. Don't forget, I was a bodyguard before becoming a driver. Compared to those thugs with knives and guns, dealing with a bat is a piece of cake," Leo said with a smile, waving his hand dismissively.

Isabella suddenly remembered that John had thought her husband was a driver. Maybe someone had seen her getting out of Leo's car and told John-that was how it all went wrong.

"Leo, be careful. I'm worried John might try to get back at you," Isabella said, looking at Leo with concern.

Leo smiled and said, "Don't worry, Ms. Taylor. John isn't an idiot. The boss assigned me to you, so I'm kind of his stand-in. John won't cross me unless he wants to break ties with the boss."

Isabella thought about it and agreed with Leo, so she stopped worrying. After their conversation, Isabella went back to the company to finish her work.

Watching Isabella walk away, Leo sighed. "Isabella's a really nice person, and she's got that same kind of charm as Williams. No wonder he fell for her."

###chapter 207 Isabella's Punishment

When Isabella got back to the office, she ran into the ever-annoying Odette and Madeline again.

Odette stepped in front of Isabella. "Isabella, I need your signature on this document. I couldn't find you all morning and heard you left during work hours. As a leader, how can you ignore company rules?"

Odette sneered, raising her voice to make Isabella look bad.

Isabella shot her a cold look. "Hand me the document."

Odette was caught off guard.

Isabella frowned. "Didn't you say you had a document for me to sign? Bring it over."

Odette was kind of embarrassed. She was just messing with Isabella, didn't think she'd actually want to sign anything. But she had a whole bunch of stuff needing Isabella's signature, so she gave her the latest forms.

Isabella barely glanced at them before slamming the papers on the table in front of Odette. "Is this the design your team came up with? The client's requirements were clear. Did you even look at them? Tell Madeline to come to my office."

With that, Isabella walked straight into her office, leaving Odette standing there, stunned.

"That woman is infuriating. How dare she order me around?" Odette muttered, clenching her fists in anger.

Isabella was having a rotten day, and Odette had the bad luck to rub her the wrong way. Their company did packaging design, and Isabella, as director, was in charge of all the projects.

Before, Isabella would calmly walk employees through their mistakes, explaining client requirements and helping them create designs that worked. But with Odette, she didn't bother with kid gloves.

Isabella didn't care whether Odette and Madeline would come to her office as she told them. If they did, Isabella would give them a good talking-to. If they didn't, it would give Isabella more reason to target them.

Isabella remembered the USB drive Odette had used on her computer. It probably had a virus, and she needed to get it back from Odette.

As Isabella tapped her fingers lightly on the desk, a plan quickly formed in her mind.

Meanwhile, Odette found Madeline and recounted her conversation with Isabella.

"That pathetic woman's about to be fired. The nerve of her, ordering me around!" Odette sneered.

Madeline tapped her fingers on the desk. "We have only two days left to execute our plan. It's best not to provoke Isabella in these two days. Let's go to her office."

"What? Why should we give her that respect? Just because she says so, we have to go?" Odette grumbled.

Madeline glared. "Just two more days. What's the big deal? You really want to give her a reason to rat us out to Dwayne before she's gone?"

Hearing this, Odette had no choice but to comply. She stood up and followed Madeline as they headed to Isabella's office.

Isabella was buried in paperwork when she heard a knock on the door. Without looking up, she said, "Come in."

"Isabella, what do you need?" Madeline asked, her tone icy.

Isabella glanced up to see Madeline and Odette standing there. She straightened up, crossed her arms, and asked, "Madeline, remember our bet? The loser has to follow the winner's orders and complete all tasks diligently, right?"

Madeline nodded. "That's right. So, Ms. Taylor, are you unhappy with my work?"

Isabella stood up and pointed to the documents on her desk. "Ms. Eve, while we have personal differences, they shouldn't impact your work! The client wanted a minimalist design. Does this look minimalist to you?"

Madeline frowned. The client wasn't particularly important to her, so she hadn't paid much attention to their requirements and had delegated the task to her team.

Now, it was clear this was a work issue, not a personal one.

Madeline picked up the documents, her expression darkening.

Madeline was skilled in design and could see that the designs were overly complicated, lacking any minimalist style, and looked like a child's scribbles.

Madeline glared at Odette. "Odette, what's going on? How could you make such a basic mistake?"

Odette was embarrassed. Her team had barely looked at the client's product before diving into the design, totally ignoring the extra requirements. She'd never thought Isabella would notice.

"Actually, I thought a minimalist style didn't suit the client's new product, so our team came up with a new theme..." Odette started, but Isabella cut her off.

"Actually, you didn't even bother to look at the client's requirements, did you? Before you came, I asked your team members about the client's needs, and none of them could answer. This level of disregard is unacceptable." Isabella glared coldly at Odette and Madeline.

"Do you think just because the client is a small company, you can ignore them?" Isabella slammed her hand on the desk in anger.

Madeline knew they were at fault this time, so she didn't argue with Isabella.

"This was our oversight. I will take responsibility and personally design what the client needs," Madeline said.

"Of course, it's your responsibility, but what about your team? That kind of attitude? Unacceptable. How can we trust them?"

She then announced, "Ms. Eve, your bonus will be reduced by 20% this month. The rest of the team members will have their bonuses reduced by 10% each."

After Isabella announced the punishment, Madeline and Odette felt a surge of intense anger.

###chapter 208 The Video of the Altercation

Back at Madeline's office, Odette stormed in, slamming a stack of papers on the desk. She stood there, hands on her hips, and yelled, "Isabella, that witch! She deserves to rot in hell! I hope she gets hit by a car the second she steps outside!"

Madeline sat fuming. Isabella's punishment wasn't just targeting her; it was punishing the whole team, especially those loyal to her.

"Enough already! Screaming about her here won't change a damn thing; she can't hear you," Madeline snapped, waving her hand in frustration.

Sure, they messed up, but the punishment felt way too harsh, especially since the deadline hadn't even hit yet.

"Do you think that woman knows she's about to be done for? Is this some kind of final power play?" Odette asked, looking at Madeline.

Madeline shook her head. "If that's the case, then our plan's totally blown."

She tapped the desk lightly, sighing. "Forget it. She's only got two more days to show off. Let's just hang in there and focus on doing our jobs right. No more rookie mistakes. Once I become the director, all our penalties will be wiped clean."

Odette finally let out a sigh of relief and left the office.

Meanwhile, Juliet knocked on Isabella's office door and walked in.

"Ms. Taylor, you were amazing. I just walked past Madeline's office-her team looked utterly crushed," Juliet said with a big smile.

Madeline's team always bullied the newbies, thinking they were untouchable. Juliet and her peers were sick of it.

Isabella waved her hand dismissively. "It's nothing, just a warning. But this isn't over. In a few days, they'll regret it."

Juliet wanted to ask what Isabella had planned for Madeline, but Isabella cut her off.

Isabella smiled at Juliet with her hands behind her back. "It's a secret! Just wait for the big reveal."

Juliet nodded and handed the documents to Isabella. "Ms. Taylor, don't we already have enough designers? Why are you looking for more?"

Isabella had asked Juliet to gather info on top designers from various companies. Her plan was to counter Madeline. She figured if her plan worked, a bunch of designers in the company would quit, and they'd need new hires to fill the gaps.

As for who would take over as director after Isabella left, she trusted Dwayne would handle that.

Initially, Isabella had high hopes for Madeline, but Madeline's jealousy and her slack attitude with her team made her a terrible fit for leadership.

As Isabella was going through the documents, her phone rang. It was Dwayne.

"Hey, Mr. Larson. What's up? Something wrong?" Isabella asked, curious.

On the other end, Dwayne said, "Can you come to my office? I need to talk to you about a few things."

Isabella hung up and headed over to Dwayne's office.

Dwayne was watching a video on his phone, looking pretty frustrated.

Just then, there was a knock on the door, and Isabella walked in.

"What's going on, Mr. Larson? Did the organizers send over the competition entry?" Isabella asked, curious.

Dwayne nodded and handed her a freshly printed piece of paper from his desk.

"This is what they sent me-your entry," Dwayne said with a hint of a mocking smile.

Isabella looked at the design on the paper and smiled. The style was definitely Madeline's-bold and extravagant, but still layered and not chaotic.

"Looks like you were right. They used your name. But how did they pull it off? Without proof, they won't admit it," Dwayne said, tapping his fingers on the desk.

"I've got a video here that might interest you," Isabella said, opening a video on her phone and handing it over.

"Funny, I have a video for you too," Dwayne said with a smile, handing over his phone.

They swapped phones and watched each other's videos.

After watching, Isabella was a bit surprised, while Dwayne looked really grim.

"Was it Odette? The USB drive she plugged into your computer must have had a Trojan virus, right?" Dwayne asked, his face stern.

Isabella nodded and took back her phone.

"I thought you'd ask why I secretly installed a camera in the office," Isabella joked with a smile.

Dwayne snorted and waved his hand. "You must have had your reasons. I actually thought about putting cameras in every office area, but I was worried about privacy issues. But now it seems cameras can be pretty handy."

Isabella placed Dwayne's phone back on the desk.

The video Dwayne sent was of Isabella's altercation with John on the yacht.

Isabella was shocked that someone had the guts to film and share it online. That video showed John totally humiliated. Didn't they worry he'd get revenge?

"What do you think about this video?" Dwayne asked.

"Not much. John pissed Mason off so bad he ended up in the hospital. Mason's always been good to me, so it's only fair I taught John a lesson. People won't blame me. Besides, I've heard it all before-I don't care what they think," Isabella smiled with a shrug.

###chapter 209 Dwayne's Cooperation

Dwayne looked at Isabella's confident smile and shook his head with a chuckle. "I'm not talking about the yacht incident; I'm talking about Odette. Whoever filmed that video and put it online has to be from one of the top families-they wouldn't be scared of John. It's obviously a power play. With Mason having your back, you don't need to worry about John coming after you."

Realizing her mistake, Isabella smiled but then quickly turned serious. "The priority now is to get that USB drive from Odette, proving she planted a Trojan virus on my computer. I have a plan to deal with her, but I might need your help."

Dwayne raised an eyebrow. "Can you tell me your plan?"

Isabella's lips curled into a smile. "Of course."

That evening, when Isabella got home from work, Michael had already prepared dinner.

"What did my dear husband make for dinner today?" Isabella eagerly put down her bag and approached the dining table.

"Oh, my favorite, corn truffle soup!" Isabella exclaimed and quickly served herself a bowl, savoring the aroma.

Michael, sitting on the sofa watching a video on his phone, looked up and smiled at Isabella. "You know, washing your hands before eating can lower your chances of getting sick."

Isabella rolled her eyes. "I'm using utensils. As long as your food is clean, I won't get sick."

Despite her words, she put down her utensils and went to wash her hands.

"What's got you so glued?" Isabella asked curiously as she dried her hands and walked over to Michael.

When Isabella saw the video on Michael's phone, her face turned slightly red.

Michael wasn't watching anything inappropriate; it was the video of Isabella hitting John on the yacht.

What embarrassed Isabella was that the video had been edited by netizens, adding special effects to the wine bottle in her hand and the baseball bat in John's hand, making it look like a wizard duel.

"I have different versions, like a Tom and Jerry version and a SpongeBob version. Want to see them?" Michael teased, kissing Isabella on the cheek.

Isabella rolled her eyes, grabbed his phone, and exited the video. "You're so childish!"

Michael laughed, jumped off the sofa, and hugged Isabella around the waist. They walked to the dining table together, ready to eat.

"Honey, that was awesome! The way you smashed that bottle... I'm falling for you even harder!" Michael praised her candidly.

Isabella blushed again. "If you ever cheat on me, what happened to John today will happen to you in the future!"

Michael quickly covered his head, feigning a hurt expression. "Honey, I don't have a head as hard as John's! Besides, would you really want to ruin this face?"

Isabella looked at Michael's handsome face and rolled her eyes, but a smile soon played on her lips. "Honey, you should know I love not just your face but also your soul! But if your soul betrays me, then that face of yours will mean nothing to me. And it won't just be your face that pays the price."

Isabella smiled as she sliced through a sausage on her plate. As the knife cut through, the sausage burst open, releasing a spray of red juices.

Michael instinctively squeezed his legs together, a look of discomfort crossing his face. "Honey, please believe me, I am completely faithful to you."

Isabella nodded, picking up the sliced sausage with her fork and holding it up to Michael's mouth. "Here, love, let me feed you."

Michael opened his mouth and bit into the sausage.

As Isabella was about to take a bite of her own food, her eyes caught a marked date on the wall calendar.

"Why did you circle a date on the calendar? Does it have any special meaning?" Isabella asked curiously, pointing at the calendar.

Michael's lips curled into a mischievous smile. "That date marks the end of this week and the start of a new one."

Isabella's face turned red instantly as she knew what Michael meant. Feeling a bit annoyed, she kicked him lightly under the table.

Michael didn't dodge and gave her a silly grin.

Isabella rolled her eyes and told Michael about the plan she had discussed with Dwayne to deal with Odette.

After hearing the plan, Michael nodded. "So you're planning to use Mr. Hamilton? Do you need me to call him?"

Isabella shook her head. "We exchanged contact information last time. Mrs. Hamilton knows I can paint and has been inviting me to do a portrait for her. This is a perfect opportunity."

Knowing Isabella had her plans, Michael didn't say much more.

After dinner, Isabella also circled a date on the calendar.

"What does your marked date mean?" Michael asked, hugging Isabella around the waist.

Isabella's lips curled into a mischievous smile. "Honey, I just realized something."

"What is it?" Michael suddenly felt a sense of foreboding.

Isabella turned and hugged Michael's neck, smiling. "The date you circled is the first day of my period! The date I circled is when it ends!"

Michael's eyes widened, and he quickly did the math in his head. To his dismay, Isabella was right.

"No, this can't be happening. Oh my God, I have to wait another week!" Michael clenched his fists in frustration.

Isabella took his hand and placed it on her chest. "Alright, dear, I know you're anxious, but you've already waited this long. What's one more week? Besides, there's something else we need to do when my period ends."

Michael took a few deep breaths to calm himself and looked at Isabella curiously. "What else do we have to do? Wait, I remember now-it's the day your parents get out of the detention center!"

###chapter 210 Negotiation between Bianca and Jasper

Michael and Isabella had finalized their plan to snag the Taylor family's company shares.

The plan was set to roll out the day Jasper and Mia got out of the detention center.

But Isabella had no clue someone else was eyeing those shares too.

John drove Bianca to the detention center himself.

"We're here. Let's get out," John said, giving Bianca a gentle pat on the head with a warm smile.

After leaving the yacht, Bianca and John headed back to their room. While Bianca was tending to John's injuries, she brought up Isabella.

"I'm not like Isabella, who gets all the love from your grandpa. I need to do something big to get his attention," Bianca suddenly said to John.

John looked up at her, surprised. "What are you planning to do?"

"I'm going to become the head of the Taylor Family!" Bianca said, dead serious.

"My family may be shattered, but its past glory and some of its bonds remain. If I can take control of the remaining three companies, I can become the head of the family. With your help, I'll beat Jasper, hands down. And after we've grown the business, we'll get married. Your grandpa and dad will be on board by then, right?" Bianca asked, locking eyes with John.

John met her gaze, thinking it over. Finally, he nodded, agreeing with her plan. It did seem like a solid strategy.

"You're right. I don't know what Mason's thinking, but even if he still doesn't like us being together, I can give up the family inheritance. With you and your companies, I've got a great start to build something new. I believe I can make your family even bigger and better than the Williams Family!" John said, a confident smile spreading across his face.

John had every reason to be confident. His business skills were way better than his dad, Owen's. That was why Mason had raised him so closely.

"Thank you, my dear!" Bianca hugged John tightly, burying her face in his chest.

John gently stroked her hair.

If Isabella or Mason had overheard their conversation, they would have been blown away. John was a business whiz, but when it came to women, he was totally clueless!

After finalizing their plan, John and Bianca went to the detention center to get Jasper to hand over the family shares.

As the heir to the Williams Family, John had certain perks. Unlike Isabella, who had to apply to visit Jasper in detention, John could see him anytime with just a phone call.

"Mr. Williams, Jasper is inside. We only allow one visitor normally, but given who you are... you're both good to go. I'll be just outside; let me know if you need anything," the detention center official said respectfully to John.

John gave a quick nod and waved his hand, signaling the official to stand guard outside.

When John and Bianca stepped into the interrogation room, they found Jasper already seated, waiting for them.

"Well, look who it is. My dear niece and her future husband," Jasper sneered, clearly unaware of Mason's recent public statement.

"Mr. Williams, you saw what Isabella showed us, right? So, you still think your little girlfriend's some angel?" Jasper's tone was dripping with sarcasm as he eyed John.

Jasper had already made up his mind. Once he was out of the detention center, he planned to leave the country and live a life of luxury abroad. He had nothing to lose and no reason to hold back.

John's expression stayed cold, while Bianca wore a faint smile.

"Jasper, you should know that in a powerful family, no one can afford to be purely good," Bianca said with a calm smile, cutting straight to the point.

Bianca hadn't forgotten that she had previously blamed everything on Jasper and Mia. She was worried that Jasper might say too much and expose her lies.

"So you want my shares too? Why is everyone after my shares?" Jasper looked at Bianca with some surprise.

Bianca was puzzled. "What do you mean, Jasper? Has someone else asked you for the shares?"

Jasper crossed his arms and sneered. "Isabella came to me a few days ago, also wanting the shares! She gave me some unrealistic promise, saying she could lead the family to greatness with her talent. So, are you going to make the same promise?"

Jasper then shifted his gaze from Bianca to John. "Well, with Mr. Williams on your side, the sky's the limit, huh?"

Bianca met Jasper's stare, her voice steady. "Now you should believe that I can bring the family business back. I think we both know I'm the better choice here. So, will you transfer your shares to me?"

Jasper crossed his arms, his eyes darting around. "I originally thought those three nearly bankrupt companies weren't worth much, but since you all want them so badly, why not buy them? That's what Isabella suggested too."

John's face twisted into a contemptuous smile. "How much did she offer? Whatever her price, I can pay ten times that amount."

Jasper's face lit up with joy, but his smile quickly froze.

He suddenly remembered that Isabella had uncovered his embezzlement. If John and Bianca announced they had inherited the family companies, Isabella might hand over the evidence to the court in a fit of anger. The court would then seize his assets and throw him back in prison.

'Damn it! I can't sell my shares now. I need to wait until I'm out and in a safe place before I deal with John!' Jasper thought, gritting his teeth.

###chapter 211 Implementation of the Plan

John noticed Jasper's silence and the sour look on his face, which really ticked him off.

"Jasper, you should know your company's pretty much worthless now. Getting some cash to live the good life is your best bet," John said, glaring at Jasper.

Jasper sighed internally. He knew John was right, but now just wasn't the time.

"Give me a few days to think it over, at least until I'm out of this detention center," Jasper finally said.

John got even more irritated, but Bianca tugged at his sleeve and shook her head.

John snorted and stormed out of the detention center with Bianca.

With the detention center official respectfully seeing them off, John and Bianca hopped into the car.

"Didn't think Isabella would want the family shares too. Looks like I've got some competition," Bianca said, glancing at John with a smirk.

John sneered. "Isabella? Where's she gonna get the money to buy the shares? From her ghost of a husband? No way! She'll just have to watch as you become the new family heir."

Bianca's smile widened. "Isabella's already cut ties with her parents, so her claim's gone. I'm way luckier to have you on my side!"

Bianca's hand rested gently on John's thigh. The simple touch sparked a sudden, intense feeling within him.

"How are you feeling? Any pain left?" John leaned in closer, his hand finding its place on her thigh.

Bianca blushed and whispered, "It barely hurts anymore. I'm almost all better. We can head back to the room... or, if you can't wait, right here."

John's breathing quickened, but he managed to keep his desire in check. "Let's head back to the room. I'd rather not end up on the internet as 'that couple in the car.'"

He flashed a mischievous grin and quickly started the car, driving towards the nearest hotel.

Meanwhile, Isabella had already lined up Kevin and Gabrielle for the portrait painting the next day. She texted Dwayne after she'd made all the arrangements.

Dwayne quickly replied to Isabella.

The next day, as soon as Odette and Madeline arrived at the company, Dwayne called them over.

"Isabella is on leave today, so I have an important task for you," Dwayne said, placing a file in front of Madeline.

"That woman takes leave all the time and still gets to be a director?" Odette muttered under her breath.

"What did you say?" Dwayne frowned at Odette. Her voice had been too low for him to hear clearly.

"I said we will definitely complete this task diligently," Odette replied with a polite, fake smile.

She hadn't forgotten that Madeline's previous assistant had been sent to Evernia for gossiping in the office.

Madeline frowned as she read the task details. "That's a long way to go, and I have other tasks to complete."

Dwayne leaned back in his chair and said calmly, "If you're feeling swamped, you can pass this task to one of your team members. It's important, but not particularly tough. The main hassle is all the running around. But the reward for finishing it is pretty sweet."

Odette's eyes lit up. She had just lost 10% of her bonus thanks to Isabella yesterday and was stressing about money. A good reward now meant she could finally splurge on those fancy designer accessories and handbags she'd been eyeing.

"Okay, I get it," Madeline nodded. Since she could delegate the task, it wouldn't be too hard for her.

Madeline had just stepped out of Dwayne's office with the file when Odette immediately grabbed her hand.

"Ms. Eve, please, let me handle this task," Odette said eagerly.

Madeline handed the file to Odette without a second thought. "Alright, if you want to do it, go ahead. Just be careful and don't give Isabella any reason to catch you out."

Odette nodded and quickly started flipping through the file.

After Madeline and Odette left, Dwayne picked up his phone and typed a message to Isabella.

Isabella replied quickly.

'Madeline, we've given you so many chances. Why don't you appreciate them?' Dwayne thought, shaking his head in resignation, though his eyes were cold.

Meanwhile, Odette, having received the task details, immediately drove to the assigned locations. The task was to poach talent from other design companies!

Odette had jumped at this mission-not just for the payday, but to help Madeline build a stronger team. If she could bring in top talent under Madeline's leadership, they could take control from Isabella, even if Isabella used her connections to stay.

Odette enthusiastically engaged with each designer. After contracting the third designer, she arrived at a nearby hotel where they were supposed to meet.

"Damn it, where is he? This guy is so unreliable," Odette muttered, glancing at her watch. The designer was already five minutes late.

Just as she was about to make another call to check on his whereabouts, her eyes caught sight of a man and a woman walking into the hotel.

Odette quickly hid behind a nearby potted plant, watching the familiar faces cautiously.

It was Isabella and Kevin, walking and laughing together, looking very close.

Odette's hands trembled with excitement. She'd told Madeline about this before, hoping to use it against Isabella, but Madeline had dismissed it for lack of evidence. Now, with the evidence right in front of her, she wouldn't let this opportunity slip.

Odette immediately took out her phone, silenced it, and began frantically taking photos of Isabella and Kevin.

###chapter 212 Caught Peeping

As Isabella and Kevin waited for the elevator, Isabella couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her. She glanced around cautiously.

"What's up, Isabella?" Kevin asked, noticing her unease.

Isabella shrugged. "I don't know, maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I keep feeling like someone's got their eyes on me."

Kevin looked around too but didn't see anything out of the ordinary.

"Probably just some random person who couldn't help but stare. I mean, come on, Isabella, you're a knockout," Kevin said with a grin.

Isabella playfully tapped Kevin's arm. "Oh, Mr. Hamilton, you flatter me! But you're right. If this were a fairy tale, the magic mirror would definitely say I'm the fairest. Snow White would have to settle for second!"

Kevin chuckled. "Haha, Ms. Taylor, you've got quite the sense of humor."

Just then, the elevator doors opened, and they stepped inside, still smiling.

As the doors closed, Odette peeked out from behind a potted plant.

"I've got it all on camera, Isabella. Let's see you wiggle out of this one," Odette muttered, but her smirk quickly faded.

'No, just catching them entering the hotel isn't enough. They could just say they booked separate rooms or were talking business. I need more solid proof!' Odette thought, her brows knitting together as she watched the elevator numbers climb to the 27th floor. She was sure Isabella and Kevin were staying there.

Odette pondered for a moment, then hurried to the hotel lobby.

"Hi, I'm from Luminous Beauty. We're planning a company event here, and I noticed your 27th floor looks perfect for us. We'd like to book the whole floor. Is it currently occupied?" Odette asked the receptionist.

The receptionist checked the computer and apologized. "I'm sorry, ma'am, but one room on the 27th floor is occupied. However, the 29th floor is available if you'd like..."

The receptionist tried to persuade Odette to switch floors, but she shook her head firmly.

"I picked the 27th floor because it's our boss's lucky number today! How about this: give me the room number of the guest, and I'll talk to them about switching rooms," Odette suggested.

The receptionist shook his head. "I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can't disclose the room number of our guests."

Odette's eyes narrowed slightly. She had expected this and had a backup plan ready.

Odette smiled and said, "Alright, how about you give that guest a call and ask them to come down? I can talk to them personally."

The receptionist hesitated, then nodded. "I can do that. Please wait a moment."

As the receptionist dialed the room, Odette excused herself to the restroom and hid nearby.

When Kevin stepped out of the room, Odette quickly took the elevator up to the 27th floor.

She waited patiently and saw Kevin return to the room, looking annoyed. She made a mental note of the room number.

Kevin walked back in, still frowning. "Someone wanted to book the whole floor and asked to trade rooms with me, but when I arrived, they'd vanished. Strange."

Inside, Gabrielle was striking a pose while Isabella painted.

Isabella chuckled as she worked. "Maybe they had to leave in a hurry."

Gabrielle nodded in agreement.

Kevin moved behind Isabella, admiring the painting taking shape. "This is incredible, Isabella. Your skills are top-notch!"

Isabella blushed. "Mr. Hamilton, don't flatter me too much. I'll get shy. I'm not Leonardo da Vinci. I haven't even tried to paint the Mona Lisa... yet."

Gabrielle burst into laughter at Isabella's 'modesty.' "Oh, Isabella, that was hilarious! Give me a minute to catch my breath before you continue painting."

Isabella smiled and shook her head. "It's fine. I've got your pose memorized. Just don't move too far, and I can make it work."

As she painted, Isabella thought, 'That call earlier was probably Odette. She knows I'm in the same room as Mr. Hamilton. Time to move to the next phase of the plan.'

"Mr. Hamilton, excuse me for a moment. I need to use the restroom." Isabella stood up and walked to the bathroom, sending a quick message.

Soon, two police officers entered the hotel.

"We received a report about a possible peeping tom. The suspect is a short-haired woman. We're here to investigate," one officer said to the receptionist.

The receptionist thought for a moment and immediately remembered Odette. Her actions were peculiar: she had tried to reserve the entire floor, only to disappear upon the guest's arrival.

To verify, the receptionist called Luminous Beauty and found out there was no event planned.

"I'll take you to the surveillance room. Follow me," the receptionist said, realizing he'd been duped. He quickly led the officers to the surveillance room, where they soon spotted Odette on the 27th floor.

Odette was still using her phone to secretly snap pictures of Kevin's room door.

'How can I get inside and take more pictures? Maybe I can pretend to be room service,' she thought.

Then she had a brilliant idea: steal a staff uniform, wear a mask, and disguise herself as room service. If they hadn't ordered anything, she could say it was complimentary from the hotel.

Just as Odette stood up to put her plan into action, two burly police officers appeared in front of her.

###chapter 213 Odette's Despair

Odette's plan went down the drain before it even got started. The receptionist recognized her, and the cops took her phone.

When the police figured out what Odette was secretly snapping pics of, they headed straight for Kevin's door.

Kevin answered, looking confused at the two officers. "Uh, is there a problem, officers?"

One of the cops pointed at Odette, who they had in custody, and her confiscated phone. "Sir, we got a report that this woman was secretly taking photos of hotel guests. We found pictures of you on her phone."

"Taking pictures of me?" Kevin's face registered shock, then anger. He, like most people, resented being photographed without consent.

Odette's fists clenched, her face pale. She knew she was busted, but she still hoped to expose an affair between Isabella and Kevin. If she could prove that, they wouldn't dare make a big deal out of this.

Just then, Isabella stepped out of the room. "What's going on, Mr. Hamilton Odette, what are you doing here?"

Isabella looked at Odette, confused.

Odette sneered at Isabella. "Ms. Taylor, you finally slipped up! Didn't you claim to be so loyal to your husband? Why are you sneaking around with Mr. Hamilton in a hotel? I've got the evidence now. This is how you beat Ms. Eve last time, isn't it?"

Isabella's face darkened instantly. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

As Odette basked in her supposed victory, another woman's voice came from inside the room.

"What's happening, darling? Isabella, what's going on?" Gabrielle stepped out, looking concerned.

Odette's eyes went wide. "Wait, are you three having a threesome?"

Kevin's face twisted with anger. If the cops weren't there, he might have given Odette a piece of his mind.

Kevin stepped aside and spoke loudly, "Ms. Taylor is here to paint a portrait of my wife! If you don't believe me, you can check the room with these officers."

"No way they were doing just portrait painting! This can't be real!" Odette's face turned ashen. If Kevin was telling the truth, she was done for.

Odette rushed into the room, and the two officers followed her, frowning.

The room was spotless, with a painting easel set up in the bedroom. The painting was already halfway done, clearly showing Gabrielle.

"It's over. It really was just potrait painting." Odette trembled, collapsing to the floor.

Isabella walked in, her expression icy. She addressed the two officers, "Ms. Davis is my subordinate. Officers, please take her to the station. I'll be there shortly."

The officers nodded and dragged Odette out.

After the police and Odette left, Isabella looked at Kevin and Gabrielle apologetically.

"I'm really sorry, Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Hamilton. I didn't see this coming," Isabella said, full of regret.

Gabrielle squeezed Isabella's hand and smiled. "Isabella, you're not to blame," she said sympathetically. "Kevin told me about the problems in your department. This isn't just your fault."

Kevin nodded. "I'll talk to your boss about this. I'm sure he'll give me a satisfactory explanation."

Isabella still looked apologetic. She had indeed used Kevin and Gabrielle to some extent.

"Let's not dwell on this. Let's finish the painting," Isabella said, pulling Gabrielle with a smile.

After wrapping up Gabrielle's portrait, it was already late afternoon.

Isabella headed straight to the police station to see Odette.

"Odette, do you understand the gravity of your actions? Taking clandestine photographs of the company's most crucial client-do you think the boss will let you off?" Isabella asked coldly, sitting across from Odette.

Odette lifted her head, glaring at Isabella with pure hatred. She knew she was finished. Even if Madeline wanted to protect her, she had no power against the boss.

"We were so close, just one step away from success. Damn it, why did I have to rush?" Odette muttered to herself.

Isabella sat quietly, waiting for her to calm down before asking with a cold smile, "What are you muttering about? Why don't you share it with me?"

Odette's eyes were icy as she stared back at Isabella. She knew she was completely done for, but she believed Madeline wouldn't abandon her. At the very least, once she was out of detention, Madeline would find her a new job or maybe even give her some money.

"You should go to hell, you bitch!" Odette spat coldly.

Isabella crossed her arms and mocked, "That's not what you were muttering earlier, was it? Let me guess-you and Madeline planned to accuse me of plagiarism after tomorrow's competition results are released?"

Odette's eyes widened, her pupils contracting. She was clearly shaken.

"How did you know?" Odette asked, her hands trembling. Her first thought was that there was a traitor in their midst, but only she and Madeline knew the plan. Could Madeline have betrayed her?

Isabella looked at Odette coldly. "You were wrong from the start. Did you really think I would enter that competition? I've been too busy lately to participate in such a trivial contest. I never even signed up, and Mr. Larson knows that."

"You didn't sign up? For such an important design competition?" Odette screamed. If Isabella was telling the truth, they had been fools from the beginning.

Isabella looked at Odette with pity. "So when I found out I won first place, I knew it was a trap. Don't judge me by your standards. I'm different from you-I don't care about fame and fortune!"

###chapter 214 Odette's Compromise

Isabella's words hit Odette like a ton of bricks.

Odette slumped back in her chair, muttering, "So we were doomed from the start."

Everyone thought Isabella would join the competition, but that assumption turned out to be their downfall.

Odette took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. "You say you didn't enter, but how can you prove it? And why should we care if you did or didn't?"

Odette shot a cold glare at Isabella, determined to protect Madeline. As long as Madeline ditched the plan right away, Isabella wouldn't have any dirt on her. Worst case, Isabella would win a prize, which would suck but wouldn't get her fired.

"Think I don't have proof?" Isabella suddenly grinned.

Panic washed over Odette.

"Mr. Larson got your submission, under my name, from the organizers. It's clearly Madeline's style," Isabella smirked.

Odette relaxed a bit. "Design style alone isn't proof."

But then Isabella pulled out her phone and played a video.

"What about this?" Isabella pushed the phone toward Odette.

Odette's face went pale as she watched the footage. It showed her sneaking around on Isabella's computer.

"You know, a lot of people want to take me down, so I had to take some precautions, like installing a camera in my office." Isabella shrugged, her smile mocking.

"My computer had a Trojan virus that stole my username. You and Madeline must've used that virus to publish the work under my name, right?" Isabella pulled out a clear evidence bag.

Inside was a USB drive, the one the cops had found on Odette. It was the same USB drive shown in the video.

"I had the police check out the USB drive. It's confirmed to be a virus. They also checked my computer and found traces of the virus. Now all the evidence points to you, Odette. How many years do you think you'll get?" Isabella leaned forward, fingers interlaced on the table.

In psychology, this posture creates a sense of pressure. Isabella used it to break down Odette's fragile nerves.

"You know how scary our boss can be. You secretly photographed and pissed off his client. On top of that, you framed me. How much longer do you think your sentence will be? Or which awful prison do you think you'll end up in?" Isabella's smile was ice-cold.

Odette's body shook violently, and she finally broke down. Unable to handle the pressure, she begged Isabella for mercy.

Odette cried and pleaded, "I'm sorry, I was wrong. Please, forgive me. I won't do it again. I'm sorry."

Isabella looked at Odette with indifference. "You're even worse than Madeline's last assistant. A complete idiot. If you want me to let you go, you need to offer something valuable."

Isabella leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms, waiting for Odette to make up her mind.

Odette clenched her fists, her eyes full of conflict. She knew what Isabella wanted-to betray Madeline.

"You better think hard. Remember what happened to the last person who stayed loyal to Madeline? Madeline has no connections; she can't protect you." Isabella's mocking smile grew wider.

Isabella's words completely broke down Odette's defenses.

'That's right. Madeline can't save me. I'm the only one who can,' Odette thought, a ruthless glint in her eyes.

Odette suddenly looked up at Isabella. "If I testify against Madeline, will you let me go?"

Isabella scoffed. "I can handle her without your testimony. I need valuable info, not just a witness statement. If you can't give me something useful, get ready for prison."

Isabella stood up and headed for the door.

"Wait a minute, I've got something! Don't you find it suspicious that Madeline won first place in a national design competition, even with her skills?" Odette exclaimed.

Isabella paused. She realized she'd overlooked a key point. Then again, she hadn't seen the other entries, so comparing them to Madeline's work was impossible.

Isabella turned around, looking at Odette. "Now you've got my attention."

Isabella sat back down, and Odette let out a sigh of relief.

"Honestly, there's no way Madeline could have won legitimately. She bribed the judges! I have proof," Odette declared.

Isabella looked at Odette, intrigued. "Madeline has no connections. Even if she had money, why would they agree?"

Odette quickly added, "What if Bianca was involved? Don't forget, your dear cousin has a pretty influential boyfriend."

Isabella was stunned. She hadn't expected Bianca to be involved. If that was true, it all made sense.

Through John's connections, Bianca could reach the competition organizers and set up a deal for Madeline, in order to get Isabella out of the company.

"So that's it. Now that I think about it, your tactics seem familiar. Isn't this the same trick Bianca used to plagiarize my work last time?" Isabella shook her head, a disdainful smirk on her lips.

"Now that I've told you everything, will you let me go?" Odette asked, her eyes filled with hope.

Isabella nodded. "Hand over all the evidence you have, testify as a witness, and I'll drop my charges. Your sentence will be significantly reduced."

Odette's face lit up with excitement as she nodded eagerly. "Okay, I'll tell you where the evidence is right now."

###chapter 215 Madeline's Doomsday

The next day, Madeline was on edge, pacing around her office.

'What's going on? Why can't I get ahold of Odette?' she thought, her worry growing by the minute.

Since Odette left yesterday, Madeline hadn't heard a peep from her. Her phone was off, like she had vanished into thin air.

Madeline checked her watch. The competition results were about to be announced. Their plan was about to go down.

Just then, her phone rang. It was Bianca.

"How's everything going?" Bianca asked.

Madeline took a deep breath. "Everything's set. The reporters are ready. As soon as they announce Isabella as the winner, the reporters will swarm her. Then, I'll step in and accuse her of plagiarism. But..."

Madeline trailed off.

Bianca, who had been pleased with the update, caught the hesitation in her voice.

"What's the problem? Are you getting cold feet? Remember everything you've sacrificed to get rid of Isabella? Remember how sickening that old man was?" Bianca's words made Madeline's stomach churn.

Madeline's fists tightened, a flash of humiliation in her eyes. She had sacrificed not just money, but her dignity to bring Isabella down.

"That's enough. I'm in too deep to back out now. What's bothering me is that my assistant has been missing since yesterday," Madeline said, her concern evident.

Bianca was quiet for a moment. She knew about Odette and that she was in on all of Madeline's plans.

"Do you think your assistant would betray you?" Bianca asked.

Madeline shook her head. "She has no reason to."

Bianca let out a sigh of relief. "Then what's the big deal? Maybe she's just caught up in something or had an accident. Either way, a missing person is the cops' problem, not yours. Focus on the task at hand."

Madeline clenched her fists and gave a reluctant nod. She figured she'd deal with the Odette mess later. Today was all about taking Isabella down.

After a few more words with Bianca, Madeline hung up.

She stood by the window, watching Isabella step out of her car, smiling and completely unaware of what was coming.

Madeline's lips curled into a sneer. "Enjoy your last moments of happiness; today is your downfall."

When Isabella walked into the company, her colleagues were unusually enthusiastic, showering her with congratulations.

"Ms. Taylor, wow! You won first place?! That's awesome!"

"Ms. Taylor, you're incredible! I'm so inspired by you!"

"You're officially my hero!"

"Ms. Taylor, you're gorgeous and incredibly talented!"

Isabella accepted the congratulations with a faint smile.

Just then, Madeline stepped out of her office and joined in. "Congrats, Ms. Taylor, on winning first place again!"

Madeline then motioned towards the door, and a flood of reporters poured in.

"Ms. Taylor, how does it feel to win the most prestigious design award in the country?"

"Ms. Taylor, do you have any words for the competitors you beat?"

"Ms. Taylor, some contestants think you didn't deserve to win first place. What's your take on that?"

The last question was pretty sharp, but Isabella just smiled and didn't say a word.

Madeline, sensing something was off, frowned. "Ms. Taylor, why aren't you answering? It's kind of rude to the reporters, don't you think?"

"Rude? I wasn't even in the competition! What's with all the questions? I'm clueless about this," Isabella said, looking at Madeline with a sudden smile.

Madeline was stunned, and the room went dead silent. You could hear a pin drop.

"What does she mean? Ms. Taylor says she didn't enter the competition. Then how did she win first place?" someone asked, clearly puzzled.

"That's a question for Ms. Eve," Dwayne said coldly, stepping out of his office with a file in hand.

"Isabella didn't enter this competition. Someone used her username to submit a design. Madeline, can you explain why Isabella's design looks so much like yours?" Dwayne laid out two design sketches, and the reporters went wild, snapping photos.

"Isabella must have stolen my design. She entered, I know she did! She's lying to those reporters!" Madeline blurted out, panic creeping into her voice.

Isabella stayed calm, her eyes locked on Madeline. "How long are you going to keep this up? You had Odette sneak into my office and plant a Trojan virus on my computer to submit the design in my name. You've been waiting for this moment to accuse me of plagiarism, weren't you?"

Madeline's face went pale, and she took a step back, a terrible thought crossing her mind: Odette had betrayed her.

The reporters smelled a big story and started snapping photos like crazy.

Isabella sighed and pulled out her phone. "Madeline, I gave you chances. But you kept throwing them away, driven by your jealousy."

She played a surveillance video from her office, clearly showing Odette inserting a USB drive into her computer and messing with it.

"If you think this isn't enough, let's hear from Odette herself," Isabella said, looking towards the door.

Two police officers walked in, escorting a handcuffed Odette.

The moment Madeline saw Odette, she felt dizzy and collapsed onto the floor.

Odette bit her lip, avoiding Madeline's gaze. With her eyes closed, she confessed, "It was all Madeline's doing. She told me to plant the virus on Isabella's computer. And Madeline conspired with Bianca; they bribed the competition judges to secure the first place."

###chapter 216 The Crazy Madeline 

Odette's words hit like a bombshell, stirring up chaos in the room.

Everyone turned to Madeline, their faces full of shock.

Madeline's hands shook as she pointed at Odette, "Why are you doing this? Why are you betraying me?"

Odette shut her eyes, unable to face Madeline or answer her.

Isabella smirked, looking at Odette. "Odette, are you ready to back up your claims legally? You say Madeline and Bianca bribed the judges. Got any proof?"

Odette took a deep breath and nodded. When she opened her eyes, they were filled with determination instead of guilt.

"Don't say it. Please, don't say it," Madeline begged Odette.

Odette stared coldly at Madeline and pointed at her computer. "Madeline bribed the judge, Tony, with sex. She recorded it to make sure he wouldn't back out. The video is on her computer."

With that, Odette headed for Madeline's computer.

"You have no right to touch my computer, you bitch!" Madeline screamed, lunging at Odette and grabbing at her clothes and hair.

Odette shoved her away hard.

Odette knew Madeline couldn't save her. Her only chance was to betray Madeline and save her own skin.

Madeline, now on the floor, tried to get up, but Isabella held her down by the shoulders.

"Madeline, if Odette's lying, why won't you let her look at your computer? Something to hide?" Isabella sneered.

"No, please, Ms. Taylor, I'm sorry. I know I was wrong. Please, don't release that video. I'm begging you!" Madeline pleaded, her face pale.

Isabella leaned down and whispered in her ear, "You're not sorry for what you did; you're just sorry you got caught."

Isabella then stood up and looked at Madeline coldly.

By now, Odette had found the video on Madeline's computer.

The reporters turned their cameras to the screen, sensing a big story.

"No, don't play it, please, Odette, don't play it!" Madeline screamed, trying to get up. But two security guards quickly restrained her.

With a final click, Odette played the video.

The room filled with the sounds of a woman's moans and a man's lewd comments.

Tony Gibson: "Who would've thought, Ms. Eve? You always seem so cold, but in bed, you're quite the wild one."

Madeline: "Mr. Gibson, do you like how I am now? Can you give me first place?"

Tony: "Ms. Eve, whether you get first place depends on how you perform in this bed. Oh my, you're amazing. I love this position."

The explicit sounds and dialogue made even the adults in the room blush.

Madeline's face went pale, as if all the blood had drained from her. She sat on the floor in a daze, letting everyone watch her disgrace.

The reporters snapped away, capturing every juicy detail. Finally, Isabella stepped up and shut the laptop.

"These should be enough," Isabella said coolly to the reporters. "I hope you all keep the explicit parts out of your reports."

"Sure thing, Ms. Taylor. We'll blur out the sensitive stuff," one reporter replied with a smirk.

No one felt bad for Madeline. You don't get sympathy for hurting people.

"This is all your doing, isn't it? You planned everything! You knew, so you made Odette betray me, didn't you?" Madeline glared at Isabella, her eyes wild.

Isabella met her gaze with a calm, indifferent look. "I gave you chance after chance. You always dismissed me, saying I only got where I am because of my family. But my talent's obvious to everyone else. You're just insecure, aren't you?"

"You're lying! I'm not insecure. I have great talent; why would I be insecure? It's you who should be insecure. You sit in high positions without real skill, blocking the path for people like me. I just lack the connections. If I had a background, with my talent, I could easily be at the top!" Madeline stood up, pointing at Isabella, her voice rising to a hysterical scream.

"You damn bitch! You and you!" Madeline pointed at Isabella, Odette, and even Dwayne.

"You, as our leader, never paid attention to me. You've always favored Isabella, just because the boss told you to give her special treatment. Why is it that every time she messes up, you let it slide, but when I mess up, I get punished?" Madeline accused Dwayne furiously.

Dwayne's face was icy as he stared at Madeline. "You think I'm biased? Isabella's never screwed up unless you guys pushed her into it! She's gone to bat for you countless times, giving you chances. She was even going to quit and give you her job! But you, you let jealousy get the better of you and tried to torpedo her!"

Madeline stood frozen, staring at Isabella in shock. "You're resigning? That can't be true. It's absolutely impossible."

Isabella nodded. "Yes, I was planning to resign. I even considered recommending you for my position. But as Mr. Larson said, I've given you too many chances, and you squandered them."

"You're lying. You're trying to manipulate me! I don't want your charity! I'll get where I deserve to be, all by myself!" Madeline screamed, her eyes red with rage.

Suddenly, Madeline spotted the paper cutter on the table. In a fit of madness, she grabbed it and charged at Isabella.

###chapter 217 Explosive News

Nobody saw it coming when Madeline went totally nuts.

Odette, who was right next to Isabella, jumped in front of her, taking the hit. The paper cutter sliced through her clothes, leaving a nasty cut on her chest.

Dwayne was quick to act. He kicked Madeline hard, sending her crashing to the ground. The security guards swooped in, pinning her down and snatching the cutter away.

Odette was shaking like a leaf, staring at the blood on her chest, sweat dripping down her face.

"Are you okay? Somebody call a doctor, now!" Isabella yelled, panic in her voice.

Someone in the crowd immediately called 911.

"I'm okay, it's just a scratch," Odette said, her voice trembling.

She looked at Isabella with desperate eyes.

Isabella got the message. She leaned in and whispered, "I'll get you the best lawyer to help reduce your sentence."

Odette's eyes filled with gratitude.

"Odette, why did you betray me? After everything I did for you? What did Isabella offer you? Why? I hate you! You all deserve to rot in hell!" Madeline screamed from the floor, her hair a mess, eyes wild with rage.

"Hand her over to the cops!" Dwayne barked.

The security guards hauled Madeline up and dragged her out.

Even as they dragged her away, her laughter, chilling and unrestrained, filled the air. "You'll all join me in hell! I'll be waiting!" she shrieked.

Isabella turned to the reporters. "Alright folks, you've got your story. Time to go."

The reporters got the hint. They had their scoop and didn't need to stick around. After quick goodbyes, they rushed out of the building.

Like a pack of wolves, they raced to their cars. Once behind the wheel, they sped off, eager to be the first to break the news.

Soon, an ambulance arrived and took Odette away.

Back at the office, Dwayne dispersed the crowd and called Isabella to his office.

"It's all taken care of. I've heard about your plans, but just remember, if things don't pan out, the director's position is always open for you," Dwayne said with a smile.

Isabella smiled back. "Thanks, Dwayne. And thank the boss for his support. But I've got faith in myself."

After a quick chat, Isabella went back to her office. Once she was gone, Dwayne picked up the phone and called Michael, filling him in on what happened.

"Mr. Williams, Isabella doesn't want to press charges against Odette and plans to get her a lawyer to reduce her sentence. Should we help with that?" Dwayne asked carefully.

Michael replied, "If that's what Isabella wants, then let's do it. I'll take care of the lawyer."

Michael hung up the phone, muttering, "You're lucky you took that knife meant for my wife," as he arranged for someone to handle the situation.

Odette had caused too much trouble in the past. But this time, by taking the knife meant for Isabella, she had managed to earn a bit of redemption in Michael's eyes. He decided to follow Isabella's wishes and reduce Odette's punishment.

Michael then called Jerry into his office. "Bianca's got a hand in this mess too. Once the news breaks, make sure her reputation is completely trashed. I want her name to be mud."

Jerry sighed inwardly, knowing he had more work ahead. "Yes, Mr. Williams, I understand," he replied calmly, then left to make the arrangements.

Michael watched Jerry leave, feeling a nagging suspicion that Jerry was hiding something.

Meanwhile, in the newsroom, the reporters were typing up their stories at lightning speed. Editors quickly reviewed and published the articles, almost simultaneously, highlighting the urgency of the situation.

Soon, the public was buzzing about the dramatic events at Isabella's company.

Bianca was in the kitchen, working on a recipe and preparing a meal for John. "I wonder how things are going with Madeline. She's probably suffering now. My poor cousin, now you'll know what it's like to be the target of online hate," she muttered with a cold smile.

She tasted the soup and nodded in satisfaction. "The flavor is great. John will love it," she said, setting down the bowl and turning off the stove.

Just then, the door swung open, and John walked in.

Seeing him, Bianca smiled and picked up the soup pot. "John, I made you some delicious soup..."

Before she could finish, John slapped her hard across the face. Bianca was stunned, dropping the soup pot. The hot soup splashed on her legs, burning her skin.

Clutching her face in pain, Bianca stumbled back, finally noticing the intense anger on John's face.

"John, what happened? Why did you hit me?" she asked, tears streaming down her face.

John clenched his fists, glaring at her with hatred. "Haven't you seen today's news? Why did you conspire with Madeline to frame Isabella?"

Bianca's heart sank. She hadn't expected John to find out about this.

She wanted to deny it, but remembering that John said it was already in the news, she closed her mouth and grabbed her phone to start searching.

###chapter 218 I Am Your Fiancée

After Bianca finished watching the news, her face went pale. She never thought Odette, who Madeline trusted so much, would stab them in the back!

'That idiot! She's such a fool!' Bianca fumed silently, cursing both Madeline and Odette.

Seeing Bianca's pale face and silence, John knew the news had to be true.

"Why did you do this? When did you become so cruel?" John grabbed Bianca by the shoulders, shaking her, his voice a mix of anger and desperation.

Bianca's mind raced for an explanation. She looked at John, tears streaming down her face. "I had no idea I was being used by Madeline! She asked me to contact the competition organizers, but I didn't know she planned to bribe them."

"Why did you contact Madeline in the first place? You two shouldn't have any connection," John said coldly, his eyes piercing into hers.

"Remember when I went to their company to apologize to Isabella? I reached out to Madeline, hoping she could help me get in. She agreed, and I thought she was being kind. I had no idea she was using me all along," Bianca cried out.

John frowned. Whenever Bianca was involved, she managed to shift the blame onto someone else. Too many coincidences made him suspicious.

"I'll ask Madeline about this. I hope you're not lying to me this time," John said coldly before turning and leaving Bianca's house.

After John left, Bianca, trembling, picked up her phone and dialed a number.

"You have to help me! John went to confront Madeline. If she spills about our plan, my image with John will be completely ruined!" Bianca said, her voice frantic.

The voice on the other end scoffed, "That's the downside of building an image! It can bring you short-term benefits, but when it collapses, it's like a tower of sand, easily washed away."

"Now is not the time for your lectures!" Bianca screamed, her anger boiling over.

The voice on the other end screamed back, even more furious. "Not now? Then, when? After you screw things up again? You idiot! Do you even realize how many times you've gone ahead with your stupid plans without my approval? Have any of them ever worked? All you've done is create more mess for us!"

Bianca, thoroughly chastised, broke down in tears. "I really know I was wrong. From now on, I'll follow your instructions completely! Please, just help me this time!"

The other end of the line fell silent, and Bianca waited nervously.

Finally, a cold voice came through. "This is the last time! If there's a next time, you'll never be with John again."

The call ended abruptly, and Bianca sighed in relief. As long as that person helped her, she would get through this crisis.

Meanwhile, John called the police station and then drove there, determined to get to the bottom of things with Madeline.

The officer who received John looked a bit embarrassed.

"Mr. Williams, I'm sorry. Madeline's lost it and might not be able to answer your questions," the officer said, looking troubled.

John frowned. "Let me see Madeline. I'll decide for myself if she's really lost it."

The officer had no choice but to take John to the interrogation room.

When the door to the interrogation room opened, John was stunned by what he saw.

Madeline was slumped over the table, her wrists bleeding from rubbing against the handcuffs. Her hair was a wild mess, her face twisted in a grotesque expression, eyes vacant, and drool dripped from the corner of her mouth.

"You're all bastards! You all deserve to burn in hell! I'm the smartest person in the world! I just needed a chance! Damn it, why wasn't I born into one of the top four families? I'm prettier than Isabella, more talented than her, why? Yes! I am Isabella! I'm the most famous woman, my fiancé is John! The heir to the Williams Family is my husband! I am Isabella!" Madeline ranted, jumping on the chair like a deranged monkey, her mind clearly shattered.

The officer looked at John, who was standing at the door, unwilling to go in, with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

"Mr. Williams, are you still going in?" the officer asked tentatively from behind.

John hesitated, took a step inside, and asked Madeline, "Madeline, why did you harm Isabella? What deal do you have with Bianca?"

Madeline tilted her head and looked at John, suddenly breaking into a happy smile.

"John, it's me, I'm Isabella! I'm the design director of Luminous Beauty! I'm your fiancée. When are we getting married? Let's get married now! What are you waiting for? Let's go see Mason together!" Madeline excitedly rushed towards John but was restrained by the handcuffs.

"Save me, darling! I'm your fiancée, and I'm not just some nobody. You can get me out of this damn place, right?" Madeline screamed crazily at John.

John clenched his fists, realizing that Madeline was truly insane. She belonged in a mental hospital, not a police station.

"Send her to a mental hospital for treatment," John ordered, leaving the interrogation room. Even as he walked away, Madeline's hysterical screams echoed behind him.

"John! My fiancé, where are you going? Get me out of here. I don't want to stay here. It's so cold. I'm so scared!" Madeline shouted.

After leaving the police station, John got into his car and decided to visit Odette at the hospital. Despite Odette's betrayal of Madeline, she had been someone Madeline trusted and likely knew the details of the deal between Bianca and Madeline.

At that moment, Odette was in the hospital, receiving an IV due to the shock she had experienced.

In the empty hospital corridor, a figure in a nurse's uniform quietly entered Odette's ward. While Odette slept soundly, the nurse surreptitiously added something to her IV drip. The nurse then vanished as quickly and quietly as she'd arrived, leaving no sign of her visit.

###chapter 219 Dead Odette

John drove to the hospital and asked about Odette's room.

When he walked in, he saw her lying there, looking like she was asleep.

Frowning, he went over to her. He wasn't in the mood to wait for her to wake up on her own.

"Odette! Wake up, I need to talk to you." He shook her shoulder, but she didn't move.

Getting frustrated, he slapped her face, but still nothing.

That's when it hit him that something was really wrong. He checked her neck for a pulse, but her skin was cold, and he couldn't find one.

John quickly pulled his hand back. Was she dead?

Just then, he heard a bunch of footsteps coming down the hall. Security guards, doctors, and nurses burst into the room.

They saw Odette on the bed and John standing there, and their looks practically screamed "murderer."

"Damn it! I've been set up," John muttered, his face darkening.

That afternoon, while Isabella's news was still trending, the story of John being a murder suspect blew up.

When Isabella saw the news, she spat out her coffee.

"What did you say? John committed murder?" Isabella looked at Juliet, shocked.

Juliet nodded and handed her tablet to Isabella. "It's true, Ms. Taylor. See for yourself."

Isabella started reading the news.

According to the report, a nurse was found knocked out in the hospital's storage room, her uniform stolen. The person who found her called the police and alerted hospital security. After checking the surveillance footage, security saw the suspect, dressed as a nurse, going into Odette's room.

When security and medical staff got there, Odette was already dead, and John was the only one there.

Later, the police found toxic stuff in Odette's IV, making John the main suspect.

Isabella's mouth twitched. She had just contacted a lawyer to reduce Odette's sentence, and now Odette was dead?

"I knew the wicked would get what they deserve. Madeline went crazy, and now Odette is dead. Ms. Taylor, do you think this is karma?" Juliet asked.

Isabella rubbed her forehead and sighed, "I don't know about that, but I know I'm probably in trouble."

"Why do you say that? You didn't kill anyone," Juliet said, wide-eyed and confused.

Isabella gave a bitter smile and pointed to the picture of John being taken away by the police in the news.

"Do you think John killed Odette?" Isabella asked Juliet.

Juliet nodded, then shook her head. "At first, I thought he did. His thing with Bianca isn't a secret. Maybe he did it to protect her. But then I remembered he's the heir to the Williams Family. He wouldn't need to get his hands dirty; he could just pay someone to do it."

Isabella nodded. "You're right. John wouldn't take such a risk. He probably went to the hospital to ask Odette about her dealings with Bianca. But now that Odette is dead, who do you think they'll pin it on?"

Juliet tilted her head, thinking for a moment. "Aside from the mad Madeline and the dead Odette, that leaves Bianca and you."

Juliet's eyes widened with dawning realization. "There are two prime suspects: Bianca and you!"

Isabella nodded, accepting the grim reality. "If the police can't uncover the truth, suspicion will fall on me. Most people will assume it was me. John isn't a murderous lunatic. Bianca's already got a bad reputation; another accusation wouldn't hurt her-she didn't have a reason to kill. But I'm different. Do you remember Pearl?"

Juliet nodded. Pearl's case had caused a huge stir in the city. The gruesomeness of her fate, even with the images censored, was terrifying.

Isabella narrowed her eyes and said seriously, "The ruthlessness of this killer reminds me of what happened to Pearl. If I'm right, it's the same person! Their goal is to frame me. They probably didn't expect John to show up, but it doesn't matter. They might be even happier because their real aim was to drag the Williams family into this mess."

Juliet listened to Isabella's analysis, feeling dizzy. This was all more complicated than her most intricate designs.

"Sorry, Ms. Taylor, I don't fully understand, but I just want to know, will you be in danger?" Juliet asked worriedly.

Isabella smiled and waved her hand. "At most, it will cause some minor trouble in the media or my daily life. Odette isn't Pearl; no one will go crazy and try to kill me for her."

Though Isabella pretended not to care, she was quite nervous inside.

Meanwhile, Michael also received the news of Odette's death.

"Did you do this?" Michael asked Jerry, frowning.

Jerry immediately shook his head. "Mr. Williams, you're giving me too much credit. Without your orders, I wouldn't dare kill anyone."

Jerry observed Michael's furrowed brow, but had no doubt of his innocence. As Michael's closest confidant, he knew there was no reason for Michael to hide something like this from him.

Michael tapped his fingers on the table lightly. "Isabella might face some trouble in the next few days. But that's secondary. Keep a close eye on Bianca. Something about her doesn't feel right."

Jerry nodded, then remembered something and turned to ask, "Mr. Williams, should we send someone to Lumaria to check on Bianca's kidney transplant?"

Michael nodded. "Yes, go ahead. Get all the details."

###chapter 220 John's Plan

After sending Jerry off to investigate, Michael started thinking about who could be behind all this. His mind raced through a list of suspects, including members of the top four families.

Just then, Michael got a call from Mason, asking him to come to the hospital to discuss something important.

"What does Mason want with me at this hour?" Michael narrowed his eyes, feeling like this could be tied to Odette's murder. It might also involve Isabella, so he had to stay on top of it. Without wasting a moment, he drove straight to Mason's hospital.

Meanwhile, John was released from the police station by his lawyer. He was fuming. Luckily, he had an alibi, so the police couldn't hold him. But when he saw the online speculation about the case, he nearly lost it.

"These idiots! Do they think I can't find out who they are just because they're hiding behind screens? Accusing me of murder-I'll track them down and make them pay!" John angrily threw his phone.

His bodyguard, used to this routine, picked up the phone. As the heir to a powerful family, John's phone contained too many secrets to lose.

'Is this what rich people do? Throw their phones when they're upset? They act like money grows on trees,' the bodyguard thought to himself.

John got back into the car, planning to find Bianca. But then he got a call from Mason, asking him to come to the hospital.

John hesitated for a moment. Since Mason had been hospitalized after their last heated argument, John hadn't visited him. Maybe now was a good time, especially since Mason was reaching out.

John told the driver to head to the hospital run by the Williams family.

When John arrived at Mason's ward, he was surprised to see his uncle Michael already there.

Michael looked up at John and gave a slight nod.

Mason lay in bed, with John and Michael standing on either side.

"You've both seen the news about the murder, right? What do you think?" Mason asked.

Michael was silent for a moment before saying, "I've been busy, so I only learned about it today and briefly checked the story online. Honestly, I don't think Isabella would do such a thing. She already found evidence against Madeline and Odette-they're facing prison. Isabella has no reason to take such drastic measures."

"Michael, do you think Bianca did it?" John asked coldly.

Michael frowned, and Mason also looked at John.

"If it's not her, could it be you, Mr. Williams?" Mason asked with a hint of irony.

John's face stayed blank. "Grandpa, this isn't the time for jokes. I know you both suspect Bianca. Sure, she seems to have a motive since Odette accused Madeline and her of conspiring. But think about it. Does Bianca really need to do this? Ever since the mess with Jasper and Mia, her name's been mud. She gets hate every day. It can't possibly get any worse than this."

Mason lowered his head, eventually nodding. John had a point; Bianca had no reason to do this.

"Do you really think Isabella did this out of spite?" Michael asked calmly.

John sneered, "I don't think Isabella's got the guts, but what about her husband? The man who has never shown his face!"

Mason frowned and instinctively looked at Michael, but Michael's expression stayed the same.

"You suspect Isabella's husband?" Michael asked.

"Yes. And it's not just me. Remember Pearl? Paxton thinks Isabella's husband did that to her. If that's true, then Isabella's husband is a creepy killer! Pearl was left in that horrible state because she kidnapped Isabella. And now Madeline and Odette-one went mad, and the other ended up dead-because they falsely accused Isabella," John analyzed, his face serious.

Mason looked at John with displeasure. "If we follow your logic, then why are Jasper and Mia unharmed?"

John sneered, "They're unharmed for now. Maybe there were assassins in the crowd outside the hospital, but Jasper and Mia were cunning and called the police for protection. Or maybe the man spared them because they're Isabella's parents."

Michael stared silently at John, who had painted him as a total psycho. 'If I were really like you say, the first ones I'd take out would be you and Bianca,' he thought to himself.

"You make a compelling argument. So, what do you plan to do next?" Michael asked calmly.

Mason also looked at John, waiting for his answer.

John smiled. "I plan to help Bianca with her public relations, clear her name, and then guide public attention towards Isabella."

"What? Why would you harm an innocent person?" Mason shouted angrily at John.

A cold glint flashed in Michael's eyes. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to get rid of this guy; he was always stirring up trouble for his wife.

John didn't notice Michael's expression, and he no longer feared Mason.

"Grandpa, if you think Isabella is innocent, what about Bianca? Isn't she innocent too? This is a dead end for now. All I can do is try to clear Bianca's name for the time being. I don't care if it hurts Isabella. What I need to do is get Bianca in charge of the Taylor Family. It's also my way of securing a fallback," John said, turning to leave.

"That damn little brat is trying to drive me crazy, isn't he?" Mason fumed, his anger triggering a violent coughing fit.

Michael quickly called for a doctor to check on Mason.

Meanwhile, a thought formed in Michael's mind. 'If we can find out who killed Odette, maybe we can pin the Pearl case on them too. If I play my cards right, it'll create a rift between Paxton and those guys. Not only could we catch the killer, but we might also uncover that mysterious force and weaken Paxton's grip at the same time.'

Michael's eyes narrowed again as another thought crossed his mind. John was planning to help Bianca take over the Taylor family, and that would be another headache for Isabella. He needed to step in and fix this for her.
###chapter 221 The Art of Conflict Transformation

The reporters, who had initially left, swarmed back to Isabella's company building like bees to honey after news of Odette's murder broke.

As soon as Isabella stepped out after work, she was hit with a barrage of questions from the press.

"Ms. Taylor, there's a rumor online that your husband killed Odette because she tried to harm you. Is that true?"

"Ms. Taylor, some say you promised Odette a lot of benefits but had her killed to avoid keeping those promises. What's your take on that?"

"Ms. Taylor, now that Madeline has lost it, are you planning to take her out too?"

Isabella was beyond frustrated. Standing in front of the flashing cameras, she kept her cool. "First off, I haven't killed anyone, and I have no idea who did. If you want details, ask the police, not me. Also, my husband is just a regular guy; he has no ties to any assassin groups. In the real world, we go by evidence, not wild guesses."

Just as she finished, Leo pulled up with the car. With security's help, Isabella pushed through the crowd of reporters and got to the vehicle.

Right before getting in, she turned back to the reporters, her eyes cold. "I hope you, as journalists, will stick to the truth instead of using baseless rumors to sway public opinion for clicks. If you keep accusing me without proof, I'll take legal action."

With that, Isabella got into the car and shut the door. Leo started the engine and drove off, quickly disappearing around the corner.

As Isabella left, the reporters, now without a target, scattered quickly.

Sitting in the back seat, Isabella crossed her arms, her face tense. She realized something was off-these reporters had shown up way too fast after Odette's murder, like sharks smelling blood.

"This whole thing reeks of Bianca, not me. Why are all these reporters gunning for me?" Isabella muttered, frowning as a possible explanation hit her.

She quickly pulled out her phone, removed Bianca's number from the blacklist, and dialed it.

Bianca was with John, listening to him explain their PR strategy when her phone rang. She glanced at the screen and hesitated.

"It's Isabella. Should I answer?" Bianca asked John.

John thought for a moment before nodding. "Go ahead. Let's hear what she has to say."

Bianca answered the call, and Isabella's voice came through, cold and accusing. "Bianca, this is your doing, isn't it? You deliberately pointed those reporters at me. This kind of sneaky move is so you."

Bianca snorted. "I have no idea what you're talking about. Unless you've got proof, that's slander."

"The evidence is lying in the morgue. I never thought you'd stoop so low," Isabella shot back with a sneer.

"Isabella, you've got me all wrong. I have no reason to harm Odette. I'm just as innocent as you are," Bianca replied, putting on her best innocent and hurt act.

"Let me talk to her," John cut in, taking the phone from Bianca. "Isabella, I just got back from the police station. Both Bianca and I have alibis for the time of Odette's death. We didn't do it. If you want to find out who did it, go ask the police. We have things to do, so we're done here."

With that, John hung up abruptly.

Isabella sat in the car, staring at her phone in shock. "John and Bianca are living together?"

She quickly realized that Bianca alone wouldn't have been able to mobilize so many reporters. It had to be John's doing.

"Looks like John has completely turned against Mason," Isabella muttered, clenching her fists in anger.

John's tactics weren't particularly clever or effective, but they worked-at least in getting her riled up and off his back.

"Ms. Taylor, should I inform the boss? He could easily silence those media outlets," Leo suggested, glancing at her in the rearview mirror.

Isabella shook her head. "No need. It's just a petty annoyance."

Despite her anger, she remained focused. She had more pressing matters to attend to-Jasper was about to be released from the detention center, and she needed to focus on that.

Meanwhile, John briefed Bianca on the PR strategy. She listened intently, committing every detail to memory.

"Right now, everyone suspects you and Isabella. What you need to do is leverage your bad reputation. Keep reminding people that you had no reason to kill Odette. Steer suspicion toward Isabella's mysterious husband and drop hints about Pearl to push Paxton into investigating," John advised, a hint of resignation in his eyes.

John, as the Williams heir, once controlled all family resources. But after clashing with Mason, his influence had significantly waned, forcing him to rely on Paxton's resources.

Bianca grabbed John's hand, her eyes filled with concern. "I'm so sorry, darling. You've sacrificed so much for me."

John brushed her hair gently. "It's not that bad yet. I'm still the heir, and even without Mason's help, I have enough power."

"Thank you, darling. Thank you so much," Bianca said, throwing her arms around him and sobbing quietly into his chest.

Meanwhile, Isabella returned to her villa, surprised to find Michael had come home early.

He placed his phone on the table, having just finished a call.

"You're home early. I haven't had time to cook. How about we eat out or order in?" he suggested with a smile.

Isabella suddenly hugged him tightly, her voice trembling. "I'm caught in another media storm. They're accusing me of being a murderer!"

###chapter 222 Police Actions

Michael held Isabella close, gently patting her back.

"Don't let those trashy tabloids get to you. I know you'd never do something like that," he said softly, though his eyes flashed with a cold, steely glint.

'Just wait, John,' Michael fumed, his face a mask of barely contained rage. 'You've really ticked off my wife, and you will pay for it.'

Isabella lightly patted his chest. "I don't really care. I've been called a fool and an unwanted daughter for years. I can handle that. But I can't stand them calling you a murderer. You're the brightest light in my life, and I won't let anyone slander you like that." Her eyes were red with emotion as she looked up at him.

Michael's expression softened as he wiped her tears away. "Don't worry about what they say. As long as you believe in me, that's all that matters. I don't care what others think," he said with a gentle smile.

Pulling her back into his arms, he added, "I trust the police will uncover the truth. Once they do, those spreading lies online will face the consequences."

Just then, Isabella's phone rang. She pulled it out, surprised to see Amelia calling.

"What's up, Amelia? Something wrong?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

Amelia's anxious voice came through the phone. "Isabella, are you okay? I just saw the news. They're accusing you and your husband of killing Odette!"

"I suspect this is all John's doing. He's trying to divert attention away from Bianca," Isabella sighed.

"That bastard again!" Amelia fumed, her anger palpable even over the phone.

"Why hasn't that jerk been hit by a car yet? Isn't someone struck by lightning every year? Why not him?" Amelia ranted, her frustration boiling over.

Isabella chuckled bitterly. "Alright, Amelia, enough with the cursing. It's a minor inconvenience at worst. But it's okay. I believe once the hype dies down, the police will uncover the truth."

"But what if they don't? Maybe we should pool some money and hire a few trolls to fight back online, give Bianca a taste of her own medicine," Amelia suggested.

Michael, standing behind Isabella, raised an eyebrow. He hoped Amelia wouldn't go through with that plan, as he had already taken steps to resolve the situation.

"Thanks, Amelia, but no need for that. Besides, we don't have as much money as John," Isabella chuckled, declining Amelia's offer.

At that moment, another call came in. "Hold on, Amelia, I've got another call," Isabella said, switching lines.

A woman's voice came through. "Is this Ms. Taylor? This is Officer Davis from the police department. We met during the investigation of your kidnapping case. I'm also handling the current case with Odette."

Isabella remembered the incident with Pearl and the officers who had questioned her at the hospital.

"I remember now. What can I do for you? You don't actually believe the rumors online, do you? I was at the office all day; there's no way I could've done anything," she joked lightly.

The officer chuckled. "We absolutely believe your alibi, Ms. Taylor. I'm calling because we've taken down a troll farm that was spreading those rumors. They were paid to target you."

Isabella was stunned. She hadn't expected such swift action.

Michael smiled lightly, feeling a bit smug.

"Thank you so much for your hard work. I really appreciate it," Isabella said, expressing her gratitude before ending the call.

Turning to Michael, she said, "Can you believe how fast the police moved on this?"

Michael shrugged nonchalantly. "Who knows? Maybe they've got some tech whizzes on their team."

In truth, Michael had anticipated John's move and had hackers track the source of the rumors, leading to the swift police action.

Isabella quickly called Amelia back, sharing the good news.

"They busted a whole troll farm? Wow, the police really stepped up their game!" Amelia exclaimed, equally surprised.

The rumor had just started circulating online, and not many people knew about it yet. The fact that the police managed to bust the trolls so quickly was nothing short of miraculous.

"Do you think the police are using AI now? I can't think of any other reason for such efficiency," Amelia said, feeling a wave of relief. She hadn't had time to hire trolls to manipulate public opinion for Isabella yet. If she had, she might have ended up getting caught too. "Anyway, we've dodged a bullet for now," Isabella said, feeling lighter.

After chatting with Amelia for a bit, Isabella hung up the phone and turned to Michael.

"What's for dinner, babe?" she asked, wrapping her arms around his neck and lifting one foot off the ground, clearly excited.

Michael started to smile but then remembered something, his expression turning serious. "By the way, honey, a friend at the detention center told me that John and Bianca contacted Jasper a couple of days ago."

###chapter 223 Michael's Analysis

Isabella's head jerked up at Michael's words, her eyes wide with surprise.

"What? Bianca met with Jasper? Why would she do that?" she asked, her brow furrowing.

Michael rolled his eyes and shook his head. "How should I know? My buddy said John and Bianca went into Jasper's interrogation room and shut the door. No one else was allowed in, so we have no clue what they talked about."

Isabella's frown deepened as she thought. "Bianca and Jasper have been at odds since the contract issues. This meeting can't just be a casual catch-up; there must be something more to it."

Michael patted her shoulder. "Do you think it's possible that Bianca also wants control of the Taylor Family? She might be eyeing those last three companies Jasper holds."

Isabella pursed her lips, considering the possibility.

Michael stroked his chin and analyzed, "I think it's possible. Think about it: John's with Bianca now, openly defying Mason. If Mason really intends to disinherit John, what do you think John would do?"

"He'll find a new way to stay in power! Bianca's three companies could be his fallback plan. John has invested in those companies before, so he knows them well. If Bianca gains control of them with John's help, the entire family business would end up under John's control," Isabella said, her eyes flashing with determination. "That's not happening. My grandfather worked his whole life for this; he didn't build it to hand it to just anyone."

Michael watched her with satisfaction. With his prompting, she finally understood what John and Bianca were planning.

"John's helping Bianca with her PR, trying to make her look good," Isabella said, her eyes getting icy. "If they trash my reputation, the company's stock will tank. What a snake!"

"So, we need to think about what to do once Jasper gets out of detention. Our previous plan might not work anymore," Michael said, pulling her onto the couch beside him.

Isabella narrowed her eyes, speaking softly, "John and Bianca still haven't locked down Jasper's shares. If I were him, knowing someone wants his failing companies, I'd set a high price! He wouldn't deal with me last time, didn't trust me, hated my guts. Damn, I should've just thrown more money at him instead of ratting him out about that embezzlement."

She slapped her forehead in frustration, and Michael gently rubbed her head. "Don't beat yourself up. I hate seeing you hurt."

Michael gently massaged Isabella's temples as he spoke, "Since Jasper hasn't sold his shares yet, it means he's wary of the evidence you have against him. If he does plan to deal with John, he'll likely take the money and flee the country as soon as he's out."

"We can't let him leave the country so quickly. We need to grab him the second he's free and stop him from seeing John," Isabella said firmly.

Michael nodded, though he had another idea he hadn't voiced: If they could eliminate Jasper and Mia, Isabella would inherit their shares. Despite her public declaration of severing ties with them, she still had inheritance rights. However, this approach would undoubtedly attract scorn and ridicule, which was why Michael hadn't pursued it.

"We need to find a way to stop all this, but how?" Isabella mimicked Michael's thoughtful pose, touching her chin as she thought.

To Michael, the solution seemed straightforward. If they were on his turf, he could simply have Jasper dragged out of the detention center, beaten, and forced to sign over the shares. But this was John's territory, and such violent tactics weren't an option.

However, Michael had another idea: find someone to pose as one of John's subordinates. They could pick up Jasper and Mia from the detention center, then detain and rough them up to force them to sign the agreement.

Just as Michael was about to share his plan, his phone rang.

He glanced at the caller ID, his eyes narrowing slightly. "Honey, I need to take this call. It's from my boss. Keep thinking; I'll be right back."

Michael ruffled Isabella's hair and stepped out of the living room. Isabella barely noticed; she was deep in thought, trying to figure out how to thwart John.

Once outside the villa, Michael answered the call. Mason's tired voice came through. "Michael, come to the hospital. John is here too. I need to talk to both of you."

Michael agreed and hung up.

After the last argument with John, Mason's health had visibly declined.

"Honey, I need to go to the company for a bit. I'll be back soon," Michael said, kissing Isabella lightly on the lips.

Isabella stood up and headed to the kitchen. "Alright, we'll have dinner together when you get back. I'll cook tonight."

"Looking forward to it," Michael smiled, then left the house.

When Michael arrived at the hospital, John was already waiting by Mason's bed.

Michael ignored John and addressed Mason. "Mason, what's this about?"

Before Mason could speak, John cut in.

"Michael, did you report those trolls to the police?" John demanded, glaring at him.

###chapter 224 John's Bet

Michael glanced up at John, giving him a cool look.

"Why do you ask?" Michael asked, a slight smirk on his face.

"He already asked me the same thing," Mason sighed. "But actually I haven't had the chance to do anything yet."

John kept staring at Michael.

Michael's smirk disappeared. "Yeah, you're right. I did it."

"What the hell were you thinking?" John demanded, his anger obvious.

Michael's expression darkened. "Is that how you talk to me? Think your grandpa's too old to keep you in check? Keep that tone, and I might just teach you a lesson myself. And don't think your dad will save you-I'll call him right now!"

John's face drained of color. He remembered Michael beating him up in that bar-vividly. Michael was known for his ruthlessness abroad; this wasn't a joke.

Mason looked at John and said calmly, "Michael does what I tell him. I told him to watch Isabella and keep her safe."

John gritted his teeth. "So you called me here to humiliate me?"

Mason shook his head. "I don't have time for that. I called you here to make a bet."

"A bet?" John frowned, confused.

Michael raised an eyebrow, interested.

"I know your real reason for helping Bianca isn't just love, but also your own ambitions. The Taylor Family may only have three companies left, but it still has some influence. You want to rebuild your power with Bianca and her family's support. That's understandable. So, the bet is about that," Mason explained, a faint smile on his face.

John's mind raced. He remembered Jasper mentioning Isabella had tried to get shares from him. "You want to bet on whether Isabella or Bianca ends up controlling the family?"

Mason nodded. "Exactly. I believe Isabella will come out on top, and you believe in Bianca. Let's make a bet. During the bet, we'll have a truce. Don't start anything with me, and I won't bother you and Bianca."

The offer was tempting. John felt confident he wouldn't lose. "What's the stake? If I lose, do I have to leave Bianca?"

Mason sighed. "Even if I wanted you to, you wouldn't agree. So let's bet something else: ten percent of what we're worth."

John was stunned, and so was Michael.

One-tenth of their assets was substantial, but not something they couldn't handle.

To John, it seemed like an easy win. "Just one-tenth of our assets?"

Mason nodded. "Yes, ten percent. Lawyers will come to notarize our assets to ensure fairness."

John scrutinized Mason's calm eyes. "Alright, if that's all, I'm in."

Mason smiled. "Good. Then wait here for a bit. The lawyers will be here soon."

John didn't object. He glanced at Michael. "What if you and Michael keep helping Isabella? That wouldn't be fair."

Michael shot him a cold look. "If you can refrain from helping Bianca, we won't assist Isabella."

John narrowed his eyes but eventually nodded. "Fine. I won't give her any financial support."

Mason's smile widened. "Then the bet is on. Now, if you'll excuse us, I need to speak with Michael alone."

John left the room, thinking about eavesdropping, but Charles blocked his way, smiling. "Mr. Williams, there's a private lounge for family remembers. You can wait there. I'll have some refreshments brought in."

John glared at Charles before heading to the lounge.

Back in the room, Mason looked at Michael with a knowing smile. "John's playing word games. He said no financial support, but he didn't mention other kinds of help."

Michael chuckled. "There are plenty of loopholes to exploit within and outside the rules."

Mason's gaze hardened. "I don't really care about the outcome of this bet. Whether John succeeds or fails, his actions will benefit the family."

"Then why the bet? Just for fun?" Michael asked, puzzled.

Mason's smile was mysterious. "I want to see if you're truly committed to helping Isabella."

Michael realized this was another test. Mason wasn't convinced Estella was really his wife.

"So, Mason, are you saying you don't need me to help Isabella?" Michael looked puzzled, gazing at Mason.

###chapter 225 Testing

Michael threw the question back at Mason, his brain already buzzing with calculations.

'Business is war, old man. We've all been through our battles. Trying to test me again? So, if I decide Isabella's on her own and this bet's a joke, you'll just let her sink? Your devotion to her is weird, but I can use that to my advantage.'

Michael's face stayed neutral, but inside, he was grinning.

Mason sighed, realizing his test had flopped again. Michael had dodged the question, and Mason had no answer.

"I can't afford to lose," Mason admitted. "Bianca is too dangerous. John would just keep getting played by her, dragging the family down. So, help Isabella when you need to."

With that, he lay back down. "I'm tired. I need to rest."

"Get well soon," Michael said respectfully, leaving the room.

Michael didn't bother with the lounge. The bet was between Mason and John. It had nothing to do with him.

Once outside the hospital, Michael called Jerry and filled him in on everything.

Jerry was shocked. "Sir, Mason was testing you! He must suspect something between you and Isabella. How should we help her now?"

Michael lit a cigarette, taking a deep drag. Isabella hated the smell of smoke in the house, so he tried to smoke outside whenever he could. He exhaled slowly, the smoke swirling around him.

"Stick to the plan... no, let's ramp it up. Help her even more. We have Mason's permission, after all." Michael's lips curled into a cold smile.

Who said hiding your intentions had to be subtle? A big, flashy distraction worked just as well.

Jerry nodded. "Got it. But it's weird. Why is Mason so concerned about Isabella? If it weren't for his push for her engagement to John, I'd almost think she's his granddaughter."

Michael rolled his eyes, feeling the same frustration. "I'm puzzled too. These old guys all have their secrets. You'll never get the truth out of them."

"Should we investigate?" Jerry suggested cautiously.

Michael thought for a moment, then shook his head. "Better not. Digging up dirt on those old men could kill them."

After giving Jerry his instructions, Michael headed home.

John still had to wait at the hospital for the lawyers.

Meanwhile, Bianca was at home, making a phone call.

"Jasper will be out of detention soon. If he refuses our offer to buy his shares, what's plan B? Maybe we can get rid of Jasper and Mia, then leak the story about Isabella trying to buy shares and getting rejected? That'll make everyone think she's guilty," Bianca suggested, thinking the idea was brilliant.

The voice on the other end of the line laughed coldly. "All you ever think about are these sneaky schemes. Do you really think rumors and public suspicion will bring Isabella down?"

Bianca scowled. "Then what do you suggest? Isn't my plan good? If we get rid of Jasper and Mia, Isabella would inherit their shares. She's publicly stated she wants nothing to do with them, so she wouldn't keep the shares. They'd go to other Taylors, making it easier for us to reclaim them."

The voice on the phone was scathing. "It's not that simple! Have you learned nothing from your past failures with Isabella? She could easily tell the media she's inheriting the shares to honor her grandfather's legacy. She's cutting ties with her parents, not her grandfather. It might draw some criticism, but it's a perfectly reasonable move."

Bianca bit her lip, unwilling to believe Isabella would outsmart her yet again. She still saw Isabella as the naive girl she once knew.

"Your idea was stupid, but it did give me a better one," the voice said, a hint of excitement creeping in.

Bianca was surprised. "What idea?"

"When Jasper and Mia get out, I'll arrange an attack on them. You and John will swoop in and 'rescue' them. This will create a sense of urgency. When you then offer to buy their shares, Jasper will likely agree," the voice explained.

Bianca's eyes lit up. "Perfect! This'll totally work! Let's go with it."

While the various factions were making their moves, another family had also noticed Jasper and Mia's impending release.

Paxton stood outside the ICU, his face grim as he watched Pearl suffer.

A subordinate approached. "Mr. Brown, we still haven't found Odette's killer. But there's speculation online that Isabella's mysterious husband might be involved. Our investigation suggests John's the one who leaked this information, but Mason was displeased and had the troll farm reported."

"So, the Williams Family is infighting?" Paxton's lips twisted into a smile.

The subordinate continued, "Also, the private detective you hired to follow Isabella reported that she visited Jasper in detention. Shortly after, Bianca and John also visited him. The detective bribed a guard and learned it was about the Taylor Family's shares."

Paxton's expression shifted. "The Taylor Family only has three failing companies left. Are they really worth investing in? Or is there some hidden value I'm unaware of?"

His eyes narrowed. The Browns had knocked the Taylors off their perch to become one of the top four. If the Taylors still had secrets, he wanted in on it.

"Order our people to keep a close watch on Jasper," Paxton commanded coldly.

###chapter 226 Plan for Jasper

Jasper sat in his cell, counting down the days. Soon, he'd be out of this detention center and living it up abroad as a wealthy man.

As for reviving the family legacy? Forget it. That family was a lost cause. If Bianca and John wanted to try, they could. It would be their funeral.

Jasper hummed a cheerful tune, his face a picture of smug satisfaction.

His cellmates, however, looked at him with nothing but disdain.

'Selling out your own daughter, what a scumbag,' they thought, but none dared voice it aloud.

Despite his family's decline, Jasper still had the clout of the wealthy elite, a class beyond the reach of these common prisoners.

To make a deal with Jasper, John had specifically instructed the guards in the detention center to protect him.

Therefore, despite the strong disdain for Jasper, his cellmates did not dare to lay a hand on him.

Meanwhile, Michael returned home from the hospital to find Isabella had dinner ready. The aroma of the food drew him straight to the bathroom to wash up before he joined her at the table.

As Isabella set the last dish down, she casually asked, "Did you sort out the company issue?"

Michael nodded. "Nothing major, just a missing document. These young folks, so careless. It was right on the desk, but he turned the office upside down looking for it."

He chuckled, mocking the young employee's carelessness.

Isabella smiled, not pressing for details.

"Hey, you're not exactly ancient yourself," she teased.

"Honey, I'm 30. That's practically middle-aged," Michael said, throwing his hands up in mock despair.

Isabella propped her chin on her hands, nodding seriously. "True. Even though I'm younger than you, I'm nearing 30. Once a woman hits that age, aging speeds up. I need to find ways to keep my beauty intact!"

"Science says women age faster without sex," Michael said with a sly grin.

Isabella blushed and glared at him. "Oh really? Does your brilliant science cover how long sex affects a woman's beauty?"

Michael's grin faltered, and he gave her a wounded look. "I haven't been slacking in that department."

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "You're on maintenance meds now; who knows what you'll need later."

Michael gripped his utensils in mock anger. "Just wait. Once I'm off these meds, I'll prove myself to you!"

Isabella licked her lips, giving him a sultry smile. "Looking forward to that."

Michael almost lost control, the urge to scoop her up and carry her to bed was almost too much.

But Isabella suddenly turned serious. "Alright, enough joking. We need to discuss something important. My father's getting out of detention soon. What's the plan?"

Michael's desire faded as he focused on the issue at hand. He had been thinking about this on his way home.

"Jasper has likely struck a deal with John. He's just holding off on signing the agreement because he's worried you might have evidence of his embezzlement. Once he's out, he'll sign the transfer agreement with John and be on a plane out of the country by the afternoon. So, we should target John instead," Michael said, narrowing his eyes.

Isabella looked at Michael with anticipation. "What do you have in mind?"

Michael started to speak but then paused, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. He pointed to his cheek and said, "Kiss me and say, 'Honey, you're amazing,' and I'll tell you my plan."

Isabella's hopeful look turned into a scowl.

"This is not the time for jokes," she snapped, slapping the table.

Michael leaned back, arms crossed, staring at her. "I am not joking. If you want the plan, you gotta pay up."

Rolling her eyes, Isabella stood, walked over to him, and cupped his face. She gave him a hard kiss on the lips.

"Honey, you're amazing. Now spill," she said through gritted teeth.

Michael winced as she squeezed his face. "Alright, alright. Can you let go? My face is hurting!"

Isabella snorted and released him, returning to her seat.

Rubbing his face, Michael said, "We can have someone pose as John's associate to pick Jasper up. They'll have him sign the prepared transfer agreement. After that, we'll show up and sign our names. How's that?"

Isabella listened intently but rolled her eyes at the end. "That's contract fraud. Even if we sign, my father won't honor it."

Michael shrugged. "The first part is solid. Once we have Jasper, we can take him to Mason. He'll get your father to hand over his shares."

Isabella blinked, considering his suggestion. "I'd rather not involve Mason. This is my family matter."

Michael sighed, standing and gently stroking her hair. "Honey, ever since John went against his grandpa, this isn't just about you and Bianca anymore. It started dragging the whole Williams family into it."

###chapter 227 Michael's Advice

After Michael's convincing pitch and some deep thinking, Isabella finally got on board with the plan.

At first, Isabella wanted to call Mason to fill him in, but Michael stopped her.

"Mason's in the hospital. At his age, he needs his rest. Calling him now might just stress him out. Let's wait until we have Jasper, then we can take him straight to Mason," Michael suggested.

Isabella nodded, seeing the logic in his words.

She was gonna do it herself, but Michael insisted on taking the lead.

"Reporters are all over you, and you're up against Bianca. John's probably keeping an eye on you too. It's better if I handle this. They don't know me, so it'll be easier," Michael said with a grin.

Isabella mulled it over and agreed it made sense.

Meanwhile, John met up with Bianca and spilled the beans about his bet with Mason.

"Sweetheart, I'm so touched you'd make such a big bet for me," Bianca said, her eyes tearing up.

Lying in bed with Bianca snuggled against him, John said coldly, "My grandfather told me not to use my resources to help you, but he underestimated me. I don't need money to help you. My reputation alone will make Jasper hand over the shares."

Bianca had been worried if John could really help, but his words put her at ease. Even if he couldn't help out in the open, he'd have her back behind the scenes.

"Thank you, darling. I'll make sure to show my gratitude," Bianca said with a seductive smile, then disappeared under the covers.

John soon let out a satisfied moan.

Everyone was gearing up for Jasper's release from the detention center.

Time flew by, and soon it was the day Jasper and Mia were to be released.

As the detention center gates swung open, Jasper and Mia stepped out into the sunlight, feeling a wave of relief.

Originally, netizens had been trashing Jasper and Mia, but after Odette's murder, everyone's focus shifted to the murder case, and no one paid attention to the couple who had harmed their daughter.

"Sweetie, you said John would buy your shares. When's he coming? We need to get out of here ASAP. I've already planned where we'll go next!" Mia said, her face lighting up with excitement.

Jasper looked at Mia, a strange look in his eyes.

"He should be here soon," he said, looking away.

Not long after, a black sedan pulled up. A young guy wearing sunglasses, Mike Runyon, rolled down the window and waved at them.

"Are you Mr. and Mrs. Taylor? Mr. Williams sent me to pick you up," Mike said with a friendly smile.

"Why didn't John come himself?" Jasper asked, feeling a bit miffed.

Mike shot Jasper a quick look of disdain but kept his smile. "Haven't you been keeping up with the news? Mr. Williams and Isabella are caught up in a murder case. Reporters are all over them. Do you really want Mr. Williams to bring the press here?"

Jasper and Mia exchanged confused glances. Clearly, something big had gone down while they were locked up.

"A murder case? Who got killed?" Mia asked, curious.

Mike started to answer, then thought better of it and pointed to the back seat. "Why don't you hop in the car first? We can talk on the way. It'll save time."

Realizing they were on a tight schedule, Mia and Jasper figured it was best to sign the contract, get the money, and get out of the country fast.

They quickly got into the back seat. As Mike started the car, he filled them in on what had happened.

"So, Bianca teamed up with Isabella's colleagues to mess with her, but Isabella found out and called the cops. One went nuts, the other died, and now the media thinks Isabella did it? Isabella didn't do it! She's changed, but she doesn't have the guts to kill. Her husband... that's a different story," Jasper said with a sneer.

Mia clung to Jasper's arm, nodding. "That jerk once tricked us into the countryside and tied us to a tree! He's a brute. He's probably the one who messed with Pearl, too."

Mia's motherly love had long since turned into resentment towards Isabella and Michael.

Mike glanced at the couple in the rearview mirror, a hint of contempt and coldness in his eyes.

Suddenly, a car sped up behind them and rammed into their vehicle.

Mike was startled, glaring at the car driving alongside them. He rolled down his window and shouted, "Are you blind? Watch where you're going!"

Jasper and Mia, curious, lowered their windows to see what was happening.

The car next to them also rolled down its window, and a man leaned out from the passenger seat, shouting, "Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor! You've been tricked! We're the ones Mr. Williams sent. This guy is an imposter, sent by your daughter!"

Jasper and Mia's faces turned pale as they looked at Mike.

Mike quickly rolled up the window and said, "Don't listen to them! I'm with Mr. Williams! They're the fakes!"

###chapter 228 Who Are the Fakes?

Jasper and Mia were totally confused by the two drivers' conflicting stories. They had no clue who to trust.

Out of nowhere, Mia had a lightbulb moment. She grabbed Jasper's hand and said, "Babe, call John and ask him what the guy he sent looks like."

Jasper nodded and pulled out his phone.

Mike, the driver, smirked a bit.

Jasper's face dropped when he saw he had no signal.

"I can't call. No signal," he said, giving Mike a suspicious look.

Mike's face turned serious. "Damn it, it must be the car next to us! They must have a signal jammer! Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor, hang on tight. I'm gonna speed up and lose these guys."

Mike slammed the gas pedal, and the car shot forward.

The car next to them sped up too, matching their pace. On the wide road, the two cars started a high-speed chase.

The people in the other car yelled at Mike, shouting to Jasper and Mia that they were the ones sent by John. But the roar of the engines and the wind drowned out their voices.

"Call Mr. Williams and ask what to do," the driver of the other car said urgently.

The guy in the passenger seat pulled out his phone, but his face fell. "Damn it! They have a signal jammer!"

"What do we do?" the driver asked, panic creeping in.

The passenger's face hardened. "Slow down and try to get out of the jamming range, but don't lose them."

"I'll try. Let's hope the jammer's range isn't too wide." The driver took a deep breath and slowed the car a bit.

When they were three car lengths behind, the passenger shouted excitedly, "Got a signal!"

He quickly dialed John's number. "Mr. Williams, someone's posing as us and has taken Jasper and Mia!"

John gripped his phone tightly, a vein throbbing in his forehead. He immediately suspected Isabella or Michael.

"Stay on them. Don't let them take Jasper and Mia away. I'm sending backup now!" John barked, then hung up and started coordinating reinforcements.

Meanwhile, Mike noticed the other car was still on their tail. He tapped the steering wheel lightly, and the signal jamming device turned off.

"Looks like we have a signal now. I'll call Mr. Williams," Mike said, pretending to be excited.

Jasper had planned to make the call himself, but hearing Mike's words, he decided to let Mike handle it.

Mike placed his phone on the dashboard and dialed a contact labeled "John." The call was answered after two rings.

"Did you get them?" a deep voice that sounded like John's asked.

"Yeah, Mr. Williams. We've got them, but there's another group pretending to be us. They claim to be your people and are trying to take Mr. and Mrs. Taylor. I think they might be sent by Isabella," Mike said seriously.

"I understand. I'll send more support. Make sure Mr. and Mrs. Taylor are safe," the voice on the phone replied.

"Yes, sir!" Mike responded loudly.

After the call ended, Jasper couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He turned to Mia and whispered, "Do you feel like something's weird?"

Mia shook her head. "No. Why?"

Jasper hesitated, then shook his head. He couldn't pinpoint what was bothering him; it was like a cloud over his mind.

Meanwhile, Michael was lounging in a chair with his eyes closed, surrounded by his subordinates waiting for orders.

A subordinate approached him after finishing a call.

"Mr. Williams, Mike reported that John's men have shown up. They might have figured out our plan," the subordinate said in a voice eerily similar to John's.

Michael opened his eyes and waved a hand. "Stick to the plan."

The subordinates nodded and hurried out, jumping into cars and speeding towards Jasper and Mia's location.

Just then, Jerry rushed in. "Mr. Williams, we just heard-John's got a whole army on the move!"

Michael nodded. "I expected as much."

Jerry continued, "But there's something odd about Bianca. She's going off on her own, not sticking with John."

Michael's eyes widened slightly. "Bianca isn't with John?"

Jerry shook his head. "No. She split from John; our team saw it. She's been acting all paranoid, always looking behind her. She'd have lost them if our trackers weren't pros."

"Get to the point. What did she do after separating from John?" Michael asked, narrowing his eyes.

"She met up with a bunch of people who were all real respectful. They talked about something in the development area, but our guy couldn't get close enough to hear. Then they all took off in cars. Our tracker thinks they might be packing heat," Jerry explained.

Michael drummed his fingers on the armrest. "Did our people follow them?"

Jerry shook his head regretfully. "No, the tracker was alone, and the group had strong counter-surveillance measures. To avoid detection, I told him to keep on Bianca's tail."

###chapter 229 Jasper's Suspicion

Michael listened closely to Jerry's report, his eyes narrowing as he mentally mapped out the city.

Michael's eyes snapped open. "If I'm not mistaken, Jasper and Mia should be getting close to the development area, right?"

Jerry quickly checked the map on his phone and nodded. "Yeah, it's on their route."

Michael's brow furrowed in thought. He couldn't quite figure out Bianca's endgame with these armed men.

"Jerry, what do you think those people are after?" Michael asked.

Jerry paused, frowning as he thought it over. "Those guys have guns. Maybe they're here to kill Jasper and Mia? But it doesn't make sense. If that couple died, Bianca wouldn't get their shares. According to inheritance laws, Mrs. Williams would inherit their shares directly."

Michael's eyes narrowed even more. "Exactly! Isabella would inherit the shares. Bianca wants to stop Isabella from getting them!"

Jerry's eyes widened. "You mean Bianca plans to take out Mrs. Williams?"

Michael rolled his eyes. "Think it through, Jerry. Bianca doesn't need to actually kill Jasper and Mia. She could frame Isabella for trying to kill them, then play the hero and rescue them. Jasper'd probably hand over the shares then."

"That's wicked smart. No way a woman came up with that, right?" Jerry said, surprised.

"Never underestimate a woman, Jerry. There have been plenty of smart women in politics. It's interesting - Bianca's got some hidden allies we didn't know about. Think John knows about them?" Michael smirked.

Jerry shook his head. "I have no idea."

Michael's smile turned cold. "I bet John has no clue about them. They might have been the ones who took out Odette."

"Should we capture these people?" Jerry asked.

Michael squinted. "They framed my wife, so why not frame them back? Go find me a knife"

After Michael laid out his plan, Jerry's eyes widened, but he didn't question it and quickly went to carry out the orders.

Once Jerry left, Michael called another subordinate. "If you encounter armed thugs, retreat immediately. Let John's men deal with them."

With that, Michael hung up, confident his subordinates would execute his orders perfectly.

Meanwhile, Mike, who was driving, received the latest instructions through his earpiece. He was curious about the unexpected third party but knew it wasn't his concern. His job was to follow orders.

"How much longer until we get there? That car is still tailing us. When will John's backup arrive?" Jasper asked, glancing anxiously at the rearview mirror.

Mike tapped the steering wheel, his face serious. "They should be on their way. Just hang tight."

"Patience is the last thing I have right now!" Jasper's unease was growing. He decided to call John to speed things up.

Mike frowned as Jasper pulled out his phone, thinking about reactivating the signal jammer. But then he spotted something ahead.

"Our backup's here," Mike said loudly, pointing through the windshield.

Jasper and Mia saw several black sedans approaching. One of them maneuvered behind their car, blocking the pursuers. The rest of the convoy surrounded them, continuing to drive.

Jasper and Mia sighed in relief. With all these guards around, they felt more secure and were anticipating to meet John."

However, as the convoy entered the development area and approached an intersection, another line of black cars appeared, blocking their path.

Mike slammed on the brakes to avoid a collision.

A group of men wielding clubs emerged from the opposing cars. Mike's expression turned steely as he retrieved a baton from under his seat.

"Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor, we're in trouble. Stay in the car; it's the safest place," Mike instructed before exiting the vehicle.

Jasper and Mia felt a surge of panic, especially Mia, who was trembling with fear.

"Are these Isabella's people? Or her husband's? Damn it, are they trying to kill us?" Mia screamed in terror.

"Shut up! Damn it, I should've seen this coming. If they kill us, she will inherit our shares!" Jasper's face was grim.

Mia looked shocked. "But Isabella severed ties with us, didn't she?"

Jasper sneered. "So what? She still has the inheritance right! Looks like she's gone totally heartless and shameless!"

Convinced that the attackers were sent by Isabella, Jasper and Mia locked themselves in the car.

Outside, Mike faced the approaching thugs, smirking coldly. "Looks like we all have the same goal."

One of the thugs snarled, "We're here on Mr. Williams' orders to take Mr. and Mrs. Taylor. Back off if you don't want to die."

Mike nonchalantly picked his nose and flicked the booger onto the man's polished shoe. "Don't try to scare me. We work for the real Mr. Williams. Who the hell are you?"

The man's face twisted with fury at the insult, his patience snapping. "Take them down! Grab Jasper and Mia!"

He raised his club and charged, followed by his men.

"Show these bastards what we're made of!" Mike yelled, raising his baton and rushing forward.

Chaos erupted as the two groups clashed, the sound of metal striking metal filling the air. The expressions on every face were fierce, and no one held back.

###chapter 230 The Sudden Gunshot

Inside the car, Mia covered her ears, shaking with fear, while Jasper's face went white as a sheet. Even though they were hiding, the sounds of metal clashing and people screaming outside were terrifying.

"Are we gonna make it out alive today?" Mia asked, her voice trembling.

Jasper, suddenly struck by an idea, pulled out his phone to call the cops. Maybe with the police around, they'd be safe for a bit.

But Mike had already activated a signal jammer before getting out of the car. Jasper looked at the blocked signal on his phone and cursed under his breath.

"These damn bastards! We need to get out of the car and find a place with a signal to call for help," Jasper said through gritted teeth.

"Are you nuts? Going out there could get us killed!" Mia screamed, not willing to take the risk.

Jasper glared at her. "You idiot! They're too busy fighting each other to notice us. We should use this chance to escape!"

Mia hesitated, still thinking staying in the car was the safest bet.

Jasper, determined, reached for the door handle, ready to yank it open. Just then, a guy in a black suit ran up and tried to open Jasper's door. Scared the crap out of both of them.

"Damn it, the door's locked," the guy muttered angrily, then raised his club and smashed it against the window.

Jasper and Mia huddled together, trembling as the window shattered.

Just when they thought they were about to be attacked, they heard the guy outside shout, "Mr. Taylor, get out! We're Mr. Williams' people!"

Jasper and Mia were stunned, but before they could process what was happening, Mike swung his baton and struck the guy.

"Idiot, do you think we'd buy that crap? We're the ones Mr. Williams sent," Mike fumed.

Just as Mike finished speaking, he got kicked from behind, sending him sprawling to the ground.

"You're the fakes! I can call Mr. Williams right now!" The guy who had just kicked Mike down held up his phone, putting it on speaker. John's voice boomed out from the device.

"The men in black suits are my real subordinates. Mr. Taylor, don't be fooled!" John shouted angrily from the other end.

But Mike quickly scrambled to his feet and swung his baton, knocking the phone out of the guy's hand. "You morons! Do you really think Mr. Taylor would fall for your tricks? With AI tech so advanced now, voices can be faked, faces can be faked-everything can be faked!" Mike furiously leaped onto the guy in the black suit, punching him square in the nose.

Mia and Jasper were completely bewildered.

Mia clutched Jasper's hand, her voice shaky with urgency. "Honey, who do we trust? The driver was right-voices can be faked. We can't tell who are really John's men."

Suddenly, a thought hit Jasper. He glanced at his phone's screen, which showed no signal. His face went pale. "Wait a minute, if there's no signal, how did John's call come through?"

The guy in the black suit threw Mike off and shouted, "My phone is interference-proof! It's not affected by signal jammers! Mr. Taylor, you have to believe me!"

Jasper was thoroughly confused, his mind spinning. He couldn't decide whom to trust.

Desperate, Jasper jumped out of the car and shouted, "Everyone stop fighting now!"

Though he yelled as loudly as he could, the fighters were too engrossed to listen.

Frustrated, Jasper climbed onto the car roof, waving his arms and shouting, "Whoever stops first, I'll go with them!"

Instantly, the fighting ceased, and the scene fell silent.

"I don't know who are really John's men, so I can't trust any of you right now. But I have an idea: whoever brings John here within an hour, I'll believe them!" Jasper declared.

The fighters paused, considering Jasper's ultimatum.

Jasper didn't want John to come here; John was constantly followed by reporters who might show up. But Jasper had no choice. He needed to see John in person to sell his shares.

After making his announcement, Jasper jumped down and re-entered the car, ready to wait for John.

John's subordinates smirked. "You're done for. We're the ones who can bring Mr. Williams here!"

Mike and his men also smirked. "Keep dreaming! I'd like to see how you're gonna magic Mr. Williams here."

Mike pressed his earpiece, waiting for the armed men Michael mentioned to arrive.

Inside the car, Mia looked at Jasper with admiration. "Dear, you were amazing! They really stopped fighting. Now we just have to wait for John to arrive, and we'll be safe."

Jasper smiled smugly. "I didn't get where I am by being stupid! When John gets here, I'm going to give him a piece of my mind. How could he mess up something so simple and almost let impostors fool us? Unbelievable!"

Just as Jasper was about to continue boasting, a gunshot rang out, followed by the sound of shattering glass.

The bullet smashed through the front windshield of their car, embedding itself in the seat right between Jasper and Mia.

They stared at the bullet hole, cold sweat dripping from their foreheads.

Outside, upon hearing the gunshot, Mike signaled his men to retreat immediately.

###chapter 231 Intense Firefight

Mike and his crew knew right away it was Bianca's gang when they heard the gunshots. So, Mike quickly ordered everyone to fall back.

But before they bailed, Mike and his team decided to mess with them a bit.

"Mr. Williams' backup is here! Let's get out of here, and make sure the injured get to the hospital ASAP," Mike shouted. The wounded were then dragged away by their buddies, heading off in another direction.

Seeing them leave, the guys in black suits looked confused.

"Damn it, we work for the same family! How dare you use guns!" the leader of the black suits cursed.

Soon after, a bunch of masked dudes showed up, confused by the black suits' presence.

"Mr. Bales, nobody told us there'd be this many people," one thug said to Daron Bales, who was rocking a floral shirt.

Daron was just as puzzled. Bianca had only mentioned grabbing Jasper and Mia for a staged rescue, not that there'd be so many people.

"Mr. Bales, Jasper and Mia are over there," a thug pointed to a black car.

The car window was smashed, and inside were the terrified Jasper and Mia.

Daron didn't jump into action right away, sensing something was off with all these unexpected people around.

As Daron hesitated, he noticed the black suits slowly surrounding them.

"Damn it, what do you want?" Daron shouted, raising his gun, and his crew followed suit.

"Think you're the only ones packing?"  A few of the guys in suits flashed their own guns.

Both sides had their guns drawn, but no one dared to shoot.

Daron and his guys didn't want to start shooting-it wasn't worth it. Bianca hadn't paid them enough.

The black suits hesitated too, wondering if the others were Michael's men.

The standoff dragged on, with Jasper and Mia clinging to each other, shaking.

A sudden idea struck Daron. Bianca had told them to frame Isabella for the murders.

So Daron yelled at the black suits, "You better back off! We got orders from Isabella to kill Jasper and Mia!"

Jasper and Mia, huddled together, shook even more.

"They really came to kill us! Damn Isabella, we're her parents!" Mia cried, tears streaming down her face.

Jasper gritted his teeth and growled, "No one's trustworthy. Money and power-they wipe out everything, even family."

John's men were confused, wondering if the other side had the wrong story.

Both sides had been claiming the other was faking, each saying they were John's men.

But out of the blue, someone from the other side said they were killing for Isabella.

This whole mess left John's men even more puzzled.

"So, the mask's off, huh? We work for Mr. Williams. Get out of here before we lose our patience. If we find out who you really are, you'll be wishing you'd never set foot in this city, let alone this country," one of John's men shot back coldly.

Daron let out a sigh of relief; he'd already fired a shot. Through the shattered car window, he could see Jasper and Mia looking terrified. As long as they stuck to the script, pretended to be scared of John's power, and then retreated, everything would be fine.

"Well, in that case..." Daron started to say, but was cut off by a sudden gunshot from behind.

One of the black suits got hit in the shoulder, screamed, and dropped to the ground.

"Damn it, who fired that shot?" Daron roared, glaring at his henchmen.

But then one of the black suits on the other side yelled, "These idiots shot at us! Everyone, open fire and take them down!"

Daron didn't have time to figure out who the idiot was that fired the shot. He ducked for cover, pulling out his gun to return fire.

In an instant, a fierce gunfight broke out between Bianca's crew and John's men.

Meanwhile, Mike was hiding in an abandoned factory, watching the chaos below through binoculars.

"Fight, the crazier the better. I hope you all blow each other's brains out," Mike muttered with a twisted grin.

At that moment, two of his guys snuck up behind the factory and approached Mike and his group.

"Mr. Runyon, we did it. We got them fighting!" one of them said, grinning and holding a gun.

If those two gangs could hear these guys, they'd know these two started the whole damn thing with their shooting and yelling.

Mike nodded, satisfied. "Good job, guys. The crazier it gets, the better our chances to pull off the next part of the plan."

By now, Jasper and Mia had gotten out of the car. Not because they suddenly found the courage to face the gunfight, but because the car was no protection against bullets.

Those movie scenes where characters hide behind cars while bullets harmlessly bounce off? Total BS.

Someone once tested it-shot at a car, and the bullets went right through the door. Anyone hiding behind it would get hit.

Unless they hid behind the engine; a solid engine could actually stop bullets.

Jasper and Mia didn't know this at first. They were just hiding behind the car until a bullet hole appeared in the door next to them, shattering their movie-inspired illusion.

"Darling, what do we do now?" Mia asked, tears streaming down her face.

"Enough, stop crying. Now's not the time for tears. We need to find a place to hide and wait for John," Jasper said, gritting his teeth and scanning the area. He finally spotted an abandoned building.

Mike, peeping through his binoculars, suddenly frowned.

"What the heck? Where'd all these people come from?" he muttered, eyebrows knit in confusion as he spotted the unexpected arrivals.

###chapter 232 The Fourth Power

Michael was waiting for a call when his phone buzzed. It was Mike.

"Wait, what? A fourth group just showed up?" Michael's eyebrows shot up, his mind racing.

"Could it be Mason's crew?" Michael immediately thought Mason might have sent them to keep tabs on him.

But Mike quickly shot down that idea.

"Mr. Williams, from what we can tell, this group might be from the Brown Family," Mike said.

"The Brown Family? Paxton's people?" Michael was stunned.

He hadn't even considered that. In his mind, Paxton and his gang had no reason to be here.

"Yeah, it's Paxton's people. Paxton's been digging for info on you and Mrs. Williams. We've run into his guys a few times, so we recognize some of them," Mike explained.

Michael thought it over but couldn't figure out why Paxton would send people here. If Paxton was after Isabella because of Odette's death, he should be looking into Isabella, not her parents, who she had already cut ties with.

Maybe Paxton thought Isabella's family had some hidden secrets and wanted to dig them up. That would make sense.

But none of that mattered now.

A cold, calculating smile crept across Michael's face as he glanced at a clear bag next to him, holding a boning knife. The knife gleamed menacingly in the sunlight, with faint traces of blood on the handle.

"Find a way to drag Paxton's people into this mess. I'll send you something. You have to make sure this thing ends up on Bianca's people and gets found by Paxton's people," Michael instructed over the phone.

Even though Michael's plan sounded complicated, Mike agreed.

The gunfire between the two sides had started to die down. They were running low on bullets after the initial intense shootout.

The gunfire at the scene was getting sporadic. John's crew had the upper hand with their numbers and were closing in on Bianca's group.

"Mr. Bales, what do we do now? We're almost out of bullets, and three of our guys are already dead," a thug nervously asked Daron.

Daron's face twisted with anger. They hadn't been told there'd be such heavy gunfire when they took this job.

"That bitch Bianca's gonna get us all killed!" Daron muttered under his breath.

Just then, a dirt-covered man ran up to them. "Mr. Bales, there's a gap over there. We can break through!" The guy pointed urgently.

Daron found the guy's behavior a bit suspicious, not remembering his name. But right now, escaping was the priority. Daron didn't have time to worry about it, so he led the thugs to break through in the direction the guy pointed.

John's guys noticed the thugs trying to make a run for it. After a quick huddle, they decided to split up: one team would head into the abandoned factory to track down Jasper and Mia, while the other would chase after the thugs.

The earlier gun battle had left John's men bleeding and furious, thirsting for vengeance.

Mike watched the chaos through his binoculars, a cold smile creeping across his face.

"Did you all get into your new threads?" Mike asked, checking them out. They were mirror images of John's crew, all decked out in black suits.

"Your job now is to keep messing with Jasper and Mia. Make them paranoid. Their lives don't matter; just hold out until the big players arrive," Mike grinned.

His men chuckled darkly before heading off to find Jasper and Mia.

Meanwhile, Bianca's crew was still on the run, dodging John's men. If you had a drone overhead, you'd see a group blocking these thugs' path.

Paxton's guys were supposed to be tracking Jasper and Mia, but the gunfire had them stopping in their tracks.

"What do we do now? Sounds like a shootout. Should we check it out?" one of them asked, unsure.

Another guy quickly shot him down. "No way. If you wanna go, be my guest. I'm not getting my head blown off for a few thousand bucks a month," he said, rolling his eyes.

Paxton's crew exchanged looks and decided to wait until the shooting stopped before sneaking in to investigate.

The incident starkly revealed the differences in training and effectiveness among the four families' crews.

John's men were well-trained and took pride in their work. They wouldn't let themselves be humiliated. Their main job was to grab Jasper and Mia, but they also had a team hunting down the thugs, all for family honor.

Paxton's guys, on the other hand, were more about looking out for themselves. They didn't measure up to the long-established families.

"Hey, you notice the gunfire's getting closer?" one of Paxton's men frowned.

They all looked at each other, feeling uneasy.

Then, the sound of heavy footsteps got louder and closer.

Before they knew it, a bunch of armed thugs in floral shirts appeared in front of them.

Both groups stared at each other, momentarily confused.

Paxton's men instinctively reached for their guns.

Daron shouted angrily, "We were supposed to have lost the pursuers! Where the hell did these guys come from?"

###chapter 233 Three-Way Battle!

When Daron let out that roar, Paxton's crew quickly figured out he had the wrong idea.

One of them was about to step up and explain they were just passing through.

But then, out of nowhere, a gunshot echoed from behind the thugs, hitting one of Paxton's guys.

"They are coming for us! Take them out!" someone yelled from behind Daron.

Seeing their buddy get hit, Paxton's crew lost it and started firing back.

"To hell with it, let's take 'em down!" Daron's group shouted, raising their guns to return fire.

Both sides ducked behind whatever cover they could find and started blasting away at each other.

In the middle of all this chaos, the man who fired the first shot to stir things up slipped away without anyone noticing.

Meanwhile, the men in black suits who had been tailing the thugs showed up and paused when they heard the gunfire.

"Think one of our guys got ahead and blocked them?" one of John's men wondered.

"Could be," another agreed.

The black suits arrived, guns blazing, but their shots seemed to hit all the wrong targets.

"Damn, those guys got backup. Take 'em out! Payback time for our brothers!" one of Paxton's men yelled. With some in floral shirts and others in black suits, everyone was getting mixed up and shooting at each other.

"I knew it! Those bastards are after us! Let's make them pay!" Daron shouted, taking down one of the men in black suits.

Watching the three-way shootout from a distance, Mike smirked. "What a mess."

He turned his binoculars towards the abandoned factory, but the wall blocked his view.

"What's your sitrep?" Mike tapped his earpiece and asked his team.

"We're playing cat and mouse with Jasper and Mia, and they're the mouse! Haha," a guy laughed through the earpiece, followed by two gunshots.

Mike frowned, then the same voice came back. "John's guys found us! I tried to blend in, but they asked for a password? Since when do they have a password?"

Mike sighed in relief, knowing his team was okay.

"Stay safe, remember our job is to stir up chaos, not get into a shootout with John's guys!" Mike reminded them.

"Don't worry, Mr. Runyon, we've been shooting at Jasper and Mia a lot. Every bullet's just missed them, scaring the crap out of them. I think Jasper even wet his pants, hilarious," one of Mike's men laughed while shooting at John's crew.

Another gunfight broke out.

Over in the abandoned factory, Jasper and Mia were running for their lives, dodging through old equipment and empty rooms. It felt like they were the prey in some twisted hunting game.

At first, when they spotted the men in black suits, they thought they were John's guys coming to save them. But as they got closer, bullets whizzed past their ears, hitting the wall behind them and sending debris flying.

Jasper and Mia were terrified as the men in black suits laughed like maniacs, shooting wildly. They managed to dodge the bullets, but the whole experience was a nightmare.

"What do we do now?" Mia asked, shaking behind a stack of cardboard with Jasper.

"Stop asking! We just need to buy time until John or the cops show up!" Jasper snapped, his eyes red and on the verge of losing it.

They were out of the signal-jamming area, but their phones were lost during the escape, so calling for help was out of the question.

"What's that smell? It's awful," Mia said, wrinkling her nose and glancing at Jasper's pants.

Jasper's pants had a big wet spot, clearly from fear.

Jasper clenched his legs and angrily slapped Mia. "It's sweat from running!"

Mia covered her face, tears in her eyes.

Just then, someone lifted the cardboard, and one of John's men spotted them, a look of relief on his face.

"Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor, I'm here to rescue you..." he started, but Jasper, not trusting anyone in black suits anymore, grabbed a brick and smashed it into the guy's face.

"Run!" Jasper yelled, pulling Mia along as they took off again.

Even though Mia was furious about being slapped, she knew now wasn't the time to argue. She followed Jasper, trying to escape.

Back at the three-way shootout, Daron's gun clicked empty.

"Damn it, I'm out of bullets!" Daron cursed, slapping his thigh. With an empty gun, he was a sitting duck.

"Mr. Bales, take this," a gloved hand offered him a boning knife.

Daron took the knife, wondering why the guy was wearing gloves, but there was no time to think about it. He just had to wait for the right moment to strike.

Meanwhile, Jasper dragged Mia, running for their lives, but as they went down the stairs, Mia slipped and fell.

To make things worse, two men in black suits were closing in.

"Help me!" Mia cried, reaching out to Jasper.

But Jasper, with only a quick glance back, turned and ran, leaving her behind.

###chapter 234 You Smell So Good

Mia's heart was shattered; she couldn't believe her husband had just up and left her.

"Jasper, you jerk! Get back here, now!" Mia screamed, reaching out helplessly.

Two guys in black suits were lurking nearby, hiding around the corner, hesitant to show themselves.

"What do we do now? We were supposed to act like we were chasing them, but now she's just lying there. How do we keep this up?" one of the men whispered to his buddy.

The other guy hesitated, then called Mike. "Mr. Runyon, we've got a situation. Jasper ditched his wife and took off. Should we split up to track them?"

Mike frowned and replied, "Stall for a bit, don't rush. Capture Mia, but make sure she has a chance to escape. The main character hasn't shown up yet!"

The main character Mike was talking about was Isabella. She got a call from Michael, called the cops, and was on her way with them.

After getting Mike's orders, the two guys knew what to do.

They pretended to stumble upon Mia and started shooting in her direction.

Terrified, Mia, despite her pain, forced herself up and kept running. She found a room to hide in, covering herself with old cardboard, hoping it would keep her safe.

When the two men entered the room, they saw a piece of clothing sticking out from the cardboard and exchanged a look.

"What now? Should we pretend we didn't see her?" one whispered.

His buddy smirked. "Damn, where'd that woman go? If I catch her, I'll strip her and pose her in different positions!"

Mia, hidden behind the cardboard, shook even more, her fear growing with every word.

The other guy looked surprised at first, then caught on. They started talking trash.

"No way! You're into cougars? What, did you have a rough childhood or something?"

"You're missing out, man. Older women are like fine wine; they age like a dream."

"Wow, you've got a taste all right. Those wrinkles aren't my thing; I'm all about young, lively girls."

"You don't get it. Let me break it down for you. You give an older woman a little tap on the rear, and she knows you're ready to switch it up. But with a young chick, she might be clueless about your intentions."

"Sounds like you've got a lot of experience! You make sense, but I still prefer young girls, and some young boys."

"What did you just say? You're into guys as well? That's why you've been eyeing me like you've got some plans in mind."

"Don't stress, I've got self-control. But I can't ignore that scent you're rockin'. You smell so good."

"You damn jerk, if you come near me, I'll disable your reproductive organs."

The two men continued their heated argument at the entrance of the abandoned room.

On the other side, Mike's face darkened as he listened to the argument coming through his earpiece. He had instructed these men to delay, but not with such dirty banter!

Just then, one of his subordinates came in and whispered a few words to him. Mike's eyes lit up instantly.

"This scene can finally come to an end!" Mike whispered some orders into his earpiece, and the guys in black suits quickly backed off.

The two guys trash-talking by the door heard Mike's message too.

One of them purposely raised his voice, "Oh man, those gunshots have drawn attention! Cops are swarming in from the south. Time to bail, fast!"

The other one added, "Damn, we haven't completed the mission! We can't frame Isabella for killing Jasper and Mia."

"If you don't mind being shot dead by the police, then you can stay and finish this damn mission."

"I'm not interested. That cash ain't worth putting my life on the line for."

Mia, hiding behind the cardboard, was shocked to realize that those chasing her might not have been sent by Isabella after all.

On the other side, Paxton's subordinates noticed the gunshots had stopped and immediately guessed that the group had run out of bullets. They rushed excitedly towards them.

On the way, Paxton's subordinates encountered a body.

As they were about to step over the body, the person lying on the ground suddenly opened his eyes and viciously stabbed one of them in the chest with a knife.

"Damn, he's playing dead!" someone shouted, and a barrage of bullets was fired at the pretending dead man.

This person who played dead was Daron.

Paxton's and John's guys had wiped out his crew, leaving him as the last man standing.

Facing the barrage of bullets, Daron couldn't even draw his knife in time, rolling on the ground to dodge the incoming bullets.

Daron hid behind a wall, feeling utterly doomed, and his heart was beating like it was going to explode.

But at that moment, the sound of police sirens blared around them, startling everyone.

"Damn, why are the police here? Grab our dead bodies and let's get out of here!" someone yelled.

Paxton's subordinates immediately hoisted their fallen comrades onto their shoulders and hurriedly retreated.

Upon hearing the police sirens, Daron was almost moved to tears. In the past, such a sound would have filled him with fear, but now it signaled his salvation.

"I don't know who called the cops, but thanks! Hope you don't end up in the same hellhole as us when you kick the bucket," Daron said, then took off.

On the other side, Isabella, sitting in the police car, wore a very serious expression.

###chapter 235 "A Knife"

Isabella was heading off to work because Michael assured her he had everything under control. All she had to do was grab the reporters' attention and make sure nothing messed up the upcoming events.

But then, out of nowhere, Michael called and threw a wrench in her plans. He told her to call the cops right away and get to this abandoned factory where her parents had been shot.

Michael explained over the phone that his guys had pretended to be John's crew to trick Jasper and Mia into getting into a car and taking them straight to Mason. But John's guys caught on and a shootout broke out.

Then, a third group showed up and started shooting. Michael's men bailed, leaving John's crew and the new group to duke it out.

"Sweetheart," Michael's voice was serious, "this third group is super sketchy. They started shooting without a care for your parents' lives. They might even be trying to kill them."

Isabella didn't care about Jasper and Mia. She was more curious about why someone would want her parents dead.

"Could they be trying to kill your parents and pin it on you? As the heir, you've got the strongest motive," Michael suggested.

"Killing just to frame me? That's nuts! Wait, Odette? Is this as brutal as those jerks who hurt Pearl and then framed me? Damn it, why are they always after me?" Isabella fumed over the phone.

Michael awkwardly rubbed his nose, "Babe, now's not the time for this. When the cops get there, go with them to save Jasper and Mia, clear up the mess, and make sure you don't get set up again."

"You're right, they've framed me twice already. No way I'm letting them do it a third time!" Isabella clenched her fists in anger. When the cops arrived, she jumped into the police car and headed to the abandoned factory.

As the police car pulled up to the factory, everyone on the scene scattered.

Hearing the sirens, Mia felt a wave of relief. Even though Jasper had ditched her, she was glad the cops showed up and she was safe.

Mia tossed aside the cardboard, left the old factory, and ran to the police, crying and throwing herself into an officer's arms.

"You finally came, I was scared to death," Mia sobbed, collapsing into the officer's arms.

The officer, feeling a bit awkward, called for a doctor to check on Mia.

Isabella followed the doctor over.

When Mia saw Isabella, she shrank back in fear.

"Stay away from me! Did you send someone to kill us?" Mia pointed at Isabella and screamed.

Isabella's face hardened. "Mother, get your facts straight. If I hadn't called the cops, you might already be dead."

"If you didn't send someone to kill us, how did you know we were being chased?" Mia kept screaming and demanding answers.

Rolling her eyes, Isabella shot back, "Because I sent someone to pick you up from prison. When they got there and didn't find you, they followed the guard's directions and heard gunshots nearby. So they called me, and I called the cops and followed them."

Mia, still skeptical, pressed on, "You cut ties with us, so why bother picking us up?"

With a cold expression, Isabella replied, "Someone who had crossed me before died. I got dragged into the public eye again. I was worried you might become targets too, get killed, and then I'd get blamed. I had to send someone to get you to avoid more slander."

Hearing this, Mia's doubts started to waver. Plus, she had overheard the pursuers' conversation earlier, which softened her hostility towards Isabella.

"By the way, why are you alone? Where's Dad?" Isabella asked, looking around for Jasper.

Mia's face twisted with anger, "Don't mention that jerk. He ditched me and ran off. I don't know where he is; he might already be dead!"

Mia cursed Jasper with a dark expression.

Frowning, Isabella pulled over a nearby cop and said, "My father Jasper is still missing. Please find him and keep him safe."

Mia looked at Isabella mockingly, "Since when do you care so much about your father?"

Isabella shot her a disgusted look. "I'm not worried about his safety, just the shares he holds. I want him alive to hand them over, not inherit them after he's dead. I don't want to be framed again."

With that, Isabella pulled out her phone and called Mason to update him on the situation.

Meanwhile, Paxton had already gotten a report from his subordinate.

"Total bunch of morons! You couldn't even get a scrap of info, and now you've gone and lost a bunch of your own! Who took out your guys? Was it John's crew?" Paxton raged.

The subordinate shook his head, looking bitter. "Mr. Brown, we can only confirm there were two groups at the scene-one was John's, and the other might have been Isabella and her husband's, but it's just speculation."

"I don't want speculation, I want answers! Deal with the bodies and find out what really happened!" Paxton snapped before hanging up.

The subordinate glared at the phone, muttering, "Damn, these tightwads! You rich folks can all go to hell! How much do I get paid to bust my back for you? Screw you all! I hope you go through the same crap as your daughter."

He looked at the bodies and remembered one had a knife stuck in it. That dagger might have the attacker's fingerprints.

Putting on gloves, he carefully extracted the knife and sent it for forensic analysis.

When the results came back, his breathing quickened. Not only did they find the attacker's fingerprints, but they also detected Pearl's blood on the knife!

###chapter 236 Conversation with Mother

The hospital hallway echoed with hurried footsteps. A middle-aged guy, face lined with wrinkles and clutching a stack of test reports, rushed towards the ICU.

Sweat beaded on his forehead, trickling down the creases of his face. Even as it stung his eyes, he didn't bother to wipe it away, too anxious to care.

Outside the ICU, Paxton stood solemnly in front of Pearl's room, peering through the glass at her peaceful, sleeping form. A wave of sorrow washed over him.

Just then, the man burst onto the scene, and Paxton's cold gaze swept over him, making the man freeze for a moment.

"Mr. Brown, there's been a new development," Jonah Clarke, the Brown Family's butler, said as he handed the stack of reports to Paxton.

Paxton frowned at the DNA test report, looking puzzled as he glanced at Jonah.

Swallowing hard, Jonah spoke with grave seriousness, "Mr. Brown, we found Ms. Brown's blood on a boning knife. Even though it was wiped clean, we still detected her DNA in the handle crevices."

Paxton's eyes widened, his hands trembling as he realized the significance of the report. This knife was likely the weapon used to harm his beloved daughter.

"Whose knife is it?" Paxton's voice was hoarse with sadness and anger, as if there was a lump in his throat.

Jonah replied immediately, "Our people had a firefight with a group of thugs while tailing Jasper and Mia today. A man in a floral shirt used this knife to kill one of our men."

"And have you identified the man in the floral shirt?" Paxton asked, his tone sinister.

Jonah shook his head. "I've already sent people to investigate as soon as we got the test results. But so far, no leads."

"Dig deeper, spare no expense, and find out who he is!" Paxton's eyes flashed dangerously.

Jonah's body trembled slightly, knowing that if the man in the floral shirt appeared in front of Paxton, his fate would be no better than Pearl's.

"Understood, Mr. Brown. I'll make arrangements now." Jonah nodded and left the hospital.

After Jonah left, Paxton gently placed his hand on the glass of the ward.

"Pearl, can you hear me? We've got a lead. We'll find whoever hurt you. And when we do, I'll make them pay. They'll feel exactly what you felt," Paxton vowed, his voice breaking.

Just then, another doctor approached. "Mr. Brown, the experiment we mentioned before has made promising progress."

Paxton instantly turned to look at the doctor, his eyes filled with excitement, feeling that today might be his lucky day with two pieces of good news in a row.

"Alright, as soon as the experiment is successful, apply it to my daughter immediately!" Paxton exclaimed with excitement.

The experiment the doctor referred to was an external artificial hearing aid. Due to damage to Pearl's auditory system, she had become deaf. This new experiment could restore her ability to hear.

For someone who only had the sense of touch left, the idea of hearing again was a huge source of joy and hope.

Meanwhile, Isabella and Mia walked into an empty room at the police station. Isabella had it all set up, guarded tight so nobody else could get in.

Mia sat down, giving Isabella a curious look. "Alright, what do you want? If it's about company shares, you're barking up the wrong tree. You know your father. I might have a role at the company, but I haven't got a single share to my name.

Mia smirked at Isabella, holding back from mocking her since her daughter had saved her earlier that day.

Isabella, sitting across from Mia, wore a subtle smile as she met her mother's gaze. "Mother, I know father never planned to give me the shares. He's already arranged with John to sell them."

"So what? They're useless anyway. Might as well trade them for cash. You can't outbid John. If your father wants to sell to John, what's so strange about that?" Mia rolled her eyes.

Isabella's smile grew even brighter.

"I just feel sorry for you, Mother." Isabella's words made Mia furrow her brows.

"Are you talking about him leaving me behind to save himself today?" Mia asked, confused.

Isabella shook her head. "It's not just that. Mother, you should know father has been embezzling public funds for years. With the amount he's taken, he'll spend the rest of his life in prison."

"What nonsense are you talking about?" Mia's gaze flickered, and she turned her head slightly, avoiding Isabella's eyes.

"It seems you do know about father's embezzlement. Are you planning to leave the country with him and live a wealthy life abroad?" Isabella's smile now had a hint of sarcasm as she watched Mia.

"What are you trying to say? We have no such plans. If you're here to make baseless accusations, then there's no point in continuing this conversation," Mia said, standing up and heading for the door.

Isabella stayed seated, not trying to stop her. She just smiled faintly. "Mother, if I could prove Dad never meant to take you with him, what would you do?"

Mia stopped in her tracks, turned around, and looked at Isabella coldly. "What are you trying to say? Are you trying to ruin our relationship with these baseless claims?"

Isabella looked at Mia.

Although Mia's face was expressionless, Isabella saw a flicker of panic in her eyes.

"Is your relationship really that good? Then why did he leave you behind to save himself?" Isabella mocked with a smile, then pulled out a folder.

"These are flight details I got from a private investigator. My dear father bought two tickets to go abroad, one to Vesperia and one to Lumaria. He planned to go to Vesperia himself, leaving you with the ticket to Lumaria." Isabella laid the folder on the table, and Mia practically lunged forward to get a look.

###chapter 237 Convincing Mia

Mia couldn't believe Jasper would just bail on her. She didn't buy Isabella's so-called evidence for a second.

"These have to be fake! You're lying!" Mia shouted at Isabella.

Isabella's face stayed cool. "If you think it's fake, why don't you check it out yourself? The tickets were bought by someone from the company. You should know who, right?"

With a calculated move, Isabella slid Mia's phone towards her. The police had found it in some abandoned building.

Mia quickly dialed a number. It was Jasper's assistant, the one who handled their plane tickets.

As soon as the call connected, Mia demanded, "Tell me, where did Jasper buy the tickets to?"

There was a brief pause before the voice on the other end said, "Mrs. Taylor, didn't Mr. Taylor tell you? He bought tickets to Vesperia."

Mia's phone slipped from her hand, and she slumped into her chair, feeling like her world had just crumbled.

"How could he do this? I'm his wife. He promised to take me with him, but he actually left me behind!" Mia muttered, her eyes vacant, as if all her emotions had been drained.

Isabella crossed her arms and leaned back, watching Mia's despair.

"Mom, you should've known what kind of person Dad is years ago. He's selfish and only cares about himself. Your biggest mistake was overestimating his love for you. What do you think you can offer him? Even though he's middle-aged, he can still start over in a new country, meet a new woman, and have a new kid." Each word Isabella spoke seemed to sap the remaining strength from Mia, her face growing paler.

"Mom, what do you think you can offer Dad? Emotional support? Seriously? Men like him only care about what they want-younger, prettier women. He'll never stop chasing that, only death will change him. And you, Mom, a woman past menopause, are just trash to him now." Isabella's words cut through Mia's fragile defenses, leaving her utterly hopeless.

"Enough, stop it." Mia's eyes were red, and she clutched her head in despair, begging Isabella to shut up.

Isabella sighed, walked over, and hugged her. "Mom, after what he's done, why aren't you getting even? Do you still have any hope for him?"

Mia's body trembled, tears streaming down her face. "How do you want me to retaliate? Report him? I'll end up in jail too."

Mia choked out, instinctively hugging the daughter she had hurt so deeply. She had no one else to turn to now.

"But Mom, this is your only way out now! If you go to the police and tell on Dad, he'll become a wanted man, and you'll get a way lighter sentence as a witness. I'll hire the best lawyer. Your only crime was not reporting it, nothing major. I can bail you out, and later, I'll give you some money so you can live comfortably. That's my offer," Isabella said calmly.

Mia's body shook as she pushed Isabella away, struggling and hesitating in her seat.

Isabella sat back down across from Mia, a faint smile on her face. "Mom, if you want to ask John for help, what do you have to offer? You don't have any shares. The only thing you have is evidence of Dad's embezzlement, which is useless to John."

Mia's lips trembled. She knew Isabella was right. Neither John nor Bianca would help her.

Isabella was the only one who, despite everything, still held onto a tiny bit of family love.

"Mom, think fast. If the police find Dad first and he makes a deal with John, even if you expose this, I won't lift a finger to get you legal help." Isabella stood up and slowly walked towards the door.

"Wait, are you really willing to help me with the lawsuit?" Mia looked up at Isabella's back.

Isabella's lips curved into a smile. She knew she had touched Mia.

Turning around, Isabella smiled faintly. "Sure thing, Mother. If you're not buying into our little connection, let's call it a deal. I need a warrant to keep Dad around here."

Mia clenched her fists as memories of Jasper's betrayal and their many conflicts flooded her mind.

Finally, with a heavy sigh, Mia nodded. "I'll do it."

Isabella nodded. "I'll go get the reporter now."

Isabella left the room, leaving behind a dark-faced Mia.

Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Daron arrived near Bianca's house.

Bianca, in her pajamas, cautiously stepped outside to meet him.

"Daron? Why are you contacting me out of the blue? Do you know John is furious right now? I need to calm him down," Bianca said angrily.

Daron glared at Bianca, sneering. "Did I interrupt something cozy between you two? Sorry about that. But why didn't you tell me? Those people are nuts; they'd blast us without a second thought."

Daron pulled out a gun and pointed it at Bianca's head.

Bianca, startled and scared, stammered, "What are you doing? Didn't I ask you to fake abducting Jasper and Mia? What's with all this?"

Angry and red-eyed, Daron shouted, "And you have the nerve to ask me? We just got to Jasper and Mia's place, and John's men pointed guns at us right away, surrounding us! They didn't hesitate; they just started shooting! All my men are dead."

Shaking uncontrollably, Bianca stared at the gun's barrel, unaware it was out of bullets.

"I'm sorry, I really didn't know about this. I can give you whatever you want. I'll triple the payment, no, five times. How about that?" Bianca said in fear.

###chapter 238 Unlucky Bianca

Daron shot Bianca a smug grin, his eyes glinting with malice.

"Five times the amount? You think that's enough? Those people who died were my closest allies! Our bond was way deeper than just money," he snarled, pressing the gun harder against her forehead.

Bianca's legs wobbled, and she almost lost her balance. Leaning against the wall, she asked, "So, what do you want?"

"It's gonna cost you a lot more! I want ten times the original offer," Daron demanded, his eyes gleaming with greed.

Bianca let out a small sigh of relief. If it was just about money, she could handle it. Ten times the price was steep, but John had given her plenty over the years. She could afford it.

'Just wait, you bastard. Once you get the money, I'll make sure someone takes you out!' Bianca thought to herself, reaching for her phone to transfer the money.

But then, Daron moved the gun from her forehead to her chest, pressing it against her breasts.

Bianca's body trembled, a sense of dread creeping in.

"Ever heard about the pirates in the Middle Ages? Years at sea, the stench of salt and the screams of their victims. They were consumed by rage, and those dirty prostitutes were their only release," Daron said, his eyes roaming over Bianca's body.

Bianca had rushed out in loose pajamas, no bra. The faint outline of her nipples was visible through the fabric.

Daron teased her nipples with the barrel of the gun.

Bianca's cheeks flushed with a mix of humiliation and fury, her eyes burning with defiance despite the situation.

"I don't like those prostitutes. I prefer a taste of a wealthy woman. Now, strip," Daron ordered, licking his lips, his eyes full of lust.

He had already decided that once he got the money, he'd leave the country to avoid retaliation. And before leaving, he could enjoy the taste of a beautiful woman.

"No, you can't do this. I'll give you double the money," Bianca pleaded, her voice trembling as she clutched her chest, trying to shield herself from Daron's advances. She even crouched down, curling up her body.

"Do you think that will stop me?" Daron laughed coldly, grabbing her hair with one hand to control her, while the other hand undid his belt, exposing himself.

Bianca struggled, the foul smell making her face twist in disgust.

"You don't want me to tell John or anyone else about our deal, do you? If you disagree, maybe I'll sell this info to Isabella. She'd love to know. And if John finds out you almost made him the mastermind behind a murder, I wonder what he'd think," Daron's words filled Bianca with fear.

"No, please don't tell anyone, I beg you." Bianca trembled, her voice shaking with desperation as she looked up at Daron.

Daron narrowed his eyes and let out a loud laugh. "Look at you now. The only difference between you and those prostitutes is that your body is relatively clean, but your soul? Not so much."

With a sudden, violent motion, Daron yanked Bianca's hair, pressing her face against his genitals. "Now open your mouth and blow me! If you do a good job, I'll take the money and disappear from your life."

Bianca grabbed Daron's legs, trying to push him away with all her strength. "If you think you can make me submit like this, I'd rather die!"

She screamed angrily, her eyes wide with defiance.

Daron slapped her hard across the face. "You damn bitch, looks like I need to get rougher!"

Bianca screamed and tried to escape, but Daron grabbed her pants.

Her loose pajamas were no match for Daron's strength, and soon her pants were pulled down, revealing her tender buttocks.

"Look at this butt, so tender!" Daron licked his lips, his lustful gaze intensifying.

Just as Daron was about to thrust forward, a roar suddenly rang out.

"Bastard, get away!" John roared, then shot Daron's genitals directly.

The searing pain made Daron scream as he collapsed to the ground, clutching his bleeding crotch, writhing in agony.

"Bianca, are you okay?" John ran towards her, and when he saw her exposed lower body, fury burned in his eyes.

"That bastard tried to rape me! Thank goodness you came in time. Please, take him out!" Bianca cried and screamed.

Daron, lying on the ground, tried to speak.

"Wait, John, don't you want to..." But his words were cut off by John's bullets.

In a blind rage, John emptied his gun into Daron.

By the time John was done, Daron's chest and head were riddled with bullet holes, blood pooling around his lifeless body.

With a cold face, John threw away the gun, took off his jacket, and covered Bianca's lower body with it.

"What was that guy trying to say?" John asked, holding Bianca tightly.

Bianca lay in John's arms, her eyes flickering, and shook her head. "I don't know what he was saying. But it doesn't matter anymore. Don't worry, he just took off my pants, and you came in time. I'm all yours, still pure and untouched."

John sighed, pressing a tender kiss to Bianca's cheek. "Let's not talk about this. I'll take you back to rest, and I'll find you a new place to stay soon. This place is seriously unsafe, and I don't know how that guy got in."

Bianca hugged John's neck and nodded.

Shortly after Bianca and John left, another figure arrived next to the dead Daron and took some photos.

"What a shame, I was so close to an adult movie moment. But damn, Bianca's got a nice ass," the figure sneered with a chilling grin before vanishing into the darkness.

###chapter 239 Questioning Isabella

After John got Bianca back to the villa, he wasted no time and called someone to handle the body.

When the cops arrived to investigate, they shrugged off Daron's death as a case of bad luck due to his trespassing. Considering John's influence, they just threw a few routine questions before hauling Daron's body off.

As soon as Daron's body hit the police station, the Brown Family got the news.

"What did you say? He's dead?" Paxton yelled, punching the wall so hard he left a bloody mark.

On the other end of the line, the butler Jonah glanced at the body covered with a white sheet and nodded reluctantly. "Yeah, he's dead. The officer who brought the body back said this guy was sneaking around Bianca's villa, trying to hurt her, but John caught him and shot him."

"We just started looking into this, and now he's dead? What are the odds?" Paxton sneered.

Jonah, still holding the phone, asked seriously, "Mr. Brown, could Isabella be involved? There's been talk about Bianca and Isabella fighting over company shares, right?"

Paxton chuckled, shaking his head. "Not likely. If Isabella wanted Bianca out of the picture, she'd have done it by now. But you might be onto something, so let's look into Isabella too."

After Paxton hung up, Jonah sighed and started making the necessary arrangements.

Meanwhile, Isabella finally convinced Mia to spill the beans on Jasper's embezzlement.

Facing a swarm of reporters, Mia tearfully admitted, "My husband has been stealing money and sending it to Azure Bank overseas. Only he knows the password. He left me to deal with the mess alone. I'm done with him. I know I've done wrong, and I hope everyone can forgive me."

In front of the cameras, Mia played the part of a helpless wife oppressed by her husband, blaming Jasper for everything, including forcing Isabella to marry John and framing Isabella.

Isabella stayed in the background, listening to Mia's sob story with a blank expression. As long as Mia exposed Jasper's embezzlement and got him locked up, Isabella didn't care about her act.

Just then, Isabella's phone rang. She frowned at the unfamiliar number, probably someone she had blocked before.

When she answered and heard John's voice, her suspicion was confirmed.

"Isabella, I never thought you could be so heartless!" John practically shouted into the phone.

Isabella's eyebrows knitted in annoyance at John's tone. "Are you manic? What nonsense are you talking about?" she snapped back.

John kept shouting, "This is your last warning. If you want Jasper's shares, compete fairly with Bianca instead of sending someone to kill her!"

Isabella paused, wondering if John had misunderstood again, then smirked. "Are you stupid? Isn't framing others and shifting blame Bianca's specialty? She probably hired someone to attack herself just to frame me and get you all riled up. Can't you see through such a basic setup? You're a real idiot," she mocked.

"The guy who attacked Bianca has already been dealt with by me. Do you really think Bianca would do that?" John shot back coldly.

Isabella paused, surprised that the attacker had already been taken out. Had Bianca really become so ruthless?

"Enough. I don't know what's going on in your head, but let me tell you, neither I nor my husband sent anyone to kill Bianca. That's the truth. If you don't believe me, have the police investigate. I'm busy, don't call me again. My husband might get the wrong idea," Isabella said before hanging up and blocking the number.

On the other end, John angrily threw his phone out of the helicopter window, watching it splash into the river below. He was taking Bianca somewhere safe to avoid any more trouble.

"John, I don't really think it was Isabella either. My reputation online hasn't been great lately, so maybe someone bought into the gossip and wanted to mess with me," Bianca said, holding his hand to reassure him.

Bianca wasn't defending Isabella to seem meek in front of John. She was worried that if John kept digging, he'd find out about her connection to Daron.

If John discovered she had once sent someone to kill Isabella's parents, he'd be furious and blame her for not telling him such a crucial detail.

Soon, the helicopter landed at a heavily guarded estate.

Originally a birthday gift for Bianca, the estate was now their safe haven.

Bianca was relieved; after the recent scare, she was exhausted. Once she and John got to the bedroom, she quickly fell into a deep sleep.

Meanwhile, Jasper, who had been missing, finally escaped the development zone and was looking for a phone to call John.

But when Jasper finally found someone willing to lend him a phone and was about to dial, he realized he didn't remember John's number at all.

In this day and age, with everyone having their contacts saved in their phones, who even bothers to remember phone numbers anymore?

###chapter 240 Jasper Wanted

A random guy handed his phone to Jasper, giving him a look that screamed disapproval.

"Are you done yet? Figured out who to call?" the guy asked, clearly impatient.

Jasper felt a tad irritated. Who the hell had the guts to talk to him like that before? But stuck in his current mess, he plastered on a fake smile and scrambled to recall the handful of numbers he still had in his head.

First, he thought of calling his wife Mia. But then he remembered she might be dead, and her phone could be in the hands of the people who killed her. Calling her would be a huge risk, so he scratched that idea.

Next, he considered calling Isabella but hesitated. Asking for her help would probably mean giving up his shares, and he wasn't ready for that.

Finally, he remembered his assistant Micah Porter's number. He dialed it, and after a few rings, Micah picked up.

"Micah, it's Jasper. I'm using a borrowed phone. Call John and give him this number. Tell him to call me back in three minutes," Jasper ordered.

Micah paused for a few seconds before saying, "Mr. Taylor, why don't you tell me where you are? I can come get you."

"I only trust John right now," Jasper snapped back.

There was a brief silence before Micah spoke again, "Mr. Taylor, you'd better turn yourself in. The police are looking for you everywhere, and Mr. Williams might not be able to protect you."

"The police? Protect me? What are you talking about? Why should I turn myself in?" Jasper asked, confused.

Micah sounded surprised. "You don't know? An hour ago, your wife told reporters you embezzled money. Now the police have you listed as a wanted criminal."

"What? No way, how did this happen?" Jasper was stunned, his mouth hanging open.

Suddenly, he felt a chill run down his spine, like he was being watched. He glanced at the guy who lent him the phone, who seemed to be eavesdropping.

"My call's done. Thanks for the phone," Jasper said quickly, hanging up and handing the phone back before bolting. He couldn't be sure if the guy had heard about him being wanted, but he knew the bounty on his head wouldn't be small.

The guy who got his phone back only caught the word "wanted" and didn't hear the rest of the conversation. If he had, he might've tried to catch Jasper.

For now, Jasper was back on the run.

Meanwhile, after hanging up with John, Isabella decided to inform Michael about the situation and gave him a call.

Michael was on the phone with a subordinate at that moment.

"Mr. Williams, we hacked into Azure Bank's network and checked. Jasper and Mia have an account there, but it's empty. Jasper lied to Mia; he didn't put the money in Azure Bank," the subordinate reported.

"Got it," Michael said as he hung up, just in time for Isabella's call to come through.

He answered with a smile, "Hey, babe. Everything sorted on your end?"

But his smile quickly vanished when he heard Isabella's angry voice.

"That idiot John called me again. He said someone tried to assassinate Bianca and thinks I did it. Can you believe that? But the real shocker is that John actually killed the assassin. If Bianca's behind this, she's getting seriously ruthless," Isabella ranted, clearly frustrated.

Michael frowned. He already knew about this. He'd been keeping tabs on Bianca and had evidence of her meeting with Daron, but he couldn't share that just yet.

"You're right, we need to be careful. She's getting more dangerous. By the way, I have some news," Michael said, steering the conversation away from Bianca and Daron.

Isabella sounded curious, "What news?"

Michael thought quickly and came up with a plausible story. "My dad's got a friend at Azure Bank. He had the guy check Jasper's account, and guess what? It's empty. Jasper lied to Mia; he didn't stash the money there."

"Didn't know your dad had connections at Azure Bank. That'll come in handy," Isabella replied, sounding a bit indifferent. They'd already suspected this, so it wasn't a huge surprise.

"My dad's arrest warrant is coming soon. He'll either have to turn himself in or go into hiding. If he wants to leave the city, he can't do it the usual way. Any guesses on how he plans to make his exit from the country?" Isabella asked with a sly smile.

"He'll probably use a smuggler. Got any ideas?" Michael responded, matching her smile.

Isabella nodded. "Illegal exit is his only option now. Even if John wants to help, it'll have to be that way. I'm planning to get Mason to keep a close eye on John. We can't let Jasper escape."

Michael praised her and didn't say much more. Mason would give the task to him anyway.

Meanwhile, Michael's undercover guy, posing as a private detective, found Paxton's butler, Jonah.

"I saw your wanted notice on the dark web. I've got a video that might be worth a lot to you," the detective said confidently, kicking back.

Jonah eyed him coldly. "Let me see the video first."

The detective shook his head. "You gotta pay me a million bucks first. Trust me, this video's gold."

Jonah squinted at him but finally nodded and transferred the money.

The detective pulled out his phone and played the video.

"So it's Bianca," Jonah muttered, watching the footage and hearing the voices. His whole body trembled with the realization.

###chapter 241 It's Gonna Cost you Extra!

Jonah watched the video of Bianca and Daron arguing, and it didn't take him long to figure out Daron was hired by Bianca. But then, the video got all pixelated around Bianca, making Jonah raise an eyebrow.

"Why'd you pixelate the video?" Jonah asked, frowning at the detective.

The detective grinned, "Bianca's John's girl! If you wanna see her goodies, it's gonna cost you extra! Trust me, they're worth it. Just another hundred grand, and you can get a closer look."

Jonah shot the detective a cold look and stayed quiet. He wasn't that interested in Bianca's assets anyway.

"Thanks for the video. Hopefully, we can work together again," Jonah said shortly, standing up and nodding at the detective before leaving.

Anyone who could secretly record near John was worth keeping an eye on. Maybe they could work together in the future.

"Just a hundred grand, and you can see it. You sure you don't want it?" The detective called after Jonah, but Jonah didn't stop.

"What a waste. Such an amazing booty, so big, so tempting, and not appreciated. Is he losing his touch?" The detective shrugged and walked away.

On his way back, the detective felt something was off. He turned around and saw a few ordinary-looking people following him.

He smirked and kept walking, muttering under his breath.

"Mr. Williams, the video's been delivered. If all goes well, the Brown Family should start suspecting Bianca. But it looks like they're onto me, too. They're tracking me." The detective had a tiny earpiece in his ear.

Michael's voice came through the earpiece, "Lose them and come back. Your mission's done for now."

The detective acknowledged and ducked into a nearby coffee shop.

The two people following him went into the coffee shop too and saw him head into the restroom. They waited outside for almost half an hour, but he didn't come out. Curious, they rushed in, checked all the stalls, and found he was gone.

"Damn, we lost him," one of them said.

"Let's tell Jonah," the other replied, pulling out his phone.

Meanwhile, Jonah handed the video to Paxton.

After watching it, Paxton started trembling.

"If I'm not mistaken, my daughter mentioned partnering with someone before. Could that be Bianca?" Paxton asked, his voice shaky.

Jonah stayed silent, not knowing this info.

"Mr. Brown, I don't get why Bianca would do this. Isn't she afraid of our family coming back at her? Or does she think John can protect her?" Jonah furrowed his brow, sensing a deeper plot.

Paxton smirked, a cold glint in his eye. "Bianca's more dangerous than she appears. She and my daughter planned to kidnap Isabella, but Isabella got away. That ruthless woman crippled my daughter to provoke our entire family! Whether John will protect her is anyone's guess-she might have other plans, or she might actually believe he can keep her safe."

Paxton exuded a chilling aura. But then Jonah realized something serious.

"But Mr. Brown, if Bianca's so ruthless, why didn't she just kill Isabella? There were no bodyguards around her before, so it shouldn't have been hard to take her out." Jonah's words made Paxton notice an overlooked aspect.

"Maybe Isabella has some unknown forces backing her, or maybe Bianca did try to kill her but failed for some reason. Both women from the Taylor Family are not to be underestimated." Paxton mused, his eyes narrowing.

Just then, Pearl's doctor walked up.

"Mr. Brown, we're ready to proceed with Ms. Brown's surgery anytime," the doctor said earnestly, looking at Paxton.

Jonah's eyes lit up. If the surgery was successful, Pearl could hear again, which would be a huge benefit for her future.

Paxton took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and when he reopened them, his gaze was steely with fierce determination.

"Start the surgery. When my daughter can hear again, I want to know if Bianca is behind this!" Paxton's eyes gleamed with a chilling resolve.

Meanwhile, after settling Bianca, John headed straight to the hospital where Mason was.

Inside Mason's hospital room, Michael was already sitting by the bed.

John pushed the door open and walked in, his gaze sweeping over Michael and Mason.

"Michael, Grandfather," John began, his voice tight with controlled anger, "Did your people, disguised as my staff, try to kidnap Jasper?"

Michael nodded, his expression calm. "Yeah, I had my people pose as yours to get Jasper to the hospital. Mason wanted to teach him a lesson."

John clenched his fists. "So, was it also your people who shot my subordinates?"

Mason furrowed his brow and looked at Michael, whose expression remained indifferent.

"If I told you I didn't order the hit, would you buy that?" Michael looked at John, his gaze incredibly calm.

John stared into Michael's eyes, feeling an invisible pressure weighing on him.

"Enough, John. I trust Michael wouldn't hurt family. Something's gotta be wrong here." Mason waved his hand, gesturing for John to sit aside.

Michael calmly nodded. "I think the same way. Our conflicts are internal family matters, and there's no need for me to resort to firearms against our own. As for those shooters, I'm not sure where they came from. Initially, my people thought it was your side shooting, so to prevent further casualties, I ordered them to retreat."

John's expression deepened as he continued to scrutinize Michael. In the end, his inner doubts wavered, and he found it hard to believe Michael would do such a thing.

"But if it wasn't your people, then who could it be? Those guys showed up wanting to take out Jasper and Mia. Could it be Isabella's people?" John mused aloud.

###chapter 242 Michael's Deterrence

Mason shook his head after hearing John's theory.

"Isabella wouldn't do something like that. Sure, your reasoning makes sense-after Jasper and Mia died, everything went to Isabella. But knowing her, I still don't think she'd do something like that, even if there was only hatred left between her and Jasper and Mia," Mason said, sticking to his guns.

John smirked at Mason and shot back, "Grandpa, Isabella isn't the girl you remember. She's sly as a fox now, and as ruthless as a wolf! Or maybe calling her a sneaky snake is more accurate."

Mason's brows knitted together. "Isabella's not that kind of person; she'd never hurt her own parents."

John looked at Mason with disappointment and sighed, "Grandpa, sometimes I wonder who you really think is your grandchild, me or Isabella? Why do you believe her more than me?"

Mason fell silent for a moment, mulling over John's words.

Instead of answering, Mason turned to Michael. "What do you think? Could Isabella be behind this?"

Michael shook his head. "Mason, I've checked all of Isabella's accounts. The biggest recent expense was refueling at a gas station. Her balance isn't more than 2 million dollars, and there hasn't been any big drop. I can't see how she could've hired thugs to go after her parents."

"Maybe she has secret accounts, like Jasper and Mia had at Azure Bank," John said coldly, crossing his arms.

John's face darkened at the mention of Jasper's name. He never expected Jasper to embezzle so much money! If Bianca got shares from Jasper, it meant she had to help cover up the embezzlement. Otherwise, Bianca might end up in jail.

Mason, always composed, looked at John and asked, "If Jasper contacted you recently and agreed to transfer the shares to you, would you help cover up the embezzlement?"

John shook his head. "We promised not to give any financial help to Bianca and Isabella."

Mason nodded with a smile. "I'm glad you remember our bet. It seems it's still on."

Mason then turned to Michael. "You heard that, no financial help for Isabella."

Michael shrugged helplessly. "The money's no use unless we get that share transfer agreement from Jasper. Otherwise, even if I wanted to help cover the money, she has no shares to use."

A sudden thought hit John, and he looked sharply at Michael. "Michael, Bianca was attacked today. Was it your people?" John asked coldly.

John initially thought it was Isabella's doing, but something in her tone made him think there might be someone else involved.

Michael met John's gaze without flinching. "If I wanted Bianca dead, I wouldn't have waited this long. She's like a cockroach to me, easy to squash."

"I won't let you talk about her like that," John snapped, his voice cold as ice.

Michael looked at him calmly. "And what are you gonna do about it? I can insult you too, if I want."

John clenched his teeth but held back, knowing he might not stand a chance against Michael.

"Enough! If you two keep at it, it'll be a laughing stock for everyone to watch our family in this mess," Mason barked, slapping the sheets in anger.

Michael and John looked away, avoiding each other's gaze.

Mason turned to Michael. "Michael, was it you? Just give me a straight answer, yes or no."

Michael, steady as ever, shook his head. "It wasn't me."

Mason then looked at John. "I believe Michael. He has no reason to lie about this. Like he said, Bianca means nothing to him. There's no need to stir up trouble over this."

John nodded silently, agreeing with Mason's logic.

"Oh, by the way, my guys found traces of the Brown Family near the abandoned factory," Michael suddenly announced.

John looked at Michael in shock, and Mason's face showed the same surprise.

"Are you sure the Brown Family was there?" Mason asked, puzzled.

Michael nodded. "I'm sure. My men have run into the Brown Family before and recognized some familiar faces, probably sent by Paxton. But I still don't get why they're involved in this."

Michael's words left John and Mason speechless, the unexpected involvement of the Brown Family adding a new twist to their family drama.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Paxton waited anxiously outside the operating room, leaning on his cane.

Just then, the door opened, and the doctor wheeled Pearl out.

"Mr. Brown, the surgery was successful. Once she wakes up, you can ask her some simple questions," the doctor said, giving Paxton some good news.

"Thank you, doctor!" Paxton shook the doctor's hand and watched as Pearl was taken to the ward.

Paxton waited outside the ICU for nearly ten hours. Finally, Pearl began to stir, slowly regaining consciousness.

The doctor brought protective gear for Paxton. "Mr. Brown, you can go in now and ask a few questions, but for her safety, we have to be there with you."

Paxton nodded, and after putting on the gear, he entered the ICU with the doctor.

He looked at Pearl's frail form, his eyes filled with deep sorrow.

Taking a deep breath, Paxton spoke, his voice trembling. "Pearl, can you hear me? It's your father."

Pearl, lying on the bed, trembled slightly. A faint smile appeared on her lips, showing her excitement at hearing a familiar voice.

"Mr. Brown, you can ask one more question, but be careful. Too much stimulation could be harmful," the doctor warned sternly.

###chapter 243 Locking Bianca

After hearing what the doctor said, Paxton's initial excitement started to fade.

"Sorry, I got carried away. I'll ask her now." Paxton took a deep breath and walked over to Pearl.

"Pearl, is what's happening to you because of Bianca?" As soon as he asked, he saw Pearl's body start to shake uncontrollably, like she was having a seizure.

Pearl couldn't speak, only making guttural sounds. Her intense shaking freaked out both the doctor and the nurse.

"Mr. Brown, you need to leave. I have to treat Ms. Brown." The doctor firmly pushed Paxton out of the room.

Paxton wasn't mad, just worried about Pearl. He stood outside, watching through the glass as the doctors worked. The sight of Pearl's suffering tore at his heart.

"Bianca! It's really you!" Paxton clenched his fists so hard his nails dug into his skin. Pearl's reaction convinced him that his suspicions were right.

Jonah had been waiting outside for Paxton. When he heard that Pearl's injuries were linked to Bianca, his face darkened too.

"Mr. Brown, should we go after Bianca?" Jonah asked.

Paxton took a deep breath and shook his head. "Remember, Bianca survived an assassination attempt. She'll be more cautious now, and with John's protection, she's not an easy target."

"Damn it, are we just going to let her get away with this?" Jonah was furious. He had watched Pearl grow up and considered her family.

Jonah seemed to have an idea. "Isn't Bianca fighting Isabella for the family fortune? Should we help Isabella?"

"What does their fight have to do with us? And do you really think Isabella would accept our help?" Paxton glared at Jonah, thinking it was a dumb suggestion.

Paxton took one last look at the ICU before turning to leave. Jonah followed, eager to hear what he was thinking.

"There's more to the Taylor women than meets the eye. They must know something we don't, which is why they're fighting over those struggling companies. If we get involved now, Isabella won't be grateful; she'll just be suspicious." Paxton shook his head, sharing his thoughts.

Suddenly, Paxton stopped, deep in thought. "Is Jasper still wanted by the authorities?"

Paxton turned to Jonah for confirmation.

Jonah nodded. "Yeah, Jasper's still on the run."

Paxton kept thinking, his head down.

"If I were Jasper, I'd want to get out of the country. He can't do it legally. His accounts are probably still frozen since he just got out of detention. He has no money, no connections, so the only way for him to leave is to get help from someone else. Who do you think Jasper would turn to?" Paxton's question was as much for Jonah as it was for himself.

Jonah thought for a moment before replying, "If I were Jasper, I'd probably go to John. He's helping Bianca get shares. As for Isabella, Jasper might not want to lose face, and besides, she probably doesn't have a way to get him out of the country illegally."

Paxton nodded. "Alright, keep an eye on John. If Jasper shows up, grab him immediately. I wonder what assets Jasper's father may have left."

Meanwhile, John headed to the hospital to see Mason, and Bianca locked herself in her room to make a call.

"What kind of idiot did you send me this time? He actually tried to rape me! Can't you find someone competent for once?" Bianca angrily scolded the person on the other end of the line.

The person on the phone knew they had messed up and sounded less confident than usual.

"Yeah, that was my bad. I didn't expect Daron to pull something like that. But you have to understand, most of my reliable guys are tied up, and all I have left are these desperate ones." The voice on the phone sounded a bit helpless.

"Damn it, if we could just kill Isabella, we wouldn't have all these problems!" Bianca scratched her head in frustration, messing up her silky hair.

The person on the phone quickly shut down that idea.

"No way! I'm being watched constantly. If Isabella dies, Mason will definitely investigate, and everyone will start suspecting me!" The voice was serious, genuinely worried Bianca might actually go through with it.

Bianca sneered, "That knife had already sliced into that bitch's flesh when she was under my control in the hospital. She only survived because someone else stepped in."

The voice on the phone shot back with a hint of scorn, "So what? She didn't die, and she kicked you out of the hospital, making you look like a fool in front of everyone. You could've won John over slowly, but you chose to fake kidney disease. Now you have to keep up that lie, bribing medical staff to forge records. Isn't that a pain?"

Bianca was starting to regret it. There was no need to claim kidney disease, but now she was stuck with it.

"Enough, I didn't call to be mocked. What do we do next?" Bianca demanded angrily.

There was silence on the other end for a moment before the voice resumed, "Jasper will probably contact you guys. If he wants to leave the country, he'll need John's help. Just wait patiently. But remember, whatever I can think of, Isabella and Mason can think of too. When Jasper shows up, it'll be a showdown between all of you."

###chapter 244 John's Advice

After a quick chat with Bianca, she hung up. She didn't need to worry about the next steps; John had it covered. If she kept trying to handle things herself, she might end up clashing with John's crew again, and that would definitely raise some red flags.

Not long after she put down the phone, she heard those familiar footsteps outside the door. A soft smile spread across her face in anticipation.

The bedroom door swung open, and John walked in.

"Hey babe, you're back. Did you see Mason?" Bianca asked as she got off the bed and took John's coat, hanging it up carefully.

John sat on the bed, wrapping his arms around Bianca's waist. She noticed he looked a bit worn out.

"What's up, babe? Something happen?" Bianca asked, a bit worried.

John nodded. "Yeah, I saw Michael at the hospital. I asked him if he sent someone to take you out, and he denied it."

John hesitated, not going into all the details about what went down at the hospital, just giving her a quick rundown of the ward visit.

"I believe Michael didn't do it. But why were the Brown Family's people there?" Bianca's eyes searched John's face, curiosity lighting up her gaze.

John shook his head. "I have no idea why Paxton did that. It can't be because Jasper and Mia once claimed they were buried alive by Paxton."

Bianca's expression tightened. 'If that's the reason...' Bianca thought of Pearl's incident.

Pearl had once teamed up with Bianca to kidnap Isabella. Bianca wondered if Paxton knew about that. If Paxton couldn't find the real culprit, would he come after her?

Bianca thought to herself, 'I need to be extra careful right now. I can't put myself in any risky situations.'

"Oh, babe, I just remembered something. Jasper is a wanted man now. He's got nowhere to run, so he'll probably try to contact you. But if I can think of that, so can Isabella, Mason, and even the cops. So you need to be super careful; they're probably watching you." Bianca looked at John with concern.

She was really worried about John, especially after today's scare. She'd heard some of John's guys had died. No matter how tough you are, a bullet doesn't care. Indeed, someone like him might even be a more likely target.

John kissed her forehead, holding her close. "Don't worry, babe. I'm always careful. But I'll keep your advice in mind. I'll wear a bulletproof vest when I go out."

Feeling reassured, Bianca wrapped her arms around John's neck and kissed his cheek.

At that moment, John carefully brought up a touchy subject. "Babe, have you ever thought about what would happen if you got Jasper's shares?"

"Of course, with your help, we'd bring the family back to its former glory," Bianca replied instinctively, then suddenly realized something was off.

"Wait a minute, that embezzled money... damn it, you can't use your money to help me. This is your bet with Mason. We have to catch Jasper and make him spill where the embezzled funds are!" Bianca finally realized what she'd missed.

For John, the amount Jasper embezzled was just small change, but for Bianca, it was a huge deal.

"That damn Jasper, he should rot in hell. He really knows how to mess things up for us," Bianca fumed, biting her lip in anger.

John gently stroked her hair and said, "Babe, I wanted to talk to you about this. Instead of filling that gap, how about I help you launch a new company? I've told Mason not to use any money, but my network can bring in a large number of clients. I just need to snap my fingers, and people will come running with money. There's no need to stick with those three companies. And honestly, I think it's better to hand them over to Isabella. I'm curious to see how she'll manage to fill that financial gap."

John thought his plan was solid. Bianca couldn't account for the embezzled money, and neither could Isabella.

John and Mason's bet was binding on both of them, and Isabella couldn't get a loan from Mason. If she got Jasper's shares but couldn't pay John, she'd be going to jail.

But after hearing John's suggestion, Bianca shook her head.

"Babe, we have to get those three companies," she said firmly.

John furrowed his brow, confused. "Those three companies are on the brink of bankruptcy. Why are you so set on them?"

Bianca gritted her teeth. "I've always sensed there's a deeper story behind those three companies. Think about it, when Jasper made the whole family lose so many companies, these three have been around for years. Even though you invested in them, your investments aren't limited to just these three. Yet only these three survived! I suspect there's something really important to our family in these companies."

John's expression grew thoughtful as he considered the possibility.

"You make a good point, but I've looked into these companies and haven't found anything unusual," John said, shrugging helplessly.

"Though I can't see anything special about them, I'll help you get the shares if you really want them," John smiled at Bianca.

"Thank you so much, babe," Bianca whispered, wrapping her arms around John's neck and kissing him softly.

John kissed her back, and their embrace grew more passionate, their clothes gradually falling away.

###chapter 245 Are you Two Getting Busy?

When John and Bianca were getting all hot and heavy, Michael got back to his villa.

Isabella had already wrapped up her workday and was busy cooking in the kitchen.

"Hey babe, did you stay late at work today?" Isabella asked, her smile lighting up the room.

Michael nodded, smiling back, and shrugged off his coat, hanging it up.

"You seem pretty chipper today," Michael noted as he walked over to Isabella, wrapping his arms around her waist.

Isabella gently pushed his hand away, still smiling. "Well, my mom got picked up by the cops, and there's a warrant out for my dad. Everything's going according to plan, right?"

Michael grinned, "Yeah, things are looking up, but don't forget, we haven't secured those shares yet, and Jasper's left us with a big mess."

Isabella grabbed a bowl of strawberries from the fridge and handed it to Michael. "Babe, can you wash these strawberries?" she asked before turning back to the stove.

As he washed the strawberries, Michael looked at her, a bit puzzled. "You don't seem worried at all. Have you figured out what to do about the missing funds?"

Isabella shook her head. "Honestly, I have no clue. The only thing I can think of is finding my dad, making him spill where the money is, and then covering the gap."

"That sounds like a whole lot of nothing," Michael said with a shrug.

Isabella put down the knife and shrugged too. "Exactly. That's why I'm so chill. When I talked to Mason, he told me about his bet with John. So even if I get the shares from my dad, Mason can't cover the hole with money for me. Unless Jasper hands over the funds, which he definitely won't."

She sounded a bit helpless but kept her optimistic look. "Let's not stress about it now. We'll deal with it tomorrow or the next day."

Michael shook his head with a smile and bit into a strawberry. "These strawberries are good. Where'd you get them?" He picked up another and fed it to Isabella.

She smiled, chewing on the strawberry. "I didn't buy them. Amelia brought them over. She and Benjamin went to a strawberry farm and picked some."

Michael nodded, thinking. "Seems like they're hitting it off. If you need money, you could ask Benjamin. His family might not be one of the big four, but they're loaded, especially with their booming medical business."

Isabella suddenly stopped what she was doing and turned to Michael, her eyes intense.

Michael looked at her, surprised, still chewing on a strawberry. "Did I say something wrong?"

Isabella suddenly put down the knife, hugged Michael excitedly, and planted a passionate kiss on his lips.

"Babe, you're a genius! Forget about borrowing money for now, I just had a brilliant idea! Remember Bianca's feigned illness?" Isabella asked, her eyes sparkling.

Michael nodded. Of course, he remembered. He even sent someone to Lumaria to check if Bianca's surgery was real.

"If we can prove Bianca was faking it, it'll definitely cause a rift between her and John! John's been duped by her twice already, and he hates being lied to. If we can break them up, it'll be a huge win for us!" Isabella reasoned, knowing that Bianca's biggest support came from John. Once John was out of the picture, Bianca would be no threat.

Michael smiled and nodded, watching as Isabella dialed Benjamin's number. He didn't mention the possibility of another powerful force backing Bianca.

Isabella called Benjamin, and after two rings, Amelia's voice came through.

"Hey, Isabella! What's up? Were the strawberries I gave you not to your liking?" Amelia teased.

Isabella was momentarily stunned. Last time, Benjamin helped Amelia move, so she answered his phone. But this time? Was Amelia moving in with Benjamin again?

"Do you realize you are answering Benjamin's phone?" Isabella teased back.

Amelia realized her mistake and blushed. "I just picked up the wrong phone. And Benjamin is right here with me. We're in a legitimate partnership now," she said proudly.

Isabella smiled, about to respond, when she heard Amelia scream on the phone.

"Oh my god, it hurts so much! Pull it out quickly!" Amelia's voice was filled with discomfort.

Benjamin's voice came through, sounding helpless. "Babe, just hold on a little longer. It's almost over."

"But it really hurts! I can't take it anymore," Amelia said, her voice tinged with a hint of whining.

Benjamin sounded even more helpless. "Babe, if you keep moving like that, I really can't pull it out."

Isabella held the phone, her expression stiff. Michael hugged her waist, put his ear to the phone, and smirked.

"Are you two getting busy? Seriously, why didn't you tell me earlier? Can I hang up now?" Isabella said, exasperated.

"No, no, no, Isabella, you got it all wrong! We're not doing that," Amelia explained anxiously.

But just as she finished, Benjamin's voice rang out with relief.

"Babe, I finally got it out! Does it still hurt? Wait, you're bleeding! Don't move, so you don't get infected. I'll get some antiseptic!" Benjamin sounded panicked.

Isabella's face turned crimson, and Michael, with a look of surprise, whispered, "Are they having anal sex?"

###chapter 246 You're Overthinking it

Michael's words dropped like a bomb, leaving Isabella speechless. On the other end of the line, Amelia and Benjamin were just as stunned.

Isabella reached over and pinched Michael's lips, making him look like a duck.

"Sweetie, if you don't know what to say, just zip it. What you said was super embarrassing," Isabella scolded, rolling her eyes.

Benjamin's angry voice came through the phone. "Michael, you idiot, why would I be calling you while doing that?"

"So you guys haven't tried it?" Michael, with a mischievous grin, freed his lips from Isabella's grip.

"Actually, we've tried many times..." Benjamin's words got cut off by his own scream.

On the other end, Amelia, blushing furiously, kicked Benjamin away.

"You moron! What nonsense are you talking about? When have I ever done that with you?" Amelia yelled, fuming.

Isabella shot Michael a fierce look, his words once again stirring up trouble between the couple.

Benjamin, covering his face, mumbled awkwardly, "Honey, you don't get it. There are some things guys just can't give in to."

Seeing Amelia about to pounce on him again, Benjamin quickly shouted into the phone, "Why did you call? Are you trying to ruin our relationship?"

Amelia paused, holding the phone, and asked, "Yeah, Isabella, what's up?"

Just as Isabella was about to explain, Michael butted in, "So, were you two really doing that just now?"

"Will you ever stop? Amelia got a splinter in her hand and was about to go to the hospital. I was just helping her out! It's not what you're thinking. You're such a perv," Benjamin's voice boomed through the phone.

Michael shrugged and took a couple of steps back as he saw Isabella pick up a kitchen knife with a cold look.

"Sweetie, don't be so tense. I was just trying to lighten the mood," Michael said awkwardly, forcing a smile.

In front of his lover and friends, he dropped his usual cool demeanor, showing his playful side.

Isabella rolled her eyes, remembering something she read online about men having a childish mindset.

'I haven't even become a mom yet, but I'm already dealing with this!' Isabella thought, then got to the point.

"I need the medical report on Bianca that you prepared," Isabella said seriously.

Benjamin paused, surprised, "Didn't you say Bianca had already recovered? Why do you need those reports now?"

Isabella replied firmly, "I need to find out which doctors Bianca bribed to fake her evidence. I want them to come clean. Also, I need a test report to see if my kidneys match Bianca's."

"No problem, leave it to me. With my connections, I can handle the doctors and get those test reports," Benjamin assured confidently.

Michael sidled up again, placing a hand on Isabella's shoulder.

Just as he was about to speak, Isabella shot him a cold glare.

"If you say something embarrassing again, you're sleeping on the couch for a month! No way you're getting back in my bed!" Isabella snapped.

Michael's mouth twitched. He just had to wait for Isabella's period to pass so he could impress her in bed. The idea of spending a month on the couch was almost too much to handle.

"Don't worry, babe, I'm serious this time!" Michael grinned and took the phone from Isabella.

"Benjamin, remember when we were drinking last time, and you mentioned sending someone to check out Bianca's surgery in Lumaria? How's that going?" Michael asked, knowing Benjamin would play along.

Benjamin, caught off guard, quickly recovered. He hadn't sent anyone to Lumaria, but he got Michael's drift.

"No news yet. It's not my turf, and these things take time. I'll update you as soon as I hear anything," Benjamin replied smoothly.

Isabella was touched. "Thanks, Benjamin. I didn't expect you to look into Lumaria. There are so many variables."

Benjamin laughed. "No problem. You're Michael's wife and a good friend of my girlfriend. Plus, I can't stand Bianca. With all that, of course I'll help."

After a quick chat about the next steps, Benjamin hung up.

But after hanging up, he noticed Amelia staring at him.

"Sweetheart," he started, a sheepish smile on his face, "are you still mad about my nonsense earlier? Okay, I admit guys can be weirdly competitive, but..."

Before he could finish, Amelia leaned in and kissed him passionately. When she pulled back, her eyes were shining.

Benjamin looked at her, confused.

"I loved what you said just now! You're so smart and loyal! As for the joke with Michael, I'll pretend I didn't hear it," Amelia murmured, gazing at him.

Since they got together, Benjamin had constantly surprised her, whether it was helping her mom or supporting her friend. He was proving to be a great guy.

Benjamin touched his nose. He hadn't actually sent anyone to Lumaria, but he wasn't about to correct her now.

Suddenly, he noticed Amelia's face was a bit red.

With her head down, she whispered, "Even though we haven't done that, if you want, we can try."

At first, Benjamin didn't get what she meant, but then it clicked, and his heart raced with excitement.

###chapter 247 Michael's Phone Call

On the other end of the line, Isabella and Michael, who had just hung up, had no clue about the cozy moments about to unfold between Benjamin and Amelia.

But honestly, Michael couldn't care less about that stuff; he was way more worried about the news coming out of Lumaria and had no idea how the investigation was going over there.

After they finished eating, Isabella headed to the kitchen to do the dishes, while Michael stepped outside with his phone.

"How's it going on your end?" Michael asked quietly into the phone.

He was calling a subordinate who had been in Lumaria for a while, checking in on the progress and giving them a little nudge.

The subordinate quickly responded, "Mr. Williams, I was just about to call you with an update, but since you called first, let me fill you in."

Michael gave a slight nod, needing to hear this info.

The subordinate continued, "After arriving, I got help from a well-known private detective agency here. After a few days, the detective confirmed that none of the city hospitals had any record of Bianca getting a kidney transplant."

"Is that all you found? Could it have been done anonymously? Or maybe not at those hospitals?" Michael pressed.

The subordinate replied, "The detective thought of that. Kidney transplants need allocated slots, and adding someone suddenly would cause issues. So, the detective checked all of Bianca's activities after she left the airport. Turns out, she didn't go to any hospital; she hid out at a vacation resort."

Michael lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, and exhaled thoughtfully. "Has that resort been checked?"

"The detective already looked into it. He went undercover as a hotel waiter, got into Bianca's room, and found her hair in the bathroom to confirm it was her. Plus, some resort staff saw her wandering around. The detective is now reviewing the resort's surveillance footage, hoping to find more clues." The subordinate finished his report, waiting for Michael's instructions.

Michael nodded, satisfied. "Good job. I'm happy with what you've found so far, but the main thing is to get proof that Bianca faked her illness! Think of every excuse she might use."

"Don't worry, Mr. Williams, I'll get it done," the subordinate said earnestly.

With the call over, Michael headed back into the villa.

Inside, Isabella had finished the dishes and was lounging on the sofa, flipping through some documents.

Michael sat down next to her and glanced at the papers, which were from the three companies under Jasper.

"You haven't even got the shares yet, and you're already diving into the company's operations?" Michael teased with a smile.

Isabella kept her eyes on the documents and, without looking up, said, "I'm sure I'll get those shares! Getting a head start on this stuff will help me understand the company's operations better."

Michael sighed and started massaging her shoulders gently.

Isabella patted his hand, smiling. "You've had a long day too. Don't worry about me. Go take a break. I remember reading that a hot bath before bed, along with soaking your feet, can improve your sleep."

Michael sighed again, his shoulders slumping a bit as he moved to the edge of the sofa and scooped Isabella into his arms.

"What are you doing? Put me down, I haven't finished these documents!" Isabella protested, patting his shoulder.

Michael kissed her cheek. "Babe, I think you're the one who needs a break! You've been running yourself ragged, dealing with your parents' stuff, figuring out how to fix Jasper's mess, and now reading these boring documents. You need more rest."

"But honestly, I don't feel tired," Isabella said, a bit helpless.

Ignoring her, Michael carried her towards the bedroom. "Nope, you're tired. I said you're tired, so you're tired! Now, I'm taking you to the bathroom for a hot bath, then a foot soak, and then you can lie in my arms while I sing you a lullaby."

"I'm not a baby, Michael. Why would you sing a lullaby?" Isabella rolled her eyes, but by then, Michael had already taken her into the bathroom.

A scream came from the bathroom. "Wait, you need to leave. I don't need you to help me undress. Damn it, I'm on my period and can't do that kind of thing."

Then Michael's voice came from the bathroom, "Please, honey, think of the water! Let's shower together, it'll save water. I know you're on your period, and I have no intention of doing that. I just want to help you wash your back. Now, stop talking and take a bath!"

Isabella reluctantly agreed. But a few minutes later, a frustrated voice came from the bathroom.

Isabella cried out, "I don't need you to help me wash my butt, I can reach it myself!"

Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, a plane slowly landed at the airport.

Paxton's wife, Zoey, got off the plane with a worried look. The driver who had been waiting quickly took her to the hospital.

Zoey and Estella dined together overseas, growing closer, and planned to shop the next day. But then Zoey got a call from Jonah saying her daughter, Pearl, could now hear sounds.

As a mom, Zoey was super excited, so she took the earliest flight back.

When Zoey showed up outside Pearl's ward, she was buzzing with excitement.

"You said my daughter can hear now, can I talk to her?" Zoey asked Jonah, her voice full of hope.

Jonah awkwardly shook his head. "Ms. Brown's a bit sensitive right now. It might be better to let her calm down first. The doctor suggested some calming music first."

###chapter 248 Zoey's Hatred

Pearl went through hell, losing her limbs and having her eyes, nose, tongue, and ears messed up. All he had left was his sense of touch, and it felt like being trapped in a freezing coffin. It was driving her nuts. Now, she's pretty much lost her mind.

Even with all the fancy medical tech, they couldn't grow back her limbs or eyes. Just getting her hearing back was a huge deal. The doctors were mostly trying to help her mentally, starting with some calming music to ease her stress and slowly get her back to a normal state of mind.

"Why does my daughter have to suffer like this?" Zoey looked at Pearl lying in the hospital bed, feeling like her heart was being ripped apart.

Tears filled Zoey's eyes. She wiped them away, and a flash of anger crossed her face.

"Has Paxton found out who did this to my daughter?" Zoey's eyes, blazing with fury, locked onto Jonah.

Jonah hesitated, his words stumbling, "When Ms. Brown got her hearing back, Mr. Brown did ask if Bianca had anything to do with it. Ms. Brown got really upset, and the doctor had to sedate her."

'Bianca? Isabella's sister, John's girlfriend?' Zoey immediately thought of Bianca's info. The whole Bianca, John, and Isabella thing wasn't a secret among the big families.

"What's Paxton planning?" Zoey asked Jonah.

Jonah shook his head. "Mr. Brown isn't planning to go after Bianca just yet. He wants to wait until Ms. Brown calms down before asking her more."

"So he's just gonna wait, huh? Got it." Zoey's gaze was calm, but it made Jonah uneasy.

"Mrs. Brown, Mr. Brown cares a lot about Ms. Brown. He has a plan. I hope you don't interfere too much," Jonah said softly.

A mocking smile appeared on Zoey's lips. "Interfere with his plans? I've always done exactly what he's told me, same as Pearl. Never a word."

Through the ICU glass, Zoey looked at Pearl sleeping peacefully, her gaze as calm and ominous as the ocean before a storm.

Meanwhile, John and Bianca were already plotting their next move.

They were sure Jasper would call them, so they weren't too worried about the shares.

John was confident in his abilities and was almost certain the shares would go to Bianca. Now, he just needed to help Bianca become the chairwoman of those three companies.

The next day, in a fancy car, John held Bianca's hand in the back seat, gently stroking her hair. He smiled and said, "The business banquet we're going to is for the younger generation of the big families. It's all about discussing hot projects. I hope you can learn something from these business elites. It'll really help you run the company in the future."

Bianca smiled softly, resting her head against John's chest. "Babe, I know how much you've done for me. I'll take this seriously, learn from them, and build connections with the big families as soon as I can."

John smiled, pleased, his hand resting on Bianca's shoulder. She was wearing a black off-the-shoulder evening gown, adding a touch of allure to her usually innocent look.

When the car pulled up to the hotel, Bianca and John stepped out and walked down the red carpet towards the grand entrance.

A bellhop approached, ready to take John's car keys to park the car.

"No need, my driver will handle it," John said coolly, leading Bianca into the hotel.

Lately, John had been extra careful about Bianca's safety, whether it was food or transportation, and he wouldn't let the car keys fall into anyone else's hands.

The bellhop just nodded respectfully and went to help other guests.

A silver Porsche pulled up, and Joseph got out of the driver's seat.

"Sir, do you need me to park your car?" the bellhop asked politely.

Joseph smiled, handing over the keys with a generous tip. "Thanks."

The bellhop smiled back, took the tip and keys, and parked the Porsche.

Joseph looked towards the entrance, checking his watch. He seemed to be waiting for someone.

Soon, a plain black sedan arrived, and Isabella stepped out.

"Thanks, Joseph. If it weren't for your invite, I wouldn't even be here," Isabella said, dressed in a simple suit that worked for both business and events.

Joseph shook his head with a smile. "Given your connections, you're a perfect fit here. Even without my invite, no one would turn you away."

He was right. Isabella might not be in the inner circle anymore, but she'd been a major socialite once, and with Mason's connections, nobody would dare reject her.

Isabella smiled and gestured towards the entrance. "Shall we?"

Joseph nodded, smiling, and walked in with her. He glanced at the men with their dates, feeling a bit envious since Isabella didn't seem interested in holding his arm.

Meanwhile, the bellhop who parked Joseph's Porsche didn't return right away.

After looking around the parking lot, he spotted John's car. The driver was sitting inside, playing on his phone.

A sly smile crossed the bellhop's face as he walked over.

"Hey, man, got a lighter? I want to smoke, but I forgot mine," the bellhop said, tapping on the window with a friendly grin.

###chapter 249 Provoking the Driver

The driver, playing a game in his car, was in a foul mood because he had just lost the game.

He rolled down the window and yelled at the bellhop outside, "Hey, you idiot! Smoking on the job? I don't have a lighter, and I don't smoke. Get lost, you filthy lowlife!"

The bellhop was stunned at first, but then his anger started to boil over.

"What did you just say, you jerk? Say it again! I just asked to borrow a lighter, and you curse at me? Who do you think you are? Look at your ugly face, all gross, and you have the nerve to curse at me with your dirty mouth." The bellhop pointed at the driver's nose, fuming.

The driver's temper exploded like a firecracker. He jumped out of the car and stormed towards the bellhop.

"I'll show you who's tough. I'll break every bone in your body and make you cry for mercy!" The driver sneered, cracking his knuckles. But the bellhop didn't look scared at all. Instead, he turned around and mockingly patted his own butt.

"You look like a big, dumb oaf. If you have the guts, come and hit me, idiot." The bellhop taunted, then quickly ran off.

The driver, now completely enraged, chased after the bellhop, shouting that he was going to kill him or something like that.

While the driver was distracted, a figure dressed in black with a bag approached John's car. The figure quickly installed explosives under the car and then disappeared.

The driver chased the bellhop until the bellhop ducked into a hotel. Realizing he couldn't follow him inside without risking his job, the driver stopped.

He glared at the hotel's entrance, then turned and headed back to the parking lot.

Meanwhile, Isabella, arm-in-arm with Joseph, entered the grand banquet hall.

The hall was packed with young heirs from the four major families and some top executives from other companies.

Joseph introduced Isabella to his friends and business partners, and she quickly charmed them with her elegance and humor.

"Excuse me, I need to use the restroom," Isabella said, excusing herself from the group.

After using the restroom, Isabella was washing her hands when she saw a familiar face in the mirror.

"Bianca, what are you doing here?" Isabella's voice dripped with disdain.

Bianca was just as surprised to see Isabella. After a moment, she sneered and said, "If you can be here, why can't I?"

Isabella gave Bianca a cold look as she finished washing her hands. "John called me earlier, accusing me of sending someone to kill you. What a joke. If I wanted you dead, I wouldn't have waited until yesterday."

Bianca's face twisted with anger. Yesterday's drama had her all shaken up, and being stripped of her pants was a huge humiliation.

"How do we know it wasn't you?" Bianca shot back, trying to pin the blame on Isabella.

Isabella's eyes narrowed. "Do you really think I'm as ruthless as you?"

"No matter how ruthless I am, I wouldn't send my own parents to prison," Bianca sneered.

"Why would I send them to prison? You know the reason. If they weren't dumb enough to believe you, they wouldn't be there," Isabella retorted coldly.

Bianca's eyes gleamed with malice. "I heard you've been looking for Jasper, hoping he'll give you shares of the company. Funny thing is, I want those shares too."

"Dream on! I'm the legal heir, while your father doesn't even qualify to compete with me," Isabella sneered, turning to leave the restroom.

Bianca's face twisted in rage. She grabbed Isabella's arm and spat, "That old fool was blind, giving the company to your useless father. If he'd given it to my dad, our family wouldn't be in such a mess!"

Bianca harbored deep resentment towards their grandfather. Both she and Isabella were granddaughters, but their grandfather clearly favored Isabella more.

In a sudden, heated motion, Isabella turned and slapped Bianca hard across the face. She wouldn't tolerate any disrespect towards her grandfather.

"Consider this a wake-up call. Learn to respect your elders." Isabella yanked her arm free from Bianca's grip and walked out of the restroom.

Behind her, Bianca screamed, "Isabella, you bitch! How dare you hit me!"

Isabella ignored her and walked out, only to run into John.

John was startled to see Isabella, but when he noticed the handprint on Bianca's face, his expression turned icy.

"Did you hit Bianca?" he demanded coldly.

"I did. So what? Do you want to be next, you jerk?" Isabella shot back, her eyes cold.

They were already at odds over Jasper and the company's shares. There was no need to be polite, even if John was Mason's grandson.

"What's gotten into you? You into violence now? Apologize to Bianca right now," John growled.

"Why don't you ask why I hit her?" Isabella glared at him.

"I don't need to know why. I saw you hit her!" John retorted arrogantly, raising his chin.

In response, Isabella slapped John across the face.

The loud slap drew the attention of nearby guests, who looked over in surprise.

John was stunned that Isabella dared to hit him.

After a moment of shock, his anger flared.

"How dare you hit me! Who gave you the courage?" John raised his hand to slap Isabella back.

But before he could, a firm hand grabbed his wrist.

###chapter 250 Two Outstanding Men

Isabella was ready to knee John where it hurts if he even thought about hitting her, planning to make a quick escape from the banquet hall afterward.

With John and Bianca around, there was no way she could network at this party.

So, bailing out seemed like the best option.

But what she didn't see coming was someone stepping in to help her.

Joseph, with a calm smile, grabbed John's wrist.

"John, why are you throwing punches the moment you see me? Is there some kind of misunderstanding? We grew up together-surely we can talk this through." Joseph said, trying to keep the peace.

"Let go of my hand!" John snapped at Joseph.

Joseph, still smiling, let go but stood protectively in front of Isabella.

"Isabella's my guest. Lay a hand on her, and you'll be dealing with me. Trust me, You wouldn't like that." Joseph shrugged, looking a bit helpless.

John glared at Joseph and asked, "Are you really gonna protect Isabella?"

Joseph's smile disappeared, replaced by a determined look. "What if I am?"

The commotion drew the attention of more guests.

Some who knew John and Joseph started whispering among themselves.

"Isn't that the heir of the Williams Family and the second son of the Davis Family, the top two families among the big four? Why are they fighting?"

"See the woman behind Joseph? That's Isabella. She used to be John's fiancée. There were rumors about Joseph and her before. Looks like another love triangle drama."

"Wow, she's got two gorgeous guys battling it out for her affections! Lucky duck!"

"Have you noticed the other woman standing there? She doesn't look too happy."

The crowd's whispers shifted to Bianca, who was trying to keep her cool.

"Ah, it's a classic wife vs. mistress situation. The husband's siding with the mistress, which ticks off the wife, and now the wife's admirer is stepping in." Someone pieced it together.

This theory quickly gained traction among the guests.

John glared coldly at Joseph. Even though his family's power was a bit stronger than Joseph's, it wasn't worth it to clash with Joseph over Isabella.

"Enough, honey, let's go. I'm not feeling well, let's leave the hotel," Bianca said softly, taking John's hand.

The whispers around her had labeled her the mistress, which really annoyed her. She didn't want to stick around anymore.

John shot one last, bitter look at Joseph and Isabella.

"Hope you can protect her forever, and I hope you can keep hiding behind him just as long," John sneered, then left the banquet hall with Bianca.

Joseph didn't argue further with John. Instead, he turned to Isabella with a gentle look and asked, "Are you okay? Did you get hurt?"

Isabella, still composed, shook her head, "I'm fine, thanks for stepping in."

"It's all good. Like I said, you're my guest. If anything happened to you, I'd have a hard time explaining it to your husband," Joseph said, a touch of sadness in his eyes.

"Alright, let's not hang around here any longer. We haven't even had a chance to mingle with our new friends yet," Isabella said, moving further into the banquet hall, pretending not to notice Joseph's expression.

The crowd, who had been eager to watch the drama unfold, started to disperse.

They had been expecting a showdown between Joseph and John, but it ended just like that.

"I told you, Joseph's got a thing for Isabella, but it's clear she doesn't feel the same," someone whispered nearby.

Some women grumbled, "Why does Isabella get all the attention? Are her boobs bigger? Is her butt perkier? Am I not as attractive? Even Joseph can't resist her. What's her secret? If she doesn't want him, I'll gladly take him!"

Isabella, oblivious to the guests' thoughts, continued chatting with the businessmen, focused on making new connections and expanding her network.

Meanwhile, John and Bianca were waiting for their car at the hotel entrance.

John gently touched Bianca's cheek. "Still hurting? That damn Isabella was so ruthless. Do you need to go to the hospital?"

Bianca looked into John's concerned eyes, grabbed his hand, and smiled, shaking her head.

"It's okay, I'm used to it! Back when I was in a wheelchair, she didn't hold back on me. Now, even if I can't beat her, at least I can run away!" Bianca's joke only made John feel more heartbroken.

"Isabella is really despicable! If my grandfather hadn't always warned me not to mess with her, I would've dealt with her a long time ago!" John said, a hint of hatred in his eyes for both Isabella and Mason.

Bianca shook her head. "Forget the past. I'm healthy now, and we're focused on the future. Securing those three companies' shares will be a major blow to Isabella!"

John hugged Bianca tightly, his heart aching for this resilient girl.

Feeling John's warmth and his heartbeat, Bianca suddenly had an idea.

"Hey, we don't really need to go home. This car's nice, but a hotel bed's way more comfortable...and we're already at a hotel." Bianca said, blinking flirtatiously.

John immediately got what Bianca was hinting at.

Just then, the driver pulled up.

John waved to the driver. "Go to the pharmacy and get some anti-inflammatory ointment, then bring it to the hotel."

The driver nodded and drove off.

"Let's go," John said, hugging Bianca as they headed back to the hotel. But before they could get far, a loud explosion suddenly rang out.

###chapter 251 Neurosis

The loud explosion startled everyone. John and Bianca turned back in horror, their eyes widening at the sight of the car they had just exited now reduced to smoldering fragments.

A wheel, ripped loose by the explosion, soared through the air, then rolled menacingly toward them, as if hunting its owner.

The poor driver didn't even have a chance to scream, his life snuffed out in an instant, consumed by the explosion.

John's face turned pale. It was his first experience with such a terrifying assassination attempt. Bianca's face didn't look any better, trembling with fear, she subconsciously held onto John's arm.

Meanwhile, in the banquet hall, Isabella and her group also heard the explosion outside. Looking through the window, all they could see was a pile of burning debris.

"A car explosion? And right by the hotel? What's happening?" Joseph mused, his brow furrowed.

Isabella's eyes widened in sudden understanding. She immediately left the banquet hall and ran downstairs, with Joseph following closely behind.

When Isabella arrived at the hotel entrance, a large crowd had already gathered, with John and Bianca standing among them. Security guards surrounded them, keeping the crowd at bay.

When Bianca saw Isabella, she shrieked and pointed, accusing, "Was it you? Did you plant the bomb in our car?"

Isabella paused, confirming her suspicion: the destroyed car indeed belonged to John.

She glanced at John, who had a furious expression and seemed to also suspect her.

"If you think it was me, call the police. But I warn you, if it turns out not to be me, I'm suing you for defamation," Isabella retorted, staring coldly at Bianca.

Before Bianca could say anything else, John pulled her hand and shook his head.

The scene had terrified Bianca, making her tremble uncontrollably. It was her first time facing death. She couldn't imagine what would have become of her had she not, on a whim, decided to stay at the hotel with John for the night. Perhaps she would have been blown into burning pieces.

Joseph also rushed over, looking surprised by what was happening outside.

"What on earth is going on here?" Joseph asked the people nearby with a furrowed brow.

When he was told about the explosion of the car John was in, Joseph was taken aback.

It had been a long time since anyone had targeted the heirs of the four major families since Pearl was tortured into a cripple and a lunatic. And this time, it was a direct attack on the largest family, the Williams Family.

"Did you do this?" John demanded of Isabella, his eyes narrowed.

Isabella glared angrily at John. "Stop accusing me every time something terrible happens! Paxton did that, and now you're doing the same! Am I some kind of professional scapegoat?"

Isabella's outburst drew all eyes. Recognizing the connections between the three, the onlookers murmured amongst themselves.

Sensing Isabella's anger, Joseph stepped forward to shield Isabella., looking at John.

"John, I can testify that from the moment Isabella left the company until now, she has been with me the whole time. She didn't answer any calls or contact anyone. This couldn't have been her doing. If you doubt it, you can have the police investigate, and I will fully cooperate," Joseph said calmly.

Isabella watched Joseph's back, furrowing her brows slightly, then took a step aside from behind Joseph.

"I said I didn't do it, and I didn't. Don't push every disgusting thing onto me! I don't need anyone to testify for me. If you don't believe me, go ahead and investigate." Isabella looked coldly at John before turning and leaving, heading back to the banquet hall to wait for the police.

John clenched his fists, looking angrily at Isabella's retreating figure.

At that moment, the hotel manager hurried over anxiously.

"Sorry, Mr. Williams, for the disturbance. I have informed everyone to seal off all exits of the hotel. We have to wait for the police to arrive, and no one will be allowed to leave the hotel!" he stammered, wiping beads of sweat from his brow.

Initially, the manager didn't take the explosion outside seriously, thinking it was just a blown tire from a passing car. It was only when he learned that the wreckage was John's car that he felt a chill of dread.

John's gaze was icy as he passed the manager, striding into the hotel.

The manager felt a deep sense of panic. If he didn't handle this situation well, losing his job would be the least of his worries. It could even cost him his life.

"I'm so sorry, everyone," the manager said, his voice heavy with apology. "Please come back inside and wait. We'll get you all out as soon as the police arrive."

That was all the hotel manager could do. He couldn't stop the hotel staff and guests from spreading the news beyond the hotel's walls.

The news of the explosion spread virally. Soon, the news media got wind of the incident, and many reporters gathered outside the hotel, trying to come in for interviews but were stopped by the hotel security.

On the other side, Michael and Mason also learned about what had happened.

Michael was in the midst of briefing Mason at the hospital about his recent efforts to help Isabella when Charles rushed in, interrupting them.

"Mr. Mason Williams, something bad has happened. Mr. John Williams's car exploded!" Charles said with a grave expression.

Mason, lying in bed, widened his eyes and asked anxiously, "How is John?"

Charles quickly replied, "Don't worry, Mr. Mason Williams, Mr. John Williams and Bianca weren't in the car, but his driver died in the explosion."

Mason furrowed his brows tightly and looked at Michael. He wasn't suspecting Michael of planting a bomb in John's car but wanted to hear Michael's opinion.

Michael also furrowed his brows. Despite their current rivalry, the thought of using a bomb to kill John was utterly abhorrent.

"Who do you think could have done this? I remember you were also attacked when you returned to the country. Could it be the same group? Or maybe Isabella's husband?" Mason pressed Michael, staring at him.

Michael shook his head. "There are too few clues at the moment to determine who did it. But I suspect it might be someone from the four major families. As for the motive, I think it's probably to frame me."

Mason's eyebrow arched in surprise as he regarded Michael

###chapter 252 Michael's Speculation

Michael made a bold guess that someone knew about the conflict between John and Mason. So they planned to kill John and subsequently pinned the blame on Michael.

The aim was to create the illusion of an uncle murdering his nephew for inheritance, thus sowing discord between Mason and Michael.

Upon hearing Michael's supposition, Mason nodded in concurrence.

"You make a good point. Since they might be trying to frame you, you should investigate this matter," Mason directed Michael.

Michael nodded, rising. "I got it, Mason. I'll check the hotel now."

Just as Michael was about to leave the hospital room, Charles suddenly remembered something.

"Oh, and Ms. Taylor was at the hotel today for a banquet," Charles reported. "Mr. Williams and Bianca suspected her of planting the bomb and argued with her at the entrance, but Joseph Davis intervened."

Michael paused for a moment, and Mason caught his body language, narrowing his eyes.

"Why is Isabella involved with Joseph again? Any thoughts on that, Michael?" Mason's tone sounded curious but with a hint of probing.

Michael's expression was serious. "We suspect this matter may be related to the four major families, and Joseph's appearance is very suspicious."

"Then investigate. And don't let John misunderstand Isabella again," Mason said, gesturing for Michael to leave the hospital room.

Leaving the hospital, Michael frowned. Isabella's presence at the banquet was an unexpected complication.

As Michael sat in the car, preparing to send someone to the hotel, his phone suddenly rang.

Michael glanced at the caller ID, it was Isabella calling.

Michael answered the phone and heard Isabella's helpless voice.

"Darling, I had a really bad day today. I was once again suspected by John and Bianca," Isabella sighed deeply after speaking.

Michael raised an eyebrow, knowing Isabella was talking about what happened at the banquet, but he had to pretend not to know.

"What's wrong, dear? What happened? Did you see John and Bianca again today?" Michael inquired, his tone light and reassuring.

Isabella nodded and recounted what happened at the banquet.

"I was hoping to meet some business partners at the banquet so that I could accelerate the company's development when I take over in the future. I didn't expect to encounter such a stroke of bad luck. I feel like God has been against me," Isabella said, rubbing her face helplessly.

"It's okay, dear. I'm coming for you. You'll feel better with me there," Michael said reassuringly with a smile.

Isabella immediately refused, "You must not come over. John has been investigating your identity, and if he sees you, he might find out that you work in his company. Then he will have many ways to target you."

Michael agreed right away, "Alright, I'll stay put then."

Isabella was surprised, "You agree so readily?"

Michael chuckled, "What's the alternative? We play out the whole movie and TV show routine-me insisting on coming, you turning me down, exchanging sweet words, dragging it out for half an hour, and then I finally decide not to show up. Seems like a waste of time, doesn't it?"

Isabella laughed on the other end of the phone, "Darling, you have a point. Whenever I see such plots in movies and novels, I always find them boring and silly. Your decisiveness impresses me."

"I am a business genius," Michael remarked with a hint of self-mockery.

"Yes, my husband is the ruler of a business empire! The number one on the world's rich list!" Isabella rolled her eyes and said playfully.

"The top spot on the rich list? They might not be as wealthy as I am. I keep a low profile; my face isn't plastered all over the internet," Michael mused.

Isabella shook her head with a smile, "Alright, darling, let's drop the jokes. It's not April Fool's Day. Seriously though, after everything I've told you, who do you think is behind all this? Could it be Bianca? Is she trying to set me up?"

"What do you think?" Michael responded, his voice a mirror to her contemplations.

Isabella spoke with a grave tone, "Think about it. Despite Mason and John's strained relationship, John is still the family heir. Mason must value him. Bianca orchestrated the car explosion to make me look ruthless, to suggest I'm trying to eliminate John as well. The goal? To make Mason distrust me."

Michael nodded in agreement. "You make a good point, but dear, have you considered that John and Mason are not fools? Do you really have the resources to acquire a bomb? Don't you think they'd eventually uncover the truth?"

Isabella hesitated for a moment and subconsciously nodded. "You're right, I don't have the money to buy a bomb at all. And no one would help me install it. Hold on, why do I get the feeling you're talking down to me?"

Isabella pouted in annoyance. Although Michael's words were grounded in reality, they still stung her pride.

Isabella, once a prominent heir among the four great families, had been surrounded by those eager to serve her every whim. Now, with her family's fortunes diminished, she found herself reliant on a small circle of loyal friends and her husband.

Michael also understood this. Initially, he did suspect Bianca, but upon further thought, he felt Bianca had no reason to do such a thing.

When it came to dealing with Bianca, John might seem like a fool. But when it came to his own safety, he was smarter than anyone else.

"The target of this explosion may be John, and you were just unintended influenced," Michael told Isabella the same guess he had told Mason.

Isabella was startled, "What is the motive of the killer? Is it to divide the Williams Family?"

"In the art of war, a strong enemy is best weakened by division," Michael said lightly.

###chapter 253 Furious Paxton

Isabella became a little worried after listening to Michael's speculation.

"I've never met John's uncle, don't even know his name, but from what I gather, he doesn't strike me as ruthless. I doubt he'd harm his own nephew," Isabella declared with conviction.

Michael arched an eyebrow. "So you place your trust in a man you've never met?"

"It's a feeling, a woman's intuition is very powerful. Wait a minute, dear, you're not jealous, are you?" Isabella teasingly asked.

Michael chuckled, thinking, 'Maybe a touch of jealousy before, but after talking with Benjamin last time, I felt like such a fool. Why would I be jealous of myself?'

"I won't be jealous of him. His wealth may surpass mine, but I have a treasure far more precious at my side-something he can never possess!" Michael said with a serene smile.

"What treasure are you talking about?" Isabella asked curiously.

A smile played on Michael's lips. "My greatest treasure is of course you! A beautiful, gentle, wise, and intelligent wife!"

A faint blush warmed Isabella's cheeks. Michael was at it again, showering her with compliments.

"Sweetheart," Michael grinned, "If you become some mega-tycoon, I'm retiring. You're supporting me from now on!"

Isabella responded earnestly, "And if that day comes, I'll happily support you-especially since you're handsome and fit! But you've got to take care of me, and remember to take your medicine."

Isabella's last sentence made Michael's smile freeze on his face.

After saying the last sentence, Isabella hung up the phone, and Michael could vividly imagine her non-stop laughter echoing in the room.

Michael helplessly covered his face. "Damn, I'm getting teased about this! It's not like I'm dysfunctional. I'm just pacing myself so I don't have problems later in life."

Jerr, seated in the car, his shoulders slightly trembling with his head down, looking like he was struggling to hold back laughter.

"If you want to laugh, then do so," Michael intoned helplessly.

Jerry burst into a series of laughter, holding his stomach.

After a few minutes, the laughter finally stopped.

Jerry wiped the mirth from his face, looked at Michael and said, "So, Mr. Williams, what do we do next? Mrs. Williams and John are both in that hotel. If you show up, there's a good chance you'll be recognized by both sides, and your identity will be exposed."

Michael lightly tapped his own leg. "Have someone investigate what Paxton is up to now."

Jerry was taken aback. "Mr. Williams, do you suspect Paxton's involvement in John's car explosion?"

Michael nodded. "I didn't mention Bianca in front of Mason or Isabella. This attack was probably aimed at her. We just handed over the evidence of Bianca's crimes to Paxton, and today John's car-with Bianca in it-exploded. Coincidence? I doubt it."

"Does Paxton really have the guts to do that?" Jerry queried, his expression filled with incredulity.

Jerry didn't think Paxton would actually do it. Going after Bianca alone made sense, but John was there too! Paxton and Mason had beef, and he'd threatened Isabella. But Isabella's situation was different. She wasn't really Mason's granddaughter. There could have been a deal if Isabella got hurt, but John? He was the heir. Killing him would be like starting a family war.

It would not be a wise choice for the Brown Family to confront the current number one Williams Family with their strength. If Paxton actually did this, it wouldn't be the Williamses coming after him-it'd be his own brothers and sisters.

Michael sighed lightly, rubbing his forehead. "Paxton's not usually this reckless, but as a father, he might have been driven to extremes. We need to investigate."

Jerry nodded, then took out his phone to start assigning tasks to his subordinates.

On the other side, Paxton, brooding in his study, also learned about the explosion of the car.

"Who could have done these things? What is their purpose?" It also occurred to Paxton that Michael might be framed. "Could it be the other two families? Is the goal to create conflict between John and his uncle?"

Jonah, also in the study, immediately suspected Paxton's wife, Zoey, when he heard about the car explosion.

Jonah's suspicions burned, but the fear of Paxton's wrath held him back, his face a mask of inner turmoil.

Paxton saw Jonah's conflicted expression and a bad feeling washed over him. "What is it? Do you know something about the explosion?"

Paxton squinted, his cold gaze fixed on Jonah's face.

Jonah swallowed, and finally voiced his suspicion.

"Yesterday, Mrs. Brown came to the hospital to visit Ms. Brown. I told her about my guess regarding Bianca, and at that time I noticed her emotions were off. I told Mrs. Brown to trust you and not interfere with your arrangements. She agreed at the time, but her expression was too calm, I'm worried..." Jonah's words were not finished when Paxton grabbed a vase on the table and smashed it hard on the ground.

"Do you believe everything she says? Why didn't you tell me about this right away!" Paxton was in a rage, his voice thundered with fury.

"That foolish woman! If she really did this, I can't imagine what John and his grandfather would do to our family! This'll ruin us all!" Paxton trembled with uncontrollable anger.

"Where is Zoey now? Get her back to me immediately!" Paxton roared .

Suddenly the study door burst open, and Zoey walked in.

###chapter 254 A Mother's Fury

Zoey knew she couldn't hide it anymore that she had sent someone to assassinate Bianca when she saw the news, so she decided to confess to Paxton about it. Yet, as she approached the door of the study, Paxton's voice, seething with fury, reached her ears.

Zoey pushed open the door, cool as a cucumber, and looked at Paxton, who was fuming. "No need to play detective," she said, all casual. "I did it."

Jonah's face instantly turned ashen, and Paxton, in a tempest of rage, struck Zoey across the face with a mighty blow.

"You vile creature, you're going to drag the whole family to hell! I'll kill you, you idiot!" Paxton grabbed a decoration from the table and prepared to throw it at Zoey.

"Mr. Brown, please calm down," Jonah intervened, grasping Paxton's arm with desperate strength.

"Get out of my way, don't you dare stop me, I'm going to kill this woman." Paxton, furious, tried to shake off Jonah.

With all his strength, Jonah held Paxton back. "Mr. Brown, it won't do any good to kill Mrs. Brown now. Why not hear her out? There might still be a way to fix things."

Under Jonah's control, Paxton's rage gradually subsided. He stared at Zoey and asked coldly, "Tell me, how did you arrange this?"

Zoey remained calm, seemingly unaffected by the pain on her face.

She looked at Paxton indifferently and said, "Some of the younger family members attended the banquet. I learned from them that John would bring Bianca over, so I had people disguise themselves as a bellhop and a security guard, waiting for John to arrive in his car. After John appeared, the security guard took control of the surveillance, while the bellhop distracted John's driver, and then had someone ambush in the parking lot to plant a bomb in his car."

"The surveillance was controlled? That's great, as long as the surveillance is controlled, it won't be easily discovered." Jonah sighed with a fleeting sense of reprieve.

Paxton looked coldly at Jonah and said, "It's not that simple. Where are those involved now?"

Zoey calmly replied, "After planting the bomb, they retreated. The person who detonated the bomb was not in the hotel, and he also retreated after the explosion. However, this guy seemed to have poor eyesight and detonated the bomb before Bianca got into the car."

"You should be grateful for his poor eyesight. Otherwise, we would have been doomed by now!" Paxton snorted coldly, then directed his gaze back to Jonah.

"Get rid of all the people involved in the explosion. Only the dead can keep the secret." Paxton commanded with chilling finality.

Jonah nodded immediately and set about making the necessary arrangements.

Zoey did not expect Paxton to be so ruthless. She wanted to put in a good word for those underlings, but Paxton shut her down.

"Put away your pity! If any of these people betray us, Mason will come after us for sure! Once the two families start a war, guess what the other two families will do? As the head of the family, I have to think about the fate of the entire family." Paxton angrily slammed the table.

"How ridiculous! You betrayed your own daughter and wife, yet you claimed you're thinking about the entire family!" Zoey screamed angrily, fed up with the sight of Paxton in front of her.

"You insisted on marring Pearl off to John's uncle. Do you know how humiliated Pearl was in front of Michael? She became the laughingstock of the whole city! Even though that damn guy said he was married, you still want Pearl to seduce him! Is that how you care for the family?  Do you care about Pearl's dignity at all ? And for the sake of taking the family business overseas, you actually asked me to befriend Michael's wife? Do you know how Michael humiliated your daughter!" Her words cut through the air like a blade, each one piercing Paxton's heart.

Paxton, for once, found no retort. He averted his gaze, even not daring to meet Zoey's eyes.

Tears welled in Zoey's eyes, spilling over as she continued. "Now you know that Bianca is likely the one who harmed Pearl, but what have you done? Nothing! You're just quietly waiting for some damn opportunity. When will that opportunity come? If it never comes, will you just let Pearl's suffering go unavenged? As a father, you've failed in your duty, but as a mother, I will avenge my daughter!" Zoey screamed, her eyes blazing with hateful anger.

Paxton sighed deeply, and finally sinking into the chair. "I am indeed not a qualified father. But please believe me, I will seek justice for our daughter. Those who hurt her will not go unpunished. I just hope you can temporarily stop targeting Bianca and trust me one more time. Can you do that?"

Paxton looked into Zoey's eyes, and the once elegant Zoey seemed to have aged a lot in that moment.

Zoey wiped away her tears. "Do I have a choice? Even if I refuse, you will shave someone watching me, right? Or just lock me up. Don't worry, I understand your concerns as the head of the family. This is the last time. Even if I want to target Bianca in the future, I won't be able to . John will protect her, so I'm leaving the rest to you."

Without another glance, Zoey turned and left the study.

That night, Zoey took a flight abroad, her unfinished tasks awaiting her-going shopping with Estella.

After Zoey left, Paxton asked Jonah about the fate of those participants.

Jonah reassured him, "Don't worry, Mr. Brown. Everything's been taken care of. Those three overdosed on drugs, tripped out, and accidentally blew themselves up with gas."

Paxton nodded, then said to Jonah, "Spread a rumor that John's uncle plotted to kill John to seize the family property. Remember! Be meticulous; no one must trace it back to us."

Jonah nodded once more and set to work

On the other hand, Michael was at home preparing dinner for Isabella.

Suddenly, Michael received a phone call.

"Mr. Williams, just got the news that three people died in an explosion due to a gas leak today. According to the investigation, the location of the explosion was within the Brown Family's territory," Jerry said on the phone.

Michael nodded indifferently. "Have the identities of those three people been confirmed?"

Jerry replied, "No, the fire from the explosion burned their faces and fingerprints. Their identities cannot be confirmed. The police can only infer that these three people overdosed on drugs, had hallucinations, and accidentally ignited the gas based on some drug residues at the scene."

###chapter 255 Jasper's Phone

Michael pretty much figured that those poor souls who met their end were likely the ones who planted the bombs in John's ride.

"It seems like my previous guess was right. It's very likely that Paxton did it. Did I really underestimate a father's love for his daughter?" Michael mused, his brow furrowing.

Meanwhile, Jerry said on the phone, "And, Mr. Williams, we got some inside info from our source in the Brown Family. It seems like Paxton had a fight with his wife. His wife Zoey went abroad tonight, probably to see Ms. Foster. Regrettably, our source isn't well-placed to listen in at the door."

"Could it be Paxton's wife who did it?" Michael was surprised, as he didn't know much about Zoey.

"Anyway, whoever did it, it's all related to Paxton. Keep a close eye on him," Michael instructed, concluding the call..

Shortly after Michael and Jerry ended their call, the sound of brakes echoed outside the mansion. Moments later, Isabella entered with an air of effortless grace.

"Darling, did you make something delicious today? I'm starving." Isabella took off her bag and coat, placing them on the coat rack.

Isabella walked into the kitchen and hugged Michael around the waist.

Pointing to the oven, Michael revealed, "We're having baked fish today! Trust me, it will be exquisite."

As Isabella breathed in the delightful scent wafting from the oven, she nodded in satisfaction. "It seems almost ready. I can't wait."

Michael ruffled Isabella's hair and grinned. "So, when the police were questioning you at the hotel, didn't they feed you?"

Isabella shook her head. ""They did have food, but no one dared eat it. After all, a heir of a big family nearly got assassinated there, who knows if there's poison in the food? Besides, the food made by the hotel isn't that good. I prefer eating at home."

Michael watched Isabella, then asked, "So, did John and Bianca keep questioning you the whole time?"

Isabella shook her head again. "Once those two entered the room, they never came out again. They had eight bodyguards guarding the door-clearly afraid for their lives. I heard even the police had to be searched before entering! I wonder if that experience will leave the officers traumatized."

Michael chuckled, realizing that it was usually the police who searched others, but now the police were being searched by others.

"Darling, do you think someone is really trying to divide the Mason family?" Isabella asked seriously.

Michael denied, "Darling, you're asking the wrong person. After all, I'm not part of this family. But Mason, John, and John's uncle are all very smart people. Maybe they have already seen through each other's schemes."

"You're right. I should call Mason and talk to him about this." Isabella was about to take out her phone but was stopped by Michael.

Isabella's eyes, filled with a blend of curiosity and confusion, met Michael's steady gaze.

Michael said calmly, "Honey, slow down. It's getting late, Mason's probably resting. And besides, he might have figured out what you've guessed already. Bringing it up again won't help. Let's wait a bit and see him at the hospital."

Michael felt helpless. Although he had Estella impersonate his wife, Mason's suspicions had never truly abated.

The only thing Michael could do was limit how much Isabella and Mason interacted. Luckily, Isabella didn't want anyone to know her husband's identity, so she never shared any details about him. As a result, Mason still didn't know her husband's name.

"Darling, you're right. Do you think this will mess with my chances of getting the shares?" Isabella asked.

Michael stroked his forehead, pondered for a moment, and then nodded. "It could have some impact. After all, Mason promised to help you get the shares, but he's quite old and can only pass this on to his nephew. With John being assassinated, Mason might reduce the assistance he provides you."

After thinking for a while, Isabella denied the idea. "Actually, this will also affect John. If he truly believes these speculations, he will definitely allocate some resources to guard against his uncle! This will also lessen the support he gives to Bianca. For both sides, it creates a strange balance."

Michael drew Isabella into an embrace, placing a tender kiss on her cheek. "Darling, you're really smart."

Isabella drew a circle on Michael's chest with her hand. "Darling, my period will end in two days."

Michael's breathing suddenly became rapid, and at that moment, a beep came from the oven.

"Let's enjoy our meal," Isabella smiled, put on heat-resistant gloves, and took out the fish from the oven.

While Isabella and Michael were having dinner, John and Bianca had already gotten into a new car.

The car, driven by a vigilant bodyguard, had undergone meticulous inspection to ensure it was free of danger, with even the windows being bulletproof.

"Darling, do you really think Isabella did this?" John squinted his eyes.

Bianca hesitated for a moment and shook her head. "I don't know if it was her. If it really was, then Isabella is getting more and more ruthless."

"Do you think there's a possibility that my uncle did this, and his goal is to seize control of the family business?" John looked at Bianca with a smile.

Bianca's eyes widened in shock as she looked at John. "Darling, are you joking? Could it really be your uncle?"

John suddenly laughed, "It couldn't be him. My uncle would hit me, scold me, but he would never resort to such measures. Perhaps the real culprit wants me to think this way. Someone is trying to sow discord within our family."

John narrowed his eyes, suspecting many possible culprits in his mind.

At that moment, Bianca's phone suddenly rang.

She glanced at the screen, noticing an unfamiliar number. She answered it and froze upon hearing Jasper's voice.

###chapter 256 Jasper Appears

When Bianca received a call from Jasper, she remained motionless for several seconds before reacting.

She quickly shouted into the phone, "Jasper, where are you right now?"

Sitting beside her, John paused for a moment upon hearing Bianca's shout, then quickly leaned in to listen to the phone.

In the shadowed recesses beneath a bridge, Jasper, clad in a black jacket, was completely hidden in the darkness.

"I can't tell you where I am right now. I can't guarantee if your phone is being tapped. Have John call me back on this line later," Jasper said indifferently before hanging up the phone.

Bianca frowned as the call ended. She looked at John beside her, her gaze seeking his advice.

John immediately dialed the number again, and soon, Jasper's voice came through the phone.

"I didn't expect you to react so quickly. It seems you're right next to Bianca," Jasper said lightly with a smile.

John, not in the mood for small talk, coldly responded, "You didn't tell me about embezzling so much money from the company."

Jasper didn't care about John's accusation and said with a smile, "This family's fate is sealed. Rather than wasting money on a lost cause, it's better to keep it for ourselves."

John squinted and asked on the phone, "Have you made up your mind?"

Jasper nodded on the other end of the line, his tone becoming very serious. "I don't have much time to waste with you. I need to leave this country. If you want shares, I can sign a contract with you, but you have to give me money and help me leave the country."

"You think you can mess with me and still make demands?" John said with a cold smile, shocked by Jasper's nerve.

Jasper's voice grew colder. "Mr. Williams, the amount of money I need is nothing for you. This shouldn't be an issue. If you don't want the shares, I can go to Mason. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to snap up my shares."

With that final declaration, Jasper ended the call, knowing that John wouldn't want Mason to have the shares. He remained by the river, enveloped in the stillness of the night, awaiting John's inevitable response.

Soon, Jasper's phone rang, and a smug smile appeared on his face.

"It seems Mr. Williams has made a decision. Have you agreed to my terms?" Jasper asked with a smile.

With a cold expression, John clutched the phone and intoned, "Give me a location. I'll send someone to meet you and sign the contract. They will also help you leave the country."

"Fine. Meet me at the Moonlit Lounge in Coral Haven Port at 3:00 AM," Jasper said curtly, and hung up.

Jasper stared at the gloomy river, his face a mask of grim determination. Betrayed by his wife and daughter, he had nothing left now. He needed to skip the country with that embezzled cash, but being on the run, he couldn't do it alone. So he'd gone to John for help.

"I'm not some powerless, vengeful loser. Once I leave this country, I'll leave behind my wife and daughter, start a new family, and not cause any trouble for you," Jasper murmured with a cold smile, then rose and made his way toward the Moonlit Lounge.

Meanwhile, in a dimly lit apartment, a man was bound to a chair, his body and the chair securely fixed with tape, making it impossible for him to break free. His mouth was gagged with a piece of cloth and taped shut, rendering him unable to call for help.

The man struggled to move the chair with all his might, but his efforts only caused only the slightest movement of the chair.

Finally, as the man was running out of strength, he managed to reach the stereo.

With one last effort, he pushed the chair over, hitting the switch on the stereo with his head.

Loud music blared from the stereo as the man lay on the ground, waiting quietly.

Due to the late hour, the loud noise irritated the neighbors. Some came to knock on the door to ask him to lower the volume, while others called the police.

Soon, the police arrived, but no matter how hard they knocked, there was no response from inside.

In the end, amidst strong protests from the surrounding residents, the police were compelled to force entry.

As the door was kicked open, the police saw the scene inside the room, and the man who was tied up flashed a hint of relief in his eyes. He was finally rescued.

"What's going on here?" the officer asked as he untied the man.

The man shouted in anger, "It's Jasper! I'm his assistant, and that bastard stole my phone, my clothes, and my wallet!"

The two officers exchanged worried glances and quickly escorted the assistant back to the station.

On the other side, Michael was sleeping in bed with Isabella when suddenly his phone rang, causing Isabella, who was half asleep, to frown and squirm in Michael's arms.

"Who is it, dear? Who's calling you so late?" Isabella murmured in Michael's arms.

Michael also frowned as he picked up the phone from the bedside and glanced at the display.

"It's Jerry calling. Must be something urgent, or he wouldn't call at this hour," Michael explained before answering the call.

Jerry knew about the relationship between Michael and Isabella, so he wasn't worried about Jerry exposing his identity.

Isabella, with languid grace, fluttered her eyelids open, holding onto Michael, listening to Jerry's voice coming through the phone.

"Mr. Williams, just got word from the police station that Jasper's assistant was kidnapped by Jasper. Jasper broke into his home, stole a phone, some money, and a piece of clothing. Jasper's assistant has been rescued and is currently giving a statement at the police station," Jerry said urgently.

Isabella and Michael, their senses now fully roused, exchanged a glance laden with silent concern.

"And what about my father? Did his assistant mention where he went?" Isabella asked.

Jerry on the other end of the line paused for a moment, realizing that Michael and Isabella should be sleeping together at this time.

"I'm sorry, Mrs. Williams. Still no news about your father. After Jasper robbed his assistant, tied him up, and questioned him about recent events, he left. We suspect he might call John, so we investigated the assistant's call records and found a call to Bianca," Jerry reported over the phone.

Isabella, now fully alert, leaning against the bed with the covers, contemplating seriously about what to do next.

Meanwhile, Michael gave direct orders to Jerry, "Keep a close eye on John!"

Isabella and Michael weren't fools; they quickly caught on to Jasper's intentions. He was clearly planning to sell his shares to John and use John's influence to escape the country.

Jerry had already figured this out before he called Michael. However, the information he received left him feeling uneasy. The informant he had planted near John had been dismissed. According to the intel, John hadn't discovered his presence yet, but he had gathered a group of his most trusted associates, clearly gearing up for something significant.
###chapter 257 Paxton's Calculations

Jerry hung up the phone right after saying "yes."

Meanwhile, Michael noticed the furrowed brow of Isabella and asked, "Are you worried that John and Bianca will find your father before us?"

Isabella nodded solemnly, her tone serious as she said, "Knowing my father, the first thing he would do after getting a phone is to contact John and Bianca. He'll for sure tell John to ring him ASAP to plan his escape. And John will be extra cautious because everyone knows we are watching him."

Michael nodded in understanding, acknowledging Isabella's concerns, but he remained confident in his team.

"Don't worry, my dear. We'll just have to wait it out. None of us have a clue where Jasper is hiding. John's not giving anything away, so we'll have to tail him," Michael reassured Isabella, offering a comforting pat on her shoulder.

Glancing at the time, Isabella saw it was 1 A.M. She wasn't sure if she should call Mason for help at this hour. She had more confidence in Mason than in Michael's subordinates, especially against John's team.

Michael saw the doubt clouding Isabella's face, which made him a bit frustrated. His subordinates were in no way inferior to John's.

"Do you want to call Mason? Maybe not, he's probably asleep at this time. Mason isn't in the best health, let him rest. And don't call Charles either, he's not much younger than Mason. Dear, please trust me. The people I've brought in are highly skilled, definitely not inferior to John's subordinates," Michael said earnestly.

Isabella looked at Michael and suddenly felt a strong sense of trust in him. She couldn't explain why, but she trusted her instincts.

"Of course, dear, I trust you. But I can't sleep now, looks like we'll be sleepless tonight." Isabella sighed, got out of bed, and started changing clothes.

"Let's get dressed in case we receive any updates. We can get to the scene as quickly as possible." After Isabella finished speaking, Michael also got out of bed and started getting dressed.

On the other side, Paxton, who had just finished dealing with family matters, was preparing to rest in bed when Jonah suddenly burst into his bedroom.

"Mr. Brown, there's news about Jasper." Jonah promptly relayed the information he received from the police station.

Paxton sat on the edge of the bed, his fingers rhythmically tapping his knee, his eyes narrowed in contemplation.

"This might be our chance." Paxton murmured in a low voice.

Jonah didn't quite understand what Paxton was thinking and could only look at him in confusion.

A faint smile appeared on Paxton's lips. "My wife almost killed John. Although they haven't found out who did it yet, it might come back to me eventually. What we need to do now is to give John some trouble! Shift his focus a bit."

""Wait, Mr. Brown, are you saying we should tail John, find Jasper, and get into a showdown with them?" Jonah questioned, clearly puzzled.

Paxton nodded, his smile widening. "Precisely. But this time, we need to change our approach. Instead of hiding in the shadows, we should openly send people to seize Jasper! Let our people be exposed to everyone!"

Jonah was shocked by Paxton's proposal.

"Mr. Brown, do you know what you're suggesting? Showing up suddenly at this time will make everyone suspicious of us!" Jonah exclaimed.

Paxton still had that faint smile on his face. "That's exactly what I want! We have identified the traitors hidden in our family, right? Let's drop a hint to them, claiming Jasper's father left some massive secret that could revive their family's lost prestige."

Jonah immediately understood Paxton's meaning, and a smile appeared on his face, dispelling his previous worries.

"I get it, Mr. Brown. You're suggesting we stir up this rumor, make it seem like we're all in for Jasper, just to spark interest from the other families! It'll push the other two families to act simultaneously! If everyone's after John, it'll naturally split his focus, leaving him no extra energy to dig into the car explosion incident." Jonah looked at Paxton with admiration. Paxton's plan was truly cunning.

Paxton's grin widened as he gestured with his hand. "Now that you're in the loop, start setting things in motion to locate Jasper pronto. I'm itching to see if the Taylor Family truly holds this secret."

Jonah nodded and left Paxton's bedroom.

The Brown Family's extensive mobilization caught the attention of the other families. Michael got wind of the Brown Family's actions but smoothly slipped away from Isabella, pretending he needed a bathroom break.

"So, Paxton sent out a lot of people tonight? What is he up to?" Michael asked with a furrowed brow.

The subordinate on the phone reported, "Our informant within the Brown Family says there are whispers about Jasper having some secret that could bring the family back from the brink, and Paxton is very interested in this secret, so he sent people to seize the shares."

Michael narrowed his eyes and then smirked. "Sending so many people for an unknown secret is clearly sending a signal. It seems Paxton is deliberately shifting the conflict elsewhere."

The subordinate on the phone agreed, "Mr. Williams, I also think there's something fishy about this because the source of this information came too easily. Paxton doesn't seem to have any intention of hiding this information, and now everyone in the Brown Family knows. The informants from the other families hidden in the Brown Family probably know too."

"I see. Keep an eye on Paxton's side, and call me immediately if there's any news." Michael responded calmly before hanging up the phone.

"Is he tryin' to drag the other families into this mess? Paxton, you sly old dog." A cold smile spread across Michael's lips.

###chapter 258 A Deal with Mia

Michael had figured out Paxton's plan, but he had no intention of stopping it.

Why bother? Paxton's actions were aimed at his nephew John, who was now Michael's competitor. What harm in letting John face some trouble?

When Michael walked out of the bathroom, he found Isabella sitting on the couch.

The TV in the living room flickered, its sound just a background hum. Isabella's mind was elsewhere, seeking distraction in the ambient noise.

Michael walked to the coffee maker, brewed two cups, and brought them over.

"Honey, have some coffee," Michael said, placing a cup in front of Isabella.

"Thanks," Isabella replied with a faint smile, lifting the cup to her lips and sipping slowly.

"You know, you used to be so confident. But now, I don't see that confidence on your face," Michael teased, wrapping an arm around her.

Isabella gave a bitter smile. "I was confident before, but my father's sudden appearance threw me off. Now I get it-plans never keep up with changes."

Michael gently stroked Isabella's hair. "Let's look at it from a different angle. As your father's daughter, have you thought about where he might be hiding? People tend to stay in familiar places to calm themselves down."

Isabella furrowed her brows slightly. "I'm sorry, hon. From what I remember, my dad's always been at the company or the villa. I've been abroad for so long, so I don't really know if he has any other places around here."

As Isabella spoke, she suddenly paused, thinking of her mother, Mia. Mia had been with Jasper and probably knew more about him than she did.

"Hey, let's head to the detention center. I need to talk to Mia! She might know where Jasper is." Isabella's mood did a 180, all hyped up now.

Michael nodded, grabbing the car keys, and they headed to the garage together.

Minutes later, at the detention center, Mia sat across from her daughter and son-in-law in the interrogation room.

"Mom, I need you to tell me where Dad might be hiding. It's really important to us." Isabella stared at Mia intently.

Mia was surprisingly calm. After her husband's betrayal and her own betrayal of him, a strange peace had settled over her. She didn't crave much anymore-just enough money to get by after she got out.

"My dear daughter, I can help you with this, but what's it worth to you?" Mia asked, a sly smile playing on her lips.

Isabella furrowed her brows. "I hired a lawyer for you, paid your fine, what else do you want from me?"

Mia threw her hands up. "I want money, not a ton, just ten million bucks! If the info I give you really helps you nab your dad, then you gotta pay me that reward!"

"Are you out of your mind? How on earth am I supposed to rustle up ten million bucks for you?" Isabella sprang from her chair, her anger reaching a boiling point. She had barely scraped together three million over the years.

Michael, on the other hand, stayed calm and nodded. "Alright, if your info really leads us to Jasper, I can give you ten million."

Isabella turned to Michael, her eyes wide with shock.

Mia gave Michael a frosty look, her voice laced with skepticism. "Why should I trust you? I don't recall you swimming in cash."

"I'm richer than you think. I can wire the ten million straight to you." Michael pulled out his phone and started tapping away.

A few moments later, he showed the screen to Mia.

Mia's eyes widened a bit when she saw the transfer interface. The bank card on the screen was hers, and it showed a deposit of five million dollars.

"That's five million as a down payment. You'll get the other five million once we catch Jasper," Michael said casually, shrugging like it was no big deal.

A smile spread across Mia's face. "It seems I underestimated you. Alright, give me a sec to think about where Jasper might be."

She closed her eyes, her brow knitting in concentration.

Minutes ticked by, the silence growing heavy, even testing Isabella's patience. Then, suddenly, Mia's eyes flew open.

"I got it! Moonlit Lounge. That's probably where your dad is!" Mia rattled off the address to Isabella.

Isabella frowned. "How come I never knew my dad was still into the bar scene?"

Mia chuckled and shrugged. "There's a lot you don't know. Back when your dad was in college, he was a total hippie, always messing around. He and some buddies started a band, and their first gig was at Moonlit Lounge. He loved that place so much he ended up buying it. But it's way out in the sticks, so not many people go there, and it kinda fell apart over time. I haven't heard him talk about it in years, but whenever he's feeling down, he heads there to chill. Middle-aged guys, you know, they've got their own ways of dealing with stuff."

While Mia was talking, Michael had already pulled up the location of Moonlit Lounge on his phone.

"Babe, I found it. Let's roll." Michael grabbed Isabella's hand, and they left the room."

Mia watched the two leave and called out from behind, "Hey, don't forget our deal! If you really find Jasper, make sure I get the rest of that five million dollars."

Once Isabella and Michael were in the car, Isabella turned to Michael with a puzzled look. "Where'd you get five million dollars from?"

Michael grinned. "I got it from my dad! He can easily come up with not just five million, but even fifty million if he wanted to."

Isabella looked like she wanted to say something, but she just sighed. "I really don't want your dad getting mixed up in this."

Michael gently patted her head. "If you wanna pay him back, just give him a grandson soon."

###chapter 259 Body Double

Just as Isabella and Michael were about to leave, on the other side, John was already prepared.

"Alright, listen up. Your job is to keep those damn tailers off my back. Don't let them figure out what I'm really up to," John ordered, his voice cold and commanding.

"Got it, Mr. Williams," his subordinates replied in unison, their tone respectful.

The people standing before John were dressed and groomed to look just like him. They were meticulously disguised to throw off anyone who might be watching.

"My love, do you really have to go alone? Let me come with you. I'm worried about you," Bianca pleaded, her voice trembling with concern.

John took Bianca's hand and kissed it softly. "Sweetheart, I don't know what kind of trouble I might run into tonight. It's safer if you stay here and wait for me. If anything happened to you, I'd be devastated."

Bianca bit her lip, tears welling up in her eyes. "I understand, my love. I'll be here waiting for you."

With that, John waved and got into the car with his team.

Bianca stood on the balcony on the second floor, watching John's car disappear into the distance. She clenched her fists, silently praying for his safety.

As John's convoy drove out of the winery gates, his earpiece crackled to life with the voices of his lookalikes.

"Mr. Williams, I've been made."

"Damn, me too."

"I've got two cars tailing me. How about you?"

"Three cars on my tail. Guess I'm the most convincing Mr. Williams!"

Laughter and playful banter echoed through the earpiece.

John ignored the chatter from his team. They'd been under a lot of pressure lately, especially after the recent car bombing. They needed this moment to blow off some steam.

Hearing the updates through his earpiece, a faint smile crossed John's lips. "They're taking me seriously, sending all this surveillance."

Meanwhile, the people tailing John were getting confused.

"What's going on? Two Johns?"

"Did I take too many pills, or am I seeing things?"

"You morons, there's only one real John. The rest are decoys. How can you not figure that out?"

Someone cursed over the earpiece, and the realization finally hit them-they were dealing with decoys.

Michael, driving towards the Moonlit Lounge, got a call from Jerry.

"Mr. Williams, John hired seven lookalikes. Our guys are scattered, and we can't tell which one's the real deal," Jerry reported.

Michael, tapping the steering wheel thoughtfully, asked, "I sent you an address. Can you check if any of those eight Johns are heading that way?"

Michael handed the phone to Isabella to send the information.

After Isabella sent the message to Jerry, she waited patiently for his response.

Soon, the phone rang again, and Isabella answered immediately.

"Hey, Jerry, did you get it?" Isabella asked eagerly.

Jerry was surprised to hear Isabella's voice, but he didn't dwell on it.

"Yeah, Mrs. Williams, it's confirmed. There's a John heading to the Moonlit Lounge," Jerry reported.

A smile spread across Isabella's face, and Michael tapped the steering wheel excitedly.

"Looks like we were right," Isabella said to Michael, her smile beaming.

"So, what now? Should we call back the other trackers?" Jerry asked.

Isabella thought for a moment and shook her head. "No, we can't do that. If we pull them back, John will know his plan's been busted. He might even call my dad to get out of there."

"Then what do we do?" Jerry asked.

Michael and Isabella exchanged a knowing look and smiled.

"Call the cops!" they said together.

"Call the cops?" Jerry asked, unsure. He knew Michael usually avoided involving the police.

Michael rolled his eyes, knowing exactly what Jerry was thinking. "Of course, call the cops. Have you forgotten Jasper's a wanted criminal?"

"But if the cops nab Jasper, John could totally cut a deal with him in prison, right? Wouldn't that be helping John out?" Jerry hesitated as he spoke on the phone.

Isabella chuckled, her voice light but confident. "Jerry, don't forget we've got Mason backing us. Anything John can do, Mason can do too. And if I'm not mistaken, my dad's condition for John is to get out of the country. Plus, my dad's stipulation for John is to leave the country. If Jasper lands in prison, any deals between him and John will vanish. So, no need to worry about that."

"Mr. and Mrs. Williams are really sharp. I'll call the police now," Jerry said, then hung up.

Meanwhile, Paxton lay restless, waiting for Jonah's reply.

Jonah's call soon broke the tension.

"Mr. Brown, our team tracking John has found several decoys. We can't tell which one is the real him," Jonah reported.

Paxton smirked. "Just a cheap trick. We've got plenty of people out there. He can split up all he wants! There's always one right way! Keep a close eye on our folks, and make some noise. If John's guys want to tangle with ours, don't hold back. Just fight them!"

Jonah agreed and hung up.

Isabella and Michael, who were about to reach the Moonlit Lounge, received another call from Jerry.

"Mr. Williams, Mrs. Williams, we've detected signs of a third party, and according to the investigation, it's very likely to be Paxton's people," Jerry said over the phone.

"Paxton? Is he tracking John too? Why is he doing this? Could he be after my father's location too?" Isabella was puzzled about Paxton's intentions.

###chapter 260 Battle!

Michael's eyes lit up for a moment, like he had just cracked the code to Paxton's intentions.

"Jerry, change of plans. Pull our people back and let John's crew and Paxton's crew duke it out," Michael said, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Jerry gave a quick nod and hung up the phone.

Isabella, with her eyes locked on Michael, asked, "Babe, did you figure something out?"

Michael nodded. "Just a hunch. Paxton must've caught wind of you and Bianca fighting over the family shares. It probably sounds crazy to him since those companies seem worthless. So, he must think there's some hidden secret in those three companies. That's why he wants Jasper. He thinks Jasper's got the key to the whole thing."

"Is he really chasing after a secret that might not even be real? Has Paxton lost his mind?" Isabella couldn't believe what she was hearing.

Michael knew it sounded far-fetched, so he tried to explain Paxton's motives a bit more.

"Remember when your family fell apart? Only the Williams family stayed out of it, but the Larsons and Davises swiped a huge piece of your pie. Even though Paxton and his crew took some of your family's stuff and became one of the new Big Four, their background is still way weaker than the other three! So, whether this secret is real or not, Paxton's gonna want to take a shot at it," Michael explained, helping Isabella understand Paxton's motives.

Isabella nodded, taking in Michael's analysis. "You're right. With the domestic market shares almost evenly split among the Big Four, the only option left is the overseas market. Paxton had Pearl marry John's uncle to use his influence to break into that market. I guess I underestimated how far he'd go for his family's future."

"Exactly, babe. Don't stress about Paxton's plans. It's not our problem how he acts, since we're working from the shadows. Let John and Paxton go at each other. When they're busy fighting, we'll swoop in and take advantage," Michael said with a sly grin, a glint of cunning in his eyes.

Meanwhile, John and his team noticed something off about the cars tailing them.

"Hey, did you guys notice there are more cars following us now?"

"Yeah, it was just three cars before. Now it's six. What's going on?"

"They've sent more reinforcements! What do we do now? Should we call for backup too?"

"Damn it! They're ramming our cars. Are they really bold enough to mess with Mr. Williams' ride?"

"Did you, you moron, lose your wig and blow our cover?!"

Laughter crackled through John's earpiece again, but his face remained stone-cold, his eyes icy.

In the rearview mirror, John saw several cars tailing them. He knew if he wanted to reach Jasper, he couldn't let these pursuers ruin his plan.

"Alright, everyone, lead these cars to the trap location and teach them a lesson they won't forget," John ordered, his voice cold and commanding.

The lack of manpower over the past few days had infuriated him. As the heir to a powerful family, he wasn't used to such incompetence.

"Finally, we get to fight."

"My gun's been itching for some action."

"I can't wait to twist their heads off and kick 'em around like soccer balls."

"Just make sure when you kick him, he doesn't bite your foot! Haha."

The voices in the earpiece were filled with excitement, showing that John's team didn't take the pursuers lightly. They were confident because they were all highly trained, unlike the rookies they were up against.

Meanwhile, the Brown Family's team following John's convoy sensed something was off.

Originally, Michael's crew was tailing John, but they suddenly veered off onto another route, ditching the pursuit.

When the Brown Family's team reported this to Jonah, he quickly figured out that someone was pitting them against John.

Normally, Jonah wouldn't want to get involved in something so reckless, but with Paxton's orders, he had no choice but to take it seriously.

"Mr. Clarke, John's convoy is slowing down. They might've reached their destination, or they could be setting up an ambush," a subordinate said, trying to keep his voice steady.

Jonah nodded and grabbed his phone to give orders. "Alright, everyone, stay sharp. Fight back if they attack, but your lives come first. You're the family's most valuable asset."

After the call, Jonah hung up. Their family's position, not as strong as the other three, meant they had to constantly reinforce loyalty and courage. Otherwise, who would be willing to put their lives on the line for them?

The Brown Family team, now on high alert, checked their weapons with meticulous care. Knives were sharpened, pistols loaded. Everyone was bracing for the inevitable showdown.

When the first decoy car reached the ambush spot and stopped, the Brown Family team following behind also parked their cars. They got out, weapons in hand, and cautiously approached, ready for whatever was coming.

Suddenly, a bunch of bright lights flicked on around them, making them squint and shield their eyes.

"Get these jerks! Charge!" someone yelled from the shadows, and figures with weapons rushed forward under the spotlights.

Despite the initial shock, the Brown Family team quickly pulled themselves together.

"Let's show these idiots what we're made of!" one of them shouted, raising their weapon. The rest followed suit, and the two sides clashed.

The air was filled with the sounds of knives slicing through fabric, gunshots ringing out, and the cries of the wounded.

The fight was bloody and brutal right from the start. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, the real John finally pulled up to the Moonlit Lounge and parked the car.

###chapter 261 Hide and Watch

John's convoy to Moonlit Lounge originally had three cars, but now only one remained.

The other two cars were in the back helping to obstruct the Brown Family's pursuit.

Unperturbed by the threat of being followed, John adjusted his attire with deliberate calm and strode into the entrance of the Moonlit Lounge, flanked by his two vigilant bodyguards.

On the roof of a bungalow near Moonlit Lounge, two people were lying prone, using binoculars to observe this side.

These two people were Isabella and Michael.

"Honey, where are your people? Why not call them over too? Now John only has two bodyguards by his side. If we have more people, we might seize the chance to snatch Jasper," Isabella said, feeling a bit excited.

Michael rolled his eyes. "Seriously, honey? Those bodyguards are armed. Do you think a judge would convict John if he actually shot someone? My employees were only paid a few thousand dollars-it's not worth their lives."

Isabella thought for a moment and agreed with Michael. John's bodyguards might be armed, so it wouldn't be wise to barge in at this moment.

However, at that moment, several cars arrived outside the Moonlit Lounge, and a group of people got out of the cars.

Isabella noticed these people and frowned, saying, "Are these people also John's subordinates? They seem similarly dressed."

Michael glanced at them and recognized his own subordinates, though he kept this from Isabella.

"I don't think so. Haven't you noticed how alert they were when they arrived? John has sent people to handle the pursuers, but these guys aren't offering any assistance," Michael analyzed.

"Then who sent them?" Isabella's curiosity was piqued.

Michael's eyes narrowed with a calculated gleam. "Come on, isn't it obvious? Other than John, only his uncle could have organized such a large group. If it's him behind this, it means Mason is already in the loop, and that puts us in a favorable position!"

Isabella's eyes lit up. "You're right. I'll give Mason a call."

Isabella walked to the side and dialed Mason's number, and this time Michael didn't stop her.

Mason was still awake and had indeed received the news of Jasper's appearance.

Isabella recounted what she saw to Mason, and based on their clothing, he deduced that the men belonged to Michael. He then verified Isabella's suspicion.

After Isabella and Mason finished their call, Mason immediately called Michael to further confirm the situation here, but the call failed to connect.

"Why can't I reach him?" Mason furrowed his brow slightly, feeling a strange suspicion creeping in.

"Are Isabella and Michael together now?" Mason squinted his eyes and prepared to call Isabella again.

Meanwhile, Michael, looking at his phone that was previously turned off, said to Isabella, "Since it's confirmed that these people are sent by Mason and his nephew, let's turn off our phones to avoid attracting their attention with sound or light."

Isabella nodded and turned off her phone, which also resulted in Mason not being able to reach her.

"Both of them turned off their phones. Isn't that too much of a coincidence?" Mason's worry grew deeper.

Inside the bar.

John walked into the Moonlit Lounge. Despite its weathered exterior, the interior was remarkably clean. The vintage tables and chairs, though old, were neatly arranged, evoking a sense of a past era.

Two bodyguards flanked John, their eyes vigilant, scanning the dimly lit room.

Just then, a beam of light suddenly shone on the stage of the bar, and the two bodyguards immediately shielded John protectively.

In the center of the light was Jasper, a guitar cradled in his hands.

Jasper plucked the guitar strings lightly, producing a soft sound. He did not continue, but instead, his gaze met John's with a knowing smile.

"Mr. Williams is always on time," Jasper grinned at John, setting the guitar down carefully.

John pushed aside the bodyguards with a cold face. "I'm not here for a performance. Let's get the contract signed."

"Believe me, Mr. Williams, my impatience rivals your own. However, before we finalize the contract, may I offer you a drink?" Jasper went behind the bar, selected a bottle of liquor, and poured two glasses.

Jasper drank the liquor of the glass in one gulp and said nostalgically, "This bar used to be my favorite place when I was young, but now it's dilapidated. Nothing can withstand the erosion of time."

John approached the counter but didn't touch the glass. Instead, he took two copies of the contract from the bodyguards.

"Sign your name now, and you can go," John commanded indifferently.

Jasper casually glanced at one of the contracts. "I can sign my name, but how much are you willing to pay me?"

John's laughter held no amusement. "You're asking me for money? You embezzled vast sums of public funds, and now your only concern is escaping the country to enjoy your ill-gotten gains. And you dare to ask me for money?"

Jasper's smile was faint, almost imperceptible. "No one would complain about having too much money, right? Mr. Williams. Greed is the most human of traits."

Jasper tapped his temple lightly, the gesture laden with unspoken meaning.

John's face darkened. "If I don't want to give you money, I can still make you sign this, like sending you to jail. I have a hundred ways to make you comply."

Jasper also sneered. "I guess your grandfather thought the same way! Competition drives the market. Although likening oneself to a commodity seems cheap, I don't mind."

John narrowed his eyes, his clenched fist showing his inner anger. He slammed the counter hard and then took out a black card from his wallet.

"This is from our family's bank. With this card, you can withdraw the money inside from any bank in any country. The amount of money on this card is more than what you embezzled," John declared, tossing the card onto the counter.

Jasper's eyes gleamed as he picked up the card, pressing it to his lips. "Generosity suits you, Mr. Williams. I'll sign."

Just then, things took an unexpected turn.

###chapter 262 Hit Me? Dare You.

A bullet shattered a bottle behind the counter, and the liquor inside flowed down the bar.

The two bodyguards, as if by instinct, positioned themselves protectively before John, while raising the handguns in their hands.

Ten men in black suits walked in from outside, and Jasper was stunned when he saw the leader of them.

"It's you! You're the young man who picked us up at the detention center that day," Jasper pointed at Mike and shouted loudly.

A smile, enigmatic and composed, played on Mike's lips as he bowed in greetings.

"Mr. Taylor, long time no see. Why are you hiding in such a rundown bar drinking now?" Mike asked with a teasing lilt.

Jasper's face darkened. John's reaction clearly showed that Mike wasn't his subordinate.

Although John's face was grim, he remained calm as he turned to Mike and queried, "You work for Michael, right?"

Mike nodded, bowing to John as well. After the gesture, he looked at John and said respectfully, "We are in your uncle's employ, Mr. Williams. We would appreciate it if you could give us the man behind you. Your uncle and grandfather really need that contract."

John looked at him coldly and asked, "What if I refuse?"

Mike shrugged, sounding helpless as he said, ""Looks like we'll have to force him out of here. Hey, it's family business, and you're the heir, so we wouldn't touch you."

"How considerate" John replied, his tone dripping with sarcasm.

Mike chuckled. "Mr. Williams, you have two subordinates here, while we have ten people. The odds, as you see, are in our favor."

John, unmoved, lifted a glass from the table and took a sip. "Sometimes, it's not about the numbers."

As John finished speaking, the two bodyguards took off their suits, unbuttoning their shirts' cuffs and collars.

These two strong bodyguards exuded a strong presence just from their physique.

Mike's expression tightened, a flicker of reluctance crossing his face. "It appears I am in for two challenges," he murmured.

With a swift motion, he drew his handgun from his waistband and placed it on the table beside him.

"We're all family here, so let's not use guns this time. How about a little hand-to-hand combat?" Mike suggested to John with a smile.

With a casual wave, John signaled his bodyguards, who relinquished their handguns and advanced slowly towards Mike and his group.

Mike took on an attacking stance and said lightly, "Believe me, gentlemen, I can dance with you all day!"

"Do you think you're tough?" one of the bodyguards smirked, then charged and sent Mike flying.

Mike's body arched in the air, landing with a crash upon a chair, which splintered beneath him.

Struggling to get up, Mike held his back in pain and exclaimed, "Damn it, I didn't even say start yet, why are you standing there? Get him!"

Mike's subordinates rushed towards the two bodyguards.

John only brought these two bodyguards, showing his strong confidence in them.

These two strong bodyguards did not disappoint John. Mike's subordinates were skilled, but they were easily overpowered by the bodyguards.

Watching the group being thrown around, Jasper felt a pang as they crashed into tables and chairs, destroying the setup in the bar.

"This place is full of memories for me," Jasper lamented.

John, his patience wearing thin, slammed his glass on the table.

"Why haven't you signed the contract yet? Are you trying to stall?" he demanded, his gaze turning menacingly towards Jasper.

"My apologies, I got distracted. I'll sign now," Jasper picked up the pen again.

But at that moment, Mike materialized behind Jasper.

Snatching the pen from Jasper, Mike broke it in half and threw it away.

"No pen now," Mike jeered, laughing at Jasper.

Jasper looked at Mike as if he was a fool, then pulled out another pen from his pocket.

Mike blinked, trying to grab the pen from Jasper, but John punched him hard in the face.

"Did my uncle not tell you? I'm also a skilled fighter. I just don't like hitting women," John declared, adopting a combative stance, his gaze fixed icily on Mike.

Clutching his injured face, Mike retorted with a bitter edge, "Actually, I'm transgender. I have always identified as a woman!"

John raised an eyebrow, then kicked Mike hard, sending him sprawling. "I don't care about your self-identification, I judge you by what I see!"

A bitter resentment gnawed at Mike, but family loyalty prevented him from striking back at John. John, keenly aware of Mike's restraint, acted so boldly.

"Unless Michael comes in person, none of you can stop me," John asserted, straightening his attire, casting a glance towards Jasper.

By now, Jasper had finished signing the contract.

John took out a phone from his pocket and handed it to Jasper. "There's only one number on this phone. Call it, and they will help you leave the country."

Jasper accepted the phone with a knowing smile, preparing to make his exit from the bar.

Pausing, as if struck by a sudden thought, Jasper turned to the fallen Mike with a look of threat.

"Mr. Williams, could you stop this guy for me? Buy me some time to escape. Twenty minutes will be enough," Jasper implored John.

John frowned slightly, but he had the contract in hand and felt relieved. He nodded lightly. "I'll delay him for twenty minutes. Get out quickly, I don't want to see you again."

"Farewell then, Mr. Williams," Jasper said, waving as he made his way towards the bar's back door.

Mike felt a surge of bitterness upon realizing they hadn't found the bar's back door; he suspected the cunning Jasper had hidden it.

###chapter 263 Escalation of War

Mike regarded John with an expression of defeat.

"John, do you really have to go against your uncle and grandpa?" Mike's voice was heavy with resignation.

"Don't even bring them up. They're the ones against me, not the other way around!" John snapped, shoving the contract into his bag with finality.

"Man, I just don't get how you folks from these big families think." Mike shrugged, walked over to the counter, and pulled out a bottle of wine.

"With the boss gone, I guess the drinks are on the house. Just what I need to nurse my wounded soul." Mike didn't bother pouring a glass for John; he just twisted off the cap and took a big swig.

John checked his watch. He had promised Jasper he'd delay Mike for twenty minutes, and he intended to keep that promise.

Mike's eyes wandered to some papers under the counter. With a playful grin, he grabbed them and borrowed Jasper's pen to start doodling.

He drew three circles on the paper, one big one and two smaller ones, making it look like Mickey Mouse's head.

"This is an ancient, forbidden, magical teleportation circle-designed to summon the world's most formidable team of lawyers," Mike joked, a mischievous glint in his eye.

John glanced at the drawing with disdain and stayed silent, his lips curling into a sneer.

"Alright, what should I draw next? How about SpongeBob?" Mike sketched a square with a bunch of little holes on the paper.

John snorted. "You've got a weird sense of humor."

Mike shrugged. "Mr. Williams, seems like you don't have one at all."

John glanced at his watch. Ten minutes had passed.

Just then, the bar door swung open, and several bloodied people stumbled in. "Mr. Williams, run! The Brown Family's gone nuts!"

The two bodyguards, though strong, were visibly exhausted. Meanwhile, Mike's men were yelling and charging forward to keep fighting.

The sudden chaos disrupted the lively atmosphere of the bar, causing everyone to stop.

John's face twisted in annoyance, while Mike watched with curiosity.

"Mr. Williams, are these your guys?" Mike asked, intrigued.

John ignored him and strode over to the bloodied people. "Why are there so few of you? Where's everyone else?"

One of them stepped forward, his voice heavy with bitterness. "The Brown Family sent a ton of people this time. We couldn't hold them off. Lots of our guys got hurt, some even got shot. We had no choice but to fall back."

John's expression darkened even more. Suddenly, the screeching of brakes and gunshots echoed from outside the bar.

Mike's face changed, and he vaulted over the counter.

"Alright, you two, head to the back door and go after Jasper. The rest of you, stay here and protect Mr. Williams!" Mike's voice was firm, his expression resolute. He pointed at two men, then moved closer to John.

"Mr. Williams, I know you've got issues with your uncle and grandpa, but you're still the heir. We're family, so we gotta stick together. The Brown Family? They don't play fair, and they sure won't go easy on you." Mike grabbed his gun from the table, clicked off the safety, and kept a sharp eye on the door.

John appreciated Mike's support. As the heir, he knew they had to stand united against any outside threats.

He turned to his bodyguards and said, "Get your weapons ready. We're in for a fight."

The bodyguards nodded, raising their guns in readiness.

Just then, the bar door burst open. Everyone inside started shooting, but instead of a person, a car came barreling through.

A bulletproof car, engine roaring, smashed through the door, sending people flying and scattering tables and chairs.

The sheer force of the car made everyone scramble to get out of its path, shattering Mike and John's formation.

The car screeched to a halt, the doors flew open, and armed men jumped out, firing at everyone inside.

The bar exploded into chaos, with gunshots and shouts echoing everywhere. People scrambled for cover, returning fire as best they could.

Mike, always alert, pulled John behind a sturdy pillar.

The pillar was solid enough to shield them from several bullets.

"John, this place is a death trap. I gotta get you outta here," Mike said, firing two precise shots from behind the pillar, taking down two of the Brown Family's men.

John nodded grimly, his jaw tight with determination. With a sudden, forceful movement, Mike pulled him toward the back door.

The bodyguards, scattered by the mayhem, tried to regroup but were pinned down by relentless gunfire, their only option to shoot back futilely.

Mike shielded John, firing his gun as they dashed towards the back door.

The passage behind the back door was narrow, dark, and reeked of mold and rust. Clearly, Jasper hadn't bothered to clean it.

Finally, they reached the back door, only to find it blocked by a garbage bin.

"Jasper's a real piece of work, hiding the door behind a trash bin!" Mike muttered, helping John navigate through the stinking mess.

They managed to avoid the worst of the garbage, but the Brown Family's men had tracked them down.

Two of the Brown Family's goons started shooting at them, and Mike quickly shoved John aside, taking a bullet in his arm.

"Shit, my arm!" Mike groaned, clutching his wounded arm.

John, eyes narrowed with determination, grabbed Mike's weapon and took out their attackers with swift precision.

"Hey, you okay? Can you still walk?" John asked, rushing over to check on Mike.

Mike, clutching his wounded arm, shook his head. "John, don't worry about me. The gunfire's gonna draw more of them. You need to get out of here!"

###chapter 264 Hide in the Trash Can

John glanced around the alley, noting the brick wall behind them. The sound of footsteps echoed from the entrance, signaling the arrival of the Brown Family's team.

"John, I gotta say, your shooting is something else. Seems like you're the only one who can keep me safe," Mike chuckled, pulling a magazine from his pocket and handing it over.

John took the magazine with a steady hand, quickly swapping it into his gun. His eyes stayed locked on the alley's entrance, sharp and unyielding.

John's marksmanship was top-notch. Every time a Brown Family hitman showed his face, John's shots hit dead-on, dropping them instantly.

Each bullet found its mark, hitting the Brown Family's men right between the eyes.

John's skill was so intimidating that his enemies hesitated, frozen by fear, too scared to step into his line of fire.

"That guy inside is a real sharpshooter. I'll give $100,000 to whoever takes him out."

"I'll make it $200,000! Someone take him down!"

"If I could take him out, I wouldn't be standing here talking!"

Those hitmen at the alley's entrance started bickering. They were all too scared of John's aim to make a move.

Mike, leaning against the wall and looking pale, managed a weak smile. "Looks like you've scared 'em off, John."

A smug grin spread across John's face. "With me around, they wouldn't dare show up."

Just then, a voice echoed from the alley entrance. "Seriously? A single gunman sends you all scurrying for cover? Ever heard of using a grenade?"

John and Mike's faces went pale as a round object came flying in.

"Hit the deck!" Mike yelled, yanking John down as they dove behind a nearby trash can.

The lid clanged shut just as the grenade exploded, sending smoke and shrapnel pinging off the metal with a thunderous boom.

"Alright, everyone, get ready to storm the alley and take out those two idiots," the grenade-thrower barked.

As John and Mike braced themselves, a sudden barrage of gunfire erupted from outside.

"Shit, John's backup is here! Fall back!" someone outside shouted in a panic before bolting.

Cautiously, John and Mike lifted the trash can lid, peeking out to make sure the coast was clear.

Mike scanned the area, then pushed the lid open and climbed out. "Mr. Williams, it's safe. You can come out now," he said, tapping the trash can.

John emerged, reeking of garbage, with a wilted cabbage leaf stuck to his head. He tossed the leaf back into the trash can, his eyes burning with a thirst for revenge.

"Damn bastards, I won't let them get away with this!" John yelled, slamming his fist into the metal trash can, the clang echoing through the alley.

Just then, footsteps echoed from the entrance of the alley. John quickly raised his gun, ready for anything.

"Hold up, don't shoot! It's our guys," Mike said, pushing John's hand down as he recognized the faces approaching.

Two men stepped into the alley. They were the subordinates Mike had sent to track Jasper earlier.

Mike frowned, looking at them. "Where's Jasper?"

The two men shook their heads. "We couldn't find him. We think he might not have used the back door at all. There were no signs of him leaving that way."

Mike's frown deepened. "What are you saying? Is there another way out?"

John suddenly laughed, clapping Mike on the shoulder. "Looks like I win this round! Give my uncle and grandpa the heads-up-ten percent of their assets are coming my way. Hey, Mike, you ever think about joining us?"

John's offer was genuine, a gesture of thanks for Mike saving his life.

Mike, though grateful, shook his head. "Your uncle's been good to me. I'm not looking to switch sides right now."

"Alright, I'll remember what you did for me. Think it over, and if you ever need anything, you know where to find me." John smiled, then turned and walked away.

One of Mike's guys was patching him up when the other one asked, "So, we're just letting him walk away?"

Mike rolled his eyes. "You think we can stop him? Even if he shot me dead, I couldn't do a thing. His uncle's my boss, got it?"

The guy sighed. "We didn't nab Jasper. This mission's a bust, and explaining it to Mr. Williams is gonna be tough."

A sly grin spread across Mike's face. "Who said we failed? Catching Jasper was never the real mission."

The other guy blinked in confusion. "Wait, what? I thought we were supposed to catch Jasper. Mr. Williams said to mess up their deal. Are you saying...?"

Both subordinates looked at Mike, waiting for an explanation. Mike smirked and pulled out two rolled-up contracts from his waistband.

Laughing, Mike said, "We might not have Jasper, but John's not getting anything either! Haha, damn, my arm! Be careful!"

He playfully smacked one of the guys on the head with the contract when the guy accidentally hurt him while tending to his wounds.

Meanwhile, Isabella and Michael were hiding on the roof of a bungalow, listening to the gunfire from across the street, feeling tense.

"Sweetie, you were right. It's nuts to send people in there. It's just a fight over Jasper, but they're all using guns. Looks like a lot of folks are gonna get hurt," Isabella whispered, looking scared.

Michael squinted, feeling his phone buzz in his pocket. He glanced at the message and quickly turned it off.

"Come on, babe, the cops are almost here. We gotta go," Michael urged, tugging Isabella away from the roof. Just as they were about to leave the bungalow, a noise behind them made them freeze.

Isabella jumped, startled, and Michael instinctively shielded her, drawing his gun from his waistband.

A dirty tile on the floor lifted, and a familiar head emerged.

###chapter 265 Pleasant Surprise

Jasper, that sly old fox. Not only did he hide the back door of the Moonlit Lounge, but he didn't even use it to make his escape.

Beside the back door was a narrow, winding passage, just big enough for one person to crawl through on their hands and knees. Jasper had dug this escape route himself, and it led to a bungalow across the street.

As Jasper crawled through the passage, he could hear intense gunfire above him. He wasn't worried about being discovered; the entrance to his secret tunnel was expertly concealed.

"As long as I get out of here, I can live a happy life! Whether John dies or not, that's none of my business. But his uncle must be nuts, shooting his own nephew. Lucky for me, my brother's too dumb to try and take me out while I was running the family!" Jasper muttered to himself as he crawled, finally reaching the end.

With great effort, Jasper pushed open the hidden floor tile at the endpoint.

When he poked his head out, he expected to see an empty room. Instead, he found himself face-to-face with two very familiar people.

"What the hell? You two? What are you doing here?" Jasper stared at Isabella and Michael in shock.

Michael and Isabella were just as surprised. They were about to leave, completely unaware that fate had planned this unexpected meeting.

Jasper's eyes flicked to Michael's gun, his heart racing as he prepared to bolt before Michael could react.

But Jasper misjudged Michael's speed. Michael swiftly aimed the gun right at Jasper's head.

"Mr. Taylor, why don't you crawl out of there now?" Michael said, his gun steady and a faint smile playing on his lips.

Jasper grimaced, feeling like luck had completely abandoned him.

Covered in dust, Jasper crawled out of the passage. He brushed himself off, looked at Isabella, and asked, "Sweetheart, are you really gonna let this guy keep a gun on your old man?"

Isabella's face remained calm. "Considering how slippery you are, Dad, I feel a lot safer with him pointing that gun at you."

Jasper shrugged. "So, darling, are you planning to turn me over to the cops, or are you gonna help your dear old dad skip town?"

Isabella's response was cool and calculated. "Dad, what I want is for you to transfer the company's shares to me and tell me where you stashed the embezzled money."

Jasper shook his head. "No way. Why don't you just call the cops and have me arrested? I've already signed a contract with John, so you won't get a dime."

Isabella's brow furrowed deeply at the mention of the contract.

Michael picked up his phone, a barely-there smile playing on his lips. "Mr. Taylor, we can let you go, but we need you to help us record a video first."

Jasper raised an eyebrow, a sly grin spreading across his face. "Oh, why didn't I think of that? If I sign another contract transferring the shares to you, then the two conflicting contracts won't hold up in court. So, is this your condition for letting me go?"

Michael's smile widened. "That depends on whether you're willing to be reasonable. We're not offering more money, but I'm sure John's already gave you a hefty sum, so our money shouldn't matter much to you, right?"

Jasper shrugged nonchalantly. "Alright, my dear daughter. Since I'm your father, I won't ask for payment. Just give me my freedom. Let's not drag this out. Let's record the video and get it over with. I'm ready to start my new life."

Isabella clenched her fists, feeling a wave of disgust at Jasper's shamelessness.

Michael started recording the video.

Jasper, facing the phone camera, smiled with practiced ease. "Hello everyone, I'm Jasper, and I voluntarily transfer all the shares of my companies to my daughter Isabella! It's 3:40 in the morning! This video is true and valid! I am willing to take legal responsibility for everything I say! Are we done?"

As soon as Jasper finished speaking, Michael stopped recording.

"Thanks for your cooperation, Mr. Taylor. You can go now," Michael said, gently pulling Isabella aside to make way for Jasper.

Jasper walked to the door and waved at Isabella and Michael. "My dear daughter and son-in-law, I'll send you postcards once I settle abroad! And don't bother trying to track me down through the return address, 'cause I might be traveling all over the world by then."

Jasper chuckled as he walked out the door, while Isabella stomped her foot in frustration behind him.

"I can't believe my dad's become such a shameless jerk! I swear, I want to send him straight to God." Just as Isabella's words hung in the air, a gunshot echoed from outside the door.

Jasper, who had just stepped out, suddenly felt a sharp pain in his chest. He looked down in horror at the blood spreading across his shirt, his eyes wide with disbelief.

With a strangled cry, Jasper collapsed to the ground.

Isabella was startled, and Michael quickly pulled her to the wall, keeping a watchful eye outside.

Isabella's body trembled, facing death once again after her experience in the operating room.

"Save me, Isabella, I don't want to die yet," Jasper pleaded, reaching out his hand to Isabella with desperate eyes.

As Isabella gazed into Jasper's imploring eyes, a memory stirred within her; she suddenly remembered the scene of Jasper, long ago, pushing her on a swing, her laughter mingling with the rustling leaves.

In that fleeting moment, Isabella hesitated.

Michael furrowed his brows, itching to just shoot this bastard Jasper.

"Hold up, don't rush it. The shooting's stopped-likely a stray bullet. Your dad's injured but alive. You're not a doctor; moving him could kill him." Michael's words made Isabella hesitate.

Jasper closed his eyes, bracing for the end.

But then, the piercing sound of police sirens filled the air, and red and blue lights lit up the night sky.

"Thank God, the cops are here!" Isabella exclaimed, relief washing over her.

Jasper's eyes snapped open, a flicker of hope returning.

Meanwhile, John had made it back to his winery. Bianca was waiting at the door for him.

"My love, you're finally back! Wait, why do you smell so awful?" Bianca, who had been about to hug John, covered her nose and stepped back.

John just grinned and pulled out two contracts. "Sweetheart, that's not important. Jasper signed the contracts, and now those three companies are yours."

"Really? That's incredible! Wait, what's this?" Bianca's excitement turned to confusion as she looked at the papers.

John's eyes widened in shock. The contracts were covered not in signatures, but in childish drawings of Mickey Mouse and SpongeBob. He tore the papers in a fit of rage, roaring, "Mike, you bastard!"

###chapter 266 Sell it back to John

John didn't expect all his efforts for the evening to go up in smoke. He should've seen it coming that Mike, that snake, had been getting closer to him. He thought the guy was looking out for him, but he never expected him to be robbing him blind!

John tore the two pieces of paper into shreds. The white confetti mocked his naivete, drifting slowly to the floor.

Mike was wrapping a bandage around his arm in the hospital when he suddenly sneezed.

"Someone must be talking smack about me," Mike rubbed his nose and muttered.

One of Mike's guys laughed, "Maybe some girl is thinking about you?"

Mike shook his head, a smug and mysterious smile spreading across his face, "Nah, I'm pretty sure someone's cursing me."

"Looks like you're on the mend," a voice came from behind Mike.

Mike turned to see Michael standing there.

"Mr. Williams! What brings you here? Are you hurt?" Mike started to get up to greet him, but Michael gently held him down.

"Relax, no need for formalities. Ms. Taylor's dad got hit by a stray bullet and he's in the hospital fighting for his life. Ms. Taylor is with him, and I came over under the pretense of using the bathroom to check on you guys," Michael explained, closing the door behind him and taking a seat nearby.

Mike pulled out the contract signed by John and Jasper from his pocket.

"Mr. Williams, check this out. This is the contract signed by John and Jasper. Jasper really did sell all his shares to John," Mike said, handing over the documents.

Michael glanced at the contracts and grinned. "Nice work, Mike."

Raising an eyebrow, Mike said with a curious look, "Mr. Williams, your nephew offered me a pretty hefty sum to work for him, but I stayed loyal to you!"

"Is that so? Well, I owe you one then. What do you want?" Michael asked with a smile.

"Mr. Williams, you know me, I don't have many hobbies, just a love for money. Of course, it's an honor to work for you, but I'm not going to say no to extra cash," Mike said with a smug grin.

Michael chuckled and transferred money to Mike via his phone.

The notification of the transfer made Mike's eyes light up. "Wow, Mr. Williams, I didn't expect you to be so generous, way more generous than John!"

Michael waved his hand dismissively. "Alright, enough. I have a job for you."

"What job? I'll get it done for sure," Mike responded earnestly, straightening up.

Michael placed the two contracts back in front of Mike. "I want you to sell these contracts back to John."

Mike's face tightened, and he stood still for a moment before asking with a puzzled look, "Mr. Williams, what did you just say? You want me to sell these two contracts back? Then why did I go through all that trouble to steal them in the first place?"

Michael rolled his eyes and said, "It's all part of my next plan! And I'm not asking you to give them back for free. I want you to sell them back. John needs to pay a price to get these contracts."

Michael motioned for Mike to come closer and whispered his plan in his ear.

Mike's eyes lit up with understanding. "Oh, I get it now, Mr. Williams. You're so sneaky!" he said, looking at Michael with admiration.

Michael rolled his eyes again and gave Mike a playful kick. "Now that you get it, go make it happen. And make sure John doesn't catch on! Pull this off, and there's a bonus in it for you," Michael said with a grin as he got up and headed for the door.

Michael wanted to return the two contracts to John to squeeze more benefits out of him.

Even though Michael had the video of the share transfer from Jasper, there was no lawyer present at the time. According to local laws, whether that video could be used as legal evidence would depend on the lawyer's skill. John could also use this against Isabella.

Likewise, Isabella could use the video to accuse John of forging the documents he had. After all, Jasper, lying in the hospital, couldn't say anything.

Both sides had evidence to back their claims of share ownership, but neither could definitively prove they were the rightful owner.

So, the deadlock continued.

John, however, was still in the dark about all this. Michael told Mike to sell the two contracts to John personally, making it seem like Mike was being greedy and getting a few companies out of the deal.

Michael handpicked companies from John's overseas stuff-companies that would fit perfectly with the Isabella family's three. The best part? John could afford to lose them, making it a small price to pay to win Bianca over.

"A smart hunter doesn't take down its prey all at once. Instead, it inflicts small, seemingly insignificant wounds. But enough of those little wounds can bring down even an elephant! Enjoy the gift I've given you, dear nephew," Michael said with a sinister grin.

###chapter 267 Lucky Jasper

On the other side, Isabella watched as the doctor wheeled an unconscious Jasper back into the ward.

Jasper lay still, clinging to life by a thread. He was lucky the bullet hadn't killed him.

Michael saw Isabella and walked over, gently wrapping his arms around her. "How's your dad? Is he hurt bad?"

Isabella shook her head and pulled a phone from her pocket, its screen shattered by a bullet.

"My dad's really lucky. The bullet went through this phone and stopped less than an inch from his heart. Even the doctor said he's one lucky guy. The doc even joked that he must be a devout believer," Isabella chuckled, knowing her father's greedy nature left little room for piety.

Michael's eyes flickered as he took the phone from Isabella, lost in thought.

"Now we've got the video evidence to get the shares. But the big question is, how do we get our hands on the money my dad embezzled?" Isabella said, feeling a headache coming on.

No one knew when Jasper would wake up. If he didn't, the money was gone for good.

"Didn't we hire a private detective to look into this? I'm sure he'll find something. Maybe this is just a test from above for you," Michael smiled at Isabella.

Just then, several police officers approached. Jasper was a wanted criminal, and even though he was unconscious, they still had to follow procedures.

"Hey, Ms. Taylor, good to see you again," the female officer greeted Isabella with a nod and a smile.

Isabella recognized the officer; they'd crossed paths many times before.

"Anything I can help you with, Officer?" Isabella asked, keeping her voice steady.

"First off, we're really sorry about your dad's injury. We hope he pulls through," the officer said, her smile polite but a bit forced.

Isabella waved her hand dismissively. "No need for the formalities, Officer. Just get to the point."

"Alright, Isabella, can you tell me how your dad got hurt?" the officer finally asked, cutting to the chase.

Isabella had nothing to hide. Everything she'd done was above board, and she was the one who had called the police. She had no reason to worry.

"My mom told me where my dad might be, so my husband and I went to check it out. When we got there, we heard gunshots. We were scared, so we hid in a bungalow across the street. Then my dad came out of an underground tunnel," Isabella explained, tweaking the timeline a bit but leaving out John to avoid any suspicion about his ties to Jasper.

"What happened next? Your dad came out of the tunnel, and then?" the officer asked, pen ready to jot down every detail.

Isabella continued, "My dad begged me not to send him to jail. As his daughter, it was a tough call. We hesitated, and he took off, got shot in the process. Lucky you showed up when you did."

Isabella gave a quick rundown of the incident, leaving out a lot of details, but she figured it was enough to satisfy the cops.

The officer, a veteran cop, knew right away Isabella wasn't telling the whole truth.

"Isabella, you and your husband only heard gunshots? You didn't see anyone else suspicious? If you did, you need to tell us. It's important," the officer said, her tone serious.

Isabella shook her head. "Sorry, Officer, we really didn't see anyone. The gunfire was intense, like a war zone. We were scared and hid behind a wall, afraid of getting hit."

The officer sighed, realizing she wasn't going to get any more information.

The city was buzzing that night, with a major clash between the Williams Family and the Brown Family, even involving guns!

The hospital was packed with gunshot victims. And the morgue was busy too, with many people not making it.

'Those rich families, they don't give a damn about human life,' the officer thought.

The female officer could tell that Isabella knew something, but she wasn't willing to talk. As a cop, she couldn't accept Isabella's silence. But Isabella, being a former heiress of a powerful family, knew some things had to be handled internally, without involving the law.

The officer sighed and said, "Alright, Isabella, one last question. Does your father have anything on him that could help us with the investigation?"

Isabella's eyes flickered as she remembered the phone that had been hit by a bullet.

Before she could respond, Michael stepped in, shaking his head. "Right before the doctor took Mr. Taylor to surgery, he gave us a few things-a phone, some cash, and half a sandwich."

These were the items Jasper had taken from his assistant, Micah. The phone and card John had given to Jasper were with Isabella, and Michael knew about them. He planned to keep those two items hidden.

The officer, aware of Jasper taking Micah's belongings, sighed, hoping Isabella would hand over what they needed for the investigation.

Isabella nodded and handed over Jasper's things to the officer, watching her leave.

Once the officer was gone, Isabella turned to Michael, expecting an explanation.

In Michael's hand were the phone hit by the bullet and the bank card.

"Babe, Jasper was clutching this phone like it was gold. Maybe it's got what we need. You know the cops have snitches from all four big families. If we hand this over to them, they'll find out in no time. We gotta check this out ourselves. And that bank card? That's gotta be the cash John gave your dad for the deal. But now, it's ours!" Michael grinned slyly.

###chapter 268 Mike's Deal

Michael understood the power of that card-it was the key to draining every last cent from the family's bank.

Michael knew Isabella was in desperate need of cash, so he decided to keep the card for himself.

"Look, since your dad recorded that video for you, you can easily transfer the money from this card to your account. Just say it's a gift from him," Michael said with a grin.

Isabella's eyes lingered on the card, a thrill of anticipation running through her. She needed this money badly.

"But isn't this kind of sneaky?" Isabella hesitated.

Michael rolled his eyes as he handed her the card. "Babe, have you forgotten how you chased after John for eight years, and how he treated you? That jerk didn't even give you a dime for all the emotional crap he put you through! Remember how you almost lost a kidney because of him? Don't you want some payback?"

A flash of anger crossed Isabella's face. She clenched the bank card tightly and nodded firmly. "You're right, babe. My life is worth way more than this bank card!"

Isabella had made up her mind. At dawn, she would go to the bank and transfer all the money from the card to her account.

That night, the city throbbed with tension. Police sirens wailed, John's men were scrambling, Michael's crew was on high alert, and Paxton's people were equally keyed up.

After all of Paxton's men returned, Jonah briefed Paxton on the casualties.

"Mr. Brown, we had more people than they did this time, so the losses weren't too bad. But we still lost seven or eight guys. Our men ran into John during the chase and shot at him. That might piss off the Williams Family," Jonah said, looking worried.

Paxton smirked. "So what if it does? We've crossed them before. With such a big move, the other two families are probably already suspicious. While they're figuring things out, put all our operations on high alert. We need to avoid any retaliation from the Williams Family. If we can hold out until the other two families get involved, we'll be in the clear."

Paxton quickly gave his orders, and Jonah hurried off to carry them out.

Meanwhile, after tearing into Mike with a rage that nearly consumed him, John was one step away from losing it completely.

Bianca knew the quickest way to calm him down. Without a word, she led him to her bedroom.

In Bianca's bedroom, John lifted her legs and thrust into her with wild abandon.

Bianca's moans filled the room, matching the rhythm of John's relentless thrusts. Each movement was a release of his pent-up fury. Finally, with a shuddering climax, John collapsed onto Bianca, his body trembling in the aftermath of his orgasm.

The aftermath of their lovemaking left John feeling momentarily numb, his mind a calm sea, as serene as a monk in meditation.

John lay on the bed, breathing steadily. Bianca squeezed her legs together, trying to keep his semen inside her, hoping to get pregnant. It would be a big advantage for her if she did.

Resting her head on John's chest, Bianca traced gentle patterns across his skin.

"It's okay, babe, I can wait a bit longer. We can figure out other ways to get those shares. At least Isabella won't get them either," Bianca said with a reassuring smile.

John sighed. No regrets about tonight, but he just hated being played.

Suddenly, the phone on the table rang. John frowned, picked it up, and saw it was an unfamiliar number.

When John answered the call, his previously calm emotions flared up again.

"Mike, you got some nerve calling me, you bastard!" John spat, his voice tight with barely restrained anger.

A soft, almost mocking laugh came from the other end. "Mr. Williams, no need to get so worked up. I'm just a servant to your uncle. Of course, I had to take that thing."

"So, you're calling me now because my uncle sent you to rub it in?" John asked coldly.

Mike's voice was calm but had a touch of urgency. "John, you've got it wrong. Your uncle has no idea I'm calling you. I'm reaching out to see if you're interested in making a deal."

"A deal? What kind of deal?" John asked, his suspicion evident.

Mike laughed softly on the other end. "Come on, John, what other deal could there be? I'm talking about the contracts. How much are you willing to pay to get your hands on them?"

"You want to sell me the contracts? Aren't you worried my uncle will come after you?" John sneered, still wary of Mike's intentions.

Mike's tone turned serious. "John, it doesn't matter if Bianca or Isabella gets the shares. They are just outsiders after all. Even though you and your uncle are at odds, you're still family. Helping you isn't betraying him. Plus, if I hand these contracts over to your uncle, I'll just get a pat on the back. But if I sell them to you, I stand to gain a lot more."

John frowned. Mike's logic was sound, but he couldn't trust someone from his uncle's side.

"Cut to the chase, Mike. What's your real angle here? I don't have time for games," John said, his voice cold and impatient.

Mike let out a resigned sigh before responding, "Okay, Mr. Williams, you got me. Here's the deal: Jasper's been arrested. He got shot and he's in a coma at the hospital. When he wakes up, I'm sure he'll sign a contract with you, and I'll be left with nothing."

John and Bianca, who had been eavesdropping, exchanged shocked looks. Jasper's arrest was a bombshell.

Mike pressed on, "So, Mr. Williams, are you up for making a deal with me?"

###chapter 269 Chatting in the Hospital

John was taken aback by Jasper's arrest, but Mike's suggestion piqued his interest.

He could almost see the gears turning in Mike's head.

Mike was greedy, and Michael had tasked him with breaking the contract. He did the dirty work, but got nothing in return.

Now, with Jasper arrested again, John saw an opportunity for a new contract.

So Mike handed the two contracts back to John, saving him time and maybe making himself some serious cash.

"How much do you want?" John asked, trying to sound casual.

But Mike declined. "No, Mr. Williams, I can't take the money!"

"Are you messing with me?" John asked, his brow furrowing.

"Mr. Williams, you got it wrong. I haven't given the contract to your uncle yet, so he doesn't know. But he knows Jasper signed with you. If I suddenly have extra cash, what do you think he'll think? He'll suspect something's up between us. It's risky for me. If he suspects me, I'm in trouble," Mike explained, sounding a bit down.

John scoffed. "You, a traitor, worried about that? Just cut to the chase. What do you want?"

Mike chuckled over the phone. "Hey, Mr. Williams, ever heard the saying, 'Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime'? You get what I'm saying? I don't need cash, I need some industries as a backup."

John raised an eyebrow, surprised at Mike's request for his industries.

"But not your domestic businesses, Mr. Williams. I'm talking about your overseas operations. Those smaller ones won't really affect you, and they can be my safety net. Plus, they're a lot more discreet than just numbers in a bank account," Mike explained, laying out his request.

As Mike listed the industries he wanted, John took a moment to recall them.

John didn't see much value in those companies. Since Mike wanted them, John figured he could make a deal.

"Alright, when do you want to make the trade?" John asked, sounding casual.

"How about tomorrow night? I'll come to you in person. That'll give you time to get the contract ready. Take care, goodbye!" Mike said, wrapping up the call.

John rubbed his forehead and set down his phone.

Bianca, lying next to John, looked worried. "Honey, is what that guy said true?"

John gave a faint smile. "True or not, we have to give it a shot. But I don't think he's trying to pull one over on me."

Bianca could tell that John was brimming with confidence. It looked like she'd be heading the Taylor family once he got the contract.

"Thanks, babe. How can I ever repay you?" Bianca smiled softly, her hand trailing down from John's chest, over his abs, and slowly reaching his lower abdomen.

John's desire flared up again. Just as he was about to dive back in with Bianca, his phone rang.

With a reluctant sigh, John answered, recognizing Mason's number. He couldn't ignore a call from Mason.

On the other end, Mason asked him to come to the hospital; he had something important to discuss.

"Looks like I gotta go again," John sighed, kissing Bianca on the forehead before getting up and putting on his clothes.

"Babe, what does your grandpa want?" Bianca asked, a hint of worry in her voice.

John gave her a reassuring smile. "It's just Grandpa. What could he possibly do to me? Don't worry, I'll be back soon."

After getting dressed, John left the winery.

When John arrived at the hospital, Mason and Michael were already waiting for him.

"Grandpa, Michael, didn't expect you two to be up this late," John said with a faint smile, especially noting Michael's calm expression. It was hard to read what Michael was thinking.

Mason waved gently, motioning for John to sit beside the bed.

Once John was seated, Mason asked, "I heard you got attacked today. Any idea who did it?"

John furrowed his brow. "My guys think it was the Brown Family, but I can't figure out why Paxton would pull something like this."

John's crew had tangled with the Brown Family before, so they recognized them right away. But he was genuinely baffled as to why Paxton would stir up trouble now.

"From a strategic standpoint, it doesn't make sense for Paxton to mess with us right now. But if there's a bigger payoff, he might go for it. Still, I can't wrap my head around what that could be." John turned to Michael, hoping for some insight.

Michael, ever composed, said, "There's a rumor going around the Brown Family that the old leader of the Taylor Family left behind a secret before he died, something that could bring the family back to its former glory. Paxton wants to uncover this secret, so he sent his guys to grab Jasper."

"Is Paxton out of his mind? If the Taylor Family had something like that, Jasper would've used it by now. Why would he be skimming off the top?" John found the idea ridiculous, not worth taking seriously.

But as he noticed Mason's serious expression, a chill ran down his spine. 

The smile vanished from John's face, replaced by sheer disbelief. "Grandpa, is it true? Does the Taylor Family really have something like that?"

Mason let out a deep sigh. "Yeah, the Taylor Family's got some serious power, hidden away by the old head before he passed. Why Jasper hasn't tapped into it yet, I have no clue. Maybe there's some kind of catch."

Michael's face turned serious too. He'd heard Isabella drop hints about her family's secrets, but hearing it from Mason was a whole different story. He was totally blown away.

###chapter 270 Michael's New Plan

John pondered the situation, considering the current circumstances.

"If Isabella's grandfather left such a substantial legacy, and the current head of the family can't get to it, it probably means someone else is holding it. It's not that Jasper is unwilling to use it; rather, those who control it believe he's not strong or intelligent enough to handle it. They're afraid he'll blow the family fortune, so they refuse to recognize his authority," John speculated, his eyes narrowing with a mix of intrigue and suspicion.

In the past, John had always looked down on the three companies of the Taylor Family, but now he had to reassess his opinion.

"The Taylor Family's legacy can probably only be used by someone from within the family. If what John says is true and the legacy is in someone's hands, then the only ones in the family who could compete for it are Isabella and Bianca," Michael analyzed thoughtfully.

Mason nodded. "This is all just speculation, and we don't know the specifics. Maybe Jasper knows something about the hidden legacy, but unfortunately, he's unconscious right now."

John glanced at Mason, his voice steady and confident. "Once I help Bianca take control of the three companies, I believe we can slowly figure it out."

Mason raised an eyebrow and smiled at John. "You sound pretty sure of yourself."

John smirked, "I found Jasper and got him to sign a contract before he got hurt and passed out. Now, those three companies' shares belong to Bianca."

He turned his gaze to Michael, trying to figure out if Mike had spilled the beans about the contract.

Mason frowned and asked Michael, "Is what John said true?"

Michael sighed and nodded. "Yeah, my guys saw Jasper and John sign the contract. They were there to make sure John didn't get hurt."

John was pleased with Michael's response.

He looked at Mason with a grin. "So, Grandpa, looks like I won this round. When am I getting my ten percent?"

Mason's gaze was steady, his tone calm. "Don't get too cocky. Plenty of marathon runners collapse right before the finish line. There's still a lot that can happen."

John shrugged, spreading his hands with a chuckle, "No worries, Grandpa. I can wait for the final sprint."

Mason's frown didn't ease up.

Michael seemed eager to change the subject. "Mason, about Paxton's moves against John, we need to demand an explanation and hit back to teach them a lesson."

Mason nodded, and John's expression darkened. Paxton definitely needed to be put in their place.

"I'm counting on you two! Make sure Paxton understands he messed up, but don't start a war with his family. They might not be as strong as us, but they can still cause a lot of trouble. And remember, the other two families in the Big Four are watching us closely." With that, Mason waved them off.

Once John and Michael left the room, John suddenly stopped Michael.

"Hey, Michael, I need one of your guys," John said with a grin.

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Which one are you after?"

"Mike. He saved my skin outside the bar!" John replied.

Michael's face tightened, a flicker of reluctance in his eyes. "If you want to thank him, just give him some cash. Mike loves money more than anything. Plus, he's my best guy, and I can't afford to lose him."

With that, Michael brushed past John and left the hospital.

John watched him go, a knowing smile creeping across his face.

All of John's moves just now were just tests. He needed to confirm Michael knew nothing of the deal between Mike and him.

'Looks like Michael really doesn't know about this. Perfect. Once I strike a deal with Mike, I'll have leverage over him and can use it to keep tabs on Michael!' John thought, a sinister smile spreading across his lips.

Meanwhile, Michael slid into the backseat of his car, a satisfied smile spreading across his face as the door clicked shut.

"Hey, Mr. Williams, why are you so happy?" Jerry, the driver, asked, glancing in the rearview mirror.

Michael's grin widened. "My foolish nephew is trying to test me. Maybe he's already thinking about using Mike to keep tabs on me."

Jerry, who was in on Michael and Mike's plan, chuckled too.

"I almost feel bad for John now. Can't wait to see his face when he finds out the truth," Jerry said, shaking his head with a smile.

"Yeah, it's gonna be a classic!" Michael replied, his face turning serious after the laughter.

"Did you check the phone I gave you?" Michael asked, his tone now serious.

Jerry's expression matched Michael's seriousness. "Yeah, I found a number. That number's connected to a human smuggler. John's probably using him to get Jasper out."

Michael rubbed his chin, eyes narrowing in thought.

Jerry stayed quiet, focusing on driving and giving Michael the space to think.

After a few minutes, Michael's eyes snapped open, his decision made. "Jerry, get someone to contact this guy. If we can bribe him and get him on our side, great. If he refuses, then take him out and assume his identity," Michael said calmly.

Jerry, skilled at reading Michael's intentions, nodded. "Mr. Williams, you think Jasper will keep using this phone after he wakes up?" Jerry asked, curious.

Michael nodded with a cold smile, "Honestly, I doubt Jasper will even call, or even wake up. But if we play our cards right, this could be useful later. I'm curious where he's been hiding the embezzled money."

Jerry caught a glimpse of Michael's expression in the rearview mirror and felt a chill run down his spine.

'The environment back home is just too cushy. John, raised in the lap of luxury, is like a fragile flower in a greenhouse. But Michael, he's like a weed that thrives in the toughest conditions, growing strong despite the wind and snow. How can John even begin to compete with Michael?' Jerry felt a pang of sympathy for John at that moment.

###chapter 271 Mike's Acting

In a sky-high restaurant, John sat by the window, sipping coffee.

Two bodyguards flanked John, their eyes scanning the room with unwavering vigilance. When a waiter approached to offer assistance, they were promptly waved away by the bodyguards.

John raised his hand to check the time on his watch, furrowing his brow slightly.

The elevator doors slid open, and Mike strolled in, wearing a trench coat.

Mike scanned the restaurant and quickly spotted John. The two burly bodyguards were hard to miss. With a casual whistle, he approached, only to be stopped by the bodyguards.

"Alright, alright," Mike grinned, turning around as the bodyguards confiscated the gun from his waist.

After a thorough search, Mike was allowed to sit across from John.

"Mr. Williams, we've met before. If I wanted to take you out, I could've done it at the bar last time. No need to be so jumpy," Mike remarked, a smirk on his face.

John set down his coffee, picked up a napkin, and wiped the corners of his mouth with deliberate precision.

"I've been waiting for you here for fifteen minutes," John said coolly, his gaze fixed on Mike.

Mike glanced at his watch, then flipped it over and tapped the dial.

"Mr. Williams, I don't think I'm late, am I?" Mike's tone suggested that John had arrived early, so he couldn't be blamed for being late.

A faint smile touched John's lips. "You sure are something special, Mike."

Mike's expression suddenly sharpened, and he scooted his chair back a bit.

"John, you've got Ms. Taylor. Why are you still flirting with me?" Mike asked, his tone cautious.

John's eyes narrowed. "That's a pretty gross thing to say."

Mike shrugged. "Hey, you called me something 'special' first!"

"Alright, enough with the small talk. Where's the contract I asked for?" John said, sounding bored.

Mike grinned, pulling out two contracts from under his trench coat. "Sorry, the paper's a bit wrinkled. Hope that's cool."

John took the contracts, gave them a quick once-over, and nodded, satisfied.

"These are the properties you wanted." John gestured, and one of his bodyguards stepped forward, handing the other contract to Mike.

Mike carefully looked over the contract, then signed it quickly.

"You're as generous as they say, John. Thanks," Mike said with a smile, grabbing the contract and getting ready to leave.

"Our business is done here. Goodbye, John." Mike had just stood up when he heard the click of a camera shutter.

Mike's face darkened as he turned to see a bodyguard in the corner snapping pictures.

"What the hell is this, John?" Mike asked, his voice tight with anger.

John leaned back in his chair, his voice steady. "Look, I think you're a valuable asset, so I wanted to bring you on board. But since you turned me down, I guess I'll have to use a different approach."

Mike's expression darkened as he glanced at the contract in his hand, realizing it had become a trap.

"Are you blackmailing me?" Mike snapped, his anger barely contained.

John's tone remained cool and detached. "Call it what you want. From the moment you started negotiating with me, there was no way out."

Mike scoffed, "I didn't expect someone from a prestigious family to stoop so low."

John chuckled lightly, a smirk playing on his lips. "If you thought I was a gentleman, you were mistaken."

"Anyway, I've given you what you wanted. Our deal is done. If you refuse, that's fine. But the moment you step out that door, I'll let my uncle know about our little arrangement." John flashed a grin, his teeth gleaming.

Mike's hands trembled with rage. He clenched his jaw and asked, "What do you want from me?"

John's smile softened, but his eyes remained cold. "Nothing dangerous. Just keep me in the loop if my uncle makes any moves. That's all."

"You call this simple? Do you have any idea how terrifying your uncle is? This is the most dangerous job ever! If he finds out I teamed up with you behind his back, I'm dead meat. He'll throw me in a gas drum, fill it with cement, and dump me in the ocean!" Mike's voice shook as he grabbed John's collar.

The two bodyguards immediately stepped forward, grabbed Mike, and tossed him out.

John straightened his collar and adjusted his appearance.

He looked down at Mike, now sprawled on the ground, and spoke with an icy calmness, "If you don't agree, you'll be swimming with the fishes soon. But if you do, at least I can protect you."

Mike sat on the ground, glaring at John. "I was a fool to think the heir of a big family would be someone decent."

John sat back in his chair and replied, "I can let that insult slide, but now tell me, what's your choice?"

Mike struggled with his expression while sitting on the ground, and finally let out a weary sigh. "Do I have any other choice? You're all a bunch of ruthless bastards."

With another sigh, Mike got up from the ground. "Fine, I'll do it. But you better keep your word and bail me out if things go sideways."

John nodded slightly. "Don't worry, I still got a little decency, and besides, you did save my life once."

"I should've let you die," Mike muttered, then grabbed his contract and left the restaurant.

Once Mike had left, John handed the contracts to his bodyguards.

"Hey, check the fingerprints on this contract. I wanna see if my uncle's prints are on it," John said. He still didn't fully trust Mike and wanted to make sure Michael really didn't know about this contract.

Meanwhile, as Mike settled into his car, a sardonic smile played on his lips.

"Bet John's checking those fingerprints right now. Like cautious Michael would leave such an obvious mistake!" Mike's face twisted into a cold smile.

###chapter 272 Jerry's Bad News

John had his doubts about Mike, and Mike was just as skeptical about John's promises.

John's talk of saving him if he got exposed? Pure bullshit.

Heirs from these big families rarely kept their promises, especially when they were made in casual conversation.

When Mike got back, he handed the contract to Michael and filled him in on every detail of his meeting with John.

"So, what's our next move, Mr. Williams?" Mike asked.

Michael leaned back in his chair, a faint smile playing on his lips. "We stick to the original plan. John's gonna call a meeting with the top execs from the three companies soon. Should be quite a show when he sees the video."

Just as Michael finished speaking, there was a knock on the office door. Jerry walked in, looking serious.

"Mr. Williams, we've got a situation. There are some issues with Jasper's three companies," Jerry said, handing a contract to Michael.

Michael took the contract, his eyes narrowing as he skimmed through it. "That sly old fox Jasper has outplayed everyone," he muttered with a cold chuckle.

From a business standpoint, Jasper was a fool, but when it came to stirring up trouble, he was a master. His underhanded tactics had certainly caused problems for everyone involved.

"Let's have our team dig into the backgrounds of these people. We've got new tasks ahead." Michael sighed, feeling a bit exasperated. Jasper had certainly stirred up some trouble, but with the right approach, these challenges could turn into opportunities.

John's bodyguard checked the fingerprints on the two documents, ensuring there were no traces of Michael's prints, and promptly arranged for a high-level meeting with the three companies under Jasper's control.

In the conference room, Bianca, dressed to the nines, sat next to John. The top executives from the three companies were seated around the table.

These executives were well aware of the ongoing power struggle between Isabella and Bianca over the shares. Seeing Bianca's confident smile, it was clear she had secured all the shares.

"Everyone, my uncle has been caught embezzling and is now unconscious. Clearly, he's no longer fit to manage the companies. He's transferred all his shares to me, so I'll be taking over these three companies." Bianca announced with a smile, addressing the executives.

The executives didn't immediately agree, instead, they exchanged quiet murmurs among themselves.

A man in a brown suit raised his hand, "Ms. Taylor, you mentioned Mr. Taylor transferred the shares to you. Do you have any proof?"

Bianca nodded eagerly. "Absolutely. Here's the share transfer agreement, signed and fingerprinted by my uncle."

She pulled out the two contracts, and the executives around the table started to look uneasy.

With a confident smile, Bianca shared more news. "I've also spoken with Mr. Williams. He's agreed to use his resources to help us expand operations, boost production, and improve our working conditions. With his support, I believe we can bring all our companies back to their former glory!" Her eyes scanned the room.

The execs breathed a collective sigh of relief. They'd been terrified when John pulled his investment-they thought they were all going to lose their jobs. Having him back felt unbelievable.

Yet, one person in the room remained unfazed.

Suddenly, the conference room door burst open, and Isabella strode in with her entourage.

"I heard there was a high-level meeting today. Why wasn't I informed?" The room fell silent, eyes wide with shock at her unexpected arrival.

Ignoring the stunned faces, Isabella confidently walked to the other end of the table and sat directly across from Bianca.

"Bianca, these executives couldn't reach me, fine. But why didn't you give me a heads-up?" Isabella teased with a sly grin.

Bianca's face darkened for a split second before she regained her cool. "I didn't reach out 'cause I didn't want you to embarrass yourself. I mean, I won this competition. Didn't want you to lose face too badly, so I kept quiet. But hey, if you wanna see me become the new chairperson, you're more than welcome."

Bianca clapped her hands with a smile, but only a few of the execs in the room joined in, leaving her feeling a bit awkward.

The executives, sharp and cautious, sensed the changing power dynamics. Bianca had John backing her, but Isabella had Mason in her corner.

Even though it looked like Bianca had snagged all the company shares, it didn't mean Isabella was someone to mess with.

Bianca's attempt to humiliate Isabella fell flat, which irked her. But she quickly brushed it off. After all, she now had Jasper's shares, and in her mind, Isabella was destined to lose.

"Isabella, why don't you quit your current job? Now that I'm the chairperson, we're making some changes and could use some help. You should come help me out," Bianca said with a smile.

Isabella knew this was just another one of Bianca's schemes to humiliate her. Those companies were supposed to be hers. Bianca's offer was a public declaration of her supposed failure.

"Bianca, let me give you some advice. Your cheap tricks might work on regular folks, but they won't fly in the business world. You're just not cut out for it." Isabella lifted her chin, her eyes gleaming with a mix of mockery and disdain.

Bianca could see the strong sarcasm and contempt in Isabella's eyes, which made her furious.

"Isabella, let's be real. Time will tell if I'm cut out for business. And with John's help, I believe I won't do any worse than your father." Bianca's tone was icy.

Isabella glanced at John. He was totally ignoring her, showing her no respect whatsoever.

"No way am I letting John stick his nose into those three companies. They belong to my grandfather and the Taylor Family!" Isabella declared with unwavering determination.

###chapter 273 Isabella's Confidence

Isabella's words hit John and Bianca like a ton of bricks.

The temperature in the conference room plummeted. The senior executives all looked down, shoulders hunched, not daring to say a word.

Silence hung heavy in the air, but a few exchanged quick, nervous glances. The middle-aged woman in the red suit gave Isabella a long, unreadable look before retreating into silence.

Bianca's voice was icy. "Isabella, what are you trying to say? You think you can do better than John? Business isn't a game. You really think you have more to offer than him?"

"Oh, please. You just want those companies so you can marry rich. Is that how you repay Grandpa for all his hard work?" Isabella shot back, standing up and slamming the table.

Bianca stood up too, meeting her head-on. "Don't you dare bring up that old man! I'm his granddaughter too, but he never showed me any love! Ask these execs - do they care who owns this company? No, they care about their wallets, and I can fill them!"

The senior executives forced awkward smiles. They all knew it was true, but hearing it out loud was still uncomfortable.

The silence hung heavy. Isabella realized that Bianca had a point. Family loyalty wouldn't work on these senior execs. They weren't family.

The woman in the red suit shook her head slightly, looking at Isabella with a hint of disappointment in her eyes.

To Bianca, Isabella's silence was a victory. She lifted her chin, triumphant. "Jasper transferred his shares to me. I'm the chairwoman now. If you're not gonna help, then leave. We need to continue the meeting."

Isabella's gaze hardened, a mocking smile playing on her lips.

"My father transferred the shares to you? How come I didn't know about this? He clearly transferred the shares to me." Isabella laughed and took out a USB drive.

The senior executives in the room all looked at Isabella in surprise, while Bianca and John frowned at the USB drive in her hand.

"I don't understand what you're getting at," Bianca's voice was edged with disdain.

Isabella handed the USB drive to her assistant. The assistant nodded and quickly plugged the USB drive into the computer in the conference room. Soon, the big screen started playing a video.

The background of the video was an empty house, and faint gunshots could be heard in the distance.

In the video, Jasper smiled at the camera and announced that he had given all his shares to his daughter Isabella.

"This is fake, this video must be fake. Jasper is still in the hospital, how could he have recorded this video?" Bianca immediately screamed, pointing at Isabella angrily.

John's eyes narrowed at the screen, memories of that night at the Moonlit Lounge flooding back. He couldn't shake the suspicion that the video was genuine.

Isabella, now seated and radiating calm, looked directly at him. "If my video is fake, where's your proof? I could just as easily claim that the contract you're holding is a forgery. Do you have any idea how serious the consequences are for forging a contract?"

"Maybe this video is a fake. With AI tech being so advanced these days, who knows?" John replied, trying to keep his voice steady. Deep down, he knew the video was probably real, but admitting that would ruin everything he'd worked for.

'Jasper, you son of a bitch, you scammed me and recorded this damn video. Do you have any idea how much trouble this is causing me?' John fumed silently.

"My video can be authenticated by experts to determine if it's AI-generated. But those contracts you have? They only have signatures and fingerprints. How do I know you didn't forge them? Signatures can be copied, and fingerprints can be taken while my dad's unconscious in the hospital." Isabella's eyes were cold as she addressed John and Bianca, her arms crossed defiantly.

The senior executives exchanged uneasy glances.

Isabella's composure was unshakable. Her confidence made many in the room start to believe that the video was likely real.

At the same time, they realized what Isabella said could be true. Signatures can be forged. As for the fingerprints, the hospital police guarding Jasper could be easily compromised by John's power.

John surveyed the room, his expression darkening as suspicion clouded the faces around him.

John quickly thought of a countermeasure. He fixed Isabella with a cold stare and said, "If I remember right, Jasper got shot that night, didn't he? How can you prove that this video was recorded willingly by Jasper and not under duress from you?"

The senior executives suddenly realized an important piece of information they had been ignoring.

Jasper was now shot and lying in the hospital, and the background sound in the video could be heard as intense gunshots.

Isabella maintained her composure, though internally she winced, knowing John had struck a nerve; they had indeed used a gun to force Jasper to record the video.

"If you say I used a gun to make my father record the video, then please provide evidence. It's unfair to ask me to prove something I didn't do," Isabella retorted with measured calm.

This time, John remained silent, and the attention of the senior executives shifted between the two.

The woman in the red outfit looked at Isabella. A faint smile appeared on her face, seeming very satisfied with Isabella's actions.

Suddenly, the woman in the red outfit stood up. "Looks like there's no way to verify the contracts either side has right now. We'll have to wait for Mr. Taylor to recover."

All the senior executives of the company nodded in agreement. This seemed like the most sensible approach for the moment.

John and Bianca's faces were grim; this seemed like the best course of action.

Isabella, on the other hand, let out a quiet sigh of relief. Even though she didn't get the shares, as long as John and Bianca didn't get them either, she still had a shot.

Just then, the conference room door swung open again, and a group of people walked in.

"Is everyone here? I've got an announcement. Mr. Taylor sold his shares to us before he went into a coma, so we're now shareholders of the company too." The group's leader held up a contract, and the others behind him did the same.

###chapter 274 Despicable Jasper

The unexpected arrival of this new group plunged the meeting room into a profound silence once more.

All eyes turned, astonished, towards them.

Isabella and Bianca widened their eyes in shock, while John slammed the table and angrily cursed, "Jasper, you damn bastard, you should go to hell!" John's roar snapped everyone out of their daze.

Isabella looked at the sudden appearance of the third group and asked, confused, "You're saying my father sold shares to you? What's going on?"

The person at the front smiled and said, "To be precise, it's not selling, it's borrowing. Ms. Taylor, your father borrowed a large sum of money from us before and used the company's shares as collateral. According to the contract, if the money isn't repaid by the specified date, then the shares belong to us. If you don't believe it, you can take a look."

The man handed the contracts to Isabella with a grin, and she quickly began flipping through the pages.

"Let me see that!" Bianca dashed over and snatched one from her. As she skimmed through it, her face went white.

"Isabella, your father is quite a clever man," Bianca muttered through clenched teeth.

Isabella's face was just as serious. The shares in these contracts made up 40% of the total shares in the three companies. This meant that whoever managed to scoop up all these small shareholders' shares could become the second-largest shareholder in the company!

Bianca quickly caught on. A new round of competition was about to kick off between her and Isabella. They needed to snatch up more shares. Even if they couldn't secure the majority 60% from Jasper in the future, becoming the second-largest shareholder would still give them significant influence in the company.

"Hey, guys, how about we have a little chat?" Bianca forced a smile.

But the leader, still smiling, shook his head. "Sorry, Ms. Bianca Taylor and Ms. Isabella Taylor, we're not in charge of this. We're just messengers here to inform you about the contracts. If you want to get in touch with the shareholders behind us, you can call the numbers on these business cards."

He pulled out a stack of business cards and handed them out to Isabella and Bianca.

"Alright, folks, our job here is done. We won't keep you from your meeting any longer. Goodbye." The man waved and left with his team.

Bianca and Isabella looked at the business cards in their hands, and their expressions darkened.

Bianca and Isabella weren't stupid; they knew exactly what was going on. These people weren't interested in competing for shares in the three companies; they just wanted to sell their shares at a good price.

Everyone in the room knew that Mason supported Isabella and John stood firmly behind Bianca. For some, this meant a chance to profit handsomely.
No one worried about offending the Williamses; they valued reputation above all else and preferred buying their way out of trouble.

John stood up with a cold expression, gripping Bianca's hand as he walked out of the meeting room. His face was dark, clearly indicating that he needed to rethink his next move.

Isabella reluctantly collected the business cards scattered on the table.

"Alright, everyone, it looks like we can't continue this meeting any longer. Let's wrap it up for today," Isabella said as she bid farewell to the executives before leaving the office.

Isabella planned to head home and discuss the situation with Michael. But as she reached the parking lot, a young man suddenly dashed in front of her.

"Ms. Taylor, please wait! Our supervisor wants to see you," the young man said, panting heavily and looking quite urgent.

Isabella frowned, puzzled. "Who's your supervisor?"

"Our supervisor is Ms. Lester," the young man replied.

Isabella thought for a moment about Carol Lester and quickly remembered her as the woman in the red suit from the meeting room.

"What does your leader want to see me about? Did she tell you?" Isabella pressed.

The young man shook his head. "She didn't say much, just that if you want these three companies, she can help you."

Isabella narrowed her eyes. Carol held a high position in the company, but compared to John, it was like an elephant versus an ant.

Isabella looked at Leo, who was in the driver's seat, and said, "Leo, wait here for me. I'll be right back."

Leo nodded.

Isabella followed the young man into the elevator and arrived at Carol's office.

Upon arrival, the young man knocked, ushered her in, and then discreetly withdrew.

Isabella spotted Carol again. She had noticed this woman during the meeting. While the executives were deep in conversation, Carol maintained a calm demeanor, as if nothing could ruffle her.

"Ms. Lester, I assume you're not here just to joke around with me?" Isabella said with a smile.

Carol looked at Isabella and replied with a grin, "You must have checked my background; I never joke around when it comes to work. Of course, I've looked into yours too."

Isabella chuckled and asked, "Looks like you've got quite the insight into me."

Carol nodded and replied with a smile, "Of course, Isabella. I know a lot about you, except for your mysterious husband."

Isabella arched an eyebrow, a hint of skepticism in her gaze. "Ms. Lester, I wander what makes you think you can help me seize control of the three companies."

Carol didn't immediately answer Isabella's question. Instead, she said, "Before I answer that, I'd like you to answer one of mine."

"What question?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

Carol pointed to the ring on her hand and asked, "Did Mason give you a ring?"

"You mean this?" Isabella replied, reaching into her bag to pull out an antique ring.

Carol's eyes lit up when she saw the ring, and her entire demeanor shifted.

She picked up a stack of documents from the table and handed them to Isabella with a smile. "Now I can answer your question. I might not be able to get every single share in those three companies, but I can definitely help you become the second largest shareholder, no problem."

Isabella took the documents, looking puzzled. As she flipped through the papers, her eyes widened in shock. She turned to Carol, stunned.

"How do you have info on these people? Did you help Jasper get in touch with those people?" Isabella asked, her voice full of surprise.

The documents in Isabella's hands held the key to bringing down the company owners who'd given Jasper loans!

###chapter 275 Carol's Identity

Carol looked at the surprised Isabella and said with a knowing smile, "Just like you guessed, it was me who helped your dad find the loan company. He thought those folks were his own contacts. Your dad can be pretty naive sometimes."

Isabella, noticing Carol's condescending attitude, seemed to grasp something.

Through some undisclosed means, Carol had helped Jasper find lenders when he needed money.

In reality, Carol had leverage over all these people.

Isabella, unable to verify the truth of the information she had, decided to set it aside for now.

Fixing her gaze on Carol, Isabella asked, "I have a few questions for you. Why did you help me? What's the deal with this ring? Is my grandfather hiding any secrets?"

Carol nodded with a graceful smile. "I figured you'd ask me those questions. Please, have a seat. Would you like tea or coffee?"

Isabella, seeing Carol's elegant demeanor, didn't feel rushed and simply sat on the sofa, asking for a cup of coffee.

Carol walked to the coffee machine, poured two cups, and handed one to Isabella.

"Let's chat while we drink." Carol sat across from Isabella.

"First, to answer your first question, why did I help you." Carol raised a finger, her expression growing serious.

"The reason I helped you is simple," Carol said, her voice steady as she sipped her coffee. "It's because of what you said at the meeting before-that this is the Taylor Family's company, not John's. I don't want to support Bianca, only to have the company end up as John's private property."

Isabella raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical. "I've never heard of you when I was in the family before. I can't believe you're so loyal."

Carol smiled, holding her coffee cup. "Your grandfather is a philanthropist. His charity fund once helped me. Without his help, I would've died in the hospital."

Isabella was momentarily stunned. The family did have a charity fund during its glory days, which was later absorbed by other charitable organizations as the family's fortunes waned.

If Isabella remembered correctly, the influential force taking over the charitable organization should be the Brown Family.

"My family was destitute when I was young," Carol explained briefly. "A serious illness nearly killed me, but your grandfather's charity saved my life, paid for my treatment, and even sent me to school. I joined this company to repay him."

Isabella could only tentatively accept the story, lacking the means to verify it.

Carol held up two fingers and said, "Alright, to answer your second question, what's the deal with this ring?"

Isabella leaned in, her curiosity piqued. This was the answer she was dying to hear.

"This ring is a symbol of authority. Only with this ring can you command people like me," Carol explained, almost making Isabella leap off the couch in surprise.

"Wait, what? Are you saying my grandfather set up a bunch of people like you in secret? Why would he do that?" Isabella pressed, her voice rising.

Carol shook her head, a hint of frustration in her eyes. "I can only tell you that, yes, your grandfather did arrange for many people like me to stay hidden. But we don't know each other. As for why he did this, that brings us to your third question."

Carol held up three fingers and let out a soft sigh. "Honestly, I don't know why your grandfather did it. When I met him, he was dead serious. He gave me the ring and said that whoever reclaimed it after the family's downfall would be the key to the family's revival."

Isabella shot up from the couch, her lips trembling as a wild thought crossed her mind.

"Are you saying my grandfather caused the family's downfall?" Isabella's voice shook with shock.

Carol pursed her lips and nodded. "I don't have hard evidence, but it's not hard to figure out. Your dad might seem clueless in business, but for one of the top four families, the way the Taylor Family fell apart was just too quick. It doesn't add up."

Isabella took a deep breath, leaned back on the couch, and asked seriously, "What else do you know?"

Carol rubbed her forehead, looking unsure. "Honestly, I think your grandpa was trying to dodge some big disaster. Maybe tanking the family was his way of avoiding it."

Isabella squinted, struggling to believe there could be a force strong enough to make a powerful family at its peak take such drastic measures to survive.

Not even the powerful Williams Family could have had that kind of influence.

Carol glanced at Isabella, who was sitting quietly with her head down, and asked with a gentle smile, "Got any other questions?"

Isabella shook her head. "If that's all you know, then I'm good for now. I'll hit you up if I think of anything else later."

Isabella stayed seated, taking deep breaths to calm herself. The information was a lot to take in; she needed time to process everything.

Carol pulled out a business card and handed it to Isabella. "Here's my card with my number. When you're ready, give me a call."

Isabella nodded, took Carol's business card, and just as she was about to leave, Carol stopped her again.

"Hey, just so you know, while those leverage tactics might work on some greedy folks, there are others who won't budge so easy. You might need some cash to sweeten the deal. You got enough funds on your end?" Carol asked, sounding concerned.

Isabella turned back, tilting her head slightly. "Are you saying you have a lot of money? Did my grandfather give you a bunch too?"

A spark lit up in Isabella's eyes; she was desperate for money.

Carol gave a wry smile and shook her head. "No, your grandfather didn't give me any money. What I mean is, if you need some, I can lend you a bit. I've saved up quite a bit over the years. Of course, once you take full control of the company and start making money, you'll have to pay me back. As for whether your grandpa left money with someone else, that's probably true, but I really don't know the details."

A flicker of disappointment crossed Isabella's face. "No, thanks. I've got money too."

###chapter 276 Isabella's Concerns

Isabella thought Carol had her grandfather Patrick Taylor's money, but she didn't expect Carol just wanted to lend her some.

A couple of days ago, Isabella would've been sweating the share buyouts and probably been short on cash. But she got John's bank card from Jasper, and now she had plenty of money.

After leaving the company, Isabella headed home, her mind racing the whole way.

At home, Michael had prepared some desserts for Isabella because he knew she wouldn't become a major shareholder today.

Just as Michael completed the last dessert, Isabella walked in, looking disheveled. She tossed her coat and handbag on the sofa and collapsed onto it, clearly exhausted.

"Michael, you wouldn't believe the day I had at the company," Isabella said, her voice heavy with frustration as she rubbed her forehead.

Michael, though he had a pretty good idea of what she went through, played along. "What happened, babe? Tell me all about it."

Carrying a plate of cake and a cup of coffee, Michael walked over, set the treats down, and sat next to Isabella, gently massaging her forehead.

Isabella let out a heavy sigh, the weight of her father's schemes bearing down on her. "You wouldn't believe how my dad played us all. He sold forty percent of the shares to other companies before selling all of his shares to John. Now I've gotta fight for John's shares and the ones those minority shares. Whoever controls those minority shares will become the second-largest shareholder of the company."

Her frustration was palpable as she ran her fingers through her hair, her grievances against Jasper clear.

Michael chuckled, "So, my dear wife, you're worried about how to get those shares from the minority shareholders?"

His tone shifted to a more serious note. "But you're right to be concerned. Even though you got a lot of money from John, he might have more and can offer better deals. Unless you borrow money from Mason."

"Or I could just threaten them with their weaknesses. But I'm not too thrilled about that idea," Isabella's unexpected suggestion caught Michael off guard.

Michael quickly realized something else had happened to Isabella.

Pointing to the bag beside her, Isabella said, "Honey, I've got a surprise for you. Check out what's inside the bag."

"Did you get me a new razor? Now that you mention it, I do need a shave," Michael said with a grin as he opened the bag.

Isabella sat up from the sofa, wrapping her arms around Michael's neck and planting a kiss on his chin. "Why do you wanna shave? I think you look hotter with a bit of stubble."

Michael's smile faded as he looked through the documents.

"Are these the dirt on those minority shareholders? Where'd you get this stuff?" Michael's voice was serious, his eyes wide with surprise.

Michael knew Jasper had shares held by those minority shareholders, but his investigation had just started, and he hadn't gathered any intel yet.

Pointing to the papers in Michael's hand, Isabella said just as seriously, "This is what I wanted to tell you. You'd never guess my grandfather left me a loyal supporter in that company."

Isabella spilled everything about her and Carol to Michael.

Even though Michael seemed like just another mid-level employee, his sharp mind could help her figure out a lot.

Michael rubbed his stubbled chin thoughtfully and said, "In this world, love and hate don't just happen for no reason. Everything has its own logic. Is someone really helping you out of gratitude? Or is Carol aiming to climb the ladder and gain more power once you take over the company?"

"How would I know? Right now, all I can do is send someone to check if there's any info about Carol in that charity fund." Isabella shrugged, grabbed a plate of cake, and leaned back on the sofa.

Michael set the documents he was holding on the table and smiled. "Since she was brave enough to tell you about her background, it's probably legit. She's likely someone your grandpa sponsored back in the day. With a good reason, the next step is to figure out her intentions. I'll help you verify these documents."

Isabella nodded and fed Michael a piece of cake with a fork. "Thanks. If the documents are real, at least it shows she doesn't mean any harm to me right now. We might even find some common ground. I could really use some capable allies."

Enjoying the cake, Michael's smile widened. "Besides Carol, your grandpa might have left you a bunch of friends. But what I'm more curious about is who your grandpa pissed off to make the company go bankrupt like this."

Isabella shook her head. "I have no idea, but I'm sure the Williams Family couldn't pull this off. If this were a novel, there'd be some secret organization behind it, or maybe..."

"The government," Michael cut in, saying what she was thinking.

"No matter how rich you are, when it comes to power, it's like a sandcastle. One big wave and it's gone," Michael said, his voice casual but full of meaning.

Isabella sighed. "Honey, I think the most important thing right now is to get control of those three companies first, then we can take our time to grow. As for why the family fell apart, we can look into that later. We're already having a hard time competing with John; we don't need another enemy on our plate."

Michael nodded. "You're right. I'll hire a private detective to check if the info Carol gave us is legit. If it is, we need to reach out to those minority shareholders ASAP before John buys them out at a high price."

Isabella nodded, her eyes steady. "Thanks. We must move fast. Even if those shareholders hear John's offer, they'll wait to see what we have to say."

###chapter 277 Paxton's Invitation

Isabella and Michael started to split up. Michael was having people verify the authenticity of the information, while Isabella reached out to the minority shareholders. She needed to confirm if the other party had already contacted John and then offer a high price to buy some time.

Meanwhile, John and Bianca, upon returning to the vineyard, rained curses down on Jasper and then called those same minority shareholders.

For Carol, helping Isabella become the second-largest shareholder was a strategic move. It would position Isabella advantageously within the company, allowing her to gradually consolidate power and eventually reclaim all the company's shares.

But for Isabella or Bianca, what they wanted from the beginning was all the company's shares!

As for becoming the second-largest shareholder?

They never even considered it!

While both sides were busy vying for the shares, a third party was quietly putting their own plan into motion.

On another front, Paxton was equally occupied, but he was busy inviting people to dinner.

In a luxurious restaurant, Paxton had ordered a table full of sumptuous food in a private room, waiting for his distinguished guests.

This dinner was to entertain the heads of the Davis and Larson families, two major families.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door, and the head of the Davis Family, Richard Davis, and the head of the Larson Family, Anthony Larson, walked in.

"Hey, gentlemen! I've been expecting you. Please, have a seat," Paxton greeted them warmly, gesturing towards the table.

Richard had a gentle expression, while Anthony's face was somewhat indifferent.

"Paxton, I don't have much time. Let's skip lunch and get straight to the point. What do you want?" Anthony said, sitting down with a hint of impatience.

A flicker of annoyance crossed Paxton's eyes. He felt no trace of respect coming from Anthony.

Still, Paxton hid his irritation behind a composed smile.

"Mr. Brown, just tell us what's going on. I'm curious too," Richard, Joseph's father, asked, his polite tone masking his contempt for Paxton.

Paxton didn't want to waste time with pleasantries. "I'm here to discuss the Taylor Family's secrets," he said bluntly.

Richard and Anthony exchanged surprised glances.

They were well aware of the recent conflict between Paxton and John, and Paxton's attempts to uncover the Taylor Family's secrets from Jasper.

If Jasper weren't in a coma and under police guard, Paxton would have likely tried to have someone break him out of the hospital.

Richard gave Paxton a faint, enigmatic smile. "Mr. Brown, you must be joking. The Taylor Family has already fallen. What secrets could they possibly have? If there were any, why wouldn't Jasper have used them?"

Anthony, his fingers drumming on the table with a rhythm of irritation, cut in, "Cut the crap. We know you pissed off John and you're scared he's gonna come after you, so now you're trying to drag both our families into this mess."

A look of understanding crossed Paxton's eyes. Those who rise to power in a prominent family aren't fools, and Anthony was right about that, but Paxton would never admit it.

Paxton sat down, a sly smile creeping onto his lips. "I get it, you think the rumor is nonsense. But what if I told you that Jasper's dad, Patrick, did leave behind a secret? And that secret is hidden within the three companies of the Taylor Family."

Richard's eyes flashed with a hint of doubt, and Anthony's confident facade slipped for just a moment. Did Paxton know something they didn't?

"Enough with the riddles. Just spill it. What do you know? I don't have time for your games," Anthony snapped, his patience wearing thin. He was intrigued by the Taylor Family's secret, but Paxton's cryptic attitude was driving him nuts.

Paxton grinned and said, "You guys know our family only made it to the top because we scooped up a bunch of the Taylor Family's assets. We stumbled upon a weird secret in the process. When Jasper's dad was still around, their family lost a ton of money, and no one had a clue where it went. This shortfall is what gave us the chance to step in and take their place."

At the dining table, Anthony and Richard exchanged uneasy looks. They had indeed played a part in the Taylor Family's downfall and had grabbed some of their assets. But the speed at which the Taylor Family crumbled always seemed fishy, like someone was pulling strings behind the scenes.

"So, you're saying Patrick from the Taylor Family stashed all the assets somewhere and turned it into a treasure hunt?" Anthony's voice dripped with sarcasm.

Paxton shook his head, his face serious. "I don't think Patrick was that childish. He had to have a reason for doing it, but what was it? We're still digging into it. The missing wealth is probably with Jasper, but why hasn't he used it? I think there might be some specific conditions attached to those assets."

Richard tapped the table lightly, stroking his chin as he thought. "Having wealth you can't use is like having treasure locked in a vault with a password. Jasper probably doesn't know the password, but he knows where the vault is."

Anthony waved his hand dismissively. "Even if there is some treasure, what's it got to do with us? You want us to help you grab it? Why are you getting involved with Isabella and Bianca? Even if the Taylor sisters manage to regain their former glory, they're just the fifth family. They pose no threat to us."

Richard nodded in agreement, echoing Anthony's sentiments. "We don't really know what those treasures are. If it's just a pile of money, we have nothing to worry about." He chuckled. "A family can't thrive on wealth alone; connections, resources, and even political influence-those aren't things money can buy."

"What if it's some high-tech product that could change the current social landscape?" Paxton said casually.

Richard and Anthony exchanged shocked glances. "What do you know?" Anthony asked, his urgency palpable.

Paxton pulled out a document and replied nonchalantly, "Through some investigations, I found that the Taylor family's funds have been funneled into a mysterious lab. But I haven't uncovered what exactly they're experimenting on."

Richard and Anthony fell silent, realizing that an experiment capable of bankrupting the Taylor family must be quite extraordinary.

Paxton watched the two of them deep in thought, a smile spreading across his face, his eyes sparkling with a knowing intensity. "Greed's a strong motivator. If Isabella gets the treasure, I'm not worried. But if Bianca gets it? Don't forget her connection with John. If Bianca becomes the head of the Taylor Family, all that wealth goes to John, and then to the Williams Family."

"Aren't you worried about getting swallowed up by the powerful Williams Family?" Paxton's fingers tapped the table lightly, each tap seeming to hit Anthony and Richard right in the heart.

###chapter 278 Targeting John

Paxton's scheme was clear to everyone, but they had no way to counter it.

Among the four major families, the Williams Family was the most powerful, while the Brown Family was the weakest.

The influence wielded by Mason's family was so strong that, simply put, the other three families combined could barely match the Williams Family.

None of them wanted to see the Williams Family rise unchecked.

At its peak, the Taylor Family was just a notch below the Williams in status.

If the two families merged, even the combined strength of the other three families wouldn't be enough. They might end up being absorbed by the Williams Family.

"So, should we get involved in the fight for control of those three companies?" Richard's eyes locked onto Paxton, his question dripping with calculation.

Paxton shook his head slowly. "It's pointless. I've tried sending people to infiltrate those companies, but they were quickly found out. These companies have been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for years, and even with Jasper secretly siphoning off funds, they still haven't gone under! That alone tells you something's up. Plus, these companies have a lot of loyal old-timers. Taking control won't be easy."

Anthony's voice was icy. "So, what do you think we should do? Help Isabella? Do you really think she'd accept our help? And even if she does, what's in it for us? You think she'd share her grandfather's legacy with us?"

Anthony's concerns were valid, and Richard shared his worries.

Paxton's smile was barely there, just a hint. "We don't need to help Isabella directly. We just need to handle John. Make sure he's too busy to help Bianca fight for control of the three companies. We only need to help indirectly, and whether Isabella appreciates it or not doesn't matter."

"Isabella's tight with the Williams Family. Aren't you worried that if she takes over and inherits all of Patrick's assets, she'll team up with the Williams Family and come after us?" Richard asked, a bit skeptical.

Paxton shook his head. "You're forgetting the huge fallout between Isabella and John. My daughter told me everything. Isabella, Bianca, and John are completely at odds. Isabella can't stand the Williams Family, except for Mason. But Mason's not gonna be around much longer."

Richard and Anthony exchanged looks, getting what Paxton was driving at.

Isabella had always gotten along well with Mason, but after Mason passed away, John, as the family heir, inherited not just the family fortune but also the bad blood between him and Isabella.

Even though Isabella respected Mason enough not to go after John, John knew better than to expect any favors from her.

Anthony's laughter cut through the tension. "If I remember right, your family had a big hand in taking down the Taylors. Aren't you worried that once Isabella gets her family's power back, she'll come for you?"

"Honestly, I'd rather deal with that than see John succeed. Besides, when we took over the Taylor assets, your families were in on it too. We've all got beef with the Taylors. I doubt Isabella can take us all on," Paxton said, sounding completely unfazed.

Anthony and Richard went quiet, the room filled with an uneasy silence, broken only by the clinking of dishes as the waiter served their food.

Richard finally spoke up, "So, if we go with your plan, what's our next move?"

A spark lit up in Paxton's eyes. "I just got word that Jasper's been playing everyone. Before he sold shares to John, he already offloaded some to other companies. Now Isabella and Bianca are probably fighting to become the second-largest shareholder."

Anthony's eyes widened with interest, but before he could say anything, Paxton shut him down.

"I get what you're thinking, but don't get your hopes up too high. The shareholders aren't idiots. They're making bank off the feud between John and Mason. As long as it stays within certain limits, they don't have to worry about any backlash. But if they try to sell shares to other families, they'll be crossing the Williams Family. Once Mason and John team up, those companies won't stand a chance," Paxton shot down Anthony's idea of becoming the second-largest shareholder.

Anthony shrugged. "So, we need to cut John off from the money he'd need to buy those shares, right? That would give Isabella a better shot."

Paxton nodded with a grin. "Exactly. My family's resources alone aren't enough to take on the Williams Family financially. That's why I need both of you on board."

Richard and Anthony exchanged a look, a silent agreement passing between them, and finally, they nodded.

As long as they could keep the enemy from getting stronger, it would work in their favor.

All three were cunning and equally shrewd.

Once Isabella controlled the three companies, they planned to seize the Taylor family's hidden assets from her, potentially surpassing the Williams family.

John had no idea he was about to go up against three powerful enemies. If he found out about Paxton's scheme, he might just get so mad he'd want to take out those three old guys himself.

John and Mason had already laid out their stakes in the bet.

John's wealth, while substantial, was nothing compared to Mason's. Once the three big families started gunning for him, he'd lose his financial edge in no time.

But for now, John was clueless as he and Bianca headed toward the first minority shareholder.

###chapter 279 Arguing Over the Phone

The first small shareholder was Zack Farley, who ran a seafood business.

When John brought Bianca to their company, Zack greeted them warmly.

John's eyes scanned the cramped office with barely concealed disdain. Compared to his own office, which took up nearly an entire floor, this place felt like a closet.

John didn't want to linger. He lifted his chin arrogantly and said, "I don't have time to waste here. Just tell me how much Jasper borrowed from you, and I'll pay you three times that amount."

Zack's eyes practically turned into dollar signs. His greed almost got the better of him, and he nearly nodded in agreement. But he quickly masked his eagerness with a look of reluctance.

"Mr. Williams, you have to understand," Zack began, putting on a troubled expression. "Isabella, backed by Mason, also wants these shares. If I agree to your terms, I'd be crossing Mason. You're putting me in a tough spot here." He pretended to be conflicted.

John sneered. He knew exactly what Zack was up to, trying to turn this into an auction. It was almost laughable how these guys thought they could make a quick buck off him.

John slouched into the chair, kicking his feet up on Zack's desk. Leaning back, he said nonchalantly, "You know I'm the heir to my family's fortune, right? That stuff my grandpa said in the news about cutting me off? Total joke. He doesn't have a choice. The fortune is mine, regardless. So, what makes you think you're in a position to negotiate?"

John's icy stare made Zack shiver a bit.

But Zack clenched his jaw and shook his head. "John, if you were in charge, I wouldn't dare cross you. But you're not. Mason's still running things, and even if he kicks the bucket, your dad's next in line."

Zack's unspoken message was clear: 'Don't try to intimidate me with your future power. By the time you get control, my company might be bankrupt, or I could be sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere.'

John's frustration was palpable as he yanked his feet off the desk and stood up, jabbing a finger at Zack. "Fine, just you wait!"

As John turned to leave, the phone on Zack's desk rang. Zack picked it up, and his eyes widened as he listened.

"Isabella? No way, is that really you? What? You're asking about John? Yeah, he's still here. Oh, and get this-he wants to buy my shares at three times the market price. Tempting, huh?" Zack chuckled into the phone.

John had just reached the door when he suddenly stopped. He spun around, marched back to the desk, and yanked the phone out of Zack's hand.

"Isabella, are you seriously planning to ask my grandfather for money to buy those shares?" John said icily into the phone.

Isabella hadn't expected John to be there. She thought Zack mentioning John's offer was a ploy to get her to bid higher.

But with John right there, Isabella saw no reason to hold back.

"It's none of your concern where I get my funds. Even if I did borrow from Mason, I'm confident I can pay him back with my future earnings," Isabella said calmly.

John sneered, "How about this: I'll just buy all the shares for you, then give you a chunk so you can be the second-largest shareholder. You won't have to compete with Bianca anymore. How does that sound? Those shares would give you more money than you could ever spend."

Isabella replied coolly, "Thanks, but I'd rather borrow from Mason than take your money. And while we're at it, since you're already so rich, why are you competing with me for those three companies? Your assets are more than enough for Bianca, aren't they?"

Bianca, standing next to John, heard Isabella's words and snapped, "Isabella, you don't know me at all."

"Oh, I know everything about you! You're a total business moron. No sense for business at all, but still dreaming of owning company shares!" Isabella snapped at Bianca, not holding back at all.

Bianca's face turned pale with rage, her fists clenched, and her body shook.

"You're just a loudmouth, a lowlife! I don't even want to waste my breath on you," Bianca shot back, furious, and reached to grab the phone from John's hand to hang up.

But John was quicker. He dodged her hand and, with a cold smile, said into the phone, "Isabella, let me tell you something. No matter what you offer, I'll outbid you by double!"

Zack, listening closely, felt a glimmer of hope. He secretly wished Isabella would name a sky-high price.

Isabella didn't let Zack down. She said over the phone, "Alright then, I'll offer one hundred billion dollars."

Zack was almost giddy with excitement, but he quickly realized Isabella was just messing with John.

John's face darkened. Even with all his wealth, there was no way he could spend one hundred billion dollars on shares of a failing company.

After not hearing John's voice on the other end of the phone, Isabella laughed and mocked, "What's the matter, Mr. Williams? Where's all that confidence? Didn't you say you'd outbid me no matter what? Why so quiet after hearing a hundred billion dollars? Scared? Or broke?"

With a derisive snort, John finally spoke, "I'm not playing these childish games with you. Those shares are mine, and nothing's gonna change that. You have my word! Let's see how much my grandpa can back you up!"

John hung up abruptly and pulled Bianca away. They didn't need to stick around any longer. He was sure Zack would take his offer.

After John left, Zack called Isabella again.

"Ms. Taylor, Mr. Williams offered three times the price for my shares. What's your counteroffer?" Zack asked greedily over the phone.

Isabella glanced at the documents Carol had given her and replied with a hint of disdain, "I need to check with Mason on this. Honestly, John's right. I don't have that kind of money. Give me some time; I'll see if I can borrow it."

###chapter 280 Mason's Phone

Isabella needed to buy some time to check if the dirt on these shareholders was legit, so she stalled Zack for a bit.

Zack didn't know what was going on, but he was willing to wait a little longer for Isabella to come up with the cash.

Zack was the first shareholder they contacted. After that, John also made offers to the other shareholders.

Each shareholder got an offer three times their shares' value. But since they had already talked among themselves, they knew the threefold price wasn't quite what they were hoping for.

After Isabella called them, they started looking forward to Mason's next move.

Mason, on the other hand, got wind of Isabella's plan to buy shares.

When Charles filled him in, Mason slapped his leg in frustration. "Man, Jasper's a mess. Trying to sell the same shares to three different groups? That's straight-up fraud!"

Charles just chuckled. "Mr. Williams, no need to get too worked up. This could be a good break for Isabella. Even if she doesn't win the shares this time, she can still become the second-largest shareholder. She can work her way up to the top spot later."

Mason let out a sigh. "Good thing my deal with John only stops us from using our money to pay off the company's debts. I can still lend Isabella the money to buy those shares."

Mason motioned for Charles to hand him the phone. He dialed Isabella's number.

The call connected quickly, and Mason, with a friendly tone, said, "Hey Isabella, I heard about your situation. Do you need some cash right now? I heard John offered those guys three times the price. I'll get you five times that. Think that'll do?"

To Mason's surprise, Isabella declined without a second thought.

"Mason, you don't need to go out of your way for me like that. Actually, I plan to buy these shares at the original price or maybe double," Isabella's voice was calm and determined.

Mason's face showed confusion. "Isabella, are you aware that John is offering three times the price? Or do you think I'm making this up?"

Isabella smiled and shook her head. "Why would I ever doubt you? I just don't need you to spend that much money on these shares."

Mason seemed to catch on. He listened to Isabella's confident tone and said with a grin, "Sounds like you've got a plan."

Isabella admitted frankly, "I do have a way to get those shares for less than what John's offering. I believe money should be spent wisely, not just to feed someone's greed."

Isabella was feeling pretty confident at this point. After more than a day of digging, the private detective had found some dirt on certain people, just as Carol's documents had suggested.

Even if the detective stopped his investigation now, Isabella was confident enough in the dirt Carol had dug up to make those greedy shareholders hand over their shares.

"If John wants to blow his money on these shares, even if he pays ten or a hundred times the price, that's his problem. But, Mason, I don't want you to spend that kind of cash. Even if it's pocket change for you, I can't accept that kind of sacrifice," Isabella said, her voice tinged with guilt. Mason had already gone above and beyond to help her, and she didn't want to owe him any more.

Mason picked up on Isabella's feelings. He gave her a warm smile and said, "It's all good. Just let me know if you need money, and I'll be there for you. Honestly, I see you as a challenge for John. He's had a lot of wins thanks to his family's backing, but he's never really faced a serious setback. Losing this time could be the best lesson he ever gets."

Isabella quipped, "So, you hired me to be John's teacher, huh? Maybe I should start charging you for my services."

Mason's laugh was hearty and genuine. "Sure, how much do you want? Tell you what, I'll have Charles send you a blank check, and you can fill in the amount."

Isabella couldn't help but chuckle at Mason's generosity and humor.

"Alright, Mason, enough joking around. Take care and get some rest in the hospital. I gotta get back to work now." With that, she hung up.

Mason sighed as he stared at the phone.

Charles, who had overheard Mason's conversation with Isabella, walked over and asked, "Mr. Williams, are we really gonna do what Isabella said and not help her out?"

Mason nodded, deep in thought. "I've known Isabella since she was a kid. She might seem delicate, but she's tougher than she looks. If she says she doesn't need my help, it means she's got a plan."

As Mason spoke, his eyes sparkled with memories, bringing to mind a girl who looked and acted a lot like Isabella.

"They're so alike, both in looks and personality. I really hope Isabella can get all the company shares this time, just like she did back then." Mason sighed deeply.

Meanwhile, John, back at the winery with Bianca, was fuming.

John felt cursed. Even those small companies he usually dismissed were taking advantage of the family's internal conflicts to squeeze more out of him!

"When I finally take control of the family, I'm gonna buy out all those companies and make their bosses work in Evernia!" John shouted, kicking a nearby table.

"Hey, babe, don't let it get to you. They're just a bunch of greedy jerks. We'll have plenty of time to deal with them later." Bianca hurried over to comfort John, wrapping her arms around him.

John took a deep breath, then scooped Bianca up and headed towards the bedroom.

Bianca knew exactly what was coming next. She blushed and lay down on the bed, slowly undressing.

Just as John, his breath heavy with desire, was about to let off some steam, his phone suddenly rang.

John frowned as he answered the call, but his eyes soon widened. "What did you say? My funding's been cut off?"

###chapter 281 Annoyed John

John could hardly believe what he was hearing. How could a rich guy like him suddenly be cut off from his money?

The guy on the other end of the line chuckled and confirmed, "Yep, Mr. Williams. Your funds have been cut off because the Brown Group, along with two other companies, have targeted your assets."

John was livid. "Has Paxton lost his mind or something? Why's he been coming after me lately? I haven't done anything to provoke him!"

The guy on the phone sighed and said, "Mr. Williams, I really don't know. But it's true, the three families are ganging up on you. At first, they were going after the whole family, but then they found out about the split between you and Mason's assets, so they zeroed in on your share."

John's face twisted in anger. If the entire Williams Family was backing him, he wouldn't be worried about these petty moves by the other three families. But now, with only his own assets to rely on, he was in no shape to fend off their attack.

John knew he couldn't afford to waste time being angry. He asked firmly, "If I pull funds from other companies now, how long will it take to get out of this mess?"

John's subordinate seemed to have anticipated his plan and quickly responded, "Based on our experts' analysis, if you pull funds from other companies, you can get through this rough patch for now. But all your money has to go straight into keeping the company running."

John's brow furrowed deeply. His subordinate was reminding him that all his money had to be used solely for his company, not for anything else. This meant he couldn't help Bianca buy out those small shareholders.

Bianca, who had been lying next to John the whole time, overheard the phone conversation. A flash of anger crossed her face, aimed at Paxton.

She grabbed John's arm and shook her head. "Honey, your company comes first. We can figure out another way to deal with those shares later."

John clenched his jaw and looked at Bianca. "This is a challenge from the three major families against our Williams Family. Maybe I should talk to my grandfather."

Bianca shook her head again. "Sweetheart, I don't want you to feel overwhelmed. Have you thought about this? If you can't handle this crisis on your own and have to ask the family for help, your grandfather might be even more disappointed."

John was taken aback by Bianca's words. He pressed his lips together, then pulled her into a tight embrace.

"Hang on, babe! I'll talk to those small shareholders and buy us some time. I'll figure out a way to fix this." John gave Bianca a firm kiss, then got out of bed and headed to the winery to handle the company's issues.

Once he was gone, Bianca's gentle face twisted with anger.

"Damn Paxton, what's his deal? Why's he going after John out of nowhere?" Bianca slammed her fist on the bed, then paused.

A sense of unease crept over her. Paxton had no reason to target John, and if there was any link between John and Paxton, she was it.

Bianca vividly remembered how she and Pearl had plotted against Isabella. Isabella had come out unscathed, but Pearl had been left disabled.

"Is this all because of me? Is Paxton trying to pin the blame on me because he can't find the real culprit? Wait, was that car explosion his doing too?" Fear washed over Bianca.

She quickly grabbed her phone and dialed a number.

After a few rings, a deep voice answered.

"I told you not to call me right now. What's up?" the voice on the other end asked, clearly annoyed.

Bianca collected herself. "Listen," she began, "John's under attack from those three families, his money's gone, and I think the car explosion might be Paxton's doing. He thinks I'm responsible for Pearl's injuries, and he's coming after me."

After hearing Bianca's speculation, the voice on the other end of the phone went silent for a moment, then let out a chuckle. "So, this is the big emergency?"

The mocking and disdainful tone in the other person's voice made Bianca instantly furious.

"Instead of mocking me, you should be telling me what to do now. This isn't helping our plan at all," she snapped, her voice shaking with anger.

The person on the phone completely ignored Bianca's anger and continued in that same mocking tone. "Seems like you've been hanging around John too much lately, losing your ability to think straight. Use your brain for once. If Paxton is really targeting you, how did he get the other two families to join him? You don't have any beef with them."

Bianca was taken aback. She had no quarrel with the other two major families; their paths hardly ever crossed.

"Are you saying they have other reasons for going after John?" Bianca asked, her voice tinged with confusion.

A cold laugh echoed through the receiver. "I can't say for sure if Paxton was behind the car explosion last time. But according to the intel from the Brown Family, the Taylor Family has some kind of mysterious secret that could restore their former glory. Now, if you were the leader of the three major families, would you let a once-powerful family regain its strength?"

Bianca was taken aback, instantly piecing together the clues from the call.

"Is all this just for some unknown secret? Has Paxton lost his mind? And the other two families too? They're after John for something they're not even sure about? Aren't they scared of the Williams Family striking back?" Bianca shouted, her voice trembling with anger.

The voice on the other end turned cold. "You and your sister are worlds apart. When Isabella faced a tough situation, she stayed calm and thought things through. All you do is scream!"

Bianca clenched her fists, realizing that arguing was pointless and would only cost her any support she had.

The voice on the phone waited for Bianca to settle down before continuing, "You don't need to worry about John or yourself. After all, you had nothing to do with Pearl's incident. So, what are you so afraid of?"

###chapter 282 Hateful News

Bianca clutched the phone tightly, a mix of comfort and unease swirling in her chest.

"Ever since Jasper and Mia got out of the detention center, I've had this bad feeling, like something's about to go down," she muttered, running a hand through her hair in frustration.

The voice on the other end scoffed, "What are you so scared of? If you didn't do it, no one's gonna pin it on you."

Bianca paused. "We don't even know who did it. The most suspicious person is Isabella's husband, but that guy's a ghost. John hasn't been able to dig up anything on him, which is saying something."

The voice on the line turned serious. "Yeah, the mystery around Isabella's husband has everyone on edge."

Bianca snorted, "If I were you, with the power to take down Isabella directly, she'd be gone already! So we wouldn't be in this mess! That woman is always causing me grief. If you can't fix the problem, why not get rid of the source?"

The voice on the phone replied coldly, "I've told you before, don't entertain such foolish thoughts. Isabella can't die right now. If my people kill her, it'll raise too many red flags! Plus, I still don't know who her husband really is. If he's someone even I can't handle, it'll just bring trouble my way."

"Coward," Bianca shot back, rolling her eyes in disdain.

Impatiently, the person on the phone snapped, "Look, I don't have time for this nonsense. Anything else? If not, I'm hanging up."

Suddenly, a thought hit Bianca.

"Wait, don't hang up yet," Bianca blurted out. "I need to ask you something important. Can you lend me some money? John's in a tight spot with other families targeting him, and he's strapped for cash. He can't spare any for me. I need to buy shares from those minority shareholders. Isabella can borrow from Mason, but I can't."

The voice on the other end hesitated. "It's not that I don't want to help, but I don't have that kind of money either! When the old man handed out the tasks, he didn't give me my share of the cash. And even if I could give you a chunk of money, how are you gonna explain it to John?"

Bianca was stunned, realizing she had missed a critical detail. She had no good explanation for where the money would come from.

"So what do we do? If Mason lends money to Isabella, I'm screwed," Bianca said, frustration creeping into her voice.

There was a pause on the line, as if the person was trying to come up with a solution.

"Hey, do you know any journalists? Get them to write a piece on John's situation-focus on Mason ignoring his family and favoring outsiders. Oh, and drop some hints about an affair between Mason and Isabella. You're good at spreading rumors like this," the voice on the phone teased.

Bianca's eyes sparkled with a sudden flash of cunning. The plan was brilliant. Under the pressure of media, Mason would have to think twice about helping Isabella against John. It would just prove the gossip and destroy the William family's reputation.

She was about to agree when a sudden thought stopped her. "Wait, what if John finds out? I know him. Even though he's got issues with his grandpa right now, he wouldn't let his grandpa's reputation get trashed. If he finds out I ruin his grandpa's name to stop Isabella getting the money, he'll see how selfish I am."

The voice on the other end, now irritated, snapped back, "A real strong person doesn't get tied down by love! When you make it to the top, you'll see that even movie stars would jump into your bed with just a snap of your fingers!"

"I don't want those people. John's way better than them," Bianca replied, clearly annoyed.

The voice softened, resigned, "Alright, I'll help you one more time. I'll find the journalists. But remember, my help is limited, so try not to call me again. I'm being watched, and I need to lay low now."

After ending the call, Bianca stared at the blank screen for a moment, a long sigh escaping her lips.

"Great, let's see how Isabella stacks up against me now. Without Mason's money, she won't have the cash to buy those shares." Bianca smirked.

Little did Bianca know, Isabella had the money John gave to Jasper, and it was enough to buy all the shares.

Three days passed, each one filled with anticipation. The investigations against the minority shareholders finally concluded, and the dirt they dug up on them matched the documents Caro gave Isabella.

The minority shareholders were getting anxious too. They had heard about John's financial troubles and had been calling Isabella non-stop for the past two days.

After one such call, Isabella set down her phone and arranged a meeting with the anxious shareholder. Turning to Michael, who was lounging on the couch, she smiled, "Babe, this is good news. I don't know what John did to offend the other top families, but the current situation is working in our favor."

Isabella walked over to Michael and embraced him.

Michael put his arm around Isabella, but his face was serious.

"What's wrong, babe?" Isabella asked, her eyes full of concern.

Michael's expression was grim as he pulled out his phone and showed her an article.

Isabella's eyes moved over the text, and her face grew darker with each word.

"These damn media! They spread rumors without a shred of evidence and they're dragging Mason's name through the mud!" Isabella slammed the table in frustration.

Michael looked at her and asked calmly, "Honey, who do you think is behind this?"

###chapter 283 Targeting Bianca

Isabella was deep in thought about who could have done this. At first, she suspected John, but she quickly dismissed the idea.

"No way it was John. Sure, he's got his flaws and he's had his run-ins with Mason, but he'd never mess with Mason's reputation like that," Isabella said, confident in her judgment.

She had chased after John for eight years and knew him inside out. But the old Isabella, caught in love's web, couldn't admit he didn't feel the same.

Michael chimed in, "Yeah, I agree. Even if a grandson has issues with his grandpa, he wouldn't trash his reputation. So, do you think Bianca could be behind this? She stands to gain the most from it."

Isabella considered Michael's words and nodded slowly. "Yeah, I think it could be Bianca. She loves framing others, and this whole scandal is probably meant to get Mason to cut me off."

"So, should we go after Bianca? Teach her a lesson?" Michael asked.

Even though Michael didn't have strong feelings for Mason, he was still his uncle. He couldn't just sit back and watch Mason's reputation get trashed, especially when his wife was caught in the crossfire.

Isabella frowned. "With John protecting her, it's not gonna be easy to take her down."

"Bianca's just trying to keep me from getting Mason's help so that neither of us can buy those shares. This will give John time to resolve the mess and gain the upper hand. But she has no idea I've got a few tricks up my sleeve. This time, I'm gonna blow her mind!" Isabella narrowed her eyes, already picturing Bianca's stunned face when she found out Isabella had snagged the shares.

Michael nodded. "Yeah, that's the only move we've got right now. But once we get all the company's shares, we can kick off that plan."

Isabella's eyes sharpened. "You mean the plan to expose Bianca's fabricated illness?"

Michael chuckled and nodded, making Isabella's eyes light up.

"Did you find proof that Bianca's faking it?" Isabella asked excitedly, straddling Michael and wrapping her legs around his waist.

Michael's hands settled on Isabella's wrists. "Yep, after days of digging, the private detective found some solid evidence."

Michael then lifted Isabella and carried her from the couch to the bedroom.

Isabella blushed, a soft pink coloring her cheeks, and gently tapped his shoulder. "Don't rush. We need to wait a couple more days."

Michael patted Isabella's butt and then grabbed his phone from the bedside table.

"I'm just getting my phone. What did you think I was doing?" Michael smirked at Isabella.

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Isabella nibbled on Michael's ear in annoyance.

The bite was so gentle, it was more like a playful lick, making Michael's ear tingle.

"Alright, cut it out. If you keep that up, you're gonna get me all worked up," Michael said, his voice tinged with restraint.

Because of her period, Isabella couldn't keep her initial promise. Michael had been on medication lately and felt his strength coming back more each day.

Sometimes, Michael felt like he was on the verge of losing control. Isabella suggested that if he couldn't hold out, he could use her hand or mouth to relieve himself.

"I can hang in there a bit longer," he insisted. "I want to save all my energy for when you're ready."

Michael took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm brewing inside him, and carried Isabella back to the couch. He then played a video on his phone.

The video looked like it was from a security camera. Bianca was having coffee at an outdoor café when suddenly a thief ran by and snatched her bag. Bianca shouted frantically, and soon someone caught the thief. The police arrived shortly after to take statements from both parties.

"This is what went down on Bianca's first day in Lumaria. From the surveillance footage, it's clear she was in good shape before, not at all like someone with uremia. And the cops must've used body cams. Our local private eye is working on getting that footage," Michael explained to Isabella.

Isabella's eyes lit up with excitement. With the video evidence, the next step would be to wait for Benjamin to handle those doctors.

"Oh, and Benjamin called me yesterday. He's identified the doctors Bianca bribed and has people secretly tailing them. We can nab them and get confessions anytime you want," Michael added, sharing more good news.

Isabella clenched her fists in excitement. "That's awesome! I'm gonna let John know he's been a fool all along!"

With that, Isabella passionately kissed Michael on the lips.

"My love, once I have all the company's shares, you'll have everything you've ever wanted," Isabella said with a seductive smile, licking her lips and sparking desire in Michael's heart once again.

After making her promise to Michael, Isabella rose gracefully and headed to the bedroom to change her clothes, getting ready to meet with the shareholders.

Watching Isabella's silhouette as she changed in the bedroom, leaving the door ajar, Michael couldn't help but feel a surge of desire. She was only in her underwear, and the sight was almost too much for him.

He glanced down at his already hard crotch and let out a frustrated sigh. "When is this damn period gonna end? I can't take it anymore!"

Meanwhile, in another room, John confronted Bianca with the latest news, his tone icy and accusatory.

"Did you do this?" John demanded, his voice cold.

Bianca quickly checked her phone. When she saw the news, her eyes widened in shock. "Are you serious? How could you even think I'd do something like that? I can't believe you'd accuse me."

She shot John an angry glare.

###chapter 284 Angry Mason

John was caught off guard by the intensity of Bianca's reaction.

This whole thing smelled like Bianca all over it. Because she was the one who would benefit most.

"Do you really think I'm that awful? I know how much your grandfather means to you. Why would I ever do something like that?" Bianca's voice shook with anger, tears streaming down her face.

John felt a pang of panic as he looked at her. He wanted to reach out and wipe away her tears, but she pulled back from his touch.

"If you don't believe me, ask the security at the winery or check my recent call logs. Or look into the reporters who published the story. See if I've had any contact with them." With a final, icy tone, Bianca turned away, retreating into the room and slamming the door behind her.

John sighed, staring at the closed door. He clenched his jaw, hesitated for a moment, and then decided to check with the winery's security.

In the end, John found out that Bianca had been at the winery the whole time, not seeing anyone, and she hadn't been in touch with any reporters.

"If it wasn't Bianca, then why would these media outlets publish such a story? Who would benefit from ruining my grandfather's reputation?" John wondered, frustration etched on his face.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Mason's anger boiled over when he saw the news.

"Seriously? Who's spreading these lies? They're ruining Isabella's and my reputation!" Mason sputtered, his face turning red.

Charles quickly called for medical staff to check on Mason. After a while of soothing from the doctor, Mason's anger slowly began to subside.

With Mason somewhat calmed, Charles approached, his expression a mix of concern and resignation.

"Mr. Williams, we got to that media company right after the news hit, but they were long gone. It's a small company, but that story spread like wildfire because it was so juicy," Charles explained.

Mason furrowed his brow. The quick response from the other party indicated premeditation. With his experience, Mason quickly guessed that the intent was to prevent him from lending Isabella the money to buy shares.

"Could it be Bianca who did this?" Mason squinted, only able to think of Bianca. As for John? He had confidence in his grandson.

Charles still had a wry smile on his face. "Mr. Williams, just now Mr. John Williams called. He's already looked into it, and it wasn't Ms. Taylor who did it."

"What on earth could he have looked into? His mind is practically brainwashed by Bianca. His so-called investigation probably just involved asking Bianca if she did it, then calling you after she denied it." Mason's anger flared up again at the mention of this.

Charles soothed Mason. "Mr. Williams, I think you're worrying for nothing. John hasn't sunk that low, and ever since Bianca helped frame Isabella's parents, I've noticed a shift in his attitude towards her. I'm sure he's done his homework."

With Charles' reassurance, Mason's agitation began to ease.

"Even if it wasn't Bianca, it's definitely got something to do with her. Could someone be trying to set her up? What's the point? Can Bianca's reputation get any worse?" Mason scoffed.

Charles shook his head with a wry smile. Bianca had been gunning for Isabella from the start, ever since the plagiarism scandal in the design competition. Every time Bianca tried to frame Isabella, it backfired, leaving her reputation in ruins.

"Whatever. Whether it was Bianca or not, their goal is probably to keep Isabella from getting those shares. I'm curious now, what does Isabella have up her sleeve?" Mason's face showed a spark of interest.

Charles, with a hint of admiration, replied, "I think you'll find out soon. Mr. John Williams doesn't have the extra cash to handle this now, so Isabella should jump on this chance."

Charles's analysis was spot on, as Isabella had already met with the first small shareholder.

The first small shareholder Isabella met was Zack. They had spoken on the phone before, and Isabella had even offered a high price of one hundred billion dollars to annoy John.

When Zack saw Isabella in the office, he put on a fake smile and asked politely, "Ms. Taylor, would you like some coffee? The coffee here is pretty good."

Isabella shook her head. "Mr. Farley, I have a lot of people to meet. Let's skip the small talk and get straight to the point about the shares."

Zack rubbed his hands together excitedly, grinning. "Sure thing, I like your direct approach, Ms. Taylor. Mr. Williams offered three times the price. How much are you willing to offer?"

Isabella held up two fingers.

Zack's eyes widened in surprise. "Twenty times? Wow! That's impressive! Just give me the money, and the shares are yours."

But Isabella frowned slightly and said calmly, "Mr. Farley, I think there's been a misunderstanding. I didn't say twenty times, I said two times. That's the highest price I can offer."

The excitement vanished from Zack's face. He snapped, "Isabella, are you serious? John offered three times the price, and you're only offering two times? Are you kidding me? In that case, I might as well sell the shares to Mr. Williams."

Isabella, with a faint smile, crossed her arms. "You wanna sell the shares to John? Sure, go ahead. Does he even have the money right now? He'll probably promise to pay triple later, once he sorts out his mess."

Zack's face grew darker. He'd heard about John's recent troubles. But selling to Isabella for less than what John might offer? No way, that'd make him look like an idiot.

"Those terms are hard for me to accept," Zack shot back, his voice icy.

###chapter 285 Isabella's Trump Card

Isabella knew exactly what Zack was up to.

Zack figured John would bounce back eventually, and then John could buy his shares for triple the price. Those shares were just sitting there, not doing much. He could wait it out.

Honestly, the other small shareholders felt the same way.

When Isabella showed up, she knew there was no way she could strong-arm these small shareholders into selling their shares by taking advantage of John's money problems. So, she pulled out her ace.

"Hey, Mr. Farley, hold up. I've got something you might want to see," Isabella said, pulling out a photo and laying it on the table.

Zack frowned, picked up the photo, and his eyes went wide. He was instantly furious.

"Are you trying to blackmail me with this?" Zack slammed the table, glaring at Isabella.

Isabella just smiled a little. "Mr. Farley, you don't want everyone to know your son got busted for drugs overseas, right? Don't you want him back home with you soon?"

Zack started breathing heavily. He loved money, sure, but he loved his son more. But his son had gotten into drugs.

Zack had sent his son to a strict school abroad, but his son ran away, got mixed up with some bad kids, did drugs, stole stuff, and ended up in jail.

Isabella looked at Zack and smiled. "I have some connections over there. If you trust me, I can make a call and get your son out."

"Can you really do that?" Zack was skeptical.

Given Isabella's family situation, just getting out of the city was a huge challenge, let alone having any pull abroad. Plus, that country was outside the reach of the big four families, so even Mason might not be able to help.

But Isabella just smiled, made a quick call, and hung up.

A little later, Zack's phone rang.

Isabella motioned for Zack to answer it.

With a frown, Zack took the call, and his face turned to shock. It was his son on the other end.

"They let you go? Community service? That's fine, as long as you're out. When can you come back? Next month if you behave? That's great. Stay out of trouble, and I'll do my best to get you home soon," Zack said excitedly.

After hanging up, Zack turned to Isabella, who was smiling calmly, like she had all the power in the world.

"How did you pull that off?" Zack asked, a mix of curiosity and awe.

Isabella shook her head and pulled out the share transfer agreement from her bag. "That's not the question you should be asking. Now, what's your answer?"

Zack sighed, picked up a pen, and signed the contract.

Isabella got up from her chair, satisfied, and extended her hand to Zack. "Well, here's to a smooth partnership, Mr. Farley. The money will be in your account soon."

Zack shook her hand with both of his. "We were so wrong about you!"

Isabella shrugged with a smile. "I didn't expect much from any of you."

With that, Isabella left Zack's office, her bag in tow.

Zack's son had really screwed up overseas, and that country wasn't under the control of the four major families, but it was still within the reach of Michael's dad, Kenna.

Once Isabella found out about Zack's weak spot, she asked Michael if he could help. Michael said his dad had connections in the prison system and could make a call.

Isabella called Kenna and got a positive response, so the problem was easily taken care of.

"In human society, connections are always the best resource," Isabella thought, a faint smile on her lips as she drove to her next meeting.

The second shareholder was a slightly chubby middle-aged man. When he saw Isabella, his eyes couldn't stop wandering over her.

Isabella's beauty was undeniable, and James Finley, the creep, didn't miss it.

James had been trying to get Isabella drunk, getting way too close under the guise of cooperation, and being all flirty.

Isabella's response? She splashed red wine in his face.

"You crazy woman! Don't you want those shares anymore? Don't think I don't know Mason is under public pressure and won't lend you money. If you want my shares, you'd better see what you're willing to pay," James sneered, wiping his face harshly.

Isabella looked at James and smiled faintly. "You've got some nerves to threaten me like that. Aren't you afraid your wife will find out?"

James's face twisted in confusion. "What are you talking about? I don't get it. What's my wife got to do with this? That old lady can't stop me. I'm the one who runs things in our family."

Isabella raised an eyebrow and clapped her hands. "Mrs. Finley, did you hear that?"

A wave of dread hit James as the door to the private room burst open, and a middle-aged woman in a yellow dress, Lally Potts, stormed in.

"James, you bastard!" Lally screamed, charging at him.

James jumped, trying to get away, but two bodyguards behind Lally shoved him back into the chair. Lally, clutching her purse and a bottle, went wild, smashing them against James's body.

After more than ten minutes, Lally's rage finally cooled. She turned to Isabella and said, "Thank you, Isabella. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have known that James was cheating on me."

Isabella stepped forward and gently hugged Lally. "Mrs. Finley, I get it. We've both been hurt by love. These damn men aren't worth our tears."

Lally sobbed in Isabella's arms.

James's Achilles' heel was his constant cheating and betrayal of his marriage, and the one dealing with him was his wife, Lally.

###chapter 286 Coercion and Incentives

James was just your typical employee at the company until one day, he bumped into Lally, the chairman's daughter. Thanks to his good looks, he caught Lally's eye.

James pulled out all the stops to win Lally over, and before long, the sweet and innocent Lally was head over heels. They ended up getting married.

With Lally's family's influence backing him, James quickly climbed the corporate ladder.

But after tying the knot, James started packing on the pounds from all the social events and his lack of self-control. His once-handsome face turned greasy and less appealing.

Even though James had changed, Lally's love for him never wavered. She even had two kids with him, staying loyal despite his declining looks.

Lally had heard whispers about James, but he always swore he was faithful. Naive Lally, much like Isabella before her, believed that her efforts would make him change. But they both forgot that some people never change.

James' business trips were just a cover for his affairs with other women, and Lally knew nothing about it.

At first, James kept himself in check because his success depended on Lally's favor. If she ever stopped supporting him, he'd lose everything, and her family would cast him out.

But once someone gives in to temptation, they get bolder. Cheaters who get away with it once think they're untouchable and can keep doing it forever.

When Isabella showed Lally undeniable proof of James' cheating, Lally was completely floored.

Isabella had thought about using the evidence to blackmail James into giving up his shares. But after seeing everything Lally had done for James, she remembered her own past, how she had given everything for John.

Isabella couldn't stand to see Lally being deceived any longer, so she decided to take drastic action.

She found Lally and spilled the beans about James' infidelity.

Isabella was betting that Lally's family would destroy James, and then Lally could reclaim everything from him, including the shares he had bought.

After Lally got everything from James, she would return the shares to Isabella.

Whether Lally would keep the shares or sell them for a better price was a risk Isabella was willing to take.

But after today, Isabella knew she had made the right call.

Seeing James beaten and bruised, Lally's eyes were cold and unfeeling. She looked like a queen. She ordered her bodyguards to take James to their mansion and lock him up. She wanted to get every detail of his cheating out of him.

"No, Lally, I love you. It was a mistake, a stupid mistake. Give me another chance, it was the first time, I was only joking with Ms. Taylor!" James kept shouting Lally's name, his voice growing more desperate as he was dragged away.

Finding his pleas unbearable, Lally told the bodyguards to take off James' shoes and shut him up by stuffing them into his mouth.

Once James was dragged away, Lally sighed, "Finally, some peace and quiet."

"Mrs. Finley, you've been through so much. I get it, and I'm sure you've heard about my story too," Isabella said gently as they sat together.

Lally nodded. Everyone in town knew about Isabella's eight-year pursuit of John, even his engagement to her hadn't stopped him from hooking up with Bianca. It was no secret among the wealthy.

Wiping her tears, Lally turned to Isabella, "Thank you, Isabella. Without you, I might never have had the proof against James. He's just too sneaky."

Isabella smiled and shook her head. "You don't need to thank me too much. By helping you, I'm also helping the woman I used to be."

Lally spoke earnestly, "Thank you, Isabella. I heard about your struggle with Bianca over the shares recently. Give me a few days, and I'll take back everything from that jerk James! Then the shares will be mine, and I can return them to you."

Isabella held Lally's hand and shook her head. "Don't rush. First, think about how to explain all this to your kids. A woman has more to consider once she has a family. Be careful of that jerk James using the kids to manipulate you."

Lally nodded seriously. "You're right, Isabella. Thanks for the reminder. I'll be careful! We'll still be friends, right?"

"Of course, I'm thrilled to have a friend like you," Isabella said, giving Lally a warm hug.

Even though Lally's family wasn't as powerful as the four major families, they still had a lot of clout in the city. Being on good terms with her would really help the company's future.

After they parted ways, Isabella headed to her next meeting with another shareholder.

The process was almost the same each time. Whenever Isabella offered to buy shares at double or even the original price, the minor shareholders turned her down, some even mocking her as a fool.

For these greedy folks, Isabella played her strongest card.

"Mr. Dickson, you wouldn't want your wife to find out about your illegitimate child, would you?"

"Mr. Hubbard, you wouldn't want anyone to know about your bribery of the senator, would you?"

"Ms. Sherman, let's talk about you and your husband's driver. I know more than you think."

"Mr. Baldwin, you wouldn't want anyone to know about your embezzlement of public funds for gambling, would you?"

Isabella revealed all sorts of dirt. Under pressure and temptation, these small shareholders had no choice but to sell all their shares to her.

With the final contract signed, Isabella allowed herself a moment to relax.

"I finally did it, and I've almost spent all my money. The only thing left is to get my father's shares into my hands," Isabella said with a smile as she sat in the car, looking at the stack of contracts beside her.

###chapter 287 Brush Bianca off

As Isabella's rival, Bianca had no clue that Isabella had already scooped up all the shares from the minority shareholders, making her the second biggest shareholder in the family.

She was still crowing about Mason not helping Isabella out.

With John still tangled up in the mess created by the three major families and having no extra cash to help her out, Bianca had to step up and personally call and negotiate with those minority shareholders on John's behalf.

"Mr. Farley, you gotta understand, the influence of the three major families on us is pretty much nothing. Our current situation is just a bump in the road. Give us a few days, and we can buy your shares at three or even five times the price. I believe Mr. Farley can be patient, right?" Bianca sounded super confident on the phone.

Zack on the other end of the line went quiet for a moment, then nodded and said with a smile, "Of course, I trust Ms. Taylor. I'll wait for two more days."

After wrapping up the call with Bianca, Zack hung up, a flicker of disdain in his eyes.

"You're a joke compared to your sister," Zack spat into the phone.

The same thing happened with the other shareholders.

Bianca told each one that John would soon sort out the mess and then buy their shares with cash. Each shareholder agreed, willing to give John some time.

But after hanging up, each shareholder cursed Bianca as a foolish woman.

Because Isabella had leverage over all of them, and even though she promised to return those levers and not use them to threaten them anymore, they were terrified to defy her. They didn't trust her to keep her word. Yeah, businessmen say they value integrity, but it's not always the top priority.

Bianca called James, but after a few rings, no one picked up, which made her frown.

She glanced again at the business card she was holding.

The number was right, it was definitely James's number, his private number. Why wasn't anyone answering?

Just as Bianca was getting puzzled, the phone was finally answered, but a woman's voice came from the other end.

"May I ask who's calling?" the voice asked, sounding polite but distant.

"I'm Mr. Williams' girlfriend, I'm looking for Mr. Finley, are you his secretary?" Bianca asked.

There was a pause, and Bianca thought she heard a faint scream. She frowned slightly, confused by what was happening on the other end of the line.

When Lally heard it was Bianca on the phone, her face turned cold. She didn't have a good tone for people who messed with others' relationships.

"I'm his wife, he's not available right now." Lally's words were icy, each syllable sharp and cutting. Bianca could almost picture Lally, picking up the phone with a look of disdain.

James had been stripped of all his clothes, and he was naked and tied to an iron frame. Various torture tools were placed next to the iron frame.

"I need to talk to Mr. Finley about transferring shares. What's he up to right now?" Bianca's voice had a hint of impatience.

Lally walked over to the torture tools, grabbed a red-hot branding iron, and pressed it against James's stomach.

The searing pain made James tremble and struggle, letting out a desperate scream. "Darling, I was wrong, I really was."

Bianca was startled by the clear scream coming from the phone.

Lally, on the other end, smiled faintly. "I'm sorry, Ms. Taylor. We can only discuss the shares later. We're a bit busy with some... intimate games. You'll have to wait to discuss any business."

Lally said this while searching for a whip among the torture tools, eventually finding a riding crop.

Bianca, hearing the unmistakable crack of a whip followed by James's anguished cries, felt a chill run through her.

"Sorry to bother you. Please tell Mr. Finley that we need a few days, and John will transfer the money to buy the shares," Bianca said before hastily ending the call.

Lally, far from satisfied, continued her "intimate games."

"Darling, how should I punish you?" Lally caressed James's greasy cheek, asking in a sickly sweet tone.

James shook his head, trembling. "Darling, I know I was wrong. You don't want the kids to lose their father early, do you?"

Lally's face turned cold as stone. To prevent the kids from seeing James in his current state, Lally had already ordered the butler to send them out of the country as soon as she got home.

Any mention of the kids now would only fuel Lally's anger.

"Now go outside and bring me a bucket of alcohol," Lally ordered her subordinate behind her.

Soon, the subordinate brought a bucket of medical alcohol, its acrid scent filling the air.

Lally dipped the whip in the bucket, soaking it with alcohol.

"Darling," Lally whispered, "They say alcohol can help clean wounds. To keep you from getting infected, I gotta disinfect those cuts. And, well... it just seems easier to do it with the whip. What do you think?" Lally's pale face revealed a sickly sweet smile, then she fiercely whipped James with the alcohol-soaked whip.

"Damn you, you wretch, I won't let you off even if I become a ghost! It hurts so much! Is there anyone? Help!" James wailed in agony.

"No need to shout for help, sweetie. You built this soundproof basement yourself, remember? Said you needed it for your music. Turns out it was for your little rendezvous with the maid. The soundproofing here is so good, I can't even hear it in the room upstairs, so don't expect anyone to come and save you." Lally caressed James's face, then picked up a pair of scissors from the side.

"Cheaters gotta pay. Chemical castration's too good for them. I prefer the real deal." Lally slowly brought the scissors close to James's genitals.

###chapter 288 The Second-largest Shareholder

Isabella had no clue what Lally was up to. If she did, she probably wouldn't have been able to eat for days.

Luckily, she stayed in the dark. After breakfast, she got right to work, calling a meeting with the senior execs from three companies.

In the conference room, the execs were all huddled together, whispering about what was going on. They'd just had a meeting a few days ago, so why another one now?

Unlike the others who were scratching their heads, Carol seemed to have a hunch about why Isabella called the meeting. She just shrugged and smiled calmly.

Suddenly, the door swung open and in walked Bianca with her bodyguards. She'd also been invited to this high-level meeting by Isabella, and she was just as puzzled as everyone else.

"Ms. Taylor, isn't Mr. Williams coming with you?" one of the shareholders asked, looking confused.

Bianca shot him a sharp look. "John's super busy right now, dealing with attacks from the three big families. But trust me, it's only a matter of time before he handles it."

The execs didn't doubt Bianca's words. After all, John had a powerful family backing him.

"Ms. Taylor, do you have any idea why Isabella called this meeting?" another exec asked.

A lot of folks in the room were rooting for Bianca to take the lead. To them, it didn't matter if they worked for the Taylor Family or the Williams Family. In fact, working for the Williams Family might even mean better pay and a more stable future.

"I have no clue," Bianca said with a light chuckle, covering her mouth. "Maybe Isabella's finally throwing in the towel."

Bianca was so confident in John that the idea of Isabella taking control seemed laughable to her.

Carol, who had been quiet with her arms crossed, glanced at Bianca and then looked away.

Just then, the door opened again, and Isabella walked in.

"Looks like everyone's here. Bianca, I gotta say, I didn't expect to see you," Isabella said, smiling as she took her usual seat.

Bianca, arms crossed and looking frosty, shot back, "Isabella, everyone's really busy. If you don't have anything important, don't waste our time with this pointless meeting."

Isabella sat down and smiled. "I'm not here to waste anyone's time. I've got some big news to share."

Bianca eyed her suspiciously, a bad feeling creeping in.

"Isabella, what news? Don't tell me your dad woke up and handed you the company's shares," Bianca sneered.

Isabella shook her head. "No, my dad hasn't woken up. I have video proof of the share transfer, but you don't believe me, so there's nothing I can do. However, I do have another announcement."

Turning to the execs, Isabella's voice was calm but firm. "I've bought back the 40% of shares my father sold, and now I'm the second-largest shareholder in the company."

As soon as Isabella finished speaking, the room went dead silent. Bianca, stunned for a moment, quickly turned furious. She slammed the table, stood up, and glared at Isabella.

"Isabella, do you have any idea what you're saying? This isn't a game. You claim you bought those shares? Let's hear how you managed that little miracle. Did you rob a bank?" Bianca roared, though deep down, that bad feeling in her gut grew stronger.

Isabella just smiled, clapped her hands, and the door opened again. A secretary walked in, struggling with a huge backpack.

"Sorry, everyone, there are just too many shareholders and too many agreements. I had to have someone bring them in for me," Isabella said, taking the backpack, unzipping it, and dumping all the agreements on the table.

"For those of you who have doubts, feel free to check these agreements yourselves," Isabella said, stepping aside as the execs stared in shock.

Finally, someone couldn't resist and picked up an agreement to read. When they saw the contents and signatures, they were stunned.

"These are real share transfer agreements! How did Ms. Taylor pull this off?" someone asked, looking at Isabella in shock.

"No, this can't be, it's definitely fake," Bianca screamed, rushing over to read the contracts. But no matter which one she opened, all the procedures were legal and compliant.

"How is this possible? How did you do this? How could they do this? They tricked me!"" Bianca's eyes blazed with fury as she confronted Isabella.

Isabella looked at Bianca, offered a thin smile, and then patted her face with a condescending air. "My dear sister, I asked the small shareholders to keep our little transaction quiet. I even told them to put you off if you called-it was a surprise! Now I've reclaimed the family shares. Aren't you thrilled?"

Isabella's mockery made Bianca tremble with rage.

"Those damn guys deceived me! How did you do it? Did Mason give you money again? Why would he do this? Are those rumors true?" Bianca screamed.

Isabella, keeping her cool, met Bianca's gaze with a faint smile before delivering a sharp, resounding slap to her face. "Watch your words, Bianca. Do you know what you're saying? I see Mason as my family, and he treats me like a granddaughter! I only have respect for him as an elder! If you dare to tarnish his reputation with those rumors, I won't let you off."

Bianca was slapped before John's bodyguards could react. Consumed by guilt and worry, they quickly intervened and stepped between the two women.

"Let's wait and see!" Bianca spat, her eyes burning with malice as she cast a final, venomous glare at Isabella before storming out of the room.

###chapter 289 Jasper Awakens

Isabella watched Bianca walk away, not bothering to stop her.

Once all the top execs finished going over the contracts and confirmed Isabella's new status, they were all just waiting for her next move.

With a casual wave, Isabella told them to sit, and they all did, quietly. Then she took her seat and got ready to lay down her first order.

"Now that I'm the company's second-largest shareholder, and with my dad in a coma and his embezzlement messing up the company's operations, I can strip him of all his management rights according to the board's rules! In the next few days, I'll be rolling out a series of reforms and making some new personnel appointments." She stood up, hands on the table, and looked around the room.

Her gaze was cold and firm as she scanned the senior execs.

"Who's with me? Who's against?" Her voice rang out, clear and strong.

The execs exchanged nervous glances. Isabella's presence was intense.

If Jerry were here, he'd be floored. Isabella's vibe was just like Michael's.

Breaking the silence, Carol stood up, nodding at Isabella. "I'm ready to follow Ms. Taylor's orders."

With Carol leading the way, the others snapped out of their shock, stood up, and pledged their support to Isabella.

Isabella was pleased with their reaction. She motioned for them to sit back down.

"Since no one's opposing, starting tomorrow, I'll be working here. Please submit all current reports to me. The company's reform starts now." And with that, she wrapped up the meeting.

After the meeting, the execs looked at each other, some wiping sweat from their brows.

"How did we never see this side of Isabella before?" one exec asked, puzzled.

Someone seemed to get it and said seriously, "Love can mess with a woman's head! Now that Isabella's over John, she's sharp again! As an heiress to a big family, she's got to have some skills. Men just held her back."

The others nodded, agreeing with the theory.

But while Isabella was holding her meeting, an unseen storm was brewing.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, in Jasper's room.

Jasper lay on the bed. His fingers twitched slightly, and his eyelids fluttered.

From confusion to slowly waking up, Jasper realized where he was.

His eyes shifted to the two cops outside the room. They were chatting and didn't notice he was awake.

After the meeting, Isabella rushed back to her workplace.

When Isabella got to the office, she exchanged quick hellos with her colleagues and headed straight to Dwayne's office.

Dwayne looked surprised when she walked in. "Hey, Isabella! You look pretty happy. Something good happen?"

Isabella smiled politely. "Mr. Larson, I just wanted to thank you for all your help since I joined the company."

Dwayne looked puzzled. "Why are you saying this all of a sudden? Wait, you're not quitting, are you?"

He suddenly remembered their initial agreement.

Seeing Isabella nod, he asked in shock, "Did you get your dad's shares?"

Isabella nodded, then shook her head.

Dwayne was confused.

Isabella explained with a smile, "Well, I got some of them. My dad secretly split the shares and sold some off. I managed to get the shares from those small shareholders. Now, I'm the company's second-largest shareholder! Even though I don't have as many shares as my dad, he's in a coma and has been stripped of his rights, so I'm in charge now."

Dwayne took a deep breath, not expecting Isabella to pull this off.

"I have to admit, I never thought you stood a chance against John. Looks like I underestimated you," Dwayne said with a rueful smile.

Isabella handed him her resignation letter.

"Thanks again for everything. By the way, I'm planning a small party before I leave and I'd love to invite our department colleagues. Mr. Larson, it would be great if you could come," she said, her smile bright with the promise of new beginnings.

Dwayne hesitated, then nodded. "Alright, I'll be there. I hope I don't make the employees uncomfortable."

After inviting Dwayne, Isabella happily went back to her office.

As soon as she left, Dwayne called Michael.

"Mr. Williams, Isabella has resigned. She's now the second-largest shareholder in her family. She also invited me to her resignation party tonight," Dwayne said with a wry smile, filling Michael in.

Michael's reaction was calm. "I know. Since she invited you, you should go. You don't need to worry about her anymore."

Dwayne was momentarily stunned but figured Michael, with his strong connections, must have already known about Isabella's new status.

"Got it, Mr. Williams. By the way, do you have any plans for the director position after Isabella leaves?" Dwayne asked.

"You handle it. I trust your judgment," Michael replied decisively before hanging up.

Back in her office, Isabella started packing up her things. As she was tidying up, she noticed Juliet watching her, eyes red with emotion.

Isabella looked at her, confused. "Why are you crying? Did someone bully you again?"

Juliet shook her head, tears streaming down her face. "Ms. Taylor, I heard you're resigning. Is it true? I can't bear to see you go. You're the best leader I've ever had."

###chapter 290 Juliet's Choice

Isabella watched Juliet cry and couldn't help but smile.

"I'm just quitting, not dying. If someone saw you now, they'd think I had a terminal illness. Come on, wipe those tears." Isabella handed Juliet a tissue, still smiling.

Juliet dabbed at her eyes and grabbed Isabella's hand. "But I can't stand to see you go. What if the new director isn't as nice as you? You're like a sister to me."

"Honestly, I've always thought of you as my little sister." Isabella hugged Juliet warmly.

Juliet bit her lip, looking like she had made up her mind.

"Ms. Taylor, can I come with you?" Juliet asked, her eyes full of hope.

Isabella was caught off guard. Instead of saying no right away, she gave a bittersweet smile. "Juliet, do you know what you're asking? My new job might be as CEO, but those companies are almost bankrupt. If you come with me, you might make less money than you do now."

Juliet shook her head firmly, still holding Isabella's hand. "I don't care about the money. If it's less, so be it. I believe that with you in charge, those companyies will get better, and you'll bring back your family's glory. By then, I'll probably make more than I do now!"

"That sounds like an investment, but it's a pretty big one." Isabella shook her head with a wry smile. She wasn't saying no, just amazed at Juliet's bravery.

"Please, Ms. Taylor." Juliet pleaded, still holding Isabella's hand.

Isabella rubbed her forehead. She didn't really want to leave Juliet behind. But Juliet was originally sent by Dwayne to be her assistant. Taking her felt like stealing one of Dwayne's employees, which made her feel guilty.

After some internal struggle, Isabella finally gave in.

"Okay, but I need to talk to Mr. Larson first. It wouldn't be right otherwise." Isabella shrugged and headed to Dwayne's office.

Dwayne was surprised to see Isabella again. When he heard her request, he agreed without hesitation.

"It's fine, young people should make their own choices. I approve. If Juliet wants to go with you, she can. I wish you both the best." Dwayne agreed easily.

Just an assistant, it wasn't a big deal for Dwayne.

Before resigning, Isabella had made all the preparations, recruiting talented new employees and delegating her work.

Now, as soon as the new director was chosen, she could hand over her duties.

After telling her colleagues in the design department about her resignation, everyone expressed their regret and best wishes.

"Tonight, I'll treat everyone to dinner, drinks, and karaoke! Let's have a fun farewell party!" Isabella's suggestion was met with cheers, and everyone started talking about what to eat that night.

Isabella called Michael to see if he wanted to come to her farewell dinner.

"I won't get involved in your company's affairs," Michael said, politely declining Isabella's invitation with a courteous smile.

Michael had his reasons. Mason still hadn't let go of his suspicions about him. If he showed up and got photographed, Mason would find out. Then his cover would be blown.

Isabella didn't mind Michael's refusal. After chatting for a bit, just as they were about to end the call, Michael's tone changed, like he suddenly remembered something.

"Oh, by the way, have you seen the news today?" Michael asked out of the blue.

"There's a lot of news today. Which one are you talking about? Something about the four major families or our company?" Isabella asked, curious.

"It's from the national business department, about a new business law," Michael said, sounding serious.

Isabella picked up on his tone and asked anxiously, "What happened? I haven't been keeping up with the news. Just tell me straight."

"In short, this new law affects your company. Your dad broke the law, and it's serious. His shares will be frozen once the law kicks in. So even if he wants to transfer them, he can't," Michael explained.

Isabella's eyes widened in shock. "My dad's shares are frozen? How are we supposed to get them?"

Michael smiled. "There's good news and bad news. Which one do you want first?"

Rolling her eyes, Isabella snapped, "No time for games. Just spill it."

"Alright, things aren't as bad as they seem. I made a call, and they suggested a competition between you and Bianca. The task is to find the money your dad took and cover the company's losses. The good news is, you don't have to worry about your dad pulling any tricks," Michael said.

Isabella sighed deeply. "That's not exactly good news for me. I have no idea where my dad hid the money. Is the bad news that Bianca has an edge over me? If she finds the money, she'll have more shares than me."

Michael gave a wry smile and touched his nose. "Yeah, that's pretty much it."

Isabella rubbed her forehead. "At least for now, my dad's still unconscious. Once he wakes up, I can ask him where the money is. I'm sure I can get it out of him."

But before Isabella could finish, Juliet burst into the office.

"Ms. Taylor, something's wrong. There are two police officers outside looking for you," Juliet said, out of breath.

Isabella frowned. "Looking for me? Why? I've already told them everything I know. There's no point in them talking to me now."

Juliet shook her head. "No, the police said your dad escaped from the hospital. They want to know if you know where he is."

###chapter 291 Jasper's Escape

Isabella's eyes went wide when she realized her call was still connected. On the other end, Michael caught wind of Jasper's escape from the hospital.

"Well, darling," Michael's voice had a teasing edge, "looks like we've got bigger problems."

Isabella rubbed her face in frustration. "Damn it, I knew taking over the companies wouldn't be that easy! Get those two cops to come see me."

Knowing the police would soon be knocking on her door, Isabella hung up.

As the call ended, Michael's smile vanished. He quickly dialed Jerry.

"Find out how Jasper managed to escape," Michael ordered, his voice cold and furious.

Jasper's situation was complicated. Not only were the police involved, but there were also undercover agents disguised as patients or hospital staff keeping tabs on him.

These people were waiting for Jasper to wake up so they could squeeze information about the family's secrets or any embezzlements out of him.

Michael had his own people watching too, but it was clear they had slacked off, leading to delayed updates.

Jerry rushed to the hospital as soon as he got the call and chewed out all the subordinates who were supposed to be watching Jasper.

The subordinates hung their heads, taking the scolding in silence.

Jasper'd been lying in a coma in the hospital these days, and with the police guarding him, everything seemed so normal that over time, the guards grew bored and gradually slacked off.

In fact, not only did Michael miss the news, but the rest of the Williams Family, including John, only found out after the police showed up.

That day, everyone who had been watching Jasper got a serious dressing-down from their boss.

Soon, Michael got the full story of Jasper's escape.

According to the nurse who was changing his bandages, Jasper suddenly attacked her from behind while she was getting ready to help him.

Jasper knocked the nurse out, stripped her, put on her clothes, laid her in the bed, covered her with a blanket, and pretended he was still lying there.

Disguised as the nurse, Jasper walked out of the room and then the hospital.

Thanks to the police's negligence, no one noticed a thing.

When Michael heard about how Jasper had escaped, a deep sense of frustration washed over him. The whole thing had been too easy, proving that everyone had underestimated Jasper, giving him the perfect opportunity.

Michael drummed his fingers on the table, trying to figure out where Jasper would go next. He had set a trap in advance.

Jasper had gotten info from John about a human smuggler. Michael had his men replace that smuggler, so Jasper might reach out to him any minute now. All Michael had to do was sit tight and wait for updates.

After leaving the hospital, Jasper found an old homeless man, knocked him out with a rock, and stole his clothes.

Jasper ditched the tight nurse's uniform, put on the stolen clothes, and slipped away from the hospital grounds.

With no cash on him after busting out of the hospital, Jasper knew he'd have to get creative to get out of town.

He ducked into a quiet alley and rummaged through a trash can, finding a plastic pipe which he slipped into his pocket.

Jasper waited patiently until he spotted a young guy with glasses taking out the trash nearby.

Keeping his head low, Jasper pressed the plastic pipe against the guy's back.

"Don't move. Hand over your phone and wallet, or I'll shoot," Jasper growled.

The young guy froze, feeling the hard object against his back. He didn't want to risk finding out if it was a gun or a knife.

"Okay, okay, just don't hurt me," the guy stammered, shaking as he handed over his wallet and phone.

Jasper grabbed the wallet and phone, pocketed the wallet, and asked, "What's the password?"

The young guy told him, and Jasper knocked him out with a rock to the back of the head.

Not wanting the guy to be found too soon, Jasper dragged him into the alley and made a call at the entrance.

"Hope this number still works," Jasper muttered.

A gruff voice answered, "Who is this?"

Jasper grinned. "Are you the one John sent to pick me up?"

There was a pause, then the voice said, "Jasper? You got out of the hospital?"

Jasper took a deep breath. "No time for chit-chat. Can the deal with John still go down? Can you help me get outta here?"

"Absolutely. Mr. Williams paid well. I'll make sure you get out safely," the voice assured him.

Jasper pressed on, "Great. How do I contact you?"

The voice gave clear instructions, "At nine p.m., there's a boat at Sapphire Port heading to Lumaria. Look for a guy in a red beret. Tell him who you are. He's my guy, you can trust him."

Jasper memorized the details and hung up.

He was relieved he still remembered the contact info for the smuggler. Without it, he'd be stuck.

Suddenly, Jasper realized he had no idea how long he'd been out. What time was it? Did John get what he wanted?

He quickly searched for news about the Taylor Family on the phone, focusing on Isabella. All he found were rumors about Isabella and Mason, with nothing about any changes in the family's shareholders.

###chapter 292 Jasper's Escape

Jasper had been searching for a while, dreading the news he would find, but came up empty-handed. He let out a sigh of relief.

He was really worried that John would find out about him selling the shares to others. If John found out, he'd be livid. He might even get the agent who helped him escape the country to track Jasper down.

But there was nothing in the news about the Taylor Family's shares. That meant John and Bianca hadn't started any reorganization of the shares yet.

Jasper had no idea why they hadn't done anything after all this time, but as long as no one found out, he was in the clear. What he didn't know was that the rumors about Isabella he had just stumbled upon were actually tied to the shares.

Jasper was clueless that Isabella had snagged 40% of the shares and was now the second biggest shareholder. The press conference hadn't happened yet, so the media was still in the dark.

After wrapping up his search, Jasper looked around cautiously and then slipped out of the alley with his head down. Since he escaped from the hospital, he knew the police would be after him. He couldn't risk taking a taxi or public transport, so he had to dodge the patrolling cops and walk to the harbor.

Just after Jasper left, the young guy in the alley twitched his fingers a bit.

Meanwhile, Michael got a call from his subordinate, confirming that Jasper had reached out to that 'smuggler'.

"Mr. Williams, should I just grab Jasper when he shows up and bring him to you? Or should I interrogate him first and find out where he's hidden the embezzled funds?" the subordinate suggested over the phone.

Michael, tapping his desk thoughtfully, found the idea tempting. But would Jasper really spill the beans? And would he tell the whole truth?

Michael trusted his subordinate's methods, but he was worried that Jasper would hold back some info.

"Don't we have a new research project called Parasite Localization?" Michael suddenly asked over the phone.

The subordinate nodded. "Yeah, Mr. Williams, we do. It's like a spider. Once swallowed, it sticks to the stomach and doesn't get dissolved by stomach acid. But it's still experimental and pretty expensive, so we don't have many."

Michael narrowed his eyes. "I'll arrange for a private plane to deliver the localization device within six hours. Find a way to get that thing into Jasper's mouth."

"Don't worry, Mr. Williams, I'll make sure he swallows it," the subordinate said with a sinister chuckle.

On the other side, Bianca stormed back to the winery and started smashing everything in the bedroom.

"Damn Isabella stole what I wanted again! Damn it, that bitch should go to hell," Bianca fumed, flipping a table in the room.

Just then, Bianca's phone buzzed in her pocket. She quickly answered it.

"Can you just take care of Isabella and get rid of that bitch?" she blurted out before the caller could say anything. "She somehow got the shares from those minority shareholders! Now she's the second largest shareholder of the company. With Jasper out of commission, she could almost take over as the CEO!"

A cold laugh came from the other end of the line, cutting through her rant. "I've long given up on you. It's obvious Isabella has some tricks up her sleeve. When it comes to scheming, you only know some petty tricks. You can't outsmart your sister."

Bianca snapped back, "Enough! I don't need you calling me stupid. I just want to know if you have a way to fix this!"

The voice on the phone turned icy. "I regret choosing a fool like you. Anyway, there's no need to worry. The country's laws have changed. If you can find the embezzled funds Jasper transferred and fix the companies' financial mess, you can get his shares! I called to tell you this good news. But I didn't expect you to hit me with bad news."

Bianca's anger turned to excitement. "So there's still a way, that's great! But where do I find the embezzled funds Jasper took?"

The person on the phone sounded annoyed. "Are you really that dense? No one would know if the money you present is the embezzled fund. You say it is, and it is! Understand? The important thing is to fill the gap!"

Bianca's face darkened. "Have you forgotten that John doesn't have the money to give me now? Where am I supposed to find the money to cover the embezzled funds?"

"That's not my problem. Maybe you can ask John, he might have a solution," the voice on the phone said coldly before hanging up.

Bianca angrily threw her phone on the bed and sat on the edge, running her hands through her hair.

Just then, she heard footsteps outside the door. She immediately recognized them as John's.

Bianca quickly stood up, tidied her hair and clothes, and took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.

The door swung open, and John walked in, his face a mask of displeasure. He took in the wreckage of the room, his brows knitting together in a deep frown.

Bianca hurried to John, took his hand awkwardly, and said, "Darling, I have some bad news. Those minority shareholders have been deceiving me all along. They never respected you. Isabella somehow bought their shares, and now she's the second largest shareholder of the company. She even held a senior management meeting and humiliated me in front of everyone. I was so angry, I couldn't control my emotions."

Despite her words, John's expression remained grim.

"Darling, are you mad at me for breaking things? Is that why you're upset?" Bianca asked sadly.

But John shook his head. "It's not that. I just got news that Jasper has escaped from the hospital, and now a lot of people are looking for him."

###chapter 293 Angry Bianca

When Bianca found out Jasper had busted out of the hospital, it was like getting hit by a lightning bolt.

She felt like even the universe was against her. Just when she had a shot at taking down Isabella, Jasper went and escaped. If they didn't catch him soon, who knows where all that embezzled money would end up?

Bianca's body shook, the weight of despair almost knocking her back onto the bed, but John was quick to catch her.

"What's wrong, babe? Jasper escaping isn't the end of the world," John asked, worry etched on his face.

Bianca's face went pale. She forced a weak smile and explained to John about the chance to become the biggest shareholder in the company by recovering the missing funds.

John, who had been too wrapped up in company issues, hadn't been keeping up with the latest news.

"Dammit, why is everything going wrong at once? If I wasn't being targeted by the three major families, I could've helped you with the funds by now," John said, pounding the wall in frustration, scraping his hands.

Bianca gently took John's injured hand in hers.

"It's okay, babe. Don't stress. The cops are on Jasper's trail. Once they find him, we'll get the info about the funds," she said, trying to soothe him.

John let out a long, tired sigh. The people he had watching Jasper at the hospital had messed up, letting him slip away. Was Jasper playing him again?

A sudden thought hit John. He had once given Jasper a contact, a guy named Zane Hays, who was a human smuggler.

"Could Jasper have reached out to Zane?" John wondered aloud, quickly dialing Zane's number.

Bianca watched him, curious about what he was up to.

After a few rings, a stranger's voice answered. "Who is this?"

John hesitated, surprised by the unfamiliar voice. "Who are you? Isn't this Zane's phone?"

There was a brief silence before the person on the other end asked, "Are you Mr. Williams?"

John's face darkened as he realized this wasn't Zane.

"What's your name? Where's Zane?" John demanded coldly.

The voice on the phone, Joe Roach, sighed before replying, "I'm Joe Roach. Zane died in a gang fight, and I've taken over his business. He mentioned you before, said you were a good client. Need anything, Mr. Williams?"

Joe's voice had a greedy edge, clearly hoping to make some money off John.

John's eyes narrowed. He knew the type-people who'd sell out their own family for the right price.

"I don't need anything right now. I just want to know if you've gotten any calls from a guy named Jasper recently," John asked, his tone icy.

Joe paused, seemingly thinking it over.

"I haven't gotten any jobs related to Jasper lately. If you're talking about your deal with Zane, I had no idea about it! Are you trying to get Jasper out of the country? You'll need to renegotiate the price. Unlike Zane, I haven't been paid by you. I'm not doing it for free," Joe replied, trying to keep it polite.

John paused, then frowned. "Are you sure you haven't heard from Jasper?"

Joe, sounding a bit annoyed, said, "Mr. Williams, like I said, I'm not doing this job for free! If you want to get someone out of the country, you'll need to pay. Money's not an issue for you, right?"

John snorted, "I don't care about the price, but listen up. If Jasper contacts you, you need to tell me. I'll pay you for the info. But if you try to play me, you'll regret it."

Joe's voice perked up. "Don't worry, Mr. Williams. I know the rules. If I hear anything, I'll let you know!"

John, fed up, ended the call.

He knew these guys only cared about money. Since John didn't pay Joe, he wouldn't help Jasper even if Jasper reached out to him.

Jasper didn't have the cash to get out of the country, so he was still around.

John shared this bit of good news with Bianca as he held her.

Bianca felt a bit relieved but still worried. She knew Isabella would be hunting for Jasper too, and with Mason backing her, she had a serious advantage.

Bianca thought Isabella was her only competition for finding Jasper, but she forgot about Paxton and the other two major families.

The leaders of the three major families met up again.

Anthony, looking serious, broke the silence. "Jasper's on the loose. We need to find him before the cops or the Williams family do. He might have clues about the Taylor family's secrets."

Richard, with a slight smile, said, "We don't have much control over this. Finding people is the cops' job. But I've got people watching the police station. If there's news, I'll hear about it."

Paxton chuckled, "I heard Jasper escaped dressed as a nurse. I'd love to see him in women's clothes, hahaha."

Richard and Anthony exchanged looks, clearly unimpressed.

"Your sense of humor is... unique. But are you sure Jasper has the Taylor family's secrets?" Anthony asked, skeptical.

Paxton shook his head, "I'm not sure, but it's a gamble, right? I've heard Isabella got the shares from the minority shareholders, making her the second largest shareholder. John lost this round. If we find Jasper, eliminate him, or stop John's people from finding him, it's a win for us."

Richard and Anthony fell silent, realizing Paxton had a point.

###chapter 294 Looking for Jasper

The three big family heads all knew they each wanted a piece of the Taylor Family's legacy. Each one hoped to grab it all for himself. But if none of them could, they sure as hell weren't going to let the Williams Family get it and become a bigger threat.

Paxton lightly tapped the table and grinned, "I know we've got our people at the police station. But we're not a gang, no need to keep tabs on the cops all the time. A couple of informants there will do. The rest can reach out to our underworld contacts. Don't underestimate them. Sometimes they're better at finding people than the police."

Richard and Anthony nodded in agreement with Paxton's plan.

So, the three families sent their operatives into the city's dark corners, seeking help from the underworld to track down Jasper.

Meanwhile, after hanging up with John, Joe called Michael.

"Mr. Williams, John called asking about Jasper. I told him I haven't heard from Jasper," Joe reported.

Michael, staring out of a big French window, nodded. "Let's hold off for now. Once Jasper swallows the localization device, we can trace the money through him."

The sky outside was a clear blue, not a bird in sight. Michael's eyes seemed to pierce through the vast expanse, imagining a private plane taking off from his hometown airport.

Michael turned away from the window and hung up the phone.

After a moment, he called Isabella.

"Hey babe, what are you up to?" Michael asked with a smile.

Isabella was busy at work, even though she was about to quit, she still had some tasks to wrap up.

"I'm swamped with resigning, moving everything to the new company, and planning tonight's party. It's all a bit much," Isabella sighed.

Michael chuckled, "I'm swamped too. I'm hiding in the bathroom to call you. My boss wouldn't let me take leave this time, otherwise, I'd be there to help you."

Lounging on the sofa, Michael stretched lazily, a contented hum escaping him.

Isabella, on the phone, misunderstood.

"Babe, are you constipated? You sound like you're straining," Isabella teased with a laugh.

"Nope, I'm good in that department. Just a bit tired, need to move around," Michael replied lightly, though his tone soon turned serious.

"Babe, now that your dad's escaped from the hospital, should I hire someone to find him?" Michael asked.

Isabella shook her head. "No need to waste money. Private detectives are expensive and might not even find him. The police are better at this. I'll call Mason and have him send someone to help me find him."

Michael nodded. "Alright, babe. I thought you'd be freaking out, but you seem pretty chill now."

Isabella smiled and asked, "By the way, babe, ever thought about working for me? I could be your boss."

Michael burst out laughing. "Oh really? And what exactly would my job be?"

Isabella tilted her head, thinking seriously. She knew Michael was sharp in business, but where should she put him?

Michael kept joking, "So, would my job be cleaning for you, giving you massages when you're stressed, cooking for you, pouring coffee? Maybe even scrubbing your back in the shower? Or, you know, undressing and lying in bed when you have certain... needs?"

"Stop it! I need an employee for the company, not a house servant!" Isabella shot back, her face turning red.

Michael chuckled, "But I feel like a servant right now. And you haven't even paid me."

Isabella laughed too, "You're right, I haven't paid you. So, I guess I won't be needing you for those things anymore."

Michael's face changed instantly. He jumped up from the sofa and said, "No, no, no, I think being a servant is actually pretty great. I'll massage your shoulders and legs when you're tired, cook for you whenever you're hungry. I'll do anything for you, but please, don't cancel those needs."

Isabella's laughter on the other end of the line grew louder, and Michael could vividly imagine her sitting on the floor, holding her stomach and laughing.

"Please, babe," Michael cooed playfully into the phone.

Isabella, still laughing, said, "You're so cheesy!"

"I'm only cheesy for you. No one else gets to see this side of me," Michael said with a smile, twisting his body, then he turned his head and saw Jerry staring at him, wide-eyed.

The whole office fell into an awkward, eerie silence. Jerry and Michael just stared at each other, neither saying a word.

In the quiet office, only the persistent sounds of Michael's phone could be heard.

"Alright, babe, I gotta go. Don't worry about me, I'm good," Isabella said, kissed the phone, and hung up.

Michael put away his phone, looked at Jerry expressionlessly, and asked, "When did you come in?"

Jerry blinked, hesitating before responding, "Around the 'Please, babe' part?"

Michael turned around, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. "Forget everything you just saw."

Jerry's mouth twitched, trying not to laugh. "Mr. Williams, you know, I have a really good memory."

Michael opened his eyes and said lightly, "I remember you wanted a vacation, right? There's a project in the wild forest conservation area. Go feed the monkeys. Take a break."

###chapter 295 Escaping Overseas

Jerry never thought he'd end up in this mess just because he saw something he shouldn't have and cracked a joke at the wrong time. Now, he was facing Michael's wrath.

"No, no, no, Mr. Williams, you know me! My idea of a vacation is sunshine, beaches, and bikinis. Not forests, mosquitoes, and monkeys! Please, I swear I can forget everything I saw," Jerry pleaded, his hands outstretched in desperation.

Michael sneered, "Maybe you could wear a bikini in the blazing forest at noon, feeding mosquitoes and monkeys. And as for the beach, that's a piece of cake-I'll get you an hourglass!"

Jerry almost dropped to his knees, his face twisted in desperation. "Mr. Williams, please, I didn't see anything, I swear!"

Suddenly, Jerry had a lightbulb moment and bolted out of Michael's office, only to return a few moments later, knocking on the door like nothing had happened.

When Jerry walked back in, he had a calm expression. "Mr. Williams, these are the new company documents that need your signature."

He acted like he hadn't just been begging for mercy a minute ago.

Michael took a deep breath, grabbed the documents from Jerry, and sighed, "You're shameless to a whole new level."

Jerry shrugged. "C'est la vie."

Michael rolled his eyes, signed the documents, and slapped them against Jerry's chest. "Now get out of my office. As for your vacation, I did plan to let you have a couple of days off. But now, I've changed my mind. You're staying put."

Jerry's face fell. 'Damn capitalist, greedy capitalist, stingy capitalist...'

He kept cursing Michael in his head as he walked out of the office.

Meanwhile, Jasper, who had been running from everyone, finally made it to the meeting point arranged by Joe.

Jasper leaned against a container, panting heavily, his face flushed.

He hadn't dared to take public transportation and hadn't eaten much since leaving the hospital. The money he had was only enough for a loaf of bread.

Luckily, that bread kept him going, or he might have passed out from hunger.

Scanning the crowd with wary eyes, Jasper soon spotted a man wearing a red beret.

Making sure no one was watching, he approached the man cautiously.

"I'm Jasper. Did anyone tell you to pick me up?" Jasper asked carefully.

The man in the red beret smiled and waved. "Alright, Mr. Taylor, no need to be so formal. I'm Joe."

Jasper recognized the voice from their phone call and felt a bit annoyed. "Why didn't you just tell me you were the one picking me up?"

Joe shrugged and smiled, "Does it really matter? Besides, you're a guest arranged by Mr. Williams himself, so I have to personally welcome you. It's a sign of respect for Mr. Williams."

Jasper shot Joe a cold look, took a deep breath, and said, "Where's the boat? I want to leave now."

Joe rolled his eyes. "Come on, Mr. Taylor, do you see what time it is? The ship doesn't leave for another four hours! The cargo ship hasn't even finished loading yet. I can't send you off now."

Jasper sighed, glancing at the half-loaded cargo ship. He knew he had to wait.

"So what am I supposed to do now? Wait in the cabin for four hours? Damn it, I haven't eaten. I'm starving," Jasper muttered, staring at Joe, hoping for some food.

Joe shrugged. "I'll take you to a container where you can hide until we reach another country's port. My people will get you out. Let me take you to that container first, then I'll bring you some food."

Joe led Jasper towards the container.

Jasper kept his head down the whole time, worried about being recognized.

But in reality, Jasper's worries were unnecessary. Everyone on the dock had been replaced by Michael's subordinates.

As for Zane, who Joe replaced, he did die in a gang fight. Poor Zane actually managed to escape, but Joe needed his position, so he took him out and credited the killing to the enemy.

When they reached a red container, Joe ushered Jasper inside. "Stay here and don't move around. I'll get you some food. What do you want to eat?"

Jasper waved his hand dismissively, "Just food and water. By the way, how long is the trip?"

"At this ship's speed, it'll take sixteen days to reach Lumaria," Joe said.

Jasper frowned and shook his head. "I don't need to go to that country. Just get me out of this country and arrange an identity for me so I can take a plane. You don't need to worry about the rest."

Joe frowned. "It's not impossible for you to disembark midway. This ship will resupply at a port in two days. By then, you'll be out of the country. But arranging an identity for you won't be easy."

Jasper gritted his teeth. He dared not make any phone calls now, but Joe was clearly asking for money.

"You just want money, don't you? I'll give it to you now." Jasper seemed to make a hard decision, raised his fist, and hit his own face.

Jasper felt the pain from the punch but nothing else.

"What are you doing? Are you trying to threaten me by self-harm?" Joe asked, confused.

Jasper, his frustration mounting, explained through gritted teeth, "I have two gold teeth in my mouth. That should be enough. But I'm too hungry, I don't have the strength..."

Before Jasper could finish, Joe punched him hard in the face. Jasper screamed in pain and spat out two bloody teeth.

Looking at the two white teeth on the ground, Jasper's anger flared anew. "You idiot," he cursed vehemently, "you hit the wrong side!"

###chapter 296 Two Gold Teeth

Jasper clenched his jaw and leaned in again, and this time Joe put all his strength into a punch that landed hard on the other side of Jasper's face.

The hit was so strong that Jasper was momentarily airborne before crashing to the ground.

"How about that? Did your gold tooth fall out?" Joe asked, grinning.

Jasper staggered up, glaring at Joe while spitting out two bloodied gold teeth.

"This is the price I paid. Get me out of the country ASAP," Jasper growled.

Joe eyed the bloody teeth, bits of gum still clinging to them. He picked them up with a grimace and weighed them in his hand.

"These should do. Well, since you look so pathetic, even if it's not enough, I'll cover the rest," Joe said with a sneer, turning to wash the teeth at a nearby water pipe.

But as he took a few steps, Jasper called out.

"What now? Got more gold teeth?" Joe's eyes lit up with a greedy glint.

Jasper covered his mouth, stepping back in panic, shaking his head. "No, I don't. I really don't. I just need you to get me some liquid food. I can't eat solid stuff right now."

Joe glanced at Jasper's swollen cheek, surprised. "Alright, I'll get you some oatmeal."

Joe walked off with the gold teeth in hand.

Jasper quickly hid inside the container.

Lying there, blood dripped from Jasper's mouth, his cheek grotesquely swollen from the missing teeth.

Staring into the dark container, Jasper muttered to himself, "Once I get out of here and get the money, I can find a good dentist to fix me up with new gold teeth. After all, I'm not short on gold."

Feeling hungry, Jasper touched his stomach, hoping Joe would bring food soon.

About half an hour later, Joe came into the container with a lunch box.

"Come and eat," Joe's voice echoed.

With a swollen face, Jasper slowly emerged.

Seeing Jasper's pitiful state, Joe showed no mercy. He was playing the role of a ruthless criminal involved in illegal emigration, with no need for sympathy.

"Here's your oatmeal. I added some sugar for energy," Joe handed the lunch box to Jasper.

Excited, Jasper opened the box to find a steaming bowl of oatmeal.

He eagerly started gulping it down, not caring about the heat.

As Jasper ate, he didn't notice the sinister smile on Joe's face.

Joe felt like everything was going suprisingly well. They had been wondering how to get Jasper to swallow the tracker, and now, with his missing teeth, Jasper could only eat liquid food. This made it easy for Joe to slip the tracker into the oatmeal.

Soon, Jasper finished the bowl, feeling warm and energized.

"The taste isn't great, too sweet," Jasper grumbled, licking his lips.

Joe rolled his eyes. "Just be glad you have something to eat. Eat less, so you won't have to relieve yourself in the container."

He handed over some plastic bottles and bags.

"What are these for?" Jasper asked, confused.

Joe's frustration was clear. "You'll be at sea for two days. Think you won't need to relieve yourself or get seasick? The bottles are for urine, and the bags... if you dare to mess up the container with your crap, I'll end you!"

Clenching his remaining teeth, Jasper, who had never faced such humiliation, took the bags and bottles back to the container.

Seeing Jasper's dejected look, Joe smirked, then left to inform Michael about the successful execution of their plan.

Back in the container, Jasper tossed the bottles and bags into a corner, then lay down.

"These damn bastards. Once I have the money, I'll hire people to take each one of you out. I'll make you eat your own shit," Jasper muttered under his breath.

Unbeknownst to Jasper, a small round object in his stomach began to expand, and several mechanical claws emerged, attaching to the stomach wall and emitting a red light after swimming around in his stomach.

Meanwhile, Joe called Michael to report on the situation.

"Mr. Williams, everything is done. I got Jasper to swallow the Parasite Localization device. Also, there are two gold teeth here. What do you want to do with them?" Joe asked.

Michael knew why Joe was asking and casually replied, "I don't want those smelly teeth. You can keep them if you want. By the way, have you sorted out Jasper's travel plans?"

Joe chuckled, "Don't worry, Mr. Williams, it's all set. Once Jasper gets off the ship, someone will take him to the airport abroad and put him on a plane. He'll be accompanied the whole time. And you know the guy, it's Tim."

Michael laughed approvingly, "With you two on the job, I can relax. Jasper's in your hands."

Joe and Tim Bridges used to run with some local thugs and steal cars when they were younger. One time, they tried to steal Mike's car, but Mike caught them in the act.

Seeing their young age and clever looks, Mike took them under his wing, made them study, and trained them for more clandestine tasks.

Mike had introduced Joe and Tim to Michael before, and they had helped Michael with some tasks, performing exceptionally well, earning them Michael's enduring trust and admiration.

Meanwhile, Isabella had already found a restaurant for her resignation party with her colleagues.

Since John's card still had some money left, although the amount was insignificant to the Taylor Family's companies, it was enough to treat her colleagues to a meal. So, Isabella generously booked a decent-looking restaurant for her farewell party.

###chapter 297 Family Conversation

Just as Isabella rolled up to the restaurant, ready to party with her old work buddies, Michael was back at the hospital, visiting Mason and John.

The second Michael stepped into the ward, Mason jumped in, "Did you hear? Jasper busted out of the hospital."

Michael nodded. "Yeah, Mason, I heard."

Mason let out a heavy sigh, "And your guys didn't catch wind of it?"

Michael's face darkened, shaking his head, clearly pissed off by the whole mess.

After a beat of silence, Mason suddenly grinned, "Jasper played us all. Not just your crew and John's. Even the other three big families had people watching the hospital, but they never saw it coming. Jasper, who was supposed to be in a coma, slipped out right under their noses."

John's fists clenched, his voice icy and hard. "When I get my hands on Jasper, I'm breaking his legs. That old man has been messing with me, and I'm not letting it slide."

Michael just looked at John, staying silent.

Mason turned to John, his smile both knowing and challenging. "You holding up okay? Being in the crosshairs of the three big families isn't a walk in the park."

John nodded, cool as a cucumber, "It's not a big deal. I can manage my finances for now."

Mason pressed on, "If it gets too much, let me know. We're family, after all. Your uncle and I will back you up."

John's eyes locked onto Mason's, cold and unyielding. "Grandpa, is this some kind of test from you?"

Mason put on an innocent face. "Why would you think that?"

John snorted, "Only you, me, and Michael know about our bet and the property split. I doubt the lawyers and accountants would dare cross the Williams Family. They wouldn't sell out such crucial info to the three big families. So, it had to be you who told Paxton and the others about our property split, right? That's how they targeted my assets so precisely."

Mason suddenly smiled, no shame at all. He waved his hand, "Yep, I did it. I wanted to see how Paxton and the others would handle you, or if you could fend off the three big families. So far, you're doing alright."

Mason openly admitted John's suspicions.

John was fuming, his fists clenched, but he couldn't lash out, not with his grandpa and uncle right there. He couldn't fight back, even if they started it.

John's gaze shifted to Michael, who seemed lost in thought.

"Michael, do you have any way to track down Jasper, or any tricks to deal with the three big families?" John suddenly asked.

Michael's eyes flickered with surprise, a faint smile playing on his lips, "Didn't you say you could handle it yourself? Why are you asking for my help?"

'I'm just trying to remind you not to make things worse for me right now,' John thought, already feeling the pressure from the three major families. The last thing he needed was Michael adding to his problems.

"I just want to hear your advice. You've got way more experience and know-how than I do. Maybe I can learn something from you," John replied, trying to sound humble.

But Michael saw right through him. While he sneered inside, he kept a faint smile on his face.

"I'm afraid I can't offer you any useful advice," Michael said, making John's expression tighten.

Mason watched their exchange with curiosity, clearly interested in the dynamic between uncle and nephew.

"Michael, I'm your nephew. Can't you trust me even a little? Or are you worried I'll use your methods to get out of trouble and then cause problems for Isabella?" John shot back, clearly annoyed.

'You got it. I don't want you causing us any more headaches,' Michael thought, still sneering inside.

Shaking his head, Michael replied, "No need to provoke me. I really can't teach you. My experience comes from overseas, and the chaos there is a whole different ballgame. In my territory, if someone targets me, I send people to their homes, point a gun at their heads, and make them kneel. Simple as that. But here, I can't do that."

John blinked, trying to wrap his head around the kind of chaos Michael was talking about, something he'd never seen firsthand.

"Is it really that bad where you're from? Sounds like a war zone. Your dad must've been even tougher than my grandpa to build a business in that mess," John muttered.

"Talking about this is pointless. Whether it's you, me, or the three major families, we're not pros at finding people. That's a job for the police or the thugs. We just have to wait for news," Michael said with a faint smile.

"But how long do we wait? Relying on the police and thugs means that once one person finds Jasper, everyone else will know too. This city has no secrets from the four major families. Then it's a race to see who can act faster," John argued.

Michael, unfazed, just sighed and said, "Sometimes luck is its own kind of strength. If fate doesn't want you to find something, you won't. But if it does, you might just bump into what you're looking for while taking a walk in the park."

John furrowed his brows. "Michael, are you saying I should leave everything to fate?"

###chapter 298 Uncle's Advice

John was starting to think Michael was talking nonsense. Sure, some of what he said made sense, but when you really thought about it, it was almost laughable.

Michael, with a thoughtful nod, started telling John a story.

"When I was a kid, I lost a key. I looked everywhere in my room but couldn't find it. I tore the whole house apart, but still couldn't find any trace of it. Eventually, I gave up. But a few days later, while changing clothes, I found the key in the pocket of a shirt I wore two days earlier. Since then, whenever I lose something and can't find it after one search, I stop looking. Because eventually, it'll just show up." Michael shrugged, thinking back on that life lesson.

John got what Michael was saying, and Mason looked at Michael with admiration.

"We're always thinking about competing," Mason said, staring off into the distance, "but sometimes, taking a break can give you a new perspective."

John still felt uneasy. He thought maybe he would eventually hear from Jasper, but what if the other three found him first? By then, he'd get nothing.

"Damn those three major families, Paxton and his crew are just a bunch of idiots, making a big deal out of a secret that might not even exist," John angrily pounded the bed.

Mason winced, "Watch it, you hit my leg!"

John quickly pulled his hand back and started massaging Mason's leg.

Michael almost burst out laughing. Suddenly, his phone buzzed, and he checked it. His brow furrowed a bit.

Noticing Michael's change in expression, Mason asked, "What's up?"

Michael put his phone away and said, "It's my wife Estella. She's back from overseas and she's meeting a big director to talk about a new movie where she's the lead. She ran into some trouble at a restaurant, something to do with Paxton's wife."

"Need my help? Last time your wife was here, she didn't stay long. Maybe she should stay with us this time," Mason offered.

Michael shook his head. "It's nothing serious, just some minor issues. I can handle it."

With that, Michael got up, said goodbye to Mason, and left the hospital room.

After Michael left, John turned to Mason, curiosity in his eyes, "How did Michael's wife end up dealing with Paxton's wife? And you didn't seem to know about Michael's wife going abroad."

Mason shook his head with a smile, "How could I find out something Michael wants to keep secret?"

John remembered a time when Mason had doubts about Estella's true identity. But when John asked Mason why he was suspicious, Mason just looked at him and said nothing.

John wanted to ask again, but given his strained relationship with Mason, he figured Mason wouldn't tell him anything, so he kept quiet.

Meanwhile, after leaving the hospital, Michael sat in his car, his expression growing darker.

The info came from Leo, Isabella's driver who was at her farewell gathering.

Leo's message was short and sweet: [Isabella and Estella met, Zoey wants to kick Isabella out of the restaurant, and they had a conflict.]

Michael quickly texted Leo back, asking him to secretly start a video call so he could see what was going on.

Soon enough, Leo sent a video call request. When Michael answered, he saw the restaurant on the screen, with Isabella standing in front of two women, looking like they were in a standoff.

Rewind to half an hour earlier, Isabella had just arrived at the restaurant to meet up with her colleagues.

Dwayne was there too. Once everyone was there, Isabella asked him to say a few words as the leader.

Dwayne hesitated but went for it, raising his glass and saying, "Even though Isabella isn't our director anymore, her contributions have been huge. Honestly, I'll miss her, but I can't stop someone from moving up! Now that Isabella's taken over the family company as the president, let's wish her company even more success in the future!"

After Dwayne's toast, the gathering wrapped up. He wasn't the main event, and since no one really liked hearing him talk, he kept it short.

Dwayne's tactfulness made his colleagues like him more. The gathering was still cheerful until two women showed up.

"Ms. Foster, this restaurant is owned by our Brown Family. It's new, but the food is just as good as any Michelin-starred place. I know you like it quiet, so I'll book the whole place for us later," Zoey greeted Estella with a warm smile.

Estella smiled back faintly.

But when Zoey asked the restaurant manager to clear the place, his face fell, "Mrs. Brown, if you had told me a day earlier, maybe I could've done it, but now it's not possible because the restaurant is already booked." The manager looked stressed. Kicking out all the customers from a newly opened restaurant was a big deal, and the manager couldn't handle that.

As for Zoey? Forget it. As the wife of the family head, she was way more important than a lowly manager. Would Paxton punish his wife? No way. If the restaurant faced backlash, Paxton wouldn't blame his wife; the manager would be the scapegoat.

The manager looked at Zoey, hoping she'd cut him some slack and go to another restaurant.

Estella, seeing it was a lost cause, was ready to let it go, but Zoey saw Isabella and told the manager, "Get these people out now. If you can't do it, I'll call Paxton."

###chapter 299 The Boss's Wife

The restaurant manager felt a wave of dread wash over him when he heard Zoey's demanding tone.

Estella frowned at Zoey, "Zoey, there's no need for this. We can eat anywhere. Kicking out customers will hurt your family's business."

Estella's advice wasn't out of concern for Zoey or the Brown Family's business. Michael had warned her not to damage his reputation as his nominal wife, and she didn't want to upset him over something so trivial.

But Zoey's anger was boiling over. Even though she knew Isabella wasn't directly to blame for Pearl's suffering, Pearl was in this mess because she once kidnapped Isabella, so Zoey held Isabella indirectly responsible.

"Didn't you hear me? Get Isabella and her friends out of here now!" Zoey yelled at the manager.

Zoey's angry voice cut through the air, catching the attention of many.

Isabella noticed Zoey and the somewhat familiar Estella next to her.

"That middle-aged woman looks like Paxton's wife, Zoey. The woman next to her seems familiar," Isabella thought, frowning.

Dwayne recognized Estella immediately. She was Michael's wife, as he'd seen in the news.

Dwayne quickly got up and approached Estella, smiling, "Excuse me, are you Ms. Foster? I'm Dwayne, your husband is my boss."

Estella was shocked. She had been worried someone might recognize her because of Zoey, and now her fears were coming true.

'Damn, how did I run into Michael's subordinate here? This will definitely get back to Michael. Damn it! Why is Zoey ruining my reputation?' Estella glared at Zoey with resentment.

"Mr. Larson, hello. My husband often speaks highly of you," Estella greeted Dwayne politely.

Suddenly, Estella had a thought. If Dwayne was here, could the others be Michael's employees too?

"Mr. Larson, are you all here for a company event?" Estella asked curiously.

Dwayne nodded, then shook his head. "It is a company gathering, but not for business. Today is a farewell party for Ms. Taylor, who's leaving."

Dwayne glanced at Estella and then at Zoey beside her. He politely asked, "Mrs. Williams, would you like to join us? The food here is really good."

Meanwhile, as Isabella listened to Dwayne and Estella, it clicked in her mind who Estella was. She recalled seeing in the news that Estella and John's uncle, the mysterious guy, were an item.

Isabella walked over with a smile, "Mrs. Williams, you're more than welcome to join us. It'd be an honor to have you."

Estella waved off the invitation gracefully, "No need, you're too kind. I just happened to be here. I'll say hello to everyone but won't join your gathering. It might be awkward otherwise."

Estella wasn't a fool; she had sharp instincts. She knew Michael only kept her around to shut the elders up. So, she kept a low profile and avoided mentioning Michael in front of others. That's why she rarely talked about her personal life.

Isabella found Estella's behavior odd. To her, Estella seemed overly reserved and lacked the poise you'd expect from a socialite.

"Since you don't want to eat here, Mrs. Williams, can we give you a ride?" Dwayne asked politely.

Estella smiled and waved her hand, politely refusing. "No need. You all stay and enjoy your meal. Mrs. Brown and I will find somewhere else for dinner."

Estella was about to pull Zoey away, but Zoey shook off her hand.

Zoey angrily shouted at Isabella, "I remember you, you're Isabella, that bitch Bianca's sister! You and your sister hurt my daughter! What do you have to say for yourselves?"

Estella's face fell, and Dwayne's brow furrowed in concern. Isabella also looked coldly at Zoey.

"Mrs. Brown, I've already told the police everything I know. I'm sorry about what happened to your daughter, but as I've said before, I was a victim of your daughter's kidnapping. As for who took her, it has nothing to do with me," Isabella retorted icily, staring back at Zoey with resentment.

"All you women from the Taylor Family are vicious and despicable," Zoey spat, her eyes blazing with hatred, her body trembling with barely contained fury.

Although Estella cursed Zoey in her heart, she was also curious about Zoey's current expression. She wondered why Zoey acted like that.

Estella glanced at Isabella with an inquisitive eye. To her, Isabella was just a beautiful woman, nothing more. Similarly, Estella didn't know much about Isabella and the Brown Family's conflicts. Naturally, Zoey wouldn't discuss these sordid family matters with Estella.

Zoey turned her ire towards the manager, pointing at his nose. "You fool, are you deaf? I told you to get these people out. Why haven't you done anything? Do I have to do it myself?"

The manager's blood boiled as those harsh words hit him. He was here to do his job, not to be yelled at. He had worked his way up from the bottom to become a manager, thinking he had a promising future. Now, it was all being ruined by Zoey, this foolish woman.

Finally, after struggling internally, the manager addressed Zoey, "I'm sorry, Mrs. Brown, I need to make a call to Mr. Brown."

###chapter 300 Estella's Anger

The manager wrapped up his speech and pulled out his phone to call his boss. Being just a regular restaurant manager, he didn't have Paxton's number, so he had to go through a whole chain of command.

It took forever. Meanwhile, Isabella and her coworkers gathered around, curious about what was going on.

Estella felt super uncomfortable and just wanted to get out of there. Right now, people were holding back because she was Michael's wife, and no one was recording anything yet. But if someone did and sold it to the media, how would the headlines read?

#Shocking! Billionaire's Wife Caught in Restaurant Drama!#

#Billionaire's Wife in Restaurant Tussle with Employees#

#Snobby Socialite Bullies Staff, Company Stocks Tank!#

The thought of Michael's anger if this hit the news made her shiver. He might take everything away from her.

"Mrs. Brown, this restaurant was booked by employees from my husband's company, who are also my employees. How can I let our company's employees get kicked out? How will I stand in the company? How will my husband see me? If you still want to be my friend, please leave with me now." Estella's voice was firm, with a hint of warning.

As she spoke, Estella stood protectively in front of Isabella, shielding the employees behind her, presenting a fragile yet dependable figure.

Isabella's admiration for Estella grew.

The employees behind her were also secretly impressed by Estella's actions. The president's wife standing up for the lower-level employees earned her a lot of respect.

Estella, always sharp, knew her actions were strategic. She understood that her future depended on Michael, and Zoey was just someone Michael asked her to keep an eye on. Even if the mission failed, her future wouldn't change much.

Zoey started to calm down as she looked at Estella. Pearl's injury had made her really angry, causing her to lose her temper. Now, she was a bit worried about offending Estella.

Just then, Zoey's phone rang. She took it out, glanced at the screen, and her face changed. It was Paxton calling.

The manager's detailed report had finally reached Paxton, and he was furious.

When Paxton found out his wife had caused trouble again, he was so mad he almost threw his phone.

"What are you doing? We're businessmen! You want to kick customers out of the restaurant? Are you crazy? Apologize to those customers right now and then get out of there!" Paxton's angry voice boomed through the phone, making Zoey tremble.

"I understand," Zoey sighed softly and hung up.

Zoey hesitated, looking between Estella and Isabella. Turning to Dwayne and the other employees, she bowed slightly, her voice full of regret.

"I'm really sorry, everyone. I got a bit carried away. I was thinking about my poor daughter, and my emotions just got the best of me. You all know how tough things have been for her. I'm really sorry," Zoey said, tears streaming down her face. She covered her mouth, crying, and ran out of the restaurant.

Estella watched Zoey leave, feeling a bit awkward standing there.

"Mr. Larson, Isabella, I'm sorry. Zoey is a friend of mine, and her actions today have upset me too. Please accept my sincere apologies." Estella slightly bowed to Dwayne and Isabella.

"You don't have to apologize. We know this has nothing to do with you," Dwayne responded quickly.

Estella shook her head and looked at Dwayne. "Mr. Larson, please ask the employees not to spread what happened today. You know my husband likes to keep a low profile. As compensation, let me cover the expenses for this gathering."

"No need, you're too kind. I'll take care of it," Isabella quickly stepped forward to stop Estella from paying.

At that moment, the restaurant manager walked over with a smile. "Ms. Taylor, I'm sorry for the bad experience today. Mr. Brown has called me, and he will cover all your expenses at the restaurant today."

Isabella was stunned, not expecting Paxton to be so generous.

Estella's lips curved into a light jest, "Looks like I can save some money today."

She then looked at Isabella with a smile. "Ms. Taylor, it's a pity you resgined on the first day we met. I wish you all the best in your future career. I have other matters to attend to now. Please, enjoy the rest of your evening."

After saying goodbye to Isabella and Dwayne, Estella left the restaurant.

Isabella watched Estella leave and smiled. "I never imagined the boss's wife to be so gentle. He must cherish her deeply."

Dwayne nodded in agreement. "I think so. I wish I had such a beautiful and gentle wife."

The driver Leo, who was hiding in the crowd, smirked when he heard the conversation between Isabella and Dwayne. Michael, who was also on the phone, heard it too.

Michael sighed helplessly. He had already seen from the video that Estella was implicated by Zoey, and everything that happened today couldn't be blamed on her. She had managed the situation with commendable poise.

Michael decided to call Jerry later and ask him to provide Estella with more resources, so she could get more attention.

On the other side, Estella had no idea that a surprise was about to come her way. She found Zoey crying outside the restaurant.

Frowning, Estella approached, her voice gentle yet probing, "Mrs. Brown, what happened?"

Zoey wiped her tears. She knew her behavior today had caused Estella's dissatisfaction and sought to make amends. She had found a way to begin.

Zoey took out her phone, opened a picture, and when Estella saw it, her body trembled, almost dropping the phone.

"Who is this woman?" Estella asked in amazement.

Pain showed in Zoey's eyes. "This is my daughter. I'm sorry, Ms. Foster. I lost my temper earlier because of Isabella, who I suspect is one of the people who hurt her."

###chapter 301 Crying Zoey

Estella, new to the city, had no clue about the events that had unfolded there.

Right now, Estella was stunned as Zoey pulled out a photo of Pearl.

The girl in the picture was a horrifying sight. Her limbs were gone, leaving just her torso. Her eyes were gouged out, her nose was cut off, and her head was shaved, with IV tubes sticking out. It was both tragic and terrifying.

"You suspect Isabella did all this, but it doesn't seem like her. She looks so gentle. How could she possibly do something so cruel?" Estella's voice trembled with shock.

Zoey wiped her tears and shook her head. "I don't have any proof that Isabella did this. But my husband once had some evidence pointing to Isabella's sister. Her sister got my daughter to kidnap Isabella. She's a very malicious woman."

Estella blinked, trying to piece together what Zoey had said. Isabella's sister had Zoey's daughter kidnap Isabella. Now, Isabella seemed unharmed, so the kidnapping must have failed, but Zoey's daughter ended up like this. Was this Isabella's sister's revenge for the failed kidnapping?

Estella was confused but decided not to dig deeper. Bringing this up now would just reopen Zoey's wounds and make her relive those painful memories. It would be rude and insensitive.

"Everything will be okay, Mrs. Brown. I believe your daughter will recover, and justice will be served." Estella tried to comfort Zoey, giving her a hug.

Zoey cried bitterly in Estella's arms, showing the helplessness and sorrow of a mother whose daughter had been dismembered.

What Estella didn't notice was that despite Zoey's tears, there was a glint of relief in her eyes, revealing her calculated thoughts.

Growing up in a big family, Zoey might not be very emotional, but she was good at reading people.

Earlier at the restaurant, in a moment of anger, she had embarrassed Estella. Now, by using Pearl's tragic state and a mother's grief, it was easy for Estella, also a woman, to sympathize with her. The rift between them would soon be mended.

Meanwhile, despite the earlier unpleasant incident at Isabella's gathering, everyone quickly got over it. The atmosphere became lively again.

Isabella accepted toasts from her colleagues and drank a lot. Even though she could handle her alcohol, she was feeling a bit tipsy.

After the party wrapped up, Isabella declined her colleagues' invitation to go singing, saying she needed to head home. However, she encouraged Juliet to take everyone out for a night of fun.

With the help of her driver, Leo, Isabella got into the car, her cheeks flushed from the wine. She smiled at Leo, her voice soft but clear. "Leo, thanks for taking me home. You don't need to pick me up for work tomorrow."

Leo glanced in the rearview mirror. Even though Isabella was drunk, she was still coherent.

Leo returned her smile warmly. "Isabella, if you don't mind, I'd like to keep being your driver. As a CEO, you shouldn't drive yourself, and hiring a new driver could be risky with the four major families lurking around. It's safer if I take the wheel."

Isabella was surprised. She didn't expect Leo to make the same offer as Juliet.

"How can that be? You're not like Juliet. She's new and just an assistant. Maybe the boss doesn't value her that much, but you're an old hand at the company, personally assigned by the boss to be my driver. Now I'm about to resign. If the boss finds out I took you with me, he might not be happy." Isabella shook her head, turning down Leo's offer.

Leo felt a bit awkward. Sometimes one lie led to countless others, but he knew how to persuade Isabella.

"Isabella, I have my reasons. You've seen how I've worked these past days. If I stay as your driver, I know you'll treat me well. Before you, I drove for some people who were nothing like you. They were all so picky! I never felt respected by them, but I had to endure it for my family's sake. Honestly, I wasn't happy." Leo gave a bitter smile.

This was the script Leo had agreed on with Michael. 

Leo had always been the kind of guy who worked hard for his family, while Isabella was a gentle and kind-hearted woman. When she learned about Leo's struggles, it was only natural for her to feel sympathy for him.

But as Leo thought about his conversation with Michael, his expression showed signs of inner turmoil. The idea of manipulating his wife left him feeling hesitant.

Things unfolded just as Michael had predicted.

Hearing Leo's words, Isabella hesitated. Leo had been very helpful, always on time and handling other troubles efficiently. He was undoubtedly competent.

Leo suddenly smiled and said, "If you're worried about explaining to the boss, I've already talked to him. Don't think the boss is all serious. He's actually very humorous and generous. He said he respects my decision, and as long as you agree, my resignation will be processed immediately. After all, I'm just a driver."

"Did you really talk to the boss? If that's the case, then come work for me, and your salary will stay the same for now." Isabella smiled. Since Leo had already talked to the boss, she had nothing to worry about.

Leo breathed a sigh of relief. Luckily, Isabella bought their story this time. If she hadn't, he would have had to come up with another excuse. Constantly lying was exhausting.

When they arrived at the villa, Isabella was dozing in the back seat. The exhaustion of the day, combined with the effects of the alcohol, had left her feeling incredibly drowsy.

By this time, Michael had returned to the villa. Leo got out of the car and informed Michael that Isabella was asleep.

Michael walked to the car, opened the door, and saw Isabella sleeping soundly in the back seat.

Michael smiled, leaned in, and gently picked up Isabella.

Isabella's nose twitched, catching the familiar cedar scent, and she hugged Michael's neck.

Seeing this intimate moment, Leo allowed himself a small, knowing smile. "You and Ms. Taylor seem very close."

As he spoke, he made an 'OK' gesture, signaling Michael to take over as Isabella's driver again.
###chapter 302 Drunk Isabella

Michael gave Leo a nod, signaling him to head back and get some rest. Then he scooped up Isabella and carried her back to the villa.

When he laid her on the bed, her hand was still wrapped around his neck.

Michael sighed with a grin. "Babe, if you were really asleep, you wouldn't be holding on so tight. You're practically choking me."

Isabella opened her eyes, smiled, gave Michael a peck on the cheek, and then let go, flopping onto the bed.

"Michael, I wanna take a bath, but I'm so tired," Isabella pouted, her voice slurred from the alcohol.

Michael chuckled and started unbuttoning her coat to make her more comfortable.

"You're not dirty yet; didn't you just bathe yesterday? If you want to sleep better, I can grab a wet towel and clean you up a bit, and help you take off your makeup. Sleeping with makeup on isn't great for your skin." He kissed her forehead and headed to the bathroom.

Isabella propped her chin on her hand, watching him through her drunken haze.

Michael's silhouette moved behind the bathroom glass, the sound of running water filling the room. Soon, he came back with a warm, damp towel.

"Do you want to undress yourself, or should I help?" Michael asked with a smile.

Isabella didn't respond, just stretched out her arms and closed her eyes.

Michael shook his head, smiling, and placed the towel on the bedside table. He then unbuttoned her shirt and skirt.

Before long, she was down to her underwear. The black lace lingerie clung to her skin, looking incredibly tempting.

Michael felt a fire ignite inside him. If he remembered right, today was the last day of Isabella's period.

But seeing her tired face, his desire started to fade.

Feeling the warm towel on her arms, Isabella opened her eyes and saw Michael's serious, focused expression.

"Michael, are you not into my body anymore? Am I not attractive to you?" Isabella pouted, looking upset.

Michael smiled at her pouty face. "You get so lively when you're drunk."

"Don't change the subject, you jerk. Tell me, are you tired of me?" Tears started to well up in her eyes.

Michael sighed and gently tapped her forehead. "Your body is amazing. How could I ever be tired of you? I'm just not in the mood right now. You're exhausted and need to rest. Once you're fully recovered, we can pick up where we left off."

With that, Michael grabbed her other arm and continued to wipe her down.

Just as Michael finished wiping one arm and was about to move to her thighs, he suddenly heard a soft sob.

He turned and saw Isabella crying, her eyes red and puffy.

"Hey, why are you crying? Did I say something wrong?" Michael quickly wrapped his arms around her.

Isabella clung to his waist, crying even louder. "You're so good to me, Michael. No one has ever treated me this well, not even my dad."

Michael stroked her hair, smiling gently. "What about Mason? He's good to you too."

"No, he's more like a grandfather. It's not the same." Isabella pouted and gave Michael's leg a playful slap, blaming him for ruining the moment.

Michael chuckled and hugged her tighter. "As long as you like it, I'll keep being good to you."

Isabella hugged his waist and looked up at him. "Michael, we've been married for so long but haven't had a wedding or taken any photos. Once I get the company shares, let's take wedding photos and have a big wedding."

Michael nodded and kissed her forehead. "Of course, babe. Where do you want to take the wedding photos?"

Isabella tilted her head, then shook it. "I don't know. I want something special, not just green screens or around this city. I'm tired of the same old sights."

"Then we'll go on location-snow-capped mountains, grasslands, rivers. We'll capture the most beautiful places in the world. How does that sound?" Michael asked, looking down at her.

Isabella's eyes lit up, and she nodded eagerly. "I think it's a great idea. Let's travel the world and take photos."

"Okay, babe, I'll remember this promise! But first, let me finish cleaning you up so you can get some sleep." Michael kissed her forehead again and continued to wipe her down.

This time, Isabella didn't cry; she looked genuinely happy.

After Michael finished wiping her down, he started to help her remove her makeup.

Isabella had planned to do it herself, as it involved a whole skincare routine. But Michael surprised her by skillfully removing her makeup and applying the skincare products.

"How are you so good at this? Many women can't even do it as well as you," Isabella said, looking at him in amazement.

Michael smiled proudly. As the boss of a cosmetics company, he knew these things well.

"I learned by watching videos. I guess I have a knack for it. When I was watching those videos, all I could think about was you, so I picked it up quickly." Michael's words made Isabella feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

"Well done. When I'm less busy, I'll reward you properly." Isabella winked and then snuggled under the blanket to sleep.

###chapter 303 Estella's Rationality

After wrapping everything up, Michael glanced at Isabella's sleeping face and smiled softly.

Out of nowhere, Michael's phone buzzed. It was Jerry.

Michael frowned, quickly silenced his phone, and slipped out of the bedroom.

He answered, and Jerry's voice came through.

"Mr. Williams, Estella called. She said Zoey and Isabella had a spat today because Zoey thinks Isabella and Bianca messed with her daughter," Jerry reported.

Estella had planned to call Michael herself but decided it wasn't urgent enough to risk annoying him, so she called Jerry instead. Smart move. Even though she felt bad for Zoey, she knew where her bread was buttered.

After filling him in, Jerry chuckled. "Mr. Williams, what do you think of Estella? She's sharp and level-headed. We already knew about the stuff she reported, but I'm impressed with how she handled it."

"Are you sure you know everything?" Michael asked with a sly smile.

Jerry was caught off guard. "Mr. Williams, do you think Estella's holding back?"

Michael shook his head, still smiling. "Not that she's hiding anything, but we can pick up some clues from her chat with Zoey."

"Like what?" Jerry asked, puzzled.

"Didn't Estella mention it? Zoey suspects Bianca had a hand in her daughter's mess. This backs up our earlier hunch. Could a pissed-off mom like Zoey have set up the car explosion that involved John?" Michael said.

Jerry was stunned for a moment. He suddenly remembered the car explosion case involving John, a big deal with no suspects found. The cops later ID'd three missing hotel employees, all wanted criminals last seen in a Brown Family-controlled area, but they vanished into thin air.

Some folks pointed fingers at Paxton, but he'd never admit it, and the cops wouldn't easily link it to the Brown Family. The area where the thugs were last seen was just a minor part of the Brown Family's empire. With the four major families running so many businesses in this city, it's tough to pin down which family might be involved just based on where the thugs showed up.

Michael and Jerry had also dug up a nasty incident in a Brown Family apartment where three people were burned to death. No one connected them to the explosion suspects, which screamed foul play.

"Tell Estella to keep in touch with Zoey. And give her a pat on the back from me; she did great today." With that, Michael hung up.

That night, Estella was over the moon when she got a call from Jerry.

"Mr. Williams is really happy with your work today. He's decided to invest more in you and wanted me to give you a pat on the back," Jerry said coolly.

Hearing Jerry's praise, Estella was almost in tears. Finally, she had made the right move.

"Got it, Jerry. Please tell Mr. Williams I'll work hard on everything he gives me." With that, Estella hung up.

"Sorry, Zoey. You're using me, but I'm using you too. Sympathy alone won't get me a better life! We're in different leagues. So don't blame me," Estella whispered to herself.

Meanwhile, Isabella woke up the next day and started getting ready. She had something big today.

As the new CEO of the Taylor Group, she had to hold a press conference. Even though the family had seen better days, it still caught the media's eye.

When Isabella was ready and came out to the living room, Michael had breakfast waiting for her.

"Morning, babe. Ready to face the media?" Michael asked, handing her breakfast with a smile.

Isabella nodded confidently. "I've been dealing with reporters since I could walk and talk, even in diapers."

Michael chuckled, "Well, I'll be watching your live broadcast on TV. If you need help, just call me with a hidden earpiece, and I'll guide you."

Rolling her eyes, Isabella said, "I don't need you to teach me! By the way, are you sure you don't want to work at my company?"

This was the second time Isabella had asked him.

Michael shook his head. "Babe, give me some time to think it over. Your company isn't going anywhere."

Isabella nodded. "Okay, I respect your choice."

After quickly finishing breakfast, Isabella heard a car honk outside. It was her driver, Leo, ready to pick her up.

"Alright, babe, I gotta go. Don't forget to watch the live broadcast." Isabella kissed Michael on the cheek and headed out the door.

Michael waved as the car drove off, then settled back on the sofa.

This time, Michael called another subordinate.

"How did the investigation go? Can you confirm if Carol was supported by the charity fund?" Michael asked.

The person on the other end replied, "I infiltrated the charity fund now controlled by the Brown Family and found Carol's file. Mr. Williams, everything you asked me to check out is true."

###chapter 304 Michael's Investigation

Isabella was now the CEO of the family business, and Michael, being her husband, was all about clearing the path for her.

Michael took a deep dive into the Taylor Family's three companies and spotted a bunch of issues. He figured Isabella would catch on too, so he didn't plan on spelling it out for her. Instead, he had other moves in mind.

Michael was all about nipping problems in the bud. Even though Carol had helped Isabella before and seemed to be on their side, he wasn't going to ease up and he would dig into her cautiously.

"Send me all the other files you found. I want to take a closer look," Michael said over the phone.

The person on the other end agreed, and soon enough, Michael got an email.

He opened it up and found info about the charitable fund Isabella's family had back in their heyday. Her grandpa, Patrick, had been a big-time philanthropist.

"If Carol supported Isabella because she wanted to pay back her grandfather, could there be others with the same motive?" Michael wondered, rubbing his chin as he started digging.

Michael never forgot the ring Patrick left behind, a symbol of identity and family. Anyone who recognized it would help Isabella without question.

But Michael couldn't wrap his head around why Patrick chose this way to protect the family. Plus, the people sent to restore the family didn't know each other, making it look like some kind of secret operation.

Michael's computer screen was split into two: one side showing the current senior execs of the three companies, and the other showing the charitable fund files.

After a while, Michael frowned.

He found a lot of overlap between the two files. Most of the people who were once sponsored were now working in these three companies.

"I knew it wouldn't be that easy. Is it a coincidence or Patrick's plan?"Michael narrowed his eyes.

Some senior execs were leaning towards John. If they were truly loyal, they wouldn't act that way. Clearly, Carol was just an exception; not everyone who had accepted Patrick's charity could ba trusted.

"If their goal is to restore the family's glory, Isabella just needs to show she can lead these companies out of trouble and expand. They should come forward voluntarily," Michael murmured, deciding his next steps.

Meanwhile, the driver Leo took Isabella straight to the Taylor Family's company building. A bunch of reporters had gathered downstairs for a press conference.

Soon, Isabella showed up, and the reporters swarmed her, shoving microphones in her face.

"Isabella, have you officially taken over your father's company now?"

"Isabella, we heard that you and your sister Bianca have been fighting for shares in the company. How did you win?"

"Yes, Isabella, we heard that many senior executives in your company were more inclined towards John, but this time you won. Will there be any conflicts with them?"

"Isabella, is your first act as the company's CEO to overturn all of your father's business practices?"

Facing the barrage of questions, Isabella stood at the company's entrance and addressed the reporters seriously. "I'll answer each of your questions.

"First off, regarding my current shares, yes, I am now the CEO. While I haven't secured all the shares from my father, that's not the main issue anymore.

"Secondly, about how I won over my sister and got those shares? That's tied up in some business secrets, so it's not something I can discuss with the media.

"As for the senior executives leaning towards John, I get it. Everyone saw the company's struggles before. But I'm confident I can lead us to success without John's help.

"And about overturning my father's business practices, I'll keep the good parts and change what needs fixing."

Isabella answered the reporters' questions with a calm demeanor.

Upstairs, Carol watched through the window, smiling.

"Very good, looks like I made the right choice. I hope you like my next gift, Isabella," Carol smiled, heading back to her office.

Meanwhile, Isabella stayed outside for almost an hour, fielding all the reporters' questions.

Just as she was about to wrap things up, a reporter wearing a mask rushed over.

"Isabella, I have one last question for you." The reporter approached with a microphone.

Isabella extended her hand politely. "Sure, go ahead."

The reporter asked, "Under your father's control, there were reports of bribery, sex trade, and suppressing competent colleagues. Will you deal with these people strictly?"

Isabella looked at the reporter with a determined glint in her eyes and nodded seriously.

"I will dig into the root of it. If these things did happen, I will use legal means to address them," Isabella said firmly to all the reporters.

This moment was captured and posted online, and soon news about Isabella becoming the new CEO went viral. Despite their waning influence, the Browns Family still drew a lot of attention.

Reporters wrote numerous articles based on Isabella's press conference and posted them online. With her popularity, the news spread quickly throughout the city.

Bianca saw Isabella on the news and angrily threw her phone.

"Damn it, this position was supposed to be mine! Isabella, you damn bitch!" Bianca yelled furiously in her bedroom.

Just then, a call came in. Bianca picked up the phone from the floor, surprise flashing in her eyes.

###chapter 305 Break the Fortress form the inside

Bianca picked up the phone, and a familiar voice greeted her from the other end.

"Bet you're about ready to smash your phone, huh?" the voice teased.

Bianca rolled her eyes and flopped back onto the bed. "You called just to rub it in, didn't you? Isabella's snagged 40% of the company's shares and is now the CEO. There's nothing left for me to fight for."

The voice chuckled. "Your business sense is seriously lacking. And it seems like your brain's gone soft over John."

"Enough. If you don't have anything useful to say, just hang up. I'm not in the mood for your crap," Bianca snapped, ready to end the call.

But the voice on the other end cut in, sounding impatient. "Alright, alright, I'll stop. I called for a reason. You want to take down Isabella, right? Just because she's CEO now doesn't mean you can't get to her. Sometimes, the best way to break a fortress is from the inside."

Bianca paused, frowning. "What are you getting at? Are you saying I should go into the company and find someone to take her down?"

The voice went silent for a moment, then asked, surprised, "Didn't you watch Isabella's whole press conference?"

Bianca snorted. "I only caught a bit of it. I dropped my phone when I heard she was giving her inaugural speech."

The person on the phone sounded angry. "You're such an idiot. Do you think being John's girl means you can ignore all your enemies? You're clueless about business and overly arrogant. To beat an enemy, you need to understand them. Now go watch that damn press conference and call me back."

The call ended abruptly. Annoyed but curious, Bianca followed the advice and rewatched Isabella's press conference. Her eyes lit up when the last reporter asked about internal staff misconduct.

Bianca quickly redialed, and the voice answered.

"Finished watching? Know what to do next?" the voice asked coldly.

Bianca smirked. "I almost forgot about those troublemakers in the company. They must be freaking out now. But I don't have much contact with them. Can you give me some info?"

Soon, an email notification popped up on her phone.

"The info's in your inbox. It's got dirt on the company's internal staff. It might not take Isabella down, but it could give you some leverage," the voice said before hanging up.

Bianca carefully went through the email. When she finished, a cold smile spread across her face.

"Just wait, Isabella. This time, you're going down!" Bianca muttered, clenching her fist.

Meanwhile, Isabella strolled back into the CEO's office after the press conference.

Juliet was already there, looking thrilled to see her.

"Ms. Taylor, what do you need me to do?" Juliet asked eagerly.

Isabella settled into her chair, smiling. "Go find Ms. Lester, the head of HR, and ask her to come see me."

"On it, Ms. Taylor," Juliet said, hurrying out.

A few minutes later, Juliet returned with Carol. She knocked and stepped inside.

"Ms. Taylor, Ms. Lester is here," Juliet announced politely.

"Thanks, Juliet. You can go now," Isabella said, waving her off. Juliet left, closing the door behind her.

"I heard this assistant came from your old company. Not bad, she's not too nosy and follows orders well," Carol said with a smile, glancing at the door.

Isabella motioned for Carol to sit on the couch, then joined her, still smiling. "She's got potential. With the right guidance, she could become a top businesswoman someday."

"I trust your instincts, but you didn't call me here just to chat about your assistant, did you?" Carol asked, smiling.

Isabella shook her head, her expression turning serious. "I need to shake up the company's personnel. We need to get rid of those who supported my father, those who broke company rules, and John's people. He's been investing in the company for a long time; I'm sure he's planted his own people here."

Isabella laid out her plan, confident Carol would provide the information she needed.

Carol tilted her head, looking at Isabella with a smile. "Are you sure about this? Many of the rule-breakers are actually members of the Taylor Family. Some are even your elders. After the family fell apart, your father gave them jobs here. If you clear them all out, people might say you're heartless."

Isabella glanced at the gloomy sky outside the window. The gray clouds felt suffocating.

"When there's rot, the best way is to cut it all out and treat the healthy parts. Only then can the body heal. Holding onto the decay will just drag everything down, turning the company into a corpse for crows and vultures," Isabella said calmly.

Carol looked impressed and pulled out a USB drive. "Here's the info you wanted. You can investigate further, but be careful. Some of these people are pretty ruthless."

Isabella took the USB drive without flinching. "It's fine. I've faced death more times than I can count."

###chapter 306 Michael's Concerns

Carol felt something off in Isabella's words.

Carol looked into Isabella's eyes, curious. "What made you the way you are?"

Isabella shrugged with a smile. "When you have a sister who wants you dead and parents who aren't much better, you get desperate."

Carol blinked, remembering the news about Isabella and the shocking details of her trial. Carol had never thought any parents could want their own child to die.

"Surviving that mess must've been tough," Carol sighed.

Isabella smiled, walking behind her desk and plugging a USB drive into the computer. "I've had a lot of close calls, even almost getting killed by a wild boar once. But I always managed to survive, mostly thanks to my husband. Though there was that one time I should thank two kangaroos."

"Wait, kangaroos? Like super kangaroos?" Carol asked, intrigued.

"Yeah, they were like super kangaroos. I named them Optimus Prime and Megatron. They once stomped a wild boar to death," Isabella said casually, scrolling through the USB drive's contents and recounting her wild forest adventures.

"Seems like you've had some divine intervention. Anyway, I have work to do, so I'll leave you to it," Carol said, smiling as she left. But Isabella's smile faded as she looked at the USB drive's contents.

The USB had dirt on the company's top brass, including serious stuff like bribery and inappropriate behavior with female employees.

One supervisor had raped a female subordinate, paid her off, and kept her as his mistress because she had a sick mom. When she got pregnant, he arranged an abortion. Most appallingly, he killed her sick mother..

The subordinate eventually jumped off a building. The police found what looked like a suicide note in her room.

The USB had photos of the note, torn from a notebook, which looked more like diary entries to Isabella.

'My mom is gone. What do I do? I feel so hopeless. Is death my only way out?'

The note ended abruptly, not because she wrote so little, but because part of it was torn off.

Isabella squinted, examining the document. The info pointed to a guy named Duncan Taylor, who was from Isabella's own family.

Isabella stroked her chin, packaged the USB contents into an email, and sent it to Michael.

Soon, Michael called her.

"Hey, what did you send me? Looks like some dirt on your company's people," Michael said with a smile over the phone.

Isabella nodded, speaking seriously. "I need you to help me check if this stuff is true. Some of these people have bad records, but most of it seems like rumors. We need solid proof."

Michael was always there to help Isabella dig up whatever she needed, and he had some top-notch private detectives on speed dial.

"No problem, babe, I got this. By the way, what do you want for dinner? I'm not working late, so I can whip up something special to celebrate your first day as CEO," Michael said, smiling over the phone.

Isabella smiled too, despite being furious about the dirty things her subordinates had done. She wasn't going to let those jerks ruin her mood.

"How about some pan-seared cod?" Isabella suggested.

"Consider it done, babe. It'll be ready when you get home," Michael replied, chatting a bit more before hanging up.

After the call, Michael's face darkened as he read through the email.

"If this stuff is legit, these guys are going to rot in prison," Michael muttered, narrowing his eyes as he dialed his driver, Leo.

Leo, cruising around the city, pulled over to take the call.

Leo's main gig was chauffeuring Isabella to and from work, so he had plenty of downtime to kill.

Michael's tone was serious. "Did you catch Isabella's press conference? She might've pissed off some folks at the company. I have no idea how they'll react, so you need to protect her. Use force if necessary. I'll arrange for some discreet backup too."

Leo's face turned serious. "Got it, Mr. Williams. I'll make sure Ms. Taylor is safe."

Leo hung up, drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, and headed to a hidden spot. When he came back to the car, he had two handguns, extra magazines, and a bulletproof vest.

He put on the vest and covered it with his jacket. Leo thought, 'Maybe I should get a vest for Mrs. Williams too?'

After a moment's hesitation, he went back to the hideout, grabbed another vest from it, tucked it under the car seat, and headed back to Isabella's office.

Meanwhile, in a nearby café, a shady-looking middle-aged man ordered coffee and sat by the window.

He stirred his coffee, making clinking sounds, and kept glancing at his watch, looking impatient.

Just then, a waitress approached and placed a piece of paper in front of him.

He looked at the paper, which had a series of numbers on it. Smiling at the waitress, he asked, "Is this your number?"

The waitress, clearly grossed out by his sleazy grin, kept her cool. "No, sir, someone asked me to give this to you. They said it's about your fate."

###chapter 307 Bianca's Warning

Duncan glanced at the number on the paper and waved the waitress away.

He checked his watch again, annoyed that his appointment was late. But then he looked at the paper again and something clicked.

Duncan pulled out his phone and dialed the number. The call was answered quickly, and a slightly hoarse voice came through.

"Sorry, sir, I can't meet you in person. This is the only way to contact me," the voice said casually.

Fuming, Duncan snapped, "It's really you, you jerk! You emailed me to meet, and now you stand me up? Don't you realize how precious my time is?"

The person on the phone mocked, "Oh, did I mess up your routine of harassing and assaulting female subordinates? If so, my bad."

Duncan's eyes narrowed. "I don't know what you're talking about. I've never done anything like that. Keep slandering me, and I'll gather evidence and sue you."

The voice on the phone laughed, then turned icy. "That girl's name is Maddy Ramos, right? You hired thugs to beat her and cause a miscarriage, threatened her mom, went too far and caused her death, and then pushed Maddy down the stairs. Think no one knows? You still have that torn diary, don't you?"

Duncan's pupils shrank. He looked around nervously, then lowered his voice. "What do you want?"

The voice on the phone was cold. "Relax, I'm not the police. I'm calling about Isabella."

"Isabella? Our new CEO? You want me to target her?" Duncan's eyes narrowed, guessing the guy's intentions.

The voice didn't hide it. "Exactly. I want you to take her out. Not just at work, but completely."

"Are you nuts? You want me to take her out? How am I supposed to do that?" Duncan growled through gritted teeth.

The voice sneered, "What if she's planning to take you out? Remember what she said at the press conference. You're smart, think about all the crap you've pulled over the years. You're worthless to the company, just a dirty bug. Isabella wants to clean house and win over the employees. The best way is to get rid of you bugs. Think those you've bullied won't snitch?"

A flash of nervousness crossed Duncan's eyes. His reputation at the company was trash. If Isabella wanted to clean up, someone would definitely rat him out. Even if they didn't have solid proof, Isabella might find something if she dug around.

"Isabella's been kidnapped before, so she's probably got some serious security. I only know street thugs, and they don't have the guts to kill," Duncan admitted. Most of the killing he had done before was accidental or due to excessive force.

So far, Duncan had only directly caused one death, the poor pregnant girl Maddy. But he wasn't dumb; he wouldn't personally go and kill someone.

The voice on the phone snapped, "Is your brain full of mush? Bugs like you are all over the company, and Isabella will definitely get rid of you. Gather your people, hire some real hitmen. It's not hard. Those thugs won't do it because you're not paying enough!"

The suggestion made Duncan pause. It was a way out. Instead of waiting for Isabella to target him, maybe it was better to take her out first.

"If we do this, Mason might retaliate," Duncan said cautiously.

But the voice on the phone reassured him, "No one will retaliate against you. Once Isabella is dead, the company shares will transfer to Bianca, and she can protect you all."

Duncan's eyes lit up. "Are you with Bianca?" he asked quickly.

The voice neither confirmed nor denied. "Finish this quickly, if you don't want to end up in jail."

With that, the call ended.

Duncan tried calling back, but the phone was off and he couldn't get through.

On the other end, Bianca took out the SIM card, used tweezers to pick it up, held it in front of a lighter, and completely destroyed it.

Then, Bianca removed the voice changer from her neck. "Isabella, let's see how you'll fight me this time. Don't blame me when you meet your maker," Bianca said with a bitter smile.

Realizing he couldn't reach the caller again, Duncan slammed the table hard, then stood up, paid the bill, and left the coffee shop. He needed to gather his allies in the company to figure out how to deal with Isabella. He couldn't do this alone.

Finding those targeted by Isabella wasn't hard. Duncan and Isabella were from the same family, and most of the wrongdoers were too.

Duncan made a few calls, gathered them in an empty meeting room, and explained the crisis. They were all on edge.

"We absolutely have to stop that bitch Isabella. We can't let her find out what we've done," a woman screamed.

"I just took a little money. Her father was corrupt too. Why doesn't she go after him first?" someone complained.

Duncan looked at them coldly. "Complaining won't help now. We need to unite to take down Isabella. I don't have enough money, so let's pool our resources and hire a hitman."

###chapter 308 The Killer Appears

Isabella got home from work and found Michael had whipped up her favorite dish, pan-seared cod. As they ate, she shot him a playful grin.

"Hey babe, my period's over," she said with a wink.

But Michael didn't take the bait. He just smiled, brushed a strand of hair from her face, and said, "You must've had a crazy day at work. You look beat. How about you get some rest? We can pick this up when you're feeling better."

Michael could see how tired she was. He wasn't the kind of guy who let his urges take over. Sure, Isabella made it hard to resist, but he had willpower.

Isabella felt touched. She remembered their promise but knew she was exhausted.

"Thanks, hon," she said with a smile and kept eating.

That night, they just slept, nothing more.

Meanwhile, someone put a hefty bounty on Isabella online, drawing in some dangerous hitmen who started making plans.

The next day at work, Isabella had a weird feeling, like something bad was about to happen.

Juliet came by with some documents and noticed Isabella looked off. "Ms. Taylor, are you feeling okay? You don't look so good," she asked, concerned.

Isabella smiled and shook her head. "I think I just didn't sleep well last night. Probably too tired."

She chalked it up to work stress, not realizing it was a sign of something bigger.

After work, Isabella wrapped up her tasks and headed to the parking lot.

Leo was there to pick her up and drive her home.

But halfway there, Leo's face got serious. "Ms. Taylor, we're being followed."

Isabella's heart skipped a beat. She checked the rearview mirror but couldn't tell which car it was in the rush hour traffic.

"What's going on, Leo? What did you see?" she asked, nervous.

Leo squinted at the mirror. "A black Honda's been tailing us. I saw it in the parking lot but didn't think much of it. It's been on us since we left. I tried losing it, but no luck."

Isabella spotted the black Honda, with two masked figures inside.

"Should we call the cops?" she asked, grabbing her phone.

Leo didn't stop her. Instead, he handed her a bulletproof vest.

"Put this on. It's rush hour, so they probably won't shoot, but we can't be sure," Leo said, dead serious.

Isabella looked at the traffic around them and frowned. "What if we just park somewhere crowded? They probably won't follow us there, right?"

But Leo was busy with something on his phone. Isabella leaned over, confused, and saw he was messaging someone.

Suddenly, Leo put his phone away and said, "It's worse than you think. There's a $3 million bounty on you. That's enough to make some real crazies come after you. Crowded places might actually be more dangerous. You don't want a random pizza guy pulling a knife on you, do you?"

Isabella quickly put on the bulletproof vest. "Three million? Who would do this?"

Leo shook his head. "No idea. Maybe it's related to your press conference. I had a bad feeling after that, so I got this gear ready. Let's hope we're just being paranoid."

"What if we just stay in the car?" Isabella asked, her voice shaking.

Leo gave a bitter smile and shook his head. "I'm worried some nutjob might have planted a bomb under the car."

Before he could finish, the roar of motorcycles filled the air. Leo glanced in the rearview mirror, his face going pale.

"These maniacs!" Leo ignored the traffic lights and floored it.

Two guys on motorcycles, wearing leather jackets and helmets, sped up to their car, swinging steel pipes at the windows.

Isabella ducked down, hugging her head. The pipes cracked the glass but didn't break it.

The thugs looked surprised by the tough glass. While they were stunned, Leo swerved and hit one of them, knocking him down.

The other thug pulled out a disc-like object and threw it at the car.

Leo's face changed. He hit the gas and turned the wheel sharply.

The disc was supposed to stick to the car, but Leo's sudden turn made it fall to the ground. It exploded, startling everyone.

"These lunatics are using bombs! Is $3 million really worth it?" Isabella shouted, both scared and furious.

Leo shook his head. "You don't get it. Three million is life-changing for some people. The money you rich folks lose in a game could be more than some people make in a lifetime."

###chapter 309 Leo Gets Injured

With that, Leo revved up the engine and they sped off.

"Where to next? Maybe we should head straight to the police station. They wouldn't dare follow us there," Isabella suggested, clearly pissed off.

"These guys are nuts; they don't care about their lives. The cops might not be able to protect us, and we're pretty far from the station," Leo replied, noticing a few cars tailing them.

"Shit, these guys are total maniacs," Leo muttered, gritting his teeth as he weaved through the streets. The thugs were trying to push them towards less crowded roads, making it easier to attack.

Leo had no choice. If he headed to crowded place, the heavy traffic would mean stopping and risking bombs being planted on their car.

Facing a bunch of crazies, stopping wasn't an option.

As the car started to slow down, Leo's face turned grim.

"Dammit, the car's got a problem, probably from that explosion earlier," Leo said, slapping the dashboard.

Isabella's heart was racing.

"It's okay, Ms. Taylor, I'll protect you," Leo assured her, scanning their surroundings. The dense forest might be their only shot.

Leo floored it, then parked the car in the forest. He jumped out, pulling a handgun from his waist.

"Let's go, Isabella, we need to get out of here," Leo said, leading her deeper into the woods.

Meanwhile, Michael got Leo's distress call. His eyes were bloodshot with anger.

"You idiots, didn't I tell you to protect Isabella secretly? Is this how you do it?" Michael yelled into the phone.

The subordinate replied, "Mr. Williams, we couldn't get too close or Isabella would notice us. Rush hour traffic separated us from Mrs. Williams, and by the time we got there, Leo had driven too far away."

"I don't want your excuses. Find them and take out those damn killers!" Michael shouted, then slammed his phone on the ground.

After taking a deep breath, Michael picked up the phone and made another call. "Track Leo and Isabella's location. I need to know where they are."

The subordinate quickly provided the info. Michael gathered his team and rushed to their location.

In the depths of the forest, Isabella and Leo were running like crazy. Despite the rough terrain, some of the thugs were skilled trackers, hot on their trail.

Suddenly, Leo tackled Isabella as a bullet whizzed past their heads.

Leo turned, raised his gun, and with two quick shots, two thugs fell to the ground, clutching their chests.

"Exciting, huh? Never thought I'd be back in the bodyguard game," Leo joked, grabbing Isabella's hand and pulling her along.

Isabella gritted her teeth, trying to keep up with Leo. Her high heels were slowing her down, and she wanted to stop and break them off to run faster.

Suddenly, she felt something wet on her hands. She looked down and was shocked to see them covered in blood.

"Why is there blood on my hands? I'm not hurt," Isabella said, turning to Leo.

With a pale face, Leo gave her a weak smile. "Looks like a bullet got lodged in my shoulder."

Isabella finally noticed the wound on Leo's left shoulder, blood trickling out.

"You're hurt! But not in the leg. We need to stop the bleeding," Isabella said, glancing nervously at the approaching thugs.

Leo shook his head and slumped against a tree. "It's not that simple. My leg's injured too."

He pointed to his leg, his black pants already soaked in blood.

Patting Isabella's shoulder, Leo handed her a handgun. "Don't worry about me now, just run. I can hold them off for a bit."

"Think they'll give me a chance to make a run for it?" Isabella rolled her eyes, checking the gun. It had 8 bullets left.

Facing the approaching thugs, Isabella took a deep breath, released the safety, aimed, and started shooting.

Two bullets hit a tree, but one nailed a thug right in the head.

The remaining thugs quickly took cover behind trees.

With a pale face, Leo smiled. "Didn't know you were such a good shot."

Isabella's expression was serious. "I used to play with guns at the shooting club, but this is my first time shooting at real people."

"Then think of it as a shooting club. It's not much different, just no respawns," Leo said, raising his gun and taking out two more thugs.

Clearing the gun smoke, Leo laughed. "It's been a while since I worked as a bodyguard, but I guess my shooting skills are still sharp."

Seeing more thugs charging at them, Isabella raised her hand and fired, hitting one thug in the arm.

Leo squinted and tried to shoot again, but his gun was empty.

"Damn it, are we gonna die here today?" Leo gritted his teeth, feeling a wave of despair.

Suddenly, a thug hurled a round object towards them. Leo's eyes widened, adrenaline surging through his veins. Ignoring the pain, he jumped up and shielded Isabella with his body.

It was a grenade.

The grenade exploded, sending fragments everywhere.

Leo lay motionless on top of Isabella.

###chapter 310 Emergency Rescue

Isabella was totally floored by the blast from the grenade.

Even though Leo took most of the hit, she still felt like puking, probably from some internal injuries.

But then she saw Leo sprawled on top of her, blood trickling from his mouth, eyes shut, looking dead as a doornail.

"Leo, hang in there! Don't you dare die on me!" Isabella yelled.

No matter how much she screamed, Leo just wouldn't wake up.

Furious, Isabella grabbed a gun and started firing at the thugs. She managed to hit two of them, but most of her shots just hit the trees.

When she ran out of bullets, she broke down, clutching Leo and crying.

"You bastards, if I survive this, I swear I'll hunt every one of you down," she snarled, her eyes blazing with hatred.

Just as the thugs closed in, guns aimed at her, a bullet suddenly took out the guy in front. More shots followed, coming from all directions.

Cops in uniform started shooting, hitting the thugs in their hands and feet, making sure they couldn't run.

Michael came rushing in with a gun, and his face went pale when he saw Isabella and Leo on the ground.

"Get them to the ambulance, now!" Michael shouted, and two officers quickly lifted them and ran towards the ambulance.

"Michael, you finally made it. Please, save Leo. He got hurt protecting me," Isabella sobbed, collapsing into Michael's arms.

"Don't worry, he'll be okay," Michael assured her, carrying her out of the forest and signaling to the officers.

One of the officers nodded.

After Michael left, the officer said, "Mr. Williams is pissed we didn't protect Mrs. Williams. We can't screw up again. Get all the info he wants in 3 minutes!"

Soon, the screams of the thugs echoed through the woods.

Isabella stayed by Leo's side until the ambulance left the forest. Consumed with sadness and worry, she failed to notice that those suspicious officers were not driving police cars.

Outside the operating room, Isabella sat quietly, waiting. Michael was right there with her.

The doctor checked her out and found her internal organs were a bit shaken up but not too bad. Her worst injuries were just some scrapes and bruises.

Isabella cried in Michael's arms, "Leo got hurt because of me. He has a wife and kids. If he dies, I don't know how I'll face his family."

Michael hugged her tight, "He'll be fine, I promise."

"Leo's just a driver, but he protected me like a real bodyguard. His family thought being a bodyguard was too dangerous, so they made him a driver. And now I've put him in danger again," Isabella said, feeling guilty.

Michael felt a pang of guilt. He hadn't been honest with Isabella about Leo. The whole story about Leo being a driver with a family was a lie; Leo was always a bodyguard and didn't have a family.

'If something happens to Leo, I might have to hire a couple of actors to play his family,' Michael thought, feeling helpless.

Just then, the lights in the operating room went out, and the doctor walked out.

Isabella rushed over, her voice trembling, "How is he, doctor?"

The doctor looked calm. "Don't worry, the surgery went well. The grenade was low-quality and not very powerful. The worst injuries were from the two gunshots, which caused him to lose some blood. The grenade fragments only got into his muscles and didn't reach any vital organs. We've removed all the shrapnel. He just needs plenty of rest now."

"Thank goodness, thank you, doctor," Isabella said, feeling a wave of relief wash over her.

Michael hugged her and smiled. "See, I told you he'd be okay. Now we just need to take care of Leo and figure out how to get back at those who did this."

Michael quickly changed the subject, worried Isabella might try to contact Leo's non-existent family.

Sure enough, Michael successfully diverted her attention, and a look of determination flashed in her eyes.

"You're right, I need to find out who tried to kill me! I won't let them get away with this," Isabella said, clenching her fists.

Michael nodded. "The police must have caught some of the thugs. Maybe they can tell us who's behind all this."

Just then, Michael's phone rang. It was Jerry.

Michael's eyes narrowed. If he was right, Jerry's call was probably about the thugs.

"Mr. Williams, I just got back from the police station. They found out the person targeting Isabella is from her company. They arrested him. It's kind of funny, he was about to jump off a building but chickened out, and the firefighters nabbed him," Jerry said.

Michael squinted. "How could a coward like him hire hitmen to kill someone?"

Isabella nodded. "Exactly, Jerry, did you find out anything else?"

Jerry was startled. He had guessed Isabella was probably with Michael, so he tried to avoid mentioning Michael's identity. It seemed he was right.

Jerry continued, "Mrs. Williams, we did find something else. This guy is just a regular employee at your company, with no money to hire hitmen. But last night, a large sum of money was deposited into his account. We traced it back to someone named Duncan."

Anger flashed in Isabella's eyes. "I know him. That jerk caused the death of a female employee. The first thing I'll do as CEO is take him down!"

###chapter 311 Arrest the Culprits

Meanwhile, Duncan was at home, pacing around the kitchen with his phone, waiting for any news.

"This has to work, right? The big payout should lure some desperate folks to take out Isabella. She can't survive this," Duncan muttered, clenching his teeth.

Last night, after the group who wanted to take out Isabella met up, they put their money together to hire a team of hitmen, just as Duncan suggested.

Duncan thought he was being smart, using a scapegoat he had dirt on to contact the hitman. He figured the guy wouldn't refuse, even if it meant suicide. But he didn't know that guy was a total coward.

Suddenly, Duncan's phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID and immediately answered. 

"How's it going?" he asked eagerly.

"Don't worry, sir. We've confirmed Isabella's dead," came the voice on the other end-Duncan's scapegoat.

"Great job!" Duncan exclaimed, hanging up the phone. He was so excited that he rushed to the liquor cabinet and opened a bottle of his prized red wine to celebrate.

Meanwhile, the man who had just hung up carefully approached the police officer. "I did what you asked. Will I get a reduced sentence?" 

The officer nodded curtly before leaving the interrogation room. Their goal in making that call was to keep Duncan calm and prevent him from fleeing.

Twenty minutes later, the door to Duncan's apartment was kicked open, startling him as he sipped his wine. When he got to the doorway, he was met with an arrest warrant.

"Duncan, you're suspected of hiring a hitman to commit murder. You're coming with us," an officer said, practically shoving the warrant in Duncan's face.

"No way, you must be mistaken. I couldn't have done that," Duncan protested, but the officers slapped handcuffs on him.

All the way to the station, Duncan kept shouting. But no one paid him any mind.

It wasn't until he was locked in an interrogation room that he started to face reality.

Officer Brenda Pena, who had met Isabella several times before, was part of the interrogation team this time.

Brenda came out of the interrogation room with a list in hand.

She walked into Chief Alan Savage's office and handed him the list.

"Chief Savage, these are the names Duncan gave us. Should we start making arrests?" Brenda asked.

Alan nodded. "This incident is serious. They fired guns and used bombs in crowded areas. We need to arrest them."

Brenda muttered under her breath, "If the four major families could just chill for a bit, the crime rate in this city would definitely drop."

Alan coughed, giving Brenda a warning look. "Alright, mind your words. Our station is funded by the four major families. Even your uniform is thanks to these 'philanthropists.'"

When Alan mentioned the philanthropists, his tone sharpened, showing his frustration with the recent actions of the four major families.

Brenda rolled her eyes and asked, "Chief Savage, did you lend police uniforms to others?"

Alan nodded. "Those uniforms are old, so I lent them to some models for their fashion show."

Leaning on the table, Brenda glared at Alan and said, "So you're telling me the people who brought in those armed criminals today are all models? Those criminals should be in the hospital first, not prison!"

Alan shrugged, "Some things are better kept to yourself. They did save us some hassle. If we interrogated them by the rules, these desperados might not have confessed this quickly. But our victims need to know the truth ASAP."

Brenda took a deep breath and whispered, "Which family is it this time?"

Alan raised an eyebrow and looked at Brenda. "It's tied to Isabella. Who do you think it could be?"

After that, Alan waved his hand and started organizing the files on his desk. "You can go now. Remember, I know you have issues with the four major families, but even the weakest one, the Brown Family, isn't someone we can mess with. If you really want out of this mess, go find Jasper. At least that job seems easier."

Annoyed, Brenda said, "Where do I even find him? That jerk might have already skipped the country. Are you gonna pay for me to investigate abroad?"

Alan sighed and put down the files. "If you're willing to take a break abroad, I can help you out. Your aunt wants to see you. When are you planning to visit?"

Brenda seemed to lose all her energy. She didn't say anything and just left the office.

With the list in hand, Brenda joined the team heading to Isabella's company for the arrests.

The company execs were caught off guard by the sudden police raid. They turned pale as they were handcuffed and dragged out of the building.

Carol raised an eyebrow at the scene. "Is Isabella moving this fast? I gave her the info yesterday, and today she's already making arrests?"

Carol's confusion was shared by many employees. Someone had posted about the arrests online, and soon reporters swarmed in for interviews.

At the same time, news broke that Isabella had been attacked on her way home. "The new CEO of the Taylor Group, Isabella was attacked by her father's subordinates. Isabella escaped, but the driver was seriously injured and unconscious."

When Carol saw this, she suddenly understood why Isabella acted so quickly.

"These impulsive idiots, the investigation on Isabella just started, and they couldn't wait to hand over the evidence," Carol muttered about Duncan and his crew.

By the time everyone targeting Isabella was arrested, she was back at the company, handling business. She needed to reassure those innocent employees and keep them from feeling unsafe.

While Isabella was busy stabilizing the company, Michael was on the phone with Jerry, setting up a new task.

"My wife almost died in that forest this time. You know what to do, right?" Michael said coldly.

Jerry promised over the phone, "Don't worry, Mr. Williams. Once they're in prison, I'll make sure they regret it!"

Satisfied, Michael hung up and waited for the police interrogation.

###chapter 312 Suspecting Bianca

Michael couldn't wrap his head around the idea that Duncan would try to take out Isabella just because of something she said at a press conference.

There had to be more to it.

Isabella was on the same page. When she got back from work, she shared her thoughts with Michael.

"This has Bianca written all over it. No one else wants me dead more than she does," Isabella said, her voice icy.

Michael gently dabbed medicine on Isabella's wound. He looked at her and asked, "So, what's the plan? We might not have proof, but we can still give her a hard time."

"She's like a cockroach. One day, I'll squash her," Isabella fumed. With John protecting Bianca, she couldn't go after her directly.

Just then, Michael's phone rang. He glanced at the screen and ignored the call.

"Who's that?" Isabella asked, curious.

Michael showed her the caller ID. It was Jerry.

"Jerry probably wants to talk about a case, but you need me more right now," Michael said with a smile.

Isabella frowned at him. "The case is more important. I'm not as fragile as you think."

She took Michael's phone and called Jerry back. Michael just smiled and let her.

"Jerry, what's up? Any new leads on the case? Is someone pulling Duncan's strings?" Isabella asked.

Jerry hesitated before saying, "Yeah, we've got something. The cops found out Duncan got a call telling him to kill you to avoid being targeted. The caller said Bianca would protect him. The number's been deactivated, so we can't trace it. Also, Mason's been digging into this."

Michael's eyes narrowed. Jerry's last comment was a hint that Mason needed to talk to him. Michael's phone had a special program that hid calls from Mason, leaving no trace.

Jerry's message was clear: Mason couldn't reach Michael and had to go through Jerry.

"Sweetheart, you stay put. I'm heading to the police station," Michael said, pocketing his phone.

"Aren't you supposed to be comforting me? How can you leave now?" Isabella pouted.

Michael playfully pinched her nose. "But you just said the case is more important. Jerry's good, but he can miss things. I need to dig into this, see if Bianca's behind it, and figure out our next move."

After thinking it over, Isabella nodded. The security here was solid, so she wasn't too worried about being targeted. She just reminded Michael to be careful and keep a low profile.

Michael kissed Isabella on the forehead before heading out of the villa.

Instead of going straight to the police station, he took a detour and ended up at the Williams Villa.

Mason had just gotten back from the hospital and needed some rest. The Williams Villa was the perfect place for him to recover.

In the living room, Mason sat on the sofa, looking stern and leaning on a cane. John was on the other side of the room when Michael walked in.

"Mason, what's up? You wanted to talk?" Michael asked, taking a seat.

Mason's face was grim. "I heard Isabella was attacked and almost killed. You know about this?"

Michael nodded. "Yeah, I'm on it. The cops have already nabbed the guy."

Mason nodded, tapping his cane in frustration. "Isabella's family is a mess. She's the only decent one among them."

John frowned. Mason's harsh words stung, especially since they included Bianca, the woman he cared about.

Noticing John's reaction, Michael asked, "John, has Bianca been in touch with anyone lately?"

Mason paused and turned to John, frowning.

John glared at Michael. "What are you getting at?"

Michael stayed calm. "Duncan confessed that someone pushed him to go after Isabella and said Bianca would protect him. The contact was careful, using a single number that's now deactivated-a burner phone."

John's face darkened. "You think Bianca's behind this?"

Michael met John's gaze without flinching. "We have to consider who benefits the most. If Isabella's out of the picture, Bianca stands to gain the family shares without competition."

"Enough. You've got the wrong idea about Bianca. She might have been misled, but that doesn't make her evil," John snapped, standing up to defend her.

Mason looked at John, clearly angry and disappointed.

John turned to Mason. "Grandpa, you need to see the bigger picture. Someone might be trying to frame Bianca by taking out Isabella, stirring up trouble between us. Instead of pointing fingers at Bianca, why not check what the other three major families are up to?"

"You think the other families are trying to divide us with this scheme?" Michael asked.

"Isn't that a possibility?" John shot back coldly.

###chapter 313 Warning John

John had a hunch that the three big families were stirring the pot to ramp up the tension between him and Mason. But Michael wasn't buying it.

"The three families have always thought the Taylor Family's got some secret recipe to revive the family business. No way they'd let Bianca get her hands on it to boost the Williams Family. And Isabella? She's the last person that would team with us. They should be protecting her, not going after her," Michael said, cool as a cucumber.

John scoffed, "Our family's been helping Isabella for ages. Why wouldn't she work with us?"

"Get real, it was your grandpa who helped her, not you. Remember what you did to her? It's not like you can forget," Michael shot back, giving John a cold stare.

John squirmed under Michael's gaze.

Mason frowned. "What are you two on about? Is there something I don't know?"

Mason glared at both of them, clearly annoyed.

Michael caught the pleading look in John's eyes and smirked, "I'm talking about John blowing off Isabella for eight years and ditching their engagement to be with her sister. Women don't take betrayal lightly. Isabella must find John repulsive, that's all."

John was pissed but kept his mouth shut. He didn't dare tell Mason about the time he almost took Isabella's kidney.

Mason might blow a gasket and end up back in the hospital.

"Got it, that makes sense." Mason glared at John and tapped his cane.

"Alright, Michael, you handle the Isabella situation. Make sure no one messing with her gets away with it," Mason ordered.

Michael nodded.

After leaving the Williams Villa, John headed back to his vineyard.

Bianca had a meal ready and was hanging up his clothes.

"What's up? You look stressed," Bianca asked softly.

John hesitated, then sat down at the table, looking at Bianca's sweet face.

"Did you see the news? Isabella was almost killed. She got attacked, and her driver was seriously hurt and taken to the hospital," John said casually.

Bianca feigned shock. "Isabella got hurt? Is she okay? Should we go see her at the hospital?"

John studied Bianca's face but saw nothing out of the ordinary.

He had no idea Bianca was a pretty good actress. Plus, he was too smitten with her to think straight.

John was convinced Bianca had nothing to do with it, so he relaxed and said, "The cops caught the attackers, and they led to a bunch of arrests at the Taylor Group. Someone said they were put up to it. My grandpa and Michael think it might be you."

'Idiots!' Bianca cursed silently in her heart.

On the surface, Bianca's face went pale. "Mason and Michael suspect me? Why? Oh, if Isabella dies, I'd be the biggest beneficiary. I guess I do have a strong motive."

She started to cry, walked over to John, and held his hand. "It's not me, you have to believe me. I couldn't do something so stupid. If anything happens, everyone will suspect me. Maybe someone's trying to frame me or target your family?"

Bianca quickly shifted the focus to the internal conflicts of the Williams Family.

"I don't know, but I already told my grandfather you wouldn't do something like this," John said, gently hugging her.

"Don't worry, as long as I'm here, no one can harm you," he said earnestly.

Bianca hugged him tightly, but there was a hint of resentment in her eyes.

'Damn Isabella, you escaped again. It's getting harder to kill you,' she thought.

The next morning, after a night's rest, Isabella showed up at the company. Reporters were already swarming downstairs.

Isabella looked at them without any nervousness or surprise. She knew these vultures would definitely come for her after what happened yesterday.

Soon, they surrounded her, firing off questions about the previous day's events.

"Isabella, it's said this incident happened because you were going to fire a group of employees. What do you say about this?"

"Isabella, after such an incident, will you still continue with the original standards?"

"Isabella, do you suspect this incident is related to Bianca?"

Isabella looked at the reporters and said calmly, "Justice will never bow to evil. Those fools tried to assassinate me because they fear the truth. I'll dig deeper and kick out the rotten apples in the company. Their moves just fuel my fire. As for whether it's related to Bianca, I can only say trust the police and let them investigate."

After speaking, Isabella went back into the company.

On her way to the office, many employees greeted her, feeling lighter after she cleared out the bad apples.

Isabella smiled and responded to them. When she arrived at her office, Carol was already waiting for her.

"You told me before that you were on the brink of death many times. I didn't quite believe it, but now I do. There are indeed many people who want to kill you," Carol said emotionally.

Isabella smiled, "Such things might happen in the future. If there's nothing urgent, try not to get too close to me, or misfortune might come your way."

Carol nodded. "You're right, I don't want to die so soon. Here are the documents you wanted."

She placed the prepared documents in front of Isabella.

Isabella opened the folder and looked through it for a while, nodding in satisfaction. "I've investigated this before, and your lists match mine. Looks like you're up for the task, no problem."

###chapter 314 Jasper's Whereabouts

Isabella's always quick to dish out compliments to Carol.

As the CEO, Isabella'd have to clean house, getting rid of the dead weight and making room for fresh talent. She was all about promoting the right people and, if needed, bringing in new blood.

She'd already gone over the list of staff Carol put together and thought it was spot on. These talents could really help turn things around for the company.

"With all this praise, I might just get a promotion tomorrow," Carol joked, grinning.

Isabella nodded earnestly. "If you want, once this task is done, you can get a promotion, and I'll even throw in some company shares."

Carol was stunned, "You're giving me your shares? Nah, wait until you catch your dad and get all his shares, then you can give me some. Better not mess with what you have now, or I might just sell them to Bianca."

Isabella chuckled, knowing Carol was kidding, but she didn't mind. "I trust you wouldn't do that."

"Even though I appreciate you, your charm hasn't reached that level yet," Carol said bluntly.

"Alright, let's drop the shares talk for now. By the way, heard anything about your dad lately?" Carol asked.

Isabella shook her head. "I hired a private detective, but the cops are still on his trail. It's like he vanished. I'm starting to wonder if he's even still in the country or if he's dead."

"That sounds more like a curse than a blessing." Carol shrugged with a smile.

Isabella waved her hand dismissively, "Just thinking about him annoys me. Let's not talk about him. Let's focus on this task. What's your plan?"

Carol pointed to the thick stack of files and grinned, "I'm thinking of giving a decent position and a good salary to the most mediocre person to attract more talent."

Isabella looked intrigued, crossing her arms. "Is it psychology? Make people think if someone like him can get a great position, then why can't I? With that mindset, we can attract more talent?"

Carol nodded. "Exactly, what do you think?"

Isabella clapped her hands. "Great, I believe in you! Can't wait to see you get that promotion and raise."

Meanwhile, Jasper had just gotten off the ship.

Someone handed him a paper bag. "Here's your new ID and some cash. It's enough for a plane ticket. The rest is up to you. Good luck!"

The person glanced at the plastic bottle and bag in Jasper's hand with a look of disgust and left quickly.

Jasper didn't give a damn about the other guy's rude attitude. He'd been holed up in a container for the past two days, peeing in a bottle, puking in a plastic bag, and dealing with his own crap.

He looked like a total mess, like some homeless dude off the street.

Jasper chucked those gross bottles and bags into a trash can, then headed into a convenience store to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee.

"Finally free. I can live in peace now," Jasper muttered, almost tearing up.

Little did he know, someone had their eyes on him.

Back in Avalonia, a young guy stormed into the police station, slamming Jasper's wanted poster on the desk. "Officer, you need to take this seriously. This guy stole my phone and wallet!"

The cop's face changed when he saw the poster. He immediately reported it.

Soon enough, all four major families got wind of this.

Mason's expression darkened as he listened to Charles's report.

"Did that guy really say that? He reported it ages ago, but the cops didn't take it seriously?" Mason asked, frowning.

Charles nodded with a bitter smile. "Yeah, because that area has a lot of robberies, the local cops didn't pay much attention. The kid didn't expect to get his phone and wallet back. But he stumbled upon Jasper's wanted poster and reported it again. The reward for info on Jasper is worth more than what he lost."

Mason waved his hand, exasperated. "Alright, cut to the chase. Where's Jasper now?"

Charles got serious. "The man said Jasper was calling someone to help him leave the country from a dock. The cops checked his phone records and confirmed the person Jasper called was involved in shady stuff."

"So Jasper's already out of the country?" Mason's brow furrowed even more. If he was, finding him would be a nightmare.

Other the other side, John was fuming.

"Damn it, that bastard played me!" John yelled, smashing the cup in his hand.

John had also gotten the info from the police. When he found out Jasper had contacted someone shady to leave the country, he immediately thought of the contact info he had given Jasper.

The phone records the cops checked confirmed it.

John remembered calling the guy named Joe, who swore he wouldn't help Jasper leave. But the facts showed Joe had lied.

John couldn't reach Joe by phone, so he ordered his guys to bring Joe in.

###chapter 315 Joe on the Run

Not only did John get the scoop, but the other three big families also sent their guys to track down Joe.

But by the time they hit the dock, Joe had already scattered his crew.

When John's guys showed up at Joe's place, the room was empty except for a piece of paper pinned to the wall.

The note read:

"Sorry, Mr. Williams. I did say I wouldn't help Jasper skip town without cash. But he had a few gold teeth. I had no choice but to take his offer and get him out. So don't hold it against me! Always respectful, Joe."

John's men rolled their eyes at the note and brought it back.

John ripped it to shreds after reading it.

Meanwhile, Joe was chilling in Mike's office, munching on ice cream.

Joe grinned. "John must be losing it right now, huh? Think he'll just tear up the note?"

Mike leaned back in his chair, smirking, "I bet what he really wants to tear up is you."

Joe shrugged. "Nah, I'm worth way more than that note. Besides, I didn't lie. No money, no help for Jasper. It's all about the gold!"

Mike waved his hand dismissively. "Alright, enough about those gold teeth. Every time I see your bling, I think of Jasper's nasty mouth, and it grosses me out."

Joe flashed his gold ring and necklace. "You don't get it. Gold's got a charm. Those pretty ladies might find your face gross, but when they see the gold around your neck, they'll be all smiles and fall right into your arms."

Mike rolled his eyes. "Mr. Williams said you should lay low for a while, so no chasing after those curvy beauties."

"No way, I just set up a date with a hottie," Joe grumbled.

But just then, Mike's phone rang.

Mike glanced at the caller ID, his expression turning serious.

"Shut up, it's John," Mike hissed at Joe.

Joe, still chuckling, clamped his hand over his mouth.

Once Joe quieted down, Mike answered the call.

"Mr. Williams, what can I do for you?" Mike asked, his voice dropping to a serious tone.

On the other end of the line, John asked icily, "Has my uncle been up to anything lately? Did he send anyone to the dock?"

Mike feigned surprise and shook his head. "Nope, our guys haven't been near the dock recently. Why do you ask?"

John sneered, "Are you kidding me? The only people at the Moonlit Lounge that night, besides me, were your guys. You know Jasper had the contact info for some human smuggler, right?"

Mike's tone turned frosty. "Mr. Williams, it was you who gave Jasper that contact info. Isn't it funny you're asking me now?"

John replied coldly, "The person I originally set up is dead, and Joe took his place. Are you seriously saying Joe has no ties to you guys?"

"Never heard of him before, Mr. Williams. Think about it. Isabella took Jasper to the hospital. She's the one most likely to have the contact info. Why don't you ask her?" Mike retorted.

John went silent. He couldn't believe Isabella would do something like that. In his mind, she wasn't that clever or sneaky.

John did suspect Michael. But if it was really Michael, wouldn't that mean he helped Jasper escape from the hospital?

However, everyone had analyzed Jasper's escape, and it was full of holes. If it weren't for the fact that all the guards had let their guard down, he wouldn't have been able to escape at all. If it was Michael, he wouldn't have made such a rookie mistake.

"Looks like you've figured something out, Mr. Williams. I won't keep you. Think it over. Anyway, if it wasn't me, why should I admit it?" Mike said, ready to hang up.

Mike was being blackmailed by John with a contract, so he didn't need to be polite.

But just then, John coldly snorted into the phone. "You better not be involved. When I catch that Joe, I'll tie him up and feed him to the crocodiles."

Joe, covering his mouth, widened his eyes in horror at John's words.

Mike smiled slightly. "Telling me won't help. You need to find Joe and talk to him."

Mike hung up the phone after saying that.

Joe finally let his hands drop. He had been too nervous to breathe. Now, breathing heavily, his face turned pale with fear.

"I was just messing with him. John actually wants to feed me to the crocodiles. That's too harsh," Joe said unhappily.

Mike smirked and said, "Don't you want to find a hottie? Go ahead! Have a great night."

Mike tried to push Joe out, but Joe refused to leave.

Joe clung to Mike's leg, crying, "No, I don't want to get killed. Those hotties might be planning to off me and collect a reward from John. It's safer to stay with you."

###chapter 316 Tracking Jasper

Joe wasn't up for running around town, hooking up with girls anymore.

From the phone call, it was clear John was hunting him down, probably wanting to kill him.

Scared out of his mind, Joe stuck with Mike and refused to leave. Michael had already tipped Mike off that the big four families were likely after Joe. He told Mike to keep an eye on Joe and not let him wander off.

After Mike left, he called Michael.

"Mr. Williams, it's all sorted. Joe's promised not to run off again. I didn't even have to tell him about the four families. Just one call from John, and he was clinging to my legs, begging for protection," Mike laughed, remembering Joe's fear.

Michael chuckled, "Keep him safe for now. Once things calm down, send him abroad."

"Got it, Mr. Williams." Mike's face turned serious as he remembered something.

"Mr. Williams, remember that media company that spread rumors about Isabella and Mason?" Mike asked.

Michael nodded. "Yeah, I remember. Didn't you say those guys fled abroad? Something new come up?"

"Yeah, one of them came back under a fake name. An acquaintance recognized him and tried to shake us down for money. We've lost track of him, but we're on it," Mike informed Michael.

Michael squinted, tapping the table lightly. Those rumors were probably Bianca's doing. But she couldn't have done it alone; there had to be someone backing her. Maybe this time they could catch those guys.

"Keep tabs on them. Once you find them, dig into who's behind them." Michael hung up, confident Mike could handle it.

Meanwhile, after John finished his call with Mike, he didn't get any useful info. He couldn't be sure if Joe was set up by Michael.

"Could it really be like Joe said, that Jasper bribed him with gold teeth?" John frowned, thinking it over. Of course, he had someone looking into Joe's whereabouts.

Not just John, but the other three big families were also on Joe's trail, along with Mason's crew.

"Any luck finding Joe?" Mason asked Charles.

Charles shook his head. "We only found some clues about how he joined the gang."

Mason, leaning on his cane, said seriously, "Spill it, I want to know how this guy showed up."

Charles nodded. "Joe joined a gang involved in illegal emigration two weeks ago. Through flattery and making good connections, he quickly gained respect in the gang. Because of his maturity, he became the gang leader's confidant. Then, a conflict broke out between this gang and another controlling the docks. During the struggle, the gang leader was killed. So Joe took over the gang and the illegal emigration business."

Mason lightly rubbed his cane, then suddenly smiled. "Joe's no simple guy, playing all four major families like that. Who do you think Joe's working for?"

Charles, with his head down, thought for a moment and said, "The info about that human smuggler came from Mr. John Williams. The only ones who saw Jasper that night were Mr. John Williams, Mr. Michael Williams, and Isabella. Isabella's the most likely, since she took Jasper to the hospital and had access to that info."

Mason shook his head slightly. "You're missing someone."

Charles suddenly remembered and exclaimed, "Are you talking about Isabella's husband?"

Mason nodded. "Isabella's husband has always been a mystery. She claims he's just an ordinary guy, but how could an ordinary person escape the scrutiny of the four major families?"

Charles nodded in agreement. "You're right. We've also suspected that Isabella's husband might be connected to a major force abroad. If that's the case, pulling off something like this is possible."

Mason stood up, leaning on his cane, and started pacing. "If this is Isabella's husband's doing, we don't need to worry. He'll have people keeping an eye on Jasper until they find the hidden funds."

Charles nodded. "Should we look into Isabella's husband's identity?"

Mason shook his head. "Forget it. We've found nothing so far, and we might not find anything this time either. Let's see how this plays out."

Mason suddenly remembered something. "By the way, what are the other three families up to?" he asked Charles.

"Paxton and the other two families have had several meetings recently. They even suspect that Jasper has hidden the family's secrets and embezzled funds together. So they're also looking for Joe. However, they seem to have shifted their focus and are now looking for clues on that departing cargo ship," Charles reported.

Mason smiled. "They're not fools. Joe's just a human trafficker. Their real target is Jasper."

Charles sighed. "But Mr. John Williams still sent most of the manpower to find Joe."

Mason sneered. "John's just too arrogant. Apart from me, his uncle, and his father, he looks down on everyone else. He got played by Jasper and Joe, so he can't handle his anger now. I'm getting more and more disappointed in him."

Mason sighed and walked to the potted plant in the living room, taking a small pair of scissors to trim the withered branches.

"The flowers in the greenhouse need a good trim before being transplanted to the wild. It's the only way they'll thrive in the harsh wind and rain." Mason abruptly cut off the thickest branch.

###chapter 317 Investigation of the Three Major Families

Charles watched as Mason snipped off a perfectly healthy branch, his brow furrowing before he quickly caught on.

"Mr. Mason Williams, are you saying that if Mr. John Williams doesn't kick these bad habits, even if he thrives, he'll end up choked out like this branch?" Charles asked.

But Mason just shook his head. "I'm getting old, my eyesight's not what it used to be. I meant to cut the dead branch next to it but messed up."

Mason sighed, tossed the scissors aside, and headed back inside, looking pretty down.

Charles sighed too, watching Mason walk away.

All three major families were just waiting for Mason to kick the bucket, and his time was running out.

Meanwhile, Jasper, who had already fled the country, used some cash to change into new clothes and then hopped on another plane.

Sitting on the plane, Jasper watched the scenery shrink below, feeling a rush of excitement.

'Finally, I'm outta here! Now I can live it up as a rich guy,' Jasper thought.

What Jasper didn't know was that, not far from his seat, a young guy with a lazy look was hiding behind a newspaper, pretending to sleep.

But if you looked closely, you'd see the young guy sneaking peeks at Jasper from behind the paper.

'Jasper looks pretty pleased with himself, huh? Thinks he's in the clear? What an idiot, he has no clue what's inside him,' the young guy thought.

This was Tim, who had been tailing Jasper all along.

After silently mocking Jasper, Tim hid behind the newspaper again. Up in the air, he didn't have to worry about Jasper making a run for it. He needed to rest and get used to the time difference.

'Gotta rest up if I'm gonna keep tracking him. I really hope Jasper's hiding spot for the public funds is interesting. If he's just got it all piled up in one room, I'm gonna be so disappointed,' Tim thought.

On the other side, after a thorough investigation, the three major families finally tracked down the cargo ship. It had set sail for Lumaria.

Only the Davis Family could intercept the ship, so Richard sent his people.

After hours of turbulence, the helicopter finally landed on the cargo ship. The people sent by the three major families quickly took control of everyone on board and searched the entire ship.

But they found nothing, just some of Jasper's hair and poop in a red container.

"Tell me, where did the guy in that container go? Wasn't he supposed to head to Lumaria?" a tough-looking guy demanded, glaring at the captain.

The captain gulped, at first thinking they were pirates, but then realizing they were from the four major families he couldn't mess with.

"That guy didn't go to Lumaria. Joe told me he only had enough fare for the first stop, so he got off the ship right after we left the country. I don't know where he went after that. I'm just a boatman," the captain said with a nervous smile.

"Damn it, we've been tricked again!" The tough guy shoved the captain aside and stormed back to the helicopter.

The three major families came up empty-handed, only finding out that Jasper had jumped ship halfway. They headed back to report the bad news.

The captain watched the helicopter take off and let out a sigh of relief. His shipping company wasn't tied to the four major families, but his boss couldn't afford to cross them. Plus, with all three families working together, it was best to just go along with it.

"Mr. Williams, you should've seen the looks on their faces when they found out. It was priceless," Joe called Michael, laughing heartily over the phone.

Even though Joe had bailed from the dock and disbanded his gang, he still had a few guys left on the cargo ship.

After the three families' people left, one of Joe's guys called him and spilled everything.

Michael chuckled. He knew Joe would have to lay low in the safe house for a while, which would be boring, so he didn't mind Joe acting a little crazy.

"Next, the three families will keep digging around that port. But that country's pretty close to us. The three families still have some pull there, so it won't be too hard to find out the truth. I just hope Jasper isn't dumb enough to stash the public funds somewhere easy to find. He better hide it far away, somewhere even the four families can't reach," Michael said with a faint smile.

After Michael and Joe wrapped up their call, another call came in.

Michael glanced at the phone, saw it was Mike, and picked up.

"What's up, Mike? Did you find out who that man from the media company is?" Michael asked.

Mike nodded. "Yeah, Mr. Williams, we figured out who he is and found something interesting."

"What's so interesting? Spill it," Michael said, intrigued.

Mike continued, "Remember when Mrs. Williams was holding her first press conference, and a masked journalist barged in at the end, asking her questions? Then Mrs. Williams got attacked."

Michael's expression turned serious. "Are you saying those two are the same person?"

"Yep, Mr. Williams, they're the same guy. And we know where he's staying. We're about to nab him," Mike said, eyeing a nearby hotel.

After a lot of digging, they finally confirmed he was staying at this hotel. Now, they just needed to get in, find him, and make him talk about who he was working for.

After making sure Mike and the team were safe, Michael hung up.

Meanwhile, the journalist, who was about to get busted, was chilling in his room, playing with his phone.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The journalist got up, looked through the peephole, and saw an old janitor outside.

"I don't need any cleaning," the journalist said, opening the door with a frown.

But then a gun was pointed at his head, followed by a gunshot.

###chapter 318 The Dead Journalist

When Mike and his crew got to the hotel, they walked in like regular guests and were hit by the loud hum of a vacuum cleaner as soon as they stepped out of the elevator.

"This place is crazy noisy," Mike grumbled, eyeing the bent-over janitor.

They didn't give the janitor much thought.

When they got to the journalist's room, they used a key to get in.

Right away, a weird smell, kinda like blood, hit them.

Mike's face changed, and he dashed into the room.

On the bed was someone wrapped in blood-soaked sheets.

Mike went over and pulled back the sheets. The journalist had a bullet hole in his forehead, eyes shut like he was sleeping.

Furious, Mike slammed his fist on the bed, then stormed to the next room and banged on the door.

After a few seconds of knocking, a young guy with messy hair and dark circles finally opened up, looking like he hadn't slept all night.

"What's the deal? Waking me up like this, who are you guys?" the young guy snapped at Mike.

Mike grabbed him by the collar, yanked him out of the room, shoved him against the wall, and growled, "Next, I'll ask and you'll answer. Say one more stupid thing, and I'll cut off one of your fingers!"

Scared stiff, the young guy just nodded.

"Someone next door got killed. Did you hear any gunshots?" Mike asked.

The young guy's eyes went wide, and he yelled, "Someone got shot next door? It wasn't me! I don't even have a gun!"

"I'm not saying it was you. Did you hear any gunshots?" Mike barked, smacking the guy's head.

The young guy shook his head. "No, I didn't hear any gunshots. All I heard was that damn vacuum cleaner; it was so loud I even cursed at it."

"The vacuum cleaner?" Mike muttered, piecing it together.

"Damn, the vacuum cleaner covered the gunshot!" Mike's face darkened. He led his team to find the janitor.

But by the time they got downstairs, the janitor was gone.

Mike got in touch with the hotel manager and found the vacuum cleaner. Inside, they discovered a bullet casing.

Mike quickly reported back to Michael.

Michael didn't blame Mike and his team. He knew how ruthless the other side could be.

Whether it was Odette getting poisoned in the hospital or the shootout with John in the abandoned factory, it just proved how savage they could get.

Mike and his team finding the journalist shot as soon as they arrived meant he was being watched. When the other side sensed trouble, they sent someone to take him out.

"I'm getting more curious about the folks backing Bianca. Who's got the guts to pull off such ruthless moves here?" Michael mused, his eyes cold and calculating.

Meanwhile, after a long day at work, Isabella was about to head out when the cops showed up again.

Seeing the familiar face of Officer Brenda, Isabella sighed, "Officer Pena, how many times have we met this month?"

Brenda shrugged. "Honestly, I don't want to be here either. Frequent police visits aren't exactly a good look."

Brenda plopped down on the sofa like she owned the place. She'd been here so often, it was almost routine.

Isabella sighed and told Juliet, "Go get Officer Pena a cup of coffee."

Juliet nodded but Brenda waved her off.

"Let's skip it. I just need to ask a few questions and then head back to the station." Brenda rubbed her forehead, looking exhausted. She'd been swamped with cases, one after another.

Isabella waved Juliet away and sat across from Brenda. "What's up this time?"

Brenda wiped her face and said, "A journalist who interviewed you got killed. Our investigation shows he was spreading false stuff about you and Mason online."

Isabella's brows knitted together. Half-joking, she said, "So now you're saying I have a motive to kill?"

Brenda sighed, "Guess who found the body first?"

Isabella raised an eyebrow, "I have no idea. Just tell me, I hate guessing games."

Rolling her eyes, Brenda said, "It was someone from the Williams Family. Naturally, they called the cops."

Isabella looked at Brenda. "Now I'm curious. You're talking about Mason's guys, not John's, right?"

Brenda nodded. "See my problem? Mason's got a motive too. When will these big families chill out? The complaints at the station are endless."

Isabella ignored Brenda's griping. She thought for a moment and said, "Mason's guys wouldn't be that sloppy. If they wanted someone gone, they'd make them disappear quietly, not in a busy hotel."

"Yeah, only people from big families know their own tricks," Brenda teased, a hint of sarcasm in her voice.

Isabella threw up her hands. "You don't always have to zero in on me and Mason. Sure, we have motives, but think about why this guy was spreading those nasty rumors and who put him up to it. I doubt a journalist would take on big families solo. Someone had to be behind him, and now they want him to shut up."

Brenda nodded, showing she was on the same page.

###chapter 319 Good News

Brenda didn't hang around Isabella's office for long. She just popped in for a routine check and didn't expect to get much out of it.

After work, Isabella headed home with her new driver and bodyguards in tow.

Michael had already wrapped up his day and was cooking when Isabella walked in. She wasted no time telling him about Brenda's visit.

Isabella grabbed a tomato from the fruit bowl, popped it into her mouth, and leaned against the kitchen counter, thinking out loud, "The only person I can think of is Bianca. But there's no way John framed Mason, so it must be those shady people behind Bianca."

Michael calmly set a freshly cooked dish on the dining table. "Let's eat first. No point in stressing over it now."

Isabella plopped down at the table, clearly frustrated. "I'm so sick of these people lurking in the shadows! Sometimes I just want to hire a hitman to take out Bianca so she stops messing with me."

Michael watched as Isabella angrily hacked at her steak. He chuckled and shared some good news.

"Bianca's not gonna be happy for long. Private investigators dug up some dirt on her from the local police in Lumaria. Turns out, Bianca never went to any hospital; she was just on vacation. She stayed there for over a week and then came straight back, which is super fishy. No way medical science allows for such a quick recovery," Michael said, a bit sarcastically.

Isabella put down her utensils, looking pleasantly surprised. "Really? That's awesome. Once we find the company's funds, I can go after Bianca fast! Next, we just need Benjamin to check out those doctors. I can't wait to throw the evidence in John's face and see if he can still play dumb."

Michael smiled, then suddenly thought of something.

Looking at Isabella curiously, Michael asked, "I gotta know, why is John so into Bianca? What kind of love makes him go against his grandfather? Did Bianca do something that made John willing to risk everything for her?"

Isabella shook her head. "I want to know that too. Why would John rather be a fool than face the truth?"

Michael pursed his lips, lowered his head, and started eating. He made a mental note to have someone look into it.

Meanwhile, after a series of investigations, the three major families finally tracked down Jasper.

"Our people infiltrated the airline company. After combing through the surveillance videos, we finally found Jasper. He boarded a flight to Novaria," Jonah said, handing the report to Paxton.

Paxton looked at the printed photo of Jasper on the report, a slight smile forming on his face.

"Finally, we found Jasper. He really made us work for it," Paxton said, tossing the document onto the table.

"Share this news with the other two families. We'll send people to track Jasper together," Paxton instructed Jonah.

Jonah hesitated for a moment and suggested, "Mr. Brown, since we already know where Jasper is, why not handle it ourselves? That way, whatever Jasper finds will be ours alone."

Paxton shot Jonah a cold look. "Are you questioning my decisions?"

Jonah quickly lowered his head. "No, sir. I'm sure you have your reasons."

Paxton snorted. "Do you think we're the only ones who can find this clue? The other two families are just as capable. Sharing it shows we're serious about cooperation. Plus, we have no influence in that country; we need their help."

Jonah nodded. "Understood, Mr. Brown. I'll deliver the documents now."

As Jonah was about to leave, Paxton stopped him.

"Also, share the information we found with the Williams Family's informants," Paxton said, a sly smile on his lips.

Jonah was momentarily surprised but quickly caught on.

Paxton's plan was devious; he wanted to stir up trouble between the Williams Family and the other two families to weaken them.

A small, ambitious family would have to find ways to weaken their rivals before they grew big. That way, everyone could stay on the same level.

Jonah smiled and immediately went to make arrangements.

Soon, all these families received the news and sent people to Novaria.

Novaria was a country with a coalition system, where the wealth gap between member countries was unbalanced. It was a paradise for criminals and a playground for the rich.

With money, you could enjoy an excellent life here. There was no need to worry about threats from criminals because the protected areas here had very strong firepower to suppress them. Therefore, it attracted a large number of evil capitalists and corrupt officials.

On the outskirts of the wealthy area was a street. Although it was not under the jurisdiction of the wealthy, it was relatively safe and orderly due to its proximity. Here, people didn't need to worry about being robbed or being assaulted for no reason.

Jasper walked out of a luxurious store, his expression sour.

"Darn it, why did the gold price drop again?" Jasper muttered to himself as he discreetly touched the stack of bills in his pocket, feeling a bit frustrated.

If Jasper opened his mouth wide, you'd see that he had lost a few more teeth.

Anyone who dared to open a jewelry store here had a powerful background. This was also a prime spot for money laundering and selling stolen goods.

Not long after Jasper left the gold shop, another young man walked out.

This young man was Tim, who had been tracking Jasper. Instead of following him, he went in the opposite direction.

Tim wasn't worried about losing track of Jasper; Jasper still didn't know that there was a tracker inside him.

"How many gold teeth does Jasper have? How obsessed is he with gold?" Tim muttered.

###chapter 320 Michael's Speculation

Tim had heard from Joe earlier that Jasper had given him a bunch of gold teeth.

Back then, Tim thought Jasper had handed over all of his gold teeth, but he was shocked to find out there were still some left in his mouth.

Tim headed back to his hotel and flopped onto the bed. Jasper's place was just across the street. To avoid suspicion, he took a bit of a detour.

He pulled out his phone and called Michael to fill him in on Jasper's latest antics.

"So, you're telling me Jasper's out there selling gold teeth again?" Michael's brow furrowed, his eyes flickering with thought.

Tim nodded. "Yeah, Mr. Williams. Jasper checks the gold price every day. Honestly, I feel like prying open his mouth to see how many gold teeth he's still got."

After Tim finished talking, he noticed Michael had gone quiet on the other end. Figuring Michael was deep in thought, he stayed silent and waited.

A few minutes later, Michael's voice came through the phone.

"Do you think Jasper might have turned all his embezzled money into gold?" Michael asked.

Tim was caught off guard. "Turned it all into gold? Well, it's not impossible, but considering how much he embezzled, that'd be a ton of gold, right?"

Michael chuckled. "If that's what he did, then Jasper's a real idiot. There are so many ways to hide assets, and he picked the dumbest one."

Tim scratched his head with a sheepish grin. "Honestly, Mr. Williams, if I were trying to hide money, I'd probably invest in some valuable items and stash them away."

"You don't get business and finance, and that's okay. But Jasper, running a company and not thinking of better ways, just shows he's got the business sense of a rock," Michael grumbled about Jasper again.

"The price of gold is going up in two days. Keep a close watch on Jasper. If he really turned all that money into gold, he'll definitely make a move soon," Michael instructed Tim before hanging up.

After the call, Tim scratched his head and muttered with a wry smile, "Mr. Williams knows his stuff, but Jasper really does seem like a fool in camparison."

Meanwhile, members of the four major families were trickling into Novaria. Despite the chaos, they had some connections here to help them handle shady business.

They reached out to their contacts, and with the help of local gangs, started hunting for Jasper.

With the gangs on the lookout, it was only a matter of time before they found Jasper. Despite his disguises, he wasn't completely safe.

Two days later, Jasper showed up at the jewelry store again. This time, his eyes lit up when he saw the gold prices.

"Awesome, it's even higher than before! I'm finally gonna strike it rich!" Jasper was so excited he almost teared up. He quickly looked down to hide his emotions.

Not far away, Tim was watching the whole scene unfold, a smirk playing on his lips. He thought, 'Looks like Mr. Williams was right. Jasper really did turn all that embezzled money into gold.'

After leaving the jewelry store, Jasper headed straight back to his place and stayed in for the rest of the day.

Tim lay in his room, quietly monitoring the location updates on his phone. He was patient, knowing Jasper would make a move eventually. Based on human nature, Jasper was likely to act late at night.

Tim stayed alert, ready to spring into action at any moment.

Suddenly, his phone vibrated. Tim's eyes snapped open, and he saw a red dot flashing on the screen, indicating Jasper was on the move.

'Is he finally making a move? Let's see where he's hiding all that money,' Tim thought, a glint of excitement in his eyes as he quickly left the hotel.

Meanwhile, under the cover of night, Jasper made his way to a rundown warehouse.

Jasper was super cautious, constantly checking his surroundings to make sure he wasn't being followed.

With the tracking device, Tim didn't need to get too close, avoiding the risk of being spotted.

Tim found that Jasper had stayed in one spot for a very long time before finally leaving. He followed the tracker to the rundown warehouse.

The warehouse door was locked and reeked of chemicals, a smell so bad even the homeless avoided it.

Covering his nose, Tim approached the door and found a lock. Picking it was no big deal for him.

He pulled out a thin wire, inserted it into the lock, and soon enough, the door clicked open.

Inside, the smell was even worse. Tim lifted his shirt to cover his nose and started searching.

But all he found were some old plastic barrels.

"Damn, there's nothing here! Did we guess wrong? Did Jasper turn all that money into plastic barrels? Is he planning to sell scrap?" Tim muttered in frustration.

Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly stopped.

"Wait a minute. This place doesn't add up. The warehouse looks huge from the outside, but the inside seems smaller." Tim squinted, suspecting there was a hidden room.

He searched again and accidentally pushed an ornament on a shelf, triggering a mechanism.

A wall slowly slid open, revealing several cars behind it.

"Could it be? If so, Jasper really surprised me." Tim could hear his heartbeat pounding in his chest.

He walked over to one of the cars, pulled out a small knife, and scraped the surface. Under the paint, gold gleamed!

"These cars are made of gold! I was right after all," Tim's face lit up with excitement.

###chapter 321 Replace them with Counterfeits

Michael's hunch was spot on. Jasper had turned all the public funds into gold and used the metal's unique properties to craft them into cars.

When Tim stumbled upon the gold cars, he couldn't contain his excitement. He scraped off the paint from each one, confirming they were all solid gold. Without wasting a second, he called Michael.

Michael was in bed with Isabella when the phone rang, waking them both. Isabella groaned in annoyance as Michael reluctantly answered the call.

"Who is it, babe? Who's calling you this late?" Isabella mumbled, still half-asleep.

Michael rubbed his eyes, checked the caller ID, and after a moment's hesitation, picked up the phone.

"Mr. Williams, we have a lead. I found where Jasper stashed the public funds. You were right; he turned them into gold!" Tim's voice buzzed with excitement.

Michael's eyes lit up, and Isabella, hearing the commotion, perked up.

"Did I hear my dad's name? Is this the private detective you hired?" Isabella asked, surprised.

Michael nodded. "Yeah, I had the PI team up with my dad's old contacts. They managed to track down your dad using their international connections."

Tim, realizing the time difference, felt a bit guilty for disturbing them.

"Sorry for calling so late, Mr. Williams. I got too excited," Tim apologized.

Michael leaned back against the headboard, pulling Isabella close, and switched to speakerphone.

"No worries. Tell us everything. We need some good news," Michael said, smiling.

Tim quickly filled them in on how they tracked Jasper to an abandoned chemical factory.

"It's so stinky here that no one comes around. Using this place as a gold stash is pretty clever," Isabella admitted, impressed.

"Now that we know where my dad's hiding the funds, but they're overseas. What do we do next?" Isabella asked, looking at Michael.

Tim, still on the line, waited for Michael's instructions.

Michael drummed his fingers on his knee, a mischievous glint in his eyes.

"Babe, I just had a fun idea," Michael said, grinning at Isabella.

Isabella's curiosity was piqued. "Tell me more."

"We'll have Tim take photos of the gold cars, then we'll buy identical ones and gold-plate them. When your dad finds out his cars are fakes, think he'll be pissed?" Michael suggested with a playful smirk.

Isabella's eyes sparkled with mischief. "That's a bit naughty, but I love it. I can't wait to see his face when he realizes his precious cars are fakes. It'll be priceless."

Isabella laughed, feeling like a total villain in that moment.

With Isabella's nod of approval, Michael spoke into the phone, "Tim, you catch all that?"

Tim chuckled on the other end, "Loud and clear, Mr. Williams. I know what to do."

Michael nodded. "I'll call you later about buying the cars and covering the costs. I'll also send some extra hands your way. Be careful, though. I heard the four major families are also hunting for Jasper. If they find him, avoid any conflicts and keep yourselves safe."

Tim's tone turned serious, "Got it, Mr. Williams. We'll handle it safely."

After hanging up, Tim wanted to drive the cars out but realized there were no keys. Jasper must've hidden them.

Unfazed, Tim jotted down the car models and left the chemical factory, making sure to cover his tracks so Jasper wouldn't notice if he came back.

The next night, local car dealerships were buzzing with orders from a young man buying up a bunch of cars.

Similarly, a repair shop got a bizarre request from the same young man, asking for all the cars to be gold-plated!

"What kind of request is this? Do these people have too much money to burn? Gold plating isn't even real gold," one repair shop employee grumbled.

The shop owner walked over and smacked the employee on the head. "The customer is king. They've paid us a fortune, so get to work and stop whining!" the owner barked.

The employees got to work immediately.

Meanwhile, Jasper was blissfully unaware that his secret had been uncovered. He was busy contacting wealthy businessmen to sell the gold cars at a good price.

Finding someone willing to buy that much gold at once wasn't easy. Jasper had painstakingly accumulated the embezzled public funds and had the gold cars made one by one.

If he had the patience, he could sell the cars individually like before. But given the current gold prices, even if selling them all at once meant a slightly lower price, it was still acceptable. The main thing was that he could quickly move into a wealthy area and live the high life without worrying about safety.

In another city, members of the three major families gathered. This time, it wasn't the leaders but their reps.

The Larson Family's rep was Tanner Skye, a small, wiry guy with fierce eyes.

Tanner slammed the table and shouted at the others, "Didn't we have a lead on Jasper? Why the hell hasn't he been nabbed yet?"

###chapter 322 Clues Found by the Three Major Families

Tanner was fuming. Just a few minutes ago, their gang stumbled upon a big lead: someone had spotted Jasper hanging around a jewelry store.

With this hot tip, the local gang quickly tracked down the hotel where Jasper was crashing.

Jay Belle, the Davis Family's rep, was a tall, skinny middle-aged guy with glasses. He adjusted his specs and shot a glance at the woman next to him. The woman, Hadley Ruth, had short hair and looked pretty average. She was the Brown Family's rep.

"Ms. Ruth, got any thoughts?" Jay asked Hadley.

"If I remember right, Mr. Brown said since your gang found Jasper, we're just here to back you up," Hadley replied with a faint smile.

Hadley remembered Paxton's stern warning before she left: don't expect anything useful from Jasper. Her job was to lay low and watch the other three families tear each other apart.

Tanner shot Hadley a look and grumbled, "You and your boss are both cowards."

Hadley gave Tanner a cold stare and slowly reached for her gun.

Jay noticed the tension and quickly stepped in. "Alright, we do want to nab Jasper fast, but we need to check out what the Williams Family is up to first."

Even though Jay said this, he sighed inwardly. All three families knew that, despite appearances, they had secretly sent people to track Jasper down. They all wanted to find him first and squeeze the secret of family revival out of him.

Just then, someone knocked on the door and rushed in. "Madam, sirs, just got word that members of another gang have been spotted near Jasper's place."

After the informant left, the three of them got serious.

They weren't idiots. The sudden appearance of another gang's members could only mean the Williams Family was pulling the strings.

"Looks like the Williams Family made a move and found Jasper. But are these guys under John or Mason?" Jay asked.

Tanner waved impatiently, "It doesn't matter which side they are. They're all enemies. Shoot them on sight. No rules here."

Hadley glanced at Tanner, her eyes mocking but not disagreeing, clearly on board with the plan.

Jay sighed softly. He wasn't thrilled about going head-to-head with the Williams Family, especially with killing involved. The Davis Family usually played it safe, with few extremists.

Among the four families, the Larson Family was the most extreme and hot-headed. Tanner's reaction showed he and Anthony were cut from the same cloth.

"Alright, let's move. We need to find Jasper before the Williams Family does," Jay ordered. As the cooperative face of the three families, he was the best fit to lead.

On the flip side, Tim managed to convince the repair shops with a hefty wad of cash to gold-plate all the cars he bought overnight.

Right then, Michael's crew showed up at Tim's place.

Tim had the cars driven to the warehouse and used forklifts to haul the gold-plated cars away.

To make it all look legit, Tim even swapped out the tires on the gold-plated cars with new ones. Now, even if Jasper stood right in front of them, he wouldn't suspect a thing. No need to worry about the smell difference between new and old cars; the place already reeked enough.

After the switch, Tim had the real gold cars shipped near the dock and got in touch with an export manager. Using his connections, the cars were loaded into containers. Before long, Isabella and the crew would get this shiny gift.

Tim sent a few guys to the smuggling ship to keep an eye on the cars, making sure they didn't get discovered.

Once everything was set, Tim gathered everyone. He grinned and said, "Alright, this mission ain't over yet. Remember, we still need a witness to prove these things are public funds."

The witness Tim was talking about was Jasper. They needed to bring back the public funds and Jasper, who was now a wanted man and could fetch a nice bounty.

Meanwhile, the four families had started digging into Jasper's whereabouts.

Jasper had just left the wealthy district and finally found a rich guy who could buy all that gold at once.

"Sweet, I can finally ditch this broke life! Once I get the cash, I'm getting a gold tooth, hiring a hitman to take out those who messed with me, and finding some women! I'm so done with Mia's wrinkled body." Jasper whistled happily as he got to his place.

Jasper planned to grab his car keys from his room and have the rich guy's people pick up the gold cars.

But as he reached the door, he froze.

Jasper had always been cautious because the security sucked here. Every time he went out, he'd leave a hair stuck in the door.

When he got to the door, he saw the hair on the ground, meaning someone had been in his room.

Jasper had already put the keys in the lock, but he pulled them out.

"Damn it, how could I leave such an important thing outside?" Jasper pretended to have lost something and quickly walked away.

Just as he was about to leave, the door behind him swung open, and a voice roared.

"Jasper, don't even think about running. You're coming back with us."

###chapter 323 Fooled Again

Jasper heard a noise behind him and didn't even dare to look back. He picked up the pace, and as he rushed downstairs, he unexpectedly ran into another group of people heading his way.

The two men and one woman at the front froze when they saw Jasper, then immediately started shouting.

"It's Jasper, grab him!" Jay yelled excitedly. They didn't expect to catch Jasper trying to leave just as they got downstairs.

Jasper was startled but quickly thought of a plan. He shouted, "Stop them for me!"

Everyone who heard him froze, looking at each other in confusion, thinking Jasper had backup.

But soon, another group of people came rushing down from upstairs. Leading them was a guy with green hair and face tattoos, Peter Jade, sent by John to find Jasper.

Peter heard Jasper's shout and mistook Jay's group for Jasper's allies, so he ordered his men to attack them.

Similarly, Jay's group thought Peter was with Jasper, and both sides started fighting.

The street was filled with the sounds of intense gunfire and screams.

As for Jasper, he had already slipped away when the fighting started.

With his place in chaos, Jasper headed to his smelly warehouse.

After Jasper escaped, a sneaky figure appeared at the scene of the fight and made a call to Tim.

"Mr. Bridges, the other three families are fighting with the Williams Family, and Jasper has escaped. What should we do next?" the subordinate asked on the phone.

Tim was quietly lurking in the woods near the abandoned warehouse. He smiled and said, "Find a way to let these guys know that Jasper's on the run. Then give them the address of Jasper's hideout."

Tim's subordinate nodded and shouted loudly towards the warring factions.

"Jasper has run away!" After shouting, Tim's subordinate hid.

Upon hearing this, members of the four major families stopped, realizing Jasper was gone.

"You fools, your boss has run away, why are you still here?" Peter mocked angrily.

Jay stopped Tanner from arguing with Peter and asked, "What do you mean? Aren't you Jasper's people?"

"How could I be his people? I'm here to capture him," Peter said, then suddenly paused.

Peter looked at Jay, Tanner, and Hadley, sensing they were leaders. He seemed to understand something.

"Are you from the three major families?" Peter asked.

Jay looked at Peter and asked, "Are you from the Williams Family?"

The four major families exchanged glances, realizing they had all been played by Jasper.

After a moment, Peter sneered, "Looks like we're competitors. Let's see who can find Jasper first and get all the info we need from him."

Jay smirked back, "The ultimate winner will definitely be us."

Peter didn't waste any more time chatting with the other families. He just took his men and left.

Once Peter was gone, Hadley turned to her two companions and asked, "What should we do next? Keep looking for Jasper?"

Jay nodded. "Jasper can't have gone too far. Let's keep searching. We'll find him sooner or later."

The three and their groups went back, leaving the local gang members to keep searching for Jasper.

Back at their place, Hadley split up from Jay and Tanner.

A little while later, one of Hadley's subordinates came in, looking pretty pleased with himself. He whispered to Hadley, "Ms. Ruth, we've found Jasper."

Hadley's eyes lit up, but she asked suspiciously, "Why are you so nervous? Do the other families know?"

The subordinate shook his head and whispered, "Someone spotted Jasper at an abandoned chemical factory. This guy was picking up scrap iron near the factory to sell, and he saw a familiar figure. He even took a photo."

The subordinate pulled out the scavenger's old, cracked phone. The blurry photo on the screen clearly showed Jasper. The gang members had been showing Jasper's photo around, so it wasn't surprising the scavenger recognized him.

Excitement sparkled in Hadley's eyes. "Is this info reliable? Are you sure it's not a setup?" she asked.

The subordinate nodded proudly. "I was just asking the gang members if they knew of any prostitutes around, and I saw this scavenger coming our way. After hearing what he said, I brought him back. Now he and the gang members with me are locked up together. The other two families definitely don't know about this."

Hadley patted the subordinate's shoulder approvingly. Although Paxton didn't expect to gain anything this time, if she did manage to dig up the Taylor Family's secrets, she'd be in for some serious recognition.

"Keep an eye on them, don't let the other families find out. I'm taking my people to capture Jasper now." Hadley patted his shoulder again, then gathered her group and quietly set off for the chemical factory.

###chapter 324 The Scam of the Scavenger

Hadley never saw it coming that there were actually four of the so-calledd scavengers.

Each of these four guys reached out to the big families, showing them the same photo.

"Awesome, only we know this. The other families are in the dark. The Taylor Family's secret is ours!" Jay, usually the calm one, was visibly pumped by the thought of such a huge advantage. He knew he had to act fast.

Jay waved his hand and headed to the abandoned factory with his crew.

The same thing was happening with the other two guys.

But the scavengers showed up in a certain order, making sure they didn't all leave at the same time and bump into each other on the way, avoiding any awkward run-ins.

Meanwhile, Tim's crew let him know the scavengers had done their job.

Tim had set it all up to stir up trouble among the families.

"Everyone's ready, now we just sit back and watch the show." Tim grinned coldly, eager to see the families go at it.

Tim and his gang waited patiently in the woods outside the chemical plant. Finally, the first car rolled up.

It was Hadley.

Hadley parked behind the warehouse like the scavenger had told her. They all jumped out and rushed into the factory.

As soon as Hadley got out of the car, she was hit by a nasty stench. If it wasn't for catching Jasper, she wouldn't have come to this gross place.

When Hadley got to the door, she stopped and told her crew, "Find Jasper, remember to catch him alive and bring him to me."

Then she gagged and quickly got back in the car to turn on the air circulation.

Glad to be away from the stink, Hadley felt bad for her crew who had to find Jasper.

Meanwhile, Jasper was chilling in a secret room, startled by the sound of a car engine outside.

Holding a gun, Jasper guarded the door, worried that if they found him, he and his gold would be toast.

"Damn, how did they find this place? Are they from the four big families or just some gangs?" Jasper muttered.

Hadley's crew searched the warehouse but couldn't find Jasper.

One guy, covering his nose, came back to Hadley and reported what he found.

Frowning, Hadley said, "You're telling me Jasper's not in there? How is that possible? Are you sure there's no secret room?"

Just as the subordinate was about to shake his head, Hadley heard the roar of another car.

Her face darkened when she saw Jay pulling up.

Jay parked and got out with his crew, his expression souring when he saw Hadley.

"What are you doing here?" they both asked at the same time.

"Did you plant a mole in my crew?" they echoed again.

After speaking in unison, they realized the awkwardness but quickly pieced together the situation.

"Is Jasper in this warehouse? Don't lie to me, someone saw him here," Jay demanded.

Hadley sneered, "If I tell you Jasper's not inside, would you believe me?"

Jay didn't buy it. He signaled his men to search the warehouse. Like Hadley's crew, they found nothing.

Jay furrowed his brows, frustrated.

Just then, a third car sped up. This time, Tanner jumped out.

The hot-headed Tanner immediately raised his gun at Jay and Hadley as soon as he got out.

"Did you two bastards plant a mole in my crew? Why are you here before me?" Tanner demanded angrily.

Jay frowned while Hadley waved her hand.

All of Hadley's crew raised their guns, aiming at Tanner.

"Enough, Hadley, and you, Tanner, cut it out. Something's off. I swear I didn't plant a mole in any of your crews." Jay walked over, pushed Tanner's hand away, and waved to Hadley. Her crew lowered their guns.

Tanner glared at Jay and asked, "Then tell me, how did you know about this place? I'm the only one who knows about it."

Jay realized something was wrong. He quickly asked, "How did you find this place? I'll go first, I heard it from a scavenger."

Hadley was stunned. "I heard it from a scavenger too."

Tanner also sensed something was off. "Could it be we met the same scavenger?"

Jay's brows furrowed tightly, and he immediately called his crew to investigate the scavenger, only to be told that the scavenger had just escaped.

Jay's face darkened, and Hadley and Tanner weren't in a good mood either. They didn't need to make a call to know their scavengers had also escaped.

"This is a trap set for us, but by who?" Hadley pondered aloud.

Tanner growled, "It must be the Williams Family! Last time, we had many gang members, but now it's just the family's hitmen with us. Peter's trying to throw us off."

Jay shook his head. "If Peter were that behind this, he'd ambush and kill us here. Without us, the gang members wouldn't be a threat."

###chapter 325 They All Got Tricked

The three families went dead quiet.

After Tanner's crew showed up, they combed through the warehouse too, but came up empty-handed.

This just made them buy into Jay's story even more. Peter might've just wanted to lure them here and then take them out.

Hadley voiced her doubts, "If things are really like you think, why hasn't anyone come after us yet? We're still safe, for now at least."

Tanner scratched his head. "Maybe we drove too fast for them to set up an ambush?"

Hadley rolled her eyes. "Seriously?"

Tanner pointed at Hadley, fuming. "I can't stand it when people roll their eyes at me. Do it again, and I'll gouge your eyeballs out, you ugly woman."

"I'd love to rip out your tongue, asshole," Hadley shot back, hating being called ugly.

"Enough! Is this really the time to argue? Maybe Tanner's right. Peter didn't want to kill us; he wanted to lure us away so he could go after Jasper. He might really know where Jasper is," Jay analyzed.

But then Hadley raised another point. "But it still doesn't add up. If Peter wanted to lure us away, why not just tell all three of us directly? Why talk to us one by one? Isn't that a waste of time?"

"Why do you have so many questions? The main thing now is where Peter is. We need to find Jasper before he does," Tanner snapped at Hadley.

Hadley fired a shot beside Tanner's feet, sending debris flying.

"You crazy woman!" Tanner yelled, raising his gun and aiming at Hadley.

"Enough, stop it! Now's not the time," Jay said, stepping between them and pushing their gun barrels down.

"I think I've figured out Peter's plan. He wants to create rifts to break our alliance," Jay guessed, but unfortunately, this wasn't Peter's goal-it was Tim's.

Hadley sneered, "Is that even necessary? We all want Jasper's hidden family treasure for ourselves. Once we find him, we're definitely going to end up fighting each other for it."

"I'll gouge your eyeballs out and stuff them up your ass!" Tanner snarled.

"Enough, you idiots!" Jay roared. "We represent our families! The family heads ordered us to cooperate. Do you dare disobey?"

Hadley and Tanner went silent after hearing Jay's words. Even though each of the three families had their own agendas, they still needed to keep up appearances.

"So, what do we do next?" Hadley asked quietly.

Tanner was also waiting for Jay's instructions.

"Next, we head back and have someone track down Peter. He might've already found Jasper," Jay said seriously.

Hadley and Tanner nodded in agreement.

Jasper, hiding in the secret room, felt a wave of relief as the voices outside died down.

"Looks like they didn't find these secret rooms. Must've been a routine check by the gang members. Dodged a bullet there," Jasper muttered, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead.

But then, Jasper heard gunshots outside, followed by the roar of car engines.

"What's going on out there? Should've installed a surveillance camera," Jasper grumbled.

He had thought about setting up surveillance but figured it would draw too much attention to the rundown plant. Plus, he didn't have the cash for it.

Before selling those gold cars, Jasper was pretty much broke, only having a bit left from selling his gold teeth.

The place where Jasper had been staying wasn't as safe as the rich neighborhoods, but it wasn't a total warzone either, and it was pricey.

As Jasper cursed his luck, so did the people outside the factory.

"Damn it, did you guys plant moles around me? Why are you all here?" Peter yelled at the three in front of him.

Peter had gotten Jasper's whereabouts from a scavenger and was thrilled to bring his crew over, only to find folks from the other three families there too.

When Jay saw Peter, they were just as shocked.

Peter showing up here blew all their previous theories out of the water.

"Wait, were you also tricked by the scavenger to come here?" Hadley asked, stunned.

Peter frowned. "What do you mean? You got tricked too?"

Jay nodded. "Looks like someone is targeting all four of our families. But what's this guy's endgame?"

Peter smirked at Jay, "I don't care about their purpose. I just know Jasper's definitely hiding here."

With that, Peter waved his hand, and his men rushed towards the warehouse.

Peter had brought a lot of guys, mostly gang members. Jay and the others felt outnumbered, as they only had a few family hitmen, not as many as Peter's gang.

However, Hadley and the others weren't eager to confront Peter; they had already searched the warehouse and found nothing.

But Peter wasn't buying it. He pulled out his gun, fired a shot into the sky, and then pointed it at Jay and the others.

"Speak up, did you hide Jasper?" Peter asked coldly.

Hadley sneered, "If we found Jasper, why would we still be here?"

Peter shot back, "Because I got here too fast, you didn't have time to leave!"

Hadley laughed and looked at Tanner, "This jerk is even more annoying than you."

###chapter 326 Discovering the Secret Room

Peter was convinced that Hadley and his crew had stashed Jasper away, which was why he couldn't track him down. Peter's cockiness, fueled by his connections to the Williams Family, was pretty obvious.

Being the head of the big four families, a bit of arrogance was expected.

But Peter's attitude really got under Hadley, Jay, and Tanner's skin.

Tanner brushed off Hadley's grumbling and stepped up, jabbing a finger at Peter's face, "Got any proof we're hiding him, or are you just making stuff up? We've got limited people and cars. Go ahead, search if you want. If you come up empty, I'll blow your brains out."

Tanner's fiery temper made Peter's face darken instantly.

Peter slowly raised his gun. Tanner, just as stubborn, lifted his own gun and aimed it right at Peter's head.

The tension in the air was thick.

"Even if you've got more people, so what? We've got enough too! Hadley, Jay, let's take Peter down together." Tanner's lips curled into a cold smile, trying to rally his buddies.

But Hadley and Jay didn't back him up. Instead, they stepped back, acting like they didn't even know him.

"What the hell are you guys doing?" Tanner was fuming at his friends' reaction.

Peter sneered, "Looks like your buddies don't want to back you up."

Tanner, red with rage, shouted, "Why are you two doing this? Have you forgotten our family's leader said we're allies now?"

Jay and Hadley just rolled their eyes.

"Tanner, if anyone ever calls you brainless, count me in. You really thought dragging our ally into this mess was a good idea? What are you thinking?" Hadley said sarcastically.

Tanner's face got even redder, and he looked like he wanted to shoot Hadley.

Jay, more calmly, said, "Tanner, why'd you have to rile up Peter for nothing? The fact is, we haven't found Jasper. If he doesn't trust us. If he doesn't believe us, let him search. And we would find nothing. We can't give him what we don't have. Why stir the pot now? Can't you see we're already on the back foot?"

Tanner's face fell, while Peter looked confused.

"Wait, you really haven't found Jasper?" Peter asked, eyeing everyone suspiciously.

Jay shrugged. "We really haven't found Jasper. If you don't believe us, go ahead and search. We don't mind."

Peter frowned, but he was beginning to trust Jay because of his calm demeanor.

Seeing Peter's doubt, Jay stepped forward, positioning himself between Peter and Tanner.

"Alright, guys, let's put the guns down. Why don't we think about why four scavengers came to us at the same time to sell out Jasper's whereabouts? Doesn't that seem fishy to you?" Jay said to the group.

With Jay playing peacemaker, the tension eased, and Peter and Tanner slowly lowered their guns.

Peter frowned and said, "Are you saying someone's trying to mess with us? But who'd have the guts to go after the four major families?"

Jay shook his head. "I'm not sure, but if that scavenger's photo is legit, it means Jasper was here. The fact that we can't find him is weird."

Hadley glanced at the abandoned warehouse, hesitating. "You think there might be a hidden room in there?"

As soon as Hadley said it, the other three guys were stunned.

Peter waved to his crew. "Search thoroughly and see if there's a hidden room."

Hadley and his men headed into the warehouse, with Jay and Tanner right behind them.

Inside the hidden room, Jasper heard the noise outside gradually fade, thinking they'd left. But just as he started to relax, he heard even louder footsteps, more people than before.

Jasper thought, 'Are these guys nuts? It's just a rundown warehouse. You can see there's nothing here. Why are they still searching?' He was worried sick they might figure out there was a hidden room.

Trembling, Jasper pulled out his gun, nervously eyeing the door. This was his last resort. If the cars behind him were found by the four major families, they wouldn't spare him. He was doomed.

Even though the warehouse was big, with so many people searching, they were bound to find something odd.

Soon, someone noticed a spot on a shelf that looked like it had been touched a lot.

"Mr. Jade, this part seems a bit off," someone reported to Peter.

Peter walked over, with Hadley and the others following.

Peter saw that this part was cleaner than the rest, which were covered in dust.

Peter smirked, grabbing and turning the part.

As Peter moved his hand, a hidden door slowly opened, revealing the hidden room.

Everyone's eyes were glued to the entrance, and Jasper felt a wave of despair.

"Damn bastards, I'll fight you to the end!" Desperate, Jasper pulled the trigger, firing wildly.

Bullets hit two unlucky guys, but most were dodged.

Peter shot Jasper's gun, knocking it out of his hand. Hadley and the others started firing back.

Their aim was way better than Jasper's, each shot hitting his limbs.

Jasper collapsed, blood pouring from his wounds, pain searing through his limbs, unable to move. He knew he wouldn't die now; what awaited him was endless torture.

"Damn it! What have I done to deserve this? Why give me hope and then take it away? I've given up everything. Why can't you let me live out the rest of my life in peace?" Jasper shouted in despair.

###chapter 327 Golden Cars

The reps from the four big families barged into the secret room right after roughing up Jasper. They all wanted to nab Jasper and get their hands on the Taylor Family's secret, but Peter wasn't about to let the other families in on it.

So, Peter just up and shot Tanner.

Tanner took a bullet to the chest but didn't even bleed. Peter quickly figured out Tanner was wearing a bulletproof vest.

Just as Peter was about to fire again, Tanner ducked behind a car.

Peter's bullet hit the car's hood and bounced off, showing a flash of gold where it hit.

Peter's crew quickly noticed something was off with the cars. One guy scraped off some paint with a knife and found gold underneath. "Guys, these cars are gold! We're rich!" he yelled, all excited.

His shout was like throwing a match into gasoline. The whole place went nuts.

The gang members, hearing the cars were solid gold, got this hungry look in their eyes, like wolves spotting a meal.

They all ignored Peter's orders and started fighting over the cars.

Peter looked around, stunned. He had the numbers, but now his advantage was gone. Against the other three families, he didn't have enough guys left.

"You idiots, stop! Can't you wait until we finish this fight? Then you can grab the cars!" Peter yelled, grabbing one of his guys.

The guy shoved Peter away and ran for the nearest car.

The once-loyal henchmen didn't care about their boss anymore. If they could snag a car, they could ditch this risky life and live like kings.

Peter raised his gun at the guy but then lowered it, frustrated.

Jasper, lying on the ground, watched his cars get snatched up, tears streaming down his face. He felt his life slipping away, his body getting colder. He knew he wouldn't make it, so he let himself die in despair. After all, he couldn't take the gold with him.

"Looks like Jasper traded all his embezzled funds for these cars," Hadley whistled at the gang members.

The four family reps were tempted too. Those gold cars were worth a fortune, more than they could ever afford.

But the family reps valued order and discipline more than the gang members.

The sight of the gold cars put a temporary pause on the battle between the four families.

But that didn't mean the four major families were about to sit down and calmly discuss who got to claim Jasper.

Out of nowhere, a bullet hit Tanner in the chest at the secret room's entrance.

Tanner hit the ground again, yelling, "Peter, you jerk! Why do you always go for me first? Everyone, take him out!"

Tanner fired his gun, and the other three family reps started shooting at Peter too, like they were all on the same page.

Peter thought, 'Damn it, these guys are ganging up on me. I'm outnumbered, but I'm not gonna let myself die here.' He ducked behind a car, not giving a damn about his gang members.

The gang members didn't care about each other either. They were just glad there were fewer people to compete with for the cars.

Each bullet was a potential death sentence for a gang member.

The remaining gang members were still fighting over the driver's seats.

Peter, with morale in the gutter, used his gang members as human shields, hiding behind them and shooting at the three family reps, actually managing to take a few of them out.

The three family reps weren't about to keep taking hits and launched an even fiercer counterattack.

"Fight, keep fighting. The more people die, the better," Jasper muttered with a grim smile. His vision blurred, and he saw a figure in front of him.

"You can't die. Your fate should be in prison, not lying here waiting to die," Tim whispered, then quickly dragged Jasper out of the secret room.

The bullet that flew out of the secret room door was fired by Tim, to stir up the fight among the four families again. Without the chaos, he couldn't get Jasper out.

Tim quickly got Jasper out of the chemical plant, heading for the nearest hospital. They needed to patch Jasper up, save his life, and then send him back for legal judgment.

Back in the secret room, the four family reps were still going at it, and their numbers were dwindling.

Peter, with the least loyal family hitmen in tow, was losing his guys fast, and his anger was boiling over.

Peter hated the three families, Jasper, and his own disloyal gang members. "You damn bastards, all of you can go to hell!"

Peter fired a shot at a car's gas tank.

The bullet hit the gas tank, causing an explosion.

The flames and shockwave took out the nearest gang members.

"Damn it, Peter's lost it, run!" Jay shouted, leading his men out of the secret room.

"You think you can run? Think again!" Peter laughed, firing at the gas tanks of the remaining cars.

###chapter 328 For the Gold

Bullets ripped through the gas tanks, and boom! The cars went up in flames, turning the whole abandoned warehouse into a fiery inferno.

Screams echoed as Hadley and Tanner bolted out with their crew. More gang members, engulfed in flames, stumbled out only to collapse and die moments later.

Peter didn't make it. Looked like he got caught in the blast.

The three families' faces were grim. They survived but lost a lot of men and gained nothing. They dreaded the punishment waiting for them back home.

Hadley sighed, staring at the blazing warehouse. "Guys, let's head back. With a fire this big, Jasper's probably toast. We got zilch."

Tanner's face was tight with pain. His bulletproof vest had stopped the bullets, but his chest hurt like hell-probably a couple of broken ribs.

He glanced at Hadley and Jay. Their faces were just a bit sooty, no major injuries.

Tanner knew their alliance was done for. No common interests meant no friendship.

Without a word, Tanner turned and left with his remaining men.

Hadley and Jay didn't care. They exchanged a look and left with their people too.

But after a while, they all came back at the same time.

Hadley and Jay eyed Tanner. "Weren't you leaving? Why are you back?" they asked.

Tanner snorted, "Why didn't you leave?"

Jay shrugged. "Looks like we all have the same goal."

Hadley ran a hand through his hair and smirked, "Alright, let's be real. We're all after the gold here. I counted about six cars inside. Perfect-each family gets two. No more fighting, and it covers some of our losses."

Jay and Tanner exchanged glances and nodded. This was the best they could do for now.

But when the flames died down and they rushed in to check, their eyes went wide.

"Damn it! Weren't these cars supposed to be gold? Why are they just iron?" Tanner yelled, furious.

Jay and Hadley looked just as pissed.

"We've been played. These cars aren't gold; they're just gold-plated," Jay said, adjusting his glasses.

Hadley frowned. "With Jasper's stolen funds, he could've built these with solid gold. Did he stash the money somewhere else?"

Tanner snorted and pointed at the charred bodies. "If you wanna know, go ask Jasper. See if you can figure out which one of these crispy critters is him."

The explosion had left so many charred bodies, it was impossible to tell which one was Jasper.

Hadley sighed, looking at the bodies. "Some of these are our guys. We need to clean up and find Jasper's body. We should bring back his DNA report to convince our leaders."

After Hadley finished speaking, he glanced at Jay and Tanner.

Jay nodded in agreement.

Tanner, already injured and now fuming, suddenly fainted.

His men quickly rushed him to the hospital.

Jay and Hadley watched Tanner's car drive off, exchanging wry smiles.

"I feel like fainting too, just to avoid the family head's wrath," Hadley said with a bitter smile.

Jay shook his head lightly. "Hey, at least we're still breathing. There's always a chance to turn things around."

"You sound like a philosopher," Hadley said, rolling his eyes.

Jay chuckled bitterly. "I studied philosophy in college. Doesn't pay the bills, just makes you hungry."

Jay seemed to recall some bad memories, shook his head, and walked away. They had a lot to do next.

Hadley also left, leaving behind the burning wreckage.

Meanwhile, Tim had taken the unconscious Jasper to the nearest hospital, shelling out a lot of cash to save his life.

Tim didn't plan to leave Jasper there, worried the four families would find out he was alive and start more trouble. To avoid that, he called Michael for help.

"Mr. Williams, we've found Jasper, but he's in bad shape and needs medical help. Otherwise, we'll only be able to bring his body back," Tim informed Michael.

On the other end of the line, Michael quickly gave instructions. He'd send Tim some money to get Jasper to a hospital in the wealthy area first for treatment. Then he'd arrange a private plane to bring Jasper back home.

After getting the money, Tim moved fast, taking Jasper to the wealthy area and waiting for Michael's plane.

After a rough journey, Jasper slowly opened his eyes and looked at Tim, his voice hoarse. "Which family are you from? What happened to my cars?"

Tim shrugged apologetically. "Sorry, your warehouse caught fire. Those gold cars couldn't be saved."

Jasper's eyes looked empty, like he'd lost his soul.

Gold doesn't burn, but it can be stolen. Even without the fire, his gold wouldn't have been safe.

"I don't want to live, let me die," Jasper said softly, looking at Tim.

Tim flat-out refused. "What are you thinking? You can't die. You're still on the wanted list, and I need you for the bounty!"

Jasper sighed softly, closed his eyes, and said nothing more.

As the private plane landed and the medical team took Jasper on board, Michael got the news and informed Isabella.

###chapter 329 All Good News

Isabella was still at work when Michael suddenly called her home.

"Hey babe, what's up? Why'd you call me back so fast?" Isabella asked, a bit worried when she saw Michael.

But Michael just grinned and hugged her, which made Isabella feel better, knowing it wasn't anything serious.

"Geez, you scared me. I thought something bad happened," Isabella said, playfully hitting Michael's chest.

Holding her hand and looking into her eyes, Michael smiled and said, "Babe, I've got some good news and some bad news. Which one do you wanna hear first?"

"You jerk, why are you always playing these games? Just spill it," Isabella said, rolling her eyes.

Michael shrugged and said, "Your dad got shot overseas and almost died."

Isabella blinked and asked, "So, what's the bad news then?"

Michael was taken aback by her response.

"Didn't see that coming, babe. I thought that was already the bad news," Michael said, shaking his head with a wry smile.

Isabella pushed Michael away and plopped down on the sofa. "If you think that's bad news, then hit me with the good news. I'm ready, see, I'm sitting so I won't faint from excitement."

Walking behind the sofa, Michael smiled at Isabella and said, "Your dad's coming home soon. And those cars made of solid gold are on their way. They should be here in about two days."

Isabella's eyes widened as her shock turned to excitement. She jumped up and clung to Michael.

"Babe, you said you wouldn't get excited," Michael teased, looking at Isabella.

Looking at Michael, Isabella wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist.

"I can't believe it! This is amazing! I-I don't even know what to say, I'm just so happy! This means I can clear the debts and become the sole owner of the company!" Isabella kissed Michael excitedly.

Her kiss was so intense that it left a red mark on Michael's face.

"Babe, it's time for Benjamin to start moving too," Michael whispered in her ear.

Isabella nodded. "Got it, I'll call him now."

Isabella jumped off Michael and went to call Benjamin, instructing him to arrest all the doctors bribed by Bianca and to interrogate them.

Upon receiving the message, Benjamin immediately got to work.

Meanwhile, John was fuming. He got news that Peter, the guy he sent to find Jasper, was dead, leaving behind only a charred body. Half of the men he sent didn't make it back alive.

"Damn those three families!" John almost crushed his phone in anger.

When Bianca came back with a plate of fruit and saw John's angry expression, she hurried over to comfort him.

"What's wrong, babe? What happened? Are those people after you again?" Bianca asked, worried.

John took a deep breath, gently holding Bianca's hand, and sighed, "According to the reports, there was a clash between those three families and my guys, which led to an explosion. Lots of casualties on both sides. And the worst part, Jasper's dead."

John didn't know that the remaining people of the three families were trying to identify Jasper's body among the wreckage.

It was a huge task because there were so many shattered bodies at the scene that needed to be collected piece by piece. With Peter gone, his team members figured they didn't have enough people to investigate the scene, so they figured Jasper was probably dead.

Bianca hugged John tightly, comforting him softly, "It's okay, babe. Looks like my uncle's fate is sealed. We won't be able to recover the debts."

Bianca sighed, but John smiled gently at her.

"Babe, don't be so down. The lost debts in the company will be recovered eventually. With Jasper gone, the three families wouldn't keep up their economic pressure on me. I'll have enough money to help you clear the debts," John said, smiling gently.

Bianca hugged John and kissed him on the cheek. "Thanks, babe. When I become the CEO of the company, I'll do everything I can to help you."

John smiled, caressed Bianca's face, and they embraced, enjoying a moment of closeness.

As for John's bet with Mason, he couldn't use their money to cover the debts, but John didn't care about that at all.

After all, John had already sent people to find Jasper, and he could just claim that the money was transferred by Jasper before he died.

It was just a matter of going through a few more steps to prove that the money wasn't his, which wasn't hard for him. The reason he hadn't done it before was just to beat Mason fair and square, but now he didn't care about that anymore.

Meanwhile, Bianca was dreaming about stepping on Isabella with John's help.

But little did Bianca know, on the other side, Benjamin had already arrested all the doctors and nurses who had treated her before.

In an empty room, the medical staff stood trembling, looking fearfully at Benjamin.

Although Benjamin's family wasn't as prominent as the four major families, they held absolute authority in the medical field.

For these medical staff, in some ways, Benjamin's words were even scarier than those of the four major families.

"Alright, everyone, I hope you tell the truth. What did Bianca offer you to help her like this?" Benjamin's calm words sent shivers down their spines.

###chapter 330 Confident Bianca

The medical staff knew Bianca was faking her illness. All those diagnostic reports? They were from other uremia patients, just with Bianca's name slapped on them.

Benjamin figured it all out. At first, some of the medical staff didn't want to admit it because they were scared of pissing off John.

But then Benjamin dropped a bomb on them. "You're scared of John? You should be more scared of me and Mason."

That shut them up real quick.

Benjamin went on, "You know how much Isabella means to Mason, right? Because you faked Bianca's records, John thought about taking Isabella's kidney to save Bianca. Let me tell you, Mason might seem nice now, but back in the day, he killed more people than you can count."

One nurse just crumpled to the floor.

"Please, don't let me die! I don't want to die!" she cried. She'd helped Bianca fabricate her illness and fool John.

Seeing her reaction, Benjamin nodded, satisfied. "If you come clean, I'll give you a way out. I won't let John destroy you."

Once one person confessed, the rest followed, spilling everything to Benjamin.

Soon enough, Benjamin had all the dirt on Bianca's scam.

As a private plane flew into the city's night sky, the medical staff took Jasper to the hospital after it landed.

When Isabella heard Jasper was back, she called Brenda.

On the call, Isabella told Brenda they had to keep a close watch on Jasper and make sure he didn't bolt from the hospital again.

Isabella thought about asking Mason for help but decided to surprise Bianca instead. She worried that if she told Mason ahead of time, he might accidentally let it slip to John, and that would ruin the fun.

In the end, Isabella decided to trust the police, even though there was a risk of leaks. But she knew there were still some good cops like Brenda.

Brenda understood why Isabella called her directly instead of going through official channels. Brenda was frustrated with the state of the police department too, but she couldn't change it. So she found another way to protect Jasper.

Soon, the officers at the station noticed their prettiest colleague, Brenda, was on leave. But they didn't think much of it.

They also didn't notice some young officers missing, sent by Alan to help Brenda. Like her, they weren't bought off by the four big families and were in it for justice.

After meeting Isabella, Brenda got the lowdown on Jasper's injury. She was surprised Isabella managed to bring Jasper back from abroad but didn't ask how she pulled it off.

Brenda and the other officers changed into plainclothes to guard Jasper. This time, they were super careful, making sure none of the four big families caught wind of it.

"I'll make sure Jasper gets back on his feet and faces the music in court once he's better," Brenda said, standing by his bed with a steely look.

The city settled down for a bit, just like John had predicted. The three major families broke off their alliance when they heard Jasper might die, and no one was gunning for John anymore. He could finally chill and ease up on the economic pressure.

The three families' guys abroad-Jay, Hadley, and Tanner-got chewed out by their family heads. They were told to come back as soon as they got the DNA test results.

Other than that, things seemed to go back to normal in the city, with the four big families keeping a low profile.

But some sharp folks could feel something brewing. The whole city seemed like it was on the edge of another storm.

And right in the middle of it were Isabella and Bianca, fighting over shares.

This calm didn't last a week. When a cargo ship docked, Isabella took the upper hand completely.

Brenda went with Isabella to the dock. When they got back, Brenda's eyes were wide with shock.

The other officers were dying to know what Brenda saw, but all she said was that Isabella had won.

John finally got his financial mojo back and started making moves. After a bunch of twists and turns, the money ended up in Bianca's account. Soon, Bianca would be able to use this money to cover the public funds and become the largest shareholder of the Taylor Group.

That day, John called a meeting with the company's execs, skipping Isabella, and ran the show himself.

The execs didn't know what John was up to, but they couldn't afford to piss him off, so they showed up to see what was going on.

Carol got an invite too and immediately told Isabella.

"It's fine, let him do his thing. Today, I'll give everyone a surprise, including John," Isabella said with a sly smile.

Carol felt a weird vibe from Isabella's laugh, thinking this meeting was going to spell trouble for Bianca and John.

All the execs were in the conference room, with Bianca sitting at the head of the table. John, as usual, sat on the other side of her.

"Long time no see, everyone," Bianca greeted the execs with a smile.

The execs didn't respond, knowing Isabella was the president now.

Bianca didn't care about the awkward silence. She smiled and said, "According to the previous agreement, whoever finds Jasper's embezzled public funds gets his shares and becomes a major shareholder in the company."

The execs had mixed feelings, seeing Bianca's confidence. They figured she had gathered some money but didn't know if it was the embezzled fund or John's money.

Just then, the conference room door swung open, and Isabella walked in with her bodyguards.

"Why hold a meeting without telling me, the president? Bianca, is that your seat? Move your butt out of there right now," Isabella said coldly.

###chapter 331 John, the Storyteller

Bianca's face changed the second she spotted Isabella.

Her eyes flashed with resentment, but she quickly pulled herself together when John glanced her way.

"Isabella, what are you even talking about?" Bianca said, looking hurt but staying put in the president's seat.

"I didn't mean to keep you in the dark. I just wanted to wait a bit before sharing the news with you. But since you're here now, I'll spill the beans," Bianca said with a faint smile.

Isabella sneered, not really caring, and took her usual seat across from Bianca.

"For you information, I am the CEO here, and you called this meeting with notifying me. What's in your mind? Worried I'm too busy to show up?" Isabella smirked.

The execs in the room kept their heads down, feeling the tension like a ticking bomb.

"Isabella, you used to be the CEO, but after today, that might change," Bianca said coldly, tapping the table.

Isabella tapped the table back, looking at Bianca with a playful grin, and ran her hand through her hair. "Sorry, cousin, I don't get what you're saying. How am I not the CEO? If I remember right, I'm the only shareholder now, right?"

Bianca's smile turned icy. Just as she was about to say more, John slammed the table impatiently.

"Enough with the fake niceties," John shot a diapproving glance at Bianca.

Bianca pouted, frustrated. Her plan was to rile Isabella up and then crush her.

She had the funds and could become the biggest shareholder anytime.

But John didn't want to waste time. His business had just escaped the grip of the three major families, and he had a lot on his plate. He wasn't in the mood to play along with Bianca.

John looked at Isabella and said calmly, "Isabella, let's cut to the chase. According to the agreement, whoever covers your father's debt gets his shares and becomes the largest shareholder."

The execs in the room eyed Isabella, curious about her next move. Was she going to borrow money from Mason?

Isabella crossed her legs, leaned back, and looked at John with her arms crossed.

"If I'm not mistaken, the deal is whoever finds the money my dad embezzled becomes the largest shareholder. Are you saying you found it?" Isabella said with a faint smile.

John nodded. "Yes, we found the money your dad hid in Novaria. Sadly, he died in a local gang conflict. When our people found him, he was almost dead and handed over the money before he passed away."

The execs in the room stared at John in shock. Jasper dead? And in a gang conflict? It sounded ridiculous.

Everyone knew Jasper had crossed John before. With John's temper, it wasn't far-fetched to think he might've had Jasper killed and blamed it on a gang. But even if they suspected, no one dared to voice it. That'd be career suicide.

Isabella raised an eyebrow, giving John a once-over like she was seeing him for the first time.

"Since when did you become a storyteller?" Isabella laughed.

The old John wasn't kind to Isabella, but he never lied to her. Maybe he thought she wasn't worth lying to.

The execs were amazed; only Isabella had the guts to mock John like that!

Bianca smirked at Isabella, eager to see how long she'd keep her cool.

John felt a twinge of discomfort under Isabella's mocking gaze.

"Believe it or not, that's what your father said," John snorted.

He signaled to Bianca, who pulled out her laptop.

She connected it to the big screen in the room, showing bank transfer details.

"Look closely," Bianca said, pointing to the screen. "The transfer's from a Novaria bank, and the amount matches what Jasper embezzled."

Bianca watched for Isabella's reaction, but she stayed calm.

Isabella's eyes shifted to the execs' faces.

Their expressions were telling. Except for Carol and a few others who stayed neutral, most seemed to side with Bianca.

A male exec smiled and said, "I believe Ms. Bianca Taylor and Mr. Williams wouldn't lie about this. It seems Jasper did hide the money in Novaria."

With one person backing Bianca, others quickly followed.

"Yes, since Ms. Bianca Taylor recovered the embezzled money, she's the largest shareholder."

"Ms. Isabella Taylor, from now on, Ms. Bianca Taylor is our true CEO."

"Ms. Isabella Taylor, unless you find another stash of money, you have no right to stay in this company."

Some execs even started mocking Isabella.

Carol watched Isabella, expecting anger, but she stayed calm.

Suddenly, Isabella clapped her hands and smiled.

Her demeanor silenced the bickering execs.

Isabella's gaze swept over them indifferently. "I gave you all a chance, but it seems you can't handle it. So, it's not my fault."

Then she looked at John. "You said my father gave you the money. So, where's his body?"

###chapter 332 Exposing Your Lies

Isabella's question left John speechless for a moment.

"Come on, speak up! My dad handed over all his embezzled funds to you, and you couldn't even bring back his body?" Isabella taunted, crossing her arms.

Carol raised an eyebrow, surprised at Isabella's boldness. She thought, 'John probably can't prove Jasper gave him the money, but Isabella's attempt to bring him down by this is pretty naive.'

John took a deep breath and said, "The gang conflict was intense. Our people got the funds' location from Jasper, but there was a huge explosion after they left. Your father's body was destroyed, so we couldn't retrieve it."

John continued to weave his story, mixing lies with the truth. He figured there was no way Isabella could actually dig into the truth of this.

A cold smile crept onto Isabella's lips as she watched John spin his tale.

Bianca suddenly felt a bit uneasy. She worried that dragging this out might lead to more complications. Worst of all, if Mason helped Isabella sort out the public funds issue now, all her preparations would be for nothing.

Bianca stood up, looking at Isabella with a serious expression. "Enough, Isabella. I know you're heartbroken over losing your father, but this meeting is about the CEO position. According to our agreement, if I secure the public funds, I get to be the chairwoman and appoint the CEO."

John chimed in, "Exactly. These three companies need the public funds to keep going. We don't have time to argue about evidence and bodies. If you want to investigate, go to Novaria yourself."

Isabella stayed silent.

The executives in the room thought Isabella had run out of tricks and started getting excited again.

"Ms. Isabella Taylor, you need to face reality. The company really needs those public funds."

"Yeah, Ms. Isabella Taylor, if you can't cough up the money, don't stand in the way of others who can. It's not a good look, and people will laugh at you."

"That's right, Ms. Isabella Taylor, just give up the CEO position. Besides, Ms. Bianca Taylor is your sister. She won't make things too hard for you. You can still be a senior executive in the company."

Isabella looked at the executives backing Bianca, a faint smile on her lips. "So you're already acknowledging her as the CEO?"

"Well, can you produce the public funds?" a senior executive sneered.

Isabella shook her head lightly. "I can't produce them now. But give me some time, and I will."

Some executives showed disdainful expressions. To them, Isabella was just stubbornly holding on, but the best way to deal with her was to completely crush her.

To these executives, Isabella was just one step away from being finished.

Isabella's eyes scanned the room, taking in the smug faces of these executives. She knew exactly what they were up to. These guys had been skimming public funds and causing chaos in the company for years.

These execs had all done some shady stuff. Isabella had already dealt with a bunch of people who wanted her gone, but there were still more lurking around.

They hadn't made a move before because they didn't want to push Mason too far. But now, with a legit reason, even Mason couldn't fault them.

Plus, with John backing Bianca, they felt pretty safe.

Bianca felt her chances of winning were getting better, especially with so many execs on her side. Even though some hadn't spoken up yet, she was confident she'd win them over eventually.

"Isabella, I think they're right. We're sisters, after all. I won't let you stay as CEO once I'm chairwoman, but I'll give you another position. How about the PR department? It suits your image since you used to design packaging. Working in PR would be a good fit for you," Bianca said with a smug smile.

Isabella snorted, "I really appreciate your generosity."

"Don't be so formal, Isabella. We're sisters. How about a supervisory role? It's not a manager position, but with your skills, you could get there in a few years." Bianca finally showed her true colors, just to get under Isabella's skin.

Isabella stared at Bianca without a word. Just then, her phone buzzed. She glanced at the message and a playful smile spread across her face.

"Alright, enough games. Let's get to the point. I seriously doubt the public funds you have are the ones my father embezzled," Isabella said, crossing her arms and giving John a cold smile.

John, looking annoyed, furrowed his brow and said, "How many times do I have to say it? Your father's body is abroad. If you're not too busy, go check it out yourself."

Isabella shook her head. "No need for that. Who told you my father is dead? He's in the hospital. He did get caught in a gang conflict a few days ago, but I had a private detective bring him back."

As soon as Isabella said that, John's face went white as a sheet, and the execs looked shocked.

A smile crept onto Carol's lips. She knew Isabella wouldn't lie about this, sealing their victory.

"Impossible! John's men confirmed your father was dead! Did you hire actors to impersonate him?" Bianca screamed, unable to believe it.

Isabella looked at John's dark expression and sneered. "The private detective told me everything. Your men got beaten by the three major families and set off a bomb in desperation, trying to take them down with them. But my father was hiding in the least affected area, so the detective managed to sneak him out while everyone was fleeing."

###chapter 333 The Police's Entrance

After Isabella finished talking, the execs looked like they'd just swallowed a lemon.

If what Isabella said was true, then Jasper must have been in her hands by now. As long as Jasper said that the money John had wasn't embezzled public funds, then John and Bianca were gonna be the laughingstock today.

John's face turned dark as a storm cloud. He clenched his fists so tight his knuckles went white, glaring at Isabella like he wanted to tear her apart.

Today, John lied to Isabella for the first time. If this lie got exposed, he would lose all his credibility.

"No way, I don't believe my people would lie to me. What proof do you have that your dad's in the hospital?" John gritted his teeth and asked Isabella.

Isabella coldly clapped her hands and called towards the door, "Officer Pena, could you come in, please?"

All eyes turned to the big door. It swung open, and in walked Brenda, decked out in her police uniform.

Brenda's gaze swept around the room, ignoring John's dark look and Bianca's pale face. She said seriously, "I'm here today on behalf of the police department to award Isabella a medal and to back up her story."

Brenda held up a medal and smiled at everyone in the room, saying, "The police department really appreciates Isabella for spending a lot of money to bring back Jasper, a wanted criminal, from abroad. The chief sent me to thank her and clear up the rumors about Jasper's death."

After Brenda finished, she pulled out her tablet and played a video.

The video showed Jasper lying in a hospital bed. He looked a bit pale, but he was definitely breathing.

"This is a video call between me and my colleague, who's now watching over Jasper in the hospital. We believe there's no way he's getting away this time." Brenda finished and turned off her tablet, looking at the senior execs.

Isabella looked at John and Bianca, smiling, "Didn't you say my dad told you about the hidden public funds before he died? Well, guess what? He's still alive."

Bianca's face went even paler.

Isabella glanced at the senior execs who had just backed Bianca. Some of them looked down, while others still clung to hope.

"Mr. Williams just got your dad's situation wrong. Even so, it doesn't prove that the money in Ms. Taylor's hands isn't the public funds your father hid!" Some senior execs still argued, trying to defend John.

But just then, someone in a bank uniform walked in.

John's face changed when he saw the newcomer.

"Mr. Claire, please share your information," Isabella said to the newcomer, Paul Claire, with a smile.

Paul nodded, holding a laptop.

"Just yesterday, a sum of money went missing from Mr. Williams' account. It was transferred through multiple foreign banks and ended up in Ms. Taylor's account. Here are the transfer records we investigated and testimonies from other banks." Paul opened the laptop and showed the evidence he had.

Everyone in the room was stunned to see Paul daring to cross John. John's face twisted with anger and a touch of bitterness.

"Did my grandfather send you here?" John asked Paul.

John knew Paul; he worked at the Williams Family bank and was one of Mason's most trusted people.

Paul nodded and said calmly, "Mr. Mason Williams said that you, Mr. John Williams, have broken the terms of your agreement. He's very disappointed in you."

John slumped in his chair, his whole plan falling apart.

Bianca looked from the defeated John to Isabella.

"Even so, have you really won?" Bianca pointed at Isabella, her eyes flashing with hatred.

Isabella's face twisted into a mocking smile. "Don't you feel like you've lost now?"

Bianca glared at Isabella coldly. "Your company has taken huge financial hits. Without that embezzled money, it's on the brink of bankruptcy. Look at your father's condition; he probably won't wake up. Even if he does, would he really be willing to hand over the money to you?"

Some of the senior execs started to look serious, realizing the company's dire situation. Even though Isabella had removed a bunch of harmful people and confiscated their illegal gains, it didn't solve the company's current crisis because Jasper had embezzled the most money.

Carol looked at Isabella, trying to read her expression. But Isabella remained calm.

"Bianca, your biggest mistake was overestimating yourself and underestimating me. Do you really think I don't know where my father's hidden funds are?" Isabella's mouth curled into a cold smile.

"Officer Pena, are the things I asked for ready?" Isabella suddenly looked at Brenda and asked.

Brenda nodded. "We've identified everything, and all the evidence is now downstairs in your company."

Isabella waved to the people in the conference room. "Now, everyone, look out the window and witness something shocking."

The execs, confused, went to the window. When they saw the six cars parked below, they were all stunned.

In the sunlight, six cars emitting a golden glow were parked under the company building, surrounded by police officers.

"Are those cars made of gold?" Carol was also shocked by the scene below. She had guessed that Isabella might have Jasper's embezzled money, but she didn't expect it to be presented this way. It was truly shocking.

After seeing the golden cars, Bianca's face turned pale. "How is this possible? Those cars must be fake."

Brenda calmly said, "Ms. Taylor, after our assessment, all these cars are made of gold. And we found a lot of Jasper's DNA inside the cars."

###chapter 334 Shocking Events

Brenda's words hit everyone like a bombshell. The cops confirmed that the golden cars were bought with Jasper's embezzled funds. With the current gold prices, the cars not only cover the stolen money but also leave a surplus.

Bianca slumped in her chair, looking defeated, while John wasn't faring any better.

Isabella stood there, arms crossed, giving John and Bianca a smug look. She was the real winner here.

Isabella's gaze swept over the room.

Those who had backed Bianca earlier were now slumped in their chairs, realizing they'd completely crossed Isabella. They were looking at either getting fired or even facing jail time for embezzlement.

Isabella turned to John and said, "Sure, the gold covers the public funds, but it takes time to cash it out. I've already talked to Mason and mortgaged the gold to him to pay off the funds. This doesn't break the bet between you and your grandpa, right?"

John glared at Isabella, slammed the table, and stormed out.

He was too embarrassed to stick around. He'd lost this round and now had to give up a tenth of his assets to Mason.

"Wait up, John. I'll come with you," Bianca said, getting up to follow him.

But just as they reached the door, Isabella stopped them.

"Why the rush? I'm not done yet. There's more drama to come," Isabella said with a cold smile.

Bianca felt a bad vibe. "Enough, Isabella. Have you humiliated us enough? John is Mason's grandson. Don't push it," she said, looking gloomy.

John also thought Isabella was trying to make more fun of him, and his face darkened.

But Isabella shook her head, "No, I'm not here to humiliate you. I need to talk to Bianca."

The company execs were all curious, especially Carol, who looked intrigued.

Even Brenda was curious. She'd achieved her goal for today but was eager to see the family's internal drama.

Bianca's sense of doom grew stronger. She screamed and tried to push Isabella. "Enough, Isabella! I won't take your humiliation anymore! Let's go, John."

Bianca opened the door, only to be stopped by a stern-faced Benjamin.

Seeing Benjamin, Bianca felt like she'd been struck by lightning. She guessed Isabella's plan, remembering Benjamin had been investigating her illness.

John knew Benjamin too. He was friends with Michael and had performed Bianca's kidney transplant surgery last time.

"Dr. White, what are you doing here? Did my uncle send you?" John frowned, thinking Benjamin was here on Michael's orders to back up Isabella.

Benjamin nodded and smiled. "Yep, your uncle sent me, but not to speak for Isabella. I'm here to talk about something concerning Bianca."

"We have nothing to talk about!" Bianca suddenly screamed, trying to pull John away, but the bodyguard behind Benjamin stopped her.

Benjamin pointed to the conference room and said with a smile, "Mr. Williams, why don't we sit down and talk? It's rude to leave me standing here."

John sensed something was off. He looked at Bianca and saw her trembling with fear. He took a deep breath, feeling that something big was about to go down.

"Alright, let's hear what you have to say," John said, heading back to the conference room and sitting down. Bianca's legs were shaking so much that she almost fell off her chair.

Bianca thought, 'Is Benjamin going to talk about that? Does he have proof? No way, it must be fake.' She prayed silently, but Benjamin's next words shattered her hopes.

Benjamin held up two diagnostic reports. "These are Ms. Taylor's health reports. One is from her hospitalization, the other is recent. It's unbelievable-Ms. Taylor was a severe uremia patient, but now she's recovered to a normal level. This defies medical logic!"

"What are you trying to say? Are you suggesting I was faking my illness? I've told you, I met a medical expert, took the medicine he gave me, and that's why I recovered so quickly," Bianca argued.

Benjamin looked at her coldly. "There's no medicine in the world that can make a uremia patient who just had a kidney transplant recover to normal in a week," he said.

Bianca grew more frightened, noticing the suspicion in John's eyes.

Benjamin then produced a second report. He held it up and said, "There were rumors that Ms. Taylor and Isabella were a match for kidney donation, but our tests show their kidneys don't match at all. If Ms. Taylor really had Isabella's kidney transplanted into her, it would be fatal."

Everyone in the room seemed to realize something, some looking at Bianca in shock.

Carol couldn't help but ask, "Bianca, were you trying to get Isabella's kidney?"

Bianca stayed silent.

Isabella sneered. "She doesn't just want my kidney, she wants my life! Bianca has been pretending to be a uremia patient and has mentioned in front of John more than once that she needs my kidney to survive. John even told me that if I donated my kidney to Bianca, he would agree to marry me! After I refused, they even tried to kidnap me and take my kidney by force."

###chapter 335 Shocking Story

After Isabella finished talking, the room practically buzzed with tension.

The execs who had pissed off Isabella were sweating bullets about their futures, but after hearing such a shocking story, their attention was completely diverted!

Carol gasped, finally getting why Isabella had said she'd faced death more than once. She was betrayed by her lover and sister, who even tried to steal her kidney and kill her. Insane!

"No wonder Isabella dumped Mr. Williams before. With a story like that, who could blame her?" Paul muttered, still in shock.

Paul had planned to leave after nailing John for his violations, but his curiosity kept him glued to the spot. He never expected to hear such explosive news.

Brenda was floored too. She'd been hoping for some juicy gossip, but this was way more intense. As a cop, it made sense to arrest a kidnapper and would-be murderer.

Brenda's eyes locked onto Bianca, making sure she didn't bolt.

"If you don't believe me, I've got proof," Isabella said with a cold smirk, lifting her shirt just enough to show a scar on her stomach.

"John, check out this scar. The doctor was out to kill me. A simple surgery turned into a bloodbath. If Benjamin hadn't kicked the doctor out, I'd be dead," Isabella said, glaring at John with pure hatred.

John stared at the scar, then turned to Bianca, his disbelief clear.

"Is she telling the truth?" John asked Bianca, his voice shaky.

"No, she's lying! None of this is true. John, you have to believe me," Bianca pleaded, clutching his hand and defending herself desperately.

Benjamin looked at John and said calmly, "Mr. Williams, I can back up everything Isabella said. You brought me in to ensure the surgery's success, but I was sidelined almost immediately. I could only watch until Isabella was in critical condition, then I had to step in and stop it."

John's doubt grew as he looked at Bianca, despite her frantic denials.

Isabella's gaze was icy. "An heir to a big family, fooled by a woman like an idiot. I've told you more than once that my kidney isn't a match for Bianca's, but you never believed me. You thought I was trying to mess up your relationship. Well, today, everyone's here to see the truth. So, Mr. Williams, let's do another matching test for me and Bianca."

"Enough, Isabella! What are you trying to do? Why are you slandering me like this? All your so-called evidence is fake. I don't know why you're making this up, but if you think you can hurt me with these lies, you're dreaming," Bianca shouted, pointing at Isabella.

Isabella stayed silent, just staring at John.

Everyone's eyes were glued to John, waiting to see what he'd do next.

Under all that pressure, John took a deep breath and dialed a number on his phone.

"Get my medical team here ASAP. I want to test the kidneys of Bianca and Isabella," he said before hanging up.

Bianca went pale and took a step back. "John, you don't believe me anymore?"

John looked at her with a cold expression. "Does it even matter if I believe you now? The test results will show who's telling the truth."

Bianca's face turned ghostly white; she knew she was in deep trouble.

Just then, Benjamin chimed in.

"While we wait for the medical team, let's chat about something else," Benjamin said with a smile, clapping his hands.

Soon, a bunch of medical staff in uniforms were escorted in by bodyguards. Bianca's eyes filled with despair when she saw them.

John thought these medical staff looked familiar.

Pointing at them, Benjamin grinned at John, "Look familiar? These are the folks who diagnosed and treated Bianca. All those medical reports you saw? They came from these guys. Guess how much Bianca paid them?"

As soon as Benjamin finished, one of the medical staff broke down crying.

"Mr. Williams, we were forced by Bianca. She said if we didn't do what she wanted, she'd ruin us with her connections."

"Yeah, Mr. Williams, Bianca used your favor to make us do things we didn't want to. We had no choice."

"Mr. Williams, we messed up, but Bianca was the mastermind."

Bianca shook with anger. The people who once sucked up to her were now throwing her under the bus.

At this point, Isabella pulled out another piece of evidence-a USB drive. She had someone plug it into a computer and play it on the big screen.

The screen showed Bianca casually shopping.

"The time this video was taken matches Bianca's supposed kidney surgery at Lumaria. More importantly, it was her first day off the plane, and she went shopping. Does she look like a uremic patient to you?" Isabella pointed at the screen, laughing coldly.

The screen showed not only photos of Bianca shopping but also a police report about her phone getting stolen during the shopping trip, leading to a dispute with the thief. The police body camera clearly captured Bianca's face.

After watching all this, John fell silent, not even glancing at Bianca.

Bianca didn't dare look at John either.

The room was dead silent. After a while, John turned to Brenda.

"Officer, since Isabella accuses Bianca and me of harming her, let's head to the police station and sort this out," John said, standing up and walking to the door without looking back at Bianca.

###chapter 336 Isabella's Reminder

Bianca's face was ghostly white; she knew she'd completely blown it with John.

She felt like checking the kidney match was more like a death countdown.

Brenda walked up to Bianca and pulled out some handcuffs. "Ms. Taylor, hands out, please."

Shaking and pale, Bianca put her hands out. She needed to get out of there fast, feeling the stares of everyone around her like they were ripping her apart.

Bianca needed to bolt, even if it meant going to the police station. John was thinking the same thing. Everyone knew it, but no one was saying it out loud. They figured John would be out of the station soon enough.

Once Bianca was cuffed, Brenda told her colleagues to take her downstairs. Benjamin and the medical staff, who were also heading down, needed to go to the station for questioning as participants and witnesses.

After Bianca was gone, Brenda looked at Isabella with a wry smile. "Ms. Taylor, you really caught me off guard."

Isabella grinned. "Officer Pena, you must be thrilled about nabbing a bunch of troublemakers, right?"

Isabella's words made Brenda smile bitterly again.

"John will be fine. I bet he'll just sit there, waiting for his lawyer at the station," Brenda said, shrugging.

Isabella just smiled and kept quiet. Some things were better left unsaid; they both got it.

"So, Isabella. As a victim and witness, I need you to come with me to the station," Brenda said.

Isabella nodded. "Sure, but Officer Pena, give me a sec. I need to talk to someone."

"Okay, I'll wait for you downstairs," Brenda said, then turned and left the room.

Isabella turned to Paul, "Mr. Claire, please keep Mason in the dark about what Bianca and John did to me. His health isn't great, and I don't want to upset him."

Paul nodded. "Don't worry, Isabella, I won't tell Mr. Williams."

Even without Isabella's reminder, Paul wouldn't spill the beans.

Last time John landed Mason in the hospital just for mouthing off to him. Paul would tell Charles at most, at least Charles looked tougher than Mason.

Paul left the room, and Isabella then looked at the company execs.

Those who met Isabella's gaze felt their hearts skip a beat, while the innocent stayed calm.

"I'll give you one last chance. If you embezzled funds, return the money and resign, and I'll pretend this never happened. If not, I'll send you to the cops," Isabella said before leaving the room.

Carol shot a mocking glance at the grumpy executives before standing up and leaving the room.

While Isabella and the others were on their way to the police station, Paul filled Charles in on what had gone down, including how Bianca and John almost hurt Isabella.

Charles was stunned by the news.

Paul sighed into his phone. "I had to tell you first because I was worried Mr. Williams might end up in the hospital again. But there were a lot of people there, and I can't promise this won't leak to the media."

Charles agreed. "You're right, Mr. Mason Williams must not find out about this. I'll get in touch with Mr. Michael Williams now to help manage the media and the police, warning them to keep this under wraps."

With that, Charles hung up. He had to handle this quickly because once the three major families got wind of it, they'd spread it everywhere.

Meanwhile, on the way to the police station, Isabella called Michael.

"Sweetheart, we did it," Isabella said, her voice full of joy.

"Congrats, honey, you finally did it," Michael's tone was as gentle as ever.

Isabella recounted the day's events to Michael, from entering the meeting room to Bianca being taken away by the cops. She even cried at the end.

"Sweetheart, do you know how long I've been waiting for this day?" Isabella sobbed.

Michael comforted her softly over the phone, "I knew you'd win today. You took down John and Bianca, and now Bianca will face the law. Okay, stop crying now. When you get back tonight, let's celebrate with a big dinner. You're heading to the police station next; you can't let them see a crying CEO."

"Okay, dear, make sure you clean yourself up when I get back," Isabella joked before quickly hanging up.

Michael's breathing quickened. If he was right, tonight would be the most passionate night between him and Isabella.

"Darn it, I only planned to hold out for two weeks, and now it's been almost a month. I've almost finished all those pills. I can finally enjoy myself without holding back," Michael grinned.

But his smile quickly faded. Rationally, he knew it wasn't time to celebrate and let loose just yet. He had other things to handle.

Michael always remembered there was another force behind Bianca. Now that she was arrested, that force would surely make a move. This time, he had to expose those lurking in the shadows.

Just as Michael was plotting his next steps, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen and was surprised to see Charles calling.

###chapter 337 Charles's Concern

Michael picked up Charles' call and asked what was going on.

Charles, sounding serious, filled Michael in on how John and Bianca had set up Isabella.

To Charles' surprise, Michael stayed cool as a cucumber.

"Mr. Williams, did you already know about this?" Charles asked, shocked.

Michael didn't beat around the bush and nodded. "Yeah, I knew for a while, but I didn't tell Mason because I didn't want to stress him out."

Charles let out a sigh. "Got it. Please handle this and keep it on the down-low. We don't want the other families finding out."

Michael agreed to take care of it.

"Isabella probably didn't want this to blow up. If she did, she would've told Mason herself, and we wouldn't be in this mess," Michael sighed, then made another call to get things under control.

He told Jerry and Mike to keep a close eye on the police station and Isabella's company, thinking those were the hotspots for trouble.

There were always spies from the big families at the police station. News of Bianca and John being taken in would spread fast. The goal was to squash it before the spies got wind of it.

Even though Isabella had told Michael that only Officer Brenda was in the meeting room at the time, and the other officers just followed her orders without knowing what was up, Michael wasn't fully convinced Brenda could keep it all under wraps.

As for the higher-ups at Isabella's company, they were even sketchier.

The ones who stayed on were more likely to keep quiet to stay on Isabella's good side. But those about to get the boot might spill the beans to the other big families out of spite.

Who wanted Mason gone the most? Definitely the other three big families. If Mason went down, the Williams Family would lose its backbone, making it easier for them to strike.

While Michael was setting things in motion, Isabella finally got to the police station.

When she arrived, she found out John hadn't said a word in the interrogation room.

Just like Brenda guessed, John's first words at the station were, "I want my lawyer."

Hearing this, Isabella just shook her head and smiled, not too worried.

Given John's status, even with solid evidence, arresting him wouldn't be a walk in the park. But having Bianca under control was a win.

As a witness, Isabella was questioned by Brenda. She told Brenda to keep it hush-hush and not to tell her colleagues.

Brenda nodded, getting the picture. "Don't worry, I'm not that naive. A lot of people still don't know why Bianca and John were arrested. If the other three major families catch wind of this, they might use it against Mason. If Mason gets hurt, the Williams Family won't let it slide, and we could see riots in the city."

Brenda sighed, sometimes thinking the city would be better off without the four major families.

Isabella was pleased with Brenda's approach and started explaining how Bianca and John had set her up.

The interrogation didn't take long. When Isabella stepped out, she saw John getting into a car and leaving.

Brenda frowned. Even with John's influence, he shouldn't have been released so quickly; something was up.

Brenda quickly asked who had interrogated John and was shocked to find out it was the police chief, Alan.

"Isabella, wait here. I'm going to talk to Mr. Savage," Brenda said before storming into Alan's office.

"Alan, I need an explanation. Why did you let John go? He's still a suspect, isn't he?" Brenda demanded, glaring at Alan.

Alan barely looked at her and waved dismissively. "The evidence you have only ties Bianca to faking illness, bribing medical staff, and trying to take Isabella's kidney. None of it links John to these actions."

Brenda was almost laughing in disbelief. "Alan, are you serious? Without John's go-ahead, would Bianca have the guts to harm Isabella?"

Alan sighed, "Let me repeat, you have no evidence."

Brenda coldly asked, "Just tell me, what did John give you in return?"

Alan slammed the table in anger. "Do you think I'm corrupt? How many times do I have to say it? Unless Bianca accuses John of ordering her, you'll never catch him!"

Brenda stared at Alan, then turned and left, fuming.

Alan wasn't wrong. The evidence Brenda had wasn't enough to nail John. She was frustrated, imagining herself in Isabella's shoes-betrayed by her lover and sister, nearly dying on the operating table. The despair was overwhelming.

When Brenda saw Isabella again, she apologized, "I'm sorry I couldn't keep John here."

Isabella had expected this and smiled, "Is it because of insufficient evidence?"

Brenda nodded silently.

Isabella hugged Brenda. "Thank you, Officer Pena. I knew this might happen. Don't blame yourself. You're a good cop, just born in the wrong era."

###chapter 338 John's Regret

Isabella gave Brenda a comforting hug before heading out of the police station.

Even though Isabella wasn't part of the interrogation, she had a pretty good idea of what John had told Alan.

John probably spun a tale about being duped by Bianca, which led him to use the marriage card to pressure Isabella into donating a kidney to Bianca. Sure, it was shady, but not illegal since Isabella had the right to say no.

John flat-out denied Isabella's accusations that he and Bianca had kidnapped her and forcibly taken her kidney. After all, all the medical staff were bought by Bianca, so John played dumb. He just had to claim Bianca told him they found a perfect donor, which was why he got Benjamin to do the surgery, not realizing he was walking into Bianca's trap.

After leaving the station, John sat in his car, looking grim and staying silent.

Then, out of nowhere, his phone rang. It was one of his guys.

"Mr. Williams, the medical team you asked for is outside the station. Should we still test Ms. Taylor?" the guy asked, sounding pretty nervous.

The guy was thinking, 'Great, why do I have to make this call? Don't these idiots know Mr. Williams is pissed right now? I'm probably gonna get chewed out.' He shot a glare at the others.

John was about to yell at that guy to get lost and stop bugging him, but he stopped himself and took a deep breath.

"Since they're already there, go ahead and do the test," John said, then hung up.

After the call, John stared out the window, feeling drained. The anger was gone, replaced by a deep sadness.

He remembered all the times Isabella had called him an idiot. Maybe she was right; maybe he really was an idiot in some ways.

"If it had been Isabella from the start, would things be different?" John muttered to himself.

He thought about everything Isabella had done for him over the past eight years. She always made his favorite dishes and supported him no matter what.

And how did he repay her? By constantly hurting her and ignoring all her efforts. He'd hurt her so many times over those eight years.

John had to admit he felt a weird sense of guilt towards Isabella now. He felt remorse.

"Do I still have a chance?" John whispered, like he was talking in his sleep.

Meanwhile, Brenda was already grilling Bianca back at the station.

There was no need to tread lightly with Bianca like with John, especially since John had lost trust in her. Plus, Brenda and her team had gathered solid evidence of Bianca's crimes.

"Bianca, how long are you gonna keep quiet? All the evidence points to you trying to hurt Isabella. Even John's not backing you anymore. You might as well come clean and try to get a better deal," Brenda said, slamming the table and glaring at Bianca.

Bianca sat there, head down, pale as a ghost, her hands cuffed and fingers tightly intertwined, showing just how scared she was.

Up until now, Bianca felt like she was living a nightmare. Just yesterday, she was dreaming about becoming the head of the family, marrying John, and getting everyone's blessings while crushing Isabella.

But overnight, those dreams went up in smoke.

Instead of stepping on Isabella, Bianca found herself in the police station because of the evidence Isabella had on her. Now, she was looking at legal trouble and probably prison time.

Bianca couldn't handle the thought of prison. Unlike last time, when John had her back and the other inmates left her alone despite hating her, this time was different. John was done with her, and she might not make it out alive.

And she hadn't forgotten about the car bomb incident she and John went through. She suspected Paxton was behind it. If Paxton still had it out for her, she might end up like Pearl in prison.

Just thinking about Pearl's fate made Bianca shiver with fear.

"I need to make a call," Bianca finally said.

Brenda frowned. "No one can save you now. Not even John."

Bianca stared at Brenda, her eyes bloodshot and a hint of madness in her expression. "I said I need to make a call now, or I won't say anything."

Brenda narrowed her eyes, then left the room.

After a few rings, someone picked up, and a man's voice came through. "How's everything going? You should be the CEO by now!"

The guy chuckled, but then he realized something was off because Bianca stayed silent.

"What's going on?" he asked, his voice getting serious.

Bianca took a deep breath, her voice shaking. "I lost. Isabella found Jasper and the embezzled funds he hid. Worse, she has all the evidence of my fake illness. I'm locked up on murder charges, and John doesn't believe me anymore. You have to help me, you're my only hope."

As soon as she finished, the guy on the phone blew up.

"So you're calling me from the police station? Are you an idiot? Your call could be tapped. You're putting me in danger, you fool!" he yelled.

"Don't forget we're in this together. If you don't help me, I'll spill everything you've done," Bianca threatened, her teeth clenched.

There was a pause on the other end before he said, "Give me some time, I'll take care of it."

###chapter 339 Don't Celebrate Too Soon

The guy hung up right after saying that, and when Bianca tried calling back, it just wouldn't go through.

Now, Bianca had no choice but to rely on him.

As soon as Bianca ended the call, Brenda walked in.

"Done with the call? Can we talk about what's next now?" Brenda asked.

Bianca took a deep breath and looked at Brenda. "I'm not owning up to anything yet because I believe I can get out of this."

Brenda chuckled, clearly annoyed, and gave Bianca a cold stare. "I really don't get what you're holding on to. Do you think anyone other than John will save you?"

Bianca just snorted and stayed quiet.

Brenda snatched the phone from Bianca's hand and sat back down. She'd dealt with plenty of criminals who refused to admit their mistakes, and she was sure she'd get Bianca to talk.

Just as Brenda was about to keep questioning her, someone walked in and whispered something in her ear.

Brenda frowned a bit. "Even now, John still can't believe it?"

When Bianca heard John's name, she looked up, a flicker of hope in her eyes.

Seeing Bianca's expression, Brenda immediately knew what she was thinking.

"Bianca, don't get your hopes up. John's not here to save you. Remember what he said about the medical team? He's here to see if you're a match for Isabella's kidney donation," Brenda said, crushing Bianca's hope.

Of course, Bianca knew she wasn't a match for Isabella's kidney. John was just here for answers.

"Can I refuse this test?" Bianca asked, a bitter smile on her pale face.

Brenda looked at Bianca, her eyes showing no sympathy. Despite Bianca's meek appearance, anyone who knew her deeds would see her as malicious.

Brenda shook her head coldly. "You know you can't refuse, and neither can I."

Brenda stood up, opened the door to the interrogation room, and the medical team outside came in to collect samples from Bianca.

Bianca didn't resist; she knew it was pointless. She was like a puppet, letting the medical staff run their tests and then watching them leave with the samples.

After the medical staff left, Brenda asked Bianca again, "Do you want to talk now or wait for the test results?"

A faint smile appeared on Bianca's pale face. "Let's wait for the test results."

"Testing my patience, huh? Fine, we'll wait," Brenda snorted and stood up from her chair. If Bianca wanted to wait for the test results, she didn't mind waiting another day.

Meanwhile, Michael was busy in the kitchen. He was about to celebrate with Isabella today, so he bought a bunch of fresh ingredients to whip up a feast.

Just then, Michael's phone rang. He glanced at the screen and saw it was Mike calling.

Michael picked up, and Mike immediately shared some good news.

"Mr. Williams, Bianca made a call. The number's owner has been dead for years, but we're tracking the signal and should have results soon," Mike said, sounding excited.

Michael rolled his eyes. "You know which characters mess up the most in movies?"

Mike, confused, asked, "I don't know. Mr. Williams, you know I don't watch movies much."

Michael rolled his eyes again and placed a king crab into the steamer. "According to movie logic, don't celebrate before you have results. Being too happy too early leads to bad outcomes! Do you get it? You haven't even tracked down where they are, and you're already giving me good news? So the biggest possibility is that you either find nothing or the results you get are wrong."

"Never heard of this," Mike replied, shocked.

Michael sneered, "If you don't believe it, let's see."

With that, Michael hung up the phone. He had a feeling things wouldn't go smoothly this time.

Sure enough, when Mike and his team rushed to the address where the signal was coming from, they found it was Bianca's parents' house.

And they discovered that Bianca's father, Dexter Taylor, had just committed suicide by shooting himself. Next to him was the phone used to call Bianca.

"Damn it, we're late again!" Mike almost jumped in anger.

Last time, they were late, and the journalist was killed, finding nothing. This time was the same. Although the evidence pointed to Dexter's death as a suicide, Mike and his team suspected there was more to the story.

Mike took a deep breath, opened Dexter's phone, and played a video inside.

The video seemed to have just been recorded, with Dexter still alive but looking very solemn.

"Bianca, my daughter. As a father, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have forced you to do things you didn't want to do. It's ridiculous to think about it now. Since Jasper got the family inheritance, I've been jealous and wanted everything back. I made you fake illness to frame your sister and used my authority as your father to threaten you. I know you won't forgive me no matter what I say. I just hope this video before my death can help you. Goodbye, my dear daughter, I hope you and your mother can live well."

The video ended with Dexter's confession and him putting the gun in his mouth.

Mike narrowed his eyes, ready to delete the video. It would greatly help Bianca and reduce her guilt, which Michael didn't want.

But at that moment, the door was kicked open, and a group of police officers rushed in.

###chapter 340 Bad News and Warnings

Since Bianca hadn't spilled the beans yet and it was going to take a while to grill her, she was tossed into the police station's holding cell for now.

Bianca looked totally worn out in there. She'd been in this place before, but this time was a whole different ball game.

This time, no cops were giving her any special treatment, and she wasn't in a private cell. Instead, she got thrown into a grimy cell next to a bunch of scruffy, stinky women.

These women seemed like they were all in it together. One of them eyed Bianca's fancy clothes with a mix of greed and mockery.

"Thought this place was just for us poor folks. Didn't expect to see a rich girl in here," one woman sneered.

Bianca gritted her teeth but decided to keep quiet. These women were way tougher than her; she couldn't take them on.

But her silence just made them bolder.

They surrounded her, yanking at her clothes and making snide comments.

"Check out this outfit. Top-notch fabric. If I wore this while working, I could easily charge an extra $200."

"I saw this in a high-end store once. If it's the real deal, it could cover your expenses for a year."

"Did you get busted like us? Where do you work? Who sent you? Maybe we know them."

Bianca couldn't take it anymore and snapped, sitting up and shouting.

"Enough, you bitches! I'm not like you, I'm not a hooker! I'm just here for a bit, and I'll be out soon! Stay away from me, or you'll regret it when I get out," she yelled fiercely.

But her outburst just made them more daring.

"If you're so important, how'd you end up here?" One woman slapped her across the face.

Fuming, Bianca clenched her fists but didn't dare to fight back.

"Look at you, probably some rich guy's side piece, sent in by his wife? You're no different from us, just a high-class hooker," one woman sneered, her eyes scanning Bianca's body.

"What's so special about your fancy body? Let's strip her," they said, closing in and tugging at her clothes.

"Stop it, you damn bitches!" Bianca screamed in terror.

Just then, the cops finally showed up.

"What the hell are you doing? Break it up!" A female officer swung her baton, hitting those hookers.

Feeling the sting, they quickly let go of Bianca and backed off.

Bianca clutched her chest in fear, her clothes already torn in several places, showing her delicate skin.

The female officer looked at her with indifference and said, "Come with me, we need to talk."

Bianca looked up at the officer, a flicker of hope in her eyes. "Is someone coming to bail me out?"

The officer shook her head. "You're suspected of murder, not exactly something you can bail out of. I need to talk to you about something else-your father has passed away."

Bianca stood there, frozen in shock.

In the interrogation room, Bianca clutched the phone, watching the video Dexter recorded before he died. Her hands shook, and tears streamed down her face.

Brenda stood across from her, arms crossed, her face a mask of indifference. Dexter's video pinned all the blame on him, making it seem like he was the mastermind and Bianca was just a pawn. But Brenda's gut told her it wasn't that simple.

"Your father said he forced you into all this. Is that true?" Brenda asked.

Bianca just sobbed, unable to get any words out.

Brenda opened her mouth, then closed it, feeling a twinge of helplessness. Despite her disdain for the girl who had just lost her father, she knew she had to show some basic decency.

Brenda didn't know all the details, but Bianca did. It had to be that man's doing.

Dexter, Bianca's father, knew she was faking being sick, but it wasn't like the video made it seem. It was all Bianca's own idea.

At the end of the video, Dexter mentioned hoping Bianca and her mother would live well, which was actually a warning from that man. If Bianca dared to threaten him further, he would make sure she and her mother joined him in death.

With a choked voice, Bianca asked Brenda, "Where's my mom now?"

Brenda shook her head and sighed, "We haven't found her. Neighbors said she seemed to have lost it, muttering strange things, then ran off towards the outskirts. We think she saw your father's suicide and it messed her up. We're looking for her."

Bianca let out a bitter laugh, which grew louder until she fainted.

"Damn it, get help!" Brenda shouted, calling for assistance to take Bianca to the hospital.

Meanwhile, John's medical team was running tests on Bianca's samples for a kidney donation.

The team already knew why John wanted the samples. From Bianca's reaction, it was clear the kidneys wouldn't match, so they were just going through the motions. No one was really paying attention.

But when Bianca's test results came back, the medical team was floored.

Meanwhile, after leaving the police station, John didn't head back to the vineyard. Instead, he went straight to a bar, drinking with a bunch of people to drown his sorrows.

Just as John felt himself slipping into unconsciousness, he got a call from the medical team.

"Mr. Williams, our tests show Bianca's and Isabella's kidneys don't match, but we found something unusual in Bianca's blood sample-she's likely pregnant," the head of the medical team said.

John was stunned, the glass slipping from his hand and shattering on the ground.

###chapter 341 You Are My Food

Isabella had no clue that Bianca was pregnant. If she did, she would've probably rolled her eyes and muttered, "That sneaky woman always lands on her feet."

After leaving the police station, Isabella headed back to the company. She'd just snagged all the shares and now had to hold a meeting with a few top execs. The rest were scrambling to gather funds to cover the public money.

Isabella couldn't care less about the panicked execs; she was only interested in those still backing her.

She strolled into the meeting room and scanned the few faces there. According to Carol's info, these folks were all clean.

"Thanks for sticking with me. I'll bust my butt for the company's growth, and I hope you will too," Isabella said, flashing a smile as she took her seat at the head of the table.

The others nodded politely.

Carol had a slight smile. She figured Isabella's next move would be to reward her.

"Ms. Lester has been a huge help in grabbing all the shares and taking down Bianca and John. With many top execs recently let go, we need to fill those spots fast. So, Ms. Lester is now head of HR and gets 10% of the shares. No objections, right?" Isabella's words left everyone stunned.

When Jasper was in charge, he never even thought about sharing shares with the top execs.

Carol was taken aback too. She knew Isabella would thank her, but she didn't expect to be the first and get such a generous reward.

Isabella looked at Carol and smiled, "Ms. Lester, as head of HR, you've got more on your plate now. With all the staff cuts, we need you to hustle and find new talent."

Carol shrugged with a wry smile, glancing at the empty seats. "Looks like I'll be burning the midnight oil."

Isabella grinned at her and then announced promotions and other job changes for the remaining top execs.

Among those in the room, only Carol got 10% of the shares. The others were still under Isabella's consideration.

"Even though you didn't get shares this time, don't sweat it. If you do well, I'll make sure everyone gets a piece. This company is mine, but it's also yours," Isabella said, painting a rosy picture for everyone.

The future looked bright because Isabella seemed way more generous than Jasper.

The other execs didn't envy Carol's shares.

Just like Isabella said, Carol had been a huge help. The other top execs didn't know exactly how, but they knew they only showed support for Isabella at the meeting without doing much else.

"Alright, that's a wrap for today." Isabella stood up, and the other execs filed out one by one.

In the end, only Isabella and Carol were left in the meeting room.

"You've let go of so many top execs at once. What about their teams? Are we cutting them loose too?" Carol asked, curious.

Isabella grinned and launched into a story. "Two princes were fighting for the throne. The younger one killed the older one and became king. Some folks suggested he should also get rid of the older prince's followers since they had tried to kill him.

"But the new king disagreed. He believed that if you like a house, you should also like the crows on the house. He forgave his former rivals. Hearing this, the older prince's followers were moved by the king's kindness and pledged their loyalty. They ended up creating more value for the kingdom."

Carol's face twisted into a strange smile. "So, you think those employees are like crows and should be protected too?"

Isabella chuckled, "Everyone deserves a chance. You know about how ruthless those top execs could be. How do you know their teams weren't just being forced?"

"You really are a generous queen," Carol remarked.

Isabella walked over, patted Carol's arm, and said with a smile, "Generous, yes, but not naive. If anyone is too loyal to those top execs, they're out. I don't need a ticking time bomb around me."

Carol nodded. "So, are you heading home now? Leaving all this work to me?"

Carol teased Isabella with a shrug.

Isabella smiled, "My dear husband is waiting for me at home. He's been swamped lately, so I need to reward him properly. Maybe with a fancy dinner?"

Carol was taken aback, watching Isabella leave. After a moment, she smirked.

"Her idea of dinner better not involve herself!" Carol rolled her eyes, grumbled, and then left the meeting room.

After wrapping up the company's affairs, Isabella headed home.

As soon as she walked in, she was hit with the mouth-watering aroma of food.

Michael had whipped up a lavish dinner for her.

On the table were an elegant candle holder, various gourmet dishes, and a bottle of red wine.

Michael was dressed to the nines in a sharp suit, and on the chair opposite, there was a neatly packaged evening gown waiting for Isabella.

"Darling, enjoy the food first," Michael smiled, but Isabella covered his mouth.

She suddenly rushed over, hugged Michael, and kissed him.

Michael was caught off guard by Isabella's sudden move and instinctively stepped back, almost bumping into the table.

"Darling, let's eat first. You've been hungry all day," Michael said, gently pushing Isabella away, his face now marked with her lipstick.

Isabella licked her lips, gazing seductively at Michael. "In my eyes, you are the most sumptuous feast."

Seeing the desire in Isabella's eyes, Michael shuddered. He realized he wasn't the only one feeling horny during their time apart; Isabella was equally turned on.

"Darling, let's eat first. Otherwise, we might not have the energy," Michael said, swallowing nervously.

###chapter 342 Full of Energy

They didn't end up doing it at the dinner table after all.

Like Michael said, you need a full stomach to have the energy for some fun.

Isabella slipped into a stunning evening gown, did her makeup, and sat down to enjoy dinner with Michael.

"While the execs were in the meeting, I only gave Carol a share, and the others just got easy promotions. Do you think I did the right thing, honey?" Isabella asked, sipping her red wine.

The lipstick mark on her glass looked pretty under the light.

Michael nodded and smiled, "Babe, you did fine. Even though the execs are backing you, Carol's your biggest supporter. If you gave everyone the same perks as Carol, she might feel slighted."

Isabella grinned, "That's what I thought too, but there's something else bugging me. Can you guess what it is, babe?"

Michael looked at her and smiled, "You're worried the other execs are all Carol's people. Since Carol hasn't given us any dirt on them, whether it's because there's none or she doesn't want to, we need to be careful."

Isabella nodded, "You always get me."

Suddenly, Michael felt a smooth leg rubbing against his under the table.

His breathing got heavier as he enjoyed the sensation, and he asked with a grin, "Back in the day, kings worried about their subjects teaming up against them. So, what's your plan? Are you gonna back another faction to counter Carol's group?"

Isabella shook her head, "I thought about it, but I can't let down my loyal supporters now. I'll figure it out once the company's running smoothly."

Feeling the heat rising, Michael loosened his tie and unbuttoned a couple of buttons to cool off.

"I don't think you need to worry. A strong king doesn't fear betrayal because he has the charm to win people over. And I see that charm in you," Michael's breathing got heavier, and his face started to flush.

Isabella set down her utensils, leaned forward with her hands clasped, and smiled at Michael, "So, are you ready for the queen's service now?"

Unable to hold back, Michael scooped up Isabella and headed for the bedroom.

But halfway there, Isabella nimbly jumped out of his arms.

"What are you doing? You've got me all worked up, and now you're running away?" Michael asked, frustrated.

Covering her mouth, Isabella laughed, "Alright, babe, I'm not messing with you. I'm just super tired today and all sweaty. I need a shower first. I don't want to enjoy our time together smelling like sweat."

She winked at Michael and headed to the bathroom. Soon, the sound of the shower filled the room.

As Isabella wet her hair, she heard the bathroom door creak open. She turned around and found herself wrapped in a warm embrace.

"Couldn't you wait until I finished my shower?" Isabella asked, a bit helpless.

Michael, completely naked, held her close, his hands roaming over her soft skin.

He grinned, "I haven't showered either. I figured we could save time by doing it together."

Rolling her eyes, Isabella gave a playful smile. "Are you sure you can behave in the shower?"

Michael smiled back and whispered in her ear, "I've been resting for almost a month, and now I'm full of energy."

"Really? Let's see what you've got," Isabella teased, unable to wait any longer.

Her hands slid down Michael's chest, feeling his firm muscles like they were carved from stone.

Michael shivered as Isabella's soft hands caressed his skin.

As her fingertips grazed his skin, Michael felt a tingling sensation, his breath quickening.

When Isabella's hand reached his lower abdomen and grasped his erect penis, Michael's body trembled, and he instinctively leaned against the wall as Isabella knelt and took him into her mouth.

The shower water cascaded over them, but it couldn't quench the fire burning between them.

"Babe, it seems your medicine is working wonders. You're as hard as iron," Isabella teased, looking up at Michael after releasing him.

Breathing heavily, Michael defended himself, "I've always been this hard; it's not the medicine. Those are just for keeping me healthy."

"I read online that you guys are always tough in this department," Isabella laughed and took him into her mouth again.

Feeling her tongue swirling around him, Michael felt his strength melting away.

"Babe, your tongue is amazing. Wait, did you learn this online?" Michael asked, curious.

Raising her head with a seductive smile, Isabella admitted, "Yep, I picked up a lot of tips and tricks online. So, ready for your reward?"

Michael nodded eagerly and pulled Isabella up, holding her close.

"I can't wait for my reward," he whispered in her ear.

"This is just the appetizer," Isabella said, wrapping her legs around Michael's waist and slowly sliding down, taking him inside her.

###chapter 343 The Time for Couples to Shower

They say women take about half an hour to shower, while men only need 15 minutes. So, the real question is, how long does it take for a man and a woman to shower together?

Michael thought it might take 45 minutes. But it was not just about adding up their shower times. There was also the time spent getting frisky in the bathroom.

After 45 minutes, Isabella dried off and stumbled from the bathroom to the bed. Michael followed, a towel around his waist, looking fresh as ever.

Michael grinned at Isabella and said, "What's up, babe? Can't handle just 45 minutes? I told you I've got loads of energy now."

Isabella rolled her eyes, thinking Michael had been holding back for too long. From the moment he picked her up, he had been going full throttle for the entire 45 minutes.

"You're like a wild bull," Isabella said, satisfied despite her complaint.

"So, can you handle my wild side?" Michael asked, hoping to see a hint of fear in her eyes, which would be a big ego boost for him.

But Isabella didn't show any fear. Instead, she gave him a provocative look.

"Did you forget about the reward? What happened in the bathroom was just the warm-up. The main event is just starting." Isabella stood up and pulled a blindfold from the drawer.

"Are you planning to blindfold me for a surprise?" Michael asked, curious.

Isabella nodded and placed the blindfold over Michael's eyes. "Lie down, and I'll give you a surprise."

Guided by Isabella, Michael lay down on the bed. Soon, he heard the sound of clothes rustling near his ear.

"Are you planning to leave me blindfolded and run away?" Michael joked.

"I'm not that boring. Do you really think you've beaten me?" Isabella's teasing tone grew stronger.

Michael waited quietly, eager for the surprise Isabella had in store.

"Okay, you can take off the blindfold now." Isabella's voice reached Michael's ears.

As Michael removed the blindfold, his eyes widened at the sight of Isabella. She wore transparent black lace lingerie that clung to her delicate skin seductively. Her breasts, with faintly visible pink nipples, and the fabric covering her lower body all hinted at what lay beneath. With black eyeliner and red lipstick, Isabella looked like a temptress, a far cry from her usual innocent self.

Swallowing hard, Michael sat up on the bed, exclaiming, "Babe, you look absolutely stunning. I can't wait for what's next."

Climbing onto the bed and straddling Michael, Isabella pressed him down. "Just lie still and enjoy the service."

Michael nodded and lay flat, clearly affected by the sight of her.

His penis, which had just released in the bathroom, was now standing at attention again.

Isabella brought in a tray. Michael glanced sideways to see what looked like ice, a cup of steaming hot water, and a transparent bottle of something mysterious.

"What are these? Are these the props for the next act?" Michael asked, curious.

Rolling her eyes, Isabella patted his leg. "Can't you keep a little mystery? Where's all this curiosity coming from? Now, turn over and lie on your stomach."

Michael shrugged and turned over as instructed. Soon, he felt Isabella sitting on his buttocks.

Isabella's weight was light, and Michael enjoyed the touch of their naked bodies, igniting an even more intense flame in him.

Michael was curious about Isabella's next move, but he knew that keeping a sense of mystery would make things more exciting.

Suddenly, Michael felt a cool sensation on his back, contrasting with the warmth of her skin. He shivered.

"Darling, what did you pour on my back?" Michael asked, intrigued.

Smiling, Isabella said, "Just some lubricant."

As soon as Isabella finished speaking, her gentle hands began to caress Michael's body. Her fingers gently kneaded along his back muscles, giving him a refreshing feeling deep within his soul.

"Darling, are you giving me a massage? But you could use a little more strength, your touch feels like you're tickling me." With his eyes closed, Michael swayed slightly, enjoying Isabella's touch.

"I'm not massaging you, just applying the lubricant to your body," Isabella said, then leaned down.

Suddenly, Michael felt a soft squeezing sensation on his back. He knew it was Isabella's breasts from their familiar softness.

Isabella straddled Michael, constantly rotating and moving, her breasts pressing against his back, bringing a different sensation.

Though still in lingerie, Isabella's bra was soft, and Michael could feel her nipples getting hard through the fabric.

Michael let out a moan, savoring the sensation with his eyes closed. Although the pressure from her breasts wasn't as strong as a finger massage, the tingling sensation from her nipples brushing against his skin touched him deeply.

Michael could feel his penis getting harder under the stimulation on his back, feeling a bit uncomfortable with it pressed against the bed.

###chapter 344 The Thrill of Ice and Fire

Michael didn't rush Isabella to get to the point. He knew that savoring the moment was what mattered most right now.

Feeling her soft, bouncy breasts against his back, Michael couldn't help but rub them. Instinctively, he reached back to stroke Isabella's thighs.

His hand glided over her smooth, firm legs, and the delicate touch on her thighs made him moan softly.

Isabella felt a ticklish sensation on her thighs, making her rub his back even faster.

Michael's hand continued to move up her thighs until he pushed aside her panties to touch her labia and clitoris.

One of his fingers gently slid into her vagina, feeling the wetness that showed she was already aroused.

But then, Isabella suddenly pulled away, leaving Michael puzzled. "Why'd you stop? Not enough lube?" he asked.

Blushing, Isabella glared at him. "Ever think I might be tired too? I need to switch it up," she said.

Michael chuckled and stayed on the bed. Suddenly, he felt Isabella's hand kneading his butt and stroking the cleft. She lifted his body slightly, raising his buttocks.

"Darling, this is kinda embarrassing," Michael said with a smile.

Out of nowhere, Michael let out a loud moan as Isabella's hand, while caressing his butt, unexpectedly slipped a finger into his anus.

"Darling, you never told me you had this move up your sleeve," Michael moaned, but he didn't resist.

Even though the pleasure from his prostate was a bit embarrassing, it was undeniably enjoyable.

Isabella didn't respond but used her other hand, slick with lube, to touch his penis and massage his balls.

"This feels amazing. Darling, did you look this up online?" Michael asked, clearly enjoying himself.

Suddenly, he felt Isabella patting his butt, and he smiled, stopping his questions. Despite their growing openness in the bedroom, Isabella still couldn't stand vulgar language.

Michael tried to relax his sphincter to make it easier for Isabella's fingers to slide in smoothly.

At the same time, he could feel her other hand repeatedly rubbing his glans. The sensitive tip always made his body tremble slightly when stimulated. The tingling sensation went deep into his soul.

They stayed like that for nearly 20 minutes, with Michael enjoying a different kind of pleasure.

Suddenly, Isabella removed her finger from his anus and patted his butt. "Darling, turn over and face up," she said.

Michael nodded and lay on the bed, noticing the tray in Isabella's hand. He immediately understood she was going to use more props.

He obediently lay down, his erect penis standing tall.

Michael noticed Isabella picking up the cup of ice water from the tray. She took a sip, then brought her mouth close to his face.

The cold water slowly dripped from her mouth onto his face, sending shivers through his hot skin and making him moan involuntarily.

"Darling, what new game is this?" Michael asked, eyes closed, savoring the sensation.

With water still in her mouth, Isabella didn't answer. She continued down his face, neck, and then to his nipples.

Michael felt the cold water circling his nipples. Even though men's nipples aren't as functional as women's, they're just as sensitive. The cold water's stimulation almost made him cry out.

After a brief pause on his nipples, Isabella moved down to his groin. She spat out the now-warm water and took another sip.

As Isabella drank, Michael instinctively spread his legs, sensing the real fun was about to start.

He was right. Isabella took some crushed ice in her mouth and then engulfed his penis.

The instant cold sensation shot through his nerves to his brain. The hot penis touching the ice felt like a strong chemical reaction, making Michael feel like his penis was getting bigger.

Michael opened his eyes in pleasure and looked down at his lower body.

With ice in her mouth, Isabella moved up and down his penis. As the melted ice water flowed down to his scrotum, it stimulated his testicles. The cold water also trickled to his anus, causing his sphincter to contract involuntarily.

But this was just the beginning.

After the ice in her mouth melted, Isabella spat it out and took a mouthful of warm water. She lowered her head and engulfed Michael's penis with the warm water.

"Oh my, this is so stimulating," Michael gasped heavily.

After the cold water, his penis had adjusted to the temperature, but the sudden flow of hot water made him feel like his penis was about to explode.

Enjoying Isabella's actions, Michael tightly gripped the bedsheets, tearing them in some places from the force.

After the repeated hot and cold water stimulation, Michael's glans became even more sensitive. Most importantly, Isabella's tongue and teeth kept stimulating his sensitive glans, almost making him feel the urge to ejaculate.

Michael thought, 'Darn it, am I about to climax before the main event? How can my body be so weak? Hold on! I must hold on!' He tightly closed his eyes, trying to shift his focus to suppress the urge to ejaculate.

In Michael's mind, images of past competitors, enemies, John, Mason, and even Isabella's disliked parents flashed rapidly.

Just as Michael felt the urge to ejaculate gradually being suppressed, Isabella's new stimulation arrived.

If this story resonates with you, I'd love if you could pass it along to your friends. It really makes a difference for me.

###chapter 345 Can't Hold It Anymore

When Isabella was going down on Michael, she suddenly pulled out an ice cube from a cup and slipped it into his butt.

At that moment, Isabella had hot water in her mouth, but the ice cube was in his butt.

The penis and butt are close, but the contrasting sensations of cold and hot were different. The stimulation of these opposite sensations instantly brought Michael's attention back.

"Damn, I can't hold it anymore," Michael growled, his body shaking violently as thick semen shot into Isabella's mouth.

After Michael's body returned to normal, he looked at Isabella regretfully, feeling defeated.

"Darling, I feel like such a failure. I couldn't resist your temptation," Michael sighed softly, feeling more frustrated and defeated than ever before.

Isabella spat out all the water and semen from her mouth, then looked at Michael and said with a smile, "What's wrong? Darling, didn't you say you were full of strength? It's only been twice."

Michael felt challenged, and his dignity rose once again.

"How could I admit defeat after just two times? I can continue, 3 times, 4 times, even 10 times! I have plenty of energy!" Michael got up from the bed, struck a bodybuilding pose, displaying his magnificent physique.

Isabella applauded, "Great, let's continue."

Michael's body trembled slightly. However, Isabella had already pushed him back onto the bed.

Straddling Michael, Isabella, wearing lingerie, rubbed her buttocks on his penis repeatedly.

With Isabella's smooth and delicate skin and the friction of lubricant, Michael's penis, which had just softened, revived once again.

"Darling, I feel like you're a little scared. Maybe we should stop for today," Isabella said and looked at him with a mocking gaze.

Michael couldn't stand being mocked, so he wouldn't admit it. He even encouraged Isabella to bravely use her next techniques.

"Bring it on. If I feel scared, then I'm not a man! I have plenty of energy," Michael snorted, reaching out to touch Isabella's buttocks.

As Michael kneaded Isabella's buttocks, he felt the smooth touch of her skin and the softness of her buttocks. He even heard her increasingly rapid breathing.

"After serving you for so long, now it's your turn to serve me," Isabella said, straddling Michael's lower abdomen and pulling aside her panties to reveal her moist genitals.

Michael felt Isabella's soft labia rubbing on his glans penis, but she refused to sit down.

"Darling, please, don't make me endure it anymore. Let me in, don't tease me," Michael pleaded with a wry smile.

Michael felt his desire burning once again, his thoughts slowing down, pleasure filling his brain. He couldn't wait any longer.

"Alright, darling, since you're begging me like this, I'll satisfy you," Isabella said, grabbing Michael's penis, aiming it at her opening, and slowly sinking down.

Michael felt his dick getting swallowed by the warm walls of her pussy, making him let out a satisfied groan.

Isabella felt it too, tilting her head back and letting out a long moan.

Her hips kept swaying, making Michael's dick thrust in and out of her.

Michael's hands roamed up her waist, grabbing her tits. Isabella leaned forward to make it easier for him.

"Baby, this is so damn exciting and pleasurable, this is exactly what I wanted," Michael exclaimed.

Isabella moaned, her breasts being kneaded by Michael. The pleasure from below made her speechless and unable to think straight.

"Darling, I thought you were the dominant one. Do you like it when I pin you down?" Isabella asked seductively.

Michael chuckled, "Babe, I'm not as dominant as you think. Sometimes lying back and enjoying it is a different kind of pleasure."

They laughed together, and the room was filled with the scent of hormones all night long.

The next morning, they lay in bed, the blanket covering their bodies, clothes scattered around.

Then the phone by the bed rang. A hand reached out from under the covers and answered it.

Soon, Carol's frantic voice came through the phone. "Ms. Taylor, why didn't you come to work today? I've hired new staff, you need to use your damn charm to win them over!"

Isabella felt exhausted, her whole body ached, and she didn't even have the strength to turn over.

"Sorry, Carol. I was just too tired last night. I'll get up now, let them wait a bit longer," Isabella said, struggling to get out of bed.

Isabella glanced at Michael beside her; well, he was equally tired, with dark circles under his eyes.

There was silence on the other end of the phone for a moment, then Carol asked in surprise, "Did you two celebrate all night long?"

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Isabella dressed and said, "Carol, you should understand. Women can be quite hungry in certain aspects. I planned to celebrate on my first day as CEO but held back."

Carol sighed and said, "Alright, alright, I'll try to buy you some time. It took me a lot of effort to poach talent from other companies. If you don't come, we won't be able to hire anyone in the future."

After finishing the call, Isabella hung up and then quickly rushed into the bathroom to freshen up.

When Isabella came out of the bathroom, she walked to Michael's side and kissed his sleeping face.

"Darling, wait for me to come back, I still have some moves left," Isabella said, patting Michael's butt before leaving the bedroom.

After Isabella left, Michael opened his eyes, a hint of panic flashing in them. "Damn, I have to find a way to protect my dick!"

###chapter 346 Encounter Outside the Clinic

When Michael rolled out of bed, his lower back was killing him. He couldn't remember how much he had, uh, "released" last night, but he was pretty sure it was a lot.

Yawning, he shuffled to the bathroom and caught a glimpse of the dark circles under his eyes.

"Why do guys always seem more wiped out than girls after sex? How does Isabella stay so peppy?" he wondered, splashing water on his face before heading out.

The first thing he did after leaving the bathroom was rub his back and stretch out.

Just then, his phone buzzed. It was Benjamin.

"I've got that private jet you asked for. Seriously, man, you have so many jets of your own. Why use mine?" Benjamin's voice had a hint of annoyance.

A few days back, Michael and Isabella had decided that once things calmed down at the company, they'd jet off somewhere to take some killer wedding photos.

So, Michael had hit up Benjamin for his jet.

"Look, Isabella's the CEO now. Her power's only growing. If I use my jet, she'll definitely find out. It's just safer to use yours," Michael explained, trying to catch his breath, which only made Benjamin more suspicious.

"Hold up, you sound beat. Are you sick?" Benjamin asked, concerned.

Michael hesitated. "Nah, just tired from last night. I just need some rest."

Benjamin burst out laughing. "No way! Didn't you just finish your meds? Are they still working after all that action?"

Michael was a bit worried too. "I don't know, man. I need to check in with the doctor who gave me the meds."

Even over the phone, Benjamin could tell Michael was exhausted. After a quick chat, he let Michael go to rest.

Though Benjamin laughed at Michael, he couldn't help but feel a bit envious. He and Amelia were still in the early stages, so they hadn't gotten that far yet.

Benjamin thought, 'Wait, the book says traveling together can strengthen a relationship. Maybe I should take Amelia on a trip too. Maybe even propose and get some wedding photos done.'

After hanging up, Michael called Jerry to come over and drive him.

When Jerry showed up and saw Michael, he was shocked.

"Mr. Williams, what happened to you? You look like you've been poisoned!" Jerry exclaimed, worried.

Michael rolled his eyes. "Do you think I'm dumb enough to get poisoned? Just take me to Willow Street."

When Jerry heard the address, his expression got a bit weird. He gave Michael a once-over, like he was putting two and two together.

"Mr. Williams, is it your back?" Jerry asked, pointing.

"Shut up. Don't ask questions you shouldn't," Michael snapped, his sharp look making Jerry zip it.

On the drive to Willow Street, Jerry kept shaking his shoulders, trying not to laugh.

Since getting in the car, Jerry had noticed Michael's heavy breathing. Though he seemed to be getting a bit better, there was still cold sweat on his forehead.

"If you want to laugh, just do it. But if you cause an accident, you're fired," Michael's icy voice came from the back seat.

Jerry shuddered, and his laughter vanished.

"Mr. Williams, how could you think that? I'd never laugh at you. You've got it all wrong," Jerry said awkwardly.

Michael just snorted and ignored him.

When they pulled up outside the familiar clinic, Jerry suddenly stopped Michael from getting out.

"Hold on, Mr. Williams. There's something going on. Stay in the car for now," Jerry said, looking serious.

"What's up? What's happening?" Michael asked calmly from the back seat.

Jerry pointed at a black sedan parked nearby. "That's John's car. We don't know if he's inside right now. If he sees you here for meds, it might cause some misunderstandings."

Jerry was being polite; he was worried John would mock Michael for buying some, uh, "performance enhancers."

Michael didn't catch the hint and frowned. "John's car? What's he doing here? Is he also here for meds?"

As Michael pondered, John walked out of the clinic, carrying some medicine.

John didn't notice Michael's car and drove off after getting in.

Once John was gone, Michael finally got out and walked into the clinic.

Inside, the doctor sighed after checking him out.

"Sir, I know it's been a rough month, but you need to take it easy. Otherwise, your performance will suffer," the doctor said, making Michael's face darken.

Behind him, Jerry covered his mouth, trying not to laugh.

While the doctor wrote the prescription, Michael suddenly asked, "What was that young man who just left buying? I'm his uncle and I care about his health. Is he like me?"

The doctor smiled and shook his head. "No, he's not like you. He came here to buy progesterone tablets."

###chapter 347 Bianca's Good Luck

After Michael and Jerry walked out of the clinic, their faces were grim.

"I thought we had Bianca this time, that she'd be locked up for good. Seems like she's got some serious luck," Michael muttered.

During their chat with the doctor, Michael found out that John had brought a woman in for a check-up yesterday. From the doc's description, it was definitely Bianca.

The doctor mentioned that Bianca was exhausted and in shock, which could affect her pregnancy. He gave her some meds to help keep the baby safe and calm her down.

"Since you're the young man's elder, you should give him some advice. Make sure he takes care of the pregnant woman's feelings. Women are extra sensitive when they're expecting. Ignoring her could harm the baby, maybe even cause a miscarriage," the doctor told Michael, hoping he'd look out for the younger folks.

Thinking back on the doc's words, Michael's face grew darker.

Jerry, noticing Michael's mood, said, "Mr. Williams, are you worried Bianca's carrying John's baby? You think she'll use the kid to make things harder for Mrs. Williams? If she tries that, we've got plenty of ways to cause a miscarriage."

A flash of coldness crossed Jerry's face.

Michael rolled his eyes and said, "I don't care about Bianca. I'm thinking about something else."

Jerry was clueless about what Michael was pondering.

Actually, Michael was wondering why he and Isabella hadn't gotten pregnant after all this time.

Bianca had pretended to be a uremia patient before. To make it believable, she definitely hadn't been with John, so they had less than a month together. Yet, in that short time, she got pregnant!

"Should Isabella and I get checked out?" Michael started to worry about their future.

After leaving the clinic, John took the meds home. Bianca was asleep in bed.

Watching her sleep, John's feelings were all over the place. He still remembered what happened when he got her out of the detention center yesterday.

That day, after hearing the bad news about her parents, Bianca fainted but woke up soon after. John arrived at the detention center just then and saw her.

Bianca hugged John, crying her heart out, saying Dexter had died.

After a moment, John told Bianca she was pregnant. She was stunned but then wiped her tears and stopped crying.

"A pregnant woman's emotions can affect the baby's health. John, wait for me, I'll grab my stuff from the cell." Bianca smiled at John and, led by the guard, went back to her cell.

Soon after, a woman's scream and alarms blared from the detention center.

When John rushed into the cell with the others, he was horrified by what he saw.

Bianca stood there, covered in blood, with three women in front of her who had been stabbed in the eyes.

With a twisted smile, Bianca turned her blood-stained face to John.

"John, they bullied me. You'll protect us, right?" Bianca touched her belly and looked at John for reassurance.

John knew this was Bianca's way of getting back at him. But he had no choice. He couldn't let his child be born in prison. So, he pulled some strings to bail her out.

The three blinded women were diagnosed with a deadly bacterium causing eye injuries and would have to stay in a facility for the disabled.

After leaving the detention center, John took Bianca to the hospital. The doctors recommended a clinic for gentle medication to help her adjust. Coincidentally, this clinic was the same one where Michael had bought the medication.

Meanwhile, when Isabella got to the office, she had to deal with some job applicants, some for interviews, and some recommended by Carol.

Isabella suspected there might be spies from the Four Families among them. But for now, she had no choice because the company was really short-staffed. She planned to investigate and clear out the moles once things settled down.

After agreeing to the last applicant's request to join, Isabella rubbed her face vigorously and flopped down in her office chair without any grace.

"Looks like you had a rough night," Carol said with a smile.

Isabella lazily waved her hand, "My husband is even more exhausted than me. He's probably still lying in bed, not wanting to move."

Isabella felt a wave of drowsiness. Even though she was a CEO now, her work was way busier than in those novels.

"Forget it, get some rest. There's nothing else to do today. I'll head back to my office," Carol said, taking the files and leaving.

Feeling more and more sleepy, just as Isabella was about to take a nap, her phone suddenly rang.

Isabella reluctantly picked up her phone and saw it was Brenda calling.

Isabella sighed, thinking there might be some trouble at the police station again. She answered, "Officer Pena, what's up?"

Brenda's tone was a bit off. She said in a low voice, "Isabella, I have some bad news. Bianca's been bailed out by John."

Isabella immediately snapped out of her drowsiness. She opened her eyes, furrowed her brow, and sat up straight in her chair. "Has John lost his mind? He's taking in a woman who keeps deceiving him. Has he really gone crazy?"

Brenda chuckled bitterly. "I'm sorry, Isabella. Even if you go to Mason this time, he might not help you."

"Why?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

"Because Bianca is pregnant," Brenda said flatly.

Isabella was left stunned.

###chapter 348 Traveling Abroad

When Isabella got home that evening, she broke the news to Michael about Bianca being pregnant.

To her surprise, Michael stayed cool as a cucumber, like he already knew.

"I went to the clinic for a check-up today and saw John and Bianca there. They didn't see me though, I hid," Michael said, tweaking the story a bit.

Isabella flopped onto the sofa, tapping her forehead. "Is God on my side or Bianca's? Why does my life always feel like a mess, while Bianca keeps hurting me and still gets away with it?"

Michael chuckled, sat next to her, and started massaging her head to help her chill out.

"Don't stress, babe. Even if Bianca's pregnant, there's already a rift between her and John. After this, she won't mess with us for a while. We can finally have some peace," Michael said with a smile, then brought up the idea of taking their wedding photos.

Isabella sat up, curious. "Honey, have you thought about where we should take our wedding photos?"

"Of course, babe. How about Lumaria? I heard it's already snowing there, and the mountain scenery is gorgeous. We might even see some cherry blossoms, though it's not really the season. But skiing sounds fun too," Michael suggested with a grin.

After thinking it over, Isabella agreed. "That sounds perfect. Let's go. It's the perfect time to leave the company stuff to the execs."

They agreed on the plan and started chatting about what to do once they got to Lumaria.

Two days flew by, and it was time for their trip.

Their private plane landed at the airport, decked out with plush sofas and even massage chairs. Michael grabbed a beer and a juice from the fridge, handing the juice to Isabella before sitting next to her.

"Why are you two tagging along for our wedding photoshoot?" Michael asked Amelia, who was sitting on the other side of Isabella, and Benjamin, who was lounging in the massage chair.

Benjamin, enjoying the massage chair, waved his hand nonchalantly. "Michael, don't forget, this is my private plane. My girlfriend and I were already planning to travel. If she hadn't insisted on staying with your wife, we'd be somewhere else."

He glanced at Amelia after saying this.

Amelia just rolled her eyes but didn't say anything, seemingly accepting the girlfriend label. Benjamin grinned, satisfied.

Isabella looked at Michael and smiled. "Honey, you know women have the final say when it comes to wedding dresses. I invited Amelia to help me pick one out."

Michael nodded, smiling as he stroked Isabella's hair. "Alright, babe, your call. At least we have a doctor with us."

Benjamin groaned, "Seriously, you guys are using my plane and now me too!"

Michael just gave a cold smile and turned to Amelia. "What do you think, Amelia?"

Amelia shot him a look. "I think you're pushing it too."

Benjamin smugly patted his thigh and laughed.

Isabella joined in the laughter, while Michael rubbed his nose, feeling a bit awkward.

Then Amelia remembered something and asked, "I heard Bianca got out of the detention center again because she's pregnant. Could this be another stunt like the kidney failure thing?"

Isabella and Michael's faces darkened at the mention of Bianca.

Benjamin shook his head. "John's not that dumb. From what I found out, he took Bianca to the hospital to confirm the pregnancy. She's just really lucky, finding another way to manipulate John."

Amelia looked a bit worried. She turned to Isabella and said, "Isabella, now that Bianca's pregnant, Mason might not be able to help you deal with her like before. The baby is part of their family, after all."

Isabella smiled and shook her head. "Don't worry. Since I became CEO, Mason's help has been minimal. If Bianca tries anything again, I trust Mason will make the right call."

Isabella had faith in Mason. While he valued family legacy, he wouldn't let anyone use a child to threaten him.

Michael nodded slightly. Knowing Mason's younger days, he might have kept the child and dealt with the mother if threatened.

Though Mason had mellowed with age, it didn't mean he wouldn't resort to his old ways if pushed.

Sensing the heaviness of the topic, Amelia switched gears.

"Even Bianca's pregnant, why haven't you two made any moves yet?" Amelia teased, patting Isabella's belly.

Isabella blushed.

Benjamin looked at Michael curiously. "Yeah, you called me the other day, saying you were busy all night, almost broke your back. How come there's no baby yet with all that effort?"

Isabella shot Michael a red-faced glare.

"Why do you tell everyone everything?" she snapped, twisting Michael's waist.

Michael winced, his expression changing as he glared at Benjamin. "Can't you keep your mouth shut sometimes?"

Benjamin shrugged, grinning mischievously.

Rubbing his sore waist, Michael shot back, "Benjamin, don't just talk about us. What about you two?"

Benjamin and Amelia looked awkward and didn't respond. They hadn't even gotten that far recently.

###chapter 349 The Crazy Woman

The whole topic of having kids just kind of fizzled out.

The last thing Isabella said was, "The more impressive someone is, the less likely they are to have kids. Bianca can get pregnant because she only knows some low-class tricks. She's not smart."

Isabella's words got her and Michael out of that awkward conversation.

By the time their plane landed in Lumaria, it was already late. With not much going on at night, they headed straight to the hotel.

They had booked a presidential suite with two separate rooms.

The hotel had a hot spring, which was supposed to be great for the body and skin. So after dropping off their luggage, Amelia took Isabella to check it out.

Michael and Benjamin stayed back in the room to sort out the next day's plans. Originally, Michael's schedule didn't include Benjamin, but now with four people, they had to adjust.

After about ten minutes of planning, there was a knock on the door.

Benjamin, looking puzzled, opened it to find a hotel staff member standing there.

"We didn't call for room service. What's up?" Benjamin asked, confused.

The staff member, looking awkward and anxious, said, "I'm sorry, but it seems your two female companions got into a fight with someone."

Michael bolted out of the room as soon as the staff finished talking.

Benjamin glared at the staff and said urgently, "Why are you just standing there? Take us to them, now."

This whole mess started more than ten minutes ago.

After Amelia and Isabella left the room, they were headed to the hot spring. But just as they were about to enter, a woman rushed at them.

The woman had red eyes like she'd been crying and was babbling in some language they couldn't understand, trying to grab Isabella's face.

Luckily, Amelia saw it coming and pushed Isabella out of the way, stopping the woman's long nails from scratching her.

"What the hell is wrong with you? Are you crazy?" Amelia yelled, shoving the woman.

But the woman kept babbling and lunged at Isabella again.

Isabella's good mood for the hot spring was instantly ruined. As the woman got closer, she swung her handbag and smacked her in the face.

The woman stopped, holding her face. Amelia jumped in, tackled her, and they started struggling.

"You crazy woman, how dare you attack my friend?" Amelia shouted, punching her in the face.

Instead of stopping Amelia, Isabella joined in and kicked the woman a few times.

Other tourists nearby were shocked and quickly called the hotel staff over.

The staff rushed in and tried to break up the fight.

"Ladies, please calm down. What happened?" one of the staff members asked anxiously.

Amelia pointed at the woman and said, "How should I know what's wrong with her? She just attacked us out of nowhere. We don't even know her!"

Isabella, still fuming, asked the hotel staff coldly, "Is the security here so bad? How did this crazy woman get in?"

The hotel staff could only apologize repeatedly to Isabella and the others.

Soon, Michael and Benjamin showed up.

After making sure Isabella and Amelia weren't hurt, they noticed the woman who had attacked them had several wounds.

Michael's face darkened. He demanded an explanation from the hotel. The manager arrived, bowing and apologizing.

The woman kept crying and shouting, but hardly anyone understood her.

Michael frowned slightly, walked up to the woman, and asked, "Are you saying my wife is your husband's lover? If you can't give me a reasonable explanation, I won't let this go."

Isabella was shocked that Michael could understand her language.

"Dear, you understand her?" Isabella asked, curious.

Michael nodded. "She's speaking a minority language that I happen to have studied."

"What did she say?" Amelia and Benjamin asked, curious.

Michael's expression darkened as he pointed at the woman and said, "She claims Isabella is her husband's lover and came here to catch them in the act."

Isabella and Amelia were stunned.

"Is she out of her mind? It's our first day here. What is she trying to catch? We don't even know her," Amelia shouted, frustrated by the false accusation.

Benjamin rubbed his chin and said, "Is it possible she mistook the people she wanted to catch? Maybe it's actually those two."

Benjamin pointed to a couple among the onlookers, and everyone turned to look.

The man wasn't anything special, definitely not as handsome as Michael or Benjamin. Most importantly, the woman next to him was dressed similarly to Isabella.

The onlookers compared the woman on the ground to Isabella. They were similar in height, build, and clothing.

The woman on the ground saw the couple. Her eyes turned red, and she screamed, rushing towards the man. He grabbed the woman next to him and ran away.

Benjamin smirked. "Looks like I was right. It was all just a misunderstanding."

"Another woman betrayed by love," Isabella said, shaking her head in pity.

After things calmed down, they went back to the hot spring. When they came out, they saw the woman in the lobby, hugging her knees and crying.

###chapter 350 Quirky Friends

A staff member was trying to calm the woman down.

Isabella walked up to another staff member and asked what was going on.

The staff member chuckled, "She found out her husband was cheating and came here with just a photo of the other woman's back. She thought you were the other woman because you were dressed exactly the same, right down to the shoes and bag."

Isabella didn't care about the matching outfits; she just wanted to know where the couple had gone.

The staff member went on, "Actually, the guy didn't cheat. He's legally married to the woman here, but he hid that marriage and married another woman abroad. So, technically, the crying woman is the mistress."

"Men will do anything to cheat. I bet he thought she'd never come to another country to catch him," Amelia said, glancing at Benjamin and Michael.

Benjamin rolled his eyes, "Why are you looking at me? I travel a lot, but I don't even have a wife or a girlfriend."

Michael shrugged, "Same here."

Just then, the crying woman wiped her tears, walked over to Isabella, and said something Isabella couldn't understand.

"She says her name is Elise Sinclair. She made a mistake and caused you trouble. She hopes you can forgive her for acting impulsively," Michael translated.

"Tell her I forgive her and hope she won't be fooled by men again," Isabella said sympathetically.

Michael translated Isabella's words to Elise.

After thanking Isabella, Elise got into the elevator. She had a room in the hotel to catch her husband in the act.

After soaking in the hot springs, the group headed back to their rooms.

Isabella and Michael lay on the bed, cuddling and browsing online for local food and unique customs.

Suddenly, Michael felt Isabella's hand wandering to his lower abdomen.

Michael smiled wryly and pulled her hand out of his pants. "Babe, we need to rest early, adjust to the time difference, and we have to take wedding photos tomorrow. We need to save our energy, especially since we have to climb a snow mountain."

Isabella pouted and hummed in annoyance.

Outside their room, Amelia and Benjamin were eavesdropping at the door, looking puzzled.

"You said they're usually very active. Why is it so quiet tonight?" Amelia whispered to Benjamin.

Benjamin smiled bitterly, "Maybe they're just tired. But isn't it rude to eavesdrop?"

"What are you worried about? Can't you satisfy my curiosity?" Amelia rolled her eyes and kept listening.

Suddenly, they heard nothing from the room. As they wondered, the door swung open, and Benjamin and Amelia, caught off guard, fell to the ground.

They looked up to see Isabella and Michael staring down at them.

The atmosphere was super awkward.

Isabella looked at Benjamin and Amelia and asked, "Why are you two still up so late, and why are you eavesdropping at my door?"

Amelia was mortified. She couldn't exactly say she wanted to see if Isabella and Michael were really capable of going at it all night like they claimed.

Amelia suddenly pointed at Benjamin and said, "It's Benjamin. He said he had something to tell you."

Benjamin was caught off guard, pointing at himself, "Me? When did I say that?"

Amelia glared at him and twisted his waist. Benjamin winced in pain and nodded helplessly.

"Yeah, that's right, I had something to tell you. I wanted to ask about your plans for tomorrow," Benjamin stammered out a lame excuse.

Michael gave him a cold look. "Didn't we already plan everything for tomorrow?"

Benjamin scratched his head awkwardly. "Yeah, I know. I just wanted to see if there was anything else you needed to add."

"Nope." Isabella and Michael shook their heads in unison.

"If there's nothing else, we'll head out. It's late, and we need to rest up for the mountain climb tomorrow," Benjamin said, stretching and quickly pulling Amelia back to their room.

As the door of the opposite room closed, Isabella rolled her eyes.

"Amelia's getting more and more mischievous, and now Benjamin's joining in," Isabella said, closing the door.

Actually, Michael and Isabella hadn't noticed them eavesdropping at first, but the shadows under the door gave them away.

Michael shrugged. "Don't think too highly of Benjamin. He was always a prankster in school. Those two are definitely a pair of jokers."

Isabella got back into bed and pulled up the covers. "Alright, babe, let's not talk about them anymore. It's time to rest."

Michael lay down and turned off the light.

About an hour later, Isabella quietly slipped out of bed.

She walked to the door and gently opened it. Just as she was about to leave, she heard Michael's voice behind her.

"It's late. Where are you going? And don't tell me you're going to the bathroom; there's no need to sneak around like a thief," Michael joked, walking up behind her.

Isabella turned around with an embarrassed smile. "Would you believe me if I said I was afraid of waking you up?"

Michael shook his head.

After a moment of silence, Isabella sighed, "Okay, I actually wanted to eavesdrop outside Amelia's room. They did it to us, so it's only fair."

Michael turned her around, grabbed her shoulders, and looked into her eyes. "What you're doing isn't right."

Isabella spread her hands in resignation. "You're right. Eavesdropping is really rude."

Michael shook his head. "I didn't mean that. I meant, why didn't you bring me along when you were planning to eavesdrop?"

###chapter 351 You Are Worse Than An Animal

After Michael finished talking, Isabella was taken aback for a second, then let out a helpless laugh.

"So, people really do laugh when they're feeling helpless," Isabella said, shaking her head. She then walked with Michael towards Benjamin's room. They pressed their ears against the door but heard nothing except steady breathing.

"Looks like they're asleep," Isabella said, sounding a bit let down.

Michael shrugged. "Let's go. They're probably just wiped out from the flight. We should get some rest too."

Isabella and Michael headed back to their room. Not long after they left, the door creaked open. Benjamin peeked out cautiously, then sighed in relief.

"You were right, they were definitely eavesdropping outside our door," Benjamin said, turning to Amelia with a grin.

Amelia smirked, then pulled Benjamin back inside and shut the door.

"I know Isabella too well. We're best friends, after all," Amelia said, lying down in her pajamas.

Benjamin lay on the other side of the bed, both of them under separate blankets, neither saying a word.

The room was super quiet, with only the sound of their breathing and heartbeats.

Benjamin's heart was pounding. He asked tentatively, "Babe, are you cold? I'm feeling kinda warm. If you're cold, I can be your pillow."

Amelia turned away from him. "Don't think I don't know what you're up to. You better drop your little schemes. We're still in the evaluation stage."

Benjamin sighed and shook his head, pushing all his thoughts deep down.

The room went silent again. After a while, Amelia said, "I'm warning you, don't sneak into my blanket while I'm asleep. If you do, you'll be the dumbest creature on earth!"

Benjamin rolled his eyes. "Are you questioning my character?"

Amelia didn't respond, just snorted.

Benjamin snorted back, turned his back to her, and eventually fell asleep, determined to prove his character that night.

But the next morning, they were woken up by their phone alarms. Benjamin got up and turned off the alarm. He noticed their blankets were still separate.

"See, I told you I have good character. I didn't do anything!" Benjamin said proudly.

But Amelia didn't look pleased. She grabbed a pillow and chucked it at him.

"You're worse than an animal!" Amelia snapped, then got up and headed to the bathroom to freshen up.

Benjamin scratched his head, holding the pillow. "Why is she mad? I didn't sneak into her blanket. My character is solid! Shouldn't she be praising me for being a gentleman?"

Benjamin was still puzzled about why Amelia was angry. Even after they freshened up, got dressed, and were ready to head to the snowy mountains, he was still mulling over the question.

They had already planned out their entire trip and even lined up a photographer while staying at the hotel. This time, a travel agency at the base of the snowy mountains picked them up.

Isabella and Amelia had carefully chosen this travel agency as the best one. They handled all the travel details, and the photographers were top-notch, having worked with some international celebrities.

During the car ride, the tour guide in the front seat was going on about safety tips, beautiful spots, local snacks, and attractions.

Michael wasn't really into it. He'd been to this country a few times for business and knew the culture pretty well. Right now, he was more worried about Benjamin.

Benjamin seemed lost in thought.

Isabella and Amelia were all ears to the tour guide, chatting about where to take photos next and what outfits to wear for different poses.

Michael, sitting next to Benjamin, leaned in and asked softly, "What's up? You seem really down."

Benjamin sighed. "I don't know what I did to make Amelia mad."

He quietly filled Michael in on what happened last night.

Michael looked at him in surprise and asked quietly, "So you really didn't sneak into Amelia's blanket last night?"

Even though Michael's voice was low, Benjamin could still sense the shock in his tone.

Frowning, Benjamin looked at Michael, annoyed. "Even if Amelia doubts my character, you shouldn't! Without her permission, I would never sneak into her blanket at night."

Michael looked at him helplessly. "I really don't get why I ever asked you for advice on relationships."

Benjamin could see the disdain in Michael's eyes, which made him even more confused and annoyed.

"What's going on? Do you know something? Spill it," Benjamin asked softly.

Sensing Benjamin's anxiety, Michael rolled his eyes and explained, "If Amelia really minded you sneaking into her blanket, why would she share a bed with you? It means she's accepted you, and you just need a bit of boldness and courage."

Benjamin was stunned. He looked at Michael in disbelief.

"Are you saying Amelia actually wanted me to sneak into her blanket last night?" Benjamin asked, shocked.

Michael nodded, patting Benjamin's shoulder. "Looks like I was wrong before. You might have some unique insights into pursuing women, but when it comes to love, you're not as sharp as me. Remember, when a woman says no, it often means yes."

Benjamin finally got it. He regretfully tapped his head and said angrily, "No wonder she called me worse than an animal this morning. I really am! Don't worry, I know what to do now."

###chapter 352 Taking Photos

Benjamin had made up his mind; tonight was the night he was going to give it a shot.

After a long drive, Isabella and her crew finally pulled up at the base of the snowy mountain. The photographer and wardrobe team were already there, waiting for them.

"Where do we go to try on the clothes? I want to pick out some nice outfits," Isabella asked the photographer, her excitement bubbling over.

The photographer pointed to a nearby truck. The back of the truck opened up, revealing a row of clothes hanging inside.

"Don't worry, we've got everything you need, all in your size. Feel free to try on whatever you like," the photographer said with a respectful nod.

Isabella was blown away by the selection. She picked up a gown and gasped, "Isn't this the haute couture gown from that bridal fashion magazine? You have it here too?"

"Of course, we're internationally renowned photographers. We can get any clothes, and they're all the real deal," the photographer replied, still respectful.

Michael was pleased with the photographer's words. He had arranged for these clothes to be delivered ahead of time.

No one knew Isabella's size better than Michael. Amelia might have known before, but now she didn't, as Isabella's size had changed with love's nourishment.

"This travel agency is really something. So, when do we start?" Amelia asked eagerly from the side.

Benjamin couldn't understand why Amelia was so excited about Isabella taking wedding photos.

"Stop looking so confused. Whatever she does, just nod, smile, and agree. Women's matters are way more complicated than ours," Michael whispered to Benjamin.

Benjamin straightened up immediately, giving Amelia a gentle smile.

The photographer smiled and said, "Taking photos is actually pretty exhausting, so we need to save our energy today. We'll drive up the mountain later. But there might be some spots with better views that we'll have to walk to. Also, it's cold up there, and these gowns aren't warm, so be ready to throw on a coat at any time."

"Hand the coat to me. I'll take care of my friend's coat and make sure she doesn't catch a cold," Amelia said, raising her hand excitedly.

"Thank you so much, my dear friend," Isabella said, hugging Amelia tightly.

"Women's emotions are so delicate. Sometimes seeing their good friends in wedding gowns is even more exciting than wearing one themselves," Michael said, a bit emotional.

Benjamin looked at Michael and asked, "So, what should I do now?"

Michael sighed, seeing the eagerness in Benjamin's eyes. "When they're chatting or excited, it's best to do nothing. Don't even show up, or you'll become the topic."

Benjamin's mouth twitched slightly, but he didn't argue. It made sense.

The crew piled back into the car and headed up the snowy mountain.

The air was crisp, and the scenery was breathtaking.

Halfway up, the photographer pulled over, got everyone out, and started scouting for the perfect spot for Isabella's photos.

"This spot is gorgeous. I suggest the ice blue dress for the lady and the vintage brown suit for the gentleman," the photographer said, handing the outfits to Isabella and Michael.

They ducked into the truck to change.

When they emerged, everyone was floored.

Michael looked dashing, like a nobleman from a bygone era in his vintage suit.

Isabella was stunning, like the Snow Queen straight out of a fairy tale.

"Isabella, you look amazing, like a real Snow Queen!" Amelia gushed, grabbing Isabella's hand.

Isabella smiled wryly, "I know I look good, but can you wait to hug me until after the photos? I'm freezing."

Amelia quickly let go, and the photographer started directing them.

"Sir, smile more. The lady is doing great. Put your hand on his shoulder and look at him like you're melting the snow with your passion," the photographer instructed, changing angles and even lying on the ground to get the perfect shot.

"Look at his dedication, completely ignoring his own comfort for the sake of beautiful photos," Benjamin said, impressed.

Amelia shot Benjamin a look. "Why are you focusing on that? Shouldn't you be amazed at how handsome Michael looks and how beautiful Isabella is?"

Benjamin instinctively replied, "I already knew that, why be amazed?"

Realizing his mistake, he quickly added, "Of course, their outfits today really caught my eye. It's like seeing them anew, like a prince and queen from the snow falling in love in the human world."

Amelia's frown softened.

When the photographer finished the set, Amelia rushed over and draped a coat over Isabella.

"Oh, it's so cold, I'm freezing," Isabella said, her breath visible in the air.

Amelia hugged her and praised, "Fantastic, Isabella! The photos must be amazing. You two look like a prince and queen in love on the snowy mountain."

Benjamin was taken aback, realizing Amelia was echoing his words.

Isabella blushed, "Don't say that, you'll make me shy."

"Alright, time for the next set," the photographer said, handing out more outfits.

Benjamin was stunned by the new outfits.

###chapter 353 Give Kenna Some Shock

The photographer held up two sets of clothes, one looking like a Western cowboy getup and the other a casual yellow dress.

"These don't look like the usual wedding photo outfits. They seem more like everyday clothes," Amelia said, confused.

Isabella also gave the photographer a curious look.

The photographer blinked, thought for a moment, and said, "Ladies, love isn't just about the big, romantic wedding moments. It's also about the little, everyday things. These outfits represent that everyday warmth and affection. It's kind of our specialty here."

After explaining, the photographer nervously glanced at Isabella.

Actually, Michael had sent these outfits over, insisting Isabella wear them for the shoot.

The photographer silently hoped Isabella would go along with it.

Benjamin whispered to Michael, "I think I've seen these outfits in your parents' photos."

Michael nodded. "Yep, when my parents got together and married, their first photos were in matching outfits like these."

Benjamin looked at Michael, a bit exasperated. "Are you trying to make Isabella like your mom?"

Michael rolled his eyes. "This is for my dad. He once said Isabella looks like my mom from a certain angle."

"But these outfits don't really fit the snow mountain theme today. Shouldn't you suggest something else to Isabella?" Benjamin asked.

Michael shook his head, his eyes soft as he looked at Isabella. "I have a feeling she'll pick these."

Isabella looked at the outfits, thought for a moment, then nodded. "You make a good point. I'll go change."

She took the clothes and called out to Michael, "Honey, come over and change too."

Isabella waved at Michael, who shot Benjamin a smug look before heading into the carriage.

Benjamin rolled his eyes. "Look at you, all smug! You need a horse with that cowboy outfit!"

Just as Benjamin finished speaking, the photographer had someone bring over a horse.

The red horse was already saddled and looked very calm.

The photographer looked at Benjamin triumphantly. "We are professionals!"

Benjamin smirked, impressed.

Soon, Isabella and Michael hopped down from the truck. Under the photographer's direction, they rode the horse and took several photos with a grassy background.

"Alright, don't worry, our horse is very gentle. Sir, place your hands on your wife's abdomen. Ma'am, turn your head and smile at your husband. Perfect, your expressions are full of love!" The photographer praised them continuously, snapping away with his camera.

Once the new photos were taken, the photographer sent a couple of them to Michael's phone, just like they had agreed.

Amelia draped the coat over Isabella again, and they chatted about the photos they had just taken.

Meanwhile, Michael stepped aside and sent the new photos to Kenna.

Kenna, who was reading a newspaper in a villa abroad, heard his phone ring. He glanced at it and then his eyes widened.

Kenna picked up the phone from the table, his hands trembling.

After examining the photo carefully several times, Kenna's voice choked up. "It's... it's so much like her!"

At that moment, Kenna's phone rang again. It was Michael calling.

Taking a deep breath, Kenna answered the call.

On the other end, Michael's somewhat playful voice came through. "So, Dad, did it bring back some good memories?"

Taking another deep breath, Kenna said angrily, "If I'm not mistaken, the background in your photos is a snow mountain, right? Listen, if Isabella catches a cold from this, I won't let you off the hook!"

Michael fiddled with his phone. "Don't worry, I'll take good care of my wife. You don't need to worry."

Kenna snorted. "Spit it out, why did you suddenly send me these photos? Are you just showing off?"

Michael chuckled, feeling a bit embarrassed. "Last time we talked, you were upset about me marrying Isabella. I sent the photos to cheer you up."

Kenna let out a long sigh. He knew what Michael was worried about and said calmly, "Don't worry, I won't stop you from being with Isabella. After all, she's my daughter-in-law now. In a way, I'm not losing out, but gaining."

Michael grew more curious. He had always wanted to know about Kenna's past, but Kenna never told him.

"Can you at least tell me, based on the expression in the photos, what did Isabella's grandmother do? Why is my uncle so good to Isabella?" Michael asked curiously.

Kenna snorted heavily. "You remind me of my dear wife. I'm feeling very sad now! So don't expect any information from me. If you want to know, ask your uncle. I can't be bothered to explain to you, you're not worthy of knowing!"

After saying that, Kenna hung up the phone. He then wiped away his tears, looked at Isabella's photo, and turned around to continue chatting with his wife's photo.

On the other side, Michael looked at the ended call screen, rubbed his nose with a wry smile. "They say old people act like children. I hope I won't be like that. If I am, I'll definitely tease my son or grandson!"

Mischievous thoughts filled Michael's mind. However, at that moment, the photographer had already started getting them to change into the third set of clothes.

###chapter 354 Benjamin's Speculation

In this scene, Isabella and Michael spent over two hours changing outfits before heading to their next spot.

In the car, Isabella and Amelia were checking out the photos on the photographer's camera, making comments and cheering every now and then.

Benjamin and Michael were chilling in the back seat.

Benjamin leaned over to Michael and whispered, "So, how'd the talk with your dad go? Did he get all emotional, maybe even cry?"

Michael nodded, "Yeah, he probably cried, but he'd never admit it. I bet he's in his room right now, holding a photo of my mom, wiping away tears and reminiscing."

Benjamin chuckled. "Why do you always mess with your dad like that? That's not cool."

Michael shrugged, "He won't tell me the truth. Every time I ask him about what went down between Mason and Isabella's grandma, he clams up!"

Benjamin was taken aback for a second before saying, "Wait, something happened between Mason and Isabella's grandma? Seriously, do you really need to dig into that? What could've happened between a man and a woman?"

Benjamin's eyes sparkled with curiosity. He loved gossip, especially when it involved celebrities. And if those celebrities were their elders, even better.

"Let me guess," Benjamin's eyes lit up. "Mason and Isabella's grandma were a thing, but they couldn't be together. It became Mason's obsession. When he saw Isabella, she reminded him of her grandma, so he wanted her to marry John. It's like he's trying to fix his past regrets!"

Because that's how it always goes in movies and TV shows.

Michael sighed. He had thought the same thing but wasn't ready to confront Mason about it yet.

Suddenly, a car pulled up next to theirs, and through the window, they saw a bride in a wedding dress.

The photographer pointed to the car and said with a smile, "They're here for wedding photos too. The next spot we're heading to has even better scenery, so it's pretty popular. We might have to wait for a good spot."

Isabella curiously rolled down her window, and the other bride did the same. Their eyes met.

"Hey, it's fate that we meet. Wanna swap bouquets?" The bride from the other car looked even younger than Isabella, with an innocent vibe.

The bride held a pure white bouquet that matched her look perfectly.

Isabella looked at the bride, feeling nostalgic. She thought of herself eight years ago, young and innocent, dreaming of marrying John. But reality had shattered those dreams.

"Sure, I wish you a happy marriage." Isabella handed over her bouquet, and the other bride did the same.

Their bouquets met in the air, like a little exchange of love vibes between the past and the present.

"Your flowers smell amazing, thanks! I wish you a happy marriage," the other bride said, waving to Isabella.

Isabella nodded, "Thanks, I hope you have a happy marriage too."

With the cold in the snowy mountains, the two brides quickly rolled up their windows after the bouquet swap. They only got out when both cars reached the photo spot.

Once out of the car, Isabella exhaled, her breath turning into a white mist in the chilly air.

Michael walked over and hugged her, rubbing her hands to warm them up.

"Still cold?" Michael asked with a smile.

Isabella shook her head, "Not anymore, your hands are warm."

Michael grinned and pulled out a lounge chair. "Sit and relax. The car was cramped, and we might have to wait a bit because of the crowd."

Isabella looked around. The scenery was stunning, with several couples taking wedding photos.

She didn't refuse and lay down on the lounge chair.

"Do you want to lie down too? Did you only bring one chair?" Isabella asked curiously.

Michael squatted beside her and smiled, "It's okay, I don't mind. I'm not tired, but you seem a bit weak. Your legs are shivering from the cold. Let me massage them for you."

Michael rubbed his palms together and started massaging Isabella's legs.

People around them glanced over with gentle smiles. Isabella blushed a bit but didn't refuse.

Just then, the bride who had swapped bouquets with Isabella walked over with her husband.

The groom looked a bit shy and chubby but kind-hearted.

The bride pointed at Michael and said, "Honey, do you notice anything about this gentleman?"

The groom scratched his head and said in surprise, "Honey, are you feeling sorry for him?"

The bride rolled her eyes. Isabella couldn't help but laugh, covering her mouth and shaking her shoulders on the lounge chair.

Michael looked up and gave the groom a side-eye. This guy's emotional intelligence was almost as bad as Benjamin's.

Benjamin and Amelia saw the whole thing.

Amelia laughed, holding her stomach. "This is hilarious. Honey, isn't this scene funny?"

Benjamin smirked, thinking his emotional intelligence was way better than the groom's.

"Honey, do you need to lie down too? Should I massage your legs?" Benjamin joked with Amelia.

Amelia rolled her eyes, "Oh, please, I don't want people to think you're pitiful."

Amelia laughed again.

Everyone was laughing, except for the groom, who looked embarrassed. Did he really say something wrong?

###chapter 355 Strange Message

Isabella and her crew hung around for a bit before finally getting their photos taken. After the shoot, it was time for the couple to exchange flowers.

They also snapped some group shots with the bride and groom. It felt like making new friends in a far-off place.

After saying their goodbyes, Isabella's group kept climbing higher up the snowy mountain. They spent the whole day there, capturing all the shots they needed.

The mountain scenery was stunning, and there were plenty of tourists around. Where there are tourists, there are always restaurants and shops, so food wasn't an issue.

Once they wrapped up the photo session, they headed back to the hotel by car.

"I can't wait to see those pics," Isabella said, grinning as she hugged Michael's neck.

Michael pulled her closer and said, "Didn't the photographer mention? They need to edit the photos first to make them perfect."

Isabella pouted. "But the photographer also said we're already good-looking, and the photos would be great even without editing."

Michael kissed her forehead and then suddenly lifted her, placing her on the bed. "Didn't the photographer already send you the photos?"

"I want an album!" Isabella frowned and playfully tapped Michael's forehead, wondering why he was being so dense.

Michael chuckled, shook his head, got up from the bed, and took off his shirt.

"I'm gonna take a shower and then grab some dinner. Wanna join me?" Michael asked with a grin.

Isabella playfully swatted his waist. "Are you sure?"

Michael smirked. "Actually, I think it's better if we shower separately. We did splurge on this presidential suite, so no need to worry about the water bill."

With that, Michael headed into the bathroom with a towel.

Isabella covered her mouth, a mischievous smile spreading across her face. Teasing Michael was always fun.

She pulled out her phone and checked the photos the photographer had sent. Even unedited, they looked amazing against the snowy backdrop.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed with a message.

The sender was a stranger, but the content made Isabella's brow furrow.

Stranger: [Your husband is a fraud. He's not just your husband; he's mine too.]

Isabella glanced towards the bathroom and then typed a reply.

Isabella: [Are you sure you have the right person?]

Stranger: [I'm not mistaken. Your husband's name is Michael. He's my husband too.]

Isabella's frown deepened. She suddenly remembered being mistaken for a mistress when they arrived at the hotel yesterday.

Elise, who came to blow the lid off the affair, caused this mess because her husband had tied the knot in two different countries.

Isabella: [I don't know who you are, but without solid proof, I'll sue you.]

Stranger: [You want proof? Fine, I'll give it to you.]

A moment later, the stranger sent a photo. Isabella's jaw dropped. It was a wedding photo of Michael with another woman, her face blurred out. Isabella knew it wasn't her; their wedding was in the snowy mountains, not by the seaside.

Isabella's eyes turned icy. She quickly typed back.

Isabella: [You think you can fool me with this photo? In this day and age, even videos can be faked. Why should I believe this?]

The stranger didn't reply right away but instead retracted all the previous messages.

But Isabella was quick and saved the photo before it disappeared.

Then, another message popped up.

Stranger: [If you don't believe me, check the local government records. There's a whole industry helping men get married abroad. You might find info about their other marriages.]

Isabella's frown deepened.

Isabella: [Why are you saying "these men"? Are you implying my husband has multiple wives?]

Stranger: [I know of at least two, but I won't send you more. The power behind your husband is scary, and I don't want to put other women in danger.]

Another message followed.

Stranger: [I'm telling you this as a fellow woman. Be cautious and don't get fooled by marriage. If you still don't believe me, good luck.]

The stranger retracted the message shortly after. No more messages came through.

Isabella tried calling the number, but no one picked up.

She narrowed her eyes and opened the saved photo again. In it, Michael wore a wedding suit, looking all charming. The woman next to him, though blurred, seemed to be smiling.

Isabella suddenly grinned, saved the photo to her email, and put her phone away.

Just then, Michael walked out of the bathroom, drying his hair with a towel.

"Everything okay, babe? You seem a bit off," Michael asked, puzzled.

Isabella shook her head with a smile. "I was just thinking, only taking photos in the snowy mountains might be a bit boring. Maybe we should take some by the sea too."

Michael nodded, smiling. "This country has a coastline. If you want, we can take some seaside photos. And remember? I was planning to propose to you on a cruise last time."

Isabella stared at Michael's face but saw nothing suspicious.

"Our schedule is already packed, so let's wait until the end of the trip," Isabella said, smiling as she grabbed her clothes and headed into the bathroom for a shower.

###chapter 356 Benjamin's Ex-Girlfriend

As Isabella's husband, Michael could sense there was something off behind her smile, but she wasn't talking, and he had no clue how to bring it up.

After Isabella finished her shower and got dressed, Benjamin and Amelia came out of their room too. It was time to leave the hotel and try some local food.

Taking the hotel staff's advice, they headed to a spot known for its local dishes. But just as they ordered, an excited voice interrupted.

"Benjamin, is that you? Wow, I can't believe I'm seeing you here!" a woman exclaimed, rushing over to Benjamin.

Benjamin's face showed pure shock when he saw her.

Isabella and Amelia exchanged puzzled looks, while Michael narrowed his eyes.

"Lila? What are you doing here?" Benjamin asked, still stunned.

"I'm traveling! Remember, I always wanted to be a travel writer? To explore and write about different cultures?" Lila said, hugging Benjamin with excitement.

Benjamin looked a bit awkward and glanced at Amelia, who stayed cool and composed.

Isabella leaned over to Michael and whispered, "Who's Lila? You seem to know her."

Michael nodded, "Yeah, Lila's Benjamin's ex from college. After they broke up, Benjamin, who never drinks, got wasted, and I had to drag him back to the dorm."

Isabella was surprised, not expecting to run into Benjamin's ex while they were abroad.

"Amelia, don't you think this is weird? This woman showing up here feels off," Isabella said, eyeing Amelia.

Amelia smiled, stood up, and casually linked her arm with Benjamin's, smiling, "Honey, is this your friend? Why not introduce us?"

Benjamin was caught off guard, feeling the tension in the air.

"Sure, this is Lila Donovan, a friend from college," Benjamin said.

Just as Benjamin was about to introduce Amelia to Lila, Amelia extended her hand to Lila.

"Hi, Ms. Donovan, I'm Amelia Martinez, Benjamin's girlfriend," Amelia said warmly.

A flicker of hostility crossed Lila's eyes, but she quickly smiled and shook Amelia's hand. "Nice to meet you, Ms. Martinez. Benjamin didn't give me the full intro. We weren't just classmates; we were in the same club and even dated."

Lila casually mentioned her past with Benjamin, clearly trying to stir things up.

Women have a sixth sense about these things. Amelia picked up on Lila's vibe and started thinking of how to handle it.

"Darling, why didn't you ever mention this friend?" Amelia asked, holding onto Benjamin's arm with a hint of reproach.

Benjamin looked uncomfortable, maybe a bit clueless. But he wasn't dumb; no guy in his right mind would introduce his ex to his current girlfriend.

Lila's eyes narrowed slightly, sensing Amelia's determination. She knew she wasn't dealing with a pushover.

Isabella was pleased with Amelia's approach. Michael, on the other hand, watched the scene unfold with curiosity, like he was enjoying a soap opera.

Even though men aren't usually as emotionally intuitive as women, Michael could still pick up on the underlying tension between Lila and Amelia.

By bringing up her past with Benjamin and their shared club activities, Lila was trying to stir up jealousy in Amelia and drive a wedge between her and Benjamin.

Amelia, by pointing out that Benjamin had never mentioned his ex, was subtly telling Lila that Benjamin had moved on and didn't care about her anymore.

Michael watched Lila closely, curious about her next move.

Lila didn't get angry at Amelia's words; instead, she complimented her. "Ms. Martinez, you are absolutely stunning! Only someone as beautiful as you could be a match for Benjamin, such an amazing surgeon!"

Amelia flipped her hair and smiled at Lila. "Thanks for the compliment. I think so too. I'm lucky to have found such a great guy like Benjamin. Right, darling?"

She looked at Benjamin as she spoke.

Benjamin was at a loss for words and awkwardly scratched his head. "Yeah, it's my luck too. And Lila, you're very beautiful as well."

A spark appeared in Lila's eyes as she walked over to Amelia and said with a smile, "I think we have a lot in common, Ms. Martinez. Standing together, we look like sisters."

"Are you implying that Benjamin chose me as a replacement for you?" Disgust flashed in Amelia's eyes as she stepped away from Lila.

But Benjamin shook his head. "No, Lila, Amelia looks nothing like you. In fact, I think she's even more beautiful."

Benjamin was being honest; he truly thought Amelia was more beautiful.

Amelia was naturally pleased, but Lila's expression darkened.

A flicker of emotion crossed Lila's face, but she quickly regained her composure. She patted Benjamin's shoulder and said with a smile, "You're still as funny as ever."

Lila tried to brush off the topic as a joke and smoothly transitioned to asking when they had arrived in the country.

Meanwhile, Isabella leaned over to Michael and whispered, "Why do I feel like you're not very happy? Have you noticed something?"

###chapter 357 Opposing the Lila Alliance

Isabella noticed Michael's face change when Lila brought up Benjamin's college days.

When Isabella asked about it, Michael just nodded.

"Remember when Lila said Benjamin's now a top-notch surgeon?" Michael asked quietly.

Isabella nodded. Of course, she remembered.

Michael went on, "Back in college, Benjamin was studying medicine, but no one really knew what he'd become. He was so low-key that no one knew his background. Lila started dating him because he was good-looking, though not as good-looking as me."

Isabella rolled her eyes at Michael's smug look and playfully tugged his ear.

"Yeah, yeah, you're handsome. But can you stop bragging for a second? I'm more interested in what happened next," Isabella said, rolling her eyes again.

Michael shrugged and continued, "Everyone thought he was just some poor student with no future. When graduation came around, Lila figured he was going nowhere, so she dumped him for the school leader's son. Benjamin was crushed."

Isabella quickly caught on. Lila must have seen how successful Benjamin had become and wanted to get back with him, pushing Amelia aside to be his girlfriend.

With that in mind, Isabella had another question.

She looked at Michael curiously and asked, "If Lila picked boyfriends based on looks, why didn't she go for you?"

Michael rolled his eyes. "Did you forget about Scarlett? She was always around, scaring off any girl who showed interest in me. I was single all through college."

Isabella laughed, covering her mouth. "Well, I guess I should thank Scarlett for saving me such a great husband."

Michael sighed and patted her hand. "What are you talking about? Why thank Scarlett? Even if someone had pursued me, I would've turned them down. I never found women like Lila attractive. Only someone as naive as Benjamin would fall for her."

Just then, the waiter started serving food to Benjamin and the others, and Benjamin looked pretty stressed about the tension between the two women.

The waiter gave him an out.

"Lila, let's eat first. We have plans later. How about we grab coffee another day?" Benjamin was hinting for Lila to leave.

Lila didn't want to go, but she knew it wasn't the right time to push her agenda.

"Alright, I won't bother you guys. Enjoy your meal, I'll head out." Lila waved and left the restaurant.

After she left, Benjamin sighed in relief, and Amelia let go of his arm.

"Come on, babe, don't give me that look. I haven't talked to Lila in ages," Benjamin said with a sheepish grin.

Amelia kept eating, her voice calm. "You don't need to explain, I trust you."

"But your face says otherwise," Benjamin muttered under his breath.

Isabella watched the awkward scene unfold, with Benjamin looking all stressed out while Amelia stayed cool as a cucumber. It was clear to everyone there was some tension, but Benjamin seemed clueless about what was really going on.

"Hey, babe, want something to drink? I found this coffee shop earlier, and their coffee is amazing. Want me to grab you some?" Michael suddenly asked Isabella.

Isabella was confused at first, but then she caught on to Michael's hint. She turned to Amelia and said, "Amelia, that coffee shop Michael mentioned is really good. Want to try some too?"

Amelia was surprised but quickly nodded. "Sure, let's give it a shot."

Michael gave Benjamin a look, and he got the message right away.

"You guys hang tight. I'll go get it. Be right back." Benjamin eagerly ran out, seeing it as a chance to score some points with Amelia.

As soon as Benjamin left, Amelia's calm facade crumbled.

"Ugh, Benjamin is so clueless. Sure, he complimented me, which was nice, but I can't stand seeing him all chummy with Lila! He should've just sent her packing," Amelia fumed.

Michael, still eating, said calmly, "Benjamin's a nice guy. He probably won't do what you expect, but I trust him. He knows what Lila's up to, so you don't have to worry about them getting back together."

Amelia sighed, "I trust him too, but he really needs to change his ways."

Isabella suddenly perked up, leaning in excitedly. "How about we form an Anti-Jerk Alliance? We can crush Lila's hopes and show her that Benjamin's off the market."

Amelia's eyes lit up. "That's a fantastic idea! With you two on board, it'll definitely work."

Michael shrugged, "I'm in. I always listen to my wife."

Amelia looked at Isabella with a hint of envy. "I wish Benjamin understood me like your husband does."

Michael said calmly, "Give Benjamin more chances. When I was trying to win over Isabella, Benjamin gave me a lot of advice. He's great with theory but not so much with practice. Lila messed with his head all through college, so he's kind of lost when it comes to love."

Hearing Michael's words, Amelia felt a pang of sympathy for Benjamin.

Just then, Benjamin came back with the coffee, and everyone quickly changed the subject.

###chapter 358 Annoying Woman

After dinner, they decided to hit up the most popular shopping street nearby to soak in some local vibes.

While they were browsing, Amelia clung to Benjamin's arm, making them look super close.

Benjamin was pretty stoked; it seemed like Amelia was stepping up her game because of Lila's sudden appearance.

Amelia wasn't dumb. She knew that if she kept being bratty and blaming Benjamin, it would just push him away and straight into Lila's arms.

Since Lila was trying to win Benjamin back with their old memories, Amelia figured she'd make him stay by creating new, sweet moments together.

When they wrapped up their shopping spree and got back to the hotel, they were shocked to see Lila standing there with a suitcase.

Lila looked just as surprised. "What are you guys doing here? Oh, right, you're staying at this hotel too. What a small world!"

Lila, all excited, rushed towards Benjamin like she was about to hug him.

Amelia frowned and stepped in front of Benjamin, while Isabella shoved Michael aside.

Lila instinctively hugged the guy in front of her but quickly realized something was off-this guy felt way more muscular than Benjamin.

"Have you hugged enough? Can you let go now? My wife is watching," Michael's cool voice cut through the moment.

Lila looked up and saw Michael's icy expression.

Frightened by his cold stare, Lila quickly let go and stepped back.

Michael moved to stand next to Isabella, glaring at her with annoyance.

"This is the first time I've seen someone push their husband away to help a friend," Michael grumbled.

Isabella casually patted his arm. "Of course, because I trust you won't get involved with this woman!"

Michael rolled his eyes. "Yeah, thanks for the vote of confidence."

Lila was taken aback that she had hugged Michael instead of Benjamin. Sure, Michael was good-looking, but his vibe made her think twice about getting close.

But when Lila tried to hug Benjamin again, she found Amelia already guarding him.

Lila was a bit miffed but didn't want to cause a scene.

"What a coincidence! It must be fate bringing us together. Got any plans for tomorrow?" Lila asked curiously.

"We're planning to go skiing," Benjamin said, then noticed Amelia shooting daggers at him with her eyes.

Benjamin blinked, realizing he might've messed up.

Lila's face lit up with excitement. "That's awesome! I came here just for the skiing! I heard the snow here is the best powder snow! Skiing here must be amazing! Let's hit the slopes together tomorrow. Since I'm solo, I can join you guys."

Amelia glared at Benjamin, hoping he'd say no.

But Benjamin just scratched his head awkwardly, not sure how to turn Lila down without hurting her feelings.

Amelia looked disappointed at Benjamin, then turned to Lila with a smile. "Sure, but just so you know, all four of us are couples. If you feel weird being the odd one out, maybe you can find another guy to join you."

Amelia was trying to hint that Lila shouldn't crash their couple time.

Lila got the hint but decided to ignore it. She wasn't about to let a little thing like pride get in the way of chasing after the guy who left her.

"No worries, maybe I'll find a great guy at the ski resort tomorrow. See you then." Lila waved, grabbed her room key, and headed for the elevator.

As soon as Lila was out of sight, Amelia stomped on Benjamin's foot and stormed off to the other elevator.

Benjamin winced in pain, hopping around a bit, then looked helplessly at Isabella and Michael.

"This isn't my fault. You know I'm kinda slow with this stuff. It was just a reflex. Besides, no matter what we plan, Lila's gonna tag along. It'd be even more awkward if she caught us lying, right?" Benjamin tried to explain, but Isabella just stomped her foot in frustration, crossed her arms, and got into the elevator.

"What's going on? Why are the girls so mad?" Benjamin asked, looking to Michael for answers.

Michael sighed. "Honestly, I think you're right. With how shameless Lila is, no matter what you say, she'd probably just camp outside your door and pretend to bump into you, hoping you'd invite her along."

Benjamin nodded eagerly. "Exactly! You get me."

Michael shook his head and then stepped on Benjamin's other foot.

"What the hell? Why are you copying Amelia?" Benjamin yelped, hopping on one foot and glaring at Michael.

Michael shrugged, looking a bit helpless. "Remember how my wife stomped her foot before getting into the elevator? She actually asked me to step on you. She felt too embarrassed to do it herself since you two aren't that close yet. So, I had to."

Benjamin stood there, stunned. "You guys have that level of understanding?"

Michael nodded. "Yep, that's love. When you really get it, you understand a woman's mind."

Michael patted Benjamin's shoulder. "You've got a lot to learn. Take it slow. For now, just focus on handling how Lila's gonna deal with Amelia tomorrow while skiing."

Benjamin pushed Michael's hand away, saying confidently, "No matter what Lila does, I'll back Amelia up."

Michael gave him a thumbs up. "Well said, you're finally catching on."

###chapter 359 Sneaking into Your Blanket

After getting back to the room, Benjamin flopped onto the bed, wide awake. Michael's words from earlier on the snowy mountain kept replaying in his head.

"When a woman says no, she actually means yes, got it?"

Benjamin glanced over at Amelia, who was fast asleep. After a moment of hesitation, he bit his lip and slowly lifted her blanket.

He moved carefully, his eyes glued to Amelia's face, watching her breathing. He'd stop if she stirred.

Her breathing stayed steady, and Benjamin let out a sigh of relief.

"Come on, Benjamin, you can do this. Amelia's been waiting for this, right?" he kept telling himself.

His nerves were so shot that he didn't even notice his hands shaking as he lifted the blanket. The trembling only made things harder. Amelia's eyebrows twitched slightly, but Benjamin missed it in the dim light.

"Just a little more, and I can get in," he thought, watching the blanket rise as he inched closer to Amelia.

Getting under a blanket with someone takes three steps: lift the blanket, get in, and cover up. But these simple steps felt like they took forever for Benjamin.

He reached out, gently touching the outside of Amelia's pajamas, feeling her warmth, which only made him more nervous. He paused, watching her closely. When she didn't wake up, he felt a bit more at ease and slowly slid under the blanket.

"Almost there. Come on, Benjamin, you got this," he kept encouraging himself.

After what felt like an eternity, Benjamin finally managed to get under Amelia's blanket, though it mostly covered her, leaving him only half-covered.

"Good thing the room's warm, so being half-covered won't be too bad," he thought, trying to reassure himself.

He turned to look at Amelia's peaceful face, feeling a wave of warmth wash over him.

"If only it could stay like this forever, just quietly watching her," he thought, smiling to himself. Feeling her warmth, he wanted to hug her but held back.

The human heart is greedy; once you get something, you always want more. Even though he was under her blanket and lying next to her, he wanted more, like holding her.

"Should I try to gently hold Amelia? What if she wakes up? No, she must be expecting this, right? But what if she questions me? How should I respond? 'I accidentally slipped in'?" Benjamin's mind raced, leaving him feeling completely lost.

He desperately tried to remember everything he'd learned, but his mind was a complete blank.

Just then, Amelia rolled over, draping her arm and leg over Benjamin.

Her sudden movement made him freeze up instantly.

Benjamin was a bundle of nerves, praying she wouldn't wake up or realize he had snuck under her blanket.

"Oh God, what do I do? Or better yet, what would Michael do? Damn it, why am I thinking about him? Amelia's my girlfriend!" His mind was racing, his body heating up, his breathing quickening, and his heart pounding.

The only silver lining was that Amelia's movement had pulled more of the blanket over him, covering his other half.

"Am I seriously thinking about the blanket right now? How do I talk to Amelia? What do I do next?" His tense body was trembling slightly.

Suddenly, he felt Amelia patting his chest.

"Benjamin, you're just like Michael said: all theory, no practice!" Amelia's annoyed voice broke the silence.

Benjamin was stunned. He turned to her and asked, "You weren't asleep?"

Rolling her eyes, Amelia said, "The way you lifted my blanket, if you'd done it any more, I could've done a backflip."

Embarrassed, Benjamin scratched his face, not expecting his carefulness to wake her.

Sighing, Amelia hugged him tightly and pulled the blanket more over him.

Excited, Benjamin hugged her back and looked at her face, asking, "So, are you okay with this now?"

Rolling her eyes again, Amelia kissed him on the corner of his mouth. "You're such a fool when it comes to love, or Lila wouldn't have tricked you. If I don't agree now, she might steal you away!"

"Darling, believe me, I have no feelings for Lila!" Benjamin said earnestly.

Amelia kissed him again, caressing his face. "I believe you. You're just not good at saying no. I'll be your shield against any woman who tries to get close."

Benjamin's mouth twitched, but he happily kissed her. "Thank you so much, darling."

Amelia smiled and hugged him tighter.

Meanwhile, outside the bedroom, Isabella and Michael had their ears pressed against the door, grinning.

"I knew they'd make progress tonight," Isabella whispered.

Michael nodded, "Eavesdropping really is a thrill!"

They smiled at each other and headed back to their own bedroom.

###chapter 360 Embarrassing Moments in College

The next morning, Isabella and the gang spotted Lila hanging out in the lobby.

"Hey, Benjamin and crew, morning! You guys had breakfast yet?" Lila called out, waving.

'I really want to know what she's up to,' Amelia thought.

"Morning, Lila. Yeah, we've already eaten. Have you been waiting for us?" Amelia asked, linking her arm with Benjamin's.

Lila grinned. "Yep, I made plans with Benjamin yesterday to go skiing together."

'When did Benjamin agree to that?' Amelia wondered, keeping a smile on her face.

Benjamin frowned a bit. He wasn't great at saying no, but he wasn't about to let Lila make stuff up.

"I didn't agree to go skiing with you. We just invited you to join our group. If you have a guy friend, bring him along," Benjamin said calmly.

Lila's smile faltered for a second, but she quickly recovered. "How could I find another guy? It's my first time here, and I don't know many people. You're the only one I trust to keep me safe."

Amelia looked up at Benjamin and said, "I heard there are lots of tour groups that make sure tourists are safe."

Benjamin nodded at Lila. "We're all couples here, so we might not be able to keep an eye on you. If you're worried about being left out, you can join a tour group. There should be plenty of handsome single guys."

Benjamin's message was clear. Any sensible woman would take the hint and back off. But Lila didn't see it that way.

'Why does Benjamin keep bringing up other guys? Is he still mad I dumped him in college?' Lila wondered.

"No, I don't like hanging out with other guys. I'll just stick with you guys. If I fall, at least you can call an ambulance," Lila shrugged, smiling at Benjamin.

Benjamin sighed, clearly frustrated with Lila's persistence.

"Alright then, let's go. Hopefully, there's still room in the car," Amelia said, grabbing Benjamin's hand and heading for the door.

Lila followed right behind them without missing a beat.

Michael and Isabella trailed behind.

"Looks like after making things official last night, Benjamin's totally on Amelia's side," Isabella whispered to Michael, pleased with Benjamin's behavior.

Michael nodded. "From what I know about Benjamin, he's probably really annoyed right now. If Lila keeps pushing, he's definitely going to snap. Just because he's got a good temper doesn't mean he doesn't have a breaking point."

Isabella chuckled. "I'd love to see Benjamin lose it. By the way, since you went to the same college, have you ever seen him blow up before?"

Michael nodded. "Oh yeah, I've seen him lose it. Once, he got into it with a professor over a project. They almost threw punches, but Benjamin held back since the professor was old. Instead, he snuck into the professor's house and shaved his cat bald."

Isabella's jaw dropped. "Are you serious? Benjamin did that?"

Michael nodded. "Yep, I was the lookout."

Isabella couldn't help but laugh. She never expected Michael and Benjamin to pull off something so wild.

"So, what happened after that? Was the professor furious? And what about the poor cat?" Isabella asked, eager to hear the rest.

Michael shrugged. "Benjamin got in trouble with the school and had to clean the pet hospital for a week as punishment."

"Your school had a pet hospital?" Isabella asked, intrigued.

Michael nodded. "Yeah, I originally wanted to study computer science, but Benjamin convinced me to study medicine. He always felt like he was in my shadow and wanted to beat me at something. And he did. He's way better at medicine than I am, both human and veterinary."

"I had no idea you studied medicine! That's impressive. Is there anything you can't do?" Isabella asked, curious about Michael's talents.

Michael grinned. "I know a lot, but there's plenty I can't do. For example, I can't give birth to a child, you know, lacking the necessary equipment."

Isabella rolled her eyes and playfully pinched his waist. "Are you hinting at something? It's not my fault we haven't had kids yet! I've been checked out, and everything's fine. So why can't I get pregnant?"

She patted her stomach, feeling frustrated.

Michael wrapped an arm around her shoulders and smiled. "It's okay, babe. No need to stress. Getting pregnant isn't always easy, but we'll keep trying and it'll happen."

Isabella gave him a look. "You think it's just about your body? Let's give it another shot tonight then."

Michael hesitated for a second, then nodded. He was game for another try.

Isabella chuckled. As they neared the parking lot, something clicked in her mind.

She frowned and turned to Michael. "Wait a minute. Didn't you say you and Benjamin were high school classmates? Why have you only been talking about college stuff, and it sounds like you two grew up together?"

Michael froze, thinking, 'Crap, I messed up.'

Isabella tilted her head. "If anyone grew up with Benjamin, it would be John's uncle. Could it be that you..."

###chapter 361 The Past Michael Refuses to Mention

Isabella shot Michael a suspicious glance.

Michael gulped, feeling a bit jittery.

Right then, Benjamin's voice cut through the tension.

"Everyone's in the car, what are you two still doing here?" Benjamin urged them to hurry up.

Michael's eyes lit up, and he quickly pulled Benjamin aside. "I told Isabella we were just high school buddies, but I mentioned college because of Lila. Now she thinks we're lying. You need to explain."

Benjamin was momentarily stunned, staring at Michael in shock. His eyes seemed to say, 'Your lie got busted, and now you want me to cover for you?'

But Benjamin knew he had to come up with something. 'Since you started this mess, don't blame me,' he thought, smirking slightly.

Isabella watched Benjamin, waiting for an explanation.

Benjamin smiled at her and said, "Actually, Michael and I go way back. We were not just high school classmates but also college buddies. We even grew up together. Our families lived far apart, so we mostly hung out at school."

His words made sense to Isabella, explaining why Michael had known him since childhood.

Benjamin paused, rubbing his hands, looking a bit embarrassed.

"Why didn't we mention college? Well, we both have some pretty embarrassing stories from back then. Too humiliating to share, so we agreed to keep it between us. That's why he only mentioned high school." Benjamin finished, glancing at Michael.

"Yeah, that's it. We know some pretty embarrassing stuff about each other," Michael quickly nodded in agreement.

Isabella eyed Benjamin skeptically, thinking the story sounded fishy.

"Is that so? Then tell me, what embarrassing things did Michael do in college?" Isabella asked calmly.

Michael froze, unable to recall any embarrassing moments.

But Benjamin grinned.

"Do you really want to hear about your husband's embarrassing moments? Aren't you worried he'll be mortified?" Benjamin smirked, turning to Michael.

Michael snorted, "Isabella's my wife. She can hear anything. Go ahead, spill some of my embarrassing stories. Let's see what you got."

Isabella looked at Benjamin expectantly.

Benjamin chuckled, "Isabella, you might not know this, but your husband used to wear women's clothing. And not just any clothing-lace camisole pajamas."

Michael was stunned, and so was Isabella.

Michael racked his brain until he remembered an embarrassing incident buried deep in his memory.

"I remember it was April Fools' Day. We came back from playing basketball, all sweaty. The bathroom in our dorm was busted, so Michael had to use the school's public bathroom. We thought it would be funny to swap his clothes in the locker with a lace camisole," Benjamin finished, glancing at Michael with a polite smile.

Isabella burst into laughter, starting with a giggle and ending up squatting on the ground, clutching her stomach. She pictured serious Michael strutting from the bathroom to the dorm in a lace camisole.

"Come on, why'd you stop? Keep going!" Isabella urged after catching her breath.

Benjamin shook his head, "I think you can guess the rest. Someone took a photo and was planning to post it on the school forum, but his admirers reported it."

Michael sneered and shook his head. "I remember now. You didn't continue because the ending was too much for everyone."

Isabella looked up, curious, "Is there a twist to this story?"

Benjamin looked embarrassed, wanting to cover Michael's mouth, but Michael pushed him aside.

Michael smirked, "Those idiots who pranked me left me with that lace camisole, making me walk back to the dorm in it. A lot of people saw me, including those fools. I knew my reputation was shot, so I decided to take them down with me."

Isabella's curiosity peaked, wanting to know what Michael did.

Benjamin looked even more embarrassed, almost grim.

"You guys take your time chatting; I need to hit the road," Benjamin said, heading to the driver's seat.

Isabella and Michael walked slowly towards the car.

As they walked, Michael said, "Among those who mocked me, Benjamin and his friends laughed the hardest. So, I walked up to them. I kissed each of them on the face and then hugged them as we entered the dorm together. Now, our entire dorm's reputation was tarnished."

Isabella looked at Michael in shock, then gave him a thumbs up. "Darling, you're amazing! Turning the tables like that!"

Michael smiled faintly, "Honestly, I don't care much about others' mockery. It was April Fools' Day, and I don't care about others' opinions of me. That's why I didn't remember this incident."

Isabella chose to believe Michael because she felt he was that kind of person.

"Can you tell me more about your college experiences?" Isabella asked, getting into the car, her eyes shining with excitement.

"No way!" Benjamin and Michael said in unison.

Isabella pouted, "Just now you said you didn't care! You guys are so hypocritical."

They drove off and soon arrived at the ski resort. After changing into their ski gear, they hit the slopes.

However, Benjamin didn't feel as good during this skiing trip.

###chapter 362 The Bet

The beginner ski slope was filled with the sound of someone screaming.

"Benjamin, help me! I'm gonna fall! This is way too fast, I can't control it!" Lila yelled, gripping her ski poles for dear life.

Benjamin's face darkened as he clenched his fists. He was so over helping Lila. He'd already helped her a bunch of times and even suggested she get a coach, but she refused and kept skiing like a maniac.

Amelia could sense Benjamin's frustration. Honestly, she was pretty annoyed too. If Benjamin wasn't so nice and bad at saying no, she would've started yelling by now.

"Who says Lila can't ski? Every time she falls, she lands right in Benjamin's arms. Is that what she calls not being able to ski?" Amelia muttered angrily, gripping her ski pole, wishing she could whack Lila with it.

Isabella and Michael stood nearby, sipping hot coffee, watching Lila fall into Benjamin's arms yet again.

Amelia couldn't help but complain when she saw Isabella and Michael just chilling. "Come on, we're the Anti-Lila Alliance! You can't leave me to deal with this alone!"

Isabella shrugged, "Amelia, why don't you go help Lila? If you teach her, you can keep her away from Benjamin. He's good at skiing, so we can hit the intermediate slope while you two stay here."

Michael nodded. "My wife's got a point."

Amelia blinked. "Then why don't you go help her, Isabella? That way, I can hang out with Benjamin and work on our relationship."

Isabella stayed quiet, and Michael quickly pulled her into his arms, saying, "Why do you need to build a relationship? Don't we, as a couple, need to work on ours too?"

Amelia rolled her eyes and walked towards Benjamin and Lila.

Isabella and Michael watched her go.

Michael looked at Isabella curiously and asked, "Are you sure about this?"

Isabella nodded. "Benjamin's too nice. Someone who can't say no and is afraid of hurting others isn't gonna last long in this world."

Actually, Isabella and Michael had a plan. They wanted Benjamin to see Lila's true colors, make him reject her, and stop her from clinging to them.

"Are you sure your plan will work? Will Lila really do that?" Michael asked, curious.

Earlier, when Michael and Isabella were chatting, Isabella suggested a plan: let Amelia teach Lila to ski, Lila would fake an injury, then blame Amelia, saying she didn't teach her well, and maybe even accuse her of pushing her.

Isabella nodded, smiling at Michael. "What's wrong? Don't you trust my instincts? Wanna bet on it?"

Michael grinned. "You're so sure of yourself. As your husband, I gotta believe you."

Isabella gave him a playful glare. "That's no fun! Say you don't believe me, and then we can make a bet."

Michael's lips twitched, smiling helplessly at her antics.

"Alright, fine. I don't believe you. Let's bet, say, $100?" Michael suggested.

Isabella nodded. "Deal, $100 it is."

For them, $100 was pocket change. This was just a fun game between them, and neither cared about the amount.

Meanwhile, Amelia had already suggested to Benjamin that she teach Lila how to ski.

Benjamin was hesitant, but Amelia was determined.

Lila seemed to catch on. At first, she looked a bit annoyed at Amelia's suggestion, but then she nodded.

"Benjamin, you go enjoy the other slopes. I know you love this sport, and I've been holding you back. I think Ms. Martinez will be a great teacher." Lila smiled at Amelia.

Lila's smile seemed fine, but Amelia had a bad feeling.

"Alright, I'll head to the other slopes. Dear, take care of Lila," Benjamin said and took off.

"Ms. Donovan, come with me. I'll teach you how to brake first." Amelia led Lila to the edge of the slope, where it was less crowded.

"Okay, Ms. Martinez." Lila smiled mischievously behind Amelia's back.

After leaving the beginner slope, Benjamin was planning to hit the intermediate or advanced slopes, but he ran into Michael and Isabella.

"Aren't you two skiing?" Benjamin asked with a smile.

Isabella shook her head. "Skiing's not as fun as watching a show!"

Benjamin was taken aback and looked around in surprise. "What show?"

Michael said casually, "The drama of the current and former fighting over a guy."

Benjamin quickly caught on.

He glared at them in annoyance. "If you're bored, go ski instead of watching a show. Those girls get along fine."

"Are you sure about that? How about we make a bet?" Isabella smirked.

Benjamin looked at her warily. "What do you want to bet on?"

"Let's bet on the latest fashion item." Isabella smiled and explained their bet.

"You bet $100, and it turns into a luxury item with you? Well, I don't think Lila would do something like that anyway." Benjamin shrugged, not caring about the bet since he could afford those luxury items.

Just as Benjamin agreed to Isabella's bet, a scream came from the beginner slope.

"Oh my god, I think my leg is broken! Can someone help me?" It was Lila's voice.

###chapter 363 Detached Benjamin

Benjamin sprinted over to Lila and Amelia when he heard Lila's cry.

Michael and Isabella were right on his heels.

Michael leaned in and whispered to Isabella, "Looks like you were right, Lila's hurt. Seems like you're halfway to winning that bet."

Isabella chuckled, "Just wait. Lila's gonna cry to Benjamin, saying she's too clumsy and always messing up, which made Amelia mad and push her. Then she'll hope Benjamin won't blame Amelia."

"And then Amelia will argue, but Benjamin won't believe her and blame her instead, right?" Michael grinned.

Isabella shrugged, "Pretty much."

By now, they had reached Lila and Amelia. Lila was on the ground, clutching her foot, while Amelia stood there looking worried.

"What happened? How'd you get hurt?" Benjamin asked, frowning as he crouched down to check on Lila.

"I don't know, she just fell all of a sudden," Amelia said, looking innocent and spreading her hands.

With tears in her eyes, Lila said, "Don't blame Ms. Martinez. It's my fault for being so clumsy and always making mistakes. She got mad and pushed me, but I didn't expect the snow to be so slippery. I twisted my ankle."

Amelia's eyes widened in anger. "How can you say that? Your fall has nothing to do with me. Don't blame me."

Lila gave a bitter smile, "I don't have low blood sugar, so why did I suddenly fall? If you don't want to admit it, then fine. After all, I asked you to teach me skiing."

Fuming, Amelia snapped, "You're something else, pretending to be weak and trying to blame me. Benjamin, do you believe her?"

Benjamin didn't answer. He just focused on Lila's ankle. "It's not a big deal, no dislocation, just a sprain. Rest for a few days and you'll be fine."

Amelia felt both angry and let down by Benjamin's silence.

Isabella walked over to Amelia, gently pulled her aside, and said with a smile, "Don't push him to choose now. Benjamin knows what to do. Tell me what happened."

Amelia nodded. "When I was teaching Lila to ski, she kept asking about how Benjamin and I met. I told her, but she mocked me, saying I didn't really understand who Benjamin loves. I got mad and argued with her."

"Maybe she wasn't trying to argue but to provoke you into hitting her, so she'd have a reason to fall," Isabella said, glancing at Lila on the ground with a light smile.

Lila looked up, glaring at Isabella. "I know you and Amelia are close, but you shouldn't believe everything she says. It's not what you think."

"Well, if we want to know what really happened, we can just ask some of the tourists around here. With so many people at this ski resort, someone must've heard your conversation with Amelia," Michael said casually, wrapping an arm around Isabella.

Lila's eyes darted nervously. She wasn't sure if anyone had overheard her argument with Amelia.

"You're all Amelia's friends, ganging up on me. Benjamin, take me to the medical station. I need to calm down," Lila pleaded.

"I still want to ski. I don't have time to take you," Benjamin replied, standing up.

Lila was stunned by Benjamin's response.

Amelia also looked at Benjamin in surprise.

Benjamin waved to a nearby staff member, and soon they arrived with a stretcher.

"She's got a sprained foot. Take her to the hospital; she can pay," Benjamin said calmly.

The staff nodded and lifted Lila onto the stretcher. At that moment, Lila finally realized what was happening.

As the staff prepared to leave with the stretcher, Lila suddenly grabbed Benjamin's sleeve.

"Benjamin, aren't you coming with me? I got injured because of your girlfriend!" Lila exclaimed.

"How did you get injured? Don't you know? Or do you think your little tricks can fool a surgeon like me? Lila, don't take me for a fool," Benjamin's face turned cold, losing its usual gentleness.

Benjamin shook off Lila's hand, looking at her calmly. "I don't have feelings for you anymore. We were done when you betrayed me. I just held onto past sentiments and didn't want to scold you. If you dare to ruin my relationship again, don't blame me for being rude."

Benjamin's icy gaze made Lila feel a hint of fear; his demeanor was surprisingly similar to Michael's.

Benjamin waved his hand, and the two staff members carried Lila away from the ski resort.

After Lila left, Benjamin approached Amelia, took her hand, and smiled, "Darling, I never doubted you."

Amelia was very satisfied with Benjamin's response and lowered her head, a hint of shyness on her face.

By this time, Isabella and Michael had walked to the other side. They headed towards the intermediate ski slope.

"Looks like I lost. I'll give you $100 after we change clothes," Michael said with a smile.

"Don't forget to remind Benjamin about my jewelry," Isabella reminded with a grin.

As they reached the intermediate ski slope, Michael suddenly asked, "How do you understand what Lila is thinking?"

Isabella shook her head. "I don't understand what Lila is thinking, but I guess bitches think alike. Back when Bianca tried to frame me in front of John, she used the same tricks. So I understand their tactics. But John, that idiot, is not like Benjamin. Forget about him, a fool and a bitch, let them live together forever and not harm others."

***Valentine's Day Special***

"What do you want to show me? Why all the secrecy?" Isabella asked, her curiosity piqued as she held Michael's hand, following his lead. She knew whatever it was, it would be a delightful surprise because Michael never let her down.

"We're here! Happy Valentine's Day!" Michael said, removing her blindfold.

As the darkness lifted, Isabella gasped, covering her mouth in astonishment at the sight before her.

The sky danced with deep blue ripples, like a flowing river of light suspended in the heavens. It was as if the Northern Lights were weaving a tapestry of color, painting the night with ethereal brushstrokes, while the stars twinkled like diamonds, adding their own brilliance to the cosmic canvas.

"This is like a fairy tale," Isabella exclaimed in delight.

Michael held Isabella's hand as they walked through the snow, their feet crunching on the thick blanket beneath them. The cold night couldn't extinguish the warmth in their hearts. Isabella reached up toward the sky, as if the auroras were flickering in her palms. She watched the beams of light dance above, her eyes sparkling with their brilliance.

Seeing Isabella so happy, Michael knew his gift was perfect. Fancy jewelry never caught her interest, but this fairy-tale innocence suited her perfectly.

"Sweetheart, this is just so beautiful! Thank you! How did you know there would be auroras tonight?" Isabella said, her voice trembling with emotion, almost on the verge of tears.

"I did a lot of research to find this spot. It seems even the heavens are celebrating our love," Michael replied with a smile, wrapping his arms around Isabella from behind. Together, they stood in awe of the enchanting scene before them.

"How can I ever repay you for such a wonderful gift?" Isabella wondered, feeling a bit overwhelmed.

"Darling, you don't need to worry about that. When I'm holding you, I already have the whole world," Michael's gentle voice whispered in Isabella's ear.
"Sweetheart, you're my world too," Isabella replied, turning to wrap her arms around Michael's neck, pulling him in for a deep, heartfelt kiss.

The auroras in the sky became more vibrant, casting a magical glow that wrapped around them, adding an extra touch of romance to the moment.
###chapter 364 Bianca Starts a Company

Michael pulled Isabella into a gentle hug after hearing what she said.

"Sorry for being late. If I had come into your life sooner, maybe..." Michael started, but Isabella cut him off.

"Babe, honestly, if you had shown up earlier, I probably wouldn't have been interested in you at all," Isabella said with a smile, touching his face.

Michael blinked, thinking he might have misheard.

Isabella softly stroked his cheek. "I had plenty of handsome guys chasing me back then. But I didn't care for any of them. If you had come around earlier, it might have been the same story."

Michael was surprised, then let out a wry laugh. "Well, that actually makes sense."

Isabella kissed his cheek. "Fate has its own way of working things out. If I hadn't been hurt by Bianca and John, I wouldn't have met someone as amazing as you. I just had to go through the pain first to get to the good part."

Michael felt a warmth spread through him after hearing her words. He realized their meeting was a result of Isabella being deeply hurt by John, leading her to marry a random guy, and he was lucky enough to be that guy, bringing them to where they were now.

It was like a scene from a crazy romantic comedy.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, John and Bianca, who had been insulted by Isabella, were together.

John came home from work, took off his coat, and walked into the living room.

The cozy living room had a soft carpet, with a chaise lounge at the edge. Bianca was lying on it, barefoot, holding a parenting book.

Bianca put down the book and smiled at John as he walked in. "Hey, you're back."

John nodded, walked over to Bianca, and gently touched her face.

"Don't tease me, your hands are cold," Bianca said, playfully tapping his hand.

John chuckled, then placed his hand on her belly and asked, "How are you feeling? Any discomfort today?"

Bianca shook her head, a maternal glow on her face. "I'm healthy, and I can feel the baby is too. It's just my emotions are a bit all over the place."

A hint of sadness crossed her eyes.

John frowned slightly. "Is it because of your mom? I've got people looking for her, we should hear something soon. Try not to worry too much; she's an adult."

Bianca's father had committed suicide, and her mother had gone insane and disappeared. John had been sending people to find her.

In reality, Bianca knew her mother wasn't missing but was being held captive as leverage against her.

"I'm worried about my mom, but that's not what I wanted to talk about," Bianca said, settling back in the chair.

"What's wrong then?" John asked, gently massaging her head to help her relax.

"I just feel so bored staying at home and want to do something," Bianca said.

John raised an eyebrow, "Do you want to go out? I can have the bodyguards take you. Or is there something specific you want to do?"

Bianca looked at him with a smile, "Babe, I want to start a company."

John leaned back on the sofa, waving his hand casually, "What kind of company? I have so many already. You could be a manager or take a senior position in any of them."

Bianca shook her head. "I want to start something new. You lost a chunk of your assets in that bet with your grandfather, and I want to help you out."

John was about to say that with Bianca's skills, starting a company wouldn't make much of a difference. But considering she was pregnant and sensitive, he held back.

"Honestly, I don't care much about that loss. The rest of my assets are still substantial, and we can always make more. But if you want to start a company, I'll support you. What kind of company are you thinking about?" John asked.

"I want to start a clothing company, create a new fashion brand," Bianca said, her eyes lighting up.

John frowned slightly. He remembered Isabella had a big clothing company. Was Bianca trying to compete with her?

Bianca seemed to read his mind and smiled, "I chose fashion for a reason. Isabella once said I had no business sense, and maybe she's right. But as a woman, I have a natural eye for fashion. I can always tell if an outfit looks good."

After a moment of thought, John nodded. Building a luxury brand wasn't easy, but if Bianca was passionate about it, he could help.

"Alright, I'll have someone handle the trademark and set up the company. Where do you want to base it?" John asked.

Bianca smiled, "You have so many buildings. Just find me a vacant floor. I don't need a big team for my small company."

John sighed in relief, thinking she might want to set up near Isabella's company. It seemed Bianca had thought this through and wasn't looking to provoke Isabella.

"No problem, we have plenty of vacant floors. I'll have someone pick the best one for you," John said, smiling at her.

"Great, dear. I'm going to rest for a bit. Being pregnant makes me so tired," Bianca yawned and headed to the bedroom.

Once in the room, Bianca's expression turned serious. "John, are you worried about me clashing with Isabella again and causing trouble, or that I might develop feelings for her again?"

John's thoughts were too naive; Bianca had never let go of her hatred for Isabella. Moving on wasn't that simple.

###chapter 365 Familiar Woman

Isabella had no clue that Bianca was gunning for her again. After their trip to the ski resort, they headed straight back to the hotel. Skiing was a blast, but it was tiring.

The ski gear was warm but not exactly breathable, so they ended up sweating a lot. Michael went to take a shower, while Isabella and Amelia decided to hit the hot springs.

On their way, they bumped into Elise again. Elise, who almost got the wrong idea about Isabella because of some guy, was still hanging around the hotel, sitting in the lobby with a bottle of wine.

Isabella found a staff member and asked, "Why is she still here? Wasn't she here to catch a cheater? Is her husband still around?"

The staff member shook their head. "Her husband checked out on the first day. She booked a room here too. Said she wanted to relax and travel."

"But she doesn't look like she's having a good time," Amelia chimed in.

"Hopefully, she can move on soon. Let's hit the hot springs," Isabella said, deciding not to worry about Elise anymore.

Isabella and Amelia soaked in the hot spring pool, enjoying a relaxing bath. When they were done, Benjamin called Amelia, saying he had a surprise for her.

"I don't want any surprises right now, I just want to crash in bed," Amelia said, rolling her eyes and hanging up.

Isabella laughed and shook her head, "Come on, stop showing off. You're grinning like a Cheshire cat. Go see what surprise he's got for you."

With a big smile, Amelia quickly left.

Isabella changed into dry clothes and headed back to her room.

As she got into the elevator, a hand stopped the doors from closing.

The doors opened, and in stumbled Elise, reeking of alcohol.

Isabella wrinkled her nose at the smell. Elise noticed and gave a goofy smile. "Sorry, miss. Can you help me to my room? Here's my key."

Elise was speaking a foreign language, but she had a translation device on her ear and chest, translating her words perfectly.

After fumbling around, Elise found her room key and handed it to Isabella.

Isabella looked at the key, confused, and the next moment, Elise collapsed on her, clearly having drunk too much.

"Don't pass out now, you're pretty heavy," Isabella muttered, but Elise didn't budge.

Isabella glanced at the room number on the key card, and when the elevator arrived, she helped Elise to her room.

Isabella opened the door and guided Elise inside. "You're in your room now, get some rest."

Isabella helped Elise onto the bed. As Elise lay down, she groaned and then opened her eyes.

"Thanks. I didn't expect you to help me after I misunderstood you last time," Elise said with a chuckle.

Isabella rolled her eyes and rubbed her sore arms. "It's nothing. If there's nothing else, I'll be on my way."

Just as Isabella was about to leave, Elise called out.

"Wait, can you stay and chat with me?" Elise's voice had a hint of pleading.

After a moment of hesitation, Isabella nodded.

Isabella could probably guess what Elise wanted to talk about-it had to be about her and her husband.

Actually, Isabella felt pretty bad for Elise, and since she had some free time, she figured she could sit and listen for a bit.

As Elise lay on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling, she started talking about her and her husband's love story and all the beautiful plans she had for their future.

"But it was all a lie. He deceived me. He's a jerk! That jerk got married abroad without telling me! Damn it, from now on, I'm only marrying someone local, never someone from abroad!" Elise finished, tears streaming down her face.

Isabella furrowed her brows, thinking about some mysterious info she had heard. Someone had told her that Michael got married abroad, but she had dismissed it.

Elise sat up and looked at Isabella. "Your husband loves you. I hope you never go through what I did. God bless you."

Elise burst into tears again.

Isabella handed Elise a tissue, exchanged a few casual words with her, and then left the room.

Once Isabella was gone, Elise's sorrow vanished.

Elise took off the translation device, tossed it on the bed, and made a call.

"I've done as planned. I should have planted the seed of doubt in her heart," Elise smirked, speaking fluent Avalonian.

A voice came from the other end of the phone, "You did well. I'll transfer the money to you next. Are you heading back to your country?"

Elise shook her head. "There are still many fun places here. I want to keep traveling."

"Have a pleasant journey." Scarlett hung up the phone and transferred the agreed payment.

After finishing everything, Scarlett stretched lazily and chuckled softly, "Isabella, I'm curious to see how you'll compete with me this time."

Just as Scarlett finished speaking, her phone rang again, showing an unfamiliar number.

Scarlett answered the call, and the voice on the other end left her stunned.

"Is that you? How did you get my number?" Scarlett asked, furrowing her brow.

A deep male voice replied, "It's not difficult for me. I heard my brother rejected you. Do I have a chance?"

###chapter 366 Isabella's Question

Scarlett smirked at the voice on the other end. "Ryan, you don't stand a chance. You're not even worth a dog's time."

Ryan Williams sighed over the phone, "Only someone like you would compare my brother to a dog."

Scarlett was taken aback and snapped back, "Don't twist my words, you know I didn't mean it like that."

"Yeah, I get it, but even a dog wouldn't want you," Ryan mocked a few more times before hanging up.

Scarlett was so mad she almost threw her phone.

"Ryan, you can't even compare to your brother," Scarlett muttered angrily. She poured herself a drink to celebrate her plan and blow off some steam, then slammed the door on her way out.

Isabella walked into the bedroom. Michael was no longer in the bathroom. She didn't know or care where he had gone.

Isabella sat on the edge of the bed, pulled out her phone, and opened a hidden album to find the photo she had saved.

In the photo, Michael was holding hands with a woman, smiling brightly. Although the woman's face was pixelated, her figure and demeanor suggested she was a beauty.

Just then, there was a knock on the door. Isabella quickly put away the photo.

"Who is it, Amelia?" Isabella opened the door to find Amelia and invited her in.

Amelia glanced around the room and didn't see Michael. She smiled and said, "I used to just barge in without knocking, worried I'd interrupt something. Where's Michael?"

Isabella shook her head, "No idea. Do you have something to tell me? By the way, didn't Benjamin mention a surprise for you? What is it?"

Isabella looked at Amelia curiously.

Amelia casually played with her hair, and Isabella noticed her new earrings.

"Just some ordinary jewelry. Men only know how to give clothes, jewelry, and cosmetics," Amelia complained, but her smile gave away her happiness.

Isabella rolled her eyes, "It's already good if men give you those things. What else do you expect? Some guys can't even tell lipstick shades apart."

Amelia held Isabella's hand and smiled, "What about Michael? Can he tell lipstick shades apart?"

Isabella nodded, "He knows more lipstick shades than I do."

Isabella had no idea that Michael was actually her former boss at the cosmetics company. Of course, he knew shades.

Then Isabella seemed to remember something and asked Amelia seriously, "Amelia, I need to ask you something, and you have to be honest with me."

Amelia nodded. "Shoot."

Isabella took a deep breath and asked, staring into Amelia's eyes, "Do you think Michael really loves me?"

Amelia was stunned by the question. She blinked a few times and asked in surprise, "Why are you asking this? Did you have a fight with Michael?"

Isabella shook her head, "We haven't really fought since we got married."

Amelia tilted her head, giving Isabella a once-over before reaching out to touch her forehead.

Isabella pushed Amelia's hand away, annoyed. "I'm not sick, I just need to ask this."

Rolling her eyes, Amelia said, "I don't know why you're asking, but there's something you need to understand."

"What?" Isabella asked, confused.

"When you were going through tough times, did Michael ever run away?" Amelia asked seriously.

Isabella fell silent.

She thought of John. Even when John was being a jerk, Michael never backed down. Sometimes she wished Michael would just give up, but he always stood by her, encouraging her.

Amelia's words hit home.

"Remember when you were fighting John for the company shares? Everyone underestimated you. How many execs were ready to side with John to strip you of power? But Michael always had your back. Wasn't he afraid of John?" Amelia's words reaffirmed Isabella's thoughts.

"I never doubted him, it's just that something happened earlier that made me think," Isabella sighed with a smile and then told Amelia about taking the drunk Elise back to her room.

"Don't worry about other people's problems. Some things we don't need to get involved in." Amelia gently hugged Isabella.

Isabella narrowed her eyes, looking thoughtful.

It all seemed too coincidental-meeting Elise on the first day at the hotel, hearing about the pitfalls of international marriages, then getting photos of Michael's supposed affair, and finally, taking the drunk Elise back to her room where Elise warned her about international marriages.

It felt like fate was warning her, but all these coincidences together didn't seem random.

Isabella and Amelia chatted briefly, and soon after, there was a knock on the door, and Michael walked in.

Amelia, seeing the flowers in Michael's hand, tactfully stood up from the edge of the bed.

"Looks like someone has something to say to his wife, so I'll leave you two alone. See you tomorrow," Amelia gave Isabella a knowing look and then left the room.

After Amelia left, Michael handed the bouquet of flowers to Isabella.

"My dear, do you like these flowers?" Michael asked with a smile.

Isabella hugged the bouquet and nodded. The red roses symbolized fiery passion and were indeed beautiful.

"Why is there a small gift box on top?" Isabella suddenly noticed a small gift box on top of the bouquet. She picked it up, opened it, and found a beautiful necklace inside.

"Why the sudden gift?" Isabella looked at Michael, surprised.

Michael shrugged, "Don't look at me, this is Benjamin losing a bet to you. As for the flowers, they cost me $100."

###chapter 367 Have You Ever Lied to Me?

Isabella, Michael, and Benjamin had a bet going on about whether Lila would frame Amelia or not.

Turns out, Isabella's got a knack for handling jerks.

Benjamin, being a man of his word, bought the latest necklace from the boutique. Then he realized his girlfriend, Amelia, had never gotten such a gift before, so he grabbed a pair of earrings too.

Back at the hotel, Benjamin handed the necklace to Michael. But Michael thought just a necklace was too plain, so he hit up a nearby flower shop for a bouquet. That's why he wasn't around earlier.

"I didn't expect you to give me the $100 like this!" Isabella rolled her eyes, pretending to be annoyed, but her look was full of affection.

"Well, money's meant to be spent, so I figured I'd get you some flowers. Consider it me paying up on our bet," Michael grinned, walking over to Isabella with the necklace box in hand.

"Let me help you put it on," Michael said, smiling as he held out the necklace.

Isabella didn't say no. She turned around, and Michael fastened the beautiful necklace around her neck.

"Do I look good with this on?" Isabella asked, turning back to face him.

Michael nodded and clapped his hands, exaggerating, "It's amazing. This necklace only looks perfect because you're wearing it."

"You always know how to sweet-talk," Isabella rolled her eyes again and headed to the bathroom to admire the necklace in the mirror.

Michael followed her, standing behind her and gently wrapping his arms around her waist. "Babe, you're beautiful no matter what you wear-or don't wear."

Isabella playfully tapped his hand. "I like the first part, but let's skip the second part!"

Michael chuckled, about to say something, but Isabella turned to look at him.

"Is there something you're hiding from me?" she suddenly asked.

Michael was caught off guard. She'd never asked him something so direct before.

He wanted to tell her he had never hidden anything from her. Except for his true identity.

But the question felt like a fishbone stuck in his throat, making him hesitate.

Seeing his hesitation, Isabella asked again, "Have you ever lied to me about your feelings?"

This time, Michael didn't hesitate at all and shook his head. "Babe, I swear, you're the only woman I've ever loved."

Isabella smiled, caressing his cheek. "That's all I needed to hear. I feel like you might be hiding something, but even between husband and wife, a little mystery is okay. I won't push you, as long as you haven't betrayed me in love."

Isabella smiled, kissed Michael on the cheek, and then walked out of the bathroom.

Michael stayed behind, furrowing his brow, deep in thought.

'Why did Isabella ask me that? Is she onto my real identity? Is she giving me a chance to come clean?' Michael's mind was racing.

"I don't think she's figured out your identity, but something's definitely making her doubt your love," Benjamin analyzed.

After leaving the bathroom, Michael found Benjamin and shared his confusion, hoping for some advice.

"But what could have happened? I thought our relationship was solid," Michael said, looking frustrated and scratching his head.

Benjamin rolled his eyes and plopped down on the nearby sofa, crossing his legs. "How would I know what's wrong? But I have two reasons for saying this."

Michael looked up at Benjamin and asked, "What are the two reasons?"

Benjamin pointed to the door. "When I went to see my girlfriend earlier, I overheard a conversation between Amelia and Isabella. Do you know what your wife asked my girlfriend? She actually asked Amelia if you had ever loved her."

"How did Amelia respond?" Michael asked, clearly worried.

Amelia was the person Isabella trusted the most. Her opinion was crucial. If she said anything negative about Michael, Isabella might become even more suspicious.

Benjamin chuckled. "Relax. She said you're the most trustworthy person in the world to Isabella."

Benjamin's words relieved Michael, and he felt grateful to Amelia.

"Thank her for me," Michael said.

Benjamin waved his hand dismissively. "Don't worry about it. Let me get to the second reason. Do you remember the two questions Isabella asked you?"

Michael nodded, recalling that Isabella had asked if he was hiding something from her and if he had ever deceived her emotionally.

"This shows Isabella cares most about emotions, especially after being hurt by John. She might tolerate some secrets, but she won't stand for emotional deception, like cheating!" Benjamin speculated.

Michael furrowed his brow even more. "Are you saying Isabella thinks I'm cheating?"

Benjamin shook his head. "If that were the case, she wouldn't be hugging and kissing you. I think she might have noticed something that looks like cheating, but I don't know the specifics."

Michael thought hard. He hadn't been out of Isabella's sight recently and hadn't had any overly intimate interactions with anyone else. What could have triggered Isabella's suspicion?

###chapter 368 Private Detective?

While Michael went off to find Benjamin, Isabella slipped out of the hotel too.

Once she was outside, she gave Jerry a call.

Jerry, who was busy at work, was caught off guard by Isabella's call. They had exchanged numbers, but she hardly ever called him.

Seeing her name pop up on his phone, Jerry was pretty shocked.

He answered cautiously, "Hello, Mrs. Williams, is everything okay?"

Isabella chuckled, "Why do you sound so nervous? Are you up to something behind Mr. Williams' back?"

Jerry let out an awkward laugh. "No way! I'm just surprised you called. Is there something you need?"

Isabella's tone turned serious. "Remember when we were looking into Bianca's medical records in Lumaria? You hired a really good detective there, right?"

"Yeah, do you need his contact info?" Jerry asked.

Isabella nodded, "Yes, I need his contact info for something."

Jerry felt relieved, thinking she might have found something wrong and was going to confront him.

"Alright, Mrs. Williams, I'll send it over. Can you tell me what you need to investigate? Maybe I can help," Jerry said, curious.

Isabella shook her head with a smile, "No need, it's about Mr. Williams. I'll handle it myself. Don't tell him. It's our little secret, okay?"

Her last words had a hint of a threat, and then she hung up.

Jerry stared at his phone, puzzled.

'Why does she need a private detective? Usually, it's to check if the husband's cheating, but Mr. Williams? No way,' Jerry thought, finding it hard to believe.

He knew Michael loved Isabella, so cheating seemed impossible.

'So, Mr. Williams must have done something to make Mrs. Williams suspicious,' Jerry concluded.

Ignoring Isabella's warning, Jerry decided to inform Michael. After all, Michael was the one who paid his salary.

Michael, who had just returned from seeing Benjamin, got a call from Jerry.

"What did you say? My wife hired a private detective to see if I'm cheating?" Michael's first reaction was to think Jerry was joking.

Jerry shared his suspicions, but Michael wasn't having it.

"Do you really think Isabella suspects me of cheating? She asked you for the detective's contact. Would you keep this from me?" Michael said, rolling his eyes.

Jerry was taken aback for a moment, then it hit him. Isabella and the others were just tourists in Lumaria; they couldn't stay long. Why hire a private detective there? Even if she suspected Michael of cheating, she'd investigate back home.

Michael, hearing the silence, knew Jerry had figured it out.

"Isabella must be having the detective look into something else. Send her the contact info right away," Michael said.

Jerry nodded. "I already sent it after her call. I just wanted to keep you in the loop."

Jerry paused, then asked, "Mr. Williams, any idea what Mrs. Williams wants to investigate?"

Michael rolled his eyes, "You're asking me? If she doesn't want to tell, she has her reasons. Pushing her would just mess things up."

On the other end, Jerry rolled his eyes too, feeling like he was sticking his nose where it didn't belong.

"Get in touch with that detective. Have him update us after reporting to Isabella. I don't need to know what she's investigating, but if something happens, I want to be able to help," Michael said before hanging up.

Michael was curious, but he wouldn't force Isabella to spill the beans.

Jerry sighed, shaking his head. "I'm just an employee, but I have to get involved in your family drama. Great, another day without a break."

Jerry tried calling the detective, but the call wouldn't go through. Isabella was probably already in touch with him.

When Isabella got back to the hotel, she found Michael lounging on the bed, playing with his phone.

"Hey, you're back. Hungry? Want to grab a bite?" Michael asked with a smile.

Isabella stood by the bed, looking at him. "I was out for a while. Didn't you wonder where I was?"

Michael grinned, "Even though we're married, we need our space. I can't keep tabs on you 24/7. Besides, I trust you. If you were gone too long, I'd call the cops."

Isabella rolled her eyes and sat next to him. "Did Jerry call you just now?"

Michael hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. "If I said he didn't, would you believe me?"

Annoyed, Isabella smacked his thigh. "Don't mess with me! I know Jerry told you about me wanting to hire a detective."

Michael chuckled, leaned over, and kissed her cheek. "Jerry was freaked out, thinking you were trying to catch me cheating."

"You guys always stick together," Isabella rolled her eyes again.

Michael shrugged. "Can't help it; I'm the one who signs his checks."

Isabella gave Michael a cold stare. He met her gaze.

"So, dear, what exactly are you looking into?" Michael asked, genuinely curious.

###chapter 369 Isabella's Determination

Isabella shook her head after hearing what Michael said.

"Sorry, babe, this time I'm not spilling the beans. I wanna check it out myself!" Isabella said with determination.

Michael was surprised for a second, but then he smiled and nodded. "Alright, if you've got a plan, go for it. Just let me know if you need help."

Isabella nodded, hugged Michael, and kissed him on the cheek. "Don't worry, hon. Now that I'm the head of the family and running three companies, I've got some clout. I wanna handle some things I couldn't before."

Michael nodded and let it go.

The next day, Michael and his crew were touring the country's famous sights with a guide.

During the tour, Isabella got a phone call.

"Sorry, you guys go ahead and have fun. I need to hit the restroom," Isabella said, waving them off. Halfway there, she pulled out her phone to answer the call.

Benjamin watched Isabella, then glanced at Michael suspiciously. "What's so secret she has to go far to answer? Afraid we'll hear?"

Amelia also gave Michael a look. Thinking about her chat with Isabella last night, she worried if Michael was really up to something shady.

Michael rolled his eyes. "Stop with the suspicious looks. Not everything needs to be public. Everyone deserves some privacy, right?"

Just as Michael finished speaking, his phone rang. It was Jerry calling.

"You two take your time, I'll go over there to take this call." Michael took his phone and walked away from Amelia and Benjamin.

"Darling, do you think they're acting strange? Is their relationship really in trouble?" Amelia asked Benjamin, concerned.

Since Isabella was hurt by John, Amelia had been worried about Isabella's mental state until Michael came along and made her happy again. If Michael was really cheating, Isabella would be crushed.

At best, Isabella would never trust men again. At worst, she might fall into depression.

Benjamin awkwardly waved his hand. "Don't worry, babe. I believe Michael wouldn't cheat. There must be some misunderstanding. Let's ask them directly when we have dinner later."

Amelia frowned but nodded in agreement.

Meanwhile, Michael was on the phone with Jerry, who told him why Isabella hired a private detective.

"Mrs. Williams hired a private detective to investigate the foreign woman you met at the hotel. She wants to track her movements and call records," Jerry said on the phone.

Michael's expression turned a bit odd. He didn't expect Isabella to investigate Elise, a foreign woman who seemed to have no connection to them.

"Mr. Williams, did you get too cozy with that foreign woman, making Mrs. Williams suspicious?" Jerry asked curiously.

"I'm not that kind of guy. I almost forgot about her. I was just translating between her and Isabella," Michael replied.

"Did Isabella suspect you because you speak a foreign language?" Jerry asked.

"Your thinking isn't very creative," Michael mocked.

Jerry was annoyed by Michael's words. He was concerned about their marriage, but Michael was mocking him.

"Isabella isn't that naive. There must be something about that woman that made her suspicious. Did the detective say anything else?" Michael asked again.

Jerry really wanted to tell Michael off, but as his employee, he held back.

Recalling what the private detective said, Jerry continued, "He said he tracked the foreign woman and found out she had checked out. From the makeup on her face, she didn't look haggard. She's very beautiful, like a cosmetics model. Not only beautiful but also elegant. It's hard to believe she's a woman deceived by a man." The private detective had repeated this to Jerry, who then relayed it to Isabella.

After hearing the private detective's words, Isabella smiled. "I knew she must be extraordinary. So has she left the country now?"

The private detective denied it.

"She hasn't left the country. She's still traveling around, but there's something you might find interesting." The private detective paused with a smile.

Isabella raised her eyebrows. "What is it? Please tell me."

The private detective smiled and said, "This woman speaks fluent Avalonian, and she even knows Lumarian. I don't think anyone can learn a foreign language in just two days, right?"

Isabella was stunned to hear this. She didn't expect Elise to be faking even her language skills.

Thinking of the translator Elise wore in the elevator that day, Isabella shook her head and chuckled.

"This woman is really well-prepared," Isabella laughed to herself.

The private detective continued, "For now, this is all I could find out. I haven't been able to investigate her call records yet. But on one occasion, while she was on the phone, I pretended to be a waiter and took a peek at her call interface. The call was made to Avalonia."

Isabella's eyes narrowed at the mention of Avalonia.

Michael is from that country.

"Did you say she's from Avalonia?" Michael's brows furrowed tightly after hearing Jerry's recounting.

###chapter 370 Prove it

Michael never saw it coming-the ordinary woman they bumped into at the hotel was actually part of a bigger scheme.

"Here's what we've got so far, Mr. Williams. Should we dig deeper?" Jerry asked.

Avalonia was Michael's turf, making it way easier to investigate there than in Lumaria.

After mulling it over for a second, Michael nodded. "Yeah, go ahead and look into it, but I doubt we'll find anything concrete. That woman's probably not from around here; she's got to be connected to someone local."

With Michael's go-ahead, Jerry hung up and started making plans.

Meanwhile, Michael and Isabella unexpectedly rejoined Amelia and the others.

"Sorry, everyone, I took forever in the bathroom," Isabella smiled, noticing Amelia giving her a weird look.

"Amelia, why are you looking at me like that?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

At the same time, Michael noticed Benjamin staring at him.

"Why are you staring at me? Finally realized I'm more handsome than you?" Michael teased.

Benjamin rolled his eyes. "Your wife went to make a call on one side, and you went to the other. I thought you two were chatting on the phone."

Isabella was taken aback, not expecting Michael to be on the phone too.

Michael shrugged it off. "Just handling some company stuff. No need to spill any business secrets to you, right?"

Benjamin shrugged. "Alright, if you say it's a business secret, then it's a business secret."

The four of them headed to the restaurant to order.

Amelia kept glancing between Isabella and Michael.

When the food arrived, Isabella put down her utensils and looked at Amelia, exasperated.

"Amelia, what's up with you? Why do you keep staring at us?" Isabella asked, clearly annoyed.

Amelia and Benjamin exchanged a look. Benjamin spoke up first.

"Actually, Amelia and I are a bit worried about your relationship," Benjamin said.

Amelia nodded. "Yeah, Isabella. If there's something going on, it's better to talk about it now so we can help. Otherwise, things might just get worse."

Isabella and Michael exchanged a look, both clearly frustrated.

"Our relationship is fine, no issues. You guys are just overthinking," Isabella said, rolling her eyes.

Amelia suddenly grabbed Isabella's hand and shook her head. "No way. As your best friend, I can tell you're hiding something."

Benjamin grabbed Michael's hand too. "Michael, you gotta tell us. As an emotional expert..."

Before Benjamin could finish, Michael pulled his hand away and playfully knocked him on the head.

"Ouch, that hurts! What are you doing?" Benjamin rubbed his forehead, glaring at Michael.

Amelia looked at Benjamin's swollen forehead with concern, then shot Michael an angry look. "We're worried about your relationship. How could you hit him?"

Michael sighed, feeling exasperated. He pointed to the surrounding customers. "Do you hear yourself? With you holding my hand so tightly, people might think I'm gay."

Isabella couldn't help but laugh. "You two don't need to worry. Our relationship is solid."

Amelia massaged Benjamin's forehead, still skeptical. "I don't believe it, unless you prove it to me."

Isabella was taken aback. "How are we supposed to prove that?"

"I know how," Michael said.

Before anyone could react, he suddenly hugged Isabella, lifted her chin, and kissed her deeply.

The surrounding customers erupted into cheers as they embraced in a passionate kiss.

Isabella pushed Michael away, her cheeks flushed.

Michael wiped his mouth and looked at Benjamin and Amelia. He grinned. "Now you don't need to worry about our relationship, right?"

Isabella rolled her eyes and lightly tapped Michael's leg.

Benjamin looked at Amelia. "This should be proof enough, right?"

Amelia nodded. "It should be! They look like a couple in the honeymoon phase."

But Isabella shook her head. "We're already married, not in the honeymoon phase. You and Benjamin just started dating. You should be more passionate, but I don't see that in you two," she said with a mischievous smirk.

Amelia blushed and glared at Isabella. "We're just more reserved. We can't do something like kissing in front of so many people."

Benjamin nodded. "That's right, we're both more reserved. Unlike you two, who are so passionate."

Michael glanced at Benjamin and said calmly, "Before you say that, you should control the envy in your eyes. When I kissed my wife just now, all I saw in your eyes was jealousy."

Benjamin coughed awkwardly. "No, I didn't. Don't make things up."

Isabella chimed in, "Amelia, did you hear that? Your boyfriend wants a kiss. You can't let him down."

Amelia's face grew even redder. She glared at Benjamin, who just smiled awkwardly at her.

"It's okay, if you want a kiss, we can go back to the hotel..." Benjamin's words were cut off as Amelia suddenly pulled him closer and kissed him passionately.

Benjamin's eyes widened in surprise. He didn't expect Amelia to kiss him so passionately in the restaurant.

"That's great, dear, did you capture it?" Isabella took photos with her phone continuously.

Michael recorded with his phone and nodded with a smile. "I got it all. We can make a video later, add some music, and play it at their wedding."

###chapter 371 I Want to Find My Love

As the wedding went on, Isabella linked arms with Jasper and strolled in from the church door, while Joseph watched with a mix of excitement and happiness.

"I can't believe you managed to fall asleep during the wedding march," Avery Davis's voice jolted Joseph awake.

Joseph blinked, wiped the drool from his mouth, and looked at Avery sheepishly. "Avery, when did you get back?"

Avery rolled her eyes. "Just now. I heard the wedding march and thought someone in the family was getting hitched, but nope, it's just you, snoozing away."

Joseph scratched his head, feeling awkward.

Avery plopped down across from him, laughing. "So, who were you dreaming about? Spill the beans, maybe I know her."

Joseph shook his head. "No way, if I tell you, you'll definitely blab. I'm not sharing my embarrassing secrets."

"It's normal to like someone, but you think it's embarrassing. So, she doesn't like you back?" Avery's curiosity was piqued, her eyes sparkling with interest.

Joseph sighed and shook his head. "I don't know if she likes me, but I know for sure her family doesn't."

Avery frowned. "Who wouldn't like you? You're good-looking and talented. Is it someone from one of the big families? Who in her family disapproves?"

"Her husband," Joseph said with a sigh.

Avery slumped on the sofa, rubbing her face. "You're seriously crushing on a married woman? Who is she?"

Joseph shook his head. "I can't say. It might mess up your relationship."

Avery paused, then looked at him in shock. "Wait, are you saying I know her? There aren't many married women around me that you could like. Who is it?"

Avery frowned, thinking hard. A married woman she knew well, and Joseph knew her too, narrowing down the options.

"Is it Isabella?" Avery asked hesitantly.

Joseph's silence was all the confirmation she needed.

Avery slapped her forehead, grabbed a cushion from the sofa, and threw it at him. "Are you kidding me? Isabella's been married for less than a year and is still in the honeymoon phase. Do you really want to be her husband's rival right now?"

Joseph hugged the cushion, looking at Avery hopefully. "So, are you saying I should wait a couple of years?"

"My advice is to give up! I don't see any hope for you," Avery said, pulling out her phone and scrolling through her social media.

"Check this out, Isabella posted today. She and her husband are on a trip to Lumaria with friends. Look how happy she is! She's still in the honeymoon phase. You don't stand a chance, so just let it go," Avery told Joseph.

But Joseph was fixated on something else.

"Seriously? How come you have her social account and I don't?" Joseph snatched Avery's phone, fuming.

Avery looked at him, surprised. "You don't have Isabella's social account? What do you have then?"

"Just her phone number," Joseph said with a bitter smile, handing back the phone.

Avery gave him a sympathetic look. "That says a lot. Isabella doesn't love you."

"I'm not giving up. If Dad hadn't sent me abroad to study, John wouldn't have had a chance with her! I've been secretly in love with Isabella for over a decade!" Joseph said earnestly.

Avery was at a loss for words. Just as she was about to say something, she saw Joseph get up from the sofa and head towards his room.

"Where are you going? Lunch?" Avery called after him.

Joseph shook his head. "I'm going to confess my love to Isabella. Even if she rejects me, I want her to know she has a choice if her marriage hits a rough patch."

Avery was stunned. "Are you out of your mind? Are you trying to be a homewrecker? Don't you think this is despicable and undignified?"

Joseph turned around, smiling gently. "No, Avery, you don't get it. This is love."

"This is not love! You'll be scorned for this!" Avery tried to stop him, but he ran out of the house, not even grabbing his luggage.

"Joseph, you idiot, come back here!" Avery shouted at the door, but Joseph had already driven off towards the airport.

Avery sighed and pulled out her phone to call Isabella.

The phone rang twice before Isabella picked up.

"Avery, it's rare for you to call. What's up?" Isabella asked.

Avery was about to speak when she heard a loud noise on Isabella's end, like an airplane taking off.

"Are you at the airport? I think I hear airplane engines," Avery asked, surprised.

Isabella nodded. "Yeah, we came here to take wedding photos and travel for a few days. It's time to head back; my company has some matters waiting for me."

A smile tugged at Avery's lips.

"I just wanted to ask if you could come car shopping with me when you get back? I'm planning to buy a car but don't want to go alone," Avery said with a smile.

'Poor Joseph, traveling abroad alone!' Avery laughed inwardly.

###chapter 372 Michael's Brother

Isabella agreed to go shopping with Avery and then hung up the phone.

She used to go shopping with Amelia, but now that Amelia's dating Benjamin and they're in the honeymoon phase, their shopping trips have become less frequent.

After hanging up, Isabella noticed Michael staring at her. She smiled and asked, "What's up, babe? Why are you looking at me like that?"

Michael grinned and said, "Nothing, I just didn't expect you back so soon. Our trip was supposed to last a few more days."

This time, Isabella and Michael decided to return home, while Benjamin and Amelia continued their trip in Lumaria.

Isabella shrugged, looking a bit helpless. "If I don't go back now, Carol will fly over to find me. I'm the president of the company now, and there are a lot of things that need my attention. I can't just dump all the work on my team. That wouldn't be fair."

Towards the end of her speech, Isabella suddenly took Michael's hand and, with a somewhat melancholic tone, said, "Babe, I might work late often and have dinners with male clients. Will you worry about our marriage?"

Michael chuckled, stroking her hair. "True love means understanding each other. I can't be too selfish and keep you tied to my side. Loving you means supporting your dreams."

Feeling touched, Isabella kissed his hand. "Babe, you're so sweet. But why are you still unwilling to work at my company?"

Michael looked a bit embarrassed. He was worried that staying in Isabella's company might expose his identity. After all, there were definitely spies from the four major families.

"Babe, you know I have a little male pride. I don't want others to think I got my status through a woman." Michael shrugged.

Isabella sighed softly, accepting his thoughts. After all, Michael was her lover, and she should respect his choices.

"It's okay, babe. You don't have to be too sad. Even though I can't be with you at work, I can be with you at home. At home, I'll be your advisor. You can ask me anything you don't understand, maybe I can help you, and most importantly, it's free." Michael winked playfully.

Seemingly understanding Michael's implication, Isabella joked, "Are you saying everything is free? Free chef, free masseuse, free nutritionist, free emotional counselor, free business consultant, and even a free provider of certain services?"

"Enough, babe. We don't need to mention the last one." Michael looked around awkwardly, noticing people staring at them.

Originally, Michael just wanted to tease Isabella and see her shy in public. He didn't expect her to joke openly, making him a bit embarrassed. Isabella understood what was on Michael's mind.

Isabella's fingers slowly traced down from Michael's Adam's apple, over his strong chest muscles, and then slid down to his abs.

The sculpted lines, like marble, made Isabella's heart flutter.

"Babe, I'm not just a girl anymore. I'm a wife now. I know a lot of things! Of course, if you want to see me shy, that's possible too. But I might need some time to get into character, maybe even dig out my old college clothes! By the way, I was a cheerleader for a bit in college, and those uniforms were pretty enticing." Isabella winked at Michael, her smile and gaze full of allure.

Michael imagined Isabella in a cheerleading uniform. With her current figure in those college clothes, they'd definitely be a bit tight, showing off her curves even more.

Michael swallowed, feeling a bit parched, a sign of his growing desire.

Taking a deep breath, Michael grabbed Isabella's hand. "Babe, let's wait a bit longer. The doctor said I need to take my medication for another month."

Isabella's eyes dimmed, and she patted Michael's waist in frustration. "Your abilities are still there, why are you so eager to maintain yourself?"

Michael's lips twitched, a hint of fear flashing in his eyes. 'No matter how good your abilities are, they can't withstand a hungry woman!'

Michael recalled the night of passion with Isabella, feeling completely drained, as if his body and soul were nonexistent, even wanting to collapse while walking.

"Babe, the body needs maintenance. The earlier you start, the better for your future health. I think you can understand, right?" Michael smiled awkwardly.

Disappointed, Isabella sighed. She wrapped her hands around Michael's neck, locking eyes with him.

"Babe, I understand you. After all, there's no chance of you straying with your physique, so in that aspect, I'm quite reassured." A sly smile flashed in Isabella's eyes.

Michael's smile froze on his face, his eyes twitching slightly, feeling annoyed. "Babe, although you make a valid point, I sense a strong hint of disdain."

Isabella covered her mouth and laughed, sharing an emotional exchange with Michael.

While Isabella and Michael were waiting for their flight, on the other side, Joseph had already boarded a plane to Lumaria.

"Wait for me, Isabella. I'm coming! I want to tell you that there's still me as an option in your life!" Joseph stared out the window at the shrinking buildings with fiery eyes.

After returning home, Isabella and Michael accepted a delivery from the courier.

While opening the package, Isabella suddenly found a letter addressed to Michael.

"Babe, here's a letter for you, but it's not signed." Isabella handed it to Michael.

After glancing at the symbol on the envelope, Michael's face instantly darkened.

###chapter 373 Hidden Past

The emblem on the envelope was a red H, kind of like blood red, maybe a bit like fiery red.

Michael knew exactly who sent this letter. Only one guy used that emblem.

"What's up? You look a bit pale, is something wrong?" Isabella asked, eyeing the letter in his hand, guessing it had something to do with Michael's bad mood.

"Nothing, just from an annoying guy." Michael ripped open the envelope, skimmed the letter, and handed it to Isabella.

Isabella looked puzzled, her eyes widening as she read the letter.

"Wait, you have a brother? Why have I never heard you mention him before?" Isabella was shocked.

The letter started with 'My dear little brother.'

The rest was all about a brother's concern for his younger sibling, with a hint of dissatisfaction and helplessness about not being invited to Michael's wedding.

The letter was signed, Ryan.

"I never heard your father mention you had a brother before. What's the deal?" Isabella asked Michael, curious.

Michael's expression darkened, and he said in a low voice, "I do have a brother, but I don't want to admit it because he's more like my father's illegitimate child. A woman had a fling with my dad while he was drunk and got pregnant. My dad never acknowledged him. The only woman he truly loved was my mom. But he provided financial support out of responsibility."

Isabella had never imagined Michael had such relatives. From his tone, she sensed his poor relationship with them.

"Anyway, it was like a twisted fairy tale. After my mom passed away, since I was still young, my dad brought them over to help take care of me. He paid, but she wanted to abuse me. After I gathered evidence and gave it to my dad, he kicked them out." Michael calmly recounted his past.

Isabella hugged Michael with a touch of pity. "I've never heard you tell such a story, neither did your father."

Michael smiled and patted her head. "It's okay, you don't need to be sad for me, these are all things that happened a long time ago. Now no one dares to mess with me."

"Yeah, I'll protect you!" Isabella said earnestly, looking up at him.

Michael nodded with a smile and embraced her again.

Isabella felt sweet in Michael's arms, but his eyes held a coldness.

Ryan's letter showing up here was definitely not a coincidence. Although he seemed like a caring brother in the letter, Michael knew very well that Ryan's heart was as cunning as a scorpion.

It lurks in the dark, ready to sting with a poisoned needle.

"Are you threatening me, Ryan? Harm Isabella, and I'll burn you alive again. Let's see if you rise like a phoenix this time." Michael's eyes were cold as ice.

Meanwhile, Jerry was handling company matters when he got a call from overseas. The news made him take a sharp breath.

Jerry immediately called Michael.

When the call connected, Jerry quickly said, "Mr. Williams, we have a crisis with our overseas business. Phoenix Flame Group is luring our clients with sweet deals. You need to handle this personally."

At the Phoenix Flame Group building, a masked figure looked down at the city through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Ryan held a glass of red wine, the liquid swaying and reflecting the city's night view, as if the whole city was in the glass.

Suddenly, the office door opened, and Scarlett walked in, the click of her high heels breaking the silence.

"You're quick! I just sent you the client info, and you acted so fast. Aren't you afraid of Michael retaliating?" Scarlett sat on the sofa, lit a feminine cigarette, and asked lightly.

The cigarette emitted a faint floral scent.

Ryan's nose twitched at the scent, then he looked at Scarlett on the sofa.

Scarlett, in a black dress with a tall figure, had her legs crossed on the table in front of her, her black-stockinged legs shining under the light.

Ryan downed his wine in one gulp, walked over, placed the glass on the table, and stood in front of Scarlett.

"I'm doing this for you. I heard Michael and Isabella were rude to you last time they visited, and even sent your friend to prison. I heard you suffered a lot, so I want to avenge you." Ryan smiled, bent down, and reached out to touch Scarlett's chin, trying to lift it up.

Scarlett raised her head, her icy gaze fixed on Ryan, and a mocking smile appeared on her lips. "For me? Well, thank you very much, my bell-ringer."

The smile under Ryan's mask disappeared, and his eyes turned dark.

Scarlett's reference to the bell-ringer comes from the famous novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The male protagonist in the novel is an ugly bell-ringer who falls in love with the most beautiful woman in the city.

Scarlett's words mocked Ryan's ugly face hidden under the mask.

###chapter 374 Michael Goes Abroad

Scarlett noticed something off in Ryan's expression and smirked.

"Can't even handle a joke, huh? What makes you think you can compete with your brother?" Scarlett brushed off Ryan's hand.

Ryan's face went back to normal. He stood up, smiled at Scarlett, and said, "We've known each other forever. Why are you always so cold to me?"

"I'm not here for a trip down memory lane. I sold you the info, now pay up. I'm here to collect." Scarlett waved her hand impatiently and stubbed out her cigarette on the table, leaving a burn mark, just like the scars under Ryan's mask.

There was an ashtray right there, but Scarlett seemed set on humiliating Ryan.

Ryan's mouth curved slightly under the mask. He smiled and said, "I won't shortchange you a dime. The transfer's just a bit delayed, not that I won't pay."

As soon as Ryan finished speaking, Scarlett's phone buzzed with a text notification of the bank transfer.

Scarlett checked her phone, put it in her bag, and stood up. "Alright, got the money. I'm out."

After Scarlett left, Ryan walked to his desk and called his assistant. "Get rid of the desk in my office and bring me a new one."

He leaned against the desk and chuckled. "Annoying woman. I'll make you come begging to me someday."

Meanwhile, Michael got a call from Jerry.

Michael was a bit annoyed. He'd just gotten back from overseas and wanted to spend time with Isabella, but now he had to go abroad for work.

"Mr. Williams, you need to handle this personally. We've got too many clients. If we partner with another company, it'll be a huge loss," Jerry stressed over the phone.

Michael replied coolly, "What's the rush? Things aren't that bad. Ryan just wants to annoy me. It's not that easy to steal my clients."

Jerry paused, "Mr. Williams, do you know who's behind this?"

Michael sneered, "As soon as I heard the name Phoenix Flame Group, I knew it was Ryan's company. Calling himself Phoenix, like some demon from fire. Where does he get the nerve? Alright, I'll handle things here quickly."

Michael hung up. Even though he didn't want to leave Isabella, he knew his company needed him.

Isabella was sitting on the sofa, looking at the info Carol sent her, when she saw Michael step out onto the balcony.

Isabella turned to Michael with a smile, "Call over? Got something to tell me?"

Michael sat across from her, grinning. "How'd you know I had something to say?"

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "It's written all over your face. I can tell something's up."

Michael awkwardly touched his nose. "The company needs me to go on a business trip abroad for a few days, so I won't be around."

Isabella suddenly looked at him and placed the documents she was holding on the table. "Do you think I'll miss you a lot?"

Michael nodded. "Isn't it obvious?"

"Alright, you guessed right. I'll miss you a lot." Isabella stood up with a smile, then walked over and sat next to him.

"Since I took over all the shares, you've been helping me so much. But you need to focus on your work too. You can't put everything on me, even though it means a lot. We need personal space to make our love stronger." Isabella looked at him seriously.

Michael got it. She didn't think he was too controlling; she just wanted him to have his own time.

Selfless love is great, but it can also make one feel guilty.

Michael hugged her and kissed her forehead. "Thanks for understanding, darling. I'll miss you a lot while I'm away."

Isabella caressed his waist. "This trip can be a break for you too. When you come back, we'll have a great time together."

Michael gave a wry smile. But as she said, it was also a chance for self-improvement.

"If you run into something you can't handle, call me. Even though I'm on a business trip, you're the most important to me." Michael said seriously.

Isabella nodded. "Don't worry, darling. If that happens, I'll definitely call you."

Michael kissed her forehead again. "Thanks for understanding, darling. You keep busy with work, I'll go pack."

Isabella held his hand. "You men aren't thoughtful enough when it comes to packing. Let me help."

She went to the bedroom and started packing for him, from daily necessities like toothbrushes to underwear, even matching lucky dates and colors.

The next day, with Isabella watching, Michael boarded the plane to go abroad.

Meanwhile, Joseph's plane landed at Lumaria Airport.

Based on the social media pictures Isabella posted, Joseph found the hotel where she was staying. But when he got there, he was told Isabella and the others had already gone home.

###chapter 375 The Unlucky Man

Joseph was having the worst luck ever.

He flew to another country, all excited to chase after his love, only to find out Isabella had already gone back home.

Feeling bummed out, Joseph checked into a hotel, hoping to chill and get over his disappointment.

Out of nowhere, he decided to call Avery. She was already at Isabella's office when she got his call, a smirk on her face.

"Hey, Joseph! Weren't you off chasing your dream girl? Why the sudden call?" Avery teased.

Joseph took a deep breath and asked, "Avery, did you know Isabella had already gone home?"

His voice was dripping with bitterness. Avery's earlier question had already given him the answer.

Avery didn't hold back, "Yeah, I knew before you ditched me in the living room and took off. I wanted to call you back, but what could I do? All I could do was wish you luck and hope your planes crossed paths in the sky."

She burst out laughing, probably picturing the whole thing.

Two planes meeting in the sky, with Joseph spotting Isabella through the window of the other plane.

If this were a cheesy romance drama, they'd meet across a bus, and the guy would yell for the driver to stop so he could get off.

But on a plane? Joseph would just end up yelling at the flight attendant to stop the plane so he could get off and find someone. Next thing you know, he'd be mistaken for a nutcase and strapped to his seat!

"Ha! Captain, land the plane on that cloud ahead, I need to get off!" Avery joked, laughing into the phone.

On the other end, Joseph's face was dark with anger.

"Is this funny to you? Do I look like a fool?" Joseph snapped.

Avery took a few deep breaths to calm her laughter. She said, "You chose to go, I didn't force you. I told you not to hold onto such fantasies. You didn't listen. Can you really blame me?"

Avery snorted, then noticed Isabella outside the elevator.

She waved at Isabella and said into the phone, "Alright, I'm done chatting. I'm going to buy a car with Isabella. Enjoy your time there, and maybe blow off some steam. I heard the adult entertainment scene is pretty wild. Have fun, but don't bring any diseases back, got it?"

Avery hung up.

Joseph was so mad he almost threw his phone. Avery always knew how to push his buttons.

But after cooling down, Joseph started to think things over.

"Whatever, my earlier thoughts were pretty ridiculous. I'll just hang out here for a few days and see what happens." Joseph sighed and left the room, ready to explore the fun and food this country had to offer.

Isabella came downstairs and quickly spotted Avery waving.

Isabella's connection with Avery was also tied to Joseph. Back when Isabella was part of one of the four major families, she often attended various banquets and met Avery at one of them.

The two women had similar personalities and interests, but Avery had always disliked John more.

Later, when Isabella's family fell on hard times, she still loved John deeply. However, John didn't feel the same and refused to take her to gatherings, so Avery always accompanied her. Their bond grew stronger over time.

"Long time no see, Isabella. Have you put on some weight?" Avery teased, her eyes on Isabella's chest.

Isabella rolled her eyes, "I'm not fat, I'm just curvy, thanks to love! You'll get it when you get married."

Hearing Isabella's words, Avery's already low opinion of Joseph dropped even further. The affection between Isabella and John was strong, and Joseph didn't stand a chance.

"I don't want to get married. Being single is the best! No man can conquer me," Avery said proudly.

Isabella chuckled and shook her head. Avery loved making such jokes. When John used to give her trouble, Avery never hesitated to put him in his place.

"Alright, aren't we here to buy a car? Let's go. What kind of car are you thinking about?" Isabella asked as they got into the car.

Avery tilted her head, thinking. "I was thinking about getting an SUV for daily use, but maybe a rugged off-road vehicle would suit my style better. What do you think?"

Isabella thought for a moment. "Let's go for the off-road vehicle! I heard camping in the wilderness is popular lately. You can use it for camping trips. Maybe we can go camping together sometime."

"That sounds like a great idea. Let's get the off-road vehicle then. Actually, let's get two cars. I'll drive whichever one I feel like. I can afford it," Avery shrugged, feeling her dilemma was unnecessary.

Isabella nodded in agreement. They quickly arrived at the car dealership Avery had in mind. Isabella saw the sign and remembered it was one of John's businesses.

In the past, Isabella had learned a lot to please John, including the famous stores and industries under his name. This car dealership was opened by John five years ago and had been doing well. Many wealthy people bought their cars here.

Isabella and Avery walked in, and Avery immediately pulled Isabella to the car she liked.

"This is the one I like. What do you think?" Avery asked proudly.

Isabella nodded, agreeing that the car looked great.

But just then, an annoying voice cut in. "I'll take this off-road vehicle. Just swipe the card, I'm buying it."

###chapter 376 Annoying Woman

Isabella and Avery heard the noise and turned around at the same time, spotting two women who looked shocked to see Isabella.

"Ms. Foster, Mrs. Brown, are you here to buy a car too?" Isabella greeted them with a smile.

"Ms. Taylor, you're here too? Oh, you're the CEO now. Yes, I'm here to buy a car," Estella smiled and shook Isabella's hand.

Estella's status in the Big Four families was well-known. Avery knew who Estella was married to, but they had never interacted.

"Ms. Foster, this is my good friend Avery from the Davis Family. And Ms. Foster, I think you already know who she is," Isabella winked at Avery.

Avery nodded and shook hands with Estella.

Avery ignored Zoey after Isabella's initial greeting, showing the Brown Family's lower status among the Big Four. The other three families didn't see them as equals.

Zoey was used to such treatment from the other major families.

Zoey looked at Isabella coldly and said, "I heard you not only got all the shares in the company and became the CEO, but also sent your sister to prison. What charges this time?"

With Zoey's words, the atmosphere grew tense.

Isabella's demeanor cooled. The initial greeting was just politeness, but since Zoey was being rude, she didn't need to be nice.

Last time, Isabella sent Bianca to prison for trashing her house and stealing her designs. This time, Bianca was suspected of forging medical reports, bribing staff, and attempting to kidnap Isabella.

The kidnapping charge was only mentioned as attempted because Isabella didn't publicize it due to Mason's condition.

"It doesn't really concern you what charges I use, right? I didn't expect Mrs. Brown to care so much about me. Thank you, it reminds me of my mother," Isabella smiled at Zoey, but her words were like a bombshell.

Isabella deliberately mentioned her mother, indirectly referring to Pearl, who was still in the ICU.

Pearl's situation was a sore spot for Zoey. Every time she saw Pearl's miserable state in the hospital, she couldn't help but tremble with sadness and anger.

Indeed, after Isabella mentioned this, Zoey's face turned pale again, with anger brewing in her eyes.

Estella felt uneasy. She didn't expect to run into Isabella while buying a car. Zoey always got worked up around Isabella. Estella knew she had to calm Zoey down, or things might get out of hand and be hard to explain to Michael.

"Mrs. Brown, I think that car over there looks good too. Let's go check it out," Estella pointed to a car, planning to pull Zoey over to distract her.

But Zoey just glanced at the car and shook her head. "Ms. Foster, that car doesn't suit your style. This SUV is more your speed!"

Zoey pointed to the SUV in front of them. Isabella's face darkened, and Avery's expression soured because they had seen the car first. Most importantly, there was only one in the whole store.

Isabella said to Zoey coolly, "Mrs. Brown, I hope you understand that we saw this car first."

Zoey chuckled, crossing her arms. "Seeing it first doesn't make it yours. Can I pay more if I like it?"

"Do you think this is an auction? It's not like I can't afford it, you nouveau riche," Avery shot back, mocking Zoey.

In the eyes of the other three major families, the Brown Family was just nouveau riche, always trying to solve everything with money.

The manager of the dealership wasn't stupid. Letting the highest bidder buy the car would offend other wealthy clients. While they wanted to make money, integrity was also important.

Avery's words provoked Zoey, but she couldn't find anything to target Avery with. Avery didn't have embarrassing incidents known to everyone like Isabella did-pursuing John for eight years only to be abandoned, marrying an ordinary guy, being betrayed by family, and sending loved ones to prison.

In the end, Zoey decided to target Isabella.

"I heard your sister Bianca was released from prison by John again. I really didn't expect that. Did she save his life or something? Why does he always love her so much and look down on you?" Zoey continued to mock, crossing her arms.

Estella covered her face in annoyance. After spending time with Zoey, she had learned that Zoey's daughter Pearl had deep conflicts with Isabella. As a mother, Zoey naturally sided with Pearl and kept targeting Isabella. Estella felt Zoey targeted Isabella not just because of Pearl, but also to vent her own resentment.

Isabella looked at Zoey coldly and said, "I also want to know why John does this, but his feelings don't matter to me. I don't rely on him to live. Besides, John looks down on you too. Have you pursued him too? Does Paxton know about this?"

After hearing Isabella's words, Avery burst into laughter. "This is hilarious. Zoey pursuing John? Even the most unreliable journalist couldn't write such a story. But that scene must have been really funny."

Avery's imagination ran wild, and she couldn't help but laugh out loud at the thought of Zoey and John together.

Estella also covered her mouth, trying hard not to laugh, but her shaking shoulders gave her away.

Laughter is contagious. Although Isabella was just mocking Zoey, Avery's laughter was so infectious that Isabella couldn't help but laugh too.

Among the four women, only Zoey didn't laugh.

###chapter 377 The Resentment of Luke

Zoey couldn't help but feel frustrated. She had planned to use Bianca and John's relationship to rile up Isabella, but Isabella didn't seem to care at all and even turned the tables on her.

"Enough, stop laughing! Is it polite to make such jokes in front of me?" Zoey snapped at Isabella, her eyes blazing with anger.

Estella took a deep breath, finally managing to stifle her laughter.

"Alright, Mrs. Brown, we don't need to stay here any longer. Isabella, I think there might be some misunderstanding between us. Actually, I don't have to insist on choosing an SUV; it was just a sudden idea. I can look at another car," Estella said with a gentle smile towards Isabella.

Estella always remembered Michael's warning not to tarnish his reputation by using his name outside. She thought she had done well in this regard. Besides promoting film projects, she rarely appeared in public or discussed her marriage.

Michael was very satisfied with Estella's performance, providing her with ample resources. Recently, she had another new movie to shoot, which made her very grateful to Michael.

Estella wanted to take Zoey elsewhere to look at cars, but Zoey stood still like a pillar, refusing to move.

Estella was very annoyed. If it weren't for Michael's task for her to get close to Zoey and gather information about the Brown Family, she wouldn't want to deal with her at all.

"Ms. Foster, you are too gentle! If it weren't for your husband's protection, you would definitely be at a disadvantage in front of others! Just like today! Are you going to keep backing down when others bully you?" Zoey said to Estella, clearly annoyed.

Estella widened her eyes, almost swearing out loud. Zoey's deliberate targeting of Isabella had caused the conflict. This wouldn't have happened if she was alone.

"Mrs. Brown, I think that's enough. I don't need an SUV. I like other cars as well, there's no need to choose this one." Estella's tone carried a hint of warning. She didn't want to stay here any longer. She saw customers looking over in their direction, worried that someone might capture this scene and post it online, which would damage her reputation.

However, Zoey clearly didn't want to let Isabella off so easily.

The argument attracted the manager of the car dealership.

The manager of the store was Luke Riddick, a long-time employee under John's command, so he knew who the four women in front of him were.

Isabella had been engaged to John before, although they had broken up, she still had Mason as a backer. Estella was John's uncle's wife, also considered part of the Williams Family. The other two women were important figures in the four major families.

Luke smiled bitterly; he couldn't afford to provoke any of these women."Ladies, is there anything I can help with?" Luke approached, trying to keep his cool. He really didn't want to be in the middle of this, but as the manager, he had to step in.

Zoey pointed at Estella and said to Luke, "You know her; she's John's uncle's wife. She wants to buy this car, but these two say they saw it first. Who should buy it?"

Luke wished he could just disappear. Zoey was making things way too complicated. He was just a small fry; why should he get involved in a fight he couldn't win? He cursed Zoey in his head but kept a professional smile plastered on his face.

"Ladies, I'm sorry to inform you that this SUV is not for sale. It's just for display and has been touched by many customers. Considering your distinguished status, you wouldn't want a car that's been handled by so many people. If you really like it, you can leave a deposit, and we'll deliver a brand new one to your home soon," Luke said respectfully.

In Luke's mind, it was better not to offend anyone. Instead of giving the car to one person and making enemies of the others, it was fairer for no one to get it. As for the dealership losing out on a sale, that wasn't his problem. Luxury cars always had buyers, even if the four major families didn't buy, there were plenty of other wealthy customers.

Luke's plan seemed perfect, but reality had other ideas. Zoey wasn't buying it.

"Who said this car isn't for sale? I asked before, and your store never had such a policy. Are you deliberately targeting us?" Zoey glared at Luke, her expression icy.

If looks could kill, Luke would be six feet under.

Luke took a deep breath and forced a smile. "Ma'am, even if this car is for sale, do you really want to drive one that's been used by so many people?"

He looked at Estella, Isabella, and Avery.

All three women shook their heads. To them, a car was like a personal item.

Some men even joked online that cars and wives were not for lending, equating cars with partners.

A car that had been experienced by many people felt uncomfortable to them, given their status.

Luke felt a wave of relief seeing Isabella and the others' reactions. Especially Estella's; since the car was for her, if she didn't want it, Zoey couldn't argue.

But then Zoey said, "I don't mind if many people have used this car. Since Ms. Foster doesn't like it, I'll buy it for my husband; he doesn't mind anyway."

Luke was stunned.

Avery, standing nearby, sneered, "That makes sense. My brother Joseph happens to want a new car. I'll give this one to him! Consider it sisterly love for my brother."

###chapter 378 Luke's Savior

Luke was feeling pretty down. After all that effort, he was right back where he started.

Even though Isabella and Estella weren't involved this time, the families backing them were not ones he could mess with.

As Luke was mulling over his next move, he spotted someone walking in from outside, and his eyes lit up.

"Sorry, ladies, I need to step away for a moment. Mr. Williams just arrived, and I need to deliver the car he ordered," Luke said, quickly heading towards John.

'If I can't handle this, I'll find someone who can,' Luke thought, feeling a bit relieved. But he knew he couldn't just dump the problem on John directly.

Bosses hate it when their employees pass problems up the chain; it makes them look bad. Luke knew this all too well.

"Mr. Williams, your car is here. Also, Isabella and your uncle's wife are here. Do you want to go say hi?" Luke asked, testing the waters.

Luke's question was like bait, dropping Isabella and Estella's names to spark John's interest. If John took the bait, Luke could hand the problem over to him.

John glanced over to where Luke was pointing and saw Isabella and Estella.

"What are they doing here?" John asked.

Luke gave a wry smile and said, "Isabella and her friend are here to buy a car. Ms. Davis wants the latest off-road vehicle we have. But Ms. Foster and Mrs. Brown also want that car. Mrs. Brown is now arguing with Ms. Davis over it."

John frowned slightly, sensing Luke was trying to rope him in.

Luke stayed calm, leaning in a bit, waiting for John's next move.

John walked over to the four women and greeted them. Avery, Zoey, and Estella responded, but Isabella just gave him a glance and stayed silent.

John looked at Isabella, feeling a bit of tension.

"Sorry, ladies, Luke doesn't know the full story. Actually, this car is mine now and won't be sold to anyone. If you like this model, Luke can help you reserve one," John said smoothly.

If Estella wanted the car, he'd definitely give it to her since they were closer. But from what Luke had said, it seemed like Zoey was the one really interested, so John didn't need to step in.

Luke followed behind John, feeling pretty pleased. With someone powerful backing you, tough situations could get a lot easier.

Luke had thought about saying the same thing as John before, but he didn't have the guts to make that call.

Zoey was still pretty unhappy, but she knew she couldn't use this car to get at Isabella anymore.

"Sorry for the hassle. How about this: pick any car you like, and I'll give you a fifty percent discount," John said with a casual smile. That's the kind of confidence that comes with having money.

These women could afford a car, but John's offer showed he respected them as customers.

"That's awesome, John, thanks. Mrs. Brown, let's go check out that red sports car. It looks pretty sweet," Estella said, smiling at John before dragging Zoey along.

This time, Zoey didn't resist and just followed Estella.

Once Estella and Zoey were gone, Isabella took Avery to look at other cars.

John wanted to chat with Isabella, but seeing Avery with her, he decided to let them go.

Isabella and Avery walked over to another car.

Pointing at an SUV, Avery asked Isabella, "I've had my eye on this one. What do you think?"

Isabella checked out the SUV and then glanced at a white sedan nearby. "From my point of view, the white sedan looks better, but if you like the SUV, go for it."

Avery looked at the white sedan. "You're right, the sedan is really nice, but I already have too many like that. I'll go with the SUV."

Avery called Luke over to finalize the purchase.

John, standing nearby, overheard their conversation and also eyed the white sedan.

After Luke and Avery wrapped up the paperwork, John called Luke over. "When the cars are ready, give that white sedan to Isabella."

Luke was surprised for a moment but then nodded. Since the dealership belonged to John, he could give away cars as he pleased, and it wasn't Luke's concern.

When the two cars were ready, Isabella heard that John wanted to give her a car, and she frowned.

"Looks like John still has feelings for you! But he's never given you a car or any gifts before, not even on your birthday. Why so generous now?" Avery teased, curious.

Isabella snorted. "I don't care why he's giving me such an expensive gift. I'm married and can't accept his affection. I'll just return the keys."

Isabella walked back into the dealership and found John, tossing the keys to him.

"I don't need your charity. This is my final warning. I'm married and can't accept your love. You already have Bianca, so leave me alone," Isabella said coldly.

John held the keys, smiled bitterly, and shook his head. "Isabella, you've got it wrong. I'm not giving you this car to pursue you, but to show my gratitude."

###chapter 379 Thank Isabella

Isabella stopped for a second after hearing what John said. She couldn't think of any reason why John would be thanking her.

John handed the keys back to Isabella. "I appreciate you not telling my grandpa about what Bianca and I did. He's too old to handle that kind of news."

"So, is this car supposed to make up for it?" Isabella asked coldly. She had almost died on the operating table, and now a car was supposed to make it all better?

John shook his head, knowing a car wasn't enough. It couldn't make up for what Isabella had been through.

"The car is just a small thank you. So, what kind of compensation do you want?" John asked.

Without missing a beat, Isabella said, "Just like before, I want one of Bianca's kidneys!"

John's brows furrowed, and he immediately shook his head. "That's not happening. You must have heard by now. Bianca is pregnant. She's carrying my child."

"Then I don't need any compensation. Bianca almost killed me. No amount of money can erase the trauma in my heart." Isabella sneered and then walked away with the keys.

Since it was just a small token of gratitude, Isabella didn't refuse.

Isabella drove back to the company with Avery.

Once Isabella got to the company, Carol called her in.

Isabella walked into Carol's office with a smile and said, "Sometimes I feel like I'm your employee, not the CEO. What's up?"

Carol looked up and rolled her eyes. "Do you hear yourself? This company isn't my family's business. If it were, I wouldn't be as relaxed as you."

Carol handed a document to Isabella. "The celebrity who used to endorse our clothing line wants to end the contract. We need a new endorser."

Isabella opened the document and saw information about their clothing brand's philosophy and the reasons for the previous female celebrity's contract termination.

"She's quitting because she's having a baby and doesn't want to work or endorse anything?" Isabella looked at Carol, surprised.

Carol shrugged, "That's what she said. Since we don't have maternity items, it's normal for her not to endorse us. We need to shoot new ads regularly, which isn't ideal when pregnant."

Isabella set down the document and asked Carol, "Shouldn't you handle finding a new endorser? You have the authority to choose who will be the new celebrity endorser. So, why did you call me in? Is there another reason?"

Carol nodded and snapped her fingers. "You're indeed a smart CEO. I want you to sign Ms. Foster. She's very popular right now, not only starring in several big movies but also backed by a mysterious man. Her popularity can definitely boost our products."

As Carol spoke, Isabella understood. Carol wanted to leverage Isabella's relationship with John or maybe delegate to Mason to have Estella endorse their company. After all, they had such resources.

But Isabella shook her head. "I don't want to bother anyone from the Williams Family. And have you thought about the fact that Estella is close to Zoey?"

"Zoey?" Carol repeated, suddenly remembering that she was Paxton's wife.

"I really don't know about any connection between Estella and the Brown Family. Do they have any collaboration?" Carol asked, curious.

Isabella nodded, "I haven't seen their collaboration firsthand since I wasn't there when they signed the contract. But given their good relationship, they might be willing to endorse some products for the Brown Family. My relationship with the Browns isn't great, and I don't want to put Ms. Foster in a difficult position."

Isabella shrugged. She had a good impression of Estella, a gentle and kind woman. If Isabella asked Mason to have Estella endorse for them, it would put her in an awkward position between friends and family, which would be embarrassing.

Carol sighed, crossed her arms, and leaned on the desk. "So, what do we do now? This celebrity doesn't have any scandals at least. Finding a new one could take days, and I'll need to dig into their background for any dirt."

Lately, too many celebrities have been exposed for outrageous actions, like tax evasion, drug use, infidelity, or involvement in sensitive political topics. These could have a significant impact on our products.

Isabella patted Carol's shoulder with a smile. "It's okay, I believe you can do it! You'll definitely find the right person!"

Carol rolled her eyes, pushed Isabella's hand away, and sat back at her desk. "You can go back to your office and play. I need to get back to work."

Carol waved her hand dismissively and lowered her head to continue working on the documents. Isabella wasn't offended and left with a smile.

Meanwhile, across the ocean, Michael was already dealing with the company's affairs.

To Michael, the trouble caused by Ryan this time wasn't significant. He could easily handle it, but the only hassle was the time-consuming process of contacting those clients, which kept him away from Isabella.

"Have you found Ryan yet?" Michael asked Jerry.

Michael had just left a client's company, the third one he had visited. He was very annoyed by the trouble caused by Ryan.

Jerry smiled bitterly and shook his head. "I'm sorry, Mr. Williams, we still haven't found Ryan."

Michael nodded calmly, his expression unreadable.

Jerry hesitated and said, "Mr. Williams, it's suspicious how our client list got leaked this time. I suspect someone inside is working for Ryan, or maybe..."

Jerry trailed off.

Michael coldly finished his sentence, "You mean someone has betrayed me, right?"

Jerry nodded.

###chapter 380 Strategy

Michael's top brass, the ones with access to customer info, have been with him forever. Jerry can't wrap his head around the idea that someone would stab Michael in the back.

Michael glanced up at Jerry, a grin spreading across his face. "So, who do you think did it?"

Jerry frowned, shaking his head. "I don't know, but I've got a few suspects. I've had them watched. I bet Ryan offered a fat paycheck to the traitor, and they couldn't resist."

"Human desires are like a snowball rolling down a hill; once it starts, it just keeps going. Is that what you're getting at?" Michael kept grinning at Jerry.

Jerry nodded but then went quiet for a bit. "Or maybe the traitor got caught in a bind, and Ryan blackmailed them. That's totally Ryan's style."

Jerry probably remembered that time Isabella strong-armed those minority shareholders into giving up their shares.

Michael stretched and got up from the couch. "Both your theories are solid, but I've got a third one."

"What other theory?" Jerry looked puzzled.

Michael walked over to the liquor cabinet and poured two glasses of wine.

"Isabella always brings work home and sometimes asks me about tricky business stuff. So, I've got a pretty good handle on what's going on at her company," Michael said with a smile.

Jerry caught on quickly. Holding his glass, he asked, "Mr. Williams, are you saying a senior manager took files home and their family spilled the beans?"

Michael nodded. "We can't rule it out. You know what to do now, right?"

Jerry nodded. "Got it. I'll put more eyes on the families of those senior managers."

Michael shook his head, still smiling. "If word gets out, it'll drive a wedge between us and the other senior managers. Ryan might be banking on that."

Jerry hesitated, a cold sweat breaking out on his back. If he went through with his plan, he might catch the mole, but the other senior managers would think Michael was threatening their families, causing a rift and maybe even pushing them towards Ryan.

Jerry looked at Michael, wanting to ask what to do next.

But Michael's calm gaze made Jerry's heart race. He knew Michael was testing him.

Frowning, Jerry thought for a moment, then his eyes lit up. "Tracking takes too long. Maybe we should go for a simpler approach, like direct questioning. I'll get the best psychologist to grill those senior managers."

Michael nodded, pleased. "Sounds like a plan. Go for it."

Jerry downed his wine and left the office.

After Jerry left, Michael sipped his wine and let out a soft sigh. He was really hoping it was the third scenario he mentioned, rather than the first two Jerry brought up.

He had a soft spot for these long-time employees who had been with him through thick and thin. The last thing he wanted was to find a traitor among them.

After spending nearly a week abroad, Michael finally wrapped up those pesky matters.

After sealing the deal with the last client, Michael booked a flight home that night. He couldn't wait to see Isabella.

As soon as Michael got in the car, Jerry hit him with some news.

"Mr. Williams, after a week of digging, we've got our prime suspect." Jerry handed a document to Michael.

Michael raised an eyebrow as he looked at the document. "Anson and his wife? They've been married for less than a year, right?"

Michael remembered Anson Church, the youngest and most promising employee.

Anson was a hardworking guy. Thanks to Michael's promotion, Anson had always been loyal and would never betray the company. Plus, he had a clean record, so no one could have any dirt on him.

When Jerry handed over the info about Anson's wife, Michael knew she had to be the problem.

Jerry nodded. "Yeah, Anson was too busy with work to get married until he met his wife at a banquet, and then they tied the knot. You even went to his wedding."

Michael nodded, signaling Jerry to go on. "I consulted the best psychologist, Mr. Rojas. We questioned different senior managers. When we asked Mr. Church about bringing work files home, he hesitated for a moment and then claimed he left the files at the office that night. Mr. Rojas picked up on that hesitation." Jerry recounted the interrogation process.

Michael listened calmly and finally sighed. "Anson has always been all about his work. Now that he finally has a woman he loves deeply, he wouldn't give that up easily. Maybe he's still holding out hope and wants to ask his wife if she did anything to harm the company."

Jerry asked seriously, "Should we punish Anson and his wife?"

Michael shook his head. "Don't worry about Anson betraying us. With his character, he wouldn't do such a thing. Once he finds out his wife betrayed him, he'll probably resign and leave this profession."

Michael rubbed his forehead and then smiled. "Never thought I'd have to worry about my employees' marriages as a boss."

Michael shook his head with a smile, then his expression turned serious. "Go find Anson and tell him I don't blame him for this. Ryan will likely use this to threaten Anson with his wife as leverage. That sneaky fox likes to hide in his den, so I need someone to go in and flush him out."

Jerry got it. Anson would be the perfect pawn to deal with Ryan.

###chapter 381 You Can Be a Spokesperson

After making plans, Michael and Jerry hopped on the plane back home.

Later that night, Isabella got home and noticed the lights were on, which made her a bit uneasy.

She cautiously stepped inside, gripping a baseball bat she grabbed from behind the door, only to see Michael coming out of the kitchen with a plate in his hand.

"Planning to whack me with that bat?" Michael asked, grinning.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Why didn't you tell me you were coming back today? I thought there was a burglar in the house."

She dropped the bat on the floor and walked over to hug Michael.

With one hand holding the plate and the other ruffling Isabella's hair, Michael kissed her on the forehead.

"When you think there's a thief in the house, the first thing you should do is call security, not charge in with a bat, got it?" Michael said, sounding a bit scolding.

Nodding in his arms, Isabella realized how much she had missed him. Even though they talked on the phone sometimes, it just wasn't the same.

"Alright, wash your hands and let's have a late-night snack," Michael smiled, gently pushing her away and setting the plate on the table.

"I got back late and saw you weren't home, so I figured you were working overtime. You've probably been too busy to eat dinner. Come and try what I made." Michael smiled warmly, watching Isabella come out of the bathroom and sit down to eat.

"I am a bit hungry. Work's been crazy lately," Isabella said as she dug into the food, filling Michael in on the latest at the company.

Sitting across from her, Michael listened quietly. When Isabella mentioned that Carol wanted her to find a spokesperson, Michael grinned.

"Looking for a celebrity to endorse your products?" he asked, still smiling.

Isabella nodded. "Yeah, got any good suggestions? Don't worry, I won't get jealous of a female celebrity."

Leaning back in his chair, Michael looked at her. "You don't need a celebrity. There's a perfect spokesperson right here."

Isabella paused, giving him a strange look. "You want to endorse our company? Come on, we sell women's clothing! Remember when you wore women's clothes in college? It was a disaster. I can't go through that again."

Michael waved his hand, looking a bit exasperated. "How did you come up with that? I mean you should endorse your company's products."

Isabella hesitated, pointing to herself. "Me? But I'm the CEO."

Michael gestured up and down at her. "First of all, do you think you're beautiful?"

Isabella nodded. "Of course, I'm beautiful. Back then, the line of guys chasing me could stretch all the way to Imperial City."

"Then can you ask one of them to bring me a bottle of wine?" Michael joked with a smile.

Rolling her eyes, Isabella said, "Enough, let's not joke around."

Michael shook his head with a smile. "I'm not joking, babe. You're gorgeous and have a great figure. Plus, you're the CEO. It's perfect for you to endorse your own products. You won't have to worry about any celebrity scandals affecting the company."

Isabella thought about it for a moment, then shook her head with a bitter smile. "Let's just forget it. I really don't want to be in the spotlight."

"Babe, it's not about being a celebrity. You're just endorsing your own products. Trust me, people are tired of those weird celebrities. Public figures aren't just celebrities; they include amazing CEOs like you," Michael insisted.

He knew she needed some time to warm up to the idea, so he didn't push her.

"Alright, it's late. Let's think about it tomorrow. Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow's another busy day," Michael said, walking over to massage her forehead to help her relax.

Isabella nodded, holding his hand with a smile. "So, did you finish everything on your business trip?"

Michael nodded. "Yep, everything went smoothly! I just showed up, and the clients were all like, 'We want to keep signing contracts with you!'"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "You really know how to joke! Do you think you're King Arthur or something?"

Michael chuckled, "Maybe I was King Arthur in a past life."

Smiling, Isabella got up from the chair. "I'm done eating. Time to brush my teeth and hit the sack."

She kissed Michael on the corner of his mouth and headed to the bathroom.

Michael started cleaning up the plates and got ready to wash them in the kitchen.

From the bathroom, Isabella called out, "Michael, don't forget to take your medicine."

Michael's face stiffened, and he forced a smile. "Got it, babe. Just to clarify, it's for maintenance, not treatment!"

Even though he said that, Michael went to the fridge, took out a bag of medicine, and put it in hot water.

Meanwhile, Bianca took out the hot medicine from the water, opened the bag, and drank it all.

The medicine tasted bitter, but for the sake of her unborn child, Bianca endured the nausea and finished it.

"The weather's nice today. I hope you bring me some good news," Bianca said, sitting down and popping a piece of candy into her mouth.

Her assistant, Daphne Rose, smiled. "Ms. Taylor, with Mr. Williams' help, we've signed several good designers. The first batch of clothing samples will be ready soon. Once they're done, we can look for celebrities to endorse them."

Lying on the lounger, the sunlight warming her face, Bianca felt very comfortable.

After hearing Daphne's words, Bianca nodded lightly.

"Oh, by the way, how's Isabella's company doing?" Bianca asked with a smile.

###chapter 382 Bianca's Threat

Daphne's face was a bit tight. John had moved her over to Bianca's team, and she was well aware of the beef between Bianca and Isabella. She'd also heard that John didn't want Bianca to keep butting heads with Isabella.

Bianca could read Daphne's mind from her hesitant look.

With a slight smile, Bianca asked, "Ms. Rose, do you know why I picked you when John suggested you as my assistant?"

Daphne shook her head, honestly clueless.

When John was picking an assistant for Bianca, he showed her a bunch of resumes. Bianca took her time and eventually chose Daphne. John was confused since Daphne's resume wasn't anything special.

Bianca smiled again and said, "You should know there were plenty of candidates with fancy degrees, while you're just a girl from the sticks. Even though you work hard and have some recommendations, have you ever thought that without me, your whole career would be just another office job, sharing a cheap apartment, and maybe not even affording the handbags you like?"

Daphne swallowed hard, knowing Bianca was right. In this world, hard work alone doesn't cut it without connections and a bit of luck.

Seeing Daphne's reaction, Bianca continued with a smile, "I know what you're worried about, and you might have even thought about telling John what I asked you. But then what? Do you think he'll thank you? Or give you a promotion?"

Daphne's face went pale; she had indeed thought about it.

Bianca walked over to Daphne and whispered in her ear, "Even if you tell John, what difference will it make? I'm his beloved, carrying his child. He won't blame me. But if you cross me, what do you think will happen to you?"

Daphne's legs started to shake.

"Alright, don't freak out. I'm not a monster." Bianca laughed, covering her mouth, and then sat back down.

"I asked you about my sister not to target her. She's my competitor now, and we need to take market share from her. It's just business." Bianca smiled faintly.

Daphne felt a bit relieved hearing that. At least Bianca's reasons seemed legit.

"The spokesperson for Isabella's company has ended their contract, and they're looking for a new one. Rumor has it they want to get Ms. Foster as their new spokesperson," Daphne said.

Bianca tapped her fingers on the table. She knew Estella. If Bianca ended up marrying John, Estella would be her aunt.

Bianca asked Daphne to dig up some info on Estella.

After hearing what Daphne found, Bianca smiled and said, "Looks like Estella would be perfect as our spokesperson."Daphne was caught off guard. Wasn't this all about competing with Isabella for a spokesperson? And yet, Bianca claimed it wasn't about targeting Isabella.

For now, Daphne decided not to tell John about this. After all, the spokesperson decision wasn't hers to make. Even if John got upset, he'd go to Bianca, not her.

"Go find out how much Isabella plans to offer Estella as a spokesperson," Bianca said calmly.

Daphne nodded and left the office.

Meanwhile, Isabella had no clue what Bianca was plotting. If she did, she'd probably laugh, because she never even considered Estella for their spokesperson.

Right now, Isabella was in her office, listening to Carol's report on the spokesperson search.

"I looked into it like you asked, and Estella's already signed on for several endorsements with the Brown Family, including cosmetics and cars," Carol reported.

Isabella nodded, not surprised. She had a hunch this was the case.

"Tell me something new. Have you found any suitable celebrities?" Isabella asked.

Carol sighed, "Honestly, I can't find anyone good. The ones I like are already tied up with other clothing brands, and the rest just don't cut it."

Isabella frowned. "What about that pretty actress from the recent movie, Susan? She hasn't endorsed any clothing brands, right?"

Carol smirked. "Do you know Susan is the mistress of a high-ranking member of one of the Big Four families?"

Isabella paused and started searching for other female celebrities on her phone.

"What about this one, Malinda?" Isabella asked.

"She's a drug addict, and I doubt she can keep it under wraps much longer," Carol said indifferently.

Isabella kept asking about more female celebrities, but Carol shot them all down.

"Ms. Taylor, you should buy a lottery ticket. Every celebrity with a scandal, you've mentioned," Carol joked.

Isabella scratched her head in frustration. "Is the entertainment industry really this messed up now?"

Carol shrugged. "I know even worse stuff. Want to hear?"

Isabella shook her head. She hadn't eaten yet and didn't want to lose her appetite.

"Seems my husband was right. The entertainment industry is really chaotic now. Should I really do what he suggested?" Isabella mused, tapping her forehead.

Curious, Carol asked, "Did your husband give you advice? Care to share?"

"He suggested I become the company's spokesperson," Isabella said, sharing Michael's suggestion from last night.

Isabella looked at Carol, wanting her opinion, and saw a serious look in Carol's eyes.

"I think your husband is right," Carol suddenly said.

###chapter 383 You Can be the Spokesperson

Isabella never thought Carol would actually go along with Michael's idea.

"Do you really think I'm the right fit to be a spokesperson?" Isabella asked, raising an eyebrow.

Carol nodded confidently. "Absolutely. With how popular you are in this city right now, you'd bring a ton of attention to our company!"

Isabella mulled over Carol's words. It made sense. She'd gained quite a following online, mostly because of all the drama with her family and Bianca. People were always leaving supportive comments on her social media.

"Alright, if you both think it's a good idea, I'll give it a shot," Isabella finally agreed with a nod. It seemed like the best move for now.

Just then, Carol's phone rang. As she answered, her expression shifted.

Isabella watched, curiosity piqued.

When Carol hung up, Isabella asked, "What's up?"

Carol looked at her and said, "Your sister's started a new company in the fashion industry too. She's been asking about our offer to sign Estella."

Carol shrugged, a mischievous glint in her eye.

"Bianca's in fashion too? This is definitely aimed at me. Looks like John's fallen for Bianca's tricks again," Isabella sneered.

"What are you gonna do? Bianca thinks we want Estella as our spokesperson. Can we use that against her?" Carol asked.

Isabella nodded. "Oh, definitely. Since she's asking for a quote, tell her we're ready to offer Ms. Foster an $80 million annual salary for the endorsement."

Carol blinked, looking a bit taken aback. "So you want Bianca to chase Estella with a hundred million dollars! But isn't $80 million a bit much? Will she buy it?"

"Banks loan money, why not for an endorsement fee? It's just fake news anyway, just a phone call," Isabella chuckled, pulling out her phone to call Mason.

Mason was a bit surprised by Isabella's call. After hearing her plan, he chuckled and shook his head.

"You're really planning to outsmart John," Mason laughed.

Bianca doesn't have that kind of money. In the end, John will have to foot the bill.

Isabella smiled at Mason. "I'm not forcing him to pay for Bianca. It's still John's decision. If he doesn't want to pay, no one can make him. And even if he does, so what? Ms. Foster is John's uncle's wife, part of the Williams Family. It's not like the money's going to an outsider."

Isabella's words amused Mason. He eventually nodded, agreeing to go along with her plan.

After hanging up, Isabella turned to Carol with a smile. "See, problem solved."

Carol gave her a thumbs up. "I knew I made the right choice. You're way smarter than Bianca."

Meanwhile, Mason was mulling over Isabella's plan. He couldn't just call John and tell him Isabella wanted $80 million for Estella's endorsement. That would raise too many red flags. He needed the right moment.

Mason thought for a bit and called Charles over, explaining Isabella's scheme.

"How do I get John over here? What excuse should I use?" Mason asked.

Charles, with a wry smile, was surprised Mason was helping someone plot against John.

After some thought, Charles came up with a plan.

"Mr. Williams, even though Ms. Taylor isn't exactly our favorite person, the baby she's carrying is still part of our family. You could send me to deliver some mother and baby products to John. When he gets them, he'll be curious and ask questions. That's when I can drop the hint about the endorsement, and he'll likely tell Bianca," Charles suggested.

Mason thought it over and smiled. "Good idea. Go ahead and pick out some nice mother and baby products."

"Got it, Mr. Williams. I'll go get them now," Charles nodded and left the villa.

An hour later, Charles drove to John's vineyard. John had been staying there to avoid potential threats, thinking danger could come from the four major families and Isabella's fight for shares.

Now that Isabella had all the family shares and was in charge, there was no need to target Bianca anymore.

But with Bianca pregnant, John was still keeping her safe at the vineyard.

When John heard Charles was visiting, he was visibly surprised.

John hurried out to greet Charles and was even more surprised to see him unloading mother and baby products from the car.

"Are these from my grandpa?" John asked, astonished.

Bianca stood beside John, her face lighting up with excitement and joy.

If Mason had arranged all this, it meant he was starting to accept her, all because of the baby she was carrying.

Charles smiled and nodded. "Yes, Mr. John Williams. Your grandpa sent these. Even though Ms. Taylor has made mistakes, the baby is still part of the Williams Family. Mr. Mason Williams said the child is innocent."

Charles' message was clear. Mason sent the gifts for the baby, not Bianca. Until the baby was born, Bianca couldn't enter the Williams Villa.

Bianca looked a bit embarrassed but didn't say anything.

John sighed softly. "Thank my grandpa for me. By the way, how has he been lately? Is everything okay at home?"

Charles was about to speak when he glanced at Bianca and suddenly stopped.

Bianca got the hint. She smiled and said, "You two go ahead and talk. I'll have someone bring these inside."

###chapter 384 Fake News

Bianca told the winery staff to move the maternity supplies to the villa and followed them inside.

Once Bianca was gone, John frowned and turned to Charles. "I thought Grandpa was cool with Bianca. Why couldn't we tell her?"

Charles shook his head with a bitter smile. "You got it wrong, John. It's about Isabella. I didn't want to upset Ms. Taylor and risk affecting the baby's health."

John let out a sigh of relief, realizing Mason wasn't badmouthing Bianca again.

"What's Grandpa's situation got to do with Isabella?" John asked, curious.

Charles explained, "Isabella's company needs a female celebrity to endorse their clothing line. She picked Ms. Foster and offered her an $80 million annual salary."

"$80 million? Can she even afford that?" John sneered, knowing Isabella's company well. Even with Jasper's help, there was no way she could come up with $80 million for an endorsement. It would hurt the company's growth.

Charles nodded, "Mr. Mason Williams thinks $80 million is too much. But Isabella insists. Seems like she has other motives but can't pay it all at once. So she wants Mr. Mason Williams to ask Ms. Foster for a six-month extension."

John furrowed his brow. If given six months, Isabella might raise the $80 million. But why would she do that? It's a huge sum.

Charles knew he had taken the bait and smiled as he said goodbye.

After Charles left, John headed back to the villa.

Inside, Bianca was organizing the maternity supplies Mason had sent over.

"Mason is thoughtful too. These supplies are top-notch. Let's use them," Bianca said with a smile, looking at John.

John nodded absentmindedly, still thinking about why Isabella wanted to spend $80 million on this.

Bianca noticed John's contemplative look and guessed it had something to do with what Charles had said.

"What's up, babe? Something bothering you? Tell me, maybe I can help," Bianca held John's hand and asked with a smile.

After some thought, John finally told Bianca about Isabella's plan to spend $80 million to get Estella for the endorsement.

A glint appeared in Bianca's eyes.

Bianca thought, 'Isabella wants to spend that much to sign Estella? No way I'm letting that happen! But isn't $80 million too high? Is Estella really worth that?' Bianca furrowed her brow, trying to figure out Isabella's motives.

Suddenly, John's eyes lit up. He clapped his hands and exclaimed, "I know why."Bianca looked at John, confused, waiting for him to explain.

John took Bianca's hand and sat down on the nearby sofa, excitement in his voice. "I figured it out. Isabella wants Estella to endorse, but her real target is my uncle!"

"Your uncle? The most mysterious guy in the family?" Bianca asked, intrigued.

Bianca had always been curious about John's uncle. Was he as charming as the rumors said? But thanks to Michael's deliberate secrecy, she hadn't even seen a photo of him.

Fate can be so weird sometimes. Bianca spent all her time with John and hadn't even seen Michael!

John explained, "Even though my uncle has started developing businesses here, most of his ventures are still overseas. The domestic market is saturated. If Isabella wants more growth and benefits, she needs to expand internationally. She wants to use the $80 million endorsement fee to impress my uncle and leverage his power to go global!"

John's theory made a lot of sense, even in ways Isabella herself might not have considered.

Bianca felt something was off, but what John said did make sense. Pearl had always wanted to marry John's uncle to use his influence overseas to expand the family.

"If that's the case, everything clicks." A cold smile appeared on Bianca's lips.

Earlier, Bianca had someone look into Isabella's endorsement offer, and now this news suddenly made everything clear.

"Darling, our clothing brand also needs a spokesperson. I think Ms. Foster would be perfect, and she's your aunt, so she probably won't refuse you." Bianca held John's hand and smiled.

John frowned. He didn't want to go against Isabella now; there was no need to make an enemy over an endorsement.

"Why does it have to be Estella? Can't we find someone else?" John asked.

Bianca smiled and said, "There are so many celebrity scandals these days. I can't guarantee we'll find a truly clean star. But I know Ms. Foster's background; she's definitely not involved in any scandals. She's the best person to endorse our product. And while Isabella's paying in installments, we can pay upfront."

John still wanted to refuse. "Darling, let's think this over."

Bianca got a bit anxious. Without John's help, signing Estella wouldn't be easy.

"Alright, dear, why don't you invite Estella out, and we'll talk to her. Hear her thoughts. If she's willing to help Isabella, I'll drop it and never bring it up again," Bianca said, trying to persuade John.

###chapter 385 Estella's Plan

John paused for a second, then gave a nod.

Meanwhile, Charles went back and filled Mason in on the successful plan.

Mason wasted no time and called Isabella to share the news.

"Got it, Mason. Thanks for the heads-up," Isabella said with a smile before hanging up.

Isabella had just gotten home. As she walked in, she saw Michael busy making dinner.

Seeing her smile, Michael could tell she was in a good mood.

"What's up? Why the big smile?" Michael asked, grinning.

Isabella walked over, wrapped her arms around Michael's neck, and said, "Guess why I'm so happy, babe?"

Michael tilted his head, thought for a moment, then said dramatically, "Did you win a billion dollars in the lottery or something? Wow, you're incredible!"

Isabella laughed at his over-the-top reaction and playfully pinched his nose. "Come on, babe, be serious. You know I don't play the lottery."

"Alright. I have no idea what could make you this happy," Michael said, shrugging.

"I came up with a plan to outsmart John today, and it's already halfway there. I'm feeling great," Isabella said, beaming.

Michael looked surprised. "Outsmarting John? Why? Didn't he just give you a car?"

Michael was curious. Isabella had already told him about John giving her a car. He wasn't jealous; he just thought it was silly to think a car could make up for everything.

"It's because Bianca wanted to find out about our company's spokesperson," Isabella explained Bianca's scheme and her counter-plan against Bianca and John.

"Got it. I didn't think Mason would help you out. Now it all depends on what Ms. Foster thinks," Michael said, wrapping his arms around Isabella's waist.

Isabella nodded. "Exactly. Even though this is a plan against Bianca and John, the key part is Ms. Foster. Will she agree to let Bianca be the spokesperson?"

"If Bianca's willing to shell out 80 million dollars or more, who knows? Money talks," Michael said with a grin.

"I don't think Ms. Foster is that shallow. Her husband wouldn't even blink at 80 million or a hundred million dollars," Isabella said, but then her phone rang.

She glanced at the caller ID, frowned a bit, and let go of Michael. "Babe, I need to take this."

Isabella went to the balcony to answer the call. Meanwhile, Michael pulled out his phone to make a call of his own.

On the balcony, Isabella heard the private detective's voice.

"Ms. Taylor, from my tracking and investigation, it looks like the woman contacted someone from Avalonia. My friend at the bank found millions in the account she used to exchange currency, and the bank is from Avalonia. But I hit a wall because she's already flown out of the country," the detective said, sounding frustrated. His reach didn't extend beyond their borders.

"Send me the name of the bank for the transfer. I'll take care of the rest and get your final payment to you," Isabella said, pleased with the detective's findings.

After a brief chat, Isabella transferred the final payment to the private detective.

Meanwhile, Michael was on the phone with Estella.

He had planned to call Jerry, but Jerry was overseas handling Anson's affairs, so he had to reach out to Estella directly.

When Estella saw Michael's call, she felt a mix of excitement and nerves.

"Hello, sir. Is there something you need me to do?" Estella asked, her voice a bit shaky.

Michael chuckled. "No need to be nervous. I just wanted to give you a heads-up. If Bianca and John approach you for an endorsement, don't turn them down. But make sure to ask for a high price-at least a hundred million dollars."

Estella's eyes widened. With her current status, even ten million would be a lot, let alone a hundred million.

"Okay, sir, I understand. I'll do as you say," Estella agreed.

Michael was about to hang up when he added, "Do you need a reason to ask for that much? If you go straight for a hundred million, John might not bite."

"Don't worry, sir. I've got a plan. If I can leverage your reputation a bit, I think John and Bianca won't refuse," Estella said, then laid out her plan.

After listening, Michael nodded. "Sounds solid. You're a smart woman. You know what to do next. I'll leave it in your hands."

"Don't worry, sir. I'll get it done," Estella said, thrilled by Michael's praise.

After Michael hung up, Isabella came back from the balcony.

They didn't ask each other about their calls, as they had an understanding to keep their secrets as long as they stayed loyal to each other.

"Dinner's ready," Michael said, leading Isabella to the table.

"Hold on, let me wash my hands first." Isabella went to the bathroom, washed up, and then joined Michael at the table.

Michael remembered something and asked with a smile, "Have you decided on your company's endorser yet?"

Isabella smiled and pointed to herself. "I'm thinking about doing it myself, but I'm still a bit unsure. I plan to hold a meeting to get everyone's input."

"I doubt anyone will object. You're an amazing woman," Michael said, complimenting her.

Meanwhile, Estella got a call from John shortly after hanging up with Michael.

"Estella, do you have a moment? I need to discuss something with you," John said over the phone.

###chapter 386 Endorsement Fee

Estella didn't expect John's call to come so soon. She knew what it was about but decided to play dumb.

"Actually, I've got plenty of time. I was supposed to have dinner with Zoey, but she canceled. I was just gonna grab something on my own," Estella said with a smile.

On the other end, John's eyes lit up as he glanced at Bianca.

"Estella, how about this? My girlfriend and I want to invite you to dinner and chat about something," John said.

Estella agreed, changed her clothes, and drove to the spot John mentioned.

Outside the restaurant, she saw John standing with Bianca from a distance.

Bianca waved. "Estella, over here."

Estella walked over, smiling, and Bianca led her inside.

To keep things private, John had booked a room where they wouldn't be disturbed.

"Estella, the food here is amazing. I ordered their specialty dish. See if you want anything else," John said, handing her the menu.

Estella glanced at it, unfamiliar with most of the dishes. To hide her embarrassment, she handed the menu back to John.

"It's fine, I'm not picky. Just order whatever you guys like," she said, smiling.

A flicker of disdain crossed John's eyes. He didn't think much of Estella's career and saw her marrying Michael as the luckiest break she'd ever get. 'We celebrities might seem glamorous, but to big families, we're just regular folks,' Estella thought, picking up on his vibe.

John thought he was being subtle, but Estella noticed something was off.

While waiting for the food, Estella asked with a smile, "Didn't you say you had something to discuss with me? What's up?"

John glanced at Bianca.

Bianca, sitting next to Estella, poured her a drink and smiled. "Actually, I recently started a clothing company and would love for you to endorse it."

Using her acting skills, Estella feigned surprise. "You want me to endorse it? You could get more famous celebrities."

She looked curiously at Bianca and John.

Bianca, ready with her pitch, smiled. "John and I see great potential in you. We want to sign you for an endorsement while you're still early in your career. Otherwise, when you get more popular, your fee will definitely go up."

Bianca's words sounded sweet and reassuring to Estella. Maybe Bianca wasn't as useless as people said.

If Michael hadn't given her a heads-up, Estella might have agreed. But with a plan in mind, she wasn't going to say yes so easily.

Estella put on a look of embarrassment, and Bianca noticed right away.

"What's wrong, Estella? Are you having any trouble? You can tell us, John and I will help you," Bianca said, holding Estella's hand.

Estella sighed softly. "Well, Mason told me today that Isabella wants me to endorse her brand. She hasn't paid yet, but the offer of 80 million dollars is really tempting."

During a call with Michael, Estella had already learned about Isabella's plan and the 80 million dollars.

Bianca's expression shifted slightly when she heard the amount.

"Estella, you can't agree to Isabella's plan. She's just using you," Bianca speculated, thinking Isabella might be using Estella to boost her overseas influence.

Estella acted shocked. 'Wow, am I really that important? Bianca's analysis isn't wrong. Paxton might have kept Zoey in touch with me for this reason. It's a pity none of you know I'm fake,' Estella thought to herself.

"So that's how it is. If she could just give me the 80 million dollars directly, maybe I would have agreed right away," Estella sighed, looking conflicted.

Bianca's eyes lit up with excitement. From Estella's tone, it seemed like if she paid the 80 million dollars, Estella would endorse her company.

"Estella, Isabella's company is just starting out and definitely can't come up with 80 million dollars. She can only rely on Mason's reputation for now, but we can come up with the money immediately," Bianca said proudly.

Estella's eyes showed a hint of surprise, but then she sighed softly. "Let's forget about it. Mason already mentioned this to me. If I agree to you directly, wouldn't that offend him?"

Bianca frowned slightly, but John saw an opportunity.

"Estella, do you need money badly?" John asked curiously.

Bianca also looked at Estella doubtfully. As Michael's wife, she shouldn't be short of money, right?

Estella nodded, looking a bit embarrassed. "I recently found a great script. I really want to play the lead role. But because it's a sci-fi film, the requirements for special effects and props are very high, which means it requires a lot of money. I'm still short of 100 million dollars now, and because I can't be sure of the box office, I don't want my husband to pay for me."

Estella explained why she needed the money. In fact, she did have such a script and was short of funds.

Who says lying always requires false words? With true words and real events, the same purpose can be achieved.

###chapter 387 Collaboration Achieved

Bianca's face went rigid when she heard Estella needed a billion dollars. Sure, John could come up with the cash, but was it really worth that much?

Bianca felt a twinge of guilt for spending so much just to go after Isabella.

"Is a billion dollars really enough?" John asked, sounding doubtful.

Estella nodded. "A hundred million is our lowball estimate. The real cost could be higher. Since I married your uncle, people think I'm just lucky. I want to prove myself with results. He'd happily fund this, but I want to surprise him with a box office hit."

John nodded slightly, tapping his fingers on the table.

Bianca looked at John, waiting for his take.

Finally, John turned to Bianca and smiled. "Estella, we can give you a billion dollars. But we want to invest in the movie."

Estella's face lit up, then quickly turned worried. "We can't mix investment with endorsement deals," she said. "If you invest, I won't see a dime from either the film profits or the endorsement fees. I'd be left with nothing."

"That's a billion dollars. Do you think it's that easy to make?" John scoffed.

Estella gritted her teeth, looking annoyed.

Bianca quickly stepped in, holding John's hand and smiling, "Honey, don't talk to Estella like that. She's family! But we can still discuss this."

Bianca whispered to John, "Sweetie, don't get too worked up. Let's have Estella send over the script first. If it's worth it, we might consider investing more on top of the endorsement fee."

John glanced at Estella, who looked pretty upset, but he nodded at Bianca's suggestion.

Bianca turned to Estella and said, "Estella, we'd like to see the script first."

Estella nodded and pulled the script from her bag, anticipating this might come up.

When Bianca saw the script, a spark lit up in her eyes. She knew Estella's concern about offending Mason was just a ploy to get John to spend more.

Bianca and John started reading the script. After about half an hour, John's brows furrowed deeply.

"The sun is dying, so they're putting an engine on Earth to escape? Who wrote this nonsense? Is there any investment value in this kind of script?" John didn't hold back his criticism.

John glanced at Estella, clearly looking down on her.

Estella's face grew more unpleasant, and John didn't hide his disdain.

'Is this really the heir of a big family? No class at all. Damn it, looks like I have to agree to John's investment to complete Mr. Williams' task,' Estella thought, sighing inwardly.

Estella truly believed in the script, but John just didn't get it because he wasn't in the film industry. If John invested in the film, as Estella mentioned, she wouldn't see a penny.

"Seems like Mr. Williams thinks I'm not worth investing in. In that case, I'll be on my way," Estella said coldly, putting the script back in her bag and getting ready to leave.

Having been in the entertainment industry for years, Estella was good at reading people. She knew John would stop her before she reached the door.

Sure enough, before John could say anything, Bianca quickly intervened. "Estella, John is just a bit impatient. He didn't mean anything against you." Bianca pulled Estella back to her seat.

Bianca sat back next to John, holding his hand and whispering, "Honey, don't forget you're helping me find an endorser. How am I supposed to face your uncle in the future?"

John took a deep breath, trying to calm down.

"I'm sorry, Estella. I was too impatient earlier," John apologized.

Estella nodded slightly in response.

Bianca smiled at Estella. "Estella, we don't think this movie has any investment value. Let's just talk about the endorsement fee directly."

Estella sighed inwardly. If they only discussed the endorsement fee, she wasn't sure how much John would offer, but it definitely couldn't be less than 80 million dollars.

'If I'm short 20 million dollars, will Mr. Williams blame me for not completing the task?' Estella felt a bit uneasy.

But then John spoke up, "I'll give you an endorsement fee of one billion dollars for a year. We'll handle the promotional work."

John was really willing to spend a billion dollars on the endorsement fee for Bianca.

Estella was both excited and surprised. "Are you really willing to spend a billion dollars?"

John nodded calmly. "This amount is not a big deal for me. As long as my girlfriend is happy."

After saying that, John smiled at Bianca and gently touched her abdomen.

Bianca was very touched.

Estella was also moved, mainly because of the money. She had completed Michael's task.

"Let's have a toast to our collaboration," Estella said, raising her glass.

John raised his glass, and Bianca picked up a glass of juice, as she was pregnant.

"Cheers to our collaboration," Bianca said excitedly.

After dinner, Estella called her driver to pick her up, and then she called Michael.

"Sir, I have completed the task. John did spend a billion dollars for my endorsement," Estella said with a hint of pride in her voice.

###chapter 388 Movie Script

Michael was chilling in bed while Isabella was in the shower.

When Michael got a call from Estella, he was a bit taken aback. Honestly, he didn't think Estella could pull this off. John isn't exactly easy to fool.

But as Estella explained, Michael got it. John had made another decision based on his own personal agenda.

"Sir, this should really hit John hard, right?" Estella asked with a grin.

Michael just shook his head. "John might take a hit, but not as big as you think. Don't underestimate him."

Estella was puzzled. John seemed to have lost a billion dollars. Isn't that a huge deal?

Maybe because Michael was in a good mood, he decided to break it down for her.

"If I'm right, after you sign the contract with John, he's gonna make a big deal out of this sky-high endorsement fee in the media. He'll hype up your potential, and your popularity will skyrocket. Top directors will notice you, and John will use your fame to push his products even more." Michael explained with a smile.

Estella got the picture. John wasn't just throwing away a billion dollars; he was using this endorsement to get even more out of it.

If Estella's so-called husband wasn't John's uncle, John could've been even more ruthless, squeezing every bit of value out of her. Like making her take unwanted roles or even pushing her into shady deals with investors.

The thought of being under John's control made Estella shiver.

"At least my current status makes him think twice," Estella said with a wry smile.

Michael was about to hang up, but Estella stopped him.

"Wait, Mr. Williams. How should I transfer the billion-dollar endorsement fee to you?" Estella suddenly asked.

Michael raised an eyebrow, surprised. "That's the endorsement fee John gave you. Why would you give it to me?"

Estella smiled, "Mr. Williams, I know I'm not worth a billion dollars. Without your influence, I wouldn't have gotten this much. Of course, if you think I'm worth it, you can give me a little bit from the billion. Take the rest as my thanks."

She ended with a joke.

Michael chuckled, "Jerry's got a good eye. You're sharp. I'll take 50 million, and you can keep the rest. You mentioned wanting to invest in movies, right? Think of my 50 million as an investment in you. Just send me the script when you have a chance, and I'll take a look."

Estella agreed and hung up.

After hanging up, Estella was thrilled; she had made the right bet.

Estella had been taking a gamble. She was betting that Michael wouldn't care too much about the billion dollars and that he'd be in a good enough mood to invest in the movie she was passionate about.

Turns out, Estella's gamble paid off. Michael agreed to let her use the money for the investment and even offered to read the script.

Although Michael didn't outright say he'd invest in the movie, Estella was confident his judgment would be better than John's. At the very least, he'd get some movie critics to weigh in.

Estella quickly sent the electronic version of the script to Michael's email. Feeling a bit bored, Michael decided to give it a read.

Just then, the bathroom door opened, and Isabella walked out, towel-drying her hair.

"Hey, what are you so engrossed in?" Isabella asked, curious.

Michael waved his phone and chuckled, "It's a script a filmmaker friend recommended. He said it's totally different from anything out there, so I'm intrigued."

"Really? Now I'm curious too. Let me finish drying my hair, and I'll join you," Isabella said, continuing to blow-dry her hair. Once she was done, she climbed into bed next to Michael to check out the script.

The couple spent nearly an hour reading the script together. When they finished, Michael turned to Isabella.

"So, what do you think? How would this script turn out as a movie?" Michael asked with a smile.

Isabella thought for a moment, her hand on her chin. "This movie is completely different from the usual stuff."

Michael nodded in agreement.

In most sci-fi movies about saving humanity, the protagonist is always a lone hero, thanks to the country's love for individual heroism. But in this script, all of humanity is the protagonist, fighting against the end of the world like ants protecting their last nest, trying to leave a livable world for future generations.

The whole movie's worldview is grand and awe-inspiring. But because it doesn't fit the current mainstream movie trends, John didn't see its potential.

"Honestly, I'm kind of tired of the whole lone hero thing. This movie feels epic and grand. If it's made, it'll definitely be a hit," Isabella said, giving her honest opinion.

Michael nodded. "You're spot on. But making this movie would cost over a billion dollars. Without that kind of budget, it won't capture the world-ending vibe. If the special effects aren't top-notch, the whole thing will flop."

Isabella nodded, a hint of regret in her eyes. "It's a shame I don't have that kind of money. If my family was still one of the big four, I'd definitely invest in this movie. But for now, let's put it on the back burner. I need to focus on more pressing matters."

###chapter 389 Sky-High Endorsement Fee

Isabella was feeling a bit bummed; making this movie was gonna be a tough nut to crack.

But for Michael, cash wasn't a problem.

'If Isabella wants to back this movie, her company's execs will definitely shoot it down. It's like betting on a long shot. Unless she uses her own money, which she doesn't have enough of. I gotta figure out a way to get her a big chunk of change fast,' Michael thought, rubbing his chin.

"What's on your mind? Babe, it's late, we should hit the sack," Isabella said, lying on the bed and smiling at the deep-in-thought Michael.

Michael grinned and shrugged, "Just thinking, if I were the hero in a movie, would they put up a bronze statue of me when I sacrifice myself?"

Isabella rolled her eyes and playfully pinched his nose. "So, this time you're not aiming to be King Arthur leading humanity to glory. Instead, you're gearing up to be a hero astronaut saving us from doomsday, huh?"

Michael sat up, striking a pose he thought looked heroic, and joked, "Don't you think I look like a hero?"

Isabella rolled her eyes again. "A hero who needs to take care of his kidneys? Go to sleep, staying up late is bad for your kidneys."

With that, Isabella pulled the blanket over herself, ready to sleep.

Michael's lips twitched. He sighed and turned off the light.

Suddenly, he felt Isabella snuggle into his arms.

"Okay, I was just messing with you earlier. Women need their beauty sleep too. I saw a tiny wrinkle at the corner of my eye today. So, no more late nights, we need our rest," Isabella said, giving Michael a kiss.

"Goodnight, babe," Isabella said.

"Goodnight, my love," Michael replied softly.

The next day, the city was buzzing with news about Estella's insane endorsement deal.

Just as Michael had predicted.

John announced the hundred-million-dollar endorsement fee, and reporters swarmed Bianca's company building.

Bianca held a press conference with some top designers from the company and Estella.

"Ms. Taylor, why are you willing to pay a hundred million dollars for an endorsement?" a reporter asked Bianca.

Bianca smiled and said, "I believe in Ms. Foster's potential. Her future success is worth way more than a hundred million dollars. Building a good relationship with her is totally worth it."

Another reporter turned to Estella. "Ms. Foster, how did you feel when you heard about the hundred-million-dollar endorsement fee?"

Estella smiled. "Honestly, when I heard Ms. Taylor was signing me for a hundred million dollars, I was speechless. I'm so grateful for her belief in me! I'll make sure to do a great job with the endorsement and not let her down."

Another reporter turned to Bianca, "Ms. Taylor, you're dating Mr. Williams, and Ms. Foster is his aunt. Did you really make a hundred-million-dollar deal, or is this just a publicity stunt with a lower actual fee?"

"We've got proof that we really paid the hundred million," Bianca said, pulling up the bank transfer records. The big screen at the press conference showed the number in all its glory.

Bianca smiled at the reporters. "Even though Estella is family, we don't shortchange family!"

"Ms. Foster, how did your husband feel about the hundred-million-dollar endorsement fee?" another reporter asked, curious about Michael's reaction.

Estella kept her cool. "I should've mentioned earlier that I prefer not to discuss my husband in public. He's a very private person. Let's keep the questions focused on me."

The reporter awkwardly scratched his head and moved on to another question.

Suddenly, a reporter asked, "Ms. Taylor, your sister Isabella also has a clothing company, and there are rumors she's planning to sign Ms. Foster too. Are you trying to one-up Isabella?"

This question was pretty touchy since everyone knew about the beef between Bianca and Isabella.

Some reporters wanted to dig deeper, asking about Bianca's past imprisonment and release because of Isabella, but John had bodyguards at the press conference. Anyone who dared to ask those awkward questions wouldn't have a good time.

Bianca was ready for questions about Isabella, so she didn't get flustered.

"It's just business competition. The conflict between Isabella and me isn't as bad as you think. If Isabella is willing to offer a hundred million for an endorsement, I can step back," Bianca answered smartly.

She had signed Estella for a sky-high fee, and it was clear Isabella couldn't match that. In business, the highest bidder wins. Even if it looked like she was targeting Isabella, there was no way to fault her for it.

Some reporters started asking, "Ms. Taylor, regarding the upcoming Olympics, is your company planning to compete for designing the athletes' clothing?"

"Athletes' clothing design? Has the competition started already?" Isabella asked Carol.

Carol nodded. "Yes, the Olympic Committee announced it last night. This competition is a big deal."

Isabella nodded. She had just gotten to the office and heard about Bianca's press conference on the sky-high endorsement fee.

Isabella had wanted to celebrate their successful plan with Carol, but Carol had some important news.

"We have to enter this clothing design competition!" Isabella said firmly. This was crucial for them.

###chapter 390 Endorsement

Locking down the design for the Olympic athletes' outfits would really put Isabella's company on the map and attract some serious investment.

But Isabella knew the competition was going to be cutthroat.

"Our design team isn't as strong as the others. You used to be a designer, right? I've seen your work, it's top-notch and practical. So, as CEO, this one's on you," Carol said, giving Isabella a supportive pat on the shoulder.

Isabella smirked. Carol sounded more like the CEO than she did.

"Alright, Ms. Lester, I'll nail this. If I don't, you can fire me," Isabella joked, rolling her eyes.

Carol laughed, "Well, I'm excited to see what you come up with, Ms. Taylor."

Isabella shook her head. She wasn't in the mood to celebrate with Carol. She was ready to head back to the office and brainstorm the Olympic designs.

Meanwhile, Bianca wrapped up the press conference and called a meeting.

Bianca sat down with her team of designers.

"Even though our company is new, you all know how crucial it is to land the Olympic clothing design," Bianca told them.

The designers nodded; they knew what was at stake.

"Get your sketches in ASAP. If the Olympic Committee picks our design, there will be a big reward!" Bianca said with a grin.

The designers' eyes lit up with excitement.

Bianca might not be a business expert, but she knew that good incentives and high expectations were key.

With John backing her, the designers were confident Bianca would deliver on her promise.

On another front, Estella left the press conference and went straight to meet the director. She told him about the billion dollars she had and her willingness to invest in a movie. The director was thrilled and immediately started planning the pre-production.

Michael got a call from Jerry.

"Mr. Williams, I spoke with Anson, and he's willing to be our mole. If Ryan contacts him, he'll find out where he is and let us know." Jerry paused. "Oh, and I had some top movie critics read the script you sent. They all think it has huge potential since people are getting tired of superhero flicks. This movie could be a big hit," Jerry reported.

Michael was surprised by how valuable Estella's script was. Investing in movies was always a gamble, but this one seemed like a safe bet.

"Jerry, you always keep it simple. Tell me, how can I get Isabella a big chunk of money without her getting suspicious?" Michael asked.

Jerry hesitated for a moment before answering, "The easiest way is a lottery ticket. But Isabella doesn't seem like the type to buy those. How about a QR code lucky draw?"

Michael's interest was piqued. "What's the plan? Fill me in."

Jerry got excited. "You know the movie 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'? They had those golden tickets hidden in chocolate bars. We could do something similar with a QR code lucky draw through our food or beverage company, with a grand prize of a billion dollars! It'll attract a ton of people, and you can 'win' the big prize!"

Michael's eyes lit up. Jerry's idea was pretty clever.

"Perfect. I'll leave it to you. You can come up with the other prizes too. Just give me the creative ideas. Alright, I'm hanging up now," Michael said, ending the call.

Jerry was initially thrilled with his idea, as it fulfilled his childhood dream of finding a golden ticket. But when Michael dumped the task on him, Jerry was so mad he nearly jumped out of his chair.

"Another job for me? Damn it, when was the last time I had a vacation? I need a break!" Jerry yelled in frustration. After calming down, he sighed and started calling beverage companies to set things up.

Isabella was deep in thought about the Olympic clothing designs when Juliet burst into her office.

"Ms. Taylor, why are you still here? The photographer's waiting for you," Juliet said anxiously.

Isabella's train of thought was interrupted, and she frowned. She looked up at Juliet and asked, "What photographer?"

Juliet looked surprised. "Ms. Taylor, did you forget? You're supposed to do the company endorsement! Ms. Lester set it up herself. The photographer and crew are all here, just waiting for you to change and start shooting."

Isabella was taken aback. She had agreed to it yesterday, but she didn't expect Carol to move so fast!

Isabella rubbed her face with a wry smile. "Carol's efficiency never ceases to amaze me. Let's go meet the photographer."

Isabella and Juliet arrived at the shooting floor, where everything was already set up. The photographer, a man with long hair, looked quite elegant.

"Is this Ms. Taylor? Wow, you are stunning," the photographer greeted her politely.

Isabella smiled; he reminded her of the photographer who took her wedding photos.

"Sir, I have other work to do. Let's get this done quickly. What do I need to wear?" Isabella asked with a smile.

The photographer immediately had someone pick out her outfit.

All the clothes were designed and produced by Isabella's company.

After the shoot, Juliet handed Isabella a glass of water and said enviously, "Ms. Taylor, you are so beautiful! I wish I could be as pretty as you."

Isabella took a sip of water, smiled, and said to Juliet, "Then you can do the next endorsement!"

Juliet's eyes widened in shock.

###chapter 391 Angry Bianca

Juliet was totally caught off guard when Isabella mentioned giving her the next endorsement. She took a step back, hands flailing nervously.

"No way, Ms. Taylor! I'm not as pretty as you, and I'm super nervous. I'd probably mess up the company's image," Juliet stammered, feeling sweat bead on her forehead.

Isabella chuckled and gave Juliet a playful tap on the forehead. "I was just messing with you. Why'd you take it so seriously?"

Juliet let out a sigh of relief, wiping the cold sweat from her brow. "You really scared me, Ms. Taylor. I thought you were serious."

Then Juliet noticed Isabella giving her a once-over, which piqued her curiosity.

"What's up, Ms. Taylor? Do I have something on my face?" Juliet asked, touching her face instinctively.

Isabella smiled. "Actually, you're not bad-looking at all. And you just graduated, so you've got that fresh, youthful vibe. Our company's clothing is for all ages. Plus, you look like you work out regularly; you seem really healthy."

Juliet blushed at the compliment.

"Ms. Taylor, you're too kind. But yeah, I do work out regularly. Staying healthy means fewer hospital bills," Juliet joked.

Isabella, however, got serious. "Remember our company is gearing up for the Olympic clothing design competition?"

Juliet nodded. "Yeah, I remember."

Isabella circled around her. "Your look and vibe are perfect for young athletes. When I finish the designs, you should model them."

Juliet's eyes widened in surprise, her face turning red.

Just as she was about to refuse, Isabella cut her off.

"Don't say no. Do you know how hard it is to find someone who fits the image? And the best part, you're doing it for free!" Isabella joked.

Juliet laughed along.

Meanwhile, the photographer started selecting and editing the photos. Once they were ready, the company printed a batch of magazines to distribute to various departments.

Employees were shocked and amazed as they flipped through the new magazines.

"Wow, this time the spokesperson is Ms. Taylor!"

"Ms. Taylor looks stunning! Our designs suit her perfectly."

"But aren't endorsements usually for famous celebrities? Will Ms. Taylor bring fame to the product?"

"Ms. Taylor's popularity is pretty high now."

Employees had mixed reactions-some were puzzled, some loved it, and some mocked. A few even secretly passed the magazine to Bianca.

In Bianca's office, the magazine was torn to shreds, pieces falling like confetti.

Bianca ripped the magazine she had just received into pieces, then angrily swept everything off her desk.

"Damn it, Isabella, you liar! You never planned to sign Estella!" Bianca screamed, her eyes red with rage.

Bianca's assistant, Daphne, stood quietly beside a potted plant, hoping to blend in.

'Please don't notice me. Please don't take your anger out on me,' Daphne silently prayed, keeping her head down.

Bianca was fuming, realizing she had fallen into Isabella's trap. Isabella never intended to sign Estella; she planned to endorse the company herself from the start. The $80 million endorsement fee was just a ploy to get Bianca to cough up $100 million.

Even though the $100 million came from John, Bianca felt sick to her stomach. It meant she had lost to Isabella again.

Just then, the office door swung open, and John walked in. Seeing the mess, his brows knitted together.

"What's going on? Getting this worked up isn't good for the baby," John said, guiding Bianca back to her chair.

The moment John entered, Bianca's expression shifted from anger to sorrow.

"My love, I'm so stupid. I got played by Isabella! She never planned to have Estella as the spokesperson," Bianca cried, clinging to John.

Daphne, hiding nearby, couldn't help but think, 'Wow, she's really good at this. She should be an actress.'

John was confused, having just returned and not knowing what was up. Then he saw the torn magazine pieces on the table, with Isabella looking powerful and elegant in various outfits.

John quickly pieced it together. "So, you found out about Isabella's endorsement fee and got tricked? And you didn't expect my grandfather to be involved."

Bianca quickly defended herself, "I wasn't trying to compete with her. I just didn't want her to get mixed up with shady celebrities."

Daphne felt nauseous, never expecting that watching someone act could be so gross.

Even John was having a hard time with it.

"Alright, enough. You don't need to explain. Let's be real. There's no rule against signing another company's spokesperson first in business competition," John said, rolling his eyes and waving at Daphne.

"Get the janitor to clean this up," John ordered.

Daphne nodded and quickly left the office. She couldn't stand being there any longer. Bianca was just too much.

Seeing through Bianca's act, John decided to cut to the chase. "You said it yourself, this is normal business competition. As long as she hasn't signed with Estella, then I have a chance. I just didn't expect her to scheme against me."

"She schemed against you, but that's part of the game. No one is to blame. We just have to win the next round," John said, patting Bianca's belly.

"Even though it cost a lot to sign Estella, we can use her influence to boost our company's visibility. Think of it as spending a billion dollars on advertising," John reassured Bianca.

###chapter 392 The Challenge Game

Even though John was talking all chill, Bianca wasn't dumb.

Sure, Bianca might not be a business whiz, but she gets that blowing a hundred million bucks for some quick buzz isn't exactly a money-making move.

"Sweetie, I feel way better after you talked to me. I shouldn't have been mad. It's not good for our baby," Bianca said, gently touching her belly and looking a bit guilty.

John ruffled her hair with a smile. "So, no more getting mad, okay? We should go for that health check-up."

Bianca suddenly remembered her monthly check-up. John was there to take her for the baby's sake.

"Let's go, honey. Our baby is gonna be just fine. I can even feel him kicking," Bianca said with a smile, leaving the office with John.

After they left, the janitor came in to clean up. Her eyes sparkled at the scattered magazines, but with the cameras watching, she didn't do anything extra. She cleaned up and left.

Not long after, Isabella and Carol got the news.

"Our plan worked perfectly. Bianca knows we tricked her. I heard she's super mad and John took her for a check-up," Carol said casually.

Isabella gave Carol a curious look. "I sometimes wonder where you get all this info. Do you have a secret network of spies or something?"

Isabella had always been curious about how Carol got dirt on shareholders and celebs, and more importantly, how she managed to plant spies in Bianca's company without getting caught.

Carol leaned against the desk with a faint smile. "Actually, these are resources left by your grandpa. I have access to some info, and those informants are hidden all over the city with their own jobs and lives. They pass me info without disrupting their lives. It's that simple."

Isabella was shocked that Carol revealed all this.

"Can I control this info network?" Isabella asked excitedly, realizing how important it was.

Carol shook her head. "Not yet. You haven't met my requirements."

"Your requirements? What are they?" Isabella asked, curious.

Carol smiled. "It's like a game. If you haven't completed the previous level, you can't unlock the next one. When you expand these three companies, I'll hand over the info network to you. It's what your grandpa wanted, like a reward for you."

Isabella immediately understood it was a test of her leadership. If she couldn't lead the company, there was no point in leading an info network.

"I won't let you, my grandpa, or our loyal family members down," Isabella said firmly.

Meanwhile, Bianca and John finished the check-up at the hospital.

Bianca held the test report, and everything was normal with the baby. John had to deal with company stuff, so he left and had the bodyguard take Bianca back.

As Bianca sat in the car heading back to the company, she passed by the street where Isabella's company was located.

After some thought, Bianca suddenly instructed the driver to head to Isabella's company.

"Ms. Taylor, Mr. Williams instructed us to take you back to the company or the vineyard," the bodyguard said somewhat hesitantly.

Bianca rolled her eyes. "Mr. Williams listens to me too. I just want to chat with my sister and catch up. If she doesn't want to see me, I'll leave. No need to worry about us arguing."

The bodyguard felt a bit bitter in his heart. They had been with Bianca for a long time, and she had never been easy to deal with. She must be going to cause trouble for Isabella.

The two bodyguards exchanged glances and decided that if there was a conflict, they must protect Bianca to prevent harm to the fetus and John from losing control.

Just as Bianca's car arrived at Isabella's building, the sharp-eyed security guard immediately informed Carol of Bianca's presence.

When Carol received the message, she informed Isabella as well.

Isabella looked at the message from the security guard, then at Carol helplessly. "Are the security guards also part of the information network?"

Carol smiled and shook her head. "They are just regular security guards, but I instructed them to enter a state of high alert once they spotted Bianca and report back to me. Of course, if you want the security guards to report directly to you, you can, since you seem to have a lot of free time."

"Who says I have free time? I'm so busy every day that my feet barely touch the ground." Isabella rolled her eyes, feeling that Carol was biased against her.

"Your feet don't touch the ground because you wear high heels," Carol retorted.

At that moment, Juliet knocked on the office door and entered.

"Ms. Taylor, something's not right. Bianca is here, but the security guard stopped her. They said many walls in the company were painted, which is not good for pregnant women and fetuses, so they temporarily kept her outside." Juliet said.

Isabella looked at Carol. "Did you arrange this too?"

Carol shook her head. "I just had the security guard stop her. The idea of painting the walls was theirs."

Isabella nodded. "Give that clever security guard a bonus of $1000."

Isabella finished speaking and went downstairs. By now, many people were outside because Bianca was shouting after being stopped by the security guard.

"Do you know who I am? I'm the CEO's sister. Can't I even see her?" Bianca yelled in anger.

The security guard remained stern and shook his head. "I'm truly sorry, Ms. Taylor. The paint inside is really not good for the fetus. We're just looking out for your health."

"Don't give me that nonsense. I just saw a pregnant woman walk in. Did Isabella tell you to say this?" Bianca shouted angrily.

"It was indeed me who told them to say that." Isabella's voice came from behind the security guard, with Juliet filming with her phone.

###chapter 393 Shutting Your Mouth

Bianca's face lit up with a hint of joy when she saw Isabella, but her brows furrowed when she noticed Juliet holding a camera.

"What's this all about, Isabella? Can't I just come over to see you?" Bianca asked, trying to look all innocent.

Isabella sneered inwardly, 'Here we go again with the innocent act. Everyone in town knows how ruthless you are. Who are you trying to fool? Is there any point in pretending?'

"Bianca, do you have any idea how much your words hurt? The media's covered what you've done to me, more than once. I wish I could just believe you now, but..." She spread her hands in a helpless gesture. "The past makes it hard."

Bianca's lips twitched as she heard people around her laughing.

"Isabella, I'm trying to fix things between us..." Bianca started, but Isabella cut her off.

"My dear sister, you always say that. But what have you done this time? Ms. Foster was supposed to be my chosen endorser, but you swooped in and offered her a hundred million dollar endorsement fee. Don't tell me that's a coincidence. I was planning to offer 80 million, but you deliberately went for a hundred million. Isn't this a direct attack on me?" Isabella said, looking all sad.

Isabella, looking distressed, covered her heart, and her distress was caught by the surrounding cameras.

A smirk played on Bianca's lips; Isabella was even better at acting than her.

Bianca opened her mouth to say something, but Isabella cut her off again.

"Bianca, you better leave now. If you keep pushing and provoke my security, who knows if you'll tell the media that it was me who had them hurt you. You know I'm too scared to provoke John. If anything happens to the baby in your belly, John will come after me relentlessly!" Isabella finished, waving to the security guards.

"Why are you all still standing here? Step back, in case you bump into Bianca and she falls down claiming you pushed her. Can you afford to provoke her?" Isabella said to the security guards.

The security guards were startled. They didn't dare to provoke John, so they collectively took a step back, distancing themselves from Bianca.

Bianca clenched her fists. That was exactly what she had been thinking. John didn't want to target Isabella now, which made Bianca somewhat dissatisfied. She needed a reason to make John continue targeting Isabella, so she could achieve her goal.

The best excuse was her unborn child. Even if she couldn't harm the fetus, she could still use it to her advantage.

However, Bianca's plan differed slightly from Isabella's. Bianca planned to fall after seeing Isabella, accusing her of pushing her.

Bianca had no interest in framing a security guard. Who knew if Isabella would push the blame onto them?

Bianca realized her plan couldn't go down now with so many eyes on her. If she got closer to Isabella and faked a fall, it would look too suspicious. Isabella had totally messed up her plans.

"Isabella, am I really such a malicious woman in your eyes?" Bianca asked, trying to sound hurt.

But Isabella didn't even bother to respond. Instead, she turned to Juliet.

"Juliet, did you get the video?" Isabella asked.

Juliet nodded, "Yep, Ms. Taylor. I filmed it and sent it to Mr. Williams just like you said."

"What are you all talking about!" Bianca tried to grab the phone, and Juliet just handed it over without a fuss.

Bianca's face darkened as she saw the video on the phone.

The video had already been sent, so grabbing the phone was pointless.

"Everyone saw she snatched the phone, not that we pushed her. If John asks, you can all back us up," Isabella said, smiling at the onlookers.

Soon, Bianca's phone rang. It was obvious John was calling.

With a grim expression, Bianca answered the call.

"Bianca, come home immediately!" John's low voice came through the phone.

Two bodyguards protecting Bianca approached.

One of them whispered to her, "Ms. Taylor, Mr. Williams seems angry. It's best to listen to him and go back."

Bianca, fuming, almost crushed Isabella's phone in her hand. She wanted to smash it, but too many people were watching.

For appearances' sake, Bianca gritted her teeth and handed the phone to the nearby bodyguard, who then passed it to Isabella.

"Isabella, you really have some tricks up your sleeve. Goodbye." Bianca gave Isabella a long, hard look, then turned to leave.

Watching Bianca's back, Isabella waved, "Goodbye, Bianca. The next time we meet will probably be in ten months or even a year."

Annoyed, Bianca got into the car and left Isabella's company.

Isabella's actions completely thwarted Bianca's plan to use the child to smear her. John, for the safety of the child, would surely be more vigilant.

It would be very difficult for Bianca to see Isabella in the future.

Isabella's plan was a success. When Bianca returned to the mansion, John hurried back and reprimanded her.

"Don't forget that the child in your belly is the most important bargaining chip in our negotiations with my grandfather. If you really want to marry me, it's best not to have any ill intentions towards the baby." After saying this coldly to Bianca, John left the mansion. This time, however, he brought two female bodyguards with him.

Annoyed, Bianca slapped her forehead. These two female bodyguards represented John's intentions. Even going to the bathroom would be accompanied by guards. This was both protection and surveillance.

"Damn you, Isabella, just wait. I will definitely kill you in the future, I swear!" Bianca fumed in her bedroom.

###chapter 394 The Goddess of Endorsements

So, according to the law of conservation of smiles, when someone's feeling down, their smile doesn't just vanish-it pops up on someone else's face.

Bianca was feeling pretty down, but Isabella? She was on cloud nine.

"Ms. Taylor, did you catch Bianca's face just now? She looked so uncomfortable!" Juliet mimicked Bianca's expression in an over-the-top way, making Isabella crack up.

"You nailed it! That was hilarious!" Isabella gave Juliet a thumbs up.

After their giggles died down, Juliet asked, "Ms. Taylor, do you think Bianca will leave us alone now?"

Isabella nodded, "She'll probably back off for a bit. She won't mess with us openly, but who knows what she might do behind our backs? We've got to stay sharp."

Isabella sighed, "Dealing with someone like Bianca, you either get rid of her completely or stay on guard all the time."

"She's such a pain," Juliet said, stomping her foot.

Isabella waved her hand, "Don't waste your energy on her. Go focus on your work."

Juliet nodded and left the office.

The company's PR team quickly posted online about Isabella being the new spokesperson, and it blew up.

"The CEO endorsing the company? That's a fresh take, but will it work?"

"I heard Bianca snagged Isabella's intended signees, so Isabella had to step in herself."

"But Isabella looks stunning in those clothes."

"If I buy from their company, will I look like a CEO too?"

"With the CEO endorsing, there's no worry about celebrity scandals. Smart move."

Isabella's endorsement spread like wildfire online.

Some people were all for it, while others had their doubts. The internet was buzzing with opinions.

Having the CEO as the spokesperson was a novel idea, catching the eye of some business folks.

Soon, advertising pros chimed in, saying this could be the next big thing. Celebrities might draw attention, but the CEO knows the products inside out.

Before long, smaller companies, who couldn't afford big-name endorsements, had their top execs step in. This move got them noticed online, and their sales shot up.

Other companies quickly jumped on the bandwagon. Isabella had started a new trend in advertising. Some even started calling her the goddess of endorsements.

"My dear goddess, can I get your autograph?" Michael hugged Isabella, grinning.

Isabella rolled her eyes and pinched his nose. "They might call me a goddess, but you don't have to. It's kinda embarrassing."

"What's embarrassing about it? My wife is gorgeous. People calling you a goddess is just stating the obvious," Michael said with a smile.

Isabella rolled her eyes and got up from the couch. "I'm not a fan of too much praise. If I fall from grace, it's gonna hurt."

"Don't worry, my goddess. I'll be your wings and help you soar. You'll never have to worry about falling," Michael said sweetly.

"I don't want to be a goddess. I just want this month to end, for you to finish those damn pills, and let me enjoy being a woman again." Isabella teased Michael, then headed back to the bedroom.

Michael smirked, "I've told you, my kidneys are fine. I'm just taking care of them!"

Isabella ignored his grumbling and snuggled into the covers.

A plane flew over Isabella's mansion, landed at the airport, and Joseph stepped off.

"After a few days abroad, I still can't relax," Joseph sighed as he left the airport.

This time, Joseph came back without telling Avery. So when Avery woke up the next morning and saw him, she was shocked.

"When did you get back? Why didn't I know?" Avery asked, surprised.

Joseph rolled his eyes, stirring his coffee. "I don't owe you an explanation. I know you've been mocking me behind my back."

Avery awkwardly scratched her nose, "As your sister, how can you think that? I've told you before, Isabella isn't right for you. She's very happy with her husband."

Joseph sat on the couch and took a sip of coffee. "I know, I've accepted it."

"That's good. Since you've accepted it, I can help you find some girls your age. They'll be attractive and have great personalities. I'll make sure none of them are annoying," Avery said, patting his shoulder proudly.

Joseph almost spilled his coffee.

He rolled his eyes, put his coffee down, and turned to Avery. "Can you help me arrange a meeting with Isabella? I want to talk to her first."

Avery's smile froze.

"You said you've accepted it, right? Are you lying to me?" Avery glared at him.

Joseph shook his head, "Before you help me find a girlfriend, I want to see her one last time. I need to hear her thoughts about me. If she's truly not interested, I'll let go."

Joseph said earnestly.

Avery rolled her eyes, "I really don't get men. If you've truly given up, you wouldn't ask me this. You're still holding onto hope."

Joseph held Avery's hand and said with a hint of pleading, "Avery, you're the best. Please."

Avery covered her forehead in exasperation. "Fine, just this once. But why don't you ask her out yourself?"

Joseph awkwardly rubbed his nose, "Isabella seems to have caught on. I've asked her out to dinner before, but she always turns me down."

Avery slapped him on the head in frustration. "That says it all, you idiot."

###chapter 395 Meeting and Confession

Avery finally caved to Joseph's request and shot a message to Isabella, setting up a meet at a coffee shop for tomorrow at noon.

[Cool, see you then.] Isabella texted back before diving back into her work.

"All set, she's coming tomorrow," Avery told Joseph.

"Awesome, thanks a ton, Avery!" Joseph shouted, leaping off the couch to give her a big hug.

"I'm gonna go figure out what to wear," Joseph said, practically sprinting upstairs.

Avery watched him disappear up the stairs and sighed. "Guys can be so clueless sometimes."

The next day at noon, Isabella showed up at the coffee shop with her bodyguard in tow.

The bodyguard stayed outside while Isabella grabbed a seat by the window. Not long after, Avery and Joseph walked in.

Isabella's eyes widened a bit when she saw Joseph, but she quickly masked her surprise.

"Hey, Avery, Joseph, good afternoon," Isabella greeted them.

"Hey there, Isabella, or should I say the endorsement queen now," Avery teased as she sat down.

Isabella cringed a little. "Please, don't call me that. It's super embarrassing."

"I think it fits you perfectly. You're stunning and graceful, just like a top model. Having you as the face of the company is a genius move," Joseph gushed.

Suddenly, Joseph winced as Avery stepped on his foot under the table.

Avery shot him a look that said it all. Years of friendship had made their silent communication flawless. Joseph got the message loud and clear.

'Shut up, you idiot! Can't you see you're making her uncomfortable?' Avery's eyes screamed.

Joseph clammed up immediately.

Isabella fiddled with her coffee cup, a telltale sign she was feeling awkward.

"Avery, you didn't just come here to call me a goddess, did you?" Isabella smiled, trying to steer the conversation elsewhere.

Avery glanced at Joseph, feeling a bit awkward. She was just the go-between; Joseph had the real reason for the meet.

"My sister's here to talk business," Joseph jumped in smoothly, breaking the tension. "With you being a CEO and her having a bunch of companies, there might be some room for collaboration."

Isabella paused, not expecting a business pitch. She thought about Avery's companies and frowned a bit.

"The three companies I run don't really overlap with yours, and I don't see any obvious opportunities for collaboration," Isabella said, puzzled.

Isabella's businesses were in fashion, food and beverage, and software development. Avery's were all about real estate, so there didn't seem to be any common ground.

Avery switched gears. "I'm thinking about starting a new company, but I'm still figuring out the details. I'm leaning towards the food and beverage industry, maybe opening a unique restaurant. I'd love to get your take on it."

Isabella thought for a moment. Right now, her focus was on fashion, food and beverage, and cosmetics. The two companies she inherited from Jasper were barely staying afloat. Despite some financial backing, they were just breaking even, no profits in sight.

Isabella planned to fully develop her fashion business before using the profits to expand the other two companies.

"Sorry, Avery. It's not that I don't want to help, but my food and beverage business isn't exactly booming. I don't have much experience in that area," Isabella said with a rueful smile.

Avery nodded, brushing it off. "No worries, I get that your focus isn't on food and beverage right now. I just wanted to throw it out there. Maybe we can team up in the future when you're ready."

As Avery finished talking, she felt something nudge her foot. Looking down, she realized it was Joseph's foot.

Catching her eye, Joseph gave her a subtle look that said it was time for her to leave - he wanted to talk to Isabella alone.

"Isabella, why don't you stay and chat with Joseph?" Avery rolled her eyes. "I need to hit the restroom."

With that, she got up and walked away.

After Avery left, Joseph let out a sigh of relief, but Isabella felt a bit uneasy.

Isabella wasn't naive; if Avery really wanted to discuss business, she wouldn't have brought Joseph along.

"Isabella, there's something I need to tell you," Joseph said earnestly.

Isabella looked at Joseph quietly. Since she couldn't avoid it, she decided to be straightforward.

She reached into her bag and pulled out a ring.

Not the one Mason gave her, but the pink diamond ring from Michael.

Because this ring was so precious, Isabella rarely wore it, saving it for special occasions and public events.

When Joseph saw Isabella put the ring on her finger, he seemed to understand, but the words he wanted to say got stuck in his throat.

"Joseph, are you saying you like me?" Isabella asked calmly.

Joseph felt like his heart was being squeezed, it was really uncomfortable.

"If I say yes, would you believe me?" Joseph asked with a pained smile.

Isabella nodded. "I believe you. Look into my eyes, I've seen it before."

Joseph was taken aback for a moment but then got a bit hopeful. "Where did you see it?"

Joseph thought Isabella was talking about when they first met.

But what Isabella said next made Joseph feel a chill.

"I saw it in my husband's eyes. Every time he looked at me, it was the same way you look at me, but his love was stronger," Isabella said calmly.

Joseph's hands trembled as he struggled to speak. "You know what? I've had feelings for you since we were kids. Finding out about your engagement to John while I was away... it crushed me."

###chapter 396 Refusal

Joseph finally spilled the beans about his crush on Isabella.

He'd been keeping this secret locked up for way too long. Sometimes, he wondered if it was all just a figment of his imagination.

His dad shipped him off abroad when he was just a kid, so he missed out on getting close to Isabella. When he heard she was getting engaged to John, he drowned his sorrows on the side of the road.

At first, Joseph had zero plans to come back home because he couldn't stand the thought of seeing Isabella and John tie the knot. But then he got wind that Isabella wanted to call off the wedding.

Joseph was over the moon when he heard the news. He literally jumped up and did a couple of backflips. But when he found out she called it off because she was already married, he crashed back down to earth.

In that moment, it felt like his whole world went dark. But then rumors started flying that Isabella's so-called husband was a no-show, and people began to think she made up the marriage just to ditch John. Turns out, she wasn't married at all.

With a mix of hope and doubt, Joseph hopped on a plane back home. Married or not, he was dead set on going after his love. He figured his charm could win her over.

But boy, was he wrong.

Joseph totally underestimated the bond between Isabella and Michael.

"I don't get why you're so upset. If I hurt you, I'm sorry, but I don't see what I did wrong," Isabella said with a calm shrug.

"Do I really have no shot?" Joseph suddenly grabbed her hand, his eyes pleading.

Isabella frowned and tried to pull her hand away, but Joseph's grip was firm. She tried a couple more times but couldn't break free.

She sighed, "Can you let go? I only see you as a friend. I've never felt that way about you."

Joseph's lips quivered as he searched her eyes for any sign she was lying, but all he saw was calm sincerity.

Taking a deep breath, he slowly let go of her hand. "I'm sorry, I got carried away."

Isabella shook her head, rubbing her wrist. "It's okay. Emotions can make us do crazy things. We can't be a couple, but we can still be friends."

Joseph shook his head. "I can't just be your friend, not with how I feel about you. Maybe things will change someday, for you or for me. But if your marriage ever falls apart... just know I'll be here, waiting like a fool for my chance."

A flicker of annoyance crossed Isabella's face at his words, feeling like he was jinxing her marriage to Michael.

"Alright, Joseph, your sister's been in the bathroom forever. You should go check on her. I've got stuff to do at the office," Isabella said, getting up and leaving the coffee shop.

Joseph sat there quietly for a long time.

Until a hand landed on his shoulder, and Avery sat down next to him.

"My poor little brother, have you given up now?" Avery asked.

Joseph glanced at Avery, then got up and walked out of the coffee shop without a word.

Avery watched him leave and sighed. "I shouldn't have agreed to this. Now he's all upset, and Isabella's probably mad too. She might even be pissed at me. I need to explain things to her, or our friendship's toast."

Avery sighed again and started dialing Isabella's number to apologize.

Isabella, already in her car, saw Avery's call. She hesitated for a moment before picking up.

"Hey, Isabella. I'm really sorry. As his sister, I had to look out for Joseph's feelings. But please believe me, I didn't encourage him to go after you or mess with your marriage. He just wanted some closure, so I helped set up the meeting," Avery explained.

Isabella chuckled. "I believe you. It's just that my charm is too irresistible, making your brother fall head over heels. It's a shame I met my husband first. If Joseph had come along earlier, who knows what might've happened."

Avery gave a wry smile and shook her head. "It's all fate, something Joseph can't fight. Anyway, I'll apologize in person next time we meet. And don't worry, he won't be tagging along."

After expressing her regret, Avery hung up.

Isabella looked at her phone and sighed softly. She had been a bit annoyed with Avery, but the quick call to explain things made her forgive her friend.

Just like Avery said, being a sister sometimes means making tough calls.

Isabella glanced out the window and spotted a familiar figure.

"Bianca? Am I seeing things?" Isabella muttered, watching the figure disappear down the street.

Little did Isabella know, Bianca had already set her sights on causing more trouble for her.

In fact, Bianca was just out shopping to blow off some steam. But when she glanced through the mall window, she saw the drama unfold at the coffee shop.

Bianca put away her phone, which now held a video of Joseph holding Isabella's hand.

"Isabella, aren't you supposed to be a role model? I want everyone to see a married woman like you getting cozy with another guy, betraying your marriage, your husband, and your love. Let's see how long your endorsements last when everyone despises you," Bianca sneered.

Bianca also noticed Avery in the video and knew there was more to the story. But that didn't matter.

All Bianca needed to do was edit the video, post it online, and let the internet do the rest.

After filming, Bianca left the mall and headed to the coffee shop.

Standing at the door, she called her two bodyguards to go inside and get the surveillance footage.

"This time, you won't have a chance to explain," Bianca said coldly.

###chapter 397 Online Public Opinion

As Isabella was about to head out from work, she heard the rapid clacking of high heels echoing down the hallway.

She frowned and glanced at the office door. Before long, there was a loud, urgent knock.

"Come in," Isabella called out, and Carol burst in.

"Ms. Taylor, do you know you've been exposed? Were you meeting a guy at a café today?" Carol blurted out as soon as she stepped in.

Isabella was caught off guard. "Are you talking about Joseph?"

Carol paused, then snapped, "You actually went on a date with a guy? Do you realize this is all over the internet? It's going to seriously affect our products."

Isabella's brow furrowed as she quickly pulled out her phone to check the news. Soon enough, she found a video making the rounds online.

In the clip, Joseph was holding Isabella's hand, and it looked like they were talking, but there was no sound.

The video was short, showing Joseph holding Isabella's hand and then letting go, but it was clear to everyone that there was a loving look in his eyes.

Given Isabella's popularity, the comments below the video were numerous.

Many were shocked, accusing Isabella of having an affair.

Some made snide remarks, suggesting that once people had money, they engaged in extramarital affairs regardless of gender.

Others were stunned that the man in the video was Joseph.

Some recognized Joseph as a well-known heir of one of the four major families, leading to wild speculation about the relationships between John, Joseph, and Isabella.

"Look at the way he's holding your hand. Oh my, you didn't really cheat, did you?" Carol asked nervously.

Isabella shook her head. "How could I betray my husband? This is clearly someone targeting me. I wasn't alone with Joseph; we were with his sister Avery."

"Then why was Joseph holding your hand?" Carol asked.

Isabella shrugged. "He wanted to confess to me, but I turned him down."

Carol smirked. "Wow, you really are something. You even managed to catch the eye of the second heir of one of the four major families."

Isabella spread her hands helplessly. "There's no point in mocking me now. They must have the full video, probably with Avery in it, but they haven't released it. They're clearly targeting me."

"Who could it be?" Carol asked.

Isabella furrowed her brow, thinking hard, and suddenly remembered seeing someone who looked like Bianca that day.

"It might be Bianca. I think I saw her that day, but Avery called me over, so it must have been a chance encounter." Isabella sighed, feeling like she was cursed. It seemed like the universe didn't want her to have an easy time.

Carol furrowed her brow. "We should send someone to that café now; maybe we can find some surveillance footage to clear your name."

Isabella shook her head. "It's too late. Bianca's not dumb; she probably already got her hands on the footage."

Carol rubbed her temples in frustration. "So what's our next move? The public needs an explanation. And Joseph - what was that hand-holding about? Was he swatting a fly or something?" She let out an exasperated sigh. "The way he looked at you... it was like he wanted to eat you alive."

Isabella was stumped. "I guess I can call Joseph and ask him to clear things up. But he might not agree, considering I turned him down."

"Well, it's worth a shot. Hurry up and call him. I want to hear what he has to say," Carol urged.

Isabella pulled out her phone and dialed Joseph's number, but it just kept ringing.

"What's going on? Why isn't he picking up?" Isabella frowned and double-checked the number.

"Maybe he's upset because you rejected him and blocked your number? Try calling from my phone," Carol suggested, handing her phone to Isabella.

Isabella took Carol's phone, dialed Joseph's number again, but still no answer.

"Maybe he's drunk and can't hear his phone. People do that when they're emotionally wrecked," Carol said, sounding a bit defeated.

"Forget it, I'll call Avery and see if she can help," Isabella sighed and dialed Avery.

Avery picked up quickly.

"What's up, Isabella? What's going on?" Avery asked, sounding curious.

Isabella quickly filled her in on the situation.

"I'm sorry, Isabella, my brother might really be drunk. When I called him, he didn't answer, and the last time I reached him, he seemed to be at a bar," Avery explained with a wry smile.

Feeling frustrated, Isabella scratched her head. "Can you help me release a statement to prove I didn't cheat?"

Avery nodded. "Sure, I'll do that now, but will the public believe it?"

"Doing something is better than nothing," Isabella sighed and hung up.

After hanging up, Avery turned to Joseph, who was sitting silently.

"What are you doing? Isabella's in trouble because of you, do you get that?" Avery glared at him angrily.

In reality, Joseph hadn't gone to a bar; he had been at home the whole time. Avery had lied again, and it made her feel a bit guilty.

"Do you think this misunderstanding might cause a rift between Isabella and her husband, giving me a chance?" Joseph's eyes flashed with a hint of madness as he looked at Avery expectantly.

Avery's response was a slap across his face.

###chapter 398 Emotional Lunatic

Avery smacked Joseph right across the face.

Joseph, clutching his cheek, stared at Avery in shock.

"You're acting crazy! I'm not gonna help you wreck someone's marriage. Anyone who does that deserves to burn in hell," Avery snapped before storming off.

Joseph slumped onto the couch, still holding his face, silent. After a while, he let out a long, slow sigh.

Even though Avery posted proof on social media that she was at the café that day, people still swarmed her account, asking why her brother was holding Isabella's hand with such a loving look in his eyes.

Avery had no clue how to respond to all the questions.

After all, Joseph was the face of the family. It was super embarrassing for the heir to be chasing after someone else's wife and getting turned down.

"What am I supposed to say? Should I tell them Joseph is practicing for an acting gig with Isabella?" Avery muttered, scratching her head in frustration. The idea was ridiculous.

Avery's post didn't do much to help. Instead, it just reignited the whole conversation.

She sent someone to the café, but as Isabella had predicted, Bianca had already taken all the surveillance footage.

The café owner couldn't say no to Bianca.

Meanwhile, Michael had heard the rumors about Isabella's supposed infidelity.

But Michael didn't buy it. He quickly figured out it was all Joseph's doing.

Michael immediately called Jerry.

"Find out where Joseph is right now and let me know," Michael said calmly.

Jerry, who answered the phone, shivered. He knew Michael well, and the calmer he sounded, the angrier he was. Michael was like a volcano about to blow. Jerry knew Joseph was in deep trouble.

Bianca, scrolling through the online comments, felt pretty pleased with herself. Most of the comments were trashing Isabella. It was clear that if Isabella couldn't come up with evidence, the products she endorsed would definitely take a hit.

"Keep trashing her, the nastier the better! Isabella's got no proof now; she's just waiting for Joseph to speak up. But as the heir of a big family, he can't let this disgrace slide. Isabella, let's see how you compete with me now," Bianca said with a cold smile.

Meanwhile, Isabella had finished work and headed home.

She expected Michael to start questioning her as soon as she walked in, but to her surprise, he was busy making dinner.

"Hey babe, welcome back. How do you like the pan-seared cod? I tried some new seasonings this time, and I think it turned out pretty good," Michael said gently.

Isabella walked up to him, smiling. "Honey, don't you have any questions for me?" she asked.

Michael paused, then shook his head with a smile. "Nope, why would I? Is there something I should be asking?"

Isabella leaned against the kitchen counter, eyeing Michael. "Shouldn't you ask why some guy was holding my hand today? Don't tell me you missed the news."

Michael looked at her and smiled. "I saw it. But so what? I trust you. I know it's just a misunderstanding."

Isabella suddenly hugged him, her voice full of gratitude. "You're amazing. Thank you for trusting me."

Michael picked up a piece of fish and fed it to her. "Go wash your hands and let's eat. I'm starving."

He brought the food to the table, and Isabella, still chewing the fish, quickly washed her hands.

She looked at the lavish spread and grinned. "Be honest, darling. Are you thinking: 'My wife is so popular, I need to be on my best behavior. I can't afford to argue with her - that would only push her into my rival's arms. I should play the role of the gentle, caring husband. That way, she'll feel guilty and love me even more.'"

"If the movie company doesn't hire you as a screenwriter, it's their loss," Michael said, rolling his eyes.

Isabella pouted. "Really? Are you becoming cunning just for me?"

Michael didn't want to argue and nodded, rolling his eyes again. "Okay, dear. You're right. I'm a cunning man using my schemes to win back your love."

"I knew it, you sly man," Isabella joked, pinching his nose.

Michael swatted her hand away. "Stop pinching my nose, I'll turn into Pinocchio."

"Even if you were a puppet, I'd still love you," Isabella said, smiling.

Michael smirked. "If I were really Pinocchio, I'm afraid you'd ride on my face," he said, looking at her.

"Why?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

Michael's smile turned mischievous. "Because Pinocchio's nose would keep growing and shrinking with lies and truths."

Isabella tilted her head, quickly catching on. Her face turned red instantly.

"You're always thinking dirty," she said, annoyed, picking up a spoon and lightly tapping him on the head.

Michael rubbed his forehead, waving his hand with a smile. "Alright, dear, I was just joking. Let's talk about the company. How did that thing you were dealing with go?"

Isabella put down the spoon, looking a bit helpless. "Avery testified for me, but it didn't help much because she couldn't explain why Joseph was holding my hand. As the heir, they wouldn't want such a shameful incident publicized."

"So Joseph is keeping quiet now, right?" Michael asked calmly.

"Yeah, how could he possibly clarify this to the media?" Isabella nodded helplessly, a piece of meat skewered on her fork, but she had lost her appetite.

At that moment, Michael's phone lit up with a message from Jerry, revealing Joseph's location.

"Honey, wait for me at home. I need to handle something," Michael said with a smile before leaving the mansion.

###chapter 399 Beating Up the Love Rival

Joseph was slumped over the bar, drowning his sorrows and knocking back drinks like there was no tomorrow.

"Should I clear things up or not? If I do, Isabella won't have to deal with all the gossip, but my reputation can't take that kind of hit. What the hell should I do?" Joseph mumbled, staring into his glass.

The glass wasn't giving him any answers, but the bartender had a few thoughts.

"Mr. Davis, I don't know what's eating at you, but drinking like this isn't doing you any favors," the bartender said, trying to be helpful.

"Yeah, you're right. I'll stop," Joseph replied, tossing some cash on the bar before stumbling out.

He got into his car, feeling like crap and hoping a drive might clear his head.

Joseph was a familiar face at the bar, and the staff knew him well.

"Joseph, you've had too much. It's not safe to drive. Hand over your keys, and I'll get you home," one of the staff members suggested, walking up to him.

Irritated, Joseph shoved the guy away. "Who do you think you are, telling me what to do? I'm not drunk, I'm fine," he snapped, then got into his car.

The staff member just stood there, speechless.

'Drinking and driving, seriously? You'll only learn the hard way. Just don't crash near our bar!' the staff member thought, heading back inside.

Joseph drove with the window down, hoping the cold air would snap him out of it.

Out of nowhere, blinding lights made him squint, followed by a deafening crash.

A car slammed into Joseph's, sending it skidding off the road and flipping it over.

The car that hit him was a black SUV, barely scratched.

The crash jolted Joseph awake. His head was clear, but he was trapped in his seat.

Fighting through the pain and panic, Joseph managed to unbuckle himself and crawl out through the window.

A figure stepped out of the black SUV.

Michael walked over to Joseph.

As Joseph's upper body emerged from the window, Michael grabbed his collar and yanked him out.

When Joseph finally stood up and saw who it was, he was shocked.

"Are you Isabella's husband?" Joseph asked, but before he could finish, Michael's fist connected with his face.

Michael's punch sent Joseph sprawling. "You think you're smart, trying to mess with my marriage? We trust each other completely. Your little games won't work."

Michael then kicked Joseph hard.

The kick landed square on Joseph's chest, and he felt a sharp pain in his ribs, probably broken.

"If you and your wife are so solid, why are you hitting me?" Joseph sneered.

With a cold, emotionless look, Michael grabbed Joseph by the hair and slammed his face into the car door. "I'm hitting you because you've caused my wife so much trouble! She's getting trashed online, and even the company's products are taking a hit. Do you have any idea how much this company means to her?"

Joseph's face was a mess of blood and bruises, but Michael wasn't finished.

"You think your Davis Family is untouchable? Reputation is just garbage! Even without you, I can find other witnesses to clear my wife's name! This beating is a warning. Show your face near my wife again, and you won't be able to handle the consequences. Your family won't mean a damn thing to me." With that, Michael got back into his car and sped off.

Leaning against his overturned car, Joseph wiped the blood from his face and watched the SUV disappear.

He sighed and called someone to come get him.

After dealing with Joseph, Michael headed to a flower shop and picked up a bouquet.

He cleaned the blood off his hands with a wet wipe, took a deep breath, and put on a calm, gentle face as he went to see Isabella with the flowers.

"Did you get me flowers? Oh, darling, you're so sweet," Isabella said, taking the bouquet and giving Michael a kiss on the cheek.

"I noticed you were feeling down, so I thought these might cheer you up," Michael said, smiling as he saw the kitchen had been tidied up, probably by Isabella.

"I was just about to take a bath. These roses will be perfect in the tub!" Isabella winked at Michael and carried the flowers into the bathroom.

As soon as Isabella was in the bathroom, Michael's phone buzzed. It was a call from Jerry.

"What's up, Jerry? Got any news?" Michael asked.

Besides having Jerry track Joseph, Michael had him find other witnesses from the coffee shop.

Jerry sounded excited. "Yes, Mr. Williams. We found a regular customer who recognized Isabella and took some photos. We even got some video footage. Should we post it online?"

"Do it right away, and make sure that witness is ready," Michael said calmly.

Jerry agreed and hung up.

Neither Michael nor Jerry cared about what happened to Joseph. It wasn't their problem.

Everyone had to face the consequences of their actions.

Meanwhile, Joseph was in the hospital, his wounds bandaged, but his team couldn't dig up any info on Michael.

"Mr. Davis, we really can't find anything. The SUV's license plate was fake; there's no trace of the vehicle," Joseph's subordinate said, frustrated.

###chapter 400 Online Evidence

Isabella's husband has always been a mystery to the four major families. Despite all their efforts, they couldn't dig up any info. So, how on earth did Joseph manage to find out?

Joseph waved off his subordinates, signaling them to leave.

Not long after they left, the sound of high heels clicking echoed down the hospital corridor.

Joseph raised an eyebrow. He knew that sound-it was his sister, Avery.

"Joseph, are you okay?" Avery rushed over when she saw him sitting there, looking all anxious.

"Are you seriously hurt?" Avery asked, checking him over with a worried look.

"I'm fine, Avery, just a few scratches. Don't worry," Joseph reassured her.

Seeing that Joseph wasn't seriously hurt, Avery let out a sigh of relief. But then she got mad. "I heard you got drunk and crashed your car. How stupid can you be? Ever heard of a designated driver?"

Avery glared at him. If he didn't look so pitiful with those bandages, she might've smacked him.

Joseph gave her a bitter smile and shook his head. "Stop yelling at me, Avery. These injuries aren't from a car accident. I got beat up."

Avery's eyes went wide. "Beat up? Who did this? Did you piss someone off?"

Joseph looked at her, feeling a bit helpless. Did she think he was always causing trouble?

"My dear sister, don't always assume it's my fault. Yeah, I was drinking, but I wasn't driving like a maniac. Check the intersection cameras if you don't believe me! I was deliberately hit!" Joseph explained, rolling his eyes.

"Who hit you? Who's got the guts to mess with our family? Tell me, I'll make them pay," Avery fumed. Someone had clearly targeted Joseph.

Joseph hesitated for a moment before saying, "It seems to be Isabella's husband."

Avery's face went stiff. "Are you sure?" she asked slowly.

Joseph nodded. "Yeah, it was him."

"I don't believe Isabella would have him do this. She wouldn't," Avery said, reaching for her phone to call Isabella.

"Enough, Avery. I don't think Isabella planned this. It was probably her husband's idea after seeing the news," Joseph sighed.

Avery, still angry, asked, "So we're just gonna let this slide? You messed up, but they almost killed you. That's insane!"

Joseph shook his head. "Enough, Avery. Ever since that video came out, we've all been targets. That guy's probably waiting for us to turn on each other. I need to help clear Isabella's name."

Avery looked at Joseph, realizing he had grown up a bit.

"Are you sure? You might end up being the laughingstock of the whole city," Avery said, looking him in the eyes.

Joseph nodded. "I've thought it through. My recklessness caused a lot of trouble for Isabella. That endorsement deal is crucial for her; she can't lose it."

He pulled out his phone, ready to post a message on social media. But his face went stiff as he opened it.

"What's wrong? Weren't you going to post something? Why'd you stop?" Avery asked, confused.

Joseph put down his phone and gave a bitter smile. "I don't need to make a statement. Isabella's already found evidence."

Avery was surprised. She took out her phone to check and found a new video trending.

The video seemed to have been filmed from the moment Avery, Joseph, and Isabella met up.

From the angle, it looked like it was shot with a hidden camera.

After a bit, the video switched to a man's face, presumably the one filming.

"Hey guys, look who I found! It's our hottest endorsement goddess, here with friends for coffee. Should I ask her for an autograph?" the filmer said excitedly.

Just as the filmer was about to approach Isabella, Avery left her seat, leaving the spot for Isabella and Joseph.

"Wait a minute, guys. The vibe here seems a bit off. I see a familiar look in this guy's eyes. It looks like love," the filmer whispered in surprise, then continued to film sneakily.

The video clearly showed Joseph's confession, pursuit, and struggle with Isabella.

But Isabella stayed calm and clearly rejected Joseph's confession.

The video ended with a freeze-frame of Joseph's sad expression.

"Guys, I never expected to capture this. I get the guy's feelings; I've been rejected before, and it sucks," the filmer sighed emotionally to the screen.

The filming ended there, as Joseph and Avery had already left the café.

The internet buzzed with this video.

Those who had insulted Isabella for an alleged affair came out to apologize. The more rational netizens knew how to admit their mistakes.

Some netizens, even knowing they were wrong, chose not to apologize but pretended not to see it.

Isabella's supporters celebrated like they had won a battle.

"Isabella is loyal to love; she has never betrayed it. Listen to how she rejected that guy! 'The love in my husband's eyes is even more intense than yours!' Oh my, it's so touching!"

"The love in my husband's eyes is even more intense than yours." This phrase quickly became a trending topic.

But soon, someone noticed something strange in the filmer's video.

Someone enlarged the video and saw a familiar figure reflected on the glass of the opposite mall.

They enhanced the figure and revealed it was Bianca, holding a phone and filming.

###chapter 401 Win-Win Cooperation

Bianca's latest stunt set the internet on fire with mockery.

"If anyone's gunning for Isabella, it's gotta be her sister."

"Here we go again, and of course, it's Bianca. Not even shocked."

"Bianca's tricks are so obvious. Whenever something goes down with Isabella, you can bet she's the one pulling the strings!"

"Bianca's got three hobbies: existing, dating John, and making her sister's life hell."

People online are mad, but they also find it hilarious because Bianca's always mixed up in Isabella's drama.

Whether it's stealing designs, getting tangled up in the kidnapping of Isabella's parents, or fighting over company shares, Bianca seems hell-bent on making Isabella's life miserable.

Some folks even turned Isabella and Bianca into cartoon characters with a scoreboard in the middle. It reads 4:0, meaning Bianca's lost four times.

Not everyone agrees with the score, thinking there's some secret competition between the sisters. But they all agree Bianca's losing.

"Damn bastards! I'll kill everyone who trashes me online! These disgusting bugs, I'll kill them all!" Bianca screamed, throwing everything on the table to the floor.

Veins bulged at the corners of her bloodshot eyes, and her face turned from red to purple with rage.

Two female bodyguards outside the office heard the ruckus and rushed in. Seeing the mess and Bianca's fury, one of them pulled out her phone.

"Stop! Don't call John. That'll just piss me off more. I'll handle my own emotions," Bianca snapped, stopping the bodyguard.

If she made that call, John would rush over, and then she'd be locked up again. She might even get banned from the internet.

Bianca had convinced John to let her have some personal space-like the bedroom and the office-where the bodyguards didn't have to shadow her every move.

This was the biggest concession John had made, as Bianca had let him down time and time again.

The two bodyguards exchanged glances and nodded. Bianca sat down, massaging her forehead, taking deep breaths, and slowly calming down.

Seeing her relax, the bodyguards left the office.

Bianca lay back in her chair, staring at the ceiling. "I never expected there'd be a spy. If I'd known, I would've checked the surveillance footage first."

She felt a pang of regret; she'd made some mistakes.

Suddenly, an idea hit her, and her eyes lit up.

"How foolish of me," Bianca muttered, her eyes brightening with realization. "I can't take on Isabella alone - I need allies. And Joseph would be perfect." She remembered she'd need to track down his contact info first.

Bianca hit up some old friends to track down Joseph's number. It didn't take long before she got a reply.

She looked at the number and dialed it right away, ready with her pitch.

Joseph had just left the hospital and was about to head home when his phone rang.

Sitting in the back seat, he signaled the driver to start driving and glanced at the unfamiliar number. Curious, he answered.

"Hello, who is this?" Joseph asked.

Bianca smiled slightly. "Joseph, you might've heard of me. I'm Bianca."

As soon as she said her name, Joseph hung up.

Bianca's smile vanished. She stared at the screen in disbelief, then her face twisted with anger.

"Damn Joseph, how dare he hang up on me. He'll never win Isabella's approval!" she fumed.

She was so mad she almost threw her phone, but she knew the noise would bring the guards running, and if John showed up, things would get even worse.

Bianca took a deep breath and called Joseph again.

Seeing the same number, Joseph frowned. He regretted not blocking it earlier.

After a moment's hesitation, he answered. "Bianca, I have nothing to say to you. Why are you calling?"

Bianca's voice turned icy. "I know you like Isabella. I can help you get her."

Joseph laughed. "You help me? With your 4:0 track record?"

Bianca nearly crushed her phone. She could feel the sarcasm dripping from his words.

"Enough, Joseph. You know my status. I understand Isabella better than you do! With my help, you can easily get rid of her husband and win her heart," she said confidently.

Joseph was silent for a moment. "Honestly, if I can't have her, I'd rather let go. At least I can still be friends with her. But if I team up with you, she might hate me."

Bianca sneered. "Do you really think you can still be friends with her now? If you wanted to be her friend, why didn't you stand up for her when she was falsely accused?"

Joseph rubbed his forehead, a look of regret on his face. "That was my bad. After we left the café yesterday, I ended up drinking too much, and by the time I sobered up, it was too late to sort things out. Anyway, let's not dwell on that. What's your plan to help me?"

Hearing that Joseph seemed interested, Bianca's face lit up. "You need to fix your image in her eyes. I'll set up a situation where Isabella needs saving, and you can swoop in like a hero. If you get a little hurt in the process, even better. She'll forgive you, and you'll have more to bond over."

###chapter 402 Betrayed

Bianca kept chatting away on the phone, laying out her plan.

Joseph's face was dripping with sarcasm.

Wasn't this just another 'hero saves the damsel' story? Total cliché, right out of every movie and TV show when a guy's trying to win over a girl.

Bianca went on for a solid ten minutes, detailing how to deal with Isabella's bodyguards, when Joseph should make his move, and even suggesting he might want to fake some injuries for effect.

"You know, you should really consider being a screenwriter. You'd be great at it," Joseph said, sounding sincere.

"No way! That job's so boring! Those poor writers have no say, they just do whatever the money people tell them to. All their dreams get crushed by cash. Anyway, since you're in, let's figure out when to pull this off," Bianca said, all smug.

But Joseph wasn't having it.

"Nope, I'm out. I don't want to mess with Isabella anymore. She's happy with her husband. I'm not gonna keep wrecking their marriage; that's just cruel," Joseph said, calm as ever.

Bianca was baffled, "Don't you like Isabella? Why are you bailing now? Do guys give up on girls that easily?"

Joseph teased, "If John heard that, he'd be pretty bummed."

Bianca sneered, "You think I'm dumb enough to let him find out? And by the way, when I say guys, I don't mean John."

Joseph said casually, "Now that you mention it, I'm curious about John's reaction. Maybe I'll let him hear our call. See if he's the kind of guy you think he is."

Bianca froze for a second, then jumped up, shouting, "What did you say? You recorded our call? What are you up to?"

Joseph laughed like he'd just thought of the funniest joke, his body shaking. "I just had a prank idea. You wanted to get closer to Isabella with this hero act, but I've got a better plan."

Bianca didn't want to hear about this "better plan"; it definitely involved her.

Joseph ignored her silence and grinned, "If I give this recording to Isabella or post it online, we'd have a common enemy. That could really improve our relationship. At least we could be friends. And all you have to do is make a little sacrifice."

Joseph's words made Bianca shake with rage.

"You jerk! What's wrong with you? What's so special about Isabella that you'd help her like this?" Bianca screamed.

Joseph said coolly, "Because Isabella's my friend, and I can't stand women like you. Plus, I hate being told what to do. You're not worth it."

With that, Joseph hung up.

Bianca lost it. She threw her phone to the ground, smashing it to pieces.

She kept screaming in the office, her voice echoing down the hallway.

The office door flew open, and two female bodyguards rushed in. They relaxed a bit when they saw Bianca wasn't in any immediate danger. One of them quickly called John.

"Mr. Williams, you need to come here. Ms. Taylor is really upset," one of the bodyguards said into the phone, then exchanged a look with her partner and moved closer to Bianca.

"Ms. Taylor, please calm down. It's not good for the baby," one of the bodyguards said, trying to stay calm.

"Get out! I don't need you telling me what to do," Bianca snapped, glaring at her.

The bodyguard didn't flinch. She just put the phone on speaker. John's voice came through loud and clear.

"Bianca, have you had enough? Go with the bodyguards to the hospital for a check-up. I'm on my way," John said before hanging up.

Bianca's face went pale. She knew John must be furious and disappointed. The days ahead weren't looking too good for her.

Meanwhile, Joseph looked at the recorded audio file on his phone, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"Should I send this to Isabella, or just post it online?" Joseph mused, tilting his head. After a moment, he decided to post it online.

He wasn't sure if Isabella had blocked him, and he didn't want to risk the message not getting through.

Actually, Isabella hadn't blocked Joseph. They had some history, and because of Avery, Isabella didn't want things to get too messy.

Joseph posted the recording of his call with Bianca on his social media, adding a caption: [Not everyone is cut out to work with me.]

He wasn't concerned about ticking off Bianca or John. His family might not hold as much power as John's, but they didn't need to meddle in every little thing. Young people should handle their own problems.

As soon as Joseph posted the recording, it blew up online. The drama was still hot news.

"Bianca just can't stay out of trouble. First a scandal, now plotting against Isabella?"

"Why does Bianca hate Isabella so much? She's pregnant with John's kid and has a high status. What's her beef with Isabella?"

"There must be some bad blood between them. Isabella must've done something to piss Bianca off."

The internet was buzzing with arguments. The news even reached the Olympic Committee.

###chapter 403 The Irritated Man

John had a big meeting today with a VIP client.

Garry Britton, a top dog at the Olympic Committee, was the guy John needed to talk to about a potential partnership.

John, being the savvy businessman he is, knew the Olympics were a goldmine for exposure and ad revenue.

"Mr. Britton, I want to talk to you about my girlfriend's designs for the Olympic uniforms. I really hope you can help us out. The designers she's collaborating with are top-notch and can truly make our athletes stand out at the opening ceremony," John said, his confidence shining through.

There's no such thing as true fairness in this world. John has status, power, and influence-so why should he compete on equal footing with anyone else?

Only the weak beg for fairness because it's their only shot. The strong don't need to, and it would be dumb if they did.

Garry was toying with an antique John had gifted him, something from the 19th century.

It was obvious Garry was into it.

Just as Garry was about to agree, someone walked in and whispered something to him.

Garry's face changed, and he looked at John with a hint of annoyance.

John had a bad feeling, sensing that whatever was coming next involved him.

"I get it, you can leave now," Garry waved off his subordinate.

Turning to John, Garry said, "Mr. Williams, we're good friends. Normally, I'd help out a friend. But this time, it's tricky."

Garry put the antique on the table, signaling John to take it back.

John glanced at it but didn't pick it up. Instead, he smiled and asked, "Mr. Britton, since we're friends, you should tell me what made you misunderstand me."

Garry sighed, shook his head, and said, "Mr. Williams, if you have time, you should go and talk to your girlfriend."

John frowned. He knew Garry was talking about Bianca.

Feeling uneasy, John pulled out his phone and searched for news about Bianca. He found out she had been caught taking unauthorized photos.

John's face darkened.

The Olympics are a huge deal, and everyone involved needs to uphold a positive image. The company designing the athletes' outfits can't afford any scandals. Bianca's actions were like giving their competitors a loaded gun. The Olympic Committee would definitely take this seriously.

Forcing a smile, John said, "Mr. Britton, those photos only show my girlfriend using her phone in the building across the street. They don't prove she was taking unauthorized photos."

John felt more and more embarrassed, lying to cover for Bianca, convinced she was behind the whole mess.

Garry looked John straight in the eye and said, "Mr. Williams, this isn't a joke. The public will ultimately decide how to handle this. If I stick with your girlfriend's designs, it could cost me my job."

Garry's tone made it clear that Bianca's designs were out of the running for the Olympics.

John's face grew darker. The only solution he could think of was to get the PR team to handle the Bianca situation fast. Maybe then they could save face and get her designs back in the game.

Just then, John's phone rang. It was his female bodyguard.

Worried about Bianca, John answered immediately.

After hearing what the bodyguard had to say, John's expression turned even grimmer.

"Bianca, get to the hospital right now. I'll be there soon," John said before hanging up.

As soon as he did, Garry's subordinate walked in again.

The subordinate was about to whisper something to Garry, but Garry, knowing it was about John, told him to speak up.

"Joseph Davis, the heir of the Davis Family, just posted a phone call recording on social media. It's a conversation between him and Bianca. In it, Bianca conspires with Joseph to sabotage Isabella, trying to get her to divorce and marry him instead. But..." Before the subordinate could finish, John cut him off.

"That's enough. I get it," John said, standing up and looking at Garry.

"I'm really sorry, Mr. Britton. Because of my girlfriend's stupidity, I no longer want her involved in this design competition," John said, pointing to the artifact on the table.

"This artifact was a gift to a friend. You keep it. We still have other business to discuss," John said, then turned and walked out of Garry's office.

Garry shrugged, waved for his subordinate to escort John out, then carefully picked up the artifact, examining it.

John was right. Despite Bianca's foolishness, John himself wasn't tainted by it, and there was still potential for them to work together.

"A successful man shouldn't have a foolish woman dragging him down," Garry sighed.

Meanwhile, at Bianca's company, the designers who had been excited about their Olympic designs were furious after seeing the reports about Bianca on social media.

"Damn it, we didn't sign up for this embarrassment!"

"The company's facing a scandal right after starting! Will our designs even sell now?"

"We never should've taken John's offer. Now it's all ruined."

"Bianca clearly isn't cut out for business. I'm quitting, what about you?"

"Count me in, I'm out too. No point sticking around here."

The designers collectively handed in their resignations and walked out of Bianca's company.

###chapter 404 Happy Isabella

The designers bailed on Bianca's company. They were brought in by Bianca, using John's name. They weren't too worried about pissing off John, figuring they'd land on their feet somewhere else.

Meanwhile, after her hospital check-up, Bianca found out her baby was fine despite her stress. She felt a bit better, but then the dread set in, knowing John would be furious. And boy, was he mad. When he saw Bianca, his face was like a thundercloud.

"Sweetheart, I'm sorry. I just lose it every time I see Isabella," Bianca said, looking down, sounding really sorry.

John's voice was icy. "Starting tomorrow, no phone or smart devices for you. The radiation isn't good for the baby. Grab some books if you're bored, but don't cause me any more trouble."

John was barely keeping his cool, trying not to blow up right then and there.

Tears filled Bianca's eyes as she looked up at him. "I know I messed up. I'll take the company's stuff seriously from now on, and I won't go against Isabella again."

John waved her off. "No need to say more. Your company's done. Because of what you did, the Olympic Committee rejected all your entries. Even my other Olympic-related businesses are affected. It's gonna cost a lot to fix."

Bianca was shocked. She hadn't realized how bad things had gotten.

"I'm so sorry, honey. I didn't think it would get this bad. I didn't think it through," Bianca said, holding John's hand, her voice full of regret.

"Please don't let my company go under. I really want to do something for you," she pleaded, looking at John.

John's grip on her was tightening, and she couldn't afford to lose her last bit of leverage against Isabella.

John looked at her coldly, and just then, Daphne burst into the hospital room.

"Mr. Williams, this is the resignation report from the design department," Daphne said, holding a stack of papers, looking a bit awkward. She wanted to hand them to John but hesitated.

Bianca glared at Daphne. "Can't you see we're in the middle of something? If the design department wants to quit, let them."

Daphne smirked and reluctantly handed the papers to John. "It's a collective resignation. They're really disappointed with Ms. Taylor."

"What? Are they nuts?" Bianca snatched the papers and looked through them, confirming the whole design team had quit.

Bianca shook with anger.

John shot a disappointed glance at Bianca before handing the documents back to Daphne. "Let those designers know that if they stick around, I'll give them a 50% raise. And Bianca, you're off the hook from all your duties starting today."

Daphne nodded and quickly left the room, sensing the tension and not wanting to stick around.

Bianca sat on the hospital bed, feeling utterly defeated.

"I don't get it. You have everything you need and a higher status. Why do you keep going after Isabella? Am I not enough for you?" John asked, his voice full of frustration.

Bianca closed her eyes, tears streaming down her face.

"You don't get it. You're the only heir, always the favorite of your grandfather. But I've never felt that way. My grandpa only has eyes for Isabella. She's always been the star, and I've been stuck in her shadow. We're both family, so why does she get all the love?" Bianca's eyes were red as she stared at John.

"So this is all about jealousy? You're jealous she's more popular?" John sighed deeply.

Bianca stood up, glaring at John. "Shouldn't I be angry? We love each other, but your grandpa wants you to marry Isabella! Has he ever thought about our feelings? Why does my grandpa favor Isabella over me? And why does your grandfather prefer her too?"

Bianca shouted, grabbing John's clothes and shaking him.

John fell silent. "I'm sorry. If I had told my grandfather earlier, maybe he wouldn't have arranged the engagement with Isabella."

"As the heir, there are things you can't just do because you want to." Bianca wiped her tears, a bitter smile on her face.

"I don't see any point in living. Maybe I'm just here to get back at Isabella." Bianca sneered, shrugged, and walked out of the room.

John stood quietly, facing the door, and sighed after a long time.

Meanwhile, Isabella was working in her office when Carol burst in.

"Isabella, come with me. Stop what you're doing. I need to introduce you to some people." Carol urgently pulled Isabella from her desk and headed to the meeting room downstairs.

"What's going on? Why the rush?" Isabella asked, her heels clicking on the floor as she was pulled along.

In the elevator, Carol said excitedly, "Bianca's company is going under. The Olympic Committee canceled their participation because of a scandal."

"And?" Isabella asked, confused. The news was satisfying, but she didn't see how it related to her.

Carol grinned. "The designers from Bianca's company have resigned, and they're here to apply for jobs."

###chapter 405 Similar Cases

Isabella's eyes widened when she heard what Carol had to say.

John had shelled out a ton of cash to hire top-notch designers for Bianca.

But now, thanks to Bianca's mess, those designers would be in hot water if they stuck around.

Fashion designers crave recognition. For them, having their work celebrated worldwide is the ultimate prize.

But Bianca had wrecked it all.

Some designers got scooped up by the other big three families, while others went straight to Isabella, hoping she'd get where they were coming from as a fellow designer.

And they were right. Isabella was in dire need of designers. She'd been running the company for a while, but all the big names had been snatched away, leaving her with just the rookies.

It's not that the newbies weren't talented, but they still needed to polish their skills. Given time, they could become world-famous designers. But Isabella didn't have that luxury.

A lot of Isabella's work involved designing clothes and promo materials as a part-time gig in the design department.

With so many designers flocking to her, Isabella wasn't about to let them down.

"Thanks so much for trusting me, everyone. Given the company's situation, I can only offer you the same pay Bianca did for now. But I promise, once we're back on our feet, your salaries will definitely increase," Isabella assured them.

The designers knew Isabella's company was struggling. John's salaries were already above average, but Isabella still wanted to match them. They felt her sincerity and decided to stick around and give it a shot.

With these designers on board, Isabella could finally catch her breath.

"Finally, a moment to chill. Sometimes I feel more like a busy gardener than a CEO," Isabella said, stretching.

Carol grinned and slid two documents in front of Isabella. "Since the design department is sorted, I'll leave the catering and medical aesthetics industries to you."

Isabella's relaxed look vanished. "Who's the CEO here, you or me? Can't I get one easy day? Just an hour?"

Isabella shot Carol a resentful look.

Carol shrugged and rolled her eyes. "This is your family's company, not mine. If I could find someone else to handle things, I wouldn't need your help."

Isabella sighed. Talent is always the rarest commodity, no matter the time.

Just then, Isabella's phone rang.

"Looks like you've got business to handle. I'll head out," Carol said with a smile and left the office.

Isabella glanced at the caller ID. It was Brenda.

Isabella racked her brain and realized there hadn't been any recent criminal cases. The only thing she was involved in was Bianca's peeping incident, but that was minor and didn't need Brenda's attention.

Isabella picked up the call and asked, "What's up, Officer Pena?"

Brenda chuckled on the other end. "Hey, just wanted to give you a heads-up-your dad's all set to be discharged from the hospital. They're getting him ready to transfer to prison. Thought you'd want to know."

Isabella was taken aback, suddenly realizing she hadn't visited Jasper in the hospital for ages. Since he was brought back from abroad, she'd only gone once to talk about shares.

After she got all the shares, she never went back.

Now she remembered it had been a while since Jasper returned.

"Hopefully, my dad can figure out his mistakes in prison. By the way, what about my mom?" Isabella suddenly thought of Mia, the woman who reported her husband.

"You really don't keep tabs on your parents, do you?" Brenda teased.

"Your mom's a witness now, plus with your bail, she's volunteering at an orphanage. She wasn't great at it at first, but she's getting the hang of it. At least she doesn't call us every day to complain about the kids anymore," Brenda said, sounding a bit nostalgic.

Isabella smiled and was about to say something when she heard an airport announcement in the background.

"Sounds like you're at the airport. Chasing down a criminal?" Isabella asked curiously.

Brenda shook her head, "Nah, a criminal got caught in Avalonia, and we have an extradition treaty with them. I'm heading there to bring him back. The guy's a scam artist who ripped off a bunch of elderly folks. He'll probably get at least 40 years. By the time he's out, he'll be old himself."

Isabella said indifferently, "I have zero sympathy for those guys, but I do feel bad you have to work overtime again."

"Technically, it's a business trip. But it's cool, I get to check out the local police station, see how they handle things, maybe learn something new, and see if there are any interesting cases. Gotta use my eyes to find something exciting," Brenda joked, clearly in good spirits.

"Alright, thanks for the heads-up. I've got work to do. Good luck on your trip," Isabella said, smiling before hanging up.

On the other side, Brenda was about to board her flight. After the journey, she finally landed in Avalonia.

The local police gave Brenda a warm welcome and even invited her to exchange case information.

They showed her some of their solved cases, and one, in particular, caught her eye.

It was about a sadistic serial killer who tortured young women. The victims were dismembered, their eyes gouged out, and tongues cut off.

This case reminded Brenda of Pearl.

###chapter 406 Received News

Pearl's case is still a mystery. Brenda and her team always knew there were some deep, dark secrets behind it.

Brenda's been dying to find out who the killer is, but her uncle Alan, the chief, has always warned her to back off.

She suspects the killer is from one of the big four families, but dealing with them is no walk in the park. Plus, all the info on Pearl's case is locked up tight in the archives.

Then, out of the blue, Brenda stumbles upon a similar case in another country. If the person who hurt Pearl isn't the same as this killer, they must be connected somehow.

"Sir, can I meet this killer and ask him some questions?" Brenda asks the local police chief.

The chief looks at the killer's file, shrugs, and says, "Sorry, Officer Pena, this guy died in prison from a sudden heart attack."

Brenda is floored; she didn't see that coming.

But she's still got questions.

"So, sir, when did this criminal die?" Brenda asks.

The chief thinks for a moment. The criminal's brutal methods made him memorable. "Hold on, I think I kept a newspaper about this guy."

After digging through a bunch of papers, the chief finally finds the newspaper reporting the criminal's death.

He hands it to Brenda. She checks the date of death and realizes that Pearl was harmed shortly after this criminal died.

Brenda has a wild theory. 'Maybe this criminal didn't die at all but was sent to our country.'

"Sir, can I see the death report of this criminal?" Brenda asks again.

The chief frowns. "Officer Pena, why are you so interested in this criminal?"

Brenda hesitates, then explains the similar case they had back home.

The chief's eyes flicker. He shakes his head and says, "Sorry, Officer Pena, our archives were renovated, and some info got lost. We didn't pay much attention to this guy's data because he was already dead, so we didn't bother to submit the report. I can't help you."

Brenda wants to ask more, but the chief waves her off and makes an excuse to leave.

'This guy definitely knows something, but if he's not talking, what can I do? I have no jurisdiction here.' Brenda thinks to herself.

She looks at the newspaper in her hand, which has a photo of the criminal. Brenda quickly goes to her computer, logs into her social account, and emails the photo to her colleague.

"Emma, can you look into this guy for me? I need to know if he's shown up domestically ASAP," Brenda calls her colleague to stress the urgency.

"Don't worry, Brenda, I'll dig into it," Emma Kate assures her.

After hanging up, Brenda started asking other officers about the killer, hoping to dig up more clues.

Meanwhile, Emma got right to work on the investigation after receiving Brenda's email.

It was lunchtime, and a colleague came by to invite Emma to join them.

Emma's stomach growled. She hadn't eaten breakfast and had been busy all morning. She was starving and feeling a bit lightheaded.

"Emma, let's go eat! They've got meat pies today, and they're really good," a colleague said with a smile.

Emma glanced at her computer and hesitated. "Okay, but I need to finish Brenda's task first."

She stretched, left her desk, and headed to the cafeteria. In her hunger-induced haze, she forgot to close the document on her computer.

A passing officer noticed the open report on Emma's screen. The details of the murders were eerily similar to Pearl's case. The officer's eyes widened, and he quickly left the station.

Soon, word spread through the station that Brenda might have found Pearl's attacker.

The police chief and Brenda's uncle, Alan, immediately called her.

In Avalonia, Brenda got Alan's call before she had any solid info.

"You promised me you'd stop investigating this. Why are you still digging?" Alan demanded over the phone.

Brenda winced at the yelling. She rubbed her ear and replied, a bit annoyed, "I'm not trying to investigate, but the clues are falling into my lap. What am I supposed to do?"

"Regardless, you need to back off. Now that the news is out, the four major families know. Especially Paxton. He might be waiting for you at the airport to interrogate you. Don't come back yet. Stay there; I'll arrange it as a learning exchange," Alan said, hanging up before Brenda could argue.

Brenda stared at her phone, frustrated. "Is this a joke? Now I can't even go home? Emma, how could you be so careless?"

She felt a wave of frustration; she was caught between two police chiefs.

Back at the Avalonia police station, the officers seemed to have been briefed by the chief and were tight-lipped around Brenda.

As Alan predicted, the four major families, especially Paxton, were already in the loop.

"When is Officer Brenda coming back?" Paxton asked Jonah, his face dark.

Jonah shook his head. "According to the station, Brenda will be staying there for a few months to learn their advanced crime-solving techniques. But I think she's worried about the danger waiting for her here."

Paxton sneered, "It doesn't matter. Now that we know who the killer is, I just need to find out who hired him."

###chapter 407 Unlucky Illegal Emigration people

Paxton wasted no time and had Jonah send someone to dig into the leaders behind the illegal emigration racket. He couldn't wrap his head around the idea that a killer could just waltz into the country pretending to be a regular Joe.

Jonah and his crew hit the streets right away, and let's just say their investigation methods were a bit more... unconventional than the cops'.

Meanwhile, other families were getting wind of the same news.

Mason squinted at Charles and asked, "You sure it's this guy, Marshall Banks?"

"Yeah, we uncovered some news from Avalonia, and the victims' stories line up with Pearl's. We even consulted some forensic experts, and the wounds the cops released look like they're all from the same guy," Charles said, his tone dead serious.

Mason got up from the couch, leaning on his cane. "How does a guy locked up in prison end up here? Who's got the pull for that?"

Charles had a hunch but didn't dare voice it.

Avalonia was Michael's turf. With his clout, springing someone from prison wouldn't be a big deal.

"I know what you're thinking. I suspect Michael too," Mason said, like he'd just put the pieces together.

After a pause, Charles asked, "Should we bring Mr. Williams in for a chat?"

Mason shook his head. "No need. He's probably already got the message and knows what to do."

Mason then cracked a smile. "If this is his doing, he played us all. Shifting the blame to the big four families is a slick move."

Mason kept quiet, figuring Michael had already gotten the police's message.

"Mr. Williams, the info about the murderer you found is out. What's our next move?" Jerry asked, all business.

Michael stayed cool. He wasn't rattled; he hadn't used illegal emigration to get the killer in, but another way.

"Get in touch with Estella and have her reach out to Zoey. Tell them I'm interested in teaming up," Michael said, a sly smile playing on his lips.

Jerry got the drift right away. "Got it, Mr. Williams. I'll handle it," he said, hanging up and getting to work.

Michael pocketed his phone and stepped out onto the balcony. The weather was grim, with strong winds whipping around.

Standing there, he listened to the wind howl when a snowflake landed on his forehead.

Michael reached out, catching the swirling snowflakes. "The weather's getting colder, and the Brown Family should be going under about now. Consider this my anniversary gift to my wife."

A smile crept across Michael's face, but his eyes were as cold as the ice and snow.

On a freezing winter night, a nasty storm was brewing.

Francis Vasquez was sprinting through the snow, blood dripping from his wounds and staining the white ground a vivid red.

A group of gunmen was hot on his heels, aiming for his legs and arms. They didn't want him dead-just captured.

That was the only reason Francis was still alive.

But then he slipped and hit the ground hard. The gunmen pounced, pinning him down and tying up his hands and feet.

"You psychos, I swear I don't know the guy you're after! He didn't use my channels!" Francis yelled, but the gunmen weren't buying it.

"We don't believe you. We'll make you talk," one of them sneered, dragging him into a van.

The van sped off and stopped at a warehouse.

Inside, the place was divided into sections, and you could hear screams of pain echoing from behind the doors.

"I swear, I don't know who this guy is, please don't hurt me."

"Paxton, you bastard, if I get out of this, I'll take you and your whole family down!"

"You maniacs, you won't get away with this!"

The gunmen hauled Francis out of the van and into the warehouse.

The air was thick with the smell of blood. Francis was shaking, his face ghostly pale.

A man, looking half-dead and covered in blood, was dragged out of one of the compartments. His body was a mess of whip marks and branding burns.

"Royce, did he spill?" one of the gunmen asked the guy dragging the body.

Royce Castillo, with his spiky hair, spat on the ground. "This guy's clean. I whipped him for three minutes, doused him with pepper water, and he still didn't crack. He's telling the truth."

Francis shivered even more.

"You lunatics! Is this the only way you know to get the truth?" he screamed.

One of the gunmen slapped him hard. "You illegal emigration folks aren't saints, and we're not the cops. We don't need to play by the rules."

They dragged Francis into a compartment.

He glanced at the torture devices, his legs almost giving out from fear.

Sharp iron hooks, still bloody, looked like they were meant for hanging meat. He didn't want to think about their last use.

There were whips with barbs, red-hot branding irons, and even an electric chair.

"Let's see which one to use on you," the gunman said, eyeing the tools before settling on the electric chair.

They strapped Francis into the chair, binding his hands and feet.

"Trust me, this'll be a real shocker," the gunman grinned wickedly.

"Wait! I'll tell you everything! I know who this guy is!" Francis screamed, terrified.

###chapter 408 Unlucky Joe

Francis's terrified scream pissed off the gunmen. They didn't just drag people here for the truth; they got a kick out of torturing them too.

"Hold up, if I remember right, you just started this illegal emigration gig, didn't you? How the hell do you know this guy? You trying to pull one over on me?" The gunman eyed Francis suspiciously.

'You know I just started this, and you still nabbed me. You guys are total psychos,' Francis thought, but he kept a friendly look on his face.

"Sir, yeah, I just got into the illegal emigration game. After Joe disbanded the gang, I got my old crew back together to take over his business." No sooner had Francis finished talking than he got a punch to the gut.

The gunman glared at him, cursing, "You piece of crap, rot in hell! You think I'm an idiot? Joe only showed up after Ms. Brown got hurt - you really think you can pin this on him?"

Francis felt a sharp pain in his stomach, like he was about to puke up his breakfast. He shook his head frantically. "Please, believe me. Even though Joe didn't bring Marshall into the country, he got the old boss's diary when he took over. It listed everyone he helped with illegal emigration. Marshall's name was in there, and I've seen it."

The gunmen paused, considering what Francis said.

Francis used to be in Joe's gang, but when Joe disbanded it to dodge John's pursuit, Francis, being ambitious, reassembled his crew and took over Joe's business.

Tears streaming down his face, Francis pleaded with the gunmen, "I swear I'm telling the truth. Just find that diary. It has all the contact info for everyone involved in illegal emigration. Once you get your hands on it, you'll know who brought that murderer into the country."

The gunmen's faces turned serious. If Francis was telling the truth, they couldn't keep torturing him; they had to find Joe.

"I hope you're not lying, or I'll make you wish for hell," one gunman sneered before heading off to report to Paxton's butler, Jonah.

They let Francis out of the electric chair.

'Phew, they bought it. I'm safe for now. Sorry, Joe. Stay hidden and don't let these guys find you, so we both stay safe,' Francis thought. In reality, there was no diary; he made it up to save his skin.

When Paxton heard about the diary, he immediately ordered a search for Joe.

Meanwhile, Joe was hiding out in Mike's apartment, dodging John's pursuit.

With Jasper back in his own country, John had more of his anger to vent on Jasper. He was less pissed about Joe's past actions, and the hunt for Joe started to die down.

Joe was lounging on the sofa, playing video games. He'd beaten the game a bunch of times already, but he still couldn't leave the apartment.

"Mike, can I get out of here already? Damn, it's been ages since I chatted up those gorgeous women! I hope they haven't moved on to other guys while I've been stuck here." Joe shot Mike a resentful look.

Mike rolled his eyes. "What's the rush? John's guys haven't come sniffing around for a week. If they don't show up by the end of today, you're probably in the clear for now. I'll get you out of the country ASAP. You can party all you want once you're abroad."

Joe put down the game controller, clearly annoyed. "I like it here. The women are more passionate and wild."

Mike gave Joe a cold stare.

Joe met his gaze but eventually threw up his hands in surrender.

"Alright, Mike, I'll do what you say. I'll leave the country." Joe flopped back onto the sofa, defeated.

Mike was about to smile when his phone rang.

"What? Paxton's looking for Joe? Got it." Mike hung up.

Joe sat up straight when he heard his name.

"Did you just say my name? What's going on? Why is Paxton looking for me?" Joe asked, confused.

Mike shrugged and patted Joe's shoulder as he walked over to the sofa. "Looks like you'll be staying here a bit longer, Joe."

"Wait, explain what's happening. Why is Paxton after me?" Joe stood up, staring at Mike.

Mike sighed. "Remember Paxton's daughter, Pearl? And that psycho killer?"

Joe nodded. Only Michael, Jerry, Mike, Joe, and Tim knew the truth about that.

"The truth about the killer's out, and Paxton's desperate to find who brought the killer back, hoping to trace Mr. Williams through them," Mike explained.

Joe immediately shouted, "Is Paxton an idiot? When his daughter got hurt, I wasn't even running the illegal emigration gig."

Joe was fuming, feeling unjustly targeted.

Mike looked at Joe sympathetically. "Do you have a guy named Francis working for you?"

Joe furrowed his brow, trying to remember. He vaguely recalled a subordinate by that name.

When Joe was about to become the new gang leader, Francis had been a pain, mouthing off, and Joe had given him a harsh reprimand.

"After you disbanded the gang, Francis took over and now Paxton's after him too. But he mentioned you have the old leader's diary with all the contact info for the illegal emigration folks," Mike explained.

"Francis, you damn bastard! I swear, I want to shove your foul mouth up your own ass," Joe shouted angrily.

###chapter 409 Joe Accused

Mike stood there, arms crossed, just watching Joe curse up a storm. He wasn't too worried about anyone hearing; the soundproofing in his place was top-notch.

When Joe finally ran out of steam, Mike handed him a glass of water.

Joe took a sip, calming his throat and stopping the cursing.

"Why'd you stop? I was kinda enjoying the show. Ten minutes and not a single repeat. I gotta say, I'm impressed," Mike teased, still with his arms crossed.

Joe waved him off. "Right now, I just wanna put a bullet in that bastard. Where is he?"

Mike tilted his head, thinking. "Francis is probably under Paxton's watch. Taking him out won't be a walk in the park. But I'm more curious, do you really have that diary?"

Joe's anger flared up again at the mention of the diary.

"Zane had a diary, but it didn't have any customer info. What was he doing, gathering evidence for the cops? It was just a list of all the women he slept with, their breast sizes, how round their butts were, who knew the most positions, and whose husband was never home," Joe ranted.

Mike's eyes widened as Joe went on for over 20 minutes.

When Joe finally stopped, Mike asked with a weird look, "Did you read the whole thing?"

Joe nodded, looking smug, and took another sip of water. "Why do you think I was in such a hurry to leave? I wanted to see if what was in that diary was true!"

Mike rolled his eyes. "You're risking your neck for women. Paxton's gone nuts. Do you know how many illegal immigrants he's killed?"

Joe shook his head. "A lot? I know at least a dozen from the groups I know."

Mike smirked. "There won't be any more smuggling or illegal immigration in this city for the next decade."

Joe's eyes widened in horror. "All those immigrants are dead? Paxton's really lost it! I need to lay low again."

Joe flopped onto the couch, grabbing a game controller. He was gearing up for a long hideout.

Mike chuckled at Joe's scared expression. Despite his tough talk, Joe was a real coward at heart.

Mike quickly called Michael to update him on Joe's situation.

"Mr. Williams, I've confirmed with Joe that the diary thing was all made up by Francis. He probably cracked under Paxton's beating and lied," Mike explained.

Michael nodded. "Keep Joe safe."

Mike reassured him, "Don't worry, Mr. Williams. Joe's been reminded of what it's like to be under John's thumb and he's behaving."

Michael nodded, told Mike to keep an eye on Joe, and then hung up.

"Jerry should be in action by now. Hopefully, he'll infiltrate Paxton's crew quickly and take over the whole Brown Family," Michael muttered, tapping his fingers on the table.

Meanwhile, Paxton got a call from Zoey.

"What did you say? Michael wants to meet? To talk about working together?" Paxton's voice was excited; this was what he'd been waiting for.

But after hanging up, doubt flickered in Paxton's eyes.

Just then, Jonah came in with an update. Paxton stopped him and asked, "I need to ask you something. I've had Zoey trying to get Michael to open up foreign markets, but he never agreed. Why would he suddenly want to work together now, while I'm investigating the killer?"

Jonah thought for a moment, then shook his head. "Mr. Brown, maybe you're overthinking it? Mrs. Brown and Estella have been getting along better, maybe Estella finally convinced Michael. As for the timing, it could just be a coincidence."

Paxton considered Jonah's words and thought they made sense. Maybe it was just a coincidence.

He waved Jonah off and went to change clothes. He had to look sharp for this meeting.

News of Paxton looking for Joe eventually reached John's ears.

John was helping Bianca cut some fruit and casually waved his hand. "If Paxton wants to find Joe, let him. Pull our guys back. That lunatic Paxton is way more ruthless than me."

A cold smile crossed John's lips as he dismissed his subordinate.

Bianca looked at John curiously. "Honey, what's going on? Why does Paxton want to find Joe?"

Being closely monitored by John, Bianca had no clue what was happening outside.

John filled her in about Paxton's hunt for the killer.

Bianca was shocked. She had no idea things were so intense outside.

"This has nothing to do with us. Just focus on taking care of yourself and the baby. I've got some things to handle at the company," John said, kissing her forehead before leaving.

As John walked outside the winery, he saw security carrying boxes towards the house.

"What's in those boxes?" John asked, puzzled.

The security guy explained, "These are baby products Ms. Taylor ordered, along with some books."

John nodded, not thinking much of it, and got into his car, driving away.

As the security team brought the boxes inside, Bianca started unpacking them.

Suddenly, she paused. In one of the books, she found a hidden compartment with a cellphone.

###chapter 410 Mysterious Phone Call

Bianca snapped the book shut as soon as she spotted the phone inside, shooting a nervous glance at the two female bodyguards. Luckily, they didn't notice a thing.

Feigning a stretch with the book in hand, Bianca casually strolled towards the bedroom.

The bodyguards barely gave her a second look. The bedroom was her and John's private space, strictly off-limits to them.

Once inside with the door securely closed, Bianca quickly retrieved the phone from the book's hidden compartment and powered it on. She didn't buy for a second that the bookstore owner had gifted her a phone out of kindness; someone else had to be behind it.

Instead of diving into the contacts, Bianca went straight to the photo gallery.

There was a single video. As she watched it, her eyes softened immediately.

The video was surveillance footage of a middle-aged woman watching TV. That woman was Bianca's missing mother.

Tears welled up in Bianca's eyes as she saw her mom on the screen. Suddenly, the phone vibrated, and she answered it right away.

"It's been a while. How've you been?" a man's voice came through.

Resentment flashed in Bianca's eyes. This was the guy who had driven her dad to suicide and was holding her mom hostage to manipulate her.

"I don't want to chit-chat. Just tell me, why'd you send the phone?" Bianca's voice was cold.

The man on the other end sighed. "Don't be so mad. I just wanted your dad to record a video, make it look like an escape, but he ended up killing himself. I underestimated his love for you and your mom."

Bianca's fists clenched, her tone icy. "You hypocrite, talking about understanding emotions?"

The man chuckled. "Looks like John's got you on lockdown, even took your phone. I went through a lot of trouble to get this to you, and you don't even thank me. Do you know how hard it is to fool John?"

Bianca's eyes narrowed. Not many people knew about her restrictions, so this guy had to have a spy close to her.

She fell silent, trying to figure out who the mole could be.

"Why so quiet? Trying to guess who my inside man is?" the annoying man laughed again, mocking her.

If it weren't for the guards outside, Bianca would've cursed and smashed the phone.

Sensing her thoughts, the man said calmly, "This is your last chance. Lose this phone, and you lose the chance to see your mom."

Bianca felt a sharp pain in her abdomen, the stress affecting her unborn baby.

She took a deep breath to calm down. "Why'd you reach out now? What do you want from me?" she asked.

The man dropped the jokes. "I need you to go after Isabella. Take control of those three companies ASAP," he said bluntly.

Bianca scoffed. "Are you even listening to yourself? I'm on lockdown, can't leave the house. How am I supposed to take over those companies?"

"Use someone else, like Paxton," the man suggested.

Bianca frowned. "Why Paxton? Wait, are you saying I should use the killer Paxton's investigating? The one who hurt Pearl-was that you?"

Anger surged through Bianca. If it hadn't been for that sudden urge to be with John at the hotel last time, that car bomb would've killed her.

The man denied it. "I've done a lot of bad things, but not that. Think about it, I don't play those torture games; I'm not a psychopath!"

Bianca paused, considering his words. Maybe he was telling the truth; he had no reason to lie about this.

"Do you want to frame Isabella for this? How exactly?" Bianca asked, trying to stay calm.

The man sounded surprised. "Isn't framing people your thing? Why ask me?"

"Everyone thinks I'm an idiot. I'm tired of thinking, and this pregnancy is making me dizzy. Just tell me your plan," Bianca said impatiently.

Every plan she made against Isabella had failed, so she preferred others to come up with solutions.

The man stopped mocking and laid out his plan. "I can have my people plant some evidence for Paxton to find, but we'll need John's help."

Bianca sneered. "So you do have a spy close to him."

"Now's not the time to argue. John doesn't want to get involved, so you have to push him. Tell him about the bomb incident; he'll have to agree for your sake and the baby's. Then my people can plant the evidence," the man said calmly.

Bianca took a deep breath and nodded. "Got it. I'll tell him. But why are you getting involved now? You've never let your people get involved in my fight with Isabella before."

Bianca wasn't stupid; she sensed the man was more anxious this time.

"Don't ask questions that don't concern you. Just follow my instructions, and your mother will be safe," the man said before hanging up.

Bianca stared at the ended call screen, took a deep breath, hid the phone, and walked out.

"Call John and tell him to come back. I have something important to discuss," Bianca instructed the bodyguard at the door.

###chapter 411 A Slap

Bianca gave John a call back.

John was in the car, almost at the office when his female bodyguard called.

"I've got stuff to handle. If it's not urgent, tell Bianca to wait at home," John said, sounding annoyed.

With the Olympics coming up, his company had a ton of important projects with the Olympic Committee. He loved Bianca, but he couldn't put all his energy into her right now.

The female bodyguard didn't give much detail, just said Bianca needed to talk to him.

Bianca, who was nearby, couldn't wait any longer. She thought the bodyguard was taking too long.

"Can't you see how urgent this is from my face?" Bianca snapped, grabbing the phone from the bodyguard. It took a lot of guts for her to make this call.

"Darling, come back quick. I have something super important to tell you, and it's about that car explosion we had last time," Bianca said to John.

John's brows knitted together. He still hadn't gotten any solid info on the car explosion. All he knew was those three guys never came out after going into a community.

Rumors among the big families suggested Michael might be behind it, trying to take John out and become the family heir.

But a lot of people doubted it because John's dad, Owen, was still capable of having kids. After John's mom passed away, Owen never remarried, but he could still have another kid to keep the family line going.

In short, John was important, but not irreplaceable.

John rubbed his temples, feeling annoyed. "Alright, I'm coming back now. I hope you have a good explanation," he said.

After hanging up, John told the driver to turn around and head back.

Bianca walked over to the sofa and sat down, her fingers twisting together, showing how nervous she was.

'Forget it, this is gonna come out sooner or later. My reputation can't get any worse. Everyone already thinks I'm a bad person, so no point in pretending,' Bianca thought.

John told the driver to hurry up and got to the winery as fast as possible.

As soon as the car stopped, John jumped out and headed inside.

He saw Bianca sitting on the sofa and frowned. "Didn't you have something to tell me? What's going on? Do you know anything about the explosion last time?" he asked, clearly annoyed.

Bianca looked up at John, her eyes a bit shifty. She hesitated, then finally spilled the truth.

"I think Paxton was behind the explosion last time," Bianca said, looking at John.

"Paxton? No way. Is he nuts? Why would he bomb me?" John stared at Bianca, not believing her because Paxton had no reason to do that.

Bianca shook her head. "Actually, Paxton wasn't trying to kill you; he was after me. He thinks I had something to do with what happened to his daughter."

"You? How could that be? You were in the hospital at the time. There's no way you could've done it," John said, eyes wide with shock.

Bianca looked down and said quietly, "The kidnapping of Isabella was planned by Pearl and me. We didn't expect Pearl to get hurt while I stayed safe. Paxton probably thought it was unfair and wanted revenge."

John stared at her, disbelief all over his face.

Bianca kept her head down, avoiding his gaze.

John's body shook slightly. He took a deep breath, his eyes bloodshot as he asked, "Is what you're saying true? Answer me."

After a moment of silence, Bianca finally nodded.

John slapped her hard across the face, angrier than he'd ever been.

Bianca covered her face, looking at John in shock. He rarely hit her.

With bloodshot eyes, John jabbed a finger at her and demanded, "You said all of this was because Jasper and Mia pressured you, but now you're claiming you conspired with Pearl? How can you be so heartless? You didn't just want Isabella's kidney; you wanted her life too!"

Bianca covered her face. Having revealed everything, there was no point in hiding anymore.

"Yes, it was me. I wanted Isabella dead! Do you still love her? If you do, avenge her now." Bianca tilted her head back, a hint of madness in her voice.

John trembled with anger, unable to speak for a while as he pointed at her.

After a long pause, John sighed deeply.

He sat down on the sofa, his expression heavy.

"So you told me this today because you were worried Paxton wouldn't find the real culprit and would come after you again, right?" John looked up, asking indifferently.

Bianca nodded. "That's what I was thinking."

John rubbed his temples wearily and lay back on the sofa.

Seeing John's exhausted appearance, Bianca realized he had been working tirelessly for her and his company. He must have been under a lot of pressure.

Feeling guilty, Bianca walked over to John, hugged him, and cried, "I'm sorry, darling. It's all my fault for being too weak to tell you about this."

John didn't push her away but sighed deeply. "At least you've told me now. I don't have to worry about being blown up on the street."

John rubbed his temples wearily and then took out his phone.

"Immediately investigate Paxton's whereabouts. Also, look into the recent activities of the Brown Family's subordinates and Joe's whereabouts." After instructing his subordinates, John suddenly remembered someone.

John called Mike and asked him to help find Joe as well.

###chapter 412 The Eccentric Family

After getting John's message, Mike didn't put up a fight. John had dirt on him, so Mike had no choice but to go along with it.

After hanging up, Mike let out a sigh and glanced over at Joe, who was lounging on the couch, munching on snacks and playing video games. Then he dialed Michael's number.

Meanwhile, Michael was at the office, listening to Jerry give an update on their latest projects.

Jerry stood beside Michael, clutching a notebook filled with the latest updates. "Our company just landed deals with Avalonia and a few local athletes to showcase our ads on their uniforms. We also managed to secure some ad space from the Olympic Committee, but it's not as much as what John got due to some territory issues," Jerry explained.

Jerry then pulled out a small notebook from his pocket, flipped to a page, and said, "Estella managed to work out a partnership with Zoey. They're going to use our channels to help Paxton sell products from their family business."

Michael listened to Jerry's report with a calm, unreadable expression. When Jerry finished, Michael shook his head.

"This is still too slow," Michael said flatly.

Jerry chuckled, "Mr. Williams, you gotta give us some time. Our people aren't superheroes; perfect infiltration takes time."

"That's why I said it's too slow. Have Paxton's guys found anything?" Michael asked.

Jerry shook his head, "Joe destroyed a lot of stuff before he left. They can't find Joe or that so-called diary."

"Sometimes you don't need to find it, just need some false accusations. Just like what we did to Bianca." Michael stretched and got up from his chair.

Jerry paused for a moment, then quickly caught on to what Michael meant.

Following Michael to the balcony, Jerry asked, "So, are you worried someone might fake a diary to mess with Mrs. Williams?"

Michael nodded. "It's possible, right? Paxton's guys are all shady, easy to bribe and infiltrate. If we can get info about the diary, so can other families. A crazy dad is an easy tool to manipulate."

Jerry, standing behind Michael, looked concerned. "If that's the case, we need to find a way to turn the tables. If we have to, we can just take out Paxton, that mad dog."

Michael smiled, "Paxton's still useful to us. At least until we completely take over his family, he can't go down."

Just then, Michael's phone rang. Jerry walked over to the table, curious, picked up the phone, and handed it to Michael.

During this, Jerry saw the name "Mike" on the screen.

Michael answered the call, "What's up, Mike? Why the sudden call?"

Mike said into the phone, "Mr. Williams, John just called me and asked me to help him track down Joe."

Michael frowned. "Did he say why?"

Mike shook his head. "No, Mr. Williams, John didn't give any details. He had eased up on looking for Joe, but now he's suddenly all over it again. Feels like there's something we're missing."

Michael quickly pieced it together.

"Bianca probably spilled the beans to John about what she did and that the car explosion was meant for her. John had to step in to protect his woman and kid," Michael said with a cold smile.

"So, what do we do? Should we keep laying low or maybe throw out some fake info to stir up trouble between Paxton and John's guys?" Mike suggested.

Michael thought for a moment and nodded. "Yeah, let's go with that. We need to buy some time; our people need more time to fully infiltrate the Brown Family."

Mike agreed and hung up.

But just as Michael put his phone away, Jerry's phone rang.

Jerry glanced at the caller ID and answered the call right in front of Michael.

"What's up? Why the emergency call?" Jerry asked, looking serious.

The call was from Tim, who had infiltrated the Brown Family's business. Jerry had told them not to call unless it was urgent, as it could blow their cover.

Tim, on the other end, sounded worried. "Sir, I think I've been made, but they haven't outed me yet. I found out the Brown Family has other issues."

Michael and Jerry both frowned.

"What do you mean? You got made but you're still there and found more problems? Explain," Jerry demanded coldly.

Tim quickly said, "I suspect the Brown Family has been infiltrated by others. I looked into the employees and found many used to work for the Taylor Family. After Paxton took over, he kept a lot of them. Many top execs are still former Taylor Family people."

Michael grabbed Jerry's phone and asked, "Wait, I get it. You're saying the person who found you out is from the Taylor Family? But they didn't report you, right?"

Tim hesitated. "Mr. Williams, you're there too? Yes, that's exactly it."

Michael narrowed his eyes. "Paxton's no idiot. Even though he took over the Taylor Family's company, he must've put his own people in charge. Got any other intel?"

###chapter 413 Infiltrated

Tim was sharp and perfect for undercover work. He noticed details better than Joe.

After just a few days at Paxton's company, Tim had already dug up some juicy info.

"Yeah, I've found some other stuff. There are four top dogs at the company I infiltrated. Paxton's right-hand man is pretty powerful, while the other three are just there for support. They all used to be part of the Taylor Family. I found out Paxton's guy got bought off with cash," Tim told Michael.

Tim had secretly tailed Paxton's right-hand man and discovered that he and the other three top execs were knee-deep in corruption and bribery.

"Now those four are thick as thieves. Paxton's guy won't turn on the others to save his own skin," Tim said over the phone.

A grin spread across Michael's face. He leaned back in his chair, tapping his fingers on the desk.

"These Taylor Family folks are pretty interesting. Looks like we underestimated them," Michael chuckled, realizing he needed to rethink his plan.

Isabella had told Michael about Patrick dissolving the family. Michael had always suspected that the senior members loyal to the Taylor Family wouldn't be easily swayed, and it seemed he was right.

"Mr. Williams, these Taylor Family members showing up is a wild card. What should we do? Should we reach out and see if we can work together?" Jerry asked, sensing an opportunity.

The Taylor Family members had been working at the Brown Family's company for years. They were probably more integrated and had more control over the Brown Family's power than their own people.

Michael looked thoughtful. "It seems the Taylor Family might be on our side, but Isabella is now the company's president, and they haven't reached out to her. They might have other motives. We need to figure out what they're thinking."

Jerry nodded. "You're right, Mr. Williams. If they have other motives, contacting them could put your wife in danger."

Michael narrowed his eyes. "When a flock scatters, hungry wolves pick them off one by one. To avoid chaos, there needs to be a leader. These people must have someone they're loyal to, someone organizing them."

"So, even if we reach out, they won't listen unless we find their leader?" Jerry asked.

Michael nodded.

Jerry sighed. "But we have no clue who the leader is. How do we find them?"

Michael smiled. "There's someone who might know."

"Who?" Jerry asked, curious.

Michael mentioned the name, "Carol, the head of HR at Isabella's company."

He pulled out some info on Carol from his drawer and handed it to Jerry. "You should've looked into her before. She's got a secret info channel, probably set up by Patrick from the Taylor Family."

Jerry skimmed through the file and closed it. He'd seen it before and wondered why Michael was bringing it up now.

"Get someone to reach out to Carol and find out where the leader is," Michael said casually.

Jerry got the idea but was a bit uneasy.

"Mr. Williams, Carol's not that simple. Asking her outright could tip her off. Who do you think is best for this job?" Jerry asked.

Michael hesitated. The best guy for the job was Joe because he was great with women and a good actor.

"I'd go with Joe, but you know, he's currently wanted by the authorities," Michael said, a bit helpless.

Jerry frowned and thought for a moment. "I agree, Joe's perfect for this. Maybe we can disguise him?"

After some thought, Michael decided to let Joe decide. Disguising Joe wasn't the best idea because even the best disguise could be seen through, especially by someone sharp like Carol. Plastic surgery was an option, but it took too long, and they needed to act fast.

Without wasting time, Michael called Mike and asked him to pass the phone to Joe.

Joe was puzzled when he got Michael's call.

"What's up, Mr. Williams? Need something?" Joe asked curiously.

Michael smiled and said, "I have a task for you. You need to make contact with a woman."

Joe's eyes lit up. "How old is she? Is she hot? What's her bust size?"

Michael smirked. He had Carol's info, but not those details.

He looked at Jerry.

Jerry hesitated and said, "Joe, you know Black Widow from the Avengers?"

"Oh my god, are you saying I get to meet a babe who looks like Black Widow?" Joe's tone was full of excitement.

Jerry nodded. "Something like that, she's pretty stunning."

Joe jumped up from the couch. "Don't worry, Mr. Williams. I'll take this seriously and won't let you down."

Jerry shrugged at Michael, who found it a bit amusing.

"Joe, you know your situation. John and Paxton are after you. If you show up, you could be in danger," Michael warned.

Joe waved it off. "Don't worry, Mr. Williams. I'm not stupid. I like beautiful women, but I'm careful. Send me her info, and I'll figure out a way to approach her."

Michael nodded, trusting Joe's caution.

###chapter 414 Joe's Identity

Michael asked Jerry to take Carol's info to Joe, then he started planning the next steps.

After getting Carol's info, Joe thought it over for a bit and decided to join Isabella's company as a job seeker to get in touch with Carol.

Joe put on a white shirt, a blue tie, black-framed glasses, fixed his hair, and finally shaved his beard.

Joe posed in front of the mirror. Now he looked like a fresh college grad getting ready for an interview at Isabella's company.

"Something's missing," Joe frowned, checking out his reflection.

Suddenly, Joe had an idea. He closed his eyes in front of the mirror and opened them again, with a look of youthful enthusiasm and eagerness.

"Now it feels right. A young grad should have a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world. Can't be looking like a thug," Joe smiled at his reflection.

Joe had previously played a thug to blend in with a gang. The laid-back, slightly rebellious vibe made him feel at ease.

Even after the gang broke up, Joe hadn't completely shaken off his gangster vibe. Now, with a new mission, he needed to disguise himself again.

"Mike, how do I look now?" Joe walked up to Mike, pushed up his glasses, and flashed a genuine smile.

Mike leaned on the table, giving Joe a once-over.

Joe was now wearing a blue suit jacket with a canvas bag slung over his shoulder. He looked much younger after shaving his beard. With his new demeanor, even his old gang buddies might not recognize him.

"Not bad. You look like a fresh college grad, with a hint of naive innocence in your eyes," Mike said, appreciating Joe's disguise.

Joe rolled his eyes. "Mike, I know you've never been a college student, so you're jealous. College kids are the most passionate people around! They're not naive!"

"Alright, Mr. Student Council President Joe. I admit I misspoke, I apologize. So, you heading out now?" Mike raised his hands in surrender, then pointed to the door.

Joe nodded. "I just scheduled a 2 pm interview. I'm ready to go. Even though Ms. Lester is a bit older, I think she'll like my type."

Joe puffed out his chest, showing off his toned chest muscles under the shirt.

Mike rolled his eyes and tossed a set of car keys to Joe. "College student Joe, here's a little car your dad got you as a job-seeking gift."

Joe looked at the keys in his hand, walked to the window, pressed the button on the key, and a car outside honked.

"Where'd you drag this old relic from, a scrapyard? I should've made a resume for a rich job seeker. Then I wouldn't have to drive this junk," Joe muttered.

Mike gave Joe a swift kick in the butt. "Hey, having a car is better than squeezing onto the subway and risking being recognized. Remember, you're playing a kid from an ordinary family, and this car fits your image perfectly."

Joe sighed, brushed off the dust from his pants, and gave Mike a gentlemanly nod before heading downstairs to the old yellow Volkswagen Beetle.

"Let's see if you can turn into Bumblebee, buddy," Joe muttered as he inserted the key into the ignition.

The Beetle made a dull engine noise. After a few tries, it finally started.

"I hope Ms. Lester sees my youth, handsomeness, and ambition and decides to give me a car. I prefer a Porsche," Joe shrugged and drove off.

At Isabella's company, in the HR department.

Carol held a stack of resumes from applicants.

She knew that among these applicants, there were spies planted by the four major families. However, due to the lack of lower-level employees in the company, she had to let these spies in for now and remove them all when the company grew stronger.

But Carol did not allow these spies in her HR department. She looked through the resumes, hoping to find new employees suitable for her department.

Suddenly, Carol stopped at a name. "Jack Sparrow? The name of a pirate captain is quite unique."

Carol took a closer look at the resume. This guy was an ordinary college student, with no outstanding features. The only noteworthy thing was participating in a school football game and winning an award once, but then he never made a name for himself again. He was a very ordinary man.

The only thing that caught Carol's interest was that Jack Sparrow was quite handsome and graduated from the same university as she did.

Carol dialed a phone number. The person on the other end was her former teacher from college, now the head of the academic affairs office.

Carol asked the teacher to investigate Jack to confirm his identity.

Soon, the teacher updated Carol on the investigation results. Jack was indeed a student at their school, with average grades. The important part? His record showed no signs of trouble. He didn't smoke, wasn't really into drinking, and his favorite pastimes were reading and working out. He had tried to pursue the cheerleading captain back in college, but she turned him down, and he hadn't dated anyone since.

"A romantic guy after all." Carol looked at Joe's information, a smile playing on her lips.

When Joe parked and arrived at Isabella's company, he noticed many job seekers who looked like college students, with youthful optimism in their eyes.

'Not bad, it seems like I disguised myself well. At least my demeanor matches theirs.' Joe thought contentedly in his mind.

Just then, a voice behind Joe said, "Are you Jack Sparrow?"

###chapter 415 Exposed

When Joe heard someone calling 'Jack' behind him, he turned around, curious to see what this pirate captain looked like.

The person calling out was a girl with an HR department name tag around her neck. She was looking at Joe with curiosity in her eyes.

Joe suddenly remembered he was supposed to be Jack now.

"Hello, ma'am. I'm Jack. What can I do for you?" Joe asked, trying to sound casual but feeling a bit nervous, just like a job seeker would.

The girl smiled and said, "I'm Sarah Moore, the assistant to the HR manager. Since you're here for an HR position, our manager, Ms. Lester, will be interviewing you. She asked me to bring you up."

"Got it, lead the way, please," Joe replied politely.

Sarah nodded and led Joe to the elevator.

In the elevator, Sarah kept sneaking glances at Joe, thinking he was quite handsome.

After a moment, Joe moved a bit closer to Sarah and asked with a smile, "Ms. Moore, any tips for the interview? It's my first one, and I'm pretty nervous."

Sarah felt a bit flustered by Joe's charm, her cheeks turning slightly pink.

Blushing, Sarah said, "The interview process is pretty straightforward. Just listen to Ms. Lester's questions and answer them. When I was interviewed, her questions were all very simple."

Joe's eyes lit up. "Thanks for the heads-up. Can you tell me what questions she asked you?"

Sarah nodded and shared the questions Carol had asked her: a brief self-introduction, career goals, and how to handle HR issues like conflicts between employees.

"So, how would you handle a situation like that?" Joe asked, looking into Sarah's eyes.

Feeling Joe's gaze, Sarah's heartbeat quickened. Nervously, she said, "From my college experience, it's best not to escalate such matters. If too many people know, it affects company harmony. I'd bring them to a room, let them discuss the incident, ask witnesses to confirm the truth, and then compile everything into a report for the higher-ups to decide."

After she finished, Sarah looked at Joe curiously. "How would you handle it?"

Joe shrugged. "Back in school, I'd just kick them both out and let them fight it out in an alley. Whoever wins is right."

Sarah blinked, looking at Joe helplessly. "That's definitely not the right approach. It's better to follow my method. After I explained my approach, Ms. Lester hired me on the spot."

Joe looked at Sarah, puzzled. "Did Ms. Lester only ask that one question? Were there any others?"

Sarah nodded. "Oh, there were definitely more. Sometimes Ms. Lester would ask things like, if a friend in the company leaked confidential info to a rival and begged you not to tell, would you choose friendship or the company's interests?"

"How did you answer that?" Joe asked, intrigued.

"Honestly, I didn't really want to answer that one, and luckily I didn't have to. Most people said they'd betray their friend for the company," Sarah said, looking a bit helpless.

"I think they made the right call. Leaking company secrets is both illegal and unethical. It's about making our friends realize their mistakes; after all, mistakes should be punished," Sarah shared her thoughts.

Joe shook his head. "Nah, I don't think everyone sees it that way."

Sarah tilted her head, confused. "Why do you think that? How do you think those people would feel?"

A mischievous grin spread across Joe's face. "If they're my friends, they should consider my interests. As my best friends, they'd be willing to make sacrifices for me. I'd be touched. I'd enthusiastically betray them and then use them to get what I need."

Sarah's eyes widened. "Are you serious?"

Joe nodded, deadpan. "Absolutely. My friends are great to me. I had a friend who got cancer, and when he heard I was buying a house, he asked which one I liked. He was ready to jump off that building because if someone dies in a building, it affects the real estate market, and prices might drop."

Sarah's mouth twitched, and she took a step back. "Your friends seem to have it rough."

Joe burst out laughing. "You didn't actually believe that, did you? Just kidding. I was nervous and wanted to lighten the mood. Hope you don't mind."

Sarah let out a sigh of relief. "You had me worried for a second. Alright, we've reached the floor. Ms. Lester's office is right ahead. Just knock and go in."

Sarah left Joe outside Carol's office, giving him an encouraging nod before she walked away.

Joe took a deep breath, straightened his tie and outfit, then knocked on the door.

"Come in," came Carol's voice from inside.

Joe turned the doorknob and walked in.

Carol was sitting behind her desk. She looked up and glanced at Joe.

'Ms. Lester is even more stunning than I expected. Let's see how I can win her over,' Joe thought, feeling confident.

"Hello, Ms. Lester, I'm Jack, here to apply for a position in the HR department," Joe said respectfully.

Carol looked him up and down, then a smile appeared on her lips. "Are you sure your name is Jack? Because I feel like you should be called Joe."

Joe was instantly stunned.

###chapter 416 Confession

Joe didn't see it coming. All his hard work went down the drain the moment he stepped through the door.

Still, Joe clung to a shred of hope. Maybe Carol was just messing with him. After all, his disguise wasn't perfect.

Carol might've thought Joe and Jack looked kinda similar, so she was trying to confirm Joe's identity.

Joe saw the confused look on Carol's face. "Sorry, ma'am, I don't get what you're saying. Who's Joe? Are you talking to me? That's not my name."

Carol smirked at Joe's confused expression. "You think you did a good job with that disguise, huh? Even changed the info in the university records. But did you know the real Jack looks nothing like you?"

She opened the tablet on the table and slid it over to Joe.

Joe glanced at it, a slight smirk forming on his lips. The resume was just like his, except for the photo of another guy.

Mike had messed with Joe's info, saying the mission was urgent, so he had a hacker swap the photo in the university records with Joe's. He didn't think Carol would catch on.

Actually, Carol didn't realize Joe's info was fake at first. It was because the Jack in the records had once hit on the cheerleading captain, who was part of Carol's intel team.

What happened next was pretty simple. Carol called up the cheerleading captain for some info.

The name Jack Sparrow was pretty memorable, so the cheerleading captain still remembered him.

"I thought this Jack guy was kinda cute. Why'd you turn him down?" Carol had asked, curious.

The cheerleading captain had replied with disgust, "That gross short dude with a face full of zits gave me sheets covered in his jizz. He said he jerked off thinking about me every night as a sign of his love. Ugh, it was so nasty. My friends and I beat him up, and he ended up in the hospital. We were scared of getting in trouble with the school, so we kept it quiet."

After hearing the cheerleading captain's description of the real Jack, Carol immediately knew Joe was a fake.

After finishing the call, Carol looked at Joe's photo, feeling like she'd seen him before.

Since Carol ran the intel team, her instincts were usually spot on. She racked her brain for info about Joe, finally matching his current look with a troublemaker in some document.

"Alright, now can you tell me why you're really here? Don't give me that hiding nonsense; I won't buy it," Carol said, fiddling with her phone.

Joe glanced at Carol's phone and smiled. He knew if he didn't give her a good answer, she'd definitely call Paxton or John.

"Alright, Ms. Lester, since you really wanna know, I'll spill," Joe said, locking eyes with Carol. His vibe shifted from a college kid to a man with some serious charm.

Carol froze, her fingers pausing on her phone.

Joe stepped closer, placing his hands on the table, staring into her eyes with a look that could melt ice. "Truth is, I've had a thing for you for a while. I came here because I wanted to be with you."

Carol's phone clattered onto the table, her eyes wide with shock. "What are you saying? You're here for love?"

Joe noticed the faint blush creeping up Carol's cheeks. It was clear she hadn't felt this kind of attention in a long time.

He kept his gaze locked on hers. "Yeah, Ms. Lester. I checked out the university you went to and saw you published some papers. They're really impressive. I got to know you through them, and I was totally captivated by your charm."

Carol's blush deepened, her breathing quickening. "Don't lie to me. How come I don't know about my own charm?"

Suddenly, Joe leaned in and grabbed her hand.

Carol flinched, trying to pull away, but Joe's grip was firm.

"Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you. I just don't get why you don't see how amazing you are. You're beautiful, talented, and everything about you fascinates me," Joe said, pressing a gentle kiss to the back of her hand.

Carol's breath hitched, and she stood up abruptly.

"Stop it, let go of me. If someone sees us, I could get accused of workplace harassment," she said, her face flushed.

Joe let go, smiling.

Carol quickly hid her hands behind her back, still blushing. "Am I really as great as you say?"

Joe nodded, his eyes soft. "I know, Ms. Lester, you probably don't like someone like me, a guy from a gang. Honestly, I hate that part of my life too, especially now that I'm being hunted. But my love for you is stronger than all that, and I had to see you one last time before... well, before it's too late."

Carol's expression shifted to one of concern. "It can't be that bad yet, right? I mean, you're still here, not caught."

Joe's eyes lit up. "Wait, are you actually worried about me?" he asked, practically bouncing with excitement. "Oh my god, the girl of my dreams just showed she cares! I could die happy right now!"

Joe's excitement was palpable, but Carol shyly turned her face away, avoiding his gaze.

"You misunderstood, that's not what I meant," she said, her voice tinged with embarrassment.

###chapter 417 All Actors

Carol's shy vibe really got to Joe.

He walked around the desk, grabbed her shoulders, and got close.

"So, Ms. Lester, what should I do now?" Joe asked, looking at her with those loving eyes.

Carol's face turned even redder, her breath quickened, and she tried to push him away.

"Don't do this, I'm not ready. Maybe you should find a job here first," she said, her voice shaky.

Joe gave her a gentle smile. "So, Ms. Lester, will you hire me?"

"Actually, we both work for Ms. Taylor," Carol pointed out.

Joe just shook his head, still smiling. "I don't care who I work for. Being with you is all that matters."

Carol felt her heart melt at his tenderness.

"Wait, there's a loose thread on your shirt," she said, grabbing a pair of scissors and moving closer.

A blue thread was sticking out of Joe's collar.

Carol carefully snipped it off.

They were so close, feeling each other's warmth and quick breaths.

Suddenly, Joe hugged her, making her jump. She looked up at him, shocked.

Joe gazed into her eyes, slowly lowering his head.

Carol's lips trembled, anticipating what was coming. She closed her eyes.

Just as their lips were about to meet, a knock on the door startled them.

Carol quickly pushed Joe away and straightened her clothes.

"Come in," she called out, her face still a bit red.

Juliet walked in.

"Ms. Lester, Ms. Taylor asked me to bring these documents," Juliet said, noticing the weird vibe.

Only Carol and a handsome guy were in the office. Carol looked flustered, and Joe seemed calm, even smiling at Juliet.

Sensing the awkwardness, Juliet put the documents on Carol's desk, giving them a curious look.

"Alright, Juliet. Got it. Anything else from Ms. Taylor?" Carol asked, trying to sound calm.

Juliet shook her head. "Nope, just the documents. I'll leave now."

Juliet wasn't dumb; she felt the tension and quickly left.

After she was gone, Carol sighed in relief.

She glared at Joe, who just shrugged and smiled.

"Sorry, you're just too irresistible," Joe said.

Carol waved it off. "Enough, let's drop it. Your start date is tomorrow. Can you make it?"

Joe nodded. "I can, but I don't have a place to stay right now. You know my situation. I even took a risk and showered at a motel just to see you today."

After a moment of hesitation, Carol pulled a key from her drawer and tossed it to him. "This is my apartment key. You can crash there for now."

Joe caught the key, giving her a grateful nod. "Thanks a lot, dear. I'll be waiting for you at home."

He winked at her, blew a kiss, and then walked out of her office.

As soon as Joe left and closed the door, Carol's flustered expression vanished, and she got back to her usual self.

She pulled out her phone, sent a quick message, and then sat down to tackle the files Isabella had given her.

Meanwhile, Joe bumped into Sarah on his way out.

"How'd the interview go, Jack?" Sarah asked, curious.

Joe smiled. "Thanks, Sarah. Your advice was spot on. Looks like I got the job, so we'll be colleagues soon."

Sarah was thrilled to hear that.

"Want to grab dinner tonight? I can fill you in on more about the company," she offered.

Joe checked his watch, looking a bit regretful. "Sorry, Sarah, I have plans this afternoon. Maybe another time?"

A flicker of disappointment crossed Sarah's face. "Sure, another time then."

Joe said his goodbyes and left Isabella's company.

Meanwhile, Juliet headed to Isabella's office to share what she'd seen.

"Ms. Taylor, I haven't seen that guy on the HR floor before. He must be a job applicant or a new hire. But I think Ms. Lester and that new guy might..." Juliet hesitated, unsure how to phrase it.

Isabella looked up, smiling. "Don't worry about Carol. She's not one to act rashly just because a guy is handsome. Just keep this to yourself and don't let it affect her plans."

Juliet scratched her head, a bit confused, but she knew Isabella was right.

Isabella waved her off, signaling her to leave.

Isabella wasn't too concerned about Carol's personal life. She trusted her.

A woman who could climb the corporate ladder had to be sharp and savvy. Most importantly, Isabella believed Carol wasn't the type to get involved in office drama or shady behavior.

Meanwhile, Joe arrived at Carol's apartment and immediately started searching for surveillance and listening devices. He didn't fully trust her.

###chapter 418 A Love Poem

If Joe was a total idiot, Michael would've never hired him back. Shy folks usually play it safe and think things through.

Joe knew his good looks and a few sweet lines wouldn't be enough to win Carol over.

Carol probably still had her doubts about him, but time would tell.

To be safe, Joe did a thorough sweep of the room and didn't find any bugs or hidden cameras. This made him feel better but also a bit confused.

"Did she really not mess with this room?" Joe muttered, still suspicious, as he scanned the walls and ceiling.

Joe grabbed a chair, stood on it in the living room, and checked the ceiling for any hidden devices but found nothing.

Finally, he cranked up the music on a speaker in the living room, blasting it at full volume.

Soon enough, there was a knock on the door.

Joe peeked through the peephole and saw a middle-aged woman looking pretty ticked off.

"How can I help you, ma'am?" Joe asked, opening the door with a friendly smile.

The woman's anger faded a bit when she saw Joe's handsome face. She still looked annoyed but said, "Sir, could you please turn down the volume? I just got off a night shift and need to sleep."

"I'm really sorry, ma'am. I was just testing my new speaker. I'll turn it off right away." Joe quickly went back and turned off the music.

"Feeling better now, ma'am?" Joe asked, still looking apologetic.

The woman smiled. "Much better, thank you. I live next door. My name's Tammy. If you need anything, just let me know."

Tammy Thorne waved and headed back to her place.

After Tammy left, Joe felt sure no one was eavesdropping next door.

If someone was spying, they wouldn't have come over. They'd act like nothing happened. Tammy's reaction confirmed it.

Joe jumped onto Carol's bed. The bedding was a luxurious purple with a silky feel.

Joe knew this type of woman well-cool on the outside but fiery inside, like a queen waiting for a man to conquer her and fill the void in her heart.

Just then, Joe's phone rang. He saw it was Mike calling. Joe picked up.

"How's it going? What stage are you at now?" Mike asked.

"I'm in Carol's house now. Her bed is way cozier than yours," Joe said with a smirk.

Mike paused, "Weren't you supposed to get into Isabella's company? How'd you end up at Carol's place?"

Joe waved the house key around like a trophy. "It's all thanks to my irresistible charm. She's got some deep desires, man. This mission's gonna be a breeze."

Mike's mouth twitched. "Just be careful, and call me if you run into any trouble."

"Relax, Mike. I've got this. Don't you trust my charm?" Joe grinned smugly, hopping off the bed and heading to the kitchen.

"Alright, Mike, gotta go. Time to whip up dinner for the lovely Ms. Lester. Her kitchen's stocked, so I'm making a feast," Joe said, about to hang up.

But Mike cut in, "Hold on, don't hang up yet. I need to ask you something."

Joe pulled out a carton of eggs from the fridge and asked casually, "What's up?"

"When you were the gang leader, didn't you read the old boss's diary? Describe the format and style of the paper," Mike said seriously, showing this was important.

Joe's eyebrows shot up. "You planning to forge a diary?"

Mike didn't deny it. "Yeah, we might need to, but we need your help."

Joe set the eggs on the counter and thought back. "The diary was pretty standard, and the paper was common. The tricky part was his handwriting-it was kinda unique. Damn, how could I forget that?" Joe suddenly slapped his forehead as he remembered something.

"What did you remember?" Mike asked eagerly, knowing this task was straight from Michael.

Mike could guess Michael's plan-to create some fake evidence to send to Paxton and take out certain people.

Joe pulled out his phone, searched for something, and sent a photo to Mike.

"That guy once wrote a love poem and asked me if it was good enough for his mistress. You can copy his handwriting from this," Joe said.

Mike looked at the love poem Joe sent, his lips twitching. "'I want to have a beautiful house with you, sunlight streaming through the windows, shining on your serene face, time freezes at this moment, no evening, no sunset.' This is from a rough gang leader? It reads like a woman's delicate penmanship."

Joe shrugged. "Never underestimate a man in love. We all have hidden talents when it comes to wooing women."

"Got it. Thanks for the poem," Mike said, hanging up somewhat helplessly.

After putting away his phone, Joe cracked an egg into a bowl, planning to make some cupcakes for dessert.

Michael took the cupcakes out of the oven and placed them in front of Isabella.

"Darling, try the dessert I made," Michael said, looking at Isabella with anticipation.

###chapter 419 Passion

Isabella gave Michael a thumbs up after tasting his cupcakes.

"Ever thought about becoming a chef, babe? These cupcakes are amazing," she said, praising his skills.

Michael's face lit up. Whether he was a chef or not, seeing his loved ones enjoy his food always made him happy.

"I only cook for you. Even my dad hasn't had the pleasure," Michael said, giving Isabella a playful pat on the head.

Isabella tilted her head, looking at Michael like she had an idea.

"Babe, I still have that catering company that's been struggling. If you don't mind, maybe you could take over?" she asked hopefully.

Michael sighed. "We've talked about this, babe. I don't want to work in your company."

Isabella's face fell. "Carol's been driving me nuts. I've handed over the clothing design to the Olympic Committee, and now it's up to them. But Carol keeps pushing me to manage the other two companies, and I can't find the right people. What am I supposed to do? I don't have the talent."

Michael raised an eyebrow. Isabella might lack talent in that area, but he didn't.

"Babe, maybe it's not about talent. You're beautiful and even have the title of a goddess spokesperson, but your popularity isn't quite there yet. If the Olympic Committee picks your design for the Olympics, you'll have the charisma to attract talent from other industries," he said with a smile.

He could send people to interview with Isabella, but that would make her suspicious. She knew her charisma wasn't enough to draw in talented people on its own.

Isabella nodded but looked a bit down. "I'm really nervous about this global design competition. I believe in my design, but I've seen the others, and they're good too. It's making me doubt myself."

Michael gently stroked her hair. "Cheer up, babe. I believe in you. Good luck will be on your side."

Isabella rolled her eyes and pushed his hand away. "I've given up on luck. If I were lucky, lightning would strike that bitch Bianca. Because of her sneaky photos, there are negative comments online. People think I did something to offend her? Damn it, I've never even provoked her."

Isabella was angry. She was most worried about the Olympic Committee, which, because of the weird comments online, had doubts about her work, even though she was the victim.

Michael couldn't do much, so he just hugged Isabella. "Don't worry, babe, everything will be fine."

Just as he said that, a thunderous boom echoed around them.

Outside the villa, the wind was howling, and lightning was flashing across the sky.

Isabella jumped and rushed to the window as the rain started pouring down.

"The weather's getting nasty. It's so cold and wet. I wonder how many homeless people are gonna freeze tonight," she sighed.

Michael glanced at the storm and grinned at Isabella. "Maybe that lightning will strike Bianca, just like you wished."

"Yes, strike her!" Isabella laughed loudly.

Whether Bianca got struck by lightning or not, no one knew. But Joe felt like he was about to collapse.

In Carol's room, Joe was holding Carol, and they were going at it like rabbits.

Since dinner, they'd been at it non-stop. It was now early morning, and Joe hadn't had a break.

The sheets were soaked with sweat and other fluids, so they moved their activities to the sofa, then the living room, kitchen, and bathroom.

Carol's moans were drowned out by the thunder; otherwise, the neighbors would have definitely complained.

Joe was right-Carol was insatiable. It wasn't until he felt like he'd run a marathon and collapsed that she finally stopped.

Carol also took a break.

Joe was utterly spent, not even sure how many times he'd finished. His body ached, and he felt completely drained.

"Dear, you were amazing. I'm very satisfied. I'll go change the sheets and then take you to bed," Carol said with a charming smile, walking naked to the bedroom to change the sheets.

With Carol's help, Joe finally lay down and quickly fell asleep from exhaustion.

A loud thunderbolt woke Joe up, startling him.

He tried to move but realized his hands were tied. Panic set in as he fully woke up and saw his hands and feet bound to the bed.

"Wait, babe, what are you doing? Why do you have scissors?" Joe screamed in horror.

Carol, in her nightgown, stood by the bed with a large pair of scissors. The lightning outside made them gleam menacingly.

A cold smile spread across Carol's face as she sat next to Joe, gently touching his thigh.

"Joe, tell me, who sent you? What's your real reason for being here?" she asked calmly.

Joe forced a smile. "Babe, what are you talking about? No one sent me. I came because I like you, so I... Wait, stop!" Joe's eyes widened in terror as Carol slowly brought the scissors closer to his genitals.

###chapter 420 Okay, I Confess

Joe was terrified. He could endure broken limbs, but losing his dick was unbearable.

"What do you want? What you're doing is illegal! You can't just cut it off after using it!" Joe shouted in horror at Carol.

Carol's hand stopped, hesitating as she looked at Joe's penis. "You're right, Joe. Your penis has been very helpful, giving me pleasure I haven't felt in a long time. Your body is much more effective than a sex toy."

Carol leaned close to Joe, gently kissing his cheek. "You mentioned that this is illegal, right? But it's okay. After I cut it off, I'll hand it over to Paxton or John. I think they should have excellent surgeons to help you stitch up the wound and maybe add some new ones for you."

A devilish smile appeared on Carol's lips, making Joe jump in fear.

Joe couldn't imagine what would happen if he was handed over to Paxton. Would he end up like Pearl?

"If you really care about me, then let me go. Please don't do this, I truly love you," Joe cried, looking at Carol with affection.

"If you keep looking at me like that, I'll gouge your eyes out with these scissors. I don't think Paxton and the others would mind if you were missing a few organs. As long as your brain and mouth are intact, they should reward me," Carol said coldly, bringing the large scissors closer.

Joe's eyes suddenly cleared. "Wait, Carol, why do you always doubt me? Have you never believed a word I've said?"

Resting her head on Joe's side, Carol smirked, "Let me guess, the first thing you did when you came to my apartment was to search for bugs and surveillance devices, right? Did you ever really trust me?"

Joe stared at Carol in disbelief. "How did you know? Damn it, there really are surveillance devices here. But how did I not notice them?"

Carol pointed to a painting on the wall. "During World War II, all kinds of listening devices brought a strong sense of novelty to people. One type of listening device didn't require any electrical components but emitted specific frequencies through sound vibrations, used in conjunction with special receivers."

Joe couldn't believe it. "You used those antiques to spy on me?"

Carol extended her finger, scratching Joe's chin. "This face is quite handsome; digging out your eyes would ruin its beauty."

Joe swallowed hard. When he checked for monitoring devices, he only focused on electronic components. He never expected to fall for Carol's trap.

"Alright, the flirtatious time is over. Can you answer my question now, dear?" Carol's eyes gradually turned cold as she raised the scissors again.

Feeling a cold sensation around his penis, Joe was stimulated, but there was no sign of arousal.

Joe's tense body trembled slightly, his lips quivering as he tried to lie, but the scissors were gradually closing in, and his skin started to feel the sting.

"Wait, I'll speak up. I confess," Joe screamed in terror.

The stinging sensation on his penis stopped, indicating Carol had halted the scissors.

Carol looked silently at Joe.

Nervously swallowing, Joe said, "In a way, we should be considered allies. Because our goal is to help Ms. Taylor. Jasper going back to his country, you know? It was my arrangement! My people brought him back from abroad."

Carol looked at Joe with suspicion, staring into his eyes to judge his sincerity.

"Why did you do this? Don't tell me it's because you have a crush on Isabella; no one would believe that," Carol said, coldly observing Joe.

Joe shook and exclaimed as if he had heard something terrifying. "Are you kidding me? How could I possibly have a crush on Isabella! I have no feelings for her, really! I only respect her, no inappropriate thoughts!"

Carol paused, taken aback by Joe's intense reaction.

"It seems like you're a little afraid of Ms. Taylor? Why is that?" Carol asked curiously.

After hesitating, Joe said, "I can only tell you that we won't harm Ms. Taylor. Everything we do is to help her because she is our boss's wife."

Carol widened her eyes, seeming to realize something. "You mean Ms. Taylor's mysterious husband, the ordinary man who has never shown his face?"

Joe nodded, then shook his head. "He's not just an ordinary man. My boss has significant influence abroad, otherwise, why haven't the four major families uncovered his identity?"

"Are you trying to deceive me again? You know I can't find out the man's identity either, so you're trying to fool me with this?" Carol sneered, placing the scissors on Joe's penis again.

Joe's eyes widened as he screamed, "No, I'm not lying to you! Because our boss's overseas activities involve bloodshed and violence. He's afraid Isabella will be disgusted by what he's done in the past, so he dares not reveal his identity. But his love for Isabella is genuine."

Carol narrowed her eyes. "What's your boss's name?"

Joe shook his head. "I can only tell you about something he did, but I will never reveal his identity, even if you kill me."

Seeing Joe's determined expression, Carol hesitated and asked, "What did your boss do?"

Joe sighed. "Ms. Taylor was once kidnapped, you know, by Pearl."

Carol nodded, well aware of this incident.

"Pearl, that despicable person, wanted to have our boss's wife gang-raped, take photos, and then kill her. Our boss was furious, so he turned her into what she is now," Joe revealed the long-buried truth.

Carol widened her eyes, finally realizing who was behind turning Pearl into that terrifying figure.

Joe continued, "Isabella doesn't know the whole story. She even suspects that the four major families orchestrated the incident to incite conflict between the Williams Family and the Brown Family, but she never thought it was just a husband seeking revenge for his injured wife."

###chapter 421 Joining the Plan

Joe laid it all out, hoping to win Carol's trust.

"Why should I believe you?" Carol asked, her eyes steady but skeptical.

"You don't have to," Joe replied. "But if you really want to help bring the Taylor Family back, we can team up." He was being honest about why he was there.

"Our people have infiltrated the Brown Family's industries, trying to blend in. But we found out that these industries are actually guarded by Taylor Family members, waiting for some kind of signal. You probably know what they're waiting for. We need to contact that person." Joe laid out the plan.

Carol hesitated. From what Joe said, it seemed Isabella's husband had already made contact with those hidden individuals. She just needed to confirm Joe's story.

Joe had no reason to lie. What he said seemed legit.

Seeing Carol's hesitation, Joe knew he had her.

"Once Paxton finds out the truth about his daughter's condition, he'll stop at nothing to go after Ms. Taylor. Remember, it was his daughter's attempt to kidnap Ms. Taylor that led to this mess. He won't care if Ms. Taylor is a victim." Joe upped the stakes, hoping to convince Carol.

In the end, Carol gave in.

"I'll check out what you've said. If you're lying, you'll regret it." Carol glared at Joe, then cut the rope binding his hands.

Joe sat up, looking at the rope still around his feet. "Can you untie my feet too?"

Carol tossed the scissors, and they landed on the bed, just inches from Joe's crotch.

Joe gulped. "Can we not joke like that? It's a bit much."

Carol smirked. "Coward. What do you think Ms. Taylor would do if I told her about this? Think her husband is a psycho or a mob boss?"

Joe cut the rope on his feet and shook his head. "If I were you, I wouldn't do that."

He got off the bed and looked at Carol seriously. "If Ms. Taylor divorces my boss because of this, you'll be in deep trouble. My boss loves Ms. Taylor, but he won't spare anyone else."

Joe looked into Carol's eyes. "No woman has ever scared me in bed. But you, you've got my attention. I don't want you to end up like Paxton's daughter."

Carol was taken aback by Joe's words.

Carol gave Joe a once-over. "Are you some kind of masochist?"

Joe frowned. "Fear can mess with your hormones. I don't know which one made me feel something for you, but since my body is into you, I'll roll with it."

"Gross. You couldn't handle me in bed anyway." Carol rolled her eyes and grabbed her coat.

"It's late, where are you going?" Joe asked, confused.

Carol pointed to the door. "I'm outta here. I don't want to hang around you. You're just here to scratch an itch. And for our deal, you better stay put."

Joe blinked, pointing to himself and then the floor. "Isn't this your place? What am I, a convenient hookup?"

"More like a male servant robot. I've got plenty of places like this." Carol walked up, touched Joe's face, and gave his crotch a playful flick before leaving with a smirk.

Joe's mouth twitched. He was usually the one doing the teasing; when did the tables turn?

After Carol left, Joe grabbed his phone from the bed.

As soon as he answered, he glanced around and spoke in a low voice.

"Plan A flopped. I jumped straight to Plan B, and it's working. Carol's buying it," Joe whispered.

Mike on the other end sounded puzzled. "Is she that desperate? You can't even talk right now?"

"Shut up, I'm fine! I had her screaming and begging in bed! Right before she climaxed, I switched to Plan B. She had no choice but to play along." Joe sounded proud, like he was telling the truth.

Mike didn't buy it; he knew Joe too well.

"What did Carol use to threaten you?" Mike asked.

"Scissors..." Joe regretted it the moment he said it.

Mike's voice turned curious. "Scissors? Did she threaten to cut off your dick and feed it to the dogs if you didn't spill?"

"Can you not be so graphic? My dick is big enough kill a dog!" Joe snapped.

Mike sounded grossed out. "Let's drop this. I don't need to know if your dick can kill a dog. So, the plan's on track, right? Any conditions?"

"She wants to meet Mr. Williams, but I said no, and she almost cut off my junk! In the end, she had other conditions. To keep things smooth, I have to stay under her watch," Joe said, exasperated.

"That's good. For the sake of Mr. and Mrs. Williams' success, you might just have to sacrifice your body for a bit," Mike teased before hanging up.

###chapter 422 Wanting to Have a Phone Call

A schemer always had a backup plan, especially when dealing with a sharp woman like Carol.

Carol never bought into Joe's love talk, and Joe didn't either. A senior leader in a department wouldn't just fall for a guy she met for the first time, no matter how good-looking he was.

Both of them were just playing a game, waiting to show their cards at the last moment and then start looking for an edge.

As for the cozy scene before the truth came out, that was just a bonus.

After leaving the apartment, Carol made a call. She needed someone to check if Joe was telling the truth.

Soon, Carol got a call back, and a slightly raspy voice came through the phone.

"Yeah, we've had some new faces around here lately. Looks like your little boyfriend was right," the guy on the phone said.

"He's not my boyfriend, just a decent plaything," Carol corrected.

The guy on the phone didn't expect Carol to be so blunt, so he went quiet for a moment.

Instead of continuing that topic, he said, "Tell your plaything we can work with them, but all the infiltrators have to go. We can't let them mess up our plan."

"How much longer do we have to wait for our plan to kick off? I'm getting bored," Carol said, sounding a bit helpless.

The guy sighed. "We have to wait for the right moment to take out Paxton and the other top execs. Plus, I think someone on our side has turned on us."

Carol frowned. "Who do you think it is?"

The guy shook his head. "I don't know. The whole situation feels off. Maybe 'betrayal' isn't the right word. Maybe this person was always a plant."

"Didn't the old leader get rid of all the moles?" Carol asked, still frowning.

The guy smirked. "Don't forget who the old leader was working with. How could he have gotten rid of all the moles? There are always slip-ups."

He let out a long sigh. "The time is almost here. When it comes, it'll be our chance to bring the family back."

Carol smiled bitterly. "I didn't expect Ms. Taylor to get this far. In my original plan, she would've needed more time to take over these three companies, but her husband messed everything up. Now she's moving too fast, and I'm worried it'll make some people suspicious."

"Suspicion is fine, at least we have some help now," the guy said, trying to sound reassuring. It seemed like things were still under control.

"Alright, hang up. Someone might be listening in. Don't forget to tell your plaything what I said," the guy said before hanging up.

Carol looked at her phone, sighed, and then headed back to the apartment.

She was on her way to find Joe.

Joe had just wrapped up a call with Mike and was about to head to the bathroom when the door swung open, making him jump.

Carol walked in, her eyes locked on Joe.

Joe's face went pale, shaking his head frantically. "What do you want? I mean, I have great stamina, but I can't keep going like this. I'm totally out of energy."

Joe felt his legs go weak.

Carol looked at Joe with disdain. "You can't even satisfy me. You're really useless."

Joe's eyes widened, and he shouted at Carol, "What? Six hours! A full six hours without stopping! My balls is almost flat! Doesn't recharging take time?"

Carol scratched her nose, a hint of embarrassment in her eyes. She was indeed a bit thirsty.

Carol waved her hand to change the subject. "Alright, I didn't come here to talk about that. I need to have a phone call with the guy behind you. I have something to tell him."

Joe hesitated. "Wait here, I'll go set it up."

Joe grabbed his phone and went to the balcony to make a call, dialing Jerry's number. After all, this was the time when Michael and Isabella were probably sleeping. He didn't dare disturb Michael's rest.

"So you're disturbing my sleep? Damn it, do you know how busy I've been lately? I finally get some shut-eye, and you wake me up! You damn bastard!" Jerry shouted, clearly pissed off.

Jerry, woken from his sleep, was furious. Joe was equally annoyed.

"What's with all the yelling? I'm just trying to help Mr. Williams here. All I want to know is if he's sleeping right now," Joe snapped back.

Jerry took a deep breath before saying, "Is it possible that when your little lover mentioned a phone call, she didn't mean right now but a time when he's available tomorrow?"

Joe was stunned for a moment, suddenly realizing that Carol only said she wanted to talk to Michael on the phone, not necessarily right now.

"Damn it, I must have been scared by that pair of scissors," Joe muttered.

"What scissors? What are you talking about? Did that woman threaten you with scissors? Damn it, she should cut off your dick! You idiot!" Jerry guessed the truth instantly and cursed at Joe.

Joe was initially angry but then smirked. "At least my dick still work. What about you, my friend? Your dick are fine, but you've never had a chance to use it."

Joe taunted Jerry for a bit, then hung up and turned off his phone.

Jerry was stunned for a moment, then became furious, trying to call Joe again but couldn't get through.

"Damn bastard, if I catch you, I'll ruin your dick!" Jerry roared at the air, unable to sleep.

The enraged Jerry directly called Mike. "Control your subordinate, you jerk! If he harasses me with calls again, I'll make sure you all pay for it!"

###chapter 423 Salvaging the Body

Mike was just about to hit the sack when Jerry called and chewed him out. But when Mike tried to call back, Jerry had already turned off his phone.

"Seriously? You call me in the middle of the night just to yell? What a jerk!" Mike fumed, then dialed another number.

After a few rings, someone picked up. "How's the job going?" Mike asked, trying to keep his cool.

"Boss, we've managed to copy the notes from that love poem, but who do we pin it on?" the voice on the other end asked respectfully.

Mike rubbed his nose and said casually, "Joseph, you know who I mean, right?"

"The Joseph who's second in line among the four big families? Got it, boss." The guy didn't need more details; he just followed orders.

Mike smirked. He'd asked Michael the same thing before, and Michael had immediately pointed the finger at Joseph.

"As an heir to a major family, he's always in the spotlight. Plus, we won't be hurting any innocents, and Paxton won't dare to go after him easily. It's the perfect choice," Michael had said nonchalantly.

"Is this just a personal grudge?" Mike had whispered, knowing Joseph also had a thing for Isabella.

"Think what you want. If you don't like this target, switch it to John," Michael had replied coolly before hanging up.

Mike chuckled, knowing both Joseph and John had beef with Isabella and Michael. It was all personal.

Mike pinched his forehead. "Besides the handwriting, did you recover the body?" he asked.

"Yeah, we got the body and put some key info in its pocket. We've also leaked the message to the Brown Family and John," the subordinate replied.

"Good. If anything goes wrong, let me know right away," Mike said before hanging up.

Everything was going just as Michael had planned. They had backup plans, but it looked like they wouldn't need them.

Meanwhile, Paxton was in high spirits. He hadn't found Joe yet, which was annoying, but he knew finding clues about Pearl wouldn't be easy.

Paxton was happy because Michael had finally agreed to team up with him, and they had started a company together. Now, Paxton could expand overseas, making the whole family happy.

"I knew Mr. Brown could pull it off!"

"Our family's gonna thrive again. Let's toast to Mr. Brown."

"I heard Mrs. Brown worked hard too. Let's toast to her as well."

At the Brown Family's banquet, everyone was showering Paxton with praise.

For them, expanding channels meant more cash rolling in down the line.

Paxton smiled and raised his glass, but there was a flicker of disdain in his eyes.

These folks shared his blood, but to them, he was just a money-making machine. He wanted to avenge Pearl, but they were always in his way.

'When I find the real culprit, anyone who tries to stop me is gonna regret it,' Paxton thought, a cold glint in his eyes.

Just then, Jonah walked in and whispered something in Paxton's ear.

Paxton narrowed his eyes, then turned to the family with a smile. "Enjoy your meal, I gotta take care of something," he said.

The family members weren't dumb. They saw the serious look on Paxton's face and knew something was up.

As Paxton was about to leave, an old man stood up.

"Paxton, got some trouble? We're family. Share it with us, maybe we can help," said Damian Brown, Paxton's uncle.

Paxton looked at Damian with a hint of contempt. Damian had never achieved anything, just lived off the family's wealth. Now, he always tried to act important because of his age.

"Yeah, Mr. Brown, if you have any issues, let us know, we can help," another woman chimed in.

This woman was Paxton's cousin. When her lover got beaten up, she openly opposed Paxton to protect her husband, asking him to back off Isabella.

Paxton didn't care much for these relatives, but as the head of the family, he had to play nice.

Paxton looked at them, a faint smile on his face.

"Since you wanna know, I'll tell you. The person who hurt my daughter has shown up, but they're now a dead body. Unfortunately, John's guys found the body too, and both sides are in a standoff. I'll go handle it," Paxton said, looking around.

The family members looked uneasy at the thought of facing John, especially Damian and Paxton's cousin.

The room went silent. Paxton waited for their response.

Finally, Damian stood up and said, "It's just a body. Both sides want it for an autopsy. We can work together. No need to fight John over a corpse."

The others nodded in agreement.

A hint of mockery flashed in Paxton's eyes, but he nodded. "You're right, it's not worth fighting over a dead body. I'll go handle it. Enjoy your meal."

Paxton's expression didn't change as he left the mansion. After he was gone, no one in the dining room felt like eating anymore.

###chapter 424 Confrontation

The family members huddled together, whispering, their respect for Paxton long gone.

"Didn't Mr. Brown hire a private eye to look into his daughter's injury? Did they finally find something?"

"More than just a lead. Haven't you heard the buzz from the police station?"

"Yeah, I heard. They say some foreign serial killer was brought back and did that to Pearl."

"Captured abroad, huh? Who's got the muscle to bust someone out of prison and bring them here to cause trouble?"

"Whoever's behind this is bad news. Paxton better not drag us into his mess again!"

They looked worried. The situation hadn't hit them directly, so they couldn't grasp Paxton's helplessness and anger as a father.

Paxton had no clue what they were gossiping about, and even if he did, he wouldn't care. He'd do anything for the family, but not at the cost of his daughter.

Driving towards the dock, Paxton's heart ached at the thought of forcing Pearl to marry Michael for the family's sake.

He'd given everything to the family, even willing to sacrifice Pearl for their interests. He ignored her suffering at Michael's hands until she ended up in the ICU. Only then did he realize what being a father truly meant.

"Hang in there, Pearl. I'll make those bastards pay tenfold for what they did to you," Paxton vowed, a cold glint in his eyes.

Though he seemed to be cooperating with Michael now, it was all a ruse to strengthen the family first and then make Michael pay dearly.

Paxton never saw Michael as a partner, only as an enemy to be used.

Meanwhile, at the dock, a bloated, unrecognizable body was found. From the clothes and other features, it was likely the missing serial killer.

People gathered around the body: Paxton's men on one side, John's on the other.

Both sides had gotten a tip that someone saw a guy who looked like the killer being dumped into the sea. It seemed like a case of silencing the killer.

Paxton's men were first on the scene. They got boats and fished the body out.

Before they could inform Paxton, John and his crew showed up.

John's men tried to take the body, but Paxton's guys stopped them.

Guns were drawn, and just as a shootout seemed inevitable, John called it off.

"Get Paxton here. I have some questions for him," John said coldly to Paxton's men.

They exchanged glances, and someone quickly reported the situation.

Before long, Paxton's car pulled up at the dock.

Paxton stepped out, wearing a coat, and walked over to John with a smile. "I heard you wanted to see me, Mr. Williams. What's on your mind?" he asked.

John gave Paxton a cold stare, not buying the friendly act.

"This body here is the one who hurt your daughter. An autopsy might give us some answers. I assume this body is important to you?" John said.

Paxton glanced at the body, his hand tightening in his pocket.

'The real culprit's already dead. This guy got off too easy! He should've been alive to suffer,' Paxton fumed internally.

"Yes, Mr. Williams, this body is important to me. But why did you stop my men from taking it? Are you planning to investigate the guy who hurt my daughter too?" Paxton asked, still smiling.

"I don't know your daughter," John replied coolly.

Paxton felt a twinge of anxiety. He had a hunch John's questions were about the explosion.

And he was right.

John's eyes flashed with anger. "When Bianca and I were at that banquet, there was a car explosion. Was that your doing?" he demanded.

Paxton wasn't about to admit to anything.

"Mr. Williams, I don't know why you'd think that. Everyone knows the Brown Family is the weakest of the four major families, while your Williams Family is the strongest. Why would I pick a fight with you?" Paxton said, shaking his head like it was a bad joke.

John cut to the chase. "Bianca once planned to kidnap Isabella with your daughter. You aware of that?" he asked bluntly.

Paxton's eyes flickered. He knew about it, but he wasn't admitting anything.

"My daughter follows the law. She wouldn't be involved in a kidnapping," Paxton denied calmly.

"Cut the act. You were really after Bianca, weren't you?" John pressed.

"Enough!" Paxton snapped, his face darkening. "How many times do I have to say it? I had nothing to do with that car explosion-nothing! And leave my daughter out of this. You think I'm not upset enough?" He ran a hand through his hair in frustration. "All I want is to find out what really happened to her. If you want to keep suspecting me, fine, go ahead!"

Paxton's outburst made John hesitate.

John had no proof that Paxton was behind the explosion, and Paxton's reaction seemed genuine. This left John in a tough spot. Had he and Bianca been wrong?

But Paxton wasn't lying. He had nothing to do with the explosion and didn't even know about it when it happened. The real mastermind was his wife, Zoey. What did it have to do with him?

###chapter 425 Autopsy

John had no clue Paxton was playing word games with him, but he wasn't one to trust easily either.

"Mr. Williams, can I take the body now?" Paxton asked after John stayed quiet for a bit.

John nodded, but Paxton didn't look happy. What John said next really ticked him off.

"You can have the body, but I need to be part of the autopsy. I need to find out who's behind this," John said calmly.

Paxton's face flashed with anger. "John, you're pushing it! If you think I caused the explosion last time, go ahead and investigate! I'm taking this body to find out who hurt my daughter! This has nothing to do with you."

"Just because you say it has nothing to do with you, does it really mean it doesn't? My girlfriend and your daughter are in this together. What's wrong with me caring about your daughter for my girlfriend's sake? Or have you already decided Bianca hurt your daughter?" John asked coldly.

John had a hunch about Paxton's thoughts. Paxton still had his doubts about Bianca.

"What if I don't agree?" Paxton asked, looking grim.

"Then you can't take the body!" John shot back, just as cold. He needed to be involved to clear Bianca's name.

All the henchmen behind John and Paxton stood up. The air was thick with tension, like a fight could break out any second.

A police car was parked a few hundred feet away from the dock. Two cops leaned against the car, watching through binoculars and sipping hot coffee.

"Looks like they're about to throw down. Shouldn't we step in?" one cop asked.

The other cop took a sip of his coffee and grinned. "What fight? We didn't see anything. We're just on patrol, feeling a bit chilly, so we got out for some coffee."

"Is this really okay?" the first cop asked with a wry smile.

The coffee-drinking cop sighed. "Buddy, you gotta get it. Our gear was bought with money from the big four families. We can't afford to piss them off. This is their beef. We just watch. As long as no civilians get hurt, we stay out of it!"

Before Paxton showed up, things were already tense at the dock. Passersby called the cops, but when they found out it involved the big four families, they left and sent two officers to keep an eye on things.

"Our job is to keep civilians away from this mess. Our guns are no match for them," the coffee-drinking cop shrugged and, feeling a bit cold, got back in the car.

The other cop sighed and got in too.

It was a rough situation.

Back at the dock, Paxton and John were still facing off, their henchmen ready to pounce.

Just as things were about to explode, Paxton suddenly waved his hand.

"Fine, you can be involved! I'll share the autopsy report with you, but stay out of my plans for the culprit," Paxton said coldly.

John nodded, a smile spreading across his face. "Alright, since we're on the same page, let's get the police to take the body."

He told his guys to call the cops. They showed up pretty quick, took the body, and set up the forensic exam.

The autopsy was gonna take a while. John and Paxton didn't need to hang around the station, so they left their men there to keep an eye on things and let them know when the report was ready.

Back at the winery, John met up with Bianca.

He filled her in on the deal with Paxton.

John hugged her tight and sighed. "I know you didn't do this, but I need to make sure no one points the finger at you."

"Thanks, babe. The truth will come out and clear my name," Bianca said, nodding. She knew she was innocent.

Meanwhile, Michael got wind of what was going on.

"John and Paxton teaming up for the autopsy? Paxton must be losing his mind with suspicion," Michael said with a cold smile.

Paxton still had his doubts about Bianca. He only agreed to work with John because he had no choice, and he was definitely not happy about it.

Mike was on the phone with Michael, who had been handling this whole mess.

"Mr. Williams, why aren't we still blaming Bianca and instead shifting it to Joseph?" Mike asked, confused.

Michael sighed. "As long as Bianca's backers stay hidden, Paxton won't find anything. Since her dad died, we've lost track of those guys. This might flush them out."

"Are you saying they might frame Mrs. Williams?" Mike asked, surprised.

Michael nodded. "If I were them, I'd do it. But I don't get why they're targeting Isabella. This might be our chance. Plus, I don't want my nephew caught in another explosion; he's my uncle's only grandson."

Michael sounded a bit helpless. Even though he and John weren't super close, Kenna still cared about family. If Mason heard John was dead, he'd be heartbroken, and Kenna didn't want that.

Mike got where Michael was coming from. No one knew if Paxton would go after John too. As for Joseph, he was just a rival in love, so if he died, it wasn't a big deal.

"Yeah, once the autopsy report is out, they'll find that place, so Joe should be ready to show up," Michael said.

Mike nodded. "I've already told Joe, and he's ready. Also, Joe asked where you got the medicine you've been taking?"

Michael's face tightened. He asked calmly, "How does Joe know I've been taking medicine?"

"He said Jerry told him," Mike replied.

Michael smiled and gave Mike the pharmacy address, then hung up.

Jerry, who was busy with work, suddenly felt a chill run down his spine, like he was being watched by something scary.

###chapter 426  Determining the Mine Site

John filled Bianca in on his project with Paxton. While he was in the shower, Bianca pulled out her secret phone.

She dialed a number and spilled everything John had just told her.

"Well, I see. I've set up a fake diary. When Paxton digs into it, he'll find it and think Isabella brought the killer into the country," the guy on the other end laughed darkly.

Bianca raised an eyebrow and asked, "How can you be so sure Paxton will buy that the fake diary is legit?"

The guy on the phone replied coolly, "Mix a little lie with a lot of truth. Paxton will fall for it."

Bianca hesitated. The rumored diary listed all the illegal contacts for getting people out of the country. If he really wanted to add Isabella's info, he'd need a ton of real data on those shady characters.

"How'd you get all that info on the illegal contacts?" Bianca asked, curious.

The guy went quiet for a moment before snapping, "Don't push it. That's not something you need to know. I have my ways."

Rolling her eyes, Bianca said, "I was just curious. No need to get all secretive."

"Curiosity killed the cat. And cats have nine lives. You only have one. Got it?" he said coldly.

Bianca felt a surge of anger. She had a lot of nasty things she wanted to say, but with her mom in his grip, she had to keep it together.

After he hung up, Bianca hid her phone again.

Just then, John came out of the bathroom, towel-drying his hair, looking at Bianca with a puzzled expression.

"I thought I heard you talking to someone while I was in there. Did I imagine it?" John asked, confused.

Bianca's eyes flashed with panic, but she quickly composed herself.

"I was talking to someone-our baby," Bianca said, sitting on the bed and gently rubbing her belly.

"I told the baby he's going to grow up to be amazing, just like his dad," Bianca smiled at John.

John grinned, sitting next to her and touching her belly gently.

"Hey, little one, did you hear what your mom said? She thinks I'm great, and a great man doesn't let his family suffer. You'll be safe and healthy," John said, looking at Bianca lovingly.

Bianca gazed at John with affection. No matter how twisted her plans were, one thing was true: she really loved John.

The next day, after Isabella went to work, Michael called Carol.

Carol got a call from a number she didn't recognize. Confused, she was taken aback by the voice on the other end.

"Joe said you were looking for me? Got something to discuss?" Michael asked, sounding calm.

Carol swallowed hard. Even over the phone, his presence was intimidating, like a lion surveying its territory.

Though the beast didn't roar, its steady gaze made Carol feel the pressure.

She pulled herself together and asked, "Who are you?"

"Knowing my identity won't help you. Just know we're on the same team now," Michael said coolly, hinting at their shared goal of helping Isabella revive the family.

Carol took a deep breath. "I can help you reach the Taylor Family members under the Brown Family's thumb, but I need to see some sincerity. We have our own plans, and you can't interfere. You need to back off immediately."

Michael nodded, "I can do that. But after I show my sincerity, what about yours?"

Carol hesitated. Did they really need to prove themselves more? She'd already helped Isabella take over the company; wasn't that enough?

Michael smirked, a hint of mockery in his smile. "I know you're loyal to Isabella. But the others? Those Taylor folks working with the Browns?" He shook his head. "I can't be sure where their true loyalties lie anymore. People can be bought, Carol. Money changes hearts."

Silence hung on the line as Carol pondered his words.

"We can give you some intel on the senior members of the Brown Family. That's the best we can offer," Carol finally said, revealing their bargaining chip.

Michael raised an eyebrow. Carol's willingness to share info on the Brown Family's top brass showed just how deep their infiltration went and how powerful they were.

"Alright then, let's work together. To avoid any mix-ups, I'll have Joe pass on any messages to you," Michael said before hanging up and calling Jerry to start pulling their people out.

Jerry got the message and began making arrangements.

Not long after, Carol got feedback from her colleagues. All the unfamiliar faces at the Brown Family company had vanished.

Carol was blown away by Michael's efficiency. It made her a bit worried and cautious. She could only hope everything was truly for Isabella, as Joe had said.

Carol sent the info she'd gathered to Joe.

Joe passed it on to Michael. Soon after, Michael messaged Joe, telling him to get ready to head to the mine.

###chapter 427 Autopsy Report

Outside the police station's forensic lab, two groups of guys were eyeing each other down in the hallway. On one side, you had Paxton's crew, and on the other, John's.

These two groups had already thrown down before, leaving both sides with some bruises and a lot of bad blood. They were practically glaring holes into each other.

If John hadn't warned his guys to keep it cool at the station, they probably would've already found an excuse to throw punches.

"What are you staring at?" one of John's guys snapped.

Paxton's guy shot back with a smirk, "Got a problem with that?"

"Try looking at me again!" John's guy said, rolling up his sleeves to show off his tattooed arms.

"Oh, I really wanna see what you think you can do," Paxton's guy said, puffing out his chest.

Both sides started to stand up, ready to throw down.

Just as things were about to get ugly, the sound of footsteps echoed down the hall.

The police chief, Alan, strolled over with his hands behind his back.

Seeing Alan, both groups took a step back. Even though they didn't think much of the cops, they knew better than to mess with the chief.

With a stern look, Alan said, "Your bosses told you not to cause trouble here. I suggest you listen. This is a police station, and any fighting here will make us look bad."

The guys from both sides looked a bit sheepish and mumbled apologies.

They might be tough, but they weren't stupid. Neither Paxton nor John would want to piss off the police chief over a petty fight.

Alan nodded, satisfied, and walked into the lab. The forensic exam was just wrapping up.

The forensic examiner took off his mask and gloves and handed a report to Alan.

"Mr. Savage, based on my examination, this body matches the notorious serial killer Avalonia. The bone age, dental marks, and tattoos all line up with the data Officer Pena sent over," the examiner said.

Alan nodded; he had a hunch this was the case.

"How did he die?" Alan asked.

"He was shot in the head, no other major injuries. Looks like someone took him out cleanly," the examiner said, pulling out an evidence bag.

"I found some stone fragments on him. My research suggests these are coal mine stones," the examiner said, handing Alan the bag of small black stones and debris.

"Why would he have these? Was he hiding in a mine or something?" Alan asked.

The examiner nodded and pulled up a map on his phone, pointing to a spot. "There's a small coal mine on the outskirts."

Alan gave the forensic examiner a satisfied pat on the shoulder and handed the autopsy report back. "Print me two copies of these reports."

The forensic examiner nodded, knowing Alan planned to give the reports to Paxton and John.

A few minutes later, Alan walked out of the lab with two reports in hand. "Here are the autopsy reports. Take them to your bosses," he said, handing the reports to the henchmen.

The henchmen quickly pulled out their phones and called John and Paxton.

As soon as they got the message, John and Paxton rounded up their guys and headed straight for the mine.

Both groups left the police station and made their way to the mine.

Watching them leave, Alan let out a sigh of relief. "Finally, some peace and quiet around here."

Then it hit him, and he slapped his forehead. "Damn it, I need to send people to follow them, make sure they don't cause trouble for the workers at the mine."

Alan had to gather a team and send them to the mine.

Paxton and John arrived at the mine at the same time.

They got out of their cars, exchanged a quick glance, and then got down to business, arranging their men to surround the area.

This was a small open-pit coal mine, and the person in charge wasn't connected to the four major families. The mine's low output hadn't caught their attention before.

It was nighttime, and the coal miners were resting. The sudden commotion woke a lot of them up.

Some miners, annoyed, got ready to go outside and see what was going on. But when they saw the tough-looking guys with guns, they decided to stay put.

The noise soon alerted the mine's boss.

The boss, a short and chubby middle-aged man named Gareth Bishop, started sweating nervously when he heard that reps from the four major families had shown up. He was worried he might have done something to piss them off.

"Is there something I can help you with, Mr. Brown and Mr. Williams?" Gareth asked nervously.

Paxton pulled out a photo of the serial killer and asked, "Do you know this guy?"

Gareth looked at the photo and shook his head. "I don't know him. We have a lot of workers here; I can't possibly know them all."

Gareth was telling the truth. But he knew there had to be something up with the guy in the photo, so he gathered all the workers to see if anyone recognized him. Soon, they had a lead.

One worker said, "This guy used to live in a house not far from the mine. It was an old junk room, but I haven't seen him in a while. A few days ago, when we passed by there to use the restroom, it looked like someone else had moved in."

Guided by that worker, Paxton and John led their crew to a wooden house near the cliff.

When they got there, they came face to face with someone coming out.

"Joe? So you've been hiding here!" John shouted angrily.

###chapter 428 Four Diaries

Joe shot John a quick glance, then slammed the door shut with a smirk.

"Open this damn door!" John bellowed.

Joe had really pissed John off before because of Jasper, and now John was out for blood. He finally had Joe cornered.

John's crew started pounding on the door, kicking and ramming it like madmen, making the whole thing shake.

Paxton stood back, watching. He knew if Joe was here, so was that diary. And that diary had the goods on bringing the criminal back to the country.

Finally, Paxton's guys managed to bust down the flimsy wooden door, but to their shock, there was an open window in the house.

Joe was outside, backpack slung over his shoulder, waving. "See ya, Mr. Williams. Got a little present for you."

With a wicked grin, Joe pulled out a lighter and tossed it through the window.

John's crew caught a whiff of gasoline and their faces went pale. They yanked John out of the house in a hurry.

Just as they got clear, flames erupted, smoke billowing out of every crack.

Paxton started to freak out. He needed that diary.

"Get in there and find anything useful!" Paxton barked at his men.

But they hesitated, staring at the raging fire. Charging in now was a death wish.

John sneered at Paxton's crew and waved his hand. "Get in there and find the diary."

Without a second thought, John's guys dove into the flames.

Paxton glared at his men. "Whoever finds the diary gets a million bucks."

That did the trick. Paxton's guys sprang into action, even more determined than John's.

Screams echoed from inside, and some couldn't take the heat, bolting out of the house.

As more and more people fled, both John and Paxton started to lose hope.

Then, out of nowhere, someone burst from the flames clutching a diary, shouting, "I got it! I finally got it!"

John and Paxton's eyes lit up, and they both rushed towards the guy. His face was so blackened by the fire, they couldn't tell whose side he was on.

The guy looked at both of them, then headed straight for Paxton, handing over the diary.

John clenched his teeth in fury. Paxton, on the other hand, grinned like a Cheshire cat as he took the diary.

John watched Paxton's smug grin, a slight smirk forming on his own lips.

Just then, another guy burst out of the burning house.

"I found the diary!" he shouted, beaming.

Paxton's smile vanished.

The guy handed the diary to Paxton, eyes gleaming with expectation.

Paxton blinked, confused by the two identical diaries. "Did Zane have a bunch of diaries?"

The two guys who brought out the diaries glared at each other, both hungry for that $1 million reward.

"Maybe Zane's been keeping diaries for years," one of Paxton's men suggested.

Paxton nodded, thinking that made sense. He shot a smug look at John and patted the two guys on the back.

"Good job, both of you get $1 million," Paxton announced.

The two guys grinned from ear to ear.

Then, another person came running out, also holding a diary.

"Mr. Brown, I found the diary," the guy said, looking confused at the two diaries in Paxton's hands.

Paxton's face darkened. He was starting to feel like he was being played.

John seemed to catch on and smirked at Paxton. "Congrats, Mr. Brown. Looks like you found the diary from two years ago."

Paxton shot John a deadly glare, then snatched the third diary from his guy.

He flipped through it and saw it was similar to the others. All three diaries were from the same year, but which one was the real deal?

"Think there's a fourth diary?" John taunted.

"Mr. Williams, I found the diary!" one of John's men shouted, running out with yet another diary.

John's smile froze, his lips twitching as he took the diary.

He looked at the diary in his hand, then at Paxton's, realizing they all looked the same.

John's face darkened. They'd both been duped.

As John flipped through the diary, he searched anxiously for clues about the serial killer. He dreaded seeing Bianca's name, even though he suspected she was being framed.

Finally, he found the name of the serial killer. But when he saw the info about the intermediary who brought the killer back to the country, he was stunned.

"Joseph? How could it be him? Could Isabella be right-was this all orchestrated by the other two major families?" John thought, his brow furrowing deeply.

###chapter 429 Four Goals

Paxton noticed John's face change, and his curiosity piqued.

What Paxton didn't see coming was that John was also questioning the diary's authenticity.

"Could it really be Joseph? He doesn't seem like the type! Is he a gentleman on the outside but a total creep underneath?" The more John thought about it, the more uneasy he got.

Whether it was Joseph or his family, even Joseph's dad, Richard, they all seemed pretty low-key and steady, treating everyone kindly. Could the whole family be a bunch of undercover weirdos?

John couldn't wrap his head around it, but then he felt a light poke. Frowning, he looked over and saw one of his guys pointing at Paxton.

John turned and saw Paxton on his tiptoes, trying to sneak a peek at the diary.

John smirked and shut the diary. Paxton looked less like the head of a big family and more like a kid trying to cheat on a test.

Paxton was just about to see what was in John's diary when John snapped it shut, leaving him frustrated.

"Mr. Williams, you know how important that notebook is to me. Name your price. How much for the diary?" Paxton asked coldly.

John sneered, "What? Another million bucks? Do you think I need it? Do you remember how you and the other two families tried to screw me over?"

Paxton shot back, standing with his hands behind his back, staring at John. "You know this was a plot by the three major families, not just me. The Brown Family's status isn't on par with yours. Go to the Davis Family and the Larson Family for this."

John clapped his hands, mocking Paxton. "You're really something. Do you think I don't know you teamed up with the Davis Family and the Larson Family to target me? Are you trying to weasel out of this?"

Paxton glared at John, raised his hand slightly, and all his henchmen behind him loaded their guns, aiming at John.

John's guys shielded him and raised their guns too.

The situation between the two sides went south again. The already shaky cooperation fell apart instantly.

"Mr. Williams, you should know that the game between the major families isn't that simple. You should understand why we're stopping you. I won't waste more words. Will you hand over the diary for 10 million dollars?" Paxton's voice was cold and indifferent.

"You think you can scare me?" John sneered, though he couldn't help but glance at his right-hand man nearby.

This guy knew John well and got the message right away. John didn't really want to argue with Paxton over this, but he had to make a stand to get Paxton to back down.

The subordinate immediately shouted, "Mr. Williams, let's all chill out. Mr. Brown is just trying to get justice for his daughter. Soon you'll be a dad too, so you should get where he's coming from. Why don't we all sit down and talk this out like fathers?"

Paxton glanced at the guy who spoke, a hint of approval in his eyes. This guy was pretty smooth, but too bad he wasn't on his team.

John hesitated for a moment, looking somewhat convinced by his subordinate.

"What kind of person do you take me for?" John sneered. "As if I couldn't afford a measly million dollars."

The subordinate's eyes lit up. He turned to Paxton and shouted, "Mr. Brown, we get it, but the diary was saved by our guy from the fire. Asking for 10 million dollars doesn't really match Mr. Williams' status."

Paxton figured out that John's goal was to make him yield, to get back at him for the past actions of the three major families.

Paxton didn't mind. He asked loudly, "Mr. Williams, how much money do you want?"

John looked at the subordinate who had saved the diary from the fire.

The subordinate hesitated for a moment, then extended five fingers.

Paxton glanced at the man's hand and shouted, "Alright, let's make it 50 million dollars! I'll transfer the money now, you give me the diary."

Paxton took out a check, filled in a number, and had someone deliver it to John.

John looked at the check, raised an eyebrow, and handed it to the subordinate.

The subordinate swallowed nervously, with a hint of confusion in his eyes. He had only wanted to add 5 million dollars. He didn't expect Paxton to raise the price directly to 50 million dollars. This was an unexpected surprise.

Paxton watched John's actions with a hint of dissatisfaction. John handed the check to the subordinate in front of him, indicating that he didn't care about the 50 million dollars. It was just pocket money to reward the subordinate.

'Just a flower grown in a greenhouse, without experiencing any storms, thinking that this way can provoke me? Simply foolish.' Paxton mocked John's actions in his mind.

John handed the diary to Paxton.

Paxton took the diary, a hint of surprise in his eyes.

Neither Paxton nor John left. They waited quietly until the cabin was completely burned down. They had people search for a while but found no trace of any papers; everything had been burned.

Seeing that nothing useful could be found, Paxton directly returned with his subordinates and the diary.

After Paxton left, John looked at the subordinate who received the money. "Hand over the 50 million dollars, that money is too much, I have other uses for it. I'll give you 1 million dollars as a reward."

###chapter 430 Locking the Target

John's crew reluctantly handed the check back to him.

Poor check, didn't even get a chance to warm up in the pocket.

Going from 50 million bucks to just 1 million? No one's gonna be thrilled about that.

John didn't give a damn about his crew's grumbling. If he hadn't made that bet with Mason, he'd still be the Williams Family heir, swimming in cash. Fifty million would've been pocket change.

But now, John had to cough up ten percent of his assets to Mason. Sure, he still had plenty left, but 50 million was no joke. Plus, he'd already blown 100 million on Estella's endorsement.

To top it off, thanks to Bianca, his whole clothing company was in shambles. Even though he brought in PR to patch things up, it was gonna take a while to bounce back. That 100 million? Down the drain. And with the Olympic projects needing funds, John was seriously strapped for cash.

John stuffed the 50 million dollar check in his pocket, scribbled out a 1 million dollar check, and handed it to his crew. Then he and his team bounced from the coal mine.

As they were leaving, John asked if anyone had seen Joe. He hadn't forgotten that jerk who nearly roasted him alive with a lighter.

But with all the flames and smoke, no one had a clue where Joe went. John figured Joe must've jumped off the cliff, but he was sure the guy had a plan.

Just like John thought, they found witnesses who saw a big parachute coming down from the cliff. Probably Joe. The backpack he had must've been the parachute.

John kept hunting for Joe, knowing their beef was only gonna get worse.

Meanwhile, Paxton, after heading out with his crew, went straight home to check out the 4 diaries.

Paxton cracked open the diaries, zeroing in on the folks who brought in the serial killer.

Isabella, Joseph, Colin Brown, Kurt Lowe?

"Seriously? A serial killer with four middlemen? They're playing me for a fool." Paxton laughed, more pissed than amused.

Paxton wasn't dumb. Out of these 4 diaries, maybe one was real, or they were all fake, with the real one already torched. Someone wanted to use Paxton to take out the people listed.

Isabella's name in the diary could be real or a setup by Bianca. Their beef was no secret. One of John's guys was at the fire today, maybe planted there by John.

Joseph's name could be there to stir up trouble between the Davis Family and Mason. Or it could be John's ploy to pit the Brown Family against the Davis Family.

Colin, a Brown Family member, controlled some of the family's resources. If Paxton bit the dust, Colin would be the top contender to take over. If Paxton lost it over Pearl and pissed off the other families, Colin could push him out as family head. John might be trying to spark a family feud within the Browns.As for the last name, Kurt, nobody had a clue who this guy was. None of the big four families had anyone by that name; it seemed totally made up.

Paxton put down the diaries and let out a deep sigh, his eyes showing just how tired he was. He rubbed his forehead, feeling like a dad trying to get justice for his daughter, but someone was playing him.

Paxton slammed the table, his eyes blazing with anger.

Honestly, checking if the diaries were legit was pretty straightforward. They had records of other illegal immigrants and middlemen. By comparing those, he could figure out if the diaries were real.

Paxton snapped some pics of each diary's contents and sent them to different subordinates to investigate.

After handing out the tasks, Paxton called Pearl's doctor, Allan Jennings.

"Doc, I need to know how stable my daughter's emotions are right now. Can I talk to her?" Paxton asked over the phone.

Pearl could hear external sounds through a cochlear implant, but her mental state was so fragile that she could easily break down. Paxton had been hesitant to ask her about the killer.

Allan hesitated and said, "Pearl's condition has improved a lot, but there's still a risk of her losing control. My advice is to wait another year."

"I can't wait any longer. Please set it up for next week. I have some questions for her." Paxton clenched his fist, his eyes fierce.

Allan sighed and agreed.

After hanging up, Paxton contacted his subordinates again. He gave them just a week to verify the diaries' authenticity.

The subordinates could hear the anger in Paxton's voice and pulled out all the stops to gather information. They reported back before the week was up.

Paxton looked at the summarized info in his hand, a hint of mockery in his eyes.

"These guys have really outdone themselves," Paxton smirked.

Three out of the four diaries turned out to be real. The illegal immigrants and middlemen matched the contents.

These guys who faked evidence, if the info they found was handed over to the cops, they'd probably get a medal for being outstanding citizens.

Paxton wasn't dumb and knew how crucial it was to hide one percent of false info among ninety-nine percent of true info.

What Paxton didn't expect was that there were actually idiots who prepared 100% fake info.

The diary mentioning Kurt's name was a total fake, with not a single piece of matching info.

Paxton remembered who had brought out this diary. He directly interrogated the guy and quickly got an answer that made him both angry and amused.

This diary was actually cooked up by a member of the Brown Family. These scaredy-cats were worried Paxton would pick a fight with someone he couldn't handle, so they forged a diary and made up a name.

They thought they had pulled it off, but the subordinate who was supposed to plant the diary at the scene, upon hearing that Paxton was offering a 1 million dollar reward, greedily brought the diary back out.

###chapter 431 Interrogation

After figuring out where the fourth diary came from, Paxton felt totally lost. To him, these so-called family members were just like parasites, no real family bond at all.

"Since you didn't die in the fire, I'll finish what you started," Paxton muttered, tying up his lying subordinate and soaking him in gasoline. He struck a match. The poor guy's screams echoed as the flames lit up Paxton's face, the heat doing nothing to melt the ice in his eyes.

Now, Paxton had three more diaries. He could only hope the truth was in one of them. He needed to know which one was the real deal.

To figure out if the diaries were legit, besides Joe, maybe only Francis could help.

Since Paxton's goons caught him, Francis had been locked up. They hadn't beaten him or anything because he gave them some important clues. But Francis was always a bit scared because he had made up all the stuff in the diaries. He didn't even know if such a diary existed.

The only thing Francis did right was that his confession helped some people escape the country illegally without getting caught by Paxton's men. The survivors were grateful to Francis, the unlucky guy. As for those who died, they were probably cursing Paxton and wondering why Francis didn't speak up sooner.

Francis was tied up, with a rope around his neck to keep him from escaping.

Even though he was treated like a tied-up stray dog, at least they fed him every day. It was just fast food, but hey, he was still alive.

One day, Francis got a sandwich. He had just unwrapped it and was about to take a bite when he heard hurried footsteps outside.

He froze. The next moment, the door burst open, and a bunch of guys rushed in, untying the rope around his neck.

"What are you doing? Are you letting me go?" Francis asked, his voice full of hope.

"Mr. Brown wants to see you. Whether you live or die depends on him," one of the guys said with a cold, grim smile.

Francis suddenly felt his legs go weak, almost collapsing. They had to drag him out of the room.

Francis wasn't stupid. He knew Paxton wanting to see him out of the blue was bad news. Most likely, his lies had been found out.

"I'm not going. I don't want to see Paxton. I'm fine staying here. I'm scared to see him. I don't want to go," Francis cried, clinging to the doorframe, refusing to leave.

The thugs pulled and yanked at him, but he wouldn't budge. One of them kicked his arm hard, the pain making him let go.

"If you don't come with us, you'll die right here," one thug threatened, his voice menacing.

Francis turned pale with fear and shut up.

They shoved him into a car. As it bumped along the road, he closed his eyes in despair, silently counting down the moments of his life.

Francis had no clue how many turns the car took or how far they had gone. He was barely conscious, slumped weakly against the seat.

It wasn't death that scared him the most; it was knowing he was about to die.

The car finally stopped at a steel mill.

The door opened, and Francis was yanked out.

Since he could barely walk, two thugs grabbed his arms and dragged him inside.

The machines in the steel mill were roaring, and the heat was intense. One furnace was blazing, molten steel flowing inside.

Paxton stood in front of the furnace, his back to Francis, lost in thought.

Francis was thrown to the ground behind him.

He looked up nervously at Paxton's back.

Paxton turned around, his face calm and unreadable.

"I heard you didn't want to see me. Why?" Paxton asked, his voice steady.

Francis shook his head frantically. "No, that's not it. I just... I just feel nervous."

Seeing the coldness in Paxton's eyes grow, Francis shrank back in fear.

Paxton didn't ask any more questions. He turned to his subordinate and waved his hand. Four diaries were tossed in front of Francis.

Francis stared at the diaries, stunned.

Paxton looked down at him. "I've found the diaries you mentioned, but I don't know which one is real. Now, tell me which one is true!"

Francis trembled. The diaries were just lies he had made up to buy time. He never thought there would be actual diaries.

Seeing Francis hesitate, Paxton snapped, "I don't have time for this. Tell me which one is real!"

Swallowing hard, Francis, with shaking hands, opened one of the diaries.

'Thank God I remember Zane's handwriting. If it matches, I should know which one is real,' Francis thought, feeling a glimmer of hope.

As he flipped through the first diary, a spark of excitement flashed in his eyes; the handwriting was almost identical to Zane's.

Paxton noticed and pointed to the other three diaries. "Are you sure it's this one? What about the others?"

Francis hesitated, then started to look through the other diaries. Sweat dripped from his forehead; the handwriting in the other diaries was almost the same. It seemed like all the diaries had Zane's handwriting.

'Why is all the handwriting the same? Did Zane write diaries for four years? No, the dates are the same too. Could three of them be fake?' Francis's mind raced.

In reality, even without the love poems provided by Joe, Michael and the others could have found Zane's handwriting with a bit of effort. John, Bianca, the masterminds behind the scenes, and the members of the Brown Family had all figured it out this way.

"Which one is it?" Paxton demanded coldly.

'Damn it, I'll just pick one. Paxton won't know the truth anyway,' Francis thought, choosing one of the diaries.

###chapter 432 The Crazy Father

Francis noticed Paxton suddenly shut his eyes after he picked that diary.

"Did I make the right call?" Francis thought, feeling a bit smug.

"You sure it's this one?" Paxton asked, a faint smile playing on his lips.

Francis nodded eagerly. "Yeah, I'm positive. I remember it clearly."

Paxton grabbed the diary, flipped through it nonchalantly, and then tossed it straight into the furnace with a grin.

Flames roared up, and the diary turned to ashes.

Francis's smile vanished, and a sense of dread washed over him. Maybe he picked the wrong one.

"Wait, Mr. Brown, I think I messed up. It should be this one," Francis said, grabbing another diary, trying to look apologetic.

But Paxton's smile faded, and his face turned icy. He glared at Francis with a murderous look.

"There were never any diaries, were there? You were just playing me," Paxton said, staring Francis down.

Francis panicked, shaking his head frantically. "No, there are diaries, I swear."

Paxton closed his eyes and sighed deeply. "At first, when I heard about the diaries, I was thrilled. I thought I finally had a lead on avenging my daughter. But then I started to doubt if they even existed. I searched with doubt until I saw the first diary."

Paxton opened his eyes, his voice as cold as a winter wind, sending chills down Francis's spine.

"But when my guys brought out the second, third, and fourth diaries from that burning house, I knew I was being played," Paxton said, his voice laced with barely contained rage.

Paxton's men sensed what was coming and quickly pinned Francis to the ground.

"It wasn't me, I didn't deceive you, really, there are diaries, please," Francis begged, tears streaming down his face. He'd rather be shot than endure torture.

"I just wanted to avenge my daughter. Why do all of you want to use me? You're exploiting a father's love for his daughter, twisting a father's hatred! Why? Why did you do this?" Paxton roared.

Paxton kicked Francis in the head, over and over, shouting.

"Why is everyone-John, Michael, Isabella, Bianca, and the rest of the family-targeting me? Am I a fool? I just wanted to avenge my daughter! But you're all playing me! Why is this happening?" Paxton's kicks grew more brutal, and Francis's face was a bloody mess.

"I really didn't lie to you, please don't kill me," Francis managed to say.

Feeling drained, Paxton finally stopped."You know, I still had a sliver of hope. That obviously fake diary was set up by my family. They were worried I'd stir up trouble with enemies I couldn't handle, so they made up a name to throw me off. But I figured it out. I kept that fake diary on purpose, hoping you wouldn't pick it. That would've at least meant the other three were legit. But you went and chose the one dead end!" Paxton said coldly, raising his hand.

Francis felt a wave of fear. He couldn't believe his luck was this bad. A twenty-five percent chance, and he picked the wrong one. If he'd chosen any other, he might've made it out alive.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Brown, I just want to live. Honestly, I don't even know if that psycho killer really used our channels. Your guys have killed so many people, I'm terrified. I just want to live, please," Francis cried, looking at Paxton with pleading eyes.

Paxton smiled and pulled out a handkerchief, wiping the blood off his shoes.

After cleaning up, Paxton stuffed the blood-stained handkerchief into Francis's pocket. "You know what? I was planning to make you suffer like my daughter did, to let you feel her pain."

Francis trembled with fear. Everyone in the city knew the horror Paxton's daughter had gone through, and he didn't want to end up like that. It was too terrifying.

"No, please, don't do this. Just kill me, give me a bullet, let me go quickly," Francis begged, hoping Paxton would either spare him or give him a quick death.

What Paxton said next gave Francis a glimmer of hope.

"But in the end, I changed my mind. I shouldn't make you suffer like my daughter, because that would remind me of her pain. As a dad, I can't bear to see that," Paxton sighed deeply.

"Yes, you're a kind dad, and if you want, I can call you dad too," Francis said eagerly.

Paxton smiled at Francis. "I don't have a son like you. Even though I don't want to make you suffer like my daughter, I've thought of other ways. Like this..."

Paxton pointed to the huge furnace behind him. Francis's heart, which had just started to calm down, began to race again.

"You're not thinking of throwing me in there, are you? Mr. Brown, please don't," Francis forced out a very ugly smile, hoping Paxton was joking.

But Paxton's smile had completely vanished.

"Throw him in," Paxton ordered, and his men immediately dragged Francis to the platform above the furnace.

"No, I don't want to die, please! I can work for you, I can do illegal stuff for you, whatever you want, please," Francis pleaded, but no one listened.

Realizing begging was useless, Francis started cursing at Paxton. "Paxton, you bastard, you're a demon! You'll go to hell after you die, just like your daughter! Wait for you and your daughter in hell."

"Get in there," Paxton's subordinate said, kicking Francis into the furnace.

###chapter 433 Pearl's Death

Francis let out a scream and tumbled off the platform into the furnace, sending molten iron splashing everywhere. His screams echoed, making Paxton's crew shiver.

Paxton stayed cool. "Alright, let's head to the hospital."

With that, Paxton turned and walked out, his crew trailing behind him.

Once they were gone, a shadowy figure emerged from the corner, grabbed the three diaries, and slipped out of the steel mill.

Paxton arrived at the hospital and made a beeline for the ICU.

Pearl's doctor, Allan, was already there waiting for him.

"Mr. Brown, are you sure about this? Ms. Brown's condition has just started to improve. With more treatment, she could get better," Allan tried to persuade him.

Paxton glanced through the glass at Pearl, a flicker of pain in his eyes quickly replaced by a steely resolve.

"Your idea of improvement is just that she hasn't had another breakdown. It doesn't mean she's accepted her situation," Paxton said coldly, his voice devoid of any warmth.

Allan took a step back, sensing Paxton was about to do something drastic.

Paxton looked at Pearl lying in the hospital bed and said, "My daughter cares a lot about her looks. If she ever realizes what she's become, she'd rather die. Maybe I should help her with that. But first, I need to find out who did this to her."

With that, Paxton pushed open the ICU door and walked in, not bothering with protective gear.

Allan was stunned. It seemed Paxton was determined to end Pearl's life today. He wanted to intervene but was stopped by one of Paxton's men.

"Doc, maybe you have a conscience, but please respect the wishes of the patient and her family. And think about your own safety," one of Paxton's men warned.

Allan slowly calmed down. He couldn't bear to watch what was about to happen, so he turned away and closed his eyes.

Paxton reached Pearl's bedside. She still had a cochlear implant. Hearing the familiar footsteps, her body twitched.

"Pearl, it's Dad. I know you can hear me. I'm going to say some names, and if one of them hurt you, give me a sign," Paxton said. Pearl's body started to tremble.

"Was it Joseph who hurt you?" Paxton asked.

Pearl's trembling stayed the same. Disappointment flashed in Paxton's eyes. Joseph wasn't the one; he was innocent.

"Was it Bianca? Did she hurt you?" Paxton continued.

When Pearl heard Bianca's name, her trembling increased slightly, but Paxton could tell it was still within her tolerance.

A shadow crossed Paxton's face. Earlier, when Pearl heard Bianca's name, she had twisted violently. It seemed that with the new information and her emotional instability, Paxton had mistakenly thought Bianca was involved too.

"Looks like I was wrong about Bianca," Paxton muttered, then moved on to the next name.

"Was it Isabella who did this to you?" he asked. Pearl's body started shaking violently.

Paxton's brows knitted together. Pearl's reaction suggested Isabella was involved, but he knew Pearl's strong dislike for Isabella and couldn't tell if it was because Isabella had harmed her or just because of her hatred.

As Paxton's frown deepened, a thought struck him.

He recalled the news from a few days ago about Isabella cheating on Joseph, which had caused a stir in her endorsements. But soon after, it was revealed that Bianca was behind it, and even Joseph had come forward to explain.

'Why was Joseph's name in the diary? Could it be Isabella's mysterious husband?' Paxton's heart pounded as he realized they had all overlooked Isabella's mysterious husband. Finally, it clicked.

Paxton leaned in and whispered into Pearl's ear, "Did Isabella's husband do this to you?"

Pearl's body began to tremble violently, even twisting, and the monitors around her started blaring alarms.

The ICU was filled with the sound of alarms. Paxton was taken aback. From Pearl's reaction, it was clear that Isabella's husband was definitely the culprit.

"So it was him! It really was him! A man who even the four major families couldn't trace, how could he be just an ordinary office worker?" A crazed smile flashed in Paxton's eyes. Everything suddenly made sense.

But Pearl's condition was critical, teetering on the edge of life and death. Allan stood outside the ICU, torn between his duty to save a life and his uncertainty about what to do.

When Paxton finally walked out of the ICU, he calmly told Allan, "Save her. If you can, do it. If not, let her go peacefully."

Paxton waved his hand and sat down outside the ward.

With Paxton's command, Allan breathed a sigh of relief. He quickly led the nurses into the ICU to start treating Pearl.

While Pearl was being treated, Paxton pulled out his phone and called Zoey.

Zoey was out shopping with Estella when she got the call from Paxton, her brows furrowing.

"Why are you calling me now? Don't you know I'm out shopping with Ms. Foster?" Zoey's tone was annoyed, as their collaboration still needed Estella's involvement.

But when Zoey heard what Paxton said, her phone slipped from her hand in shock.

###chapter 434 Decision for Revenge

Estella had her eye on a piece of clothing and wanted to ask Zoey's opinion, but when she saw Zoey's panicked expression, she got curious.

"What's up, Zoey? Something wrong?" Estella asked, picking up Zoey's phone from the ground.

"My daughter's in trouble, she's in danger. I need to get to the hospital, like, right now." Zoey snatched the phone from Estella's hand and frantically tried to run outside.

Estella quickly caught up and grabbed the car keys from Zoey.

"You're too freaked out to drive. Let me take you. Just tell me where the hospital is," Estella said, looking at Zoey with genuine concern.

Zoey was too preoccupied to appreciate Estella's concern. She jumped into the passenger seat and gave Estella the hospital's address.

Estella started the car and sped towards the hospital.

She wasn't just being a good friend; she was also curious if there was any useful info she could get from this situation.

Following Zoey's directions, Estella ran several red lights, getting Zoey to the hospital as fast as possible.

Their high heels echoed in the hospital corridor.

Paxton, hearing the familiar sound of high heels, looked up and saw Zoey and Estella. He wasn't thrilled to see Estella because Pearl's situation was supposed to be kept quiet. But Pearl's condition was more important than worrying about Estella being there.

"How's Pearl? Wasn't she getting better? Why the sudden emergency?" Zoey rushed up to Paxton, bombarding him with questions.

Paxton glanced at Estella and stayed silent, gesturing towards the ward door.

"The doctors are in there working on her. You'll know more once they come out," Paxton said calmly.

Estella sensed Paxton was holding back because of her presence, hinting that whatever he wanted to say shouldn't be known by outsiders. This secret could be useful to Michael. Estella started thinking about how to get this info.

Zoey felt a surge of anger but knew she couldn't lose it now. She had to wait for news about Pearl.

Just then, the ICU door opened, and Allan walked out heavily.

Even with a mask on, the heaviness in his eyes showed his somber mood.

Zoey had a bad feeling. She hurried to the doctor and asked, "Doctor, how's my daughter?"

Allan sighed deeply. "Mrs. Brown, Mr. Brown, I'm sorry to inform you that Ms. Brown has just passed away. We did everything we could."

Before Allan could finish his sentence, Zoey's eyes rolled back, and she almost collapsed. Paxton, ready for this, caught her in his arms.

Tears streamed down Zoey's face as she wailed uncontrollably. "You said my daughter was getting better. How did it come to this? Why did she suddenly die? Is it because you're incompetent?"

With red, furious eyes, Zoey grabbed Allan by the collar and screamed, "You damn liar! Pearl's condition never improved, did it? You've been lying to us!"

"Mrs. Brown, please calm down. Ms. Brown's deterioration was beyond our control. We weren't lying to you," Allan said helplessly, looking towards Paxton for support.

"This isn't the doctor's fault; they did their best," Paxton said, stepping forward and gently pulling Zoey's hands away from Allan's collar.

Paxton waved his hand, signaling for Allan to leave quickly.

Allan sighed and left with the medical staff.

"Pearl, I raised her for so many years, and now she's gone!" Zoey cried as she rushed into the ward and collapsed on Pearl's body.

Pearl showed no signs of life. She lay there quietly, her severed limbs and bald head making it seem like she was just asleep.

"Wake up, Pearl. Look at me, I'm your mom. Please wake up," Zoey cried incessantly, her tears soaking Pearl's clothes.

But Pearl would never wake up again.

Feeling awkward, Estella hesitated outside the ICU, knowing this was a family moment, and she was an outsider.

Paxton noticed Estella's discomfort and said, "Ms. Foster, why don't you head back for now? This isn't the right place for you. I'll take care of my wife."

Estella nodded and left the ICU.

After Estella left, Paxton entered the room and stood beside Zoey.

"Why did Pearl die? Don't think I don't know. Allan looked at you-did you do something?" Zoey suddenly turned and glared at Paxton with hatred.

Paxton closed his eyes and nodded after a long pause. "Yes, I did. I asked her a few questions, and Pearl couldn't handle it, leading to her deterioration."

As soon as Paxton finished speaking, Zoey went wild, scratching at Paxton's face.

"You don't deserve to be a dad. Give me back my daughter, bring her back to life," Zoey screamed frantically.

Paxton frowned, grabbed Zoey's arm, and growled softly, "Now is not the time for this. Don't you want revenge?"

Zoey stared fiercely into Paxton's eyes and asked, "Do you know something? Do you know who the killer is?"

Paxton nodded. "It's Isabella and her husband. We misunderstood Bianca. She was only involved in the kidnapping case. Pearl's previous reactions were due to external stimuli. Now I need your help to avenge Pearl."

Zoey looked at Paxton, and after a moment, she nodded. "What do I need to do?"

Meanwhile, after leaving the hospital, Estella sneaked back in and went directly to find Allan, Pearl's attending physician.

###chapter 435 Playing Dumb Can Be Pretty Effective

Estella wandered around the hospital for a bit before finally tracking down Allan.

Allan was pretty surprised to see Estella. I mean, she was a big-time star now.

"Ms. Foster, what brings you here?" Allan asked, trying to be polite.

Estella got straight to the point, "I wanted to ask about Pearl."

Allan's eyes narrowed a bit. "Ms. Foster, even though Ms. Brown has passed away, we can't just share patient info with you."

Estella shook her head and put on her best sad face, "Doctor, you saw me with Mrs. Brown. You must know we're close friends. I'm heartbroken over what happened to her daughter. I may not be a mom, but I can imagine the pain of losing a child. I just want to know more about Ms. Brown's situation so I can help comfort my friend."

She looked at Allan with those pleading eyes.

Allan hesitated. Being stared at by a big star like that made him a bit flustered.

"Alright, since you're a friend of Mrs. Brown, I'll tell you a bit," Allan said, taking a deep breath to calm himself. Estella wasn't someone he wanted to cross.

"When you talk to Mrs. Brown, try not to bring up her husband too much. Mr. Brown's been awful, constantly grilling Ms. Brown about who caused her condition. I couldn't hear everything from outside the ward, but he must've mentioned a lot of names, which really stressed her out and made things worse," Allan sighed.

Estella's heart skipped a beat. She didn't expect Paxton to be behind this. He actually did that to Pearl.

"Thanks for telling me. I know how to comfort Mrs. Brown now. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone, especially not Paxton," Estella said sincerely.

Allan was touched. "Ms. Foster, you're really kind."

After talking to Estella, Allan felt a bit of regret. It seemed like she had him wrapped around her finger. If Paxton found out he spilled too much, he could be in trouble.

But Estella's promise reassured him. Someone like her had no reason to lie.

Estella left Allan's office, then the hospital, and got into her car.

Once in the car, she immediately called Jerry. She thought about reporting directly to Michael but decided it might be better to go through Jerry first.

"Mr. Nelson, here's the situation. Do you think this info will be useful to Mr. Williams?" Estella asked after filling Jerry in on everything she learned at the hospital.

Estella could hear Jerry take a deep breath on the other end of the line.

"Ms. Foster, you've done an excellent job. This news is crucial for Mr. Williams. You've made a significant contribution, and Mr. Williams will definitely reward you," Jerry said seriously.

Estella was momentarily taken aback, her mind racing with thoughts.

Jerry didn't linger on the call. After thanking Estella, he hung up.

Estella stared at the end call screen, feeling a bit shocked.

'Why did Jerry say this is so important to Michael? Is Paxton asking who harmed Pearl? Clearly, Paxton has some information, and if it's important to Michael, it means Michael is involved too. Could it be Michael?' Estella was startled by her own speculation.

She thought back to the first time she saw Michael, a man who seemed cold and imposing. Would such a strong man really do something so twisted?

Estella dared not think further. In this world, many people died, and one motive for murder was knowing too much. Sometimes, being a little ignorant, knowing less, and having less curiosity could actually save your life.

Estella took a deep breath, glanced at the hospital one last time, then turned the key and left. She was driving Zoey's car now and needed to drive it to the mall to exchange it for her own. She would leave Zoey's car keys with the store manager at a Brown Family store in the mall.

Meanwhile, after ending the call with Estella, Jerry called Michael.

After hearing Jerry's report, Michael jumped up from the sofa. "Damn, I didn't expect Paxton to go this crazy."

Michael's tone was very low, as if brewing a terrible storm.

Jerry asked, "Mr. Williams, is it possible that Paxton already knows that you are involved?"

Michael said in a low voice, "It's highly likely that he knows, whether as Michael or Isabella's husband. My wife is in danger now."

"Don't worry, Mr. Williams. Since Mrs. Williams was attacked last time, I have strengthened the security around her. Even if Paxton wants to harm Mrs. Williams, it won't be easy," Jerry said confidently.

However, Michael felt nervous, as if something terrible was about to happen.

"No, those forces are still too weak. Paxton has completely lost it now. I can't be sure if he will use more terrible weapons. I have to protect Isabella myself," Michael said, then hung up and called Isabella.

To Michael's surprise, Isabella's phone was unreachable. Michael felt a bit anxious and called Isabella's bodyguards. However, none of their phones were answered.

Carol was a bit stunned when she received Michael's call. Isabella's husband was calling her?

"What's the matter, sir?" Carol asked.

Michael didn't beat around the bush. "Why can't I reach Isabella? Where is she now?" he asked directly.

###chapter 436 Encounter Attack

After Carol got a call from Michael, she started worrying about where Isabella might be.

"The factory where they make the clothes had some problems today. Looks like the workers are on strike. Ms. Taylor went to deal with it. The factory's in a pretty remote spot, so she might not have any signal," Carol explained.

"Give me the location of that factory, now," Michael demanded, sounding really anxious.

Without missing a beat, Carol told Michael where the factory was.

"What's going on? Is Ms. Taylor in danger again?" Carol asked, clearly worried.

Michael paused for a second, took a deep breath, and said, "Paxton might have figured out the truth. He could hurt Isabella at any moment. I need to go protect her."

With that, Michael hung up, leaving Carol looking stressed out.

"Damn, how did this get exposed so suddenly?" Carol muttered, pacing back and forth in the office before finally picking up the phone.

She dialed the same number she had called last time, and soon a familiar voice answered.

"Why are you calling me again? What's happening?" the man asked, sounding confused.

Carol filled him in on what Michael had said, and he went quiet.

"What do we do now? Should we protect Isabella?" Carol asked.

The man on the other end thought for a moment and then said no. "We might not have enough people to go up against Paxton. Let Isabella's husband handle it. He'll protect her. We need to focus on something else."

"Like what?" Carol asked instinctively, then suddenly realized something.

"Are you planning to do that? Isn't it too soon?" Carol asked, nervous.

The man chuckled. "If Paxton really loses it and attacks Isabella, do you think her husband will let him get away with it? This might be our best chance to take over the Brown Family's company."

Carol took a deep breath. "Are we using Ms. Taylor as bait?"

The man sighed, "What does that have to do with us? Pearl ending up like that wasn't our fault. All we can do now is cooperate. Let's just wait and see how things play out. But I don't think Ms. Taylor will be in any real danger."

Carol gave a bitter smile. "Your uncertainty isn't very comforting."

The man said, "Do you have a better idea? No, you don't. All we can do now is wait. Maybe Paxton won't do anything today? We have to stay positive but be ready for the worst. If Isabella really dies, who are you going to pick as the successor?"

Carol went quiet, thinking about the current state of the Taylor Family. There was no one more qualified than Isabella with the Taylor Family bloodline.

The man seemed to get that too. He didn't rush Carol, letting her think it over, then hung up.

Meanwhile, Isabella found out about the workers' strike at the clothing factory because of wage issues.When Jasper was the CEO, he cut the workers' wages and promised to pay them back later. But even after Jasper went to prison, the wages never went back to what they were, and the workers were getting more and more frustrated.

After getting the full picture, Isabella fired the manager right in front of everyone. Turns out, some of the money that was supposed to go to the workers ended up in Isabella's hands because the manager had been embezzling it.

"Please trust me," Isabella told the workers with a smile. "From now on, I'll make sure you get paid on time, and this won't happen again. I'll pick a new manager from among you. We'll use a fair voting system. You tell me who you think is right for the job, and I'll promote the person with the most votes."

The workers calmed down after getting their money from Isabella. When they heard they'd get to choose the new manager, they started talking among themselves.

In the end, they picked an older employee who had been with the factory since Isabella's grandfather, Patrick, started it.

Isabella had a lot of respect for this older employee and promoted him right away. Seeing the workers' satisfied faces, Isabella knew he would make the factory better.

"Mr. Barnett, you don't need to see me off. I'll leave the factory in your hands," Isabella said respectfully to Harlan Barnett as he walked her out.

Harlan looked at Isabella with emotion. "I see your grandfather in you."

"That's a huge compliment," Isabella smiled politely.

Harlan looked down, a hint of hesitation in his eyes, like he had something to say. But just then, a car horn blared.

Isabella looked puzzled at the approaching convoy until all the cars stopped in front of her.

Michael jumped out of the car, followed by some bodyguards from the car behind him.

Harlan immediately lowered his head when he saw Michael and swallowed back whatever he was going to say.

Michael breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Isabella was safe.

Isabella, confused, walked up to him and asked, "What's wrong? What's going on?"

Michael hesitated for a moment, then pulled Isabella aside and whispered, "I'm here to protect you. I heard Pearl died in the hospital. Paxton's gone mad; he said he wants to make everyone who hurt his daughter pay. I'm worried he might come after you, so I came to protect you."

Isabella's eyes widened. "Pearl is dead? When did this happen?"

Michael was about to tell her when he suddenly saw something glinting.

"Oh no, it's a sniper rifle!" Michael immediately pulled Isabella down. A bullet whizzed over their heads, hitting one of the bodyguards behind them.

###chapter 437 Pursuit

The sudden gunshots made everyone jump. The bodyguard who got hit grabbed his wound and crumpled to the ground, looking like he was about to die.

"Damn, it's gotta be Paxton. He's lost it, using a sniper rifle." Michael spotted the factory up ahead and was ready to charge in with Isabella.

But Isabella held him back.

"Sweetie, those workers are innocent. We can't drag them into this. We need to get out of here." Her face was pale, but her eyes were full of determination.

Michael clenched his jaw and nodded, pulling Isabella close.

"Everyone, get in the car and go!" Michael shielded Isabella as they made their way to the car.

The bodyguards formed a wall in front of Michael, blocking the sniper's line of sight.

"Mr. Barnett, call the cops now. They're after me; I need to lead them away." Isabella shouted out the window once they were in the car.

When the shots rang out, the workers ducked for cover. Even without Isabella's warning, they would've called the cops.

"Ms. Taylor, stay safe!" Harlan yelled, covering his head.

In the distance, the sniper watched the cars speed away and slammed the ground in frustration. "Damn it, they got away."

He listened to the next order in his earpiece, packed up his sniper rifle, and headed to a nearby SUV. He got in and started chasing after Michael and his crew.

In the car, Isabella clung to Michael, anxiously checking her phone. The signal was spotty out here, and she couldn't get a call through.

"It's okay, babe, I've got you." Michael looked at her with a gentle smile, his eyes calm and steady.

Hearing Michael's words, Isabella started to relax. "You're right. We've got plenty of bodyguards. We'll make it out of this."

If she looked up, she'd see a flicker of worry in Michael's eyes.

Usually, Paxton's guys only used regular handguns, so Michael's team didn't have much to worry about. They could get away safely.

But now Paxton was losing it. Using a sniper meant he didn't care about the rules anymore.

Even though the cops usually stayed out of the feuds between the big families, using a sniper rifle was a big no-no.

By deploying a sniper, if Paxton let Isabella and Michael get away, the cops would definitely step in.

Meanwhile, Paxton had already taken Pearl's body out of the hospital with Zoey.

With one phone call, Paxton could get the best coffin delivered and have an embalmer dress Pearl up with silicone limbs.

Inside the coffin, Pearl looked stunning. She had a wig, bright makeup, and her silicone arms gently resting on her abdomen. She wore a beautiful red dress, her favorite outfit when she was alive.

Right now, Pearl looked like a sleeping beauty, just as she did at parties.

Paxton brought Pearl's coffin back to the Brown Villa and gathered the family for her memorial service.

The family was stunned by the news of Pearl's death. Some of them hadn't even grasped what was happening when they were called and showed up not dressed in black.

Inside the Brown Villa, Pearl's coffin was laid out, surrounded by white flowers. Paxton and Zoey stood quietly in front of it, looking at her.

The other family members wanted to ask questions but were too intimidated by Paxton's presence to approach. Even Damian, who usually craved attention, kept his mouth shut.

Those not dressed in black were even more hesitant. Their outfits were inappropriate for the occasion, so they kept quiet to avoid becoming targets of Paxton's anger.

The atmosphere was heavy and somber, like a funeral.

Zoey's face was blank. She had cried so much at the hospital that she had no tears left. Besides missing her daughter, a burning hatred kept her standing there.

The tension grew, and some people started to fidget.

Finally, Paxton broke the silence. "My daughter is dead, but I know who did it."

His low voice echoed through the room.

Everyone exchanged glances and then looked at Damian. His eyes twitched, and he cursed the cowardly family members in his mind before stepping up to Paxton.

"Mr. Brown, we're all devastated by Pearl's death. We all want justice for her, but can you tell us who did this?" Damian asked cautiously.

Paxton glanced at Damian and replied coolly, "Are you asking because you're worried I'll make powerful enemies and want to advise me to back off?"

Damian's face showed a hint of embarrassment. "Why would I think that? Pearl was family. The scumbag who did this deserves to pay. How could we just let it go?"

Paxton suddenly smirked, his eyes cold. "Don't think I don't know about the fake diary."

At the mention of the diary, the family members' faces changed. They all knew about the forgery.

"I used to be willing to sacrifice everything for this family, but now my daughter is dead! All I want is revenge! I don't care who the killer is or what their status is. Anyone who stands in my way will pay with their life!" Paxton's voice was as cold as ice.

The family members wanted to speak, but Paxton waved his hand. His men rushed forward, pointing guns at everyone in the room.

###chapter 438 Fierce Attack

The whole family was stunned when they saw the gunmen.

Damian snapped, "Paxton, what the hell are you doing? We're your family!"

"Family? Really? Have you ever treated me like family? Or am I just a tool to you?" Paxton sneered, his lips curling in a bitter smile.

"I've got it all figured out now. Just sit tight and don't make a fuss. When my guys catch the killers, you can go. But if you try anything, don't blame me for not caring about family," Paxton warned, his voice icy.

Damian was shaking with anger, but he wasn't exactly brave, especially with Paxton threatening him. He didn't dare say a word and just found a spot to sit down.

The rest of the family exchanged nervous glances, too scared to move or speak. They sat down quietly, doing as Paxton said, waiting to see what would happen next.

Once everyone settled down, Paxton's gaze softened as he looked over at Pearl in the coffin.

Suddenly, Paxton's phone rang. He answered it, his expression darkening.

"Isabella's husband showed up, huh? Keep tailing them and find a chance to take them out," Paxton ordered into the phone. It was the sniper on the other end.

The family members around him couldn't help but worry after hearing Paxton's words. They were concerned that the people Paxton wanted dead were from the four major families. The Brown Family, being the weakest, could be wiped out because of this.

But even though they were worried, no one dared to step up and stop Paxton. The guy had clearly lost it.

Some of the smarter Brown Family members had already figured out why Paxton was losing it.

Maybe it was when Paxton found out the diary he had pinned his hopes on was fake, or maybe he discovered betrayal within the family. He had given so much to them, but they wouldn't lift a finger to help him. Some even used his love and guilt as a father against him. For any normal man, that was too much to bear.

Paxton pulled out his phone and made another call. "Whatever it takes, find those two," he said.

There was a response on the other end, and faint roaring could be heard.

After leaving the clothing factory, Isabella and Michael hurried towards downtown, where they'd be safe.

As they got closer to downtown, a loud rumble echoed down the road.

Two massive trucks were barreling down the road, side by side, heading straight for Michael and his team.

The huge trucks completely blocked the road, forcing Michael's team to quickly reverse their cars. The convoy was in chaos. Some people jumped out and tried to shoot the truck tires, but the tires were too thick for bullets to pierce.

"Damn it, our cars are too close together. We can't turn around. Mr. Williams, Mrs. Williams, you go first, we'll cover you!" Michael's subordinate yelled, jumping out of the car and positioning it across the road to block the trucks.

Isabella followed closely behind Michael. Anger flashed in Michael's eyes, but he knew there was no time to worry about his men's safety now. If he and Isabella stayed, they'd just be a burden.

"Come on, babe, let's go." Michael grabbed Isabella's hand, jumped into the last car in the convoy, and sharply turned the wheel to head in another direction.

The two heavy trucks barreled towards the blocking cars.

The wheels crushed the first and second cars, turning them into scrap metal. Luckily, the people inside had already gotten out.

Those who had left the cars raised their guns and fired at the trucks, but the reinforced bodies were bulletproof.

"Damn it, how did Paxton get these trucks?" someone shouted in frustration.

After smashing through five cars, the trucks finally stopped before reaching the sixth.

Even though the trucks stopped, the drivers didn't get out. Instead, they pressed a button, and the back of the trucks opened, releasing a swarm of armed men.

These men, armed to the teeth, started shooting at Michael's team.

Michael's men only had regular pistols and bulletproof vests. Faced with the enemy's heavy firepower, they could only hide behind vehicles to avoid the bullets.

"Paxton wants to kill us all here! Use our secret weapon!" one of Michael's subordinates shouted, pulling a grenade from his waist.

Michael's men had been fighting alongside him for a long time. In the chaotic foreign lands, these guys were tough, and grenades were more effective than bullets. But in the country, grenades were strictly controlled.

But now wasn't the time to worry about that. The enemy's firepower was so intense that if they didn't use the grenades, they'd all be dead soon.

As the first grenade landed among the enemy, Paxton's men panicked and scattered, but the grenade exploded in a crowded area, taking several lives.

With the first grenade came the second, then the third...

Paxton's men hadn't expected Michael's team to have grenades, leading to heavy casualties.

Like sniper rifles, grenades were also banned in family fights.

Since the battle was near the town, some passersby noticed and called the police.

When Police Chief Alan heard about the brutal situation, he almost kicked his desk over in anger.

"A bunch of damn idiots, using heavy weapons near the city. They have no respect for the law!" Alan immediately left his office and started gathering his team to rush to the scene.

###chapter 439 Confession

After Michael got Isabella out of the crossfire, they ended up at this old, rundown factory.

Isabella felt a weird sense of déjà vu. She suddenly remembered Jasper and Mia had a shootout here after they busted out of the detention center.

"Hey babe, you okay?" Isabella asked, her voice full of worry. Michael had been her shield the whole time.

Michael just shook his head. "I'm good, babe. Let's get out of the car. We're almost out of gas, so we gotta lay low here and wait for backup."

Michael was cool as a cucumber. The factory was huge, and if they played it smart, they could stay hidden for a while. Even if Paxton was a big shot, he couldn't just bomb the place.

As long as Paxton didn't bring in the heavy artillery, Michael was confident they could hide out until Mike or Jerry showed up.

Isabella got out and was about to head inside when she noticed Michael fiddling with something in the car.

"What are you doing, babe?" Isabella asked, puzzled. She didn't get why he wasn't coming in.

"Just hang on, babe. Almost done," Michael called back.

Isabella was starting to get anxious when Michael finally got out and shut the door carefully.

"Alright, let's go inside," Michael said, pulling her into the factory.

Once inside, Isabella couldn't help but ask, "What were you doing in the car?"

Michael just shrugged. "Oh, nothing much. Just rigged a little surprise with a rope and a grenade. You know, like in the movies when the bad guys open the door and boom."

Isabella's eyes went wide. "You can make bombs? What did you do before?"

Michael shrugged again. "Used to be a mercenary in Evernia for a couple of years. Picked up a few tricks from some warlords."

Isabella had never heard this side of Michael before.

"Wow, you've had quite the life," Isabella said with a grin. She was dying to know more, but they had this unspoken rule about respecting each other's pasts.

Suddenly, Michael grabbed her and put a finger to his lips. "A car's coming," he whispered.

A car pulled up outside, and four guys jumped out, moving cautiously towards Michael's car. The windows were tinted, so they couldn't see inside.

One of them, gun in hand, crept up to the door, grabbed the handle, and yanked it open.

The sound of a grenade pin being pulled echoed inside the car.

"It's a grenade! Get down!" someone yelled, trying to make a run for it.

But the guy closest to the car door didn't stand a chance. The grenade went off, taking him out instantly. The other three got knocked around a bit but weren't seriously hurt.

"That was dirty! When I get my hands on those two, I'm gonna shove a gun in their mouths and blow their brains out," one of the thugs yelled, fuming.

"First, we gotta catch them. They must've gone into the factory. Let's move, but watch out. They might have more grenades," another thug said, cautiously leading the way inside.

Michael and Isabella heard the explosion from inside the factory.

"There's more than one of them. The grenade didn't get them all. We need to stay quiet and not make a sound," Michael whispered.

Isabella nodded but then looked puzzled. "Babe, something's not adding up. Pearl's got a big personality and probably ticked off a lot of people. Why would Paxton go to such extremes just for me?"

Michael's face had that look like he knew something but wasn't saying.

"Maybe because you're the one Pearl hates the most," Michael said with a smirk, avoiding her eyes.

Isabella's eyes narrowed. "Babe, do you know something? Don't lie to me. We're married. I can tell when you're lying, and you should feel guilty about it."

Michael bit his lip, looking like he was making a tough decision. "I'm sorry, babe. I lied about something when we were in Avalonia."

"What did you lie about? Did you have a thing for Scarlett in Avalonia?" Isabella's face went pale, feeling a wave of dizziness.

Michael rolled his eyes. "What? No! I've never lied to you about love. And what does Scarlett have to do with Paxton?"

"Then what are you talking about?" Isabella asked, confused. She thought back to their last trip to Avalonia to see Michael's dad, Kenna.

Suddenly, she remembered a call from Amelia in Avalonia about Pearl's situation.

Isabella looked at Michael, shocked. "You told me it was probably someone from the Four Families who kidnapped Pearl to start a war between Paxton and Mason. If you lied about that, does it mean you had Pearl kidnapped?"

Michael nodded slowly. "Yeah, Pearl's mess is my doing. I wanted her to pay, so I hired a psycho killer in Avalonia to deal with her."

###chapter 440 Battle Power

Isabella stared at Michael, her face pale. She couldn't believe what her husband had done.

Michael had come clean, so there was no point in hiding it. He looked into Isabella's eyes and said softly, "Babe, I admit I lied about this. I was scared that if you knew how I planned to get back at Pearl, you'd hate me. But I just couldn't control my anger. If I hadn't shown up that day, who knows what would've happened to you?"

A flicker of pain crossed Michael's eyes. He couldn't stand seeing Isabella suffer because of Pearl.

Suddenly, Isabella touched Michael's face, and he looked at her, surprised.

Isabella smiled gently at him. "Honey, do you really think I'd resent you for everything you've done for me?"

Michael bit his lip and nodded. He was indeed terrified that Isabella would hate him.

Isabella shook her head. "No, babe, even though your methods were harsh. But like you said, if it weren't for you, after what Pearl did to me, I might've ended up taking my own life. I have no right to be mad at you, and I definitely can't forgive Pearl on your behalf. We're in this together."

Michael's eyes lit up, and he hugged her tightly. "That's amazing, sweetheart. I'm so glad you're not mad at me."

"Alright, babe, now's not the time for this. We need to figure out how to hold on until help arrives or find a way out of here," Isabella said, gently patting his back.

Michael looked at her seriously and said, "Don't worry, babe. As long as I'm alive, I won't let anyone hurt you."

Isabella's face softened. Suddenly, Michael's expression changed. He quickly pulled Isabella away and drew his gun.

A scream echoed from behind Isabella. Michael yanked her up from the ground.

"They've found us. We need to move," Michael said, pulling Isabella away from their hiding spot.

But Isabella shook off his hand, grabbed a gun from the body on the ground, and stood beside him.

"Don't think I'm just a weak woman. I can handle a gun," Isabella said, her face determined.

Michael smiled and led her away.

Not long after they left, a group of people gathered around the body on the ground.

More and more of Paxton's men arrived at the abandoned factory.

"They were just here. Team one and team two, flank from the left and right. Teams three and four, search along the stairs. Team five, follow me. Let's corner them," the captain ordered.

As the teams moved, Captain Lyle Warner spoke into his earpiece, "Efren, do you have eyes on them?"Sniper Efren Britton, perched on a distant building, peered through his scope. Keeping an eye on the factory, he spoke into his earpiece, "They should be hugging the wall. I haven't spotted them yet; looks like they're aware of me."

"Keep scanning for any signs. We'll try to flush them out," Lyle replied, leading his men in pursuit of Michael and Isabella.

Michael and Isabella crept along the wall. Whenever they approached windows that could expose them, they crawled to stay out of the sniper's sight.

"Babe, this feels like we're in some action movie," Isabella joked, her once pristine outfit now dirty and disheveled.

Though she tried to make light of the situation, Isabella's body trembled slightly with fear. She was trying to stay calm and show Michael she could handle it.

Michael looked at her with tenderness and a hint of guilt in his eyes.

"Don't give me that look. You did what you had to. If it were me, I wouldn't have let Pearl off easy either. Maybe not as harsh, but I'd definitely put a few bullets in her. Paxton wouldn't spare me either. So stop blaming yourself," Isabella whispered, pulling Michael along as they continued to flee.

More enemies appeared along their path, forcing Michael and Isabella into firefights.

Michael's marksmanship was top-notch, a skill he honed during his mercenary days. Each shot he fired hit vital areas like the head or chest.

Isabella's shooting wasn't as precise as Michael's, but her suppressive fire still caused trouble for their pursuers.

After dispatching another wave of enemies, Michael pulled Isabella along, continuing their escape.

But this time, Michael's expression was grim. He had figured out the enemy's strategy.

"They're herding us into a trap. Paxton must've sent someone serious to take us down this time," Michael said with a cold smile.

Isabella felt a pang of guilt. Michael could've easily escaped on his own, but he stayed to protect her.

"Now it's my turn to say this: put away your guilt. We're in this together," Michael said with a gentle smile.

Suddenly, Isabella's eyes lit up. "How about we play dead?"

Michael was taken aback. Playing dead? That was pointless. The enemies would definitely check to confirm.

But then he got it. She wanted to wear the enemies' clothes and pretend to be dead.

"Not a bad idea. It might buy us some time," Michael agreed.

A few minutes later, Lyle and his men arrived at the spot where Michael and Isabella had been. But they found no trace of them, as if they had vanished into thin air.

"Damn it, where did they go? How could they just disappear?" Lyle roared, frustration etched on his face.

However, Lyle and his team didn't notice the slight movement of the eyelids on the two bodies lying nearby.

###chapter 441 Rescue Arrives

Lyle was getting frustrated. He couldn't find Michael and Isabella anywhere and figured they must've taken off in another direction. So, he and his crew split up again to search for any signs of them. Lyle was sure they'd find them eventually, given their numbers and the dragnet search they were doing.

Meanwhile, the two bodies on the ground suddenly opened their eyes and scanned the area. It was Michael and Isabella. They had swapped into the enemy's clothes and played dead, successfully tricking their pursuers.

"Sweetie, this trick is working like a charm. We can keep this up a bit longer," Isabella said with a grin.

Michael put a finger to his lips. "Shh, honey. Dead people don't talk."

Isabella rolled her eyes but stayed still.

Just then, they heard footsteps. Isabella and Michael quickly shut their eyes, pretending to be dead again.

"Everyone else is out searching. Are we really gonna slack off now?" one thug with a gun asked nervously.

His buddy gave him an annoyed look. "Chill out. There's a ton of people looking for them. They won't miss us. If they find them, they'll call us on the walkie-talkie, and we can join in."

The thug pulled out a pack of cigarettes, lit one for himself, and handed one to his friend.

The two thugs leaned against the wall, puffing away.

As they enjoyed their smoke break, their eyes wandered and landed on the two bodies on the ground. These guys were more like thugs than soldiers, so they didn't care about their fallen comrades and started making fun of the bodies.

"Hey, check out that one on the ground. Nice butt! He'd be a hit in prison," one thug laughed.

Isabella's brow twitched in annoyance. These jerks were commenting on her figure.

Michael was fuming. No guy likes hearing other men talk about his wife like that.

Then, Michael felt a kick on his butt, making him flinch.

"You're right, man, that butt is pretty perky," the other thug laughed.

Michael's face darkened, while Isabella had to stifle a laugh. Turns out, they were talking about Michael's butt.

Suddenly, one of the thugs noticed something white in the corner of the stairs.

"Hey, is there something over there?" one thug nudged the other.

They exchanged glances, raised their guns, and slowly approached the corner.

It was a spot covered with bricks and tattered cloth, and it looked like there was a hand sticking out from under the cloth.

The thugs lifted the cloth, sending stones and bricks scattering. Underneath were two dead bodies with gunshot wounds.

The thugs were startled, not sure what to make of it.

But then, one of the thugs had a lightbulb moment and shouted, "I get it! They took our clothes and blended in with our group. Damn it, I need to warn Mr. Warner!"

As he reached for his walkie-talkie, two gunshots echoed, and the thugs dropped to the ground, their heads blown open.

Michael stood behind them, gun in hand, the barrel still smoking.

He turned to Isabella and said, "The gunshots will bring them here. Our disguise won't hold up much longer."

"What do we do now?" Isabella asked, her voice shaky.

Michael pointed to the walkie-talkie on the thug's chest. "We can listen in on their commands. It might give us an edge."

He grabbed Isabella's hand, and they took off running again.

Soon, more thugs arrived at the scene. With no time to spare, they couldn't bother disguising the two naked bodies.

Lyle stood over the four bodies, his face dark with anger. "Those two were lying right here, pretending to be dead in our clothes! They were right under our noses!"

The others looked at the stripped bodies and their dead companions, their faces grim. They'd been played.

"Mr. Warner, what now?" one thug asked.

Lyle's eyes narrowed. "They've got our walkie-talkie. We can't trust our commands are secure. We need to fix this."

He grabbed the walkie-talkie and barked, "Everyone, form groups of three or four. Take off your masks or face coverings. If you don't recognize someone's face, feel their chest and crotch. You'll know the difference."

All the thugs who heard the instructions removed their face masks. When forming teams, they cautiously pointed their guns at each other, then carefully felt the other person's chest and crotch.

Since all the pursuers were men, it would be obvious if a woman tried to infiltrate their group.

Michael and Isabella heard the instructions on the walkie-talkie. Isabella looked at Michael, her face pale. "Darling, you go ahead. At least you'll be safe."

Michael rolled his eyes. "And leave you behind? Should I just watch you get killed?"

Isabella tightened her grip on her gun, her voice firm despite the fear creeping in. "If it comes to that, I'll take my own life. I won't let them capture me and endure their torture."

Michael pulled her into a tight hug. "No way, darling. I won't live without you. If we die, we die together."

There was a fierce determination in Michael's eyes. He'd rather die than let Isabella be captured alone.

Just then, screams echoed through the air. Then a voice called out, "Mr. Williams, Mrs. Williams, where are you? We're here to rescue you!"

###chapter 442 Injured

Michael's eyes lit up the moment he heard Mike's voice.

"Babe, our backup's here!" Michael shouted, excitement all over his face.

Isabella's eyes widened in surprise as the sounds of heavy gunfire and grenade blasts echoed outside the old factory.

Reinforcements in bulletproof vests, armed to the teeth, charged at Paxton's men, tossing grenades, smoke bombs, and tear gas canisters.

The entire abandoned factory was thick with the acrid smell of smoke and gunpowder, making it so suffocating that it was hard to keep one's eyes open.

"Those damn bastards! If Mr. Williams gets hurt, I'll throw every last one of you into a meat grinder!" Mike bellowed, storming in with a submachine gun. Bullets flew, turning anyone in their path into Swiss cheese.

"Babe, now that our guys are here, let's get out of here," Isabella said, ready to bolt, but Michael stopped her.

Isabella looked at Michael, puzzled. He pointed at their clothes.

"Look at all that smoke out there and then look at our clothes. Our reinforcements might mistake us for the enemy. If we get caught in the crossfire, we're toast," Michael said with a wry smile, taking off his jacket.

Isabella slapped her forehead, realizing she had totally forgotten about that. Getting shot by their own team would be the worst luck ever.

Michael grabbed Isabella, and they dashed to where they had stashed their original clothes. They changed quickly.

After the initial assault, Paxton's men got the picture. With heavy losses, they took cover in various corners of the factory, gearing up for close combat.

"Listen up, we need to find those two. Their firepower is insane, and we're at a disadvantage. If we can grab them as hostages, we might have a shot at getting out of here alive," Lyle barked into the walkie-talkie. It was their only shot since they were outnumbered.

Mike's voice crackled through Lyle's walkie-talkie.

"I'll blow your brains out before you catch them!" Mike sneered, followed by static, signaling the device was toast.

Mike and his team had taken out a bunch of enemies and snagged their walkie-talkies.

Things were looking pretty grim for Paxton's men.

Both sides were hunting for Michael and Isabella. Whoever found them first would win this fight.

Michael and Isabella dodged the thugs, while the other side closed in on Mike's crew.

Seeing how bad things were, Lyle suddenly had an idea.

He told a few of his guys to steal and wear the clothes of Mike's men they had taken down.

He had picked up this trick from Michael and Isabella.

Lyle and three of his guys slipped into the stolen uniforms. He kept the plan to himself, worried the walkie-talkie might give them away to Mike's crew.

"Sorry, guys. May God be with you," Lyle muttered under his breath, leading his team in a desperate bid to break through.

Despite their training, Paxton's men didn't have the same hardcore discipline as the big four families. Expecting them to lay down their lives for each other was a pipe dream.

But sometimes, when you least expect it, the impossible just happens.

Lyle found himself in this exact pickle. Their original plan was to ditch the factory and forget the whole damn mission. But just as they were about to bail, they ran smack into two people.

It was Michael and Isabella.

When Michael and Isabella saw Lyle in the team uniform, a flicker of hope lit up their eyes, especially Isabella's.

"Are you here to rescue us? That's awesome, we can finally get out of here," Isabella said excitedly, reaching for Lyle's hand.

"Yes, Ms. Taylor, we're here to get you and this gentleman out. Let's move," Lyle said, extending his hand to Isabella.

Suddenly, Michael yanked Isabella back, pulled out his gun, and fired at Lyle. The bullet grazed Lyle's arm as he dodged.

"Run, they're not our guys," Michael shouted, continuing to fire. Lyle and another guy shot back.

Luckily, Michael and Isabella were near a corner and managed to duck behind the wall, avoiding the bullets.

"How did you know they were fakes?" Isabella asked, shocked and trembling.

"Their clothes had bullet holes, clearly stripped from dead bodies," Michael replied.

Isabella didn't doubt Michael for a second; she hadn't even noticed the bullet holes, amazed at Michael's sharp eye.

In truth, Michael had figured it out from the way Lyle addressed them. Mike's men would call him Mr. Williams, not 'this gentleman.' And they would call Isabella Ms. Taylor, not Mrs. Williams.

Only Paxton's men, clueless about their real identities, would use such odd terms.

Lyle and his last guy didn't chase after them, knowing the gunfire would draw Mike's team. They planned to use the chaos to make their escape.

"Where the hell do you think you're going?" Mike stormed in, followed by a dozen of his men.

They raised their guns and took out Lyle and his buddy.

Hearing Mike's voice, Michael finally felt a wave of relief, pulling Isabella out from behind the wall.

"Mr. Williams, Mrs. Williams!" Mike greeted them, grinning.

Just as Michael was about to say something to Mike, he noticed something off. Near a window, he saw a glint of light. He quickly shoved Isabella aside, but a bullet hit him in the chest.

###chapter 443 Operation Annihilation

Isabella watched in horror as Michael hit the ground, her mind going completely blank.

"Michael, wake up!" she screamed, panic setting in as she saw the blood spreading across his chest.

She pressed her hand against the wound, but it was quickly soaked with blood.

Michael managed a weak smile at her before passing out.

"Get Mr. and Mrs. Williams to the hospital! The rest of you, follow me! We're catching that damn sniper!" Mike shouted.

Mike led his team towards where the sniper had been. Meanwhile, Isabella and the others carried Michael outside. Mike's men formed a protective barrier around them, blocking the sniper's view.

The sniper, hidden on the rooftop, realized he had lost his chance. He quickly disassembled his rifle and made his escape.

'Damn it, what a bunch of useless idiots. Mission failed, but at least I don't have to give the money back. Paxton's probably done for too,' the sniper thought, cursing Paxton's men. He was a pro, not like them.

Mike and his team reached the rooftop, but the sniper was long gone. All they found were traces of his presence.

Mike ordered the search to continue, then stood on the rooftop, firing his gun into the sky in frustration.

Just then, his phone rang. He saw it was Jerry calling.

Mike knew why Jerry was calling. He hesitated, then answered.

Jerry's furious voice exploded through the phone.

"You idiot! How did Mr. Williams get so badly hurt? Weren't you supposed to protect him? What the hell happened? You damn fool! I want to shoot you myself," Jerry raged.

Mike's face darkened, but he had no words.

Jerry eventually calmed down and said, "I've got Benjamin waiting at the hospital. With him there, Mr. Williams has a good chance."

"I'll find that sniper. What's the situation with Paxton?" Mike asked carefully.

Jerry replied coldly, "Have Joe contact Carol. Tell her Paxton and Zoey are as good as dead. Whatever she's planning, she needs to act now."

Jerry hung up.

Mike immediately called Joe and filled him in. Joe then called Carol.

Carol was pacing in her office, anxious because she couldn't reach Isabella. Michael had warned her that Isabella was in danger, and she felt a growing sense of urgency.

Just then, her phone rang. She picked it up eagerly, but her face fell when she saw it was Joe."Why are you calling me? Does your boss have instructions? Why doesn't he call me himself?" Carol asked, frowning.

Joe's voice was low. "My boss got shot protecting his wife."

Carol was stunned. "How is Ms. Taylor?"

"She's fine; they're at the hospital. But this isn't about that. Paxton and Zoey are as good as dead! We're going after them directly, so be ready once Paxton is gone," Joe said before hanging up.

Carol was still in shock, unsure how to process everything.

She quickly made another call.

The man on the other end went silent after hearing her out.

"I got it. As soon as I hear about Paxton's death, I'll act immediately," he said before hanging up.

Carol stared at her phone, then slumped against her desk, feeling overwhelmed.

Meanwhile, Paxton was still holding a memorial service for his daughter Pearl. The other family members, even at gunpoint, didn't dare speak. They were starting to feel hungry and dizzy because the service had dragged on for too long.

Paxton clutched his phone, his brow furrowed, waiting for a call from his men, but nothing came.

Suddenly, his phone rang. His eyes lit up as he answered; it was the sniper.

"Sorry, Mr. Brown, all your men are dead," the sniper's first words were devastating.

Paxton didn't care about his men. "What about the people who hurt my daughter? Are they dead or not?"

"The woman is definitely not dead, but I shot the man in the chest. I don't know if he'll survive," the sniper replied, leaving Paxton frustrated.

"I paid you a lot of money, and you give me an uncertain answer?" Paxton snapped.

The sniper stayed calm. "I'm sorry, Mr. Brown, but as a businessman, you should know sometimes you lose. I'll check if the man is dead. If he's alive, I'll refund part of the payment, provided you live that long."

"What do you mean by that?" Paxton demanded.

The sniper explained patiently, "The people you've crossed are very dangerous. Be ready for their brutal retaliation. It's not too late to run."

The sniper hung up. When Paxton tried calling back, the phone was off.

"Damn bastard!" Paxton yelled, throwing his phone.

The next second, a gunshot rang out, hitting Paxton in the chest.

###chapter 444 The Death of the Successor

Paxton felt a sharp pain in his chest and looked down in disbelief as the bloodstain on his shirt kept spreading.

A woman's scream pierced the air at the memorial service, right before a bunch of masked, heavily armed guys burst in and started shooting.

Paxton's crew fired back immediately, turning the place into a chaotic battlefield with gunshots and the smell of gunpowder everywhere. The Brown family members screamed and ran for their lives; some got hit, but most managed to escape in the chaos.

Jerry, masked and armed to the teeth, kept his cold eyes on Paxton, shooting at him without mercy. But Paxton's men shielded him and dragged him away.

Zoey rushed to Paxton's side, doing everything she could to help him get away.

Feeling his life slipping away, Paxton looked at Zoey with guilt. "I'm sorry, my dear, for all the hardship over the years. I feel so guilty."

"Don't give me that crap. I wouldn't marry you; I'd rather jump into a river," Zoey snapped, her eyes red with anger.

Paxton remembered meeting Zoey at a banquet when he was young and full of ambition. His dream was to make the family powerful, and Zoey was drawn to his aura, eventually becoming his partner.

Paxton felt a deep guilt towards Zoey because he had sacrificed everything for his family over the years, including his wife and daughter. Only now, facing death, did he realize he hadn't betrayed the family but had failed his own.

"Leave me, take her and run, now! Go find Ms. Foster; she can protect you," Paxton said, pushing Zoey away and ordering his men to take her.

Paxton's men hesitated but eventually decided to get Zoey to safety, despite her protests.

"Even if I run, where can I go? My daughter and husband are still here. Do you expect me to seek revenge for you?" Zoey cried as the men pulled her away.

Paxton sat on the ground, clutching his chest, watching Zoey's figure fade away as his vision blurred.

Then someone stood in front of him.

Paxton looked up at the masked man, feeling like he had seen those eyes before.

"Do I know you? Your eyes look familiar," Paxton asked, confused and weak.

Jerry pulled up his mask, revealing his face.

Paxton, near death, widened his eyes at Jerry, momentarily regaining some strength. He shouted in horror.

"How could it be you! Aren't you Michael's guy? Why are you attacking me? We're partners!" Paxton yelled.

Jerry, with a cold expression, said, "You sent people to kill Mr. Williams and Mrs. Williams. Now we're sending you to your death."

Paxton was stunned for a moment but quickly realized something."Isabella's husband is Michael! If it's him, then everything makes sense! No wonder the four families couldn't figure out his identity. But what about Estella?" Paxton asked, fear creeping in.

Jerry stepped closer, sneering as he pressed the gun against Paxton's chin. "Do you know why I didn't send anyone after your wife? Because Estella was the bait Mr. Williams used to protect Mrs. Williams, and you handed your wife to us."

Paxton's eyes widened, almost tearing up at the corners. He felt a mix of anger and desperation, wanting to fight Jerry. But Jerry just lightly pulled the trigger, the bullet piercing through Paxton's chin and exiting through the back of his head.

Paxton's neck slumped, his eyes showing regret and despair, and he died like that.

Jerry stood up, took a photo of Paxton with his phone, and sent it to Joe.

Meanwhile, a subordinate ran over to Jerry and asked, "Sir, the other members of the Brown Family have all fled. Should we bring them back?"

Jerry shook his head, putting his mask back on. "No need to bother, someone will take care of them. Let's go find Zoey."

On the other side, Zoey, under the protection of several subordinates, finally arrived at Estella's place.

Estella had gotten Zoey's call and led them into her villa when they arrived.

"My husband and daughter are dead because of Isabella and her husband. I will never let them go," Zoey cried, sitting on the sofa and wiping her tears.

Estella looked at Zoey, who had lost her husband and daughter. As a woman, she should have expressed sympathy, but she couldn't bring herself to say anything, even fearing to approach Zoey, worried a gunfight might break out.

Zoey finally noticed Estella's silence. She looked at Estella with suspicion and asked, "Why did you run so far?"

Estella's face looked unnatural. "Because I was worried you might harm me later."

Zoey had a bad feeling in her gut. She stood up in panic from the sofa, questioning Estella, "Did you betray me? Why? With your status, you shouldn't be afraid of anyone's threats."

Estella sighed. She wasn't a fool. After Jerry called her and explained the situation, Estella reviewed all the information she had received and quickly came to a terrifying conclusion.

Isabella was Michael's true wife! When Jerry called her to detain Zoey, his tone was so low, as if a storm was brewing.

If Jerry was so angry, it must be that something happened to Michael or Isabella.

Estella, even if she was truly Michael's wife, she dared not help Zoey now.

"Surrender, Zoey. Your family is finished this time. If you surrender to the police, maybe you can still live." Out of kindness, Estella reminded her.

"I don't need a traitor like you to remind me!" Angry, Zoey grabbed a subordinate's gun, preparing to shoot at Estella.

A bullet pierced through Zoey's palm as a group of people burst into the villa, shooting at Zoey and her men.

###chapter 445 Escaping Danger

Estella crouched behind the counter, her heart pounding as gunshots and screams echoed outside. The smell of gunpowder filled the air.

She was shaking with fear, and even when the gunfire stopped, she couldn't bring herself to stand up.

"It's over, they're all gone. You can get up now," Jerry's voice came from above her.

Leaning against the wall, Estella slowly got to her feet. When she saw the blood and bodies outside, her legs almost gave out, but Jerry caught her just in time.

Jerry guided Estella away from the living room and into another room where she couldn't see the carnage, helping her to calm down.

Among the bodies, the sight of Zoey's was the hardest for Estella to bear. Despite their manipulative relationship, there had been some semblance of friendship between them.

As Estella started to calm down, Jerry asked, "Do you know what to do next?"

Estella nodded. "Zoey and her crew broke into my house, threatened me, and wanted me to help them escape the country. But my bodyguard found them in time and took them out."

Jerry nodded. "Good story. Stick to it when the cops show up. If you think you might slip up, let your lawyer handle it. Just act surprised, which should be easy for you."

Estella nodded but then hesitated. "Can I know how Mr. Williams and Ms. Taylor are doing?"

She looked at Jerry, unsure.

After a moment, Jerry said, "Looks like you already have an idea. So, no point hiding it. Mr. Williams got shot in the chest and is in the hospital, fighting for his life. Ms. Taylor is with him. Mr. Williams is grateful for the info you gave and promised a big reward if he makes it."

"I'll pray for him; he has to pull through," Estella said, clasping her hands together, her voice sincere.

Jerry nodded. "I believe he will. Ms. Taylor doesn't know Mr. Williams's true identity yet, and he wants to keep it that way for now. So keep playing the role of Michael's wife."

Estella nodded, no problem there. She'd always played the part well, much to Michael's satisfaction.

After briefing Estella, Jerry left. Soon, her lawyer and the police arrived. When the cops saw that Zoey and her crew were the ones dead, things got more complicated.

"Ms. Foster, are you saying Zoey was planning to kidnap you? But I thought you two were friends," the officer asked, eyeing Estella suspiciously.

Estella stayed quiet and looked at her lawyer.

The lawyer stepped in front of the police and said calmly, "Officers, your tone is distressing my client. She's still in shock. She has told me what happened, and I can relay that to you."

The officer shrugged, not wanting to push it. This was a mess he didn't want to dive into.

Soon, a story was crafted based on the lawyer's account.

Zoey bolted from the memorial service, but it didn't take long for her and her husband's plot to kill Isabella to come to light. Paxton, the hitman they hired, botched the job and got into a heated argument with them. In a fit of rage, the other hitmen turned on Paxton and killed him.

Panicking at the thought of being wanted by the police, Zoey begged Estella to help them flee the country.

But Estella, being a law-abiding citizen, refused and told Zoey to turn herself in. This infuriated Zoey, who then pulled a gun on Estella. Luckily, Estella's bodyguard was on high alert and took out Zoey and her crew before they could do any harm.

After hearing the lawyer's version of events, the police officer scribbled in his notebook, finding the story more suited for a TV drama than real life.

If Zoey really wanted to skip town, she wouldn't need Estella's help. Even though the Brown Family was the weakest of the four major families, they had the resources to get out of the country. Plus, the idea that Paxton was killed over a spat with other hitmen was just too far-fetched.

Professional killers don't argue over failed jobs; they just issue refunds. Killing an employer over a phone argument would break all the rules and ruin their reputation. Even in the criminal world, there are rules to follow!

The officer knew the drill. Chief Alan had made it clear: cases involving the Four Great Families were off-limits unless handled by someone of equal standing. This questioning was just a formality before the case got shelved.

"Alright, we're done here. Ms. Foster, I hope you recover from this ordeal soon," the officer said with a polite smile before leaving with his team.

As they left Estella's mansion, one of the cops suggested they go see Isabella for more info. But another officer quickly shot down the idea.

"Ms. Taylor's been through enough. She's probably under a lot of stress and won't want to talk right now. We should wait until she's in a better state of mind," the officer who had questioned Estella reminded them.

These guys weren't dumb; they knew this was all part of Alan's plan. So they headed back to the station.

Meanwhile, Isabella sat on a bench outside the emergency room, her eyes vacant, hands clasped in prayer.

Suddenly, the emergency room door swung open. Isabella jumped up and rushed over.

"Benjamin, how's it going? Is everything okay with Michael?" Isabella asked, her voice trembling with worry.

Benjamin pulled off his mask, a smile spreading across his face. "Don't worry, Michael was wearing a bulletproof vest. The bullet did hit him, but it didn't cause any fatal injuries. With some rest, he'll be back on his feet soon."

###chapter 446 Good News

Isabella was over the moon when she heard what Benjamin had to say.

"That's amazing! I knew those bulletproof vests would come through!" she exclaimed, tears streaming down her face, almost fainting from the excitement.

Earlier, when they had swapped back into their own clothes from their enemies' disguises, they had taken bulletproof vests from the bodies and put them on. Not all the bad guys had been wearing them, though. Michael had only one, while Isabella had doubled up with two layers.

Benjamin quickly caught her and helped her sit down on a bench.

"Don't pass out on me now. I just saved your husband; I don't want to have to drag you into the ER next," Benjamin said, rolling his eyes.

Isabella shook her head. "Sorry, I just got too happy."

"I get it, but he'll be out soon. Let's get him to a hospital room," Benjamin said, pointing outside the emergency room.

A surgical bed was wheeled out, and there was Michael, looking pale but alive.

Isabella rushed over to him.

Michael had already woken up by then. He looked at Isabella with a tired smile.

"It's okay, babe, I'm fine. Don't worry about me," Michael said weakly.

Tears still streaming, Isabella nodded. "I'm so relieved to hear that. I'll get you to the hospital room now."

She and the other bodyguards pushed Michael into the hospital room.

Benjamin watched them go. Once they were out of sight, he called Jerry.

"I've saved Mr. Williams. You know what to do next?" Benjamin asked, his face serious. Michael was his childhood friend, and seeing him like this made him furious.

Jerry sighed in relief on the other end. "Don't worry, Mr. White. Paxton and Zoey are already dead. Next, we'll deal with his family."

Benjamin was shocked. He had been in the operating room the whole time and had no idea Paxton and Zoey were already taken care of.

"Alright. If you need any help later, just let me know." With that, Benjamin hung up and headed to Michael's hospital room.

Standing outside the door, Benjamin watched Isabella and Michael share a tender moment. He decided not to go in.

'After today, with Michael taking bullets for love, even if his identity gets exposed later, at least Isabella will be more understanding,' Benjamin thought, a smile tugging at his lips as he left.

After ending the call, Jerry called Mike to let him know Michael was out of danger.

Mike was almost in tears from the good news. "That's fantastic! I knew Mr. Williams would pull through."

Jerry's voice was icy. "This isn't over yet. Carol's running the Brown Family's affairs now. Mr. Williams mentioned that the forces backing Carol will definitely make a move and won't miss this chance. We don't need to worry. Your job is to keep the attack on Mr. and Mrs. Williams under wraps for now. Don't let John and Mason find out."

Mike nodded. "Got it. The police are in the loop. The folks in the city only know there was a shootout, but they have no clue who was involved."

Satisfied, Jerry hung up, waiting for Carol's next move.

Meanwhile, Carol was on the phone with a man.

"I can't believe it, they actually pulled it off," the man said, sounding amazed.

"So, when are you planning to make your move?" Carol asked.

The man replied, "Actually, I've already started."

At that moment, in various companies of the Brown Family, the Taylor Family members who got the message had already begun to act.

Dominic Grant, a senior executive sent by Paxton, held significant power in one of the companies. Although there were three other Taylor Family members in similar positions, their combined influence didn't match Dominic's.

Dominic could easily control the other three, who had to constantly cater to him to keep their shaky positions.

Dominic's favorite hobby was horse racing, and he had bet on the number 9 horse. Clutching his ticket, he yelled at the live broadcast, "Come on, number 9, you're the ghost in the night, you can't lose, I'm counting on you to make me a big profit!"

He watched the black number 9 horse intently, cheering as it pulled ahead and neared the finish line.

"Yes, it looks like I finally won this time!" Dominic shouted, but then a red number 13 horse surged ahead by a nose and won the race.

"Damn it, number 13, I've lost again!" Dominic tore up his ticket in frustration.

"Money's running low again. I'll have to hit up those three guys for cash," he thought, referring to the other executives.

Suddenly, the office door swung open, and the three executives walked in.

Dominic smiled at them, but their expressions made him uneasy.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" Dominic asked, puzzled by the disdain and mockery in their eyes.

One of the executives sneered, "Dominic, you've embezzled a lot of company funds over the years. The police are here to arrest you. Come with us."

Dominic was stunned as several police officers walked in with arrest warrants.

"Dominic, you're under arrest for embezzling company funds," one of the officers said coldly.

Furious, Dominic slammed his fist on the table. "Do you three idiots know the consequences of crossing me? I'll call Mr. Brown right now."

But before he could reach for the phone, he was handcuffed.

One of the officers said flatly, "Paxton is already dead. He won't be taking your call."

###chapter 447 Family Feud

Dominic wasn't buying what the cop in front of him was selling. He had a hunch the officer was in cahoots with those three guys, trying to pull a fast one on him.

"Get out of my way, I need to make a call. Don't even think about stopping me," Dominic barked, grabbing the phone and dialing Paxton's number.

The cops just stood there, smirking at him.

Dominic anxiously waited for the call to go through.

After what felt like forever, someone finally picked up. Dominic's face lit up, while the cops looked even more amused.

"Mr. Brown, it's Dominic. Three execs from the Taylor Family have turned on the company. I need you to fire them," Dominic said, shooting a triumphant look at the three execs. But they didn't even flinch.

A bad feeling started creeping over Dominic, especially when the other end of the line stayed silent.

"Mr. Brown, say something! It's really me, Dominic! We met at that family gathering, remember? You even said I was doing a great job," Dominic tried to jog Paxton's memory.

But then a woman's voice came through. "I'm sorry, Dominic, Paxton can't take your call right now."

"Who are you? Mrs. Brown? No, you don't sound like her. Who are you?" Dominic shouted, panic rising in his voice.

The woman replied, "I'm a police officer. This is the police station. Mr. Brown's phone is evidence now. And as for Mrs. Brown, I'm sorry, but she's deceased too."

Dominic's lips trembled as he listened, the phone slipping from his hand in disbelief.

"Alright, Dominic, if you still don't believe it, come with us to the station. You can see Mr. Brown one last time. But hurry, or his family might take his body back," a cop taunted, leading Dominic out of the office.

"No, Mr. Brown can't be dead. This has to be some kind of trick. You must be using high-tech gadgets to fool me," Dominic kept muttering, his lips trembling, as they took him to the station in a patrol car.

When Dominic saw Paxton's body, despair washed over his face. He wasn't the only one. The station was full of people like Dominic, all refusing to believe Paxton was dead until they saw his body, then breaking down in despair.

Meanwhile, Police Chief Alan was flipping through three diaries that had been sent to the station along with a video file, anonymously. The contents were pretty juicy.

The diaries detailed info about illegal immigrants and middlemen, and it all checked out. They had enough to make arrests that would wipe out half the city's smuggling operations!

The video file showed Paxton ordering his guys to toss Francis into molten steel. Alan grimaced at Paxton's twisted actions and shut off the video. He then called Brenda to let her know she could come home tomorrow.

Brenda, who was miles away in Avalonia, had no clue what was going down back home. When Alan filled her in, she was left speechless.

"Alan, are you serious? Paxton found out who hurt his daughter, went after Isabella and her husband, and got killed in the process? Did I get it wrong before? Was it really Ms. Taylor who did that to Pearl?" Brenda asked, stunned.

"If you can't promise to drop this investigation when you get back, you might as well stay abroad," Alan said coolly.

Brenda went quiet. One of the big family leaders got taken out just like that, and she was just a regular cop. Did she really have what it took to handle this?

"I miss you and Auntie. I'll be back tomorrow. Don't worry, I won't dig into this anymore," Brenda assured him.

Alan didn't buy it. She'd made too many promises she never kept.

"If you lie to me again, you'll be stuck handling traffic at the transportation department. I'm not joking," Alan said, hanging up before she could argue.

Brenda slammed the table in frustration. "Damn power!"

"You damn bastards! I'm the most senior member of the family, I should be in charge," Damian shouted, pounding the table.

But the other members of the Brown Family just looked at Damian with mocking eyes.

After Paxton's death, instead of going for revenge right away, they decided to pick a new leader. The top contender was Colin. He was mentioned in those three diaries, which John had forged to frame him and make Paxton think there was an internal conflict. But John wasn't the only one with that idea.

Unfortunately, Colin wasn't around because he got hit by a stray bullet when Jerry and the others were attacking Paxton.

With Colin out of the picture, the remaining Brown Family members were all on equal footing, and everyone wanted to be the top dog. But no one was willing to step aside.

"I've bled for this family, I've been injured for this family, I deserve to be the leader," a man roared, slamming the table.

But a woman shot back, "Who hasn't sacrificed for the family? Plus, all the properties Paxton gave you are losing money. How dare you think you can lead?"

The man glared at the woman, who stared right back, unflinching.

###chapter 448 The Brown Family's Demise

The rest of the family was at each other's throats, everyone wanting to be the new head, but none of them had anything to show for it.

Things were getting heated when Paxton's butler, Jonah, suddenly barged in.

"Are you guys done yet? Mr. Brown just died, and you're already fighting over his spot! Do you even get how bad things are for the Brown Family right now? The other three big families are definitely going to come after our assets!" Jonah shouted, clearly pissed.

"Who do you think you are, talking to us like that? Just a butler! What makes you think you can boss us around?" one of the family members sneered.

Jonah's face went cold as he looked around at them with eyes like a hawk.

"So, none of you can decide on a new head?" Jonah asked, surprisingly calm.

"Enough, Jonah. Who do you think you are? Get out of here right now," a woman snapped, slamming the table and standing up, glaring at him.

Jonah clapped his hands, and suddenly a bunch of guys stormed in, all pointing guns at the family.

"If you can't pick a new head, let me help you out," Jonah said, still calm.

"Jonah, what the hell are you doing? Are you betraying us? We're your masters," a woman screamed, furious.

Jonah signaled to one of his men, and the woman's head was blown off in an instant.

She slumped over, falling under the table.

Everyone was shocked at Jonah's ruthlessness.

"I thought you guys might be useful, but you're worse than trash. At least trash can be turned into fertilizer," Jonah said, his face icy.

The family members turned pale with fear.

Damian's eyes lit up like he had an idea.

"Jonah, if you support me as the head of the Brown Family, I'll give you the same deal Paxton did, maybe even better!" Damian said, looking smug. With Jonah's help, he could scare the others into making him the head.

Some family members glared at Damian, while others wished they'd thought of it first.

Jonah glanced at Damian. "You think you're smart?"

Damian hesitated. "Wait, Jonah, you're not gonna take my offer?"

Jonah raised his gun and shot Damian in the head.

"You guys aren't worth my time! Not even Paxton or Patrick from the Taylor Family had that privilege!" Jonah's face was full of contempt.

Jonah waved his hand, and his men opened fire, killing all the family members.

The living room was filled with smoke and screams.

When the gunfire stopped, all the Browns were dead.

Jonah looked around the room, not a hint of emotion on his face.

'I thought using a diary to get to Isabella through Paxton would work, but these idiots kept messing things up! Paxton's useless, can't even take out Isabella! How much longer do I have to play this undercover game?' Jonah fumed, kicking the bodies in frustration, his face growing darker with anger.

He only stopped when his shoes were soaked in blood.

Jonah wiped his shoes on the clothes of the dead, then turned and walked out of the Brown Villa.

Before getting into his car, Jonah glanced back at the place he'd worked for so many years.

"I was supposed to keep an eye on Patrick from the Taylor Family, but he sent me to go undercover with Paxton. Undercover work is one thing, but Paxton took most of the Taylor Family's assets, giving me plenty to investigate. Now, the Brown Family's gone, and I'm under suspicion. Damn superiors," Jonah muttered bitterly before getting into the car.

Soon after, a swarm of police officers arrived. They were there to arrest the Brown Family members based on anonymous tips about their crimes. But they didn't expect to find the evidence in someone else's hands.

When the cops got there, they were stunned to find all the Browns dead. Everyone started pointing fingers at Isabella or the other three big families.

But no matter who was to blame, one thing was clear: the entire Brown Family was wiped out.

When the news hit the other three major families, they were all in shock.

"What did you say? Paxton and Zoey are dead, and the rest of the family too?" Mason, leaning on his cane, looked at Charles in disbelief.

Charles nodded. "Yes, Mr. Mason Williams. I'm sure Mr. John Williams has heard the news too and is getting ready to take over the Brown Family's assets!"

Charles hoped Mason would jump at the chance to seize the Brown Family's assets. But instead, Mason frowned.

"Who do you think is behind this?" Mason asked.

Charles thought for a moment and shook his head. "I'm sorry, Mr. Williams, I really can't say. I only know Paxton was chasing certain people, but the police have sealed the info. The official story is that Paxton was killed by a pro hitman over a payment dispute."

Mason rolled his eyes. "Is Paxton short of money? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

Charles gave a bitter smile and shook his head. "None of us believe it either. But this time, Alan's right-hand man is in charge, and our informants at the station couldn't dig up anything else."

After a moment of hesitation, Mason sighed. "Go ahead and arrange to take over the Brown Family's assets quickly. Then send them to Isabella."

###chapter 449 I Killed Them

After Mason gave the orders, Charles wasted no time and headed downstairs to get things rolling.

They had to reach out to government officials and the top brass of the Brown Family's businesses. It was a team effort if they wanted to take control.

Meanwhile, John got the news too. Without missing a beat, he told his people to start taking over the Brown Family's assets and gave Bianca a heads-up.

When Bianca heard that Paxton and the rest of the family were dead, she was floored.

"How is this even possible? Paxton was the head of one of the big four families. How could he just die like that? And the whole family wiped out so quickly?" Bianca stared at John, stunned.

John shook his head, looking serious. "All I know is Paxton was chasing someone, but we don't know who. The cops have locked down the info, and Alan is taking it seriously this time. We haven't heard a thing. But whoever it is, they're ruthless."

Bianca went pale with fear. While others were clueless, she knew Paxton was after Isabella and her husband.

John didn't mention the fake diary entries, and Bianca had no idea about them either. Besides John, others had also faked diary entries.

Bianca thought their plan with the guy had worked.

'Who are Isabella and her husband? How could they be so terrifying? Did they really kill the whole family to take over? They're maniacs. Wait, I've pissed off Isabella so many times, is she coming for me next?' Bianca's mind was racing.

John saw Bianca's pale face and figured she was scared after hearing about Paxton and the family's grim fate.

"Don't worry, babe, I'll protect you. Our vineyard's security is way better than the Brown Family's," John reassured her, holding her close.

He wasn't lying. The other three major families were way stronger than Paxton's Brown Family. Paxton's crew were just a bunch of mercenaries, easy targets because they lacked discipline.

Bianca nodded. "Honey, with you saying that, I feel a lot better. I'm not afraid to die, but I worry about our baby. They haven't even seen the world yet."

She gently touched her belly.

John placed his hand on her belly too, feeling emotional. "Don't worry, if you ever feel like I can't protect you, I'll take you to my grandpa. Even if he doesn't like you, he'll protect you for the baby's sake."

Bianca, touched, nodded. "Honey, I'm a bit tired. I need to rest."

John helped her to the bedroom and then left the vineyard. He had to handle taking over the Brown Family's assets.

As soon as Bianca got into the bedroom, she whipped out her phone and called the man.

When he picked up, she blurted out, "Is Isabella still alive? Who's her husband? Why did everyone in the Brown Family die?"

The guy on the other end replied coolly, "I still don't know who her husband is, but he's definitely not just some regular guy. Are you worried he's coming after you?"

Bianca glanced at the bedroom door and hissed, "Aren't you scared? The entire Brown Family is dead. Anyone would be terrified of such a ruthless man!"

The man on the phone suddenly chuckled. "If you're worried about his brutality, relax. He only killed Paxton and Zoey."

Bianca was stunned, her brow furrowing in confusion. "You mean he only killed two people? Then who took out the rest of the Brown Family?"

"It was me," the voice on the phone said calmly. It was Paxton's steward, Jonah.

Bianca covered her mouth in shock, almost letting out a gasp.

"Why did you do this? Wouldn't it be better to leave those family members to deal with Isabella?" Bianca asked, baffled.

Jonah was silent for a moment, then sighed softly. "It's complicated. Someone handed all their criminal records to the police. Even if I didn't kill them, they would've been arrested. I was more worried they'd expose me. I had no choice but to silence them all."

Jonah's tone was so calm, like he was talking about a casual stroll in the park.

Bianca was terrified. She knew Jonah was ruthless, but this was next-level. She started worrying about her and her mom's safety.

Jonah seemed to read her mind and chuckled, "Worried I'll harm your mother? Relax, you're still useful to me, so I'll keep her safe."

Bianca let out a sigh of relief, but then felt a surge of resentment. She hated being used.

"Paxton's dead, what else can I do?" Bianca asked.

"Stay close to John. You're carrying his child, after all. I've always suspected Mason from the Williams Family is hiding something important from the Taylor Family. Find out what it is," Jonah instructed.

Bianca frowned, confused. "Shouldn't you be pushing me to get John to grab the Brown Family's assets? They originally belonged to the Taylor Family. If John gets them, Isabella can't."

Jonah sneered, "John can't do it. Even if the three major families teamed up, they couldn't. Don't underestimate Patrick from the Taylor Family. And those assets are useless to me. Just follow my instructions."

With that, Jonah hung up, leaving Bianca in shock.

###chapter 450 It Wasn't Me

Bianca was scratching her head, wondering why Jonah said John couldn't snag those industries. But it didn't take long for her to figure it out.

The news of the Brown Family's downfall hit like a bomb, spreading everywhere.

Pretty soon, everyone in town knew the Brown Family, the lowest-ranked of the four big families, had crumbled, even though the cops tried to keep it under wraps. But the police who nabbed the Brown Family members weren't Alan's kin. They spilled the beans, especially about the gruesome deaths.

The other three big families were stunned by the Brown Family's collapse, but they weren't dumb. They saw a golden chance to grab the Brown Family's assets.

At first, some smaller families thought they could snatch up some of the Brown Family's stuff, just like when the Taylor Family went down. The Brown Family had climbed to the top four by taking over most of the Taylor Family's assets.

But as soon as the big three families stepped in, the small fry got scared off because the prime suspect in the Brown Family murders was from one of the big three.

These smaller families didn't dare mess with the big three, scared that hitmen would come knocking at night and send them to meet their maker.

The small families cursed the big three. When the Taylor Family fell, at least no one got killed. They couldn't figure out what the Brown Family did to tick off the big three so much that they wiped them out.

The big three were just as clueless since they hadn't done it. But that didn't matter now; what mattered was grabbing the Brown Family's assets. Even though the small families were spooked by rumors, it was still a chance.

Just as the members of the three big families were about to enter the Brown Family's company, they were met with a wall of security personnel who had been waiting for them. The doors to the company were locked tight, keeping them firmly outside.

"What the hell are you doing? Do you know who's backing me? It's Mr. Williams! Only Mr. Williams can save you! Without the Brown Family's protection, you'll be torn apart by others." A lackey sent by John yelled at the door.

But the folks inside just laughed at him. "Go back and tell John he can't take anything from here. Everything here belongs to the Taylor Family."

"What did you say? The Taylor Family? Are you joking? They fell even before the Brown Family." John's lackey shouted, feeling mocked.

"Who told you we fell? We just went underground for a while. If you don't believe it, go watch the press conference." The guy turned and walked away, not giving him a chance to respond.

Even though John's lackey was fuming, he had no choice but to relay the message to John.

"What press conference?" John muttered, searching for info, and was shocked by what he found.

The other big families also got wind of the press conference and turned their attention to it.

The press conference was held in the Taylor Family's building, a huge venue.

Now, dozens of people were standing in the middle, with Carol front and center.

Reporters swarmed the scene, all brought in by Carol.

"Ms. Lester, why are you holding the press conference instead of Ms. Taylor?" one reporter asked.

Carol responded casually, "Ms. Taylor is handling other matters. Due to company confidentiality, we can't disclose more at this time."

"So, Ms. Lester, why have you gathered us here?" another reporter inquired.

Carol raised the microphone and said, "We're here to announce that the Taylor Family is reclaiming all the industries previously taken over by the Brown Family."

Carol's words hit the reporters like a bombshell.

They surged towards Carol but were kept at bay by security, maintaining a ten-foot distance.

Carol gestured to the people behind her. "These folks are all shareholders of the Brown Family's industries. While they aren't the largest shareholders, all the other shareholders have been killed, so their shares now belong to them. They've decided to donate all their shares to Ms. Taylor."

The atmosphere grew even more intense. Reporters went wild, trying to get closer to Carol, but security struggled to hold them back.

From a distance, reporters shouted at the top of their lungs.

"Ms. Lester, aren't you afraid of angering the other three major families?"

"Ms. Lester, you're moving so fast, did you already know about all this?"

"Ms. Lester, is the downfall of the Brown Family connected to you?"

What the reporters really wanted to ask was whether they were behind the deaths of so many Brown Family members. Otherwise, why were they so quick to hold a press conference and take over the Brown Family's industries right after their deaths?

Carol understood their implications. She calmly said, "We feel sorry for the Brown Family's fate. We hope the police can quickly catch those despicable criminals. As for offending the three major families? I don't see why you would think that. We're just reclaiming the industries that the Taylor Family once lost, which has nothing to do with the three major families."

Carol's message was clear: "It wasn't us, we don't know anything, and don't meddle in our family's business."

Meanwhile, in the hospital, Benjamin held up his phone in front of Michael, showing the live broadcast of the press conference.

"Did you do this? I know you're angry, but isn't this too ruthless? They were having a family meeting, and you just stormed in and killed them all? Besides, it hasn't been long since they died, and you're already eager to take over their industries." Benjamin looked at Michael in shock.

Michael's pale face showed a helpless expression. "I only killed Paxton and Zoey; I didn't kill their family members. The woman holding the press conference isn't my subordinate; she's technically Isabella's grandfather's subordinate."

Michael briefly explained part of Carol's identity to Benjamin.

Benjamin was stunned. "These old heads of the four major families are all crafty. It turns out the Brown Family had been infiltrated long ago. Maybe the Brown Family became one of the four major families in the first place thanks to Patrick's secret plan in the Taylor Family."

"What are you talking about?" Isabella walked into the ward carrying dinner.

###chapter 451 Sudden Visit

Isabella had just whipped up dinner for Michael, taken a shower, and slipped into a fresh set of clothes. Her old ones were filthy from dodging whoever was after her. Now, in clean clothes, she felt like she had a fresh start.

Benjamin decided to bring up the Brown Family with Michael since Isabella wasn't in the room.

"We're just chatting about some stuff going down at your company," Benjamin said, waving his phone in front of Isabella.

When Isabella saw Carol on the screen, she frowned and quickly grabbed the phone from Benjamin.

"Carol? What's she doing? A press conference? Wait, all the Brown Family members are dead? Are those shareholders all backing me now? Hold on, does that mean I'm now in charge of the Brown Family?" Isabella exclaimed, her eyes glued to the screen as she processed the shocking news. Each question tumbled out louder than the last.

Benjamin looked at her, puzzled. "Aren't you the CEO? How did you not know about this?"

Isabella shook her head. "I had no clue. Carol didn't even call me."

It wasn't that Isabella didn't want to call Carol; she was just too worried about Michael and had left her phone at the abandoned factory.

Seeing Isabella's worried face, Benjamin joked, "Looks like your employees don't want you! Such a big deal and they didn't even tell you, the CEO!"

"No, I need to call Carol and find out what's going on," Isabella said, reaching for her phone, only to realize Carol's number wasn't in her contacts.

Benjamin, sitting by the bed, asked, "Maybe you grabbed my phone, and it doesn't have Carol's number?"

Isabella realized her mistake.

"Looks like I need to head to the office." She handed the phone back to Benjamin and was about to leave when Michael's voice stopped her.

"Darling, you can't go," Michael said softly.

Isabella turned to him, sighing. "I know you don't want me to, but I have to go to the office and sort this out."

Michael shook his head. "No, darling, you misunderstood. I'm not stopping you. I mean wait until after the press conference, then talk to Carol."

Isabella looked at him, confused.

"Carol already told the reporters you couldn't attend for special reasons. Right now, most people think you had something to do with the Brown Family deaths. If you say the wrong thing at the press conference, it could mess up Carol's plan and even put the blame on you," Michael explained.

Isabella thought it over. Michael had a point; going now wouldn't change anything.

Benjamin chimed in, "Michael's right. Carol's the one your grandpa trusted; she wouldn't harm you. She probably didn't tell you because it was urgent. I'm sure she tried to reach you but couldn't, so she had to handle it herself."

Benjamin was spot on. Carol did try to reach out to Isabella, but since Isabella didn't have her phone, Carol couldn't get through. Not knowing which hospital Isabella was at, Carol informed Joe, hoping he could contact Michael and pass the message along.

Unfortunately, Michael missed the call because he was resting.

In the end, Isabella realized Michael was right. She just couldn't wrap her head around the fact that Carol had done all this without telling her.

Even if she found Carol, she'd just be asking for details. The outcome seemed to be in her favor anyway. She had already gained control of most of the Brown Family's assets, seemingly bringing her family back into the ranks of the four major families.

"Okay, babe, I'll wait until after the press conference to talk to Carol," Isabella sighed.

She sat back down by Michael's bedside, but a new worry gnawed at her.

"Darling, why did all the members of the Brown Family die? Could it be because of you?" Isabella looked at Michael with suspicion.

After all, Michael had admitted to turning Pearl into that miserable state, and Paxton had sent people to chase them. With Michael's character, he wouldn't just let them go easily.

Michael hesitated for a moment and whispered, "I did have Paxton and Zoey killed, but I really didn't touch the other members of their family. Their deaths seem strange to me too."

Isabella looked at Michael with suspicion but ultimately chose to believe him. As Michael said, since he had already killed Paxton and Zoey, there was no need to hide if he had killed the others.

"Could this be Carol's doing, or the influence left by your grandpa?" Benjamin speculated, clearly intrigued by the situation.

Indeed, Carol and the forces behind her were suspicious. But Isabella felt that something was off about this whole situation.

If Carol and her team could easily transfer all of the Brown Family's assets back to the Taylor Family in such a short time, why wait until now? And someone capable of wiping out a whole family wouldn't worry about Paxton.

"I feel like there's another conspiracy behind this, but we need to investigate carefully," Michael said, echoing Isabella's thoughts.

Isabella thought of Brenda, wondering if she had returned. If she investigated, she might be able to find out more information.

Meanwhile, as the press conference unfolded, the other three big families were in a panic.

"The Brown Family's assets were easily taken over by the Taylor Family? This is unbelievable! Damn the Taylor Family, they've been quietly infiltrating. Investigate the industries we acquired from the Taylor Family!" the head of the Larson Family ordered his subordinates.

###chapter 452 Worries

Not just the head of the Larson Family was thinking this way, but the leaders of the Davis Family and even John were on the same page.

The Taylor Family's takeover of the Brown Family's business was lightning fast, almost like it happened overnight. When the Taylor Family fell, these families scooped up a lot of their business, which now had them all on edge.

That night, the companies that used to belong to the Taylor Family but were now under the control of the three big families were all being investigated. People who used to work for the Taylor Family were getting the boot.

Some of the fired employees were pretty ticked off and even started protesting, but they were quickly shut down. With nowhere else to turn, they reached out to friends still in the Taylor Family's companies, hoping to get their old jobs back.

When Carol heard about this, she just smirked and had all the Taylor Family folks who got canned by the three big families brought back.

Among them were some top-notch talents, but the three big families, scared of spies, fired everyone without a second thought. Now, all these skilled people were back with the Taylor Family.

Carol kept smirking to herself because the reaction of the three big families was way over the top. When Patrick from the Taylor Family was plotting, he only had his sights set on the Brown Family.

Paxton never thought he'd be able to take over the Taylor Family's business so easily and become one of the big four families. In reality, it was all part of Patrick's plan, and his family had been secretly infiltrated by the Taylor Family.

Even though the three big families regretted losing these talents, they knew it was necessary to stop the same thing from happening to their own companies.

And all of this actually went down days ago.

Through Joe, Carol finally found out where Isabella and the others were in the hospital. She went there, met with Isabella, and filled her in on everything that had happened.

"So, all of this was set up by my grandpa, right?" Isabella sighed, fiddling with the bronze ring on her hand.

Carol nodded. "Yep, your grandpa arranged all of this. Even the Brown Family becoming one of the big four was his doing."

"Why did my grandpa do this?" Isabella asked, looking at Carol seriously.

Carol shook her head with a bitter smile. "I'm sorry, Ms. Taylor. I really don't know why your grandpa did this. But I think someone else might."

"Who?" Isabella asked, curious.

Carol shook her head again. "He's looking into some things. He said he can't meet with you yet, but he'll come see you once he figures it out in a few days."

"Is it a man? Okay, I'll wait for him," Isabella nodded, deciding not to dwell on it for now.

"Well, Ms. Taylor, if you have a moment, please come back to the company and help out. I'm drowning here. I gotta go," Carol sighed. Taking over the Taylor Family's business had blown up the industry's scale, making her workload skyrocket, especially with Isabella being MIA.

Carol shot Isabella a resentful glance, grabbed a few strands of her own hair, placed them in Isabella's hand, and left.

Isabella stared at the hair in her hand, totally confused about what Carol was trying to say.

Not long after Carol left, Benjamin showed up.

Seeing the hair in Isabella's hand, Benjamin asked, "What's up with the hair?"

Isabella explained what Carol had done.

Benjamin chuckled after thinking for a moment. "I think Carol's trying to tell you that if your husband's doing okay, you should get back to the company and help her out! Staying up late and working overtime with no sleep can make you lose hair."

Isabella was taken aback for a second, then shook her head with a wry smile. "That might not be possible. Michael's health isn't great right now. I want to stay here and take care of him for a few more days."

Benjamin looked at Isabella with a playful glint in his eyes.

Others might not know about Michael's condition, but as his doctor, Benjamin knew it all too well.

Given Michael's status, he was on the best and most expensive meds, which were top-notch for recovery and treatment. Plus, with Michael being in his prime, he didn't really need Isabella's care.

Michael lay in bed, occasionally coughing to get Isabella's sympathy and keep her by his side.

Standing at the door of the ward, Benjamin leaned against the door frame, watching Isabella feed Michael oatmeal spoon by spoon.

'What a sly guy,' Benjamin thought to himself about Michael's antics.

Suddenly, Benjamin noticed a bunch of medical staff running downstairs, some even shouting.

Frowning, Benjamin stopped a nurse and asked, "What's going on? Why's everyone running?"

The nurse replied, "Mr. Williams is here. He heard that Ms. Taylor and her husband are hospitalized here, so he came to visit. The hospital director asked us to go out and greet him. After all, Mr. Williams is one of the hospital's shareholders."

Hearing this, Benjamin's eyes widened. He didn't stop the nurse anymore and immediately ran into the ward.

Isabella was still feeding Michael.

Benjamin cleared his throat, and once he had Isabella's attention, he said calmly, "Isabella, Mason heard you were here and he's worried about you. He's outside right now. Do you want to see him?"

Isabella looked surprised, and Michael's eyes narrowed slightly.

"Mason's here? I have to see him. Honey, wait for me here," Isabella said, rushing out of the ward.

Michael looked at Benjamin seriously. "Mason really came?"

Benjamin nodded. "Seems like it. So, what's your next move?"

###chapter 453 Escape

Benjamin shot Michael a playful look.

Michael ignored him, tossed the blanket aside, and hopped out of bed.

"Seriously? You're supposed to be resting, not jumping around. Shouldn't you be waiting for your lovely wife to pamper you?" Benjamin kept teasing.

Michael rolled his eyes. "This isn't the time for jokes. Isabella can't find out who I really am. Where's the back door? I need to get out of here."

Benjamin walked over to the window, took a peek outside, and sighed. "We're close to the back door, but those guys in black suits? They're definitely Mason's men. He's here for you, no doubt."

Michael pulled the curtain back and took a careful look. Sure enough, there were several stern-looking guards by the back door.

His face darkened. He recognized those guards; they were Mason's top guys.

"Looks like Mason's here just for you, and he's making sure you don't slip away. What's the plan?" Benjamin raised an eyebrow, smirking.

Michael shot him an annoyed look. "You must have a plan. Spill it. How do I get out of here?"

"Alright, alright. Follow me." Benjamin saw the urgency in Michael's eyes and shrugged, leading him out of the room.

Downstairs, Mason listened to the guards' report with a calm expression. "Mr. Williams, all exits are sealed, and the medical staff are ready to welcome you."

Mason hadn't initially heard about the attack on Isabella and her husband, but the news eventually leaked from the police station. Whether Police Chief Alan had done it on purpose or not, the four big families found out that Paxton's death was linked to his attack on Isabella and her husband.

Mason was frantic when he heard about the assassination attempt. He quickly found out which hospital Isabella was in and rushed over with his men. But his curiosity about Isabella's husband grew, leading him to take drastic measures like sealing off the entire hospital.

'I hope my suspicions are wrong, dear nephew,' Mason thought, his gaze deep and troubled.

Isabella walked out of the hospital building, spotting Mason. She ran up to him, smiling.

"Mason, what brings you here?" she asked, holding his hand.

Mason looked at her kindly. "I heard about the attack on you and your husband. I had to check on you."

"I'm so sorry, Mason. I didn't mean to worry you," Isabella said, feeling guilty. She didn't want Mason to know about the incident, fearing it might worsen his already fragile health.

"I'd rather you come to me directly when you hit a rough patch, so I can help out while I'm still around. But it looks like you've already handled things," Mason teased with a grin.

Isabella, feeling a bit embarrassed, scratched her head. "Mason, I'll be straight with you. I didn't kill Paxton, Zoey, or any of the Brown Family. I think someone's trying to set me up."

Mason gave her a long look. He could only half-believe what she was saying, but he wasn't mad. Being cautious with unknown enemies was always smart.

"You look fine, not too banged up, so that's a relief. But I heard your husband got pretty messed up. I'll go check on him and meet him," Mason said, smiling at Isabella.

Isabella hesitated. She wasn't thrilled about Mason meeting Michael, who might have already drawn too much attention.

"Are you worried I'll hurt him or blow his cover?" Mason asked with a faint smile.

Shaking her head, Isabella replied, "If it were anyone else, I'd say no, but I trust you. Let's go this way, Mason."

Mason followed Isabella upstairs. Along the way, many medical staff greeted them.

Mason nodded back and noticed other subordinates in patient gowns wandering around.

Mason usually kept a low profile, but this time he was making a scene because he was worried that if Michael was indeed Isabella's husband, he might try to slip away disguised as medical staff.

Meanwhile, Michael was getting ready to escape. But when he saw the disguise Benjamin had prepared, he looked disgusted.

"Do I really have to wear this nasty outfit? Did you pull it off a corpse?" Michael wrinkled his nose, glaring at Benjamin.

Rolling his eyes, Benjamin replied, "Quit whining. If we waste any more time, we'll get caught. This outfit is specially prepared. It's sprayed with a super gross-smelling liquid. But don't worry, it won't mess with your wounds. Once you're on the stretcher, I'll do your makeup to make you look like you have a severe infectious disease. The guards won't dare to check you."

Michael hesitated but knew Benjamin's plan was worth a shot.

"Alright, let's do it." Michael put on the stinky outfit and lay down on the stretcher.

Benjamin quickly grabbed his makeup kit and started working on Michael's face.

In less than two minutes, Benjamin was done.

"Wow, you look like a middle-aged guy who got wrecked by a nasty disease. It's pretty convincing," Benjamin said, pinching his nose.

"Can we go now? I'm about to suffocate in this thing," Michael urged impatiently.

Smiling, Benjamin changed into a protective suit and pushed Michael towards the back door. But as soon as they got there, Mason's guards stopped them.

###chapter 454 Infectious Disease

Two bodyguards blocked Benjamin's path, but they caught a whiff of something seriously nasty.

"Sorry, no one's leaving this hospital right now," one of them said, all serious.

Benjamin, decked out in protective gear, looked super stressed. "Move it, I've got something really important to do."

"Doesn't matter how important it is, you can't leave," the other bodyguard said, ice-cold.

"Where the hell are you guys from? This is a hospital! The person I'm pushing is a walking biohazard! I need to get this body to the incinerator, like, now," Benjamin said, trying to push the stretcher forward.

The bodyguards blocked him again.

"Get out of my way, don't stop me," Benjamin shouted, getting pissed and trying to shove past them.

The bodyguards, eyeing Benjamin's protective gear, seemed to catch on just as the blanket on the stretcher slipped off.

There were some onlookers-patients and their families-around. But when they saw the body on the stretcher, they freaked out and started screaming.

"What kind of disease is that? It smells awful."

"Damn, that face is terrifying. Is it some serious virus?"

"Oh my god, I can smell it. Am I infected too? Will I turn into a zombie?"

"Mom, I'm scared!"

Michael, lying on the stretcher, was unrecognizable. His skin was a creepy grayish-white with nasty red patches, dots, and bruises.

The stench coming off Michael was so bad, even the bodyguards looked like they wanted to bolt.

"What the hell have you guys done?" Benjamin grabbed the blanket from the ground, covering Michael's body again.

"This guy caught HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and a bunch of other nasty diseases from sleeping with 50 prostitutes. He's a walking infection. Do you want to catch this stuff? And lose your junk?" Benjamin yelled, furious.

The men around backed off, covering their groins with both hands.

Under the blanket, Michael felt like jumping up and strangling Benjamin.

The bodyguards instinctively tightened their legs and pinched their noses.

"Damn, we've already smelled it. Are we infected?" one bodyguard asked, worried, looking at Benjamin.

Benjamin waved his hand. "Just from smelling it, you need some fresh air. But if you touch him, you're screwed!"

Benjamin checked the time and shouted, "Get out of the way! This virus has a high mortality rate. Do you want everyone in this hospital to die because of this guy?"

The patients' families around them screamed.

"Which department are you two idiots from? I'm going to report you."

"What right do you have to stop a doctor? Do you know more than him?"

"Get out of here, idiots, we don't want to die." The bystanders yelled angrily at the bodyguards.

The two bodyguards were freaked out, not just about catching this deadly bug, but also worried Mason might get infected.

"Enough, get out of here. Get this guy to the incinerator, now. I don't want to see him another second," one of the guards finally said, waving Benjamin off with a look of disgust.

Not wasting any time, Benjamin hurriedly pushed the stretcher towards a nearby ambulance.

In no time, Benjamin and a few of his men lifted the stretcher into the ambulance and hopped in.

The siren blared as the ambulance sped away from the hospital.

After it left, the two bodyguards exchanged uneasy glances.

"Should we tell Mr. Williams about this?" one of them asked.

The other nodded. "Yeah, but should we wash our hands first? I feel like we might infect him with something."

After a moment of hesitation, they decided to make the call, figuring electronic signals couldn't spread germs.

Guided by Isabella, Mason finally reached Michael's ward.

But Michael wasn't in the bed.

"Weird, where'd he go?" Isabella looked puzzled at the empty bed and pulled out her phone to call Michael.

Mason touched the bed, feeling its warmth. "He must've just left. Didn't you say he was too hurt to get up?"

Isabella started to worry. Michael's acting was so good, she even wondered if he might've been kidnapped.

Meanwhile, Michael was playing dead and didn't answer Isabella's calls.

After several tries, Isabella decided to call Benjamin, but his phone was also unreachable. She began to panic.

"Is there trouble? If you need help, I'll send someone to find him," Mason said seriously, looking at Isabella.

Just as Isabella was about to ask for Mason's help, her phone rang. It was Michael.

She answered immediately.

"Darling, where are you? Why aren't you in the ward?" Isabella asked, anxious.

In the ambulance, Michael held his nose while making the call. His clothes reeked, and holding his nose also changed his voice.

"Sorry, babe, I had some urgent stuff at the office. Plus, I'm almost better. I can walk now. I pretended to be weak so you'd take care of me a bit longer. I'm sorry for being selfish," Michael admitted.

Isabella sighed in relief. At least he wasn't kidnapped.

"Why does your voice sound weird?" Isabella asked, confused.

Michael, still holding his nose, replied, "I took a cab. The driver must've just eaten canned sardines; his breath is awful. I'm holding my nose while talking to you."

###chapter 455 Testing

Michael had a hard time explaining everything over the phone, guessing Mason was probably right next to Isabella.

Mason, of course, heard the voice on the phone and was puzzled because it didn't sound like Michael.

But after hearing Michael's explanation, a cold smile crept onto Mason's lips.

"Well, dear, take care. Since I don't need to worry about you anymore, I should head back to the office to handle some things." Isabella sighed softly and hung up.

"Sorry, Mason, I can't let you see my husband." Isabella shrugged, looking at Mason with a hint of guilt.

Mason smiled at her and said, "It's okay, it seems like your husband doesn't really want to see me either."

Isabella smiled awkwardly. She wasn't a fool and could figure it out. Michael seemed to be consciously avoiding Mason.

She thought Michael didn't want to show up because he was worried Mason would investigate his identity and cause trouble.

Mason wasn't ready to give up. Suddenly, he thought of something and said to Isabella with a smile, "I heard you and your husband took wedding photos abroad? I've always wanted to see what you looked like on your wedding day, but you haven't had the wedding yet. Can you show me the photos?"

Isabella shook her head, feeling embarrassed. "Sorry, Mason, I lost my phone when I was being chased. This phone is new and doesn't have the photos. But I have a backup on my computer, I'll send them when I get home."

A hint of disappointment flashed in Mason's eyes.

"Well, in that case, I'll leave for now. If you need help with the Brown Family's affairs, just let me know. Speak up while I'm still alive." Mason gently stroked Isabella's hair, his eyes full of affectionate kindness.

Isabella nodded, moved. "Don't worry, Mason. If I need your help, I won't hesitate to ask."

Satisfied, Mason left the hospital room.

Just as Mason was about to leave the hospital, he suddenly remembered something. He stopped, turned to look at Isabella, and asked with a smile, "By the way, what's your husband's name? I'm curious."

Isabella hesitated for a moment and nodded. "His name is Michael."

Isabella didn't lie, nor was she worried about Mason investigating. There were many people named Michael.

Isabella didn't notice Mason's eyes narrow slightly. He smiled at her, then turned and got into his car.

Isabella watched Mason leave. After he was gone, she completed Michael's discharge procedures and then went to the company.

Not long after Mason got into the car, he received a call from his bodyguards. They reported two people had left the hospital: a doctor in protective clothing and a body with a contagious disease.

A cold smile appeared on Mason's lips. "To avoid me, they even pretended to be a corpse with a contagious disease? Such disgusting tactics."

Mason pulled out his phone and called Michael directly. The phone rang twice before Michael's calm voice came through.

"What's up, Mason? Need something?" Michael asked, sounding puzzled.

With a smile, Mason said, "I need to discuss something with you. It's not something I can talk about over the phone. Come to the Williams Villa."

Before Michael could refuse, Mason hung up.

By now, Michael had changed his clothes, but his brows were furrowed tightly.

"Mason must have noticed something. He's testing me. What should I do?" Michael said, looking at Benjamin.

Benjamin hesitated for a moment and said, "If you're worried about your wound being exposed, I have a solution, but I don't recommend it."

Michael raised an eyebrow, listening quietly to Benjamin's suggestion.

An hour later, Michael, dressed in a sharp suit, arrived at the Williams Villa. Mason was already waiting for him.

Upon seeing Mason, Michael sat down on the sofa opposite him with a smile.

"What's up? Why did you call me here urgently? I have a lot of things to handle at my company," Michael said.

With a slight smile, Mason looked at Michael and asked, "I heard your wife was attacked by the Brown Family and her mental state is very unstable. Why aren't you spending more time with her?"

Michael looked at Mason with surprise, thinking Mason was testing him. Then he realized Mason was referring to Estella, not Isabella.

"Estella is not as fragile as you think. She just doesn't want to deal with the boring questions from the police. We already told her about the troubles she might encounter when we got married, and she accepted it all. So you don't need to worry about her," Michael said calmly.

A cold smile appeared on Mason's lips. "Among the troubles she might encounter, does that include the possibility of her being killed while acting as bait by pretending to be your wife?"

Michael's brows furrowed. "Mason, I don't understand what you mean."

Mason sneered, "How long are you going to hide from me? I already know. Isabella's mysterious husband is actually you! Estella is just a decoy you used to conceal Isabella's identity."

Michael's tone turned displeased. He looked at Mason and said, "Mason, I don't know where you got this idea from, but I hope you're smarter than to be deceived by others."

Angry, Mason slapped his thigh and stared at Michael coldly, saying, "Yesterday, you disguised yourself as a corpse with a contagious disease and escaped from the hospital. I specifically asked the hospital director, and he clearly told me that their hospital would never have such a terrible contagious disease, so it's all fake."

Michael remained calm. "I don't know what happened at the hospital that day to make you misunderstand, but do you have any evidence?"

Mason squinted and said, "Isabella told me her husband's name is Michael!"

Michael's fist clenched instantly.

###chapter 456 The Truth from Back Then

Mason noticed the way Michael's hands moved and a lightbulb went off in his head. Looked like his hunch was right, and his nephew was finally cracking.

But then, out of nowhere, Michael jumped up from the couch, glaring daggers at Mason.

"Mason, I have no idea why you're thinking such crazy things. My name isn't one-of-a-kind; lots of people have it. There's nothing weird about that," Michael snapped, clearly pissed off.

Mason was caught off guard, not expecting such a fiery reaction.

He felt a wave of frustration. He was almost sure Michael was Isabella's husband, but he had no proof.

"If you dragged me here just to spout this nonsense, I'm outta here," Michael said, turning to leave.

Mason went quiet for a bit, then suddenly grinned at Michael.

"Hold up, Michael, don't be in such a hurry. I was just messing with you. Think of me as a confused old man," Mason said, stopping him.

Michael paused and turned back to look at Mason.

Leaning on his cane, Mason walked over to Michael with a smile. He sighed and said, "I actually called you here for something else. It's about Isabella. I didn't expect her to take control of the Taylor Family's business empire so quickly. She might need some help."

But Michael shook his head. "Mason, I've heard about Isabella's situation. She's got most of her family's power now, and her influence is almost on par with the big four families. I don't think she needs any help right now."

Mason nodded, Michael had a point. Isabella had the company, wealth, power, and loyal people left by Patrick, which explained the ongoing absorption of the Brown Family's wealth.

But Mason had other concerns.

"I'm not asking you to help her run the company. She doesn't need that. What I need you to do is keep an eye out for any threats to Isabella," Mason said seriously.

"Are you saying she's in danger? I heard she was attacked. Was it Paxton?" Michael asked.

Mason had previously told Michael at a family gathering that he saw Isabella as his true granddaughter and wanted Michael to protect her.

Mason nodded. "Yeah, it was Paxton, but he's not the mastermind."

Mason's tone was grave, his expression darkening. "Paxton's just a pawn. There's someone else pulling the strings. Don't you think it's odd how the Taylor Family fell from grace so quickly? There's gotta be a reason."

Michael's expression was just as serious, and he didn't deny Mason's words. He and Isabella had talked about this issue countless times. But their plans weren't something they'd share with Mason, so he played along, pretending to be unsure.

"I've been thinking about this a lot. What kind of trouble did Patrick from the Taylor Family get into that led him to dissolve the family? And now, some of the scattered factions are coming back together. Why has all this happened in just a few years? There's got to be something more to it," Michael speculated.

Mason nodded, clearly on the same page as Michael.

"So, what I need from you is to help Isabella if she faces danger again, and maybe even dig up the truth from back then. Only by knowing these things can we really protect her." Mason patted Michael's shoulder, his tone serious.

Michael hesitated for a moment, then finally asked the question that had been bugging him.

"Mason, why haven't you been as kind to John as you have to Isabella?" Michael looked at Mason, hoping for an answer.

Even though Michael had a pretty good idea of the answer, he still wanted to hear it straight from Mason. Kenna had refused to tell him and had suggested he ask Mason himself. Today, Michael finally got his chance.

Mason hesitated. He didn't really want to dig up the past, but after a moment of silence, he decided to spill the beans.

"It's nothing special, just some old, embarrassing emotional stuff." Mason lightly tapped his cane, his eyes filled with memories.

"Your dad, Isabella's grandpa, and I went to the same university. We were tight until your dad and I both fell for the same girl. We competed like crazy for her love, and our friendship went down the drain. One day, we got into a fight over something stupid and ended up in the hospital. Later, we found out that the girl chose Isabella's grandpa," Mason said, a hint of regret in his eyes.

Michael's lips twitched slightly. He had guessed right; it was indeed a love triangle between three old men.

"That girl was really kind. The main reason she married Isabella's grandpa was that she was worried about the strained relationship between your dad and me. Your dad couldn't handle it, so when the family expanded overseas, he left and never came back. I stayed and took over the family business. I wanted Isabella to marry John to make up for my youthful regrets. Isabella looks so much like her grandma," Mason said, his eyes slightly red.

After a moment of silence, Michael said, "Mason, is it possible that you've got it all wrong?"

Mason was taken aback. "Got what wrong?"

Michael said calmly, "Isabella's grandma didn't marry someone else because she was afraid you two would become enemies. She just thought your jealousy was too childish."

###chapter 457 Not Painful at All

Michael threw out his theory, and Mason's face instantly turned stormy.

Michael kept going, acting like he didn't notice. "Only animals fight like crazy during mating season, trying to impress the ladies. But, you know, animals aren't exactly known for their smarts compared to us humans."

As Michael wrapped up, he saw Mason's face had gone from bad to worse. Inside, Michael was doing a little victory dance. This was exactly what he wanted. Mason had always been suspicious of him.

"You and your dad really make people want to strangle you sometimes," Mason suddenly blurted out.

Michael just rubbed his nose, staying silent.

Mason gave his cane a hard tap and let out a long sigh. "Actually, you've got a point. Back in the day, when I was chasing after Isabella's grandma, we did a lot of stuff we thought was romantic but was actually pretty dumb."

"What kind of stuff?" Michael asked, curiosity all over his face.

"I once put covers on every street lamp at school. When the lights came on, they projected lines of text on the ground through holes in the covers. Each line was a love poem I wrote to Isabella's grandma," Mason reminisced, a flicker of happiness in his eyes.

"And then, knowing my dad, he must've messed it up, right?" Michael's curiosity grew.

"That jerk found out about my plan and swapped my lampshades with ads for nearby shops. Not only did I fail to impress Isabella's grandma, but he also made some advertising money!" Mason glared at Michael, seeing a bit of that old Kenna in him.

Michael almost lost it, covering his mouth to stifle his laughter. It was classic Kenna, even if he was more mellow now.

But Mason's anger quickly faded, replaced by a mischievous grin. "You think I just took that lying down? Your dad set up a beautiful fireworks display, planning to play a love song over the school's PA system at the peak moment. Guess what I did?"

Michael's mouth twitched as he guessed, "Did you pour water into those fireworks?"

Mason slapped Michael's chest. "Bingo, nephew! I drilled tiny holes in each batch of his fireworks and poured water in. So when his fireworks went off, all they did was puff out black smoke! And I also snuck into the broadcasting room and swapped his love song with pig squeals!"

Thinking back, Mason burst into laughter, looking at Michael.

Michael's face didn't change much, just a hint of helplessness and a wry smile. "In some ways, you both were pretty childish back then."

After a good laugh, Mason shook his head, his face returning to normal. "That's all ancient history. Over the years, I think your dad's forgiven me, and I've forgiven him. Otherwise, he wouldn't have let you come here."

After saying that, Mason's face turned serious. He looked Michael straight in the eye and said, "You gotta remember what I told you. I'm good to Isabella because she reminds me so much of her grandma. And before her grandma passed, she asked me to look after Isabella. It's a promise I made, and I hope you can help me keep it."

Michael hesitated, then asked, "Mason, do you really trust me with this? Isabella's grandma was your first love, not mine."

"Well, she was also your dad's first love. You listen to your dad, right? I don't think he'd turn down my request," Mason said, a knowing smile creeping onto his face.

Michael shot back, "My dad might have had feelings for Isabella's grandma, but not as deep as yours. He loved my mom a lot."

Mason gave Michael a puzzled look. "I didn't make it to your dad's wedding, but he sent me photos. Haven't you noticed Isabella looks a bit like your mom?"

Michael froze. He thought hard about Isabella's face and then pictured his mom, Audrey.

His expression turned strange, his brow furrowing.

'Did my dad marry someone who looked like Isabella's grandma? Is my mom just a stand-in?' Michael suddenly felt a pang of resentment towards Kenna.

"Alright, whether it's my request or your dad's, I hope you can help Isabella when she needs it. I believe you can. It's a promise between us men," Mason said, giving Michael a firm pat on the chest.

Michael's face stayed serious. He nodded. "As long as it doesn't mess with my interests, I'll help Isabella find out who's behind all this."

Mason raised an eyebrow at Michael's expression, then waved his hand. "Well, I came to see you just for this. I'm a bit tired, so I'll rest now."

Michael nodded goodbye to Mason and left the Williams Villa.

Not long after, he ran into Benjamin.

Benjamin hopped into Michael's car and asked, "How'd it go? Did Mason get suspicious?"

Michael nodded. "Yeah, he did, but I managed to throw him off. I probably can't keep it up for long. Sooner or later, he'll figure out I'm Isabella's husband. He even punched my chest a few times to test me."

Everyone knew Isabella's husband had been shot in the chest and the wound hadn't healed.

Mason wanted to see if Michael would flinch in pain when his chest was hit.

"Good thing the meds I gave you worked, but you might be in for a rough time later," Benjamin said, shaking his head.

"It's fine, I can handle it," Michael said with a brief smile, though his face turned pale and cold sweat started to bead on his forehead.

###chapter 458 Father?

Michael had a hunch that Mason would trace the wound to figure out who he really was.

So, Michael hit up Benjamin, who knew about this drug that could numb the pain in his chest for a bit. The only problem was that this medication had some pretty severe side effects: once the numbing effect wore off, the pain came back even stronger.

Now, Michael was in agony. His eyes were rolling back, sweat was pouring down his forehead, and the veins on his hands were popping out.

"Jesus, it feels like someone dipped their hand in hot sauce and is pressing on my wound," Michael groaned, tears almost spilling out.

Benjamin sat next to him, looking helpless. He shrugged.

"I'm sorry, but for now, the only option is for you to tough it out. I didn't give you a big dose, so it won't last long. Just ten more minutes," Benjamin said with a slight smirk.

Michael clenched his fists, his face twisted in pain.

"Alright, let's talk about something to take your mind off it. Maybe it'll help," Benjamin suggested, softening up a bit. They were childhood friends, after all.

Michael shot him a glare. "What do you want to talk about?"

Benjamin rubbed his chin, looking a bit serious. "Lately, I feel like there's something off between me and Amelia. We're still in the honeymoon phase, but she seems distracted."

Michael, still in pain, asked, "How'd you figure that out?"

Benjamin threw up his hands. "I mentioned visiting her parents, but she always hesitates. Her mom's getting treatment at the hospital where I work, so I've met her. But whenever her dad comes up, she dodges the topic."

Michael rolled his eyes. "Do you really need to ask? Her dad probably did something to piss her and her mom off. That's why she avoids it."

Benjamin nodded. "Yeah, I think so too, but she won't talk about it. I don't want to ask her mom directly; she'll think I'm being nosy. What should I do?"

Michael sneered. "Is it that hard? After you and Amelia have sex, she's most relaxed. Offer to help her then, and she'll open up. Then you can help her sort it out."

Benjamin's eyes widened in disbelief.

"How do you know that? Sounds kinda sneaky," Benjamin said, eyeing Michael suspiciously.

Michael snorted, feeling the pain ease a bit. He opened the car's rear window, letting in some cold air, which helped dull the pain.

Lying on the back seat with his eyes closed, Michael said, "Isabella's the same way. After we have our moments, she opens up about her past. Women are sensitive and fragile, not as mentally tough as us. They need a little nudge to talk about their problems. Give them some courage and support."

Benjamin looked at Michael in shock, then gave him a thumbs up. "You're right, I'll give it a shot tonight."

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Tonight? Isn't it your girlfriend's time of the month?"

Benjamin thought for a second and nodded. "Yeah, it is. Guess I'll have to wait a few more days."

Then it hit him. He stared at Michael, eyes wide. "How do you know about my girlfriend's time of the month?"

Michael smirked. "Don't forget, my wife and your girlfriend are tight. My wife mentioned on the phone that she found this great fitness routine that can enhance breasts and slim down, and it can be done during that time. Amelia's trying it out. I'm not deaf."

Benjamin scratched his head, remembering Amelia had mentioned that fitness routine recently.

"Looks like I'll have to wait another week," Benjamin said, sounding defeated.

Just then, Benjamin's phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID and frowned. It was the bodyguard he had secretly arranged for Amelia.

Amelia's job was pretty normal, and having a bodyguard would raise eyebrows. So she refused Benjamin's offer to assign one, but he was still worried about her safety and secretly arranged a female bodyguard for her.

Benjamin answered the call, and what he heard made him frown even more.

"Okay, got it. I'll be there right away," Benjamin said, hanging up.

Michael noticed Benjamin's grim expression. "What's wrong?"

Benjamin said in a low voice, "The bodyguard I set up for Amelia called. Amelia's in trouble at work. Some guy claiming to be her dad showed up demanding alimony. She refused, and he caused a scene, even tried to lay hands on her, but the bodyguard stopped him."

Michael immediately told the driver to head to Amelia's company.

When they arrived, Michael pointed to his chest. "I won't go up with you. I'm a patient, remember?"

"You don't need to come up for this. If a fight breaks out and you get hit in the chest and pass out, what will Isabella do when she asks me about you? You're hurt, your wife is unhappy, then my girlfriend won't be happy, and most importantly, I won't be happy either," Benjamin said, rolling his eyes as he jumped out of the car.

Michael smiled, about to leave, but then hesitated. After a moment, he decided to go upstairs anyway.

###chapter 459 Alcoholism and Domestic Violence

Benjamin burst into Amelia's company and made a beeline for the elevator, jabbing the button like his life depended on it. He had to find out what kind of mess Amelia was in.

As the elevator climbed, Benjamin's eyes were glued to the floor numbers, his anxiety growing with each passing second.

The elevator stopped midway, and two people got in.

"Did you hear about the guy who stormed the 23rd floor looking for his daughter? Wants money or something," one of them said.

"Yeah, I heard about that. He was drunk and causing a scene. Even the security guards couldn't handle him," the other replied.

"So, what's happening now? If the guards can't deal with him, are they calling the cops?" the first one asked.

The second person shrugged. "No idea, but that floor's off-limits now. The police should be on their way. Poor woman, having such a violent dad."

They got off on the 20th floor, leaving Benjamin even more on edge as the numbers ticked up to 23. 'Amelia, please be okay. Who the hell is this guy? Is he really your dad? If he hurts you, I'll make him pay!' Benjamin thought, his face darkening with anger.

When the elevator doors opened on the 23rd floor, two security guards were waiting. They blocked Benjamin as he tried to step out.

"Sorry, sir, this floor is off-limits right now," one of them said.

Benjamin shoved the guard aside. "Move! I need to find my girlfriend."

Ignoring their protests, he pushed past them, heading straight for Amelia's workspace.

"Amelia, are you okay? I'm here!" he shouted as he burst into her office.

The guards were still trailing behind, but Benjamin's concern for Amelia had him moving too fast for them to keep up. When he finally reached her, he was stunned into silence.

"Amelia, are you alright?" he asked, seeing her unharmed.

Amelia, protected by the female bodyguard Benjamin had hired, looked perfectly fine.

She rolled her eyes. "From the way you sound, do you actually want something to happen to me?"

Benjamin scratched his head, embarrassed. "I heard you were in danger, so I rushed over. I'm just glad you're okay."

Seeing his awkwardness, Amelia's eyes softened with happiness and gratitude.

"I'm really fine, but he might not be," she said, pointing to a middle-aged man on the floor.

The man, disheveled and reeking of booze, was pinned down by a woman, his joints twisted painfully, making him yelp with every move."Ouch, it hurts! Get this damn woman off me!" the man on the ground yelled.

Benjamin let out a sigh of relief when he saw the woman pinning the guy down was the female bodyguard he had hired.

To make it easier for the two female bodyguards to protect Amelia, Benjamin had arranged for them to join the company as her colleagues.

Earlier in the elevator, Benjamin had heard that even the security guards couldn't handle the drunk guy. This made him worry about Amelia's safety, forgetting that the bodyguards he hired were way tougher than the security guards.

"Is that guy really your dad? What's going on?" Benjamin asked, puzzled, standing next to Amelia.

Amelia's eyes darkened. "Yeah, that's my dad, Daniel Martinez. Since I was born, he's been abusing my mom, drinking, and gambling. He wrecked our family's finances. Now he heard I have a wealthy boyfriend and wants money from me. I used the money to treat my mom's illness. How can I give it to him for drinking and gambling?"

Benjamin frowned, his face darkening. No wonder Amelia never wanted to talk about Daniel. The guy was a total jerk.

"Have I not taken care of you all these years? I'm your dad, what's wrong with asking you for some money?" Daniel, lying on the ground, shouted angrily.

Amelia's eyes turned red as she glared at Daniel. "You not only hit my mom, but you also hit me. Besides drinking, how much of your meager salary was left for us? My mom got seriously ill because of you, and she was beaten by debt collectors! We moved to another city to get away from you. Why did you come here?"

"I'm your dad, that's something you can never change," Daniel laughed maniacally.

Benjamin's gaze grew darker, hating this jerk more than ever.

Approaching Daniel, Benjamin looked at him coldly. "I'm your daughter's boyfriend, and yes, I am wealthy. But I will never give my money to scum like you! If you dare to touch my girlfriend, you'll regret ever being born."

Daniel was unfazed by Benjamin's threat. Even though Benjamin was furious, Daniel, being drunk, didn't care.

Licking his lips, Daniel smirked, "You've had sex with my daughter, right? Then you should pay me for it! I've always wanted to sell her for a good price. Those cheap places offering sexual services aren't worthy of her; only wealthy people like you are."

Benjamin stood up and kicked Daniel hard in the head. However, Daniel's head was tough, and Benjamin wasn't much of a fighter. The kick only caused Daniel some pain without any real effect.

"Kicking him like that won't work; you have to hit his weakest spot," Michael's voice came from behind, followed by a swift kick to Daniel's groin.

###chapter 460 Too Easy

Daniel let out a scream that could wake the dead. That thing was just way too fragile.

Benjamin jumped, not expecting Michael to pop up out of nowhere. He didn't give a damn about Daniel's scream, though.

"Weren't you planning to leave? Why are you back?" Benjamin asked Michael, confused, then kicked Daniel in the crotch.

Daniel screamed again.

Michael shrugged. "I always thought you were too soft for this. Good thing I showed up; you wouldn't even know how to throw a punch."

With that, Michael kicked Daniel in the crotch again.

Daniel's screams echoed through the space, making everyone present wince in pain.

The men watching Michael and Benjamin kick Daniel in the crotch instinctively clenched their legs. Just thinking about that pain was unbearable.

Even though Amelia didn't like Daniel, his screams were too much.

"Can you two stop? Are you using his crotch as punctuation for your conversation?" Amelia complained, covering her ears.

Michael looked at Benjamin and grinned. "Amelia's your girlfriend, you handle your own stuff. How about I take care of this guy on the ground?"

Benjamin nodded, trusting Michael completely.

Michael made a call, and soon a bunch of uniformed cops showed up and took Daniel away.

Benjamin looked at Michael, puzzled, and whispered, "Are these cops your guys in disguise?"

Michael shook his head.

Benjamin was even more confused. "Calling the cops is your solution?"

Michael chuckled and rubbed his nose. "That call was to my wife. It was her idea. She's part of one of the big four families now. Never thought I'd be relying on my wife!"

Benjamin's mouth twitched. He looked at Michael, who seemed pretty pleased with himself, and suddenly felt like punching him in the nose.

"Alright, stop staring at me. Go check on your girlfriend, I'm outta here." Michael patted Benjamin on the shoulder with a smile and left the building.

Benjamin turned to Amelia, feeling a bit helpless.

"Darling, come with me, I need to ask you something." Amelia took Benjamin's hand and led him to a corner.

Benjamin knew what Amelia was going to ask. Before she could speak, he nodded. "Yes, those two women are the bodyguards I arranged for you."

Amelia blinked and looked at Benjamin. "No, I mean I want you to help me find a job."

Benjamin was taken aback, looking at Amelia in surprise. "You don't like your current job?"

Amelia shook her head. "Not really, but I don't hate it either. I took it because the pay is good and it helps with my mom's medical bills. But now, with my dad around, rumors are probably flying all over the company. I don't want to stay there anymore."

Benjamin awkwardly scratched his head. "I thought you were going to ask why I still have bodyguards following you around?"

Amelia rolled her eyes. "I figured out a while ago that those two were your bodyguards. At first, I thought they were just really into me because they were always around. But then I realized they were protecting me, so I guessed they were your doing."

Benjamin felt even more embarrassed, not expecting Amelia to be so sharp.

Suddenly, Amelia grabbed his hand and said softly, "Darling, thank you. If it weren't for your bodyguards, I would've been hurt today."

Feeling the warmth of her hand, Benjamin hugged her. "Don't worry, darling. As long as I'm here, nothing will happen to you. I promise."

Nestling in his arms, Amelia said, "I believe you. But what about my dad? You can't give him any money, or he'll never leave us alone."

Benjamin nodded, his voice steady. "Don't worry, you won't see him again."

Benjamin's eyes narrowed slightly. If Michael couldn't handle it, he would take care of Daniel himself.

Benjamin was usually easy-going, but that didn't mean he didn't have a temper. As a top-notch doctor, his network of contacts was impressive, even to Michael. After all, illness doesn't discriminate, and everyone wants to survive. Knowing a great doctor can make a big difference.

Benjamin had full confidence in Michael. With his methods, dealing with a jerk like Daniel would be a piece of cake.

After leaving Amelia's office, Michael got a call from Isabella.

Isabella sounded tired, like she had just finished a long day. "Darling, how's Amelia? Is she okay? Did she get hurt?"

Michael smiled. "Benjamin took care of it. Amelia's got bodyguards and hasn't been harmed. She's got a powerful best friend and a strong boyfriend; not many people can mess with her."

Isabella sighed in relief but then said, "Knowing Amelia, she'll probably quit her job and look for a new one. But she won't come to me; she'll go to Benjamin."

"Why? Because you're too busy and she doesn't want to bother you?" Michael asked with a grin.

Isabella chuckled. "That's part of it. But don't underestimate Amelia. She's smart. Her relationship with Benjamin is still growing, and having him help her out will strengthen their bond."

"A clever girl. Makes me wonder if my wife is just as clever," Michael joked.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Alright, enough chit-chat. Go home and rest. I've got a ton of work to do."

Just as Isabella was about to hang up, Michael suddenly asked, "How do you plan to deal with Daniel?"

###chapter 461 Correcting Mistakes

After chatting with Mason today, Michael realized he needed to give Isabella more chances to stand on her own. He couldn't always be there to handle everything for her. If something happened to him, she'd be lost, and that wouldn't be good.

When Michael asked his question, Isabella just smiled. "It's simple. The gang loyal to Paxton has been reaching out to me lately. I don't really like these guys, but sometimes I need their help."

Michael raised an eyebrow, surprised that Isabella, who usually hated dealing with criminals, was actually using them.

"What do these gang members want from you?" Michael asked.

Isabella shrugged. "Nothing major, just some financial stuff. Sometimes I need them to find someone or handle some tricky situations. Like this time, Daniel owed a debt at a casino run by one of the gang members, and that's how he found Amelia."

"So you're planning to have the gang threaten Daniel? Not a bad idea. These guys look way scarier than the cops," Michael thought Isabella's approach was pretty smart.

Sometimes you need bad guys to deal with bad guys, and it might work out better.

But Isabella laughed and shook her head. "Who said I want the gang to threaten Daniel and keep him away from Amelia? I have a different plan."

"What's your plan? Come on, tell me, I'm curious," Michael asked with a grin.

Isabella didn't hesitate and said with a smile, "I'm having those gang members help Daniel quit drinking and gambling, to make him a better person."

"Having gangsters teach him to be a good person?" Michael was stunned, finding this idea pretty wild.

Isabella nodded, her laughter coming through the phone.

"You think this is funny, like something out of a comedy movie, right? That's exactly how I see it too. How about we bet on whether these gangsters can really turn Daniel into a good person?" Isabella said, laughing.

A smile spread across Michael's face, curious to see if this plan would actually work.

As for Daniel's opinion? Well, no one really cared.

"Since you want to bet, let's bet $10,000, what do you say?" Michael asked, just for fun.

But Isabella turned him down.

"No, sweetheart, I don't want to bet money with you anymore, it's no fun. I want to bet on something else," Isabella said with a mischievous smile.

Confused, Michael asked, "What do you want to bet on?"

Isabella leaned closer to the phone and whispered, "Once you're fully healed, I want to make love to you seven times!"

Michael was taken aback, his expression turning serious. He grimaced slightly. If he hadn't been shot in the chest, he could have enjoyed some intimate moments with Isabella in a couple of nights.

But now, with his recovery still in progress, that plan would have to wait.

Sensing Michael's silence, Isabella asked impatiently, "What's wrong? Sweetheart, you're not having trouble in that department, are you?"

Michael cleared his throat awkwardly, forcing a smile. "No, sweetheart, never say a man can't perform. I can definitely perform. "Whether it's seven times, seventeen times, or even seventy times, I can satisfy you!"" Michael's tone was firm, feeling the need to prove himself. It was a matter of pride.

Isabella covered her mouth and laughed. "Sweetheart, you're quite the fierce tiger! But let's forget about 70 times in one night. Although the number is high, the time is too short. I wouldn't enjoy it that way."

Even if it was just 7 times, Michael found it quite challenging.

"Okay, sweetheart, I have to get back to work. If there's nothing else, I'll hang up," Isabella smiled and then ended the call.

Michael looked at his phone, now disconnected, his expression somewhat grim. His gaze shifted from the phone to his crotch.

"Seven times, damn it, I wonder if I'm up for it," Michael muttered to himself.

Meanwhile, Daniel had been released from the police station. Despite his abusive behavior, there was no evidence against him, so the police couldn't hold him for long, much to his satisfaction.

"It seems those two bitches are still afraid of me. I must torture them severely, let them know they can never escape from me. And that wealthy doctor, I just don't know which hospital he's from," Daniel boasted to the air.

Suddenly, Daniel felt a hand pat his shoulder. He turned around in confusion and saw the two people behind him, his expression turning sour.

"Jake? Why are you here at the police station to greet me?" Daniel asked, forcing a pleasant expression as he looked at the crew-cut man in front of him.

Jake Penrose was the casino owner Daniel met while gambling. He was a gangster. Most importantly, Daniel owed Jake a lot of money, which he couldn't repay, hence why he went to see Amelia.

Jake looked at Daniel with a hint of disgust in his eyes. Thinking about what he was about to do next, Jake's eyes took on a strange look.

"Daniel, I have good news and bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?" Jake suddenly smiled.

Looking puzzled, Daniel asked, "Jake, can you tell me the good news first?"

Jake nodded. "Someone has paid off your debt."

Daniel's face lit up with joy, immediately guessing Amelia had paid the money.

"That's great, I can go play a couple more hands." Just as Daniel was getting excited, he suddenly remembered that Jake mentioned bad news.

"Jake, what's the bad news you mentioned..." Before Daniel could finish his sentence, several burly men tied him up.

With a smile on his face, Jake said to Daniel, "From today onwards, I'm going to turn you into a good person."

###chapter 462 Be a Good Person

Having a gangster teach an abusive man to be a good person? That's undoubtedly one of the most absurd and hilarious headlines ever.

But it might just work.

That's what Jake thought as he struggled to show Daniel the ropes of being a good guy.

"Let me figure out what a good person would do." Jake glanced at the tied-up Daniel, scratching his head with a pen in frustration.

At first, when Isabella assigned Jake the task, he wasn't thrilled about it. But Isabella made him an offer he couldn't refuse. She was just too generous.

Jake glanced at Daniel, tied up with a rag in his mouth, then turned to his sidekick with irritation.

"What's the deal with being a good person?" Jake asked, genuinely curious.

His sidekick pondered for a moment and suggested, "Maybe we're seen as the bad guys by everyone else, so all we gotta do is the opposite of our usual stuff to be seen as good?"

Jake paused, feeling a bit silly for even asking that question!

"So, if we just do the opposite of what we usually do, we'll be good guys?" Jake looked at his sidekick, puzzled.

His sidekick nodded enthusiastically.

Jake rubbed his chin, thinking about their usual activities.

"We usually brawl, extort money, take over turf, swear, hit, drink, gamble, hustle, stir up trouble, do drugs, drive under the influence, and race on the streets..." Jake listed all their shady activities.

His sidekick counted the list of misdeeds, running out of fingers and toes.

Finally, Jake clapped his hands decisively, excitement gleaming in his eyes. "I got it! I know what we gotta do next!"

Jake turned to Daniel and yanked the rag from his mouth.

Daniel looked at Jake with pleading eyes. "Jake, I messed up. I don't even know what I did wrong, but please, don't mess with me, okay?"

Jake smacked Daniel's head in frustration. "Who's messing around? Do you know how much I gotta handle in a day? I'm swamped!"

"If you're so busy, why not just cut me loose? I never signed up to be a good guy. Heck, I'm not even a bad guy," Daniel said bitterly.

Jake smacked Daniel's head again. "Don't act innocent! I heard you hit up your daughter for cash! Even though I've done that too, I'm a villain! You begged a lady for money, so you're a villain too! And I heard you laid hands on your wife. Sure, I hit women too, but I'm a villain! So, you're a villain too, right?"

Daniel, now twice smacked by Jake, felt dazed and nodded unconsciously. "You're right, I guess I am a villain."

Jake smacked Daniel's head once more. "You are a villain, so now I gotta transform you into a good guy. That means no more bad stuff!"

Daniel felt like Jake must have fried his brain from smoking too much weed. A gangster trying to teach someone to be a decent person? It sounded like a joke, but Daniel didn't want to face Jake's wrath, so he just nodded along.

"Yeah, Jake, I messed up. I won't ask my daughter for money or lay a hand on my wife again. I'll try to be a good guy." Daniel eyed Jake cautiously, hoping he'd stick to his word and set him free.

But Jake's next words crushed Daniel's hopes. "Nah, Daniel, you got it wrong. Being a good guy means more than just not hitting your wife or asking your daughter for money. You gotta quit drinking, stop driving drunk, steer clear of drugs, watch your language, no hustling, no causing trouble, follow traffic rules, mind your manners, return lost cash, and donate to charity." Jake's demands left Daniel pale. His standards for goodness were off the charts, even down to how many squares of toilet paper to use.

"Are you trying to turn me into a saint or the president? Even presidents have their scandals, right?" Daniel grumbled, only to be met with Jake's whip.

Jake lashed out at Daniel, causing him to cry out in pain.

"Questioning my authority, huh, bad guy Daniel?" Jake's eyes turned cold, a hint of menace in his gaze.

Tears streaming from the whipping, Daniel looked at Jake and whimpered, "Aren't we talking about being a good guy? Why are you hitting me?"

Jake whipped Daniel again. "I want you to be good, not me. Starting tomorrow. No, starting now."

In agony from the lashes, Daniel shuddered but didn't dare argue with Jake.

"Okay, Jake, I get it. I'll try to be good. What's next?" Daniel asked, his voice trembling.

This question caught Jake off guard as he hadn't thought about the specifics of being good. But as the boss, he couldn't show any weakness.

After a moment of contemplation, Jake came up with a plan. "From today, you'll shadow my crew. Do what they do. Eat, sleep, live with them. And remember, no snoring at night, no disturbing their peace!"

Daniel's lips twitched. He knew he snored, but he kept quiet.

"Got it, Jake," Daniel nodded, swallowing his pride. Little did he know that a new Daniel, a good guy, would emerge that day.

That night, Daniel struggled to sleep. Jake's crew snored loudly, keeping him awake. He wanted to snore too but feared the consequences.

Enduring the night, Daniel, fighting off sleep, joined Jake's crew the next day for community service.

###chapter 463 Good Man Daniel

Jake's crew had a pretty straightforward gig today: collecting protection money from the local shops.

In this neighborhood, Jake kept things under control to keep the troublemakers at bay. Of course, there was a price for all this; he wasn't doing it for free.

As for turning to the police when things get tough? Well, the cops have to follow the law, too.

If a shop owner called 911, sure, the troublemakers might get picked up, but they'd be back the next day, scaring off customers with their antics.

The cops were stuck handling these lowlifes, but for Jake and his crew, it was a piece of cake. The police couldn't just go around throwing their weight around, but Jake's crew had no such restrictions.

In this part of town, there was this strange balance between the cops and the bad guys. As long as the bad guys kept things quiet, the cops usually looked the other way.

Daniel tagged along with Jake's crew to a shop.

The shop owner, Dione Saunders, a cheerful lady, grabbed a wad of cash from the register and handed it over.

"Tell Jake those kids have been swiping candies from my shop. It's not about the money, it's just plain annoying. He better handle those pesky kids," Dione grumbled.

Jake's guy nodded. "Sure thing, Dione. We'll have a word with those troublemakers."

Dione spotted Daniel in the background and raised an eyebrow, asking, "Is this a new face in your crew? Is he naturally ancient or just looks that way? If you're recruiting old men, can my husband give it a shot? He's been lazing around at home, getting rusty, doesn't even  bother to fix the broken toilet."

Jake's guy glanced at Daniel and replied, "No, this guy's our project. We gotta turn him into a decent guy."

Dione stood silently for a couple of seconds, then dug her finger in her ear. "I didn't quite catch that, say it again."

Jake's guy repeated himself.

Daniel wished he could disappear into the sewer outside. Maybe down there, he wouldn't feel so embarrassed.

When Dione heard about turning Daniel into a good guy, she burst into laughter. "Oh my god, that's the best joke I've heard all year. You tough guys trying to make someone good? I can't wait to see how that plays out."

Actually, these tough guys had no clue how to pull off Jake's orders.

"I reckon to be a decent person, we gotta flip the script on what we're doing now. We're collecting protection fees, so to be good guys, we should give back those fees to the shops," a wise gang member proposed.

Another guy scratched his head. "You've got a point. But what about our job? We still gotta collect those fees."

The guy who came up with the idea now looked troubled. "Yeah, if we give back the fees, we won't finish our task. But if we keep them, Daniel won't finish his. We're stuck between a rock and a hard place, can't please Jake either way."

The gang members were stumped, facing a real head-scratcher.

Dione couldn't help but chuckle, finding these guys quite the spectacle.

Daniel felt incredibly awkward. When they suggested he return the protection fees, he was floored. If he had money for that, why was he hitting up Amelia for cash?

"This is so funny. You guys have no idea how to turn someone into a good person, yet you're out here playing client service?" Dione finally burst into laughter, nearly in tears, drawing attention from passersby outside.

The gang members looked a bit awkward. One of them slammed his hand on the counter, clearly annoyed. "Then tell me, what are we supposed to do?" he shot back.

Dione took a deep breath, composing herself. She looked at the gang members and proposed, "Mr. Martinez doesn't seem loaded. Even if he wants to pay up, he's short on cash. So, how about a different kind of deal? What do you think?"

"What deal?" The gang members eyed Dione curiously.

Dione shrugged. "Instead of cash, how about he works it off? Let he work for me to settle the protection fee. Sound good?"

The gang members' faces lit up.

"Yeah, why didn't we think of that? Work instead of cash!"

"Genius idea. By the way, your toilet needs fixing, right?"

"Daniel, what's your take on this? Actually, never mind your opinion."

The gang members swiftly agreed on the new plan. Since they couldn't cough up the protection fees, they'd offer labor instead.

"What kind of joke is this? I go work for someone else, and you pocket the cash. You think I'm a fool?" Daniel yelled in frustration.

Dione shrugged her shoulders, a hint of exasperation in her voice. "Looks like this man isn't on board with this approach," she said.

The gang members grinned at Dione. "He'll come around, just give us 5 minutes."

With that, they grabbed Daniel and hauled him out of the shop despite his protests.

Soon, Daniel's cries echoed through the neighborhood.

Five minutes later, Daniel returned to Dione's shop.

His face was swollen and covered in bruises. He looked at Dione, tears rolling down his cheeks, "Please, let me see that toilet."

###chapter 464 The Numb Good Guy

Under Jake's guidance, Daniel got involved in a bunch of schemes to better himself.

Word spread fast around the neighborhood about Jake's efforts to turn Daniel's life around, and soon everyone was curious and offering their two cents.

At first, Jake struggled to figure out how to help Daniel improve, but eventually, he took all the community's suggestions to heart. Slowly but surely, a kinder version of Daniel started to emerge.

Two weeks later, it was time for Daniel to say goodbye to the neighborhood.

Not because he had turned into a good guy, but because he needed to help an elderly resident fix their roof and didn't have the tools he needed anywhere else.

As Daniel drove away, two gang members sat in the back of his car.

Their job was to keep an eye on Daniel and make sure he stayed out of trouble.

Daniel stared straight ahead at the road, buckled up, hands gripping the wheel, following every traffic law to the letter. Even his feet were cuffed with an electronic tracker.

Ironically, it was the gang members who had put the monitor on him, to track his movements and prevent any escape attempts.

Feeling numb, Daniel sometimes wondered if things would be better if his wife had accused him of something serious. Maybe in prison, he wouldn't face such harsh treatment or be forced into community service. At least there, no one would whip him.

The only comfort for Daniel lately was being allowed to snore while he slept, a small mercy granted by the sympathetic residents who felt sorry for him.

Daniel felt no gratitude, worn out from all the demanding tasks he was given.

Disguised as efforts to reform him, the residents had him doing all sorts of chores for free-from mowing lawns and fixing fountains to babysitting and dog-walking.

Daniel suspected there might be some payoff for his hard work, remembering a homeowner slipping money to one of Jake's crew after Daniel had finished repairing their roof.

But he didn't dare complain, knowing it would only lead to punishment.

Daniel's mind was foggy, having gone without drinking or smoking for two weeks. Though tough at first, he was starting to feel more alert.

Suddenly, Daniel hit the brakes. The two gang members in the back jolted in their seats, shooting him angry looks.

"What the hell, Daniel, why'd you stop?" one of them snapped.

Daniel pointed ahead. "There's an old lady crossing the street. I should wait for her, being a good guy and all."

Seeing the slow-moving senior, the gang members couldn't argue with Daniel's logic this time.

But Daniel's sudden stop caused a traffic jam, and some drivers, unaware of the situation, started honking like crazy.

The street turned into a mess.

"Come on, you idiot! Learn how to drive! If your car's busted, move it and stop blocking everyone. Get out of here," a driver yelled.

Daniel's bottled-up emotions flared. He wanted to confront the driver but got a slap on the head from one of the gang members.

"Good guys don't argue, Daniel," the gang member warned sharply.

Daniel eyed the whip in the man's hand and sighed in defeat.

Just then, another driver lost his patience and got out of his car, striding over to Daniel's vehicle. He knocked on the window, scowling, and shouted, "Can you even drive?"

Seeing the driver's spit on the windshield, Daniel wanted to argue but held back.

Pointing to the slow-moving elderly person, Daniel shot the guy a helpless look. "I'd love to move, but I should wait for this lady. Thinking about her safety, you know, being a good guy."

The two gang members nodded. "Yeah, he's a good guy, no doubt."

The guy saw the elderly person and realized Daniel was an easy target for his frustration. So, he unleashed his anger on the unsuspecting Daniel.

"You punk! Step out so I can vent on you," the man growled and started getting aggressive.

Daniel sighed and turned to the gang members. "Can I punch him, please?"

The gang members exchanged a look and shook their heads. "Good guys don't throw punches, but you can call the cops."

Daniel felt like he might explode.

Finally, Daniel opened the car door and stepped out.

As soon as he did, the enraged driver pushed him to the ground and started hitting him.

Daniel could only shield his vital parts and endure the blows. When the gang members in the car couldn't bear it anymore, fearing for Daniel's life and their mission, they leaped out and gave the attacker a good beating.

"He's the good guy, not us! You almost messed up everything, you jerk," the gang members yelled as they fought back.

The commotion brought all traffic to a halt, with drivers pulling out their phones to capture the drama.

Daniel got up from the ground, glanced at the slow-moving elderly person, and sighed.

"Let it go, I'm a good guy. I'll keep trying to be one!" Tears of shame streamed down Daniel's face as he walked over to the elderly lady.

"Ma'am, let me introduce myself. I'm Daniel, a good guy. Let me help you cross the street," Daniel said, tears and a smile mingling as he swiftly guided the old lady across the road.

Unbeknownst to Daniel, Amelia had witnessed the entire incident.

###chapter 465 I Am Very Satisfied

Amelia's eyes went wide as she saw Daniel helping an old lady across the street. She blinked, trying to wrap her head around it.

"Wait, am I seeing this right? Is that really happening? Is that guy helping the old lady my dad?" Amelia turned to Benjamin, totally confused.

Benjamin squinted at the scene. "Looks like him, but would your dad really do that? Maybe that lady is his mom?"

Amelia shook her head. "No way, my grandma passed away a long time ago."

"Then who is she? And why is your dad helping her?" Benjamin asked, just as puzzled.

Rolling her eyes, Amelia shot back, "If I knew, would I be asking you? Weren't you supposed to keep him away from me?"

Feeling embarrassed, Benjamin scratched his head. He had expected Michael to handle Daniel, not see him in the city.

"Hold on a second, let me make a quick call," Benjamin said, reaching for his phone.

Meanwhile, Michael was chilling in the yard, soaking up the winter sun. Despite the cold, he found comfort in the warmth.

Answering Benjamin's call, Michael asked casually, "What's up? Are you having more problems with Amelia?"

Hearing the voice on the other end of the line, Amelia raised an eyebrow.

"Sweetheart, you seem to have quite a problem with me, don't you?," Amelia teased Benjamin with a smile.

Nervously, Benjamin explained, "I only call when I'm puzzled. Our relationship is fine."

Michael sensed something was up, especially with Amelia in the background.

"What's going on then?" Michael inquired.

Benjamin quickly told Michael about spotting Daniel, looking for an explanation.

Michael raised an eyebrow, remembering the situation. After the bet with Isabella, he had forgotten about it. The bet was just a game between spouses.

Surprised by Daniel's actions, Michael remarked, "Looks like he's doing a good deed."

"Why the silence? Shouldn't this be easy for you? Why is he still around?" Benjamin vented his frustration.

Shrugging, Michael replied, "Amelia's there, right? I'll talk to her. Dealing with her dad is Isabella's call."

Michael then shared Isabella's plan with Amelia and Benjamin.

After hearing the plan, Benjamin exclaimed, "Wait, are you serious? Getting a gangster to reform that jerk? Are you for real?"

Smirking, Michael retorted, "Do I sound like I'm joking? What do you think you saw?"

Benjamin fell silent, realizing they had witnessed Daniel assisting the elderly.

Amelia was shocked to learn about Isabella's involvement.

"I wonder, did the gang really manage to turn my dad around?" Amelia asked, eyeing Daniel in the distance with uncertainty.

By now, Daniel had helped the elderly person and was driving off towards his destination.

Benjamin shrugged and started the car. "Instead of guessing, let's go ask him."

Following Daniel to a supermarket, Benjamin parked as Daniel stepped out and spotted them.

Daniel was surprised to see Amelia, tears welling up in his eyes. He rushed towards her, crying.

"My dear daughter, I messed up. I shouldn't have treated you and your mom that way. Can you forgive me?" Daniel pleaded tearfully.

Taken aback, Benjamin stepped in front of Amelia.

"Daniels, what's going on? We have a roof to fix," two gang members approached, looking displeased.

Confused, Benjamin asked the gang members, "What's the deal? Did this guy really change? How did you do it?"

One of the gang members recognized Amelia as Daniel's daughter.

Waving casually, the gang member said, "Turning him around wasn't hard. Whenever he acted up, we just gave him a good whipping! That straightened him out!"

Benjamin and Amelia winced. As a doctor, Benjamin noticed the scars on Daniel's body from the whippings.

"Amelia, I know I messed up. Please ask Jake to let me go. I promise to change. Please believe me!" Daniel pleaded through tears.

Daniel knew Jake wouldn't go easy on him. He was certain Amelia had sought help from someone powerful, hence the harsh punishment.

Seeing Daniel's scars, Amelia felt a twinge of sympathy. But Benjamin's words reinforced her decision.

"Sweetheart, it's only been two weeks, but the pain he caused you spans years. And remember, you can't trust the promises of an abuser!" Benjamin's words bolstered Amelia's resolve.

Coldly, Amelia addressed Daniel, "Jake did the right thing. You need to change, even if it takes a whip. Take him away, I don't want to see him."

Amelia's final words were directed at the two gang members.

###chapter 466 Internet Celebrity

The two gang members yanked Daniel away, and he cried out as they dragged him off.

"No, Amelia, I messed up! Please forgive me. I don't want to go back there! Please!" Daniel reached out to Amelia, hoping she'd help.

But Amelia turned away, not wanting to see.

Benjamin put his arm around her shoulders and said, "You don't have to feel bad for him, babe. He deserves this."

Amelia nodded and pulled out her phone to call Isabella.

Isabella had been super busy lately, taking over the Brown Family's business, so Amelia had been hesitant to call and interrupt her.

After two weeks, Amelia figured Isabella might have more time, so she decided to give her a ring.

After a couple of rings, Isabella picked up, sounding pleasantly surprised. "Oh, Amelia, you finally called! I thought you forgot about me."

Amelia laughed. "How could I forget you? You're my bestie. How's everything going with all the craziness? Are you feeling more chill now? I didn't want to bug you."

"Why would you? It was nuts at first, but things are running smoothly now. I'm much more relaxed!" Isabella said, stretching with a satisfied sigh.

Amelia congratulated her. "Congrats, Ms. Taylor, on getting back into the Big Four Families."

Rolling her eyes, Isabella teased, "You didn't just call to congratulate me, did you? What's up?"

Amelia nodded. "Actually, it's about my dad."

Amelia shared with Isabella what she had seen on the street.

Surprised, Isabella commented, "The gang members really did it. Looks like your dad is getting a wake-up call."

"No, I think he still needs more than that. He hasn't truly owned up to his mistakes. He's not sorry; he's just scared of the consequences," Amelia said bitterly.

As Benjamin had mentioned, Daniel had caused decades of pain to Amelia and her mom, and two weeks of punishment couldn't make up for that.

"It seems you're on board with my way of handling things. I'll call Jake to continue then," Isabella said with a grin.

Isabella knew about Amelia's family history, but with Amelia and her mom moving away and cutting ties with Daniel for years, she had kind of forgotten about it.

Isabella had always been furious about Daniel's actions. Now she finally had the chance to make him pay.

After thanking Isabella once more, Amelia hung up.

Suddenly, Amelia noticed Benjamin scowling at his phone, like he had stumbled upon something. Curious, she walked over to peek at his phone screen and was stunned to see a video making rounds on social media.

"Is that my dad?" Amelia gaped in disbelief.

The video showed Daniel helping an elderly person cross the street, starting from when he was being attacked.

The person who shared the video online was probably a driver waiting behind them, and they titled it "A Silent Good Man."

There were tons of comments under the video.

[A truly kind person wouldn't resort to violence but would lend a helping hand to the vulnerable.]

[You can hit me, but I won't hit back because I stand for what's right.]

[Your fists are for harm, but my hands are for justice!]

[I want to give this man a round of applause; he's my inspiration!]

Many praised Daniel's behavior. Of course, some saw not fighting back as a sign of weakness.

But more people believed that Daniel's choice to help others without violence came from a belief that aggression didn't solve anything.

"Oh my gosh, what's wrong with these people? They have no clue about your dad's past!" Benjamin exclaimed angrily.

Amelia shrugged, kind of resigned. "These days, a lot of people online don't care about the truth; they just go by what they see, leading to a lot of online drama."

"No, the truth shouldn't be hidden. Your dad isn't a hero; he's just a beast in chains," Benjamin said, typing on his phone.

Confused, Amelia asked, "What are you up to, babe?"

"I'm going to unveil the reality. Let everyone know that your dad is actually an abusive man! All of this is part of his punishment," Benjamin said irritably.

Amelia stood by, watching Benjamin's rage without stepping in, knowing that all his actions were driven by his devotion to her.

Benjamin sent a message detailing the whole story to the comments on the video.

90 Million Girls' Dream Lover: ["Everyone, don't be fooled by this guy. He's an abusive alcoholic with a track record of domestic violence. He's done some terrible things, like beating his wife and daughter, and even threatening his daughter for money! What's happening to him now is just justice being served."]

Soon, he was bombarded with responses, everyone shocked to discover that the seemingly heroic Daniel had a dark side.

[Oh my, this man is awful. I never imagined he was capable of such things.]

[Don't you find the gang that reforms people intriguing?]

[I'm a filmmaker, and I think this story would make a fantastic movie!]

[It could be a comedy flick; it's so captivating. Which neighborhood is this gang in?]

Benjamin scanned the replies, then smirked at Amelia. "See, people won't easily buy into your dad's facade."

However, Amelia just glanced at Benjamin's username and rolled her eyes. "Honey, your username is seriously cringeworthy."

###chapter 467 New Business

Daniel had no clue that his shot at internet fame would be totally wrecked by just one comment from Benjamin.

Everyone knew Daniel as a nasty domestic abuser, but there was this weird fascination with the gang's attempt to turn him around.

The idea of a gang making a bad guy good was pretty intriguing to a lot of folks.

Some people even came to this community just to see if the rumors were true, and they got a big thumbs-up from the locals.

"Yeah, Daniel was a real piece of work before, but he's changed. He even helped me fix my roof," one resident said.

"Trust me, these gang members know what they're doing. They can really turn someone's life around," another added.

"What, you think the gang's methods are too rough? Come on, don't anti-heroes in movies use tough tactics against the bad guys too?" a third resident argued.

The community didn't see anything wrong with how the gang handled Daniel. Knowing his past, they had zero sympathy for him.

The news spread like wildfire, sparking heated debates about whether gangs could really reform people, even catching the eye of reporters.

Eventually, a reporter showed up to interview Daniel.

"Mr. Martinez, do you think the community's efforts to reform you are working? There are claims that you were treated harshly to force a change. Is that true?" the reporter asked.

The "community" the reporter mentioned was actually the gang. He wanted to hear straight from Daniel if he'd been through some rough stuff.

But Daniel shook his head and looked right into the camera, "I hope you won't doubt my friends like that! They're all about helping me become a better person. I've messed up in the past, and I'm trying to make things right. Please believe me, I can definitely change!"

After his heartfelt statement, Daniel turned and walked away.

'What a bunch of idiots! That reporter has no clue. How could I spill the truth on camera? Can your story protect me afterward? You just want your headlines, but I can't escape the gang's wrath! I don't want those lashes again, you fools,' Daniel cursed the reporter in his mind over and over.

The gang in this community had strong ties with the residents. If Daniel showed even a hint of unhappiness, the gang would hear about it right away and punish him brutally.

Just thinking about those saltwater-soaked whips hitting his body made Daniel shiver. In the first week, he got whipped a lot for not changing his ways, often showing disgust or doing gross stuff like spitting.

By the second week, Daniel started to get the hang of things, being more careful, and the lashings became less frequent.

"When is this gonna end? I could really use a drink," Daniel muttered, eyeing the distant mailbox like it was a cold beer bottle.

As he absentmindedly walked towards it, the sound of a whip cutting through the air made him shiver.

Turning towards the noise, Daniel saw a woman in a yard shaking out clothes, making that whip-like sound.

'Damn, these people are gonna drive me crazy,' Daniel wiped the sweat off his forehead and got on with his day's work, helping an elderly person fix a water pipe, all for free to make amends.

Meanwhile, Jake was getting annoyed by weird phone calls.

"How many times do I have to say it? Your kid's homework problems aren't my issue. Talk to the teacher, not me. I'm a gang member, not a tutor!" Jake slammed the phone down, wondering who leaked his number to these strange callers.

"What do these people think of me? If they want to reform someone, they should hit up the prison's community service, not bother me," Jake grumbled in frustration.

Just then, Jake's phone rang again.

Answering angrily, Jake barked, "We ain't in the business of changing people here! Beat it! Wait, how much did you say?"

Upon hearing the amount, Jake's hands trembled.

"$500,000? To reform your son? Booze, drugs, reckless driving, speeding, brawling, harassment? Sounds just like me! Alright, sir, I got this. Hand over your kid!" Jake asserted.

Shortly after, $200,000 was deposited into Jake's account.

Taking a deep breath, Jake saw a business opportunity. Maybe he could turn this into a profitable venture.

"I owe this to Ms. Taylor. She showed me the ropes," Jake thought, feeling the need to call Isabella and express his gratitude.

Isabella, just wrapping up work and looking forward to a break, furrowed her brow in confusion when she got Jake's call.

"What's up? Jake, did something happen with Daniel?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

"No, Ms. Taylor, I'm calling to thank you," Jake explained his new business idea and offered her a share.

Listening to Jake's plan, Isabella's lips curved into a slight smile.

"I don't need a share. This is your gig, you run with it...," Isabella paused, realizing Jake had potential and could use some guidance.

After a moment's thought, Isabella advised, "Steer clear of minors; they might cry child abuse. Focus on helping folks like Daniel, but don't treat them like laborers; pay them fairly. And make them sing and chant slogans daily."

###chapter 468 New Community

Isabella had tossed a bunch of ideas Jake's way, and he couldn't be more grateful.

"Isabella, you're way cooler than Paxton ever was!" Jake said, showing his appreciation.

Paxton used to just boss Jake around, throwing him a bone here and there, never really caring about how Jake ran the gang or offering any real help.

To Paxton, the gang members were just a bunch of nobodies, only worth his time when he needed something.

But Isabella saw potential in everyone, even a gang member like Jake.

Jake scribbled down every word Isabella said and followed her plans to the letter.

At first, Isabella didn't realize how her offhand advice would change things for Jake and his crew. But soon enough, she saw the results.

She watched a video of Jake, dressed like a cop, talking to a group of people in volunteer uniforms.

"You've all been seen as troublemakers, done some bad stuff, but here, we're aiming to be better! Let's say it together!" Jake's voice boomed as he rallied the group.

"Be a good person, be a positive force in society!" Jake shouted, and the group echoed back.

"Be respectful, be kind!" Jake continued, and the others followed suit.

"Be frugal, not wasteful!" In that moment, Jake felt like he had a halo over his head.

"Embrace learning, trust in science!" Jake felt like a divine messenger, minus the cash.

Isabella stumbled upon the video online while scrolling through social media and was stunned by what she saw.

"Did Jake really take my words to heart? How much did he pocket to go all out like this?" Isabella couldn't believe it, but she figured Jake must have made a pretty penny.

Just then, there was a knock on Isabella's office door, and Carol walked in.

Carol meant to say hi, but seeing Isabella glued to her phone in shock, she asked, "Hey, what's got you so hooked?"

"I'm watching a gang turn over a new leaf and become do-gooders," Isabella said, showing Carol her phone screen.

Carol glanced at it and shrugged. "Oh, I've seen it. Heard it might become a comedy movie."

Noticing Isabella's puzzled look, Carol asked, "You really into this? You seem kind of off."

Isabella chuckled and shook her head. "I taught Jake this stuff. I just wanted him to help my friend's dad kick his drinking and violence habits, but he turned it into a whole operation."

Isabella quickly filled Carol in on Daniel's situation, leaving Carol wide-eyed in disbelief.

"Your idea is mind-blowing. How did you even think of turning a gang into a force for good?" Carol asked, amazed.

Isabella scratched her head, feeling sheepish. "I just wanted to teach Daniel a lesson at first, didn't plan it out. Jake's the real brains behind this."

Carol smirked and waved it off. "I'm not into this stuff. I came to see you for another reason."

Isabella looked at Carol, sensing something big was coming.

Carol said, "Remember I mentioned someone from the Brown Family wanted to meet you?"

Isabella nodded eagerly, intrigued. According to Carol, this person had info on why Patrick had disbanded the family and held some of their resources.

Excitedly, Isabella asked, "Did he finish his investigation? Is he ready to meet me?"

Carol nodded and gestured to the door. "He's right outside."

Opening the door, Carol ushered in a middle-aged man. He was slim, wore glasses, and had a wise look in his eyes.

"Ms. Taylor, I'm Wilmer," Wilmer Finley greeted Isabella.

Isabella stepped out from behind her desk and offered Wilmer a seat.

Seated across from Wilmer, Isabella asked eagerly, "What have you found out?"

Wilmer nodded but had a condition. "I'll share, but first, let me see your grandpa's ring."

Wilmer knew from Carol that Isabella had the family heirloom and needed to confirm it.

Isabella retrieved the ancient bronze ring from her pocket and handed it to Wilmer.

After inspecting it, Wilmer nodded and returned the ring.

"I'll start with why your grandpa disbanded the family." Wilmer's words grabbed Isabella's attention.

With a grave expression, Wilmer explained, "Your grandpa did it to protect the family. A shadowy group approached him to work on a genetic drug. An accident occurred, leading to arrests and deaths. Disbanding the family was his way to keep you all safe. It was a tough call."

Isabella never imagined that the reason for the family's breakup would be this; it sounded like a movie plot-so ridiculous.

###chapter 469 Insight Project

After hearing Wilmer's story, Isabella flopped onto the couch, lost in thought for a few seconds before snapping back to reality.

"Seriously, this sounds like something straight out of a movie, so cliché," Isabella griped, feeling like Wilmer was pulling her leg.

"Come on, Isabella, I'm not messing with you. I was already grown up before my grandfather passed away, and I remember a lot. Our family business had nothing to do with medical stuff, let alone genetics," Isabella expressed her disbelief.

Wilmer didn't let Isabella's skepticism ruffle his feathers. He just smiled politely and said, "Think you know it all? Bet you didn't know your grandma was a genetic whiz, did you?"

Isabella's mind screeched to a halt. To her, her grandma Sloane Taylor was just a regular homemaker. She had no clue about Sloane's past, let alone her genetic research.

Wilmer handed Isabella some papers.

Perplexed, Isabella skimmed through the documents, her brow furrowing. Her face twisted in confusion as the papers turned out to be legitimate academic articles, penned by a woman using the alias "Rose."

"So, you're saying this Rose lady is my grandma?" Isabella asked, shooting Wilmer a skeptical look. "Sure, my grandma liked roses, but that's a stretch."

Wilmer shrugged. "Why not ask Mason? He was at the same college as your grandparents. He might know what your grandma was into."

Without missing a beat, Isabella dialed Mason's number.

Lately, Mason had been feeling a bit off, realizing he was becoming forgetful. If he really wanted to confirm if Michael was Isabella's husband, all he had to do was check for Michael's prints where they had stayed together.

Unfortunately, the place where Isabella and Michael were previously hospitalized had already been cleaned, and all fingerprints had been wiped away. This only added to Mason's frustration.

Finally, Mason came up with a plan. He decided to sneak in some hidden cameras in the living room, record his chats with Michael, and show Isabella the footage to unveil her hubby's true colors.

Just as Mason was about to set up the cameras, Isabella called him.

"What's up, Isabella? What made you call out of the blue? Did you run into some trouble?" Mason asked, flashing a grin.

Isabella cut to the chase, "Mason, do you know what field my grandma studied in college?"

Taken aback, Mason hadn't seen that coming.

"Your grandma was all about biology and genetics in college. Why do you ask?" Mason asked, curious.

Isabella was floored. She had never paid attention to Sloane's accomplishments and quickly asked, "Did my grandma use her real name when she published papers?"

Mason chuckled. "No, your grandma was low-key. She never used her real name for papers; she went by Rose."Fully convinced now, Isabella realized Mason had no reason to deceive her.

"Sorry, Mason, I have some things I need to take care of; I'll have to hang up now." Isabella knew this was no simple issue and ended the call abruptly.

Isabella didn't want Mason caught up in this mess. Dealing with a threat that could tear the Taylor Family apart would be tough even for Mason.

Mason stared at his phone, puzzled, wondering why Isabella had asked those questions. 'Does Isabella already know about the drama brewing among us old folks?' he wondered.

At that moment, Isabella turned to Wilmer, her expression serious. "What else do you know?" she asked.

Wilmer met Isabella's gaze calmly and said, "That project was called the Insight Project, aiming to unravel the secrets hidden in human genes. Your grandma was actually my mentor. Sadly, I wasn't part of the Insight Project."

Isabella cut Wilmer off with a dismissive gesture, narrowing her eyes at him. "How did my grandma die? I have a feeling it wasn't natural," she said.

When Isabella first heard of Sloane's death, she wanted to see her body but was stopped by Patrick. He claimed Sloane had died in a car explosion, suffering severe burns. The details were too gruesome for Isabella to handle, so she wasn't allowed to view the body. They cremated her remains and buried them swiftly.

Wilmer sighed softly. "Sloane's death was linked to the genetic drug research. It seems a virus was involved. Your grandpa came to me and briefly mentioned that the tragedy was due to a virus leak. Your grandma chose to perish with the virus to prevent its spread."

Dizzy with shock, Isabella's head spun. Patrick and Sloane had always been so kind to her.

Tears rolling down her cheeks, Isabella questioned, "And even after my grandma's sacrifice, they wouldn't leave us alone?"

Wilmer nodded gravely. "Your grandpa sought me out and handed over some research materials and tasks. He mentioned that the politician behind the experiment couldn't afford any scandals as he was eyeing the presidency. He wanted to erase all ties to the experiment. Your grandpa caught wind of this early on, so he decided to break up the family to avoid suspicion."

Finally grasping who Wilmer was referring to, Isabella quickly pieced together the identity of the president responsible for their family's downfall.

Wilmer spoke solemnly, "Even though your grandpa disbanded the family, this isn't over. That guy still suspects your family holds the original research data, so he planted a spy. After digging around, I finally uncovered the mole's identity. I believe your recent run-in with Paxton's goons is also tied to this person."

Locking eyes with Wilmer, Isabella's gaze turned steely with hatred. "Spill it. Who is it?"

Wilmer replied calmly, "It's Paxton's butler, Jonah."

###chapter 470 Fulfilling the Bet

Isabella froze when she heard Jonah's name.

Wilmer started explaining, "Jonah was originally a spy for some politicians who were getting close to your grandpa. But then your grandpa had him switch sides to work for Paxton. I don't know if your grandpa knew Jonah's real motives, but he did a good job and ended up as Paxton's butler."

Isabella, shocked, buried her face in her hands. Wilmer's words made it clear that Patrick had been the mastermind behind the Brown Family's rise. Even Paxton had a mole thanks to him. The Browns' success was all Patrick's doing.

"Your grandpa had his reasons. At first, he had Jonah tail Paxton to keep an eye on the family businesses the Browns took over. But Jonah was probably also looking for any connections to the Insight Project. Being Paxton's butler made his job easier," Wilmer explained.

Isabella turned to Wilmer and asked, "Did he find anything?"

Wilmer shook his head, a hint of sarcasm in his eyes. "After all those years of spying, he came up empty-handed because your grandpa didn't hide the plan info in the businesses."

Isabella nodded, realizing that Patrick would totally pull a move like that in his sneaky style.

Wilmer continued, "I didn't suspect Jonah at first. But it looks like he got tired of waiting. He got fed up with the long game and decided to get rid of you, the one most likely to bring the family back, and replace you with a puppet he could control."

Shocked, Isabella's mind raced to a certain someone.

"Bianca?" Isabella blurted out.

Wilmer confirmed, "You've figured out that Bianca's got someone shady pulling her strings, and that someone is Jonah. It's easier to manipulate someone like her, who's more into dating John, compared to someone as sharp as you."

Feeling stunned, Isabella had always seen Bianca as conniving, but she hadn't expected an even bigger schemer like Jonah behind her.

Recalling the incident where Bianca faked kidney issues to harm her, Isabella realized it might have been driven by Bianca's envy, but possibly also under Jonah's orders.

"Why didn't he just send a hitman to take me out? Why let Bianca keep causing trouble for me, even resorting to clumsy attempts on my life?" Isabella asked Wilmer, seeking answers.

Pointing to his nose and then to the quiet Carol beside him, Wilmer explained, "Your grandpa had people keeping tabs on each other, which made Jonah hesitant to go all out. He could only reach out to Bianca on the down-low and stir up drama between you and your sister."

Listening intently, Isabella grinned. "So, in a way, you were looking out for me, right?"

Wilmer shrugged. "If that's how you see it, sure. We can't do much for you. Even though you're your grandpa's favorite granddaughter, we're really here to serve the family head. Your grandpa made it clear we shouldn't show up until you've got the ring."Isabella fell silent, realizing just how close Bianca had come to ending her life multiple times. If she had had Wilmer's support, maybe none of this chaos would have unfolded. Patrick seemed to have a ruthless streak in handling these matters.

Wilmer pulled a USB drive from his pocket and handed it to Isabella. "Your grandpa left this for you. It's got some stuff that can help you rake in cash real quick."

Puzzled, Isabella examined the USB drive. "Is this the key to a bank account or something?"

Wilmer scratched his head awkwardly. "Your grandpa had a stash of cash set aside, but it's almost all gone. Do you really think all those folks infiltrating the Taylor Family within the Browns are loyal? Without keeping their interests in check, why would they bother?"

Isabella nodded, understanding Wilmer's point.

Pointing at the USB drive, Wilmer explained, "Inside are products from the Insight Project. There's a potion for fast hair growth, one for scar removal, another for birthmark removal, a weight loss potion, and some biotech that's in demand now. That hair growth potion? I've tried it, and it works wonders."

Gazing at Wilmer's thick locks, Isabella's eyes widened. If what Wilmer said was true, these biotech products were like gold mines!

Hair loss is a global issue. It's not just a concern for women; men care about their looks too, especially their hair!

When comparing men of the same age, those who are bald tend to look about 10 years older, while those with a full head of hair appear about 10 years younger. This creates a striking visual age gap of about 20 years between bald men and their peers with hair.

Hair is a man's pride.

Now, as one of the leaders in the four major families, Isabella grasped the immense commercial value of the USB drive in her hands.

"Thanks, Mr. Finley. This USB drive will be a game-changer for me," Isabella said sincerely.

Wilmer waved it off. "No need for thanks. This is all I've got for now. If anything else comes up, I'll let you know."

Isabella nodded and plugged the USB drive into her computer. She planned to back up the data and have experts analyze and develop the information.

As Isabella got to work, Wilmer and Carol left the office.

Once they were gone, Isabella dialed Michael's number.

Michael was at the home gym, trying to get back in shape after slacking off. His muscles had lost some definition, but now that he felt better, he was ready to sweat it out.

Seeing Isabella's call, Michael's heart raced.

'Does Isabella know I'm back on my feet?' Michael pondered, feeling torn.

But soon, Michael steeled himself. Fulfilling his wife's needs as a man was only natural, right? Seven times in one night was just seven hours! He could handle it!

However, when Michael answered Isabella's call, her serious tone caught him off guard.

"Honey, I've got something big to share about my grandpa. I won't be late tonight. Please wait for me at home and don't go out. I need to hear your thoughts," Isabella said seriously.

###chapter 471 Intimate Conversation

Isabella actually left the office on time for once, super eager to fill Michael in on today's crazy events and hoping he could help figure out some solutions.

That evening, while Michael was whipping up dinner, Isabella burst in, grabbed him, pushed him onto the couch, and pinned him down.

Michael swallowed nervously, staring at her. "Hey, are you sure about this now? We're not exactly ready. Let's at least freshen up first."

Isabella shot him a look. "What's on your mind? I'm just a little hyped because I uncovered a major secret."

She got off him.

Watching her leave, Michael's eyes showed disappointment. He was all geared up a moment ago.

"My passion's sparked, and you're telling me you're just a little hyped? Seriously?" Michael looked at her, somewhat miffed.

Ignoring his expression, Isabella quickly washed her hands and then gestured for him to sit at the dining table.

"Hurry up, babe, I can't hold it in any longer. I have to spill the beans. Oh my, it's like something straight out of a novel or a movie," Isabella waved excitedly at him.

Michael walked over and sat across from her. "Okay, babe, what do you want to tell me? I'm curious to hear what kind of story has you so excited."

Isabella's expression turned serious as she ate. "It's about my grandparents. I finally found out why my grandpa broke up the family. He offended someone untouchable, a big shot with government connections. And guess who my grandma is? A genetic scientist!"

Isabella shared the information she got from Wilmer with Michael.

Michael listened in shock. After Isabella finished, he finally gave his two cents.

"Babe, do you know who the president Wilmer mentioned is? His name's Henry Phillips, a very influential new president. So, you're saying our foe is him? Well, that's a possibility," Michael shrugged somewhat helplessly. If it's the president, he does have the power to wipe out one of the four families.

When money talks, truth stays quiet. That's the sway of the four families.

And when power rises, money steps aside. That's the might of power.

Stirring her soup, Isabella propped her face on her hand, looking somewhat helpless. "Honestly, when I heard that our enemy might be the president, I also felt a bit powerless."

Michael chuckled as he watched her. "Let's take it one step at a time, babe. Don't stress about the president being our enemy right now. First, we need to verify the accuracy of this info. We can start by looking into Wilmer's connection to your grandma, and then slowly dig into the past events. With your current strength not fully restored to the family's peak, it would be reckless to provoke an unbeatable enemy at this point."

Isabella's eyes suddenly lit up. "Hey, what if I make a public statement cutting ties with my grandpa? Then we wouldn't have to worry about stirring up enemies, right?"

Michael nearly choked on his soup. "Wait, what did you just say?" He turned towards her, hoping he had misunderstood.

Seeing his exaggerated reaction, Isabella burst into laughter, covering her mouth. "I was just messing with you. How could I actually cut ties with my grandparents? It just reminded me of a novel I once read. A character couldn't avenge his dad, so he cut ties with him directly. It seemed ridiculous at the time."

Michael rolled his eyes. "You almost gave me a heart attack. A lot of what you have now is because you're your grandpa's granddaughter. Your blood carries the family's history. Without that, those under you might not respect your authority."

Rolling her eyes, Isabella nodded. "I know, I don't need a lecture from you."

After dinner, they lay in bed.

Michael held Isabella and asked cautiously, "Hey, what will you do if our enemy really is the president?"

Isabella shook her head, sounding resigned. "I'm not sure. Even Mason would have a tough time dealing with the president."

Michael pondered, tilting his head, as his hand moved towards Isabella's chest, unbuttoning a few buttons on her shirt.

Thinking he was being discreet, Michael assumed Isabella, deep in thought, wouldn't notice. However, he missed the hint of amusement in her eyes.

Not stopping him, Isabella allowed Michael to unbutton her shirt and gently slip his hand through the opening.

Michael's fingers touched Isabella's breasts encased in a bra. Given her status, Isabella wore alluring, high-quality lingerie with good support and luxurious fabric.

As he caressed the bra, Michael said, "If our enemy is indeed the president, maybe we can get involved in the next presidential election."

Feeling Michael's fingers edging towards her bra, Isabella subtly pushed her chest forward, making it easier for him to explore.

"You're onto something, babe. Every presidential election, members of the four families get involved. Darn, I should have thought of that sooner." Isabella suddenly waved her hand in frustration.

This startled Michael, freezing his fingers inside her bra.

"During the last presidential election, everyone assumed my grandpa would continue to support Henry. But just a few days before the election, our family disbanded. Many thought that without my grandfather's backing, Henry would lose, yet he still garnered enough votes. There's definitely something fishy going on," Isabella said, frowning.

###chapter 472 Intimate Relationship

Isabella suddenly realized how crucial the support of the four major families was in the presidential election, a support her family had lost just before the big day.

Lost in thought, Michael said, "So, besides your family, Mason was backing Henry at first, right?"

Isabella nodded, "Yeah, that's right. Mason's family wasn't as powerful back then, even though they were stronger than the other three. But their influence shot up after they sided with the president."

"Usually, if two families support the president, they'd share the benefits. But it looks like your grandpa stepped back on purpose, giving Mason the upper hand. It's all about trading favors to keep the family safe," Michael mused, piecing it all together.

Michael was deep in thought, his eyes narrowing as he tried to untangle the web of interests. Absentmindedly, his hand wandered to Isabella's chest, adjusting its pressure as his thoughts shifted.

Noticing Isabella's flushed face and quickened breath, Michael asked, "Sweetheart, why are you blushing?" His eyes filled with curiosity, sensing something was off.

Embarrassed, Isabella shot Michael a glare and gestured towards his hand on her chest.

It was then that Michael realized what he was doing. He could feel Isabella's heightened arousal, her nipples hardening in response.

"Oops, sorry, babe. That was totally unintentional. I was in my own world," Michael chuckled, ready to pull his hand away, but Isabella stopped him.

"Don't stop, honey, keep going," Isabella's voice grew huskier as she nestled closer to Michael, her words a soft murmur.

Michael felt a restlessness stir within him. While his mind had been elsewhere earlier, Isabella's seductive demeanor now awakened a primal urge in him.

"Babe, even though Mason could back the presidential bid alone, the stakes are high. If it fails, it could spell disaster for the whole family. Mason isn't stupid and wouldn't risk it all. Your grandpa must have made a big sacrifice to sway him. Some of your family's resources were probably used to support the election before the fallout," Michael breathed out.

Isabella gently nodded in Michael's embrace, her delicate fingers undoing his belt, unbuttoning his pants, and slipping inside.

"You're right," Isabella sighed. "When my dad took over, the family accounts were so empty he thought we were bankrupt. That was one of his biggest mistakes. Looking back now, I can't help but feel sorry for him."

She moved closer to Michael, her hand finding its way to his thigh.

Isabella's fingers moved up and down, stoking Michael's escalating desire, causing his body to squirm with anticipation.

"Honey, no need to feel sorry for your pops. Even if your grandpa drained the family funds, keeping the other three businesses afloat shouldn't have been an issue. But what did your dad do? He didn't even bother to salvage the remaining companies, showing he had given up long ago. Remember, his idea of restoring family honor was to marry you off to John, not just for the family's sake but to line his own pockets," Michael panted, his eyes reflecting raw desire.

Isabella suddenly straddled Michael's lap, hands on his shoulders, grinding against his pants.

"You're right, babe. My dad is a mess, selfish to the core. No need to waste pity on him, let's forget about him. How about we switch things up?" Isabella's seductive gaze met Michael's.

Feeling Isabella's heat through his underwear, Michael's desire surged.

"Agreed, babe. Let's focus on us," Michael's desire intensified. He tore off Isabella's top, then cupped her breasts.

"Honey, have your breasts gotten bigger?" Michael's gaze lingered on Isabella's chest as he molded them with his hands.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Thanks to your attention, maybe?"

"Yeah, I almost forgot how they've grown, all thanks to me. Let's make them even better," Michael smirked, then leaned in to nip at Isabella's breast.

Isabella guided Michael's head, pressing his mouth against her chest, the sensation electrifying.

As Michael lavished attention on her breasts, feeling her nipples harden, his hand slipped into Isabella's pants.

His touch grazed her pubic hair before finding her clit.

The wetness on his fingertips confirmed Isabella's physical response to their earlier teasing.

As Michael gently stroked her clit, Isabella writhed with pleasure, her legs parting instinctively.

Sensing her arousal, Michael's fingers moved between her labia.

"Honey, I can't wait, I need you now," Isabella gasped, urging Michael on.

Michael's fingers delved into Isabella, her warmth enveloping him, pulsing with desire.

"Alright, babe, I'll take care of you," Michael swiftly shed his clothes, removed Isabella's underwear, lifted her legs, and entered her.

###chapter 473 Father-son Conversation

The room was thick with tension, Michael's low growls mixing with Isabella's loud moans and the sounds of bodies moving together.

Clothes were scattered all over the floor, and the air was heavy with the scent of sweat and desire. Their passionate encounter hit its peak when Michael let out a deep growl and Isabella screamed.

After their intense moment, they lay on the bed, trying to catch their breath. Isabella looked completely drained but satisfied by Michael's performance. As she panted for air, she slowly drifted off to sleep.

Michael got up from the bed, a smirk on his face as he glanced at the rumpled sheets.

"Babe, let's switch rooms for some shut-eye," Michael nudged Isabella, but she just grunted and kept sleeping.

Seeing Isabella so worn out, Michael felt a sense of accomplishment. The break had rejuvenated him, allowing him to truly shine in the bedroom.

Slipping his arms under Isabella's limp body, Michael lifted her naked form.

Isabella stayed sound asleep, too exhausted to stir.

As Michael prepared to move her to another room, a wave of dizziness hit him as soon as his feet touched the ground, nearly causing him to stumble.

Summoning all his strength, Michael steadied himself. His legs felt like jelly, a sensation he'd never experienced before.

"It looks like my body has recovered a fair bit, but I'm still just barely able to stand," Michael chuckled to himself, eyeing the sleeping Isabella. With unsteady steps, he carried her to a different room.

After tucking Isabella in and making sure she was comfortable, Michael's expression shifted. He went back to the previous room, grabbed his phone from the pile of clothes, and dialed a number.

Michael lost track of how many times they'd made love that night. He only had brief moments to think about Isabella's family matters. Each time he tried to focus, Isabella's allure pulled him back.

Michael finally had the chance to reflect.

The phone flipped in Michael's hand, his expression uncertain, his brows furrowing deeper.

Finally, the flipping stopped, the screen lit up, and Michael quickly found a number to dial.

Michael was calling his father, Kenna. Given the time difference, Kenna might still be awake.

After a few rings, Kenna answered, his voice coming through Michael's phone.

"What's going on, my boy? Why the sudden call? It's early where you are! Got some good news for me?" Kenna asked eagerly, anticipating positive tidings.

Michael couldn't help but smirk. He knew exactly what Kenna was hoping to hear.

Clearing his throat awkwardly, Michael said, "Dad, don't get your hopes up. Isabella isn't expecting. I called for a different reason."

Kenna fell silent on the other end, obviously disappointed.

"Okay, what's on your mind?" Kenna sighed, inquiring.

Michael's demeanor turned serious. "Dad, would you be okay with me bringing all our foreign assets back home?"

Kenna hesitated. "Now? Wasn't the plan to wait a few more years? Seems a bit sudden, doesn't it?"

"Dad, things have changed. The upcoming presidential election is looming. I think this is our opportunity," Michael explained in a hushed tone.

Kenna was puzzled. "What does the election have to do with you? You're not planning to jump into politics, are you? It's risky business, and knowing you, you wouldn't dive in. Is this about Isabella?"

Kenna knew Michael well. Only Isabella's affairs could sway Michael from his original plans.

Michael didn't hold back and shared all he had learned from Isabella with Kenna.

"Dad, it's evident that this guy Jonah is a spy Henry planted in Isabella's family. I'm not sure if he's there for surveillance or searching for something, but Henry is keeping a close eye on Isabella's family. Although I don't fully grasp Isabella's grandpa's intentions, I suspect the family's integration wasn't meant to happen this fast in his original scheme," Michael explained, his expression serious.

Kenna grasped Michael's concerns. "You're right. Knowing Isabella's grandfather, her current status doesn't align with his initial plans. This could raise Henry's suspicions."

Michael spoke earnestly, "The upcoming election might be our shot. If we can prevent Henry from winning, we can help Isabella safeguard the family."

Michael's proposal was straightforward, but Kenna wasn't overly optimistic.

"Michael, you know Henry's popularity is sky-high. The other candidates don't stand a chance against him. It's a daunting level of support. Unless you can chip away at that or boost the others' standings, it's an uphill battle," Kenna cautioned, not to discourage Michael but to advise caution.

Michael nodded confidently. "Don't worry, Dad, I've thought it through. I'm just weighing our options. There's time before the election. I called you for another reason today."

"What's that?" Kenna asked, intrigued.

In a nonchalant tone, Michael inquired, "Have you ever considered Mom as a stand-in for Isabella's grandma?"

###chapter 474 The Story of the Past

Michael was caught off guard by Kenna's silence.

He glanced at his phone and saw the call was still going. It seemed like Kenna was wrestling with something.

Michael's face darkened, like he'd just discovered a betrayal, feeling a mix of anger and sympathy for his mom, Audrey.

"Looks like Mason spilled the beans about the crazy stuff," Kenna's voice sounded relieved, like a weight had been lifted.

Trying to stay calm, Michael asked, "Mason shared a lot about the wild times you two had growing up. But what I really want to know is the answer to that burning question."

There was a brief pause from Kenna, followed by a sigh. "Are you mad on your mom's behalf? No need, she's known about this for ages."

Michael was incredulous. "Are you serious? How could mom agree to be a stand-in?" he asked angrily.

Equally frustrated, Kenna shot back, "Why do you think your mom is a stand-in? Do you really think so little of your dad? My feelings for your mom have nothing to do with Isabella's grandma!"

Kenna seemed fed up with being misunderstood, her tone dripping with frustration and anger.

Michael was left bewildered by Kenna's intense reaction.

"Dad, what's the deal with all this?" Michael asked, puzzled.

Kenna snorted, saying, "From day one with your mom, I joked about her resemblance to an old friend and she even teased if she was my first love. I shared the story of me and Isabella's grandma with her. I didn't want to date her at first, fearing she'd be seen as a replacement. I respected your mom too much for that."

Interrupting Kenna, Michael asked, "Hold up, are you saying mom was the one chasing you back then?"

Kenna's tone held a hint of pride. "Absolutely, I was young, good-looking, talented, and fit-a real catch, if I may say so. Your mom was drawn to me and made her move. I turned her down initially until one night she got me tipsy, things happened, and I gave in."

Michael's expression darkened. "Dad, spare me the lies. A drunk man can't perform, so if mom did sleep with you, you weren't really drunk. Actions speak louder than words."

Coughing awkwardly, Kenna seemed sheepish at Michael's revelation.

"Well, I'm human too, I can be swayed. Your mom pursued me so persistently, if I felt nothing, that'd be a sham. Eventually, I caved to her advances, and after we tied the knot, I stayed faithful. Your mom was never a stand-in; I genuinely loved her!" Kenna emphasized.

Michael lapsed into silence, contemplating whether to trust Kenna, especially considering how deeply Audrey's passing had affected Kenna. Kenna's conversations with Audrey's photo and his lack of interest in other women over the years weighed on Michael's mind.

"Alright, Dad, you've made your case," Michael conceded, then shared his chat with Mason.

Upon hearing Michael's recount, Kenna chuckled, "Mason's still a prankster, even at his age. Never outgrew his antics."

Rolling his eyes, Michael shot back, "If you were more grown-up, you would've met him ages ago."

"Come on, I'm your dad, your words always get under my skin," Kenna grumbled.

Suddenly, Kenna sighed, "But Mason's got a point. Even though I'm over Isabella's grandma, the four of us were tight pals in college. Out of respect for that bond, I should watch out for her descendants."

"Dad, you're reminiscing about Isabella's grandma, not grandpa. Still hung up on her?" Michael teased.

Kenna didn't deny it, snorting, "Mason and I went all out to win over Isabella's grandma back then. But that jerk Patrick swooped in and stole her heart. Do you think I'd have any warm feelings for him? Ask Mason- even after his wife passed, he kept a friendly relationship with that old coot Patrick. Was it all just buddy-buddy?"

Michael's expression soured. He had admired Mason's loyalty to Patrick, but now, he saw their friendship in a different light.

'So, Mason stuck by Patrick for his wife's sake? What a twist.' Michael shook his head with a bitter smile, deciding to keep this revelation from Mason. He didn't want to upset him.

Kenna didn't dwell on the topic and steered the conversation elsewhere.

"You're thinking of bringing the overseas business back home, and I'm on board. You've steered the company to where it is now, and I'm getting up there in years, not keen on the business anymore. But tread carefully. You're not just up against Isabella's foes; your own enemies might target Isabella over this. Can you handle it all?" Kenna cautioned.

Michael fell silent, a shadowy figure creeping into his thoughts-Ryan, his supposed brother, lurking like a snake in the grass, ready to strike at any moment.

"Don't worry, Dad. I've got it under control," Michael assured with a faint smile, knowing what he needed to do.

###chapter 475 Film Investment

Just as Michael was about to shut down his phone and hit the sack, a message popped up on his screen.

It was from Jerry. Instead of calling and waking Michael up, he decided to shoot him a text.

Michael glanced out the window and saw the sky starting to lighten up. Dawn was breaking.

Knowing Jerry wasn't a morning person, Michael figured he must've pulled another all-nighter.

"Should I cut Jerry some slack?" Michael wondered, rubbing his chin.

In the end, Michael decided to give Jerry a break. The guy had been swamped lately. With the push to bring overseas industries back home, Jerry's help would be crucial. When that time comes, Jerry's workload will only get heavier, so it's best to let him chill now.

Meanwhile, after sending a message to Michael, Jerry suddenly sneezed three times in a row.

"Why did I just sneeze three times? Is someone talking about me?" He chuckled to himself. "Oh well, maybe I just caught a chill and didn't get enough rest!" With that, he yawned and flopped onto his bed, falling asleep almost instantly.

He still had four more hours of sleep.

Michael noticed the message from Jerry was actually relayed by Estella.

Estella had asked Jerry to let Michael know that the movie she was filming was facing budget issues. Despite landing a hundred million dollar endorsement deal from John to cover the actors' fees, they soon realized it wasn't nearly enough once production started.

Estella and the director had tried cutting costs, but making a sci-fi movie was expensive, especially with all the special effects needed. They couldn't even afford A-list actors due to their high fees. In fact, Estella herself was acting for free.

After reading the message, Michael turned off his phone and rubbed his chin.

Knowing Estella mentioned the movie, Michael realized a hundred million dollars wouldn't cut it. Though not an expert in the film industry, based on recent sci-fi movie trends, he estimated they'd need at least two hundred million dollars to finish the film.

An idea struck Michael, but it required calling Jerry. Thinking it was too late, Michael assumed Jerry was already asleep and decided to let his hardworking subordinate rest. He didn't want such a valuable employee burning out.

"Forget it, I'll call him tomorrow. Making a movie isn't a quick fix," Michael shrugged, stashed his phone, and headed to another room.

Isabella was still asleep. Sensing Michael's absence, she instinctively wrapped the blanket around her legs.

Gently tugging the blanket off Isabella, Michael slipped into bed. Feeling something missing in her embrace, Isabella's hands searched until they found Michael.

Isabella immediately hugged him tightly, draping her legs over him like a koala clinging to a tree.

Struggling to free his arm, Michael hugged her head and planted a light kiss on her forehead.

"Feeling so beat, babe. Sweet dreams," Michael whispered in Isabella's ear before closing his eyes.

While some were catching Z's, others were hustling in the city, like Estella.

At that moment, Estella was hashing out the next plot with the director, Zachary Baker, on set.

Zachary was impressed with Estella's performance, but thinking about the film's progress, his expression darkened.

"Ms. Foster, you sure your husband can bring in the investment?" Zachary looked at Estella expectantly.

Estella felt a bit uneasy since one billion dollars was no small sum.

"It should work out, but my husband's swamped right now. He might not reply right away. I'll nudge him in a few days," Estella said.

Zachary's eyes lit up with hope. "I hope your husband sees the potential in this film. It could be a game-changer in sci-fi history."

"He will. Let's get back to the plot," Estella said, steering the conversation back to the script.

'Hoping Mr. Williams will invest in me, given my recent success,' Estella sighed inwardly.

Another day rolled by. Urged by Carol, Isabella reluctantly got out of bed, dressed, and hurried to freshen up in the bathroom.

"Enough, Carol. I know work's demanding, but I need personal space! It's been over a month since I've been intimate with my husband. I just had a night of pleasure!" Isabella grumbled to her phone while brushing her teeth.

Carol's stern voice came through. "Goodness, do you hear yourself? This company is your family's legacy, and I've been busting my butt! I've got dark circles under my eyes, and you're thinking about romance?"

Feeling guilty seeing how hard Carol had been working, Isabella was about to respond when she heard a man's voice on the line.

"Darling, who are you chatting with? I miss your kisses... and after last night, I can barely move - you really wore me out." Joe's mischievous voice echoed through the phone.

"Aw, hush," Carol's panicked voice chimed in.

Raising an eyebrow, Isabella coolly replied, "Thought you were already at the office."

"Well, I've been tired too and need some TLC, but let's race to the office and see who gets there first," Carol awkwardly chuckled.

Rolling her eyes, Isabella shot back, "Not playing these games. I'll head to the office after brushing up and grabbing breakfast."

Carol nodded. "Got it. We'll chat about other stuff once you're in."

"What stuff?" Isabella was about to ask when the call abruptly ended.

Isabella stared at her phone in silence, Carol's words still ringing in her ears: "Come on baby, let's wrap this up in half an hour?"

###chapter 476 Seeking Help

When Isabella strolled into the office, she immediately noticed Carol's sour expression.

Raising an eyebrow, Isabella glanced at the clock. She'd only been gone from home for about 30 minutes. Judging by Carol's face, the issue wasn't about her.

"Did your guy miss your 30-minute deadline?" Isabella teased.

Carol rolled her eyes. "We went at it five times last night. But this morning, he couldn't get it up. No matter what I did, he stayed soft. It's so frustrating."

Carol's tone was dripping with annoyance.

Isabella smirked. "Too much information, Carol."

Still fuming about Joe, Carol turned to Isabella. "Your husband's been recovering from an injury at home. You two probably haven't been intimate during this time! You must be feeling pent up. The doc says couples should get busy at least twice a week! How many times did your man satisfy you last night?"

Isabella sighed and rubbed her forehead. "Enough, Carol. Let's not get into this at work. It's private. Seven times."

Carol's eyes widened. "Seven times? When did you finish?"

Isabella shrugged. "Not sure, but it was almost dawn."

Yawning, Isabella decided to change the subject. "You mentioned something important to discuss. What's up?"

After a moment, Carol remembered. "Remember Ms. Foster? She reached out today, wanting to chat about investing in a movie."

Hearing Estella's name and the movie, Isabella suddenly recalled a script Michael had shown her. Michael had mentioned the director planning to cast Estella as the lead.

"Is it that sci-fi flick?" Isabella mumbled to herself.

Curious, Carol leaned in. "You know about that movie? Read the script? How's it? Worth investing in?"

Carol, having just acquired the Brown Family's assets, needed to boost their reputation quickly. Making a movie seemed like a great option.

Isabella shook her head. "Not sure if it's the one I'm thinking of. If it is, the investment would be huge-at least a hundred million dollars conservatively."

Carol immediately shook her head. "A hundred million dollars? Are you serious? Even with the Brown Family's assets, it'll take time to cash out. We need a ton of cash. Movies are a risky business. If we tank, the losses will be massive!" Carol dismissed the idea after hearing Isabella's estimate.

Despite Carol's dismissal, Isabella still intended to meet Estella first, given her connection to that mysterious man and the positive impression Isabella had of her.

Back in her office, Isabella phoned Estella and invited her for a chat.

At that moment, Estella had just wrapped up a scene on set and decided to take a break, heading to Isabella's office.

Sporting dark circles from a night of shooting, Estella looked a bit worn out. Nonetheless, she gathered her energy and entered the company building.

As she stepped into the elevator, Estella took a deep breath. She had discussed the need for additional investment in the movie with Michael, who directed her to Isabella, assuring her that the funds would be provided once she laid out the requirements.

Estella didn't fully grasp Michael's motives but now understood his connection to Isabella. She suspected Michael aimed to boost Isabella's influence through this venture. If Isabella agreed, the movie would promote her company. If not, Michael would cover the investment for Estella.

'Either way, funding for the shoot is sorted.' With a light stride, Estella entered Isabella's office.

"Ms. Foster, long time no see. Please, take a seat!" Isabella warmly greeted Estella, shaking her hand and motioning for her to sit on the couch. She then asked Juliet to prepare two cups of coffee.

"Ms. Taylor, hi. Last time, things got a bit awkward with Zoey. Hope you're okay with that," Estella said, her expression holding a touch of formality and respect.

Surprised by Estella's politeness, Isabella felt it was unnecessary.

Despite Isabella's influence rivaling the major families, Estella's background was equally impressive, making such formality uncalled for.

"Ms. Foster, you're being too formal. The past is in the past. No need for apologies." Isabella observed curiously.

Embarrassed, Estella waved it off. She couldn't reveal the real reason-their shared husband. She was the imposter, and Isabella was the real deal.

"I actually wanted to chat about investing in my new movie. I might have been a bit too respectful because I need your support," Estella winked, hinting her earlier demeanor was all in jest.

###chapter 477 No Money

Estella passed the script over to Isabella.

Isabella let out a sigh as she glanced through it. It was the same sci-fi blockbuster script Michael had shown her earlier.

Instead of closing it right away, Isabella decided to give it a proper read. She noticed some changes from the version Michael had shared before, and these tweaks really improved the script.

Seeing Estella's hopeful look, Isabella couldn't help but give a small, wry smile.

Even though Isabella was now one of the leaders of the four major families, she didn't have the cash to invest in this movie. Even if she wanted to take the risk, the higher-ups would shoot it down.

There was no bad blood between Isabella and Estella; they both seemed to want to be friends. Isabella didn't want to turn Estella down directly, making things a bit awkward.

Just then, Juliet walked in with coffee and set it down in front of them.

Isabella had an idea. "Juliet, can you go get Ms. Lester for me?"

Juliet nodded and went to fetch Carol.

On the way to Isabella's office, Carol curiously asked Juliet why Isabella had called for her.

"I think it's to turn her down. Since Ms. Foster's husband used to be Ms. Taylor's boss, she doesn't want to reject Ms. Foster outright because it might mess up their friendship. So, she needs someone else to step in and say what she really wants to say. I'm not the right person, so it's up to you," Juliet explained, having figured out Isabella's intentions from their time together.

Rolling her eyes, Carol remarked, "Ah, I get it. So, I'm the sacrificial lamb here, huh?"

Juliet chuckled softly, covering her mouth. "That's because you oversee the two most crucial departments, Human Resources and Finance. Only your status qualifies you to step in on Ms. Taylor's decisions. I can't do it since I'm just an assistant."

Before entering the office, Carol gave Juliet a once-over. "You've picked things up fast. Your words always put people at ease."

Juliet shrugged and ushered Carol into the office.

Seeing Carol enter, Isabella gestured for her to sit.

"Ms. Foster, meet Ms. Lester, the head of our company's Finance and Human Resources departments," Isabella introduced them briefly.

Estella smiled at Carol. "I know Ms. Lester is a big shot in the business world. I didn't realize she oversaw the two most crucial departments. Ms. Taylor must have a lot of faith in you."

Carol chuckled and shook her head. "I appreciate Ms. Taylor's trust, but I wouldn't mind fewer tasks. I can't remember my last vacation."

After the joke, they circled back to the topic of movie investment.

Isabella handed the script to Carol.

After reading the script, Carol exclaimed, "What a brilliant concept! Equipping Earth with a booster to venture beyond the solar system in search of a new human habitat. This idea is incredible!"

"Really, Ms. Lester? That's awesome! If this movie gets made, it'll be a game-changer in sci-fi history!" Estella exclaimed, pleasantly surprised.

But Carol kept her cool and asked, "Ms. Foster, how much more investment does this movie need?"

Estella held up a finger. "We need another hundred million dollars."

Doing the math in her head, Carol realized that one hundred million dollars wouldn't cut it, meaning Estella had already put in some cash.

Carol scrutinized Estella and asked, "Ms. Foster, isn't it usually the director's or other crew members' job to secure investments for the movie? As the lead actress, shouldn't you be exempt from this? Let me guess, you're also an investor in this movie, right?"

Estella nodded with a rueful smile. "Yeah, I've already put in one hundred million dollars. You must know about the hefty endorsement fee I got earlier. I poured all my money into it, but it's still not enough."

Frowning, Carol asked, "Have you approached John?"

Recalling her unsuccessful attempt to get John on board, Estella replied helplessly, "I did. I wanted him to invest from the start. But he turned me down, saying the movie lacked investment value. We had a disagreement, and in the end, he opted to pay me a billion dollars in endorsement fees."

Carol and Isabella exchanged knowing looks, both questioning John's judgment.

However, Isabella seemed to grasp the situation better. Given John's current business ventures, it wasn't that he couldn't afford one hundred million dollars; it was just a hefty sum. With the Olympics on the horizon, substantial investments were necessary. John's reluctance to allocate more funds to this project made sense.

"What about your husband? He shouldn't be short on cash, right?" Carol asked, posing the second and most critical question.

Estella gave another wry smile. "It's a bit of a competition between he and me. He's always wanted me to star in the movies he picks, but I prefer to make the movies I want. We clashed on this, so I decided to challenge him. If I can create a successful movie without his support, he'll stop interfering with my choices."

"I see," Carol nodded, her expression shifting to slight discomfort.

"Ms. Foster, we believe in this movie too, but our company doesn't currently have the capacity to put up one hundred million dollars," Carol reluctantly informed Estella.

A tinge of disappointment crossed Estella's features. "I'm sorry, Ms. Taylor, Ms. Lester. I overstepped and didn't take this into account. I apologize. Looks like I'll have to figure something out elsewhere."

Estella apologized to Carol and Isabella, then rose from the couch.

"I've got to head out now. We filmed late last night, and I need to catch up on sleep," Estella said, yawning and bidding farewell.

###chapter 478 Buying Lottery Tickets

Isabella and Carol walked Estella downstairs, watching her hop into the car before they headed back.

"I can't shake the feeling that Ms. Foster was a bit let down, but not totally surprised. She didn't seem too upset though," Carol said, rubbing her chin.

Isabella chuckled and patted Carol's arm. "Why would she be all negative? Even if Ms. Foster didn't secure the investment, she could always turn to her husband for help. It's just a clash of ideas, not emotions. If she plays it right, her husband will surely come through for her."

Carol found Isabella's perspective sensible and put the matter aside.

They took the elevator back to their offices to get back to work.

Meanwhile, after leaving Isabella's company, Estella immediately called Michael.

"Mr. Williams, Ms. Taylor turned down my proposal. She said the company's finances couldn't handle such a risky investment," Estella informed Michael.

Michael nodded. "Don't worry, you'll get the investment soon."

Estella's eyes widened in surprise before she hung up.

'These couples always like to make things complicated. What's the point of all this?' Estella thought with a wry smile. It was just their marital banter; what did it have to do with her as an outsider?

Back at the office, Estella understood why Isabella had brought Carol in.

Seeing the script, Isabella probably considered rejecting Estella's request but hesitated due to Estella's status, so she brought in Carol to help express her thoughts.

Although Estella could read Isabella's mind, she wasn't upset, as she knew the outcome from the start. She was here just to fulfill a somewhat odd task.

"Bored on set, might as well chill," Estella yawned, telling the driver to wake her up when they reached the hotel before dozing off in the back seat.

After hanging up with Estella, Michael immediately called Jerry.

Jerry was already in the office, looking tired from lack of sleep.

Upon answering Michael's call, Jerry asked urgently, "What's up, Mr. Williams? What do you need?"

Michael nodded. "I've got three things for you."

Jerry grabbed a pen and a piece of paper, jotting down notes. "Go ahead, Mr. Williams, I'll get them done."

"The first thing is to discreetly look into Wilmer's and Isabella's grandma's identities. The second is how's the progress on the lottery jackpot plan I asked you to work on last time?" Michael didn't mention the third thing right away.

Jerry nodded, saying, "Don't worry, Mr. Williams, I've already assigned the second task, and it's done. Once you give the green light, our company will kick off the promotion."

"Great, once the ad campaign is done, make sure to send over the drinks with the winning details," Michael said, sounding pleased.

"Got it, Mr. Williams. What's the third thing?" Jerry yawned, still jotting down notes.

Michael grinned. "The third thing is I'm giving you a two-week vacation. And I'm throwing in the use of a private plane. You pick the destination, all expenses on me."

Jerry's pen froze, and he stared at his phone in disbelief. The caller ID showed Michael's name, and he wondered if he had misheard.

"Mr. Williams, are you serious about the two-week vacation?" Jerry asked, amazed.

Michael chuckled. "What's the matter? Don't you want a break? Since you seem to enjoy work so much, I'll add some extra tasks for you."

"No, no, no, Mr. Williams, I don't enjoy work at all. I mean, I really need a break now. I've been feeling exhausted lately," Jerry exclaimed with excitement.

Michael nodded calmly. "You've been putting in a lot of effort. Take a good rest, but make sure to wrap up urgent tasks before you go. The less pressing ones can wait until you're back."

Jerry happily agreed and hung up.

"I get to skip work tomorrow. Vacation time, here I come!" Jerry gleefully pranced around the office, making odd noises.

After the call, Michael could picture Jerry's elation. But that was none of his concern.

Rubbing his chin, Michael dialed another number. "I'll need to lean more on Mike for a while. He might not be as sharp in business as Jerry, but he should manage for two weeks."

After calming down, he remembered an urgent task. He promptly sorted out the lottery plan and packed for his trip home.

Once Jerry left, news of a promotion spread like wildfire online.

A popular beverage company was gearing up for a lottery with a grand prize of $100 million! The company would cover all taxes, so the winner would pocket the full $100 million! Even the secondary prizes were enticing, including phones, gadgets, and consolation prizes of $10 or $20.

Fans of the beverage went wild, stocking up in hopes of hitting the jackpot.

After seeing the promotion, Michael called Isabella.

"Hey babe, have you seen the buzz online? Buy a drink, get a shot at a hundred million bucks!" Michael said, trying to sound enthusiastic.

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Sweetheart, how likely is it that this falls into our laps? Remember that other beverage company that promised a fighter jet to the cap collector? They ended up reneging on the deal."

###chapter 479 Gone Mad

Michael couldn't believe Isabella didn't buy into the whole hundred million dollar grand prize thing.

A grin spread across his face. If she didn't believe, then what was the point of all this?

Sure, winning could be a killer marketing move, bringing in huge profits for his beverage company. But that wasn't really what Michael was after.

"Honey, you know me. I'm all about these drinks, especially with a hundred million bucks on the line. Let's give it a shot," Michael said casually.

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Babe, those drinks are packed with sugar. I don't want you getting diabetes. And I don't remember you being a big fan of them."

Michael smirked. He hadn't expected her to jump straight to diabetes. His health was fine, but he didn't usually drink much, so he needed a good excuse.

"I just want to try our luck. Maybe we'll hit the jackpot. And even if we don't, no biggie. We can enjoy them slowly," Michael reasoned.

Isabella shrugged. It was just a few cases of drinks, not a big deal. If Michael wanted to give it a go, she wouldn't stop him.

"Okay, go ahead and try. But don't get too obsessed if you don't win big. If you want a billion dollars, just wait. My company's doing great, and I can easily give you a billion. Just stay healthy, take care of yourself, and take care of me," Isabella said with a chuckle.

Michael's face fell, feeling like he was relying on a woman.

"Don't worry, I'll take care of myself, but not for that billion dollars," Michael muttered.

"Well, if that's how you feel, go ahead and do your thing. I'll catch you later," Isabella said before hanging up.

Michael sighed and shook his head. "Am I really relying on a woman now? This is something else."

The buzz around the hundred million dollar grand prize started to spread online, with many people catching wind of the massive prize these drinks offered. Some thought it was just a marketing ploy, doubting the existence of such a huge prize. But many still held onto hope.

People began buying these drinks in hopes of winning big, causing them to fly off the shelves in stores.

Just selling drinks wouldn't bring in much profit. With the skyrocketing sales, Michael quickly had other companies reaching out for promotional collaborations.

The first to come knocking were gaming companies looking for more exposure. These deals would bring in a nice chunk of change for Michael.

But money wasn't Michael's main concern. As the boss, he could delegate everything to his team. He didn't even need Jerry to handle these matters.

Michael had his mind on something else. With more and more people winning prizes like cameras, phones, and even high-value items through the lottery, the excitement was spreading like wildfire.

As winners shared their success stories online and showed off their prizes, the frenzy grew, with everyone eyeing that elusive hundred million dollar grand prize.

Michael found it odd that Jerry hadn't delivered the drinks yet, even though several days had passed.

Frowning, Michael tried calling Jerry, only to find his phone turned off. Michael's expression darkened immediately.

"Damn guy, I told him to take a break, but does that mean he can't even pick up urgent calls?" Michael muttered in frustration.

Meanwhile, Isabella had been caught up with something else lately, feeling ecstatic. Wilmer had finally completed the hair growth serum. When Wilmer presented the serum to Isabella, explaining its effects, she felt like she was in a sci-fi movie.

"You're telling me this can make hair grow in just 8 hours?" Isabella stared at the cream in Wilmer's hand in disbelief.

While Isabella trusted the genetic drugs produced by Sloane, the idea of visible results in 8 hours seemed incredible.

"If you don't believe me, I can show you right now," Wilmer said, pulling out an electric shaver from his pocket and shaving his head bald right in front of Isabella.

"Oh my goodness, are you out of your mind?" Isabella exclaimed, standing up from behind her desk, shocked.

Juliet, standing behind Isabella, was equally taken aback by the unexpected sight.

It wasn't until the floor was covered in hair that Isabella finally accepted the reality before her. Wilmer had indeed shaved his head bald right in front of her.

Approaching Isabella, Wilmer lowered his head to show her his bald scalp.

A slight smile played on Isabella's lips. "I see it, you now have very short hair, not even enough to grab with your nails."

"In fact, this electric shaver left my hair at 0.04 inches," Wilmer added, even pulling out a ruler.

Isabella waved off the ruler and asked, "Did you really have to go that far?"

Wilmer nodded earnestly and applied the hair growth serum to his head. "Trust me, Ms. Taylor, by the end of today, you'll see my hair has grown at least 0.2 inches."

Isabella sighed and instructed Juliet to have the office cleaned.

After Juliet left, Isabella remarked, "Sometimes you scientists really do seem like a bunch of madmen."

Wilmer shrugged. "It's inevitable, Ms. Taylor. I can't have my bald colleagues try it out, can I? Since the human trial approval hasn't come through yet, I had to test it on myself."

Isabella's lips curled into a smile again, then she weakly waved her hand, resting it against her forehead. "You can go now. See you in 8 hours."

###chapter 480 Astonishing Effect

After Wilmer took off, she wandered over to the big window and gazed out at the city below.

Juliet showed up with a vacuum cleaner and started cleaning up the hair on the floor. "Ms. Taylor, what's on your mind?" Juliet asked, curious.

Isabella turned around and sighed, "Oh, just thinking about how crazy scientists can be sometimes."

Juliet looked confused. "Do you really think hair can grow in just 8 hours, Ms. Taylor?"

Isabella thought for a moment and then nodded. "As wild as it sounds, I trust Wilmer. He doesn't seem like the lying type."

Juliet got excited. "If this hair thing hits the market, can I get some first? My dad's obsessed with his thinning hair."

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Is your dad really that obsessed with his hair?"

Juliet nodded with a wry smile. "Oh, he's obsessed. His hair's thinning so much, he can count each strand. I doubt anyone else names each hair out of boredom."

Juliet mimicked her dad, holding a strand of hair and pretending to cry, "Oh no, Parker fell out yesterday, and now Hamira's gone too! Why are they jumping ship? I can't even wear a hat or go outside, afraid a gust of wind will blow my buddies away."

Isabella burst into laughter, leaning on the table. "Your dad's hilarious."

Juliet stopped her act and shrugged. "You know, right? I do it to keep him happy."

After sharing a good laugh, Isabella, feeling more relaxed, told Juliet, "Before we leave, I'll call Wilmer to clarify. I need to confirm if hair follicles can sprout on a scalp with dead ones."

Juliet joyfully hugged Isabella. "You're my good luck charm, Ms. Taylor."

Isabella smiled. "Ever since I met my husband, luck's been on my side."

Meanwhile, in the yard, Michael sneezed and asked Mike over the phone, "Did Jerry leave everything to you before taking off, even the task of delivering drinks to me?"

Sitting behind Jerry's desk, sipping red wine, Mike nodded. "Yeah, Mr. Williams. Jerry mentioned we need to get the winning items notarized to convince everyone about the $100 million prize. But to keep the drinks with the special labels out of sight from the notary, we'll need some wiggle room." Mike propped his feet up on Jerry's desk.

Jerry was usually neat and wouldn't disrespect the desk like this. Mike's action was subtle payback for Jerry's late-night call.

Michael wasn't worried about the wiggle room Mike mentioned; he just asked, "How's it going?"

Mike nonchalantly nodded, "All good, it'll be in your hands soon. No sweat."

Before Mike could finish, someone burst into the office, startling him. "Mr. Runyon, I..." The person began, but Mike quickly hung up.

"What's the deal?" Mike asked irritably, recognizing the person responsible for hiding the winning drinks.

The staff member awkwardly admitted, "We've mixed up the winning drinks. They're in a container, but we've lost track of which one."

A sense of dread washed over Mike. Urgently, he asked, "Can't you scan the QR code on the drinks with your phone? Scan them to find the right one. If needed, get more people to scan."

Regrettably, the staff member replied, "Sorry, Mr. Runyon, the QR code is a one-time scan. Once used, it's sent to headquarters, and the prize is claimed."

Frustrated, Mike covered his face. He snapped, "Didn't you mark the drinks in any way?"

The staff member explained, "Mr. Nelson usually handled marking the winning drinks. I assumed you knew. When I realized you hadn't visited the warehouse, I came to you."

Taking a deep breath, Mike couldn't stay put. He paced with his hand on his head.

A sudden realization hit Mike. He turned to the staff member and asked, "How many drinks are in the container?"

Meanwhile, Michael stared at the disconnected call, narrowing his eyes.

"Have I been too soft on them lately? Hanging up on me is one thing, but now someone has the nerve to cut the call?" Michael's grip on the phone tightened.

His phone rang again; it was Mike. "What was that about? Why the sudden hang-up?" Michael questioned coldly.

Mike chuckled, "The notary office staff barged in, I was worried about getting caught and had to end it quick."

Michael felt suspicious, sensing Mike was hiding something.

"I've got a lot on my plate, Mr. Williams. I need to run. The drinks are on their way-just a bit delayed, but they'll be there soon," Mike said quickly before hanging up.

Perplexed, Michael didn't dwell on it. Even if there were more drinks than expected, what harm could it do?

However, a few days later, when Michael saw a hefty truck pull up in front of his house, his expression froze.

###chapter 481 Lottery

Isabella was over the moon lately because Wilmer's experiment had been a smashing success.

After work, Wilmer swung by Isabella's office, and his hair, which had been a measly 0.04 inches long, had grown to a solid 0.2 inches!

Isabella asked if the hair growth serum could work on a scalp with dead follicles.

"No worries, Mr. Williams. My scalp's follicles were dead before, but this serum brought them back to life," Wilmer reassured Isabella, getting her all excited.

Juliet asked for a sample of the serum.

After Isabella gave the go-ahead, Wilmer handed Juliet a small bottle of the cream. "This should be enough for one application for your dad. Let me know how it goes by tomorrow."

Juliet happily left with the cream. The next day, she excitedly reported back to Wilmer and Isabella that the results were amazing, even reviving dead follicles.

"We need to start mass-producing this stuff and cash in big time!" Isabella said, quickly getting ready for a meeting. But then it hit her-there could be spies from rival families in the company. Unveiling this breakthrough product might be too risky.

Considering this, Isabella called in Carol.

"I'm thinking of setting up a production line for the hair growth cream first. Once it's up and running, we can announce the plan. But in the meantime, I need you to sniff out the spies from the major families quickly," Isabella told Carol seriously.

When Isabella had just taken over as the CEO of the three companies, the lack of manpower was a major issue. So, when dealing with spies from other factions, she had to turn a blind eye because she still needed them to work for her.

Now that Isabella had absorbed the Brown Family's business, manpower was the least of her concerns. For any position that needed filling, she could simply post a job listing and applicants would flood in.

Carol had no qualms about Isabella's request. In fact, she had been preparing for these matters lately. Even if Isabella hadn't mentioned it, she would have raised the issue in upcoming meetings.

"Don't worry, Ms. Taylor, I'll make sure the company is spotless and weed out all those spies," Carol declared with determination. This was her forte.

After getting Carol's assurance, Isabella was highly content and began setting up the production line under Wilmer's guidance.

The spies embedded within the company naturally caught wind of Isabella's plans to set up the production line but were clueless about what she intended to sell.

John lounged on the couch, listening to the reports from his subordinates, his brows furrowed in deep thought.

"Don't tell me you guys haven't found out anything yet?" John looked displeased at the subordinate briefing him.

The subordinate shook his head with a wry smile. "Mr. Williams, we're totally in the dark about what Isabella's planning to sell. We've asked around, but no one has a clue. Even the production line setup is all Isabella's doing."

Bianca, holding a book, curiously asked the subordinate, "Did you check the equipment? Knowing what she bought could give us a clue about what she's planning to make, right?"

The subordinate grumbled internally about Bianca's sharpness. If she could think of that, how could he not?

"Ms. Taylor, we looked into that too. We found out Isabella purchased a wide range of items spanning biotechnology, pharmaceutical technology, mechanical manufacturing, and even chemical engineering, so we can't pinpoint what she's aiming to sell," the subordinate explained with a wry smile.

John contemplated thoughtfully. "Isabella overseeing the production line herself indicates this product is crucial. But her secrecy suggests she's already uncovered spies in the company to prevent leaks."

Bianca nodded in agreement. "If that's the case, it won't be long before Isabella cleans house and gets rid of those spies."

John fully endorsed Bianca's analysis.

"Tell our people to lay low and try to sway other employees in Isabella's company. If our folks get ousted, at least we'll still have spies in place," John instructed his subordinate.

The subordinate nodded. "Understood, Mr. Williams, I'll get on it right away."

"Keep a close watch. I want to crack what Isabella's up to." John gestured, and the subordinate exited.

Bianca asked curiously, "Honey, why are you so fixated on what Isabella's selling?"

John caressed Bianca's silky hair and sighed softly. "Each of the four major families has some hidden aces. No one knows if Paxton has any secrets. I'm not intrigued by Isabella; I'm after the Brown Family's secrets."

Bianca found John's logic sound but then shook her head. She and Jonah were in cahoots now. If the Brown Family did have any secrets, Jonah would have spilled the beans by now.

Since Jonah's escape from the Brown Family, he hadn't contacted Bianca once - suggesting whatever he was looking for either didn't exist, or simply wasn't worth his time.

Lost in thought, Bianca was abruptly brought back by John's voice.

"By the way, dear, are you interested in getting involved in a movie?" John's question caught Bianca off guard.

"A movie? You mean you want me to act?" Bianca's eyes lit up with interest.

But John shook his head. "I just thought you might be bored at home and wanted to find something for you. I was thinking you might like to be an investor. A director approached me recently about a sci-fi film. I see it as an opportunity."

Bianca was intrigued but then recalled something. "The sci-fi film you mentioned isn't the one Ms. Foster mentioned, is it?"

###chapter 482 The Big Truck

When Bianca asked her question, John felt like she was messing with him.

"Babe, this joke is so not funny. How did such a terrible script even get to me? If it wasn't for Estella's connections, I'd be ripping it to shreds right now," John said with a smirk.

The last time they were at the restaurant, John was dying to trash that movie about escaping Earth.

John remembered Estella saying that Michael didn't want to invest in the movie, which led to a fight and Estella had to find other investors.

"In some ways, Michael and I still have the same taste. I thought that movie was a total waste of money and would definitely flop. Just like how Michael married a useless woman," John continued to mock Estella's judgment.

Bianca wasn't bothered by John's teasing; she was more curious about why this movie had caught his eye.

John quickly grabbed his tablet and pulled up his email, where the director had sent him the script.

Handing the tablet to Bianca, John grinned and said, "Check this out, babe. The director is Vincent Woods, a big shot with tons of awards for his sci-fi movies. And the cast he's looking at is top-tier. Just their star power alone will bring in big bucks."

Bianca skimmed through the script, which was about dwindling human resources and finding a renewable energy source in space. Humans bring this energy back to Earth but end up being hunted by another cosmic species because it's their food source too.

Basically, humans are stealing. But to survive, the global government shifts the blame to ensure humanity's survival, sparking a war for dominance.

The movie's big draw is the clash with these alien civilizations. Humans build a massive cannon in the city, using Earth as its base, capable of blasting through the alien civilization's interstellar fortress!

Just from reading the script, Bianca could picture the epic scenes, especially with the director's notes on which A-list actors would play each character, including one of Bianca's favorite movie stars.

"This script is amazing, babe! I love it!" Bianca said excitedly, looking at John.

John hugged Bianca, gently stroking her belly, and said with a smile, "I'm planning to invest in an entertainment company soon. This movie will be our golden ticket! Our kid will inherit a huge entertainment empire."

Bianca's excitement soared. She believed that with John's skills, they could make it happen.

"You're amazing, babe, thank you," Bianca said, hugging John tightly and giving him a passionate kiss.

Feeling his heart race, John held back his desires to protect the baby in Bianca's belly.

"Sweetheart, once our baby is here, I can't wait to reconnect with you," John said, catching his breath.

Bianca nodded. "Honey, I've heard that even pregnant women can get back to being intimate after five or six months."

John hesitated but decided to play it safe.

"Let's hold off on that, darling. Your health and our baby come first," John said with a smile.

Bianca wasn't upset; she knew John's focus was on their unborn child, not just their physical relationship.

"Even if we can't be intimate, let me show you some love," Bianca said, wrapping her arms around John's neck, sitting on his lap, and showering him with kisses.

Meanwhile, Michael and Isabella arrived home from work, sharing a deep kiss as they walked in.

"Honey, we've finally got the production line up and running!" Isabella said, beaming at Michael.

Michael, already aware of the miraculous hair growth cream from Isabella, was thrilled that the production line was operational.

"That's awesome, honey. Your hard work has paid off," Michael said, holding Isabella close and gazing at her lovingly.

Just as Michael leaned in for another kiss, Isabella suddenly pulled away.

"What's wrong? Honey, what's going on?" Michael asked, confused.

Isabella tilted her head, crossed her arms, and looked at Michael. "Honey, didn't you say you were going to buy some cases of drinks to enter that hundred million-dollar lottery? I haven't seen any drinks arriving lately."

Michael scratched his head, feeling a bit embarrassed. "I ordered them online. Maybe there's a delay in delivery because of the high demand for drinks recently. They should be here today."

Remembering the recent rush for drinks, Isabella didn't question Michael's explanation.

"If we do win the million dollars, what would you do with it, honey?" Michael asked, hugging Isabella and grinning.

Isabella thought for a moment. "If we win, I think I'd invest in Ms. Foster's movie. Company funds have a specific purpose, but your lottery winnings are personal, not business funds."

Michael playfully tapped Isabella's nose. "Honey, what are you talking about? My money is yours too. I'm all in for your movie investment."

Isabella laughed, about to respond when she suddenly felt the ground shake.

"Is that an earthquake? Why is the ground shaking?" Isabella wondered, knowing they weren't in an earthquake-prone area.

"Maybe it's my drinks arriving? I heard there were quite a few," Michael joked, but then his expression turned serious.

"What's happening, honey?" Isabella followed Michael's gaze and saw a large truck slowly approaching their house.

"Are you Mr. Williams? Your drinks have been delivered. Please sign here," the driver called out, jumping out of the truck and knocking on the door.

###chapter 483 One Hundred Million Dollar Prize

Michael scribbled his name on the receipt, wincing as the truck driver told the crew to start unloading.

It took almost an hour to get all the drinks off the truck.

"Alright, your stuff's here, we're outta here," the truck driver shouted to Michael before driving off.

Michael looked around the villa, now packed with drinks, his mouth twitching.

Isabella gave Michael a sideways glance.

"Honey, when you said a few boxes of drinks, did you mean a few shipping containers? How long are you planning to swim in all these? Or are you thinking of drowning in them?" Isabella sighed, feeling helpless.

Michael rubbed his face hard, silently cursing Mike for this mess.

"Sweetheart, I think there might've been a mix-up. Maybe I accidentally added an extra zero when I ordered. It's probably a misunderstanding. Hang tight, let me see if I can return them," Michael said, chuckling as he dialed a number.

Isabella sighed, grabbed a bottle from one of the boxes, twisted the cap open, and took a sip. The drink tasted fine, but Isabella rarely indulged in such beverages. She was just annoyed with Michael.

Meanwhile, Michael called Mike.

After a couple of rings, Mike answered, chuckling.

"So, Mr. Williams, enjoying the drinks?" Mike asked, grinning.

Michael growled into the phone, "I swear, I feel like cracking your head open to see if it's filled with soda! I asked for a few boxes, meaning not more than 10! But you sent me a truckload! What am I supposed to do with all these drinks? Take a bath in them?"

Michael was fuming. He didn't even like drinks, so why send him so many? And even if it was a lottery, how long would it take to find that $100 million bottle? With this many drinks, he'd probably have to draw for a day and a night.

Mike's embarrassed laughter crackled through the phone. "I'm really sorry, Mr. Williams. There was a mix-up, so we had to deliver all the drinks from the same batch to you. Take your time with the lottery."

Michael sighed, missing Jerry at that moment. Mike could handle mischief, pranks, espionage, even kidnapping for ransom, but he couldn't manage simple tasks.

Jerry, on vacation at the beach, watching bikini-clad beauties play volleyball in the distance, suddenly sneezed.

"How odd, why do I feel like someone's thinking about me? Have I won over those ladies with my charm?" Jerry chuckled, smoothed his hair as he strolled out from under the umbrella.

"Hey, miss, need help with sunscreen?" Jerry offered a sunbathing beauty.

The woman responded coldly, "No, go away."

Jerry shrugged, "Alright."

Back at the villa, after giving Mike a piece of his mind, Michael reluctantly ended the call.

"Jerry won't be back for at least another 10 days. Darn it, I hope Mike doesn't stir up more trouble," Michael sighed, tapping his forehead.

'With all these drinks, how long will it take to scan these codes?' Michael grumbled, cursing Mike silently as he made his way toward the villa.

Just as Michael neared the villa's entrance, he heard Isabella scream.

Alarmed, Michael hurried to the front gate, thinking Isabella was in trouble.

"What's the matter? Honey, what's going on?" Michael called out anxiously at the gate.

Upon reaching Isabella, he found her holding a phone and a bottle of drink, looking stunned, with no one else in sight. Clearly, there was no danger.

Michael's lips twitched as he approached.

"Honey, could you please not scream out of the blue? You nearly scared me to death. I thought something bad had happened to you," Michael chided.

Isabella, still fixated on the phone and drink, kept muttering to herself.

Frowning, Michael leaned in close, almost putting his ear to her mouth to catch her words.

"I won! I won! My luck has changed!" Isabella repeated excitedly.

Michael shook his head, grinning. "Sweetheart, what did you win? You look so thrilled. Let me guess, did you win a phone or a camera?"

Isabella turned to Michael, gazing blankly, and said, "No, darling, it's bigger than that. I think I won $100 million."

Michael blinked, the smile fading from his face. He grabbed Isabella's phone and saw the message confirming the $100 million win.

"You really won? How many bottles did you scan?" Michael asked urgently.

Isabella pointed to the box she had opened. "I was a bit thirsty, so I randomly picked a bottle from the box. After a few sips, I remembered the lottery and scanned the QR code. I never expected to win right away."

Upon hearing Isabella's winning story, Michael's lips twisted in disbelief.

'How could it be this easy to win? I know one of these drinks must have a winning ticket, but why did Isabella choose the first one and win? Did that fool Mike label all these drinks with prizes?' Michael pondered, glancing around.

Suddenly, Michael shuddered. If each of these drinks could win $100 million, even his entire fortune wouldn't be enough to cover the cost.

Quickly, Michael grabbed another bottle from the box and scanned it with his phone.

###chapter 484 Investing in a Movie

Michael picked up a bottle of drink and saw a message: [May the purchaser of this blessed drink live happily.] He checked a few more bottles; they all had similar blessing messages, meaning he hadn't won anything.

Michael felt a wave of relief. "Well, at least Mike didn't lose his mind and print a billion-dollar prize on every bottle."

"Wow, babe, we actually won! You're my lucky charm," Isabella shouted, jumping up and hugging Michael tightly, covering him with kisses.

Michael was caught off guard by Isabella's sudden affection and almost stumbled but quickly regained his balance, wrapping his arms around her.

Isabella's lipstick left marks all over Michael's face, but he didn't care. "Your luck must be rubbing off on me, honey," Michael said with a grin.

He wasn't joking. Scanning all those drinks with a phone would have taken forever.

Yet, Isabella managed to find the bottle with a hundred million-dollar prize effortlessly, a stroke of luck that was truly remarkable.

"Babe, I can't even put into words how I feel right now! Even though my net worth is now well over a hundred million dollars, I'm still super excited. Can you believe it?" Isabella was on the verge of tears, showering Michael's face with kisses.

After Isabella's kissing frenzy, Michael gently caressed her waist, smiling. "Of course, sweetheart, I never thought you'd actually win! Your luck is something else! But you're not mad at me for buying all those drinks, are you?"

Isabella playfully patted Michael's chest. "Who cares about the drinks now that we have a hundred million dollars? Tomorrow, I'll give them all to the employees at the company! I want to spread this good fortune around!"

Isabella quickly dismissed Michael's foolish purchase of all those drinks. Compared to the hundred million-dollar prize, they were insignificant.

Michael was thrilled for Isabella but reminded her, "Don't forget, babe, you said you'd invest this money in a movie."

Isabella nodded and hopped off Michael. "You're right, honey. I'm going to call Ms. Foster now and let her know I'm investing in her movie. I hope this lucky streak continues."

Isabella hurried into the villa, grabbed her phone, and dialed Estella's number.

Estella was on set filming when she received Isabella's call. "What's going on, Ms. Taylor? Is everything okay?" Estella asked, confused.

Excitedly, Isabella shared the news, "Ms. Foster, I've decided to invest in your movie."

Estella was puzzled. "Are you sure you want to invest in my movie? Doesn't your company need funds for development too?"

"No, no, no, Ms. Foster, this time it's not the company's money. It's my own!" Isabella exclaimed.

"Your money? Do you really have a hundred million dollars?" Estella asked, very curious.

Estella knew all about Isabella and Michael's relationship. She was aware that Isabella had recently taken over the Brown Family's business and hadn't fully cashed out yet. Michael couldn't just hand over that much money without blowing his cover. So, where did Isabella get the cash?

"Ms. Foster, you won't believe it, but I just hit the jackpot for a hundred million dollars," Isabella said, practically bouncing with joy. She explained how her husband had accidentally bought a ton of drinks, and she randomly picked one, winning the big prize.

Listening to Isabella's story, Estella smirked knowingly.

She was well-informed about the recent buzz surrounding the drink lottery event. Estella also knew Michael was the brains behind the drink company.

While outsiders or even Isabella might chalk it up to luck, Estella knew that Isabella's win was all thanks to Michael.

Initially, Estella wondered why Michael hadn't transferred the investment yet. However, since the previous hundred million dollars investment she made hadn't been used, she didn't push him.

Now, everything made sense to Estella. Michael had orchestrated Isabella's win to use the prize money for investing in a movie.

'Rich people have their unique ways of pleasing their spouses! I wish my future husband could be this thoughtful,' Estella thought, a bit envious.

"Wow, Ms. Taylor, your luck is truly something else! I'm genuinely thrilled for you. If only I had a fraction of your luck," Estella said, mixing shock and envy with her impeccable acting skills.

Isabella was delighted by Estella's reaction. "Ms. Foster, rest assured, once I have the money, I'll invest in your movie."

"Fantastic, Ms. Taylor, I'll eagerly await your good news," Estella said enthusiastically, relieved that the investment was secure.

After ending the call with Estella, Isabella decided to share her good fortune with more people, spreading her excitement.

"What? You hit the jackpot for a hundred million dollars?" Amelia exclaimed in disbelief.

Isabella nodded proudly. "Yes, you'll soon see me making headlines. I'm gearing up for a major announcement."

"Incredible, Isabella, we should throw a bash to celebrate," Amelia suggested.

"Absolutely, Amelia, I'll throw a lavish party and gather all our friends to celebrate together," Isabella agreed enthusiastically.

Seated nearby was Benjamin.

Upon overhearing their conversation, Benjamin sneered.

'Pulling off tricks to win over a wife! Let's see how you handle the fallout when your true identity is revealed,' Benjamin muttered under his breath, contemplating the predicament Michael would face once exposed.

After updating Amelia, Isabella also shared her jackpot news with Carol.

"What? You scored a hundred million dollars?" Carol was so stunned she nearly dropped her phone.

Isabella nodded proudly, declaring, "I'm hosting a press conference tomorrow to announce that I'm investing this money in Ms. Foster's movie."

###chapter 485 News

Isabella was over the moon as she shared her big win with all her friends. After spreading the news, she called the beverage company to confirm when the hundred million dollar reward would hit her account.

The folks at the beverage company, already tipped off by Michael, assured Isabella that the money could be transferred whenever she wanted.

"Hey, any chance someone from your company could swing by my press conference tomorrow and hand me the cash in front of everyone?" Isabella asked, a bit unsure.

The beverage company reps quickly agreed. "Sure thing, Ms. Taylor. We were actually planning a press conference to announce the winner, so you hosting it works out perfectly for us."

Their little joke brought a smile to Isabella's face.

"Great, I'll send a ride for you tomorrow then," Isabella said with a grin, eagerly anticipating the next day.

"Darling, we just hit the jackpot! Shouldn't we celebrate?" Isabella lounged on the bed, her hand inching towards Michael's waistband.

Michael intercepted her hand, jokingly saying, "Honey, you just got a billion dollars, don't make me lose another hundred million."

Confused at first, Isabella soon caught on to Michael's playful reference to sperm as the other hundred million.

Slightly annoyed, Isabella playfully tapped Michael's belly. "Experts say couples should get busy at least twice a week for a happy marriage, you know."

Rolling his eyes, Michael took Isabella's hand, looking somewhat defeated. "Babe, the manual says twice a week means two days, right? It doesn't say we need to have seven rounds in one night. I'm not a superhero! I'll be wiped out."

Michael finally let out his true feelings. He thought back to a time before the first industrial revolution, when steam engines didn't exist, and people relied on oxen for farming.

People guided the oxen, and the oxen pulled the plow to work the land.

No matter how hard the ox worked, the land stayed fertile after being plowed multiple times, but the ox could end up drained.

Feeling like that ox, Michael was on the brink of exhaustion.

"Alright, you win. I'll dial it back a bit. Goodnight, you troublemaker," Isabella teased with a mix of sarcasm and humor before switching off the lights.

"Who are you calling a troublemaker? For a man's honor, I challenge you to an intimacy duel. It's just intimacy, right? Let's go," Michael protested, nudging Isabella.

But Isabella stayed still until Michael tickled her side.

"Quit it, you pest," Isabella retaliated, tickling Michael back.

"Who's the troublemaker now? I'll prove my worth," Michael continued, escalating the tickle fight.

The couple playfully teased each other in bed, gradually undressing until their laughter turned into gasps, moans, and whispers.

After fulfilling their two-day quota of intimacy per week, Michael collapsed on the bed, unable to move.

The next day, Isabella planted a kiss on Michael's forehead, got dressed, and left the villa.

As Michael slowly woke up, the twinkle in his eyes had dimmed."A woman on a mission is a force to be reckoned with," Michael muttered, his lips quivering as he reached for his phone on the bedside table.

Feeling the need for some pharmaceutical assistance, Michael realized he might have to resort to medication again. Meanwhile, fueled by love, Isabella was in high spirits, her complexion rosier than ever.

At the office, Isabella ran into Carol. "How's the prep for the press conference coming along?" she asked.

Carol nodded. "The reps from the beverage company are here, and we're good to go. You seem to be in a great mood today; winning must have put a smile on your face."

"Not just because of the win," Isabella said, blinking mischievously and flashing a mysterious smile.

Carol arched an eyebrow, seeming to catch on.

"Ms. Taylor, maybe you should take it easy. Your man isn't Superman. If you don't want him burning out in a few years, you might want to dial it back a bit," Carol advised gently.

Isabella waved her hand impatiently. "I've got this, I know my hubby better than anyone. He's tough."

Isabella then phoned Estella, hoping she would join them at the press conference.

Meanwhile, the supposedly resilient Michael, with a little help from Mike, stepped out of the car.

Trying to hold back his laughter, Mike quipped, "Mr. Williams, you look beat. Need a wheelchair?"

After his jest, Mike quickly clamped his mouth shut, afraid he might burst out laughing.

Michael shot a glare at Mike. "You think I need a lesson from you? We haven't settled the beverage issue yet! I don't need your help; I can manage on my own."

With a disdainful snort, Michael brushed past Mike and slowly headed towards the nearby clinic, holding onto his waist.

As Michael walked away, he suddenly heard boisterous laughter behind him.

Michael's expression darkened; he didn't need to turn around to know it was Mike taunting him.

"That damn jerk, tonight I'll have ten women drain you!" Michael cursed under his breath.

Little did Mike realize that later that night, Michael would give him scorching retribution.

While Isabella geared up for the press conference, John was at a hotel hosting a renowned sci-fi movie director.

Seated at a table with Bianca, John faced the acclaimed director, Vincent.

Vincent grinned and remarked to John, "I've heard Mrs. Williams is quite captivating, and seeing her today confirms the rumors."

Bianca couldn't help but acknowledge Vincent's smooth talk. Despite knowing she was John's girlfriend, he referred to her as his wife, unintentionally boosting Bianca's status and earning her admiration.

"Vincent, your standing in the industry is truly commendable..." Bianca was about to continue praising Vincent when an assistant burst into the room.

Seeing the interruption, John asked impatiently, "What's the deal? Can't you see we're in the middle of something here?"

The assistant nervously responded, "Mr. Williams, you wanted me to keep an eye on Ms. Taylor, and it seems there's trouble brewing! She's also going to star in Ms. Foster's movie, and most importantly, she won a hundred million dollars!"

###chapter 486 One Hundred Million Dollars?

The three people in the private room were left speechless after hearing the subordinate's report.

Thinking they might have misheard, the subordinate repeated the news.

The room remained eerily quiet.

After a moment, Bianca couldn't wrap her head around it and asked the subordinate, "Are you for real? Isabella won a hundred million bucks?"

The subordinate nodded. "Yes, Ms. Taylor, a cool hundred million from that QR code thing on a drink."

Bianca shot a look at John, remembering he mentioned that Michael was the brains behind that drink company.

John drummed his fingers on the table, looking thoughtful. He mused, "Could my uncle have rigged this? Being the big boss, it'd be a cakewalk for him to ensure Isabella's win."

Vincent, the director, sitting nearby, peered at John and inquired, "I've heard about that lottery thing, but I'm not into fizzy drinks. Does your uncle have a thing with Isabella?"

John sighed softly. "It's not about my uncle cozying up to Isabella, but more about my grandpa. He must've pulled the strings."

John clammed up, clearly not keen on discussing this with an outsider.

Sensing John's discomfort, Bianca switched gears, saying, "My sister is gearing up for a movie shoot and surprisingly invested in Ms. Foster's film. Think it's a threat to us?"

Bianca was more worried about the movie, a task handed down by John.

Though John had Bianca play the investor, he mainly wanted to keep her occupied. The real deal was handled by others. Bianca just had to sign on the dotted line, but she wasn't about to lose to Isabella without a fight.

Vincent eyed Bianca curiously. "Is Ms. Foster's flick gonna be a hit?" he asked.

As Vincent posed the question, he was also puzzled. He knew Estella's ties; her hubby was John's uncle. If Estella needed investors, why didn't John step in instead of letting someone else take the reins?

John shook his head, a touch of scorn in his eyes. He scoffed, "I've seen Ms. Foster's script, and honestly, it's a snooze fest. More about side characters than the lead. And the plot? Trying to slap a jet engine on Earth to jet off? Ridiculous."

Vincent had a lightbulb moment after John's spiel. He grinned and asked, "Is the director Zachary? He's fresh out of film school and ran the script by me for feedback."

John gazed at Vincent with interest. "I'm not sure who's directing this movie, but you seem pretty familiar with Zachary?"

Vincent shrugged, a touch of disdain in his voice. "He's a bright, eager kid. Full of dreams and ideals, like many young guns entering the real world. But reality's a tough teacher. It'll show him how naive he is."

Bianca and John shared a knowing smile at Vincent's take on Zachary.

Vincent continued, "I've checked out the script too. Dropping two hundred million will barely keep it afloat. They can't even afford some semi-famous actors' paychecks."

Bianca chuckled, finding it all quite amusing. "Dull script, green director, and a cast of unknowns. Looks like Ms. Foster and my sister's film are in for a rough ride."

John raised his glass, clinking it with Vincent. "Plenty out there willing to learn the hard way. Isabella's probably one of them."

Vincent raised his glass, downing the last of his wine. He wiped his mouth, smiling. "Heard Isabella's now a big shot in the elite circle. Getting a bit too big for her britches. Maybe this will bring her down a peg."

Bianca's narrowed eyes spoke volumes. Even an outsider could tell she wasn't buying it. But that didn't stop her from dialing Isabella to chat and maybe throw a little shade.

They chatted about movie investments in the private room before seeing Vincent off.

John dialed Michael as Bianca stood by quietly.

After two rings, Michael picked up.

"Michael, about Isabella's win. You had a hand in it?" John probed.

Michael's voice crackled through the line. "No, Isabella struck gold all on her own. Luck was on her side, plain and simple."

Michael marveled at Isabella picking the winning bottle from the bunch.

John remained skeptical. "You sure you're not pulling my leg?"

Annoyed, Michael shot back, "You think I'd joke about this? Got nothing better to do? Isabella's not hurting for cash, so why would I hand her a billion? If that's all, I'm out. Got work to do."

With that, Michael hung up, making it clear he wasn't up for idle chitchat with John unless it was family business.

John scowled at the ended call. "Maybe my uncle's right. No reason for him to pull a stunt like this. Could be Isabella just got lucky and hit the jackpot."

John mumbled to himself, but Bianca couldn't shake the feeling that Michael's voice sounded familiar.

###chapter 487 Press Conference

While John, Bianca, and Vincent were chatting about movies over dinner in their private room, Isabella's company was in the middle of a press conference.

The press conference was held in the company's spacious publicity room. Important guests, like a rep from a beverage company, director Zachary, and Estella, were seated in the front row.

"Hey everyone! Welcome to our press conference. Feel free to ask us anything," Isabella said with a smile, holding the mic and addressing the journalists below.

A journalist stood up, mic in hand, and asked, "Ms. Taylor, we heard your company recently bought a bunch of equipment from all over. Are you starting a new production line? What kind of products are you planning to make?"

Isabella paused for a moment but then composed herself. She figured these journalists were probably brought in by Carol, with questions provided by her too. If the press conference only focused on her award and movie investments, it would be too boring and short.

She discreetly glanced at Carol, who subtly nodded, confirming her suspicion.

Isabella smiled at the journalist and nodded. "Yeah, we're working on something new. It's a cutting-edge technology that a lot of people will find useful."

"What is it exactly? Can you give us more details? People are dying to know," the journalist pressed.

But Isabella shook her head. "Sorry, folks, for certain reasons, we can't spill the beans on the product we're cooking up just yet. Once I spill the tea, I'll have folks coming at me from all angles. You all know I've got enemies, like my dear pregnant sister."

Isabella ended with a shrug, causing laughter to ripple through the audience. They were well aware of Bianca's playful jabs at Isabella, almost turning it into an online meme.

Undeterred, the journalist persisted, "Come on, Ms. Taylor, can't you give us a little hint? Just a tiny peek?"

Taken aback by the journalist's persistence, Isabella glanced at the intrigued faces below and suddenly grinned. "I can only say it's related to this." Isabella pointed to her head, lightly tapping it twice with her finger. This sparked a flurry of discussions among the audience.

"Ms. Taylor pointing to her head, does that mean the new product is brain-related?"

"Maybe it's a brain-computer interface, like uploading your mind into a game?"

"Nah, I bet it's a brain ailment medication."

"She pointed to her head, could it be a hair growth serum? Or even shampoo?"

"Come on, now! Ms. Taylor is a big shot, one of the top family heads. She wouldn't be peddling shampoo, would she?"

Carol, seated in the front row, overheard the chatter behind her and smirked. Isabella's cryptic response not only left the crowd hanging but also stoked their curiosity even more. What caught Carol off guard was that they had dismissed the correct answer.

As the chatter started to die down, Isabella flashed a smile and said, "Alright, since there are no more burning questions, let me spill the beans. Do you all remember that recent mega lottery game with a billion-dollar jackpot?"

Many heads in the audience nodded, familiar with the billion-dollar prize buzz.

Another journalist stood up, mic in hand, and asked, "Ms. Taylor, are you bringing up the lottery because your big reveal is tied to that jackpot?"

Isabella nodded, casually saying, "Yep, folks, hate to break it to you, but I hit the jackpot with that hundred million dollar prize. Just picked up a drink yesterday, and boom, there it was."

Isabella's tone was as casual as saying, "Stepped out, grabbed a bottle of water, took a swig, and voila, no more thirst."

A hundred million bucks! Money most people could only dream of earning in a lifetime!

The audience erupted in disbelief once more.

Many couldn't wrap their heads around Isabella actually winning a hundred million dollars.

Isabella raised the mic, slightly elevating her voice to address the clamor below, "I get it, you all find it hard to believe I scored a hundred million dollar jackpot. So, this time, I've brought along reps from the beverage company to vouch for me."

Isabella gestured, and a young woman in a sharp suit rose and made her way to the stage.

"Hey, everyone, I'm Calliope Bishop, the supervisor of Beverages Sparkling Group. I can confirm that Ms. Taylor entered her winning deets last night. She's the real deal, folks, a hundred million dollar winner right here."

As soon as Calliope finished, Isabella's winning details flashed on the screen behind her.

In a flash, another journalist stood up. "I heard the head of Beverages Sparkling Group used to be Isabella's old boss at her cosmetics company. Can you assure us the lottery was legitimate?"

The journalist's question cut sharp, hinting at possible shadiness in the lottery.

Isabella and Calliope were ready for such questions, keeping their cool.

Calliope took the mic and stated, "Our lottery was legit, fair, and transparent. Every winner's info is on our official site. Ms. Taylor's win was clean as a whistle, no funny business."

The journalist hesitated, then sat back down in frustration without asking further.

Isabella and her crew knew the drill with these folks. If an average Joe won, they'd marvel at their luck. But when a wealthy person hit the jackpot, doubts about fairness crept in.

After Calliope took her seat, Isabella continued, "On the winning front, I've got another bombshell to drop."

Isabella motioned to Zachary and Estella, and the duo strolled onto the stage.

"I'm planning to invest the entire hundred million dollar prize into Ms. Foster's upcoming flick," Isabella declared.

As soon as Isabella finished, another wave of uproar erupted.
