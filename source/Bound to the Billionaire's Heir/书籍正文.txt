Mia POV
"Happy birthday to me!" was the first thing I said when I heard my alarm go off next to my bed. Joy flooded my heart as well as my voice.

I would turn 20 today and truly become a woman, even though society considers 18 to be the legal age of puberty. My life has already changed significantly since this day.

"What is this?" As soon as I got out of bed and my nose was being attacked by the intriguing smell of food, I asked myself. The inviting aroma of food was calling my name.

"Hello daughter," my mother said as soon as I emerged from my room. She had already walked over to greet me with a lovely smile. 

"Happy birthday, my love!" my mother said with an amusing smile as I heard a lot of strange noises coming from the living room.

I attempted to peek through the window, but my mother quickly stopped me. Her expression revealed something foreign to me, but I simply returned her smile.

My mother said, "Go get dressed and get ready for that party; there is one out there for you." Her words alone made me giddy. I received a party hosted on my birthday, which made it extremely memorable for me. This is the first time since my birth that I have received a party invitation.  
-

"Thanks, Mom," I said, giving her a brief but incredibly warm embrace. My mother gave me a brief embrace, but as soon as he said her name-"Madam Lucy"-she turned away and left me behind.

Even though I had been set up for a party before, I was still filled with joy and went straight back to my room. However, I could not understand why a party had been planned for me at this age. Nevertheless, I was so happy that I ignored all of that and went straight to the bathroom to take a hot bath. 

I had already finished using the restroom when I went to my closet to choose a dress. However, I was unable to find anything appropriate for the event, so I was left with no choice except to choose a nightgown or go ask my sister-who also happens to be a party animal-for one.

When I went straight to my sister's room, I saw that she was completely naked.

She instantly reached out to the towel on the floor and covered up her already nude body, saying, "Hey, you were supposed to knock before coming in."
"Ohh, I apologize." I quickly closed my eyes with my hand to avoid seeing her nude appearance, which she didn't want me to see.
"What is it that you need?" As soon as I opened my eyes and saw a white towel wrapped around her chest, which extended all the way up to her knees, she asked me.
Grinning, I said to her, "A beautiful dress."
She yelled, "Today is your day and you have no dress," to me as I simply frowned slightly and stared at her. She was laughing hysterically.
What is funny, I questioned.
She laughed at me, saying, "You are funny," which just made me angry and made me regret asking her for a dress in the first place.
As soon as I told her, "Just take your dress; I am no longer interested," I left her room, giving her the same sad expression.

I saw my mother carrying a tray full of snacks as I made my way to my room, which was fairly far from my sister's room.

"Mom," I said as I drew nearer to her.
"Why are you not wearing a dress yet?" she inquired as I stood grinning and asked me a question.
I told her, "I do not have one that would fit," and she laughed, instantly making me feel really self-conscious.
-
My mother gave me a stern look and said, "Why didn't Andrew get one for you?" This gave me the confidence to speak with her more effectively at the time.
"Why are you bringing up Andrew matter again, mom?" I asked, a small frown already forming on my face.

Every time my mom brings up the Andrew matter, it just makes me feel so angry with her. My mom still despises my boyfriend, Andrew, so much that it makes me feel horrible about it. Despite this, I still love him and would love to marry him.

She said, "I am sorry," and asked if I could give her a moment. My mother approached with a glass cup that contained green liquid, and I stood there for a while. Upon giving it to me, my mother instantly extended her hand.

"For what purpose is this?" As soon as I took what she gave me with open arms, I inquired. I noticed that it was something unfamiliar when I peered inside the cup.
My mother said, "That herbal tea."
I questioned, "How does this affect me?"
My mother's words instantly opened my ears: "You would be out today with all the people touching you so you need to take this to prevent getting an infection and also, when you are done with this cup you can go get your dress in the guest room where Andrew is arranging things."

I immediately downed the so-called herbal tea, not caring that it tasted bitter; all I wanted was to meet Ethan.

As soon as I finished the whole glass and squinted my eyes a little bit, I couldn't just feel my body anymore but just collapsed down to the floor. My body was already not the same after the whole drink my mil gave to me.

" She's yours you can have her" I just could hear a little of my mom's voice but with still a blurred view already.

My body was active for eager sex and could feel someone already on me having sex with me but still couldn't leave up a clear view of who it is.




###chapter 2
Mia POV
"Why are you crying over a simple sexual encounter?" I immediately started to doubt my sister because of the way she expressed herself. She accepted it as a typical occurrence that occurs to women nearly every day.
I asked her right away, "What are you talking about, Amanda?" as she picked up the phone and gave me a sour look that was accentuated by a hiss. 


I turned to face my mother, but she did not show any overt signs of sympathy or even sadness. She just regarded me with this unassuming expression, as though nothing horrible had also occurred or the incident had been a typical, predetermined event.

Tears were streaming from my eyes as I called up to Mom. Even though I was in excruciating pain, my mother ignored my urgent calls for help.
"Mother!" I screamed as my vein became visible through my skin.
"What?" She shot me a quick, glaring glance while screeching at me. I glanced with surprise and contemplation at my mother and sister.

A knock on the sitting room door caught my attention while I was still staring at my mother and sister. I instantly wiped away tears to give it a dry appearance and added a phony smile.

I called out, "Come in," and a moment later a man entered the sitting room dressed in a black suit and exuded a sense of great wealth.

Immediately, the entire sitting room filled with the scent of the attractive man's dress. My sister and mother had already stood when he entered the room, but I got up as soon as he got closer to me.

"Hello ma'am," he said, giving my mother a simple handshake that she accepted with a broad smile on her face. I also had a fake smile applied to my face.

My suspicions about what was going on were sparked by my mother and sister's persistent smiles. 

"I came from Sir Joshua," he said, instantly bending slightly to acknowledge everyone present.
I instantly rolled up my eyes and said to myself, "He is just a maid," while continuing to look at him as though we still had an unresolved disagreement.

I did not find it problematic that my mom and sister left the sitting room with the guy right away, leaving me alone. I sat down on the cushion in silence, remembering what had happened to me, but this time my face was much dryer and I was reacting palely. As the pain intensified, though, I let out a loud cry and struck my arm and hand on the cushion.

"My life has significantly become more difficult than I had anticipated," I said to myself as tears streamed out of my eyes. Despite all my attempts, my heart had already been broken and had fallen to the ground. There was no way to put it back together.

As I heard foot steps approaching the sitting room from outside the sitting room , I immediately cleaned up my eyes as if nothing happened. It was my mom and sister that Walked in with laughter on there face.

" What the happiness for?" I asked them as they both sat on the cushion at almost same time . .
" It nothing" my mother exclaimed wearing an immediate frown at once 
" Mom," Amanda called out my mom name rudely. As my mom heard her name from Amanda she immediately looked at her and used her eye lashes to bath her up . " You have to tell ,Mia that she has no full right in this house again" As Amanda said those words in a rude manner , my head immediately sparked up with lot of anger already in me .
" What the meaning of that? And what are you both not telling me ?" I yelled as soon as my stood up girl looking at both my mom and sister at same time . As my heart already started hitting so fast than I expected.

My mom and sister just looked at each other with a surprise look. At first, I was a calm person who they use to play around like a little child in the family, but my reaction to them was like a strong attack to them both. There's looked at each other as if they communicate with there eyes .

" Calm down" my mom stood up after the long look to get daughter, Amanda.
" Calm down for what?" I spoke with lot of anger within my words , with also grinning my teeth together with annoyance .
" What we you both not telling me ? Mom!" I asked also screeching out my mother's name .
" No, one yells at madam Lucy" she immediately used a slap to shut me up , which also made me look at her in more anger and a more pale face .
" Sit down and listen" my mom said as tears came out of my eyes gradually.
" You are bethored already to Ethan Joshua " my mom words were immediately cut short with that of my little sister.
" One of the richest and influencer in the entire world" As my sister said this words tears came out uncontrollably , with my eyes turning pale red immediately.
" What are you both saying?" I asked with a much confused look.
" You heard us right , you are already married , so you just have to do few things, which are " my mom paused as soon as Amanda walked closer to her ." Break up with Andrew" .
" I can't do so mother" I immediately stood up to the words of my mother with anger in me ..
" First of all return all money you collected from who ever it is and have it in mind I can't marry who I don't love, if it isn't Andrew then it no one" my mom and sister just looked at me without any words.
" Excuse me" I pushed my mom away form her standing position and walked out with a strong hiss to her .
" She must be mad " I gave a pause to exist and turned around looking at my sister who made the statement to me .
" You are the mad person here, you foster child" I said and walked out of the two presence.
###chapter 3
Mia POV
" How can I be pregnant" as I looked into the strip in my hands with two red straight lines I just felt like giving up the ghost after seeing the result..

I immediately felt like unseeing what I have already seen already. I took in courage and flushed up the result in the toilet with out a single cry coming out of my eyes.

Pregnancy is actually a good thing that every one must be happy if despite on how they got it. And this time am literally sad about this situation, I got pregnant through take and this would affect my child as soon as he start his own life. I would never let my child to be a bastard so I must take the right turn .

" Mom, thanks to you am already pregnant" as soon as I approached the dinning table where my mom and my evil sister was talking about things that aren't reasonable to the world.
" Ohh, this calls for celebration" as my mom said this words I immediately felt like taking out her life and putting it into the waste bin. 


I wasn't expecting such reaction from my mom at that time , I thought she would literally break down at that point in which a responsible mother should fell but though it wasn't any surprise for me since she already sold me out to whom I have never seen note had with in my life only on the day he both my virginity.

" Am literally not surprised at all, since you already sold me out to just get yourself money and becoming famous" I ran off her presence after saying those words to her . I ran quickly into my room and gad a quick fresh up. 


Immediately I was done with picking up a dress and already set to leave the house for good. I picked up nothing except money to help me reach to my unknown destination.

" Where are you off too?" As I held on the door knob the question made me to give a quick gaze to who asked the question. I just gave a hiss and twisted the knob with Same character I gave earlier.
" Keep yourself and the grandchild safe" my mom said to me while I walked out without knowing her reaction to the statement. But I know that she would apply a smile to her words.

*******

I walked down to the empty street of America with my bag out on the right side if my body as I walked through the street leading to a bridge. I just walked like a sleeping zombie down to the street which was leading to one of the local Bridges that held the street and market place .

As soon as I reached up to the bridge I started crying so loud there with car horns hitting me up in my head but I ignored despite I was the one blocking the way of some car owners.

" Crazy, girl would you get out of there" one of the car owners screeched out to me but I still ignored the words while looking close to the water that seems as if it was already calling my name .

  I took a deep breathe in and said some words to myself " Andrew, I always love but u have to do this for both you and me just to protect myself and you" I looked to my tummy with tears" And this unborn child" I cried out to myself as I dropped my bag to the floor and took in under deep breathe within me and took a straight move.

" Hey stop" as soon as I held on to the bridge holding, a nice looking man with great body fragance held my hands and drew me closer to himself giving me a slap immediately.
" What wrong with you?" He exclaimed as if he was angry with me or we had a fight . As he scold me in the front of the crowd, I just cried like a new born baby . Tears rolled down from my eyes uncontrollably.
" Come with me?" He dragged me along side with himself as he pushed him self through the whole crowd which some just respected him from the look of it .

The young man did all the talking while I just cried unstop. The man drove me in his car with a young man who was the main driver.


" Why do you wanna kill yourself?" He asked not looking at me but his phone , with an airpod plugged in his eyes. I looked at him with still tears streaming down from my eyes but it was now calm than earlier .
" I just hate my life, myself and my family in total plus everyone" I said with a sobbing voice as the man just looked at me and gave a chuckle to my words as if it was a joke .
" Why saying such a thing?" From a chuckle it turned into laughter but I just ignored it and still sob a little bit as he gazed at me .


I felt my heart getting scattered. His face was a familiar one , his body fragance still was kind of familiar also but I still have trouble in recognizing where we met each other

As I gazed at the man, trying to place where I had seen him before, he suddenly stopped laughing and his expression turned serious. "Wait a minute," he said, his eyes narrowing as he looked at me. "I think I know you. You're Mia, aren't you?"

My eyes widened in surprise. "How do you know my name?" I asked, my voice shaking.

The man smiled. "We met at a party a few months ago. You were with your sister, and we talked for a bit. I'm Ethan, by the way."

I racked my brain, trying to remember the party he was talking about. And then, it hit me. The party where my sister and mother had tried to set me up with one of her friends. I had been so uncomfortable that I had ended up leaving early.

Ethan must have seen the recognition in my eyes because he nodded. "That's right. I remember you now. You were really upset that night, and I ended up walking you home."

I felt a wave of shame wash over me. I had been so caught up in my own problems that I hadn't even recognized the man who was at my own party.

Ethan expression softened. "Hey, it's okay. I'm not going to judge you. But you need to tell me what's going on
###chapter 4
Mia POV

As I held my newborn baby boy in my arms, I felt a sense of joy and relief wash over me. I had finally found peace and a new beginning after all the struggles I had faced.

"Hello, little one," I whispered, gazing into his tiny face. "You are so loved, and you will never have to go through what I went through."

I smiled, feeling grateful for this new ###chapter in my life. I was determined to be the best mother I could be and give my baby boy the happy and stable life he deserved.

As I looked at my baby boy, I felt a sense of hope and renewal. I knew that I would always be there to protect and support him, and that together, we would face whatever the future held.

I gently stroked his soft hair, feeling a sense of contentment wash over me. I had never felt so happy and at peace in my life. This little boy was my everything, and I was grateful for his presence in my life.

As I gazed into his tiny face, I felt a sense of wonder and awe. His small nose, his delicate eyelashes, his tiny fingers and toes... everything about him was perfect.

I felt a tear roll down my cheek as I thought about the journey that had brought me to this moment. The struggles, the heartache, the fear... it had all been worth it, because it had led me to this precious little boy.

I whispered his name, "Andrew", and he stirred in my arms, his eyes opening briefly before closing again. I smiled, feeling my heart overflow with love.

As I held him close, I knew that I would never let him go. I would always be here for him, to protect him, to support him, to love him with every fiber of my being.

And as I looked into his tiny face, I knew that he would always be my everything. My reason for living, my purpose, my joy.

In that moment, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that no matter what the future held, I would face it with courage and strength, because I had Andrew to live for.

"I'm so glad to see you're enjoying motherhood," Madam Lucy said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "But don't get too comfortable. The baby's father will be coming for him soon."

My eyes narrowed. "What do you know about it?"

Madam Lucy smiled, her eyes gleaming with malice. "Let's just say I have my ways. And when he finds out about the baby, he'll want to take him from you."

I felt a surge of anger and fear. "You're just trying to scare me, Madam Lucy. You've always been jealous of me."

Madam Lucy laughed. "Jealous of you? Ha! I'm the one who always comes out on top. And soon, I'll have the baby's father wrapped around my finger, just like I had your mother wrapped around my finger."

My eyes widened in shock. "You're the one who sold me out to my mother?"

Madam Lucy shrugged. "I did what I had to do to get ahead. And I'll do it again if it means getting what I want."

"You're a monster," I spat, my anger boiling over.

Madam Lucy smiled, her eyes glinting with malice. "And you're a foolish little girl who thinks she can outsmart me. But you'll never win, Mia. I'll always come out on top."

I felt a surge of determination. "I'll never let you have my child, Madam Lucy. I'll fight to the death to protect him."

Madam Lucy laughed. "We'll see about that. The baby's father will be here soon, and when he finds out about the baby, he'll want to take him from you. And I'll be the one to help him."

I knew I had to act fast. I couldn't let Madam Lucy get her hands on my child. I had to find a way to protect him, no matter what it took.

As I looked at Madam Lucy, I felt a wave of anger and betrayal wash over me. "You're the one who's responsible for all my suffering, aren't you?" I spat, my eyes blazing with accusation. "You're the one who sold me out to the one person who was supposed to love and protect me, my own...family."

My voice trailed off, but the implication was clear. Madam Lucy's smile faltered for a moment, and I saw a glimmer of guilt in her eyes. But it was quickly replaced by her usual composure.

"Don't be dramatic, Mia," she said, waving her hand dismissively. "You're just a pawn in a much larger game. And pawns are always sacrificed."

I felt a chill run down my spine at her words, but I knew I couldn't back down. I had to protect my child, no matter what it took.


I felt a lump form in my throat as I gazed at Madam Lucy, my eyes filling with tears. "How could you, Mother?" I whispered, my voice shaking with emotion. "How could you sell me out to my own family?"

Madam Lucy's expression turned cold and hard. "You were always a means to an end, Mia," she spat. "A way for me to get ahead. And now, you're just a obstacle in my way."

I felt a sob rack my body as I realized the truth. My own mother had never loved me, had never cared for me. I was just a pawn in her game of power and manipulation.

"You're not even human," I whispered, my eyes overflowing with tears. "You're a monster, just like you said."

Madam Lucy laughed, her eyes gleaming with malice. "And you're just a weak little girl who can't even protect herself, let alone her own child."

I felt a surge of anger and determination. I would not let her win. I would not let her take my child from me. I would fight to the death to protect him, no matter what it took.
###chapter 5
Mia POV

As soon as I arrived home with my baby after a long day ,I started breast feeding him since he hasn't gotten one since about 6 hours.

As soon as I was still with my baby Alexander and Madam Lucy who happens to be my mother at my side . The door bell quickly rang out my mother screeched the word " Come in " to the visitor.

Just as soon as the male figure walked in I discovered it was no one else but Ethan the guy who saved me earlier when I planned killing myself. With his presence I immediately stood up .

Ethan's eyes never left mine, his gaze burning with determination. "I'm not leaving without you, Mia. You and Alexander are my family, and I'll do whatever it takes to keep you safe."



Madam Lucy's eyes gleamed with a knowing look, a look that made my skin crawl. "Ah, Mia, dear, you're so confused. Let me explain something to you."

She took a deep breath, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Ethan is your husband, Mia. He's the father of that beautiful baby in your arms. And I'm the one who made it all happen."

My eyes narrowed, my mind racing with suspicion. "What do you mean, Mother? You didn't...you didn't manipulate me, did you?"

Madam Lucy's laughter was like a cold breeze on a winter night. "Manipulate you? Oh, Mia. I did what was best for you. I made sure you had the life you deserved, the life you couldn't have possibly achieved on your own."

I felt a surge of anger, my heart racing with resentment. "You're not my mother," I spat, my voice low and venomous. "You're just a manipulative, controlling...monster."

Madam Lucy's smile grew wider, her eyes gleaming with triumph. "Ah, Mia. You're finally starting to see the truth. And soon, you'll realize that I'm the only one who truly cares about you, the only one who can give you the life you deserve."

Madam Lucy's laughter grew louder, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "Oh, this is going to be fun.  His here to take over the same woman and child. It's like a soap opera."

I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare, unable to move or speak. My mind was reeling with confusion and fear. What was happening? Why is this man fighting over me and Alexander?

Ethan took a step closer, his eyes never leaving mine. "Mia, I know you're scared. But I promise you, I will always protect you and Alexander. We'll face whatever comes our way together, as a family."



Madam Lucy's laughter grew even louder, her eyes gleaming with malice. "Oh, this is going to be good. Let the games begin."

Ethan's eyes narrowed, his gaze fixed on Madam Lucy. "That's enough, Madam Lucy," he growled, his voice low and menacing. "You've manipulated Mia long enough. It's time for the truth to come out."

Madam Lucy's smile faltered for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure. "Ah, Ethan," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Always so quick to defend your precious Mia. But do you really know what's best for her?"

Ethan's jaw clenched, his fists tightening at his sides. "I know that you've been using Mia for your own gain, Madam Lucy. And I'm not going to let you do it anymore."

Madam Lucy's eyes flashed with anger, but she kept her tone sweet. "Oh, Ethan. You're so misguided. I'm only trying to help Mia reach her full potential. And as her mother, it's my duty to make sure she's taken care of."

I felt a surge of frustration, my mind racing with confusion. What was the truth? Who was telling the lies? And what did Madam Lucy really want from me?

"Ethan, stop," I said, my voice shaking with emotion. "Just stop. I can't take this anymore."

Ethan's gaze flickered to mine, his eyes softening with concern. "Mia, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. But we need to get to the bottom of this. We need to know what's going on."

I took a deep breath, my heart pounding in my chest. "I...I don't know what to believe. But I do know one thing. I don't want to be a part of this anymore. I want out."

Madam Lucy's smile grew wider, her eyes gleaming with triumph. "Ah, Mia. You're finally starting to see things my way."

Ethan's eyes never left mine, his gaze burning with intensity. "Mia, listen to me. I know you don't remember, but we had an arranged marriage, a union that was meant to bring our families together. And it did, for a time. We had a beautiful life, a beautiful son. But something went wrong, and you were taken from me."

Madam Lucy sneered, her voice dripping with venom. "Yes, an arranged marriage, one that I orchestrated myself. And it was perfect, until Ethan here got too clingy, too possessive. He couldn't handle the fact that Mia was destined for greater things, things that didn't involve him."

Ethan's face darkened with anger, his fists clenched at his sides. "You're lying, Madam Lucy. You manipulated Mia, used her for your own gain. And now, you're trying to take her away from me again."

Madam Lucy shrugged, her smile dripping with malice. "Perhaps. But one thing is certain, Ethan. You would get Mia in anytime you want to even if it must happen now.

###chapter 6
Mia POV
 
My life is just like a written story based on one particular aspect where the antagonist strikes more than the original protagonist. 
 
Me seeking peace was something I literally knew was much far away from where I was at that stage of my own miserable and damaged life.
 
I got sold out all because of some wish my family wanted and I wasn't interested in. My mother always wanted fame and popularity, and she could go the extra mile in doing anything for what she desperately desired.
 
 
My life is a tumultuous tale of pain and betrayal, my dreams and desires constantly thwarted by the selfish ambitions of those around me.
 
My mother's insatiable thirst for fame and popularity has become a heavy chain, weighing me down and suffocating my own aspirations. 
 
I'm now a shadow of my former self, my light dimmed by the cruel twists of fate.
 
My world is a dark and treacherous landscape, where the antagonist's cruel hand looms large, crushing my spirit and shattering my soul. The quest for peace and happiness seems an impossible feat, a distant dream that mocks me with its elusiveness. The scars of my past linger, a constant reminder of the pain and suffering I've endured.
 
In this bleak landscape, my heart remains a heavy burden, weighed down by the shackles of my mother's making. My passion and creativity have been reduced to smoldering embers, flickering weakly in the face of adversity. Yet, deep within me, a spark of resilience remains, a glimmer of hope that refuses to be extinguished.
 
My childhood memories are now a distant blur, a faded tapestry of joy and laughter, forever marred by the dark threads of my mother's ambition. The love and support I once knew have been replaced by a cold, calculating gaze, a constant reminder that I'm nothing more than a pawn in her game of fame.
 
My days blend together in a haze of despair, a never-ending cycle of pain and sorrow. My nights are filled with tears and anguish, my mind racing with thoughts of a life I once knew, a life I can never have. The city around me is a cold, unforgiving beast, its streets and alleys a constant reminder of my isolation and loneliness.
 
The people I once called friends have vanished; their faces faded from my memory like ghosts, which my family was among, and it caused me so much pain and regret deep within, plus giving me a wound that has no cure. The only constants in my life are the cameras and the spotlight, forever trained on me like a hawk, waiting for me to slip, to falter, to fail. The pressure is suffocating, a weight that presses upon my chest, making it hard to breathe, hard to think, hard to live.
 
In this prison of my mother's making, my soul is slowly withering away, a delicate flower crushed by the heel of ambition. My heart is a heavy burden, a weight that threatens to consume me at any moment. The tears I cry are tears of despair, tears of anger, tears of frustration. The tears I cry are tears of a life unlived, tears of a dream deferred, tears of a soul forever lost.
 
And yet, despite the darkness that surrounds me, despite the pain that threatens to consume me, I hold on to hope. A fragile thread of resilience remains, a glimmer of light in the darkness. It's a spark that refuses to be extinguished, a flame that flickers weakly but still burns bright. It's a reminder that no matter how dark the night, no matter how bleak the future, there's always a way out, always a way forward.
 
"Mia, darling," my mom walked in almost at the at the same time I packed up my bag with deep pain that she had caused to me. 
 
I looked to her side as she drew closer to me with a smile that I knew was what she planned on using to make my life more bad and miserable than it is already.
 
My heart always had the deep pain within itself as I saw those who brought me down into what I never planned on becoming in my life. 
 
Now, I'm a single mother who has to Carter for a little baby boy, who I just hustle to take care of even if two men come in dragging for the position of a father, which was like a nightmare, despite me knowing my life is just a living nightmare.
 
"What do you want?" I asked with a more harsh voice, not even looking in her own direction, despite me noticing her immediate closeness to me.
 
"Mia," I interrupted with my harsh words to her, which also made me look up to her at that point with a Stern and we'll take a take a serious look.
 
"Don't you ever call that name from that mouth of yours?" I gave a tune that made my mother look at me with grinning teeth that were totally visible to me.
 
My mother looked at me with no words from her. I bent back to arranging the dress and keeping it in a big travel-size bag. My mom kept on glancing at me with me not giving her any attention but concentrated on what I was doing. 
 
Soon, I was already done with what I was doing and cleared up my throat as I placed the bag standing up right on my bed.
 
"Mia, don't tell me you are traveling." My mom's voice had curiosity living in it as I just sucked my teeth loudly to her. 
 
 
The reactions I gave to my mom weren't exactly what she thought of, but I gave her a little shock, but deep within me it hurt. I had no respect for my mother, but I had to do what was right, and that was telling her the honest truth and taking my dear away and standing like a woman.
 
"When did you start to care?" I asked, giving her a push to move aside from the doorside, which I made my own way out, keeping her all alone with my baby in the room.
.
###chapter 7
Mia POV
 
With me looking out of my parents house window, it was already turning dark, with evening approaching gradually.
 
I looked up to the moon, which was about to come out in a few minutes. I closed my eyes, saying some words to myself, wishing for the moon to grant them to me.
 
Without me completing my wish, the loud and steamy cry of my child interrupted. I left my sitting area and walked into my room with. As my eyes caught with those of my sister, I quickly wore a frown walking up to my baby, which she held.
 
I dragged my baby from her with anger at seeing her. I gave a hiss to her immediately, claiming my child.
 
"What are you doing in here?" I questioned as I tried to calm my little baby down to reduce his crying and screeching.
 
"I heard him crying, so I came to check up on him." My sister faded a nice and beautiful voice to me, still behaving like one of the good children a parent had, while she was more than a devil angel.
 
Her life was like that of a snake. She's just filled with a lot of kids and negativity, which just makes me automatically hate her after discovering she's also part of my mother's evil intention.
 
"Thanks," I say, revealing a fake smile as I tried walking out. My sister held me with her words, which just made me turn around with so much revealing anger in both my words and her expression.
 
"Don't you ever call up that name again!" I yelled at her with pointing fingers as she just looked at me with less grief but a chuckle, which I just ignored.
 
"But he's the father of your baby." I looked at her with a lot of annoyance. 
 
Her words caused more pain to me, as I remember how I got raped on the day I was supposed to be happy. The day the one's I called family sold me out to someone I never liked all because of the wealth and riches they wanted for themselves, not them knowing the kind of pain they already placed me into. The kind of pain that could make me kill myself with in a blink.
 
"Hmmmm," I sniffed, giving my reaction to her not minding the sobbing baby I held tightly. "My baby doesn't have a father." As soon as I said, my sister revealed the laughter she hid within herself. 
 
"You must be joking," she laughed more to her own words as I just looked at her with no other words coming out of me.
 
"You have two choices in this house: either you live..." She couldn't finish her words before I added mine to it.
 
"Or you stay," I paused with a slight chuckle as tears dripped off my eyes slowly. "Isn't that what you want to say?" I asked, giving her another hiss as I walked out of the room singing baby songs for my little baby, who was still crying without me knowing his main reason.
 
 
*******
 
 
I stormed out of the room, my baby still crying in my arms so hard. But I still couldn't bear to stay in the same space as my sister plus mother.
 
Their words, piercing my soul like a dagger without them seeing fault in themselves but seeing the whole fault in me.
 
After a lot of thinking and making my baby to sleep, I walked into my room, my heart racing with anger and pain. I gently rocked my baby, trying to calm him down as I stared at the wall, my mind racing with thoughts of escape.
 
I couldn't take it anymore, living in this toxic environment, surrounded by people who only cared about themselves. My mother, my sister-they were all the same-manipulative and cruel. I thought about my father, how he had left us, abandoning me to this fate. I felt a surge of determination; I had to get out of here, for my baby's sake, for my own sake.
 
I began to pack my bags, my hands shaking with emotion. I stuffed clothes, diapers, and formula into a small suitcase, my mind racing with plans. I had to leave, but I had to do it secretly. I couldn't let them know; they would only try to stop me. I thought about the money I had saved, hidden away from prying eyes. It would be enough to get us started, to find a new life, a new home.
 
As I packed, my baby FINALLY woke up with his eyes piercing into mine. I gazed at him, my heart overflowing with love. I would do anything to protect him, to give him a better life, even if I was supposed to kill people to provide for him.
 
I finished packing, my suitcase bulging with our belongings. I took a deep breath, my heart pounding in my chest. It was time to leave, to start a new life.
 
I crept out of my room, my suitcase in hand, my baby sleeping again in his carrier. I made my way to the front door, my heart racing with excitement and fear. I opened the door, a burst of cool air hitting me like a slap in the face. I took a deep breath, the night air filling my lungs. I stepped out into the darkness, my suitcase rolling behind me.
 
The night was quiet, the only sound being the crickets chirping in the bushes. I walked quickly into the almost empty street, my heart pounding in my chest as if I went through a long race. I had to get as far away from the house as possible before they realized I was gone. I thought about my sister's words, her mocking laughter still echoing in my mind. I felt a surge of anger, but I pushed it aside, focusing on the task at hand.
 
As I walked, the darkness seemed to swallow me whole. I felt like I was disappearing, leaving behind the pain and the heartache. I thought about my baby, his small face scrunched up in sleep. I felt a surge of love, a sense of purpose. I was doing this for him, for us, for our future.
 
After what felt like hours, I saw a light in the distance. It was a small motel with a neon sign reading.
 
"Vacancy" 
 
in bold letters. I quickened my pace, my suitcase rolling behind me. I pushed open the door, a bell ringing out as I entered. The receptionist looked up, a bored expression on his face.
 
"Room for the night?" he asked, his voice calm and cool as I looked at him with a small smirk.
 
I nodded, my heart still racing. 
 
"Yes, please," I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. He handed me a key, his eyes flicking to my baby. 
 
As I tried making steps further, I turned back to the man. "How much for the night?" I questioned with a nervous feeling.
 
"20$" I felt a relief since I was able to afford that even for a month.
 
As I walked back, he said with his calm voice, "Cute kid," he said, a small smile playing on his lips. I smiled back, feeling a sense of gratitude. 
 
"Thanks," I replied, taking more steps further.
 
I made my way to the room, my suitcase rolling behind me. I unlocked the door, a sense of relief washing over me. I was safe; we were safe. I lay down on the bed, my baby still sleeping in his carrier. I closed my eyes, my heart still racing with excitement and fear. I knew I had made the right decision; I had to get out of there, for my baby's sake, for my own sake.
 
As I drifted off to sleep, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but I was ready. I was ready to face whatever came our way, as long as I had my baby by my side and had peace.
###chapter 8
Mia POV

As I moved into my new space, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me and my new world plus that of my son. 

I had finally escaped the toxic environment of my family's home and from the ones that hated me and played as if they loved me.

And at this point of my new life I was determined to make a new life for myself and my baby, who barely knows anything.

But as I lay there in the darkness of the hotel room, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched by someone since I left my parents house much earlier that evening.

I opened my eyes to find a figure standing in the shadows, a feminine figure which stood glancing at me while hiding in the shadows of my door, with the eyes fixed on me with an unnerving intensity. I was immediately shocked with seeing someone already In the room, with my baby beside me I dragged him closer to me with a surprise look to the female figure.

My heart raced with fear as I sat up, my hand instinctively already on my baby tightly. But as the figure stepped forward, I saw that it was a woman, her face kind and gentle.

" Seems like my plans didn't work" I Said to myself looking at her own direction as she drew closer .

"Who are you?" I asked, my voice barely a whisper to the person as I stood up from the bed.

" I'm Sarah," she replied, her voice soft and soothing as I adjusted back a little bit .

"I've been watching you for a while now, Mia. I know what you're going through." As she said those words my heart skipped with fragile fear.

" Who sent you? How did you get me?" I questioned with dear gripping so tight in me with much of a fragile look.

I felt a surge of fear and anxiety, wondering how this stranger knew my name and followed me to my hotel room. 

"What do you want from me?" I asked with a deep tune as my baby just yawn, my hand still wrapped protectively around my baby.

"I want to help you," Sarah replied, her eyes filled with compassion and pity to me but I just ignored.

" Excuse me" I said to her carrying my baby on very well.

"I know what it's like to be trapped in a situation like yours and still have to fight for your right and hope" I gave a glimpse on her with positive hope that maybe she was really ready to help me .

I walked closer to her as she continued her word" But I also know that there's a way out."

I felt a glimmer of hope, and I leaned forward, my heart pounding in my chest.

"Tell me," I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

And with that, Sarah began to speak, her words painting a picture of a world beyond my wildest dreams. A world where I was free, where I was safe, and where my baby and I could live without fear.

As I listened, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders, and I knew that I had found a true ally in Sarah. 

" So , how did you Know much about me ?" I asked her with sitting in a much comfortable manner this time around with feelings that were much positive.

" As I said earlier have been following you for a while now, so I know must things about you" I gave a gentle smile to her as we both chatted for some mean time before she then looked up to my baby side Making her to reach him up to him with a smile.

" Hello handsome" I smirked to both my baby and the lady who tried to grab him at that point. 

How my baby accepted the embrace from her made me believe she was real. My child was much like someone who doesn't let people carry him apart from myself and his grandma . But him accepting her with no double thinking just made me knew something was totally different about this woman and she has a positive sprit.

" What's is name?" She asked playing joyfully with my baby.

" Ohh," I paused " Alexander" I replied as I heard a loud grunt from my stomach at that point.

" Nice name" she said.

" Thanks," .

" How have you been with you caring for this baby all alone with no help from anyone?" She asked as I wore a frown with her asking the question at that point.

"I've been managing though," I replied, my voice laced with a hint of struggle and pain. "It's hasn't been easy, " I paused giving a relieve. "but I'm doing my best to provide for him."

Sarah nodded sympathetically with a gaze to me that has pity. 

"I can imagine the stress and how It's not easy being a single mother, especially when you're running from a dangerous situation. But you're doing great, Mia. You're strong and capable, and Alexander is lucky to have you as his mother."

I felt a warmth in my heart at her words, and I smiled slightly.

 "Thanks, Sarah. That means a lot coming from you." I smirked to her words since she already started giving me comfort when there wasn't any.

Sarah smiled back at me. "I mean it, Mia. And I want you to know that I'm here for you, both of you. " She placed her arms on my shoulder.

"I want to help you in any way I can, whether it's with Alexander or with getting back on your feet." She said.

I immediately felt hope within my inner self.

"Thank you, Sarah. " I smirked giving a little pause . "Your words means so much to me." I gave a calm voice.

As we hugged each other warmly.  I felt a sense of relief wash over me and hope. I knew that I had found a true friend in Sarah, someone who would be there for me and Alexander no matter what. And with her help, I knew that we would be able to face whatever came our way, together.
###chapter 9
Ethan POV
 
"Where is she?" As soon as I made my way into my father's room, where he lays with hard sickness,.
 
"What do you mean, father?" I questioned as I walked closer to him, sitting on the right side of him since he lay with weakness.
 
"Ethan," he breathed hard, calling up my name, which I just looked at him with a sigh of pity within me.
 
"Father," I gave a short response, looking at him with a deep feeling of pain within me since he has been in that condition for a few months with all medical attention going well like a huge breeze.
 
" Do you want me died?" His question cause a chill down my spine immediately. Why would he be asking such questions? " I gazed at him with a kind of care free look but still thinking it what I would come up with to tell him.
 
 
"No, Father, why would I?" I replied with another question attaching to it as I try to sound calm and reassuring, still glancing at him as he labors hard to give a well-sounding breath. 
 
My father's eyes reached into mine at that point, . I looked at him with both mixed feelings of both sadness and a little bit of frustration.
 
" Ethan." He called up my name with a cough as I looked at him quickly. "Please do anything you can to bring her back, because she has your first seed with her," my father concluded his word with a sigh.
 
 
I sighed to him with a deep breath, feeling a sense of sadness wash over me at that point. 
 
"Father, we've been over this. " I said before my father interrupted.
 
"We haven't, son!" He said.
 
"Dad, you just accept Mia is gone and she left us, and I need to move on with my life the same way you need to also move on," I said with a harsh voice to my father, who managed to try looking at me by sitting upright with my own support and that of the pillows.
 
But my father's gaze was just so deep at me, which made me look in another direction of the room.
 
"You don't understand, Ethan." He sniffled as I looked back in his direction.
 
"WWhat do you mean by I don't understand?" I questioned.
 
"She needs your help." He gave a reply with his calm voice.
 
I raised an eyebrow, giving a more carefree look this time around with a slient hiss.
 
"Father, you're not making any sense. You're sick, and you need to rest." I said to him, trying back to bed, rid him at point since his words were no longer sounding interesting to me.
 
But my father's grip on my arm tightened, still not letting me to bed rid him. I looked at him with me losing with no relief within me. 
 
 
"Listen to me, Ethan." He paused with another sniff.
 
"You must find her and the baby and protect them," my father said to me, adding to his own word.
 
I felt a surge of guilt and anxiety within my inner mind, reeling with the implications. My father's words stirred up some negative feelings, feelings I thought I had long thrown away into somewhere I couldn't find.
 
The whole memories of Mia's and what I did to her just keep on rolling through my own head at that point. I felt the pain and betrayal that she would be facing, and the threat just kept deep within me.
 
"Father, please," I said, my voice softening and much calmer this time as I held on my father's hands.
 
. "You're not well. You need to rest and recover. We can talk about this later." I said as I successfully laid him back on the bed with me standing up at that point just to walk out.
 
But my father's eyes flashed with a fierce determination, and his hand held on mine tight and not having any way to release mine, and this made me look at him.
 
"No, Ethan. There is no later. Time is running out. You must find her now, before it's too late." My father's words still just sounded good to me. Me getting someone who I just couldn't stay with, since I still felt the guilt within me.
 
I felt a shiver run down my spine as I gazed into his eyes, seeing the desperation and fear lurking in their depths. My mind raced with questions after questions, but I knew I had to tread carefully. My father's health was fragile, and I didn't want to push him too hard.
 
But I couldn't shake off the feeling that he was hiding something, that there was more to this story than he was letting on. I decided to probe further to see if I could uncover the truth.
 
"Father," I said, my voice soft and gentle.
 
"What do you mean by all this you have been telling me? What do you really want?"
 
My father's eyes closed, his chest rising and falling in slow, labored breaths. For a moment, I thought he had drifted off to sleep, but then his eyes snapped open, and he fixed me with a piercing gaze.
 
"I've seen myself in the land of the died if you didn't bring Mia back, " with his chest rising up and keeping me in deep fear he called up my name once more "Ethan," he whispered, his voice barely audible.
 
" Father's , what's going on?" I asked with fear and confusion not knowing what i should possibly do next at that time. My gear being racing so quickly at that point as if it wanted to pull out of it space.
 
" Do anything within you to bring that lady back with my grandchild" he still said with a voice that was much more lower than a whisper.
 
I felt a surge of confusion, my mind reeling with the implications. 
 
But before I could ask any more questions, my father's eyes closed, and his body went limp. I felt a surge of panic, my heart racing with fear.
 
"Father!" I shouted, shaking him gently. "Father, wake up!" My eyes immediately felt so wet .
 
But he didn't respond. I felt a cold dread creeping up my spine, a sense of foreboding that I couldn't shake off. I knew I had to find Mia, no matter what it took. My father's life depended on it.
 
" Father," I screeched out so loud which quickly invited the attention of the other workers within the apartment.
 
My eyes being so wet and already with maid's and guard around myself and my father who laid there like an ice fish.
 
" Hey, do what I want" this word caused a deep laughter which kept me surprise.
###chapter 10
Mia POV
 
" What are you doing?" With my wet body I approached Sarah who was busy with my baby .
 
  I approached her with my vein out already, how could she be rough with my baby to already spoil my phone at that time.
 
With me seeing my phone on the fall scattered already I felt so devasted with all of that. I gave a squat with pain within me as I picked up my phone turning it around with me hiding my inner tears since I was already an adult.
 
" Am literally sorry" I Interrupted Sarah words with anger and revealing veins on my neck . 
 
" Why are you so careless?" I questioned with steamy anger in my voice already .
 
I just gave a long hiss to her walking back into the bathroom where I walked out of from . I looked into my phone that was already half destroyed . But,it just didn't look as if it was a small baby that spoilt the phone but someone more matured and have more matured sense to do that.
 
" Oh My God " I looked at my phone feeling depressed already. 
 
Why it hurt me the most was that I did almost all my works on that same phone, so that was where I get money from to pay for the motel I stayed at.
 
 
**********
I felt a spike of frustration and despair as I gazed at my damaged phone, my mind racing with thoughts of how I was going to recover my important files and contacts which was much more important to me . 
 
I had relied on that phone for everything and it was much like everything to Me, from work to communication with my clients, and now it was all gone.
 
I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself down, knowing that lashing out at Sarah wouldn't solve anything but just get issue worst since she was much close to me already and she loved me and my child.
 
 I walked back into the room with a dried body already, my eyes fixed on her as she held my baby, a look of concern on her face.
 
"Kate, I'm so sorry," she said, her voice soft and apologetic as she walked closer to me with a nice looking face that really tells what she said was totally from her heart. 
 
" It not an issue " i faked my smile to her .
 
"I didn't mean to damage your phone though." She paused briefly, holding my baby more fame around her arms.
 
"IIt was an accident." She said again.
 
I sighed, feeling a mix of anger and sadness, but still I just gave a smile to the words since I couldn't do much about that.
 
"It's actually just not just the phone, Sarah." I restricted my fake smile at that point.
 
"It's all my work, my contacts, my everything. I rely on that phone for my livelihood," I said as I immediately wore a friend at that point.
 
Sarah's expression turned sympathetic. "I know, Kate. And I'll do whatever it takes to help you recover your files and contacts. But please, don't be too hard on me. I'm just trying to help with the baby." She gave a face filled with pity. "I promise, Kate," she pleaded.
 
I felt a pang of guilt, knowing that Sarah was only trying to assist me. I took a deep breath and tried to compose myself and return back to my face smile since I couldn't bring out one at that point of time.
 
"Okay," I said finally, my voice softer now with a deep smile.
 
"Let's just calm down and figure out what to do next." I said to her, sitting on a side of the bed.
 
Sarah nodded, relief written all over her face. "Okay, Kate. Let's do that." She said with her own smile, which I couldn't just give words to-either it was fake or real.
 
Together, we sat down and started brainstorming ways to recover my files and contacts. Sarah suggested using data recovery software, while I tried to remember if I had backed up my files anywhere else. As we worked together, I couldn't help but feel grateful for Sarah's help and support, despite her carelessness earlier.
 
As the hours passed, we managed to recover some of my files, but not all of them. I felt a sense of loss and disappointment, knowing that some of my important work was gone forever. But I also felt grateful for Sarah's help and support, and I knew that I couldn't have done it without her.
 
As the sun began to set, we finally took a break, exhausted but relieved that we had made some progress. I looked at Sarah, and our eyes met, a silent understanding passing between us. We knew that we still had a long way to go, but we were determined to face it together.
 
As I looked at my baby, who was sleeping peacefully in Sarah's arms, I felt a spike of love and gratitude. I knew that I couldn't have made it this far without Sarah's help, and I was grateful for her presence in my life.
 
As her phone gave a quick buzz, Sarah immediately stood up from our both sitting positions. "Sorry, I have to pick this call," she said, making her way outside of the room at that time with me still going through my laptop to recover some old lost files.
 
"How's she and the baby?" A question From the other side of the phone, she said to Sarah, who looked around like a spy or someone with guilt killing them.
 
"Doing well and first plan had already worked well," Sarah gave a little chuckle, still looking around like one checking if someone was after her life.
 
"Okay," I voice said from the other end.
 
"Sarah... Sarah..." I stood up, walking outside the room, to see Sarah, who was behaving much like someone who was doing something bad.
 
"Are you okay?" I questioned.
 
"Perfectly," she responded.
 
" Okay..." I smiled, holding up her hands, going back to the room.
 
"So, what do you wanna show me?" Sarah asked as we both sat down back on the bed.
 
"I would be going out to seek a job tomorrow, so can you help me stay with my child?" I asked her.
 
"Thank you, Sarah," I said finally, my voice sincere. "I don't know what I would have done without your help."
 
Sarah smiled, her eyes shining with tears. "You're welcome, Kate. That's what friends are for."
 
I smiled back at her, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that I still had a long way to go, but with Sarah by my side, I felt like I could face anything.
 
" Ohh," she sighed giving a relieve as if I held her tight.
 
"Sarah, what happened?" I asked with a slight chuckle.
 
Her eyes widened, and she tried to cover up her phone. "Nothing, I'm good."
 
###chapter 11
Mia POV
 
"Sarah," I called up with a well-dressed and attractive one. I called up her name so gently because she just laid down on the bed so calmly.
 
She raised up her head and sat more comfortable with a look that looked so dramatic while I adjusted my skirt with a smile looking up to her.
 
"How's my dress?" I asked myself with a cool and simple smile at that point in time.
 
"Where are you going to so dressed?" She asked gently, with her glancing at me from up till down as if my dress was literally just bad to her and wasn't fit to go out for a job interview.
 
"I think I told you." She stood up at that point as she drew closer to me.
 
"Told me what?" She questioned.
 
"Going for a business interview as a secretary," I smiled to her as she gave an immediate chuckle to me as if I wasn't that fit at all for the job.
 
I looked to her with no longer a smile and a slight frown, since her words sounded so discouraging to me.
 
*******
 
 
As Sarah pulled out her phone, I couldn't help but feel a strike of quick excitement and gratitude towards her, still looking closer at her. 
 
She had always been supportive of me since when we both knew, and her belief in me meant a lot, but sometimes she just behaved so badly, which made me curious.
 
"Sarah, why this kind of reaction?" I questioned.
 
Sarah smiled warmly and handed me her phone with the job listing open on the screen. "You're welcome, Kate. I know you'll crush this interview and get the job. You're perfect for it."
 
 
"What does this mean?" I asked strolling through the thick screen, which had a document that involved different working spaces. 
 
With me still gazing at the large sum of salary and other benefits there, my head was so washed with greed.
 
 
I held the phone with little sigh of greed and began to read through the job description, my excitement growing with each passing sentence. It was like the job was tailor-made for me, and I couldn't wait to apply and show them what I was capable of.
 
As I read, I sat down quickly on the bed as time passed by slowly. Soon,  Sarah sat down next to me on the bed, her eyes fixed on me with a supportive gaze, and her phone I held.
 
"So, what do you think?" She asked with a kind of tune that was breaking down slowly, and I just looked at her with a simple smile.
 
Are you going to apply?" She asked, her voice filled with encouragement and shyness. 
 
I nodded eagerly, my mind already racing with ideas and strategies for the interview.
 
"Definitely," I said, my voice filled with determination. 
 
"Why won't I accept such jobs, but..." I turned to her.
 
"But what?" She asked with a firm voice.
 
"What's the company name?" I asked.
 
"Elite," I looked at her with a facial squirt.
 
"That sounds familiar," I said with a gaze.
 
Sarah grinned with a deep look into my eyes. "It's a popular company, young lady," Sarah said.
 
"Okay, I think I would just cancel this one and apply for this since the benefits are definitely awesome," I exclaimed with a feel of relief.
 
"That's the spirit, Kate! I know you'll do great things." Sarah smirked at my words quickly as I also chuckled at her.
 
Soon my baby just distracted with his own words, making me look at him with a better smile.
 
With her support and encouragement, I felt a sense of confidence and determination that I hadn't felt in a long time. 
 
I knew that I was capable of achieving my dreams, and with Sarah by my side, I felt unstoppable.
 
Soon I prepared my own footstep to walk out of the hotel room. I walked into the girl with a deep breath within me. I was offered a form to fill for the job position I needed.
 
As I began to apply for the job, a young lady sat with me, offering her advice and support every step of the way. We bothspent the next few hours perfecting my resume and cover letter and practicing my interview skills until I felt like a pro.
 
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I hit the submit button and sent in my application. I let out a sigh of relief and turned to Sarah with a smile.
 
"Thanks for your help, young lady," I said, my voice filled with gratitude. The young lady smiled to me quickly as she stood up from the sitting position.
 
"I couldn't have done it without you." I said with another smile to her.
 
The young lady smiled back at me, her eyes shining with pride. "You're welcome, Miss. It just so easy when you have people there to guide you." I looked at her suspiciously.
 
"Okay," I dragged the words.
 
"Now getready for that interview!" She said with her own enticing smile.
 
And with that, we spent the rest of the time preparing for the interview, laughing and joking as we went over my skills and qualifications. I knew that with her by my side, I was ready for anything that came my way during the whole interview section.
 
"Whose Miss Kate?" A young man with a stunning look came out of the interview room.
 
"Me," I quickly stood up, giving a smirk to the man and the young lady who assisted me in almost everything.
 
I took a deep breath within me as I walked gently into the room. As I stepped into the room, the man was in a black dress and facing the back of the office. 
 
I took in my cloth gently and gave a slight cough to make sure I was really there.
 
"Good day, sir," I smiled to the man who just sat down there.
 
"Take your seat." I dragged back one of the chairs with a smile and sat down. As the man turned around, I was so filled with surprise within me that made me stand up.
 
"What a lovely surprise, Mia," my heart skipped with the word.
###chapter 12
Mia POV
 
"What the fuck is this?" I stood up with anger within me, just looking at the nan who looked at me without a sign of surprise within him.
 
No word from him at that point until Sarah walked in with my baby.
 
"Sir, this Sarah and her daughter." I dragged my baby away from her at that second.
 
"Sarah, what the meaning of all this?" I asked with an arrogant glance to her.
 
"We are United once more," the young man exclaimed with much excitement within him.
 
I looked at what was actually happening there in the office. It all looks like another bad kiss-ass novel, which was bad for me to be involved.
 
"Seems you both are crazy," I chuckled with me holding my baby much tighter. "Excuse me," I tried pushing my way through but got restricted by Sarah.
 
"I'm Ethan Joshua and we both met countless times," he smiled as he got closer to me.
 
I ignored him with a carefree look at that point.
 
"Can I please leave?" I asked with a calm voice.
 
"That's not a problem," Ethan smiled, giving a slight bow to me.
 
I approached the door to discover it was already jammed from behind, which made me turn back to look at my both rivals.
 
"What do you want, Ethan?" After much trial on pushing the door hard, I had no choice but to ask.
 
"You and the baby," I hissed as I spat to the floor.
 
"Over my dead body would I accept that rubbish?" I gave my words much like a remarkable word.
 
Ethan smiled,enjoying my frustration already. 
 
"Oh, Mia. You're so good looking. I like that about you."
 
I glared at him, my grip on my baby tightening with fear within myself. 
 
. "What do you want, Ethan? Spit it out." I asked.
 
"We want to be a family, since you already have my baby," Sarah chimed in, inti ethan words.
 
"I think this family and I should stay off," Sarah said.
 
"Take the keys," Ethan reached out to hand over a key to her.
 
My heart raced fast with my babies looking so fragile. 
 
"You expect me to believe that? After all you have to me?"
 
Ethan shrugged as Sarah walked out, keeping me with wet eyes.
 
"I made mistakes, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make it right." Ethan exclaimed.
 
. "Save it, Ethan. I'm not buying it."
 
The door behind me creaked open as I gazed, and it turned out to be a tall, imposing figure standing in the doorway. 
 
His appearance was good, looking like a white collar worker.
 
"Ah, perfect timing," Ethan said, a smile spreading across his face.
 
"Whose this?" I asked myself.
 
"Meet our lawyer, Kate. He'll explain everything."
 
My heart sank as the lawyer approached me, a nice look on his face. I knew I was in trouble already.
 
"Hey, take a few steps backwards," I commanded.
 
" Sorry!"
 
He brought out his black suitcase, placing it on the table.
 
"So, Mia," I interrupted.
 
"Go straight to the point," I commanded again.
 
" Okay"
 
"Your family," I just didn't give a chance for talking.
 
"What did they do?" I asked.
 
"Can you just shut up?" Ethan said with a camel voice.
 
"Spare me," I hissed.
 
The lawyer cleared his throat, just to get over the tension in the room.
 
"As I was saying, Mia, your family...well," he paused, "they're not exactly what you'd call conventional." His cleared his throat.
 
I raised an eyebrow, giving a nasty expression with a grip on my baby tightening. "What do you mean?"
 
The lawyer hesitated, glancing at Ethan before continuing, to which he smiled.
 
 
"They're... iinvolved in certain activities though.".
 
" Activities? What do you mean by that?" I asked questions after questions.
 
 
"Activities that could put you and your baby in danger." He responded.
 
"What do you mean?" I looked to Ethan.
 
"Why looking at me?" Ethan threw his face away.
 
"How do you expect me to believe that? " I chuckled slightly.
 
"I know my family isn't perfect, so you're just trying to scare me."
 
The lawyer sighed, pulling out a folder from his suitcase.
 
"I have proof, Mia. Proof that your family is involved in some very shady dealings with the Ethan family." I just didn't look shocked.
 
I rolled my eyes, but a small part of me was curious. What could my family possibly be involved in that would put me and my baby in possible danger?
 
"Show me," I said finally, my voice barely above a whisper with my inner self filled with thoughts.
 
The lawyer handed me the folder, and I opened it, my eyes scanning the contents. My heart sank as I saw the evidence, my mind racing quickly.
 
Ethan smiled, a carefree look on his face.
 
"You see, Mia," I interrupted.
 
 
"I have gotten enough, so I want to go," I protested.
 
"Do you know we're not the only ones with secrets? Our family has secrets too, secrets that could destroy everything you hold dear." Ethan smiled
 
My heart raced as I looked up at Ethan with fascination and my mind racing with questions. What did he want from me? And what did my family have to do with any of this he was actually talking about?
 
"Okay, what else do you have to say apart from gliberrish?".
 
"Our night was an arranged one; I was also on some drugs."
 
 
 
###chapter 13
Mia POV
 
With everything that has happened previously, I and my child had already been forced to move into the family main house, which I loved and hated at the at the same time.
 
"Hope you love here," Ethan smiled.
 
"Do you know I can arrest you for kidnapping?" I asked, looking around with anger and deep suspicion.
 
With a chuckle he exclaimed. "Kidnap of my wife.".
 
"Who's your wife?" 
 
You, of course.""As he tired of placing his hand on me, I removed it, holding my baby firmly.
 
"Don't take it because I followed you here, then I automatically become your wife.".
 
"We are married, or didn't you know?" He asked as I looked at him.
 
"What I know is, you raped me and gave me a child." 
 
"And it also made me to know a man," he interrupted my own words, which I raised my eyebrows up arrogantly.
 
 
Ethan smiled for a moment before he regained his composure and steeze, still gazing into my eyes. 
 
"Technically, we are married, Mia. Our families arranged "
 
I sniffed my nose, my grip on my baby tightening.
 
"That's not a real marriage, idiot."
 
. "Mia!" He said as soon as I let my baby walk himself
 
"The only point is, we're bound together, Mia. And I'll do whatever it takes to keep you and our child safe."
 
I laughed with a little bit a bitter tune.
 
"Safe? You call this safe? You've kidnapped us, Ethan. You're holding us prisoner in this house, which myself and Alexander don't want to stay in." I exclaimed with anger.
 
Ethan's eyes narrowed with a reaction I couldn't explain.
 
"I'm protecting you, Mia." He exclaimed gently.
 
I shook my head, my heart racing. "You're not protecting us, Ethan. You're trapping us. And I won't let you get away with it." 
 
I turned to leave with my child in my arms, but Ethan's voice stopped me.
 
"Mia, please don't be foolish. You can't just leave. You don't have anywhere to go." Ethan gave emotions to his words.
 
I turned back around, my eyes blazing with looking at Ethan.
 
"I'd rather be on the streets than trapped in this gilded cage with you." 
 
"You're not thinking clearly, Mia. You're emotional. You need me how I totally need you."
 
I chuckled again, the sound echoing off the walls. "Need you? I don't need anyone, especially not you."
 
"I hate trusting people since I already almost cost me my life."
 
Ethan's face darkened, his eyes flashing with anger. 
 
"You're being unreasonable, Mia. I'm trying to help you."
 
I took a step closer, my voice dropping to a whisper. 
 
"You're not helping me, Ethan. You're suffocating me. And I won't let you do it since you have done it once."
 
With that, I turned and walked away, leaving Ethan's smirking face behind. But I knew this was far from over.
 
As I stormed through the mansion, I could feel Ethan's eyes on me, watching me, waiting for me to make a mistake. But I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
 
"Wait," as myself and my baby made our way through, Ethan's voice drew me back.
 
"What else do you want from me? Haven't you caused enough already to my life?" I asked arrogantly.
 
"Please, can you come see my dad before he dies?" He pleaded.
 
" Why? He was the one who planned to keep me into this?" Anger filled me immediately.
 
"His dying,  and he said without seeing you he would just give up the ghost." His eyes were filled with pity already.
 
I hissed, giving him a quick glance as he just pleaded. Soon I accepted.
 
I walked beside Ethan with my baby, holding him tight in myarms, with my heart heavy with emotion. I couldn't believe I was doing this, visiting the man who had ruined my life. But something in Ethan's eyes, a genuine spirit, had made me relent.
 
As we entered the room, I saw him, frail and weak, his eyes sunken, his skin pale. He looked up at me, tears streaming down his face.
 
"Ethan," his words were like a whisper to me.
 
"Yes, father." 
 
"Who came in with you?" He questioned his son 
 
"Mom, whose that?" My little baby asked.
 
"I don't know," I replied.
 
"Mia,," Ethan replied.
 
"Good day sir." 
 
 
"Mia, my dear, I'm so sorry," he whispered, his voice cracking with emotion.
 
I felt a lump in my throat as he said the words, which immediately made my anger and resentment melting away. 
 
"I was wrong, so wrong, to force our marriage," he continued, his voice barely audible just like a whisper. "I see now that I was blinded by my own ambition, my own desires. But I want you to know, I love you, like a daughter. And I bless our child, our beautiful Alexander."
 
"How do you know my child name?" I asked the sick man.
 
"His my grandson, so I know about him," he smirked.
 
" Okay,"
 
"Please, Mia, I know how it hurts to be forced into something you don't want to do or have plans for, but please accept Ethan.".
 
"Please," Ethan added.
 
Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes as I looked at him, remembering what I passes through all because of him. I just looked at him for the first time. I saw the old man, frail and weak, not the monster I had imagined.
 
"Okay," I whispered, my voice barely audible.
 
And with that, I forgave him a little bit, plus I forgave Ethan; I forgave the past. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I was willing to try, for the sake of my child, for the sake of my own heart.
 
As we left the room, Ethan's arm around me, I just ignored him, my heart heavy with emotion and with what I just saw.
 
"Can I ask you something?" Ethan whispered.
 
"Go on" 
 
"Let's start anew," he whispered, my eyes looking up at him.
 
"What do you mean by that?" I chuckled.
 
"Like start our own family," I laughed.
 
"Is anything funny with what I said?" he questioned.
 
"Don't just take because I acted with so much pity there that I would just accept you like that." I took away his arms from my neck.
 
With Ethan's eyes shone with hope, with love, as he frowned slightly, his eyes brushing against me and my son.
 
###chapter 14
Mia's POV
 
"Hello sweetheart," Ethan walked into the room with cool words from him, which immediately made me look at him.
 
"Don't you dare call me that ever again in your life unless you feel like dying," my words sounded like theart, which Ethan pleaded to.
 
"I'm sorry," 
 
"Keep it to yourself," I commanded.
 
"B... But"" I interrupted.
 
"No, but here," "I'm just here so your poor Dad won't just die like one useless fool.".
 
"Sorry," he pleaded again, which made me sniff in,in a way that was nasty and arrogant.
 
He took a while before he could say any word while I sat on the bed looking at him.
 
"If you have nothing to say, please leave my room," I instructed.
 
" Ohh," 
 
"I came to ask if you would be free today, so we could go get some items for your personal use." 
 
"What about my son?" I questioned.
 
"One of the maids would take care of him," he responded as if he was gripped with fear already from all my words.
 
"Would think about it and get back to you," I smirked.
 
"So," I interrupted rudely, giving a sassy vibe.
 
"Leave," I pointed towards the door for him as he gave a slight how and walked out.
 
*******
 
 
 
I watched as Ethan walked out of the room, feeling a sense of satisfaction within his inner self.
 
But as I turned back to the bed, I heard a noise behind me.
 
I turned to see Alexander standing in the doorway, a smirk on his face.
 
 
"Alexander, what are you doing there?" I immediately stood up.
 
" Papa," 
 
"Oh, Jesus, what kind of child are you?" I walked towards him as soon as I asked the question.
 
I took him back to his spot while I thought of Ethan's request. I still thought about everything and called him up to give my answer.
 
"Ethan," I screeched out his name, still sitting on bed.
 
"Mia," he said, his eyes gleaming with amusement.
 
"I accept the whole thing." I forced a smile on him while he rejoiced happily, and my son ran to him.
 
"Hello, Alexander," Ethan held on to his little arms with me looking at the both.
 
"His a little bit fragile," I said.
 
" Okay,"
 
"Can you please leave the room while I dress up?" I commanded.
 
"That's not an issue," he walked out after his words.
 
*******
 
I rolled my eyes as I watched Ethan walk out of the room with a lot of visible excitement, with Alexander giggling in his arms.
 
"Okay, let's get this over with a dress," I said to myself as soon as I approached the closet.
 
I put on a simple flowered dress and sandals, not wanting to make a big deal out of our outing since I just needed something for myself, and all because I moved in.
 
As I walked out of the room with a smile on my face, I saw Ethan waiting for me in the hallway, Alexander still clinging to his arms and fully joyful.
 
"Ready?" he asked, his eyes sparkling with excitement and joy as if he already won me.
 
I nodded, trying to hide my skepticism and fake smile.
 
We made our way to the car, Ethan insisting on carrying Alexander the whole time since he hasn't gotten a time like that with him.
 
As we drove to the store, Alexander started getting restless, squirming in Ethan's arms and trying to get to me.
 
"Dada, dada!" he squealed, reaching out for me, which I happily smiled at.
 
I laughed, trying to take him from Ethan.
 
But Ethan held on tight, pretending to be a superhero, but I just hissed, giving a carefree look.
 
"No, no, no! I've got this, Mia!" he exclaimed, making Alexander giggle even more despite the little bit being already tired of him.
 
I rolled my eyes, shaking my head nastily.
 
"This is going to be a long day," I thought to myself, looking straight as the car moved.
 
As we arrived at the store, Ethan insisted on taking Alexander on a wild adventure through the aisles, which I just ignored all of because of how amazed I was with where I stepped into.
 
They raced through the store, Alexander squealing with delight, while I trailed behind them, trying to keep up with looking around with the whole beautiful items my eye caught.
 
At one point, Ethan even started doing a silly dance in the middle of the store, Alexander laughing so hard as if he was crying already. 
 
I couldn't help but laugh too, despite myself having a strong beef with him.
 
Maybe this outing wasn't going to be so bad after all.
 
But just as I was starting to relax, Ethan did something that made me want to kill him at that point and also led me to remember what he once did to me.
 
He started singing a ridiculous song, loud and off-key, with Alexander joining in.
 
I buried my face in my hands, filled with Shane since other people around started laughing.
 
"This is a nightmare," I thought to myself still with my head buried deep in my palm.
 
But as we left the store, Alexander exhausted but happy, I couldn't help but smile to my little baby.
 
Maybe, just maybe, this was the start of something special or just the main start of my own living nightmare.
 
And Ethan, despite his ridiculous antics, was growing on me, but still, myself and him hanging out was not cool.
 
Soon, we arrived at the huge mansion, where few security men and a nanny welcomed us in.
 
"Oh, sorry," one of the guys said as soon as he hit me with one of the bags from the car.
 
"Sorry, for yourself, you good for nothing fool," I got provoked already.
 
"Mia," Ethan said with a very polite voice.
 
"What is it?" I questioned harshly.
 
"Sorry, but you are quite too harsh on him." 
 
"What the fuck did you just say now?" with storming anger, I walked out straight into my room.
 
I take a breath of relief, looking to the mirror with a frown. Touching on my hit spot just hurt, as if I broke a bone.
 
"I hate that guy," my ex claimed, still feeling my small hurt.
 
As soon as I heard a knock on my room door, I proceeded walking to sit on the bed.
 
"Come in," Ethan walked in with my joyful child and a few bags.
 
"The rest would be brought later," he dropped them. As soon as he did, he just made a few steps with my child with him.
 
"Hey Ethan," I swallowed my anger and pride.
 
"Thanks for today," 
###chapter 15
Mia POV
 
"I can't just stay here all alone doing nothing," I exclaimed, looking through the mansion window.
 
I gave a lot of thought to what I could possibly do to get myself a job and not just sit at him doing absolutely nothing. 
 
I couldn't be asking whom I just don't like for money or for personal items.
 
With a lot of thought, I walked up straight and got dressed, calling up one of the maids to attend to my child since I would be gone for the mean time in search of a job.
 
"Morning, Mia," I drew myself back to notice Ethan well dressed in a suit.
 
"Morning," I cracked up my reply.
 
"Where are you off to?" He stood up, leaving his breakfast.
 
"Why are you asking?" I questioned.
 
"So, I would just tell one of the drivers to drop you off," he said politely.
 
"What your plan?" 
 
"What do you mean?" 
 
"Why are you so being good to me?" He interrupted.
 
"I am meant to be nice to you; you are my wife," I chuckled out loud.
 
"Don't take what happened earlier as an opportunity to call me that. You scum "I sucked my teeth.
 
"B... But" I glanced at him from you to down.
 
"Hey, you," I pointed to one of his personal guards.
 
"Ma'am," he came closer.
 
"Leave here," I instructed.
 
" B.." 
 
" Now,"
 
"Okay, ma'am," he smiled as he walked out.
 
 
"Mia, why are you acting like this?" He asked.
 
"Acting what way, Ethan?" I paused. "No, how do you expect me to behave?"
 
"I want you to act more polite like how you usually do when you were much younger." This made me laugh.
 
"I need a job," I asked rudely.
 
" What!" He screeched.
 
"What is what?" I asked.
 
"You should stay at him with Alexander and not go to work, Mia," he said.
 
"If I'm at home, would you give me every single thing I want?" 
 
"Once I could make you happy, and yes," he smirked.
 
"Your words aren't sure how you aren't sure if yourself," gave another hiss.
 
"But Mia," 
 
"I need the job," I still commanded harshly.
 
"But, I would have to ask the MD if there are any vacancies," I interrupted as he picked up his phone.
 
"You can't just fix me somewhere instead of calling up your MD," I asked.
 
 
*******
 
 
 
Ethan nodded, his expression serious about Stern.
 
"Okay, I'll call my MD and see if there are any openings available for you to fit in." 
 
"But you have to promise me one thing." He pleaded.
 
"What's that?" I asked, my eyes narrowing, just know the nonsense he would spit out.
 
"You have to promise me you'll be on your best behavior and not embarrass me in front of my colleagues and others there," he said, his eyes gleaming with amusement.
 
I rolled my eyes. "I'm not going to embarrass you, Ethan. I'm a grown woman, not a child."
 
"Wait, let me get what you are saying, right?" I gave a serious look.
 
"Are you trying to say I embrace you?" I chuckled.
 
"No, not all," he said.
 
"If you say so, then call the MD."
 
"Okay, okay. I'll call the MD now." He chuckled.
 
He pulled out his phone and dialed a number, speaking in a low tone. I could tell he was trying to impress me with his importance and his shifty voice, which sounded like a spoilt radio in my ears.
 
After a few minutes, he hung up and turned to me. "Okay, it's all set. The MD wants to see us in his office at 2 pm."
 
I nodded, my heart racing with excitement but not revealing it out. "Okay, let's go."
 
Soon we arrived at the office building with no words to each other despite all his efforts.
 
As I stepped down, a sleek and modern skyscraper was there, which was in the heart of the city. Ethan led me to the elevator, his hand on the small of my back.
 
I felt a shiver run down my spine at his touch, but I pushed it aside. I was here for a job, not to rekindle anything with Ethan.
 
"I'm here for a job and not romance." I got my hands out of his.
 
The elevator doors opened, and we stepped out into a luxurious reception area. A sleek-haired receptionist looked up from her desk and smiled, revealing her white tooth.
 
"Mr. Ethan, welcome. The MD is waiting for you." She smiled to her words.
 
Ethan nodded, leading me to a large office with a stunning view of the city.
 
The MD, a middle-aged man with a kind face, stood up from behind his desk to welcome myself and Ethan.
 
"Mia, welcome. I'm glad you could make it." He smiled, giving me a handshake, which I accepted.
 
I smiled, trying to hide my nervousness. "Thank you, sir. I'm glad to be here." I replied.
 
The MD smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. 
 
"Let's get down to business, shall we?"
 
"Wait a sec," I looked at Ethan, who stood at a corner. "Let's meet outside," I commanded as he smiled, walking away from the office.
 
"What again, Mia?" He asked.
 
"Do I need an interview to get the job?" I asked.
 
" Yes," 
 
"Aren't you the CEO of this company, and you can just give anyone the job without an interview?" I exclaimed.
 
"It doesn't work that way, and beside I'm not yet the CEO," I interrupted.
 
"Whose then the CEO?" I asked.
 
"My dad," he said.
 
"Hmmm," I reacted.
 
"So, did you undergo this process?" I questioned with a nicer tune.
 
"Yes, it's like a tradition." 
 
" Why?" 
 
"I don't know." 
 
With a nervous spirit and a breathe deep in and out."Excuse me," I pushed him aside. 
 
As I opened up the door, I smiled at the middle-aged man who was sitting already waiting for me.
 
"So, are you done discussing with your husband?" As soon as he asked, my innocent smile just fade away.
 
"Can this interview start?".
 
And with that, the interview began.
###chapter 16
Mia POV
 
"Hey Mia, there's good news." From outside the room, I heard the loud voice of Ethan approaching my room.
 
"I'm sorry," he quickly closed his eyes as he walked into the room without any notice.
 
"Are you okay?" I asked, picking up the towel to hide my nakedness.
 
"I said sorry," he pleaded.
 
"Why didn't you knock before you walked in?" I asked.
 
"You bitch," I said with a loud voice.
 
" Sorry," 
 
"Tell that to yourself." 
 
"Can I open my eyes now?" He asked.
 
"Yes," I gave a carefree look to him sitting on the bed.
 
"So, what is the good news?" I asked with a frown.
 
"You got the job," my frown immediately faded away into a smile.
 
After the whole happiness had gotten a deep way into me, I then remembered what happened earlier on, as I glared at Ethan, my eyes blazing with fake anger. 
 
"You're sorry? You're sorry?! You just barge in here without knocking; see me naked, and all you can say is sorry?!"
 
Ethan took a step back, his hands raised in a defensive gesture and his eye pocking into mine.
 
. "Mia, I don't understand."
 
"Understand?" I cut him off, my voice rising slowly.
 
"Understand what? That you have no respect for my privacy? That you can just do whatever you want, whenever you want?" I exclaimed, looking at him as if I wanted to beat him up.
 
Ethan's eyes dropped, and he mumbled with a cracking voice,
 
"I said I was sorry, Mia."
 
I sniffed. 
 
"Sorry? " I chuckled gently.
 
"That Sorry isn't enough. You need to do better than that." 
 
Ethan took another step back, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape route.
 
"Mia, please-"
 
"When do I start my new job?" I demanded, my anger momentarily forgotten in my excitement.
 
Ethan hesitated, his eyes flicking back to mine. "Uh, well-"
 
"Well what?" I pressed, my anger rising again and giving him the look he was scared of.
 
"When do I start? You said I got the job, so when do I start?" I asked rudely.
 
Ethan swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down as if a few drops of water hanged up there. 
 
"Mia, I-"
 
"Just tell me!" I shouted, my patience wearing thin, and my ears were active for that.
 
Ethan flinched, his eyes dropping again with him looking with fear.
 
"Next week," he muttered.
 
"I guess," he added.
 
"Next week?" I repeated, my voice incredulous.
 
"Next week?! "
 
"You're telling me I have to wait a whole week before I can start my new job?"
 
Ethan nodded, his eyes still fixed on the floor as if I were giving him a harsh theart already.
 
I threw up my hands in frustration already.
 
"Unbelievable. You're unbelievable."
 
Ethan took another step back, his eyes darting towards the door as if he was contemplating making a run for it or he was planning on how he would just do something bad.
 
I glared at him, my anger boiling over, but I still had a lot of excitement within myself. 
 
"You know what? Just get out. Get out of my room, get out of my sight. I can't even look at you right now."
 
Ethan nodded hastily and beat a hasty retreat, closing the door behind him with a soft click.
 
I seethed, my anger and frustration simmering just below the surface. How could he be so thoughtless? So careless? Didn't he know how much this job meant to me?
 
I paced back and forth across the room, my mind racing with thoughts of Ethan and his idiocy. How could I have married such a man?
 
Eventually, my anger began to dissipate, replaced by a sense of resignation of happiness. I sighed and collapsed onto the bed, my eyes fixed on the ceiling, thinking all about the job payment.
 
Why did I always have to be the one to compromise? To forgive? Why couldn't Ethan just be considerate for once?
 
I sighed again and closed my eyes, my mind drifting off into a restless sleep.
 
The rest of the day passed in a blur of happiness and excitement within myself, with Ethan avoiding me at all costs. I barely saw him at dinner, and when I did, he was quiet and subdued, his eyes fixed on his plate, as if he were a living dead.
 
I didn't bother trying to talk to him, knowing it would be a waste of time since he would just act like one scared being.
 
. Instead, I retreated to my room, my mind still seething with happiness and resentment.
 
As I lay in bed, my eyes fixed on the ceiling, I couldn't help but wonder what the future held for us. Would we ever be able to move past this? To find our way back to each other?
 
Or were we doomed to remain in this state of limbo and malice, forever trapped in a cycle of resentment?
 
 
" Knock..." The sound of the door interrupted my thinking already. I stood up at that point, looking through the door.
 
"Come in," I commanded.
 
"Mia," he said calmly.
 
"What do you want? I asked.
 
"The baby is to be with me tonight," he said with more boldness than earlier.
 
" What!" 
 
"Is it too hard to ask for?" he questioned.
 
"I haven't slept without him since he was born." 
 
"You can come stay at my room," his voice sounded as if his throat guy something stuck there.
 
" Never"
 
" Why?" 
 
"Why what?"
 
"But we both are married," I interrupted.
 
"Forced marriage. A marriage that none of us wanted, an arranged marriage," I exclaimed calmly.
 
"I understand you, but still we have to accept what date has for us," I laughed.
 
"What fate?" 
 
"Just understand we are married and not in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship," he said with much boldness.
 
"But we haven't tied the knot, so we aren't married," I lay on the bed.
 
"We are, Mia, and it mean time you accept this," she said with a little screech.
 
"Can we get over this already? I want to sleep," I said, yawning.
 
"By tomorrow you must resume unless you lost the job," he said with a hiss before leaving the room.
###chapter 17
Ethan POV
 
"Hello everyone," the day was as bright as the light set on the mountaintop.
 
It was a day to introduce my wife and new worker to everyone who was available in the conference room.
 
"She's Mia, and she's my new secretary." I smiled as Mia waved her hands to the other workers, giving them a smile.
 
"Mia, can you step forward and introduce yourself?" I said as she stepped forward.
 
"Do I actually need that?" Mia asked with a whisper.
 
"Yes," I whispered back to her, giving a smile to the whole crowd.
 
"I promise to kill you if I disgrace myself here," she hissed with a whisper as I looked at her, making the crowd know what was going on.
 
 
 
 
Mia rolled her eyes and cleared her throat, giving me her always usual evil look, which made me look to the other side with a smirk.
 
"Hello everyone, I'm Mia, the new secretary. Nice to meet you all."
 
The room erupted in a chorus of welcomes and greetings, including claps, and Mia smiled graciously, her eyes scanning the room.
 
Just then, a tall, dark-haired man strode into the room, his eyes fixed on Mia with a scowl. 
 
"Well, well, well. Look what we have here. The new secretary, I presume?" The man said to another worker who stood close to me.
 
Mia's eyes narrowed as she recognized the man from the company's website that she had already gone through.
 
"Darsh, I presume?"
 
Darsh smirked with evil within him.
 
"The one and only. And you are...?"
 
Mia's smile faltered for a moment before she regained her composure and steeze. 
 
"Mia, the new secretary. And you are... being rude and interrupting my introduction." She said with both rudeness and honesty.
 
The room fell silent, and my eyes darted between Mia and Darsh, with my smile frozen on my face.
 
Darsh snorted and also scoffed.
 
"Oh, I'm shaking in my boots. The new secretary thinks she can take on me?" She laughed like a bully.
 
Mia's eyes flashed with anger.
 
"I don't think, I know. And I'm not afraid of you, Darsh."
 
The tension in the room escalated, and I stepped forward, his hands raised in a placating gesture.
 
"Hey, hey, let's not start off on the wrong foot here. Darsh, why don't you come on in and join us?"
 
Darsh smirked.
 
"I don't think so, Ethan. I have better things to do than babysit your new secretary."
 
Mia's face reddened with anger with the word, and she took a step forward, her eyes blazing. "
 
How dare you! I'm not some fragile little thing that needs babysitting. I can handle myself; thank you very much." She said.
 
. "Oh, I'm sure you can. That's why you're working as a secretary and not in a real position of power." Mia grinned her teeth.
 
The room gasped, and my eyes widened in shock.
 
. "Darsh, that's enough!"
 
But Mia was beyond reason. She launched herself at Darsh, her fists flying, and the two of them crashed to the floor in a flurry of punches and kicks.
 
I rushed forward, trying to separate them, but they were too caught up in their fight. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they were pulled apart, panting and furious.
 
The room was silent, the only sound was the heavy breathing of the combatants.
 
My face was white with shock, my eyes fixed on Mia and Darsh as if I couldn't believe what had just happened.
 
Mia's eyes still blazed with anger, her chest heaving with exertion and anger. 
 
"I hate you," she spat at Darsh.
 
Darsh smirked, his eyes glinting with triumph.
 
"The feeling is mutual, sweetheart."
 
"And I would love us to have such fun next time."
 
And with that, the two of them stormed out of the room, leaving me to pick up the pieces.
 
After doing some things in the already scattered conference room, I walked out to see Mia sitting down on one of the benches there while panting like a dog already.
 
"Mia, what you did there was wrong?" She stood up, looking as if I was the one she had a fight with.
 
"I couldn't just stay there and let that idiot intimidate me, as if I were nobody," she groaned.
 
"But... " 
 
"But... What? Ehh?"" 
 
"In fact, you are nothing less than a coward," I glanced at her.
 
" What!"
 
"You call me your wife, and you stood there doing absolutely nothing," she accused me, giving me fewer words to say.
 
" But..." 
 
"But... What?" 
 
"Can you give me a chance to talk at least?" I said filled with anger already.
 
"What's your problem, Mia?" I asked her.
 
"Do you think you could just attack everyone like you usually do to me?" I poured out my heart to her.
 
"Excuse you." 
 
"Excuse yourself," 
 
"Mia, I know you hate me, but at least have some respect for others and note this is an enterprise and not a ring for boxers," I said to her while she just gave me a carefree look.
 
I looked at her with no words from neither of us at that point.
 
 
"Do you expect me to say I'm sorry?" She asked calmly.
 
"Not to me, but tell yourself," my words sounded so emotional.
 
"You just disgraced yourself plus me," I hissed.
 
"Please go home and wear a better dress," I exclaimed, walking away from her with pain within me.
 
She just made me laugh, stuck in the office. I know no one can tell me in front of me, but I know at my back I am the main topic for gossip.
 
"Sir, I'm sorry?" The young man approached me.
 
"After disgracing her," I stood looking at him.
 
"I don't know she's your wife." 
 
"Now you know," I walked away. 
###chapter 18
Mia POV
 
"Morning," as I approached the dining table to have my breakfast, my blurry vision spotted the young man who was fast on his meal.
 
"Mia," the young man called up to her name with a smile on his face.
 
Mia came closer to him and sat down, picking up her spoon, to start gee meal.
 
"Where's Alexander?" I looked at her with a smirk and a calm tone.
 
"In his room,"
 
"Hope he already had his breakfast already," Ethan asked.
 
"I think so," I smiled.
 
"Okay, so eat," he focused more on his food.
 
We both are for a while with no words, and as soon as we both were already done with the food, we approached the sitting room.
 
"You aren't going to work today?" I asked him, going through my phone.
 
"No, I'm staying home." 
 
"That great," I smiled looking at him.
 
"Can I ask you something?" He drew nearer as I just dropped my phone, looking into his eyes.
 
"Go on"
 
"Promise you won't get mad at me," he pleaded.
 
"I promise." I gave an unsure statement that came up with a stammer.
 
"Okay," he breathes in and out.
 
"Hmmmm," he just kept me in suspense with his reaction as I just gave another different look.
 
"Why don't you tell your family to come over or your sister so you can have quality time together, I mean all of us?" I hissed, picking up my phone.
 
"Where are my words harsh?" He pleaded.
 
Nope,"  I faked smiled, looking into his eyes as he gave a sigh of relief.
 
"Your words have helped me remember my past." 
 
"And thanks to you, I am going to remember how they betrayed me and sold me out to your family." I stood up with revealing anger.
 
"Sit down, Mia!" Ethan stood up with a commanding tune.
 
"Why should I do so?" I protested.
 
"Don't take my soft act as weakness," I laughed.
 
"Who asked you to be soft?" I grinned my teeth hard.
 
"My father" 
 
"Fuck that your father."
 
"How dare you Mia?" His anger became more visible than I have ever seen.
 
"How dare who?" I chuckled. "Your vegetable father caused my life to be like this." He stretched out his hand.
 
"Mia, do you think I wanted this for myself?" He also grinned.
 
"What do you mean?" 
 
"I was on drugs that night," he paused. "Sex herb tea that your mother gave to me."
 
"You must be mad." I hissed, trying to walk out, but he pulled me back.
 
"I won't love us to get into issues that would involve my father, so stay out," he warned.
 
"Do your worst?" I looked into his eyes with more and less pain.
 
He laughed at me and adjusted before walking away from me.
 
 
I stood there glancing and seething with anger and hurt deep down within me. How could Ethan be so cruel and heartless? How could he laugh at me like that without pity?
 
I tried to walk away again, but Ethan caught me by the arm.
 
"Mia, don't go," he said, his voice softening and calm.
 
I turned to him, my eyes blazing with anger and deep pain. 
 
"Let me go, Ethan," I spat with a vemon of anger.
 
"You're hurting me."
 
Ethan's grip on my arm tightened. 
 
"I'm not hurting you, Mia. I'm trying to explain something to you."
 
I tried to shake him off, but he held me fast.
 
"Explain what?" I demanded. 
 
"Explain how you and your father ruined my life? Explain how you put me here?"
 
Ethan's eyes dropped, and he looked away. 
 
. "I didn't mean to hurt you, Mia," he said.
 
"I was weak, and I made a mistake."
 
I laughed, a harsh, bitter sound.
 
"A mistake?" I repeated. "You call ruining my life a mistake? You call putting me into months of pain a mistake?"
 
Ethan's eyes flashed back to mine, and he pulled me closer. 
 
"I know I hurt you, Mia," he said. 
 
"But I love you. " He stammered, "And I want to make it right."
 
I struggled against him, but he held me fast with almost everything within him.
 
"You don't love me," I spat. "You don't even know what love is. You evil soul" 
 
Ethan's face reddened, and he pulled me closer, nearing his chest.
 
"I do love you, Mia," he said. "And I'm going to prove it to you even if it takes everything I have."
 
And with that, he kissed me, his lips hard and demanding. I struggled against him, but he held me fast, his arms wrapped around me like a vice, with me still fighting for myself that he held tight.
 
I felt a surge of anger and hurt, and I bit his lip hard just to free myself. Ethan yelped in pain, and his grip on me loosened. I took advantage of the momentary distraction to push him away, hard.
 
Ethan stumbled back, his eyes wide with shock and pain. I stood there, my chest heaving with anger, and racing fast as if a race were held there. .
 
"Don't ever touch me again," I spat. "Don't ever come near me again or lay your hands on me."
 
And with that, I turned and walked away, leaving Ethan standing there, alone and defeated.
 
I walked out of the house, into the bright sunlight, and took a deep breath. I felt a sense of freedom wash over me, a sense of release and new hope.
 
I knew that I had made the right decision, that I had finally taken control of my life.
 
I walked to the nearest bus station and bought a ticket to the city. 
 
I had no idea what I would do when I got there, but I knew I needed to get away from Ethan and his family at that point in time.
 
As the bus drove away from the suburbs and into the city, I felt a sense of excitement mixed with fear and anxiety.
 
I was finally doing something for myself, something that would change my life forever and give me a new name.
 
I got off the bus at the city center and looked around, behaving like one who arrived newly there.
 
The streets were bustling with people of different kinds, and the skyscrapers towered above me. I felt small and insignificant, but in a good way.
 
I walked to the nearest cafe and sat down at a table. I ordered a coffee and pulled out my phone. I had no idea what I was going to do next, but I knew I needed to start fresh.
 
 
 
As I sat there with a quick sigh, sipping my coffee slowly and feeling the sun on my face, I still gave thought to what Ethan said to me.
 
Although I was finally taking control of my life, and I was never going to let anyone hurt me again.
###chapter 19
Mia POV
 
"Why did you do that?" As soon as I walked into my room, the familiar voice called me up, which made me look in the direction.
 
"I'm not ready for any romance with a guy." I walked comfortably to the bed area.
 
"So, you are a lesbian." I looked at him, giving a weird look.
 
"It would be better to be a lesbian than open my body to you once more." I sat down, pulling my shoes.
 
"So, the question is, why did you bite me?" He asked again.
 
"You just got a little of what I planned for you." I stood up, walking to the door.
 
I twisted the door knob, opening it up.
 
"Please leave," I commanded.
 
"I own this house," he said, still sitting.
 
"And so what?" I questioned.
 
"I know what room to enter and not enter," I chuckled.
 
"Then I would leave this whole house for you," I said, walking back to where my things were packed.
 
" Alexander," 
 
"Leave my child alone, you pervert," he revealed a smirk to him as I glanced at him.
 
"Our child, you mean," still looking at him; my child got on my already.
 
"Mia, I think it might time you accept what the world has for you."
 
"You must be crazy with those words of yours." I walked to him.
 
As I stretched my hands toward my baby, he just rejected it.
 
"What have you done to him?" I asked.
 
"It just love," he smiled.
 
"What kind of love?" I stood at a particular spot, glancing at the both.
 
"Mia, I know it would be hard, but just accept what the world has set in place for you; accept the fate of life," he said to me as he stood up, leaving the room with my arms around his neck.
 
I just hissed and went back to pack up all my things. I packed my own personal things in the room with that of my child into one troller bag.
 
As I walked into the sitting room, I gazed at both my son and him, who was having a blissful moment.
 
"His already used to him," I whispered to myself, looking before I made a step forward.
 
I took a deep breath in and walked closer to the man with my child holding my bag beside me.
 
"What's that?" He asked as he chuckled.
 
"I'm leaving your house for good since you said you are the main owner of the house," I said as I tried to drag my baby out his hand.
 
"I was just joking and don't take it to heart." 
 
I laughed at his words, still trying to hold my baby in my arms. 
 
"What do you mean?" 
 
"It was a joke," he said.
 
"An expensive one," I replied as I successfully grabbed my baby.
 
"Don't take all this to your heart," he tried, saying calm words as I picked up my bag again.
 
"It was nice having some time with you in this house," I smiled as he held my hands backward.
 
"Can you leave me?" I requested.
 
"I love you, Mia." As I turned back to free myself, I saw the man already on the floor with his both knees.
 
"What are you doing?" I questioned arrogantly.
 
"I'm begging you to please give me chances to prove to you that I am worthy to be the father of your baby and husband." His words made me go give laughter immediately.
 
"Just stop making a fool of yourself." I gave him a sign to tell him his maids were looking at him, but still he just stayed there.
 
"Sorry, it's late already," I smiled.
 
"I can't change my mind towards you," I sniffed in with a deep breath with it.
 
"Please leave me," I dragged my arms away from his.
 
"Please just give me only ten chances to prove my love towards you," he said as I turned back once more.
 
"Stop fooling yourself," I pushed him aside.
 
"Please, don't just leave me," he pleaded.
 
"Okay, shut the fuck up already," I shout.
 
" Kelvin!" As he stood up, he called up the name with me looking.
 
"Why is the door closed?" I tried twisting the doorknob hard, but still it just couldn't open the door.
 
"I begged you." 
 
"That didn't answer my question," I reacted as a young man came out.
 
"Oh, sorry, it jammed," he chuckled slowly.
 
"Then open it," I commanded, looking at the young man.
 
"Me," he pointed to himself.
 
"Get her bag," Ethan gave a Stern look this time.
 
"If you date come closer to me, I promise to break one of your legs." I gave my own more harsh and Stern look.
 
"Who pays your salary?" Ethan asked the confused young man.
 
"You sir," the man said with a stammer.
 
"Then get her bag and the baby." As he approached me, I dragged his ear with anger.
 
"Seems like you hate your life and you wish to die," he held my hands, shouting for his life.
 
"Please ma'am!" He pleaded.
 
"Next time get a better bodyguard and not a weak one like you." I pushed him aside, leaving him to feel the last pain.
 
 
 
 
"Get her bag and the baby, Kelvin!" Ethan repeated, his voice firm and commanding as the man looked so confused already.
 
The young man hesitated with confusion, looking at me with fear in his eyes. 
 
I took advantage of his hesitation and made a move for the door, but Ethan was too quick. He grabbed me from behind, his arms wrapping around me like a vice or tight rope.
 
"Let me go, now!" I struggled and kicked, but he held me tight with everything within him.
 
"You're not going anywhere," he whispered in my ear.
 
"You're going to stay here and be a family with me and our child." He added.
 
I felt a surge of anger, and I quickly knew I had to think fast. I reached up and grabbed his hair, pulling it hard. He yelped in pain and loosened his grip on me, and I took advantage of the momentary distraction to break free.
 
I ran to the door, but it was too late. Ethan had already called for backup, and the room was filling with his security guards already.
 
"You're not going anywhere," he said, his eyes filled with triumph.
 
###chapter 20
Mia POV
 
I sat in the sitting room couch with eyes fixed on me as if I were one big-time criminal caught in his action.
 
My heart bit fast gazing at Ethan plus the security guard that surrounded us both. My eyes filled with fear and my heart filled with thoughts of how I could just escape from the room.
 
With anxiety, deep breath, and a sigh, I sat much closer to the chair edge.
 
"What do you want now?" I questioned the tiung man, who couldn't just let his eyes off me.
 
"I just want peace and nothing more." I relaxed my back and laughed.
 
"What kind of peace?" 
 
"The one you know," Ethan replied as the guard started leaving one after the other.
 
As I was about to say my words, the buzz from Ethan's phone interrupted.
 
"Whose that?" 
 
He looked at me, still his eyes on the phone.
 
"Madam Lucy," my mood changed with the mention of that name.
 
 
My eyes narrowed so wide already with my mind racing with thoughts of what Madam Lucy wanted.
 
"Answer it," I said, my voice firm and fragile.
 
Ethan's eyes never left mine as he answered the call with his own firm look and voice.
 
"Hello ma'am."
 
I could hear her voice on the other end, but couldn't make out what she was saying to Ethan. 
 
Ethan's expression changed from calm to concerned, his eyes darting back and forth as he still placed the phone in his ear area.
 
"What? When?" he asked, his voice rising and giving me little fear.
 
My heart began to race at that moment, my mind filling with worst-case scenarios that have negativity filled within them. What was my mother saying to him?
 
Ethan's eyes locked onto mine, his gaze piercing and stabbing.
 
"I'll handle it, ma'am," he said, his voice cold and which made me have a lot of curiosity.
 
The call ended, and Ethan's eyes never left mine, and his way made me to be engaged in fear.
 
"It seems your mother has been causing trouble again," he said, his voice dripping with anger and arrogance.
 
My heart skipped all because of his words, which also put thinking in my head. 
 
"What had my mother done this time? "What did she do?" I asked myself.
 
Ethan's smile was sinister and calm, like a warm water.
 
"She's been spreading rumors about our marriage, about our child. She's trying to ruin our reputation." His words just made me to be provoked.
 
 
"We need to take care of this, Mia. We can't let your mother ruin everything we've worked for."
 
"What did you say?" I questioned the young man with an arrogant look.
 
"Just let focus on your mother's word."
 
"What do you mean by take care of this"? I questioned.
 
As I opened my mouth to speak another word, Ethan's phone buzzed again, making me stop speaking.
 
. "I need to take this,. Mia," he said, his voice cold.
 
He stood up, his eyes stuck into mine. 
 
"We'll continue this conversation later, Mia. But for now, I need to handle this situation." As soon as he was done with his call, he had to confess.
 
And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving me alone in the sitting room with curiosity, my heart racing with fear and my mind filling with questions after questions.
 
What was happening? What was Ethan planning to do? And what did my mom have to do with any of it?
 
As I sat there, my mind reeling with a lot thoughts, I heard the sound of footsteps outside the room. The door opened, and a figure stepped inside, which made me look in the direction.
 
My heart skipped a beat as I saw who it was. Andrew, my ex-boyfriend. What was he doing here?
 
"Mia," he said, his voice low. "We need to talk now,"" my heart began to race fast.
 
My eyes narrowed, my mind filling with suspicion. What did he want? And how did he even get past Ethan's security?
 
But before I could ask any questions, Andrew's eyes locked onto mine, with me gazing at his.
 
"Your mother is in trouble, Mia. And we need to help her."
 
My heart raced, my mind filling with less fear already.
 
What has my mother done now? And how were we going to get her out of this mess that she stuck herself into?
 
As I opened my mouth to speak again, Andrew interrupted. 
 
"We need to act fast, Mia. Before it's too late."
 
And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving me alone in the sitting room, my heart racing with fear and my mind filling with questions and queries.
 
What was happening? What was going on already? And how were we going to get out of this mess that had already happened?
 
As I sat there with my mind racing with thoughts, I heard the sound of footsteps outside the room. The door opened, and Ethan stepped inside with his usual smirk.
 
 
"Mia, we need to talk now."
 
My heart skipped a beat with Ethan's request to me.
 
"What did he want again from me?"I asked myself.
 
"And what did he have to do with my mother's troubles that he was giving a lot of concern to?"
 
But before I could say anything, Ethan's eyes seemed to bore into my soul.
 
"We need to take care of your mother, Mia." He paused.
 
"Once and for all."
 
After his few words, he turned back and walked away once more, leaving me alone in the sitting room, my heart racing with thoughts and my mind filling with questions that have no answers.
 
 
"What does Ethan Mean?".
 
"And what did he plan to do with her?" I rained questions on myself.
 
"Why do I even care about the one who destroyed my life?" I asked myself, grinning my teeth.
 
As I sat there, my head filled with thoughts, I realized that it seems like I am in deep danger already and clearly on the way out.
 
And I had no idea how to get out of this mess that had already happened in the family.
 
" Or is this a gave that I would play another pawn in "
###chapter 21
Mia POV
 
Ethan,"  I knocked on his room door with a deep breath and a gentle sigh.
 
"Come in," I walked into the room.
 
He sat down there with his laptop on his lap, stucking his eyes into it.
 
"How you doing?" I approached sitting down on his bed along side with him.
 
"Not bad, neither good," he exclaimed, still not looking at me.
 
"Any news about my mother?" I asked gently.
 
" What!" He gave me a surprised look.
 
"For real, you are asking about her," he dropped his laptop, looking at me with anxiety.
 
"She's my mother, even though she hates me," I said, giving a carefree look.
 
Ethan sighed in gently and held on to my arms gently, with we both piercing our eyes into each other.
 
"Ethan," he used his finger to hold my words.
 
"Mia,you are funny." 
 
"What do you mean?" I asked.
 
"Never mind." I gave a little hiss to his words.
 
I still looked at him for a bit, biting my lips gently in a romantic manner.
 
"Mia, what are you doing?" Ethan tried to step back, but I held his arms gently with my smile.
 
"Nothing." I licked up my upper lip, sucking it smoothly.
 
I dragged him closer, sticking my lips into his with my eyes closed gently.
 
"Mia," he dragged his lips out after a long kissing race.
 
"Ethan, what happened?" he looked towards the door area, which made me turn around.
 
"Ohh," I smirked, going away from his bed, approaching the door.
 
"Alexander, whats up?" I carried him up with a smirk.
 
"Dada dada," he said, stretching his hands towards Ethan.
 
"His addicted already," I said, turning to Ethan's direction.
 
"I'm business now," Ethan groaned, walking up to the baby that stretched up his arms.
 
"Take him as your child," I could see the huge surprise on his face already with my words to him.
 
"What did you just say?" He asked as he held his child with a surprise-filled face.
 
"HiHis your child," I smiled.
 
"Wonderful," he gave a crazy laughter.
 
"So, I would go to the sitting room and watch some movies," I kicked the air.
 
"Why acting so weird?" I went closer to him, giving him a perk as Alexander closed his eyes a little bit.
 
"I love you, Ethan," I whispered to his ears after the short kiss.
 
"You just made me blush," he reacted.
 
I laughed a bit.
 
As I walked out with a smirk, his words held me to look back.
 
"Am I coming with you?" He smiled 
 
With a smile on my face, I held on his arms like a newlywed couple.
 
As we both settled into the sitting room with smiles to each other.
 
Alexander toddling around his father's body and exploring his surroundings, I heard a knock at the door. 
 
 
Ethan called up the maid to answer it, and I could hear the sound of murmured voices in the hallway, which got my quick attention.
 
Suddenly, with my eyes stuck with that if my playing son, Ethan's voice rose in surprise, and he exclaimed, 
 
"What are you doing here?"
 
I turned to see who it was, and my heart sank quickly as I saw my mother standing in the doorway with her evil smirk, a smug look on her face.
 
"Mia, darling," she said, her voice dripping with sweetness that I know was original fake. 
 
"I hope I'm not interrupting anything important here." She made a few steps forward.
 
I felt a surge of anxiety as I stood up, my heart racing with anticipation and sharp chill in my spine.
 
"What is she doing here? And what did she want?" I questioned myself quickly, noticing she was already coming closer to me.
 
"Ethan, what's going on?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper as my heart raced sharply.
 
Ethan's face was set in a firm expression that has less confidence within it.
 
"Your mother has some news to share with us, Mia," he said, his voice tight with tension and surprise.
 
My mother smiled gently, her eyes gleaming with triumph and excitement.
 
"Yes, my darling." I reacted, making her to pause for that time.
 
"I have some wonderful and great news. I've been thinking a lot about our family, and I've decided to make amends and turn back the hands of the clock," I chuckled awkwardly.
 
 
I raised an eyebrow, skeptical with a little squint in my nose area. 
 
"Amends?" 
 
My mother nodded with her smile.
 
"Yes, dear Mia. I know I haven't always been the best mother to you, but I want to make it up to you now. I want to be a part of your life, the life of your husband, and Alexander's life."
 
I felt a wave of disbelief wash over me and discomfort.
 
My mother, wanting to be a part of our lives? After everything she had done to me already, after destroying my life and making me love the wrong one.
 
Ethan's hand on my arm brought me back to reality and snapped me out of my thinking board.
 
"Mia darling, let's at least hear her out," he said, his voice soft with encouragement and an honest look.
 
I nodded, my heart racing with questions. 
 
"What did she want this time? And what did she have to offer?" I asked myself, giving a fake smirk as I dragged my baby into my arms.
 
As we sat down, my mother began to speak, her words dripping with sincerity and regret.
 
But I couldn't shake the feeling that she had an ulterior motive, that she wanted something from me this time.
 
And as we listened to her proposal and fake words, I couldn't help but wonder what she was really after this time.
 
But what caught me was she didn't show up with her little girl, whom she showed more live bad affection for.
 
"How's Alexander doing?" Ethan gave me a little tap.
 
"What are you thinking about?" Ethan asked.
 
"Nothing," I stood up.
 
"Please excuse me.".
 
 
 
###chapter 22
Ethan POV
 
The sudden changes that are occurring in the mansion are too much for us to handle at this point.
 
I loved Mia and had always never shown that kind of feeling for me, but suddenly she showed the feeling that I could say is strange.
 
"Ethan," I held my father's arms with emotions filling my heart.
 
"Father," my response wasn't sure since fear had a larger part in me at that point in time.
 
"How's your relationship going?" I smirked at him with my face down. I just don't want to reveal my anxiety to the old man.
 
"I could say it is not going as planned, but still good and a little complicated." 
 
"What do you mean?" From my dad's look, you would know he needed answers.
 
"Today she's like a warrior; tomorrow she's like warm water." 
 
" Wow" 
 
"But when she planned on packing out, I caught her." My dad interrupted my words quickly.
 
"I hope you didn't injure her." 
 
"N... O" 
 
"How's my grandson?" My dad coughed out a little bit.
 
"I'm doing well, but I'm kind of tired of his addiction to me," I left my dad's hands.
 
"His meant to be addicted to you, son," my father laughed gently.
 
"Was I like that when I was little?" I asked curiously.
 
"Not exactly since you don't see me every time," I laughed.
 
"You were just addicted to your mother, and your mother also got addicted to you."
 
" Wow"
 
"But,, you know, after her death, you became addicted to me more than your mother." I wore a quick frown at just hearing my mother's name.
 
My mother was more like a mentor, coach, and partner to me; she gave me hope in everything I did as a young boy.
 
But when her report came up saying she had cancer, I knew that my life had already been scattered and fully destroyed at that point.
 
But nevertheless, my father gave me more hope and helped me with everything I needed.
 
"Hello," I  snapped out of my thinking pad, looking at the door entrance.
 
"Sorry, am I interrupting anything?" She asked as I smiled at her.
 
"Not really, but just a father-son time," I said, standing up for the young lady to sit comfortably.
 
"Great," she smiled before sitting.
 
"How are you doing?" She held on to my dad's arms with a mild smile.
 
"I'm responding to drugs, though."
 
"He just reminds me of my father," she said, looking at me with a smile and a little snift.
 
" Okay" 
 
"How's Alexander?" My father forced his words out.
 
"Hi, okay," she replied before I could.
 
"Should I bring him in?" I asked.
 
"That would be bad," Mia replied.
 
" Why?" 
 
"He's getting stubborn already, and that's something I never expected from him," my father said, causing a loud laugh in the air.
 
"So, you were stubborn?" Mia asked with laughter, to which I just gave a frown. 
 
Soon, Mia went out of the room after asking for permission to do so. Myself and my father just chat as if he weren't even sick at all.
 
With a long chat and distraction from the door, I heard the familiar voice calling up my name, which got my attention.
 
"Dad," Alexander learned a new word and gave me a quick smirk at that point, standing up to go embrace him excitedly.
 
"It was just like his father when he was still a kid."
 
 
I scooped up Alexander in my arms with a smirk, twirling him around as he giggled with glee.
 
"Dada!" he exclaimed again with excitement within himself, his little hands grasping my face at that point.
 
My father chuckled, a warm smile on his face that also made me happy. On my outer side, I was literally happy, but within me, it wasn't all because of my father's poor health condition.
 
"He's just like you when you were a kid, Ethan."
 
" Dad!" I groaned at looking at my father, who revealed a short laugh.
 
I grinned this time with an awkward smile. Feeling a sense of pride and joy was my outer part.
 
"I guess he takes after his old man," I said, with a carefree look, also playfully ruffling Alexander's hair, which made him smile.
 
Mia returned with a smile on her face, her eyes shining with warmth and a calm spirit.
 
"Sorry to interrupt the bonding session though, but I have something important to discuss," she said, her voice gentle, warm, and sweet.
 
My father's expression turned serious and strenuous; his eyes locked onto Mia's.
 
"What is it, Mia?" I asked.
 
Mia hesitated, her gaze flicking at me, before returning to my fathers. 
 
"It's about your health, sir. The doctor's reports aren't looking good." She gave a Stern look.
 
My heart sank with fear, a cold dread creeping up my spine.
 
"What do you mean?" I asked, my voice firm and filled with fear already.
 
Mia's eyes filled with empathy and pity.
 
"The cancer has progressed, Ethan. We need to act fast if we want to save your father." Her words caused a rage or fear within me at that point. My head ached at that stage.
 
My world has already crashed down around me. No, this couldn't be happening to me at this time. I can't lose my father already. My father, the rock of our family, couldn't be dying at this stage.
 
But before I could process this devastating and heartbreaking news, Alexander's voice pierced the air again, giving an interruption.
 
"Dada!"
 
I turned to him, my heart heavy with emotion and fear. 
 
"Yes, buddy?"
 
Alexander's eyes sparkled with excitement and joy. 
 
"Dada, I want to show you something!" His words weren't completely good, but I could still understand them.
 
I forced a smile at that time, my mind racing with questions after questions.
 
What could Alexander possibly want to show me at that time? .
 
As I followed Alexander out of the room with a fake smile, I couldn't shake off the feeling about my dad's health condition.
 
###chapter 23
Mia POV
 
"Oh, I'm wet already." With me touching my lower thigh and sucking my lower lips, I could feel that I was in for eager sex.
 
I just had to control my feelings at that time, but still, I needed something to go through my legs, since it's been more than she's gotten pleasure from.
 
I looked at my room to see my son playing joyfully with his toys.
 
" Alexander..." I grabbed his attention with my words.
 
"Mom," he said, looking at me.
 
Alex, darling," I said as I came down from the bed, walking towards him and his playing toys.
 
"What if you get your own room?" I asked him with a smile.
 
" Good!" He reacted joyfully but was still interested in his toys.
 
"Okay," I said, holding on to his arms quickly.
 
"How do you want your room to look?" I questioned him, squatting and looking into his eyes.
 
"Good!" he repeated.
 
"I would just arrange your room in my own way," I groaned, standing up quickly.
 
I went to my bed quickly, picking up my phone from the bed, going through my contacts, and dialing the number of Ethan.
 
"Wassup, darling!" he said from the other end of the cell phone.
 
" Cool!" I smiled without looking at him.
 
"Any problem?"
 
"Can I ask you for something?" I questioned.
 
"Yes""Go on" 
 
"Can we set up a room for Alexander, like a different one?" I asked curiously.
 
"That's no issue."
 
" Yes!" I said, looking at the little boy who played with his superhero figure.
 
"But can we see you in the sitting room in the next 5 minutes?" Ethan requested.
 
"That's not a problem," the caller cut off, not minding what the one at the other end wanted to say to me.
 
**********
 
As soon as I figured out the time myself and Ethan planned on.
 
I quickly made my way to the sitting room, where Ethan sat down, already waiting for me.
 
---
 
We both sat in our dimly lit living room, surrounded by stacks of documents and files.
 
Ethan sat across from my own sitting position, his eyes scanning the pages with a mix of concern and suspicion.
 
I couldn't believe what we were uncovering already. It looked like Mr. Joshua, who happens to be my father-in-law was literally faking his illness.
 
"Ethan, I just can't believe this," I whispered, slowly looking with surprise, my eyes fixed on the papers in front of me.
 
"It looks like your dad is trying to manipulate everyone into thinking he's on his deathbed." I picked up the paper slowly, still glancing at it.
 
Ethan's eyes narrowed, looking into mine.
 
"I know. It's like he's trying to pull the wool over our eyes and do something." Ethan was still giving his Stern look.
 
I felt a surge of anger and betrayal within me. 
 
"How could Mr. Joshua possibly do this to us with him knowing we are family?" I asked within myself, still glancing through the pages.
 
"But why would he?" I asked, my mind racing with possibilities and thoughts.
 
"What could he possibly gain from this?" I still threw questions at myself.
 
Ethan shook his head with disappointment.
 
. "I don't know, but we need to get to the bottom of this thing." Ethan wasn't just relaxed and comfortable.
 
We spent hours pouring over the documents and large file, searching for any evidence that could prove our theory and our own thoughts.
 
But the more we read through, the more confusing and hard it became. It was like trying to unravel a tangled web, but the spiders just get plenty.
 
Just when we were about to give up on the research, Ethan pointed to a paragraph in one of the files that caught my attention.
 
"Look at this, Mia. It says here that my father has been making large withdrawals from his bank account." I just felt like ignoring those words, but still.
 
My eyes scanned the page, my heart racing with excitement and anxiety. 
 
 
"That's totally strange. What could he be using that money for despite his laying on the sick bed?"
 
Ethan's eyes locked onto mine with visible thought.
 
"I think I know. I think he's paying someone to pretend to be his doctor." I chuckled slightly at the word.
 
My eyes widened in shock with a little chuckle. 
 
"That's a huge accusation, Ethan. Are you sure your father can do that?" I was already curious.
 
"I'm positive. We need to investigate further and know what's going on?."
 
We spent the next few hours digging deeper, following a trail of clues that led us to a locked room in the mansion. 
 
"Ethan," I turned to him, biting my lower lips.
 
" What?" He questioned, still giving his serious expression.
 
"I'm horny," he said, narrowing his eyes as if he were really surprised by my words.
 
"We are in the middle of something, and you need sex," he questioned slowly.
 
I dragged his shirt closer to him after we both locked ourselves in the room we were supposed to be busy with.
 
I pushed him to the bed and sat on him.
 
"Mia, are you sure about this?" 
 
"I have never been more sure than this."
 
I went down gently on him, sticking my lips into his, which made us both engage in a deep kiss at that moment.
 
I continued kissing him while I felt his arm's moving all around my waist area romantically and lovely.
 
"Do you suck, dick?" After getting out of him, he asked, as his rod was already hard and big.
 
"Giving it a try can't hurt," I smiled as I knelt down slowly.
 
I placed my arms on his dick, pulling off his trousers and underwear. 
 
I placed my mouth gently into it, going in and out for a while. I suckled his dick for as long as he moaned and pushed me deeper.
 
Soon, I found myself on the bed with his rod already in my honey pot, making me look like a real human.
 
"Argh," I moaned and groaned at the same time, still having pleasure.
 
After a few minutes, I felt a sense of relief already within me, and his dick was pouring out his sperm on my skin, which made me happy.
 
"Mia, thanks," he smiled, making me blush.
###chapter 24
Mia POV
 
"Ethan," I said, walking into his room with my well-dressed office wear.
 
He gazed at Mr. for a while before he gave me his low-key smile.
 
"Where are you off too?" He looked at himself in the mirror, adjusting his tie.
 
"Work, of course." 
 
"Good," he said, but he still didn't give me another look.
 
"How do I look?" 
 
"Stunning," he turned to me, saying.
 
"So, what are you waiting for?" He asked as he picked up a few documents.
 
"You, of course," he said, looking at me with a surprised-filled face.
 
" What!" 
 
"You can take one car and move on." 
 
"You should have told me since then." I tried to hiss but quickly hid it.
 
"I have once told you that." 
 
"You never."
 
"I did."
 
"Stop arguing with a lady and accept the facts," I said with a serious look.
 
"I won't accept the fact, Mia," he smiled, looking at me.
 
" Why?" I questioned, giving a stern look quickly.
 
"Because I told you!" 
 
"You didn't." 
 
"Okay... Okay..."" Ethan smiled as he adjusted his back.
 
"I accept; I didn't tell you." I smiled in acceptance.
 
"Better you accept that." It caused a chuckle between us both.
 
 
I smiled smoothly, feeling a sense of victory plus happiness, and I quickly turned to leave.
 
"Have a great day at work today," Ethan called out as I walked out of the room, feeling so proud already.
 
I made my way to the car with the guard close to me holding the keys, feeling confident and prepared for the day ahead of me. 
 
As myself and the guard drove to work, I couldn't help but think about the conversation I just had with Ethan much earlier today.
 
I was still a bit annoyed that he hadn't told me about the car and made me dress myself, but I was glad we were able to work through it and get the whole issue resolved with him accepting.
 
When I arrived at the office with a deep breath, I was greeted by the familiar sight of cubicles from my coworkers and the sound of keyboards clacking as I walked in. 
 
I made my way to my own table, settled in, and began to tackle the tasks of the day with thought.
 
But as I was working and trying to get familiar with things around me, I noticed a familiar face across the room. 
 
It was a face I hadn't seen in some time, a face I never thought I could be happy to see again. It was literally the face of the girl who had betrayed me earlier in my life and who had ruined my life turned down from a little bit good.
 
My heart began to race as I watched her closely, trying to process what I was seeing gently. 
 
"What is she doing here? How did she end up here working at the same place as me?" I questioned myself, looking closely to see if I was actually seeing right.
 
I felt a surge of emotions deep within, from anger to sadness to confusion and anger. 
 
I didn't know what to do at that point or how to react to what I was seeing. 
 
Part of me wanted to confront her and tell her exactly what was on my mind, to demand answers and closure.
 
But another part of me just wanted to ignore her, pretend she didn't exist, and face my life issues.
 
As I sat there looking, I was frozen in indecision. She looked up and caught my eye quickly.
 
For a moment, we just stared at each other with no words, but the tension between us was palpable. Then she looked away, and I was left to wonder what would happen next to us both.
 
I took a deep breath and made up my mind to confront her.
 
"Hello Sarah," I held her, her shoulders dragging her to look at me.
 
"Hi, Mia," her words filled me with stammer and fear.
 
"Long time, Sarah." I wore a quick face filled with anger already, with her shaking quickly as if I were about to take her life away.
 
"Yeah," her words were shivering like her legs and body.
 
"So, you work here also," I questioned.
 
"I'm a part-time worker."
 
"What kind of work?" I asked with a stern look.
 
" Adviser" I raised my eye brow up.
 
"Do you know you are just evil?" She Interrupted.
 
"N..."
 
"Shut up!" I said to her as she interrupted with her words.
 
"You sold me out and made me out to the one I was not ready to face-to the one I never loved." She just looked at me with fear that was visible in her eyes.
 
"Not," I interrupted her.
 
"Did you know that after we met at the hotel, I took you as a best friend, which led me to give you trust?" she interrupted after gaining confidence.
 
"Mia, can you talk at least?" She screeched.
 
"Why shout when we can settle this issue calmly without involving another?" I said calmly, like one villain in a Hollywood movie series.
 
"Mia, I did what I did for the happiness and well-being of the Joshua family."
 
"Call that name with respect."
 
"Whatever," she hissed slowly.
 
"Mia, you must believe that I did this for both your happiness and the happiness of the family." Her voice was calm and firm.
 
"You call betraying me happiness? You call keeping me in a trap happiness?" I said.
 
"Okay, I'm sorry for the betrayal that you are talking about," she pleaded.
 
"But... " My words were cut short by the voice from behind.
 
"Mia, what's happening?" I looked to the entrance to see it, Ethan.
 
"Ethan, I'm trying to settle a matter here!" I said it arrogantly.
 
"What kind?"
 
"Can you give us some privacy?" myself and Sarah said to Ethan at the same time frame, which made me look at me weary.
 
"Hey," he said, giving a slight bow before he walked out.
 
"Mia, I'm totally sorry for going against your own will." Sarah smiled as she drew closer to me.
 
"Just stay away from me and my own issues!" 
 
"Sorry," she smiled.
 
"Excuse me." 
 
"Can I get a hug at least?" She behaved as if we were already friends.
 
" Why?".
 
"Aren't we friends?" she hissed.
 
"Read my lips." I drew myself closer to her. 
 
"We can't be friends during that period."
 
###chapter 25
Mia POV
 
"Mia darling," I heard the voice that was more than familiar to me.
 
From the words, I knew it was my mom, and I wasn't by any chance ready to go through her at this time. 
 
I just sat down in my own room with me going through my phone, still not giving her any ears at all.
 
"Mia, I know you can hear me loud and clear." I still ignored her words as if a low-class person were talking to me.
 
"Can you just leave?" I said it arrogantly.
 
"Do you realize you are talking to your mom?" She asked.
 
"Yes, I know I'm talking to the one who sold me out," I replied arrogantly.
 
"Can you get out with your words of my selling you out?" 
 
"Then what did you do if you didn't sell me out?" I still went through my phone, keeping her standing outside.
 
"I never did," she replied quickly.
 
"Then what did you do?" 
 
"I just gave your hands out in marriage without you knowing, and that is not selling out." This made me chuckle.
 
"You shouldn't have wasted your parents school fees," I replied.
 
"You won't be happy if I walk into there."
 
"How bad can you be?" I replied.
 
"Don't dare me, Mia." I just gave a long hiss.
 
"Who wants to dare you?" I asked.
 
"Meet me in the sitting room now," she commanded, hearing the sounds of her footstep.
 
 
I sighed a little bit and put down my phone on the bed, knowing I couldn't avoid her forever since she was my mother.
 
I made my way to the sitting room since she made it a compulsory thing already. As I walked in, my mom was already seated, looking stern and serious.
 
I sat down across from her, trying to appear nonchalant and arrogant.
 
"So, what's all this about?" I asked, trying to hide my annoyance and anger.
 
"I want to talk to you about your behavior and something else," she said, her eyes marrowing with me and giving me an arrogant look. 
 
"Firstly, you've been acting out lately, and I'm not happy about that character of yours."
 
I rolled my eyebrow. 
 
"What behavior are you talking about?"
 
"Don't play dumb, Mia," she said with a stern look that waved at me.
 
"I know all about your little outburst at the office. And now you're being disrespectful to me?" Her words just sounded like false news to me at that moment.
 
"I'm just expressing my feelings in the best way I can."
 
"Well, you need to learn to control your temper, Mia," she said with a hissing at the end of every statement. 
 
"And you need to start showing some respect to your elders and not excusing me and your father-in-law."
 
Just then, the doorbell rang. My mom's and my own eyes flicked to the door, and then back to each other. 
 
"That must be Ethan," I said. 
 
"Did you ask him to come over so we could have the meeting like a general one?"
 
My heart began to race as I realized what was about to go on. 
 
My mom had already set me up, and now she was trying to manipulate Ethan into taking her side.
 
Why would she be telling me about my character when Ethan was about to come in?
 
Ethan walked in with a smile, looking unaware of the tension in the room.
 
"Hey, what's going on?" He asked, sitting down next to me with his face filled with a smirk.
 
My mom smiled towards him, but it didn't reach her eyes. 
 
"Just having a little family chat," she said as I looked at her nastly, with Ethan giving me a face peck.
 
"Mia and I were just discussing her behavior." At that point, I felt like picking up a knife and piercing it into her belle.
 
Ethan looked at me, concern etched on his face, with an awkward look.
 
"I hope everything is okay."
 
I nodded, trying to play it cool and calm despite my already boiling anger within me.
 
Within, I was seething and grinning. My mom was hiding something, and I was determined to find out what her plan in this house was for.
 
Knowing myself and Ethan are already getting tied together, it could be her main anger reason.
 
"Mother, can you just go into the main reason why we are all here?" I asked rudely, adding a nasty look.
 
"Okay," she said, getting out of her comfort zone.
 
 
 
"Okay, fine," my mom said, her eyes flashing with seriousness, which just didn't catch me.
 
"If you want to know the reason why we're all here, I'll tell you," she said, giving a Stern look.
 
"But you both need to listen carefully and not interrupt me." Her commands sounded rude to me already, which made my thirst for the meeting topic just die.
 
I nodded, my eyes fixed on my phone already.
 
Ethan looked at me curiously, with him giving me a sign to concentrate on my mom's words, which I just had to accept. 
 
"My decision to give your hand in marriage without your knowledge was not taken lightly," my mom began her words to us, which I had less interest in already.
 
"I did it for your own good, Mia. You're not thinking clearly, and you need guidance on how life is; you need to know the difference between your left and right."
 
I felt my anger rising within me as she said those words, but I bit my tongue not to interrupt. With her beginning statement, I became so curious to know more.
 
"But that's not just the only reason we're here," she continued, clearing her throat.
 
"There's something else behind all these. Something really important."
 
She paused, looking at Ethan, and then back at me with a more frowning face or just an overly serious look.
 
"What is it you have to stay again?" I asked with anger boiling over me and my patience wearing thin.
 
My mom took a deep breath before releasing her statement.
 
"I'll tell you, but, Mia, you need to promise me you'll listen and not get angry."
 
I raised an eyebrow, giving a slight nod.
 
"What could you possibly say that would make me angry apart from bringing in my past?"
 
My mom hesitated, and I could see the fear and guilt in her eyes. What was she hiding again? My heart wasn't at rest with her.
 
"Just tell us," Ethan said, his voice firm and calm, with him also kept in the web of suspense.
 
My mom nodded shortly, but she didn't say anything else. She just sat there, her eyes piecering into mine.
 
I felt a chill run down my spine. What is going on with her?.
 
 
 
 
###chapter 26
Mia POV
 
My eyes were fixed on that of my little baby boy, and we both looked at each other as if a contest or TV program were being displayed.
 
No words from either of us, but the distraction came in from the sitting room door, but I just didn't bother to check it up.
 
"It seems you both are busy." Ethan walked out with his questions. 
 
"Hello," Alexander said, quinking his eyes, which gave me the whole victory.
 
I won," I  llaughed carrying up the little boy, who gave a frown.
 
As I looked towards the door area, the female figure walked in with a smirk at me, making Alexander leave me and run up to the lady.
 
"Amanda," he hugged her.
 
"Hello, little one," she smiled and squatted to carry the baby.
 
"What are you doing here?" I questioned her, wearing a quick frown and just looking at her face.
 
"I just came around to my big sister house," she smiled to me as she came closer to me while I adjusted back.
 
"Who is your big sister?" I asked as I dragged my baby out of her hands.
 
"Mia, let the past be and focus on the present," I chuckled.
 
"You are a funny person." Ethan just looked at me and my dramatic sister.
 
"For real, you have beef with everyone in your family?" 
 
"It's my life and not yours, Ethan." My words turned agreeable at that point as I looked at Ethan.
 
"Don't you take my recent weakness to heart. I am doing what I am doing now for a reason," I screeched out to him.
 
"And you, Amanda?" I turned to her.
 
"What is your main reason here?" My words flowed with anger.
 
 
Amanda's face looked taken aback by my outburst of words, but she quickly composed herself so I wouldn't find out. 
 
"Mia, I know we haven't always seen eye to eye or talked, but I came here to make amends and fix the wrong things. I want us to move past our differences and be sisters again like we have always been." Amanda smiled, saying her words.
 
I raised an eyebrow, skeptical with anger.
 
"And what makes you think I want to move past our differences? You've done nothing but betray me and hurt me time and time again, which hurts me badly." I sighed.
 
Amanda took a step closer, her eyes pleading and her body language being honest with me. 
 
"I know I've made mistakes earlier, Mia. But I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make it right, like before. I want us to be a family again and enjoy our good time."
 
I snorted and grinned.
 
"You want us to be a family once again? You want me to just forget about everything you've done and welcome you back with open arms and no anger? It doesn't work that way, Amanda. You should try another way."
 
Amanda's face fell, but she didn't give up with her pleading and words. 
 
"I know I can't undo the mistake or the past, but I want to work towards a better future. For us, for our family, Please, Mia, just listen to me and give me a chance."
 
I sighed, feeling a small weight of guilt deep within.
 
But I immediately pushed it aside, reminding myself of all the pain Amanda had already caused me-all the public disgrace.
 
"There's nothing to listen to, Amanda." My eyes were filled with anger.
 
"You've had your chance to make things right before, and you blew it away."
 
Amanda's eyes welled up with tears, and she took another step closer to me. Her face needed pity, but I can't offer that to her.
 
"Mia, please. I'm begging you this time. Don't shut me out, but accept me. Let me prove to you that I've changed and become a new person." I smiled at her words, and I felt a huge lie within.
 
Just then, I felt a small crack in my armor, but I quickly reinforced it.
 
"You've had your chances, Amanda. And you blew it away." I still said those words.
 
Just then, Ethan spoke up quickly after much silence. 
 
"Mia, maybe you should hear her out this time. Whatever happened between you two, it's clear that Amanda is trying to make amends and fix bad things." Ethan spoke slowly, as if he were scared to tell me his words.
 
I turned to him, my eyes flashing with anger and pain. 
 
"Stay out of this, Ethan. This is between me and my sister, not between us both."
 
Amanda took another step closer, her eyes piecering into mine.
 
"Please, Mia. Just listen to me this time. For our family's sake and your child's sake."
 
I looked at her, giving a lot of thoughts at that point, still looking at Amanda, who showed a lot of pity. 
 
I glanced at her with a frown at that point, and I was thinking a lot about myself at that stage.
 
"So, what do you want me to do now?" I asked with a free face.
 
"Forgive me and take me in," she pleaded.
 
"Okay," I smiled.
 
"Come here," I commanded her as she gave me a tight hug.
 
It happened to be really strange for me to accept the girl who accepted me to be sold out, back into my life and not only my life but in my house.
 
"Thank you, sis," she said with excitement as my mom walked down with a smile.
 
"Good morning, mother!" Amanda said as Sony as my mom walked closer to us both.
 
"I think this calls for celebration." Ethan's face got filled with excitement, which made him joyful.
 
I handed my child over to my sister, who always gave me a smirk.
 
Soon, drinks were available, followed by music and cake.
 
It happened to be a small celebration until I saw Sarah walk in. I just didn't give her any attention and just enjoyed my day with my family.
 
I just enjoyed my day with excitement for myself and my family.
 
###chapter 27
Mia's POV
 
"Mia, have come here for my child and not here to come rant words with you," his face got filled with anger as he said his words.
 
"What's he talking about?" Ethan asked me with laughter, and I gave an awkward chuckle.
 
"Andrew, what's wrong with you?" I questioned aggressively, looking into the young male figure at my front.
 
"Nothing is absolutely wrong with me; I just came here for my child."
 
"What child are you talking about here?" Ethan stepped in with a hard question.
 
The whole thing that started happening again just wasn't what I bargained for in my life much earlier; the always trouble, the always fight for one thing or the older just makes my life look like a roller coaster.
 
"Mia, knows what I am talking about?" He smiled with evil within him.
 
"I know nothing, Andrew." 
 
"Why are you denying now, Mia?" He laughed and dragged himself much closer to me.
 
"I'm not denying you, coward," I pushed him, adjusting back a little bit.
 
"How did you get into this house in the first place?" My body got filled with boiling emotions.
 
"That shouldn't be a problem since I'm here to take back my son." 
 
"What son are you talking about, young man?" Ethan asked himself, revealing anger.
 
"Young man, when I am talking, please don't." 
 
"Who are you to tell me to keep quiet until you are done talking?" Ethan drew closer to Andrew.
 
"Nevermind, young poor mister," Ethan said, folding his arms in anger as I pulled him from Andrew, whispering some words into his ears. "His deadly".
 
Andrew would possibly hear what I said since he laughed before taking his seat quickly.
 
"You know, I was once a poor young boy when Mia came to me." I interrupted him.
 
"That's our past, and that shouldn't be brought out here."
 
"And who said so?" 
 
"I do," he said, standing up, looking at me with evil within him.
 
I stood boldly to confront him. We both looked into each other's eyes with a deep frown, as if we were about to fight already.
 
"Mia!" Andrew laughed.
 
"Can I get my child so I can leave?"
 
"And I keep asking, whose child?" Ethan asked with his phone quickly in his arms.
 
"My child," I hissed.
 
"You weren't the one who had sex with me that night, so why are you coming to claim someone else's child?" I said.
 
"Mia, I'm the one you loved, not him," I interrupted.
 
"Andrew, that love has already expired."
 
"Why, Mia, why?" He asked with a pitiful face.
 
"When I was pregnant, I needed someone to rest my backs on, but you weren't there to help, but instead you ran away into a land that no one knows," he interrupted.
 
"I went out because of you and the baby." 
 
"What, baby? You coward," my voice got filled with emotions.
 
" Ours" 
 
"Shut the fuck up! Andrew," I commanded, stepping closer to him.
 
"You are a good for nothing coward," I spat at him at that point, looking so mean and wicked.
 
*****
 
The air within the room was thick with tension as we stood there, our eyes locked in each other, adding a fierce stare-down.
 
Andrew's face was already twisted in a mixture of anger and desperation, while mine was set in a determined scowl.
 
The silence was fully palpable, punctuated only by the sound of our heavy breathing and heart race.
 
Ethan stood there also frozen, his phone still clutched in his hand, his eyes darting back and forth between us, but still up busy scrolling slowly with his phone. 
 
Alexander, sensing the tension in the room, began to whimper slowly, his small body trembling with fear.
 
Andrew took a few steps closer, his eyes blazing with fierce intensity at me. 
 
"Mia, please," he begged, his voice low and husky, which was just like a whisper.
 
"I'm not leaving without my child." He said it with a frown and no cool tone anymore.
 
I laughed, a cold and calm, mirthless sound.
 
"Your child? Which one of them?" I spat, my voice dripping with venom and anger. 
 
"You abandoned us, Andrew. You left me to deal with the consequences of your actions alone."
 
"What's action are you talking about, Mia?" He asked.
 
"If you were rich enough, my mom would never have done what she did to me." My voice was firm and serious.
 
Andrew's face contorted in pain, but he refused to back down. Still, he accomplished an impossible goal.
 
"I know I made mistakes earlier, Mia. But I'm trying to make it right. Please, just give me my child and the love back." 
 
I sneered at him, my heart hardening with every passing moment that came by.
 
"You don't deserve him, even if he was your son," I hissed.
 
"You're not worthy of being a father or a boyfriend." My voice got filled with hatred for him.
 
Andrew's eyes flashed with anger, but he didn't back down, still trying to pull my legs and those of Ethan. 
 
"I'll do whatever it takes to get my child back," he snarled, his voice low and menacing, filled with malice and deep evil.
 
And with that word, he lunged at me, his arms outstretched to me.
 
I stood my ground, ready to defend myself and my child against this monster who dared to claim him, the monster who backed me down at a time when I needed him the most.
 
But just as our bodies were about to collide against each other, the doorbell rang, shattering the tension in the room.
 
"Who could that be?" Ethan wondered aloud, his voice laced with concern and anger.
 
I didn't answer; my eyes were still locked on Andrew's. The doorbell rang again, more insistent this time.
 
I just couldn't concentrate on the doorbell, but I was very concerned about my son.
 
"That one of my guards maybe," Andrew laughed out loud, fixing himself in the spot of the villain.
 
"I forgot to tell you I am now rich," he adjusted with his laugh, but it wasn't a funny thing to myself.
 
"How many people did you kill to accomplish that?" I questioned arrogantly.
 
"I didn't kill anyone, you animal." The door opened wide as a hefty man walked in with a bold, frowny, and Stern look.
 
"How dare you walk into my home without a permit?" I asked rudely, as the huge man just ignored my words as if I were just a low-life commoner.
 
He went close to the so-called boss and whispered a few words into his ears.
 
"Kelvin!! Kelvin!!" Ethan screeched out.
 
"I don't have much time here anymore," Andrew said as the hefty man just stood behind him.
 
"And who is so worried about that?" I laughed out loud.
 
"But next time, when I come here for him," my son hugged my legs with fear, with Andrew pointing at him.
 
"Just give him to me without much attack unless you all would ever regret it," he said, hissing as he looked at me nastly before he squatted, looking at the little boy whose fear had already filled.
 
"Son, I would always come here to fight for you," he smiled at Alexander.
 
"You cannot be my father," Alexander replied.
 
"Let's call this a day, Mia," he said before he walked out of me and Ethan.
 
"Andrew is playing with the tail of a lion" I laughed.
 
 
###chapter 28
Mia POV
 
"Did you both ever have sex during the relationship?" Ethan asked as we all sat down there at the round table.
 
"You were the one who disregarded me," I replied in a state of confusion.
 
"So, why is he here asking for the child?" Ethan asked calmly.
 
"That is also what I am confused about," I rubbed my hair, filled with confusion already.
 
"This just isn't fair. Why is my life going this way? I thought my life was about taking a better turn, but this time I just became worse," I said with my hands rubbing all over my hair, showing the confusion physically.
 
"What do you mean?" Ethan asked.
 
"It's something I can't just bring to the table since it reminds me of my past most often." My eyes already started getting wet slowly with me just saying the words.
 
"Mia." I interrupted my mother at that point.
 
"Mother, you are the whole cause of this confusion in this family." My mother has a more concerned look.
 
" How? What did I do wrong?" She asked with a pitiful look.
 
"You are asking me what you did wrong? You are just a shame," I said as I stood up with anger flowing through my veins.
 
"Watch your tongue, Mia!" My mom also stood up with anger in her voice stream.
 
"You are a strong disgrace to motherhood," I spat.
 
"Mia, that is our mother you are talking to." Amanda stood up with her own anger.
 
"And so what, coward?" I looked in Amanda's direction.
 
"Mia," I gave my warning to her as she mentioned my name.
 
"Don't you ever call my name from that hole in your ugly face?" I just released all my anger with my words.
 
I grinned with deep anger within me, and the room filled with tension.
 
"So, no one is talking now?" I broke the quick silence in the room.
 
"Mia, please calm down. Let's resolve this issue calmly," Ethan requested as he held on to my arms slowly.
 
I dragged my arm away from his. "You are also a coward, Ethan." I looked to him as we both eye-pieced each other.
 
" What!" He gave a surprise look.
 
"Myself and Andrew almost got into hand-to-hand combat, and you still stood there looking like an animal," he just gave a little chuckle.
 
"What's funny with what I just said?" I inquired.
 
 
 
"What's really funny here is that you're acting like a child, Mia," Ethan said, his voice calm and firm, which just made me increase my anger.
 
"We need to figure out how to deal with Andrew, not fight him physically and with you and have issues with everyone." He looked into my eyes calmly.
 
I glared at him, my anger boiling over.
 
"You don't understand anything, Ethan. You never have. You're just like the rest of them, always trying to calm me down and make me see reason. But I don't want to see the reason. I want to make Andrew pay for what he's done to me. I want him to experience the betrayal I got from him. "Tears dripped down my eyes slowly, with my heart filled with pain.
 
My mother stepped forward, her eyes filled with concern and pity, which was kind of legit. 
 
"Mia, darling, we need to talk about this once and for all. We need to figure out what's best for you and the baby, plus we need to keep you both safe."
 
I laughed. A bitter sound came from me.
 
"What's best for me and the baby? You don't even know what that means. You've never been there for me, mother. You've never supported me, and you have never shown me motherly love." 
 
"Mia, we're just trying to help. We just want what's best for you and Alex." Amanda Said.
 
I turned to her, my anger and hurt pouring out of me.
 
"What's best for me and the baby? You don't even know what that means. You've never been a mother, Amanda. You don't know what it's like to be raped and don't have a shoulder to stay on." 
 
The room fell silent, and the tension was thick and heavy. 
 
I could feel the weight of my words deep within-the pain and anger that I was carrying around. 
 
I knew that I was hurting my family already, but I couldn't stop. I couldn't stop the pain and anger from pouring out of me at this stage.
 
As I stood there for a while, my eyes filled with tears that were dropping, and I felt my body begin to shake and shiver.
 
I wept, wailed, and screamed, my body shaking with sobs and sorrow. I felt like I was losing myself at this point, like I was drowning in a sea of pain and anger plus fraud.
 
My family tried as much to comfort me, but I pushed them away.
 
. I didn't want their comfort anymore. I didn't want their support. I just wanted to be left alone, to wallow in my own pain and anger, plus fraud.
 
But as I wept deeply, I knew that I couldn't stay like this forever. I just knew that I had to find a way to move on with life and let the past be, to find a way to deal with Andrew and his claims over the child that isn't his. I knew that I had to find a way to be strong like before, for myself and for my baby boy.
 
And so I took a deep breath, with thoughts in my head, and I began to calm down slowly.
 
I began to think about trying to come up with plans since I knew that I couldn't do it alone, but I also knew that I couldn't trust my family or anyone not exculding Ethan.
 
I needed someone else, someone who could help me and support me all the time.
 
And then, after a long time of thinking, like a bolt of lightning, it hit me.
 
I knew exactly what I needed to do. I knew exactly who I needed to turn to and face trust.
 
"Google," I said with a forced smile.
 
"I need to Google something." I said I was picking up my phone.
 
Everyone just looked at me, confused.
 
"What do you need to Google now, Mia?" my mother asked with an unfamiliar face.
 
I just smiled, a small smile on my face, a determined smile.
 
"I need to Google how to get a restraining order to settle things."
 
The room fell silent quickly, the tension thick and heavy within everyone's heart.
 
I knew that I had to make a decision-a decision that might change things.
 
And as I sat there, my eyes fixed on the screen of my phone, I knew that I was ready.
 
I was ready to take control of my life and of my situation. I was ready to face Andrew; anytime he comes again, trying to claim something that doesn't belong to him,.
 
 
###chapter 29
Mia POV
 
I was filled with anxiety and a nervous spirit as I walked into the office of the young lawyer.
 
"Hello Ethan," the young lady gave Ethan a hug as if they were besties.
 
"Who is she?" Her voice was like a whisper, but I could still drag out her words.
 
"She's Mia and my wife."
 
"Wow, you are married," the young lady laughed.
 
"Stop acting childish." Within me, the character they both possess just acted childish.
 
"Hello, beautiful lady Mia," the young lady said, looking at me with her hands stretched towards me.
 
"Hello," I smiled, accepting the smooth hug.
 
"Come here," she said, stretching her hands for a hug, which I accepted.
 
In a few seconds, the hug was over, and the happiness in the room just made everywhere lively and interesting.
 
*****
 
The young lawyer, whose name was Sophia, had a very generous spirit toward us. 
 
I sat down in one of the chairs in front of her desk, with Ethan sitting beside me. Sophia sat down behind her desk and smiled at us, which we both smiled back at.
 
"So for main business," she said, gazing at us both without a smile.
 
"Mia, Ethan, what can I do for you?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with interest and thoughtfulness.
 
I took a deep breath within and launched into the story of Andrew's betrayal and his claims of wanting to be a part of our child's life.
 
 
Sophia listened closely, her expression growing more and more serious as I spoke.
 
When I finished with all the words, Sophia nodded thoughtfully.
 
"I see," she said with a smirk.
 
"Well then, first of all, let me tell you that you have every right to be concerned about Andrew's intentions towards you." She immediately picked up a piece of paper.
 
"His behavior towards you has been unacceptable, and it's clear that he has no regard for your well-being." She said it with a low smirk.
 
"Thank you, dear," I said, feeling a sense of relief wash over me all due to her words.
 
 
 
Sophia smiled. "Not at all. Now, let's talk about what we can do to protect your child and yourself. But have you considered getting a restraining order against Andrew?" She questioned me like a police detective.
 
I nodded slightly. "Yes, I have been thinking about that since yesterday, but I still don't know if it's enough to make him stay away."
 
"A restraining order could possibly be a good start, but it may not be enough to keep Andrew away from your child. We may need to take further action to ensure your child's safety plus yours," Sophia nodded, saying her words.
 
"What kind of action do you mean, Sophia?" Ethan finally spoke up.
 
Sophia leaned forward, looking at her best friend from eyeball to eyeball. 
 
"Well, we could just consider filing for full custody of the child, with supervised visitation for Andrew. That way, you can ensure that your child is safe and that Andrew is not able to harm him or you." Sophia leaned back to the chair.
 
Her words just provided hope for me at that point. "That sounds like a really good idea," I said with a smirk.
 
Sophia nodded with her own smirk. 
 
"I think it's a great idea. And don't worry; I'll be with you every step of the way. We'll work together to make sure that your child is protected and that Andrew is held accountable for his actions and his coming to claim something that isn't his."
 
I felt a deep sense of gratitude towards Sophia, and I knew that I had made the right decision by coming to meet her.
 
With her words and support, I knew that I could face whatever challenges lay ahead and ensure that myself and my child were safe and happy.
 
As we both left Sophia's office, I felt a sense of hope and trust that I had not felt in a long time. 
 
I knew that the road ahead would not be easy, but I was already ready to face it head-on, with Sophia and Ethan by my side.
 
" Wait.""As myself and Ethan were about to leave the office area, I felt that I had forgotten something in there.
 
" What?" Ethan asked as I opened up my bag to confirm if I actually left something in her office.
 
"My phone." I still just opened my bag, searching every single space.
 
"I think it is in the Sophia office," I said, looking up at Ethan.
 
 
I turned back and headed up to her office.
 
"Hey, wassup?" As I opened the door, she quickly asked.
 
"I forgot my phone here," she quickly said, opening the little cupboard beside her and bringing out a phone that looked just like mine.
 
"Thanks a lot." I felt relieved already with her helping to spot my phone.
 
"I wanted to call Ethan," she said, stretching her hands toward me with the phone, which I accepted.
 
"Thanks," I smiled to get my phone buzz as soon as it was already in my arms.
 
"Why is my mother calling me?" I looked in the direction of Ethan.
 
"Pick it up; maybe it's something important," he said.
 
"Yeah," Sophia added.
 
 
"Mia," my name, was called from the other end.
 
" "Mother, what' happening?""My mother's voice immediately got filled with fear, which made her stammer in her sentence.
 
"It's Alexander," she said, giving me quick fear.
 
"What's wrong with him?" My heart started to race quickly.
 
"He has been kidnapped."
###chapter 30
Mia POV
 
"Why kidnapping my son, Andrew?" My voice was filled with negative anger that could make me destroy anything that came my way.
 
My main happiness had been taken away from me, still under my eye. The pain that flows within me knowing that I have been deprived of joy already just because of some crazy fight.
 
"I didn't kidnap your son; I just took him away so he could be with his father and his mother, a true lover." The words from the other end of the call chased me quickly.
 
"Do I have to repeat all this?" I asked quickly, with anger deep within my voice.
 
"Repeat what, dear Mia?" 
 
"He's not your child, and he can never be yours, Andrew." My voice was filled with malice and hate.
 
"So, what are you trying to tell me?" He questioned me with an arrogant voice.
 
"Our past can't do anything with the present."
 
"If you want to see your child, I would send you an address to his location." The voice from the other end just went off after his words towards me.
 
I threw my phone to the bed immediately, with my arms wrapped to cover up my face with deceit and gate towards my past.
 
Thought ran through my head uncontrollably with my heart racing. Soon, the buzz on my phone just drags me hold, and I look towards it.
 
It was the live location of where my son is. I was already eager to go find him with the location I have with me.
 
"At the Grand Park Hotel," I read out to myself, with my eyes stuck to my screen.
 
I lay down on the bed with my eyes counting the cells and my head calculating a lot at that moment.
 
After much thought, I stood up, walked into the bathroom, and took a nice, hot shower. My face filled with shades of the cry already.
 
To me, it was already time for me to hijack my future into my arms and do what was right for me to do.
 
"Where are you off too?" The words made me turn back.
 
"Saving my son," I said, returning to look into the mirror. 
 
"You mean saving our son?" he drew nearer towards me with his serious and Stern look.
 
"It's my child, and I must always help him out of any challenges," I said as I stood up from the mirror with blue jeans, a track top, and well-packed ponytail hair with my wrist watch on my right wrist.
 
"Where are you going?" As I walked towards the door area, his question drew me to look at him.
 
"I have answered that." I walked out of the room with a deep breath.
 
I walked out of the mansion without my car with me. As soon as I made my way out of the mansion, I walked through the street, waiting for the taxi to pass me by.
 
I waved my arms towards him. "Grand Park hotel" . I said this to the young man who smirked.
 
"Hop in," he commanded with a nice tone. 
 
I opened up the back door and bounced my ass on the chair with an eye stick next to my phone. I went through my contact list.
 
"Andrew, what room?" I asked with arrogance.
 
"Room 105"; the voice from the other end sounded more happy.
 
"I'm on my way," I said, cutting off the call.
 
The ride took a few minutes, and we were already at the hotel area. I stepped down and looked around the huge hotel that stood at my front with many glasses.
 
"Thanks," I said, passing the money to the taxi driver through the open window.
 
"Keep the change," I requested of him.
 
I took a big breath deep within myself and made a few steps into the luxurious hotel with its beautiful cabins.
 
"Hello ma'am, welcome to the Grand Park," the beautiful female receptionist smiled towards their statement towards me, which I also faked my smile to.
 
"I came to visit someone here," I said to her with a smile.
 
"Name and room number," her fingers went through the laptop set at her front.
 
"Andrew," I paused. "Room number 105," I added.
 
She picked up the fax phone and drew the number of someone I don't know. Soon, she approved me and made me go up to him.
 
Reaching the room, I gave a smooth knock as anger filled within me.
 
"Welcome," Andrew said, opening the room door as I stepped in.
 
I looked around quickly to see where my son might be. I felt a cold hug in my leg area, which made me look down.
 
"Alexander," I dragged him up quickly, with happiness filled within myself at that point.
 
"Mommy, I missed you." He gave me a hug, which I accepted happily.
 
"Mia," the soon-to-be happiness ended when Andrew called up my name.
 
"What is your main plan, Andrew?" I asked, bringing my son to the floor.
 
"You are my main plan." 
 
"What do you mean by that?" I asked, taking my child behind me.
 
"You know what I want," he said.
 
"No!" I said with anger.
 
"I never needed your child." 
 
"So, what do you want from me then?" I interrupted his words to give mine.
 
"I want you, Mia." 
 
"You must be daydreaming, Andrew," I hissed with malice.
 
"No, I just want us to continue from our past." I just interrupted his words.
 
"What we had in the past belongs to the past, and we should not drag them into this," I said arrogantly as I held my child's arms.
 
"I hope you didn't hurt him." I looked at my son.
 
" No!"
 
"That's good for you," I said, turning towards the door.
 
"And do you think leaving would be so easy for you without me getting a part of you?" he said with an annoying laugh.
 
"Andrew, you seize to amaze me all the time." I laughed back at him, turning to look at him.
 
"Do you think I came unprepared?" I still laughed at him.
 
" Yes!"
 
I took up my phone, which I made him look at with a slightevil smile.
 
"You see this?" I still smirked with evil.
 
"Once you get closer to me, I will press the send button, and everything we discussed here will be sent to my lawyer for real proof of the art," he laughed.
 
"Did you think that I am stupid, Mia?" he drew closer.
 
"Yes, you are stupid, Andrew." An interruption came from the door as it opened up quickly.
 
"I tried to stop him and these other guys, but they were hard," the receptionist cried out.
###chapter 31
Mia POV
 
I stood looking to the outer world from my room window when the sudden clap from behind brought me back from the other side of the thinking world.
 
"What are you still thinking about?" I was on top of my voice when he asked the foolish question.
 
"Why, would you be asking that?" 
 
"I am just trying to be caring for once!" His voice was much calmer than mine.
 
******
 
"I don't really need your care!" I snapped, crossing my arms over my chest with an angry glance at him. 
 
"I can take care of myself, so thank you very much." I hissed at Malice.
 
He sighed and walked closer to me, his eyes plugging into mine and his footsteps echoing in the silent room.
 
"Mia, I know you're really struggling. You've been staring out that window for hours, lost in different thoughts. What's going on?" His question sounded with much pity in his voice.
 
I turned my eyes away from him, not wanting to face his really concerned expression.
 
"Nothing, Ethan. Please just leave me alone." I commanded.
 
But he didn't still leave me, as I wanted. Instead, he placed a gentle hand on my broad shoulder, his little touch sending shivers down my spine immediately.
 
"Mia, please, you can talk to me. What's actually bothering you again?"
 
I pulled off his hand, feeling a lump form in my throat at this point. 
 
"You wouldn't understand, Ethan," I whispered, my voice barely audible but good to hear.
 
Ethan's eyes narrowed slowly, and his jaw clenched in frustration and pity. 
 
"Try me," he said, his voice firm but gentle, with his Stern look filled with pity.
 
I just hesitated, unsure if I should open up to him at this stage, despite the fact that the fact that he knows a lot already. 
 
But something in his eyes made me just trust him, making me want to confide in him at this time despite my saying I couldn't do so.
 
Soon, I took a deep breath and began to speak, the words tumbling out of me like a dam breaking out of its hold.
 
"It's just that... I feel so lost and pained, Ethan. I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle of pain, heartache, depression, and sorrow. I thought I was doing okay at this time, but the truth is, I'm not. I'm barely holding on." My tears filled with tears already.
 
Ethan's expression quickly softened, his eyes filling with compassion and huge pain.
 
"Oh, Mia," he whispered, his voice full of empathy and huge pity. 
 
"I had no idea about all this, but. Why didn't you tell me?" He asked curiously.
 
I sniffed, feeling a tear roll down my cheek slowly.
 
"I didn't want to lay my own burden on you or anyone else. You have enough on your plate already." His face was filled with pity, while mine was filled with tears dripping down.
 
Ethan's face contorted in pity, but not at me. At himself. 
 
"I'm your husband, Mia. Your only husband. I'm supposed to be here for you, not the other way around," Ethan said.
 
I smiled weakly with still tears, feeling a small sense of comfort wash me slowly.
 
"You are here for me, Ethan. More than you know." I said quickly.
 
And in that moment, something shifted between us both. A connection formed, a bond that went beyond that of a mere couple. 
 
I saw it in his eyes-the way he looked at me with a newfound intensity. And I felt it in my heart-a fluttering sensation that I couldn't ignore, but I still had to look into his own eye.
 
But I pushed itall aside, unsure if I was ready to face those feelings while dealing with other pain. 
 
Instead, I took a step back, creating distance between us both. 
 
"Thanks, Ethan. Just knowing you're here for me makes me feel better." He smiled at me as I said those words.
 
Ethan smiled deeply.
 
"Anytime, Mia. I will always be with you and stand for you," he smiled, holding up my arms.
 
"But the main issue here is trying to choose." I restricted my arms from his turning back to the window.
 
"What is that?" Ethan drew closer to me.
 
"I have many people's souls in my arms, and I don't want to hurt any one of them." My eyes got wet at this point also.
 
"You are keeping me in the dark," his voice filled with suspense.
 
*****
 
Ethan's eyes narrowed slowly, and his voice was firm but gentle and calm.
 
"What do you mean by all this, Mia? What people are you talking about? And what choice do you have to make? Please say something." 
 
I sighed softly, feeling the weight of my secrets bearing down on me with my mouth shut to anything.
 
"It's just that I have to choose between you and Andrew."
 
Ethan's expression didn't change as I expected of him, but I saw a visible pain in his eyes already.
 
"Mia!" he said, his voice neutral and calm.
 
I hesitated quickly. "I'm just confused now," I whispered, my eyes dropping in shame and disgrace at myself.
 
"Do you want to pick Andrew over me?" he questioned.
 
"Not really, but..." he immediately caught me short.
 
"But what? I think you already started developing feelings for me." His eyes filled with tears just made me look sadder and more worried.
 
"I have, but there is a big issue on the ground here, Ethan!" I screeched.
 
"And what's that?" He questioned.
 
"My son! Our son!" I replied.
 
"So you are taking him over me?" 
 
"And who said that?" I questioned her arrogantly.
 
"You did so.".
 
"I never did!" I shouted.
 
"Please leave me and give me a chance to think," I said, pointing towards the door post.
 
"But..." I cut him short.
 
"Leave! Now!"
###chapter 32
Andrew POV
 
I seethed with deep anger as I watched Mia and Ethan picture together, with me weeping within myself.
 
"How could she move on so quickly and have no feelings for me anymore?" I asked myself with anger within myself.
 
"Didn't she know that I was the one who truly loved her and could do anything for her? added with a groan.
 
Soon, my mind raced with ways to get her quick back to myself, to make her see that I was the only one for her and could take care of her. 
 
And then a quick plan formed. A plan to make her suffer and make her regret choosing the loser instead of me, to make her realize what she had lost.
 
"Nate! " I carried up the name with a loud voice, with veins visible on my neck.
 
My eyes are turning pale already, and tears are about to fill up my face with what I just saw. Rejection from the girl I loved with everything, only because I left her when she needed me the most, but something she just didn't understand was that I did everything I did because of her and her well-being.
 
"Boss," the young, hefty figure drew himself closer to my standing position. I turbed back around, looking at the young man with his head down and chest breathing hard.
 
"I need your help," my voice filled with anger and malice.
 
"What happened, boss?" He asked with concern about my statement.
 
"I need to deal with someone," he interrupted.
 
"No one touches that tail of a lion and goes out so freely," he sniffed in hard as I gazed at him up until down.
 
Nice!""I chuckled within myself. "I swear to do anything within myself to get them out of my way." I grinned, saying the words slowly, just like a whisper.
 
"So, what is the plan?" He asked with a huge frown.
 
"Killing, of course; taking my enemy out of the way; doing what you are good at!" The young man laughed out so loudly with evil filled within his laughter and excitement.
 
"Just get that done," he concluded.
 
" Wait.""As he turned around, I called him back.
 
"Sorry, sir," he slightly bowed.
 
"Don't you need his information?" I said to him.
 
"Yes," he said quickly.
 
I just told him all I knew about my so-called enemy and the one I wanted out of my way.
 
He left me all alone in the room, filled with darkness, and myself filled with thoughts.
 
My head is running with different thoughts, as if it were a race, and it is very important that I do so. 
 
"Yes," I jumped up from the bed after discovering the perfect plan I needed to get my perfect revenge on those who wanted me out.
 
I walked into the bathroom with no dress, taking a quick shower before putting on normal office wear.
 
I applied all I wanted, with a smile as well. My mind was still filled with all my thoughts and what I wanted.
 
I walked out of the room, picking up one of the cars, with a bodyguard beside me.
 
I took a deep breath and finally had a had a concussion on my plan, and I just couldn't wait to do what I had in mind.
 
"Boss, am I to attack the villain as soon as we arrive at his place?" Nate questioned with his visible curiosity.
 
"No, I have another plan that is better than attacking now." I gave an evil smile as I ended those words.
 
Directing the driver was quite hard for me and wasn't easy, but still, you have already arrived at my destination. Arriving at that main place, I wanted to have my great revenge.
 
"This is the office" I said as soon as I stepped out of the car, adjusting my suit to fit well.
 
Okay, sir,""he groaned.
 
I walked through the hallway of the large skyscraper building, taking each elevator to approach my destination. Soon I was there, standing in front of the young, cool lady.
 
"Hello, sir, please, what can I do for you?" She gave a bold smile.
 
"Where's Ethan?" I asked rudely.
 
"Sir, my boss is quite busy now and can't see anyone." Her smile just gets bolder.
 
"What if I tell you I am his brother and I need to see him for family issues?" I said with a much more serious and stern voice to the lady that just prevented me from walking in.
 
"I would have to confirm that," she smiled, picking up her fax phone quickly while keeping me there, standing with my hefty guy.
 
After a few minutes of waiting for her, she just gave me words that made me angry. "Sorry, he denied access," she smiled and got me more angry.
 
" Nate! Pack her up," she said, wearing a quick Stern look.
 
"What do you mean, sir?" She questioned.
 
"You heard me, right?" As Nate approached her, holding up her mouth tight, she took advantage to walk into the office.
 
It was so shocking to see both my enemies there, standing as if they were already waiting for my presence.
 
" Ethan?" I groaned as I walked into the room.
 
"How did you get in here?" His face was already filled with surprise, as was that of his wife.
 
"That's a long story," I said with a deep chuckle, walking towards the two who glanced at me. 
 
"Get out of here now?!" Mia said it with anger in her voice.
 
"Nonsense," I hissed.
 
"I just came here for a serious issue." My words got immediately interrupted.
 
 
"First of all, you would discuss all that in prison," Ethan said.
 
"You just want to prolong this issue," I said.
 
"What do you want?" Mia asked.
 
"Nice question?" I grinned, stepping towards Mia, whose anger was already visible in her eyes. 
 
I looked into my wrist watch. "I have less time here, so I would speak fast.".
 
"Then do," Ethan interrupted.
 
"Mia, you have one week to come back to me unless," Ethan interrupted.
 
"Unless what?" he said.
 
"Blood would flow and heads would roll.".
###chapter 33
Ethan POV
 
"I just don't blame him at all." I wandered all over the room with Mia sitting on the bed with a sad expression towards me.
 
"Ethan, calm down. Let's discuss how we can resolve all this," she said with a much calmer tone. 
 
I looked at her, and we were both eye-piercing into each other. I walked closer to her, giving myself a sitting space on the bed.
 
"Mia, I want you and I plus this family to get peace," I said with a calm look.
 
"Then you have to calm down for that to happen," she requested.
 
"I can't calm down when I know there's a huge issue on the ground" I stood up quickly.
 
"I need Andrew out of my way, Mia!" I whispered to myself.
 
"I can't believe you're even taking his own side," I said, my voice rising in anger immediately.
 
"I'm not taking anyone's side here in this matter," Mia said, with her voice calm and gentle.
 
"So, what is happening if you are not taking sides?" I asked with a calm tone.
 
 
"I just want us to resolve this issue peacefully without blood flowing like he said." 
 
"Peacefully? You are here, Mia," I repeated, my voice incredulous and filled with surprise as she just said a strange word to me. 
 
"What?" she inquired.
 
"How can we have peace when Andrew is still in the picture here? He's the only one who's been causing all the problems, Mia. He's the one who's been manipulating us and using our things and people against us. Since you rejected him."
 
"Manipulating us?" Mia said, her voice defensive and also filled with her own surprise.
 
"If you are being manipulated, then that is good for you," she hissed. "Bryan, I'm not some kind of puppet who can be manipulated anyhow. I'm a grown woman who can make my own decisions and  choices. She added.
 
"Really?" I said, my voice sarcastic, filled with tension and a little chuckle.
 
"Because it totally seems to me like you're doing exactly what Andrew wants you to do now. You're defending him and enabling him, even when he's clearly our own enemy and we both need to take him down."
 
"I'm not defending him here, Bryan; I'm just trying to be understanding and use my brain," Mia said to me with arrogance. 
 
"And I'm not enabling him in any way; I'm just trying to be compassionate and get some information." She added.
 
"Compassionate?" I repeated it, my voice disbelieving her statement. "You have the time for that in this battle?" I asked with already-deep anger.
 
"What's bad?" 
 
"You're being compassionate with the man who wants to take you away from me and your child? The man who wants to destroy our marriage and our peace?" My eyes were pale already.
 
"Ethan, just please," Mia said, her voice soft and calm. 
 
"Let's just talk about this calmly and rationally, like a mature adult and not like a toddler," she hissed to her words.
 
"I don't want to talk about it calmly and rationally, or rather like an adult. I want us to talk about this like  toddlers." I said, my voice angry, arrogant, rude, and annoyed. 
 
"I want us both to talk about it with passion and emotion. I want to talk about how much I truly love you and how much I want to protect you and my baby from Andrew." She said it calmly.
 
"Ethan, I love you," Mia added.
 
"But I also care about Andrew. Despite his being my ex, I don't want to see him hurt."
 
" Why?" I repeated, my voice filled with emotions.
 
"Can we just take him as a friend, Ethan, or is that much?" I interrupted her immediately.
 
 
 
 
"He's not a friend of ours, and he can never be, Mia. He is our main rival. He's a deep threat to our marriage, our family, and our happiness."
 
"But seriously, I don't see him the way you think." Mia words were already familiar to me.
 
"I see him as a person who needs our help and support in his life since he has already passed through a lot of problems.".
 
"Well, I don't see him that way that you think," I said with uncontrollable anger visible in my eyes.
 
"I see him as a person who needs to be stopped from taking away my peace. And I'm going to stop him, Mia. I'm going to protect our marriage and our family from him, no matter what it takes me, no matter the pain I would pass through."
 
"Ethan, please don't say that," Mia said, her voice worried and filled with emotions.
 
"Mia, what side are you even on?" I screeched with anger already.
 
"Oh, no one's side, Ethan," she smiled to me while I looked at her with my own anger.
 
"Mia, seriously, you aren't normal at all," she said, drawing herself closer to me.
 
"I know my way around and don't think I don't know what I am doing." She whispered slowly into my ears. "Also, I know Andrew better than you and know what he is capable of doing," she smiled as soon as she finished her statement.
 
"And what does that mean?" I groaned.
 
"You won't know now," she said again, keeping me in the dark.
 
"Can you just talk?" I questioned.
 
"Yes, I wish I could," she said, taking a few steps backwards.
 
"Mia, come back here," I said as soon as she tried walking out of the room.
 
"Ethan, I have a child to go look after," she said and walked out.
 
"What's wrong with her?" I questioned myself, bouncing on the bed quickly, with thoughts going through my mind so fast.
 
"She's acting so weird and abnormal," I said to myself as my phone beeped beside me, which I just ignored until a louder buzz from the same phone made me look in its direction and pick it up.
 
I opened up my phone and went through it. I was shocked by the text message I received from a private number.
 
"It's time to do what I promised," my eyes almost pulled out.
###chapter 34
Mia POV
 
"Where again, Mia?" Bryan walked closer to me with his questions as I had my fair getting fixed.
 
"Doing what we planned much earlier, babe," I responded shortly with a smile at this time.
 
"Please just be safe for me," he said, giving me a quick peck on myself.
 
" Okay..." I stood up with a deep breath while Ethan just couldn't get his eyes off me quickly. 
 
His eyes licked into mine with a much more caring face this time.
 
"You pervert," I smiled.
 
"You are more of a pervert than I am." We both laughed and ended with a hug.
 
We walked down the staircase with chatter and laughter towards each other.
 
"Mommy," I turned back quickly.
 
"Alexander," I smiled, stretching my arms towards him to receive a hug.
 
"Mommy, where are you going?" As he embraced him quickly, he made his way to ask the question, which I smiled at.
 
"Mommy, are you going to get something for the house?" I lied to him.
 
"But Anita could go, so you can stay," Ethan interrupted.
 
"No, she's the main mother of this house and needs to get things for herself," Ethan helped by also lying to the young boy.
 
"Okay, mommy," he said, smiling and giving me a smile.
 
"Yes, sweetheart," I said, kissing his forehead.
 
"Mommy," he called as I tried to discard him.
 
"What, sweetheart?" 
 
"I saw the young man in my dream." Ethan interrupted my words with another look towards him.
 
" Who?" He questioned, giving a Stern look.
 
"The man who took me away from the house when you bought it left," he smiled, feeling so free.
 
" Andrew?" 
 
"Yes, that's his name," I smiled fakely.
 
"Mommy," I interrupted his word.
 
"Ethan, I have to go now!" I said it with a smirk.
 
I quickly walked out, standing in front of one of the Jeeps, packed almost close to themselves. I stood for a while waiting for Ethan to be done with his child and talk, but standing there just gave me a lot of thinking on how to just get Andrew out of my way.
 
"Why did you take so much time?" I asked as soon as I noticed the presence of Ethan.
 
"Why panicking?" He questioned.
 
"You quite don't understand," I said, forcing a quick smile on my face.
 
"So, just calm down; slow and steady always win," he said as soon as a driver came closer to one of the Jeep's and opened up the back door.
 
"Have you called him?" Ethan asked again.
 
"Yes, his home is waiting for me," I said with a quick frown.
 
"Smile," he reacted, pulling my chick from side to side to give me back my smirk, which was I just hiding, knowing that I was about to do something crazy.
 
"Wish me luck." As I said those words, I walked out if he were walking into the car.
 
Ethan didn't even give me a reply but a positive smile. Soon, the driver just drove me off the huge mansion.
 
As the trip continued, my heart just kept on racing with anxiety and a lot of thought, thinking of what I was about to do.
 
"Madam," the driver quickly snapped me out of the thinking stage.
 
" What?" I reacted, looking as if I were angry with him snapping me off.
 
"Where are we stopping?" he questioned.
 
"I gave you an address, right?" I hissed.
 
"Yes, but that's a strict estate, ma'am," he said, still on his wheels. "People hardly go in there.".
 
*****
 
"Strict estate?" I repeated, my mind racing fast.
 
"Well, ma'am, that estate is owned by a very wealthy and influential person. They have tight security, and not many people are allowed in." he said.
 
My heart skipped for a beat as I processed this information. I had expected Andrew's estate to be luxurious, but I hadn't anticipated it to be this secure and tight.
 
"Don't worry about that; I have an appointment there," I said confidently.
 
"Okay, ma'am," he replied, his tone still the same.
 
As we both approached the estate, I could see that it was surrounded by high walls and iron gates for security. 
 
The driver stopped the car quickly at the entrance and announced our arrival through the intercom for the securities officer.
 
After a brief moment with the guard, the gates swung open, and we drove into the estate. 
 
The driver pulled up to the front door of the mansion and turned off the engine of the Jeep.
 
"Here we are, ma'am," he said, turning to me with a hint of curiosity while my heart kept racing.
 
I took a really deep breath, smoothing my dress and composing myself before stepping out of the car.
 
The driver followed, opening the door for me and escorting me to the entrance of the huge mansion.
 
As I walked into the foyer, I was struck by the beauty of the interior. 
 
"Welcome, Mia," a voice called out from the top of the staircase, to which I turned back.
 
I looked up to see Andrew descending towards me, a smile spreading across his face while mine turned to a frown.
 
"Andrew," I replied, my voice steady despite my racing heart going faster than I expected.
 
As he reached the bottom of the stairs, he extended his hand, and I took it slowly, allowing him to lead me into the mansion himself while keeping the driver out.
 
"I must really say, you look so stunning."
 
"Thank you," I replied.
 
We walked into a luxurious living room, and I couldn't help but notice the eerie silence of the estate.
 
"Can I offer you anything?" 
 
"No, thank you," I replied, my eyes scanning the room for any signs of danger or anything that could take my life.
 
"Very well then," he replied, his smile faltering.
 
"So, beautiful Mia, what brings you here today?" He asked with a calm tone.
 
I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what was to come at this point.
 
"I think you actually know why I'm here, Andrew." 
 
His eyes narrowed slowly, but he just said nothing, simply gesturing for me to continue with my words.
 
"I really want you to leave my family alone," I said, my voice firm and serious.
 
"Oh, Mia. You really are so naive, aren't you?"
 
My heart gave a fast race as he took a step closer to me.
 
"I'm not going to leave your family alone until I have you back," he said, his voice dripping with malice.
 
"In fact, I'm going to do everything within my power to destroy them and get you."
 
My blood ran quick cold as I realized the true extent of Andrew's hatred towards whom I love. I knew I really had to act fast or risk losing everything I held close to my heart.
 
"Andrew,you know I'm not going to let that happen," I said.
 
"You're no longer a match for me, Mia. I have the power and the resources to do whatever I want and do whatever I choose."
 
"We'll see about that, Andrew," I said, my voice dripping with confidence.
 
To be continued
###chapter 35
[Continuation from the previous ###chapter]
 
Mia POV
 
"Andrew, just stop all these empty words." I walked to him with a slow frown this time.
 
I look into his eyes with anger, but I still can't show up my anger. Looking at him just gave me more anger.
 
He just wanted me back and could do anything to do so, but I never want him again in this life, and me trying to do what myself and Ethan planned would just be a hard thing for me.
 
"Say something." I smiled slowly at him while his hands moved around my waist area.
 
"You know I always love you and could do anything for you," he smiled towards me again while I gave him the him the same look.
 
" Andrew!" He used his finger around my lips.
 
"No other words, dear," his face clashing against mine in a romantic way.
 
He said his words, breathing all over my neck and making me get wet slowly. My body and his are also glued to each other, making me feel his huge, dickey bulge.
 
"Andrew," I quickly restricted him, giving myself some breathing space.
 
"I'm married," he still drew himself closer to me, giving me another kind of feeling.
 
"I know, and that can't stop us from having fun, enjoying ourselves, and getting to know each other," Andrew said in a different romantic gesture to me.
 
"Andrew, I came here for a different thing and not this." I tried removing his hand from my body, but he still just did what he wanted.
 
"We never had these opportunities when we were in a relationship.".
 
"Yes, I tried keeping my virginity until we got married, but things turned around for us both," I said with a frown.
 
"That's our past, Mia, and we can change it for good, dear," I interrupted him.
 
"How?" I questioned.
 
"We can get married," my eyes narrowed to his words.
 
"How?? How did you think about such a thing?" I throw questions after questions at him.
 
"You just have to divorce Ethan and come back to your true love." I took a deep breath within myself and took a few steps forward toward him.
 
"You know," I paused, looking into his eyes, eyeball to eyeball.
 
"I love you and could do anything for you." I sucked my lower lips as previous experience ran through my head.
 
" Strange?" He smiled as we both gazed at each other.
 
We both looked at each other for a while before sticking our lips to each other fast. We kissed for a while, with both of us getting so horny and hard at this time.
 
"Let go upstairs for the main fun." We both made our way upstairs into a luxury-looking room.
 
********
 
As we broke apart from the French kiss, I felt a mix of emotions swirling inside of me.
 
I was quickly torn between my lingering feelings for Andrew and my commitment to my current husband, Ethan.
 
I knew I had to make a choice here, but my heart was pulling me in different directions and causing confusion.
 
"Mia, I can see the huge confusion in your eyes," Andrew said, his voice soft and calm.
 
"Hmmm," I reacted.
 
"I know this is a lot to take in at this point. But I want you to know that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make things right between us. I can do whatever it takes to make us be like before."
 
I took a deep breath and stepped back slowly, trying to clear my head, which was already filled with confusion. 
 
"Andrew, I need some time to think about all this. This is all so overwhelming already."
 
He nodded understandingly, giving me a quick breath and relief.
 
"I get it, Mia. You can take all the time you need. But just know that I'm here for you, and I'm not giving up on us, ever." He smiled.
 
I nodded with my own smile, feeling a sense of gratitude towards him. As I turned to make my way out of the room, he called out to me.
 
"Mia?"
 
"Yes?"
 
"Just remember, our past doesn't define us. We can create a new future together, like couples. I would be glad to have you back in my life."
 
I smiled towards him, feeling a glimmer of fake hope wash over me.
 
Maybe, just maybe, we could find a way to reconcile our past and possibly have peace on both sides. But for now, I needed time to think and reflect on my feelings and know what I really wanted for myself this time.
 
As I walked away from Andrew's luxurious room, heading to the sitting, I felt a sense of uncertainty.
 
I sat down there, viewing the huge plasma television placed in the sitting room. My eyes are viewing the television program, but my mind is far away with deep thoughts.
 
"Mia," I turned around with a blink of my eyes.
 
"Please, I want to go now." I stood up quickly from my sitting spot, picking up my bag.
 
"No problem," he smiled as I quickly picked up my bag.
 
I smiled back at him, feeling guilt within me, but still, I couldn't say any other words and just had to leave the young man.
 
"You are free to come anytime. I will always be here to welcome you," he grinned, adding a short smile to me, which I gave back to him.
 
 
###chapter 36
Mia POV
 
"How did it go?" 
 
"Bad, of course," I replied, hopping on the chair quickly.
 
" Why?" Ethan caked closer to me with a calm and Stern look.
 
" Ethan!" I looked at him eyeball to eyeball.
 
" What?" 
 
"How do you expect me to sleep with the guy I have low feelings for?" I said with a calm screech.
 
"But as part of what we discussed about Mia, you would sleep with him and then say it was rape and..." I interrupted his words.
 
"Ethan, even though I want him out of the way, I just can't do that," he interrupted.
 
"Do what?"
 
"Do what you ask of me? I can't just keep my body for my enemy to ride me for pleasure," I said still with a calm voice.
 
"Mia, I thought you were strong-headed." He questioned.
 
"I was once strong-headed and wanted him down, but this time around, I have to follow the protocols of life." 
 
"What protocols?"
 
"Can you just stop asking me useless questions, Ethan?" I urged.
 
"Why are you placing your attitude on me when you should have done that with the main rival?" He stood up with visible anger already.
 
"Ethan, I just can't sleep with him," he interrupted.
 
"But you once loved him," he said, this time with a calm tone.
 
"Yes, I once loved him, but still, I can't sleep with him." 
 
"Just give me a reason why."
 
"His is my past, and the past and present have nothing in common," I said with guilt riding my heart so fast.
 
" But..."
 
"Can this discussion just end now, please?" I stood up quickly.
 
*******
 
Ethan's expression just softened, and he nodded understandingly to me while I still glanced at him.
 
"Alright, Mia. I get it. Let's just drop it for now, as you said."
 
I nodded, feeling a mix of relief and guilt pounding in my chest. 
 
Relief that the conversation was ending already, but guilt for not being able to open up to Ethan about my true feelings. My body was calling to Andrew because I still remember the love I have for him. It still feels like yesterday to me when I feel in love with him but know the love is just clearing away.
 
I sat down again, looking into his eyes.
 
As we both sat in silence, I couldn't help but think about Andrew's words to me earlier.
 
"Our past doesn't define us." Was it true? Could I really move on from my past and create a new future with Ethan, or have I already created a new future? I always wanted Andrew back after he betrayed me, but why is this feeling coming back to me? Why is the attack as if I did something literally bad?
 
Ethan seemed to sense my thoughts and placed a gentle hand on my shoulder, giving me comfort in his arms.
 
"Mia, you're strong and capable of handling all this. You can get through this." His words were just like high motivation to me at this stage already, since my head had lots of thought running through it.
 
I smiled weakly at him, feeling a sense of gratitude and hope towards his words and look. 
 
"Thanks, Ethan. That means a lot coming from you, and I truly need that now." 
 
We both sat in comfortable silence for a while, the tension between us dissipating. We are both just not giving words to each other, but within us, thoughts and words flow unstoppably.
 
After a few moments, Ethan spoke up, breaking the long silence in the room.
 
"Mia, can I ask you something?"
 
"Sure," I replied, curious.
 
"What do you think is the biggest obstacle in our relationship?" He asked.
 
I hesitated, unsure of how to answer and what to say. But then, I realized that honesty was the best policy since that was my dad's latest word to me every time.
 
"I think it's definitely trust. I don't fully trust you, and I don't think you fully trust me either, just like a balance equation."
 
Ethan nodded thoughtfully, adding a sniff. 
 
"I think you're right. Trust is a big issue for us both. But I want you to know that I'm working on it. I want to earn your trust, Mia."
 
I smiled, feeling a sense of hope wash down my spine. 
 
"I also want that too, Ethan. Let's work on it together." I just don't know what I am saying, but I know I was trying to help the young man have hope in me. But then I just had to ask.
 
"Wait, Ethan?" 
 
" What!".
 
"So, you don't trust me."
 
"I do trust you, and I can possibly die for you plus do anything to make you and Alexander happy," I faked my smile to him.
 
"You are lying, young man." I disagreed with his words.
 
"Do you know you are weird?" He changed the topic of the discussion to something that he doesn't know if he could pick offense with or just laugh at.
 
"How dare you?" I questioned him, giving him a Stern look.
 
"I'm just trying to free my mind here since we both are the only ones here," he smirked.
 
"So what are you trying to say?" I asked rudely.
 
"Nothing, but you are just totally weird and strict to everyone." His words made me angry so quick.
 
"You know what?" I stretched my head, reaching his.
 
"You are angry and about to say something useless," he laughed.
 
"I just hate you," he laughed so hard.
 
"Do you think it funny at all?" I picked up a pillow with anger and threw it on him, not minding his reaction.
 
"Mia, you are so childish, and you have to change for good," he said with a serious look.
 
"who's advising me on adulthood." I just started to laugh out of control, too.
 
"Mia," he stood up also.
 
"Bro, you have to act like a man." I hit him hard on his shoulder like a normal guy would.
 
" Hmmm..." Before he could say anything else, the phone buzzed.
 
"Who is that?" I asked him as soon as he changed his face.
 
"Sophia," he replied.
 
"Okay, we would be there." Not quite long after he picked up the call, he said those words, keeping me in high fear already.
 
###chapter 37
Mia POV
 
"What's happening, Sophia?" As soon as Ethan and I walked into the office filled with cool air, the question just made its way out of his hole.
 
"Calm down," she said as she stood up quickly, her face filled with surprise at this point.
 
"You sounded much as if something was wrong," Ethan asked.
 
"Yes, something is more than wrong here, Mia, Ethan," she said, looking at us both with a weary face.
 
"Can you talk to us and keep us out of this suspense?" I said.
 
" Okay"
 
"Andrew sued Ethan for something that was strange and useless." This gave me a pale look quickly.
 
Andrew, whom I already started having pity for, had done more than he could possibly hold. Why would he sue Ethan this time? Why would he have to do something like that to Ethan? All because I choose Ethan over him.
 
"Mia, it's totally your fault," Ethan said, looking at me with a pale and weak voice.
 
"Do you know what to blame me for now?" I questioned.
 
"Why won't I do so?" His eyes were already pale red.
 
"Mia," he drew near to me, holding me by the arm.
 
"If he sued me over you, do you know that I would be dead?" The Thai statement made me laugh inside.
 
"Ethan, what are you talking about?" 
 
"He sued me, Mia, all because of you." His voice had already started breaking up at this point.
 
"Firstly, we don't know his reasons for suing you, so we can't just judge," I said, and Ethan looked at Sophia at this point.
 
"He sued you for trying to muder and pose a pose a life threat." My eyes opened wide hearing this statement.
 
"For real," Ethan asked with anger already.
*****
 
With what Sophia already said, I just felt like I had been punched in the gut, or rather stabbed in between my chest.
 
"Murder and life threats? That's absurd!" I exclaimed, my voice shaking with disbelief already. 
 
Ethan's face turned red, filledwith boiling anger, his eyes blazing with fury, and he was breathing so fast as if he were going through a hot race.
 
"How can he even sue me for that? I've never even raised a hand to him, nor had I tried hurting him!" He thundered, his voice scattering.
 
Sophia nodded vigorously , her expression incredulous and pity within it . But another thing that just hold me up in my head, how could she know about that when it hasn't been long I came home from Andrew place. 
 
This just made me think unstop.
 
"I know, right? It's like he's trying to frame you or something. This is ridiculous and very bad!" Sophia said with a calm tone.
 
I shook my head, trying to process the information in my head, trying to get things right at this point. 
 
"This is all because of me, isn't it? Andrew's trying to get back at me for choosing Ethan over him." I felt a wave of guilt wash over me, threatening to engulf me,I felt through my vein and regret already. Me knowing am putting someone into a huge issue just makes me really sad .
 
Ethan's expression turned grim, his jaw clenched in anger, grinning his teeth with a huge pace of anger.
 
"I'm afraid so, Mia. He's trying to destroy me, and he's using you as a pawn in his game to bring me down. But we're not going to let him get away with it. I promise to pay him back in a way that would hurt him."
 
I felt a surge of determination within me, my mind racing with thoughts of how to fight back at Andrew. But beneath that, I couldn't shake off the feeling of responsibility of keeping someone in big danger. I had never meant for things to escalate this far or never had I expected Andrew to come back trying to claim me as his ex lover.
 
After a few discussions with Sophia over the whole issue, myself and Ethan just had to leave the office to help Sophia prepare for how to save Ethan.
 
As we both left the office, I couldn't help but wonder what other tricks Andrew had up his sleeve. 
 
Was he going to stop at nothing to destroy Ethan just to get me back as his bride? The thought sent a shiver down my spine.
 
When we got home, I went straight to my mother's room, Madam Lucy, and told her everything that was happening in my life.
 
She listened attentively, her expression growing more and more concerned, showing pity for every pace of my statement.
 
"Mia, you have to be really careful," she said, her voice laced with worry and a huge sigh of pity. 
 
"Andrew's not a person to be trifled with. He's dangerous; he's cruel and heartless." She groaned.
 
I nodded, feeling a sense of fear creeping up my spine with my mother's words.
 
. "I know, Mother. But what can I do? He's already sued Ethan, and I don't know what else he's capable of doing."
 
Just then, Amanda walked into the room with her eyes stuck into her phone, a look of determination on her face as she raised it up.
 
She quickly raised her head and gave a quick glance at myself and my mother.
 
"Don't worry, Mia. I'll defend you and Ethan against Andrew's accusations. We'll get through this together as a family."
 
I immediately stood up after her short phrase to me.
 
"Please, I don't need you both in this matter; you both have done enough already," I said to them both.
 
"What do you mean, Mia?" My mom asked.
 
"Mom, you are the main reason why all this is happening now." I just couldn't hide my words from me already, so I had to spit them out.
 
"Mia, why would you blame Mother?" Amanda asked.
 
"Adam, watch your tongue, since you know you are in my house," I hissed before I walked closer to the door just to leave.
 
"A house that you never wanted to be in," Amanda said rudely.
###chapter 38
Mia POV
 
"Andrew, how dare you sue Ethan for murder?" My eyes are blazing with anger.
 
He looked at me, and we both looked at each other.
 
"Mia, I did that for us both," he smiled, making me laugh out loud at his statement.
 
"Andrew, I never loved you, and I can never love you," he interrupted.
 
"But we both loved each other when we started this."
 
"Ehh, Andrew, that our past, you can't drag our past into the present," I said with some look.
 
"Why do you keep saying it's our past, Mia?" he asked as he drew himself closer to me.
 
"Don't you dare," I said.
 
"What do you think I wanted to do?" he laughed.
 
"I just don't care about that, Andrew; all I want now is for you to bring down that court case," I said to him rudely.
 
"And I am trying to tell you that I can't possibly do what you ask of me, Mia," his hands going around my face as he said those words.
 
"Andrew, just know that I'm not going to let you bully me again," I said, my voice firm and aggressive. 
 
"I've done nothing wrong, and neither has Ethan. You're just trying to hurt us because you're jealous and you want me back in your life." I spat at him quickly after my words to him, which just made him look for anger.
 
Andrew's face turned red with a rage of raging anger at this apex point. 
 
"Jealous? You think I'm jealous of you and your precious lover, Ethan? You're the one who's jealous, Mia. You're jealous of the fact that I'm not afraid to fight for what I want; you are afraid that I would get you back into my life." He chuckled, adding some evil spice to his statement.
 
"I'm not afraid to fight for what I want either, Andrew," I said, my eyes locked on his with me grinning my teeth.
 
"And what I want is for you to leave us alone and give my new family peace."
 
Andrew sneered and sniffed at the same time.
 
"You're not going to get what you want, Mia. I'm going to make sure of it, and these are my words: ."
 
With those words, he turned and stormed out of the room, leaving me feeling shaken and angry at this point. I couldn't believe the nerve of that man and his newly formed attitude just to get me back into his life.
 
As I sat there for some time, trying to calm down, I heard a voice behind me, which snapped me out of my thinking. 
 
"Mia, are you okay?" It was Ethan. 
 
"How did he get me here?" I quickly asked myself.
 
I turned to him, feeling a wave of relief wash over me the second I set my eyes on him.
 
"Yeah, I'm fine," I said. "Just a little shaken up, and I would be better."
 
Ethan came over and sat down beside me with a smirk. 
 
"What actually happened?" he asked, his eyes full of concern for me.
 
I told him everything that had just happened with Andrew. Ethan listened intently, his face growing more and more angry. The rage of anger within him was clearly visible to anyone.
 
"Don't worry about all this, Mia," he said when I finished with his teeth also grinning.
 
"I'm going to take care of all this like a real man. Andrew's not going to bother us again, I promise you." I looked into his eyes with no words to him but just looking.
 
Then I just smiled, feeling grateful for Ethan's support at this point, but I am still not sure if Ethan could be able to fight Andrew. I know Andrew is a strong guy, and Ethan, on the other side, is just one cool and gentle young man.
 
"Thanks, Ethan. I don't know what I'd do without you at this point." I smilied.
 
Ethan put his arm around me and pulled me close to him. 
 
"You'll never have to find out, Mia. I'm here for you, always and forever."
 
We sat there in silence for a moment, enjoying each other's company and slowly taking away the old thoughts from our minds.
 
Then Ethan spoke up after a few minutes of open pleasure.
 
"Mia, I think I have an idea. Why don't we take a trip? Just the two of us and no one else. We can get out of here and forget about all this drama with Andrew and have some rest of mind." He smiled at me, saying these words.
 
I thought about it for a moment. It sounded like a great idea to me, and it would be great.
 
"HHmmmm" I reacted to him.
 
"So, what's your answer to this?" I continued to smile at this point with no reply.
 
"Maybe when we get home, I will give you my answer." I smiled.
 
"Okay, that's no problem." As soon as we both smiled over the issue, one of the enthusiastic waiters walked into the room.
 
"Sorry for interrupting, sir and ma'am, but the money you paid for here would soon expire," the female figure said with a bold smile on her face.
 
"Oh, sorry, I would pack up to leave." She nodded positively and walked away.
 
"You didn't make a full payment," Ethan curiously asked.
 
"Yes, I just paid for four hours and that 4k." I stood up quickly.
 
"Woah!" he exclaimed.
 
"Also, how did you find me?" I questioned, giving another kind of look.
 
"Oh, that's another story for another day; let's just leave," he said.
 
"Nope, it's always strange that you find me almost every time," I exclaimed.
 
"Okay, I track your phone." I laughed when he said the words.
 
" What!" 
 
"Can we leave now?" He groaned like a child.
 
###chapter 39
Mia POV
 
"Sophia, myself, and Ethan had finally had some thought and decided to avenge," I said.
 
"How do you want to do that when your court case is just next week?" Sophia replied.
 
"So quick?" Ethan said.
 
"Yes," Sophia replied. 
 
"So, you both have to think of something that could happen before the day," Sophia added.
 
"Okay," I said, taking a quick gulp down my throat.
 
"We want to sue him."
 
The room felt so slient after my words to Sophia; she just couldn't take her eyes off me, as if she had a crush on me. I looked at her with curiosity at this point and also gave her awkward chuckles just to make her look away, but still the tension was on the high side.
 
" Sophia!" I said calmly, just to snap her off the basic thinking aspect she had already engaged herself in.
 
"I'm just trying to examine you for a while," she continued her serious look while Ethan just laughed, and I looked to his own side.
 
"What's funny?" My question immediately helped to seize his laugh.
 
"Mia, we can't sue him when we already sued Ethan," she exclaimed.
 
"I know he sued Ethan." I drew myself closer to her, giving her the same look she once gave me.
 
"I want to sue him on the same day he wants to sue Ethan," she interrupted.
 
"Ohh," she paused briefly while I smirked at her. "Woah, good plan, but," I interrupted.
 
"Why is there a but there?" I asked.
 
"Nothing, but we have just a week for that, and we need evidence for any case before I can go ahead and sue him," she said.
 
"I think that can't be an issue," Ethan hoped.
 
,******
 
"We have plenty of evidence against Andrew. We can use the recordings of him threatening us and the documents he's been sending us from time to time."
 
"Exactly," I said, nodding in agreement with Ethan's word. 
 
"And we can also use the fact that he's been harassing us online. That's definitely not acceptable behavior for top figures like we both." I looked to Ethan, who also nodded to my words.
 
Sophia nodded, her expression serious and Stern. 
 
"I agree. We have a strong case against him already. But we need to make sure we have all our ducks in a row before we go to court for the main case."
 
"I quite understand," I said. "So what's the main plan?"
 
"Well," Sophia started still with her serious look, "first we need to gather all our evidence and organize it accordingly. Then we need to file the lawsuit and serve Andrew with the papers so he could meet us in court."
 
"Okay," I said, taking a deep breath within me.
 
"That sounds like a lot of work for us all. But I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make sure Andrew pays for what he's done to me and my Ethan, plus putting my child's life in huge danger." I exclaimed.
 
Ethan nodded in agreement with my words.
 
"Me too. Let's do this."
 
We all spent the rest of the day gathering evidence and organizing our case for the better.. 
 
Sophia was a huge help to us, and I was grateful for her expertise in her career.
 
As we worked tiredlessly, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement within me. We were finally taking action against Andrew and his wickedness, and I knew we were going to win him on this.
 
But as the day wore on, I started to feel a sense of unease once more. What if Andrew just didn't take the lawsuit seriously? What if he tried to retaliate against us? What if we lose?
 
I tried, pushed the thoughts aside, and focused on the task at hand. We were going to win this case, and Andrew was going to pay for what he'd done to me and my new family.
 
Finally, after hours of work and unrest, we were ready to file the lawsuit against Andrew. Sophia gave us a nod of approval, and we headed to the courthouse without waste of time.
 
As we walked in with me taking a deep breath, I felt a sense of determination within. We were doing this. We were taking a stand against Andrew and his bullying ways towards our lives.
 
We approached the front desk and began the process of filing the lawsuit against our rival. The clerk looked at us with a sympathetic expression after going through our report, and I could tell she was on our side already.
 
"Good luck with your court case," she said as she handed us the paperwork with a bold smile.
 
"Thanks, Deae," I said, smiling back at her.
 
"We're going to need it." I added
 
As we left the courthouse with high hopes, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. We had done it once. We had taken the first step towards bringing Andrew to justice and making us have peace.
 
But as we walked back to the car, I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease within, with questions running through my head unstop.
 
"What would Andrew do next?" I asked myself.
 
"Would he try to retaliate against us?" The questions couldn't just stop running through my head, the questions hitting against me.
 
I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on the present moment and the fact and the fact that we have made a step forward in bringing down Andrew. 
 
We had done something important today, and I was proud of us for taking a stand for our own lives.
 
As we drove home, Ethan turned to me with a serious expression and face.
 
"Mia, we need to be really careful. Andrew's not going to take this lying down." Ethan's eyes were fixed on the road, as he said.
 
"I know Ethan," I said, my heart racing unstop as if I were judging myself against what I just did.
 
"But we're in this together. We'll face whatever comes our way as  a couple." I smiled at the words.
 
Ethan nodded positively, his eyes locked on mine. 
 
"Together, as family," he said.
###chapter 40


 




Mia POV
 
"I hope you already submitted the court case to Andrew." Ethan walked into the room with his phone in the middle of his shoulder and ear.
 
Ethan's appearance was not like what I have seen in a long time; he wore his office dress, which was top-notch on him.
 
I walked closer to him, giving him a peck while I went to get my hair wax to apply to my hair before myself and him went to do our normal work as office workers.
 
"Thank you," he said as soon as he dropped the phone.
 
"Mia, do you in any way see my tie?" He asked slowly.
 
"Not really, but I saw Alexander walk in earlier; maybe he took it," Ethan smiled.
 
" Thanks" he walked out quickly.
 
Soon I was already done, so I picked up his phone and went straight to meet him at Alex's room.
 
"Let go now," I said as soon as I walked in.
 
"But mommy, I want to play with Daddy," Alex said.
 
"We are going to work late, young man." Ethan immediately came closer to me when I ignored Alexander, who gave a fragile look.
 
" But...." I interrupted Alexander.
 
"Alexander, you can play with Amanda or Grandma," I smiled at him.
 
"They are mean," I exhaled with a little smile.
 
I just didn't go ahead and say anything to him, but I just dragged Ethan by the arm down the stairs to the car.
 
" Mia.""He tried restricting his arms.
 
"Sometimes, you must learn how to say no to that boy." I stopped into the car as the driver locked the door quickly.
 
******
 
As soon as we arrived at work with positivity and settled into our office with high hopes, Andrew burst in again to ruin the day like he normally does, his face red with anger.
 
But this time, instead of meeting his anger with our own like before, we just decided to take a different approach.
 
"Andrew, what's going on?" I asked calmly, trying to understand the source of his frustration and early morning madness in public.
 
"You know exactly what's going on, Mia," Andrew snapped, his voice dripping with hostility and deep malice. 
 
"No, I don't know," I said.
 
"You sued me; that's what's going on here, Mia!" He exclaimed.
 
"I understand why you're upset, Andrew." Ethan intervened with his crazy chuckle, and after a while, his voice was soothing and calm. 
 
"But maybe we can talk about this like adults, rather than toddlers." Let's try to understand each other's perspectives and anger." Ethan said it with a serious look and little to no anger.
 
Andrew sneered, his expression twisted in disdain and the rage of raging anger. 
 
"Adults? You want to talk about this like adults? You're the ones who sued me, remember? You're the ones who are trying to ruin my reputation, my business, and my career." I just gave him a frown this time, with no words to interrupt his whole question.
 
"I know, Andrew," I said gently, trying to placate him so he understood what Ethan was trying to say. 
 
"But we had our reasons, just as you also had yours. You were harassing us without number, and we felt like we had no choice but to do what was best. We tried to talk to you about it, but you wouldn't listen, so we then did what we had to do." I smiled.
 
Andrew's voice rose again, his anger boiling over everything.
 
"Harassing you? I was just trying to get your attention, Mia. I didn't mean to scare you or anything. You're being too sensitive with your life." He exclaimed.
 
Ethan's voice remained firm but calm, a stark contrast to Andrew's escalating anger.
 
"Whatever your intentions were, Andrew, your actions were unacceptable to us. And that's why we sued you. We had to protect ourselves and our business." Ethan hoped in with a calm voice towards him while you laughed within me.
 
Andrew's eyes flashed with anger once more, and he took a step closer to us with his teeth grinning and his fists clenched.
 
"You're going to regret this, Mia," he growled, his voice low and menacing, filled with malice and hate.
 
"You're going to regret suing me. I'll make sure of it." He added.
 
I felt a shiver run down my spine at this point, but I stood my ground, not letting him intimidate me or refusing to back down.
 
"Andrew, I don't think you understand the situation," I said reasonably, trying to calm him down, but he still just behaves like a supreme that no one can bring down.
 
"Understand what?" He exclaimed with a high voice.
 
"Andrew, this is an office area, and it needs to be calm and free from noise," I said, taking a deep breath and holding my already-developing anger.
 
"Who cares?" He hissed and spat.
 
"Andrew, please don't let me call the security on you," Ethan said to him.
 
"Ethan Joshua and Mia Joshua, you both should stay clear from me and bring down that case now," he commanded as soon as he turned around, walking towards the door to the place.
 
"First, bring down ours, then we shall bring yours down," I said with my own voice.
 
"And if I didn't bring yours down, what's going to happen?" He turned back, coming closer to me.
 
I made a few steps, getting closer to him, with our eyes piercing into each other with mean looks.
 
"Then you have to dance to the music that will be played for you," I groaned and spat at him before I made a few steps backwards.
 
"Mia, you are so little for what I do." He said this to me with his annoying groan.
 
"Who cares?" I hissed at my words.
 
"Security," the two men behind me, walked up to Andrew with their mean faces.
 
"Take him out of this firm." "NNow!".
 
As they held his arms, I just made them stop and walk closer to him.
 
"One mistake you made as a human was to try to harm me and take away my peace." I said... "Now, you have just started the real fight, and I promise it won't end well.".
 




###chapter 41
Mia POV
 
"Ethan, we have two new ones, bad and the other good, so which should I start from?" I asked with a calm and smooth voice.
 
"Start with the bad one," he said as he made his way to sit beside me on the bed.
 
"Okay," I said, hiding my quick smirk.
 
"AAndrew, didn't take down the court case as we warned.".
 
"Not that bad since I have Sophia by my side." I just smiled to him, my heart racing with anxiety.
 
"Good news!" he screeched with excitement.
 
"He accepted the court case of next week," he just frowned.
 
"Why that face?" I asked him.
 
"How's that good news?" He asked rudely.
 
"It's good news; he accepted the court case," he exhaled.
 
"He must always come to the court case," he said, standing up.
 
******
 
"Okay, so Andrew didn't take down the court case as we warned him," I said, trying to sound calm and smooth while still going through my old statement. 
 
"And that's pretty bad." I said.
 
"No, it's not Mia," Ethan agreed, his expression serious.
 
"But we knew he might not listen to us both. That's why we actually have Sophia on our side." He said his voice was cracking as if it were a glitch.
 
"Exactly," I said, smiling to myself and thinking deep down.
 
"With Sophia's help and her on our side, we can handle whatever Andrew throws our way." He said.
 
"Good news!" Ethan suddenly exclaimed, his face lighting up with excitement, giving me a quick heart attack.
 
"He accepted the court case for next week!" He laughed.
 
I frowned at him, confusion etched on my face. "Why is that good news? And why this character?" I asked, giving her a werid look.
 
Ethan looked at me like I was crazy and weird. 
 
"Because he has to show up to court now! We can finally get this over with and have a little peace." Ethan said.
 
I shook my head, still not understanding this new expression toward me.
 
"But what if he tries to weasel his way out of it?" I asked.
 
Ethan stood up after my question, pacing back and forth across the room with thought. 
 
"He can't. He's already agreed to the court case. He has to show up now."
 
I sighed, feeling a sense of relief wash over me at this point, still thinking about the court case.
 
. "Okay, I guess that is good news."
 
Ethan stopped pacing and turned to me, a serious expression on his face as he attacked mine.
 
"We need to make sure we're prepared for this court case. We can't let Andrew get the upper hand over us." Ethan exclaimed.
 
"I know," I said, my mind already racing with strategies and ideas on how to deal with the rival. "Let's get to work." I added.
****
Over the next few days of our lives, Ethan and I worked tirelessly to prepare for the court case ahead of us both. 
 
We gathered evidence, practiced our arguments, and consulted with Sophia to make sure we were ready for anything that would show up that day and anything Andrew might throw our way.
 
Finally, the day of the court case arrived, and all of us were filled with anxiety and fear.
 
I was nervous but confident as we made our way to the courtroom, with all the things running through my head over and over again. 
 
Andrew was already there, his smug expression making my blood boil with anger and determination.
 
But I didn't let it get to me and keep me down. I took a deep breath, stood up straight, and faced the judge with confidence and high hopes.
 
"Let's do this," I whispered to Ethan quickly with a Stern appearance, my heart pounding in my chest as if I got involved in a huge fight.
 
"Let's do this," he whispered back, his eyes locked on mine with a huge smirk.
 
The judge banged his gavel hard on his table, and the court case began quickly.
 
As the judge called the court to order with my heart racing, I felt a sense of calm wash over me, which gave me hope and made my nervous system active.
 
I knew we had done everything we could to prepare for this day. Now it was time to see justice served in the right place.
 
Andrew's lawyer stood up, looking at mine with a rude face and a smug expression on his face that made me hate him quickly. .
 
"Your Honor, my client is innocent of all charges laid against him."
 
I rolled my eyes arrogantly. That was literally expected from the lawyer.
 
Sophia stood up, clearing her throat, her expression confident and serious. 
 
"Your Honor, we have evidence that proves Andrew's guilt of the charge. We request that the court take this evidence into consideration." Sophia said it with a serious and unfriendly look.
 
The judge nodded slowly, his expression serious as well. 
 
"Very well. Let's hear the evidence you have."
 
And with that, the court case began, making the tension thicker.
 
I was nervous but confident as Sophia presented our case to the judge. I knew we had done everything we could to prepare.
 
Now it was time to see justice served to those who deserved it.
 
As the court case continued with everyone's hearts racing, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride within. We had worked so hard to get to this point. And now, finally, we were seeing justice served to the man.
 
The judge banged his gavel towards an ending, and the court case came to a close. 
 
I felt a sense of relief wash over me as the judge read out the verdict, which was positive.
 
"Andrew, you are hereby found guilty of all charges laid against you. You are sentenced to pay a fine and serve community service."
 
I looked at Sophia and Ethan, who were also as happy as I was.
 
I smiled, feeling a sense of vindication within, but couldn't let it out. We had done it finally. We had finally seen justice served to the rival.
 
As we left the courtroom with Joy, Ethan turned to me happily, a huge grin on his face and excitement in his eyes.
 
"We did it, Mia. We actually did it. We actually had peace of mind. 
 
I smiled back at him, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over me.
 
"We sure did, Ethan." 
 
###chapter 42
Mia POV
 
After the court case between the whole family and the victory, I just couldn't take away the happiness within myself. I just can't wash away the large anxiety within me and over me.
 
"Wow, Mia, I am so proud of you," my mom said, giving me a hug quickly with a bold smile.
 
"We would have our own peace for now," I said, still with a hug to my mother.
 
The hug lasted for a few seconds before we both just had to separate with a bold smile on everyone's face.
 
"This calls for a victory party," Ethan said with a lot of laughter deep down within him.
 
 
*******
 
I could still remember as we walked out of the courtroom after the whole issue.
 
At that point i couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment wash me . We had done it. We had finally seen justice served.
 
My mom came over to me with a bold smile and a huge smile on her face.
 
"Wow, Mia, I'm so proud of you," she said, giving me a tight hug that was so warm.
 
I hugged her back tightly, feeling so happy and feeling a sense of relief wash over me.
 
"We would have our own peace for now," I said, smiling with happiness within my heart.
 
The hug lasted for a few seconds before we separated afterwards, both of us still grinning from ear to ear with a smirk that just couldn't fade out.
 
Ethan came over to us happily, a huge smile on his face. 
 
"This calls for a victory party!" he exclaimed, his eyes shining with excitement and gratitude.
 
 
******
 
I laughed happily, feeling a sense of joy that I hadn't felt in a long time. 
 
"Definitely," I said, nodding in agreement with what Ethan said in the room.
 
We all decided to go to a nearby restaurant to celebrate our win. 
 
As we walked in, the hostess greeted us with a bold smile.
 
"Congratulations on your victory!" she said, leading us to a table that could contain us all as a family.
 
We ordered our food and drinks, and as we waited for them to arrive, we chatted and laughed, still on a high from the court case that happened much earlier.
 
When the food arrived, we dug in and chatted with each other, savoring the delicious flavors of the nice food.
 
I had a huge smile on my face as I looked around the table at my loved ones enjoying themselves, but Amanda's smile just faded for a while and came back, but I just didn't take that to heart.
 
We talked and laughed some more as a family, enjoying each other's company and words. 
 
It was a much-needed celebration after all the stress and anxiety of the court case and our win over the main rival of our lives.
 
As we finished up and prepared to leave, Ethan raised his glass of exculsive wine. 
 
"To justice being served!" he toasted to it all.
 
We all clinked our glasses together and took a sip, smiling at each other, which finally turned into huge laughter among us all.
 
As we all left the restaurant, I felt a sense of peace wash over me this time.
 
We had done it finally. We had finally seen justice served to whom it belonged.
 
And as we walked away from the restaurant with smiles, arm in arm, I knew that we would always have each other's backs at this rough point, no matter what happened to any of us.
 
The party continued at home with no stop of enjoyment, with music and dancing and plenty of food and drink.
 
It was a night to remember, a night to celebrate our victory and our love for each other, a night to show love to each other.
 
As the night went on, we took photos and made memories that would last a lifetime in our eyes and hearts.
 
It was a night that I would always treasure forever, a night that would stay with me forever and never be forgotten.
 
And as I looked around at my loved ones who were happy, I knew that we would always have each other, no matter what. 
 
We had been through so much together as a new family, and we had come out stronger on the other side by just sharing quite the love.
 
The party went late into the night, but I didn't want it to end. I was having so much fun, too much joy, and too much happiness that I even forgot about my past.
 
But eventually, we can't cheat nature, so it was time to say goodnight to each other. We hugged each other tightly, still grinning from ear to ear.
 
"Thank you for this night," I said, my voice filled with emotion and my face filled with a bold smirk.
 
"Anytime," Ethan replied, smiling back at me. "We deserve it after all we've been through just to gain peace." He kept his expression neutral with his smile.
 
And with that, we went to bed, our hearts full of joy and our spirits lifted. We had done it. We had finally seen justice served, but as my head lay on the pillows, I could feel Ethan up already, and this made me look towards him.
 
"What is it?" I questioned sitting up.
 
"It's my father," his face look just changed immediately.
 
"What about him?" I asked, drawing myself closer to him.
 
"His sickness is just wearing me out." I placed my palm on his chest area, which made him look at me before going ahead to continue his statement.
 
"Things would be okay, Ethan," I said with a pity-filled voice.
 
"He should be part of us celebrating our victory," he exclaimed, sniffing.
 
"Ethan, everything would be okay, I promise, I said to him while he just looked at me as if she wanted to cry already.
 
"Let go to sleep." After a peck on his cheek, we both placed our heads on the pillows and went to sleep, not planning for the next day nor thinking about what might be up for us.

###chapter 43
Ethan POV
 
I woke up early the next morning, feeling a sense of unease wash through me, and it was something strange for me. 
 
I had been dreaming about my dad's illness lately and how it was affecting him so badly. 
 
Quickly, I got out of bed and went to his room without checking up on others's, hoping to find him awake and feeling better already, since it had been quite a while since we had a talk.
 
As I entered his room with a deep breath, I saw him sitting up in bed, looking pale and weak to me. 
 
I sat down next to him and took his hand in mine, along with a friend of his.
 
"Hey, Dad," I said, trying to sound cheerful to him and trying to wash away my own sad and frowny look. 
 
"How are you feeling today?" I asked the pale, middle-aged man.
 
He looked at me with sunken eyes and shook his head positively. 
 
"I'm not doing well, son," he said, his voice weak and raspy to me, which made my heart almost pull out.
 
"I'm so proud of you and Mia for winning the court case earlier, but I'm a little bit afraid I won't be able to celebrate with you on that achievement." He struggled to say the words.
 
I felt a pang of sadness within me and squeezed his hand, giving him my expression of sadness.
 
"Don't worry about all that, Dad," I said to him with pain hanging in my throat. 
 
"We'll celebrate when you're feeling better, Dad. What's important is that you get rest, take care of yourself, and heal fast for us all." I said.
 
He nodded and smiled weakly at me.
 
. "I'm trying, son, I'm trying. But it's hard when I see you and Mia going through so much stress. I want to be there for you and Mia, but my body won't let me do so."
 
I felt a lump in my throat and swallowed hard, not wanting to review it.
 
"You're always there for us, Dad," I said with a smile. 
 
"Even when you're not physically present, your love and support mean the world to us, and this keeps me encouraged in high hopes of you getting better." I smiled.
 
He looked at me with tears hanging from his eyes and smiled again at me. 
 
"Thank you, son. That means a lot to me, and it would keep me fit." He said.
 
We sat there in silence for a moment, our eyes blazing against each other's, holding hands while enjoying each other's company. Then, I remembered something important.
 
"Dad, I actually need to tell you something," I said, my voice serious but my face playful.
 
"Andrew was in the courtroom yesterday. I don't know what he wants, but I don't trust him, and I think he's trying to pay back since we won him." I said to my dad.
 
My dad's expression turned grave and calm, and he nodded slowly.
 
"I know, son. I've been getting some strange messages from him too. We need to be careful and stay vigilant against him," my dad just imputed fear in me.
 
I nodded in agreement, and we talked some more about Andrew and what we could do to protect ourselves from him. 
 
After a while, my dad started to get tired already, so I helped him settle back into bed and promised to check on him later in the day with the other family.
 
As I left his room soon, I felt a sense of determination within.
 
I would do everything in my power to protect my family and make sure we were all safe.
 
"Ethan." I turned back as soon as I heard my name.
 
"Hey, Amanda," she said, drawing herself closer to me with a smirk.
 
"Hi, please, where's my sister?" She asked as she acted strangely toward me.
 
"In the room, of course," I said, trying to understand her main intention.
 
" Amanda!" She tried to come closer to me with her seductive dress.
 
"Sorry, I'm just reacting to the drink from last night," she said, adjusting back.
 
"Okay," I said as I walked out of her with no words but just trying to think of what she wanted. Since she's acting strangely, I just have to believe she's reacting to the alcohol from the party.
 
"Why wouldn't dad just get healed fast and live his normal life?" I asked myself as I walked into the open space of the large villa.
 
I took my pace up and down, thinking about how I could save my dad from all this that had gotten him. He is the only one that I have had since my mom died, despite my love for my son and Mia, but you still loved my dad and could do anything for him to make sure he lives and has a good life.
 
###chapter 44
Mia POV
 
"Why does your sister act so weird?" As Ethan walked into my office, he threw the question up to me.
 
"Why asking?" I looked at him.
 
"She's your sister; why am I asking?" He raised an eyebrow.
 
" She's my sister but she's so hidden to everyone,so I barely know much about her" i said sticking my eyes back into the laptop.
 
" Mia,why don't we get them another place to stay instead of them staying with us ?" He sat on my table with him looking at me while I just ignore his presence.
 
"That total is a waste of money when you have a big villa that is empty with absolutely no one there," I sighed, resting my back on the chair.
 
Ethan raised an eyebrow once more, clearly not satisfied with my former response to him.
 
 
"That's not an answer, Mia. What's going on with your sister?" He asked, his voice firm but totally gentle and calm.
 
I sighed, giving an exhale also, trying to brush him off.
 
"Ethan, I don't know what you're talking about, like seriously. My sister is totally fine." I tried to sound convincing, but I knew I wasn't fooling anyone here.
 
But Ethan wasn't having it, still not believing me.
 
He got up from the table and walked over to my chair slowly, spinning it around to face him. 
 
"Mia, I know something is going on. I've seen the way she acts towards me, always hiding in her room, never wanting to talk to anyone but her phone and her mother. What's going on with her, Mia?" He asked, his eyes searching mine for answers, but I truly don't know what to say to him.
 
I tried to look away since I have no answer, but Ethan's eyes held mine quickly, refusing to let me escape. 
 
I knew I just couldn't keep it from him forever, but I wasn't ready to reveal the truth yet to him since we just got our own little peace.
 
"Ethan, I... I don't know what you're really talking about," I stammered, trying to come up with an excuse to set myself free from his obsession.
 
But Ethan wasn't having it at all. He leaned in closer, his face inches from mine, just to get an answer.
 
"Mia, I know you're hiding something away from me. Tell me what's going on with your sister, and nothing bad can happen." He said with a smirk
 
I felt a huge surge of panic rise up within me. I didn't know what to say or how to get out of this situation already, but I just had to keep quiet in the meantime.
 
Just then, with thoughts going through my little brain, the phone rang, breaking the tension in the room and giving me some time to think. 
 
Ethan's eyes quickly narrowed as he picked up the receiver. 
 
"Hello?" He said calmly.
 
He just listened for a moment before his expression changed from curiosity to concern to pain. 
 
"What? " He stammered with anxiety.
 
"Okay, I'll be right there now; please wait." He said as I felt a huge surge of panic within.
 
He hung up the phone and turned to me quickly. 
 
"Who was that?" I curiously asked with goosebumps on my skin.
 
 
"That was my dad's assistant calling." He said it with a serious look.
 
"He needs me to come to the mansion right away." Ethan said with the same expression.
 
I raised an eyebrow, wondering what was going on that caused the urgent call.
 
"What's happening?" I asked, feeling a sense of unease wash me.
 
Ethan shook his head with a sigh also.
 
"I don't actually know, but I have to go now to go check." He said adjusting his suit.
 
" Will you come with me?" He asked as I sat more comfortable on the chair.
 
I hesitated for a few moment before nodding positively, giving him my answer..
 
"Yes," I said, standing up.
 
"Can we go now?" He asked as soon as I stood up.
 
"Wait," I had to adjust my own dress and pick up my other items since I knew I wouldn't be back in the office.
 
"Okay, let's go."
 
As we drove to the mansion area, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off and wrong. 
 
And when we arrived at the huge mansion, I knew that my instincts had been right already.
 
The mansion was in a huge chaos, with people running around and shouting as if a protest was being held there.
 
My mother was pacing back and forth in the living room, looking worried, keeping me in quick tension.
 
"What's going on?" Ethan asked, rushing over to my mother.
 
But before my mother could answer, a loud noise echoed through the room, making us all turn around with anxiety.
 
And that's when I saw her, standing in the doorway, a look of shock on her face , which also caused a shook to me.
 
"Amanda," I whispered.
 
She looked like she had seen a ghost or a zombie, her eyes wide with fear and anxiety.
 
"Madam Lucy, what's going on?" Ethan asked, turning to my mother for answers.
 
But she just didn't know what to say. She was just as shocked as everyone else in the room.
 
After a few minutes of tension, everything went black before my eyes.
 
When I came to, I was lying on the floor, Ethan's face hovering above me.
 
"Mia, are you okay?" He asked, his voice filled with concern and pity for me, who was also concerned about how I reached the floor.
 
I nodded slowly, still trying to process what had just happened to me and why I was lying on the floor.
 
But before I could say anything else, my sister appeared above me, her eyes still wide with fear and anxiety, just like before.
 
"Mia, I...I have something to tell you," she stammered, keeping me in fear.
 
Before shecould say anything again to me, everything went black again.
 
This time, I didn't know if I would ever wake up or if I would die afterwards.
###chapter 45
Mia POV
 
"What the fuck am I doing here?" I tried sitting up, but I was so pale and weak.
 
My left stomach hurt so bad while I tried to get up. The sharp pain made me sit back on the bed with a pale expression.
 
Looking around, I was surrounded with family members, with me wearing a hospital green dress.
 
"What's happening?" I tried screaming, but the more I talked, the more my stomach hurt me more and more. 
 
"You have to rest," Ethan said.
 
"Where's my Alexander?" I quickly asked with my eyes scanning through the entire room.
 
"His safe," I interrupted.
 
"Where?" I asked.
 
"Home," I felt relieved already with the reply.
 
The tension in the room was so much already; everyone was looking with anxiety, while my sister bowed her head, not trying our eyes to cling.
 
"So, why am I here?" I asked to break in the silence.
 
"You can't tell now," said my mom as she drew herself closer to me.
 
"Why?" I questioned.
 
*********
 
I pressured the whole family to speak up, but they didn't just say a word to me. 
 
They just looked at each other nervously, avoiding eye contact with me while they kept me in the dark. 
 
The tension in the room was fully palpable, and I could feel my frustration growing by the second, since there wasn't anything they were telling me.
 
"Tell me what's truly going on here!" I demanded with a medium screech, trying to sit up again despite the pain in my stomach.
But still, no one said anything to me.
 
My sister still had her head bowed looking to the floor, and my mom just shook her head with a sigh.
 
I glared at them all, trying to will them into speaking. But they just looked at me with sad eyes, still keeping me in the dark, and I knew that something was very wrong.
 
Just as I was about to give up on my query, Amanda spoke up immediately.
 
"Mia, I have something to tell you," she said, her voice barely above a whisper, with her head still facing down.
 
I looked at her, expecting her to reveal some deep secret to me. But what she said next shocked me to my core and just made me feel more bad and pain deep.
 
"You ate... I mean, I thought it was food, but it was rat killer," she said, her eyes welling up with tears and emotions.
 
"I was just trying to make breakfast for you, Mia, and I accidentally grabbed the wrong package. I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to hurt you." Tears dripped down from her eyes slowly.
 
I felt like I had been punched in the gut or stabbed through the chest with a dagger.
 
"What? Why?" I asked, trying to process what I had just heard from Amanda's.
 
Amanda started sobbing so hard, and my mom rushed over to comfort her with her nice words. 
 
"Mia, you just have to rest," Ethan said, trying to calm me down also while I boil within.
 
"We'll talk about this sometime later." Ethan added.
 
But I was having none of it at this point. I needed answers to my query, and I needed them now and no time else. 
 
"No, tell me what's going on here!" I shouted, despite the pain in my stomach.
 
But no one said anything else to me. They just looked at me with sad eyes, and I knew that something was very wrong again.
 
Questions ran through my head. "When did Amanda start making breakfast?" I asked myself as the sharp pain started again.
 
"Amanda, how could you be so careless?" I asked, trying to keep my anger in check just to prevent another pain.
 
Amanda just shook her head, still sobbing so hard. 
 
"I don't know, Mia. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you or do something that would kill." She sniffed at the end of her statement.
 
I took a deep breath and exhaled, trying to calm my nerves. 
 
But I couldn't shake the feeling of betrayal within. My own sister had almost killed me, and no one had told me anything, nor  did she warn.
 
"Why didn't anyone tell me about this?" I asked, looking around the room with anger.
 
My mom just shook her head slowly.
 
"We didn't want to worry you, Mia. We thought you had enough to deal with already, so we called Ethan." She said.
 
But I didn't want to be protected from the hard truth. I wanted the real truth.
 
"Tell me everything, mother," I said, my voice firm and gentle.
 
And finally, they started talking. They told me about Amanda's mistake in making the breakfast and how they had rushed me to the hospital after I fainted twice. 
 
They told me about the rat killer that was mistakenly set in the kitchen and how it had almost killed me after eating the food Amanda made.
 
I listened to them, my heart heavy with emotion pudding. I couldn't believe what had happened to me. But I knew I had to forgive Amanda.
 
"Amanda, when did you start making breakfast?" I questioned.
 
"Quite not too long," she said.
 
"But how did the rat killer get into the kitchen?" My head was filled with different questions that I couldn't wait to deliver.
 
"I don't know," she just kept on crying so badly.
 
" Ethan!" I turned to him.
 
" What!" He gave a curious look.
 
"You have two things you haven't done for me yet, and you have to do that now," I said.
 
"What that?" 
 
"We have to take them packing!" 
###chapter 46
Mia POV
 
"How do you expect me to trust that kind of person again?" 
 
"But she said it was a mistake." Ethan just kept on saying words that make me think otherwise.
 
"What kind of mistake is that?" I asked rudely.
 
"No one is perfect," he said.
 
" Perfect! Perfect,you say," I hissed.
 
"Putting poison in my dish, and you call that a mistake." I just kept up hissing on every one of my statements.
 
"She didn't plan for that," I interrupted.
 
"Can't she smell?" I asked. 
 
"Can't you taste?" 
 
"Are you on my side or on her own side?" I questioned sitting up immediately, despite the pain.
 
"On no one side," he said.
 
"But... " He interrupted my words.
 
"You got to have a forgiving spirit.".
 
*****
 
I glared at Ethan, my anger boiling over with his words.
 
"You're just making excuses for her, right?" I spat to his words.
 
"She tried to kill me, Ethan. My own blood sister." I couldn't believe he was defending her after what she had done to me, after faking her words. I have known her for almost 20 years, and I know what she is literally capable of doing.
 
Ethan held up his hands, trying to placate me. 
 
"Mia, please. Just listen to me. Amanda is sorry for her bad action. She didn't mean to hurt you." But I wasn't having it at all. I was beyond reason.
 
"Sorry? Sorry isn't enough at all for what she did. She could have killed me if I wasn't rushed in here," I repeated, my voice rising with anger. 
 
I just couldn't believe he didn't understand the severity of the situation at hand.
 
Just then, the door to my hospital room opened, and Amanda walked in with a pityful look with Alexander by her side.
 
My anger surged again with just setting my eyes on her, and I felt my heart racing and pounding. 
 
"How dare she show her face here?" I asked myself.
 
"Get her out of here now," I demanded of her, pointing at Amanda as we made a few steps in the room.
 
I didn't want to see her face, didn't want to talk to her, or have anything to do with her.
 
But Ethan just shook his head, turning to me.
 
"Mia, please calm down. Just talk to her like sisters." He was still trying to defend her even when I warned about that, still trying to make excuses for her.
 
I turned my gaze on Amanda quickly, my eyes blazing with anger and frustration.
 
"You have absolutely nothing to say to me," I hissed. 
 
"You've done enough damage already." I couldn't believe she had the nerve to come here to try to apologize to me after keeping my life hanging.
 
Amanda looked down, tears streaming down her face like one little baby.
 
"Mia, I'm so... so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you or anything. I love you like a sister." But I just laughed, a bitter sound from me.
 
"You love me? You call hanging my life, love?" I repeated with a mean lokm, my voice dripping with sarcasm and anger. She didn't know the meaning of the word she said.
 
Alexander took a step forward to me, his eyes worried also.
 
"Mom, please. Just listen to Amanda." But I shook my head with a sigh, my anger hurt too much to bear alone.
 
"Get them both out of here," I demanded, turning my back on themball. I couldn't take it anymore.
 
Ethan sighed and stood up, ushering Amanda and Alexander out of the room. But I knew this wasn't over yet. Not by a long shot, nor by a short one.
 
As soon as they were gone, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me quickly.
 
I was tired of the whole drama, tired of the pain and suffering. I just wanted to be left alone for a while.
 
But I knew that wasn't possible. Not now, not ever.
 
"Ethan," I turned to look at him.
 
"You are cruel, Mia," he said with dripping anger.
 
"Is that what you have to tell me now?" I asked.
 
"How could you even do that to your child, sending him out of the ward?" His eyes were filled with anger.
 
"He's a little boy, and that isn't a problem," he kept on attacking my words as if it were a huge fight.
 
"You say it's not a problem, keeping that little boy crying outside because his mother just took him as a less important human being." Ethan was fully filled with anger already, and this just made me more pale that I have fewer words to say.
 
" Ethan..." He interrupted, his voice filled with fury.
 
"Let me complete my words." He exclaimed with rage of raging anger.
 
"You should have just forgiven her and given her another chance," I interrupted him.
 
"By chance, do you know what I have passed through in the hands of that lady I call a sister?" I groaned.
 
"That's your past, Mia; everyone has their own past, and you can't use your past to judge your own future," he said, bringing himself closer to me.
 
"And so she hated me," he interrupted once more.
 
"Sold you out," I glanced at him awkwardly.
 
"You say that same line every time, Mia. Mia, you have to really change for the better" he picked up his phone.
 
"Ethan," he turned around to walk out.
 
"I have other issues to take care of, Mia, and a child plus in-law to take home and plead with," he walked out of me.
###chapter 47
Attention, dear readers. Sorry, but there would be two different points of view (POV)) in this ###chapter. Just warning not to get you confused.
 
 
Enjoy your time here.
 
*****
 
Ethan POV
 
I pace through in the sitting room with thoughts running through my head, but you just couldn't get answers to what I was thinking about.
 
"Daddy, when would mommy come back?" Little Alexander snapped me off my thinking island.
 
I looked at him for a while, trying to process what he just said to me.
 
"Dad, are you alright?" he came closer to me, hitting me by the thigh.
 
"Yes, son, just thinking about some things," I said with a fake smile to the little boy.
 
"What?" he questioned.
 
" How to set a surprise for your mom" Amanda said to the young boy who already got excited.
 
"Woah," he reacted with a look filled with surprise.
 
"I have to go tell Tom about this," he quickly ran off the sitting room immediately.
 
"Whose Tom?" I asked.
 
"That's his teddy name," I sighed as I got the answer that helped to treat my curiosity.
 
I returned back to my pace in the room with thought for some seconds; soon I just had to speak up.
 
" Amanda," I walked closer to her with a smile.
 
"What?" she asked politely.
 
"Why does Mia act strange?" I asked.
 
" Hi" she chucked.
 
"Why is it hard for her to forgive someone?" I asked.
 
" I quite don't know actually"
 
 
Amanda shrugged, looking thoughtful. While.
 
"I think it's because she's been hurt so many times before and in her past. She has a hard time trusting people." Amanda said.
 
I nodded, understanding her answers. 
 
"That makes total sense. But what about you? Why did you...?" I trailed off, not wanting to bring up the painful topic once again and remembering something odd.
 
Amanda looked down, her eyes welling up with tears and agony already. 
 
"I don't actually know, Ethan. I was so... So stupid. I didn't mean to hurt her nor do anything bad to her. I truly love her."
 
I put a hand on her shoulder with me saying some words just trying to comfort her. 
 
"I know you do, Amanda. And I know Mia loves you too as a sister. She's just... hurt right now, and her brain cells are down," I said.
 
Amanda nodded sniffing, taking a deep breath in and out. 
 
"I know. I just wish there was something I could do to make it right and make her forgive me." She said as tears dropped down her eyes.
 
I smiled, trying to reassure her and trying to get a smile on her face. 
 
"Just give her some time, okay? She'll come around eventually and forget all." I kept my smirk permanent.
 
Just then as Amanda tried to wear a smile, Alexander ran back into the room with his own huge smile and, his teddy bear Tom clutched tightly in his arms. 
 
"Dad, can we set up the surprise now for mom?" he asked, bouncing up and down excitedly with a huge smile.
 
I laughed slowly, ruffling his hair as if his a little puppy. 
 
"Not yet, buddy. But soon, okay?" I smiled giving him false hope.
 
He nodded, still bouncing with excitement and joy. "Okay dad!"
 
As I watched him, I couldn't help but feel a sense of hope within and alao guilt. 
 
Maybe, just maybe, we could get through this after all and have a permanent peace.
 
******** [Mia POV/hospital scene]
 
"Mia, don't he be so rude and watch your tongue?" My mother said with a low voice to me.
 
"But, mother, she tries to kill me," I said also in the same tone.
 
"Mia, it was a mistake, and she had begged you," my mother said with a frustrated look.
 
"I can't accept that." I said.
 
"Mia, I totally don't know you like this; you were this young girl that had a heart of gold and forgive quickly.".
 
"Mom, you made me like this, so don't blame me," I said rudely.
 
"What do you mean?" She questioned.
 
"Do you want us to prolong the whole issue?" I questioned her, also giving a serious expression to her while she just glanced at me with tiredness.
 
" Hiss" she said.
 
"You just have to forgive your sister," she said, picking up her things as she also stood up.
 
"Why now, lord?" I questioned.
 
" What?!" She questioned.
 
" Nothing,but it seem like an hard task to accomplish".
 
My mother sighed shortly, shaking her head.
 
"Mia, you're being so stubborn. Amanda has apologized and begged for your forgiveness countless times. What more do you want from her?"
 
I crossed my arms, feeling a surge of anger within. 
 
"I want her to understand that what she did was totally wrong. I want her to know that she can't just try to kill me and then expect everything to go back to normal, or expect I to forgive her with just 5 words."
 
My mother's expression softened this tiwe, and she reached out to put a hand around my arm. 
 
"Mia, I know you're so hurt deep down. But holding onto this anger isn't going to help you. You need to let go and forgive Amanda for what she did."
 
I pulled my arm away from hers, feeling a lump down my throat.
 
"I don't know if I can, mother," I said, my voice barely above a whisper this time.
 
My mother's face fell quickly, and she looked at me with disappointment on her face.
 
"Mia, I thought you were stronger than this. I thought you had more compassion down in you." She exclaimed.
 
I felt a sting from her words that touched me, and I looked away, trying to hold back tears and form a strong woman.
 
Just then, after my mother's words, the door to my hospital room opened widely, and Ethan walked in, followed by Alexander and Amanda. 
 
I felt a quick surge of anger at seeing Amanda walking in, and I looked away, trying to compose myself and not let anger eat me up.
 
"Mia, we totally need to talk," Ethan said, his voice firm but calm.
 
I nodded positively, still looking away.
 
. "What is it, Ethan?"
 
Ethan took a deep breath before saying his words out.
 
"Amanda has something to say to you. And I think you should listen to her this time." 
 
I turned to look at Amanda, who was standing nervously in the doorway with visible fear.
 
She looked like she was about to cry, and for a moment, I felt a pang of guilt within, all because of her expression.
 
But then I remembered what she had done to me, and my anger returned.
 
. "What could she possibly have to say that would make a difference here?" I spat with anger.
 
Amanda took a step forward to me, her eyes welling up with tears already. 
 
"Mia, I... I don't know what to say to you. I just know that I'm sorry for my actions. I was so stupid, and I didn't mean to hurt you at all. Please, can you forgive me?"
 
###chapter 48
Mia POV
 
It already passed a few weeks since the peacemaking in the hospital, and I am already tired of saying in the hospital, "Bedridden, so I had to meet the doctor to discharge me, but Ethan was needed before that could happen. 
 
Ethan came already, and I just can't wait for him to break the news for me that I would be going home and not longer staying in the hospital anymore.
 
I just can't wait to get back to my normal life and have a few days of peace and quiet as a normal human being that God made me to be.
 
******
 
As I lay down in the hospital bed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness wash over me. The past few weeks have been there.
 
The past few weeks had been a blur of beeping machines, sterile smells, and endless streams of visitors walking in and out. 
 
I was tired of being confined to this small, white room with its drab walls and flickering fluorescent lights that can scare a little baby.
 
I yearned for the freedom to walk outside to the normal life, to feel the warm sun on my skin, and to breathe in the fresh air of nature.
 
To smell the sweet scent of blooming flowers and not bouquet and feel the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze, and not that if the air conditioner.
 
Ethan's arrival was a welcome distraction from my thoughts immediately. 
 
He walked into the room with a gentle smile on his face, his eyes crinkling at the corners with excitement.
 
His hair was totally mussed, and his clothes were fully rumpled, but he looked handsome nonetheless from his new appearance, which was totally strange to me. 
 
I couldn't help but feel a flutter in my chest as he approached me on the bed.
 
He moved with a quiet confidence in him, which was fully visible; his eyes locked on mine with a smirk on our faces.
 
"Hey," he said, his voice low and soothing to the ears.
 
 
"How are you feeling today?" He asked.
 
I shurrged, feeling a sense of frustration wash over me. 
 
"I'm tired of being stuck in this bed morning, afternoon, and night," I admitted to the truth.
 
"I really want to go home," I added.
 
Ethan's smile faltered, and he looked at me with concern on his face.
 
"I know you want to go home," he said to me.
 
"But you have to be really patient. The doctor will let you know when it's safe for you to leave here and have your life." He smiled back.
 
The doctor followed closely behind him. Interrupting us both with a clipboard clutched in his hand
 
. He looked like a middle-aged man on a mission, his eyes scanning the pages with a sense of purpose and determination.
 
I watched anxiously as he began to scan the pages one after the other, not leaving any page unturned with, his brow furrowed in concentration.
 
Finally, he looked up to us both, a small smile playing on his lips already. 
 
"Mia, you're doing remarkably well from what we planned," he said, his voice warm and reassuring, which also gave me little happiness within. 
 
"We think it's time for you to go home now." He smiled, and this made me happier.
 
I felt a surge of excitement at his words that just made me giggle within. 
 
"Home".
 
The word was like a balm to my weak soul.
 
I just couldn't wait to leave this place behind and start rebuilding my own life.
 
I thought about my cozy little room, with its plush couch and soft blankets on the bed. I thought about my little garden, with its vibrant flowers and fresh herbs that help my day.
 
Ethan's hand closed around mine, his fingers intertwining with mine in a gentle grasp and smirk. 
 
I felt a sense of comfort and security wash over me as he squeezed my hand against his.
 
"We'll get you packed up and ready to go in a few minutes," the doctor said, his voice fading into the background while I was filled with so much happiness and joy already.
 
My mind was already racing ahead of what the mansion would look like, thinking about all the things I would do once I got home.
 
I would take long walks in the park, feel the sun on my face once more, and spend hours curled up with a good book and food. I would cook my favorite meals and spend time with my son, Alexander.
 
As the doctor finished speaking to us both, Ethan leaned forward, his eyes shining with excitement and happiness also.
 
"We can go home now, Mia," he whispered, his breath tickling my ear slowly.
 
I nodded happily, a smile spreading across my own face.
 
I was ready to start my new life and free from the confines of the hospital. 
 
I was ready to start living again like a normal human and not like one tied person.
 
With Ethan's help, I slowly swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood up happily, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. 
 
I was weak and unsteady at first, but I was determined to take control of my own life.
 
. Ethan wrapped his arm around my waist romantically, holding me close as we made our way out of the hospital room.
 
The bright sunlight was blinding as we both stepped outside, but I felt a sense of joy wash over me already. I was finally free from the hospital troubles.
###chapter 49
Mia POV
 
At this stage, getting out of the hospital and gaining peace, I was already happy with all that, and so I decided to have fun with my life already and promised myself not to go back to the dark shells I once stayed in at the early stage of my life.
 
"Mia, can we talk about something?" Ethan said with a dripping and also warning look to me.
 
I looked at him with a wide smile on my face, with my thoughts running through my head, thinking about what he wanted us to discuss, and from his expression, it sounded like something serious.
 
"Yes, we can.".
 
"Promise not to be angry." I gave him an awkward look this time.
 
What does he mean? He thinks I get angry over little issues or what.
 
"What that look on your face?" He asked calmly with a neutral expression.
 
"Just go ahead with your question," I said with a smile to him.
 
"Okay," he took a quick breath in and out.
 
"Can we just deal with something?" he gazed at me as I raised an eyebrow.
 
"What could that be this time?" I asked him as my eyes darkened quickly.
 
"Can we start calling each other's romantic names instead of this, Ethan and Mia?" My jaw dropped with these words.
 
I just had to give a smirk, adding a crazy and stupid reaction to him with barely a neutral look.
 
"Is it funny or too much to ask?" He smiled. "And if you don't want that, I can just continue with the regular name," he smirked to me.
 
 
********
 
I couldn't believe what I was hearing at this time. Ethan wanted us to start using romantic names for each other, like newlywed? I thought he was joking at first, but the serious and Stern look on his face told me otherwise of him. 
 
"Romantic names?" I repeated, trying to stifle a giggle, but it just turned out to be a low chuckle, which was annoying.
 
"You mean like we calling ourselves...sweetheart or honey?" Ethan nodded, his eyes sparkling with amusement at the words, which sounded odd to me already.
 
"Exactly. Something just like that." He chuckled excitedly, leaving me shocked.
 
I raised an eyebrow with a deep glance to Bim, trying to process this new and odd development.
 
. "And what really makes you think I'd be okay with this new prompt?" Ethan shrugged, his smile faltering for a moment with my question.
 
. "I just thought it would be nice to have something special between us both. You know, like a secret language that couple's have." I couldn't help but laugh at this statement of his.
 
"A secret language for couples? You're such a little goofball, Ethan." I laughed like I have never done for a long time.
 
Ethan's face lit up with a smile also, and it makes me feel off.
 
"Hey, I'm serious about this, Mia! I want us to have something that's just ours and what other couples  have." I shook my head, still chuckling over his words to me.
 
"Okay, that's fine. But if I eventually start calling you'sweetcheeks' or something similar, don't say I didn't warn you about this." Ethan grinned, relief written all over his face already. 
 
"That's a deal. And I promise to come up with something equally cheesy for you as you made one for me already." He smiled.
 
I rolled my eyes plus eyebrow, laughing at his every statement. 
 
"This is going to be very interesting." As we continued to banter back and forth to me, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement wash me from within. 
 
This was a new side of Ethan. I hadn't seen before since we started this forced love, and I had to admit it, I was intrigued by this.
 
"Okay, so what's my new name going to be like?" I asked, raising an eyebrow and giving him a deep look through his eyes.
 
Ethan thought for a moment before a sly grin spread across his face plus a bold smile.
 
. "I've got it already. From now on, you're my little'sunshine'." I groaned, laughing at his words and also giving him a blush.
 
"That's so corny and sweet." Ethan just chuckled back at me, his eyes sparkling with amusement towards my blush. 
 
"Hey, you said I could come up with something cheesy for you."
 
I playfully hit him on the arm, giving him a little smile.
 
. "Yeah, but I didn't mean that cheesy." Ethan just laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners.
 
"Too late now, my little sunshine. You're stuck with it, and it would be forever." She laughed once more.
 
I sighed, shaking my head in a shivering manner. 
 
"I have a feeling I'm totally going to regret all this."
 
Ethan just grinned, his face lighting up with excitement already.
 
"I promise you won't regret a single part of this. Now, come on, my little sunshine. Let's go get some lunch." She held my arms.
 
As we walked out of my room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of happiness within. This was a new beginning for us in this secret language empire and a chance to start fresh and leave the past behind. 
 
And who knows, maybe this silly romantic name thing would actually bring us closer together.
 
Over lunch time, Ethan couldn't stop calling me "my little sunshine". It was totally annoying at first, but eventually, I found myself smiling every time he said it to me. It was like he had unlocked a new level of cheesiness within me, and I couldn't help but be charmed by it already.
 
As we finished up the meals and prepared to part ways, Ethan turned to me with a serious and Stern look on his face. 
 
"Hey, my little sunshine?" He said, his voice low and gentle to me. 
 
"I'm really glad we're doing this already. I feel like we're finally moving forward into a better relationship."
 
I smiled, feeling a sense of agreement, which was obvious.
 
"Me too, Ethan. Me too." I realized I made a mistake.
 
"Sorry," I said.
 
"Don't worry, you would totally get used to all this.".
###chapter 50
Mia POV
 
"So, babe, when would we get the vacation as promised?" My interrupted the young man from his laptop already.
 
"I don't know yet, but I just have to finish all this kind of work," he sighed.
 
"Can I help?" I questioned getting myself closer to him.
 
" No!" He looked at me, grabbing out the file I had held.
 
"Why?" I asked rudely.
 
"It has not been long since you came home after the treatment, and I can't let you stress yourself," he said, giving me a piecering look into the eyes.
 
"Abd who said it stressed?" I asked.
 
"Me,," he replied.
 
"Ethan," I paused as he looked at me. "Sorry, Babe, it's been over a week since I got home, so I can work," I said, sitting up right.
 
"And I said you can't?" He still was stuck with his words to me.
 
"Why can't I?" I said. "Okay, give me at least 10 reasons why I shouldn't." I asked, looking at him in the eyes.
 
"Ten is so much; just one would answer it all," he said.
 
"Okay, go on." 
 
"You are still supposed to rest and not disturb yourself.".
 
I looked at him as I gave a thought for sometime with no just words to him, and this made the tension in the room much more active.
 
"But you can have sex with me?" He laughed and turned to me.
 
" Yes!" He frowned quickly.
 
*******
 
 
I raised an eyebrow, feeling a surge of frustration wash me and a quick lump down my throat.
 
. "So, you can have sex with me, but I'm not allowed to work or do anything else that might'stress' me out." Ethan sighed, rubbing his temples with a look that has a spice of frustration.
 
. "Mia, that's not what I actually meant. Sex is totally...different. It's not like work or other strenuous activities we do." He said.
 
I smirked, crossing my arms over my chest immediately.
 
"Oh, really? And how is it really different, exactly?" Ethan looked at me with another sigh, his expression softening and calm after his long breath in and out. 
 
"Because it's actually... intimate. And it's something we both would enjoy. But work...work is totally different. It's stressful, and it can be overwhelming and also makes people weak." I gave my own sigh.
 
I shook my head in disagreement, feeling a sense of incredulity within.
 
"You're not making any sense here, Ethan. If I'm well enough to have good sex, then I'm well enough to work, like I'm fit for both." Ethan threw his hands against mine, looking exasperated already.
 
"Fine, Mia. Have it your own way. But can we please just drop it for now, please?" He pleaded.
 
I glared at him, feeling a sense of annoyance and anger within.
 
"No, we can't just drop it now. You're always trying to control me, Ethan, and that mad. And I'm also sick of it." Ethan's expression changed immediately, and he looked at me with a hint of sadness in his face. 
 
"Mia, that's totally not true. I just want what's best for you and me." He exclaimed.
 
I snorted once more, feeling a sense of derision again. 
 
"Save it for later, Ethan." The tension in the room was palpable and visible, and I could feel the anger and frustration emanating from both of us inner selves.
 
But then, suddenly, Ethan's expression changed back, and he looked at me with a hint of mischief and a little light up within.
 
"Hey, my little sunshine?" He said, his voice low and husky with an annoying look.
 
. I raised an eyebrow, feeling a sense of wariness within, which I just wouldn't want to unleash on Ethan.
 
"What that look?" He held on both sides of my check, forcing a smile out of me.
 
"Where do you want to go for our vacation?" he asked, his eyes sparkling with excitement, which also made me look excited within but wore another expression out.
 
I was taken aback by the sudden change in topic, and I felt a sense of confusion but just had to cross the bridge.
 
"What? I thought we were still arguing over work and sex." Ethan grinned, his eyes crinkling at the corners before piecering them into mine. 
 
"We can argue later, sunshine. Right now, let's talk about something more fun and interesting. Like our vacation trip."
 
I couldn't help but laugh at his words, feeling a sense of relief wash over me quick. 
 
"Okay, fine." I said with an exhale of relief.
 
"WWhere do I want to go...hmm...how about?" I gave thought for some moment without any distraction.
 
" Brazil?" Ethan's face lit up with excitement. "Brazil? That sounds totally amazing! We can stay in an overwater bungalow that is private and snorkel with sharks, dolphins, and rays."
 
I smiled, feeling a sense of excitement wash over me.
 
"That totally sounds incredible." Ethan nodded positively, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm, which lit up my soul.
 
"I know, right? And we can also take a sunset cruise and watch the stars together, as a couple's." I imagined myself there already.
 
I felt a sense of romance wash over me still imagining, and I couldn't help but lean in closer to Ethan with my imagination. 
 
"That sounds totally dope," I whispered to myself. Ethan smiled to Mr., his face inches away from mine. "I'm glad you like the idea, my little sunshine." He replied.
 
As we both sat there, with myself lost in my own little world of imagination, I couldn't help but feel grateful for this little distraction from our argument.
 
. Maybe, just maybe, this vacation was exactly what we needed to reconnect and strengthen our relationships, since we totally have less trouble to face.
 
"Can I ask something?" I turned to him.
 
"Go on," his face lit with a huge smile already.
 
"Okay," I exhaled with double thought.
 
"Would Alexander come with us?" I asked.
 
" No!"
 
"But why?" I asked.
 
"It's for we both only, and it's not as if we would spend ages there," he replied.
 
"Okay then."
###chapter 51
Mia POV
 
"Good news, family!" Ethan exclaimed.
 
"Why is there a meeting?" I asked, approaching the sitting room.
 
******
 
As I stood there glancing through all of their eyes, frozen in discomfort from the meeting, I couldn't help but think about how this vacation had been Ethan's idea all of a sudden.
 
. He had been the one to suggest all of this, to plan it, and to excitedly share the details with us.
 
. But now, as I looked at Alexander's tear-stained face, I couldn't help but wonder if Ethan had thought this through before unleashing the secret to the little boy.
 
Had he considered how Alexander would feel, being left behind and knowing he doesn't have a space in the vacation? 
 
Had he thought about the impact this would have on our already fragile family dynamics that Alexander already hugged? 
 
Or had he just been too caught up in his own excitement to think about anyone else-that means pure selfishness?
 
I felt a surge of frustration towards Ethan saying his words, mixed with a deep sadness for Alexander, whose eyes were red and nose already dripping. 
 
"Why had we not considered this before?" I asked myself.
 
Why had we not thought about how our actions would affect him?
 
As I looked around the whole room, I saw the tension and sadness etched on everyone's faces. Ethan's excitement had been short-lived already, replaced by a sense of regret and uncertainty for saying his words. 
 
. I knew that we had to make things right now to find a way to include Alexander in our plans for the vacation.
 
But for now, the room was filled with an uncomfortable silence and killing tension, the only sound Alexander's heartbreaking sobs with pain.
 
I felt a lump form down in my throat as I watched him, my heart aching with sadness for him.
 
I knew that we had to do something to make this right in this family.
 
"But what?" This was the question running through my head.
 
I looked at Ethan eyeball to eyeball, hoping that he would have some answers to give me, but he just shook his head slowly, looking helpless.
 
I took a deep breath in and out, trying to think of something to give everyone a smirk on their faces-anything that we could do to fix this challenge. And then, suddenly, an idea struck me.
 
"Why don't we make this a family vacation for everyone?" I exclaimed, trying to sound enthusiastic just to give all a smirk.
 
"We can find a way to include Alexander, to make him feel part of it and not left out," I smiled forcefully.
 
Ethan looked at me, a glimmer of hope in his eyes. 
 
"How?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper still giving me a werid glance.
 
I thought for a moment with no words, just trying to come up with a solution for all this. And then it struck me.
 
"We can just find a resort that caters to families," I said, excitement growing in my voice quickly.
 
"One that has activities and amenities for kids also. In that way, Alexander can come with us, and we can all spend quality time together as a family."
 
Ethan's face lit up with excitement also, and he turned to Alexander, who was still sobbing quietly.
 
"Hey, buddy, what do you say about this idea?" He asked, his voice full of hope. 
 
"Want to come with us on vacation, as family?" Ethan said.
 
Alexander looked up to his father, his eyes red and puffy from crying. He sniffled and then nodded positively, a small smile on his face already.
 
I felt a surge of relief wash me, mixed with happiness and excitement.
 
Maybe, just maybe, we could make this work and still have a good time. Maybe we could find a way to include Alexander in our plans to make him feel part of our family again.
 
As we three hugged, the tension in the room began to dissipate little by little, replaced by a sense of hope and possibility within all.
 
We still had a long way to go on all this, but for now, we had taken the first step towards healing, towards becoming a family again.
 
"So, Alexander, I would have a chat with your dad?" I said as soon as everyone departed from the hug.
 
"A chat now?" Ethan asked.
 
"Yes," I added with a grin on my face, holding Ethan by his arms.
 
He tried pulling himself out, but I still held him, dragging him through the staircase leading to both rooms.
 
"Ethan," he interrupted.
 
"What happened to the romantic names we talked about?" he asked as I raised an eyebrow.
 
"Are you possed?" He gave me a strange look.
 
"Why asking such a thing, my little sunshine?" he smiled.
 
"Cause you act like one," I confused.
 
" What? Why?" He exclaimed.
 
"Spare me, Ethan," I sat on the bed quickly.
 
"You just acted so abnormal and not immature." I raised an eyebrow arrogantly.
 
"My little sunshine.".
 
"Shut up," I whispered.
###chapter 52
Mia POV
 
"Mia, aren't you also taking me along with you and your husband?" Amanda said with her sitting on my bed.
 
"Rude of you to ask?" I replied.
 
"How did you expect a reply from me then?" She asked, acting so rude and arrogant.
 
"Amanda, what's your problem?" I asked her.
 
"Can we skip all this unuseful query and go to the right point here?" Her words sounded so hard to me.
 
I sat up looking at her with a different kind of look, still looking at her with different kinds of thoughts running through my head already.
 
"Amanda, be careful," I said to her.
 
 
"Amanda, be careful of me," I warned her once more, my voice low and even still filled with annoyance. But Amanda just laughed out, a cold, mirthless sound.
 
"Oh, I'm shaking in my boots already, Mia," she chuckled.
 
"You think you're so much better than me, Mia; don't you dare me? With your perfect little family and your perfect little life that I made for you." Her voice was filled with malice.
 
I felt a surge of anger at her arrogant words to me, but I kept my cool based on the fact that I am much older than her.
 
"Amanda, what's going on with you? You're acting really strange this time." I said with a much calmer voice.
 
"Strange?" she repeated, her voice rising up against mine. "You're one to talk, Miss 'I'm so much better than everyone else'." She laughed, making mockery of me.
 
I stood up, my heart racing with anger and pain. 
 
"Amanda, please stop it. You're being really hurtful now." I exclaimed.
 
But Amanda just kept going, her words cutting deep like a dagger stabbed between my heart.
 
"You think you're so perfect, but you're not perfect. You're just a fake life, Mia. A fake wife, a fake mother, a fake person living in a total fake world."
 
I felt tears prick at the corners of my eyes slowly, but I refused to let them fall before her presence. I wouldn't give Amanda the satisfaction nor make myself like a brat.
 
 
I felt my anger boiling over, and I couldn't keep my cool anymore.
 
. "How dare you, Amanda!" I exclaimed, my voice rising with anger already.
 
. "You think you can just come at me like this and I'll take it from you? You're the fake one here, Amanda. You're the one who's always causing drama and stirring up trouble all over the place. You're a toxic person, hete, and I'm sick of it!"
 
Amanda's face twisted in a scowl, but she just kept going with her words. 
 
"At least I'm not much of a hypocrite like you, Mia," she spat after her words.
 
. "At least I'm not pretending to be something I'm not." She added.
 
I was furious now and could possibly do anything at this point. 
 
"How can you say that?" I demanded, grinning my teeth with anger. 
 
"You're the one who's always pretending to be something you're not, living the fake life. You're a master manipulator, Amanda. You manipulate everyone around you to get what you want at your time." She laughed.
 
Just as it seemed like things were about to get out of hand in the room, Ethan walked into the room.
 
"Hey, hey, ladies, what's going on here?" He asked, his voice calm and soothing, interrupting the bash.
 
Amanda's demeanor changed instantly, like a chameleon. She smiled sweetly at Ethan, and her voice became sugary sweet-or better yet, honey sweet.
 
"Oh, Ethan, I'm so glad you're here. Mia and I were just having a little disagreement about the personal last issue." She opened up her 32 with me looking at her weridly.
 
I rolled my eyes against her. 
 
"A little disagreement?" I repeated the words.
 
"That's not what I'd call it if I were you."
 
Ethan looked at me, then at Amanda, giving a confused look.
 
"What's actually going on here, Mia?" He asked with visible confusion.
 
But before I could answer his questions, Amanda jumped in.
 
. "Mia's just being really sensitive about things, Ethan. She can't handle a little bit of criticism from her sister." She faked the look again, looking more innocent.
 
I felt my anger surge again with me biting my lower lips and also biting my tongue. 
 
 
I wasn't going to let Amanda get to me this time like she did in the past. Not now, not in front of Ethan, who she forced me to.
 
"Amanda, that's totally not true," Ethan said, his voice firm and calm. 
 
"Mia, what's truly going on?" He asked, looking at me.
 
I took a deep breath and tried to calm down from the whole issue.
 
. "Amanda's just being really hurtful to me, Ethan. She's saying some really cruel things to me." I said calmly also.
 
Ethan looked at Amanda for a while, his expression Stern and serious.
 
"Amanda, can you apologize to Mia? Now." He said.
 
But Amanda just smiled sweetly at him faking her look.
 
"Oh, Ethan, I'm really sorry if I hurt Mia's feelings. That wasn't my intention though."
 
I knew she was really lying, but Ethan seemed to buy it from her. 
 
"Okay, let's just calm down and talk about this much later, okay?" he said with a smirk.
 
I nodded, still seething with anger for Amanda. But I knew I had to calm down since I couldn't hurt her. I couldn't let Amanda get the best of me this time, but I still can't hurt her.
 
As we left the room, I couldn't help but feel frustrated from what just happened. Why did Ethan always seem to take Amanda's side almost the whole time? Why did he always seem to believe her lies every time?
 
I knew I had to talk to him about this character he developed, but I didn't know how to place the matter. I didn't want to start another fight in the house that already started having peace, but I couldn't just let things go on like this.
 
As I walked away, I heard Amanda's voice behind me.
 
"Thanks, Ethan. I knew I could count on you.".
 
I felt a surge of anger at her words to me, but I kept walking, not trying to look back. I wasn't going to let her get to me again. Not now, not ever.
 
But as I walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that Amanda was going to be a problem for a long time to come. And I didn't know how to stop her from getting into it.
 
###chapter 53
Mia POV
 
"You know our main reason here, Amanda." As I was passing by the door of my mother's room, I heard the words that made me stand by the doorside.
 
"Mother, she's so hard and prevents me from coming closer," her voice filled with malice, keeping me in suspense already.
 
What were my mother and sister talking about already? Why do I feel as if I was the main topic of the day in their room? 
 
I just still stood there with clearly no way that I wanted to leave until I got the whole information I needed from them both.
 
The two in the room just didn't say a word again while I stood there; it felt as if they knew I was standing there.
 
 
I stood frozen in the doorway, my ears straining to hear more of the conversation between my mother and Amanda, which made me curious and my ear inching.
 
But the room fell so silent, as if they knew I was listening to their conversation. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I wondered what they were discussing in there.
 
Why was I the main topic of their conversation? After a few moments of silence and tension, I realized I wasn't going to hear anything else from them. 
 
I slowly backed away from the doorway and made my way to my room, my mind racing with lots of thoughts.
 
. Why was Amanda saying I was hard and prevented myself from coming closer to her? What did she mean by those words?
 
As I lay on my bed with thought, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. 
 
. And then I remembered the conversation I had with Amanda earlier. The way she had been acting so strange and hurtful towards me.
 
It all started to make real sense now.
 
But just as I thought I had figured it out already, I remembered something else from the past. 
 
Something that made my blood run cold immediately. The way Amanda had been looking at me earlier, the way she had been talking to me with no respect. It was all so familiar to me.
 
And then it quickly hit me. The realization that made my heart skip a beat as if I slipped down. Amanda's behavior, werid, was all because of what happened to me. 
 
What I had been trying to forget for so long, my past. 
 
I sat up in bed, my heart racing with fear and anxiety. No, it couldn't just be. It was just my imagination playing tricks on me this time. But the thought lingered more, haunting me down.
 
I tried to calm myself down at this point, telling myself I was just being paranoid over the matter. But the memory of Amanda's words kept echoing in my mind as if a memory card was there that kept on playing it all over again.
 
"You're just a fake person, Mia. A totally fake wife, a fake mother, a fake person living in a fake world." What did she totally mean by all that? And why did it sound so familiar to me?
 
As I lay there with thought, trying to make sense of everything that was happening, I heard a faint noise coming from outside my room quickly.
 
It sounded like footsteps from behind, light and cautious. 
 
I froze, my heart pounding in my chest so loud. 
 
"Who was it? And what did they want?" I asked within myself.
 
I slowly got out of bed and approached the door slowly, my ears pressed against it with a still racing heart, trying to hear any sound again.
 
But there was total silence.
 
I waited for what felt like an eternity to hear the sound, but there was no other sound again. 
 
I slowly backed away from the door with fear, my mind racing with thoughts and questions. 
 
Who could it be by this time? 
 
I tried to shake off the feeling of unease that built within, telling myself it was just my imagination playing tricks on me once more.
 
. But the thought lingered within, haunting me. And then I heard it again-the same voice. The faint noise from outside my room, the light footsteps. This time, they were much closer to the room door.
 
I froze quickly, my heart pounding in my chest with deep fear.
 
Who was it by this time? And what did they want from me?
 
I slowly turned the handle of the door and opened the door, my heart racing with fear and anxiety. 
 
And then I saw her. Amanda. Standing in the hallway with a nightdress and a sly smile on her face like one evil being.
 
"What do you want by this time again, Amanda?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady and calm just not to disturb anyone since it was already late.
 
"I just wanted to talk to you like sisters that we really are, Mia," she said, her voice sweet and innocent like that of a new child. 
 
But I totally knew better of her. I knew she was hiding something from me, or she needs something from me, which she can do anything to get.
 
"What about that Amanda?" I asked, trying to stay calm and gentle with her.
 
"About what happened previously," she said, her eyes glinting with malice while mine with mild fear.
 
"About what you'vebeen totally trying to forget for ages."
 
My heart skipped a little beat as I realized what she was talking about already.
 
The thing I had been trying to forget for so long, my past. The thing that had haunted me for years and had decided to keep back in my life and not try to ruin my present self.
 
"No, Amanda, why?" I said, trying to back away from her, giving a few inches back.
 
But Amanda was too quick to embrace me.
 
She grabbed my arm, her grip tight to mine, keeping me in pain since I know what she's capable of.
 
"You can't run away from the truth forever, Mia," she said to me, her voice calm and calculating while mine filled with fear.
 
"It's time you faced it-the reality of the world." 
 
"Amanda, for real, what's your main purpose here?" I asked her while she smiled.
 
"Just nothing, dear Amanda, but something that you once rejected and ran away from.".
###chapter 54
Mia Pov
 
"Ethan, we need to take them out of this house, and that's my word," my voice filled with malice and anger already.
 
"Why?" he asked.
 
"Why what?" 
 
"Why do you always support Amanda over me, that your wife?" I asked curiously.
 
"I don't support her," he exclaimed.
 
"Then what do you do?" I exclaimed.
 
********
 
"I don't really support her, Mia," Ethan said, his voice rising in defense for himself. 
 
"I'm just trying to keep the peace in the family." He exclaimed.
 
"Keep the peace?" I repeated, my voice dripping with sarcasm and malice. 
 
"By always taking her own side? By always believing her lies because of her innocent look." I exclaimed.
 
"I'm not taking her side, Mia," Ethan said, his face reddening with frustration from defending himself. 
 
"I'm just trying to understand her perspectives and also understand yours."
 
"Her perspective?" I laughed, a cold, mirthless sound from me.
 
"Her perspective is twisted and manipulative like that of a witch. She's using you, Ethan. She's using you against me. Can't you just see it?"
 
"That's totally not true, Mia," Ethan said, his voice firm and calm. "Amanda's is totally not like that."
 
"Oh, really?" I exclaimed, my eyes narrowing.
 
"Then why does she always seem to get what she wants from you? Why does she always seem to manipulate you into doing what she wants every time, and you still fall for it?" I kept the tension boiling within him.
 
Ethan sighed, his shoulders sagging in defeat already. 
 
"Mia, I don't know what you actually want me to say now. since I'm trying to stay neutral here with no words again."
 
"Neutral?" I spat to his words. 
 
"You call all this neutral? You're always defending her every time, always making excuses for her. That's not totally neutral, Ethan. That's taking her side, and it's bad." I said
 
"I'm not taking her side, Mia, for the last time," Ethan repeated, his voice weary and tired.
 
"I'm just trying to keep our family together to be in peace."
 
"By sacrificing me, your wife to them?" I asked, my voice bitter already.
 
"By sacrificing our own marriage?"
 
Ethan's eyes flashed with boiling anger.
 
"That's totally not fair, Mia. I'm not sacrificing anything here, and you know it. I'm just trying to make things work for everyone."
 
"Make things work for everyone?" I laughed again, the sound cold and mocking to him.
 
"You're not even trying that, Ethan. You're just giving in to Amanda's demands, and you hate that. You're just letting her walk all over you as if you both have something you are hiding away from me." I exclaimed.
 
Ethan's face turned pale and reddened with anger, and for a moment, with his look to Mr., I thought he was going to lash out at me.
 
. But then he seemed to rein himself in and stopped that by taking a deep breath before speaking to me.
 
"Mia, I think we need to take a break from all this conversation," he said, his voice tight with control from within himself. 
 
"We're not getting anywhere with all this fight."
 
"Oh, I think we're getting somewhere with all this," I said, my voice sweet and deadly to him.
 
"I think we're finally seeing the truth here. You're finally seeing Amanda for what she is already. A manipulative, toxic person who's ruining our family's joy." 
 
"You're not totally being fair, Mia," Ethan said, his voice rising again with the past tone.
 
"Amanda's not that toxic. She's just a complicated being."
 
"Complicated being?" I repeated, my voice incredulous this time.
 
"Complicated? That's just another nice way of saying manipulative and toxic, Ethan."
 
"No, it's totally not," Ethan said, his face reddening again with anger. 
 
"You're just not ready and willing to see things from her perspective as a senior sister."
 
"Her perspective stinks?" I laughed again, the sound cold and mocking.
 
"Her perspective is totally all about her, Ethan. It's all about what she wants as a human and what she needs as a human. She doesn't care about anyone else; she's a slewfish."
 
"That's totally not true Mia," Ethan said, his voice firm.
 
. "Amanda cares about us totally. She cares about our family since she's a member of it."
 
"Oh, really, she  cares?" I said, my eyes narrowing.
 
. "Then why is she always causing so much drama in this house? Why is she always manipulating us every single time?"
 
Ethan sighed, his shoulders sagging in defeat once more. 
 
"I totally don't know, Mia. Maybe she's just... lost... lost in something personal." He said.
 
"What lost?" I repeated, my voice incredulous again. "Lost? That's just another nice way of saying she's a master manipulator, Ethan."
 
"No, it's totally not," Ethan said, his voice rising again with anger. "You're just not willing to give her a chance like a normal sister would do."
 
"A chance for a sister who's like a devil?" I laughed again, the sound cold and mocking.
 
"A chance to destroy this family? No, thank you, Ethan."
###chapter 55
Ethan POV
 
"Based on what has been happening recently in this office, I would love to give some workers here a few awards for their good work for this enterprise." I stood in the middle of the huge hall with a microphone on my arms, pacing within the little space I have for myself.
 
The whole workers set their eyes on me, the same thing with my little sunshine. She sat down there with an interesting and engaging look to me while I just smiled back, not trying to let the look get over me during my little speech to all my workers.
 
"This might be a surprise to you all, though, but you all have to accept fact." . A loud clap came up this same time I said my words.
 
"So, I would call out a few workers and do what I have to do because of time." I looked to my wristwatch at the same time, still addressing them.
 
"Mia and Sarah, please, can you both come up here?" The both gazed at each other with a surprised-filled face while I smiled to them both as they matched forward with the loud cheers from behind.
 
"Congratulations, my little sunshine. Father made this possible for you," I whispered into her ears while she looked at the crowd with a smile.
 
*****
 
As I handed Mia and Sarah their awards long in their hands, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and joy wash within myself. 
 
Mia, my little sunshine, was not only my assistant but also my wife, and seeing her excel in her role as my secretary was a dream come true for we both as a couple..
 
Mia's face immediately lit up with a bright smile as she accepted her award from my arms, and she leaned in closer to me as I whispered congratulations once more in her ear. 
 
I could feel her heart racing with a lot of excitement, and I knew that this moment meant the world to her already, since it was something none of us planned.
 
As we walked back to our seats with big smiles on our faces, hand in hand, the crowd erupted in applause once again to we both plus Sarah.
 
I looked over at Sarah's, who was beaming with pride already, and nodded in her direction also.
 
"You deserve it, Sarah," I said with a smile waving at her.
 
Mia squeezed my hand against mine, and I knew that she was also thinking the same thing as me.
 
We made a great team already, both in and out of the office area.
 
As the ceremony came to a close within a few hours, I took the microphone once again holding it. 
 
"I just want to say thank you to all of my employees for their hard work and dedication to the organization. You are the reason why this company is successful today, and I am honored to work alongside each and every one of you as your boss and fellow co-worker." I smiled to everyone.
 
The crowd applauded once more to me, and I looked over at Mia's face, who was watching me with tears of joy in her eyes.
 
I knew that she was proud of me already, despite trying to hide it, and that meant everything to me.
 
As we left the huge hall, Mia turned to me and said with a smirk, "I'm so proud of you, Ethan. You're an amazing leader and an even more amazing husband to me and great father to Alexander."
 
I smiled and pulled her closer to myself.
 
"I just couldn't do it without you, my little sunshine," I said, kissing the top of her forehead.
 
"You're my personal rock, my partner, and my everything in this life."
 
*****
As we left the hall, we were both talking to each other romantically.
 
Mia and I walked hand in hand to our car, basking in the glow of a successful awards ceremony.
 
The warm sunshine and gentle breeze only added to our both joy, and we couldn't stop smiling at each other throughout. 
 
When we both arrived home, Mia excused herself to freshen up in the room, and I decided to visit my father, Mr. Joshua, who had been bedridden for a few months now.
 
I walked into his room with a smile, and he smiled weakly back at me.
 
"Ethan, my son, I heard about the awards ceremony you hosted. Congratulations on that achievement!" His voice was frail, but his eyes shone with huge pride. I smiled and took his hand onto mine, feeling a surge of love and gratitude towards him.
 
"Thanks, Dad. It was a really great day. And Mia was amazing, as always." I couldn't help but mention her name at this point, and my dad's eyes lit up even more.
 
"Ah, Mia, my dear daughter-in-law and only daughter. She's the best thing that's happened to you as a human, plus you, Ethan." He smiled.
 
"You'retruly lucky to have her as your wife." He paused, his chest rising and falling with effort.
 
"I'm so glad and joyful I got to see you two happy together after all the whole life issue. You deserve it."
 
I nodded in agreement with his words, feeling a lump form in my throat at the same time.
 
"I know, Dad. I don't know what I'd do without her by my side." My dad's expression turned serious and Stern, and he struggled to sit up straighter to look me in the eyes.
 
"Ethan, I need to talk to you about something, though. I know I don't have much time left here on this bed, and I want to make sure you're prepared to take over the companyy. His voice was laced with concern, and I felt a sense of responsibility wash over me as soon as he revealed his words.
 
"I'm already ready, Dad. I won't let you down this time." I reassured him, trying to sound confident with my words. My dad smiled, looking relieved.
 
"I know you won't fail me, Ethan. You're a true great leader, just like me and your late mother." He paused, his eyes clouding over me. 
 
"I'm really proud of you, my dear son. You've grown into an amazing man and a strong one at that."
 
As I left my father's room, stepping me out to the sitting room, I felt a sense of determination wash over me.
 
I would just make sure to make him proud and to take care of Mia, my child, and the company as I promised him.
 
I walked back to our bedroom, where Mia was waiting for me already, looking beautiful as always.
 
"Hey, my little sunshine," I said, kissing her forehead as soon as I walked in.
 
. "How are you doing, dear?" Mia smiled and snuggled into my arms, her warmth and love enveloping me immediately.
 
"I'm doing really great now that I'm home. How was your visit with your dad though?" She asked, concern etched on her face quickly.
 
I sighed to her words, feeling a sense of sadness wash over me.
 
"It was kind of good, but he's not doing well either. He's worried about the company as always, but I reassured him that I've got everything under control with your help." Mia's expression softened, and she hugged me tighter with a smirk on both faces.
 
"I'm always here for you, Ethan. We'll face everything together as a couple." Her words were a quick balm to my soul at this point, and I knew that with her by my side, I could conquer anything that came my way, like how I have done in the past.
###chapter 56
Mia POV
 
"I would be needing a family-size hose, actually." My eyes were both stuck to my laptop, my head pressing against my phone with my shoulder as its support.
 
"A family of how many, if I may ask madam," the voice from the other end asked with a nice tone to me.
 
"Five,  guys, 3 females,""I said.
 
"Okay, ma'am, I would write that down," the voice from the other end still said with the same former tone.
 
"So, how much should I be planning on for our Target?" I had to pause my deep and serious look at the laptop and give more concern to the words of the trip planner.
 
"A rate of five thousand dollars can do," age said.
 
"Remember, we are all taking a first-class flight," I said.
 
"I know, ma'am," she said.
 
"Please send in your account details for the transfer." 
 
" Where?" 
 
"My email, please," I responded, returning back to my email.
 
"I would do that now." I cut off the call after the lady's last words to me.
 
I screeched out the name of Ethan as soon as I dropped my phone back to the bed, with my eyes still on the laptop screen.
 
"What's up?" He replied from the bathroom.
 
"I have made arrangements for the vacation next week.".
 
"How many reservations?" he asked.
 
"Five," I replied.
 
"What the cost?" He asked once more.
 
"Just $5k," I said, taking away my eyes from the screen.
 
"O...kay," he said.
 
 
 
I couldn't help but smile as I heard Ethan's response to my words. 
 
He was always so calm and collected, but I knew he was excited about the vacation too, as myself and Alexander are.
 
 
"Hey, come check this out, handsome," I said, beckoning him to come closer to where I sat.
 
He walked out of the bathroom, towel in hand, and peered over my shoulder at the laptop screen, which was at us both.
 
"Wow, first-class flights and a family-sized house? You're really going all out, aren't you, my little sunshine?" He teased me, chuckling. I playfully rolled my eyes to his words. 
 
"Hey, we all deserve it. And besides, it's not just about us alone. It's about making memories with Alexander and your family too." He smiled at me.
 
Ethan nodded, his expression turning serious and more Stern. 
 
"You're totally right. I'm just glad we can afford it now and also have the chance to do it." He paused, looking thoughtful to my words.
 
"You know, I was just thinking... maybe we should upgrade our hotel room to a suite master class. To give us some extra space to relax our minds." He suggested with serious eye sight.
 
I smiled back at him, feeling grateful for our blessings already. 
 
"Me too. Okay, so I need to send the trip planner our new plans and also do the transfer to her to process it as soon as she can."
 
Ethan nodded and walked over to the dresser to grab his wallet and walked back to my sitting spot.
 
"Here" get forwarded his arm to me. ', use my card. I'll take care of it."
 
I smiled, feeling loved and supported by the young rich man. 
 
"Thanks, babe." As I sent the detailswith the account details, Ethan sat down beside me and put his arm around me, looking at my laptop. 
 
"You know, I was just thinking... maybe we should make this a surprise to everyone. Not tell them until the day of the trip that they got  a firstclass ticket and have a space with us, despite having almost spilled it out before."
 
My eyes widened in excitement at his words.
 
"That's a great idea, though! They'll be so thrilled about it." Ethan grinned to my words.
 
"I know, right? Okay, let's keep it a secret for now and not spoil it like the last time." He placed his hands around his chest, trying to seal his words.
 
"But I have a feeling this is going to be the best vacation ever." He added.
 
I leaned into him, feeling happy and content with everything already. 
 
"I can't wait to see the look on their faces when we tell them about this. And I'm so glad we get to spend some quality time together as a family without any issues." I grinned.
 
Ethan squeezed me tight with a smile.
 
. "Me too, babe. Me too."
 
We sat there for a moment with a smile, enjoying each other's company, before Ethan spoke up again, breaking in the few minutes of fun.
 
"You know, we should also plan some fun activities for the family there. Maybe a trip to the beach or an amusement park while we are still there." He suggested.
 
I nodded enthusiastically with his words.
 
. "That sounds like a great idea! I'll start looking into it later." Ethan smiled, his eyes shining with excitement with mine also.
 
"I can't wait to see what you come up with." He said.
 
 
As we sat there, enjoying each other's company once more, I couldn't help but feel grateful for this moment. 
 
We were finally taking a break from our busy lives and spending quality time together as a family.
 
I leaned in closer to Ethan's, feeling his warmth and love wash over me.
 
"You know, I was just thinking," I said, looking into his eyes, "maybe we should also plan a special surprise for Alexander. Something to make this trip even more memorable for him as a child."
 
Ethan's eyes lit up with excitement and support for my words.
 
. "That's a great idea though! What did you have in mind for that?" 
 
I thought for a moment with no words but a sly grin spreading across my face. 
 
"I was thinking maybe we could arrange a private meeting with his favorite celebrity crush. He's always been a huge fan of them, and I know he would be thrilled to meet them in person." I said.
 
Ethan's eyes widened in surprise, looking sly in my eye sight.
 
"That's a total fantastic idea! I'm sure we can make it happen, at least."
 
I nodded, giving a positive face, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation within.
 
"I'll start looking into it right away."
 
As we continued to plan and make arrangements for the trip, I couldn't help but feel a sense of joy and contentment within my inner self.
 
This was going to be the best vacation ever in my life, and I was so grateful to have Ethan by my side to share it with.
 
###chapter 57
Mia POV
 
"Amanda, aren't you ready yet? The flight would soon take off," I exclaimed as soon as I walked into the room.
 
Amanda just sat there applying make-up to her face while she has been getting call-bash at the airport.
 
"Wait, sis, it's not my fault." She stood up as soon as she noticed my presence in the room.
 
"Then whose fault is it?" I questioned holding my waist with my arms looking in her direction.
 
"It's yours; you should have told us the date before last night," she said rudely.
 
"At least you should be grateful I involved you in this trip," I hissed.
 
 
 
I couldn't believe Amanda's response to me.
 
"You should be grateful I involved you in this trip." I repeated once more, my voice rising in deep anger.
 
"You're the one who's always begging me to take you on trips, and now you're acting like one who's forcing?"
 
Amanda just shrugged, giving me a bombastic side look, and continued applying her makeup after hers.
 
"Whatever, sis. Let's just go."
 
I was fuming deep already with her rude character. 
 
I turned on my heel and stormed out of the room with deep anger, leaving Amanda to finish getting ready on her own; I won't for her.
 
As I walked into the living room, I saw Ethan trying to calm down our 5-year-old son, Alexander, who was running around in circles, excited for the trip. 
 
Madam Lucy, my mother, was also trying to help Ethan, but Alexander was being stubborn and so playful.
 
"Mommy, Mommy, I want to go on the plane!" Alexander exclaimed, running to me with his hands open.
 
I forced a smile on the young little boy and picked him up.
 
"We're going, baby Alex. Let's go."
 
Ethan looked at me concerned with my facial expressions. 
 
"Hey, my little sunshine, what's wrong? You look upset on our trip day." Ethan walked closer to me.
 
I just shook my head with a sigh.
 
"Amanda. She's being her usual self." I exclaimed.
 
Ethan sighed also.
 
"Please, let's just get on the plane and get this trip started."
 
We made our way to the airport, with Amanda finally joining us after her long time wasting on the makeup that makes her look like she just stepped off a fashion magazine cover.
 
As we boarded the plane, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief within myself. At least we were finally on our way to have some rest.
 
But as we settled into our first-class seats, which have huge comfort, Amanda started complaining again like before.
 
"I don't like this seat at all. Can I switch with Your's, Mia?" She asked.
 
I rolled my eyes with anger.
 
"No, Amanda. You're not switching any seats with me."
 
My mother, who was sitting across from us, spoke up. 
 
"Amanda, you need to calm down and enjoy the flight like a normal human that you are."
 
But Amanda just huffed rudely and crossed her arms, looking like the petulant child that she is.
 
Ethan tried to intervene in the family matter, but I just shook my head not to let him do so. 
 
"Let her be, Ethan. She's not going to ruin this trip for me nor for anyone else." I exclaimed.
 
As the plane took off, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath within.
 
I was determined to enjoy this trip, no matter what Amanda did or anyone else.
 
 
 
As the plane soared through the skies, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease over me. 
 
Amanda's constant complaining like a child was starting to get on my nerves, and I was worried that she would ruin the entire trip for everyone.
 
Ethan, sensing my frustration already, reached out and took my hand onto his.
 
"Hey, it's totally okay. Let's just relax and enjoy the flight together." He said.
 
I nodded, trying to calm down myself. But Amanda's behavior was making it difficult for me to do so.
 
My mother, who was sitting across from us, tried to distract Alexander with a coloring book she held, but he was too excited to focus on the book.
 
"Mommy, Mommy, look! A big cloud!" he exclaimed, pointing out the window with excitement.
 
I smiled and leaned over to look towards what he pointed.
 
"Wow, baby, that's a really big cloud!"
 
Amanda huffed and crossed her arms, looking like a petulant child again.
 
"Can we just get there already?" She said to the hearing of everyone.
 
I rolled my eyes rudely.
 
. "Amanda, we've only been on the plane for an hour and not days, so relax."
 
But Amanda just scowled and looked out the window, treating me with totally less respect.
 
Ethan tried to intervene again, but I just shook my head, still trying not to intervene into a family issue. 
 
"Let her just be, Ethan. She's not going to ruin this trip for me or you."
 
As the female figure flight attendants came by to offer snacks and drinks, Amanda complained about the options. 
 
"I don't like peanuts. I don't like soda. What kind of airline is this?" She hissed.
 
I threw up my hands with already visible anger.
 
"Amanda, like, seriously? You're being so ridiculous in here."
 
My mom spoke up again in a calm tone. 
 
"Amanda, please try to calm down here. We're all trying to enjoy the flight and future trip."
 
But Amanda just huffed and crossed her arms again, making me pissed off.
 
I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, trying to take off the anger within. I was determined to enjoy this trip, no matter what Amanda did to me in here.
 
As the plane hit turbulence, Alexander squealed with delight and excitement. 
 
"Wheeee! This is so much fun, Mummy!"
 
I smiled and held him by the hand.
 
"I know, baby. It's like a rollercoaster in the park." I smiled.
 
Amanda just groaned like a kid that was getting mistreated.
 
"This is terrible. I hate flying and sitting for hours." She hissed.
 
I opened my eyes and glared at her, trying to overcome anger.
 
"Amanda, that's it. If you don't calm down here and enjoy the flight, I'm going to lose my mind on you and send you back."
 
Ethan intervened again, this time more firmly and not allowing me to calm him. 
 
"Amanda, can you stop complaining? You're ruining the trip for everyone in here."
 
Amanda looked taken aback by Ethan Word's, but finally, she seemed to calm down with his screech.
 
She put on her headphones quickly and closed her eyes like a sleeping bird, leaving the rest of us to enjoy the flight in peace without her troubles.
