###chapter 1: The Solitude of an Empire 
***************
Amelia Montalbán vanished after her powerful husband chose his toxic family over their marriage. Three years later, she resurfaces as "Margaret" – Paris’s most enigmatic jewelry designer, guarding a explosive secret: her son, Lorenzo’s heir. When financial ruin forces Lorenzo to collaborate with Margaret, her exquisite designs ignite his suspicion. Amidst corporate sabotage and a deadly game of secrets, Lorenzo must confront his family’s lies to reclaim his stolen legacy. But revealing the truth could cost Amelia everything… or finally set her free. A tale of betrayal, glittering ambition, and the diamonds that cut deepest.
***************

The sun was setting on the horizon, tinting the tall buildings of the financial district in red and gold. From his office on the top floor of Montalbán Tower, Lorenzo watched the city, lost in a sea of numbers and projections that kept swirling in his mind.

He was a respected CEO, a money magnate, but at that moment, he felt a pang of emptiness in his heart. As the night wore on, his phone vibrated insistently. A message from his mother appeared on the screen: "Where is Amelia? We haven't seen her in a long time." Lorenzo sighed. That question always haunted him. The Montalbán family did not forgive the absence of a CEO's wife, especially when they saw her as a "peasant" who didn't belong in their world.

Amelia had been a source of light in his life, a woman with overflowing talent and creativity. But in recent months, her laughter had disappeared. He had given himself completely to his work, ignoring the growing pain in his wife, until it had become almost inaudible.

That same night, after a long day of work, he decided to return home. On the way, he remembered the happy days when he and Amelia shared dreams and plans, but all of that had been lost in the noise of meetings and negotiations. However, the unease in his chest grew as he neared home.

Upon entering, the house was an echo of silence. Dinner was served, but there was no joy at the table. Amelia looked at him with a mixture of sadness and resignation. She was beautiful, wearing a silk blouse that accentuated her figure, but her eyes reflected the suffering she had been enduring.

-Lorenzo, can we talk? -she said, her voice trembling slightly.

He sat down, feeling the weight of her gaze.

-Of course, what's this about? -he responded, trying to sound nonchalant, although part of him feared what was coming.

-I've been thinking about us. About what we've stopped being -she began, taking a deep breath-. You're always busy, and I... I feel invisible.

He frowned, but he knew she was right. Guilt attacked him like a thief in the night.

-Amelia, you know I work hard for us, for our future. I want to give you everything you deserve -he said, trying to justify his absence.

-And what about me? -she interrupted, her voice rising-. What about our nights together, our laughter? The Montalbán family doesn't accept me. To them, I'll always be an outsider. You're not the only one with responsibilities, Lorenzo. I have my own dreams too, and I feel trapped in this life I didn't choose.

Lorenzo felt the sting of her words, like a direct blow to his heart. Her frustration hit him deeply, and he realized he had been ignoring her pain.

-It's not easy for me either -he confessed-. Don't think they look down on you, that you're just "the CEO's wife." You know I love you, Amelia. I always have.

-Then show me -she said, tears in her eyes-. Show me that you value me, that I'm not just an accessory in your life.

A deep silence filled the room, laden with unspoken emotions. Lorenzo understood that while his work was important, he couldn't keep sacrificing their relationship at the altar of success. He needed to find balance, but before that, he had to heal the pain he had caused.

-I'm sorry, Amelia. I promise I'll try to change -he responded, reaching out to her-. I need you by my side, and I want you to know you're not invisible to me.

She took his hand, but in her expression, there was a mixture of hope and doubt. The road to reconciliation would be difficult, but both knew they had to face it together.

-Let's do it -she said, feeling a spark of hope.

But a shadow loomed over them, a shadow that represented Lorenzo's family, who would never stop judging her. And so, in the silence of their home, the fight for their love was only beginning.

As the conversation settled in the palpable tension of the room, Lorenzo's phone rang again. This time, it was a message from his sister, alerting him to an urgent "situation."

-What's going on? -asked Amelia, frowning as Lorenzo read the screen.

-It's mom. She says she's feeling very ill and needs us to be with her -he replied, his voice tense.

Amelia felt her stomach churn. It wasn't the first time Lorenzo's mother used manipulation to pull him to her side, and she didn't want to be a pawn in her game.

-Are you going to go? -she asked, trying to stay calm.

-I can't leave her alone, Amelia. She needs support -said Lorenzo, but his look showed he knew what this would mean for them.

-And what about us? -she said, pain reflecting in her voice-. I need you here, not at your mother's house, where I'm always looked down upon.

But he was already decided. The thought of his mother being sick made him feel guilty.

-I'm going to talk to her. Maybe... maybe we can all go together, maybe that will help you integrate -Lorenzo suggested, trying to calm her.

The mention of going to live with the Montalbán family made Amelia's heart sink. She knew she wouldn't be welcomed and that every visit would be a reminder of her position in the family. However, she couldn't make Lorenzo feel guilty for his family duty.

The decision was quick. Within hours, they were on their way to the family home. Upon arrival, the dazzling mansion seemed intimidating, and the smile on Lorenzo's mother's face didn't hide the true purpose of their visit.

-Lorenzo, darling! -his mother exclaimed, hugging him tightly-. I missed you so much! Amelia, dear, I hope you're ready to help me around the house.

Amelia forced a smile, but the coldness in her chest grew. As the hours passed, Lorenzo's mother became the perfect hostess, but her critical gaze and sarcastic remarks became evident with every interaction.

-Have you considered giving up that little design career? -Lorenzo's mother said with a smile that didn't reach her eyes-. You must know that a true Montalbán takes care of her family, not vain ambitions.

Amelia felt the blood rush to her head. Humiliation overwhelmed her, and the atmosphere turned hostile. Every look from her sister-in-law, every comment from her mother-in-law, made her feel like an outsider in Lorenzo's world.

-Perhaps you should look more around you and less at the runways, dear -her sister-in-law added with disdain.

Lorenzo, who had been absorbed in conversations about work, finally realized what was happening. He turned to Amelia but couldn't find the words to defend her.

-Amelia, are you okay? -he asked, concerned as his mother and sister continued their storm of criticism.

-No... -she responded, feeling the sting of tears in her eyes-. I'm not okay. I'll never be okay in this place.

Unable to bear the humiliation any longer, Amelia abruptly stood up, leaving Lorenzo and his family speechless. The anguish she had suppressed for so long exploded in her chest.

-I'm going to get some air -she said, leaving the house and Lorenzo behind, feeling her heart break into pieces.

Lorenzo stood frozen, caught between the love for his wife and loyalty to his family, not knowing how to fix the chaos he had created. As the hurtful words echoed in his ears, he realized he had to choose between the acceptance of his family or the defense of the woman he truly loved.

Trapped in the luxurious Montalbán mansion, Amelia felt like a fish out of water. Every corner of the house reminded her of the dream life she had left behind, but what tormented her most was the ongoing humiliation she suffered at the hands of her in-laws.
###chapter 2: Reveal the truth
In her room, standing in front of the mirror, she wondered if she should reveal her true identity as a famous designer. Maybe if she showed who she really was, her family would accept her and see that she wasn't simply "the CEO's wife," but a woman with talent and accomplishments of her own. However, the fear of rejection kept her captive. What if her success only intensified the contempt she already felt? With a sigh, she decided that for now, she would continue keeping her secret.

That morning, as Amelia reflected, Lorenzo entered the room with a worried look.

-Love, I need to talk to you -he said, his tone serious.

-What's wrong? -Amelia asked, her heart racing.

-It's my mother. She's been insisting that she's feeling unwell again. I think she really needs care -Lorenzo explained -I'm leaving for a business trip tomorrow, and I need you to stay here and take care of her.

Amelia felt a pang in her heart. Although she wanted to help Lorenzo, she knew that taking care of his mother meant facing the cruelty of the Montalbán family again. But she couldn't refuse to support him.

-Alright, I'll do whatever is necessary -she replied, trying to remain calm.

The morning of the trip came quickly, and Amelia felt trapped in the house. Lorenzo hugged her tenderly before leaving, promising that everything would return to normal soon. However, as he left, Amelia felt darkness envelop her.

The days without Lorenzo turned into a series of constant trials. Lorenzo's mother, always with an air of superiority, watched her with critical eyes. However, Amelia's biggest torment became her sister-in-law, Valeria.

From the moment Lorenzo left, Valeria wasted no time humiliating her.

-Are you sure you can handle this? -Valeria asked, watching Amelia struggle with household tasks. Her tone was scornful, as if she took pleasure in her discomfort.

-I'm fine, thank you -Amelia responded, trying to keep her composure.

But Valeria didn't stop there. One day, as Amelia struggled to cook a proper dinner for her mother-in-law, Valeria entered the kitchen and began criticizing every move she made.

-Is that how you make a stew? No wonder Lorenzo always looks for food outside the house -Valeria said with a mocking laugh -If you were a good wife, you'd know how to do this.

Amelia felt the heat of humiliation rise to her face, but she forced herself to ignore the comments.

-I'm learning -she responded with a trembling voice. Valeria smiled, enjoying her sister-in-law's suffering.

-Maybe you should stay in the kitchen. After all, that's what's expected from a woman like you -she said before leaving, leaving Amelia feeling helpless.

The situation worsened when Valeria began inviting her friends over, using Amelia as a subject of mockery. One day, while a group of high-society women gathered in the garden, Valeria called out to her from the window.

-Amelia! Come here, we have a question for you -she shouted, with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. As Amelia approached, the air seemed to grow heavier.

-We wanted to know what it's like being a famous designer in a house like this -one of Valeria's friends said, her lips curling in disdain -Isn't it a bit... ridiculous?

Laughter echoed in the air, and Amelia felt the sharp sting of humiliation. Despite everything, she forced herself to smile.

-My designs are important to me -she replied, trying to maintain her dignity -You might not understand, but there's more to me than what you see.

Valeria burst into a mocking laugh.

-Really? It doesn't show at all. Maybe you should stop dreaming and start accepting your place -she said, as the other women laughed even more.

Amelia felt the tears beginning to well up in her eyes, but she fought to keep them from falling. Every word from them was like a blow, and the idea of revealing her true identity haunted her, but fear and shame kept her silent.

One afternoon, while in her room, Amelia overheard conversations coming from the hallway. She discreetly peeked out and realized that Valeria and her mother-in-law were talking. Her heart skipped a beat as she heard her sister-in-law's words.

-You're not really sick, are you, mother? -Valeria said, her voice full of laughter -You're just pretending so Lorenzo won't leave you.

-That's right -Lorenzo's mother responded -And in the meantime, Amelia becomes our servant. I won't give her any rest until she can't take it anymore.

Amelia felt the world fade around her. The truth was even crueler than she had imagined. Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law were manipulating the situation to make her life miserable, while she remained trapped in their game.

The days passed in a silent nightmare, and the pressure of living in that house became unbearable. Lorenzo's mother continued to make disparaging comments, and Amelia began to wonder if she would ever be seen with respect. In those moments of solitude, the idea of escaping became a tempting whisper in her mind.

Finally, one particularly difficult afternoon, Amelia locked herself in her room, feeling the pressure building in her chest. Through the window, she looked at the outside world, a world that seemed more distant every day.

-Why do I feel this way? -she asked herself, looking at her reflection-. I'm a designer. I shouldn't have to endure this.

With determination, she decided it was time to act. The next time she faced Valeria and her mother-in-law, she wouldn't remain silent. She had to find a way to make herself heard. But fear still lurked, reminding her that at any moment, her secret could become her greatest enemy.

As the day faded and loneliness engulfed her, Amelia promised herself that she wouldn't be defeated. But the shadow of uncertainty continued to haunt her, and she knew that revealing her identity could be both her salvation and her downfall.

The days turned into an endless nightmare for Amelia. Valeria's humiliation and her mother-in-law's constant manipulation had become unbearable. However, one day, she finally heard the familiar sound of Lorenzo's car pulling into the mansion. Immediate relief washed over her, but so did an unease.

When Lorenzo entered the house, he looked tired, as if the weight of his work was on his shoulders. Amelia rushed to meet him at the entrance.

-Lorenzo! -she exclaimed, trying to hide her anxiety -I'm so glad to see you.

He smiled weakly, but his eyes reflected concern.

-How have you been? -he asked, watching her closely.

Amelia hesitated. There was so much she wanted to tell him, but the words seemed stuck in her throat. Finally, she took a deep breath and decided it was time to reveal the truth.

-Lorenzo, I need to talk to you about your mother -she said, feeling the tension rising in the air.

-What about her? -he asked, his worried expression intensifying.

-She's not sick. She's been pretending all this time to keep you close -Amelia explained, feeling her heart race as the words poured out -I've overheard conversations between her and Valeria. They're manipulating the situation to make my life miserable.

Lorenzo's gaze turned cold, and Amelia could see the anger beginning to form.

-What are you talking about? -he asked, his voice tense.

-Lorenzo, you can't keep ignoring what's happening here. Your mother doesn't need care; she just wants to keep you by her side and make me suffer -she said, her voice trembling with anguish.

Lorenzo stared at her, processing the information. Shadows of disbelief and anger crossed his face.

-Amelia, I can't believe you're saying this. My mother has always been a strong woman, and I don't think she's capable of something like that -he responded, though his words sounded hollow.

Amelia felt the disappointment cut through her.

-But she is, Lorenzo. I've lived through this. She's manipulated you, and you haven't seen it -she said, her voice rising -The humiliation I've endured from Valeria and your mother is unbearable. I can't go on like this.

Lorenzo took a step back, as if Amelia's words were a physical blow. Confusion and anger began to mix on his face.

-I can't believe you're telling me this. My mother has been sick and has needed care. How can you be so cruel? -he responded, his voice breaking with emotion.

Amelia felt the rage growing inside her.

-Cruel! -she shouted -Am I the cruel one for wanting you to see the truth? I've been fighting for our marriage while you were away, and she's been using that situation to tear us apart.

The silence that followed was heavy. Lorenzo ran a hand through his hair, frustrated, as emotions swirled inside him.

-I don't know what to think -he responded, his voice shaky-. Please, don't speak ill of my mother.

Amelia felt a stab of desperation. Would she ever be able to make Lorenzo see the truth?

-Lorenzo, please -she implored -I just want you to understand what's really happening. I need your support.

But he seemed lost in his own thoughts, still processing the revelation Amelia had shared.

-I'm going to talk to her -he said finally, his tone determined -I need to hear the truth from her.
###chapter 3: Endless Anguish 
Amelia nodded, feeling a mixture of relief and fear. She knew that confronting her mother-in-law could lead to an explosive confrontation, but at least it was a step towards the truth. As Lorenzo walked towards his mother's room, Amelia felt that a new ###chapter was beginning. The weight of the truth had been revealed, and although she couldn't predict what would happen next, she had at least taken the first step towards freeing herself from the oppression of lies. With her heart pounding, Amelia prepared herself to face the consequences of her revelation, knowing that the struggle for her identity and her place in that family was just beginning.

Amelia felt the tension building in the house as Lorenzo headed towards his mother's room. The air was heavy with uncertainty, and her heart pounded with fear of what might happen. She sat on the couch in the foyer, unable to stay still, waiting for Lorenzo to return with some kind of response. Minutes passed, and the silence became overwhelming. Suddenly, a piercing scream shattered the calm.

-Lorenzo! Help me! -Lorenzo's mother screamed, her voice echoing through the hallways. Amelia jumped to her feet, fear surging in her chest. She ran to her mother-in-law's room and found Lorenzo kneeling beside his mother, who lay on the floor, her eyes closed, with a look of pain on her face.

-Mom! -Lorenzo shouted, panic in his voice as he shook her-. What's wrong with you?

Amelia watched the scene, feeling her stomach churn. Her mother-in-law, despite her state, couldn't hide the look of triumph on her face as Lorenzo held her in his arms.

-Oh, Lorenzo! I think I'm fainting! -his mother sobbed, placing a hand on her forehead like an actress in a tragedy.

Lorenzo, clearly distressed, lifted his mother from the floor and carried her to the bed, where he began to examine her with concern.

-What happened? Why didn't you tell me you felt this way? -he asked, unable to hide the frustration and desperation in his voice.

Amelia felt a lump in her throat as she watched Lorenzo so distraught. Determined to intervene, she stepped forward.

-Lorenzo, I think we should call a doctor -she suggested, but her voice sounded distant, as if she were speaking from another world.

Lorenzo's mother slowly opened her eyes and, with a weak voice, said:

-No, darling, it's not necessary. I just... I just feel a little dizzy. I'm sure it was just a bad moment. It's nothing serious.

Lorenzo looked at her with concern, but the expression on his face began to change.

-Are you sure? -he asked, still with worry etched on his face.

-Of course, darling -his mother replied, her eyes shining with tears-. I just need a little rest. But I think that woman there -she pointed to Amelia- has made me so nervous that it caused my fainting spell.

Amelia felt the betrayal of those words hit her like a bolt of lightning. Lorenzo's mother was manipulating the situation once again.

-What? -Amelia exclaimed, unable to contain herself-. That's not true! I've been trying to take care of you while Lorenzo was away. It's the opposite!

Lorenzo turned to her, and his gaze was filled with confusion and pain.

-How can you say that, Amelia? My mother needs support! You can't talk about her like this right now -he responded, his voice raised, clearly affected.

-Lorenzo, I'm not trying to hurt her. I'm telling the truth -Amelia insisted, her voice trembling-. She's faking it! This is all a game to her!

Lorenzo's mother placed her hand on her chest, pretending to feel even weaker.

-No, darling, don't listen to her. She just wants to drive us apart -she said, tears flowing down her face-. It's always been like this. I can't believe you're doing this to me in my condition.

Lorenzo looked at his mother, then at Amelia, and the conflict in his expression became more evident.

-Amelia, please, this isn't the time for fights. I need to take care of my mother -he said, his voice heavy with frustration-. I don't know what to believe.

Amelia felt rage and sadness intertwine in her chest. The helplessness of not being heard was overwhelming.

-Lorenzo, I don't understand why you can't see what's happening. Your mother is manipulating this situation and poisoning our relationship. I can't take it anymore! -she shouted, feeling the tears begin to escape her eyes.

Lorenzo's mother, seeing the argument unfold, smiled with satisfaction, enjoying the chaos she had caused. It was a game to her, and Amelia was losing.

-Amelia, you need to calm down. This isn't good for either of us -Lorenzo said, approaching his mother and holding her tenderly-. I can't bear to see you like this.

Lorenzo's statement was a direct blow to Amelia. She felt betrayed, as if her own voice had become a whisper amidst a loud argument.

-So you're choosing to stand by your mother instead of believing me? -she asked, feeling her heart break.

Lorenzo frowned, but his mother interrupted.

-Dear, don't listen to her. She just wants to tear us apart. I feel so bad... I can't bear it -she said, placing her hand on her forehead again, as if her life depended on it.

Amelia felt a wave of frustration and pain. The tears began to fall freely as she turned away, feeling the world collapse around her.

-Maybe we should separate for a while -she said, feeling the words escape her like a whisper-. I need time to think.

Lorenzo looked at her in horror, unable to grasp the gravity of her words. His mother, seeing the situation, smiled triumphantly.

-See? That's what she wants. She's trying to drive us apart -she said, seeking to align Lorenzo with her view.

Amelia felt her heart shatter into a thousand pieces as she walked towards the door. Lorenzo's betrayal and his mother's manipulation had left her breathless.

-I can't stay here, Lorenzo. If you don't trust me, then I don't know what we're doing together -her voice broke as she said those words, and before Lorenzo could respond, she walked out of the room, her steps quick, as if running away from him was the only option left to her.

The sound of the door closing echoed through the mansion, a dull thud that seemed to cut through the air. Lorenzo stood still, his eyes fixed on the void that Amelia had left behind. Every corner of the house, which had once been his refuge, now felt heavy, suffocating, as if the building itself were reflecting the fracture between them.

The weight of her words crushed him, and in the silence that followed, Lorenzo's mind filled with unanswered questions. How had they come to this point? He knew that the relationship with his mother was an obstacle, but he had never imagined it would drag them into such a deep abyss. Despite everything, something inside him refused to give in; a confusing mix of love and guilt kept him tied down.

In his chest, the loyalty to his mother, that woman who had cared for him since he was a child and had become his unconditional support, gripped him tightly, like an invisible chain that kept him in place. But the memory of the pain in Amelia's eyes, the desperation in her voice when she tried to explain what she was going through, disarmed him over and over again in a way he never thought possible. His heart was divided, trapped between devotion to his mother and love for his wife. As the storm of emotions battered him every night, a terrifying truth struck him with sharp clarity: if he didn't act soon, he would lose Amelia forever.
###chapter 4: ¿Where is my wife?
Three weeks had passed since Amelia left, since the tension between them exploded in a bitter argument and he, blinded by disbelief, refused to see the truth. He told himself that she just needed time to calm down, to understand things from his perspective. But as the days went by, that justification began to crumble. Guilt consumed him, and the nights were filled with sleeplessness, with the image of Amelia engraved in his mind.

One gray afternoon, unable to bear the uncertainty any longer, Lorenzo decided to search for her. He needed to see her, talk to her, beg if necessary, but he couldn't keep waiting for things to fix themselves. Since the moment he returned from his trip, something hadn't been right. He felt it deep in his soul. However, he never imagined what awaited him when he returned home.

Upon entering, the silence enveloped him like a heavy, oppressive cloak. The house, which once vibrated with Amelia's presence, now felt like a mausoleum of broken memories. Everything was in its place, but the emptiness was palpable, suffocating. Amelia was no longer there.

He walked down the hall, calling her name softly, as if afraid of waking the ghosts of his own negligence. But there was no answer. Each room echoed back his own despair. His steps led him to their bedroom, where the neatly made bed greeted him with the coldness of an unannounced goodbye. He opened the wardrobe, and the blow was immediate: Amelia's clothes were gone. She had left him.

A knot formed in his throat, and for the first time since it all began, Lorenzo realized what had truly happened. This wasn't just a misunderstanding. Amelia wasn't "taking some time" or waiting for him to resolve his own internal dilemmas. She was gone. She had grown tired of waiting, of begging to be heard, of fighting alone against the lies that surrounded them.

In that moment, the weight of his mistake fell on him like a slab. He had let his mother, his fears, and his stubbornness blind him. Amelia had begged him to see the truth, but he had chosen to ignore her, clinging to his mother as if that could keep him safe from facing his own errors. And now, Amelia, the woman he had vowed to protect and love, was gone.

Desperate, he searched for some clue, something that would tell him where she had gone. He rummaged through drawers, notes, any hint that could give him hope, but all he found was emptiness. Amelia had vanished from his life, and he had let her go.

He collapsed onto the bed, his heart pounding in his chest. For the first time, the pain Amelia had shown him became real inside him, tearing at every fiber of his being. There was no going back, no words that could undo the damage. And although he would search for her, although he would find her, he knew that winning back her trust would be the hardest battle of his life.

As the sun set behind the horizon, leaving the house in shadows, Lorenzo understood that the love he had once taken for granted was hanging by a thin, fragile thread. And that thread was getting shorter and shorter.

Later that evening, back at the mansion, while Lorenzo sat in the living room, his mother appeared at the door, leaning on her cane, with that delicate air that made Lorenzo forget, for a moment, the doubts that gnawed at him.

-Have you heard anything about her, dear? -she asked in a soft voice, as if her concern for Amelia were sincere.

Lorenzo shook his head, feeling the guilt suffocating him. His mother looked at him with eyes full of pity, as if she, too, were a victim of it all.

-Amelia couldn't bear my illness, son. I understand, I know how hard it's been for you too -she said with a sadness that seemed genuine-. But you've always been so strong.

He looked at her, feeling a pang in his chest. He knew Amelia had never felt that "affection" his mother spoke of. He knew there was more behind his wife's departure, but how could he distrust his mother in her condition? Her illness was real. It had to be.

While Lorenzo remained trapped in his doubts, Amelia was far away, but not alone. In a luxurious apartment in Paris, she gazed out the window, watching the city shimmer under the glow of the night lights. Beside her, Adrien, her best friend, who had been her unwavering support over the past few years, offered her a glass of wine.

-You're still thinking about him, aren't you? -Adrien asked, a soft but melancholic smile on his lips.

Amelia, or Margaret, as everyone now knew her in the design world, sighed, pulling the glass away from her lips.

-It's not that easy, Adrien. I loved him I love him, but he never believed in me -she confessed, feeling that every word was an open wound.

Adrien looked at her with tenderness, his green eyes reflecting a mix of compassion and something more, something he had never wanted to express aloud. Since he had helped her escape, since he had brought her to Europe and supported her while she relaunched her career under the name Margaret, he had been by her side unconditionally. But he too was caught in a crossroads: the love he felt for Amelia consumed him, but he knew that she still kept Lorenzo in her heart.

-You did the right thing by leaving. He never valued you as you deserved -he said, trying to hide the feeling lurking behind those words.

Amelia looked at him, knowing what he felt, but unable to return it in the way they both wanted. Adrien was her salvation, the friend who appeared when she needed him most. He had taken her from Madrid to Paris, stood by her as she rebuilt her life, becoming the most famous designer in Europe, known for her luxury jewelry, her mystery, and her false name.

-Thank you for everything, Adrien. If it hadn't been for you, I don't know what I would have done -she said sincerely, taking his hand for a moment. But in her mind, the memories of Lorenzo remained alive, like a ghost that refused to disappear.

Adrien smiled at her, though his heart ached.

-Anything for you, Margaret -he replied with a slight tease in his tone, using the name that everyone now knew her by-. But one day, you'll have to leave the past behind. You deserve to be happy, and I don't know if Lorenzo can give you that.

Amelia looked away, biting her lip, her eyes filling with unshed tears.

-Maybe you're right but I can't help but wonder if he if he'll ever see the truth. If he'll understand what I went through because of him.

Adrien set his glass on the table and approached her, taking her hands in his.

-Amelia, don't hold on to what wasn't. You have a new life here. You have success, freedom, and you have someone who values you for who you are.

His words were more than just a statement. They were a declaration, a promise that, if she allowed it, he would love her as Lorenzo never had.

But Amelia couldn't. Not yet.

-Thank you, Adrien. I need time -she whispered, knowing that he would understand.

Meanwhile, far away, Lorenzo was still tangled in a web of emotions. His nights were filled with dreams of Amelia, of her laughter, of her words. And though he tried to convince himself that his mother wasn't lying, each day it became harder to ignore the doubts that grew within him.
###chapter 5: A Harsh Reality
Margaret took a deep breath as the car moved through the streets of Paris. The city lights gleamed through the windows, and the buzz of the evening traffic barely calmed the nerves she felt. In a few minutes, she would arrive at one of the most important meetings of her career as a jewelry designer. The luxury company "Beaumont & Co." wanted to sign a contract to sell her exclusive designs worldwide. It was what she had always dreamed of since adopting the identity of Margaret, the mysterious and enigmatic designer. But although she had everything to be happy, something still weighed on her heart.

She entered the elegant building with a firm step, impeccably dressed in one of her outfits designed by Adrien. Margaret's style had conquered Europe, and this meeting would consolidate it all. She greeted the company's executives, and the meeting began with champagne toasts and compliments toward her collections.

-Your designs are extraordinary, Margaret -said one of the representatives with enthusiasm-. We are eager to work with you. It will be a unique collaboration.

Margaret smiled, thanking every word, but behind that façade of confidence, something wasn't right. For weeks, she had been feeling a strange fatigue, dizziness she couldn't explain. She had tried to ignore them, thinking that the stress of her success and the life she led away from Lorenzo was affecting her more than she wanted to admit. But that afternoon, her body could take no more.

Just when they were about to sign the contract, she felt the world around her start to spin. The room became blurry, and the sound of voices faded. She tried to hold onto the table, but her legs didn't respond.

-Margaret, are you all right? -one of the executives asked with concern, seeing her pale face.

Before she could respond, everything went black.

She woke up in a hospital room, the sound of monitors around her. The smell of disinfectant and fluorescent lights overwhelmed her. When she tried to move, she felt a slight pain in her abdomen. She placed her hand on her stomach, confused. At that moment, Adrien entered the room, his face full of worry.

-Margaret! -he exclaimed upon seeing her awake-. They told me you fainted during the meeting. You have no idea how scared I was.

She tried to smile, but the worry in her eyes was evident. Before she could say anything, a doctor entered the room with her file.

-Mrs. Margaret, we've run some tests. I need to inform you of something important -said the doctor seriously.

Margaret nodded, expecting the worst. She couldn't bear more complications in her life. But what she heard next left her breathless.

-You are pregnant, ma'am. Approximately two months along.

Amelia stared at the white ceiling of the hospital, her hand still resting on her abdomen. The world stopped in that moment. Her mind immediately traveled to Lorenzo, to their last nights together before she decided to leave everything behind and run away. It was Lorenzo's child, no doubt about it. The man she had loved so much, who had caused her so much pain after not believing in her, was still tied to her life, even when she had tried to escape. Tears began to roll down her cheeks, unable to contain the storm of emotions that consumed her.

How could this be happening now? Everything she had built as Margaret, her independence, her success, seemed to collapse all at once. A life was growing inside her, a life that tied her forever to Lorenzo.

Adrien, who had remained silent upon hearing the news, slowly approached, a mix of surprise and pain on his face.

-Amelia -he whispered, using her real name for the first time in a long time-. Is it Lorenzo's?

She nodded, unable to speak. Adrien closed his eyes, as if trying to process what he had just heard, but he knew he couldn't compete with the weight of that bond that would never break.

-Adrien -she said through tears, trying to breathe-. I don't know what to do. Lorenzo can't find out Not now.

Meanwhile, back in the mansion in Madrid, Lorenzo was living his own hell. His company, which had been his pride for years, was beginning to fall apart. The wrong decisions, lost contracts, everything seemed tied to his inability to focus. Ever since Amelia left, everything in his life had started to crumble. He couldn't think of anything other than her disappearance, the guilt, the uncertainty of not knowing if she would ever return.

That morning, his assistant, worried about the state of the company, entered his office with a report.

-Mr. Lorenzo, the shareholders are concerned -he said, placing the report on the desk-. We've lost several important clients, and the company can't sustain itself like this for much longer.

Lorenzo looked at him without really listening. His mind was elsewhere. On Amelia. On her last words before she left. "I can't stay here, not while you remain blind to what's happening." He had failed to see her, to understand her pain, and now he was paying the price.

-I don't care about the company -he finally replied, in a cold and distant tone.

-What are you saying? -the assistant asked, incredulous-. The company is everything you've built.

Lorenzo stood up abruptly from his chair, feeling an uncontrollable anger. What was the point of everything he had built if he couldn't have Amelia back? He couldn't think clearly, couldn't make decisions. His life, his company, everything was shattered.

-Without Amelia, none of this matters -he said quietly, as he walked to the window, looking at the gray sky that mirrored his mood.

At that moment, his mother entered the room. Mrs. Isabel, though she still pretended to be fragile, couldn't hide the satisfaction of seeing Lorenzo so dependent on her.

Her son was destroyed, and although she pretended to comfort him, she actually enjoyed having him by her side, relying on her attention.

-Don't worry, my son -she said softly, though her smile was colder than Lorenzo could see-. I'll always be here for you. Amelia didn't deserve you, I told you from the start. She wasn't strong enough for you.

Lorenzo clenched his fists, feeling how his mother wrapped him in her web. But this time, something inside him resisted. Something about her words felt hollow, as if behind that sweetness there was a dark intention.

That night, Lorenzo wandered through the mansion, watching his mother from the door of the living room. Mrs. Isabel was lying on the couch, pretending weakness, but something didn't add up. Ever since Amelia left, his mother seemed strangely revitalized. There was something in her tone of voice, in the way she moved, that didn't match the image of a sick woman. "Amelia said she was faking it," Lorenzo thought, feeling a knot form in his stomach. "What if she was right?" He recalled the arguments, Amelia's pleas for him to believe her. He had been blind, he realized. Blind in his devotion to his mother, unable to see how she manipulated everything around her. What if Amelia hadn't run away because she didn't love him, but because she couldn't endure the lies anymore?

As Lorenzo battled his internal storm, Amelia, or Margaret, wrestled between her new life and the unexpected discovery that she carried a part of Lorenzo within her. A life that irrevocably tied her to her past, despite her efforts to escape.
###chapter 6: The collaboration
In Paris, as Adrien stayed by her side, she couldn't help but think about what she would do. Could she continue to hide the truth? Or would she have to face the past that had caused her so much pain? A new life was growing inside her, but her heart remained divided between love, guilt, and fear.

Amelia rose from the hospital bed with more effort than she had expected. Although the doctors recommended she stay for a few more days for observation, she couldn't afford to stay. She had to return to her life as Margaret before everything began to unravel. With Adrien by her side, she walked down the hallway toward the exit, her trembling hand still resting on her abdomen, constantly aware of the life growing inside her.

-Are you sure you don't want to rest more? -Adrien asked in a soft, but concerned voice.

Amelia nodded, trying to seem stronger than she felt. The uncertainty had worn her down, but the fear of Lorenzo discovering the truth consumed her faster than any physical exhaustion.

-I can't stay here, Adrien -she said, her voice cracking slightly-. If I stay, everything will get even more complicated. I need time to think, to decide what to do about all of this.

Adrien watched her carefully as they left the hospital into the cold Parisian air. The wind hit her face, and a shiver ran through her body, but it wasn't just the weather that made her tremble. She knew that with each step, she was moving farther away from Lorenzo, but at the same time, closer to a decision she could no longer postpone.

They got into the car in silence, while the city passed quickly in front of them. Amelia stared at the lights of Paris, which shone with a serenity that contrasted with the storm inside her. Thoughts about the baby, Lorenzo, and their future suffocated her.

-Amelia... -Adrien broke the silence as he drove-. Have you thought about what you're going to do with the baby? You know you can count on me, no matter what you decide.

Adrien's words were kind, but they weighed on her like a sentence. She knew he would support her no matter what, but that didn't make the decision any easier.

-I don't know, Adrien -she whispered, looking at her clasped hands-. I don't know what to do. This changes everything. I can't keep pretending I can walk away from my past as if it never existed. But I also don't know if I can face Lorenzo or if he deserves to know.

Adrien gripped the steering wheel, trying to contain his own feelings. Though he had promised to support her, the thought that Lorenzo would always have a part of Amelia, a part of her life that he could never reach, was unbearable.

Finally, they arrived at the apartment they shared. Adrien hurried to open the door for her, but Amelia remained at the entrance, her gaze lost on the horizon of the city.

-Amelia -Adrien said softly, approaching her-. You don't have to make any decisions now. What matters is that you're okay.

Amelia nodded, grateful for Adrien's patience, but inside, she knew that time was running out. Soon, she would have to face the truth: Lorenzo, her pregnancy, and the life she could never forget. She walked into the apartment with a lump in her throat, knowing that although she had left the hospital, her real struggle was only beginning.

Years had passed. Since Amelia's departure, Lorenzo's life had taken a turn for the worse. Rumors about his company, once an empire, circulated around Madrid. No one knew exactly what had happened, but those close to Lorenzo noticed his distraction and the constant melancholy in his eyes. Now, he was on the verge of bankruptcy.

His company, which had once dominated the fashion and luxury design market, had lost its shine, and Lorenzo's erratic decisions had only accelerated its downfall. Poor investments, the loss of key clients, and Lorenzo's inability to focus after Amelia's departure had brought him to this point. There was only one chance left: a new project with one of the most prestigious jewelry designers of the moment, Margaret.

Sitting in his office, Lorenzo stared at the financial documents on the table. He knew he was losing control of everything he had once built. Failure surrounded him, but there was one opportunity, a small glimmer of hope that had presented itself: a new collaboration with Margaret.

-This designer has revolutionized the market in recent years -his assistant said, handing him a folder with Margaret's designs-. If we manage to work with her, it could be the boost we need to get out of this crisis.

Lorenzo flipped through the designs. Something about them felt eerily familiar. The elegant lines, the combination of modern and classic styles. He lingered on one piece in particular: a delicate necklace that reminded him of something Amelia had sketched once.

-Margaret -he whispered thoughtfully-. Who exactly is she?

-She's a mystery -replied the assistant-. No one knows much about her, only that she's very private and never appears in public. But her designs have been an overwhelming success. If we manage to work with her, we could recover.

Lorenzo nodded, determined. This was his last chance. He couldn't afford to fail. He had to contact Margaret.

In Paris, Amelia -now known only as Margaret- had reached the pinnacle of success. Her jewelry was sold worldwide, and her name was synonymous with elegance and sophistication. She had built her life far from Lorenzo and Madrid, but she had never completely forgotten her past.

One morning, while reviewing new contracts and proposals, her personal assistant placed a letter on her desk.

-This one's from a company in Madrid. They're interested in a collaboration.

Amelia picked up the letter absentmindedly, but as she read the sender's name, her heart skipped a beat: "the letter was from Lorenzo's company."

Her hands trembled slightly as her eyes scanned the proposal. Lorenzo was desperate, seeking a collaboration with her to save his company. However, there was no mention of Amelia. He had no idea that Margaret and his wife were the same person.

-Is everything okay? -her assistant asked, noticing the sudden silence.

-Yes -Amelia responded, regaining her composure-. It's just an interesting proposal.

She decided she would respond. Perhaps this was the opportunity she needed to confront her past, but without revealing her true identity yet.

Back in Madrid, Lorenzo was nervous. Margaret's response had arrived, and she was willing to hear his proposal. They had arranged a virtual meeting to discuss the details. Lorenzo anxiously adjusted his suit, knowing this was a unique opportunity to save everything he had left.

The screen lit up, showing Margaret's silhouette. Though she didn't reveal her face completely, the elegance in her posture and the firmness of her voice impressed him.

-Mr. Lorenzo -Margaret said in a cold and professional tone-. I've reviewed your proposal. There may be a possibility for collaboration, but I need more details about your vision for this project.

Lorenzo tried to maintain his composure.

-Mrs. Margaret, your work is admirable. I believe that together we could create something that could save my company. Your style would fit perfectly with what I need. It's a unique opportunity for both of us.

Amelia listened carefully, feeling a mix of emotions. Three years had passed, but hearing Lorenzo's voice transported her back to a life she had tried to forget. She knew he wouldn't recognize her, but that didn't make the confrontation any easier.

-I need time to think about it -Margaret finally said-. This is a big commitment, and I want to make sure it benefits both of us.

Lorenzo nodded, grateful he hadn't been rejected outright.

After the meeting, Amelia stared at her reflection in the mirror. "Could I really help Lorenzo, after everything that had happened?" She knew his company was on the verge of collapse, and her designs could save it, but the pain from her past held her back.

At the same time, Lorenzo felt uneasy. Something about Margaret's voice reminded him of Amelia. There was something in the way she spoke, in the confidence with which she handled business, that seemed strangely familiar. But he quickly dismissed the thought. "Amelia was no longer part of his life." Or so he believed.

After much thought, Amelia decided to accept Lorenzo's proposal, but under strict conditions: there would be no face-to-face meetings, only virtual contact. She knew that the closer she got to Lorenzo, the harder it would be to keep her identity hidden.

Desperate, Lorenzo accepted without hesitation. He didn't know he was about to step into a dangerous game, one in which the truth would eventually come to light.
###chapter 7: The Past Never Leaves
The autumn sun filtered through the silk curtains of the elegant Paris apartment. Amelia, now known as Margaret, watched from the window as her son, Mateo, played with his toys on the living room rug. His laughter filled the space, but Amelia's heart was torn between the joy of seeing him happy and the pain his very existence caused her. At three years old, Mateo was a living reflection of Lorenzo, both in appearance and mannerisms. Every day, watching him grow was a constant reminder of what she had left behind.

Despite the distance she had placed between her life and the man who had once been her husband, the last few months had brought her dangerously close to Lorenzo again. The collaboration between her company and his had been an initial success, but the constant virtual meetings and emails kept her teetering on the edge. Lorenzo had no idea that the woman saving his company was the same woman he had abandoned.

That morning, as she prepared breakfast for Mateo, she heard a question that caught her completely off guard.

-Mom -said Mateo, without looking away from his toys-, where is Dad?

Amelia felt the air leave her lungs for a moment. The question echoed in her chest like an unexpected blow. She had tried, for all three years of her son's life, to keep the truth hidden, to protect him from the pain of a story he was too young to understand. But there he was, staring at her with those same eyes that had once loved her... and destroyed her.

-Mateo... -Amelia tried to keep her voice steady, but her trembling hands betrayed her-. Dad isn't with us.

The boy tilted his head, confused by her answer. He didn't understand the complexities of the adult world but could sense the pain in his mother's gaze.

-Is he somewhere else? -he insisted, innocent as only a child could be.

Amelia closed her eyes for a moment, fighting back the tears that threatened to escape. She knew that one day she would have to tell him the truth. She would have to explain that his father, Lorenzo, was not just a powerful man but also the man who had once loved her, only to leave her alone in her darkest hour. That his father, unknowingly, had lost more than he could ever imagine.

-Yes, he's somewhere else -she finally said, gently stroking the boy's hair-. But we'll always have each other.

Mateo nodded, as if that answer were enough for now, and returned his attention to his toy train. Amelia, however, couldn't shake the feeling of being trapped between two worlds: the past that refused to let her go and the present she had fought so hard to build.

Hours later, when Amelia arrived at her studio, the clock marked the time for her next virtual meeting with Lorenzo. She took a deep breath before clicking on the screen to connect. Lorenzo's face appeared before her, more gaunt and tired than the last time she had seen him in person. The years without her seemed to have weakened him, though his gaze was still as intense as ever.

-Mr. Lorenzo -said Margaret with a cold, professional tone, hiding any trace of emotion-. I've reviewed the progress on the latest designs. I'm ready to discuss the next steps.

Lorenzo, unaware of the whirlwind of emotions behind that voice, nodded appreciatively. Every time he spoke with Margaret, he couldn't help but feel drawn to her confidence and business acumen, but there was something about her that vaguely reminded him of someone... someone he didn't dare name.

-Thank you, Margaret -Lorenzo replied, using the same formal tone he had adopted in recent meetings-. Your work has been invaluable to us. Honestly, I don't know how we could have continued without your help.

Amelia felt a knot form in her stomach. She knew her work was helping to save Lorenzo's company, but she also knew that every step she took in this collaboration brought her dangerously close to the truth. Lorenzo was closer to her than he realized, and at the same time, he couldn't have been further away.

-I'll be waiting for the changes you request -she responded, hoping to end the conversation quickly.

-Margaret, there's something I wanted to ask you -Lorenzo said suddenly, stopping her from disconnecting.

Amelia tensed. There was something different about his tone, more personal.

-Go ahead -she replied, maintaining her professional facade.

-Your voice reminds me of someone -Lorenzo said, almost in a whisper, as if revealing a long-kept secret-. I know this sounds strange, but every time I speak with you, I can't shake the feeling that I've met you before. Is it possible we've crossed paths before?

Amelia felt the ground crumble beneath her feet. Her heart raced, and for a second, she considered ending the call, fleeing before the truth surfaced. But instead, she took a deep breath and regained her composure.

-No, Mr. Lorenzo -she said firmly-. We've never met before. This is purely a business relationship.

Lorenzo looked at her through the screen, a mix of confusion and doubt in his expression. But finally, he nodded.

-You're right -he said, though his tone was not entirely convincing-. It must just be my imagination.

Amelia ended the call quickly, feeling as though she had been on the verge of collapse. She sank into her chair, exhausted, as her thoughts swirled around her. How much longer could she keep hiding the truth? Lorenzo was already starting to suspect, and sooner or later, the pieces would fall into place. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was playing a dangerous game from which she wouldn't emerge unscathed.

That night, as she watched Mateo sleep in his crib, Amelia couldn't help but wonder if her decision to keep Lorenzo in the dark had been the right one. She knew she was protecting her son, but she also knew that Lorenzo, in his desperation, wouldn't stop until he uncovered the truth.

Across the continent, in Madrid, Lorenzo stared at the empty screen after Margaret disconnected. A restlessness had followed him since their first meeting, and though he refused to admit it, something about her felt disturbingly familiar. He couldn't shake the feeling that Margaret and Amelia shared more than he knew, but he quickly dismissed the thought. Amelia was no longer part of his life, he told himself. Or at least, that's what he believed.

Lorenzo lay down in the bed of his desolate bedroom. Every corner of the room reminded him of Amelia, of the nights they had spent together, of the words left unsaid. Since she left, his life had lost its meaning. He had failed to sustain his empire, failed to understand the pain she had endured under the same roof as him, and now, night after night, guilt and regret kept him awake.
###chapter 8: Letters to Amelia
Before turning off the light, he took out his worn leather notebook from the drawer. It was a ritual he had begun after Amelia's disappearance: writing her a letter every night, letters he would never send. His pen, an instrument of silent confession, glided over the paper with an almost imperceptible whisper, as the words he dared not speak aloud filled the pages.

-Dear Amelia, -he began, as he did every night. -I know you will never receive this letter, and perhaps it's better that way. But I still feel the need to talk to you, even if it's from a distance, even if it's on this paper you will never read.

He sighed, pausing for a second. What else could he say to her that he hadn't already said in his thoughts, in his dreams, in his despair? Every word seemed futile against the chasm that had opened between them, but writing allowed him to keep her close, at least in his mind.

-Today, I thought of you more than usual. I felt your presence in every corner of this empty house. Sometimes I wonder if you knew how much I loved you, how much I still love you. It hurts to know I didn't believe you, that I wasn't the man you needed. Every day, I'm tormented by the idea that you left because of me, because of my blindness and my misplaced loyalty to my mother. I failed you, Amelia. I know it's too late for regrets, but not a single day passes without me wondering where you are, how you are, if I will ever get the chance to ask for your forgiveness.

He stopped for a moment, his trembling hands resting on the notebook. It was an exercise in pain, but also in hope. Deep in his heart, he still harbored the fantasy that one day Amelia would return. That she would come home, forgive him, and they could heal together. But that hope grew fainter with each passing day.

-I don't know if I'll ever find you, if I'll ever be able to look into your eyes and tell you what I should have told you when you were still here. It hurts to know that you've probably built a new life, a life without me. And if that's the case, I will accept it, but I wanted you to know that every night, before I sleep, I think of you. And I will keep writing to you, even if you never read my words, even if fate never brings us together again. You will always be my Amelia.

With a lump in his throat, Lorenzo closed the notebook and placed it back in the drawer. The letters had silently accumulated over three years, a collection of regrets and words that would never leave his mouth. He turned off the light, but the emptiness in his bed was heavier than any darkness.

He knew that the next day he would return to his daily battle to save his company, but he also knew that at the end of each day, he would continue writing. Because it was the only way he could keep Amelia alive in his heart.

While Lorenzo wrote his letter, across the continent, Amelia was trying to fall asleep. If only she knew that the man she thought she had left behind thought of her every night, perhaps her decisions would have been different. But for now, they were both trapped in their own loneliness, united only by the memories of a love that still burned silently.

The next day began with a storm on the horizon in Paris, dark clouds that seemed to mirror the emotional turmoil nesting in Amelia's heart. While Mateo played in his room, she tried to focus on her work, but her mind kept drifting to the meeting she would have with Lorenzo that afternoon. The truth pressed heavily on her chest, as if an invisible thread tied her to him, a thread she couldn't break no matter how hard she tried.

She decided to distract herself and immersed herself in the jewelry designs she had been creating. Pearls and diamonds gleamed under the dim studio light, but as she delved into her work, memories of Lorenzo flooded her mind again-the way he smiled, the sparkle in his eyes when they shared laughter, the stolen moments that now felt so distant.

Finally, the time for the meeting arrived, bringing with it a mix of nervousness and determination. She connected to the video call, and Lorenzo's face appeared on the screen, more serious and worried this time. His expression revealed the weight he carried on his shoulders.

-Margaret, -Lorenzo began, his tone betraying his anxiety, -we've had some issues with our suppliers. I don't know how we can move forward without your vision.

Amelia felt a lump in her throat. Every word Lorenzo said resonated in her heart, and although she knew she had to keep her distance, the love she still felt for him made her want to help him in any way possible.

-Lorenzo, I have some ideas that might work. If we work together, we could find a solution, -she said, trying to keep her voice steady.

He momentarily brightened, that familiar spark in his eyes making her wish things were different.

-Thank you, Margaret. Your perspective has always been invaluable to me.

As they discussed strategies, Amelia realized their connection was stronger than she had imagined. Every interaction with Lorenzo seemed to rekindle the feelings she thought she had buried. However, the truth she was hiding grew heavier with every word they exchanged.

When the meeting ended, Lorenzo seemed hesitant, as if something else was weighing on his mind.

-Margaret, there's something I want to say... -he began, but suddenly, his gaze shifted, and concern crossed his face. -I'm not sure if I should.

Amelia felt her pulse quicken. Could it be possible he was starting to suspect?

-Please, tell me. I'm here to help, -she replied, even though part of her wanted him to stop.

Lorenzo took a deep breath and rubbed his forehead, as if searching for the right words.

-It's just that... ever since this collaboration began, I've had the feeling that... that I know you from somewhere. And it's strange because I can't remember where or when.

Amelia's heart pounded. She couldn't let Lorenzo reach that conclusion, not when the truth could destroy them both.

-It's possible you've heard my voice somewhere else, Lorenzo. Many people have similar voices, -she said, trying to downplay the situation.

He nodded, though his eyes still reflected doubt. The moment grew tense, and Amelia felt the air leave her lungs. She decided to change the subject.

-Let's talk about the designs. I think we have an opportunity with this new line, and we could attract new customers, -she suggested, focusing on work.

As they spoke, however, she couldn't help but wonder what would happen if the truth came to light. If Lorenzo discovered that Margaret was really Amelia, everything she had built over these years would crumble, and she wasn't sure she could bear the pain of that revelation.

The following day, fate had an unexpected twist in store for her...
###chapter 9: A Very Risky Event
The following day, fate had an unexpected twist in store for her. A message from Lorenzo jolted her out of her daydream: an invitation to a jewelry exhibition in Paris, where Margaret would be recognized as one of the most promising designers in the industry. Amelia felt time stop.

The invitation came with a crucial detail: attendees were required to wear a mask, a tradition at the event, which would allow Amelia to hide her identity from Lorenzo. Still, she knew it would be an opportunity to finally bridge the gap between her current life and the past she couldn't leave behind.

On the day of the exhibition, as she got ready, she looked in the mirror and saw the woman she had fought so hard to become. The Amelia she had been had transformed into Margaret, but the essence remained the same. The sparkle of her jewelry reflected her resilience and determination. When she put on the mask, she felt a mixture of fear and freedom. It was the perfect opportunity to face Lorenzo without revealing her true identity.

At the exhibition, excitement filled the air. Designers, artists, and critics from all over the world gathered to celebrate creativity and innovation. Amelia knew Lorenzo would also attend, and her heart raced at the thought of the moment they would meet again.

The room was full of bright lights and laughter, but for Amelia, the noise faded when her eyes met Lorenzo's. Time stopped for a moment. They slowly approached each other, and when they were just a few steps away, reality took over.

-Margaret -Lorenzo said, his voice filled with emotion and confusion. -I can't believe you're here.

Amelia smiled, trying to hide the chaos she felt inside. The mask hid her face, but she couldn't conceal the connection that still existed between them.

-Lorenzo, it's an honor for me that you're here -she replied, trying to stay calm while the past and present clashed in her heart.

They both stood in silence, staring at each other, as if searching for answers in each other's eyes. The murmur of the exhibition faded, and all that existed was the shared moment, the echo of memories, and unfulfilled dreams.

It seemed that fate had decided to intertwine their paths once more, and Amelia realized that she wouldn't be able to escape the truth for much longer. A new ###chapter was about to begin, one that could change their lives forever.

The jewelry exhibition was filled with dazzling lights and murmurs of admiration as guests walked around the displayed pieces. Amelia, still wearing her mask, felt trapped in a web of emotions. She knew facing Lorenzo was inevitable, but she hadn't expected to also run into Isabel, her ex-mother-in-law.

While Lorenzo focused on presenting the new pieces, Mateo had managed to slip away from Adrien when he wasn't paying attention. The little boy, full of curiosity, ventured through the hall, admiring the colors and sparkles of the surrounding jewelry. Without realizing where he was headed, he found himself in the center of the commotion.

Suddenly, Mateo bumped into an imposing figure. Isabel, moving with the grace of a woman accustomed to being the center of attention, stopped dead when she felt the impact.

-Ouch! -Isabel exclaimed, looking at the child in disbelief. Her surprise quickly turned into confusion and, finally, fear. The resemblance between Mateo and Lorenzo was striking, and the image of her son's face flooded her mind.

Mateo, stunned by the collision, looked up. -I'm sorry! -he said sincerely, not knowing who he had bumped into.

Isabel stood frozen, unable to take her eyes off the child. Something in his eyes and his laughter stirred memories she had buried, and her heart began to race. She felt uneasy, as if a forbidden truth was staring her in the face.

-Who are you? -Isabel asked, her voice trembling slightly as she tried to control her shock.

Mateo, confused, shrugged. -I'm Mateo. I'm just playing here.

Isabel felt a shiver run down her spine. Mateo that name echoed in her mind like a reminder of a past she couldn't ignore. "It can't be," she thought, unable to accept the idea that this child, who seemed so small and vulnerable, could be connected to her son.

-Mateo? -Isabel repeated, her voice barely a whisper.

Mateo, unaware of the impact of his name, smiled innocently. -Yes, do you like my toys? -he said, holding up a small toy train in his hand.

Isabel's heart sank further as she saw the similarity between the train and the one Lorenzo had had as a child. Her mind was in a whirlwind. "No, it can't be," she thought, struggling to keep her composure.

Lorenzo, who had been talking to other guests, sensed that something was wrong when he saw his mother standing there, in shock, staring at Mateo. He approached, wondering what had happened.

-What's going on, Mom? -Lorenzo asked, noticing the paleness in Isabel's face.

She turned to him, still staring at Mateo. -This child he looks so much like you. It's strange.

Mateo, sensing the tension in the air, looked at Lorenzo curiously. -Is she your mom? -he asked, innocent and happy.

Isabel, unable to contain herself any longer, crouched down and moved toward the boy, but instead of feeling comforted by the connection, her heart filled with panic. -No, you shouldn't be here -she said, her voice firmer than she intended. The idea that Lorenzo had a child in secret terrified her.

-Why? -Mateo asked, confused by the woman's reaction.

Lorenzo stepped between them, his worried expression growing more intense. -What's going on here? -he asked, but his mother ignored him, focusing solely on the child.

-Who is your mother? -Isabel asked, trying to control her voice, but feeling the truth slipping away from her.

Mateo, not understanding the seriousness of the situation, smiled innocently. -I don't know. I just know I like to play.

Isabel felt a knot in her stomach. She turned to Lorenzo, searching for answers, but he was just as confused. Not knowing that Mateo was his son, the pain in his eyes was evident.

-Mom, this doesn't make sense -Lorenzo said, feeling increasingly frustrated. He didn't understand the connection his mother seemed to see, but something in Mateo's face unsettled him.

The tension in the air was palpable. Isabel looked at Mateo once more, feeling that every feature of the child brought her closer to a truth she didn't want to accept. -You shouldn't be here, child -she finally said, turning away, her heart racing and her mind clouded with fear.

Lorenzo, watching his mother walk away, felt a shadow fall over him. Something was wrong. There was something in the connection between her and this child that he couldn't understand, but the fear in Isabel's expression unsettled him.

While Mateo stood there, confused and looking around, Amelia reappeared, searching for her son. Seeing Lorenzo with the child, her heart raced. She approached quickly, recognizing the discomfort in the atmosphere.

-What happened? -she asked, her gaze fixed on Mateo, who smiled at her.

-I don't know, but I think Mom got scared -Lorenzo replied, feeling more and more overwhelmed.

Amelia felt a pang of worry shoot through her. She knew the moment of truth was approaching, and that her past was intertwining with the present in ways they could no longer ignore.
###chapter 10: The Confusion
  
As the exhibition continued around them, both parents were facing a new and complex reality. Amelia knew she could no longer hide the truth. The path to revelation was in sight, and her world was about to collapse.

At that moment, Adrien appeared on the scene, looking for Mateo. Upon seeing the boy, he knelt down and hugged him.

-Mateo! -Adrien said joyfully as the little boy ran into his arms.

-Dad! -Mateo exclaimed, his voice full of excitement.

Lorenzo felt the air leave his lungs. "Dad?" he thought, feeling the world crumble around him. The idea that this man was Margaret's partner, and that there was also a child calling him "Dad," left him stunned.

Amelia noticed the confusion on Lorenzo's face, but she couldn't stop now. The revelation of her son and his connection to Adrien were intertwined in a moment that would change everything.

Lorenzo looked at Adrien, feeling bewildered. The connection between them grew increasingly complex, and his mind swirled with unanswered questions.

While the event continued around them, both parents faced a new and complicated reality. Amelia knew she could no longer hide the truth. The path to revelation was in sight, and her world was about to collapse.

The sparkle of the exhibited jewelry and the lively voices of the attendees filled the room, but Lorenzo could barely focus on what was happening around him. His mind was trapped in a single thought: Margaret. The enigmatic designer who had rescued his company from the brink of collapse, always hidden behind a mask, and whose relationship with Adrien disturbed him deeply.

From the moment Adrien had become involved in his life, Lorenzo had noticed the closeness between him and Margaret. The fact that Adrien was such a trusted confidant for her irritated him. What was between them? Lorenzo felt that Adrien was hiding something important, and that uncertainty gnawed at him.

Lorenzo watched Margaret from afar, her elegant poise and the way she moved through the room unsettled him. He felt an inexplicable attraction toward her, one he couldn't ignore, but at the same time, suspicion and mystery kept him teetering on the edge of distrust. There was something about the way she interacted with Adrien that made him feel excluded, as if they shared secrets he would never know.

Finally, unable to endure the doubt any longer, he decided to confront her. He crossed the room with determined steps and approached her.

-Margaret -he said, his voice firm but restrained.

She turned to him gracefully, her eyes shining through the mask. Despite the disguise, Lorenzo could feel the intensity of her gaze. For a moment, they both remained silent, surrounded by the murmurs of the crowd.

-Lorenzo -she responded calmly, maintaining her composure.

-I need answers -he said, his frustration beginning to surface-. I don't know who you really are or what you're doing here. You've saved my company, but you remain a mystery. And there's something else... -he paused, trying to keep his emotions in check-. What is your relationship with Adrien?

Margaret looked at him with an unsettling calm, but inside, Amelia felt the tension invade her. She knew this moment would come, the moment Lorenzo began asking questions. But she couldn't let him uncover the truth, not when there was still so much at stake.

-My relationship with Adrien is none of your business, Lorenzo -she replied firmly-. I've helped you, and that's all that matters right now.

Lorenzo frowned, his frustration becoming more palpable. He stepped closer, closing the distance between them.

-No, Margaret -he retorted-. It's not just that. I know there's more; I can feel it. Every time I see Adrien with you, I feel like I'm missing something important. I need to know what's going on between you two.

Amelia's heart pounded beneath the mask. She knew Lorenzo wouldn't give up easily, but she couldn't let him see beyond the façade she had built. Her entire plan depended on keeping her identity hidden and preventing Lorenzo from discovering the truth.

-You're mistaken -she said in a tone meant to be final-. There's nothing you need to know about Adrien and me. What matters now is the work we've done together to save your company.

-And why should I trust someone who won't even show me their face? -Lorenzo snapped, his tone harsher. He was tired of the secrets, of the half-truths surrounding him for so long-. You can't keep hiding behind that mask, Margaret. I want to know who you really are.

Margaret remained silent for a few seconds; the tension between them was palpable. Amelia knew she was on the verge of a dangerous revelation. If Lorenzo persisted, everything she had built could crumble in an instant.

-We don't always have the luxury of revealing who we are -she said softly, trying to use her tone to diffuse the situation-. Some secrets are necessary.

Lorenzo stared at her, trying to unravel the layers of mystery surrounding her. But before he could say more, a group of people approached to admire the jewelry on display. The moment broke, and Margaret took advantage of the distraction to walk away, leaving him with unanswered questions and a sense of emptiness.

As he watched her disappear into the crowd, Lorenzo's frustration only grew. He knew there was something deeper connecting Margaret and Adrien, but without the answers he needed, he was trapped in a web of uncertainty that suffocated him. His determination to uncover the truth only grew, and though Margaret had managed to evade him for now, Lorenzo knew this shadowy game wouldn't last forever.

The bustle of the hall began to fade as the banquet drew to a close. Mateo, always curious, had been wandering around the tables laden with sweets and desserts, but his mind was still on the incident he had had earlier in the night. He couldn't stop thinking about the elderly woman he had accidentally bumped into. Though she hadn't shown any annoyance, something in her gaze left him with an unease he couldn't ignore.

Determined to apologize, Mateo took one of the prettiest desserts from the table, a small fruit tart with cream that had caught his eye. Holding it carefully in his small hands, he headed toward the quieter part of the hall, where he remembered last seeing the elderly woman.
###chapter 11: Grandmother and Grandson
Finally, he found her sitting in a chair by a window, away from the bustle of the other guests. The moonlight illuminated her wrinkled and serene face as she quietly watched the night. Mateo paused for a moment, nervous, but then moved forward with determination.

-Excuse me -he said shyly, extending the dessert towards her-. I wanted to give you this. I'm really sorry for bumping into you earlier... I didn't mean to be rude.

The elderly woman looked up, her gray eyes gleaming with surprise and tenderness as she saw the boy in front of her. Her smile, slow and warm, deepened the wrinkles on her face but also gave her an unexpected air of youth.

-Oh, dear -she replied softly, like a whisper-. You have nothing to apologize for. It was just a little accident. But I really appreciate your kindness.

Mateo, a bit relieved by the woman's response, handed her the dessert, and she took it with trembling but firm hands.

-It's a very lovely cake -the elderly woman commented-. You know, these used to be my favorites when I was young. My mother used to make them for me on special occasions.

The boy smiled, glad that his gesture was appreciated. But what surprised him most was the warmth that had formed between them, as if they were connected in some way, despite barely knowing each other.

-Would you like me to stay for a while? -Mateo asked, with his usual curiosity-. I don't like it when people are alone, and you seem to be.

The elderly woman looked at him with eyes full of affection and nodded gently, pointing to the chair beside her. Mateo climbed up and settled in, his legs dangling off the edge of the chair, and watched her attentively as they began to talk.

After a while, the elderly woman leaned slightly toward him.

-You shouldn't be walking around alone here, little one. I'll take you to your mother -she said in a serious tone, standing up with more ease than Mateo had expected. Her posture was firm, and though she used a cane, it seemed she didn't need it as much as he had imagined.

Mateo nodded confidently and took her hand. The elderly woman guided him through the hall, avoiding tables and people, toward the place where she knew Margaret was. But as they got closer, the atmosphere changed. Mateo felt a tension in the air, and when he saw Margaret from a distance, he noticed that she also felt it.

Margaret, with her characteristic mask, was talking to some guests, but when their eyes met, her posture stiffened. Her heart began to beat faster, the pressure of the situation overwhelming her. How had Mateo ended up talking to this woman? Her protective instinct kicked in immediately, though she couldn't fully understand why.

The elderly woman stopped in front of Margaret, with a firm and penetrating gaze that cut through any barrier.

-Here is your son -the elderly woman said, her voice sharp, devoid of the sweetness she had shown toward Mateo earlier-. You shouldn't leave him alone in such a crowded place.

Margaret felt a wave of tension run through her body. She pressed her lips tightly beneath her mask and leaned down toward her son, gripping his hand firmly.

-Thank you for bringing him -she replied, her tone controlled, though the discomfort was evident.

The elderly woman did not move. She watched Margaret for a few more seconds, as if she wanted to say something else, something hidden behind her wise and ancient eyes. The hardness in her face didn't disappear, and Margaret felt as if she were being judged in a way she couldn't fully understand.

-It's easy to hide behind a mask, dear -the elderly woman said, her words like soft knives-. But you can't hide from everything. Especially not from what really matters.

The comment made Margaret tense even more. The elderly woman seemed to know more than she let on, as if she could see beyond the facade Margaret had carefully built. Uncertainty flooded her, but she forced herself not to show any reaction beyond what was necessary.

Before Margaret could respond, the elderly woman turned toward Mateo, and suddenly, her expression changed. The hardness disappeared, and an infinite warmth covered her once again. She bent slightly to be at his level and gently stroked his head.

-It's been a pleasure to meet you, little one. Take good care of yourself, and don't forget what I told you. You have a heart full of light.

Mateo smiled, once again feeling that inexplicable connection with the elderly woman, as she returned his smile, now full of love and tenderness.

-Thank you -the boy said-. I hope to see you again.

The elderly woman nodded and, after one last look full of affection, turned and slowly walked away. But instead of heading toward the exit, she vanished into the crowd of the hall, as if she had never been there.

Margaret looked at her son and then at the place where the elderly woman had disappeared. Something about that woman had deeply unsettled her. But she couldn't afford to lose her composure, not now. She gripped Mateo's hand tighter and leaned down toward him.

-Let's go, darling -she said softly, though her mind was still trapped in the intense interaction she had just experienced.

As they walked away, a sense of discomfort lingered in the air. Margaret couldn't shake the feeling that the elderly woman knew more than she had let on. And although she hadn't said anything specific, her words echoed strongly in her mind, planting a seed of doubt and confusion.
 ###chapter 12: Among Shadows and Sweet Encounters
The brilliance of the displayed jewels and the animated voices of the attendees filled the hall, but Lorenzo could barely focus on what was happening around him. His mind was trapped in a single thought: Margaret. The enigmatic designer who had saved his company from the brink of collapse, always hidden behind a mask, and whose relationship with Adrien deeply disturbed him.

From the moment Adrien had entered his life, Lorenzo had noticed the closeness between him and Margaret. The fact that Adrien was such a trusted confidant to her irritated him. What was between them? Lorenzo felt that Adrien was hiding something important from him, and that uncertainty gnawed at him.

And there's something else... -he paused for a moment, trying to keep his emotions in check-. What's your relationship with Adrien?

Margaret looked at him with an unsettling calm, but inside, Amelia felt the tension rising. She knew this moment would come, the moment when Lorenzo would start asking questions. But she couldn't allow him to discover the truth, not when there was so much at stake.

-My relationship with Adrien is none of your business, Lorenzo -she replied firmly-. I've helped you, and that's all that matters now.

Lorenzo frowned, his frustration becoming more palpable. He stepped closer, shortening the distance between them.

-No, Margaret -he retorted-. It's not just that. I know there's more, I can feel it. Every time I see Adrien with you, I feel like I'm missing something important. I need to know what's going on between you two.

Amelia's heart was pounding under the mask. She knew Lorenzo wouldn't stop easily, but she also couldn't let him see beyond the facade she had built. Her entire plan depended on keeping her identity hidden and ensuring Lorenzo didn't uncover the truth.

-You're wrong -she said with a tone that aimed to be definitive-. There's nothing you need to know about Adrien and me. What matters now is the work we've done together to save your company.

-And why should I trust someone who doesn't even show me their face? -Lorenzo snapped, his tone harsher. He was tired of the secrets, of the half-truths that had surrounded him for so long-. You can't keep hiding behind that mask, Margaret. I want to know who you really are.

Margaret remained silent for a few seconds; the tension between them was palpable. Amelia knew she was on the verge of a dangerous revelation. If Lorenzo insisted, everything she had built could crumble in an instant.

-We don't always have the luxury of revealing who we are -she said softly, trying to use her tone to defuse the situation-. Some secrets are necessary.

Lorenzo stared at her, trying to unravel the layers of mystery that surrounded her. But before he could say more, a group of people approached to admire the jewels on display. The moment was broken, and Margaret took advantage of the distraction to slip away, leaving him with unanswered questions and a sense of emptiness.

As he watched her disappear into the crowd, Lorenzo's frustration only grew. He knew there was something deeper connecting Margaret and Adrien, but without the answers he needed, he was trapped in a web of uncertainty that suffocated him. His determination to uncover the truth only intensified, and though Margaret had managed to evade him for now, Lorenzo knew this game of shadows wouldn't last forever.

The hustle and bustle of the hall began to fade as the banquet drew to a close. Mateo, ever curious, had been wandering around the tables laden with sweets and desserts, but his mind was still preoccupied with the incident he had at the beginning of the night. He couldn't stop thinking about the elderly woman he had accidentally bumped into. Although she hadn't shown any anger, something in her gaze had left him with an uneasiness he couldn't shake.

Determined to apologize, Mateo picked up one of the prettiest desserts from the table, a small fruit tart topped with cream that had caught his eye. He held it carefully in his small hands and headed toward the quieter part of the hall, where he remembered seeing the woman last.

Finally, he found her sitting in a chair near a window, away from the crowd of guests. The moonlight illuminated her wrinkled yet serene face as she quietly gazed at the night. Mateo hesitated for a moment, nervous, but then advanced with determination.

-Excuse me -he said timidly, extending the dessert toward her-. I wanted to give you this. I'm really sorry for bumping into you earlier... I didn't mean to be rude.

The elderly woman looked up, her gray eyes sparkling with surprise and tenderness as she saw the boy in front of her. Her smile, slow and warm, deepened the lines on her face but gave her an unexpected air of youth.

-Oh, dear -she replied in a soft voice, like a whisper-. You have nothing to apologize for. It was just a little accident. But I truly appreciate your kindness.

Mateo, somewhat relieved by the woman's response, handed her the dessert, and she took it with trembling yet steady hands.

-It's such a beautiful tart -the woman remarked-. You know, these used to be my favorites when I was young. My mother used to make them for me on special occasions.
###chapter 13: Beneath the Mask
The boy smiled, pleased that his gesture was appreciated. But what surprised him the most was the warmth he felt between them, as if they were somehow connected, even though they barely knew each other.

-Would you like me to stay for a while? -Mateo asked with his usual curiosity-. I don't like people being alone, and you seem to be.

The elderly woman looked at him with affectionate eyes and nodded gently, pointing to the chair beside her. Mateo climbed up and got comfortable, his legs dangling from the edge of the chair, as he observed her closely while they began to talk.

After a while, the woman leaned slightly toward him.

-You shouldn't be wandering alone here, little one. I'll take you to your mother -she said seriously, standing up with more ease than Mateo had expected. Her posture was firm, and although she used a cane, it didn't seem like she truly needed it.

Mateo nodded, trusting, and took her hand. The elderly woman guided him through the room, weaving between tables and people, heading to where she knew Margaret was. But as they got closer, the atmosphere changed. Mateo sensed a tension in the air, and when he spotted Margaret from a distance, he noticed she felt it too.

Margaret, with her characteristic mask, was talking to some guests, but when her eyes landed on the elderly woman and her son, her posture stiffened. Her heart started to race, overwhelmed by the pressure of the situation. How had Mateo ended up talking to that woman? Her protective instinct kicked in, even though she didn't entirely understand why.

The elderly woman stopped in front of Margaret, her gaze firm and piercing, cutting through any barrier.

-Here's your son -the elderly woman said, her voice sharp, devoid of the sweetness she had shown Mateo moments before-. You shouldn't leave him alone in a place full of strangers.

Margaret felt a wave of tension ripple through her body. She pressed her lips together beneath her mask and leaned toward her son, gripping his hand firmly.

-Thank you for bringing him -she replied, her tone controlled, though her discomfort was evident.

The elderly woman didn't move. She observed Margaret for a few more seconds, as if she wanted to say something else, something hidden behind her wise and aged eyes. The sternness in her expression didn't waver, and Margaret felt as though she was being judged in a way she couldn't fully comprehend.

-It's easy to hide behind a mask, dear -the woman said, her words soft knives-. But you can't hide from everything. Especially not from what truly matters.

The remark made Margaret tense up even more. The elderly woman seemed to know more than she let on, as if she could see beyond the carefully constructed facade Margaret had built. Uncertainty crept in, but she forced herself not to show any reaction beyond what was necessary.

Before Margaret could respond, the elderly woman turned to Mateo, and suddenly, her expression changed. The harshness vanished, replaced by infinite warmth. She leaned slightly to his level and gently stroked his head.

-It's been a pleasure meeting you, little one. Take care, and don't forget what I told you. You have a heart full of light.

Mateo smiled, once again feeling that inexplicable connection with the woman, as she returned the smile, now filled with love and tenderness.

-Thank you -said the boy-. I hope to see you again.

The elderly woman nodded and, after a final affectionate glance, turned and slowly walked away. But instead of heading to the exit, she disappeared into the crowd, as if she had never been there.

Margaret looked at her son and then at the spot where the woman had vanished. Something about her deeply unsettled her. But she couldn't afford to lose her composure-not now. She tightened her grip on Mateo's hand and leaned toward him.

-Come on, darling -she said softly, though her mind was still trapped in the intense interaction she had just experienced.

As they walked away, a sense of unease lingered in the air. Margaret couldn't shake the impression that the elderly woman knew more than she had let on. And although she hadn't said anything concrete, her words echoed in Margaret's mind, planting a seed of doubt and confusion.

Margaret and Adrien stood in a corner of the room, speaking in low voices while Mateo played with some small decorative objects he had found on one of the tables. The atmosphere between them was relaxed, but both knew the evening was nearing its end, and Lorenzo's presence at the same event always loomed as a silent threat.

Adrien, with his usual calm, leaned slightly toward Margaret.

-Mateo has been very restless tonight -he commented, watching the boy, who, though smiling, couldn't stay still for long-. Maybe we should leave before things get complicated.

Margaret nodded. It had been a strange evening, with too many encounters that had left her uneasy. The interaction with the elderly woman still haunted her, and Lorenzo's unexpected approach made her feel like she was walking on a tightrope.

Before they could decide what to do, a familiar figure approached them: Lorenzo.

With his elegant demeanor and always-calculating gaze, Lorenzo walked directly toward Margaret, completely ignoring Adrien. There was something in his expression that hadn't been there before-something sharper, almost challenging.

-Margaret -he said with a slight nod, his voice soft but laden with intent-. I wanted to say goodbye before leaving. It's been a pleasure having you here tonight. I hope we can continue collaborating in the future.

Margaret observed him carefully, trying to maintain her composure. She knew Lorenzo didn't suspect anything about her true identity, but his presence always kept her on edge. She was about to respond when she noticed Lorenzo's gaze shift to Adrien, who stood at her side.

Adrien, ever courteous, extended his hand toward Lorenzo, offering a calm smile.

-A pleasure seeing you again, Lorenzo. I hope everything is going well.

Lorenzo glanced down at Adrien's extended hand but made no effort to shake it. Instead, he raised his eyes to meet Adrien's, cold and filled with barely concealed tension.

-It's unnecessary -Lorenzo replied curtly, not moving a muscle. His short words fell like a stone between them.

The gesture of rejection did not go unnoticed by anyone present. Margaret felt the growing discomfort between her and Adrien, while Lorenzo, without breaking eye contact, seemed to measure each of their reactions.

A heavy silence hung over them for a moment. Margaret glanced at Adrien, whose eyes had lost some of their usual calm. She knew Lorenzo's simple act of refusing Adrien's handshake meant much more than it seemed. There was something there-something Lorenzo suspected or at least wanted them to know.

Finally, Lorenzo broke the silence, inclining his head slightly toward Margaret.

-Margaret, it's been a pleasure -he repeated with a smile that didn't reach his eyes-. We'll see each other soon.

Margaret barely managed to respond, feeling a churn inside her. Lorenzo gave Adrien one last look before turning away and disappearing into the crowd.

Once Lorenzo was gone, the tension between Margaret and Adrien lingered in the air. Neither of them spoke for a moment, but they both knew things had shifted. Lorenzo's behavior, his coldness toward Adrien, was no coincidence.

-Do you think he suspects? -Adrien asked in a low voice, his tone more serious than usual.

Margaret lowered her gaze to Mateo, who was playing, oblivious to it all, then looked back at Adrien.

-I don't know -she replied, trying to suppress the knot forming in her stomach-. But we have to be more careful. If Lorenzo starts suspecting...

Adrien nodded but said nothing more. They both knew the situation was delicate, and any mistake could be fatal. As Mateo continued playing innocently, Margaret and Adrien stood in silence, each lost in their own thoughts about what might come next.
###chapter 14: The Lost Piece
The day after the event, Lorenzo was in his office reviewing company documents. Although he tried to focus, his mind kept drifting back to the previous evening. Something about Margaret intrigued him deeply, though he couldn't figure out what. The interaction with Adrien hadn't gone unnoticed either. There was something in their relationship that stirred a mixture of distrust and curiosity within him.

As Lorenzo went over some reports, his personal assistant, Clara, knocked on the door and entered with a folder in hand.

-Mr. Lorenzo, the organizers of last night's event just called. They insist on speaking with you.

Lorenzo looked up, surprised by the urgency in Clara's voice.

-Did they say what it's about?

-They mentioned something about an important discovery -Clara replied-. They think you should know about it immediately.

Lorenzo nodded and took the phone that Clara handed him.

-Lorenzo speaking. What's going on?

On the other end of the line, the event coordinator's voice sounded serious.

-Mr. Lorenzo, sorry to bother you, but we found something while cleaning up after last night's event. It's a wedding ring with engravings that we think are important.

Lorenzo furrowed his brow, confused.

-A wedding ring? What does that have to do with me?

-What's strange, sir, is that the engravings have the names "Lorenzo" and "Amelia." We thought it might be yours or someone close to you, since both names match. We thought it would be wise to inform you.

Lorenzo's heart skipped a beat. The mention of "Amelia" hit him like a slap in the face. It had been years since that name had been a part of his daily life, and although he still loved her as much as the first day, his wife had disappeared. He never imagined that something related to her would show up at an event like this.

-Are you sure about the engravings? -he asked, his tone sharper than intended.

-Completely, sir. We have the ring here, and if you want, you can come pick it up. We also wanted to confirm if your wife was present at the event, as we think the ring might belong to her.

Lorenzo stayed silent for a moment, his mind racing. Amelia couldn't have been there; she had disappeared three years ago. Also, Margaret, the star designer he was collaborating with, was the main guest, not Amelia.

-No, my wife wasn't at the event -he replied finally, trying to control his tone-. But I'll come by to pick up the ring.

-Perfect, sir. We'll be waiting.

Lorenzo hung up, but his mind was still full of questions. How had a ring with those engravings ended up at the event? And why now, in the middle of all the chaos he was facing with his company?

Determined to get answers, he grabbed his coat and headed toward the door.

-Clara, cancel my meetings for this morning -he said as he passed by his assistant-. I have something important to attend to.

As he drove toward the event venue, he couldn't stop thinking about Margaret. There was something about her that felt too familiar, like every interaction with her was tied to a memory he couldn't reach. Now, with the discovery of the ring, a crazy idea began to form in his mind, but he dismissed it immediately. Amelia couldn't be Margaret... could she?

When he arrived at the venue, Lorenzo was determined to uncover the truth, even though he wasn't prepared for the answers waiting for him.

Upon arriving at the organizers' offices, he was greeted by Miguel, who led him to a small private room. On the glass table sat a small black box.

-Here it is, Mr. Lorenzo -Miguel said, opening the box and showing him the ring.

Lorenzo took it carefully, examining the engraving inside: Lorenzo & Amelia. His heart stopped for a moment. It was the same ring, no doubt about it.

-Where did you find it? -he asked, his voice quieter than usual.

-It was in a corner of the hall, under a table. We think someone might have dropped it accidentally.

-Do you have security footage? -Lorenzo inquired, now fully focused.

Miguel nodded and handed over a folder with photos of the footage. Lorenzo quickly flipped through them, pausing at an image showing a woman in a mask approaching one of the display cases. Although her face wasn't fully visible, something about her posture and the way she moved felt familiar.

-Who is she? -he asked, pointing at the image.

-That's Margaret, the star designer of the exhibition -Miguel replied without hesitation.

Lorenzo felt a chill run down his spine. Everything was starting to connect in his mind, but the pieces still didn't fit together. If Margaret owned the ring, what connection could she have to Amelia?

-Thank you for informing me -Lorenzo said, putting the ring in his pocket-. I'll take care of clearing this up personally.

As he left the building, his mind was full of questions. Margaret and Amelia... could it be that there was something between them that he didn't know? Or could... they be the same person?

The thought hit him like lightning, leaving him frozen in place. If it were true, it would mean everything he thought he knew was about to change forever.
###chapter 15: One Step Away from the Truth
Lorenzo held the ring in his hands, inspecting it carefully. It was, without a doubt, the same ring he had exchanged with Amelia at their wedding, the engravings still intact: Lorenzo & Amelia. His mind kept questioning how it had ended up there. The event coordinator had no clear answers, merely mentioning that it was found at one of the main tables, where the most important guests, including Margaret, had been seated.

Back in his office, Lorenzo shut the door and dropped into his chair. The weight of uncertainty was overwhelming. He pulled out his phone and scrolled through the event photos that had been posted on social media. As he browsed, one picture caught his attention: Margaret smiling beside Adrien. Something about the way she looked at the camera made him pause. Her gaze, the curve of her lips... it all felt familiar.

Just then, Clara knocked softly before entering.

-Mr. Lorenzo, Miss Margaret is on the line. She wants to speak with you.

Lorenzo straightened his posture and nodded.

-Put her through.

Margaret's voice on the other end sounded calm, but Lorenzo detected a slight tension.

-Good morning, Mr. Lorenzo. I wanted to discuss some details about the design we're working on.

Lorenzo took a deep breath, trying to keep his composure.

-Of course, Margaret. But first, I have a question.

-Go ahead.

-Were you at the event until the very end?

There was a brief but noticeable pause.

-Yes, though I left shortly after the speech concluded. Why do you ask?

-Something was found at the venue -Lorenzo said, glancing at the ring on his desk-. A ring with very specific engravings.

-A ring? -Margaret's voice sounded puzzled, but Lorenzo sensed something else, as if she were carefully measuring her words.

-Yes. A wedding ring. It has my name... and my wife's name.

On the other end, Margaret fell silent for a few seconds longer than usual. Finally, she replied in a neutral tone:

-That's... quite curious. Do you think it has anything to do with me?

Lorenzo closed his eyes, trying to decipher the truth in her response.

-I'm not sure. But I feel like everything is connected.

-Well, if there's anything I can do to help, please let me know -Margaret said before quickly ending the call.

When the call ended, Lorenzo was left with even more questions. Margaret had sounded calm, but her reaction had been too calculated.

Determined to uncover the truth, Lorenzo asked Clara to investigate Margaret and Adrien's backgrounds, something he hadn't considered doing before out of respect. Meanwhile, he immersed himself in Margaret's designs. Every stroke, every detail seemed to tell a story he couldn't quite decipher. But something caught his eye: in one of her latest sketches, Margaret had drawn a pair of wedding rings.

He examined them closely. The design was unique, but what unsettled him were the engravings. Although they weren't identical to the ones on the found ring, the style of the letters and their arrangement were suspiciously similar.

At that moment, Clara returned with an envelope in hand.

-Mr. Lorenzo, I found something you should see.

Lorenzo took the envelope and quickly opened it. Inside was information about Margaret and Adrien, but what caught his attention the most was an old photograph of Margaret with shorter hair and a much younger appearance. His heart stopped as he recognized her.

It was Amelia.

The similarities were undeniable. Lorenzo felt his world collapsing. Why had Amelia assumed another identity? And why had she stayed so close to him without revealing the truth?

Before he could process what he had just discovered, his phone buzzed. It was a message from Adrien, who had tried to reach him during the event but hadn't succeeded. The message was short, but enough to stir Lorenzo's emotions further:

"We need to talk. It's about Margaret."

Lorenzo clenched his fists, his mind spinning in a thousand directions. The truth seemed on the verge of being revealed, but the cost of facing it would be higher than he had ever imagined.

\---

Lorenzo met Adrien in his office, ready to confront him with all the questions tormenting him. However, Adrien entered with a calm demeanor, as if he had rehearsed every word he was about to say.

-Thank you for seeing me, Lorenzo -Adrien began, taking a seat across from him-. I know this is complicated, but I need you to listen carefully.

Lorenzo crossed his arms, clearly impatient.

-Don't waste my time. What do you have to say?

Adrien held his gaze, his voice firm but carrying a certain solemnity.

-Margaret is not who you think she is. She's Amelia, your wife.

The impact of those words was so strong that Lorenzo was left speechless for a few seconds.

-How can you be so sure? -he finally asked, his voice tense.

Adrien took a deep breath.

-I know because I've always known. Since she decided to hide behind that name, I've been by her side. We've always been good friends.

Lorenzo leaned forward, his eyes blazing with anger.

-And you never thought to tell me before?

Adrien raised a hand, asking for calm.

-Don't make this easy for yourself, Lorenzo. I respect that you're married, and that's why I've kept this secret for three years. But things can't go on like this anymore.

Lorenzo looked at him distrustfully.

-Why now? Why tell me this at this moment?

Adrien shrugged, his tone somewhat provocative.

-Because I want to play fair. Amelia is an incredible woman, and yes, I love her too.

Lorenzo felt the anger rise in his chest.

-What are you saying?

Adrien remained composed.

-Relax, Lorenzo. I'm not here to steal your wife. She's yours, and I respect that. But if I want to stay in her life, I need everything to be out in the open.

Lorenzo gritted his teeth, struggling to control his temper.

-And what do you expect from me? To just accept this?

Adrien smiled faintly, almost coldly.

-I expect you to fully trust her. After all, she's been hiding this from you for years because of you. My advice? Win her over again, little by little. Find out what she truly feels for you now.

Lorenzo stared at him, trying to decipher his intentions.

-Why are you helping me, Adrien?

Adrien stood, smoothing out his jacket.

-Because I want this to end once and for all. But make no mistake, Lorenzo: this isn't a favor. It's my way of ensuring Amelia finds what she truly needs, whether it's with you... or not.

Before Lorenzo could respond, Adrien headed for the door.

-Oh, and one last thing. Keep this between us. Don't tell Amelia you know. Give her the chance to trust you first.

Without waiting for a reply, Adrien left the office, leaving Lorenzo alone with his thoughts, a heavier burden now weighing on his shoulders.

Lorenzo sat alone, staring at Margaret's sketches on the table. Now he knew the truth, but the question remained the same: what would he do with it?
###chapter 16: Web of Intrigue
Lorenzo walked through the hallways of the mansion, trying to untangle the chaos in his mind. Adrien's words kept echoing: he loved Margaret but respected Lorenzo's marriage. Why say it now? Adrien didn't seem like an impulsive man, but that confession seemed to have a purpose beyond the obvious.

Without realizing it, his steps led him to his mother's greenhouse. There, among the perfectly tended orchids, he always found a mix of calm and confrontation. His mother was standing with her back to him, carefully trimming a wilted leaf. Although Lorenzo knew how harsh she could be with the outside world, in private, she always adopted a sweet and protective demeanor with him-a calculated sweetness to keep him under her control.

-Lorenzo, dear, I wasn't expecting you so early -she said without even turning, as if she already knew he was there.

-Mother -he sighed-. I needed to talk to you.

She placed the scissors on the table, turning with a gentle smile that never quite reached her eyes but always managed to disarm him.

-What's troubling you, my son? -she asked, gesturing for him to sit on a bench beside her. Her voice was so warm it almost made one forget how sharp she could be when she wanted to.

Lorenzo hesitated for a few seconds. Talking to his mother was always a delicate game: she offered comfort, but always managed to gain something in return.

-It's Margaret -he finally admitted.

His mother's face lit up with subtle interest, though she kept her tone serene.

-Ah, Margaret. The woman who's saving your company. What about her?

Lorenzo averted his gaze, feeling a weight on his chest he couldn't quite identify.

-I don't know... there's something about her that doesn't add up. Her closeness to Adrien, her evasiveness... And her son, Mateo...

The boy's name seemed to capture all his mother's attention. She tilted her head slightly, as if evaluating an important piece of a puzzle.

-Mateo -she repeated softly, as if savoring the name-. He's an adorable boy. Although I can't help but notice something curious.

Lorenzo looked up, confused.

-Curious?

She gently stroked his face, a gesture that always made him feel like a child under her protection.

-His eyes, Lorenzo. They're like yours when you were little. That intense look, almost identical.

He frowned, surprised by the comment.

-What are you implying, Mother?

She let out a light laugh, as if minimizing the importance of her words, though her gaze said otherwise.

-Oh, nothing, dear. Just an observation. Sometimes coincidences lead us to interesting places, don't you think?

Lorenzo stayed silent, trying to process what he'd just heard. But his mother, as always, took the moment to guide him where she wanted.

-Listen to me, son -she said, taking his hands delicately-. I know this situation with Margaret and Adrien can be confusing, but you must remember who you are. You're Lorenzo De la Torre. Don't let anyone, not even someone as talented as Margaret, take control of your life or emotions.

He nodded slowly, caught between his mother's warmth and the coldness he knew hid behind her words.

-I'm not saying you shouldn't trust her -she continued-, but don't lower your guard either. That woman is intelligent, perhaps too much. And you need to stay in control.

Lorenzo pressed his lips together. His mother had an almost supernatural ability to sow doubts in his mind, but at that moment, he couldn't help thinking she might be right.

-Thank you, Mother -he murmured, rising from the bench.

She stopped him for a moment, grabbing his wrist with unexpected strength.

-Remember, Lorenzo, I'm always here for you. No one knows you better than I do. And no one loves you like I do.

Her tone was sweet, almost maternal, but Lorenzo felt a shiver run down his spine. She gave him one last smile before returning to her orchids, trimming imperfections with surgical precision, as if that small act was a metaphor for how she handled everything in her life.

Lorenzo left the greenhouse with more questions than answers. His mother's words kept echoing in his head, and although he wanted to ignore them, he knew she never spoke without a purpose. What did that "coincidence" about Mateo really mean? And how much more could Margaret be hiding?

Lorenzo closed the greenhouse door behind him, but his mother's words kept ringing in his mind. "His eyes are like yours when you were little." That seemingly innocent comment had become a thorn lodged in his consciousness.

He headed to his office, seeking refuge among the papers and numbers that usually managed to distract him. But this time, neither the company's finances nor Margaret's new designs could calm the whirlwind of thoughts.

"Mateo is three years old."

The phrase appeared out of nowhere, clear and devastating. Lorenzo stopped in his tracks. Three years ago... What had happened exactly during that time?

Amelia's face came to his mind, an image so vivid he could almost feel her presence. He recalled the days before her disappearance: the tension in her eyes, the arguments that had begun to wear down their marriage, and then, nothing. Amelia had simply left, leaving a void he'd filled with work and emotional walls.

But now... if Margaret was really Amelia, and Mateo was three years old...

He sat at his desk, drumming his fingers against the wooden surface. The possibility was as absurd as it was unsettling. What if Mateo was his son?

"That doesn't make sense," he thought, trying to find logical reasons to dismiss the idea. Amelia wouldn't have hidden something like that... or would she?

His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his phone. It was a message from Margaret.

"Mr. De la Torre, I've just sent you the final sketches. I await your feedback for Monday's meeting."

Lorenzo read the message over and over, looking for something that might betray her-a sign that confirmed his fears. But as always, Margaret maintained her impeccable professionalism.

He put the phone aside and jumped to his feet. He needed answers.

That night, while reviewing the photos from the event where Mateo appeared, he realized that the way the boy smiled, the way he tilted his head... were painfully familiar details.

Determined to find the truth, Lorenzo grabbed his coat and left the mansion. His destination was clear: he had to talk to Adrien.

Adrien received him at a restaurant with a mix of surprise and caution.

-Lorenzo -he said, crossing his arms-. I didn't expect to see you at this hour.

-I can't wait any longer -Lorenzo replied, sitting beside him. His tone was serious, almost cutting-. I need you to tell me the truth, Adrien.

Adrien frowned but said nothing. Lorenzo continued:

-You know more than you're letting on. From the beginning, I've noticed your relationship with Margaret is... strange. But now I have another theory.

Adrien remained silent, only fueling Lorenzo's frustration.
###chapter 17: A Dilemma of the Heart
The restaurant was packed, but to Lorenzo, the noise around him felt like a distant echo. Seated across from Adrien, he studied every one of his gestures, searching for signs, hidden answers. Adrien, for his part, remained unbothered, sipping his glass of wine with apparent nonchalance.

-Adrien -Lorenzo finally broke the silence, leaning forward-. I need you to be honest with me.

Adrien lifted his gaze, calm but with a glimmer of caution in his eyes.

-I always am, Lorenzo.

-Mateo is three years old -Lorenzo said bluntly-. Amelia disappeared three years ago. Now I know that Margaret is Amelia. Is Mateo my son?

Adrien's face showed no surprise; he had been expecting this question. He lowered the glass carefully, taking a moment before answering.

-That's not something I can answer for you -he said, his tone controlled-.

Lorenzo slammed his hand on the table, drawing the attention of some nearby diners. Adrien didn't flinch.

-Why can't you tell me? If you know the truth, say it!

Adrien stared back at him, with a seriousness Lorenzo hadn't seen before.

-Because that truth isn't mine to share, Lorenzo -he said, his voice low but firm-. It's up to Amelia to decide if she wants to tell you or not.

Lorenzo let out a frustrated sigh, running his hands through his hair.

-This makes no sense. If you knew she was Margaret, if you knew everything she did, why didn't you tell me before?

Adrien leaned his elbows on the table, leaning in slightly.

-I already told you: I also love her.

Though it was the second time Lorenzo had heard that confession from Adrien's lips, it hit like a bombshell, and he felt his chest tighten. He looked at Adrien in disbelief, trying to process what he had just heard.

-You love her? -he asked, his voice barely a whisper-. Since when?

Adrien held his gaze, not breaking eye contact for an instant.

-Since before you met her.

Lorenzo leaned back in his chair, as if Adrien's words had struck him physically.

-And you did nothing?

Adrien shook his head.

-No, because she chose you. And I respected that. But now things are different, Lorenzo. Amelia's life has changed. You have to decide if you're willing to do what it takes to win her back.

Lorenzo closed his eyes for a moment, trying to calm the storm of emotions swirling inside him.

-And if Mateo isn't mine? -he asked finally, in a softer, almost fearful tone.

Adrien tilted his head, choosing his words carefully.

-Then you'll have to decide if that changes how you feel about her. But I warn you, Lorenzo: don't pressure her, don't try to force anything. Amelia deserves to be won over, not demanded answers from.

Lorenzo remained silent, his mind trapped in a whirlwind of doubts and possibilities. Adrien watched as his rival and friend battled with his own thoughts.

Finally, Lorenzo stood up from the table, leaving a bill to cover the check.

-Thanks for your honesty -he said before leaving.

Adrien followed him with his eyes, his own emotions mixed between respect and longing. He knew he had just set in motion a series of events that would change everything, but he also knew he had done the right thing.

In the main hall of the mansion, Lorenzo sat on the leather armchair facing his mother, who watched his every move with a blend of calculated tenderness and inherent coldness. She held a cup of tea, feigning serenity, though her eyes missed nothing of her son's restlessness.

-Lorenzo, dear, you've been here for hours and barely said a word. What troubles you so much? -she asked, placing the cup on the saucer with a delicate clink.

Lorenzo ran a hand over his face, his thoughts tangled in Adrien's words and memories of Amelia. Finally, he exhaled in frustration.

-Mother did you know that Margaret is Amelia? -he asked directly, without preamble.

Lorenzo's mother raised an eyebrow, her face barely revealing surprise, though her mind began to work rapidly.

-Why do you ask? -she responded softly, leaning toward him as if she didn't understand where he was going.

-Don't pretend, Mother! -Lorenzo exclaimed, standing up abruptly-. Adrien confirmed it yesterday. All this time, Amelia has been close, and I I was a fool.

She remained silent, her fingers tracing the edge of her cup as she calculated her response. Finally, she let out a theatrical sigh.

-Lorenzo, dear, if Amelia returned under the name Margaret, she must have had her reasons. Perhaps she didn't want you to recognize her.

-And Mateo? -Lorenzo interrupted, his voice filled with emotion-. Don't you think it's strange? The boy is three years old, Mother! And if Amelia disappeared three years ago

She raised her gaze, studying her son carefully before replying.

-Mateo -she repeated, letting the word hang in the air. Then she smiled with a sweetness Lorenzo recognized as dangerous-. Now that you mention it, there is something familiar about him. When I saw him for the first time, I couldn't help but notice how much he looks like you did as a child.

Lorenzo's heart skipped a beat, but before he could respond, Eugenia continued:

-However, we can't jump to conclusions. What proof do you have? Has Amelia said anything to you?

Lorenzo shook his head, frustrated.

-No. Adrien refused to tell me anything about Mateo. But I can't ignore the obvious.

Lorenzo's mother tilted her head slightly, her gaze fixed on him.

-Then you have two choices, my son. You can confront Amelia directly and demand answers or you can play smart. If it's true that Margaret is Amelia, and if that boy is your son, you'll need to approach her carefully. You don't want to scare her away before getting what you need.

-"What I need"? -Lorenzo repeated, frowning-. Mother, I'm not talking about business. I'm talking about my family.

She smiled softly, but Lorenzo could see the hint of manipulation in her eyes.

-Family is the most important business, Lorenzo. And you should always think strategically.

Lorenzo looked away, feeling trapped between Adrien's words and his mother's. He knew she was partly right, but he couldn't help feeling like a pawn in his own game.

-I'm not sure I want to play this "game," Mother.

The mother of Lorenzo stood gracefully, placing a hand on his shoulder.

-Whether you want to or not, my son, you're already in it. Now go and do what you must. But remember, you must always stay in control.

Lorenzo nodded slowly, though deep inside, control was the last thing he felt. As he walked away from the hall, his mother's words echoed in his mind, blending with Adrien's confession and memories of Amelia.

The weight of the truth was closer, but Lorenzo didn't know if he was ready to face it.
###chapter 18: A Place, A Memory
The message from Lorenzo arrived in Margaret's inbox with an unexpected invitation:

"I need to talk to you. It will be in person. I'll pick you up tomorrow at 6 pm."

Amelia read the message over and over, searching for hidden meanings in the words. She hesitated for hours before replying with a single word:

"Alright."

The next day, Lorenzo arrived promptly. Amelia, disguised as Margaret-with her chestnut wig, impeccable makeup, and dark glasses-got into the car. Lorenzo, polite but distant, drove in silence. He didn't reveal their destination, and she didn't ask.

After a few minutes, Amelia began to recognize the route. Her heart skipped a beat as the car stopped in front of the small park where, years ago, Lorenzo and she had met for the first time. A mix of nostalgia and fear washed over her.

Lorenzo got out of the car and, walking around to her side, opened the door.

-Come, I want to show you something.

Amelia cautiously stepped out, her eyes scanning the place. It hadn't changed much. The benches, worn down by time, the tall trees providing shade, and the small central fountain all remained the same. Lorenzo led her to one of the benches.

-This place is special to me -he began, his voice calm but laden with emotion-. This is where I met someone who changed my life.

Amelia felt a lump in her throat but remained silent.

-It was years ago -Lorenzo continued-. She was sitting right here, sketching something in a notebook. I don't know why, but I walked up to her. We looked at each other, and from that moment, I knew I had found something unique.

Amelia averted her gaze, struggling to maintain her facade.

-Why are you telling me this? -she finally asked, her voice softer than she expected.

Lorenzo turned to her, his gaze piercing.

-I want to create a jewelry collection inspired by this place -he said, ignoring her question-. By the colors, the light, the memories. But more than that, I want it to tell a story: the story of a man who found the love of his life here... and lost her.

Amelia felt tears threatening to fall, but she held firm.

-It sounds like a beautiful idea -she replied in a faint voice.

Lorenzo nodded, his eyes fixed on the fountain ahead.

-She was everything to me -he continued, as if talking to himself-. But one day, she just left. She didn't give any explanations, only a void that I've carried ever since.

Amelia closed her eyes for a moment, breathing deeply to keep her composure.

-And why do you think she left? -she dared to ask.

Lorenzo looked at her intently, his eyes filled with restrained pain.

-I don't know. Maybe she was scared, or maybe she thought she wasn't enough. But if I could speak to her, I'd tell her that she never stopped being enough.

The silence that followed was deafening. Amelia wanted to say something-anything-but the words wouldn't come. Lorenzo stood and held out his hand.

-Come, I want you to see something.

He led her to a tree near the fountain. There, carved into the bark and slightly worn by time, were the initials A & L.

-I always come back here -Lorenzo said, tracing the letters with his fingers-. No matter how many years pass, this place will always be where it all began.

Amelia felt her Margaret disguise crumble little by little. Lorenzo's words were a painful reminder of what they had been, of what she had lost, and of what she could never fully reclaim.

-It's beautiful -she finally murmured, unable to say more.

Lorenzo watched her for a moment, as if waiting for her to say something else. Finally, he sighed and looked down.

-Thank you for coming. I needed to share this with you.

Amelia nodded, her hands trembling slightly. When they returned to the car, the ride was just as silent as before. But this time, the silence was heavy with unsaid words, suppressed emotions, and a past they both knew they could never fully bury.

The silence in the car had become almost unbearable. Lorenzo, with a mix of nostalgia and confusion on his face, finally broke it.

-Margaret have you ever loved someone?

Amelia, staring distractedly out the window, felt the air in the car grow heavier. Her fingers nervously played with the edge of her purse, but she forced her voice to remain steady.

-Why do you ask? -she responded without looking at him.

Lorenzo shrugged, though his expression showed the question wasn't casual.

-Simple curiosity -he said, trying to sound nonchalant-. It's hard to imagine someone like you, with your talent and... presence, not having loved or suffered for love.

Amelia let out a brief laugh, though it was tinged with bitterness.

-Yes, I've loved -she finally replied, her gaze fixed on the horizon-. And I've suffered too.

Lorenzo turned his head to look at her, surprised by her frankness.

-What happened? -he asked cautiously, afraid to push too hard.

Amelia hesitated. She felt her words were like walking a thin line between her identity as Margaret and the past she shared with Lorenzo. Finally, she decided to answer, letting the weight of her emotions speak for her.

-I loved someone more than I thought I was capable of. But that person didn't believe in me. Didn't believe in what we were, and in the end, it all fell apart.

Lorenzo frowned, his chest tightening at her words.

-They didn't believe in you? -he repeated, as if trying to understand what it meant-. Why not?

Amelia shrugged, feigning indifference she didn't feel.

-I suppose sometimes love isn't enough. When someone doubts you, your worth, or your decisions, everything else starts to crumble.

Lorenzo gripped the steering wheel tightly, as if battling an internal storm. Amelia's words echoed in his mind, bringing back memories of his own relationship with her-of the times he had questioned her decisions and made her feel like she wasn't enough.

-Do you still think about that person? -he asked, his voice lower, almost as if he feared the answer.

Amelia looked at him for the first time since the conversation started. Her eyes, hidden behind the glasses, were a mystery, but her tone was laden with a melancholy she couldn't hide.

-Sometimes -she admitted, turning back to look out the window-. But there's no use clinging to the past. That person made their decisions, and I had to make mine.

The car returned to silence, but this time, the weight of the unspoken was overwhelming. Lorenzo wanted to ask more, wanted to know who had been important enough to mark her that way. But something in his instinct told him not to push.

As he drove back, Amelia's words kept repeating in his mind. He couldn't help but think that, in some way, she was speaking directly to him. And that, more than anything else, filled him with a strange mix of regret and hope.
###chapter 19: Boundaries and Truths
The constant roar of the car's engine filled the uncomfortable silence between Lorenzo and Margaret as they drove down the highway. The atmosphere was tense, heavy with unspoken words and avoided glances. Lorenzo, his face serious and hands steady on the wheel, broke the silence with a question that had been lingering in his mind for some time.

-Margaret, can I ask you a personal question?

She, distracted while looking out the window, slightly turned her head toward him, her eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses.

-That depends on how personal it is -she replied cautiously.

Lorenzo took a deep breath, as if gathering courage.

-It's about Adrien.

The name hung in the air, and Margaret felt a pang of discomfort. She narrowed her eyes, anticipating what was coming.

-What about Adrien? -she asked, trying to sound indifferent.

Lorenzo tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, clearly nervous but determined to continue.

-I was wondering is Adrien Mateo's biological father?

The air seemed to freeze inside the car. Margaret stared at him, her lips slightly parted in surprise. An instant later, her expression shifted to a mix of indignation and restrained fury.

-Excuse me? -she asked coldly, her tone sharp as a blade-. What kind of question is that?

Lorenzo briefly took his eyes off the road to glance at her, a mix of regret and determination in his gaze.

-It's a reasonable doubt, Margaret. Adrien is very present in your life, and Mateo...

-Enough! -she interrupted, raising her voice slightly-. Lorenzo, you have no right to ask me such a thing.

Lorenzo frowned but kept his composure.

-I'm just trying to understand...

Margaret let out a dry laugh, full of disbelief.

-Understand what, Lorenzo? What does Adrien or my son have to do with our collaboration? We're working together, and that does not give you permission to pry into my personal life.

He pressed his lips together, visibly irritated by her reaction but unwilling to escalate the argument further.

-I didn't mean to offend you -he said, his tone softer but still serious-. But when you work with someone, it's inevitable to want to know more about their life.

-Well, I'm not interested in sharing mine with you -Margaret replied bluntly, crossing her arms-. My life, my decisions, and my family are none of your business, and I don't need to justify anything to you.

Lorenzo kept his eyes on the road, his hands tense on the wheel.

-It wasn't my intention to overstep -he said after a long silence-. But there's something about all of this that doesn't add up, Margaret.

-Then get over it -she snapped, turning back to the window-. We're here to work, not to talk about my personal matters. The only thing that connects us is this collaboration, and you'd better focus on that.

The rest of the drive passed in heavy silence, broken only by the hum of the engine and the faint murmur of the music Lorenzo had turned on to fill the void.

When they reached their destination, Lorenzo turned off the engine and slowly turned toward Margaret.

-I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable, Margaret. Truly.

She looked at him, her face hardened.

-You did, Lorenzo. And I hope it's clear that questions like this won't happen again.

Margaret opened the car door and got out quickly, leaving Lorenzo sitting there, thoughtful, with a frustrated expression on his face. There was something about her that intrigued and baffled him in equal measure. But for now, he would have to learn to keep his distance-at least until the pieces of this complex puzzle began to fit together.

Lorenzo watched Margaret as she walked away with firm steps, her silhouette reflecting the mix of determination and anger still lingering in the air. He closed his eyes for a moment, leaning his head against the seatback, as if trying to shake off the weight of his thoughts. He couldn't help it. There was something about Margaret that pulled him toward memories he'd buried long ago.

Finally, he got out of the car and caught up with her at the entrance of the building where they had a scheduled meeting.

-Margaret -he called, keeping his voice low to avoid aggravating the situation.

She stopped but didn't turn, her body tense like a rope about to snap.

-What? -she said without looking at him, her tone dry.

-I'm sorry -he began, with palpable sincerity-. It wasn't my intention to cross a line.

Margaret sighed, her shoulders relaxing slightly. Finally, she turned to him, though her gaze remained hard.

-Lorenzo, I'm here to work. If we mix personal matters, this won't work. Understood?

-Understood -he replied, though his eyes reflected a swirl of emotions he couldn't fully control.

Margaret nodded, closing the topic. They entered the building in silence, like two strangers sharing a space purely by chance.

\---

Hours later, as the meeting ended, Margaret was gathering her papers in silence while Lorenzo watched her from across the room. His mind kept circling back to their earlier conversation. Though she had been clear, he couldn't ignore the connection he still felt or the questions that had haunted him since Adrien revealed her true identity.

Finally, as they both stepped into the parking lot, Lorenzo broke the silence.

-Margaret.

She stopped and looked at him, weary.

-What now?

-I know I said I wouldn't interfere in your personal life, and I'll respect that. But I just need you to answer something.

Margaret closed her eyes for a second, trying to stay calm.

-What's so important it can't wait?

Lorenzo stepped closer, keeping his voice low and firm.

-Why is Adrien so involved with you and Mateo?

Margaret felt the ground shift beneath her feet. Her hands clenched the papers she held, but she maintained her composure.

-Because he's my friend. That should be enough for you.

-And has he ever been more than that? -Lorenzo insisted, his gaze intense, locked on her.

Margaret looked at him coldly, her words like a knife:

-Why do you care? You have no right to ask these questions.

Lorenzo took a small step back, surprised by the sharpness of her response.

Margaret stepped toward him, raising her voice just slightly.

-Don't try to understand. I don't need you to. And most of all, I don't need you digging into something that has nothing to do with you.

She turned to leave, but Lorenzo spoke again, this time with a vulnerability that stopped her in her tracks.

-Just tell me one thing, Margaret. Do you still love the man you left behind?

She turned slowly, her expression briefly shifting before hardening again.

-Yes. But there's no point in talking about it now.

Lorenzo nodded, as if her words confirmed something he had feared for a long time.

-Then he was an idiot -he said, his tone full of regret.

Margaret didn't respond. She simply turned and walked away toward her car, leaving Lorenzo standing in the middle of the parking lot, his thoughts and emotions swirling inside him like a storm.

One thing was clear to both of them: the past wasn't as buried as they wished it to be.
###chapter 20: Silence on the Road
  
Margaret walked with firm steps toward the parking lot exit, her heels echoing against the concrete. Her breathing was rapid as she tried to suppress the frustration Lorenzo had stirred in her. He caught up with her quickly, his imposing figure stopping her with a call.

"Margaret," he said in a serious but controlled tone.

She didn't respond, not even turning around. Lorenzo quickened his pace, stepping in front of her to block her way.

"What are you doing?" Margaret asked, clearly annoyed.

"I'm taking you back," he said, crossing his arms.

"Excuse me?" she snapped, raising an eyebrow.

"You don't have a way to get back. I brought you here, and I'm not leaving you behind," he explained, his voice maintaining a tone of forced calm.

Margaret let out a bitter laugh.

"Now you decide when I can leave too? Don't make me laugh, Lorenzo. I can call a taxi."

"You won't," he replied swiftly, taking a step closer. His gaze was intense, filled with emotions he tried to hide. "I won't let you go back alone."

She studied him for a moment, searching his face for any sign of a joke, but found none.

"Why do you care?" she finally asked in a defiant tone.

Lorenzo took a deep breath, trying to keep his composure.

"Because I want to make sure you get home safely. That's all."

Margaret narrowed her eyes at him. Something about him unsettled her, but she couldn't pinpoint what it was. Finally, she let out an exasperated sigh.

"Fine, Lorenzo. I'll go with you, but let's be clear-this doesn't change anything," she said, walking toward the car without waiting for a reply.

Lorenzo followed her in silence. Once inside the car, the atmosphere grew tense. The engine roared as it started, and Lorenzo maneuvered out of the parking lot. The first few minutes passed in awkward silence, broken only by the sound of tires on pavement.

"Are you always this controlling, or is it just with me?" Margaret asked suddenly, breaking the silence.

Lorenzo cast a brief glance at her before focusing back on the road.

"I'm not controlling. I just want to do things right," he said seriously.

"Do things right?" Margaret repeated sarcastically. "Don't make me laugh. You always try to impose your rules, Lorenzo."

His grip on the steering wheel tightened, but his tone remained calm.

"I'm not imposing anything. If it bothers you that I care about you, that's your problem."

Margaret scoffed and turned to look out the window.

"I don't need you to care about me. I'm used to handling things on my own."

Lorenzo let her words hang in the air before speaking again.

"Have you always been alone?" he asked, his voice softer this time.

Margaret turned her head toward him, surprised by the change in his tone.

"What kind of question is that?"

Lorenzo paused, as if carefully choosing his words.

"I'm just trying to understand you. Have you ever given someone the chance to truly be with you?"

Margaret stared at him, her eyes flashing with something Lorenzo couldn't quite decipher.

"I'm not talking about my personal life with you," she replied coldly.

Margaret glanced at him out of the corner of her eye but said nothing. The rest of the drive continued in silence, both of them lost in their thoughts, aware that something had shifted between them, though neither dared to admit it.

The car moved slowly through streets illuminated by city lights. Inside, the tension was palpable but not unbearable. Lorenzo kept his gaze fixed on the road, while Margaret looked distractedly out the window, as if every corner sparked a memory.

Suddenly, the ringing of Lorenzo's phone shattered the silence. He pulled it from his pocket and glanced at the screen. It was a call from Diego, his general manager.

"Excuse me a moment," Lorenzo said, turning on the speaker while keeping one hand on the wheel. "Diego, what's going on?"

The voice on the other end was firm, almost urgent.

"Mr. Lorenzo, we need you to return to Colombia as soon as possible. Critical matters have come up that require your presence."

Lorenzo frowned, his previously relaxed expression hardening.

"What matters?" he asked, casting a brief glance at Margaret, who seemed interested in the conversation despite trying not to show it.

"There are important meetings with the investors. The financial situation remains delicate, and some partners want clear answers about the company's future. Also, your prolonged absence is starting to worry them."

Lorenzo pressed his lips together, feeling a mix of irritation and responsibility.

"I've been handling everything remotely. I don't see why they can't wait a few more days," he replied dryly.

"With all due respect, sir, your presence is indispensable. You know how the partners are-they need to see you to feel reassured."

Margaret turned her gaze from the window to Lorenzo, watching him closely. His face was tense, but his posture remained firm.

"I understand, Diego," Lorenzo finally replied. "I'll send a message tonight with the details of my return."

"Perfect. Thank you, sir. See you soon," Diego concluded before hanging up.

The car fell silent again. Lorenzo put the phone back in his pocket and let out a long sigh, as if the call had drained what energy he had left.

"Trouble in paradise?" Margaret asked, breaking the silence with a light but pointed tone.

Lorenzo let out a small, sarcastic laugh without taking his eyes off the road.

"Nothing I can't handle," he said calmly.

Margaret crossed her arms, watching him with a mix of curiosity and caution.

"Your company seems pretty demanding."

Lorenzo nodded.

"It's what happens when you have investors who think they can run things better than you. Sometimes I wonder if all the effort is worth it."

Margaret raised an eyebrow, surprised by his comment.

"And is it?"

Lorenzo took a few seconds to respond, as if weighing the question.

"For now, yes," he finally said, though there was something in his tone that hinted at doubt.

The rest of the drive continued in an uneasy calm, interrupted only by the sound of the engine and occasional traffic. When they arrived in front of Margaret's house, Lorenzo turned off the car and faced her.

"Well, here we are," he said with a slight smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.

Margaret grabbed her purse and reached for the door handle but paused before getting out.

"I hope you find what you're looking for when you go back," she said, looking directly into his eyes for the first time that night.

Lorenzo tilted his head, as if trying to decipher the meaning behind her words.

"Thank you," he replied, his voice low and almost serious.

She gave him a slight nod and stepped out of the car without looking back. Lorenzo watched her walk to the door until she disappeared inside. Only then did he restart the engine, though he didn't drive off immediately.

In his mind, Diego's words mingled with Margaret's. Too many things were at stake, too many moving pieces, and time seemed to be slipping through his fingers.

"What the hell are you doing, Lorenzo?" he murmured to himself before accelerating into the night.
###chapter 21: Footprints of Destiny
The morning was calm, with a clear sky and a radiant sun that seemed to welcome a new day full of possibilities. Lorenzo arrived at Margaret's house, determined to say goodbye before his imminent return to Colombia. When he knocked on the door, a small boy with brown hair and lively eyes answered.

-Hello! -Mateo greeted with a big smile, holding a toy in one hand.

Lorenzo looked around, surprised.

-Hello, champ. Is your mom home?

Mateo shook his head.

-She went out with my dad Adrien. She said she wouldn't be long, but I stayed because I'm playing. Do you want to come in?

Lorenzo hesitated for a moment, but the warmth of the child disarmed him.

-Sure, if it's not a problem -he said as Mateo took his hand and led him inside.

The place was filled with small details that spoke of a peaceful life: toys scattered, children's books on a table, and drawings hanging on the wall. Mateo sat on the floor with his toys and looked at Lorenzo with bright eyes.

-Do you want to play with me? -he asked enthusiastically.

Lorenzo smiled, unable to resist.

-Why not?

For the next hour, Lorenzo focused on building blocks, racing toy cars, and listening to the stories Mateo made up with overflowing imagination. He felt strangely comfortable, as if this moment offered him a break from the chaos that had been his life lately.

While they played, Lorenzo noticed something that froze him: a small mole on the palm of Mateo's right hand. His heart began to race.

He had the same mole, exactly in the same spot.

Trying to remain calm, Lorenzo began asking casual questions.

-Mateo, do you like ice cream?

-Yes! I really like chocolate.

Lorenzo nodded, mentally noting the coincidence: his own favorite flavor.

-What about sports? Do you like playing soccer?

Mateo shook his head, frowning.

-Not much. I prefer to draw.

Lorenzo smiled. He hadn't been a big soccer fan as a child either, always preferring quieter activities.

-You're very creative. Do you like reading stories?

-Yes. My mom reads to me every night. Sometimes my dad Adrien reads too.

Lorenzo felt a slight pinch in his chest when he heard Adrien mentioned. He decided to change the subject.

-And do you like to travel?

Mateo nodded enthusiastically.

-Yes, but we don't travel much. Mom says we'll soon go back home from Paris.

Lorenzo squinted his eyes, wondering if Margaret was talking about returning permanently.

-It must be fun to travel with your mom -he commented.

Mateo smiled widely.

-Yes, but when I grow up, I want to travel like superheroes.

Lorenzo laughed softly, charmed by the child's innocence.

Suddenly, Mateo got up and ran to a shelf.

-Wait! I'm going to show you something.

Lorenzo watched as he pulled out a photo album. The boy returned with the book in his hands and handed it to him.

-It's our album. My mom says our memories are here.

Lorenzo opened the album, feeling a mix of curiosity and anticipation. The first photos showed a newborn baby wrapped in a blanket. There were images of a woman with her face partially covered by a wig and sunglasses, holding Mateo in her arms. Lorenzo continued flipping through the pages, looking for something that would confirm or disprove his suspicions.

Mateo pointed to a photo with excitement.

-Look, here I am on my birthday.

Lorenzo studied the image. The child was blowing out candles while a feminine hand -clearly Margaret's- held the cake. There was something in the scene that felt familiar, but he couldn't pinpoint what it was.

Just as he was about to ask more, the front door opened. Margaret entered, with Adrien behind her. Both froze when they saw Lorenzo sitting with Mateo and the album in his hands.

-What are you doing? -Margaret asked, her tone tense.

Lorenzo calmly closed the album and stood up.

-Mateo wanted to show me his photos. I hope it wasn't a problem.

Margaret looked at Mateo, who lowered his gaze, as if he knew he had done something wrong.

-It's nap time for you -Margaret said, her tone softer but firm.

Mateo nodded and left the room without saying anything.

When they were alone, Margaret crossed her arms and looked at Lorenzo coldly.

-What did you come for?

Lorenzo kept his composure, although his mind was filled with questions he knew he couldn't ask... yet.

-I just came to say goodbye. I'm leaving for Colombia tonight -he said with a slight smile.

Margaret nodded, clearly uncomfortable.

-Then, safe travels.

Lorenzo knew it wasn't the right time to press further.

-Thanks. And... take care of yourselves.

He left the house with a heavy heart and his mind filled with thoughts. As he walked toward his car, he couldn't stop thinking about the mole on Mateo's palm and the strange feeling that this child might actually be his son.

Margaret took the album with trembling hands, watching as Lorenzo walked out the door. Her breath was shallow, as if the mere fact of having seen him with Mateo had triggered a storm inside her. Adrien, who had been watching the scene from a corner, stepped forward and placed a hand on her shoulder.

-Are you okay? -he asked with concern.

Margaret nodded quickly, though it was clear she wasn't.

-Yes, I'm fine. I just need a moment.

She sat on the couch and opened the album to where Mateo had left it. In silence, she turned the pages with nervous fingers, studying each image as if trying to make sure there were no traces Lorenzo could interpret. But as she turned one more page, her heart stopped.

There it was, like a footprint from the past: a photo of her and Lorenzo when they were younger. The memory was clear. They were in a flower field in Colombia, she wore a simple white dress, and Lorenzo had his arm around her waist, smiling as if the whole world belonged to them.

Margaret closed her eyes tightly, cursing herself for not having destroyed that image long ago. Adrien, who had sat beside her, leaned in to look at the page and frowned.

-Why do you still keep this? -he asked, his voice more serious than usual.

Margaret left the album on the table, as if the simple touch of it burned.

-I don't know. Maybe because it was a memory of something I thought I'd never lose...

Adrien took the album and studied the photo for a few seconds.

-And don't you think it's time to tell him the truth?

Margaret looked at him with narrowed eyes.

-What truth? That I'm Amelia? That Mateo is his son? Adrien, I can't do that.

-Why not? -he insisted, slamming the album back on the table-. Lorenzo already suspects something, I can see it in his eyes. And now that he spent time with Mateo, I don't think it will take him long to connect the pieces.

Margaret jumped to her feet, stepping away from Adrien as if she needed distance between them and the topic he had brought to light.

-It's not that simple, Adrien. If Lorenzo finds out the truth, everything will change. And I'm not sure it will be for the better.

Adrien stood up, crossing his arms.

-What are you really afraid of? That he won't forgive you? Or that he'll try to take back what he lost?

Margaret glared at him.

-I'm afraid for Mateo. I'm afraid Lorenzo will try to take him from me.

Adrien shook his head, his expression softening slightly.

-Lorenzo isn't like that. I know him, Margaret. Maybe he makes a lot of mistakes, but he's not cruel.

Margaret let out a trembling sigh, her gaze lost in the photo of the album.

-That's what you think, but you don't know everything that happened. He left me alone, Adrien. When I needed him the most, he left. And now I can't risk him coming back and trying to make decisions about Mateo like nothing ever happened.

Adrien looked at her with a mix of frustration and compassion.

-Margaret, you've been carrying this secret for years. Lorenzo has the right to know the truth, and Mateo deserves to know his father.

She looked at him, her eyes filled with repressed tears.

-Adrien, don't ask me to do this. You've always been on my side, you've always supported me. Please, don't pressure me.

Adrien took a step toward her and put his hands on her shoulders.

-I'll always be on your side, Margaret, but that doesn't mean I can't tell you when I think you're making a mistake. Because, believe me, if Lorenzo finds out the truth on his own, it will be much worse.

Margaret looked away, unable to respond. Adrien's words echoed in her head like a bell she couldn't ignore, but her fear was stronger than any logic.

Finally, Adrien sighed and let her go.

-Do what you want, Margaret. But don't forget that every day you keep this secret, you're getting closer to losing everything you're trying to protect.

Without saying anything else, he left the room, leaving her alone with her thoughts and the album open on that image that meant so much. Margaret sank onto the couch, a tear rolling down her cheek.

The truth was there, waiting to be revealed, but she wasn't ready to face the consequences. Not yet.
###chapter 22: Hearts Adrift
The night was cold, the wind swirled dry leaves through the streets, but Margaret hardly noticed. Her decision was made, her conversation with Adrien had brought her to her senses.

As she drove toward the airport, her mind was a whirlwind of emotions. She had spent too many years hiding the truth, trapped between fear and love. Lorenzo deserved to know. He had the right to meet Mateo, to know that he was his son.

She tightened her grip on the steering wheel, fighting the tremble in her fingers.

- Enough - she told herself, as if the words could calm the storm raging in her chest. This is the right thing to do.

As she parked the car at the airport, her heart pounded. Lorenzo was about to take a flight to Colombia, and if she didn't tell him the truth now, she might not have another chance. She walked quickly toward the terminal, the sound of her heels echoing on the pavement.

When she saw him, her heart stopped. Lorenzo was standing by the gates, looking elegant and hurried, talking to someone she knew very well: Clarisse, his assistant and the perfect daughter-in-law for his mother. The woman had always been a shadow in Lorenzo's life, a loyal ally to his mother, manipulative and shrewd. Margaret felt a pang of discomfort seeing her there.

She stopped a few meters away, hesitating. Lorenzo seemed tense, gesturing as he spoke with Clarisse, who was smiling in a calculated way. Margaret took a step toward them, but stopped dead when she saw how Clarisse leaned toward Lorenzo and kissed him.

Time seemed to stop. Though Lorenzo quickly pushed Clarisse away, the impact was like a punch in the stomach for Margaret. She watched as Lorenzo spoke to Clarisse, looking angry, but Margaret could no longer hear anything. Her vision blurred, and the determination that had brought her here crumbled in an instant.

Her heart was broken. Again.

She backed away, each step heavier than the last, as the tears began to fall. How could she have even thought about trusting him with the truth? How could she have imagined that Lorenzo still felt something for her?

She got into the car, slammed the door shut, and let the tears overwhelm her. The images of Lorenzo with Clarisse repeated in her mind, crueler each time, more devastating.

- How could I have been so stupid? - she whispered through her sobs.

She slammed the steering wheel with both hands, trying to release the rage consuming her. Lorenzo didn't deserve to know anything. Not after what she had just seen.

At the airport, Lorenzo looked at Clarisse with eyes full of fury.

- What the hell do you think you're doing? - he snapped, wiping the trace of the kiss from his mouth.

Clarisse gave him a calm smile, as if nothing had happened.

- I just wanted to say goodbye, Lorenzo. I don't understand why you're so upset. Remember, I have to stay here to continue the collaboration with Margaret.

- Don't ever do that again - he warned, his tone firm and cutting. This means nothing, Clarisse. Absolutely nothing.

Clarisse looked at him with a mix of defiance and flirtation.

- We'll see about that, Lorenzo. My mother and I think you'd be better off letting go of impossibilities and accepting what's in front of you.

Lorenzo felt a knot in his stomach. His mother was always behind everything, trying to manipulate every aspect of his life. But this time, he wouldn't allow it.

- Tell my mother to stay out of my life - he replied firmly, turning to head toward the waiting area.

Meanwhile, Margaret was driving back home, her mind a mess of conflicting emotions. The memories of the kiss between Clarisse and Lorenzo played on a cruel loop in her head, becoming more vivid, more unbearable. Adrien had been right: Lorenzo deserved to know the truth. But how could she trust a man who still allowed people like them to be a part of his life? It had been a mistake to think that anything had changed. Lorenzo was still the same man, trapped under his mother's shadow and surrounded by opportunists like Clarisse.

She drove on autopilot, barely noticing the scenery around her, her chest tight with pain and anger. At some point, she had to pull over to the side of the road, unable to continue. She rested her forehead against the steering wheel, letting the tears she had kept inside for so long flow freely.

- Why does it hurt so much? - she whispered, her voice broken.

She took a few minutes to regain her composure before continuing on her way, telling herself she had to be strong. For Mateo. He was all that mattered.

When she got home, the stillness of the night enveloped her. Everything was silent, except for the soft ticking of the clock in the living room. Margaret walked toward Mateo's room, her steps light, as if afraid of disturbing the peace of her son.

She opened the door and found him asleep, his small figure curled up under the blankets, hugging his favorite stuffed animal. Margaret stood for a moment in the doorway, watching him. Her chest filled with an infinite love and crushing guilt. She approached carefully and sat on the edge of the bed, gently stroking his hair.

- You're the only thing that matters - she murmured, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. I don't need anyone else.

Mateo sighed in his sleep, murmuring something incomprehensible, and Margaret smiled faintly. But as she said those words, she knew they weren't entirely true. Every time she looked at Mateo, she also saw Lorenzo. The same mole on his palm, the same crooked smile when he was happy, the same eyes that seemed to see beyond appearances.

She stood up carefully so as not to wake him and returned to the living room. The clock marked three in the morning, but Margaret knew she wouldn't sleep that night. She collapsed onto the couch, hugging herself as the thoughts consumed her.

Lorenzo had the right to know. No matter how much she tried to convince herself otherwise, the truth always weighed more. But what would she gain by telling him? What would guarantee that Lorenzo wouldn't accuse her of hiding Mateo from him out of revenge, of using the child to hurt him? And what would happen to Mateo if Lorenzo decided to take his son away?

Margaret closed her eyes, remembering the last time she saw Lorenzo before leaving everything behind. His words of disbelief, the pain in his eyes when he accused her of lying. That night, she had decided to disappear, convinced they would never cross paths again. But fate had other plans.

Now, everything was too tangled, and she was tired of fighting against the circumstances. For a moment, she thought about waking Mateo up and taking the first flight back to Europe, leaving this nightmare behind. But that wouldn't be fair to her son. Mateo deserved stability, not a mother running away from her problems.

The decision was made: she would continue keeping the secret, even if every passing day consumed her a little more. As long as Lorenzo was under the influence of people like Clarisse, she could never trust him with the truth.

She looked out the window, where the first light of dawn was beginning to appear.

- This is for the best for everyone - she whispered, as if saying it aloud could convince herself.

But deep down, she knew it was only a matter of time before everything came to light. And when that moment came, she would have to face it, no matter the consequences.
###chapter 23: The Shadow of Return
Lorenzo stepped off the plane with a tired but determined face. He had spent days in a whirlwind of emotions and revelations that he still hadn't fully processed. However, returning to Colombia meant regaining control, or at least that's what he wanted to believe.

As he crossed the doors of his mother's house, where he needed to pick up some important documents, he stopped dead in his tracks. There, in the foyer, stood his mother, impeccable as always, in an elegant dress and a gaze that mixed coldness with sweet manipulation. Lorenzo frowned.

-What are you doing here? -he asked, dropping his suitcase to the floor.

-Isn't a son supposed to be happy to see his mother? -she replied with a measured smile.

Lorenzo crossed his arms, not bothering to hide his irritation.

-The last time we talked, you said you were staying in Paris. What happened to your decision to help Clarisse?

His mother let out a soft laugh, as if the question seemed childish to her. She took a few steps toward him, extending her hand to stroke his cheek, but Lorenzo pulled away.

-Clarisse is perfectly fine -she said, lowering her hand with a slight expression of disdain-. She doesn't need my help. You, on the other hand, do.

-Me? -Lorenzo raised an eyebrow, incredulous.

-Yes, my son. Since you left Colombia, the company has been teetering. I've heard rumors that your decisions haven't been the best. It's been three years since Amelia left, it's time for you to take control of your life, my son.

The comment hit like a direct blow, but Lorenzo didn't let his face show anything.

-I don't owe you any explanations -he replied, his voice harsh-. Besides, the company is fine. If I left, it was to save what you and your allies almost destroyed. Also, my separation from my wife was a tough blow.

His mother raised an eyebrow, visibly offended, but kept her calm tone.

-Allies? I hope you're not referring to Clarisse. That girl has done more for you than you realize.

Lorenzo scoffed, stepping toward her.

-Clarisse is a problem, not a solution. Don't talk to me about her "efforts," because all I've seen is her trying to manipulate everything for her convenience, just like you.

His mother narrowed her eyes, her sweet facade beginning to crumble.

-Be careful what you say, Lorenzo. Clarisse is an important ally, someone who understands what it means to protect what's ours. You, on the other hand, seem more interested in chasing ghosts.

Lorenzo felt anger rise in his chest but forced himself to stay calm.

-They're not ghosts -he said firmly-. What I did abroad had a purpose, something you'd never understand because you've always controlled everything from your comfortable bubble.

-And what did you gain from that? -she challenged him, crossing her arms-. A new design? An alliance? I hope it's worth it, because you're risking everything for something you haven't even explained. And don't speak to me like that, you never used to.

Lorenzo gritted his teeth. He knew any explanation would be useless with his mother. She always found a way to twist things to her advantage.

-I don't have to justify myself to you -he finally said, grabbing his suitcase and turning toward the stairs-. Thanks for your "concern," but I don't need it.

His mother remained in the foyer, watching him with a mix of frustration and calculated disappointment. When Lorenzo was halfway up the stairs, she spoke again, her voice laden with a venomous tone.

-And what will happen with Clarisse?

Lorenzo stopped but didn't turn around.

-Clarisse is your problem, not mine -he replied without looking at her.

When he reached his room, Lorenzo slammed the door shut, as if that gesture could contain the emotions that threatened to spill over. He leaned his back against the wood, letting out a heavy sigh filled with frustration and exhaustion. For a moment, the silence of the room enveloped him, but instead of bringing him peace, it only amplified the echo of his thoughts.

He looked around, observing the familiar details that once comforted him. Yet now, every corner seemed empty, devoid of meaning. He was unsure whether to stay in his mother's house, with the constant tension she created, or return to the other house, the one that still held the memories of Amelia. But going back there also meant confronting the weight of the past, the pain of what was lost.

With slow steps, he sank into the armchair by the window, resting his head against the backrest as his eyes drifted toward the view of the illuminated city. The blinking lights seemed to reflect the chaos within him. No matter how much he tried to sort his thoughts, they always returned to the same thing: Margaret, Mateo, and Amelia.

Margaret. Every time he thought of her, a whirlwind of emotions tore through him. The strong, impenetrable woman he worked with had an air of familiarity that unsettled him. There was something in her gaze, in the way she spoke, that disarmed him, as if touching on strings he thought were buried. And then there was Mateo that boy who, unknowingly, had awakened feelings he never thought he'd have.

-This isn't over -he murmured, with a renewed fire igniting in his gaze.

He knew he couldn't keep avoiding the truths that were beginning to surface from the shadows. The way Margaret became defensive whenever Adrien was mentioned, the obvious connection between Mateo and him... Everything was falling into place, yet it was still filled with gaps that needed answers.

He stood up from the chair with resolve, but his steps stopped when he looked at his reflection in the window. His own eyes, filled with uncertainty, stared back at him. Was he ready to face what he would discover? Because, if what he suspected was true, his world would change forever.

He clenched his fists, trying to suppress the mix of anger and pain that engulfed him. Not only did he have to face Margaret and her hidden truth, but also his mother and Clarisse, whose manipulations seemed endless.

-First Margaret... then the rest -he decided quietly, marking the start of a plan that was still not fully formed.

It was chaos he hadn't asked for, but was willing to untangle, no matter the cost. He knew he couldn't move forward without answers. And if Margaret held the keys to understanding his present, he would do whatever it took to get them, even if it meant confronting his own past.

But what Lorenzo didn't know was that, at that very moment, Margaret was also fighting her own internal battle. A battle that, like his, would lead her to make decisions that would inevitably bring them face to face again, in a struggle for truth, forgiveness, and perhaps, a second chance.
Capítulo 24: Interferencias calculadas
Margaret was in her Paris apartment, watching from the window as the city lights began to turn on. Mateo was playing on the floor, unaware of the tensions consuming his mother. Since Lorenzo returned to Colombia, their collaboration had been put on hold, and Margaret thought she would take advantage of the time to focus on new designs. However, an unexpected call disrupted her peace.

The phone rang, and when she looked at the caller ID, Margaret saw an unknown number. She hesitated before answering but finally swiped her finger across the screen.

- "Mrs. Margaret?" - a female voice resonated on the other end, clear, elegant, and slightly condescending.

- "Yes, who is this?"

- "This is Clarisse. Perhaps you've heard of me. I'm a close friend and currently Lorenzo's personal assistant."

The name struck her like a blow. Though Margaret hadn't dealt directly with Clarisse in a long time, she knew who she was: a woman not only close to Lorenzo but also to his mother, a key player in the web of manipulations.

- "How can I help you, Miss Clarisse?" - Margaret asked, forcing herself to stay calm.

Clarisse chuckled softly, a sound that Margaret found filled with insincerity.

- "Oh, don't worry. I don't need anything from you, dear. In fact, it's me who has something to inform you."

Margaret furrowed her brow, anticipating that it wouldn't be good news.

- "Go ahead."

- "From now on, any matters related to Lorenzo's collaboration will have to go through me first," Clarisse said, with a mixture of sweetness and authority. "Lorenzo has asked me to represent him in Europe while he attends other important commitments in Colombia."

Margaret felt a mixture of indignation and distrust begin to form in her chest.

- "Was that Lorenzo's decision?" - she asked, her voice cautious but loaded with doubt.

- "Of course. Lorenzo trusts me completely. He assured me you'd understand. Besides, since he's been absent, he thought it would be more efficient to have someone like me overseeing things."

Margaret stayed silent for a few seconds. She knew Clarisse wasn't just an assistant; she was someone who enjoyed power and would do whatever it took to maintain her influence over Lorenzo.

- "Understood," Margaret finally replied, though her tone was colder than she had planned. "If that's what he thinks is best, I will comply."

- "Perfect," Clarisse said, with evident satisfaction in her voice. Then she added in a more cutting tone, "By the way, Margaret, I know you're a reserved woman, but I hope that doesn't mean there's something Lorenzo should know and you're hiding. He despises secrets."

The words hit Margaret like a poisoned dart. Though she tried to maintain her composure, her hand gripped the phone tightly.

- "Lorenzo and I have a strictly professional relationship, Miss Clarisse. There's nothing you should be concerned about."

- "I'm glad to hear that," Clarisse replied, as if she had already won an invisible battle. "I hope it stays that way. Have a good night."

The call ended, but the tension remained. Margaret placed the phone on the table and took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. She walked to the window, watching the lights of Paris as a storm raged inside her.

Mateo appeared, running and interrupting her thoughts.

- "Mom, look! I made a drawing!" - he said, holding up a colorful sheet of paper.

Margaret crouched down and took her son in her arms, hugging him tightly.

- "It's beautiful, sweetheart," - she said with a smile, though her heart still weighed with worry.

As she held Mateo, Margaret reflected on what had just happened. Clarisse was making it clear that she saw Margaret as a threat, though without knowing the full truth. Lorenzo, on the other hand, was far away, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to understand his true intentions.

That night, as she watched Mateo sleep, Margaret made a decision: she would not let Clarisse or Lorenzo's mother interfere in her life any longer. For too long, she had let others dictate the course of things, dragging her into a web of lies and secrets that kept her trapped. But Mateo was her priority, her reason to fight, and she would not let anything or anyone disturb her son's peace.

She stayed by his bedside for a while, watching as the little figure of Mateo breathed peacefully, unaware of the storms swirling around his world. His brown curls fell across his forehead, and Margaret couldn't help but smile sadly. She had dreamed of a complete family for him, with a father who would be present, who would love him as much as she did. But that illusion seemed as distant as the stars twinkling in the Parisian sky.

- "No more games, Mateo," - she whispered softly, caressing his hair. - "No more lies."

The decision weighed heavily on her chest, but it also filled her with a determination she hadn't felt in years. If Lorenzo truly wanted to continue the collaboration, he would have to be honest and face the consequences. It was no longer her responsibility to chase him or beg for his attention, not after everything she had endured.

However, admitting that didn't erase the knot in her throat. She knew Clarisse's words were no coincidence; they were a veiled warning, a reminder that there were still people willing to drive them further apart.

She stood up from the bed and walked to the window, crossing her arms as she looked out at the city. The lights of Paris seemed endless, but her reflection in the glass returned a tired image, filled with secrets she could no longer hide forever.

- "If Lorenzo wants the truth," - she murmured softly, as if speaking to herself - "he'll have to prove he deserves to hear it."

For now, she would continue protecting Mateo and keeping her secret. But something inside her told her that the time for hiding was coming to an end, and when that moment arrived, neither Clarisse nor anyone else could stop her.
###chapter 25: The Unexpected Encounter
The sound of the phone woke Margaret earlier than usual. She looked at the screen with her eyes still half-closed, and her heart sank when she saw Clarisse's name. She hesitated for a moment, but she knew ignoring it would only make things worse.

-Yes? -she answered in a controlled voice, though the unease showed in every word.

-Margaret -Clarisse's voice was sharp, as always-. We need to talk. There are some sketches that just aren't working, and I want you to fix them immediately.

Margaret frowned. Her designs had always been flawless, and this unfounded criticism bothered her deeply. However, she took a deep breath. She couldn't afford to get into a conflict.

-Sure, can you be more specific?

-I prefer to discuss it in person -Clarisse cut her off with disdain-. I'll be waiting for you at Café Lumière at ten. Don't be late.

Before Margaret could respond, the call ended. She let out a frustrated sigh and placed the phone on the table. She had the feeling this meeting would be more than just a discussion about designs.

\---

At exactly ten o'clock, Margaret arrived at Café Lumière, an elegant place with large windows and minimalist décor that seemed designed to impress. Clarisse was already there, sitting at a table in the corner, a coffee in hand and an expression that exuded superiority.

-At least you're punctual -Clarisse said when Margaret approached.

-I always am -Margaret replied calmly, sitting down across from her.

Clarisse slid a portfolio across the table, filled with the sketches Margaret had sent days earlier.

-These designs don't reflect the vision Lorenzo has for the collection -she said with a cold smile-. They are too common.

Margaret bit her lip, holding back the retort that burned on her tongue.

-And what exactly is that vision?

Clarisse tilted her head, as if evaluating Margaret from above.

-Elegance, exclusivity, something that speaks of prestige and distinction. These designs look like they're made for the middle market. Lorenzo expects something more innovative.

Margaret took the portfolio and opened it, reviewing the sketches. Every line, every detail was a reflection of her experience and talent. She knew the designs were excellent, and this criticism was just another of Clarisse's strategies to assert her dominance.

-What exactly seems wrong to you? -she asked, raising her gaze.

Clarisse pretended to think for a moment, taking a sip from her cup before responding:

-Everything. It's better if you start over.

Margaret slammed the portfolio shut, her patience starting to wear thin.

-I don't think Lorenzo has seen these sketches yet -she said, staring at Clarisse-. Or am I wrong?

The slight flicker in Clarisse's eyes confirmed what Margaret had already suspected. Lorenzo had no idea about this meeting or the supposed criticism of her work.

-I don't need to consult him to know what works and what doesn't -Clarisse retorted, regaining her haughty attitude.

Margaret leaned slightly forward, not breaking her gaze.

-Lorenzo trusts my judgment as a designer. If he has something to say about the sketches, I'm sure he'll communicate it to me directly.

For a moment, Clarisse's face hardened, but she quickly regained her composure.

-Do what I'm telling you, Margaret -she said in a frosty tone-. Don't forget that Lorenzo is busy with important matters in Colombia. He doesn't have time to deal with mistakes.

Margaret stood up slowly, tucking the portfolio under her arm.

-Thank you for your opinion, Clarisse -she replied with a tense smile-. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

Without waiting for a response, Margaret calmly stood up, collecting the portfolio with a calculated movement, and turned to leave. She walked toward the café exit with her head held high, feeling Clarisse's gaze burning into her back as a reminder of the woman's intentions. Every step she took was a silent declaration: she wouldn't be intimidated.

The cold Parisian air enveloped her as soon as she crossed the door, making her shiver slightly. She paused for a moment, pressing the portfolio to her chest while observing the movement of the city around her. Paris, her refuge, and yet her prison. She had come here seeking a fresh start, far from secrets and pain, but it seemed that her past always found a way to catch up with her.

As she walked through the cobblestone streets, her thoughts became clearer with each breath of cold air filling her lungs. She would not let Clarisse make her doubt her talent or her worth. Her work spoke for itself, and Lorenzo knew that. If he had something to object to, they would discuss it as professionals, not through intermediaries with hidden agendas.

But it wasn't just her work at stake. Clarisse didn't settle for interfering in the professional realm; her meddling extended to everything. Margaret gritted her teeth as she remembered the way Clarisse had looked at her during the meeting, as if she were measuring every one of her reactions. Clarisse didn't just want to discredit her as a designer; she wanted to crush her, reduce her to someone insignificant.

Margaret stopped in front of a well-lit display window, where the reflection of her tired face stared back at her. "Why do you keep running?" her conscience seemed to ask. She couldn't help but think of Mateo, sleeping peacefully at home, unaware of the whirlwind of emotions his mother faced every day.

No matter how hard she tried to convince everyone, even herself, that she could handle everything alone, the reality was more complicated. Mateo had the right to a complete family, and Lorenzo, even if he didn't know it yet, was an essential part of that equation.

-I can't keep allowing this -she whispered, almost as if the words could free her from the burden she carried.

She straightened up, a new determination lighting up her gaze. If Clarisse thought she could manipulate or isolate her, she was very wrong. Margaret wouldn't just protect her work; she would protect her son and what remained of her connection with Lorenzo, even if that meant facing everything and everyone.

She resumed her walk home, with firm steps. The air was still cold, but it no longer felt like a threat, but rather a reminder that she was alive, strong, and ready to fight for what really mattered.
###chapter 26: The Perfect Strategy
Two days after their last conversation, Margaret and Clarisse met again at the elegant café in the center of Paris. The tables, arranged with care, reflected the discreet luxury of the place, while the aroma of freshly ground coffee filled the air. Margaret had been punctual, as always, and arrived dressed in a simple yet flawless silk blouse, projecting the professionalism that characterized her. However, this time there was something different in her demeanor: an even more determined attitude and a look that left no doubt about who was in control. She had spent the last two days preparing not only the sketches but also the speech with which she would defend her work.

While waiting for Clarisse, she reviewed the documents in her folder one last time. They weren't just designs; they were a statement that she would not be trampled or manipulated. Every line, every stroke, represented her artistic vision, and she was not willing to let anyone, not even someone with Clarisse's influence, make her doubt her talent. She ordered a black coffee while settling into her chair, relaxed but alert, mentally preparing herself for what was about to come.

Finally, Clarisse arrived, wrapped in a designer coat and carrying her usual air of superiority. Her gaze evaluated Margaret from head to toe before sitting across from her, with a gesture that indicated she expected to be the dominant figure in the conversation. But Margaret, with a slight smile that concealed her true intention, greeted her courteously, ready to face her once more. This would not be just any meeting; Margaret had come prepared to mark her territory, and nothing or no one would make her back down.

-Margaret, dear, you have no idea how much I was looking forward to this moment -Clarisse said in an almost maternal tone, which Margaret knew was pure theater-. I hope you have something truly worthwhile this time.

-Of course, Clarisse -Margaret replied with a measured smile as she sat down across from her-. I spent quite some time reflecting on your observations, and I think you'll be pleased with what I've prepared.

Clarisse settled into her chair, crossing her legs elegantly, while Margaret placed the portfolio on the table. Days had passed, but Margaret had made no changes to the designs. She had decided that the best way to deal with someone like Clarisse was to show her that her authority was nothing but an illusion.

-Here are the new designs -Margaret said calmly, opening the portfolio-. Thanks to your valuable observations, I noticed some weak points that I was able to adjust.

Clarisse raised an eyebrow, surprised by Margaret's seemingly genuine tone. She took the sketches with elegance and began examining them, her gaze moving from one design to another.

-Interesting... -she said after a few seconds, nodding slightly-. This is much better. Perhaps, if you continue working under my guidance, you could reach a more professional level.

Margaret couldn't help but let out a low laugh, laced with sarcasm.

-Oh, Clarisse, I'm so glad you think so -she said, her tone sweet but full of irony-. You know, sometimes one needs that critical push to reach excellence.

Clarisse, unaware of the underlying meaning in Margaret's words, smiled smugly, believing she had managed to intimidate Margaret.

-I'm glad you finally understand -she replied, with an air of superiority-. After all, I have a lot of experience in this business.

Margaret nodded slightly, but her mind reveled in the small victory: the designs that Clarisse had just approved had not had a single line changed from the original.

-Well, I guess everything is ready -Margaret said, closing the portfolio-. Unless you have any more observations.

-For now, no. But don't let your guard down, Margaret. Stay open to my advice; it can always make a difference.

-Oh, don't worry -Margaret replied, standing up with a smile-. I appreciate your valuable opinion more than you think.

As she left the café, Margaret felt the cold Parisian air brush against her face, a refreshing contrast after the tense conversation with Clarisse. She took a deep breath, letting the coolness fill her lungs, as if the simple act of inhaling helped her expel any trace of doubt or frustration that might have lingered inside her. For the first time in days, a spark of satisfaction lit up her gaze, and a faint smile appeared on her lips. She had faced Clarisse on her own turf and come out victorious, even though the other woman had no idea of it.

As she walked down the cobbled streets, the city lights reflecting in the puddles of recent rain, Margaret thought about everything she had faced to get to this point. There had been doubts, sacrifices, and moments of loneliness that had tested her, but she had never allowed herself to fall. That small victory, though insignificant in the eyes of others, was a reminder of her strength and determination. No one, not even someone like Clarisse, could take away the confidence she had rebuilt with so much effort.

Her thoughts returned to Mateo, the driving force behind all her decisions. He deserved to have a strong mother, a woman who could teach him that life, although sometimes unfair, could be conquered with courage and conviction. Margaret looked up at the gray Paris sky, determined to keep moving forward, to protect what she had built, and not to let anyone, not even her own heart, divert her from the path she had chosen. Because, even though Lorenzo remained a persistent shadow in her mind, Margaret knew she could not afford to falter. Not yet.
###chapter 27: The Broken Bond
In Colombia, the sun began to rise over the mountains, bathing the mansion in a soft light. As was his custom, Lorenzo said goodbye to his mother before leaving for the company. His relationship with her had always been complicated, but respect and obligation kept him close.

-Take care, son. See you later -his mother said with an affectionate smile, although her eyes didn't shine as they used to when it came to him.

Lorenzo nodded, kissed her on the cheek, and left in a hurry, but before he reached the car, he remembered something important he had forgotten in his room. He decided to quickly go back for it, quietly, so as not to alarm his mother or Valeria. Despite the rush, something inside him told him he needed to do it. The document he had left behind was crucial for the meeting that morning.

He headed back to the house without making any noise, making sure no one saw him return. When he entered, everything seemed quiet. However, as he walked down the hallway, something caught his attention: the voices of his mother and Valeria were clearly coming from the living room.

Without thinking, he stopped, hiding behind a corner so he wouldn't be seen. He didn't want to intervene or listen to them, but curiosity pushed him to get a little closer.

-I don't know what happened to Lorenzo -Valeria said in a frustrated tone-. How could he be so blind, mother? She was never right for him, and now, look where we are.

Lorenzo felt a knot in his stomach. Although he didn't fully understand, something about his sister's words unsettled him.

-It was what I had to do -his mother replied, in a tone full of deep resentment-. If Lorenzo had made the right choice, he would never have had to deal with that woman. I always knew his loyalty would be with me, but... I never imagined he could be so manipulable. In the end, everything we did was for his own good.

Valeria let out a sigh, as if feeling relieved by her mother's words.

-Why didn't you do it sooner? Why did you wait so long to separate Amelia from him? -Valeria asked, as if she had been waiting for an answer that would justify everything that had happened.

-Because I didn't think I needed to, but after so much... when she felt so sure of herself, that's when her ego made her believe Lorenzo would live only for her -his mother replied with venom in her tone.

Lorenzo gritted his teeth as he heard those words. He knew his mother had never accepted Amelia, but hearing her speak so coldly about his wife filled him with indescribable rage.

-She never understood that everything I offered him was for his own good. I pretended to be sick, all so that he would stay by my side. And even though I told him I needed him, she never understood. All she cared about was herself. And when I finally realized that his love for me was being questioned, I couldn't allow it -his mother continued, her voice full of bitterness-. I was the one who kept him close, the one who made him stay. Amelia never understood that she had to give space to his family, to his mother. She was never willing to sacrifice for him, and he... he always believed me, not her.

Lorenzo felt like the world was crashing down on him. His mother's words hurt more than he had anticipated. He remembered the day Amelia had left, her eyes full of pain, and how he hadn't stopped her, because he had believed his mother. He had preferred to believe his mother, who had pretended to be sick, rather than trust his wife's explanation.

-I never understood how she couldn't see everything I offered him -his mother went on, her voice even harsher-. Sometimes I think it was because of her pride. If it had been different, everything would have been better. But she left, and that was the best decision.

Lorenzo closed his eyes, feeling the pain pressing on his chest. It had been him who had chosen to believe his mother's lies. It had been him who had allowed Amelia to leave, without asking a single question, without seeking her side of the story.

He realized he had been a fool, blind, preferring to listen to his mother's words instead of seeing the truth. The truth was that Amelia had been a victim of manipulation, of constant humiliation, in an environment that never accepted her, and he had been responsible for all of that.

Turning slowly, Lorenzo decided to leave without making a sound. He needed time to process what he had just heard. He didn't know how, but he had to get Amelia back. He needed to apologize, and above all, he needed to understand how he had allowed everything to reach this point.

With determined steps, Lorenzo left the mansion, leaving behind the heavy burden of his mother's words. The sun had already risen completely, bathing the streets with its golden light, while the city continued its course, unaware of everything he had just discovered in that moment. The murmur of everyday life seemed to show no compassion for what was happening inside him.

Each step he took toward the car seemed to take him further from the mansion, but at the same time, it brought him closer to the truth. The battle with his own family had just begun, and he didn't know how much he could take before he broke. The pain and confusion accompanied him, and the anger he had held in for years now threatened to spill over.

He knew facing his mother and Valeria would be just the beginning, but beyond that, the greatest challenge was facing himself. The decisions he had made, the lies he had accepted without questioning, and the open wound that hurt him every time he remembered how he had let Amelia go without fighting for her. Although the road ahead wouldn't be easy, Lorenzo knew he couldn't continue living in ignorance. He had to rebuild what he had lost, even though, in his heart, he already felt it might not be enough.
###chapter 28: The Truth in Ruins
Lorenzo arrived at the company later than planned, rushing to the meeting with the investors. As soon as he crossed the reception area, his assistant intercepted him, looking nervous.

-Sir, the investors are already in the meeting room. They've been waiting for almost ten minutes.

-Tell them I'm on my way -he replied quickly, heading straight to his office.

The delay irritated him, but what weighed on his mind was what he'd heard at the mansion. Every word from his mother and Valeria echoed in his head, impossible to ignore. "I pretended to be sick because I knew Lorenzo would always choose his mother." It felt like everything he once believed stable was crumbling beneath him.

Lorenzo left the company as soon as the meeting ended, though his mind had been absent throughout the negotiations. The investors' faces and comments faded from his memory, replaced by one constant image: Amelia.

He drove aimlessly through the city, his thoughts trying to process what he'd discovered that morning. His mother and Valeria's words were like poison, slowly seeping into every memory of the past years. He couldn't stop thinking about how he had allowed them to interfere in his marriage, how he had chosen to trust his mother instead of listening to his wife.

Eventually, he parked in front of a small park where he and Amelia used to go in the early years of their marriage. Sitting under a large tree, he buried his face in his hands.

"How am I supposed to fix all of this?"

As the cool afternoon breeze surrounded him, he made a decision: he would confront his mother and Valeria. He couldn't let them control his life any longer or remain the man who allowed their manipulations.

When he reached the house, Lorenzo didn't knock. He walked in directly, his face rigid, his steps determined. He found Valeria in the living room, looking through some documents, and his mother sitting on the couch, reading a magazine. Both looked up at him, surprised by his intense demeanor.

-Lorenzo, dear, what are you doing here? -his mother asked sweetly, but he didn't answer.

Standing in the center of the room, he looked at both of them with a gaze that made them uncomfortable.

-How long did you plan on manipulating me? -he finally asked, his voice low but tense.

His mother frowned, while Valeria nervously put the documents down.

-I don't know what you're talking about, son.

-You know exactly what I'm talking about -he interrupted, raising his voice slightly-. I heard your conversation this morning. I heard everything. How you pretended to be sick to keep me away from Amelia, how you humiliated her until she couldn't take it anymore.

Valeria looked down, but their mother held her ground, though her face paled slightly.

-Lorenzo, I did it for your own good. That woman wasn't right for you. A peasant married to a rich man? That's unacceptable.

-Enough! -he shouted, stepping toward her-. You always claimed you wanted the best for me, but all you did was destroy my marriage. Amelia was my wife, my family, and you you made me choose between her and you, and I was blind enough to choose you.

Valeria lifted her head, nervous.

-Lorenzo, I...

-And you? -he interrupted, turning to his sister-. Did you enjoy humiliating her? Did it make you feel better to tear her down every day?

Valeria opened her mouth to respond, but no words came out.

-Don't talk to me about love or family -he continued, now addressing them both-. Because what you did wasn't love. It was selfishness, control, fear of losing me. But guess what? You already lost me.

His mother stood up from the couch, her face now filled with indignation.

-You can't speak to me like that! I'm your mother; I gave you everything.

Lorenzo looked her straight in the eye, his gaze cold and unrecognizable.

-And I lost everything that truly mattered because I played your game.

He left the mansion with firm steps, ignoring his mother's cries to stop him. Inside, he felt a contained fury, but also a clarity he hadn't had in years. It was time to end the manipulation and chaos his family had imposed on his life.

When he reached the garage, he stopped abruptly. He couldn't just leave without taking definitive action. With renewed resolve, he returned to the living room, where his mother and Valeria still stood, confused by his earlier outburst.

-Back to apologize? -Valeria sneered, crossing her arms.

Lorenzo looked at her with a coldness that made her step back.

-I'm not here to apologize -he said, his voice sharp as a blade-. I'm here to set things straight.

He turned to Valeria, who now looked uneasy.

-Starting today, you won't get another penny from me. Your cards, your accounts, everything is canceled. It's time you learned to stand on your own, because I'm done funding your whims.

-What?! -Valeria exclaimed, incredulous-. You can't do that! I'm your sister!

-And I'm the man you had no problem betraying over and over -he replied harshly-. If you have so much energy to belittle others, you should be capable of finding a job and supporting yourself.

Valeria was speechless, her face reddening with anger. Lorenzo ignored her and turned to his mother.

-And you... -he said, his voice lower but filled with deep disappointment-. I never thought you, of all people, would destroy my life this way.

His mother lifted her chin, trying to maintain her composure.

-Everything I did was for your own good, Lorenzo. That woman wasn't good enough for you.

Lorenzo shook his head, a bitter smile on his lips.

-Don't fool yourself, Mother. You did it because you couldn't stand someone else having a place in my life. Amelia was my wife, my family, and you destroyed her to keep control over me.

-You can't talk to me like this! -she exclaimed, tears forming in her eyes.

-I'll keep sending your pension -he continued, ignoring her outburst-, but don't expect anything more from me. I'm going back to my house. Even if the memories of Amelia kill me, I'd rather face them than live here, surrounded by lies and manipulation.

She tried to speak, but Lorenzo raised a hand to stop her.

-There's nothing more to say.

Without waiting for a response, he turned and left the mansion again, feeling an immense weight lifted from his shoulders.

As he drove, Lorenzo's mind was no longer trapped in the past but focused on what he needed to do next. Amelia was out there somewhere, living far from the chaos he had allowed. And now he knew he couldn't rest until he found her, faced her, and took responsibility for everything he had done.

The road wouldn't be easy, but Lorenzo was no longer the blind, submissive man he once was. He was ready to fight, not just for Amelia, but for the man he wanted to become.
###chapter 29: The Letter of Redemption
Lorenzo parked his car in front of the house that, three years ago, had been both his refuge and his torment. The darkened windows and silence enveloped the place, but to him, every corner was alive with memories of Amelia. That house, once a home, now felt like a mausoleum filled with echoes of the past that had kept him away for so long.

He stepped inside slowly, as if afraid to awaken the ghosts he knew resided there. The scent of old wood and furniture untouched for years hit him immediately. Closing the door behind him, he leaned against it and let out a long sigh.

It had been three years since he'd last lived there. Ever since the day Amelia left, he hadn't been able to stay more than a few hours. He came only to write letters he never sent, unaware of her whereabouts but needing to feel some connection to the love he had lost.

"Why did I come back?" he thought as his eyes scanned the living room. The unlit fireplace still seemed to hold the warmth of the nights they had spent together. The rug beneath his feet had witnessed laughter, arguments, promises made and broken. Everything in that house was Amelia.

He climbed the stairs slowly, each step echoing in the silence. Reaching the bedroom, a wave of emotions hit him. The bed they had shared stood untouched, as though still waiting for them. The walls seemed to whisper her name, and Lorenzo closed his eyes briefly, fighting the lump forming in his throat.

He approached the desk by the window, where a stack of unsent letters rested. He couldn't help but reread them every time he visited, as if the words reminded him of who he had been and what he had lost.

But tonight felt different. There was a new weight in his chest, an urgency he couldn't ignore. Sitting at the desk, he grabbed a blank sheet of paper. For the first time, he knew exactly what to say.

\---

Amelia,

It's been a day since my last letter, but I've never felt such a need to write as I do now. Today, more than ever, I realize how deeply I failed you.

For years, I told myself that you destroyed what we had. But today, the truth hit me like lightning. I learned what my mother and Valeria did to you-how they humiliated you, how they conspired to make your life unbearable. Their cruelty had no limits. But the worst part, Amelia, is that I allowed it to happen.

There are no excuses for my blindness. No words can undo the pain I caused by not listening to you, by not protecting you as I had promised when we vowed to build a life together. I believed my mother's lies, her feigned illnesses, her manipulations. I let guilt and misplaced duty consume me, leaving you to face enemies I should have stood against with you.

I know that saying I'm sorry isn't enough, but I say it from the depths of my soul. I'm sorry, Amelia. I'm sorry for not believing you, for failing to see the truth, for letting you down in so many ways.

I don't expect these words to fix what I broke. I don't expect your forgiveness because I don't deserve it. But I hope that wherever you are, you find the peace and happiness I couldn't give you.

I want you to know that I will change-not because I hope for a second chance with you, but because it's the least I owe you: to become the man I should have been from the start.

With love and regret,
Lorenzo

\---

When he finished, Lorenzo let the pen fall onto the desk. A heavy sigh escaped him, filling the room with the weight of his guilt. His hands trembled as he folded the letter, his movements slow and deliberate, as if the paper carried the burden of all his failures.

Would he ever send it? He didn't know. Even if the letter reached Amelia, there was no guarantee she would read it-much less forgive him. But writing it had been necessary, a first step in facing the demons he had created.

He stood and walked toward the window. His footsteps echoed in the empty room, mocking his solitude. Pulling back the curtains, he gazed out at the city. The Parisian night stretched before him, illuminated by lights indifferent to his torment. The streets and buildings, once his sanctuary, now felt distant, cold.

His reflection in the glass revealed a man he barely recognized: exhausted, broken, yet with a spark of determination in his eyes.

The wind outside rustled the leaves, a reminder of life's fragility. His mind filled with memories of Amelia: her smile, her laughter that could brighten any room, and the last time he saw her, with tears in her eyes and a shattered heart.

-How did we get here? - he whispered, as if the city might answer him.

He knew the letter wasn't enough. Words on a page couldn't erase years of pain. They couldn't bring back Amelia or Mateo or the life he had let slip away. But it was a start, an attempt to confront the wreckage he had caused.

The clock struck midnight as Lorenzo tucked the letter into his pocket, a mix of hope and resignation settling over him. Perhaps one day he would find the courage to give it to Amelia, to face her and say everything he had kept bottled up. Or perhaps he wouldn't.

For now, all he could do was promise himself that this time, things would be different. The night carried on, but for Lorenzo, the real journey was only beginning.
###chapter 30: The Silent Truth
Lorenzo left the studio with a strange weight in his chest. He knew perfectly well that Margaret was Amelia. He had discovered it weeks ago, through small details: the way she spoke about the designs, the words she used, and even the tone of her voice, though she tried to disguise it. Adrien had also confessed it to him. But he wasn't ready to confront her-not yet.

He leaned against the car parked in front of the building, looking up at the gray sky. "Why are you playing this game, Amelia? Why are you hiding who you are?" The thoughts tormented him, but he also knew it wasn't the time to demand answers. If the last few days had taught him anything, it was that patience could be his greatest ally.

As he drove back to the office, his mind kept replaying the conversation. Margaret-or Amelia-had been too cautious. Even though she had managed to maintain her composure, Lorenzo had noticed how her hands tensed and how she avoided looking directly at him when he mentioned his wife.

"What are you afraid of, Amelia? That I'll hate you? That I won't be able to forgive you? Or worse... that you won't be able to forgive me?"

When he reached his office, Lorenzo sank into his chair, staring at the envelope he carried with him. It was another letter he had written for Amelia, but he knew he couldn't send it yet. Not while she continued to deny who she was. "There's no point in sending words you already know, but one day, you'll have to listen to me."

Throughout the rest of the day, Lorenzo tried to focus on his meetings, but his mind kept returning to Margaret's face. He knew she was playing a role, and while he wanted to respect her space, it was becoming increasingly difficult to contain his emotions.

-Sir, Margaret sent over some new sketches -his assistant said, walking into the office-. She said she hoped they meet expectations.

Lorenzo took the documents without saying a word. Every line of those designs spoke of Amelia, of her talent, of her essence. "Even on paper, you can't hide who you are."

That night, as he reviewed the sketches in the solitude of his office, Lorenzo made a decision. If Amelia wanted to remain Margaret, he would let her-for now. But he couldn't let this game go on forever.

With each design he studied, with every stroke he analyzed, love and pain intertwined. He wanted to hold her, to shout at her, to ask for her forgiveness, and to demand answers. But for now, all he could do was wait for the right moment to confront her.

"I love you, Amelia," he thought as he closed his eyes for a moment. "And I'll do whatever it takes to recover what we lost."

The silence of the night enveloped him as he remained in his office, determined to wait as long as it took for Amelia to stop hiding.

Lorenzo had barely closed his eyes in his office, the sketches carefully stacked on one side of the desk, when the sound of his phone shattered the calm. He glanced at the screen, and the name that appeared made his jaw tighten.

Clarisse.

With a sigh of frustration, he answered the call.

-What do you need, Clarisse? -his tone was dry, enough to make it clear he wasn't in the mood for her usual schemes.

-Lorenzo, darling, why so harsh? I'm just calling to check on you. Your mother is worried about you. She doesn't know why you decided to return home after so long.

Lorenzo pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to stay calm.

-My mother knows perfectly well why I'm at my house, and so do you. Stop pretending to care. What do you really want?

Clarisse was silent for a moment before continuing with a tone that tried to sound innocent.

-Well, since you ask I've been reviewing some of Margaret's latest designs, and I feel they're not up to the company's standards. Perhaps you should reconsider if she's the right person to work with you.

The mention of Margaret made Lorenzo stand up, his brow furrowed, his heart pounding.

-What are you insinuating, Clarisse? -he asked, his voice cold and sharp.

-I'm just saying maybe you should look for someone more competent. Someone who truly takes their work seriously.

Lorenzo clenched his fists. He knew perfectly well that Clarisse was trying to manipulate him. This kind of comment wasn't new, but now, knowing who Margaret truly was, it was intolerable.

-Listen to me carefully, Clarisse -he said firmly-. Margaret is the best designer this company has ever worked with, and I won't allow you or anyone else to question her talent. If you have a problem with her work, you should tell me directly instead of making cowardly insinuations.

-Don't be like that, Lorenzo -Clarisse replied with a nervous laugh-. I'm only trying to help. You know I've always looked out for the company's interests.

-The only thing you've done is meddle where you don't belong -Lorenzo responded, feeling his patience wearing thin-. And let me warn you, Clarisse: stay out of Margaret's work. This isn't a game.

Before Clarisse could respond, Lorenzo hung up abruptly. He took a deep breath, trying to calm the whirlwind of emotions inside him.

"I won't let anyone destroy what I'm trying to rebuild. Not this time."

He walked over to the window, pressing his forehead against the cold glass. The city below was still lit, its lights flickering like fallen stars, oblivious to the chaos consuming him.

The streets, bustling with movement and life, stood in stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. It was a cruel reminder of how the world moved on, indifferent to his internal struggle.

Resting a hand on the window frame, he closed his eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. The heavy air of his office felt suffocating, but not as much as the thoughts pounding in his mind. Clarisse's words echoed, laced with venom, and his frustration grew.

It wasn't just Clarisse. It was everything-his mother, his family, his own choices. He had let the past chain him, allowed mistakes to pile up, forming a wall that separated him from what truly mattered. But now, that wall was starting to crack, and behind it was Amelia, with her laughter, her gaze-everything he had lost because of his inability to protect what he loved.

Lorenzo knew he couldn't let the past control his present anymore. The lies, the manipulations, the wounded pride-it all had to stay behind. It was time to make firm decisions, to face the truth, no matter how painful it was.

He looked at his reflection in the glass. He looked older, more tired, but in the depths of his eyes, there was still a spark of determination. "Amelia deserves more. I can be more."

One thing was certain: he wouldn't let anyone else stand between him and Amelia. Even if the memories hurt, even if the road to her was full of obstacles, he would do whatever it took to show her he was willing to fight for what they had lost.
###chapter 31: Desperate Decisions
Clarisse paced back and forth in her elegant hotel room in Paris, holding her phone tightly in one hand, her nails tapping rhythmically against the screen. She had tried to stay calm during her call with Lorenzo, but his abrupt reaction and the way he hung up on her had felt like a slap to her ego. No one left her talking alone, especially not him.

She stopped in front of the large mirror in the living room, staring at her reflection. Her image showed a perfect facade: flawless, calculated, yet her eyes betrayed the fury burning inside her. Frustrated, she tossed the phone onto the sofa and crossed her arms.

-Lorenzo doesn't understand what's best for him -she murmured through gritted teeth-. He's always been too naive, too soft with the wrong people.

The name "Margaret" echoed in her mind, igniting a deeper anger. There was something about that woman, her constant presence, that was unbearable. Margaret had managed to secure a privileged place in Lorenzo's life, and he seemed increasingly focused on her.

Clarisse walked toward the table where a glass of red wine awaited her. She picked it up delicately, though her hands trembled with rage. Taking a sip, she stared out the window at the glowing lights of Paris while plotting her next move.

-If I got rid of Amelia, I can do the same with Margaret -she said softly, almost as a vow.

She remembered how she had orchestrated Amelia's departure. The thought brought a malicious smile to her lips. Lorenzo's mother, Valeria, and she had been flawless in their strategy: subtle humiliations here and there, planting doubts in the relationship, feigning illnesses, and manipulating Lorenzo into believing whatever they wanted. It had been a slow game, but an effective one.

-Amelia never had the strength to stay. She broke and left. Margaret won't be any different -she reassured herself, her voice filled with cold certainty.

Clarisse knew Lorenzo was slipping away, that he was no longer the easily manipulated man he once was. But that didn't matter. As long as she could control the narrative, she wouldn't let any woman-Amelia in the past or Margaret in the present-stand in the way of her rightful place beside Lorenzo.

Finishing her wine, she placed the glass firmly on the table. Her gaze hardened with determination. She went to her desk and began sifting through papers and contacts, seeking a way to reach Margaret without Lorenzo knowing.

-If you can't convince him, destroy what distracts him -she whispered, scribbling something in her planner.

For Clarisse, emotions were irrelevant. Control was all that mattered, and she was determined to regain it at any cost.

That afternoon, Margaret decided to take a break from work. She had been immersed in her latest jewelry collection and needed some time to unwind and enjoy with Mateo. Dressed in casual yet elegant clothing, she stepped out with her son, heading to one of the most exclusive shopping districts in Paris.

-Can we go to the toy store, Mom? -Mateo asked, his tone a mix of excitement and sweetness that always melted Margaret's heart.

-Of course, but first, I want to look at a dress. Is that okay? -she replied, holding his small hand as they walked past the bright, luxurious shop windows.

They entered a high-end boutique, one of Margaret's favorites. Mateo, as always, began exploring with curiosity, approaching mannequins and discreetly touching the fabrics. Margaret kept an eye on him as she browsed through the racks of dresses.

-Mateo, don't wander too far, please -she said with a smile.

But children, with their boundless energy, always find a way to move faster than expected. Mateo ran toward the fitting rooms and accidentally bumped into a woman who had just stepped out.

-Oh! -the woman exclaimed, taking a step back.

-Sorry! -Mateo quickly said, looking up at her with wide, sincere eyes.

The woman, none other than Clarisse, bent down to look at the child more closely. Her initial look of annoyance transformed into something entirely different: astonishment.

-Are you okay? -she asked, though her voice sounded distracted. Her eyes scanned every feature of the boy, from his dark hair to those familiar eyes that seemed to pierce through her.

Margaret, noticing Mateo's absence, turned and saw the scene. As she approached, her heart sank at the sight of Clarisse.

-Mateo, sweetheart, come here -Margaret called out, extending her hand calmly though her mind was racing.

Mateo ran to her, clinging to her skirt. Margaret placed a protective hand on his shoulder as her eyes met Clarisse's.

-I apologize if my son caused you any trouble -Margaret said, maintaining her composure even though her thoughts raced wildly.

Clarisse didn't respond immediately. She was too preoccupied, staring at the child, her mind making connections at lightning speed. That face there was something undeniable about it.

-No need to worry it's fine -she finally replied, but her voice was distant. Then, in a tone that tried to sound casual, she added: -Is he your son?

-Yes, he is -Margaret answered firmly, her hand tightening slightly on Mateo's shoulder.

Clarisse smiled, but it was a tense smile, as though she was processing something she couldn't yet fully grasp.

-He's charming -she said, though her eyes remained fixed on Mateo, searching his features for confirmation of what she was starting to suspect.

-Thank you. Well, if you'll excuse us, we have other things to do -Margaret said, feeling the weight of Clarisse's gaze like an interrogation.

She took Mateo's hand and began walking toward the exit. But as she did, Clarisse's voice stopped her in her tracks:

-Who is his father?

Margaret froze but didn't turn around. Her heart pounded in her chest, but she refused to let Clarisse see her falter.

-Good day, Clarisse -was all she said before leaving the boutique with firm steps.

Clarisse remained standing, her mind filled with questions and a new spark of determination. If what she had just seen was true, Margaret had far more than a talent for design-she had a secret that could change everything.

Clarisse exited the boutique moments later, but she didn't follow them. Instead, she stood on the sidewalk, watching Margaret and the boy disappear into the bustling Paris streets. Something inside her refused to settle, as though every fiber of her being screamed that the child was more than a mere coincidence.

Frowning, she pulled out her phone and dialed a number.

-I need you to investigate someone for me -she said firmly when the call connected-. Margaret, the designer. She lives in Paris and has a young son. I need to know everything about her. Quickly.

She placed the phone back into her purse, standing still for a moment as she replayed the encounter in her mind. She couldn't shake the image of that boy. The same eyes, the same expression she had seen countless times in Lorenzo. If there was one thing Clarisse excelled at, it was recognizing details.

\---

Meanwhile, Margaret and Mateo were walking toward a nearby park, seeking a quiet spot away from the busy streets.

-Why was that lady looking at me so much, Mom? -Mateo asked, his voice innocent but curious.

Margaret gently stroked his hair, trying to calm herself so Mateo wouldn't sense her worry.

-Maybe she thought you were very handsome -she replied with a soft smile.

-Really? -Mateo asked, delighted.

-Of course, sweetheart. But now we need to hurry, okay?

Margaret knew she shouldn't overthink the encounter, but she couldn't help feeling that Clarisse had seen more than she should. That woman wasn't foolish, and if she began to suspect anything about Mateo, she wouldn't hesitate to use it against her.
###chapter 32: Don’t Mess with My Son
That same night, Clarisse reviewed the files her investigator had sent her. It wasn't much; Margaret was reserved and kept her personal life away from the public eye. But one thing stood out: there were no records of the child's father.

-Interesting -she murmured, a calculated smile on her lips.

She reclined on the sofa, holding a glass of wine, her thoughts revolving around Margaret and the boy. If Lorenzo found out about this, it could become a problem-or an opportunity to regain control.

-Margaret or whatever your name is, I'll uncover your secret. And I promise, you won't walk away unscathed -she said, raising her glass as if toasting her impending victory.

Across the world, in Colombia, Lorenzo was in his office, reviewing the latest financial reports of the company. He had been working tirelessly since his return, trying to save what was left of his business. Yet, he couldn't fully concentrate.

Margaret lingered in his thoughts. Not just because of her talent, but because he knew she was Amelia. And now, more than ever, he wanted to get closer to her, to find a way to win her back.

The ringing of his phone broke his train of thought. Seeing it was Clarisse, he sighed in annoyance before answering.

-What do you want, Clarisse? I'm busy.

-I just wanted to tell you something curious, Lorenzo. Today, I ran into Margaret and her son.

Lorenzo felt his heart skip a beat, but he tried to remain calm.

-And what's so interesting about that? -he asked in a neutral tone.

-Oh, nothing, it's just that -she paused, savoring the moment-. That boy has eyes that look very familiar. I don't know why, but he reminded me a lot of someone I know.

-Stop with your nonsense, Clarisse. I don't have time for this -Lorenzo replied, hanging up before she could continue.

He stared at the phone, his jaw tightening. Clarisse was playing with fire, and although he didn't know how much she had discovered, it was clear she wasn't going to stop.

Lorenzo stood up and looked out the office window, his mind torn between protecting Amelia, Mateo, and dealing with the fallout of everything that was coming to light. If Clarisse kept meddling, he'd have no choice but to act before the past consumed everything.

\---

Margaret was in her workshop, organizing some of her latest designs to send to production. It was her refuge, the place where she always found peace amidst chaos. But that day, her tranquility was shattered by a notification on her phone.

It was a message from Adrien:

"Margaret, we need to talk. I've received some concerning information. Clarisse is investigating you, specifically about Mateo. Be careful."

Margaret's heart raced. Clarisse was crossing a dangerous line, one she wouldn't allow anyone to cross.

\---

It didn't take long for Margaret to decide to take matters into her own hands. She wouldn't wait for Clarisse to get closer to her life or her son. She knew the woman frequented an exclusive tea lounge in the heart of Paris, so she went straight there.

When she arrived, she found Clarisse sitting at a table by the window, a champagne glass in her hand and her usual arrogant, confident expression. Margaret didn't ask for permission; she simply stood in front of her.

-Well, Margaret, what a surprise to see you here -Clarisse said, raising an eyebrow and setting her glass down.

-Don't make this harder than it already is, Clarisse. You know exactly why I'm here -Margaret replied coldly.

Clarisse smiled, but there was a hint of defiance in her eyes.

-Whatever do you mean?

Margaret leaned closer to her, her words low but filled with intensity.

-Stop investigating me. And most importantly, stop investigating my son. Mateo has nothing to do with your schemes or your games.

Clarisse feigned surprise, but Margaret noticed how her fingers tensed around the glass.

-Oh, dear, I didn't know a little curiosity about your life would cause such an uproar. It's just professional interest.

Margaret let out a cold laugh.

-Make no mistake, Clarisse. I'm not someone you want to play games with. I won't let you touch Mateo.

Clarisse maintained her smile, but her gaze now held a trace of nervousness.

-I don't know what you're talking about...

-Don't you dare keep pretending. If you take one more step toward my son, you'll find out I'm much more than I seem. And believe me, you don't want to meet that side of me.

The atmosphere in the tea lounge grew tense. Several people turned to look at them, but Margaret didn't move. She held Clarisse's gaze until the woman looked away.

Without waiting for a response, Margaret straightened and turned to leave. Clarisse sat still for a few seconds, processing what had just happened.

As Margaret stepped out onto the streets of Paris, she felt a mix of anger and relief. She had confronted Clarisse, but she knew that woman wasn't one to back down easily.

-No matter what she does -she told herself as she walked-. Mateo is my priority, and I'll do whatever it takes to protect him.

\---

That night, as she tucked her son into bed, Margaret couldn't help but notice every little detail about Mateo: the way his hair fell across his forehead, his steady, calm breathing, and how his small body curled up against the pillow. He was a happy, innocent child, and that was all that mattered to her. Yet her mind was far from the peace her son exuded.

Sitting on the edge of the bed, her fingers gently brushed the blanket as her thoughts turned dark. She knew Clarisse wasn't an easy woman to confront. She had played with others' fates before, manipulating and destroying without remorse. Margaret had learned to live with the weight of her own decisions, but this time, it wasn't just her at stake-it was Mateo, her little Mateo, at the center of this storm.

-I won't let anyone hurt you, my love -she whispered softly, even though Mateo was already fast asleep.

She rose slowly and walked to the window. Outside, the lights of Paris sparkled like tiny stars, a stark contrast to the darkness she felt inside. Placing a hand on the cold glass, she let her mind work on what lay ahead. If Clarisse decided to make another move, Margaret would be ready. She was no longer the same woman who had fled years ago, wounded and broken. Now, she was a mother, a renowned designer, and above all, someone who had learned to fight for what she loved.

With every beat of her heart, she felt her resolve strengthen. No matter what she had to do or the risks she had to take, Clarisse had underestimated the Margaret she faced now-and that would be her greatest mistake. The battle was just beginning, and Margaret didn't intend to lose.

Taking a deep breath, she left Mateo's room, carefully closing the door behind her. Her son was safe for now, but Margaret knew she had to prepare for what was coming. She sat at her desk, pulled out a sheet of paper, and began drafting a plan, mapping out every possible move Clarisse might make and strategizing how to protect her son.

For the first time in years, Margaret felt like she wasn't just surviving but fighting back. And that filled her with a strength she hadn't realized she possessed.
###chapter 33: Crossroads
The sun filtered timidly through the windows of Margaret's spacious living room. The day began with deceptive calm, but Margaret knew it was only the calm before the storm. The confrontation with Clarisse the day before had ignited a spark within her: she wasn't willing to back down, but she also couldn't let her guard down.

While Mateo played with a puzzle on the rug, Margaret reviewed her pending designs. Work was the only thing that distracted her. Yet, a persistent thought haunted her: how far would Clarisse go?

The sound of the doorbell snapped her out of her thoughts. Margaret stood and opened the door. It was her assistant, Chloe, holding a package and looking concerned.

-This just arrived for you, Mrs. Margaret -said Chloe, handing her the envelope.

Margaret took it cautiously. There was no sender, but the seal was from a well-known Paris courier. Opening it, she found a series of photographs. They showed her walking with Mateo in various parts of the city: the park, a café, a toy store. The last image was a close-up of Mateo with a handwritten note on the back: "Secrets always come to light."

Margaret felt her blood run cold. Her first thought was that Clarisse was behind it, but could she really dare to threaten Mateo so blatantly?

-Are you alright, ma'am? -asked Chloe, noticing her pale face.

Margaret took a deep breath and forced a smile.

-Yes, everything's fine. Thank you, Chloe.

Once her assistant left, Margaret locked the door and leaned against it, looking at the photographs again. Anger and fear mixed inside her.

Clarisse, this is too much, she thought, clenching her fists.

With coffee still warm in her hand, she checked her email. Her correspondence with Lorenzo had remained strictly professional, but now she felt the need to break that barrier. Clarisse wasn't just investigating her; she seemed to have set her sights on Mateo. Lorenzo needed to know.

She picked up her phone and dialed Lorenzo's number. He answered almost immediately, his voice firm but surprised by the early call.

-Margaret. This is unexpected.

-Lorenzo -she said directly-. This can't wait. I need to speak with you urgently.

-Is there a problem with the designs? -he asked, concern creeping into his tone.

-This has nothing to do with the company -she replied, her voice trembling slightly-. It's personal.

There was a pause on the other end.

-I'm listening.

Margaret pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to stay calm.

-I'd rather not discuss this over the phone.

Lorenzo sighed.

-I'm in Colombia. It's hard for me to travel right now. But if it's that urgent, tell me what you need.

Margaret hesitated before answering.

-Clarisse is crossing boundaries I didn't expect. She's investigating me, Lorenzo. She's even trying to find out who Mateo's father is.

A heavy silence filled the line. Lorenzo didn't need clarification; he knew who she was referring to.

-What? -his voice was cold and disbelieving.

-I confronted her yesterday, but today I received photos of Mateo and me walking around Paris. Lorenzo, I don't know how far she's willing to go, but this is no longer just between her and me. This affects my son.

Lorenzo didn't respond immediately. Margaret could hear his deep breaths as he tried to contain his anger.

-I'll handle this -he finally said, his tone low but determined-. Clarisse has no right to involve you or Mateo.

-I hope so -Margaret replied, trying to keep her voice steady-. But if this continues, Lorenzo, I won't hesitate to take action and cancel the collaboration.

-I understand -he said-. Please, don't do anything until I talk to her. And, Margaret...

-What?

-Take care of Mateo. And yourself.

Margaret closed her eyes, breathing deeply.

-I always do -she replied before ending the call.

In Bogotá, Lorenzo threw his phone onto his desk, his face tense as he processed the conversation. He had known Clarisse was ambitious, even manipulative, but he hadn't imagined she would go this far. For the first time in years, he felt the control he had fought to maintain slipping away.

Meanwhile, in Paris, Margaret prepared for the day with renewed determination. If Lorenzo didn't act soon, she would face Clarisse herself. Her son was her world, and she wouldn't allow anyone, not even someone as dangerous as Clarisse, to put him at risk.

Lorenzo dialed Clarisse's number with steady hands, though his expression betrayed the anger simmering inside him. The line barely rang twice before she picked up, her tone sweet and carefree as always.

-Lorenzo! What a pleasant surprise to hear from you so early.

-Clarisse -he said, his voice sharp-. We need to talk. Now.

The tone of his voice made her tense immediately.

-What's wrong? Did something happen with Margaret?

-Exactly that, Clarisse. You happened with Margaret -he replied, his tone rising slightly-. I trusted you to handle this collaboration professionally, but what you've been doing is far from that.

-What are you talking about? -she asked, trying to sound innocent-. I'm just making sure everything goes perfectly for the company.

-Perfectly? -Lorenzo let out a bitter laugh-. Since when does investigating Margaret's personal life, stalking her, and prying into her son's parentage fall under your responsibilities?

The silence on the other end was brief but enough for Lorenzo to know he had cornered her.

-I was only... trying to protect you, Lorenzo. That woman isn't trustworthy. We don't even know who she really is.

-I didn't ask you to judge her, Clarisse -he snapped-. I asked you to represent me, to handle this relationship with respect and professionalism. Instead, you've crossed lines you had no right to cross.

-Lorenzo, please don't get upset -she tried to soften her tone-. Everything I do is for your sake. That woman... she...

-Enough! -he interrupted, his patience gone-. Pack your things and return to Colombia immediately.

-What? -Clarisse exclaimed, incredulous-. Are you removing me from the project?

-Yes, Clarisse. This is the end. You've proven you can't handle this responsibility. And since I can't trust you, I can't let you continue in this role.

-Lorenzo, please. You can't do this to me. I've been loyal to you, to the company...

-And I was loyal to you -he cut her off again, his voice low but filled with anger-. But I can't allow your unprofessional behavior to jeopardize this collaboration, let alone let your actions affect an innocent child.

Clarisse remained silent, processing his words.

-This isn't over -she finally said, her tone venomous-. What you're doing is unfair.

-No, Clarisse. What you did was unfair. This is just the consequence of your actions. And let me warn you: if you try anything else against Margaret or her son, I'll take legal action. Am I clear?

-Crystal clear -she replied coldly.

Lorenzo didn't say another word. He simply ended the call, leaving Clarisse alone with her rage and humiliation.

As he leaned against his desk, Lorenzo felt a strange mix of relief and exhaustion. He had drawn a line, something he had never done with his mother or sister. But the biggest challenge still lay ahead, in Paris, with Margaret and the truth he wasn't ready to face.
###chapter 34: The Call of Resentment
Margaret was in her studio, focused on a new design she had started that morning. The delicate lines of the sketch spread across the paper, and for the first time in days, she felt an unusual calm. Mateo was playing quietly in the next room, his occasional laughter filling the space with a warmth that reminded her why she fought so hard.

The sudden ringing of her phone broke the moment. She glanced at the screen. Clarisse. She frowned, hesitating to answer, but something told her she had to face whatever was coming.

-Clarisse? -she answered in a neutral tone, though she knew the call wouldn't be pleasant.

-Margaret, congratulations! -Clarisse exclaimed, her voice dripping with sarcasm-. It seems you finally got what you wanted.

Margaret sighed, feeling her patience slipping away.

-I don't know what you're talking about, Clarisse.

-Oh, don't you? -Clarisse laughed bitterly-. Lorenzo just removed me from the project and ordered me back to Colombia. All thanks to you!

-If Lorenzo made that decision, it was because of something you did, not me -Margaret replied calmly-. I have nothing to do with what happens in your professional life.

-Of course, you do! -Clarisse snapped, losing her composure-. Since you showed up, everything has been a disaster. You show up with your fatherless son, playing the pity card, and now you're manipulating Lorenzo to fill that void, aren't you?

The comment hit like a slap. Margaret closed her eyes for a moment, trying to stay calm, but anger began to rise in her chest.

-Be careful with your words, Clarisse -she said, her voice low but firm-. You have no idea what you're talking about.

-Oh, please! -Clarisse continued, her tone full of venom-. It's obvious what you're doing. Lorenzo has a soft heart, and you're taking advantage of it.

Margaret felt the air around her tense. She couldn't allow Clarisse to keep talking about Mateo that way.

-My son is none of your business, Clarisse -she said sharply-. Neither you nor anyone else has the right to mention him.

-Why? -Clarisse mocked-. Are you afraid Lorenzo will find out something? Is that why you're playing the perfect mother while scheming to manipulate him?

Margaret clenched her teeth, gripping the phone tightly.

-Listen to me, Clarisse. You have no idea what you're saying. I warn you, don't mess with my son. If you ever insinuate something about him or try to harm me, you'll see a side of me you won't like.

The silence on the other end was brief but enough for Margaret to know her warning had struck a nerve.

-This isn't over, Margaret -Clarisse finally said in a colder tone-. Lorenzo might be on your side now, but I won't let you ruin everything I've built.

-What you've built is based on lies and manipulations, Clarisse. Sooner or later, it all falls apart.

Without waiting for a reply, Margaret hung up. She took a deep breath, feeling the anger still coursing through her veins but also a renewed determination.

Clarisse had proven to be a real threat, but Margaret wasn't about to back down. For Mateo, for her peace of mind, and for everything she had achieved, she would fight to the end.

Margaret set the phone down on the table with a sharp thud. Her breathing was rapid, and Clarisse's words kept echoing in her mind. How dare she? With what right did she talk about Mateo and her life as if she knew anything?

From the living room, she heard her son's cheerful voice, oblivious to the storm brewing around them. She took a moment to calm herself before walking in to hug him.

-Are you okay, Mom? -Mateo asked, looking at her with those eyes that reminded her so much of Lorenzo.

-Yes, sweetheart, I'm fine -she replied, stroking his hair lovingly-. Want to go for a walk?

-Yes! -the boy exclaimed excitedly.

Meanwhile, in Colombia

Lorenzo sat in his office, reviewing some documents, but his mind was far from the numbers in front of him. The earlier call with Clarisse had been tense, and though he didn't regret removing her from the project, he knew she wasn't someone to take defeat quietly.

His phone vibrated on the desk, and seeing Clarisse's name on the screen, he let out a heavy sigh. He hesitated for a few seconds before answering.

-What do you want, Clarisse? -he asked impatiently.

-I just wanted to inform you that Margaret is craftier than you think -she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm-. Do you really trust her? Because I wouldn't.

Lorenzo clenched his teeth, trying to remain calm.

-Clarisse, I don't have time for your manipulations. I already told you to go back to Colombia and stay out of the project. Don't insist.

-Manipulations? -she laughed-. I'm surprised you're talking about manipulations when you have a woman who's been hiding things from you all along.

-What are you talking about? -he asked, though his tone made it clear he didn't want to play games.

-Her son, Lorenzo. Doesn't it strike you as odd that Margaret is so secretive about him? Have you ever wondered who the father is?

Lorenzo's heart skipped a beat. He didn't respond immediately, but his silence was enough for Clarisse to continue.

-I'll just say this: be careful. Margaret isn't as transparent as you think. Maybe you should do some digging yourself.

Lorenzo ended the call without another word. His mind was in turmoil. He didn't know if there was any truth to what Clarisse was saying, but part of him was beginning to wonder if he should confront Margaret directly.

Back in Paris

Margaret and Mateo strolled through a nearby park. The fresh breeze and her son's laughter gave her some peace after the confrontation with Clarisse. However, she couldn't shake the feeling that something else was coming.

Her phone vibrated again in her pocket. She pulled it out, fearing it was Clarisse again, but Lorenzo's name lit up the screen.

She hesitated for a few seconds before answering.

-Lorenzo?

-Margaret, I need to talk to you -he said, his voice more serious than usual-. It's important.

His tone put her on edge.

-Sure, tell me.

-In person. I'll be in Paris in a few days.

Margaret felt the ground shift beneath her feet. She hadn't expected Lorenzo to make such a sudden decision.

-Alright. Call me when you arrive.

She hung up, feeling as though time had stopped. Lorenzo was coming to Paris, and though she didn't know exactly what he wanted to talk about, she was sure it would change everything.
###chapter 35: Inevitable Encounters
It had been a week since that call, and although Margaret had tried to keep her routine, the news of Lorenzo's arrival in Paris unsettled her. Every time she thought about seeing him, her chest tightened. What did he want to say? What had he discovered?

That morning, the Parisian sky was gray, as if the city shared her uncertainty. Margaret dropped Mateo off at daycare and returned home, intending to get some work done. But she couldn't focus. She paced the living room, trying to distract herself, but her mind kept returning to the same thought: Lorenzo.

The doorbell startled her. She checked the time; she wasn't expecting anyone. When she opened the door, her heart skipped a beat.

-Lorenzo.

He stood there, impeccably dressed, with a determined expression and something else she couldn't quite place.

-May I come in? -he asked, his voice low.

Margaret hesitated before stepping aside.

Lorenzo entered, holding out a bouquet of flowers.

Margaret took them hesitantly, then turned to place them in a vase on the table.

-You'd better have something important to say -she remarked.

Lorenzo stood in the middle of the room, the weight of his words evident on his face.

-Clarisse won't bother you anymore.

Margaret spun around, shocked.

-What does that mean?

Lorenzo took a deep breath.

-It means I spoke with her. I made things clear. I removed her from her position and asked her to return to Colombia. She has no excuse to interfere with you anymore.

Margaret narrowed her eyes.

-Do you really think it's that simple? Clarisse isn't the type to accept "no" as an answer.

-I know -Lorenzo replied firmly-. But this time, she has no choice. I made a decision, and she knows I won't back down.

Margaret studied him, searching for ulterior motives.

-Why did you do it? Do I suddenly matter so much to you?

Lorenzo lowered his gaze for a moment, choosing his words carefully.

-Because I was wrong. I let her cross lines I never should have allowed. But this isn't just about you. It's about me too. I'm tired of letting others control my life.

Margaret felt a lump in her throat but masked it with a sardonic smile.

-Nice speech, Lorenzo. Let's see if you stick to it.

Lorenzo nodded slowly, accepting her challenge.

-I will. I'm tired of losing what truly matters.

The silence that followed was heavy, filled with unspoken emotions. Finally, Margaret broke it.

-Is that all you came to say?

Lorenzo stepped closer, his gaze softer.

-I just want you to know I'm here. No matter how long it takes, I'll prove you can trust me.

Margaret didn't respond, simply nodded faintly and looked away.

As Lorenzo prepared to leave, he added:

-Thank you for listening.

When the door closed behind him, Margaret remained still, staring at the flowers. Despite everything, something about Lorenzo's words echoed within her.

In the hallway, Lorenzo exhaled deeply. It was just one step, but he knew he was closer to earning his place in Margaret and Mateo's lives again.

He reached the elevator, hands in his pockets, his mind restless. As the doors opened, he clenched his teeth and turned back impulsively. Walking briskly to Margaret's door, he knocked firmly.

Margaret opened it again, surprise and weariness on her face.

-Did you forget something? -she asked dryly.

Lorenzo shook his head, breathing deeply.

-No. But there's something else I need to say.

Margaret raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms.

-What is it now? Another empty promise?

-No, this is different -he stepped forward, making her retreat as he entered.

Margaret sighed, closing the door, clearly frustrated.

-If you're here to repeat yourself, we can do this later. I'm tired.

-It's not that -Lorenzo interrupted, his voice soft but laden with emotion-. Margaret, I need to be honest with you.

Her skeptical look faltered under the weight of his words.

-Since I arrived in Paris, something in me has changed -he continued, locking his eyes on hers-. And I can't ignore it anymore.

Margaret frowned, unsure of where this was headed.

-What are you talking about?

Lorenzo took a deep breath as though the words cost him more than he expected.

-You. I'm starting to feel things for you, Margaret.

The air in the room stilled. Margaret blinked, utterly confused.

-What...? -she stammered-. Lorenzo, what are you saying?

-Exactly what you heard -he said, stepping closer-. I don't know how or when it started, but I can't get you out of my head.

Margaret stepped back, needing distance to think clearly.

-This is ridiculous. We've barely talked beyond work.

-I know. But I can't help how I feel. There's something about you that feels like I've known you forever.

-You can't tell me this now -Margaret said, shaking her head, struggling to regain control-. It's too much.

Lorenzo tilted his head, observing her closely.

-I know it's unexpected. But I needed to be honest. I'm done hiding how I feel.

Margaret pressed a hand to her forehead, trying to sort through her thoughts.

-This changes nothing -she finally said, her voice trembling slightly-. We're here for work, Lorenzo. We can't mix things.

Lorenzo nodded, though the intensity in his gaze remained.

-I understand. But I can't promise my feelings will just disappear. I wanted you to know. And I'll do whatever it takes to win your heart.

Margaret stood silent, unable to respond. Lorenzo's truth shook her in ways she wasn't ready to admit.

Finally, Lorenzo stepped back, respecting her space.

-I don't expect an answer now. I just wanted to be honest.

Without another word, he turned and left, leaving Margaret alone with her thoughts.

She sank onto the sofa, her mind spinning. Lorenzo's words echoed, and for the first time in a long time, she felt her carefully constructed world start to crumble.
###chapter 36: Confusion and Decisions
Margaret spent the night tossing and turning. Lorenzo's words echoed in her mind, each one loaded with an intensity she didn't know how to handle. She knew him too well, even as "Margaret," to not notice the sincerity in his voice. But this Lorenzo, the one who confessed feelings, wasn't the same man who had left her alone years ago.

When morning finally came, Margaret got up, determined to distract herself with work. Mateo played quietly in the living room while she reviewed some sketches on her computer. But no matter how hard she tried, Lorenzo remained stuck in her thoughts.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed, pulling her out of her reverie. She glanced at it, her heart skipping a beat when she saw Lorenzo's name on the screen. She hesitated for a moment before answering.

-Good morning, Lorenzo.
-Good morning, Margaret. I hope I'm not disturbing you.
-Not at all. How can I help you?
-I'd like to meet with you today. There's something important I need to discuss regarding our collaboration.
Margaret took a deep breath, trying to keep her composure.
-Is it urgent? I have some things to handle this morning.
-It's important, but I can adjust to your schedule.
-Fine. Let's meet after lunch. How about the usual café?
-Perfect. See you there.

As the call ended, Margaret let out a heavy sigh. She knew this meeting wouldn't be easy, especially after his confession the night before.

\---

The café was quiet when Margaret arrived. Lorenzo was already there, sitting by the window with a cup in his hand. He stood as she entered, giving her a smile that, for a moment, reminded her of the man she once fell in love with.

-Thanks for coming -he said, motioning to the chair across from him.
-No problem. What's so important? -she asked, getting straight to the point.

Lorenzo placed his cup on the table and looked at her intently.
-Margaret, I know I surprised you last night with what I said. It wasn't my intention to make you uncomfortable.
Margaret crossed her arms, her heart beginning to race.
-Lorenzo, if this is about...
-Let me finish -he interrupted gently, leaning slightly toward her-. What I feel is real, but I'm not here to pressure you. I just want to be honest, something I wasn't in the past.

Margaret studied him, her gaze steady.
-Why now? -she asked, her voice filled with restrained emotion-. Why after all this time?

Lorenzo looked away briefly, as if searching for the right words.
-Because I'm learning from my mistakes. Because I don't want to leave important things unsaid anymore.

Margaret pressed her lips together, struggling to remain composed. Her mind swirled with questions, but one stood out above all.
-And your wife? -she finally asked, a mix of challenge and curiosity in her tone.

Lorenzo seemed taken aback by the question but quickly recovered.
-There's no one else in my life, Margaret -he said firmly, his eyes locked on hers-. Amelia left years ago, and all I've done since is regret not fighting for her.

His words pierced Margaret's defenses, but she wasn't ready to give in to emotion.
-So now you're trying to fill that void with me? -she asked, her tone cold.

Lorenzo shook his head.
-No, it's not that. What I feel for you is different. I'm here because I want to start over, because you deserve to know what's on my mind.

Margaret stood, feeling the need for air.
-This is too much, Lorenzo. I need time to process.

Lorenzo nodded, resigned.
-Take it. I'm not here to rush you, Margaret. I just wanted to be honest.

She gave him one last look before walking away. As she left, Lorenzo sighed deeply. He had said what he felt, but he knew winning Margaret's trust would be the hardest challenge of his life.

\---

Margaret returned home with a lingering sense of unease. Mateo played happily in the living room, blissfully unaware of his mother's emotional storm. She bent down to kiss his forehead before retreating to her bedroom. She needed to be alone.

Closing the door behind her, she collapsed onto the bed, staring at the ceiling. Lorenzo's words echoed in her mind like an endless loop: "What I feel for you is different."

She turned onto her side, hugging a pillow as if it could ease the weight on her chest.

-What are you looking for, Lorenzo? -she murmured into the air.

On one hand, his confessions seemed sincere, but on the other, she couldn't stop questioning his intentions. Had he truly moved on from Amelia, or was he simply trying to fill the void she left behind?

Margaret got up and walked to the desk where she often designed. Inside a small wooden box, she kept letters and mementos from her past life as Amelia. She pulled out a photo from her wedding with Lorenzo, an image she hadn't had the courage to destroy.

In the photo, Lorenzo looked at her with a mix of love and pride. That gaze had been her safe haven for so long but had also become her greatest pain when he stopped looking at her that way.

-Did you really forget me, Lorenzo? -she whispered, staring at the photo-. Or are you just looking for someone to take my place?

The doubts hit her hard. If he had truly let go of Amelia, why was he now so interested in Margaret? Were his feelings genuine, or just a reflection of what they once had?

Margaret placed the photo back in the box and walked to the window. Outside, the lights of Paris illuminated the night, but inside her heart, only shadows remained.

-I can't take that risk again -she said to herself, crossing her arms-. I can't let him hurt me again.

As much as she wanted to believe in Lorenzo's sincerity, she knew she had to protect herself, especially for Mateo's sake. She couldn't let anyone play with her emotions, least of all someone who once had the power to destroy her.

Yet, a small part of her, the one that still held onto a sliver of hope, wanted to believe Lorenzo had changed. But for that, he'd have to prove it with more than just words.

Margaret sighed deeply and sat back on the bed. She looked at the photo once more before putting it away.

-If you've really forgotten Amelia, Lorenzo, then you have a lot to prove. Because this time, I won't lose myself for you.

Her decision was made. Margaret would face Lorenzo with strength, but also with her heart guarded. If he wanted to be part of her life again, he'd have to earn her trust from scratch. And this time, there would be no second chances.
 ###chapter 37: Confidences at the Tower
Margaret woke up with a heavy heart. Lorenzo's words still echoed in her mind, but she wasn't ready to face them alone. She decided she needed someone to talk to, someone who had always been her unwavering support: Adrien.

They met at noon in a small café near the Eiffel Tower, a place where they used to gather before life became so complicated. Adrien arrived with a warm smile and a wool scarf that seemed to wrap him completely.

-Margaret, is everything okay? -he asked as he sat across from her, noticing the tension in her expression.

She sighed, staring at her coffee cup before responding.

-I don't know, Adrien. Lorenzo is here, in Paris.

Adrien raised an eyebrow, setting his coffee down.

-What is he doing here?

Margaret shrugged.

-He says he's here for business, but... his actions are confusing me. Yesterday, he confessed he still has feelings for me.

Adrien remained silent for a moment, processing the information. Finally, he leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table.

-And what do you feel?

The question struck her like lightning. She had spent so long trying to bury her feelings for Lorenzo that she wasn't sure how to answer.

-I don't know -she admitted at last-. Part of me wants to believe him, but the other... I can't forget everything that happened. I can't trust him so easily.

Adrien nodded, his gaze soft but firm.

-And you shouldn't. But you also need to ask yourself something important, Margaret: is this about you or Mateo?

She lowered her gaze, gripping her cup tightly.

-It's about both of us. I don't want Mateo to grow up feeling like something is missing in his life. But I also can't risk Lorenzo breaking us again.

Adrien leaned back, crossing his arms.

-Margaret, you're one of the strongest women I know. You've built an incredible life for yourself and for your son. But if Lorenzo wants to be part of that, he has to prove he deserves it. And you, my dear friend, don't have to decide anything now.

Margaret looked at him with a small smile, grateful for his support.

-You always know what to say.

Adrien shrugged with a mischievous smile.

-It's my job, isn't it?

When they left the café, Adrien insisted they take a walk by the Seine. Margaret, still burdened, agreed. They strolled slowly, talking about everything and nothing, when Adrien broke the silence with an unexpected question.

-What if Lorenzo tries to get close to Mateo?

Margaret stopped in her tracks, her gaze fixed on the river.

-I won't allow it, not until I'm sure of his intentions. Mateo doesn't deserve to be part of something uncertain.

Adrien nodded, placing a hand on her shoulder.

-Then make sure you hold your ground. If Lorenzo wants a place in your life, he'll have to earn it. And if he tries to take advantage of you or Mateo... well, you know I'll always be here to defend you both.

Margaret let out a small laugh, relieved by his unwavering support.

-I know, Adrien. I know.

As the sun began to set behind the buildings of Paris, Margaret felt a little calm return to her heart. Lorenzo could try whatever he wanted, but she was clear this time she wouldn't face it alone.

After their walk along the Seine, Adrien insisted on taking Margaret to a small hidden park, a place only true Parisians knew. There, under a sky painted with warm colors by the sunset, they sat on a worn wooden bench surrounded by trees whose leaves gently fell.

Adrien watched Margaret as she absentmindedly played with a leaf that had landed on her lap. There was something in her eyes, a mix of strength and vulnerability that had always fascinated him. Finally, he broke the silence.

-Margaret, there's something I've been wanting to tell you for a long time.

She looked up at him, curious but slightly uneasy. Adrien had always been honest, but this time his tone was different, more solemn.

-What is it? -she asked softly.

He took a deep breath, resting his elbows on his knees as he looked ahead, avoiding her eyes.

-I know I've always been by your side, as a friend, as support... and I want you to know that will never change. But I think you need to know something, something I've perhaps hidden too well.

Margaret watched him silently, her heart beating faster.

-Adrien...

He raised a hand to stop her before she could say more.

-Let me finish. I don't expect anything from you, nor do I want to pressure you. But the truth is... I'm in love with you, Margaret. I have been for years, and you already know that.

The confession left her speechless. Adrien continued, his voice calm but full of emotion.

-I know you don't feel the same way about me, and that's okay. I'm not saying this to change anything between us. I just needed you to know that hasn't changed. Because even if my heart belongs to you, my priority will always be to protect you. You and Mateo.

Margaret felt a lump in her throat. Adrien had been her rock during the darkest moments, and now she understood the sacrifice that had meant for him.

-Adrien... I don't know what to say.

He smiled, with the warmth that had always comforted her.

-You don't have to say anything. I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I'll always be here for you. Even if Lorenzo comes back into your life, even if you decide to give him a chance, I'll be by your side-as a friend, as family... as whatever you need.

Tears filled Margaret's eyes. She leaned toward him and took his hands in hers.

-You're the best man I've ever known, Adrien. I don't deserve this much.

Adrien shook his head, looking at her tenderly.

-Don't say that. You and Mateo are my family. And though it hurts to know I'll never be more than your friend, that's enough for me. Because all I want is to see you happy.

Margaret hugged him tightly, letting her emotions flow. Adrien wrapped his arms around her, offering the comfort and safety he had always provided.

-Thank you, Adrien. For everything.

When they finally pulled apart, both had tears in their eyes but also a deeper understanding of their connection. As they walked back under the starlit sky, Margaret felt that no matter what happened with Lorenzo or her past, she would always have Adrien as her refuge. And that was a relief amid the storm ahead.
###chapter 38: Pending Words
Lorenzo remained in his hotel room, staring out the window at the rooftops of Paris stretching under the gray sky. He had been in the city for days but still couldn't summon the courage to take the next step. Seeing Margaret, who was Amelia, filled him with conflicting emotions: guilt, hope, and a paralyzing fear. How could he face someone he had failed in so many ways?

Meanwhile, Margaret was in her workshop, working on a new design. The lines on the paper took shape almost automatically, but her mind was elsewhere. Lorenzo's unexpected visit lingered in her thoughts. She had felt him closer, but she couldn't forget his words. What was behind them? A genuine attempt to reconnect or just a way to fill the void his absence had left?

Adrien arrived at her workshop that afternoon, as he often did to make sure she was okay. Holding a cup of coffee, he approached her desk.

-You've been here all day, haven't you? -he asked, his warm smile tinged with concern.

Margaret nodded, not looking up from the design. -I couldn't stay still. I needed to keep my mind busy.

He smiled and took her hand. -I just want you to be happy, even if it's not with me.

The moment was interrupted by the sound of Margaret's phone. It was a message from Lorenzo:

"We need to talk. Tonight at my hotel. There are things I can't keep to myself anymore."

Margaret felt her heart race. Adrien noticed the change in her expression and stepped back.

-It's Lorenzo, isn't it? -he asked, a mix of resignation and understanding in his tone.

Margaret nodded slowly, unsure of what to say.

-Then go. But remember, Margaret, don't let anyone else control your life. Not even him.

She looked at him gratefully before gathering her things and asking him to pick up Mateo. As she left the workshop, Adrien's words echoed in her mind. Lorenzo had something to say, but was she ready to hear it? More importantly, was she ready to confront her own feelings?

Margaret arrived at the hotel just as the sun began to set behind the buildings of Paris. She had rehearsed countless speeches in her mind during the journey, but none seemed sufficient. As she entered the lobby, her heart pounded. This wasn't just a conversation; it was a confrontation with everything she had tried to bury over the years.

Lorenzo was waiting for her on the private terrace of his room, the breathtaking view of the illuminated Eiffel Tower in the background. He stood with his hands in his pockets, his gaze fixed on the horizon, as if searching for the courage to say what needed to be said.

When Margaret appeared at the door, Lorenzo turned toward her. Their eyes met, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still.

-Thank you for coming -he said, breaking the silence.

-What's so urgent that it couldn't wait? -she asked, crossing her arms in an attempt to maintain some distance.

Lorenzo sighed and gestured toward a chair by the table. -Please, have a seat.

Margaret eyed him cautiously before sitting down. He did the same but didn't seem at ease.

-I don't know where to start -he admitted, running a hand through his hair.

Margaret stared at him, her heart pounding. -Then just talk.

Lorenzo took a deep breath before beginning. -Since I returned to Paris and started working with you, I've felt something I didn't expect.

Margaret interrupted him, her voice filled with disbelief. -Something you didn't expect? Like what?

Lorenzo held her gaze, his dark eyes full of emotion. -I've started falling in love with you, Margaret.

The silence that followed was almost deafening. Margaret felt the air leave her lungs.

-With me? -she repeated, her voice barely a whisper.

Lorenzo nodded. -Yes. But I don't want you to think I'm trying to replace Amelia.

The mention of her other self fell between them like a stone. Margaret swallowed hard, trying to hold back the tears threatening to escape.

-And what about Amelia? -she finally asked, her voice laced with a mix of pain and curiosity. -Have you really forgotten her?

Lorenzo lowered his gaze, as if the question had struck him in the chest. -I could never forget her, even if I tried. But I also know I can't live clinging to the past. I failed her by trusting my family, and though I love her, I'm also falling for you. I don't want you to think I'm some kind of womanizer, but I'm so confused.

Margaret felt her heart shatter into pieces. She didn't know whether to cry over Lorenzo's words or what they meant for her.

-Lorenzo, this is complicated -she finally said, her voice trembling. -I don't know if I'm ready for this.

He leaned closer to her, his eyes filled with desperation and hope. -Just tell me you'll think about it. I'm not asking for an answer now. But please, don't close the door yet.

Margaret looked at him, feeling a mixture of love, confusion, and pain. She nodded slowly, knowing she couldn't give him an answer that night.

As Lorenzo walked her to the door, he took her hand for a moment, stopping her.

Margaret left the hotel with her heart in turmoil. The cool Parisian breeze brushed her face but couldn't extinguish the fire burning inside her. She walked aimlessly, trying to organize her thoughts, though each one clashed with the next.

Lorenzo was opening a door she wasn't sure she should cross. It was like a dark abyss, alluring and dangerous all at once. She remembered the tears she had shed for him, the lonely nights as their marriage crumbled before her eyes. Now he was back, not as the man she had loved, but as someone else... someone who claimed to be changing.

The city, with its characteristic bustle, seemed oblivious to her pain. Margaret turned a corner and stopped in front of a small café, its warm lights flickering in the night. She leaned against a lamppost, watching couples laugh and share glances full of promises. How could Lorenzo speak of love now, after everything that had happened?

Yet what tormented her most was a question that kept repeating in her mind: What if this time, he's truly willing to fight for her?

She bit her lip, feeling a mix of anger and hope. What if Lorenzo had changed? What if he really was trying to be better? But could she risk it again? Let him back into her life only for everything to fall apart once more?

Margaret closed her eyes, trying to hold back her tears. Her heart was divided. On one side, the love she had once felt for Lorenzo was still there, like a wound that had never fully healed. On the other, there was fear-a deep fear of reliving the pain and betrayal.

Margaret began walking again, this time with firmer steps. She couldn't let Lorenzo's words cloud her judgment. She needed time, clarity, and above all, answers. Because if there was one thing she had learned in recent years, it was that promises could be empty, but actions were what truly spoke.
###chapter 39: Under the Spotlight
The invitation had arrived days earlier, embossed in gold on fine paper that exuded elegance. It was the birthday celebration of a renowned industry magnate, one of Margaret's key clients and, recently, an ally of Lorenzo. Although Margaret had tried to excuse herself, knowing attending meant sharing the same space as Lorenzo, business circumstances forced her to accept.

The evening took place in a grand Parisian ballroom, illuminated by chandeliers casting golden reflections on the marble walls. Margaret arrived in a classic black gown adorned with subtle beading that accentuated her figure. Her hair was styled in an elegant bun, exposing her neck, adorned only by a simple necklace she had designed years ago.

Lorenzo was already there when she arrived. His perfectly tailored dark suit, combined with his confident demeanor, made him stand out among the guests. When he saw her, a faint smile touched his lips, but Margaret avoided his gaze and approached the host to greet him.

The dinner was a display of luxury: exquisitely prepared dishes and formal conversations filled the air. Lorenzo, seated directly across from Margaret, didn't take his eyes off her for a moment. Every word they exchanged with others carried a subtext only they understood.

When dessert was served, and the live orchestra began to play, the host rose and invited everyone to dance. Couples moved to the center of the floor as the lights dimmed, creating an intimate and magical atmosphere.

Lorenzo seized the opportunity and approached Margaret.

-Would you grant me this dance? -he asked, extending his hand.

Margaret hesitated. She knew accepting would lead to dangerous territory, but under the watchful eyes of others-and her own conflicted emotions-she couldn't refuse.

-Just one dance -she replied, placing her hand in his.

He led her to the center of the floor as the notes of a waltz enveloped them. Lorenzo gently placed a hand on her waist while she rested hers on his shoulder. The closeness was inevitable, and with every turn, Margaret felt her heartbeat quicken.

-You look stunning tonight -Lorenzo whispered, breaking the silence between them.

Margaret averted her gaze, uneasy yet touched by his sincerity.

-We're not here to talk about that -she replied, trying to maintain composure.

Lorenzo allowed a faint smile.

-Maybe not, but I can't help it.

The music slowed, forcing them to move closer. Their eyes finally met, and for a moment, the world seemed to fade away. Margaret could feel the weight of emotions she had tried to suppress, but also the danger of giving in to them.

-Lorenzo, this isn't... -she began, but he interrupted her.

-What, Margaret? Wrong? Impossible? Or just what you've been avoiding?

Before she could respond, Lorenzo leaned in, and their lips met in a kiss that was both unexpected and inevitable. The initial softness gave way to restrained passion, a mix of longing, regret, and unspoken love.

The ballroom seemed to freeze. Margaret felt the world tilt beneath her feet, but she didn't pull away from Lorenzo. For an instant, she allowed herself to forget the wounds of the past and the weight of their circumstances.

When they broke apart, both were breathing heavily, their faces mere inches apart. Margaret took a step back, her expression a mix of confusion and emotion.

-This can't happen again -she murmured, though her voice lacked conviction.

-Margaret... -Lorenzo began, but she shook her head.

-Not tonight.

Without another word, she turned and left the dance floor, leaving Lorenzo standing still, his gaze fixed on her retreating figure as she disappeared into the crowd. Each step she took felt like a pang in his chest, reminding him how fragile everything he was trying to rebuild truly was. Lorenzo closed his eyes briefly, breathing deeply, trying to calm the storm inside him. His chest filled with renewed determination: he wasn't going to give up so easily. But he knew that to win Margaret back, he'd have to prove himself-not just with words, but with actions.

In a corner of the ballroom, Margaret leaned against a column, her body tense and her hands trembling as one rose to her lips. She could still feel the warmth of Lorenzo's kiss, the intensity of a love she thought she had buried. Closing her eyes tightly, she tried to suppress the emotions threatening to overwhelm her.

-What am I doing? -she whispered to herself, her voice barely audible over the distant hum of music and laughter.

The kiss had stirred something deep within her-a blend of nostalgia and fear. She had tried to be strong, to keep her distance, but Lorenzo always seemed to find a way to break through her defenses. It was as if the universe wanted to remind her that, despite everything, he was still the man she had loved with every fiber of her being. But he was also the man who had broken her heart.

Margaret clenched her eyes shut, holding back the tears that threatened to spill. She couldn't allow herself to be vulnerable again-not with him. The scars she bore still hurt too much.

Meanwhile, Lorenzo remained on the dance floor, staring at the spot where she had disappeared. His jaw tightened, and his fists clenched at his sides. He wanted to chase after her, to tell her that this time was different, that he wasn't the same man who had let her go. But something held him back-perhaps the fear of pushing her further away.

Instead of following her, Lorenzo walked to the nearest table, where an abandoned glass of wine caught his attention. He picked it up and took a sip, trying to calm the turmoil inside him. But the taste of the wine wasn't enough to erase the sensation of her lips on his, the electricity that had coursed through his skin when he held her in his arms.

-Margaret... -he murmured, almost as a prayer to the air.

Across the room, Margaret finally forced herself to open her eyes. She watched the couples still dancing, oblivious to her internal storm. Her breathing was still uneven, and her mind was full of unanswered questions.

"Why now, Lorenzo?" she thought, biting her lower lip. "What's behind this? Is it real? Or are you just trying to fill the emptiness inside you?"

The thought made her straighten, her expression hardening with determination. She couldn't afford to fall again-not unless he was completely certain. Not if their past continued to cast a shadow between them.

But a small voice inside her, barely audible, whispered something different. A voice that wanted to believe that this time, Lorenzo was truly willing to fight for what they once had. A voice that desperately hoped that maybe, just maybe, there was still a chance for them.

Margaret shook her head, trying to silence that traitorous voice. She straightened her posture, adjusted her dress, and walked toward the ballroom exit. But with every step she took, the sensation of Lorenzo's lips on hers lingered, an echo she couldn't erase.

And Lorenzo, from across the room, watched her walk away once more, feeling something inside him break... but also vowing that this wouldn't be the last time he had her close.
###chapter 40: Love Comes and Goes
Margaret woke up the next day with a strange mix of emotions. The memory of Lorenzo's kiss lingered, but it brought a wave of doubt and guilt. As she looked in the mirror, she tried to convince herself it was a mistake, a fleeting weakness she had to overcome.

The doorbell interrupted her thoughts. Adjusting her silk robe, she walked to the door. When she opened it, she found Adrien holding a small box.

-I hope I'm not disturbing you, Margaret. I brought this for Mateo. -Adrien's warm smile was tinged with concern, which Margaret immediately noticed.

-You're never a disturbance, Adrien. Come in.

As Adrien stepped inside, Margaret felt grateful for his presence. He always knew how to calm her storms, even without saying much.

-Is everything okay? -Adrien asked, sitting on the couch.

Margaret crossed her arms, biting her lip as she debated whether to share what had happened the night before. Finally, she decided to open up.

-Adrien, as you know, Lorenzo is here in Paris. We attended a business dinner together... and things got complicated. -Her voice trailed off, as if saying it aloud made it more real.

Adrien raised an eyebrow but stayed silent, waiting for her to continue.

-He kissed me. -The words burst out, and she looked at Adrien, bracing for his reaction.

Adrien's face remained neutral for a moment before he sighed deeply.

-How do you feel about it?

Margaret sank onto the couch beside him, covering her face with her hands.

-Confused. Angry. Maybe... something else. -Her voice quivered slightly.

Adrien studied her silently before speaking.

-Margaret, this is hard, I know. But you need to ask yourself something important: Did that kiss mean anything to you, or is it just tying you to a past you're trying to leave behind?

She looked at him, her eyes brimming with unshed tears.

-I don't know, Adrien. Every time I think I'm ready to move on, he shows up and messes everything up.

Adrien leaned forward, resting his hands on his knees.

-Margaret, whatever happens, I want you to know I'll always be here for you. No matter what you decide or who you choose. My priority will always be you and Mateo.

Margaret felt a lump in her throat. Adrien had always been her rock, the one constant in her life when everything else fell apart.

-Thank you, Adrien. I don't know what I'd do without you.

After Adrien left, Margaret felt even more torn. Lorenzo and Adrien represented two completely different parts of her life: the past filled with love and betrayal and the present full of stability and support.

Elsewhere in Paris, Lorenzo sat on his hotel terrace, a glass of wine in hand. He gazed at the city, reflecting on the kiss from the night before. It had been impulsive, but he didn't regret it. He had felt something in Margaret that he hadn't in years-a spark of connection, a trace of what they once shared.

But he also knew Margaret was battling her own demons. If he wanted to win her over, he would need to prove he wasn't the man who had hurt her. That meant time, patience, and most of all, action.

He picked up his phone and sent a message.

-I hope I'm not disturbing you, Margaret. I'd like to see you tomorrow. There's something I need to tell you.

He set the phone down, feeling a weight in his chest as he waited for her response. He didn't know exactly what he would say, but he knew he had to try.

Margaret read the message hours later, while Mateo played in the living room. Her hands trembled as she held the phone, but she knew she couldn't avoid Lorenzo forever.

"All right. Tomorrow at five."

After sending the reply, Margaret felt a mix of anticipation and fear. Lorenzo was willing to fight, but was she ready to let him back into her life?

Margaret left her house, leaving Mateo with Adrien. She felt nervous, her heart heavy. After a while, she arrived at the café where Lorenzo was waiting. He was already seated by a window, his expression calm, but his eyes carried something she couldn't decipher. When he saw her, Lorenzo stood up and smiled-that smile that always managed to unsettle her.

-Thank you for coming -he said, pulling out the chair for her.

-I hope this is worth it -Margaret replied, keeping her tone distant as she sat down.

Lorenzo didn't respond immediately. He took a sip of his coffee, studying her, as if trying to memorize every detail of her face.

-It's always worth it when it's about you.

Margaret frowned, but her heart skipped a beat. She knew Lorenzo had a way with words, and she promised herself not to be swayed.

-What do you want, Lorenzo? -she asked bluntly.

He rested his elbows on the table, intertwining his fingers as he leaned forward slightly.

-I want to know you, Margaret. I want to know what makes you laugh, what inspires you, what keeps you up at night.

His sincerity caught her off guard.

-That sounds like something a man says when he's trying to woo someone.

-And what if I am? -Lorenzo replied, his gaze fixed on hers.

Margaret felt her defenses begin to crack.

-You have a wife, Lorenzo. Have you forgotten about her?

The question surprised him, but Lorenzo remained composed.

-No, I haven't forgotten her. But sometimes, life takes us down unexpected paths. And right now, mine leads to you.

Margaret tensed, struggling to maintain her mask of indifference.

-I'm not a consolation for your mistakes, Lorenzo.

-I don't see you as a consolation. I see you as a second chance for something real.

Lorenzo's words struck directly at emotions Margaret had tried to bury. Before she could respond, he continued:

-I know it's hard for you to trust me, and I don't blame you. But I'm not here to force you into anything. I just want to show you that I can be someone you trust, someone who values you for who you are.

Margaret looked at him, trying to read his true intentions. There was something different about him, something she couldn't ignore.

-I can't promise you anything, Lorenzo -she whispered, her voice breaking.

Lorenzo nodded, accepting her words without pressuring her.

-I'm not asking for promises, Margaret. Just a chance.

The silence between them was broken only by the murmur of other customers in the café. Margaret knew Lorenzo was playing with fire, but what terrified her was the possibility that she wanted to get burned too.
###chapter 41: The Hidden Secret
Margaret was sitting across from Lorenzo in the small café in Paris, surrounded by the calm of the midday. The conversation flowed naturally between them, but inside her, the words she had been holding back for so long were pressing against her chest like a ticking time bomb ready to explode. The silence between them was comfortable, but there was something in the air that made her feel tenser than she would have liked.

Lorenzo, unaware of her inner turmoil, smiled as he told her something about his trip back to Colombia and his plans with the company. But Margaret couldn't focus on anything other than the weight of her secret. She knew that if she revealed it, everything would change. Everything she had built over this time, all the peace she had managed to find in her life, would crumble. If she told him the truth about who she really was, she wasn't sure she could handle Lorenzo's reaction.

-Is something wrong, Margaret? -asked Lorenzo, noticing that her gaze was more distant than usual. Margaret looked him in the eyes, searching for a way to steer the conversation, but something in his face showed her that he had already sensed that something wasn't right.

-No, it's nothing -she replied with a tense smile, hoping he wouldn't insist. Sometimes, she wished she could be as honest with him as she used to be in the past, but the fear of rejection held her back.

Lorenzo studied her for a moment, as if he could read between the lines. Margaret felt anxiety start to rise within her, but she forced herself to stay calm. She couldn't let him discover what she had been keeping silent for so long.

-Margaret, you know you can tell me anything. I've always said that, right? -he said, with that confidence he always gave her.

But Margaret couldn't. She couldn't risk everything for something as uncertain as the truth. Deep down, she knew that if she told him what she really felt and what she had been hiding, she could lose everything she had with him. The love she felt for Lorenzo was so strong and deep that the idea that it could end with a simple mistake, a single poorly told secret, terrified her.

-I know -she replied softly, unable to look him in the eyes-. But there are things that sometimes it's better to leave them in the past.

Lorenzo leaned slightly toward her, trying to understand, but didn't press. Instead, he gave her a smile, as if he respected her space.

-If you ever decide to tell me, I'll be here, without judging you -he said, unaware of what he was asking for. Margaret felt a knot in her stomach. She knew that if she ever decided to tell him the truth, the connection they shared would be tested in ways she couldn't foresee.

Inside, doubt tormented her. What would Lorenzo do if he discovered who she really was? Would he feel betrayed by the lie? Or worse, would she lose everything by hiding something so fundamental?

The café continued with its calm rhythm, and Margaret, although surrounded by the warmth of the city, felt more alone than ever. She couldn't get the thought out of her mind that, despite her efforts to keep her secret safe, something inside her was slowly crumbling. She knew the decisions she was making, the lies being woven around her identity, would never stop haunting her.

But it didn't matter what she felt. She couldn't turn back. Not now.

Lorenzo looked at her again, searching for any sign that something wasn't right, but Margaret gave him the best smile she could, fearful that if he looked any closer, he would see what was truly behind her eyes.

What he didn't know was that, beyond the lies and secrets, Margaret had already made a decision: the love she felt for him, although real, could not overcome the fears that tormented her. Maybe one day she could be honest with him, but not at that moment, not yet.

-Would you like to go for a walk around the city? -Lorenzo asked, trying to lighten the mood, unaware of the internal storm she was living through.

-I'd love to -Margaret replied, relieved by the change of subject. She took her coffee with both hands, closed her eyes for a moment, and prepared for the day that still lay ahead. Despite the unspoken words, despite the secret that consumed her, she tried not to let fear control her.

And as Lorenzo stood up to grab his coat, Margaret promised herself that she would move forward, that she would find a way to deal with her past without him discovering it. After all, she couldn't change what she had already done, but she could control what she did from now on.

For now, all she had to do was enjoy the present, with all the doubts and fears that came with it.

The walk through the streets of Paris was just what they both needed. The cool breeze of the afternoon brushed their faces, and the hustle and bustle of the city gave them a sense of normalcy. Lorenzo walked by her side, enjoying every moment, but there was something in the way Margaret responded, in her prolonged silences, that he couldn't ignore.

He knew there was something more, something she wasn't telling him. Their relationship, although growing stronger, was still fragile. The love between them, so intense, was being tainted by the shadow of a secret Margaret seemed to guard so jealously. And that worried him.

As they crossed the Pont des Arts, where tourists gathered to take photos and admire the view, Lorenzo decided he could wait no longer. He knew something wasn't right, and if he didn't ask now, it would torment him. He couldn't keep carrying that uncertainty, not when all he wanted was to be closer to her.

-Margaret-he said softly, stopping in front of her and taking her hands. His gaze, full of concern and affection, rested on her face-. I don't know you well, but I don't need to in order to know something is bothering you. What is really going on?

Margaret stopped as well, feeling her heart beat loudly in her chest. She looked into Lorenzo's eyes, and a pang of pain struck her. She knew she couldn't hide it any longer, but at the same time, the fear of losing him, of destroying what they had rebuilt, paralyzed her. If she told him the truth, he might not understand it, he might reject her. And the last thing she wanted was to lose him again.

-I can't tell you now, Lorenzo-she finally responded, lowering her gaze. The fear of his reaction took control of her voice. She felt small under his scrutiny, but she also knew she couldn't keep avoiding this conversation-. I promise I'll tell you someday, but not now.

Lorenzo furrowed his brow, feeling a mixture of frustration and concern. He stepped closer to her, trying to capture her full attention.

-Why?-he asked with a sigh, gently squeezing her hands-. Why not now? You know I trust you, Margaret. If something is tormenting you, I want to be by your side to support you, not to push you away.

Margaret closed her eyes for a moment, struggling to keep the tears at bay. The truth she had been avoiding for so long began to take hold of her, and the words she didn't want to say to Lorenzo flooded her mind. But she knew that, although he wanted to help her, what she had to tell him was something so big, so dark, that it could destroy what was left of them.

-What I have to tell you is... complicated-she said, her voice breaking. She turned to look at the city, seeking something to anchor her to reality-. It's not something I can tell you right away. If I told you now... it could damage what we have. It could change everything, Lorenzo.

Lorenzo watched her in silence, his face filled with a mix of pain and understanding. He wanted to insist, to push her to open up, but he knew he couldn't force her to share something she wasn't ready to. His heart beat strongly as he saw how vulnerable she looked, but he also felt a strange calm knowing that, at some point, she would open up to him.

-If you can't tell me now, I understand-he responded gently, though his voice trembled slightly-. But I want you to know something, Margaret. No matter what it is. If you ever decide to trust me with that secret, I will be here. I won't judge you, and I won't leave you alone.

Margaret looked at him, and for the first time in a long while, she saw the purity of his promise. She knew Lorenzo had changed, that now he was a man who not only desired her, but was also willing to stand by her no matter what. But still, the fear of what could happen if she revealed her secret kept her cautious.

-I appreciate it, Lorenzo-she finally said, her eyes shining with a mix of gratitude and sadness-. And someday, I will tell you. I just ask that you be patient. I need that, more than anything.

Lorenzo nodded slowly, not pressing her further, but the uncertainty still lingered between them. He wanted to believe her, to trust that everything would turn out fine, but he couldn't shake the doubt that planted itself in his heart. How big was that secret? And what impact would it have on their relationship when he finally found out?

Meanwhile, Margaret felt a weight on her shoulders, a burden she couldn't share with him, not yet. She looked at him for a moment, observing his determined face, and wished with all her heart that she could free herself from the anguish she felt. But for now, she could only keep the secret, hoping that someday time would make it easier to tell.

They continued walking, but the air between them was filled with unasked questions, an uncertain future, and the unspoken promise that, eventually, everything would be resolved.
###chapter 42: Beneath the Storm
Margaret and Lorenzo walked through the cobblestone streets of Paris, sharing small moments of conversation. The air was heavy, as if the storm that was approaching mirrored the emotions they were both trying to hide.

Suddenly, Margaret's phone began to vibrate. When she looked at the screen, she saw that it was Adrien.

-Adrien?-she answered, her tone reflecting her surprise.

-Margaret, I'm sorry to bother you, but I need you to come back soon. Something urgent came up, and I have to leave immediately-Adrien said in a serious tone.

-What happened? Is everything okay?

-Yes, don't worry. But I can't stay with Mateo much longer. Could you come back home?

Margaret sighed, thankful that Adrien was being honest, though his request was unexpected.

-Of course, I'll be there in a few minutes. Thanks for looking after him.

-Always, Margaret. See you soon.

When she hung up, Lorenzo had already noticed the change in her expression.

-Is something wrong?

-No, but I have to go back home. Adrien has to leave, and Mateo is with him.

-I'll come with you-Lorenzo said without hesitation.

Margaret looked at him for a moment, wanting to decline the offer, but the determination in his eyes made her not insist.

-Alright-she agreed.

The trip back home was quicker than they had expected, but just as they arrived, the sky darkened completely. Adrien was waiting at the entrance, with Mateo asleep in his arms.

-Thanks for coming so quickly-Adrien said, carefully handing the child over to Margaret.

-Are you sure everything's okay?-she asked.

Adrien nodded, but his gaze seemed to avoid Lorenzo's.

-Yes, don't worry. Something came up that I couldn't postpone. Thanks for understanding.

After a brief exchange, Adrien said a quick "see you" and disappeared into the night.

Margaret took Mateo to his room, gently tucking him into bed before returning to the living room. There, she found Lorenzo standing by the window, watching as the rain began to fall heavily.

-I don't think you'll be able to return to the hotel -Margaret commented, crossing her arms as she watched the lightning light up the sky.

-It doesn't look like this storm will let up anytime soon -Lorenzo replied, turning towards her with a slight smile-. Do you mind if I stay?

Margaret shook her head, although her heart was pounding.

-Of course not. Just give me a moment to prepare the couch.

-There's no need. I'm fine here with you -he said, his tone soft, making her stop in her tracks.

The electricity from the storm seemed to transfer into the air between them. Margaret looked at him, trying to decipher his intentions.

-Lorenzo, I don't know if this is a good idea...

-Margaret, don't worry about what I think or don't think. I'm here because I want to be, not for any other reason -he replied, taking a step toward her.

Margaret looked away, feeling how the barriers she had built began to wobble. But before she could respond, a loud thunderclap rang out, making her jump.

Lorenzo laughed softly, trying to ease the tension.

-Looks like tonight's going to be a long one.

The next morning, the storm had eased, but the clouds still covered the sky, as if Paris didn't want to let go of the intimate atmosphere that had been created the night before. Lorenzo woke up early, something unusual for him, but the presence of Mateo in the house gave him a curious sense of responsibility.

While Margaret prepared breakfast, Lorenzo decided to take the time to get closer to the little one. He found him in the living room, playing with a wooden train that seemed to have lost some pieces.

-Can I play with you? -Lorenzo asked, kneeling beside him.

Mateo looked at him cautiously at first, but then nodded, extending one of the train pieces to him.

-You have to fix it. The train can't keep going if you don't -he said seriously, as if truly entrusting him with an important mission.

Lorenzo smiled and pretended to concentrate hard as he tried to fit the pieces together.

-I think this one goes here... or maybe not. What do you think?

Mateo let out a small laugh and took the piece from his hands.

-No, it doesn't go like that. Look, this is how mom does it.

The comment made Lorenzo look up, seeing Margaret from a distance, watching them from the kitchen with a smile she was trying to hide.

-Your mom seems to know a lot of things -Lorenzo commented, looking at Mateo.

-Yeah, mom knows everything. But she doesn't always play with me because she works a lot.

Lorenzo felt a pang of empathy for the little one.

-Well, today you have someone else to play with, okay?

Mateo nodded enthusiastically, and for the next hour, Lorenzo immersed himself in the world of wooden trains, following the instructions from his little "master."

When Margaret entered the living room with a tray of juice and cookies, she stopped when she saw the scene. Lorenzo and Mateo were lying on the carpet, with train tracks scattered across almost the entire room. Mateo was talking non-stop, explaining to Lorenzo how the trains' "schedules" worked, and Lorenzo listened with a patience and attention he had never shown before.

-I see the living room turned into a train station -Margaret commented, trying to sound casual as she placed the tray on the table.

-Mom, look at what we made! -Mateo exclaimed, pointing to the complex structure they had built together.

-It's impressive, sweetheart. You've done a great job.

Lorenzo slowly stood up, wiping his hands on his pants.

-I think your son has a talent for engineering -he joked, looking at Margaret with a soft expression.

-And it looks like he found someone willing to keep up with him -she replied, unable to stop herself from smiling.

Later, while Mateo took a nap, Lorenzo and Margaret sat on the small terrace of the house, having coffee under the cloudy sky.

-He's a good kid -Lorenzo said, breaking the silence.

Margaret nodded, looking toward the living room where her son rested.

-Yes, he is. He's been through a lot for his young age, but he's strong.

-You can tell. And you can also tell he has an incredible mother.

Margaret blushed slightly, looking away.

-Thank you for spending time with him. I think he likes you.

Lorenzo smiled, leaning back in his chair.

-It's mutual. There's something about him that... I don't know, it just makes me feel at home.

Margaret looked at him, wanting to ask more, but decided against it. There was something in Lorenzo's tone that made her think that, perhaps, he too felt a deeper connection than he was willing to admit.
###chapter 43: A Day in the Park
The next afternoon, Mateo couldn't stop jumping excitedly around Margaret and Lorenzo. He had insisted all through breakfast on going to the amusement park, and his enthusiasm was so contagious that neither of them could say no.

-Come on, Mom! Come on, Lorenzo! I want to go on the Ferris wheel! -exclaimed Mateo while holding his little shoes, trying to put them on by himself.

Margaret, watching the scene with a mix of tenderness and amusement, leaned down to help him.

-First, let me make sure you have the right shoes on, champ.

Lorenzo, leaning against the door, watched them with a calm smile.

-It looks like there's no negotiating. It's going to be an adventure day.

-It seems that way -replied Margaret, giving him a warning look-. But remember, you'll have to get on the rides too. It's not just about watching.

Lorenzo raised an eyebrow, pretending to be concerned.

-Does it include things that spin too much?

-Definitely.

Mateo laughed, excited, and ran toward the door as soon as he was ready.

-Let's go, let's go! I want to get there!

The amusement park was alive: children's laughter, carousel music, and the tempting smell of cotton candy and popcorn. Mateo didn't know where to start, pointing at each attraction with the excitement of someone seeing the world for the first time.

-First, the Ferris wheel! -he shouted, pulling on Lorenzo's hand.

Margaret, walking beside them, watched curiously how Lorenzo adapted easily to Mateo's excitement.

-Shouldn't we start with something less... high? -asked Lorenzo, looking at the giant wheel with a hint of nervousness.

-Are you scared? -asked Mateo, amused.

-Me? Not at all -replied Lorenzo, pretending to be confident-. Let's go.

At the top of the Ferris wheel, the view was breathtaking. Mateo was between them, pointing excitedly at the city that stretched beyond the park.

-Look, it seems like we can touch the sky! -he exclaimed, laughing.

Margaret leaned toward her son, stroking his hair.

-Do you like being here, champ?

Mateo nodded, looking at Lorenzo.

-I like it a lot. And I like being with you too.

The statement was simple, but it had a profound impact on both adults. Lorenzo glanced at Margaret from the corner of his eye, with an expression that said more than he could put into words. She, for her part, looked away, fearful of what that connection was starting to mean.

After the Ferris wheel, they went on several rides: bumper cars, the kiddie train, and a roller coaster that clearly left Lorenzo dizzy, although he tried to hide it so as not to disappoint Mateo.

-I think bumper cars are more my style -said Lorenzo, leaning on a railing.

-Are you sure you don't want another ride on the roller coaster? -joked Margaret.

-Not in a million years -he replied, making both of them laugh.

Finally, they reached a cotton candy stand. Mateo, with a big piece in his hands, sat on a bench while Margaret and Lorenzo watched him closely.

-Thanks for this, Lorenzo -Margaret said quietly, without looking directly at him.

-You don't have to thank me. If I'm honest, I think I'm enjoying this more than I expected.

Margaret looked at him, noticing a sincerity in his words that disarmed her.

-Mateo really likes you. It's rare for him to connect like that with someone.

Lorenzo smiled, watching the little one laugh as cotton candy stuck to his cheeks.

-He's special. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel like... I don't know, I've known him forever.

Margaret looked away, fighting against the lump in her throat. She knew that connection wasn't a coincidence, but it still wasn't the time to reveal it.

-I just hope you don't disappoint him -she said quietly, more to herself than to Lorenzo.

He looked at her with a determination that made their eyes meet.

-I promise I won't. Not either of you.

Margaret wanted to respond, but Mateo interrupted, running toward them with sticky hands from the cotton candy.

-Let's go to the carousel! It's the last one, I promise!

They both laughed, letting the child lead them back into the world of laughter and lights of the park.

The afternoon at the park had been a total success. Mateo couldn't stop laughing and talking excitedly about all the attractions as they walked toward the exit. Lorenzo was holding the little one in his arms, since he had insisted he was too tired to walk. Margaret followed closely behind, enjoying the moment, although something inside her kept her on alert.

When they reached a nearby bench to rest before heading back, Mateo leaned his head on Lorenzo's shoulder, looking at him with dreamy eyes.

-Lorenzo -the child said, with that curious and direct tone that only children can have-. Do you want to be my dad?

Time seemed to stop. Margaret, who was sipping from a water bottle, nearly choked. She coughed lightly, dropping the bottle in the process.

-Mateo... -Margaret tried to intervene, her cheeks turning red and clearly nervous-. Don't say things like that...

But Lorenzo stopped her with a gesture of his hand, keeping his gaze on the little one.

-Why are you asking me that, champ?

Mateo shrugged, playing with the buttons on Lorenzo's shirt.

-Because you're nice to me. You make me laugh and take me to fun places. And... I don't have a dad. But if you want, you could be one.

Margaret felt like the ground was crumbling beneath her feet. She looked at Lorenzo, trying to interpret his reaction, but his face was calm, though his eyes sparkled with a mix of surprise and tenderness.

-That's a very important question, Mateo -Lorenzo replied, hugging him tighter-. Being a dad isn't just taking you to the park or making you laugh. It's taking care of you, protecting you, and being there for you always, even when things aren't easy.

Mateo lifted his head and looked at him seriously.

-Do you want to take care of me?

-Of course I do -Lorenzo said without hesitation. Then, he looked at Margaret, whose expression was a mix of nervousness and something that Lorenzo couldn't quite identify-. But I think that's something I should talk to your mom about too.

Margaret stood up abruptly, crossing her arms to hide her nervousness.

-Mateo, honey, Lorenzo is a friend. You shouldn't put him in that position.

-But mom -the boy insisted with a pout-, he would be a good dad.

-Mateo, enough -Margaret responded gently but firmly. Then, she looked at Lorenzo-. I'm sorry, I don't know why he said that.

Lorenzo stood up, still holding Mateo, and smiled at her.

-Don't worry. Kids just say what they feel.

The response made Margaret tense up even more. She didn't know if Lorenzo was joking or if he had actually taken Mateo's question seriously.

As they walked toward the park exit, Margaret was silent, lost in her thoughts. Lorenzo, on the other hand, kept entertaining Mateo, as if the conversation from a few moments ago hadn't shaken him as much as it had her.

However, when they reached the car, Lorenzo took the opportunity to approach Margaret while Mateo got distracted by a nearby ice cream cart.

-You don't have to get nervous about what Mateo said -Lorenzo said quietly, with a calm smile-. But I want you to know something: what I feel for him is genuine. I'm not playing, Margaret.

She looked at him, feeling her heart race.

-Lorenzo, you don't know everything about me. If you did you might not be so willing to say those things.

Lorenzo shook his head, moving a little closer.

-What if I told you that nothing you say will change how I feel?

Margaret looked away, not knowing how to respond. Lorenzo's words were both a comfort and a threat at the same time.

Meanwhile, Mateo ran back toward them, interrupting the tense moment.

-Look, mom! Lorenzo! I want an ice cream before we leave!

Margaret took a deep breath, regaining her composure, and smiled.

-Let's go, champ. You and your cravings

As they walked toward the ice cream cart, Lorenzo didn't take his eyes off Margaret. He knew there was something more, something she was hiding, but he also knew he had to be patient. Mateo had already asked his question, and Lorenzo was more determined than ever to be a part of their lives, no matter how long it took.
###chapter 44: I Want You Close
That night, as Margaret put Mateo to bed after a day full of emotions, she felt exhausted, but not just physically. Her son's words and the way Lorenzo had taken them kept swirling in her mind. How could she continue keeping her secrets when Lorenzo was so close, not only to her but also to Mateo?

After making sure Mateo was sound asleep, Margaret stepped out onto the balcony of her apartment. The city of Paris sparkled under the moonlight, but this time, the view offered no comfort. Her mind was tangled in a whirlwind of unanswered questions.

-Why does everything have to be so complicated? -she whispered, hugging herself as a cold breeze made her skin shiver.

A few gentle knocks on the door pulled her from her thoughts. When she opened, she found Lorenzo holding a small bag in one hand and wearing a calm expression.

-I didn't want to leave without talking to you -he said, entering the apartment after Margaret gestured for him to come in-. I thought we could share this. -He pulled out a bottle of wine and two glasses from the bag.

Margaret sighed, though a part of her couldn't deny that she was glad to see him.

-Lorenzo, I don't know if this is a good idea

-Why not? -he replied, placing the bottle on the table and looking at her intensely-. I'm not going to pressure you to tell me anything, Margaret. I just want to be here.

She bit her lip, unsure, but finally nodded and went to get a corkscrew. While she opened the bottle, Lorenzo watched her in silence. Margaret was a strong woman, he knew that, but he also saw the vulnerability she tried to hide.

They both sat on the sofa with their glasses. At first, the conversation was light: they talked about Mateo, the park, little anecdotes from the week. But Lorenzo knew there was something more, something Margaret needed to let out.

-Margaret -he finally said, breaking the silence-, I'm not going to deny that what Mateo said today made me think a lot.

She lowered her gaze, toying with the glass in her hands.

-He's a child, Lorenzo. He doesn't understand the magnitude of what he's saying.

-Maybe he doesn't fully understand, but that doesn't change what he feels -he replied, leaning a little toward her-. And I can't ignore it either.

Margaret placed the glass on the table and stood up, walking toward the window.

-This is complicated. Mateo is my priority, Lorenzo. And you you don't know everything about me.

-Then tell me. Let me understand you -Lorenzo insisted, standing up as well-. Margaret, you don't have to carry all this alone.

She turned toward him, her eyes shining with a mixture of determination and fear.

-What if what I tell you changes everything? What if you decide you don't want to be close after knowing it?

Lorenzo took a step toward her, his gaze firm.

-Nothing you say will change what I feel.

Margaret looked at him, fighting against the wave of emotions that threatened to overwhelm her.

-Lorenzo you can't promise that.

He raised a hand, gently brushing her cheek.

-The only thing I can promise is that I'm here, Margaret. For you and for Mateo.

For a moment, time seemed to stop. Margaret felt the warmth of his hand, the weight of his words, and she knew she was closer than ever to crossing a line that could change everything.

Hours later, Lorenzo stood up from the sofa, leaving the empty glass on the table. The air in the room was charged with something undefined, a mix of uncertainty and hope. He glanced at Margaret one last time before heading toward the door.

-I'm going back to the hotel. -He said with a light smile, but his eyes couldn't hide the sadness he felt at having to leave.

Margaret nodded silently, her gaze fixed on the floor, as if she couldn't find the right words. She didn't want Lorenzo to go, but she felt there were still many things between them that weren't ready to be resolved. And the fear of what might happen if she opened up to him still weighed heavily on her chest.

Lorenzo approached the door and paused for a moment, not turning toward her.

-Margaret, I know you're scared. And I understand that it's not easy. But I want you to know that when you're ready, I'll be here. No pressure.

She lifted her gaze, searching for his eyes, but couldn't hold it for long. The desire to tell him everything, to open her heart, flooded her, but the words got stuck in her throat.

-Thank you -was all she could say, her voice broken, almost inaudible.

Lorenzo nodded, feeling the difficulty of the moment, but knowing he couldn't force anything. After a long sigh, he turned and opened the door. Before leaving, he paused for a moment, and with one last glance at Margaret, he said softly:

-It doesn't matter what you decide, Margaret. I'm not going anywhere.

And with those words, he closed the door behind him, leaving her alone in the stillness of the night.

Margaret stayed there, still for a moment, processing Lorenzo's words. Each one of them cut through her like a cold current, but also warm, deep inside her. Would she ever be able to trust him completely? Let go of her fear and share everything she had guarded so closely?

Meanwhile, Lorenzo walked down the street, the sound of his steps echoing in the stillness of the night. He knew he had to leave, but a part of him didn't want to let her go, didn't want to leave Paris without resolving everything he felt.

The hotel was just a few blocks away, but his thoughts overflowed. The desire to get closer to Margaret, to show her he was willing to do whatever it took to gain her trust, was stronger than ever. But he also knew he couldn't rush it. He couldn't force her to open up if she wasn't ready.

When he arrived at the hotel, he took the elevator up and entered his room without saying a word. The silence weighed on him, and as he collapsed onto the bed, he couldn't help but think about what would come next. Would he keep fighting for her? Could what he had to offer be enough?

For now, he could only wait, hoping that, at some point, Margaret would be ready to trust him with her story.
###chapter 45: An Unexpected Wish
Morning arrived quickly, and with it, a light breeze that slipped through the cracks of the open window. Margaret was in the kitchen, preparing breakfast, when she heard a soft noise, a faint cry coming from Mateo's room. Her heart tightened immediately, and putting the coffee cup aside, she ran toward her son's room.

Upon entering, she saw Mateo sitting on his bed, his little eyes wide and filled with tears. He clung tightly to his pillow, his breath erratic, as if he had had a nightmare. The emptiness in his face made her stop in her tracks.

-Mateo? -Margaret said gently, approaching cautiously.

He looked at her, his eyes filled with confusion and fear, and quickly hugged her, burying his face in her chest.

-Mom where is he? -he asked, his voice trembling, referring to Lorenzo. Margaret tensed at the mention of his name. She didn't know how to answer that question, how to explain the situation without worrying him too much.

-Mateo, darling, who are you talking about? -she asked while hugging him, stroking his hair.

-Lorenzo -his voice was barely a whisper, but the anguish was clear in his eyes. -I want to see him, mom. I want him here.

Margaret felt a lump in her throat. She hadn't expected her son to be so affected by Lorenzo's absence. Since he had left the night before, Mateo hadn't said anything, but now, upon waking up, the emptiness in his heart had reached him.

-Lorenzo has things to do, Mateo, but don't worry, he'll be back soon -Margaret said, her voice soft but firm, trying to calm him down.

Mateo looked up and stared at her as if he didn't completely understand what she was saying. His tear-filled eyes didn't show anger, but deep sadness, as if something important was missing.

-When is he coming back? -he asked, his voice barely audible.

Margaret felt a pang of guilt upon hearing her son's concern. How could she explain all of this, when she herself was still unsure about what she felt for Lorenzo?

-I don't know, sweetheart. But I promise you that when he comes back, everything will be fine -she replied, forcing a smile.

However, Mateo didn't seem convinced. He pulled away a little, and with his head down, murmured:

-I want Lorenzo to be my dad.

Margaret's heart stopped for a moment, shocked by Mateo's words. She wasn't prepared for that revelation, and the weight of his words hit her harder than she had anticipated.

-Mateo -she said, trying to stay calm. -You know we can't choose the people we want in our lives that way.

But Mateo wasn't listening to her. He was completely absorbed in his thoughts, as if he knew exactly what he wanted.

-I want him, mom. Lorenzo takes care of me, he plays with me. He makes me feel happy. -His eyes shone with sincerity, and Margaret felt a wave of emotion wash over her. Mateo had found in Lorenzo the paternal figure he wished to have.

Margaret stayed silent for a moment, her heart heavy. How could she explain to her son everything that had happened between her and Lorenzo? How could she tell him that, although Lorenzo cared for him, things weren't that simple?

She knelt beside him and took his hands, looking him straight in the eyes.

-I know you like Lorenzo, Mateo. And I'm glad you've met him because he's a good person. But we can't always have what we want right away, do you understand? Things take time.

Mateo, with sadness on his face, nodded slowly, but didn't say anything else. Margaret hugged him again, feeling a piece of her own heart crumble with those words. She knew that, somehow, she wouldn't be able to stop worrying about Mateo's feelings. The relationship he had started to build with Lorenzo had been something so unexpected and, at the same time, so genuine, that now Margaret didn't know how to handle it.

Later that day, Margaret decided to take Mateo to the park to distract him a little. As they walked, she couldn't stop thinking about her son's words. Was she being fair to him by not letting him get closer to Lorenzo? Was she doing him a favor by preventing him from getting more attached?

When they arrived at the park, Mateo ran towards the swing, while Margaret stood still, looking around, lost in her thoughts. The sound of the wind in the leaves, the murmur of children playing, everything seemed so distant at that moment.

But something inside her knew that she had to face her own feelings, for Mateo and for herself. What did all of this mean? Could Lorenzo be part of her life and her son's? Or would her own fear of getting involved with him again end up destroying what Mateo needed the most?

Margaret closed her eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. The path ahead felt uncertain, but one thing was clear: her son deserved to be happy, and she couldn't let fear prevent her from giving him the stability he so desperately needed.

The future was uncertain, but maybe, just maybe, there was still space for love and hope.
###chapter 46: The Decision of a Restless Heart
The wind blew softly as Mateo happily swung back and forth, his laughter echoing in the air. Margaret watched him from a distance, but her mind remained trapped in her son's words. Could it really be that simple? Could Lorenzo become what Mateo so desperately wanted?

Despite her internal struggle, Margaret knew she couldn't let her own fears ruin what Mateo felt. However, the question tormenting her wasn't just about Mateo. Deep down, there was the constant doubt about Lorenzo: was he truly willing to be a father figure to her son? And, most importantly, how did she fit into all of that?

Lorenzo had changed, yes. She knew it, she could feel it, but the past always seemed to come back, and Margaret couldn't forget the emotional storm caused by their separation. She didn't want to take that risk again. She couldn't.

She approached Mateo, who had already left the swing and was running toward a group of children. She smiled warmly as she watched him, but her smile quickly faded as a shadow of worry surrounded her. How was she going to handle all of this?

At that moment, her phone vibrated in her purse. She took it out, hoping it would be something to distract her for a moment. But upon seeing the name on the screen, a mix of surprise and anxiety took over her. It was Lorenzo.

-Hello, Lorenzo -Margaret said, her voice a bit shaky.

-How's everything? -he replied, his tone warm and familiar, as if nothing had changed between them.

-Good... everything's good. Mateo is enjoying the park -Margaret replied as she watched her son laugh and run with the other children. She couldn't help but feel a small lump in her throat. How had it come to this? How had she come to doubt her feelings for Lorenzo so much?

-I'm glad to hear that. -Lorenzo's voice softened. -Do you have some free time? I need to talk to you about something important.

Margaret frowned. What could it be about? Worry grew inside her, but she decided not to jump to conclusions.

-Sure, I can stop by your house in a little while -she replied without thinking too much. Something inside her told her she couldn't avoid this conversation.

-Perfect. I'll see you soon, then.

The call ended, and Margaret stood still for a few seconds, watching Mateo play. She knew she had to talk to Lorenzo, but she couldn't shake the uncertainty that engulfed her. What could he possibly want to tell her? Was he also starting to have doubts about what was happening between them?

The day passed quickly, and soon after, she found herself at the door of her apartment, a mix of emotions running through her. The sound of her phone vibrating again startled her. It was a message from Adrien.

Adrien: Is everything okay?

Margaret couldn't help but smile at her friend's message, although she knew it wasn't the right time to talk to him about what was going on.

Margaret: I'm fine. I just need to clear some things up.

She put her phone away and, taking a deep breath, rang the doorbell. When the door opened, Lorenzo greeted her with a look that reflected calm, but there was something else on his face that Margaret couldn't decipher right away.

-Hello -she said, trying to sound natural.

-Hello, Margaret -Lorenzo replied, inviting her in. -Would you like something to drink?

-No, thank you. I just want to talk -Margaret responded as she sat down on the couch, searching for the right words.

Lorenzo sat across from her, watching her closely, as if waiting for her to start the conversation.

-I've been thinking a lot about all this -Margaret said, finally finding the courage to speak. -About what Mateo said this morning.

Lorenzo frowned, concerned.

-I know. -His tone was soft, almost shy. -I know, Margaret. I know what Mateo wants, and I want to be honest with you. I never imagined this would be easy. But I want you to know that what Mateo feels isn't something to be taken lightly.

Margaret looked at him intently, seeing the sincerity in his eyes. But still, she couldn't help but feel afraid of what she was about to say.

-I don't know if this can work, Lorenzo -Margaret said, her voice trembling. -I don't know if I'm ready to let Mateo get more attached to you. I don't want him to go through that if, later on... if later there's no chance.

Lorenzo leaned toward her, and with a softness that surprised her, took her hands in his.

-I understand, Margaret -he said, his voice calm and full of understanding. -What you're saying isn't easy, and I respect that. But I promise you I won't give up. Mateo is important to me, and what I want most is to see him happy. But I also know that the most important thing here is you. I want you to give me the chance to show you that what I want is what will be good for both you and Mateo.

Margaret fell silent, listening to his words, but her mind was still in chaos. She didn't know if she should take the risk of believing him, if she should trust that this time Lorenzo was being sincere, or if he was just looking for something that they could never have.

The only thing she knew for sure was that, at that moment, her heart was as divided as it had ever been.
###chapter 47: The Unexpected Farewell
The clock marked the afternoon when Margaret arrived at her apartment, her face tired from the intensity of the past few days. Each step she took felt heavier than the last, and her mind was in a constant battle. Lorenzo, Mateo, Adrien All the threads of her life were beginning to intertwine in unexpected ways.

When she entered, the sound of the phone broke the silence of her apartment. It was Adrien. She stared at it for a moment before answering, wondering if her friend had something to tell her about the situation with Lorenzo. With a sigh, she accepted the call.

-Adrien? -said Margaret, trying to sound calm, but knowing there must be something urgent for him to call.

-Margaret, I need you to listen to me -Adrien said immediately, his voice serious, which made her tense up instantly. The usual calmness in his voice was gone, and that could only mean one thing: something was wrong.

-What's happening? -Margaret asked, feeling a mix of anxiety and confusion.

-I have to leave the country. -Adrien's words were direct but filled with an emotional weight that Margaret couldn't ignore. -Something important has come up, and I can't stay here.

Margaret's chest tightened upon hearing the news. Adrien, her close friend, her unconditional support Why did he have to leave so suddenly? Something in his voice unsettled her, and immediately doubt and fear began to fill her mind.

-What happened? Why so suddenly? -Margaret asked, trying not to sound too worried, although she was.

-I can't explain everything, not now -Adrien replied, his tone still serious and tense. -There are circumstances beyond my control, and I need to act fast. But believe me, it's not something I can postpone.

Margaret felt the air escape from her lungs as she heard the urgency in his words. The fact that he couldn't tell her all the details only increased the anxiety she felt.

-When are you leaving? -she asked, almost without thinking, feeling a knot form in her stomach.

-Tomorrow -Adrien answered without hesitation. -I know, it's fast, but it's the only option I have right now.

Margaret stayed silent for a moment, processing what she had just heard. Everything had changed so suddenly, and what worried her most was the feeling that something wasn't right. Adrien had never been like this, always so sure and confident. The uncertainty in his voice was disarming.

-Adrien, please, tell me what's going on. I'm worried that you're hiding something from me -she said, almost pleading. -You're my friend, and if you need help, you know you can count on me.

There was a long silence on the other end of the line, as if Adrien was carefully considering his words.

-It's complicated, Margaret. I promise I'll tell you everything eventually. But right now all I can say is that it's something I can't avoid. I'm really sorry, but I have to do it. -His voice sounded grave, as if he were saying it with a heavy heart.

The fear in Margaret's chest grew, and something inside her told her that there was more to this farewell than Adrien was willing to admit. But, for now, she couldn't press him further. If Adrien didn't want to talk, there was nothing she could do.

-Are you going to leave me here alone? -she asked with a mix of sadness and frustration. -You've always been my support, Adrien. I don't want to lose you now.

-It's not a final goodbye, Margaret -Adrien replied, his tone softer. -I promise I'll come back when I can. But for now, I have to do this. Just be patient with me, okay?

Margaret closed her eyes, trying to find the strength to understand the situation. She didn't like what she was hearing, but if there was one thing she had learned from Adrien, it was that, even if his decisions seemed impulsive, they always had a reason behind them.

-Alright I'll wait for you, Adrien. But promise me I won't lose you forever.

-I promise -he replied, and there was something in his voice that reassured her, but at the same time, made her even more uneasy.

The call ended, and Margaret stayed silent, staring at the phone in her hands. The feeling of unease wouldn't leave her, and she wondered if everything was somehow connected. Adrien had secrets, and she felt that important details were slipping through her fingers, things she couldn't understand yet.

With a heavy heart, Margaret placed the phone on the table and looked out the window. The sky was darkening, and the city lights shone like little points of hope. But inside, everything seemed to cloud over. What was happening? Why was everything falling apart so suddenly?

She didn't want to lose Adrien, but the weight of uncertainty crushed her. And what if this change of plans was just the beginning of something much bigger surrounding her?

Doubt and fear mixed in her chest, and for a moment, all she wanted was to be able to control the situation, as if she could fix it just by wishing for it. But she couldn't. The chaos in her mind told her to take control, to resolve everything right away, but she knew it wasn't in her hands. She couldn't force people to tell the truth, nor could she make secrets reveal themselves when she wanted. There was only a feeling of helplessness, that everything around her was spinning out of control and she couldn't stop it. The idea of waiting, of staying in this emotional limbo, filled her with despair. The anxiety was consuming her from within, like a flame feeding off her own fears.

She found herself trapped between the desire for answers and the inability to get them. What was happening? Why did everything seem to be falling apart so quickly? Her heart was racing, and her mind, in its attempt to find some sort of logic, went over every detail, trying to find a clue that would guide her to the truth. But everything was confusing, uncertain. Nothing made sense.

She looked out the window, as if the sky could give her some kind of answer, but the darkness only increased the feeling of emptiness. The city shone, but she couldn't see beyond the fog that clouded her thoughts. She was alone, truly alone, in the middle of a sea of questions without answers. And the worst part was that, even though everyone around her seemed to keep moving forward, she felt trapped in a moment she couldn't control.

All she wanted was to find the key, that missing piece of the puzzle. She wanted to understand Adrien's decisions, to know why he had suddenly made the choice to leave without giving her full explanations. She wanted to understand Lorenzo, to know if her relationship with him truly had a future or if everything was about to fall apart. She wanted to understand herself, to know what she wanted from all of this. But the answers weren't coming.

The future was uncertain, and Margaret could only wait for the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place on their own. She knew she couldn't force it. But she also knew that, for now, time had become her greatest enemy. With each passing second, the uncertainty grew bigger, heavier. The fear of the unknown, of what could come, invaded and paralyzed her.

She sat down on the couch, hugging herself, trying to find comfort in such a simple gesture. But the truth was, she couldn't find comfort in anything. The questions kept buzzing in her mind, and she didn't know how to quiet them. What would happen if she couldn't handle all of this? If the decisions she made in the next few days changed her life forever?

The future was still an enigma, and inside her, the feeling of facing something she couldn't control, something she couldn't avoid, filled her with anxiety. But at the same time, something in her heart told her she had to be patient, that time would eventually reveal what she needed to know. If only she could trust that the pieces of the puzzle would fit in the end.

But, for now, all she could do was wait. And waiting, although she wished with all her might, didn't mean having control over what would come next.
###chapter 48: Scorched Earth
The dawn had yet to break when Anthony made his decision. The mansion, which had been his refuge and fortress for years, was no longer safe. If they had managed to infiltrate it once, they could do it again. It was time to move.

"Vincent, make sure everything is ready," Anthony ordered, adjusting his watch as he strode down the hallway. "I want everyone out in thirty minutes."

Vincent nodded briskly, quickly barking orders to the men. One group armed armored vehicles while another dismantled equipment and gathered important documents. Everything needed to proceed with precision-there was no room for error.

Anthony headed to Gabriela's cell, where two guards stood watch. They found her sitting against the wall, eyes closed, her face so serene it seemed she was asleep. When she heard the door open, she slowly lifted her gaze.

"Come to say goodbye, Anthony?" she murmured with sarcasm. "How thoughtful."

Anthony ignored the provocation. He stepped forward and signaled to the guards.

"Take her to the transport vehicle. Keep her separate from Valdiri. I don't want them exchanging a single word."

Gabriela let out a small chuckle as the men lifted her and shackled her hands and feet.

"Afraid of what we might plan?" she whispered in his ear as she passed by. "Smart of you. But I warn you, Anthony, you haven't seen the worst yet."

He ignored her, keeping his gaze steady and cold, though every word felt like a thorn piercing his patience.

"Move her now," he ordered.

Gabriela was escorted out of the cell, followed by another team who retrieved Valdiri from the underground holding area. Both prisoners were taken along separate routes, guarded by heavily armed men. No risks could be taken.

"What about the mansion?" Vincent asked as he caught up with Anthony outside near the vehicles.

Anthony paused, glancing back at the imposing structure that had been his stronghold. He took a deep breath, tension radiating through every fiber of his being.

"Destroy it," he finally said. "I don't want a single stone left standing."

Vincent looked at him, surprised, but then nodded, understanding the weight of Anthony's decision.

"Place explosives throughout the perimeter. Once the last vehicle is out, I want this mansion reduced to ashes," Anthony added firmly.

The men moved quickly, placing demolition charges in strategic locations. The air buzzed with hurried footsteps, sharp commands, and the rumble of engines.

Sophia, her hand resting on her now more visible belly, watched the scene from one of the vehicles. Anthony approached her, opening the door to climb in.

"Are you all right?" he asked, his voice softer this time.

Sophia nodded, though her expression revealed her concern.

"Where are we going now?"

"Somewhere safe," Anthony replied, taking her hand. "Everything is under control."

"And Gabriela?" she asked, glancing at the vehicle where Gabriela, her head lowered, was being escorted by four guards.

"Don't worry about her. She won't harm us again."

The convoy began to move. Seven armored vehicles lined up, escorted by security motorcycles. The headlights barely pierced the darkness as they departed the mansion.

A few kilometers away, Anthony ordered a stop. He stepped out of the vehicle and, alongside Vincent, watched the mansion from a nearby hill.

"Is everything ready?" Vincent asked, holding the detonator in his hand.

"Yes," Anthony replied, his gaze unwavering.

Vincent pressed the detonator. For a second, all was silent. Then, a series of deafening explosions shook the ground. The mansion erupted from its foundations, and massive flames began consuming every corner. The sky glowed orange as thick black smoke spiraled upward.

Anthony watched impassively, as if the fire weren't just consuming a building but a part of his own history. Sophia observed him from inside the vehicle, sensing the heavy burden of what had just happened.

"We'll make sure they never find us again," Anthony murmured, more to himself than to Vincent.

"They have nowhere left to return to," Vincent added, pocketing the detonator.

Anthony nodded and climbed back into the vehicle.

"Check the routes and ensure we're not being followed. From now on, every move counts."

As the convoy resumed its journey, Gabriela, seated in the last vehicle, smiled faintly at the sound of explosions in the distance. Despite her restraints, the glint in her eyes revealed that, in her mind, this wasn't a defeat.

"What's so funny?" one of the guards growled.

Gabriela glanced at him out of the corner of her eye, her lips barely moving.

"I'm just thinking... this is only the beginning."

The guard frowned but didn't reply, while Gabriela leaned back in her seat, whispering words just loud enough for herself to hear.

"Enjoy your moment of victory, Anthony... because mine will be the last."

The convoy disappeared into the shadows of the road, leaving behind what had once been a fortress. The true battle was yet to come.
Capítulo 48: The Unexpected Departure
Adrien arrived in Argentina with a feeling of uncertainty that he couldn't shake off. The mix of sensations was overwhelming: the obligation to be there, the weight of what he had left behind, and the worry about what might be happening in Paris. The flight had been long, and although fatigue consumed him, he couldn't stop thinking about the conversation he had had with Margaret before his departure.

The call he had received had shown him the magnitude of the situation. He couldn't stay inactive; he couldn't ignore what was happening, nor the repercussions his decisions would have on those he loved most. He knew that, even though he was in Argentina for reasons he couldn't explain, what worried him most at that moment was Margaret.

As he left the airport, the warm, humid air of Buenos Aires enveloped him, but it didn't make him feel any more comfortable. He walked quickly, as if trying to escape his own thoughts. In the taxi to the hotel, the sound of the traffic, the murmurs of the city, seemed unreal, disconnected from the emotional storm he carried inside. Everything seemed unreal, but his sense of urgency was very real.

He was in Argentina to handle what was in front of him, facing challenges and decisions that he couldn't postpone. However, despite his determination, he couldn't help but feel that he had left many things unresolved. An inexplicable weight accompanied him, a feeling that he had left behind more than he was willing to admit. He knew that life wasn't always about clear answers, but at that moment, silence and distance seemed to be the only way to deal with what was coming, even though they hurt deeply.

In his hotel room, Adrien paced back and forth, as if the simple movement could ease the anxiety that pressed on him. His mind wouldn't stop turning with the same questions, the secrets he still wasn't brave enough to face. The unsaid words, the gestures that had remained halfway, consumed him, filling the air in the room with a sense of emptiness. Every step he took seemed to bring him no closer to any answers, and at the same time, it pushed him further from the certainties he so desperately longed to find.

He approached the window, searching in the city lights for a breath of air for his restless mind. The lights flickered in the distance, like small sparks in the midst of the night's darkness, and for a moment, Adrien allowed himself to get lost in them. The city vibrated with an energy he couldn't reach, but one that felt close, like a promise that everything could eventually be resolved. Or maybe not. Perhaps the decisions he had made had placed him at a point of no return, where the consequences couldn't be predicted.

He thought about everything he had left behind, about everything he had done to get there. The uncertainty of having taken a path with no turning back made him feel even more alone. He leaned against the cold glass of the window, feeling how the night enveloped him. Was it possible to make up for what he had done? Could he ever come to terms with the past and look forward without the weight of the wrong decisions? The questions, like invisible ghosts, followed him relentlessly.

Adrien closed his eyes for a moment, trying to find some kind of peace amid the chaos that had erupted within him. In his mind, the answers seemed to escape every time he tried to capture them. But one thing was clear: no matter how much he wanted to change what had happened, he couldn't. The only thing left was to accept that, at that moment, he was completely alone, with the only company of his thoughts and his doubts.

The urgency of the situation in Argentina wasn't something he could postpone. There was something he had to resolve there, something he couldn't ignore. But that same urgency prevented him from giving Margaret the answers she so desperately needed, and that tormented him.

The only thing he knew for sure was that he couldn't keep running from the truth. Every day that passed, every minute that took him farther from her, he felt something inside him breaking a little more.

He hadn't called Margaret. He didn't know if it was the right thing to do. But what he did know was that he couldn't stay much longer without explaining what was happening, even though at that moment he still didn't have the exact words. What weighed on him the most was not being able to be with her, not being able to share with her what was happening, not being able to tell her that, despite everything, his affection remained intact.

A knock on the door pulled him from his thoughts. Adrien took a deep breath, straightened up, and for a moment, wished it was something more than the noise from the outside world. But he couldn't ignore that, at that very moment, his life was taken by circumstances, and Margaret was no longer the only concern he carried on his shoulders.
###chapter 49: Ana's Return
When he opened the door, the sight of the woman standing before him left him paralyzed. Ana, his first love-the woman who had vanished from his life six long years ago-was there, right in front of him. Although he had been expecting her, her presence still caught him off guard. For a moment, Adrien thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.

-Ana... -Adrien whispered, barely able to believe what he was seeing.

She looked at him with an expression that carried both sorrow and pain. Time had not spared her, but there was something in her face that spoke of the heavy burden she had been carrying in her chest all these years.

-Adrien... -Ana said, her voice trembling-. I need to talk to you.

The pain in her eyes made Adrien's heart race. Everything he had kept bottled up inside during these years-all the memories and unanswered questions-seemed to flood his mind at once.

-Why...? Why did you disappear without saying anything? -Adrien asked, his voice filled with a mixture of anger and confusion. The wounds of the past were still raw, and he couldn't stop himself from remembering the pain her sudden departure had caused.

Ana swallowed hard, her eyes shimmering with restrained emotion. She took a deep breath and began to speak slowly, as if every word was a heavy weight she struggled to carry.

-It wasn't my choice -she said, lowering her gaze before looking back at him. Her voice was soft, filled with regret-. Your mother... she forced me to leave. She pressured me to have an abortion, Adrien. She told me we could never be together, that I wasn't ready to be a mother. She made me leave you, leave everything.

Adrien blinked, stunned. Ana's words hit him like a thunderbolt. His mind raced with memories that now seemed to take on a completely different meaning.

-My mother... forced you to leave? -he said, more to himself than to her. He had never known the truth behind her departure, but now everything seemed to fit into place.

Ana nodded, her expression heavy with sadness.

-Yes. The pressure was so overwhelming, I couldn't resist. I had to walk away from everything, even you. I didn't want to, but I was afraid-for my life and for... -She paused before continuing-. And I left the city, changed my name, started over... all to escape what your mother demanded.

Anger began to mix with confusion inside Adrien. He remembered his mother as a controlling woman, but he couldn't believe she had interfered so deeply in his life-and Ana's. Yet, that wasn't the only thing keeping him in shock.

-And now what? -he asked, his voice laced with frustration and a desperate need for answers. Why are you back now, after all this time? Why now, after everything that's happened?

Ana met his eyes, and the seriousness in her expression made Adrien feel that something far bigger than the past was at stake. She stepped closer to him, her hands trembling slightly, but her voice steady.

-Because we have a daughter, Adrien. -Her confession dropped like a bomb-. And she needs a bone marrow transplant. You're her only compatible donor.

The weight of her words left him breathless. A child. His child. He had never imagined life could throw such a dramatic twist at him, especially after so many years.

-A child? -he whispered, his voice barely audible. Why didn't you ever tell me? Why did you keep all of this from me?

Ana lowered her gaze, her face reflecting deep pain. Telling him this wasn't easy, but she knew it was something she had to do.

-I didn't know how to tell you, Adrien. -Her voice trembled. -It was a decision I made alone, one I wasn't ready to face. But he's here now, and he's the most important thing. He needs you.

Confusion and pain took hold of Adrien. His mind couldn't process what he had just heard, and his heart wavered between lost love, anger at the betrayal, and fear of what this newly discovered child meant.

-Why didn't you tell me before, Ana? -he asked, his voice breaking with anguish. -Why did you let me live with this lie?

-I thought it was best to keep you away from all of it Your mother didn't want this child -she answered, tears streaming down her face. -I was afraid I'd lose your love, that you wouldn't forgive me. But now, he's in danger. He needs you more than ever.

Adrien closed his eyes for a moment, taking a deep breath. The weight of the revelation was overwhelming, and while his heart still burned with unanswered questions, all he could think about was that he had to do the right thing for the child he had just learned was his.

Ana watched him, as if waiting for something more, something that could ease her own pain. Adrien couldn't shake the feeling that there was something else she wasn't telling him.

-Is there more I should know? -he asked, his voice tired but firm. He knew her words couldn't be the full story. He needed to be prepared for whatever was coming.

Ana averted her gaze, searching for the right words. Finally, with a trembling voice, she began to speak.

-Adrien, it wasn't just your mother who pressured me. It was the situation, the circumstances everything was chaos. I didn't know how to tell you I was pregnant. I didn't want to affect your career, didn't want your life to change overnight. The easiest thing was to walk away, to disappear but the child he deserves to know who his father is.

Adrien felt a knot form in his stomach as he heard the guilt in Ana's voice. The weight of their decisions crushed him, and in that moment, he wished things could have been different. Why hadn't she told him earlier? Why had she disappeared so suddenly? His anger mingled with compassion, and while his heart still burned from the wounds of the past, something inside him urged him to move forward.

-So all this time...? -he began, but the anguish in his voice stopped him.

Ana nodded, unable to meet his gaze.

-Yes. All this time, it's been for him. -She sighed deeply, as if releasing a burden she had carried for years. -I know it wasn't right. I failed you but I didn't want you to live with the memory of a mistake I made. I didn't want to drag you into my pain.

Adrien felt the weight of her words, but something within him kept him grounded. The child he hadn't known about deserved a chance. The child who was now an irremovable part of his life needed to know his father was willing to fight for him.

-You won't carry this alone anymore, Ana. -Adrien said, meeting her gaze. -I'll help you. I'll do everything I can. No matter what happened, this child is my responsibility too.

Ana, surprised by his words, let out a faint smile of gratitude.

-Thank you, Adrien. -she said, her eyes filling with tears. -I don't know how to thank you.

Adrien looked at her for a moment, his thoughts now focused on what mattered. He couldn't change the past, couldn't erase the decisions that had been made, but he could be the man this child needed now.

-We'll do this together, Ana. -Adrien said, his voice filled with determination. -And no matter what happens, I won't let him feel alone.

Their conversation hung in the air as silence enveloped them. Both stood there, realizing how fate had brought them back together in a way neither had anticipated.

But the road ahead wouldn't be easy. The decisions they made would not only affect their lives but also that of a child who, though unaware of what lay ahead, would be the one to unite them despite everything.

With a mix of hope and fear, Adrien made a decision that would change the course of his life. He wouldn't let his son grow up not knowing who his father was. He wouldn't let the shadows of the past tear them apart again.

The future was uncertain, but in that moment, Adrien knew he had a reason to keep moving forward. After Ana said goodbye, Adrien was left deep in thought.
###chapter 50: The Unexpected Bond
The soft morning sunlight filtered through the curtains of Adrien's apartment, but his mind was trapped in a whirlwind of thoughts that suffocated him. He couldn't stop thinking about Ana's words, about the child he didn't know he had, and the anguish of their situation. Everything had changed in an instant.

The door burst open, and Adrien looked up, startled. Ana entered, her eyes red and swollen as if she had been crying for hours. Her face was a mix of worry and fear. She didn't have to say anything for Adrien to know something was wrong.

-Ana... what's going on? -Adrien asked, his voice rising.

-It's... it's about the boy, Adrien -Ana said, her voice trembling as she clutched her phone with shaking hands. -He's in the hospital.

Adrien felt the air leave his lungs as his heart sank. Every part of him went on high alert.

-What's wrong with him? Is he... is he okay? -he asked, dread tightening in his throat.

Ana sank into a nearby chair, her face pale as if the news had drained all her strength. Her eyes filled with tears again, this time of despair.

-He needs a bone marrow transplant -she said, barely able to steady her voice. -The doctors say there's a chance to save him, but... only you can help.

Adrien stared at her, uncomprehending. Confusion gripped him, and his stomach churned.

-How? Why me? -he demanded, searching for answers.

-Because... -Ana swallowed hard before continuing, -I'm not a match for him. There's no one else who can be a donor. And the doctors... they said that as his father, you're his only hope.

Adrien froze, as if time itself had stopped. Her words echoed in his mind, over and over, and his heart, though already broken by her revelation, began to beat with a new urgency.

-Why didn't you tell me this before, Ana? -he asked, his voice laced with frustration and pain. -Why didn't you tell me my son could be in danger?

Ana looked at him, knowing there weren't enough words to justify her past decisions. But now, none of that mattered. All that mattered was saving the boy.

-I told you when it was too late -she admitted, her voice breaking. -I didn't want you involved, Adrien. I didn't want you to suffer for something you never chose. But he's here now, and he needs you. He needs his father.

Adrien closed his eyes, taking a deep breath to steady himself. The emotions threatened to overwhelm him, but beneath the fear of the unknown, a sense of responsibility took root.

-Where is he? -he asked, standing abruptly.

-He's at a clinic downtown -Ana said, relief and desperation in her voice. -The doctors said we have to act fast, Adrien. If we don't...

-Take me there -Adrien interrupted. The decision was already made. He couldn't stand by while his son fought for his life.

Ana nodded quickly, rising to her feet. Together, they left the apartment, their steps hurried as they headed toward an uncertain future.

The air felt heavier as they approached the clinic. Adrien walked beside Ana, the weight of responsibility pressing down on him. He had spent so long unaware of his son's existence, but now, none of that mattered. The boy, hidden in the shadows of his life, needed help, and Adrien wouldn't turn away.

A doctor greeted them at the clinic and guided them to the emergency ward. There, in a hospital bed, lay a small, fragile child. His face, eerily similar to Adrien's, was a mix of innocence and vulnerability. His eyes were closed, and his breathing uneven, making Adrien's fear swell.

-Is that him? -Adrien murmured, staring at the boy with emotions he couldn't name. -What's his name?

-Luca -Ana replied, her voice trembling. -His name is Luca. He's... he's our son, Adrien.

Adrien took slow, hesitant steps toward the bed. His shoulders shook slightly as he stood over the child, fear and awe mixing in his expression. Luca was connected to several machines, each beep a painful reminder of his fragile state.

Adrien reached out with a trembling hand, then hesitated. How could he touch someone he hadn't even known existed?

-He's so small... -Adrien whispered, his voice barely audible as tears welled up in his eyes.

Ana watched him, her chest tightening with guilt. She wanted to comfort him, to explain again why she had kept the truth hidden, but she knew this wasn't the time.

-I'm so sorry... -Adrien murmured, leaning over Luca's bed. -I'm sorry I wasn't here. I didn't know you existed, but that doesn't matter now. I'm here, son. I'm here, and I won't let anything happen to you.

Ana choked back a sob. Seeing Adrien like this, vulnerable and speaking to a child who couldn't respond, was heartbreaking. She had stolen years of fatherhood from him, moments they could never get back.

Adrien turned to her suddenly, tears streaming down his face, anger and pain mingling in his eyes.

-How could you, Ana? -he said, his voice broken but intense. -How could you keep him from me? How could you carry this alone, knowing I was out there?

Ana's legs felt weak, but she forced herself to stand firm. This was the moment she had dreaded for years, but she couldn't avoid it any longer.

-I had no choice, Adrien -she said, her voice stronger than she expected, though her heart broke with every word. -Your mother threatened me. She said if I didn't leave and get rid of the baby, she would ruin both our lives. I couldn't hurt Luca. I couldn't give him up, so I left. It wasn't easy, Adrien. It was never easy.

Adrien clenched his fists, trying to contain the anger boiling inside him. He wanted to yell, to blame her, himself, the world for what they had lost. But when he looked at Luca again, all that anger melted away, replaced by an overwhelming fear.

-This isn't about you or me now -he said finally, his voice firmer but still shaky. -This is about him. Saving him. And if that means leaving the past behind, so be it. But I need to know something, Ana. -He looked her directly in the eyes, his intensity making her want to look away. -Did you really think I wouldn't love him? That I wouldn't want to be part of his life?

Ana swallowed hard, tears streaming freely down her face.

-It wasn't that I didn't believe in you, Adrien. I didn't believe in myself. I didn't know how to face everything that was happening, and I was scared. But now I know I was wrong. I was wrong to keep you away, and I'll never be able to make it right.

Silence fell between them, heavy with unspoken emotions. Adrien finally turned back to Luca, his expression softening as he took his son's tiny hand.

-The first thing I'll do when we leave here is make up for all the time we lost -he said, his voice steady with resolve. -This boy is my son, and I won't fail him.

Ana watched him, her heart filled with remorse but also a glimmer of hope. Maybe this was the beginning of something new, something they couldn't have had otherwise.

But then an alarm on one of the machines blared, and a nurse rushed into the room. Adrien and Ana exchanged panicked looks as doctors hurried in.

-What's happening? -Adrien asked, his voice trembling as he stepped back.

-His condition is fluctuating -the nurse said calmly, though her tone didn't hide the urgency. -We need to stabilize him immediately.

Adrien froze, watching helplessly as the medical team surrounded Luca. Ana gripped his arm, seeking solace in his presence, though both knew this was beyond their control.

In that moment, Adrien made a decision. No matter how scared he was or how many questions remained unanswered, he would do whatever it took to save Luca -even if it meant facing his own demons and a past he thought he had buried long ago.
###chapter 51: Words in Uncertainty
Ana sat in the waiting room, holding Adrien's phone tightly in her hands. She had been gripping it since they escorted him to surgery, as if the device was her only anchor to reality in that moment of uncertainty. Before being taken to the operating room, Adrien had looked at her with a mix of serenity and concern.

-Ana, I need you to text Margaret. If something happens to me she needs to know what's going on. But don't explain everything. Just tell her I'm sorry and that I hope to return to explain it myself.

Ana nodded, her voice caught in her throat, unable to respond with more than a squeeze of his hand. Now, with minutes feeling like hours, she tried to find the right words to send that message.

She forced herself to take a deep breath as she unlocked the phone. Opening the messaging app, she found Margaret's contact. Her profile picture showed a warm sunset, and just looking at it gave Ana the sense that this woman must be important to Adrien.

Message to Margaret:
"Margaret, this is Ana. We don't know each other, but Adrien asked me to write you this message. He's about to go into surgery and wanted to tell you something important: 'Margaret, I'm sorry for leaving you alone with Mateo knowing the situation you're going through. I hope I survive so I can explain everything in person.' He needs you, even if he doesn't say it directly. I know this message isn't enough, but it's the least I can do for now."

Ana read and reread each word before sending it, doubting if it was the right thing to do. But she knew she had to fulfill Adrien's request. With slightly trembling fingers, she pressed "Send."

Elsewhere, Margaret was sitting on her sofa, watching as Mateo played with his blocks. Although her son laughed and chatted, she couldn't shake the weight on her chest. Ever since Adrien had left abruptly, the feeling that something serious was happening hadn't left her.

The sound of her phone vibrating on the table pulled her from her thoughts. She grabbed it quickly, thinking it might be Adrien, and it was, but with a message that froze her blood as she read it.

The first line filled her with a mix of relief and worry: Adrien was alive, but something very serious must be going on. The message was ambiguous but loaded with emotion. Margaret read it over and over, trying to decipher more than the words revealed.

Mateo approached his mother, concerned by her expression.

-Are you okay, Mom? -he asked, stroking her hand with the tenderness only a child could offer.

Margaret leaned down to hug him, her thoughts swirling in a storm.

-Yes, sweetheart -she said, though she didn't entirely feel it.

But deep down, a decision was forming. Adrien had made it clear that something important was at stake, and although she didn't know exactly what it was, she knew she couldn't just wait. She had to be strong, for Mateo and perhaps for Adrien.

With renewed determination, Margaret replied to Ana's message.

Ana was still in the waiting room, watching the clock as if she could make time move faster. Every second felt eternal. The room was almost empty, and the silence only intensified the pressure in her chest.

When the notification of a reply came, buzzing on the phone, Ana grabbed it immediately. Opening the message, the words she read left her frozen:
"Thank you for letting me know. Tell Adrien that we'll be here waiting for him. No matter what happens, he's not alone; his son misses him too."

Ana felt the air escape her lungs. Her mind got stuck on those final words: "His son misses him."

Emotions swirled inside her. What did that mean? Adrien had built a family while she had been falling apart alone, caring for Luca. The idea hurt more than she expected, though she knew she had no right to feel this way. After all, she was the one who decided to disappear, the one who carried the secret without sharing it. Even so, a tinge of bitterness seeped into her heart.

She bit her lip, trying to hold back the tears welling in her eyes. For years, she had imagined this moment: reuniting with Adrien, confessing the truth, and maybe finding a way forward together. But now, it seemed that dream had already been claimed by someone else. "His son misses him." The words echoed in her mind endlessly.

Who was this woman? The thought confused and tormented her. Had he fallen in love? Had he forgotten what they once shared? Ana shook her head, trying to push those thoughts aside. She had no right to judge. She was the one who had left him behind, driven by circumstances and her mother's threats.

However, she couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. For years, she had carried the burden of raising Luca alone, facing nights of fever, moments of anguish, and the constant loneliness of having no one by her side. And now, the man she had once loved had someone else, had another life.

Ana clenched her fists, trying to steady her breathing. This was not the time to think about herself. Luca was the priority. He always had been. If Adrien could save him, then everything else had to take a backseat. It didn't matter how much it hurt, how much she wished she could turn back time and change things.

She closed her eyes, letting a tear roll down her cheek. She had lost so much in recent years: her youth, her love, and now perhaps the chance to reclaim Adrien. But she couldn't afford to lose Luca. He was her anchor, her reason for living. All that mattered was that her son had a chance at a future.

She put the phone in her bag with trembling hands, trying to focus her thoughts. However, a troubling idea struck her. If Adrien survived, what would happen next? Could they rebuild something between them? Was there even a place for her in his life?

She wondered if Adrien could ever forgive her for keeping his son from him. Would he understand? Or would he simply relegate her to the role of a lost love, someone not worth remembering?

The uncertainty consumed her, but there was one truth she couldn't ignore: Adrien deserved to know everything. He deserved to understand every detail of what had led her to make such a cruel decision. Maybe he would hate her, maybe he would never forgive her, but it was the right thing to do.

Ana sighed deeply, her heart torn between love, guilt, and fear. Only time would tell if they could face the abyss that separated them together. For now, all she could do was wait. Because, for the first time in a long time, she had no control over what fate had in store for them.
###chapter 52: Crossed Paths
Ana was in the clinic's waiting room, clutching her purse tightly. Seconds felt like hours, and every time she saw a nurse or doctor pass through the hallway, her heart leapt into her throat. It had been hours since Adrien had gone into surgery, but the agony of not knowing what was happening was almost unbearable.

As she stared at the floor, memories of their last conversation came rushing back. His words, his tone, the way he looked at her before disappearing behind those double doors

-"If something happens to me, take care of him. Please, Ana. Promise me."

That plea had left her speechless. How could he even think of such a possibility? Adrien had to pull through. She couldn't lose him now, not after finding him again.

Suddenly, her phone vibrated in her purse. She quickly pulled it out, hoping for news about the procedure. However, what she found was an unexpected message.

-Margaret: "I'm sure everything will be fine. Mateo is waiting for you. He needs you, Adrien. You're his hero."

Ana read the message several times. Her eyes lingered on the last sentence: "Mateo is waiting for you." Her mind couldn't stop imagining Adrien with another child, building a family that didn't include Luca or her.

A sharp pang of jealousy and sadness hit her instantly, but beneath that pain was something deeper: guilt. She had deprived Adrien of the first years of his son's life. And now, the possibility that he had found comfort in another family made that guilt even heavier.

-"How did we get here?" -she whispered, clutching her phone to her chest.

A nurse approached her at that moment, pulling her out of her thoughts.

-"Ma'am, the procedure is ongoing. So far, everything is going well."

Ana nodded, momentarily relieved. But the uncertainty lingered.

Meanwhile, in the operating room, Adrien was fighting the unconsciousness that enveloped him. Memories of his life swirled like a whirlwind: happy moments with his family, the pain of losing Ana, the surprise of discovering Luca, and the warmth in Mateo's eyes when he called him "dad."

Everything was so intertwined, so confusing. But one thing was clear: he couldn't fail Luca. He couldn't fail that boy who had come into his life unexpectedly but was now part of his soul.

In the depths of his mind, one promise echoed: "I'll always be here for you. No matter what happens."

Hours later, Ana jumped when the doctor finally emerged from the operating room. She stood up quickly, her heart racing.

-"How is he?" -she asked, her voice full of urgency.

The doctor smiled slightly.

-"The procedure was successful. Adrien is stable. He just needs time to recover now."

Relief flooded her, and tears began streaming uncontrollably down her face.

-"Thank you thank you, doctor."

However, as the doctor walked away, Ana felt her joy mingling with a new unease. Adrien had survived, but what would that mean for them? Could she face him with everything left unsaid?

Taking a deep breath, Ana headed toward the recovery area. It was time to confront not only Adrien but also everything they had left in the past. Now that life was giving them another chance, the question was whether they could seize it.

Ana slowly approached the recovery room, her steps heavy and her heart pounding. Every exhale seemed to release a flood of emotions she couldn't contain: relief, fear, and even a glimmer of hope. Adrien was alive. He had survived.

When she reached the door, a nurse stopped her.

-"He's awake but still weak," -she explained calmly. -"Try not to overwhelm him."

Ana nodded, taking a deep breath before entering. As she opened the door, she saw him lying in bed. His skin was pale, but his eyes, though tired, held the same warmth she'd always known.

-"Adrien" -she whispered, approaching him slowly.

He turned his head toward her, a faint smile appearing on his face.

-"Hi, Ana." -His voice was hoarse, barely a whisper, but his words carried a warmth that made her tremble.

Ana took the chair by his bedside and sat down, unsure of what to say. For a moment, she simply looked at him, letting the reality of his survival comfort her.

-"Thank you," -she finally murmured, breaking the silence. -"For doing this for Luca. I don't know how to thank you"

Adrien looked at her intently, his expression serious.

-"You don't have to thank me. He's my son. There's nothing I wouldn't do for him."

The words hit her hard. Even though she knew they were true, hearing them from Adrien's lips made them even more real.

-"How is he?" -Adrien asked after a moment, breaking the tension that had built between them.

-"Stable, for now. The doctors say his levels will improve with time. Thanks to you." -Ana leaned forward slightly, letting out a shaky sigh.

Adrien closed his eyes, nodding slightly.

-"That's all that matters."

Ana watched him in silence, her heart torn. There were so many things they still needed to say, so many wounds that needed healing, but now wasn't the time. However, one question tormented her.

-"Why did you ask me to write to Margaret?" -she blurted out suddenly, her voice barely a whisper but heavy with emotion.

Adrien opened his eyes, looking at her with some confusion.

-"Because I couldn't leave without explaining to her why I wasn't there for Mateo. He's part of my life now too, Ana."

The confession left her breathless. Even though she had suspected it, hearing him confirm that someone else was part of his life was a blow she hadn't expected to face at that moment.

-"So, you have a new family?" -she asked, trying to keep her voice steady, even though she knew she was on the verge of tears.

Adrien frowned, noticing the pain in her words.

-"It's not a new family, Ana. Margaret and Mateo are different. You don't understand because I haven't explained it to you, but"

-"I don't need explanations." -Ana interrupted him, abruptly standing up from the chair. -"I know I have no right to demand anything, but it hurts to know that while I was struggling alone, you"

She trailed off, unable to continue.

Adrien sat up slightly, ignoring the pain coursing through his body.

-"Ana, you chose to disappear. You never gave me the chance to be with you, to be part of your life or Luca's. But that doesn't mean I don't want to be here now."

Ana looked at him, tears finally falling.

-"It wasn't a choice. I was forced to leave, Adrien. But I never stopped loving you, even when I knew I couldn't come back."

Her words hung in the air between them, heavy with years of pain and regret. Adrien didn't know what to say. For the first time in a long time, he felt completely vulnerable.

Ana slowly stepped closer, placing her hand over his.

-"Luca needs you. That's all that matters now."

Adrien gently squeezed her hand, nodding.

-"I know. But that doesn't mean we can't fix things between us, Ana. I want to understand everything that happened. I want Luca to grow up with both of us."

Ana looked into his eyes, a mix of hope and fear.

-"First, we need to recover. Then we'll see if that's possible."

Silence settled between them again, but this time it wasn't uncomfortable. It was a silence full of unspoken promises, of a possibility they had both feared for so long. Fate had brought them together once more, and though the path ahead was uncertain, both were willing to walk it.
 ###chapter 53: Fragile Bonds
The silence in Adrien's room seemed eternal, broken only by the faint beeping of the monitors marking his vital signs. Ana stood by the window, watching the city from the hospital. The first rays of sunlight were beginning to illuminate the horizon, but her heart remained immersed in the darkness of memories and doubts.

Adrien was asleep, exhausted from the procedure and the emotions of the previous day. His face showed a mix of tiredness and peace, a calm that Ana wished she could feel but found elusive.

As she watched him, a mix of love, regret, and fear filled her. Had she done the right thing by seeking him after all these years? Though Luca now had a chance to survive, it had reopened wounds that might never heal.

Her phone vibrated softly in her bag, pulling her from her thoughts. She quickly took it out and saw a message from the doctor in charge of Luca:

"Luca is stable, but he will need constant monitoring. You can visit him when you are ready."

Ana sighed in relief, though she knew this was just the beginning. She put the phone away and looked at Adrien once more.

-Thank you for saving him -she whispered, knowing he couldn't hear her.

Before leaving the room, she left a note on the nightstand:

"I'm with Luca. We'll talk when you recover. Ana."

When Ana arrived at the pediatric unit, she found Luca in his bed, connected to several monitors, but with a more relaxed expression than in the previous days. His small body fought with every fiber of its being, and Ana felt a pang of guilt thinking that she had waited so long to seek help.

-Mom... -Luca murmured weakly as she entered.

-I'm here, my love -Ana replied, quickly moving closer and taking his small hand.

-Is the man who came... my dad? -Luca asked, with the innocence of a child who doesn't fully understand the complexities of human relationships.

Ana swallowed hard, surprised by the question.

-Yes, darling. He is your dad.

Luca smiled faintly.

-Is he going to stay?

Ana didn't know what to say. She wanted to tell him yes, that Adrien would be there for him, for both of them, but the reality was much more complicated.

-We'll do everything we can to make sure he does -she finally replied, gently stroking his hair.

As Luca closed his eyes again, Ana felt a weight in her chest. Adrien had proven he was willing to do anything for Luca, but what did that mean for them as a family?

Hours later, Ana returned to Adrien's room. She found him awake, with the note she had left in his hand, staring at it intently.

-How is he? -Adrien asked as soon as he saw her enter.

-Stable. The doctors say he's responding well. Thanks to you.

Adrien nodded, but his gaze was serious.

-Ana, we need to talk.

Ana closed the door behind her and walked over slowly.

-I know.

Adrien sat up a bit in bed, though he still looked weak.

-I want to know everything. Why did you leave? Why didn't you tell me?

Ana took a deep breath, feeling her chest tighten.

-It wasn't an easy decision. When I found out I was pregnant, your mother confronted me. She demanded I abort, that I disappear from your life. I couldn't do it, Adrien. I couldn't take away our son's chance at life.

Adrien closed his eyes, processing her words.

-And you thought leaving was the best choice?

-I didn't have another option -Ana replied, her voice trembling. -Your mother had resources, power... I couldn't fight against her. So, I left, far away, to protect Luca.

Adrien felt his chest burn.

-Protect him from what, Ana? From me? I never would have let my mother hurt you.

-I know -Ana said, tears falling down her cheeks. -But at that moment, I didn't see another way.

The silence between them was heavy, filled with unsaid words and repressed emotions. Finally, Adrien spoke.

-I want to be there for him, Ana. Not just because he needs my marrow, but because he's my son. I want to know him, be part of his life.

Ana nodded slowly, feeling a mix of relief and fear.

-That's all I've ever wanted for him.

As they looked at each other, they both knew that, though the road would be difficult, they were willing to try. For Luca. For them. For what they had lost and what they could still recover.

After talking to Adrien, Ana walked firmly toward the pediatric unit, her heart pounding with each step. She needed to see her son again, hug him, feel that all she had done had not been in vain. Her son, Luca, still didn't understand what was happening, but Ana did: every second was crucial, and she couldn't afford to lose him.

When she entered the room, Luca was in bed, staring at the ceiling with tired eyes, but when he saw her, a small smile appeared on his face.

-Mom... -he said, his voice weak but full of hope.

Ana quickly moved to her son, gently taking his hand.

-I'm here, my love. How do you feel?

-A little better... -Luca replied, with a faint smile that made Ana feel relieved. -Will Dad come soon?

Ana's heart skipped a beat when she heard the word "dad." She didn't know whether to tell him the truth or simply stay silent, as the uncertainty about their future as a family was bigger than ever. But she couldn't lie to Luca.

-Yes, darling, he will come soon -she said, gently stroking his face.

At that moment, Adrien entered the room. The door opened slowly, and Ana looked up, meeting Adrien's gaze. He was standing, still weak, but with a determination Ana hadn't seen before.

Luca, noticing his presence, tried to sit up a bit in bed, his eyes sparkling with emotion.

-Dad... -Luca whispered, almost as if he couldn't believe he was there.

Adrien couldn't help but smile, but his smile quickly faded when he saw the fragile state of his son. He slowly approached the bed, not taking his eyes off Luca, and crouched down to be at his level.

-Hello, little one -Adrien said, his voice cracking with emotion.

Luca extended his hand weakly, and Adrien gently took it, feeling that at that moment, everything else lost importance.

-I'm going to take care of you, I promise -Adrien said, his voice full of a firmness that surprised even him.

Ana watched the scene in silence, feeling a knot in her stomach. There were so many unanswered questions, so much she needed to tell Adrien about everything that had happened, but now, seeing the connection between him and Luca, she realized that for once, the past had to be left behind.

-What matters most to me now is that you're okay, Luca -Adrien said, gently stroking his son's hand. -I'm here for you. No matter what happens, I'll always be here.

Luca closed his eyes, feeling the comfort of his father's words.

-Dad... -he murmured, with a faint smile. -I love you.

Ana, hearing those words, felt a wave of emotions overwhelm her. She had never imagined seeing Adrien as a father, nor that her son would accept him so easily. But seeing that small spark of joy on Luca's face, something in her heart softened.

-I know, son. And I love you more than you can imagine -Adrien replied, his voice filled with emotion.

The moment of connection was brief, but meaningful. Ana felt that all she had fought to hide over the past years was crumbling, though there were still too many shadows between her and Adrien.

-I'm going to stay a little longer with him -Ana said, standing up to let Adrien spend time with Luca.

Adrien nodded, looking at his son with tenderness.

-Thank you, Ana. I know it hasn't been easy for you, but I promise I'm going to be here for him. For both of you.

Ana smiled with a mix of sadness and hope, feeling that, although the future remained uncertain, at least now there was a chance to start over.

As Ana left the room, Adrien sat next to Luca, who had fallen asleep shortly after their encounter. Adrien looked at his small face, filled with peace but also marked by the struggle he had endured.

The uncertainty about the future of their family still weighed on him, but for the first time, he felt like he was taking the right path. He didn't know what would happen next, or how things would change, but now, for the first time, there was something he could place his hope in: Luca.
###chapter 54: The Call
Nights in Paris were silent, and the uncertainty about Adrien's condition had become unbearable. The void of not having answers was emotionally draining her. Sometimes, she felt that the only way to cope was to stay busy, but something always stopped her: the idea that if she reached out to him, the words she might hear might not be what she wanted.

One afternoon, while reviewing some documents in her apartment, the phone rang. Seeing the name on the screen, her heart skipped a beat. It was Adrien.

Without hesitation, she answered.

-Adrien? -Her voice trembled, barely able to contain the mix of relief and anxiety that washed over her upon hearing his voice again.

On the other end, Adrien exhaled deeply before speaking.

-It's me, Margaret... I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't call sooner. Things have been complicated here. How are you? And Mateo? -His voice was soft, but he sounded exhausted.

Margaret closed her eyes for a moment, letting his words settle in her heart. She wasn't sure if she was ready to talk about everything that had happened, but her need to know about him was stronger than her fear.

-I'm fine I don't know if that really matters, but... Mateo's fine. He's been strong, as always. -She replied, omitting how hard it had been for her, yet carrying the weight of everything unsaid.

Adrien stayed silent for a moment, clearly wrestling with his thoughts.

-I'm glad to hear Mateo's okay. -He sighed, as though feeling some relief. -I... I don't even know where to start. Everything has been such a whirlwind, and I feel lost.

The sincerity in his voice made Margaret feel like perhaps the moment to finally talk had arrived, to clear things up. But she couldn't simply spill everything she'd kept bottled up for so long.

Adrien took a deep breath before continuing, still recovering from his surgery but determined to be honest. The truth was, everything that had happened in his life-his unexpected trip to Argentina-had been so confusing and rushed that he didn't know how to put it into words.

-Margaret... I... -His voice faltered at first. -I went to Argentina because Ana called me urgently. It was unplanned. She needed me there, and when someone calls you like that, you can't do anything but go.

Margaret, completely taken aback, couldn't help but interrupt him.

-Ana? Who is she? -Her tone was curious, but a hint of worry crept in. She hadn't expected this answer. The name meant nothing to her, but something inside told her this wouldn't be a simple story.

Adrien paused, as though weighing whether he should really tell her everything, but he knew he couldn't hide what had happened, especially not from Margaret, even if they were just friends. He took a breath and explained.

-Ana... is someone from my past. -He spoke slowly, as if the words burned him. -We had a history... years ago. It wasn't easy, but it was something real, though it didn't end well. And now, well... -His voice cracked for a moment. -She and I have a son, Luca.

Silence filled the line, and Margaret tried to process the revelation. A son. Ana. Everything was happening so fast she didn't know how to react. Adrien, on the other end, couldn't see her face, but the tense calm that followed only confirmed that his news had hit her hard.

-A son? -Margaret repeated, trying to absorb the information. The words were there, hanging in the air, but she still couldn't grasp the full extent of what Adrien was telling her. -But why now? What's going on with him?

Adrien let out a sigh of exhaustion and pain.

-Luca... was very sick. -His voice softened. -He needed a bone marrow transplant, and I went to Argentina to get tested. Everything happened so fast, Margaret, and even though... -He paused, his heart heavy. -Even though I hadn't planned for it, I ended up undergoing surgery to donate my bone marrow to my son.

Margaret felt like the world was spinning around her. Everything Adrien had said was hitting her like a sharp blow. A son, a surgery, and a past love that apparently still had a significant place in his life. Her mind raced in circles, and the pain of not having known any of this consumed her.

-Adrien... -Margaret spoke firmly, though her thoughts were in turmoil. -Why didn't you tell me any of this before? Why didn't you talk to me about Ana or Luca? I'm... I'm completely confused.

Adrien closed his eyes, feeling the weight of the situation. He knew Margaret deserved an explanation, but the words didn't come easily.

-I swear I didn't know anything about this, Margaret. And then I didn't know how to tell you... I was lost in my own world when Ana called, and everything happened so quickly. My mind was focused on saving Luca, and now... -He stopped, letting out a long sigh.

Margaret nodded slowly, though she wasn't sure how to feel. It had been so long since she'd heard from him, and now she was faced with an entirely new situation, one she hadn't expected. Her mind struggled to make sense of everything she had just heard.

-And now what, Adrien? What's going to happen with Luca? -She asked, her voice weak. -What about Ana?

Adrien sighed deeply, his heart heavy with conflict.

-Now, all that matters is Luca. -He said, almost in a whisper. -I'm going to be there for him. I'll make sure he recovers. And with Ana... I don't know what's going to happen. I'm not sure, Margaret. The only thing I know is that now, more than ever, I need to be there for my son.

-Alright, Adrien... -She finally said, her voice tired. -I just want Luca to be okay. And for you to be okay too. That's what's most important.

Adrien exhaled, relieved though his heart was still filled with uncertainty. He didn't know how to move forward from all this, but something inside told him that maybe, just maybe, there was a future beyond the mistakes of the past.

The call ended with unresolved words but with a small glimmer of hope. No one knew what the future held, but what they did know was that, for the first time in a long time, the pieces of the puzzle were beginning to fall into place.
 ###chapter 55: Returning Home
The fresh morning air entered through the hospital window as the sunlight illuminated the room where Adrien and Luca rested. After days of uncertainty, both were ready to be discharged, but the excitement of recovery was mixed with concern for what lay ahead. The doctors had been clear: both Adrien and Luca needed time, lots of care, and, above all, rest.

The doctor entered the room with his typical serious expression, but with a slight smile that eased some of the tension that had been present over the past few days. He carried a folder with the final results of the two patients and, although both were much better, the gravity of the procedure was far from forgotten.

-Adrien, Luca, you're both in good condition to leave. -The doctor spoke firmly but with that professional calmness that reassured anyone. -However, you must follow all instructions to the letter to avoid any complications.

Luca was sitting on the bed with a timid smile, still weak but much more animated than before. Adrien, on the other hand, looked a bit paler than usual, but the color was already returning to his face.

-What kind of care do they need? -asked Ana, who hadn't stopped watching them the entire time. Though she didn't show it, her worry was as great as any mother's. She was afraid that everything they had gone through wasn't enough, that everything might fall apart again if something went wrong.

The doctor took out a list of recommendations and began to enumerate them.

-Adrien, you must avoid any type of physical exertion in the coming days. No intense activity, just light walking every day and plenty of rest. The surgery for the bone marrow donation was extensive, so your body needs time to recover. Also, make sure to strictly follow the medication schedule to avoid infections or complications.

-And Luca? -Ana asked, looking at the little boy, who now seemed a bit more cheerful.

-Luca also needs similar care. Although his body is responding well to the donated marrow, he must remain calm. The first few days will be crucial to avoid any kind of relapse. -The doctor gave Ana a serious look. -Make sure he gets enough rest and avoid any situation that could disturb his well-being. Keep him in a calm and stress-free environment.

Ana nodded, mentally taking note of every word the doctor said. She wasn't going to leave them for a single moment and was preparing to be their unconditional support.

Once the doctor left, Adrien was lost in thought. He knew there was a lot of work to do to fully recover, but what worried him the most was how he was going to face everything in his current state.

-So, where do we go after this? -Adrien asked Ana, with a faint smile that barely hid his exhaustion.

Ana looked at him, and her eyes showed something more than just tiredness. It had been a difficult situation, but now that he was better, she felt the need to take the next step.

-The best thing is for you to stay with me and Luca. -Ana said, firmly but also with a softness only he could understand. -You'll recover much better at home, surrounded by peace. I'll take care of everything, I don't want you to worry anymore. You're not 100% yet, Adrien. And the last thing I want is for you to feel alone during this process.

Adrien remained silent for a moment, as if processing her words. He never imagined he'd live with Ana again, much less under these circumstances. It wasn't the life he had planned, but something inside him told him he needed to trust her, that he needed to be close to Luca, that it was what mattered most right now.

-I don't want to be a burden to you, Ana. -he finally said, his voice still weak. -But I don't know, maybe you're right. It could be the best, at least until I fully recover.

Ana smiled, though her smile carried a mix of emotions she couldn't completely express. There was much to heal between them, too many things left unsaid, too many memories floating between them. But, for now, she only focused on what was in front of her: her son, Adrien, and the uncertain future they would have to face together.

-You're not a burden, Adrien. And you don't have to do it all alone. -she said, moving a little closer and gently touching his arm. -I don't want you to face this alone. Not after everything that's happened.

Adrien looked at her, his eyes full of gratitude but also confusion. He was grateful for her support, but he still didn't know what would happen next. Would they go back to how they were before? Could there be something more between them in the future?

-Thank you, Ana. Really. -his voice trembled slightly, as if realizing how much he needed her support.

She smiled at him again, that smile filled with a sweetness she rarely showed but that felt sincere.

-We'll start again, step by step. First, I'll take care of you, then we'll see what happens with the rest.

The conversation hung in the air, but the words were enough for both of them. Ana's home, with its peace and with Luca, would be the place where they would begin to heal, to face everything they had left to live. One day at a time, together.

In the waiting room, Ana received the news that everything was ready to leave. As she watched Adrien prepare to leave the hospital, the feeling that, despite everything they had been through, there was a chance to start over grew stronger. And though uncertainty surrounded them, at that moment, the only thing that mattered was that they would be together, at least for a while.

As they walked toward the hospital exit, Adrien couldn't help but look at Ana and Luca, realizing that this was the beginning of something bigger, something neither of them could predict but that was there, waiting for them.

Both knew they had to be strong. But for the first time in a long time, Adrien allowed himself to feel hope.
###chapter 56: The Arrival of Adrien’s Mother
Leaving the hospital was imminent. Adrien walked slowly, leaning on Ana's arm, who guided him with gentle yet firm support. Luca was beside them in a wheelchair, his eyes gleaming with a hope he hadn't shown in a long time. The idea of returning home, though filled with uncertainty, offered a sense of relief. Adrien knew he still had a long way to go to regain his strength, but at least he wasn't doing it alone.

Suddenly, the sound of hurried heels echoed in the hallway. Ana had no time to react when she saw a tall, dark-haired, and elegant woman approaching quickly. The woman's gaze was firm, almost imposing, carrying an aura of authority that couldn't be ignored.

It was Adrien's mother.

-What's going on here? - The woman's voice was authoritative, with a tone that left no room for doubt or contradiction. It wasn't a question but a statement of her dominating presence.

Adrien, upon seeing his mother, stopped. His face, though tired, filled with an uncomfortable expression.

-Mom - he said, with a resigned look. He knew his mother wouldn't accept him staying at Ana's house, and this was just the tip of the iceberg.

Adrien's mother, flashing a cold smile, approached him, casting a dismissive glance at Ana and Luca.

-What are you doing here? - she said, not bothering to be polite. -You're coming with me, Adrien. You're weak and need my help. And your son - she turned to Luca with an air of superiority - he'll come with me too. I'll handle everything. The best thing is for both of you to come with me. So, Ana, please don't get in the way.

Ana, completely taken aback by Adrien's mother's sudden appearance, couldn't help but tense up. She hadn't expected anyone else to have control over the situation.

-What are you saying? - Ana asked, holding Adrien's hand more firmly. -I'm not letting you take my son just like that.

Adrien's mother looked at her with disdain, as if Ana were nothing more than a nuisance in her path.

-Your son - Adrien's mother emphasized the words with a tone of contempt - would be much better off with me. You don't know how to handle this situation. I'll take them to my house, where I can care for them properly.

Ana frowned, feeling a wave of anger starting to build inside her. She wasn't going to let Luca go without a fight.

-I won't let you do that - Ana said, her voice tense and determined. -Adrien and Luca are staying with me.

Adrien's mother glared at her, her eyes full of disdain. She didn't like being challenged, especially not by a woman who had no idea what it meant to be a mother.

-I told you not to get in the way, dear - she replied, with a smile that wasn't kind but rather mocking. In one swift motion, she extended her hand and shoved Ana.

Ana, surprised by the aggression, took a few steps back, stumbling before falling into a nearby chair. The push wasn't strong, but it was enough to leave her stunned. For a moment, she stared at Adrien's mother, who watched her coldly, as if what she had just done was the most normal thing in the world.

Adrien, seeing what had happened, felt his breath catch. He couldn't stand his mother acting like this, but he also couldn't bear to see Ana hurting.

-Mom! - Adrien exclaimed, grabbing his mother by the arms and pulling her away from Ana. -What the hell are you doing?!

Adrien's mother, now shocked by her son's reaction, looked at him with a mixture of anger and surprise.

-I'm just trying to take care of you, Adrien. - Her voice, however, didn't sound empathetic but as if she believed she was absolutely right. -Has this woman influenced you so much that you'd rather stay with her? I'll take you to my house, where you can recover properly!

Ana, still stunned by the push, slowly stood up. She placed her hand on the arm that had absorbed the impact, but she wasn't going to back down. No matter what Adrien's mother did, she was going to fight for what she believed was best for Luca and Adrien.

-You have no right to do this, ma'am - Ana said, her voice renewed with determination. -They're staying with me. You're not going to tear us apart.

Adrien's mother, seeing Ana's resistance, paused for a moment, as if considering her next move. The tension in the air grew thicker, and Adrien felt a weight in his chest. His mother's words and Ana's attitude only made an already difficult situation more complicated.

-I told you, Adrien. She doesn't know what it means to care for a child - his mother said, not taking her eyes off Ana. -The best thing is for Luca and you to come with me. So please stop making excuses.

But before she could say anything else, Adrien, with labored breaths, stepped between his mother and Ana.

-Enough! - Adrien shouted, looking at his mother with a mixture of frustration and exhaustion. -I'm staying with Ana, with Luca. I'm not going to your house. I won't let you keep controlling my life like this.

Adrien's mother, hearing this, took a step back, looking at her son with a mix of disbelief and disdain. She couldn't understand why Adrien, after everything, would choose to stay with Ana.

The conflict between them, between what Adrien wanted and what his mother desired, had just erupted.

-You need to be responsible, Adrien - she said, turning away with a gesture full of disapproval. -You'll regret this, mark my words.

With one last cold glance, Adrien's mother walked away, leaving them behind in an atmosphere heavy with unresolved tension.

Adrien looked at Ana, who now watched him with a mix of concern and something deeper, something he couldn't yet identify. But he was sure of one thing: the fight wasn't over, and he would face it alongside her.

For now, all that mattered was that Adrien and Luca were safe, and their small home awaited them.
###chapter 57: A Refuge in Argentina
The car moved along a tree-lined road, leaving the hospital behind. Ana drove with determination, while Adrien and Luca sat silently together in the back seat. The air inside the vehicle was heavy with unspoken emotions. Adrien, though recovering, was still weak, and Luca, still frail, kept his small hands over his father's, seeking comfort.

When they reached the modest neighborhood where Ana lived, Adrien saw the house for the first time. It was small, with white walls slightly worn by time, but the flower-filled planters gave it a welcoming feel. It was simple, far from the luxury he had known, yet something about the way Ana looked at him made it feel like home.

-This is it, -Ana said, turning off the engine. Her words were simple, but her voice carried a mix of pride and nervousness.

Adrien nodded, glancing at Luca. -Ready to see your house, champ?

Luca nodded, clinging tighter to him. Adrien carefully got out of the car, making sure not to strain his body. Ana led them to the door, opened it, and invited them inside.

The interior of the house was warm, with simple furniture and a cozy decor. There were photographs on the walls, many of them of Luca at different stages of his life. Adrien looked at them closely, his heart sinking as he realized how much he had missed.

-It's a modest place, but it has everything we need, -Ana said nervously, watching Adrien.

-It's perfect, -he replied sincerely.

Ana gave a slight smile and then turned to Luca. -Come, I'll show you your room.

Adrien followed them, admiring how Ana had decorated the small room with care. There were toys, drawings, and a little desk with crayons and notebooks. Luca ran to his bed, excited.

-This is my favorite spot, -Luca said, pointing to a shelf filled with books and animal figurines.

Adrien approached, running his fingers over the spines of the books. -It's amazing, Luca. Your mom has done a great job.

Ana, standing by the door, looked at him with a mix of pride and sadness. -I did what I could with what I had.

Adrien turned to her. -You did more than I could have ever imagined.

Before they could continue talking, a loud knock echoed from the door. Ana frowned, puzzled, and went to answer it. On the other side stood Mr. Fernández, the landlord, with his usual stern expression.

-Ana, can we talk? -he said, glancing at Adrien inside the house.

-Of course, Mr. Fernández. Is something wrong? -Ana tried to remain calm, though the man's presence always made her uneasy.

-I've been patient with you, but I can't wait any longer. I need you to pay the two months' overdue rent.

Ana felt the blood drain from her face. She had been so focused on Luca's illness and everything it entailed that she had neglected that debt.

-I understand, Mr. Fernández, but... I need a little more time. My son just got out of the hospital, and...

-Ana, you gave me that excuse last month, -the man interrupted brusquely. Then he gestured toward Adrien-. If you have visitors, maybe they can help you cover it.

Adrien, who had been listening to the conversation from the couch, stood up with difficulty and approached.

-How much is owed? -he asked firmly.

-Two months. That's eight hundred dollars total, -replied Mr. Fernández, evaluating him with a critical look.

Adrien pulled out his wallet and began searching for his card. -I want to settle this right now. Do you accept transfers?

Ana stopped him, standing in front of him. -No, Adrien. You don't have to do this.

-Yes, I do, Ana. We're in this together.

-Adrien, it's not your responsibility, -she insisted, her eyes shining with frustration.

-Yes, it is, -he responded softly but firmly. -Let me help you, Ana.

Mr. Fernández, impatient, interrupted their discussion. -Are you going to pay or not?

-Yes, it will be paid, -Adrien said, ignoring Ana's look of protest.

After completing the transfer in front of the landlord, the man checked his phone and nodded in satisfaction.

-Very well. But I don't want to hear excuses again. If there's another delay, I'll be forced to evict you.

-It won't happen again, -Adrien replied coldly, shutting the door as soon as the man left.

Ana, furious but also touched, turned to him.

-Adrien, you didn't have to do that.

-Of course I did, Ana. I can't just stand here and watch you carry all this alone. This is the least I can do.

Ana looked at him, her eyes filling with tears. -I don't know how to thank you...

Adrien gently took her hand. -You don't have to. I'm here because I want to be, for you and for Luca.

At that moment, Luca appeared in the hallway, rubbing his eyes.

-What's going on? -he asked sleepily.

Ana approached him and picked him up, carrying him back to bed. -Nothing, sweetheart. Everything's fine.

When she returned to the living room, she found Adrien looking out the window with a serious expression.

-Are you okay? -she asked.

-Yes, but I realize how much you've had to fight alone. I want to change that, Ana. I want to be here for you, for Luca.

Ana didn't respond, but her heart filled with a mix of gratitude and fear. Things were changing, and although she didn't know how it would all end, for the first time in a long time, she didn't feel alone.

As Ana tucked Luca into bed again, Adrien let his gaze wander across the small living room. On a corner shelf, a worn leather album caught his attention. Without thinking much, he picked it up and began flipping through the pages.

At first, it was photos of Luca: his first birthday, his drawings, his laughter captured in everyday moments. But as he continued, his heart sank. There they were. He and Ana, younger, smiling as if nothing could tear them apart. There were photos of trips they had taken together, afternoons in parks, and even one he had taken himself, of Ana asleep in the car seat, a smile on her lips. Adrien felt a pang of nostalgia and pain. That life they had shared seemed so distant, so irretrievable, but at the same time, those images reminded him of what he had lost and what he might still try to reclaim.
###chapter 58: Memories
  
Adrien closed the album and carefully placed it on the table, as if touching it could alter the memories it contained. He felt trapped between the past evoked by those images and the uncertain present he now shared with Ana and Luca.

The sound of the door opening pulled him out of his thoughts. Ana entered, holding a cup of tea in her hands, her expression tired but calm.

-Is everything okay? -she asked, noticing Adrien's distant gaze.

He nodded slowly.

-I found the photo album. I didn't know you had kept all of this.

Ana froze for a moment, a slight blush covering her cheeks.

-I couldn't get rid of them Even though I tried to convince myself it was for the best.

Adrien sighed, running a hand through his hair.

-It's strange. In those pictures, we looked so happy, so sure of who we were.

-We were -Ana whispered, sitting on the couch across from him. -But life doesn't always follow the path we imagine.

Silence settled between them, heavy with unspoken words. Finally, Adrien broke it.

-Ana, I've been thinking about what happened about what my mother did to you. I should never have let anyone interfere in our lives.

Ana looked at him intently, her eyes filled with conflicting emotions.

-It wasn't your fault, Adrien. I made the decision to leave. I thought I was protecting you but in the end, I just walked away from the person I loved the most.

Before Adrien could respond, a soft cry from Luca's room interrupted them. Ana quickly stood up, but Adrien placed a hand on her arm.

-Let me. I want to be with him.

Ana nodded and let him go. Adrien entered the room, where Luca was tossing and turning under the covers. He sat on the edge of the bed and gently stroked the boy's hair, who slowly opened his eyes.

-Dad -Luca whispered, still half-asleep.

The word hit Adrien like a wave of emotions. He couldn't stop a tear from sliding down his cheek as he replied.

-I'm here, son. I'm not going anywhere.

From the doorway, Ana watched the scene with a tightened heart. She knew the road ahead wouldn't be easy, but at that moment, something inside her told her that together, they could face it.

The next morning arrived with fresh air filling Ana's small house. Adrien, after spending most of the night taking care of Luca, woke up early and decided to make breakfast. Ana entered the kitchen, surprised to find him scrambling eggs in a pan.

-Since when do you cook? -she asked, leaning against the doorframe with a faint smile.

Adrien looked back at her and shrugged.

-Not as well as you, but I had to learn. Life away from home taught me a few things.

Ana let out a soft laugh, but her eyes betrayed a trace of melancholy. Adrien noticed the change in her expression and, setting the pan aside, approached her.

-Ana, what's wrong? -he asked gently.

She shook her head, trying to hide her emotions, but eventually gave in.

-It's strange having you here after so much time And seeing how quickly you connect with Luca. It's something I always dreamed of but never thought would be real.

Adrien looked at her intensely, taking her hands in his.

-Ana, I can't change what happened, but I want to be part of his life. No matter what it takes, I won't fail him.

Ana nodded, feeling the walls she had built over the years begin to crumble.

-We'll have to learn to work together, Adrien. For him.

Before Adrien could respond, the sound of the doorbell broke the moment. They exchanged confused glances. They weren't expecting visitors.

Ana went to open the door, leaving Adrien in the kitchen. When she opened it, she found a woman who looked to be in her late forties, with a serious demeanor and an inquisitive gaze.

-Sorry to interrupt -the woman said, her tone polite but firm. -I'm Clara, your new neighbor. I wanted to introduce myself and, well, I've noticed some strange things.

Ana frowned, feeling an inexplicable tension in the air.

-Strange things?

The woman glanced subtly toward the house.

-I saw a car driving around here a couple of nights ago. I don't want to alarm you, but I thought you should know.

A chill ran down Ana's spine.

-Thanks for letting me know. I'll keep an eye out.

When Clara left, Adrien appeared behind Ana, noticing the concern on her face.

-Is everything okay?

Ana nodded slowly, but her unease was evident.

-It's just the neighbor. She said she's seen some strange things around here.

Adrien frowned, his protective instinct immediately kicking in.

-What exactly did she say?

-She saw a car circling the area at night. It's not that unusual, but I don't know, it makes me nervous.

Adrien's expression hardened, his posture straightening.

-Has anything like this happened before?

Ana shook her head but then hesitated.

-Months ago, a man came looking for information about me. I didn't think much of it then because I assumed it was a mistake but now

Adrien stepped closer, his face serious.

-We can't ignore this, Ana. It might be someone causing trouble. Maybe your family or even someone connected to me.

Ana's eyes filled with growing fear.

-What do we do?

Adrien walked over to the window, pulling the curtain slightly aside to look out at the street. Everything seemed calm, but he knew appearances could be deceiving.

-First, I'll keep watch tonight. See if anyone comes back. Tomorrow, I'll talk to the local police, see if they've recorded any suspicious activity in the area.

Ana watched him silently, noticing how naturally Adrien assumed the role of protector. It filled her with a mix of warmth and vulnerability.

-Thank you -she finally said, her voice barely audible.

Adrien turned to her, softening his expression.

-You don't have to thank me. We're in this together.

A noise from Luca's room interrupted their moment. Ana and Adrien rushed to the bedroom. Luca was sitting up in bed, his eyes half-closed and his breathing unsteady.

-Luca! -Ana exclaimed, rushing to his side.

-I had a bad dream -the boy murmured, stretching his arms toward his mother.

Adrien sat on the other side of the bed, placing a comforting hand on Luca's shoulder.

-It was just a dream, champ. We're here, and nothing bad is going to happen to you.

Luca slowly nodded, but his small eyes fixed on Adrien.

-Are you staying here with us? -he asked, his voice trembling.

Adrien looked at him tenderly, his heart tightening.

-Of course I am. I'm not going anywhere.

Ana felt a lump in her throat as she watched the bond forming between them. For a moment, she allowed herself to believe that, despite everything, they could move forward as a family.

As Luca settled back into Ana's arms, Adrien sat quietly beside them. Yet in his mind, Clara's words kept echoing. Something wasn't right, and he would do whatever it took to protect them.

When night finally fell and the house was silent, Adrien decided to stay awake in the living room. His eyes repeatedly shifted to the window, alert to any movement.

The air felt heavy, filled with unanswered questions and unknown dangers. But deep down, Adrien knew he wasn't willing to lose Ana and Luca again, not after finding them once more.
###chapter 59: Jhon's Shadow
The dawn brought a heavy, tense atmosphere. Adrien had stayed up all night, watching every movement from the window of the small apartment. Although he hadn't seen anything suspicious, his instincts told him something was about to happen.

Ana, on the other hand, tried to remain calm for Luca's sake. Adrien's presence in the house gave her a sense of security, but she couldn't ignore the unease Clara's warning had planted.

-I'm going out for a moment -Adrien announced as he put on his jacket.

Ana looked at him from the kitchen, where she was preparing breakfast.

-Where are you going?

-I just want to take a walk around the neighborhood. See if I notice anything unusual. I won't be long.

-Be careful -she replied, her voice heavy with concern.

Adrien nodded and left the apartment. He walked along the quiet streets, observing every corner, every parked car, every face that passed by. Then he saw him: a tall, elegant man dressed in a perfectly tailored black suit, standing next to a dark car at the end of the street. Adrien recognized him instantly. It was Jhon, his mother's assistant.

Adrien's blood ran cold. He clenched his fists and walked toward him with determined steps.

-What are you doing here, Jhon? -he asked, his voice full of restrained fury.

Jhon didn't seem surprised. He gave a small smile and adjusted his glasses.

-Adrien, what a coincidence running into you here.

-Don't play games with me. I saw you lurking around this house last night. Why are you watching us?

Jhon sighed and crossed his arms.

-It's nothing personal, Adrien. Your mother is worried. She wants to make sure you're okay.

-Worried? -Adrien let out a bitter laugh. -Is that how she shows it? Sending someone to spy on me instead of just calling?

-You know how she is. She prefers to handle things her way.

Adrien stepped closer, his gaze intense.

-Tell her I don't need her protection or her attempts to control me. I'm here for my son and Ana. I don't want her interfering.

Jhon raised his hands in a gesture of calm.

-I understand, Adrien. But you should know she won't stop. She's convinced this situation isn't good for you.

Adrien gritted his teeth, trying to contain his anger.

-Tell her that if she truly cares, she should stay away. This has nothing to do with her.

Jhon observed him for a moment, as if he wanted to say something more, but finally nodded.

-I'll relay your message. But be careful, Adrien. Don't underestimate your mother.

Without waiting for a response, Jhon got into the car and drove away, leaving Adrien consumed by a growing sense of unease.

When he returned to the apartment, Ana greeted him with a worried look.

-What happened? -she asked.

Adrien took off his jacket and tossed it on the sofa.

-It was Jhon, my mother's assistant. She sent him here to keep an eye on us.

Ana frowned, crossing her arms.

-Why would she do that?

-Because she can't accept that I've made my own decisions. She always needs to control everything, even when she has no right to.

Ana looked at him silently for a moment, noticing the mix of frustration and sadness on his face. Finally, she stepped closer and placed a hand on his arm.

-You're not alone in this, Adrien. Whatever it is, we'll face it together.

Adrien nodded, grateful for her words. But deep down, he knew this was only the beginning. If his mother was involved, things were bound to get more complicated.

In Paris, winter wrapped the city in its icy air and gray skies. Mateo, who usually filled Margaret's apartment with laughter and curious questions, was quieter than ever. His small figure remained slumped by the window, staring at the horizon as if waiting for Adrien to appear suddenly.

-Mateo, sweetheart, come eat something -Margaret called from the kitchen, trying to sound cheerful.

-I'm not hungry, Mom -the boy replied without moving, his voice subdued.

Margaret set down the plate she was holding and walked over to him. She knelt beside him, wrapping an arm around his small shoulders.

-What's wrong, my love? Why are you so sad?

Mateo looked up, his big eyes brimming with tears.

-I miss Adrien. He promised he'd come back soon, but it's been a long time. Why hasn't he called?

Margaret's heart tightened at the sight of her son's anguish. She knew Adrien was going through something important in Argentina, but she couldn't explain it to Mateo without worrying him further.

-He loves you very much, Mateo. And I'm sure he's thinking about you all the time.

Mateo wiped his tears with the back of his hand, but his sadness remained.

-Why can't I go find him? If he's far away, maybe he doesn't know how to come back.

Margaret swallowed hard. She needed help, someone who could distract Mateo and bring some joy to his life while Adrien was away. After thinking for a moment, she picked up her phone and dialed a number she didn't expect to use.

-Lorenzo?

A deep voice answered on the other end of the line.

-Margaret, what a surprise. Is everything okay?

-I need a favor, Lorenzo -she said, her tone showing more vulnerability than she intended. -It's Mateo. He's very sad because Adrien isn't here, and I don't know how to help him.

There was a brief silence before Lorenzo spoke.

-Do you want me to stop by?

Margaret sighed in relief at his willingness.

-Yes, please. He loves you so much, and I think seeing you would do him good.

-I'll be there in an hour -Lorenzo replied and hung up.

Margaret returned to Mateo's side and kissed his head.

-Sweetheart, someone special is coming to see you.

-Adrien? -Mateo asked, hopeful.

Margaret shook her head gently, trying not to break his heart.

-No, but it's someone who loves you very much.

When Lorenzo arrived, Mateo ran to him with open arms, seeking comfort in his presence. Lorenzo lifted him into the air and made him laugh with one of his playful remarks, momentarily easing the boy's sadness.

Margaret watched the scene from a distance, grateful for the temporary relief. But deep down, she knew that until Adrien returned, a part of Mateo would remain incomplete.
Capítulo 60: A Bond Unbreakable
  
Mateo was glowing with happiness when he saw Lorenzo arrive at the house. Since Adrien had to travel to Argentina, the boy had been quieter and sadder, but today something seemed to have changed. When he saw Lorenzo standing in the doorway, his eyes lit up, and he ran toward him without hesitation.

-Tío Lorenzo! -exclaimed Mateo as he stretched out his little arms toward him.

Lorenzo smiled widely and lifted him into his arms with an ease that reflected how much he had come to care for the boy during all this time.

-Hi, champ! -he replied, hugging him tightly. -How are you?

-Good! -Mateo said, almost unable to contain his excitement. -I missed you so much, Uncle!

Margaret watched from the kitchen threshold with a slight smile, relieved to see her son regain a bit of his energy. It hadn't been easy for him to understand why Adrien wasn't around, and although she knew it was best for him at that moment, she couldn't help but feel that the sadness was overwhelming him more than she could bear.

-How's everything, Margaret? -Lorenzo asked as he saw her. -How are things going?

-Hi, Lorenzo -she answered, although her voice showed a bit of fatigue. -Nothing new around here... just the routine.

Lorenzo nodded, understanding the implications of her response. He knew that things hadn't been easy for Margaret, and even less so for Mateo, who had been patiently waiting for Adrien to return. However, today the situation seemed different. Mateo's eyes were shining brighter than ever when he saw Lorenzo, and that gave him hope.

-What do you say we play for a while? -suggested Lorenzo as he gently set Mateo down. -I know you like board games. Would you like that?

The boy nodded immediately, running toward the cabinet where he kept the games. His enthusiasm was palpable, and finally, after days of sadness, it seemed like his heart was beginning to heal a little.

Margaret approached them, looked at Mateo, and then at Lorenzo. Even though she knew things wouldn't be easy, there was something in the way he treated her son that gave her some peace.

-Sure, why not? -she said with a shy smile as she joined them.

The afternoon passed with laughter and games. Mateo, at last, seemed to be the cheerful and energetic child he once was, thanks to Lorenzo's company. The atmosphere, although still heavy with the absence of Adrien, was filled with simple moments of joy. The hours passed quickly, and as the three of them played, Margaret observed with a mixture of gratitude and melancholy.

At one point, Lorenzo leaned toward Margaret, lowering his voice so Mateo wouldn't hear.

-How's Adrien? -Lorenzo asked, with a look of concern. -You haven't told me anything about him lately.

Margaret looked at him, knowing that Lorenzo wasn't asking for details, just for his well-being. But even so, those words made her pause.

-He's... in Argentina -she answered, almost in a whisper. -Recovering. He's been through a lot, but he's fine. It's still not easy, Lorenzo... for either of us.

Lorenzo nodded, understanding what that meant. He knew the situation wasn't easy for anyone, but especially for Margaret, who had to handle everything without knowing if her best friend would be there when it was all over.

-I know... and Mateo misses him a lot -Lorenzo said, looking at the boy who was now more focused on his game than ever. -But remember, you're not alone, Margaret. I'm here for whatever you need.

A knot formed in Margaret's stomach when she heard those words. Although she had always trusted Lorenzo, the depth of his support touched her in a different way. She knew she couldn't expect him to solve everything, but he would always be there for her, as a constant presence, a shoulder to lean on.

-Thank you, Lorenzo -she said, with a grateful smile, but one also filled with emotion. -I don't know what I'd do without you.

The atmosphere filled with a quiet silence as the three of them continued to play. In the background, Margaret allowed herself to feel that, despite everything, things were going to get better. She wasn't alone. Although she didn't know how or when, there was something inside her that told her the pieces of the puzzle of her life would finally start to fall into place.

As the minutes passed, Margaret watched from a distance as Lorenzo and Mateo shared more laughs and moments of complicity. The bond between them was undeniable. Lorenzo treated Mateo with a tenderness that only someone who truly loved him could offer, and seeing that genuine relationship made her feel strange, as if something was slipping inside her, mixing conflicting emotions.

As she watched Lorenzo lean over to help Mateo place a piece of the game correctly, a sense of warmth filled Margaret, but also a deep unease. What if I told him the truth? she wondered. What if now, after all this time, he knew who I really am?

It wasn't an idea she liked. She knew that, sooner or later, she would have to tell him the truth about her, about Mateo, about everything that had happened in the past. But at that moment, just the thought of revealing to Lorenzo that Mateo was his son -his biological son- terrified her. After all, how would he react when he found out that, instead of being the friend and colleague he had known, she was the woman who had been hiding such a big secret?

She watched as Lorenzo smiled at Mateo, giving him a little nudge while they both tried to finish the game.

He's so good with him, thought Margaret, feeling a pang in her chest. At that moment, she understood that the affection Lorenzo felt for Mateo wasn't just that of a pampering uncle, but of someone who had truly come to love him, who had built a relationship with him. And even though Mateo didn't know anything, that relationship was as solid as that of a father and a son.

What would happen if I told him the truth? How would he take the news that Mateo was his biological son? Margaret had already felt it inside her: something in Lorenzo would change, maybe not in the way he treated her, but certainly in how he treated Mateo, and that was what terrified her. If Mateo found out that his real father was Lorenzo, how would it affect the relationship they had built, that special bond that had formed so naturally?

What if I distance myself from him forever? she wondered, as her mind filled with doubts. What if, because of everything that happened in the past, Lorenzo distances himself from Mateo?

Margaret took a deep breath, feeling the pressure in her chest increase with every thought. She didn't want that to happen. She had fought too hard for Mateo to grow up in a home full of love and protection, even when she couldn't give him everything a child needed. And now that Lorenzo was in their lives, she felt safer, but also more vulnerable. There were times when she forgot the secrets of the past, but when she saw the close relationship that was developing between Lorenzo and Mateo, it all reminded her that she couldn't keep hiding the truth forever.

Lorenzo turned toward her with a smile, unaware that her thoughts had led her to a crossroads of complex emotions. She smiled at him, but inside, she was torn between what she felt and what she should do. If I told him the truth, could we still be friends? Could I bear to see his reaction to the revelation of my son?

-Everything okay, Margaret? -Lorenzo asked, noticing she had become lost in thought.

Margaret quickly nodded, trying to shake off the anxiety that had overtaken her.

-Yeah, sure. I was just thinking... how fast Mateo grows -she replied, although her words were as unconvincing as her smile. -It seems like every day he does something new.

Lorenzo laughed softly, oblivious to the unease Margaret hadn't managed to hide.

-It's incredible how fast they grow, isn't it? -he said, looking at Mateo, who was completely absorbed in the game. -It feels like yesterday he was a baby, and now here he is, mastering all those board games.

Margaret gave him a nostalgic look, and once again, a flood of thoughts filled her. What if I told him now? she asked herself, and this time, the words seemed closer to coming out of her lips. But she stopped. She didn't want everything she had built until now to come crashing down. She didn't want to lose Lorenzo, although she knew that keeping the secret was causing her pain she couldn't avoid.

-I know -she finally answered, trying to stay calm. -He's a very bright boy.

Lorenzo looked at her, as if waiting for her to say more, but Margaret just smiled and turned her attention back to Mateo, who was asking for help with a more complicated move.

Maybe it's better to wait a little longer, Margaret thought, although the weight of her secret felt heavier with each passing second.
###chapter 61: A Day to Remember
The sun shone warmly in the clear Parisian sky as Margaret, Lorenzo, and Mateo strolled through the cobblestone streets, enjoying an afternoon filled with laughter and adventures. They had spent hours exploring hidden corners of the city Margaret had never shown anyone, visiting local bakeries to try sweets, walking through parks, and taking photos together. Lorenzo had done everything possible to keep Mateo in a good mood-and he had succeeded.

Mateo ran ahead, eager to show Lorenzo one of his favorite spots: a small pond in the park where he liked to feed the ducks.

- Lorenzo, come quick! There's a huge one! - shouted the boy, pointing excitedly.

- I'm coming, champ, don't worry - Lorenzo replied, laughing as he followed the little one.

Margaret stayed behind, watching them with a mix of tenderness and nostalgia. Seeing Lorenzo so close to Mateo made her heart race. The image of them together was so natural, as if they had always been father and son.

When they sat on the grass by the pond, Mateo took a piece of bread from the bag they carried and started throwing it to the ducks.

- Lorenzo, do you like ducks? - Mateo asked with a serious expression.

- I love them. But I think you love them more - Lorenzo replied, winking.

- Yes. When I grow up, I want to have a pond with lots of ducks in the garden - the boy declared firmly.

- And I'll be the first to help you build it - Lorenzo promised, ruffling his hair.

Margaret smiled, though doubts began to pile up in her mind. Should she tell Lorenzo that Mateo was his son? Should she confess the truth about her identity as Amelia? For years, she had kept the secret, convinced it was for the best, but now, seeing the connection Lorenzo had with Mateo, she was starting to question everything.

As the sun began to set, Lorenzo stood and extended a hand to Mateo.

- How about we get some ice cream before heading home?

- Yes, ice cream! - Mateo exclaimed, jumping with joy.

They walked together to a nearby ice cream shop, where Mateo chose his favorite flavor while Lorenzo and Margaret opted for something simpler. They sat at a table by the window, savoring the moment.

When they returned to the apartment, Mateo was so happy he couldn't stop talking about the day they had. He sat on the floor with his toys while Lorenzo and Margaret watched him from the sofa.

- Lorenzo - the boy suddenly said, looking up.

- Yes, champ?

- Can you stay tonight? I want us to have a sleepover - Mateo asked, his eyes bright with excitement.

Lorenzo glanced at Margaret, seeking her approval. She smiled and nodded.

- Of course, I'd love to - Lorenzo replied, smiling as Mateo clapped with excitement.

After setting up an improvised "sleepover" in the living room, with cushions and blankets spread everywhere, Mateo finally fell asleep, exhausted from the day. Lorenzo and Margaret sat together on the sofa, watching the boy sleep.

- It's incredible how much this little one means to me - Lorenzo said softly, his gaze fixed on Mateo. - I don't know how to explain it, but I feel like I'd do anything for him.

Margaret looked at him, her heart torn between love and guilt.

- I know, Lorenzo. You're very important to him - she replied, trying to keep her voice steady.

Lorenzo turned to her, his dark eyes reflecting a sincerity that disarmed her.

- Margaret, I want you to know I'll always be here for you both. Mateo, you you're the most important thing to me. My feelings are real.

Silence filled the space for a moment until Lorenzo leaned in slowly toward her. Margaret didn't move, and when their lips met, it felt as if her entire world had stopped. For an instant, she allowed the kiss to happen, pushing aside her fears and doubts.

However, when they pulled apart, a tear rolled down her cheek. Lorenzo looked at her with concern.

- Are you okay?

- Yes - she murmured, nodding. - It's just that I don't know if I deserve all this.

Lorenzo gently took her hand.

- Of course, you deserve it, Margaret. You're an incredible woman, and no matter what happens, I'll always be by your side.

She wanted to believe him, wanted to let herself be carried away by the moment, but in her mind, the truth she had kept hidden for so long still echoed.

Silence filled the room after Lorenzo's words as they remained seated on the sofa. Margaret tried to control the whirlwind of emotions churning inside her. She looked at Mateo, peacefully asleep among the blankets, then at Lorenzo, who still held her hand gently.

- Lorenzo - she began, her voice laden with insecurity, but she stopped, unable to continue.

- What is it? - he asked, leaning in slightly, his eyes reflecting genuine concern.

Margaret looked away, unable to face him directly.

- It's nothing - she finally replied, forcing a weak smile. - It's just been a long day.

Lorenzo seemed to hesitate for a moment but eventually nodded.

- I understand. Maybe we should rest. Tomorrow's another day.

He stood up, picking up a pillow and blanket from the floor.

- I can stay here on the couch - he added, preparing to spend the night there.

- It's not necessary. There's a spare room - Margaret said, pointing toward the hallway.

- Are you sure? I don't want to intrude.

- Of course. Mateo will be happy knowing you slept comfortably.

Lorenzo smiled gratefully and took his things, heading to the room. Before entering, he stopped and glanced back at Margaret.

- Thank you for letting me be here. It means a lot to me.

- You don't have to thank me - she replied, maintaining a calm facade.

When Lorenzo disappeared into the room, Margaret let out a deep sigh. She sat next to Mateo, gently stroking his hair.

- My little one, what am I going to do? - she whispered, as if the boy could answer her.

Memories hit her hard. She thought of the moments she had shared with Lorenzo in the past, of how she had dreamed of building a family with him before everything fell apart. Now, seeing them together, seeing the natural bond between him and Mateo, filled her heart with love but also with guilt.

"What if I tell him the truth?" she thought to herself. "What if I tell him Mateo is his son? What if I confess that Margaret doesn't really exist-that I'm Amelia?"

She buried her face in her hands, trying to calm her mind. There were too many "what ifs," too many risks. Lorenzo had shown interest in being part of their lives, but would he still feel the same if he knew the whole truth?

Margaret turned off the living room lights, leaving only a small lamp on next to the sofa. As she tucked the blankets around Mateo, she glanced toward the hallway where Lorenzo rested.

She couldn't deny it: seeing him with Mateo filled her with hope, but also with fear. Fear that everything might fall apart, fear that Lorenzo wouldn't forgive her for keeping something so important from him.

She lay down beside Mateo, seeking some peace amidst her thoughts. But even as she closed her eyes, the questions continued to linger in her mind.
