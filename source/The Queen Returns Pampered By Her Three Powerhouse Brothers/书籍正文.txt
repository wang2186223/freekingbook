###Chapter 1 Kicked Out Of Home
Nicolas Kirk's hand trembled as he flung the bowl at Rylie Kirk's feet, the crash ringing out across the room. Blood stained his lips while fury contorted his face. "How could you do such a thing? What kind of sister would wish harm on her own brother?" he said,his words splintered by a violent cough. "I should've listened to Stacey. She warned me about the poison!"


Rylie's expression flickered as she looked down at the ruined medicine, disappointment shadowing her features. "I keep telling you, Nicolas, there's nothing deadly in the medicine. It contains an ingredient that purges the old blood, which you need if you ever want to recover," said Rylie. Watching the medicine soak into the carpet, she winced inwardly, knowing how much effort and money she had poured into finding the right remedy for her eldest brother.


Stacey Kirk, the adopted daughter of the Kirk family, stood at Nicolas' side, her arms wrapped protectively around the medical text that she always carried.She raised her voice, tears prickling at her eyes. "Please,Rylie, just stop making excuses. Leland ran tests on your concoction, and the results were dangerous. It's full of toxins!"


Cold skepticism crossed Rylie's face as she met Stacey's gaze. "You complete fool," Rylie said."There isn't a medicine in this world that's entirely safe, especially not for what Nicolas is suffering from. The only way to fight back is with a powerful dose. Thee's nothing mild that could work on him."


Stacey could barely contain her tears, her voice quivering as she pleaded with Rylie, "He's spitting up blood right in front of us, and you're still insisting this is the only way? We're just medical students, Rylie,not miracle workers. Don't put your pride above Nicolas' life."



Taking a shaky step toward Rylie, Stacey continued,her words thick with emotion, "I found a well-known specialist. He's already written a prescription that might actually save Nicolas. Admit you were wrong and let us try. Please."


Nicolas doubled over, hacking up blood,and fixed Rylie with a glare that burned with outrage. "It wasn't enough that you fed me that mystery medicine, now you turn on Stacey too? If you had even a fraction of her compassion, things wouldn't have come to this,"Nicolas snapped. "Apologize to her,right now!"


Rylie straightened her shoulders and faced Nicolas with an unflinching stare. "All I ever wanted was to help you. I have done nothing that warrants an apology.I owe her nothing."


Desperation twisted Nicolas' features as he scrambled to his feet, snatching a whip from the wall in a blind rage. "That's it! You're going to push me into an early grave! Why can't you ever listen?" he shouted. "Get out! I don't want you here!"


Before the whip could lash out, Rylie shifted away,nimble and unafraid. From the upper landing,someone's measured steps echoed, and a battered backpack landed at her toes.
Leland Kirk, her second brother, stood at the base of the stairs. His tone cut through the air. "Let's lay it out plainly. You're just an outsider, and Stacey is our true sibling. We've kept this secret for your sake,hoping you wouldn't resent her, but today, we see just how cruel you can be. If you refuse to admit your mistakes, pack your things. We'll announce Stacey as our one and only/ sister. Your fortune goes with your name - you'll have to go back to your birth family and live as they do."


Such a threat didn't faze Rylie. Years of living in the Kirk household had worn down her patience.However, the revelation that she was not bound to them by blood came almost as a blessing. HHer chest felt unburdened, lighter than it had in years. There was no need to waste any more of her knowledge or talent on a house that never valued her.


The thought had struck her as odd - she always wondered why she stood out among siblings who never seemed to measure up.


"That suits me just fine." Rylie's voice held not a hint of regret. With quick fingers, she snatched up the backpack, plucked a candy from the bowl, and let it dissolve on her tongue as she strode for the door.


Left in the hallway, Stacey could not hold back a grin of satisfaction. Five years of plotting had finally paid off. With Rylie gone, she would be the Kirk family's prized daughter, adored and indulged by her brothers.


Still, she could not resist a final performance. She darted after Rylie, her voice ringing out. "Rylie! Don't leave like this! You'll always have a place here!Please, don't make me feel like the villain. I'm begging you!"


Nicolas interjected sharply, "Enough, Stacey! Let her go. A heart as cold as hers belongs to her own impoverished family. She never deserved this home."


A cold laugh escaped Rylie when she overheard him.Was everyone in the Kirk family so easily fooled? Did they genuinely believe that it was sheer luck that had brought Nicolas back to health, gotten him out of bed, and made him able to walk again? Without her hands and her medicine, they'd see soon enough just how far good fortune could take him.


Drawing the hood over her head, Rylie let the breeze whip strands of hair across her vivid lips, a flicker of scorn glinting in her eyes.







Far away, inside the bustling capital city of Kouhron,the imposing Owen Mansion stood as a symbol of influence and wealth.


Within that opulent hall, Kendrick Owen struck his ornate cane against the marble floor. "You all promised she'd been located. Why is she still not here?"



Arrayed around him stood his three grandsons-each a commanding presence in his own right, men whose names carried enough weight that even the highest government officials paid their respects.


Yet, despite their stature, the shadow of their missing youngest sister dimmed their confidence, and their faces bore deep lines of worry.


"Our search stalled in Crolens. According to the latest report, she spent some years in a mountain village, but after being trafficked, her whereabouts vanished fromn every record."


Agony creased Kendrick's expression. "For eighteen years, that child has been gone. Imagine the hardships she's endured in a place like that."


"Grandfather, there's been progress. One of the kidnappers came forward and claimed she was later sold to a rich woman in Crolens. We only need a bit more time-her discovery is within reach."


Relief softened Kendrick's features. No trace of irritation remained as he rose from his chair,hope radiating from his gaze, "In that case, let's not delay.I'm comng with you. We'll search together."
###Chapter 2 Versatile Rylie
A heavy backpack slung over her shoulder, Rylie walked out of the Kirk residence without a backward glance, heading directly to the parking lot where her prized,limited-edition motorcycle waited.


Years of downplaying her skills and masking her sharpness for the sake of the Kirk family's fragile peace were finally behind her. Freedom now tasted real.


Down the city streets, her motorcycle roared, slicing through the afternoon air until she arrived at the imposing entrance of a gated community near a military compound.


At the checkpoint, security protocols ran tight as always, but the instant Rylie's motorcycle appeared,the guard broke into a broad smile and opened the gate wide. "Miss Kirk, your visits are always a welcome surprise." With a practiced motion, Rylie flipped up her visor and gave a polite nod.


Inside, cherry blossom petals scented the breeze,and several retired officers meandered beneath the blooming trees. Spotting her approach, they made their way over.


"Look who's back- Rylie, I was just about to see you. I've run out of those pills you mixed up for me last time."



Her motorcycle came to a halt as she peeled off her helmet, her gentle features drawing nods of approval. "You can swing by the clinic tomorrow. I'll be here all day if you need a refill."


Catching sight of another familiar face, she gestured toward an elderly man still sporting a neck brace."As for you, I've told you before that brace is only maing things worse for your neck."


An embarrassed grin spread across his face as he removed the brace. "Would you at least allow me to try a few easy exercises?"
"Take it slow, and don't do anything reckless," said Rylie, stepping inside an apartment building.


Long ago, her connection to this community began unexpectedly. During a visit to the Military General Hospital to buy medicine, she had encountered an elderly man suffering from epilepsy. With a prescription that targeted his condition at the root,she gave him relief that no other doctor had managed.


That stranger turned out to be a celebrated, now-retired clinical specialist. Awed by Rylie's abilities, he insisted on calling her his savior and offered her an apartment in the community as thanks.①


Easy rapport filled the community, and its prime location made life peaceful and convenient. In time,Rylie had come to see this place as the home that she had always needed.


As soon as shestepped inside her apartment, lights flickered on and a soft, familiar mechanical voice greeted her. "Welcome home, Rylie. You've been gone for three days. There are two encrypted oicemails waiting, your email inbox has new messages, and your bath is ready."


Her backpack landed with a thud on the floor,sending the zipper flying open. A thick bundle of cash spilled out, scattering across the entryway.


She stared at the pile of bills, guessing that it must total around ten grand. The sound that escaped her lips was half a chuckle, half a sneer. Was that really all the Kirks thought she was worth, tossing money her way like she was some beggar?


"Play my messages," she said.


Britton Davies' voice filled the room first, recorded late the previous evening.


"Hey, Rylie, registration for the relay's almost up -two practice runs down already! Are you honestly still clinging to the Kirks? For real? I've béen wiping the floor with Phillip these past few days!"


A slight arch in her brow gave away her recognition.


Phillip Kirk, her third brother, ran one of the most exclusive racing clubs in the world, churning out champions and stacking up prize money.Long nights spent behind the wheel were her secret, pushing his team to one victory after another. Yet each season,as the finals approached, Phillip would swap her out for Stacey,handing over the glory and the gold.Year after year, her skills powered their success, but when the spotlight appeared, Stacey was ushered in for the celebration, leaving Rylie invisible to the crowd.


Trophies meant little to her. In those days, protecting her family's ego mattered more. But now...


A grin spread across her face as she called Britton."I want half of the prize money."


Whatever disappointment Britton had felt vanished at once. "Done! Phillip's team doesn't scare me. I've mapped out every move they make, but when you're behind the wheel, nobody can keep up. I never lose to him, Rylie-I always lose to you!"


A small laugh escaped Rylie as she let out a soft sigh. "You've noticed it too. Funny how obvious it is,but they still manage to overlook everything I do."
Curiosity lit Britton's voice as he switched topics. "By the way, something else came up. There's been chatter on the dark wveb about the Owen family-the wealthiest folks in Kouhron. Word is,they're here in Crolens, searching for their missing daughter and throwing around serious money for information.Think we should get involved?"


Without hesitation, Rylie answered, "No interest.have finals coming up, so I'll pass. See you."


On Britton's end, confusion crept in. Of all the reasons to bail, exams were the last thing that he would expect from Rylie. As far as he could recall,she never even showed up for tests. The truth was,she was the one who wrote them.
###Chapter 3 Invitation
Rylie moved on to the next voicemail, which turned out to be from Rory Carter, one of the most respected physicians at the Military General Hospital.


A note of flattery colored Rory's tone as he spoke."Rylie, I'm really in a bind. One of my old friend's sons has battled a rare illness for years, and his health is declining again. Those special pills you provided aren't helping him any longer. Is there any chance you could stop by and take a look?"


Pulling out her phone, Rylie dialed him back."I'll come to the clinic after classes tomorrow evening.Tell him to swing by then."


Rory cut in with an apologetic sigh, saying, "He's stuck in the VIP wing at the hospital, and strict protocols mean he can't leave."


Drumming her fingers on the tabletop, Rylie pressed for details. "Enough stalling, Rory. Who's the patient?"


After a pause, Rory's voice dropped to a whisper,saying, "It's Brad Morgan. Yes, the grandson of General Sean Morgan. This isn't just any case-the Morgans have discreetly reached out to top doctors nationwide. They're offering twenty million dollars to anyone who can cure him."


An arched eyebrow was all the reaction Rylie gave.The Morgan family was legendary, led by Sean Morgan, a formidable general. He was a man even the President deferred to.


The name Brad Morgan brought back memories-she remembered reading about him in the news.Only thirty and already hailed as the youngest admiral of his era, his string of military victories made headlines everywhere.


That revelation puzzled Rylie. Something could actually bring down a man like Brad?


Her next move was to check her encrypted contract inbox, and sure enough, there sat an official invitation from the National Healthcare Department.


Working under the codename "Healing Hand" on the dark web, she had built a reputation for tackling medical mysteries, and eventually gathered an elite team of her own. It seemed natural that the government would come looking for her.


Keeping her composure, Rylie responded, "I see the message. That reward would tempt anyone. I'll take the case."


Meanwhile, word of the Morgan family's urgent call reached the Kirks as well. Leland sprang into action,already strategizing and dialing contacts in hopes of getting their foot in the door.


Always just out of reach of the upper society, the Kirk family saw this as their shot. Healing Brad would mean acceptance into the highest social circles at last.



Another rumor had set the city abuzz: the wealthiest family in Kouhron landed in Crolens, promising a mind-blowing sum to anyone who could lead them to their missing daughter. People all across town had dropped everything, desperate for a piece of the reward.







The next day.


The shrill ring of her phone yanked Rylie from sleep.She stretched and dragged herself out of bed.


On the other end was Timothy Powell-her research advisor- barely masking his irritation. "Rylie! I told you to handle the data organization, but you're nowhere in sight. Are you trying to get yourself kicked out of my research group? Stacey was here right at dawn. I expect you here immediately!"


She offered no answer, choosing instead to end the call and glance at the clock.


The digits read ten o'clock.


Her mind flashed back to the previous night. Lost in old medical texts, she'd worked long hours sorting through ancient prescriptions, and now she had t overslept, letting Timothy's task slip her mind.


A yawn escaped as she flipped open her laptop, sent off a quick email, and hurried to get ready.Backpack in tow, shestepped out the door.


Her motorcycle zipped through city streets until she pulled up in front of the university lab. After finding a spot, she strode toward the entrance.


She pulled out her pass and swiped it, only to watch the screen blink and flash a denial-her access had been revoked.


At that moment, the lab doors swung open and out came Stacey, flanked by two upperclassmen from the research team.



A mocking smile twisted one guy's lips as he spotted her dilemma. "So, Rylie, you think you're special?Turning up late, ditching your work -looks like you finally pushed Professor Powell too far. Lab access is locked, and your days here are over!"
###Chapter 4 I'mExpelling You
Stacey tugged at the man's sleeve and said with a hint of grievance, "Rylie was late because she was in a bad mood. You should go and plead with Professor Powell on her behalf. If she's kicked out of this project, how will she maintain her reputation at school? No professor would risk taking her on, and she'd never graduate."


Even as she spoke, excitement flickered in Stacey's eyes, barely masked by her sympathetic tone. The prospect of Rylie's downfall was almost too delicious to hide. If Rylie really got expelled, surely she would have no choice but to come back pleading.


But the scene didn't play out the way Stacey had hoped. Rylie's answer was bluunt and left no room for argument. "That's perfect. I never intended to stick around. I'm out of the project. I already sent my withdrawal report to Professor Powell this morning.Tell him to approve it."
Her trip here wasn't for the team-it was to collect her carefully developed Nexo-7 compound,the key ingredient that she had been growing for months for a rare genetic remedy.


Stacey's face faltered at that. "You're quitting the group?"


Without missing a beat, Rylie nodded and stepped past them, but Stacey's grip shot out, latching onto her wrist.



"Please don't let impulse get the better of you, Rylie!We're nearly done with this phase, and the medical competition's coming up. This isn't just about you-there's a team counting on you! You can't just walk away."


The man cast Stacey a critical look. "You shouldn't give her special treatment just because you're related,Stacey."


Rylie turned her gaze on Stacey, arching a brow. "Is your concern for me genuine, or is this just another act?"
"Absolutely, I am really concerned," Stacey insisted,nodding eagerly.


The urge to laugh nearly escaped Rylie, her tone laced with derision. "Be serious. You've seen what your team can do even with my help- and it's not much. Six months, and you haven't achieved a thing.You're all lost causes, so of course I'm leaving."


Everything about the research group's progress came down to Rylie-her organization, her direction,her experimental designs. Without her, Timothy's grand ambitions in clinical medicine and Al were just wishful thinking. The others fumbled through experiments, never getting close to real breakthroughs.


With a dismissive snort, Rylie reached out and tapped Stacey's cheek, her words cold. "Don't fool yourself. You're not family, and I'm not here to babysit incompetence in the lab."


A surge of tears filled Stacey's eyes, her voice tight with shock. Ever since Rylie had been shown the door at home, she had turned into someone  at most unrecognizable - brazen, stubborn, completely unwilling to listen. It drove Stacey mad.


"Rylie! Don't flatter yourself - the research doesn't revolve around you.You wouldn't even be part of this team if Stacey hadn't vouched for you in the first place!" Patience snapping, the man lunged at Rylie,intending to shove her aside.


But Rylie moved first, gripping his wrist and twisting it sharply.


"Ah!" A cry of pain erupted from him as he doubled over, hand clutching his now-dislocated arm,disbelief written all over his face.


Rylie merely dusted off her hands and shot the group a cold glance. "Aren't you all future doctors? Surely setting a joint isn't beyond your skills."


Without wasting another word, she brushed past them, entered the lab through the open doors, and collected her prized compound. While inside, she fed the latest core Al research notes into the shredder,ensuring that her work would not be stolen. Moments later, Rylie stepped back out,vial in hand,just as Timothy stormed into the hallway.


One glance at the scene - a student whimpering,the others shaken - and Timothy's anger boiled over. He jabbed a finger at Rylie. "You're always scraping by in class, using the lab for naps, and now you're assaulting your own teammates? Do you honestly believe my research team has any need for someone like you? From now on, you're no longer a member of the team! And I-"



Growing impatient, Rylie interjected, "Didn't you read my email? I already sent in my resignation."


Timothy hesitated, then fumbled for his phone and scanned his inbox. Sure enough, there was Rylie's formal withdrawal. He scoffed, shaking his head as if the idea was ridiculous, "You must be out of your mind, Rylie. Do you know how many students would kill for a place on my team? Let me make this clear:you don't get to quit- I'm expelling you. I'll post the official notice on the university website for everyone to see."
Timothy had expected her to back down, maybe beg for another chance. But he had clearly misjudged her resolve.


Rylie shrugged, tossing out a dismissive, "Whatever,"and was halfway out the door when sudden shouts erupted nearby.


A frantic voice cut through the noise. "Somebody just collapsed!"


Instinct overriding her exit, Rylie pivoted toward the commotion. A small knot of medical students clustered around the person sprawled on the floor.She wasted no time barking instructions. "Give him space-don't crowd, let some air in."


These were all medical students, and certainly, they knew this knowledge. Immediately, they stepped back, forming a loose circle.


Dropping to one knee, Rylie sized up the unconscious man. His face, pale but striking, caught her attention for only a second before her hands moved to assess his condition. Her fingers quickly found his trachea - shifted, not where it should be.She was about to examine his chest when Timothy charged onto the scene, voice booming. "Out of the way! Let me through!"


Without hesitating, Rylie grabbed her portable medical kit, but Timothy shouted at her, "You have no business treating anyone! You're just an inexperienced student, not a doctor!"


Stacey hustled over, siding with Timothy. "Rylie,listen to Professor Powell. If something goes wrong,it's on you. He's the expert here, not you."
###Chapter 5 Anything But Ordinary
Rylie ignored Timothy and Stacey and busied herself with the medical kit. She took out a decompression needle, felt the patient's chest, and unbuttoned his shirt to prepare for the procedure.



Her calm defiance caught Timothy's eye, prompting him to step directly in her path. "Look at him.-clammy skin, ghostly complexion, and he collapsed in this sweltering heat. This is textbook heatstroke,maybe worsened by heart trouble. The right call is CPR. Bring him back that way!"


Stacey didn't waste a moment piling on. "Rylie, for once, just do as Professor Powell says.You nearly killed Nicolas with the wrong medicine yesterday.If you keep going like this, you'll end up in court!"


With Stacey stirring things up, murmurs rippled through the crowd. Hidden among the onlookers,some of Stacey's friends chimed in about Rylie's supposed poor grades, spreading doubt and fanning resentment.



At the edge of the crowd, a team from the nearby bio-research institute took notice and started moving closer.



Rylie's expression chilled as she seized Timothy's hands, halting his attempt at chest compressions."This man's not drawing a single breath, and his trachea's off-center. He's got a tension pneumothorax. If you start CPR now, you'll just make things worse."


Such a challenge to his expertise - especially in front of his students - left Timothy red-faced. Yet,several research group members rallied around him,echoing his diagnosis.


"Rylie, stop spreading nonsense. Professor Powell's the expert here, not you!"


Unfazed, Rylie shook off Timothy's grasp, disinfected her instruments, and replied, "Cold sweats, pallor,collapse - pneumothorax can look just like
heatstroke. Butif you bother to check for a shifted trachea or a drum-like chest, you'll see the difference. Guess that's lost on a quack."


Her sharp words prompted a few medical students to lean in and study the patient themselves, curiosity overtaking their doubt.


"It looks like Rylie's diagnosis holds up," one student admitted, and Timothy's expression turned even grimmer.


Back. straight and voice steady, Timothy retorted,"You're nothing more than a glorified assistant who just files paperwork, yet you think you're an expert? If you can revive him with that needle, the mentor's chair is yours!"


Rylie didn't waste another word. She finished sterilizing,deftly inserted the decompression needle,and with a sharp hiss, trapped air rushed out. Color crept back into the patient's face as his breathing returned at once.


"She was right all along! He had a pneumothorax!" a student shouted, awe coloring every word.


Recognition dawned across the faces in the room as those with medical training pieced together what had just happened - Timothy's assessment had been mistaken.



One student voiced what everyone was thinking. "If Rylie hadn't stood her ground and Professor Powell had pushed on with CPR, we would have had a disaster on our hands."



Even so, Timothy scrambled for justification."Well...you've all misunderstood me. I actually recognized it was pneumothorax all along."


In an attempt to salvage his authority, he looked down at Rylie and the group, adding, "My intention was only to test Rylie. She has a reputation for cutting corners, after all."


Before she could get a word out, the patient-still weak,yet now radiating a quiet power-interrupted from the floor. "Did you risk my life just to prove a point with your student? That hardly qualifies you as a doctor,let alone a teacher."


Despite his lingering frailty, this man rose, his commanding presence impossible to ignore. Those striking features, combined with an unmistakable force of will, made Rylie sense that his identity was anything butordinary.



She regarded him calmly and gave a simple instruction. "Save your strength and let the campus hospital run further tests."


The man nodded and, with a hoarse voice, said to Timothy, "You should apologize to my savior."


When he heard this, Timothy's composure slipped."Excuse me? What did you just say?"


Not missing her chance to gain approval, Stacey chimed in quickly, "Rylie, Professor Powell's intentions were good. He cares about your growth. A kind teacher like him shouldn't have to apologize."


A sharp retort cut through the crowd. "And why shouldn't he?" The voice belonged to the dean, who had just arrived with several white-coated physicians in tow.


All eyes shifted as the dean hurried to the patient's side, bowing in recognition. "Mr. Owen, we're so sorry for this incident. You shouldn't have had to experience this chaos. Please, let us escort you to our facility for a proper check-up."


The name Owen rang out in Rylie's mind. She remembered hearing about the powerful family from Kouhron searching for their lost sibling. The gravity and presence this man carried left her with little doubt-she was looking at a member of that very family.


A team of doctors quickly appeared with a wheelchair,helping Felix Owen settle in. Despite their urgency, Felix stayed put, his presence radiating icy authority as he leveled his gaze. "Offer her an apology," he said, voice sharp as steel.


Any harm to an Owen family member on campus would have spelled disaster for the school. Sweat gathered on the dean's brow as he spun towardTimothy, his voice sharp. "You will apologize to Rylie right now! Do you value your position here or not?"


Surrounded by witnesses and cornered by the dean's command, Timothy could do nothing but lower his head. "I was wrong, Rylie. I apologize," he said,each word heavy with reluctant humiliation.


Anger simmered in Timothy's eyes even as he spoke.His fists clenched, and inwardly, he promised himself that Rylie would pay for this humiliation one day.



Packing her vial away, Rylie was just about to leave when Felix stopped her with a call.


He pressed a carved wooden token into her hand."This is an Owen family token-redeemable for any favor. If you ever run into trouble or need something,just call the number on the back. Whatever you ask,it's yours."



The gesture gave Rylie pause. Recognizing its weight,she quietly.accepted the token.


Once Felix was wheeled off under the dean's watchful eye, murmurs spread among the students nearby. "So that's why there were luxury cars lining the parking lot this morning. Looks like the Owen family really is here, searching for their lost daughter."


Shock rippled through the group. "Wait, are you saying their missing daughter is somewhere on campus? Who could it be?"


A shrug and a whisper followed, answering, "Nobody knows for sure. I just heard they traced her here."
###Chapter 6 Nexo-7
With the students now scattered, Timothy leveled a cold glare at Rylie. "You've really crossed the line this time. You're officially done with my research group.Expect a written notice soon."



She met his words with a casual shrug, wondering if this meant that she was finally free.



But it appeared that fate had other plans - no sooner had she stepped away than another obstacle emerged.



A woman appeared from the shadows, eyes locked not on Rylie but on the glowing vial in her hand."That's Nexo-7, isn't it?!"



Rylie studied the slender glass vial she carried.Swirling inside, the pale blue liquid shimmered faintly."You're right. That's what it is. Is there a reason you ask?"
A tremor of excitement crept into the woman's voice.

"You made it yourself? How did you manage that?"


Rylie offered a simple answer, barely interested."I just followed standard protocol."


The woman's enthusiasm only grew. Clutching Rylie's wrist, she continued, "I've spent three years trying to perfect this formula - lost count of my failed attempts and ran out of materials ages ago.Can you look at my records and tell me where I went wrong? I really need Nexo-7 for my research!"①


Word around the institute was that Brad, the youngest Morgan, was battling a rare genetic illness,and only Nexo-7 could ease his suffering. For most,producing such a compound without flaws was nearly impossible - tiny miscalculations could ruin everything. Yet the sample in Rylie's hand was pristine, the envy of any chemist. The woman knew that landing this compound could mean both scientific acclaim and a massive payout.



Rylie's frown deepened, though her voice stayed even. "There's nothing mysterious about it. All it
takes is precise ratios and following instructions to the letter."



The woman refused to back down. She whipped out a business card, thrusting it toward Rylie. "I'm Vivian Estrada, from the Biomedical Research Institute next door. Join my lab! I'll get your work into leading journals, let you spearhead your own project, and you'll have every resource you need - bonuses included!"



Hearing the name "Vivian Estrada," Stacey stiffened,her eyes narrowing in disbelief. Ofall people, Vivian - an internationally acclaimed scientist from the Biomedical Research Institute - was suddenly focused on Rylie, all because of a single vial of compound? It was maddening.


A new strategy formed in Stacey's mind. She slipped into a wounded, delicate act and leaned in,murmuring, "Professor Estrada, that compound actually came from our lab's group work. Rylie took it without getting approval from our teammates or instructor."
Vivian's eyebrows shot up as she scrutinized Stacey and her companions. "Is that so? Are you saying this student isn't the one who produced it?"



The man from earlier jumped at the opportunity to add, "Exactly. Rylie did help, but Stacey did most of the work - she's always here first and leaves last.She managed all the data, every experiment,and honestly, if Nexo-7 was made in our lab, i's thanks to her efforts."



With a show of humility, Stacey let a gentle smile play across her lips. "Please, it was just teamwork.I was only doing what | could."


Seeing which way the wind was blowing, Timothy didn't hesitate to add his own endorsement."Stacey's our star, the backbone of the whole team.Rylie, on the other hand, rarely pulls her weight and won't even bother keeping up with the lab notes."


Rylie scoffed, cold amusement flickering across her face. She had no interest in fighting for credit and simply turned to leave.
Vivian barely waited for Rylie to step away before pulling Stacey aside. "If that's true,then come with me now. We'll try to reproduce Nexo-7 in my lab. If you manage it, every offer I made to her stands for you too."


A fleeting gleam of satisfaction danced in Stacey's eyes,though outwardly she wore nothing but humble composure."Thank you,Professor Estrada. I promise to give it everything I have," she replied, bowing her head with demure grace.


Her gaze tracked Rylie's retreat, an inner smirk flickering behind her polite expression. Surely synthesizing a compound couldn't be that complicated. She'd already memorized Rylie's process in secret - heat, stir, toss in the catalyst.Rylie could strut all she wanted, but in the end, she,Stacey, would have the last laugh.


Later that day, Rylie faced two more final exams. She breezed through each in under thirty minutes,handing in her papers and leaving the room ahead of everyone else. Curious glances and quiet sneers
followed her; classmates assumed that she must have filled her sheets with guesswork, as always.


Let them talk. Rylie barely noticed their judgment.In truth, she could ace those tests without breaking a sweat. Once, she had deliberately tanked her grades to help Stacey's reputation, but those days were over.



Not wasting a moment, Rylie revved up her motorcycle and sped away from campus, making her way to Aetheris Pharmacy - a name whispered in elite circles, famous for its exclusivity.


She carried Nexo-7 with her as she pushed openthe glass door framed in gold. A subtle blend of herbal and high-end perfume scents greeted her.


Sunlight flooded a spacious lobby, where a dazzling crystal chandelier hung from the soaring ceiling,fracturing the light into thousands of shimmering stars.


If not for the faint scent of medicine in the air, a stranger might have mistaken the space for an

upscale boutique or a five-star hotel.


With confidence in her step, Rylie made for the counter - only to cross paths with Leland as he emerged from a side hallway.


A scowl darkened Leland's face the moment he spotted her. "Shouldn't you be sitting your freshman finals right now? Why are you here? Are you following me? Do you even realize what kind of place this is?Leave before you cause trouble!"


Rylie met his hostility with a dramatic eye roll. "Don't flatter yourself. I didn't follow you here."


Leland's words came out cold, dripping with contempt. "If you're going to make up stories,at least try something plausible. What business would a freshman possibly have at Aetheris Pharmacy?There's no way you're getting past the front desk without a VIP card. Be honest-did you really trail me here just to beg me for help, hoping I would persuade Nicolas to take you back? Let me save you the trouble. You're not setting foot in the Kirk family residence again until you own up to everything you
did wrong."
###Chapter 7 Leland's Accusation
Rylie couldn't help thinking that the Kirk family had lost touch with reality. She slipped past Leland,making her way toward the pharmacy entrance,only for him to step in frontof her and block her path.


A firm grip on her arm stopped her progress as Leland warned, "You don't belong here. Stirring up trouble with these powerful people could land the Kirk family in hot water."


From a car idling nearby, a young woman leaned out the window, her eyes trained on Leland. "Did you get what I asked for, Mr. Kirk? Your brother doesn't have time to waste."



Reluctantly, Leland let go of Rylie's arm, tossed a final warning her way, and headed off toward the waiting car.


Rylie's eyes fell on the medicine he clutched, and despite knowing that she was overstepping, her
conscience won out. "If you care about Nicolas, don't give him that. It'll do more harm than good."


A cold voice shot back from the car window, "You're just a child. Our pharmacy's reputation is built on generations of trust. If Mr. Kirk doubts us, he's free to walk away."


Wasting no time, Leland hustled to the car,apologized profusely, then whipped around and snapped at Rylie. "Nicolas's health only went downhill because of your so-called cure. Stacey searched everywhere for a Wilde family doctor, and thanks to their connections, we finally got medicine from Aetheris! Keep spreading lies, and I'll see to it you're banned from Crolens for good."②


Tires squealed as the car sped off, leaving Rylie standing alone. She simply shrugged. She'd spoken her truth-whether they listened was no longer her problem.


Stepping inside the pharmacy, Rylie was greeted by a respectful bow from the pharmacist. "Miss Kirk,welcome."

With a casual air, Rylie set her compound on the desk. "Freddy, make sure this is prepped safely. Tag it at three million. Put it up for sale."


A spark of excitement lit Freddy Turner's eyes. "This batch looks phenomenal.First time you've made this,isn't it? Word is the Morgan family has been searching everywhere for Nexo-7. They were even here yesterday."


Rylie shook her head. "Hadn't heard. I just managed to finish a batch today. Use it for whatever prescriptions you need."


After a brief pause, Rylie added, "And another thing - revoke Leland's VIP privileges. From now on, he pays full price for everything here, no exceptions."


A satisfied grin spread across Freddy's face. "I've been wanting to say that myself. Every year,you pour money into the Kirk family, buying premium supplements and smoothing their path, yet they never once value what you do."


Preparing to take the medicine downstairs, Freddy paused, turning back with a thought. "Almost forgot -Ms. Hobbes is next door again, handing out free consultations and grabbing extra supplies."


Rylie dismissed it with a flick of her hand. "Let her do as she pleases. Don't charge for it. Call it charity."


She was halfway to the door when it swung open once more, and two imposing officers in military dress strode inside, medals gleaming on their chests.


In a flash, they made their way to the counter.here for Nexo-7-do you have any?"


As they spotted the viaI in Freddy's hand, both officers' eyes widened. They wasted no time flashing their credentiaIs. "This is for the Morgan family. We need to buy that Nexo-7 immediately."


Freddy set the price without hesitation. "Three million. It'll be ready for pickup in two days."


A note of panic entered one officer's voice. "That won't do-Mr. Morgan can't wait that long. We need it right now; it's urgent."
Rylie guessed that Brad must be critically ill. With so many invitations sent out, no doctor could save him?


Rory's desperate call echoed in her memory. Rylie stepped in, her tone direct. "You can't administer Nexo-7 straight away. It's toxic in its current form and needs special processing first."


Desperation colored the officer's reply, saying,"We don't have time-this is a life-or-death emergency!"


After a quick calculation, Rylie made her decision."Freddy, box up the Nexo-7. I'll go with them and oversee the preparation myself."


Freddy gave a brisk nod. "Understood, Miss Kirk."


The officers shot each other uncertain glances,clearly taken aback by how deferential Freddy was to Rylie. One let out a disbelieving snort. "You can't be serious. What's a kid like you going to do for us? Why not send out someone with real authority?"


Judging by Rylie's youthful appearance, neither man expected her to offer anything remotely useful.
###Chapter 8 Would You Risk Everything On My Word

Rylie shot the officer a glare and said, "You waste precious time while Mr. Morgan's life hangs by a thread! Will you answer forit if he dies?"


Reluctance was written all over their faces as the two officers guided her into the patrol car and set off toward the Morgan estate.


Standing at the end of a long drive, the Morgan residence towered with a stately presence. Pillars lined the broad porch, their details catching the afternoon light.


Inside, Rylie trailed behind the officers through the hushed hallway. They led her straight to an elevator,and together, they descended below the main floor.


Light poured from a dazzling crystal chandelier when the elevator doors slid open. A crowd of the most skilled doctors in the world filled the room, each one gathered anxiously at Brad's doorway.


Brad's illness had struck so hard that even the experts were left bewildered, their only hope now the arrival of the Nexo-7 compound.


The second Sean spotted the familiar uniforms, he hurried to meet them and asked, "Is the compound with you?"


Stepping aside to let her through, one officer pointed Rylie out and said, "She brought it. The compound is with her."



Stepping forward in haste, Evita Wilde, the head of the Wilde family-a leading medical family,reached for the medicine in Rylie's grasp. "Hand over the Nexo-7.I'll take charge of Mr. Morgan's care."


Avoiding her reach with ease, Rylie took a measured step back and answered, "Nexo-7 in its pure form is dangerously unstable. No one else here can administer it safely." Startled faces turned her way. A smirk tugged at Evita's lips as she said, "You expect us to believe a courier knows more about Nexo-7 than I do? Let me tell you-I'm Crolens' top doctor. Don't make a fool of yourself in front of me. Give it to me."



Evita possessed unmatched expertise in handling the compound, or so she believed. She had sourced it herself from Aetheris Pharmacy, but every trial had yielded only a diluted version. That lesser medicine offered Brad little relief, but with the pure vial now in sight, Evita saw a chance for personal glory.


With a nod, Evita directed her apprentice, Yosef Bates, to seize the vial. Yosef lunged for it, but Rylie caught his wrist and, in one motion, delivered a sharp kick to his knee.



Pain shot through him, and Yosef crumpled to the floor, his cry echoing through the tense crowd. Rage flashed across Evita's features as she retorted, "Who do you think you are, assaulting my apprentice like that?"  Ignoring Evita altogether, Rylie shifted her focus to Sean,who wore the crisp lines of a military uniform,and said, "If the Wilde family insists on taking the medicine, so be it, but I want it clear that whatever happens to Brad will not fall on Aetheris Pharmacy.I must remind you - this vial contains pure Nexo-7,not some diluted substitute. Handle it without my expertise, and you may as well sign Brad's death certificate."



Before anyone could respond, an officer moved.up beside Sean and quietly relayed what he had learned about Rylie's treatment by the pharmacist at Aetheris Pharmacy.


Whispers rippled through the onlookers - everyone had heard the stories about the true owner of Aetheris Pharmacy, a shadowy master chemist called "Healing Hand" on the dark web, yet the woman standing before them seemed far too youthful for such a reputation.



Sean could not bring himself to accept the idea that Rylie might be Healing Hand herself. Still, there was a
commanding certainty about her, and if she had learned from Healing Hand, it would fit. After taking a moment to consider, he addressed the room, saying,"Is anyone present willing to absolutely guarantee my grandson's survival after this drug is given? Step up if you are."


Without delay, Evita strode forward,joined by several ambitious doctors from the crowd.


Sean met their show of confidence with a warning,his voice like steel as he said, "If you make a mistake,and my grandson suffers for it, you will not leave this estate alive."


His threat left every doctor visibly rattled. The severity of Brad's illness was no secret, and even the smallest error could end his life. No one in their rigght mind wanted that kind of responsibility.


Evita, usually brimming with confidence, found herself faltering. Memories af the Morgan family's unforgiving ways pricked at her nerves. She tried to hide her unease and replied, "Mr. Morgan, it's not that we lack the skill, but your words cast doubt on the Wilde family's reputation. With a case this complicated, no one can guarantee a recovery.Retract your threat, or there's nothing more I can do -Brad will not make it to morning."


Taking a step closer, Rylie looked Sean in the eye and declared, "Let me handle it. I'm willing to stake my life on this."


Sean studied her in silence, measuring her resolve,and finally said, "Very well. You have my respect."


Getting ready to treat Brad, Rylie approached his room. Evita, unwilling to let go of her skepticism,feigned concern and responded, "You've been warned, Mr. Morgan. She's hardly older than a student. Entrusting your grandson to her is as good as giving up hope."


A sharp glance from Sean cut Evita off, his words cold and unyielding. "You, at your age, lack the resolve of thisyoung woman. Either hold your tongue or leave at once."



That silenced Evita. Her shoulders stiffened, and she bit back any retort, swallowing her pride in the heavy silence.



Rylie then crossed the threshold and stepped into Brad's bedroom.①


Darkness filed every corner of the chamber, the walls pressing in from all sides. As the door shut behind her, silence swallowed the outside world and the sound of labored breathing filled the air.②


Moving cautiously, Rylie advanced a few steps and her foot nudged something across the floor-a syringe. Glancing down, she recognized it as a sedative among a sea of empty painkiller bottles strewn across the floor.①


Making her way through the clutter, she carefully avoided the glass and plastic as she headed for the bed. Meanwhile, Sean monitored the room's interior from a distant screen, marveling at how easily she moved in the pitch black. He remarked, "It's as if this girl can see in the dark."


Drawing near the four-poster bed, Rylie could see thick iron chains stretching from each corner,anchoring the limbs of a powerfully built man curled tight in agony.


Iron chains shackled Brad's hands and feet, his upper body half bare, his hair partially covering his eyes. Pain twisted his body, leaving him drenched in sweat.



Perching on the mattress, Rylie let her hand hover before gently touching Brad's arm. Instantly, he recoiled, jerking violently against the restraints like an animal fighting capture.


Steel links rattled loudly as Brad strained against them, the metal biting into his raw skin. His ragged breaths came fast, his eyes flickered with both fear and warning-ready to lash out.


With a voice scraped raw, Brad shouted, "Stay away from me!"



Rylie didn't back down, instead gently placing her hand on his arm, feeling the heat radiating from his skin. Her manner stayed composed and unwavering as she assured him, saying, "Brad, I haven't come to harm you. I'm here to help."


Despair clouded his face. "No one can help.If you stay, I'll lose control. You'll be hurt."


Stillness and pain kept Brad's body tense, his eyes swimming with misery.


Choosing not to force him, Rylie simply inched closer, her voice steady as she analyzed his suffering. "You're facing a rare disorder. It brings sensitivity to light, muscle spasms, and wild movements. Early on, the pain is·sharp and numbness sets in. As it advances, the nerves stiffen,losing all flexibility. Eventually, there's total paralysis and every sense fades away. Nexo-7 can slow the damage, but nothing can erase it entirely."


Iron links jangled as Brad pulled himself upright. The heat of his breath lingered near Rylie while he fixed her with a scathing glare and said, "You've figured all this out and you still want to throw your life away?" Unfazed, Rylie answered, "Maybe everyone else believes there's no cure, but I've never met an illness that could defeat me."


Tilting her chin, she locked eyes with him, her gaze unwavering even in the pitch-black room.


Brad's body had endured so much torment, yet the lines of his face remained unspoiled - his brow strong, every feature almost impossibly well-formed.


"You'll see morning because I say so," Rylie said with conviction. "Mr. Morgan, would you risk everything on my word? If I fail to pull you through, I'll put my own life on the line."
###Chapter 9 Our Paths Will Cross Again




Never before had Brad met a doctor who radiated such composure and fearless resolve, especially one of Rylie's age. Silence stretched between them before he finally said, "Alright, let's see what happens."


A sense of trust took root-his grandfather would not have let her near unless he believed that she could pull off the impossible. If she failed, Brad had already accepted his fate.


Fromn her bag, Rylie drew out a small vial, hands steady as she measured out the antidote. She took Brad's arm, swabbed the skin, and explained, "This first shot is an alkaline agent. It's the only thing that can offset the pure Nexo-7. You should know, the pain will get worse before it gets better."


With only a short nod, Brad replied, "Go ahead."


Needle poised, Rylie eased the medicine into his vein, watching the liquid disappear into his bloodstream.


For a brief moment, Brad's reaction was mild - a tense jaw, a quickened breath. The calm didn't last.Heat ignited in his nerves, rigid tension locking his body as if fire raged under his skin.


A low cry escaped him, teeth grinding as cold sweat dotted his brow. Desperation twisted his hands into the sheets, and the chains quaked under the strain,seconds from snapping apart.


The agony crashed over him, wave after wave. Each gasp came faster, raw and jagged, as he pitched forward, dropping to the floor in a wild bid to escape the pain by slamming his head against the floor.②


Recognizing the signs, Rylie slid down beside him and caught his head before he could hurt himself,tucking it safely against her shoulder.


"Don't try to knock yourself senseless before the medicine works," she said, her words half-muffled in the chaos.
Lost in the storm of pain, Brad breathed in her scent -a trace of lilies that seemed to calm his heart even as his body rebelled.


Instinct guided his movements as he clung to her,arms wrapped tight as if only she could keep him anchored.


Rylie stayed still, letting him hold on, her chest tight with each breath. With a gentle touch, she rubbed his back and spoke close to his ear. "The worst will pass. Just a little longer."


Minutes slipped away before Brad's breaths finally found a steady rhythm, and the trembling in his limbs eased. Even as he clung to Rylie, she simply stayed by his side, offering quiet presence until his senses fully returned.


A gentle voice broke the silence. "Are you feeling any better?"


With slow reluctance, Brad released his hold and looked up at her, his gaze a tangle of gratitude and confusion.Though his skin was still drained of color, the agony had melted away, leaving a flicker of something new behind his eyes.


A hoarse whisper escaped him. "You've won," he admitted, relief threading through his words. For the first time in hours, the pain no longer ruled him.


A hint of a smile touched Rylie's lips. "Didn't I promise you'd make it till morning?"


The antidote, potent and pure, did its work at astonishing speed. With a flick, Rylie turned on the lights. Brad's instinct was to squeeze his eyes shut-until he soon realized that his sensitivity to light had vanished. By the time he blinked in surprise and tried to focus on Rylie, she was already slipping out the door.



The second she stepped outside, the Morgan medical staff swept in, crowding around Brad for a quick check. After a flurry of examination, one doctor hurried off to update Sean. "Mr. Brad Morgan is stable. The new medicine is highly effective. It should last for a while!"
The news landed like a punch to Evita's gut. Her heart sank as she listened, convinced that Rylie had exaggerated the antidote's dangers just to drive up her price.


Frustration burned in Evita's eyes as she watched Rylie disappear down the hall. Leaning close to her apprentice, she muttered, "Follow her and find out the one behind this. I want to know who dares steal credit from me."


Sean's demeanor shifted as he approached Rylie,offering her a check and new respect. "Here's your payment for today. I hope you'll return soon to assess my grandson's progress."


The amount - ten million - left Rylie more than satisfied as she pocketed the check. Just as she was about to leave, Sean called after her, "Young lady,what's your name? Where can I find you? Tell me how to send for you next time."


Rylie simply answered, "I'll come when you need me," before turning on her heel and vanishing down the hall.
One by one, the celebrated specialists were dismissed, their services no longer required.


Brad's next awakening felt different-he noticed a surprising lightness in his body, as though a great weight had been lifted.


Settled at his bedside, Sean watched him with quiet worry."Are you feeling any better, Brad?"


With a gentle nod, Brad settled back, then asked in a hushed tone, "Where did she go?"


Sean looked puzzled. "Who do you mean?"


A faint crease appeared on Brad's brow."The young doctor. Didn't you ask her to stay?"


Realization dawned across Sean's face. "Ah, the miracle worker. She promised to return. The Aetheris Pharmacy sent her, so she's likely one of their doctors. She's a gutsy one, that's for sure."


Brad, catching the lingering scent of lilies, allowed a small smile to break through. Softly, he murmured,"She truly risked everything to save me."
The sight caught Sean off guard. It was the first smile Brad had shown since falling ill, and relief mingled with wonder on the older man's face.


Sean squeezed his shoulder and gave his word,saying, "I'll see you well agan, Brad. And if you've taken a liking to that young woman, I can make sure she returns."


"There's no need for that, Grandpa," Brad replied,shaking his head as the smile faded from his lips."I'm sure our paths will cross again."






With the Morgan mansion fading behind her, Rylie found herself wandering through the lively streets of Crolens' night market, searching for something to eat. There, in the thick of the crowd, she stumbled upon Selah Hobbes,


Taking a seat beside her old mentor, Rylie watched Selah tend to a line of patients at her makeshift stall and bought herself a glossy candy apple. "Why are you running this roadside clinic again?" she asked, a note of weary affection in her voice. "Freddy said you were working at the little pharmacy this morning.Now you've set up shop clear across town after dark."


Rylie's earliest memories of Selah dated back to when she was just eight. Wandering from place to place, Selah had treated whoever needed help-and she had been Rylie's very first teacher in the healing arts.


Years had slipped away, but Selah's determination to help the vulnerable never changed.


Mixing herbs for a patient, Selah shot her a wry smile. "What else can I do? Folks without money have nowhere else to go. Hospitals turn simple problems into life-threatening crises with their endless delays."


As she greeted a middle-aged woman in line, Rylie said, "Dinner's done for me, so let me lend a hand.When we wrap up here, I'll take you home myself."


The woman took a seat, her hands nervously pressing against her throat. "Doctors at VitaLink say l have malignant lymphoma," she replied. "They want to cut out the tumor and start chemo right away. My son's wedding is coming up next month-I have to be there. Please, is there any chance for me to recover without surgery?"


Without a word, Rylie accepted the stack of X-rays and medical papers. Her brow creased as she pored over the test results.


Anxiety welled up in the woman's eyes as she caught sight'of Rylie's frown. "So it's hopeless, isn't it?" she asked, voice trembling. "They want me to have surgery, but I could never afford the high cost. What should I do?"


As she studied the test results, Rylie paused,fingers gently probing the woman's neck. "These records don't even look like they're from the same patient.Ma'am, are you certain these belong to you? No chance they got mixed up?"


The woman quickly nodded, worry etched deep in her face. "Yes, I'm certain. Just these scattered scans and medications have drained almost twenty thousand from me already."


Dropping her hands to her lap, Rylie spoke with quiet certainty. "There's no sign of a tumor."


Shock flickered in the woman's eyes. "What did you just say?"

###Chapter 10 Fiancé





Rylie scribbled a brief prescription, handing it to the woman with a reassuring nod. "You're only dealing with some swollen lymph nodes from a common cold. Take these anti-inflammatories for a few days.If it were really a tumor, your lymph nodes would be hard, much larger, and you'd be feeling pain or other symptoms,right?"


The woman's relief was obvious as she nodded enthusiastically. "I feel just fine! A free checkup at a local clinic told me something was wrong and sent me to VitaLink for more tests. That's what got me so anxious!"


Rylie's brows knitted in concern, "No surgery is needed here. Just stick with the medicine l've given you and you'll be fine."


Once she'd seen the last patients off and the market had emptied, Selah packed up the last of her supplies and walked beside Rylie into the night.


On their way home, Selah's anger bubbled over. "You know, the doctors at VitaLink are notorious for this-they exaggerate minor problems, scare people,and push them into expensive surgeries, eventhough,in fact, a couple of dollars' worth of pills would fix most of it. They just keep wringing every penny out of the patients - even the poor are their targets. I've watched it happen over and over, and it makes my blood boil."①


Rylie's expression darkened. "I share some of the blame."



Everyone knew that VitaLink Hospital operated under the Wilde family's control, and Rylie's school was deeply connected. Several college deans even held leadership positions there.


Leland, after med school, joined VitaLink's staff.Through his ties, Rylie had done many for the Wildes - granting them rare medications, pulling strings at Aetheris Pharmacy, and even arranging for famous doctors to consult at their hospital. Those favors fueled the Wildes' reputation as Crolens' top medical family, bringing prestige and a steady flood of new patients to VitaLink.


Knowing all this, Selah gave Rylie's hand a gentle squeeze. "You have to fix this, Rylie. The Wildes can't be allowed to use your influence to make money by hurting innocent people."


Rylie agreed without hesitation. She pulled out her phone and sent a message to a secure contact.


Her text was blunt: "Publish a statement on the dark web from Aetheris Pharmacy and Healing Hand: The Wilde family is guilty of greed and malpractice,endangering lives for profit. Aetheris Pharmacy is severing all ties with them. From now on, anyone connected to the Wildes is considered an enemy."


A reply landed within seconds."Understood."


The announcement spread like wildfire across the dark web. Everyone knew the unmatched power behind Aetheris Pharmacy-especially with Healing Hand's reputation. Nobody dared cross them. The Wilde family's downfall was all but sealed.


Sensing opportunity, rival families rushed to fill the void, eager to claim the resources and status that the Wildes were about to lose.



Rylie and Selah made their way through the lively city streets, weaving between stalls and laughter until they finally paused before a modest, unassuming pharmacy.



Not far from the imposing Aetheris Pharmacy,HaloFlow Pharmacy operated with quiet persistence,its shelves stocked thanks to Aetheris funding. Even as midnight approached, a steady stream of patients slipped in and out beneath its flickering sign.


Once Selah was safely home, Rylie headed back to the military compound, unaware of the pair of eyes watching from the shadows.


Tucked in a dark corner, a stranger snapped photos of the little pharmacy, sending each one off to Evita along with a running report. Rage twisted Evita's features as she read the message. "Now I see why our numbers are tanking.Some dried-up hag is siphoning off my business,keeping people from signing up for surgery."


Yosef chimed in, a note of triumph in his voice,"That girl and the old woman are partners. They aren't even with Aetheris - they're just selling medicine from HaloFlow right next door."


He didn't stop there; Yosef produced a set of photos and handed them over. "Look. I got some proof."


The second Evita's eyes landed on Selah's face, her expression hardened."So it's her!"


Yosef was quick to catch the shift. "You recognize her?"



Evita's mouth curled with resentment. "She's not just some stranger. Selah and I were rivals in medical school. She always fancied herself the superior doctor, tried to poach my patients, and wound up destroying her own career after a fatal mistake. I had no idea she'd hold a grudge for so long." Her voice sharpened. "No way Rylie could have made that high-purity compound alone. Selah's the one orchestrating things from behind the scenes. Rylie's just her puppet-not even a real member of Aetheris Pharmacy."


"So what's the next move?" Yosef asked.


A cold smile crept across Evita's lips. "If those two nobodies think they can outmaneuver us, they're in for a shock. Send someone to rough up that tiny pharmacy and warn Selah. Then, deliver a phony invitation- if she's so skilled, let's see her treat that Morgan patient all by herself."


Yosef hesitated, uncertainty flickering in his eyes."But there's only one official invitation from the Morgan family."


Evita's glare was cold. "Who said to use the real thing? Forge it. I want her embarrassed beyond repair!"


A wicked grin spread across Yosef's face. "I know exactly what to do."
Their scheming had barely ended when Marsha Wilde burst into the room, panic etched across her features. "Grandma, something awful has happened!"


Evita shot her a look of disapproval. "So much for the 'Genius Healer' title. Is this how you show composure? Get a hold of yourself."


Marsha hurried closer, her voice trembling."Grandma, it's Aetheris Pharmacy. They just went public, cutting all ties with the Wilde family. Anyone who supports us is now their enemy! I tried to buy medicine from them today, and they blocked me instantly! What are we supposed to do?".


The Wilde family owed much of its prestige and profit to the exclusive medicines and technology from Aetheris Pharmacy. People only flocked to them because of this partnership. Now, Aetheris Pharmacy had declared war, and the fallout would be devastating.


Evita's face drained of color as she collapsed back into her chair, panic overtaking her practiced calm.
"How did it come to this? Why would Healing Hand turn against us? I've always treated them with deference-why destroy us now?"


She couldn't bear the thought. With Aetheris Pharmacy's blacklist shutting them out, the Wilde family's future crumbled before her eyes. VitaLink Hospital's hard-earned reputation and steady profits would be wiped away overnight.


"It must be because they caught wind of our schemes," Marsha whispered, near tears. "What are we going to do, Grandma? I can't lose everything!"


With Yosef's support, Evita rose shakily to her feet,fighting to compose herself. "The Owen family's eldest son is still recovering from surgery in our hospital. They're from Kouhron - they won't know what's happening on the dark web. For now, we act as if nothing is amiss. This is our chance to secure an alliance with the Owens for protection, do you understand?"


Images of Felix's striking features flashed through Marsha's mind, helping her regain her composure. "I understand, Grandma."






Exam results day had finally arrived at the school.


Rylie parked her motorcycle and was about to head inside when she noticed a crowd of students gathered on either side of the entrance, their attention riveted on a gleaming silver-gray Panamera.


"That's the brand-new Panamera!" someone whispered in awe. "Costs more than three million. No wonder it's Mr. Dury's car- he's so wealthy!"


Fred Dury emerged from behind the wheel, exuding smug confidence, then circled the car to open the passenger door with a flourish.


Gasps rippled through the crowd. "It's Stacey! I was sure it'd be Rylie!" One girl sounded genuinely shocked, then quickly changed her tune. "But really,who'd want to be paired with that idiot?"


A sharp-eyed student picked Rylie out from the throng, shooting her a look filled with spite.
An amused smile played on Rylie's lips. She nearly forgot that she had a fiancé.


Back when Stacey hadn't yet returned to the Kirk family, Fred was a regular at their home, endlessly inventing ways to curry Rylie's favor.


Their engagement was arranged at Nicolas'insistence, but Rylie never harbored even a shred of fondness for Fred. He lacked integrity, warmth, and sincerity - and his looks weren't even worth comparing to Brad's. As far as Rylie was concerned,Fred was barely a blip on her radar.


Uninterested in either Fred or Stacey, Rylie turned to go, but before she could slip away, Stacey's keen gaze found her. "Rylie!" she called out.
###Chapter 11 The Perfect Partner




With a sharp motion, Stacey pulled away from Fred and darted toward Rylie. Worry and innocence warred across her features as she exclaimed, "Rylie,please don't get the wrong idea! There's nothing between me and Mr. Dury!"①


Instead of backing off, Stacey tried to catch hold of Rylie's hand. Disgust flickered in Rylie's eyes, and she sidestepped the attempt. No contact was made,but Stacey angled herself awkwardly, let herself topple, and cried out, "Ah!" as she hit the ground.


At the sight, Fred's expression turned stormy.Marching up, he helped Stacey to her feet, then faced Rylie and scoffed, "Go ahead and blame me,Rylie. I'm the unfaithful one! If you've got a problem,deal with me. Don't pick on Stacey!"


A sneer crept onto Rylie's lips as she glared right back. "Pick on her? Really, Fred? She threw herself As tears gathered in her eyes, Stacey quickly spoke up. "Fred, it was my own clumsiness. Rylie had nothing to do with it. Please stop saying things like that about her."


Fred stiffened, the sight of Stacey's tears only sharpening his anger. Glaring at Rylie, he barked,"Enough with your excuses! Stacey's not the scheming type! You use your position as the Kirk family's daughter to keep her down. You pretend to be perfect, but you're always failing your exams,holding everyone in your research team back,and pretending to understand research you don't even try to do!"


Her face cool, Rylie refused to let his words sting."Right, Fred. Stacey outshines me in every possible way. If you're so sure, why not call off our engagement and make her your girlfriend for real?Why keep her just a secret lover?"


No detail of Fred's game escaped her. Their engagement still stood, even as he paraded Stacey around. Deep down, everyone knew why: Stacey, an adopted daughter, meant no claim on the Kirk family's money, and Fred wanted more than a pretty face with empty pockets.


Speechless at first, Fred's anger only grew as Rylie revealed the truth. "You're twisting everything!never made Stacey my side piece!" said Fred,struggling to defend himself.


Mocking laughter bubbled from Rylie as she retorted,"Weren't you just confessing that you were the unfaithful one?"


Silence hung for a beat as Fred struggled for a response, prompting Stacey to fill the void, her voice breaking. "Please, Rylie, I'm the one to blame. After Fred found out about your relationships with other people, he began turning to me for comfort. That's how things grew between us. If you need someone to blame,let it be me."


A collective murmur rippled through the crowd."Rylie's relationship with other people?" someone whispered, the rumor catching like wildfire among the students.


Hearing her name dragged through the mud, Rylie's expression turned thunderous. Before Stacey could even move, she stepped up and delivered a sharp slap to Stacey's cheek.


A stunned hush swept over the room, leaving everyone frozen as Stacey staggered, shock and disbelief written across her face.


"How could you strike her!" shouted Fred, face flushed with fury. He lunged at Rylie, only to have his wrist snatched and flung aside with ease. Rylie's foot swept out, catching him just right so that both Fred and Stacey dropped to their knees before her.


All around them, students drew in quick breaths,wide-eyed at a display of power that none had ever witnessed from Rylie before.


While rubbing her wrist, Rylie stared down at the pair,her voice steady and cold. "Every night, I was either locked away at the lab or pushing Phillip's racing career for your sake. Stacey, have you ever stopped to wonder it you were being fair, saying those things?"


Cupping her cheek, Stacey glared at Rylie through her tears, still putting on a sorrowful face. "Whatever you say is true, Rylie. Just please, don't hurt me again and leave Fred out of it."


Never imagining himself sprawled on the ground because of Rylie, Fred needed help from his classmates just to stand.


Pointing a trembling finger, he exclaimed, "You're just a fake heiress who was thrown out. You play at research, but what have you really accomplished?Why doesn't Dr. Vivian Estrada take you in? Why haven't you come first in any exams? Why not win a racing gold medal? After all you've done, why is it always Stacey who comes out on top?"


With a sly twist to her lips, Rylie retorted,"What makes you think I'm not capable of acing the exams or snagging the top awards?"


Determination flashed in her eyes, a silent vow  at most forming that she would reclaim every accolade Stacey had ever taken from her.


Fred leveled a vicious challenge at her. "Go ahead,impress us all - if you manage it, I'll kneel and beg for your forgiveness in front of the whole school! But if you fail, I expect you to crawl around the track for everyone to see and pay for your arrogance."


"Agreed," answered Rylie without missing a beat."There's no need for begging, though. If I win,you can take your turn crawling the track and make your apology right there."


Panic set in for Stacey, and she rushed to intervene."Stop it, Rylie! You'll only drag the Kirk family's name through the mud!"


Giving her a sideways glance, Rylie coolly asked,"Are you willing to put your pride on the line too? Bet on me taking the top spot in the department this year.What do you say?"


Stacey knew that Rylie's real level had always been at the bottom. She was already imagining Rylie crawling in humiliation, but still, she pretended to be reluctant and concerned. "Rylie, I don't want to bet with you. I'm afraid you'll get hurt."


Fred weighed in, eager to see Rylie humbled. "A little lesson might help her tone down that attitude. It'll do her some good,honestly."


A beat of hesitation passed before Stacey lifted her chin and, in a show of devotion, declared, "If I don't outscore her, then I'll accept the loss as mine, too."


Warmth surged through Fred at her words. Where doubt about Stacey's status as an adopted daughter had once held him back, now certainty about her place in the Kirk family erased all hesitation. For the first time, he saw her as the perfect partner.


Taking Stacey's hand, he called out for everyone to hear,"Let every student here serve as witness to our agreement!®


A bitter chuckle left Rylie as she spun on her heel and headed for the school's notice board, a throng of onlookers quickly falling in behind her.
Across the way, a sleek black Bentley sat idle with its door open. An officer was about to step out, but a calm, commanding male voice stopped him. "Hold back, Brock. She can handle herself."


Leaning back against the seat, Brock Hewitt folded his arms and shot a curious look at Brad. "I've never seen you in such high spirits, sir. Guess the legendary doctor's presence really does wonders for your mood."


With a sideways glance, Brad's smmille cooled. "You'd do well to keep your comments to yoursellfi.n


In a flash, Brock mimed sealling his lips, but he only lasted a moment before his curiosity resurfaced."Who would have thought Fred's fiancée and the miracle doctor are one and the same? She's supposed to be the Kirk family's daughter, but lately,there's a storm brewing in that family. The real heiress isn't clear, and if Rylie doesn't belong, people will just write her off as some backwater nobody."


Pausing, Brock's brows knit in confusion. "What puzzles me is this, Mr. Morgan; if Rylie really is the miracle doctor, why would she ruin her own reputation like this? Rumor says she's just a pretty shell-no brains, no heart."


Instead of answering, Brad asked, "Will she come out on top on those exam?"


A thoughtful silence passed before Brock replied with a nod, "She'll do it. If not, you'll have to watch her eat crow in front of the whole school."



Brad's lips twitched into another small smille."We'll know soon enough."


Students packed in tight around the shrouded rankings, hearts pounding as if the announcement was the opening scene of a play.



Feigned sympathy colored Stacey's words as she leaned toward Rylie. "There's still time to back out,Rylie. I could never let you suffer that kind of shame.Just say sorry and let's end this."


A laugh slipped from Rylie, clear and bright. No chance.I'd much rather see you crawling instead,"
As soon as the scores appeared, the entire student body broke into uproar.
###Chapter 12 Accused Of Cheating
At exactly noon, the cloth was swept away with theatrical flair, marking the long-awaited unveiling of the results. The students instinctively parted,stepping aside to allow Rylie, Stacey, and Fred the front row to see the list first.


Fred guided Stacey straight to the bottom of the list,scanning upward with quíck, eager eyes.


When Stacey noticed that Rylie's name wasn't anywhere near the bottom, her heant fluttered with a secret burst of delight. She immediately assumed that Rylie had turned in another blank exam and hadn't even made the rankings.


Squeezing Fred's hand, Stacey tilted her head and said to Rylie with faux concern, her voice soft and dripping with carefully crafted pity, "You're not even at the bottom this time, Rylie, Maybe it's time you stop trying to compete with me,"
Fred gave a smug chuckle. "Looks like you owe me,Rylie. A deal's a deal."


But Rylie's eyes didn't budge from the top of the list."Why don't you check the first part of this list?"


Fred scoffed with disbelief. "Still clinging to your pride,huh?"


Just then, a cluster of students surrounding the top of the list let out startledgasps. "Oh my god! It's Rylie's name!"


"Rylie's ranked first!"


As more voices joined the chorus, confmming what seemed unthinkable, Stacey's face frore "That's not possible!" she snapped, yanking her hand from Fred's and dashing to where those students gathered.


There it was - Rylie's name gleaming in bold letters at the very top, while Stacey's name sat quietly in tenth place. The margin between Rylie and the runner-up was wide enough to leave no doubt-it as at most had been a sweeping victory.


"Impossible!" Fred echoed, trailing after Stacey, his eyes bulging in disbelief. "Rylie must've cheated!"


Rylie arched a brow. "So the moment I come in first,it must be cheating?


Stacey stood frozen. She couldn't fathom Rylie beating her, but rather than launch a direct accusation, she chose a gentler route, her voice lOW and carefully measured, "Fred, Ryllie hrsi wanted one moment to shine, She's already been rejectad by her brothers and carries that weight owery day. Let's just pretend her results are raal, Thore's no mecd to say they weren't earned,"


Her words sounded forgiving, but ānyone páyíng close attention could hear the implication loud and clear-Rylie had cheated.


Among the onlookers were three students who usually held top spots in the rankings. Outraged,they immediately voiced their protests, urging the school to mullity Rylie's results. The cheating rumors spread like wildfire and soon reached the school administration. Rylie, Stacey, and a few others were called into the office for questioning.


The school leaders insisted that parents be contacted to settle the matter, but Rylie calmly responded, "My family's far away. I have no way of reaching them."


Before the principal could reply, Stacey siepped in sweetly. "Please don't worry. I'H call my second brother. Rylie's still part of the Kirk fammily. Sha's just upset.., and made a mistake."


Fred nodded in approval. "You'ne too kind, Stacey.Rylie doesn't deserve to be your sister- not with that spiteful attitude,


Stacey's reply was gentle, her tone polished. "Don't speak about Rylie like that. I know she is a kind gírl ín nature, and I dom"t want her to lose her way."


Leland, who worked nearby at VitaLink Hospital,showed up soon after Stacey's call, carrying a smail neatly boxed strawberry cake.


Stacey accepted the box with a smile, then turned to Rylie. "Rylie, Leland only brought one cake for me.He forgot you liked it too - but I'll share half wth you."


But Leland stepped in, reclaiming the cake and talking to Rylie with open disdain. "s she even worthy of sharing your cake?


Turning to Rylie, Leland's tone grew even colder."Cheating on your exam just to goi back at Stacoy and win my attention? Do you ewon raalize how foolish you're being?


Rylie's expression remained untoadatie y didn't cheat.





"Rylie, you're still lying when the evidence is right there? You're always at the bottom, and Stacey's the one who's done your work for years. All you do is slack off at home, and now we're supposed to believe you miraculously came first? Isn't your motive clear? Just admit what you did and ask your teacherfor leniency. Punishment is better than expulsion."Leland's voice was cold as ice as he added,"Supposedly, this is for your own good-why can't you see that?"


A faint, mocking laugh escaped Rylie. "For my own good? Then why label me a cheater before even investigating?"


Leland's temper snapped. He turned to the principal and Rylie's homeroom teacher. "There's nothing to investigate. Rylie cheated out or jaalouty for Siacoy.She's no longer part of out tamily - do whai you must."



The teacher agreed at once, and wwith ā hiāndfull of words,Rylie was branded a chaater,


Fred said, "So that's why you dared bet with me-you planned to cheat your way to first place! Now that the truth is out, Rylie, it's time to kneel and apologize to Stacey, or pay up."


Leland's brows furrowed. "What bet?"
Stacey quíckly explained, displaying her scratched palm and looking wounded but understanding,"Leland, Rylie didn't push me on purpose- she's just hurt after leaving the family. Fred only made the bet to defend me. It's a silly bet; it shouldn't count."



Fred shook his head. "See, Stacey? You're too soft.That's wwhy you keep getting bullied."


When Leland saw Stacey's scratched lhand, his anger reignited. "Rylie is no longer one of us. The bet stands!"



Now everyone had turned agminat Ryllie, waiting for her humiliation.



But Rylie, calm as ever, pulled out her phone and dialed the school's largest shareholder.



"Rory, there's an issue here. My homeroom teacher and the principal think I cheated. Can wou come deal with it?"



The second he heard Rylie, Rory perked up like a kid.

"Stay put-I'm coming!"
Fred scoffed, "You really think someone will save you now?"



Rylie replied calmly,"You'll see soon enough."


Before Rory could arrive, the dean of the medical school burst into the office and whispered urgently to the principal.


The principal's face went palle. Are you certain?


The dean nodded. "We must look indo Ryl"si Case more.thoroughly.


Clearing his throat, the prncipal molioned for the dean to speak.


The dean addressed the room,"Nor long ago,Rylie saved a critical patient at the research institute.She's made remarkable progress, and her foundation is solid. Accusing her of cheating is mot something we should do lightly."


Leland glared. "There's nothing to investigate. I know my sister-she cheated. Punish her."
The dean didn't even acknowledge him. "Rylie, if you truly believe you're innocent, I have a more challenging test. If you score above eighty percent,we'll know the truth."


Rylie's original plan was to let Roryhandle this, and she hadn't expected that the dean would offer her such a chance to prove herself. But it looked like the dean was doing this under someone's requirement.So, who was behind this? And why did they help her?She didn't know the answer, but she told herself that she couldn't let this chance slip. "Okay, I'd like to try it."
###Chapter 13 Superior To Our Model Solutions
Meeting Stacey's gaze, Rylie raised an eyebrow provocatively. "You're not backing out now, are you?"


A sudden unease twisted within Stacey, as though Rylie had become an unreadable stranger. Still, she answered softly, "If that's what it takes to reassure you, I'm fine going through with it."


With cold detachment, Leland interjected, "Let's see what kind of score you can achieve."


As Rylie seated herself, she lifted her pen calmly,feeling everyone's stares lock onto her every movement.



The dean clicked his stopwatch, while Leland hovered close, his lips curved in scorn as he scanned the test. The complexity of the exam even puzzled him; if Rylie answered a single question correctly, it  would be nothing short of a wonder.


Even Stacey peeked at the questions and found herself completely baffled.


Pretending to be concerned, she prompted a gentle plea. "Rylie, take it easy. We trust you; don't push yourself unnecessarily."


Leland scoffed harshly, "She's just too stubborn to admit the truth. This will finally prove she's a fraud."


Anticipation filled the room, each person awaiting Rylie's inevitable failure. But the atmosphere shifted subtly.


The dean and the teacher began scrutinizing Rylie's answers, their expressions gradually shifting from skepticism to surprise. Stacey, always attuned to subtle shifts, sensed something unusual and tried to distract Rylie again. "Look, Rylie, Fred wasn't someone I wanted to steal from you. There's no reason for resentment.



Annoyed by Rylie's lack of response, Leland  snapped, "Don't ignore Stacey. Didn't anyone teach you basic manners?"


Rylie raised her eyes calmly. "You seem to be the one lacking basic manners. Are you blind? I'm busy here."


"As if it'll matter," Leland retorted.


The medical dean interjected firmly, "Stacey, please hold your comments until after Rylie finishes. There's no reason to interrupt prematurely."


Stacey recoiled slightly, fists tightening at her sides.


The mere thought of Rylie surpassing her filled Stacey with dread - she couldn't·allow such humiliation.


Eventually, time ran out.


The dean, principal, and teacher clustered around Rylie's paper, passing it back and forth, their whispers intense and astonished.



Leland's voice dripped disdain, saying, Her handwriting is barely readable, and her reasoning is muddled. Don't strain yourselves trying to decipher nonsense."



"On the contrary," the dean announced enthusiastically, "Rylie has exceeded expectations.Her answers aren't just correct; they're superior to our model solutions. Honestly, even I would have struggled to score this highly."


A subtle smirk played at Rylie's lips as she watched Stacey and Leland frantically seize the paper, shock rendering them speechless.


Far from illegible, Rylie's writing flowed elegantly across the page, each answer brilliant and clear.Leland was dumbfounded. How had she become this talented without their notice? Wasn't she supposed to be shallow and unremarkable?


Stacey stood frozen, envy surging inside her. When exactly had Rylie grown so incredibly strong?


Realizing that he had been misled, the principal coughed awkwardly, "It's clear now.Rylie earned her perfect score honestly. We owe her an apology and a cleared reputation."


"Those who've wronged Rylie should apologize openly," the dean added.


Immediately switching tone, Stacey exclaimed with forced admiration, "Rylie, you're unbelievable! You've obviously been studying in secret; no wonder you've excelled. And surely you understand that Leland showed up today because he was eager to help you clear your name. You can see how genuinely he cares."



Leland cut in sharply, "Enough. Rylie's beyond understanding simple sentiments like that."


"Oh? Is Leland really that kind?" Rylie retorted scornfully."Spare me the excuses. Just apologize."


Turning toward Fred, Rylie warned him gently, "Don't forget about honoring your bet."


Fred's face flushed with anger."You tricked us, Rylie.Secretly studying to embarrass us and letting everyone believe you were a cheat - what an underhanded move!"


Unable to remain silent, the dean interjected firmly,"Mr. Kirk, you're unfairly partial towards Stacey.Why do you overlook Rylie's clear and exceptional abilities?"



Leland bristled with unease yet remained defiant."I've treated them equally. The problem here lies with Rylie."



With calm authority, Rylie instructed, "Enough excuses. Just apologize."


Holding back tears, Stacey pleaded earnestly, "Rylie,forgive me. I'm entirely responsible. Blame me if you must, but please don't hold this against Leland. I'm truly sorry."


Unable to bear her shame, Stacey turned and fled,sobbing.


"See what you've done?" Leland snapped at Rylie before running after Stacey.


Fred wanted to go and comfort Stacey, but two  imposing men entered abruptly, seizing his shoulders. One sneered coldly, "Who gave you permission to leave?"


Fred flinched in shock. "Who the hell are you? What do you think you're doing?"


Without his military attire, Brock firmly hauled Fred outside to the crowded sports field, assisted by his companion.



Brock forced Fred to his knees with a swift kick, then mockingly patted his cheek. "It's time to keep your promise, Mr. Dury. Crawl on the ground and apologize to Miss Kirk for everyone to hear."


"It was just a joke!" Fred blurted, his face crimson with embarrassment. He deeply regretted leaving his bodyguards at home.


Brock's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Just a joke,huh? Wouldn't you have demanded Miss Kirk crawl and apologize if she had failed?"


Fred hesitated for a moment. As a trained military  interrogator, Brock was certain that Fred would have.


Brock wouldn't tolerate humiliation toward Rylie,especially since she had once saved the general's life.



He straightened confidently, towering above Fred."You'd better honor your bet, or your family's wealth will vanish overnight."


Fred twisted his face in defiance. "And who exactly are you to threaten my family? You can't ruin us with just a few words."



Brock smiled ominously. "The general mentioned your family's stock has been teetering lately.if you'd prefer swift ruin, he can arrange that by evening."


In all of Crolens, Fred couldn't recall another influential family besides the Morgan family who had a high-ranking general. His eyes widened with anxiety; he wouldn't risk the Durys' future on a bluff.


How had someone as insignificant as Rylie gained support from the Morgans, strong enough to humiliate him publicly?


Unable to defy the situation, Fred reluctantly crawled on the ground and shouted, "Rylie, I'm sorry!"


Brock sneered, nudging him harder, "Louder!"


Fred's reluctant shout filled the sports field, reaching Stacey's ears from a distance. Witnessing his humiliation, she felt her heart torn apart, tears streaming unchecked.


She struggled to understand how Rylie, who appeared to have lost everything, could emforce such disgrace upon Fred. Did he do this willinglly? Did he still secretly care for Rylie, even to this degrading extent?



Overwhelmed, Stacey angrily stormed away.


Observing everything quietly, Rylie felt detached from Fred's disgrace. Leaving the scene, she approached a sleek luxury car parked nearby.


She'd noticed it earlier upon entering the campuS.
Calmly, she leaned forward, tapping gently on the window. "Mr. Morgan, was it you behind all this?"


The tinted window slowly lowered, revealing Brad,his handsome face partially obscured by shadows,waiting silently inside.
###Chapter 14 Brad's Another Gamble
"Yes, that's correct." Brad inclined his head slightly,revealing a perfectly sculpted profile.


"I didn't ask for your assistance, but thanks anyway,"Rylie replied casually, eyeing Brad and mistakenly assuming that he had arrived for medical advice."You're looking healthier, though you should keep taking your medications for now. Unfortunately,your current condition is too serious for any immediate procedures."


According to Rylie's assessment medication alone wouldn't suffice to cure Brad; he'd need delicate nerve repair surgery, a specialty she hadn't fully mastered yet.


Brad stared deeply into her eyes and said evenly,"I'm not here because of you. I'm meeting Timothy."


A wry smile curved Rylie's lips. "What a small world.He used to be my mentor,"
"A fortunate coincidence," Brad remarked dryly,extending a folded campus newspaper toward her."You're the student he expelled, and this project happens to be my investment."


Brad hadn't deliberately sought her out-it truly was coincidental.


Skimming the newspaper briefly, Rylie chuckled lightly. "Just a heads-up, Timothy can't fulfill your expectations. But feel free to continue funding him if you like wasting money."



Timothy's team was exploring cutting-edge medical and artificial intelligence technologies, but all their foundational research depended entirely on Rylie's contributions. Without her, the project was doomed.


Brad met Rylie's eyes steadily, seeing the amused skepticism within. He could tell that she spoke the truth; her composure during his intense pain had proven her resilience and talent.


"This research holds the key to my surgery," Brad explained earnestly. "My career cannot be compromised by medical limitations. I'm certainyou grasp the gravity of that, Miss Kirk."


Recalling her dark, confined sessions treating Brad,Rylie vividly remembered the countless scars marking his skin - battle injuries from dedicated service to their nation.


Yet Brad's condition was neurological, and a single error during surgery without advanced medical techniques could render him permanently paralyzed.


Looking at Brad, who had given everything for his country, Rylie felt genuine admiration stirring. After a thoughtful pause, she asked earnestly, "Are you willing to trust me with your life's most critical research?"



Brad calmly asked, "Do I have any reason not to?"


His penetrating gaze remained fixed on her. "There's nothing left for me to fear losing, so why not risk one last gamble?"


Slightly narrowing her eyes in approval, Rylie handed Brad her phone. "As expected of a high-ranking naval officer.Please leave a contact, Mr. Morgan."


Brad's fingers brushed lightly against hers as he accepted the device, the brief touch carrying unexpected warmth.


"VitaLink Hospital produced a vial of Nexo-7; I intend to collect it," Brad said quietly, handing the phone back slowly, fingers grazing again. "But I've heard recent troubling reports about VitaLink. I'm no medical expert - could you accompany me,Miss Kirk?"



Brad had grown suspicious of VitaLink Hospital after discovering the Wilde family's blacklisting through dark web channels.


Conveniently free at the moment, Rylie dismissed Rory, entered the vehicle on the opposite side, and settled comfortably inside. "Let's go. I'll join you."


Inside the luxurious car, Brad's heavy medicinal scent lingered initially, replaced by Rylie's subtle fragrance of lilies that gently eased his usual tension.
The car exited campus smoothly, passing a visibly distressed Vivian rushing along.


Stacey sat fuming in a campus cafe, with Leland attempting to comfort her by her side.


Her fragile composure shattered abruptly when her phone rang.


Vivian urgently questioned her absence. "Why aren't you at the lab? Grab the Nexo-7 immediately-we need to get to VitaLink Hospital, now!"


Stacey's pulse quickened, her voice trembling as she responded, "Dr. Estrada, we've just completed the Nexo-7. I'd prefer to monitor its results a bit more.What's the urgency?"



Vivian's brow knitted together in frustration. "You sent me a photo two days ago confirming the Nexo-7was ready. I verified it personally- it matches your former colleague's formulation perfectly. Stop worrying about its potency. Just get it to VitaLink Hospital immediately."
Vivian said sternly, "Protect that vial of Nexo-7carefully - it's very valuable and crucial to your future! Your entire career hangs on this."


After she ended the call, Stacey's complexion was drained of color. Noticing her panic, Leland questioned softly, "What's got you so anxious?Vivian wants the Nexo-7; just bring it to her.Relax."


With shaky fingers, Stacey nervously replied,"Leland, is the solution truly so valuable? I had no idea it was so valuable."


Stacey was overwhelmed by regret. She never imagined that the formula Rylie had efortlessly created could be so precious. Back then, determined to outdo Rylie in everything, she let her pride override reason, thinking that she could definitely produce what that idiot Rylie could make, and rashly promised Vivian that she could produce the Nexo-7.


Yet, despite locking herself away in the lab, Stacey had failed miserably, exhausting all the materials that Vivian provided without creating the Nexo-7. Now all she had was a questionable half-finished substance.
She had confidently informed Leland about her progress, even sending him photographic proof of a seemingly high-quality compound that she had created during long, sleepless nights in the lab.


Leland reassured her gently, saying, "You've done impressive work. The purity level looks excellent. It'll be fine, Stacey-I believe in you."


Now, Stacey was trapped by her own deception, and her anxiety intensified until her hands trembled uncontrollably. Admitting that she had never created the Nexo-7 would mean surrendering her dignity and admitting inferiority to Rylie. How would she face Leland and Vivian afterward? What choice did she have?



Standing abruptly, Stacey hurried toward the lab,desperately searching for an escape.


Suddenly, inspiration struck her. Nobody knew exactly what high-purity Nexo-7 should look like -she could simply alter the color and present it as authentic. If questioned later, she could blame the treatment's failure on the patient's severity rather than her formula.


Relief flooded Stacey's tense frame. Confident in her new plan, she collected the fake compound and hurriedly left for VitaLink Hospital with Leland.


However, what Stacey hadn't anticipated was encountering Rylie at VitaLink Hospital, comfortably conversing among senior hospital directors and doctors.
###Chapter 15 Isolated, Targeted, And Misunderstood
Vivian beamed with pride, pulling Stacey forward."Meet Stacey Kirk, a prodigy in medical research-my own student and the mastermind behind the Nexo-7 serum. She played a pivotal role in Rylie's last formulation, and this new version is even more refined. It's perfectly safe for Mr. Morgan, and the benefits will only increase with use."


With an arch of her brow, Rylie let her words linger in the air. "Is that so? I suppose I should see for myself just how flawless Stacey's serum really is."


At that moment, Brad was elsewhere, catching up with an old comrade in one of the private rooms,leaving Rylie to oversee things on her own.


Stacey's knuckles turned white as she forced a smile, nails digging into her palms. "Of course, Rylie and I are family, after all. It's only natural our research would reflect one another's skills."



Leland, standing at the edge of the group, let out a scornful laugh. "You don't have to sugarcoat it,Stacey.Everyone knows Rylie's been taking credit for your breakthroughs."


Rylie couldn't help but marvel at his foolishness. She had gotten full scores of that difficult exam,yet here he was, still convinced that she had cheated and copied Stacey's work.



She cut the tension with a brisk command, saying,"Let's see the serum, then. Bring it out."


A trace of doubt flickered across Stacey's face,but she remembered-no one here but Rylie could ever achieve a high-purity result. Gaining some composure, she insisted, "For the sake of the patient, Rylie, we should administer the serum without any unnecessary delay."



A laugh bubbled from Rylie. "No need to look, then.The serum you're holding is a fake."
 The room shifted, every face changing. Vivian's expression soured. "Rylie, my student put in the work for these results. On what basis do you claim the serum's a forgery?"


Stacey didn't miss a beat, her voice trembling with wounded pride. "Rylie, do you really want a repeat of what happened with Nicolas? You should be responsible for your words and actions."


A nearby doctor, curiosity piqued, glanced over."What's this about Nicolas? Do you mean Mr. Nicolas Kirk, still in this hospital? What's his connection to Rylie?"


In a gentle voice, Stacey answered, "Nicolas has never recovered. The serum Rylie created poisoned him."



Leland's resentment only grew sharper at the mention. "Our parents will be back soon, Rylie. After what you did to Nicolas, the Kirk family will never take you back."


Their accusations painted Rylie as a villain, and suspicion rippled through the crowd.


Hospital administrators, remembering Rylie's connection to Brad, tried to intervene, replying, "Mr.Morgan must have been misled. We should administer the serum to him right away."


"Enough." Rylie strode over to Stacey, snatched the box from her grasp, and removed the vial for all to see.



What she revealed was a bottle of serum so unnaturally violet that it looked toxic. Her lips curled in scorn. "And you call yourselves doctors? Don't you realize high-purity Nexo-7 is deadly if injected straight into the bloodstream?"


The group was left speechless by this blunt challenge from such a young person.


Even Vivian faltered-she'd never known about this danger. Her anger flared. "If I've never heard of it,then it can't possibly be true! You're just making things up!"
Buoyed by Vivian's support, Stacey chimed in, her confidence returning. "Rylie, stop acting like you're some expert. You're making it all up!"


Rylie retorted, unflinching, "Just because you're ignorant doesn't mean the facts change."


Tempers were rising and voices sharpening when, at that very moment, the elevator doors slid open -and Brad entered, accompanied by a striking woman in a crisp white coat.


The moment Marsha appeared, a glimmer of hope flickered in Stacey's eyes. She wasted no time adopting a fragile, wounded expression. "Marsha,thank goodness you're here."


Marsha made a show of lingering beside Brad, as if she and he shared a private understanding.Her voice was all gentle authority. "Is there a problem? Has the serum been prepared? We shouldn't keep Mr.Morgan waiting much longer."


Brad's eyes flickered toward Rylie, standing slightly a targeted, and misunderstood despite her obvious brilliance.



Without hesitation, he stepped forward, subtly placing himself in front of her, a protective gesture that spoke volumes.


"There's something wrong with the serum," Brad said, his toneflat and absolute.


Rylie, startled by this open show of trust, felt a softness that she hadn't expected. She gave a small nod. "He's right - the serum's a counterfeit. I've never seen Nexo-7 that shade. It must be contaminated or switched."



Brad's support rattled Stacey, who saw her social standing suddenly at risk. Tears welled in her eyes,her voice trembling with fury. "Rylie, why are you making up stories? Are you trying to destroy everything I've worked for?"


As she wobbled, Leland rushed to steady her,shooting a cold glare at Rylie. "Isn't it enough that you're always stirring up drama? This isn't a game-  tampering with the serum could be fatal!"



Rylie kept her voice level and calm. "Raw,unprocessed Nexo-7 is highly toxic. If you inject it directly, you'll only make things worse."


The way Brad gravitated to Rylie gnawed at Marsha.Not long ago, even Felix, the wealthy Owen heir,had overlooked her expertise. For once, she wanted recognition for her own skills.


She lifted her chin, determined to display her knowledge. "I've never heard of any detoxification step for this compound. In our practice,we use it straight. People who don't understand the medicine should stay silent."


Quick to fall in line, Leland rounded on Rylie. "Marsha is the top of her class - she'd never mislead anyone.Rylie,stop humiliating yourself and get out of here!"



Ignoring the scolding, Rylie turned to Brad and asked, "Do you still trust this place enough to go through with treatment?"
Brad didn't answer immediately. He calmly pulled out his phone, dialed Evita, and set it to speaker. His voice was measured and clear. "I need your expertise on something."


It wasn't often Brad called, so Evita answered promptly, her tone instantly deferential, "Yes, Mr.Morgan, what can I do for you?"


He got right to the point. "Is high-purity Nexo-7dangerous if used straight from the vial?"


A pause followed before Evita spoke again. "That's an unusual question, Mr.Morgan. High-purity Nexo-7is absolutely toxic without detoxification. It's nothing like ordinary serums. I assumed you'd know that-you just had a high-purity dose yourself, and the detoxification process was necessary."


Evita hadn't always known about this, but after witnessing Rylie carefully neutralize the serum before Brad's last injection, she couldn't deny that the procedure was real.


As her words settled in, an uneasy silence swept over the room.



Evita, hearing the silence on the other end, felt that something was amiss. "Mr. Morgan, what happened?"
###Chapter 16 Leland's Confusion
A wry smirk tugged at Brad's lips. "Is that so?Remarkable that even a so-called genius like Marsha overlooked the detoxification process for high-purity Nexo-7. With that level of oversight, I'd hesitate to put the care of any important guest in your hands."


He ended the call before Evita could protest, fixing Marsha with an unreadable stare. "What you declared is contrary to your grandmother's words.Tell me, Dr. Wilde, do you claim to surpass her expertise?"


Rylie couldn't hide her satisfaction; nothing was sweeter than watching the Wilde family unravel their own shining star's reputation.


Seeing Marsha's flush of humiliation and the sudden humility from Leland, Rylie taunted, her smile widening, "Or maybe Marsha really is that gifted,after all?"
Trapped between loyalty to her grandmother and the sting of public embarrassment, Marsha had no choice but to bow her head. "I was mistaken, Mr.Morgan. The Nexo-7 serum is extremely rare, and only Aetheris Pharmacy pharmacists are fully versed in its dangers. But Felix's case is unrelated - I can handle his care, if you'd allow me another opportunity."


Brad showed no interest in further debate. He turned toward Rylie. "Back at school, you rescued Felix after a pneumothorax. Recent tests uncovered some complications. Would you be willing to examine him?"



Felix's face drifted through Rylie's memory-faintly familiar, but not enough for her to rush in. "If his condition isn't too complex, the military hospital surgeons can take over. They're highly competent.There's no need for me to intervene unless it's urgent."


Brad didn't press her, accepting her answer with a nod."Very well."
Without hesitation, Brad tossed the fake serum into a nearby trash can, his glare cold as it landed on Leland. "It seems the Kirk and Wilde families are experts only in deception."


Marsha's legs buckled; she grabbed the wall to steady herself, her voice pleading. "Mr. Morgan, the Wilde family's reputation is real! We've all been duped by Stacey. I'Il have my grandmother personally oversee your Nexo-7 next time -at the next conference, I'll deliver it myself!"


Without another word, Brad stepped into the elevator alongside Rylie, not bothering to look back.


Leland was left completely bewildered. What hold did Rylie have over Brad that he would follow her lead so obediently? How had things turned upside down between them?


Stacey, blindsided by the abrupt reversal, barely registered what had happened before Vivian's hand cracked across her cheek. "If you weren't up to the task, you should have spoken up! Fabricating Nexo-7-do you have any idea how much trouble you've brought down on us?"


Tears spilled down Stacey's cheeks. "Dr. Estrada, I'm sorry, I never meant-"


Vivian interjected coldly, "No more excuses! Every opportunity | promised you is gone." She shoved Stacey aside. "Clear out your things. You're finished in my research group!"


Marsha wasn't about to show any sympathy either.She shot Leland a scornful look and scoffed, "Some brother you turned out to be! You let your sister offend the Morgan family. The Kirk name is finished -watch how far you all fall!"


Once the uproar faded and the crowd dispersed,Leland cornered Stacey in the sterile hallway,his anger cold and unforgiving. "Where was your head,Stacey? You went and manufactured fake Nexo-7, of all things! That's the Morgan family you almost crossed-the very people who hold sway over this entire city! Even the President shows them respect.If your counterfeit serum had ended up in Mr. Morgan,do you realize how catastrophic it would've been?"
Just imagining the Kirk family's ruin sent chills down his spine.


He jabbed a finger at her, voice sharp. "I've never been so disappointed in you!"


Stacey's defenses shattered. She protested through sobs, saying, "Leland, I only wanted to bring our family honor! If the Wilde family acknowledged me,wouldn't that have helped you as well? I did it for all of us!"


Leland wasn't moved. "For the family? You really think the Morgans wouldn't see through a fake serum? They'd have seen through your lies in a heartbeat!"


Stacey yelled, "None of this would've happened if not for Rylie! She's the one who called the serum fake - if she'd kept quiet, no one would have known!"


Watching Stacey's face twist with tears, Leland felt,perhaps for the first time, just how much trouble his sister truly brought. If this had been Rylie, she would never have fought back or caused such a scene.


His voice was cold as he laid the blame. "Excuses won't change anything. That serum-Nexo-7-was Rylie's achievement from the start, and you claimed all the credit while misleading everyone."


Stacey couldn't bring herself to face the truthin his words. Rather than admit her fault, she turned and fled, sobbing as she ran down the corridor.


Anger warred with suspicion in Leland's chest. How could Rylie, supposedly ignorant and cast out from the Kirk family, rise so quickly - first as a star student, then as the creator of a valuable new medication, and now, in the company of the Morgans? Was she simply hiding her true talents all this time? Had they made a grave mistake expelling her?



Regret gnawed at him, sharpo and persistent.


He was still puzzling over how to make amends with the Morgans when a colleague appeared in a rush,gasping for breath. "There's been a turn for the worse with your brother. You need to come now!"


Leland's face was drained of color, and he raced for the hospital ward.卵


As night fell, Brad extended an invitation to Rylie for dinner at Savory Haven. In the midst of elegantly dressed patrons, Rylie's sweatshirt and jeans set her apart.


Even so, her presence drew every eye. Despite her casual clothes, there was no mistaking her beauty or the unshakable composure with which she navigated the upscale room-utterly unfazed.


Brad guided her into the sanctuary of a private dining suite.



She lingered by the expansive window, watching city lights flicker to life. "With your condition, it's best not to go heavy on the food. Let's both stick to something simple."


When their meal arrived, the waiter set a cake before Rylie, his manner both formal and warm. "Our chef prepared this just for you. We hope it's to your liking."


Rylie studied the cake, noting that it was the very same kind Leland had given to Stacey that morning.Her surprise showed as she looked across the table at Brad. "Is this really for me?"


"It is," Brad replied, his features relaxing just a little."Every young woman deserves her own birthday celebration."



That admission caught Rylie off guard; she hadn't expected Brad to notice something as personal as her birthday.


She gripped the utensils a little tighter, her eyes dropping to the table. "The thing is, today isn't actually my birthday."


One eyebrow lifted on Brad's face. "Oh? Isn't it?"


Rylie's smile turned wry, a touch bitter. "Ever since Stacey came back to the Kirks, my birthday's disappeared from the calendar."
Their birthdays were separated by just two days,but for Rylie, the family had always made it clear that there would never be a celebration just for her.
###Chapter 17 Misunderstanding
Year after year, the Kirk family spared no expense for Stacey's celebration- filling the house with guests,lighting candles, and slicing up cake for her wishes.


Only at the very end, Stacey would feign generosity,announcing that Rylie's birthday should be celebrated too, and press the slightly wilted crown onto Rylie's head, insisting that she make a wish over the remnants of Stacey's cake.


She couldn't explain why she'd dredged up such a sickening old memory with this imposing man across from her. Her tone was airy, as if none of it mattered."Just think of it as a family joke," she said.


A thoughtful silence settled before Brad replied, "I heard the Kirks adopted you young. Your biologica parents are supposed to live out in the countryside."


Rylie confirmed it with a nod. "That's right. Fernridge -a little village out on the fringes of Crolens. When I get the chance, I'll try to find them."


Brad's fingertips drummed a slow rhythm against the table, his eyes distant. "Funny how life works. That's quite the coincidence."


Her brow furrowed. "What do you mean?"


He simply shook his head, choosing not to elaborate.


Rumor had it that the missing daughter of the Owen family vanished from Fernridge, and every detail the investigators had uncovered matched Rylie-a medical student, just like the reports described.


Yet Rylie's past was clearly more complicated than that of a simple orphan. Brad decided that it would be cruel to raise her hopes before he had any solid proof.


After their meal, Brad was spotted by a cluster of his former army comrades. The moment they recognized him, their faces broke into grins. "General Morgan!You're back on your feet - what a sight for sore eyes!"
There were skilled veterans among them and plenty of eager young soldiers too, but every one of them looked at Brad with genuine respect and awe.


Years spent facing danger together meant that Brad couldn't just slip away. He turned and gave Rylie a reassuring look. "Let my driver take you home tonight."


A few of the men, noticing the striking woman by his side,exchanged sly, knowing glances and tried not to nudge each other.


Casting a quick glance at the table cluttered with liquor bottles, Rylie gave a pointed reminder. "Don't touch a single drop tonight."


Brad hesitated, then offered a small nod."Understood."





Duty done, she turned on her heel and strode toward the elevator. As soon as she left, the soldiers wasted no time nudging Brad and whispering among themselves. "She's even laying down the law about drinking. Is she your girlfriend or something?"
"All these years you spent deployed at sea, and now you finally resurface - turns out it wasn't just for work, but to go out with a gorgeous young lady!"


"Is she even legal?"


"She looks like she still has homework to do..."


Jealous quips and teasing filled the air around Brad.He pinched the bridge of his nose and interjected,"Enough. She's my doctor, and a prodigy at that-show some respect. Don't go spreading gossip that'll harm her reputation."


The moment Brad adopted his commanding tone,the playful mood vanished, replaced by qquiet respect. Yet even as they fell silent, the men were happy to see their general healthy, hoping for his quick return to service.


Descending from the private dining floor, Rylie found herself in the bustling lobby, where the mood was lighter and laughter filled the air.


A table full of racers noticed her arrival. One of them elbowed Phillip. "Hey, isn't that your sister? Years of tearing up the tracks together, and you finally got Rylie to join the pre-race dinner?"


"I never invited her," Phillip replied, brows knitting as he caught sight of her retreating figure. "What's she doing here?"


Right then, a distinguished man in a tailored suit exited the elevator, spotting Rylie instantly. He greeted her warmly. "Dr. Kirk, thank you for saving General Morgan. If you ever dine here again, the meal's on us."①



He presented her with a premium VIP card for the restaurant.



Rylie politely refused, shaking her head. "That's really not necessary - but thank you for the gesture."


Her polite decline only seemed to fuel the man's insistence-he pressed the VIP card into her hand.


Introducing himself as Clive Perry, he explained that he once served under Brad. During a fierce naval battle, a grenade had torn through the nerves in his leg, robbing him of a normal stride. Forced into retirement, he'd invested in this restaurant with his wife's family.


"If not for this injury, I'd have stood by General Morgan's side for at least two more years," Clive said with a note of regret. "You have to do everything you can for him-his men and this country need him."


Those words struck a chord. Rylie accepted the VIP card, then reached into her bag for one of her business cards. "I'm based at the military compound for now. Every evening, I take patients at the clinic. lf you want to discuss your leg, you're welcome to come by."


Emotion swept across Clive's face, his voice trembling. "Are you saying there's hope for my leg?"


Rylie kept her words honest and measured. "We'd need to run a full evaluation before I can make any promises. 1 won't know for certain until then, but l'll do all I can."
He clasped her hand with gratitude. "If you're the one who healed General Morgan, I trust you completely. If anyone can help me, it's you."


While their brief handshake and card exchange meant one thing to them, Phillip saw it from a different angle entirely.


A racer at the next table leaned in, eyeing Clive with suspicion. "Who's that older guy? When did Rylie start getting close to people like him?" He shot a warning look at Phillip. "The world rally's almost here.If she brings drama, it could ruin our sponsorships."


Irritation surged in Phillip; he tossed aside his napkin and strode over to intercept Rylie.


No sooner had Clive disappeared than Rylie found her exit blocked. A furious voice rang out behind her."Rylie! Hold up!"


A hand snatched at the cake box she carried,sending it jostling against the clear plastic until the frosting smeared. Rylie's face iced over as she regained her balance and turned. "What is your problem?"


"What's my problem? Have you looked at yourself lately?" Phillip jabbed his finger at her shoulder, his anger barely contained. "You've barely been out from under the Kirk family roof and you're already throwing yourself at some old man for support?"


His outburst carried through the lobby, heads turning as whispers spread.


Rylie's patience snapped. She knocked his hand away. "People will always believe what they want.My ties with the Kirk family are cut for good,and what l do is none of your concern."


Phillip's scowl deepened. "The Kirk family hasn't made it public. As far as everyone here knows, you're still one of us," he retorted. "I'm warning you- if you embarrass us, don't expect to race for my team again!"


A harsh laugh escaped Rylie as she heard him. His teammate chimed in, "Yeah, Rylie, the club's still negotiating with sponsors. Your choices reflect on us all. Apologize to Phillip and you'll still have the Kirk name behind you."


Standing taller, Phillip looked down his nose at her,clearly expecting an immediate apology.


He'd already made up his mind-one word of regret,and he'd let her race and maybe even vouch for her at home.



But...
###Chapter 18 The Customer Is Always Right
"Who said I ever wanted to join your team?" Rylie scoffed coldly. "Do you really see yourself as my brother?"



Phillip's smug expressioninstantly froze. The club members around him exchanged incredulous lookS,their murmurs rising in surprise. "What? You're not racing with us this year?"


Every year, Rylie participated in the club's races,though she was conspicuously absent from their pre-and post-race gatherings.


She had always been just a tool to guarantee Stacey's victories and the club's prestige.


Phillip immediately frowned, his tone sharp with reprimand. "Don't be so ungrateful. Racing with us has always been an honor for you."
Rylie laughed bitterly. "An honor? Is my name even on the team's official roster?"


Phillip stared at her in disbelief. "Why fuss over trivial details? Obviously, the official position is reserved for Stacey. You being a substitute is already the greatest honor I've bestowed on you."


Rylie sneered, raising her head to meet Phillip's eyes,her gaze icy, "Phillip, every year l've raced as Stacey's stand-in, running the full course, only for her to claim the trophy and prize money. Exactly what honor have l ever received?"


"That's because Stacey is more dependable than you! Her skills are no less impressive!" Phillip snapped defensively. "Besides, Stacey has endured so much hardship from you ever since she lived with us.Helping her is your responsibility!"


People surrounding Phillip chimed in, attempting to coax Rylie, "Yes, Stacey is kind and devoted to racing. It's fitting she gets recognition. Rylie, you're family-don't be so petty."
"I'm no longer a Kirk," Rylie shot back sharply. "And I won't be racing with you again. If you want trophies,go earn them yourselves."


Phillip was momentarily stunned, never expecting such defiance from Rylie.


Anger flared in him. "Rylie! You don't really believe our team needs you to win, do you? I only offered you a place out of pity, to help you earn a little cash so you wouldn't resort to hanging around rich old men! Are you aiming to become a gold digger?"


Phillip's words dripped venom, and Rylie didn't hesitate. Her hand flashed out and struck him across the face.


The slap sent Phillip sprawling to the floor, blood trickling from his split lip. Stunned, he stared up in disbelief. "You dare hit me!"①


Rylie shook her stinging hand, her voice calm yet ruthless. "Since Stacey is so talented, let her lead your team to victory. Don't bother me again - or next time, I'll make sure you won't even be able to lways Right drive!"



Having joined Britton's racing club, Rylie relished the thought of facing them as rivals.


Being knocked down by a woman in public crushed Phillip's pride. Fury overcoming his humiliation, he sprang to his feet, lunging to grab Rylie.


Security swiftly intervened as chaos erupted,and Clive, alerted by the commotion, returned to the scene.


Phillip struggled against the guards, the vivid slap mark making his expression even more ferocious."Rylie, is this who you really are? You've always bullied Stacey and exploited my kindness! Today, as your brother, I'll teach you a lesson!"


"What's going on here?" Clive immediately stepped protectively in front of Rylie, his voice stern. "How dare you cause trouble for my guest? Get out! You and your team are permanently banned from the Savory Haven!"
"And who do you think you are? The customer is always right-you can't throw me out!" Phillip spat angrily, fighting against the guards. "No one can stop me from disciplining my sister today!"


Regular patrons recognized Clive and warned softly,"Kirk boy, you'd better not offend Mr. Perry."


Those in the know were aware of Clive's connections to the powerful Morgan family, and his wife was a key figure in the world's largest restaurant empire.The Kirk family was insignificant in comparison.


Phillip, oblivious to these facts, continued ranting.


With a simple gesture from Clive, security threw Phillip and his followers out onto the street. Clive then declared firmly, "From now on, all Kirk family members are banned from every establishment I own. Take your entitled attitude somewhere else!"


Clive didn't just own one restaurant; he also had many cafés, bars, and eateries favored by high society. Being banned by Clive meant that Phillip would be excluded from future elite gatherings.
Only after being expelled and meeting contemptuous stares from passersby did Phillip realize his blunder.


That seemingly insignificant middle-aged man was actually the restaurant's influential owner, and Rylie was his honored guest.


How could this be? Rylie, who should've been a penniless outcast, knew such a prominent figure?


Brad emerged from the elevator, approaching Rylie with concern when he noticed the ruined cake in her hands. "The driver said he hadn't seen you yet. What happened here?"


"Nothing much, just ran into some unpleasant company." Rylie brushed it off, looking at Brad curiously. "Finished your meeting already?"


He'd hurried out of worry, anticipating trouble, but Brad simply nodded. "Yes. Let's go,I'll drive you home."



He pressed the elevator button and waited courteously, allowing her to step inside first.
Rylie entered confidently, and Brad leaned slightly toward her, their closeness spaking curiosity among observers.



It was the first time anyone had seen the enigmatic Brad openly attentive toward a seemingly unknown girl.


From the roadside, Phillip stared bitterly as a tall man in a luxury suit held open a car door for Rylie.


It wasn't just any car - its sheer extravagance revealed the man's elevated status.



How had Rylie's circumstances changed so drastically?




Lost in thought, Phillip barely noticed when a fellow racer tapped his shoulder. "Maybe you should head home. Didn't you say it was Stacey's birthday today?"


Snapping out of it, Phillip quickly left for home.


Yet, upon arriving, the usually festive house was unsettlingly quiet.
"Why isn't there a celebration?" Phillip asked,confused. "Where's Stacey?"


Leland rubbed his temples wearily, his tone cold and frustrated. "Don't even mention her. You have no idea what trouble she's caused."

###Chapter 19 You Are Truly Too Kind
Stacey had already recognized the familiar growl of Phillip's sports car in the driveway. Silently, she crept to her bedroom door and hovered at the top of the staircase, straining to catch every word as the conversation in the living room grew intense.


Down below, Leland broke the news to Phillip about Stacey's hand in the fake Nexo-7 debacle. Phillip,brushing off the seriousness, simply waved a hand."She only wanted the Kirk name to shine. Maybe she was overzealous, but don't overlook how loyal she's always been. A little scolding is fine, but she's done a lot for us."



Suddenly, Leland shifted the conversation. "Didn't Rylie act for the family's sake too?"①


Phillip's jaw clenched, memories of their last heated encounter flaring up. "Can you not drag her into this again?"
Leland's expression tightened. "The truth is, Nicolas isn't getting any better."


Phillip's defensiveness melted into genuine worry."What's going on? Wasn't the so-called prodigy doctor Stacey brought in supposed to fix everything?Weren't those new meds meant to save him?"


Leland's response was heavy with resignation. "That plan from Marsha failed - worse than failed.According to today's results, Nicolas is deteriorating faster now than when Rylie was looking after him."He swallowed a mouthful of whiskey, trying to steady his nerves.



Phillip stared, uncomprehending. "You're saying the new expert did more harm than good?"


Hearing this, Stacey felt a shiver down her spine, and anger toward Marsha surged within her. Marsha was touted as the youngest and most famous doctor in Crolens. She had gone to great lengths to bring Marsha to treat Nicolas, only to worsen his condition.


Leland's thoughts drifted back to the day's confrontation - Marsha, floundering with the fake Nexo-7, while Rylie saw through the ruse instantly. A seed of doubt sprouted. "Did I wrongly accuse Rylie?"


Phillip still wasn't seeing the full picture. "What do you mean?"


Leland's voice grew soft, his gaze fixed on the floor."Looking back... even though Nicolas coughed up black blood after Rylie's treatment, his health didn't decline. He lived like himself. Ever since we changed his medication, he's gotten so much worse quickly."


The more Leland mulled it over, the more the truth came into focus- Stacey had been the one to point fingers at Rylie for poisoning Nicolas, had insisted on switching his medication, and now Nicolas's health had nosedived.


Phillip hesitated, doubt flickering in his eyes. "You really think that's how it happened?"


All at once, a maid's panicked cry echoed from the upper floor. "Miss Kirk, put that knife down!" The commotion broke the brothers' discussion. Both men raced upstairs to a startling scene: Stacey,distraught and shaking, clutching a kitchen knife against her arm while a maid tried in vain to intervene.



"Don't try to stop me!" Stacey sobbed, her voice ragged. "Everything's gone wrong because of me.I never should've come back to this family. Nicolas got worse, Rylie was pushed out, and... All is because of me. Maybe it's better if I disappear!"


Phillip darted forward and wrestled the knife from her, wrapping her trembling frame in a fierce embrace. "Stop it! No one's blaming ·you. You've always given everything for us. Please don't carry this burden alone."



He turned pleading eyes to Leland, who looked just as shaken. "Leland, mistakes happen. If you're willing to let things go with Rylie, can't you do the same for Stacey? She's blood - she's our sister, for real."


As he thought of the good times, Leland's resolve weakened. He reached for calm and said, "Today's your birthday too. Mom and Dad are almost home-they want to celebrate. Please, Stacey, promise you won't do anything drastic. You matter to us."


Tears running down her cheeks, Stacey gasped out an apology. "I'm sorry, Leland. I'll try to make things right. I want to learn from Rylie-maybe she'll teach me how to make the potions properly. The truth is, I only made those mistakes because she confused me in the lab. I take all the blame."


At this, Phillip's temper exploded. "So it was Rylie's scheme all along! She deliberately led you astray.She's always been out to get you."


Leland, deep down, sensed that there was more to the story, but he couldn't find the words to challenge her just then. Instead, he glanced at Phillip, noticing the vividred imprint on his cheek. "Who hit you,Phillip?"


Phillip's face darkened as he remembered. "I tried to do something nice-invited Rylie to partner with me for the upcoming racing tournament, even planned to give her part of the prize to help her out now that she's back with her poor family. Instead of thanking me,she slapped me!"


Stacey's tears welled anew, and she reached for Phillip's arm, her voice trembling with worry. "Phillip,does it hurt? I'll get some ointment for you."


Phillip's frustration melted away, replaced by tenderness. "You're the only one in this family who truly cares, Stacey. Rylie, on the other hand- she's got nothing but pride, and she deserves her miserable situation."


With watery eyes, Stacey made a solemn vow. "Let me race for you, Phillip. I'll put everything into it, and if I win, every cent of the prize will go to Rylie. And then her life won't be so poor after she goes back to her own family."


Phillip's chest swelled with pride. "Rylie, you are truly too kind."


Beneath the surface, irritation simmered - he refused to accept that Rylie's absence would doom his team. In his mind, blood meant everything. With Stacey on board, he was convinced that they had finally claim the top spot at the global relay.


When Stacey had quieted, Leland remembered something that their parents had relayed over the phone. He then said to Stacey, "Rylie used to be engaged to Fred, remember? Tomorrow, the Dury family is coming to formally end the engagement.Both you and Rylie need to be there."


That news sent a ripple through Stacey's heart,though she masked it with a look of wide-eyed surprise. "Why am I needed at the meeting?"


Leland's gaze grew somber. "Fred isn't just ending things with Rylie - he wants to propose to you instead. Hasn't he mentioned this to you before?"


A shadow crossed Stacey's features, and she let her shoulders droop, her voice trembling. "Leland,marrying Fred was never what I wanted! He only talked to me because he was upset about Rylie, not because I encouraged him. And I just see him as a friend of mine. I swear, I never meant to take Rylie's place."
Trying to appear earnest, Stacey fumbled with her phone. "I'l call Fred right now and tell him not to go through with it. Rylie's the one who truly belongs with him."


Leland held up a hand, shaking his head. "Don't bother, Stacey. You're the Kirk family's real daughter.Mom and Dad think the match is only natural. If you and Fred agree, then everything falls into place."


Stacey lowered her eyes and spoke meekly. "Aright,I'll go along with what you and the family decide,but please - I don't want Rylie to believe I'm trying to steal her fiancé. Let me talk to her myself."


He gave a nod. "That's fair. Go ahead."


With the Kirk family's standing slipping and their relationship with the powerful Morgan family in tatters, their prospects had never looked dimmer.The Dury family's fortunes, meanwhile, were on the rise, especially with rumored business ties to the influential Owen family of Kouhron. An alliance through Stacey was a strategic move, but it was Rylie who'd bear the shame-Crolens would gossip for weeks about her downfall.


On the eve of the Kirk family's banquet, a striking group swept into Rory's office at the military base,turning heads wherever they passed.


Without preamble, the eldest among them-a man whose presence seemed to bend the air-fixed Rory with a piercing gaze. "You're the one in possession of Rylie's blood sample, aren't you?" he asked, every syllable edged with authority and haste.
###Chapter 20 My Sister!
Rory froze in surprise, needing a moment to gather his thoughts. "May I ask who you are?"


From among these visitors, a person who looked like a butler stepped forward to explain, "We represent the Owen family of Kouhron. This is our patriarch, MAr.Kendrick Owen."



Of course, Rory recognized that name - Kouhron's influential Owen family had made headlines, and he recalled that Kendrick's own grandson had only recently arrived in Crolens for a major surgery.


Rory took a measured breath before responding,"I can't just hand over someone's blood sample on a whim. At the very least, you owe me an explanation."


The butler immediately launched into an explanation,his voice low but clear. "Mr. Owen's granddaughter vanished years ago in Fernridge. We've traced possible leads here, and we're hoping to confirm her  identity through DNA testing."


Weighing his options, Rory nodded slowly. "Yes,Rylie's blood is stored in the hospital bank. Years back, her sister was badly injured in an accident, and her brothers brought her repeatedly to donate. The Kirk family insisted on saving the remaining samples for emergencies."


Kendrick's expression turned thunderous. "They took her blood when she was just a teenager? Who in their right mind would do that to my granddaughter?"


Rory's own conscience pricked at him; the Kirk family's callousness was no secret. Had Rylie not pulled him back from death once, he might never have realized how much she'd suffered. By chance or cruel design, Rylie and Stacey had the same blood type.


Rory turned toward the hallway, gesturing for them to follow. "Let's get the testing started. If your missing girl truly is Rylie, then she finally has a chance for a new beginning."
···


Meanwhile on campus, Rylie felt Stacey's hand clamp down on her wrist. She yanked her arm back,exasperation clear in her voice. "What is it now?"


In the half-empty classroom, Stacey's eyes filled with tears as she hesitated before saying, "Mom and Dad just got back. They're asking for you at home because..."


Before Stacey could finish speaking, her composure shattered. Tears streamed down her cheeks. "This is all on me, Rylie. I ruined everything. Mom and Dad plan to announce who I really am, and Fred's set on dumping you to propose to me, but none of this is what I wanted. I swear I never meant to cause you pain!"


Her sudden breakdown, full of apologies and regret,quickly drew curious stares from everyone in class.Stacey's loyal friend wasted no time, marching up in outrage. "What's wrong with you, Rylie? Now that everybody knows you aren't actually part of the Kirk bloodline, you're still hanging around and making Stacey suffer as if she's the outsider?"


Rylie fixed her with a cool stare. "What makes you think I'm the one holding on?"


Shaking herself free from Stacey's grip, she flicked her sleeve as if brushing away dust. "Honestly, the broken engagement is a relief. I'll show up as scheduled."



Stacey, realizing that Rylie meant every word, tried again, her voice tight with frustration. "But Rylie, if you let Fred go, you'll be left with nothing. At least if you married into the Dury family, you'd be set for life."



On the surface, Stacey seemed to be looking out for Rylie, but in reality, she was announcing to everyone that she was the real daughter of the Kirk family and Fred's future wife!


"Oh my gosh, are you really going to marry Mr.Dury?" Stacey's friend shrieked, eyes wide. "That makes you Crolens' next socialite!"
A buzz swept through the classroom. "My father works in real estate," one classmate chimed in."He said the Owen family just invested hundreds of millions in a luxury district with the Dury famnily.That's some serious power!"


Stacey basked in the attention, cheeks flushed with pride, but she kept up the act, glancing sideways at Rylie. "Please don't make a fuss. I'd rather see Rylie happy than go through with this."


She turned to Rylie, voice soft. "I'm really sorry.Our brothers want you to teach me to become a real pharmacist. Rylie, can you mentor me?"


Rylie leaned back against the window, golden sunlight framing her features. "Sorry, but you don't have the brains for my lessons."


Stacey froze, face paling at the blunt reply. "You're still holding a grudge," she whispered, voice trembling.


A moment later, she collapsed like a fragile doll,consciousness slipping away.
In no time, teachers rushed her to the nurse's office,and soon after, the school corridors buzzed with gossip - everyone blaming Rylie for making her sister faint.



But Rylie couldn't have cared less about the rumors.She already had the next period's biology lesson memorized and decided to ditch class for the music room instead.


That piano was a relic, used only for student recitals,its keys a little worn but still holding their tune.


Now and then, Rylie came here to clear her mind.She slipped onto the bench, paused as if searching her memory, then let her fingers drift into an impromptu piece.


But she didn't expect that the usually empty music room would have an unexpected visitor today.


Meanwhile, Marcus Owen had just returned from an international tour. Upon learning that his younger sister was enrolled here, he'd went straight for the campus, not really expecting to find her right away.
From across the courtyard, a melody floated through the air - unfamiliar, yet so powerful it drew him toward a nondescript building.


As a professional concert pianist, Marcus he had never heard this composition before. The notes were alive, each passage weaving strength with delicacy,the performer's technique rivaling world-class talent.


He traced the music to a modest piano room and found a girl seated at the keys, sunlight streaming over her. Despite her simple attire, she looked completely absorbed in the moment, her face radiant with emotion - an image that reminded Marcus of his own rapture at the piano.


Just then, Rylie's hands fell silent and she twisted around, sharply calling out, "Who's there?"


Marcus, catching sight of her and feeling an uncanny connection, blurted the words before he could think;exclaiming,"My sister!"
###Chapter 21 Taking Their Breath Away




A flicker of uncertainty crossed Rylie's face. She lowered the piano lid, rising from the bench. "Your sister? Me? You must be mistaken."


Marcus snapped out of his reverie and asked, "I am sorry. Maybe I have your name?" "Rylie Kirk," she replied calmly.


Rylie Kirk? He remembered that his grandfather was sitting in a hospitaI room, waiting anxiously for a DNA match. The name on those records was the same:Rylie Kirk.


All the signs lined up now. The way she played,the striking features- he couldn't shake the feeling that she was family. Even so, Brad's advice came back to him. No matter how convincing, they couldn't reach out until every detail was confirmed. A false step could destroy everything.


Carefully hiding his excitement, Marcus adopted a gentle tone as he drew closer. "Forgive me, Miss Kirk. I lost my head for a moment. You resemble my sister so much. That piece - I've never heard it before. Is it something you wrote?"


Rylie gave her head a quick shake. "No, it isn't original. I came across a ruined score and did my best to restore what I could."


That revelation left Marcus speechless for a moment.Pieces like that were often the remnants of great composers, their legacies nearly erased by time.Bringing one back required uncommon skill.


"You pieced it together yourself?"


She nodded. "I did. Is that strange?"


Marcus only smiled and shook his head. "Not at all.Actually, it's impressive."


Rylie responded with a quiet laugh, modest as ever,"I'm hardly impressive. If I stand next to you, Mr.Marcus Owen, I'd barely be noticed."


His eyebrows shot up in mild surprise. "So you recognize me?"


She released a gentle sigh, amusement in her voice."Do you really think anyone interested in music wouldn't?"


Their quiet exchange came to an abrupt end when a breathless student burst into the music room,invitation in hand. "Rylie! Mr. Dury sent this for you!"


The moment he noticed Marcus standing there,something about Marcus' commanding presence erased any hint of ridicule from his face. He offered the envelope to Rylie, then added, "There's a banquet at the Kirk residence tomorrow. They want you there to settle the issue with Mr. Dury- about your engagement.Attendance is required."


Rylie's brow furrowed. As if dealing with Stacey wasn't exhausting enough, now Fred had to step in as well. The two of them were making it painfully obvious that they wanted her out of the picture.


She let a sarcastic smile play on her lips and replied,"Message received."
Not daring to linger beneath Marcus' intense gaze,the messenger quickly bowed his head and made a hasty exit.


A note of concern crept into Marcus' voice. "You're still studying, but they expect you to marry?"


Shouldering her bag, Rylie started for the door,pausing only long enough to glance over her shoulder. "No wedding-just a cancellation."


The surprise on Marcus' face was unmistakable."Wait, so the Dury family is calling off the engagement? Anyone can see you're worth more than that," he retorted, his tone shifting fromn gentle to indignant.


There was something strangely comforting about a stranger speaking up on her behalf. Rylie's smile,though faint, was tinged with irony. "There's not much to it. I'm just the unwanted stand-in, so none of this should shock you. Anyway, if you want some time with the piano, go ahead. I have to be somewhere."
She didn't offer any further explanation. With that,Rylie slipped past Marcus and disappeared down the staircase, leaving her parting words echoing behind her.


Out of the blue, Kendrick's call came through,brimming with enthusiasm. "Marcus, the search is over - we've located your sister! Wrap up your concert and head straight to Crolens!"


A jolt of anxious hope surged in Marcus. "Is her name Rylie Kirk? She's enrolled at the medical university,isn't she?"



"That's right," Kendrick admitted, only to catch himself. "Wait, you already tracked her down? Why would you go ahead and find her before I'd even arranged a proper welcome?"


For an Owen, bringing a lost family member home was an occasion for the grandest reception. Marcus understood this tradition perfectly and quickly covered his tracks. "Until you told me, I wasn't sure if she is an Owen, so l didn't tell her anything about this. I did learn, though, that she's somehow tied to the Dury family through an engagement."


Kendrick's initialjoy turned to disbelief, his voice rising. "You're telling me she is engaged to that fool from the Dury family?"


Right then, Felix happened to be resting in his hospital bed as Kendrick spoke. Hearing the commotion, Felix chimed in, "From what I know,there's been a strong alliance between the Kirk and Dury families. When I heard about my sister's engagement, I gave the Dury family hundreds of millions to support their Crolens project as a wedding gift."



Marcus' response was grave. "The gesture was wasted. The Dury family doesn't see her worth.They're planning to call off the engagement-claiming she's not good enough for them."


Guilt and outrage mingled in Kendrick's chest. "How dare they! Who are they to look down on my granddaughter? Marrying into the Dury family would be a disgrace for someone of her standing!"
Felix's face tightened with frustration. "That was not the outcome I wanted."


With quiet conviction, Marcus added, "Having met her, I can say with certainty - she's anything but worthless. Rylie's talent speaks for itself."


Felix's tone hardened. "No one gets to trample on the Owen family. If the Dury family can't recognize her value, there's no need for us to continue any partnership with them."






Time flew by, and before long, the Kirk residence bustled with anticipation for the upcoming banquet.


The Kirk family pulled out all the stops, extending invitations to a throng of reporters in honor of Stacey's homecoming.


A picture of familial bliss seemed to fill the room-at least, for everyone but Nicolas, who was lying in the hospital bed.


Stacey shifted uneasily in her seat. "It's such a shame Nicolas couldn't be here," she murmured, a note of regret in her voice.


Her mother, Tessa Kirk, gently brushed her hair from her forehead, her tone soft but edged with disappointment. "I could never have predicted, after raising Rylie for so long, that she would end up harming her own brother."


Across the room, Stacey's father, Casper Kirk, spoke,his voice carrying a colder weight. "You can take a child out of poverty, but you can't take the poverty out of the child. Frankly, we've shown restraint by not pressing charges against her."


Leland's eyes lingered on his parents. Watching them rally behind Stacey, he opened his mouth as if to protest-then simply let the words die on his lips.


A shout broke the tension. "Rylie's arrived!"


All eyes turned toward the entrance, anticipation crackling in the air. The crowd parted, but instead of a poised debutante in formalwear, an unexpected sound cut through the chatter - a motorcycle's
 deep-throated growl.


A matte-black bike tore into view, tires spinning into a dramatic stop just outside the banquet hall. Every head craned for a better look as Rylie coolly dismounted.


She removed her helmet, ran a hand through her wild hair, and strode forward - her black leather jacket and tailored pants setting her apart in a sea of gowns and tuxedos. That sharp pop of color on her lips,paired with her striking features, left more than a few young men momentarily speechless.


The gentlemen present, accustomed to the delicate manners of society's finest daughters, found themselves riveted. Here stood a woman who owned both elegance and defiance in every gesture,radiating a confidence that set her apart.


Fred, moments away from making the breakup official, found his attention completely captured by Rylie's entrance. He stared, caught off guard, until Stacey pinched his arm hard enough to snap him back.
Startled, Fred pasted on a reassuring smile for Stacey, but his mind was elsewhere.


Everyone remembered Rylie as the girl who hid beneath oversized sweatshirts. But tonight, she had shattered that image entirely - taking their breath away as she claimed the room for herself.


Rylie climbed the grand staircase, her leather jacket and fitted pants drawing every gaze in the hall-she was an undeniable outlier among the crowd of polished socialites. She nonchalantly blew a bubble with her gum, strolled right up to the Kirk family,and said, "I'll only be a couple of minutes. I need to grab something from upstairs."


Without waiting for a reply, she turned on her heel and disappeared into her old bedroom.


Tessa's composure snapped as she watched Rylie's retreating figure. "Just look at her outfit! This is the night Stacey's recognized as our daughter, and Rylie can't even pretend to act with dignity!"


But Phillip's focus wasn't on her clothes. He was squinting out the window at the motorcycle parked by the entrance, his voice sharp with suspicion."She's going too far these days. Where on earth did she get the money for a bike like that?"


Leland interjected, brow furrowing in warning,"Enough, Phillip. This isn't the time for wild accusations."



Phillip bristled, refusing to back down. "You clearly don't get it. That bike outside? It's a rare model -costs at least two million. Since she's no longer with the family, I'd like to know what trick she pulled to afford it."
###Chapter 22 Rylie's Connection To The Kirks Ends Here
Stacey cut in without a pause, saying, "Phillip,you need to stop with these wild claims. Rylie isn't the type to steal money from us or sell herself. She must have made money through rightful ways."


From the outside looking in, what sounded like a defense actually hinted at something less charitable about Rylie.


Casper's anger burned so hot that he felt pain in his chest. "At first, I hoped Rylie could settle in Crolens,but if she keeps carrying the Kirk name, she'll ruin our standing. She cannot stay here."①


A small, self-satisfied smile crept across Stacey's lips as she lowered her eyes.


The moment Rylie walked back into the room,contemptuous stares greeted her from every corner.
In full view of the guests, Casper confronted her."Rylie, look at the trouble you've brought us. Admit what you did, then offer your apology."


Whispers filled the air as the guests watched,eager for the drama to unfold.



Yet Rylie remained poised, her face unreadable. "My visit was by your request. I didn't come here to put on a show of regret."



Casper's outrage flared. "There's no hope for you!Your brothers had every reason to drive you out!"


With a deepening scowl, Tessa said, "I made it here today just to make one thing clear: Stacey is our daughter now. Rylie, there's nothing you could say or do to change that-"


Tessa's words were cut short as Rylie lifted a box and revealed an emerald necklace. "This necklace was given to me by your mother. I'm returning it to you,Stacey." She set the box in Stacey's hands, then brought out a brooch. "Here's the limited edition brooch Nicolas gifted me as a child. You should have it now."



Next came a delicate ring. "This pink diamond ring,from Leland, is yours too."


Finally, she held out a smnall trophy. "And the trophy Phillipo gave me after his first win-take it as well."


After passing the entire collection into Stacey's hands, Rylie spoke up. "Everything here belongs to you now."



Outrage flashed across Phillip's face. "That trophy marked my first win on the track, and you hand it over without a second thought?"



Without responding, Rylie shoved every keepsake deeper into Stacey's grasp.



The Kirk family grew tense, their rigid postures betraying the shock of realizing that Rylie had retrieved each piece just moments earlier.



Stacey faltered, struggling to find her words. "Wait Rylie,these are yours. I can't accept them..."
Offering no comfort, Rylie replied, "Enjoy your new title as the Kirk family's real daughter."



Lifting her voice, she made a public announcement to the assembled crowd. "Let everyone here be witness. I was never part of the Kirk family, nor will l ever be."



Ironically, the words that everyone expected the Kirks to say to Rylie ended up coming from her instead,leaving the room unsettled.


A moment later, Rylie fixed her gaze on Fred. "And one more thing. I want nothing to do with a fool. Fred,you and Stacey make a lovely pair. I'm breaking off our engagement right now. Kirk family, stop pestering me - your constant meddling has become intolerable."



By saying this, she cast Fred in an unfavorable light and didn't spare Stacey from insult either.


Instead of basking in celebration, Stacey found herself overshadowed by Rylie's decisive stand.
Word of the scene immediately damaged the Dury family's reputation, prompting Fred to snap back."You dare call me a fool? Take a look at yourself,always trailing behind me like some desperate country girl. The truth is, I've always preferred someone like Stacey. If anyone is ending this engagement, it'll be my decision, not yours!"


A voice from the crowd piped up right away. "You know, the Dury family just landed a three hundred million contract with the Owen family, and everyone says Mr. Dury himself closed the deal. Honestly,with that kind of skill, Rylie must have lashed out from pure envy."


Fred puffed out his chest, eager to imnpress. "Soon enough, our family will join Crolens' social elite. Rylie,do you honestly believe you measure up to me?You're better off returning to that little town and your uneventful life."



Tessa, seeing how unyielding Rylie had become,refused to tolerate her anymore. Clutching Stacey close, she addressed the guests in a clear unwavering tone. "Let it be known, the engagement with the Dury family was always meant for the Kirk family's rightful daughter. No impostors, no confusion. Stacey is my real daughter. Rylie's connection to the Kirks ends here."



Without warning, Leland broke the tense silence."Rylie, if you could just change your attitude toward Mom, nothing's stopping you from coming back.Things could go back to how they were."


A flicker of hurt flashed in Stacey's eyes as she heard Leland's plea. Trying to hide her disappointment, she put on a sympathetic front. "If you want, Rylie, I'm willing to step aside. I've known all along how you feel about Fred. Stop fighting us,and he's yours."


Laughter escaped Rylie as she looked them over, a trace of mockery in her gaze. "Don't bother. Like I said,you and that fool are a perfect match."


Casper's temper snapped. "Rylie! Walk out that door and you're out for good!"
Not even pausing, Rylie strode away, leaving no sign of regret behind.


Watching her go, Tessa struggled to process the finality of it all. Pain shot through her legs, and she clung to Stacey for support."Ah..."


Swiftly, Leland moved to steady Tessa by her other arm, concern written all over his face. "Are you alright,Mom?"


A sharp ache shot through Tessa's legs. She clenched her jaw and called out, "Bring me my medicine at once."



One of the servants shuffled forward, uncertainty in her voice. "Madam, you finished the last dose yesterday. There's nothing left for today."


Displeasure flared in Tessa's eyes. "Why wasn't it ready ahead of time? Do I have to remind you every single time?"



Casting a worried look toward the doorway where Rylie had just vanished, the servant spoke quietly.
"Miss Rylie Kirk was always the one who handled your medicine. Without her, no one here knows the exact recipe."


That revelation left Tessa speechless. Despite having severe rheumatism for years, Rylie had carefully mixed the medication for her each time it was needed. Therefore, she had nearly forgotten about the seriousness of this illness.


As she noticed her mother's sudden silence,Stacey's heart skipped a beat. She moved in to comfort Tessa with a gentle embrace. "It's alright,Mom. I'll do everything Rylie once did. I'll work hard to study medicine with the teachers-and even with Rylie herself if she'll let me- until I can heal your legs."


Tessa's heart swelled with gratitude at her daughter's devotion. "Stacey, you're so much better than Rylie ever was. I have faith you'll restore my health."



While watching this emotional moment between these two people, Leland couldn't quiet the unease growing inside him. He suspected that letting Rylie walk away from the Kirk family would be a mistake none of them could ever undo.







Outside, Rylie barely made it past the Kirk estate gates before a sudden roadblock forced her to stop.A chorus of shouting echoed overhead.


Her gaze swept across the street, where a fleet of sleek Maybachs lined the curb, their uniform presence interrupted only by five helicopters descending from above, blades roaring before settling neatly nearby.


Luxury cars were no strangers to the Kirk neighborhood, but an entire parade of rare Maybachs, paired with helicopters, made even Rylie pause-she had never seen such extravagant power on display.


Believing that she could simply steer around and that it was just another wealthy family showing up, she tried to skirt the blockade. However, dozens of  IL bodyguards emerged from the cars, dressed in perfectly fitted suits and earpieces, arranging themselves in two rigid rows that blocked her path entirely.


Suddenly,the helicopter doors swung wide, and each pilot exited with brisk efficiency, assembling in a neat row while their attention fixed on the central craft.



A glimpse of finely tailored suit pants appeared first as someone stepped onto the landing pad. Emerging from the helicopter, a tall figure radiated authority-his tailored ash-gray suit perfectly matched his striking good looks and refined presence.


Deliberately closing the distance, he approached, his voice carrying a rich, smooth timbre. "You must be Rylie Kirk?"
###Chapter 23 Her Real Family
News of the Owen family's recent search for a missing sister in Crolens drifted through Rylie's mind,giving her a hunch about this stranger, though she wasn't fully convinced. "Are you supposed to be my brother?" she questioned, voice uncertain.


A step closer brought the man within arm's reach. He leaned in just enough to flash a warm grin."You beat me to it, Rylie. It's a pleasure meeting you-Deandre Owen,your brother."①


No words sprang to Rylie's lips; she just stared,momentarily stunned.


Glancing at the impressive lineup of luxury vehicles,she eventually said, "The Kirks always told me my parents lived somewhere remote and unremarkable."


That story didn't match up with the immense wealth on display. Rylie couldn't  reconcile the image of the Owens with the idea of a family tucked away inobscurity.


Taking a beat to gather his thoughts, Deandre offered an explanation. "In a sense, you're not entirely wrong. Our great-grandfather's estate sits tucked away in the mountains, far from the city. The old Owen homestead has actually been turned into a museum these days."


Rylie needed a moment to process that, letting the silence stretch between them.



Sensing her hesitation, Deandre smiled again and explained, "Grandpa insisted I make your first homecoming something special. The whole convoy and helicopter crew? That's just a small welcome party, nothing too extravagant."


She let her gaze travel along the endless procession of vehicles and gave a measured nod. "It's impressive."


While most would have been speechless at such a show of power, Deandre found himself surprised by how unfazed his sister seemed.
His attention shifted to the motorcycle beside her."We'll head home now. I'll have someone take care of your bike and see it safely delivered."


"Alright, let's go," Rylie answered, without missing a beat.


Just as she climbed into the helicopter, another passenger caught her eye.


Spotting a familiar figure, she blinked in disbelief."You're here too?"


Brad lounged comfortably in the seat, one leg crossed over the other. The sharp lines of his designer suit only emphasized his striking build.Shadows danced across his face, but as he tilted forward, the chiseled set of his jaw came into view.


Brad leaned back with a hint of a smile. "Deandre used my convoy for the day, so l decided to come along."


Curiosity sparked in Deandre's eyes. "So, you two already know each other?"
Rylie found her place in the seat and answered, "You could say that."


Deandre continued, offering some context,"The Owen family doesn't have many resources here in Crolens. Most of the time, we stay away. Only the Morgan family keeps such a large helicopter fleet, so Brad was generous enough to let us borrow it."


With his high rank in the navy, Brad was always surrounded by security. Admirals like him, constantly targeted by enemies, needed this level of protection on every trip.


A silent nod from Rylie showed that she understood.She kept her relationship with Brad to herself in the presence of the Owens.


Once the helicopters began to ascend and the convoy snaked its way out of the neighborhood,guards at the villa community swung every last gate closed.


Normally, only the front entrance would be in use,but today, the Owens' procession required every gate to be thrown open just to clear the path.


A small group of security staff clustered near the fence, murmuring among themselves, "If my eyes didn't deceive me, that was the Kirk girl who just got ousted-she's the one leaving by helicopter."


Media coverage had turned Rylie's exit intoheadline news for all to see.


One of the guards glanced from his phone to the sky,recognizing Rylie's motorcycle being loaded up."Word around here is she's not even a Kirk by blood.Her real folks supposedly live out in some poor village."


Another shook his head at the spectacle. "If that's true, this kind of sendoff doesn't fit at all. Her real family must be a big deal."


A third guard chuckled under his breath. "Well, if that's the case, the Kirks will have plenty of regrets soon enough."

 
While these whispers carried through the security post, inside the Kirk estate, the family focused on entertaining their guests, unaware of the gossip just outside. They did, however, notice the helicopters slicing through the sky above their mansion.


No one in the Kirk family paid much attention,missing the fact that the helicopters had anything to do with Rylie. Once the formal announcement of Stacey and Fred's engagement was made, Casper turned to Fred and asked with practiced politeness,"I heard you locked down a three hundred million dollar deal with the Owens. Is there a chance we could join in?"



Fred responded without missing a beat, "That's what I hoped for as well, but the partnership is a hefty commitment. The exact terms still need to be hammered out with the Owen family. If you'd like to collaborate, I'm happy to put in a good word for you."



Excitement shone in Casper's eyes. "That's excellent news! | appreciate it!"
Deep within Crolens stood Serenity Manor, a name known only to the city's elite.


Tucked into the heart of the city's most valuable real estate, Serenity Manor stood apart- a sanctuary where just four families held the central grounds,with a handful of smaller homes scattered beyond.


Grand estate-style residences dominated the landscape, each one private and discreet,surrounded by breathtaking vistas. The cost of entry was so high that only the country's wealthiest could hope to call this place home.


Not long ago, Rylie had come here once, when Brad needed her medical expertise.


Touching down on the helipad beside a vineyard,she stepped out to a striking welcome -- rows of staff and guards formed an honor guard, voices ringing out as one. "Welcome home, Miss Owen!"


Trailing after her, Deandre exclaimed, "Grandfather purchased this place years back, hoping you'd spend holidays and summers with us. When you disappeared, the manor felt empty, almost haunted.None of us wanted to return, so we left everything in the care of distant relatives."



Rylie nodded. "I understand."


With a bittersweet ache, Deandre studied the calm strength in her face. "What you missed, we'll make sure you have again."


From the helicopter, Brad watched as Rylie walked away. He made a quick call, instructing, "Send a gift on my behalf to the neighboring villa when you get the chance."



Meanwhile, life carried on at the main Owen estate.


Kendrick claimed the main seat on the expansive sofa, leaning heavily on his cane while his gaze lingered at the front entrance. A circle of relatives-Felix, Marcus, and several others-clustered around him,filling the room with anticipation.


A rare occasion had drawn every branch of the Owen family together, all eager to witness Rylie's homecoming.


Tension crackled in the formal hall as Paola Garrett leaned over, her voice just a whisper. "Rylie's spent so many years away. She must have gone through a lot."


On her left, a teenager whose features mirrored hers wore a deep scowl, muttering, "Do we know how long she'll be staying?"


Glancing at her mother, Paola replied in a low voice,"However long she remains, this is still her family. We owe her kindness. After all, she's our cousin."


Her gentle assurance drifted through the room,catching Kendrick's attention."Paola, your poise and grace continue to impress me," he remarked.


Blushing at the praise, Paola replied, "Grandpa,I learned it all from you and my cousins."


Her magnanimity and elegance stemmed from not considering the returning cousin a threat.


Stories had spread that Rylie came from humble beginnings, lacking the polish of the city. Such rumors only reinforced Paola's place - Rylie's presence would highlight her own charm and standing even more.


While Kendrick offered his compliment lightly, his eyes never left the threshold. At last, the long wait ended as two silhouettes appeared in the doorway.


Deandre's voice rang out clear and bright."Everyone, Rylie has come home!"
###Chapter 24 Returning To The Owen Family
Everyone turned to see what the commotion was about.



Most of the Owen relatives, except for Rylie's brothers, expected her to look rough and run-down because of where she came from. What they saw instead left them stunned.



Rylie walked in wearing a leather jacket and fitted black pants. Her skin looked so smooth that it almost glowed. Her features, sharp yet graceful, mirrored her brothers'.


Considering how Felix, Marcus, and Deandre each had the kind of looks people remembered,it was only natural that Rylie had a striking face too.


Paola's heart dropped. Her fingers curled tightly over her knees.
"Oh, my sweet granddaughter!" Kendrick couldn't hold back anymore. He pushed himself up with his cane and stretched a hand toward her. "Come here,quick. Let me really see you."


The two men standing beside him-Rylie's brothers -were clearly trying not tocry.


Rylie hadn't known family love in years. Kendrick's warmth felt unfamiliar but comforting. His wrinkled hand clutched hers with surprising strength.


"You're finally here," he said. Tears welled in Kendrick's eyes. "If I hadn't found you, I wouldn't know what to say to your parents when I see them again."



Rylie didn't know what to say. But the way he held her hand made her feel something she hadn't in a long time. She leaned closer and said gently,"Grandpa."


"Oh, my dear girl!"


That one word undid him. His heart felt full, like he could hand her everything he had and still want to give more.


"I'm Felix. I'm your oldest brother." Felix sat on the sofa, his voice soft with emotion. "Can you believe my own sister ended up saving my life? That has to be fate."


Rylie remembered the carved token that he had given her. She gave him a nod and asked, "Weren't you supposed to be in the hospital for surgery? What brought you back?"


"I didn't want to miss this," said Felix, his tone calm."We've looked for you for so long. I've waited years for this moment. The surgery can wait. A few days won't hurt."



She hadn't expected anyone to care so deeply.Maybe this was what having a real family felt like. Her voice turned soft. "Thanks, Felix. But your health matters more."



"I'm here too," said the second man, stepping up.

"I'm Marcus." Marcus greeted her with a warm hug, polite and kind. "I knew it was you when I saw you at school. I just knew it. Turns out, what I said at that time was right-you're indeed my sister."


Rylie gave him a quiet smile in return.


The last one was her third brother, the one sent to bring her home. Rylie turned toward Deandre and gave him a warm smile.


Kendrick's face lit up. "What a blessing. All my grandchildren, finally together."


Just then, Laurel Garrett, Rylie's aunt, broke the moment. "Now that Rylie's back, will she stay here in Crolens or return to Kouhron?"



That was when Rylie noticed another family seated nearby. Kendrick gestured toward them. "That's your aunt Laurel Garrett, and with her are her children Paola and Percy."①


Paola rose with grace and gave Rylie a polite smile."It's lovely to meet.you."


Percy Garrett stood up as well, though far less eag Kendrick turned back to Rylie with a gentle voice."Would you rather stay here for now, or come back to Kouhron with me?"



Rylie thought of Brad, stilI waiting for her care. She answered softly, "I'll stay in Crolens for now.I haven't finished my studies."


Kendrick gave a quiet nod. "Then I'll stay here too."He turned toward Laurel. "Have the rooms been arranged?"



Laurel hesitated, caught off guard. She hadn't expected Rylie to stay. Paola quickly spoke up."Mom's already making plans to convert my piano room into Rylie's bedroom."



Laurel gave Paola a nod of approval. "Yes, we've already started."


Percy's reaction was swift. He frowned and said,"Why not just use the guest room? Why touch Paola's piano room? She's been working on a film score for Director Spencer Aguilar."
Spencer's films were always major hits, and his opening music drew huge attention.


Laurel raised her eyebrows, pretending to be surprised. "So Paola's gotten that good? No wonder she's been skipping meals and locking herself in that room."


Paola glanced quickly at Marcus, then answered in a quiet voice. "Marcus inspired me. That's the only reason I got this opportunity."


Laurel turned back to Rylie. "Since Paola needs the piano room - how about we place you in the guest room for now? If you don't like it, we'll find you another. Just say the word."


"Mom, I really don't mind. My work is just a small matter." Paola forced a gracious tone. "Let Rylie take the piano room. She's been away for years. I'm sure she hasn't had a proper rest in a long time."


By echoing Percy's words, she meant to make herself sound generous and kind-hearted. But things didn't unfold quite how she planned.
###Chapter 25 Familiar Manipulative Tactics

Rylie didn't hesitate to cut Paola off, saying, "That won't be necessary. I have no plans to sleep in the guest room. I'll be heading home tonight."


Her intentions were clear - she had come only to acknowledge the family bond, not to get tangled in the games that came with old money.


"A simple dinner is all I'm here for," Rylie suggested."There's something else I need to take care of later."


As soon as Percy uttered "guest room," Kendrick's face grew thunderous. His voice stiffened. "Guest room? Are you telling me my granddaughter is relegated to the guest roomn in her own house?"


Felix's gaze turned cold too as he leveled it at Percy."Have you forgotten whose name is on this deed?You and Paola live here by my grace. Every meal,  every luxury, comes from my pocket. My sister comes home, and you think her room is up for debate?"



Deandre's tone was sharp, his glare colder still. "It seems running this estate has gone to your head,Percy. You're suggesting my sister should take the piano room as if she needs a handout from Paola?"


Neither of Rylie's brothers would stand by and watch their newly returned sister slighted by relatives acting above their place.


Paola's hands shook, color drained from her cheeks."No, I swear, that wasn't my intention - I never meant to treat Rylie like a charity case."


A dismissive snort came from Deandre. "If that's so,then why not pack your things and clear out of the room yourself?"


Paola's mouth fell open in shock. "What do you mean? Where am I.supposed to stay...?"


Marcus gave a mild smile, his voice smooth yet edged with quiet mockery. "You'll be fine in the piano room. You're composing for the film, aren't you? lt makes sense not to move your instrument around.Besides, the master suite you've been using always belonged to my sister. Giving it back is just putting things right."


Outrage exploded from Percy as he jumped to Paola's defense. "Marcus, Deandre, why are you picking on her? She's on track to be a musician,Marcus, just like you! Isn't that more impressive than someone who grew up in the sticks and just got here? You're just playing favorites!"


Laurel, recognizing that Percy had gone too far,gave him a quick smack on the arm and hissed, "That's enough out of you! Don't be ridiculous!"


Percy, refusing to back down, retorted, "Why are you coming after me? I'm just telling it straight. This place has plenty of rooms-why kick Paola out the minute Rylie walks in?"


Paola, struggling to mask her embarrassment, cut in before the argument escalated further. Turning to Rylie, she softened her voice. "Your brothers are right, but Percy doesn't mean any harm. He only wants to look out for me. If you'd prefer the piano room or my bedroom, you're welcome to it."


Watching the way Paola maneuvered, Rylie couldn't help but think of Stacey's familiar manipulative tactics. For a moment, she was left at a loss for words.



Switching tactics, Paola put on a show of indignation and snapped at Percy. "Percy, apologize to Rylie.She's your cousin."


A sneer curled on Percy's lips. "Cousin? That's a stretch."


At that instant, Kendrick-having had quite enough - slammed his cup down so hard that water splashed by Percy's feet. The sharp sound made Percy flinch. Without a hint of warmth, Kendrick flicked the water from his hand and delivered a cold stare. "By blood, she is my granddaughter. Not worthy of being your cousin? You'd do well to remember where you come from."
Those words alone were enough to turn Percy from defiant to instantly meek.


"Kendrick, I...I am sorry. I made a mistake."


Kendrick's tone turned colder than before. "Serenity Manor was purchased for my granddaughter's comfort during vacations. Paola, you've had the run of this place for more than ten years-tell me,havel ever treated you unfairly?" Whatever warmth he once felt toward her had vanished, his gaze steady and imposing.


White as a sheet, Paola shook her head in panic."Never, I swear. You and my cousins must have misunderstood me."



Laurel's face was just as tense. Pulling her children closer, she forced a smile in Rylie's direction. "I should have handled this better. Rylie is welcome to any room she wants - none of us will stand in her way."



Felix kept his voice even. "If that's settled, let's stop with the comments that cause confusion. Deandre, why don't you show Rylie around? Once the room's ready,she can move in."


With that, Deandre slipped an arm around Rylie's shoulders, his grin playful and conspiratorial. "Let's check out the vineyard. I'll let you pick the best grapes."


As she glanced at his hand, Rylie spotted an old scar,something oddly familiar she couldn't place.


Still deep in thought, she allowed Deandre to lead her toward the rows of vines.



Once they were gone, Kendrick declared, "Tonight marks my first dinner with Rylie. Have the kitchen prepare a variety of dishes so we can find out what she likes."



Laurel quickly agreed. "I'll see to it. Percy, help your sister gather her things so the staff can tidy up her room for Rylie."



Frustration followed Paola back to her quarters.

Rushing into Laurel's arms, she let her complaints
spill out. "Why does all their attention shift to Rylie the moment she comes home, no matter how hard I try?"


Laurel's hand landed softly on Paola's shoulder,her voice soothing but with an unmistakable edge. "You can point the finger at your father-being a branch of the Owen family means we're always left on the sidelines. He's never had much talent, and it's held us back. Still, Paola, I've raised you to the highest standards, not like Rylie, who grew up in a remote village. Your cousins are only caught up in the novelty of her return. When it comes to important occasions, they'll see you're the one who truly belongs as an Owen."



She lifted Paola's chin, gently dabbing at her tear-stained cheeks, her tone suddenly grave. "All you need to do is outshine Rylie in everything. Are you ready for that?"


A thrill of determination shot through Paola as she nodded."I won't let you down."
Meanwhile, among sun-dappled vines, Deandre plucked two heavy clusters of grapes, offering them to Rylie. "These are at their sweetest right now. Give them a try."


Popping a grape in her mouth, Rylie shifted the conversation, asking in a casual tone, "Deandre,where did you get that scar on your hand?"


A flash of pride lit up his smile under her gaze."Oh,that? It's nothing much. Got into a scuffle at a casino in Aclogow - a machete caught me when a fight broke out."


Her memory served her well. Just a year earlier,traveling with the Kirk family, she'd stumbled upoon that very brawl at an Aclogow casino, a clash involving the Costa Syndicate. She had seen Deandre defend a stranger, earning that very scar.


Lately, word had spread in the underworld. Rumors hinted that Alexis Costa, the notorious syndicate leader, was stepping down, but the new heir wasn't his son-it was an enigmatic figure from Kouhron.Soon after, the dark web blazed with a hundred-

million-dollar bounty on this mysterious successor's head.





Piecing together what she knew of timelines and aliases, Rylie had her suspicions- Deandre fit the puzzle as the shadowy candidate poised to inherit the Costa empire.


She also remembered how that online post had drawn a swarm of killers to the hunt, making Deandre the second most valuable mnark in the world. In short,danger was always closing in around him.
###Chapter 26 Brad's Gift
Deandre's gaze lingered on Rylie, catching the distant look in her eyes. "Hey, Rylie, what's on your mind? You seem a little lost," he asked gently.


A soft blink brought Rylie back, and she managed a small smile. "Oh, it's nothing really. I just can't help worrying about your safety. You're always in harm's way. Maybe it's time you had more people around you for protection."


Hearing the genuine concern in her voice seemed to lift Felix's spirits. He grinned with a hnt of swagger."You don't have to stress about me. I'm tougher than I look. Even Brad can't outmatch me-I promise you,I can hold my own."


Rylie gave a quick nod, but deep down, she wasn't convinced. In her mind, she resolved to have a few people track the Costa Syndicate and quietly bolster Deandre's security.
Finding someone who truly cared for her was a rarity,and she wasn't about to let anything threaten her family.


That night, the entire Owen family gathered to celebrate Rylie's return.


Every inch of the dining table was filled with dishes from across the country, each one more tempting than the last. Kendrick motioned for her to sit by his side, his tone warm. "Come, Rylie. See if there's something you like. If not, just say the word and I'll have the kitchen whip up anything you want."


She reassured him easily, "Honestly, I'm not picky-everything looks great."


She sipped her soup and couldn't help but appreciate how flavorful it was, but Laurel's sharp voice interrupted the calm. "Percy, how many times must I remind you not to make noise when you eat?Look at Paola.Learn some manners."


Percy responded, "Alright, I get it. I'll eat like a civilized person."
He cast a sideways glance at Rylie as he said it.


Across the table, Rylie's spoon tapped softly against her bowl just as Paola glanced over. Instantly, Paola straightened, perfecting her posture, sipping her soup with a kind of practiced grace that belonged in etiquette books.


Rylie watched, amused. Paola truly knew how to play the part. Sure, Rylie could do it too if she wanted-but there were better ways to spend her evening than obsessing over such unnecessary table manners.



If she wasted the whole night pretending to be a proper lady, she'd end up missing out on tonight's racing event.


Noticing the tension, Deandre quickly tried to break it. He grabbed his soup bowl and finished it off in a single gulp, then set it down a little too loudly, pulling a face. "We're family. It's just dinner- let's keep it real,yeah?"


Awkwardness crept into Laurel's features, though  she couldn't really argue against Deandre. "You're right, Deandre. I guess l've just always been strict with my own children. I've always asked them to be cultured all the time and-"


Deandre retorted, "So now, just because my bowl made a sound, I'm uncultured? Please. All these manners make me itch." Years spent running wild among rough company had left him immune to fake decorum- and he didn't want to see Rylie boxed in by such nonsense.


He gave Rylie's shoulder a reassuring pat. "Let my sister eat however she wants. She's fine just the way she is."



That statement seemed to rattle Paola. Her perfect posture and elegant manner suddenly felt awkward,out of place at a table where realness mattered more than etiquette. Even though Deandre and his brothers had always been the picture of politeness,everything changed when it came to Rylie.


A moment later, Kendrick tipped back his bowl and finished his soup with gusto, then wiped his mouth on his sleeve, not caring who noticed. "Back when l was young,whether I was working the fields or fixing engines for a few coins, I never cared about how l ate. Food tasted best when you just dug in. Life's gotten complicated..."


His gaze wandered over the table's perfect arrangements. "All these rules, and I still end up half-hungry."


Felix tried to defuse things with a gentle sigh."Grandpa, just eat how you like. Being comfortable is the important part."


Rylie felt warmth settle over her, knowing that her grandfather and brothers were on her side. She dropped her gaze and dug in, finally able to enjoy the meal.


With a fond smile, Kendrick looked at Rylie and addressed Paola directly. "Paola, don't get too hung up on manners. There's nothing wrong with having a healthy appetite, just like Rylie."


Paola forced a polite smile, her hand gripping the fork tightly. Suddenly, all that pride she felt for her perfect table manners felt hollow and out of place.


A hush fell over the room asthe doors swung open and a servant entered, saying, "The Morgan family has sent a gift."



Excitement flickered in Paola's eyes as she set her fork aside. "Is it from Brad?"



Percy chimed in, teasing, "I bet it's for you, especially since you're working on Spencer's new film score.Brad probably wanted to send something special."


A faint blush spread across Paola's cheeks. Brad,the boy next door, had always been her secret admiration - handsome, successful, the kind everyone noticed. Yet he rarely visited,and whenever he did, it was only for something important. Paola could only wish for more.


A gentle laugh escaped Laurel as she chimed in,"Just the other day, your father mentioned you to Brad. This is probably his way of saying congratulations."
Excitement bubbled in Paola as she carefully dried her hands and got to her feet. Trying to hide her eagerness, she turned to the servant. "What did Brad send?"



Stepping aside, the servant signaled for a second attendant to wheel in a cart.


Gasps filled the room when the towering eight-layer cake appeared, each tier more ornate than the last.


Perplexity furrowed Deandre's brow. "Why would Brad send a massive cake just for Paola?"



Though confusion flickered across Paola's face, she didn't let it diminish her happiness. After all, it was the first present Brad had ever sent her.


Percy explained, "Brad's always off somewhere and probably has no clue what girls really like. He must have figured a fancy cake was a safe bet."


Laurel broke into another warm chuckle. "It's a lovely gesture regardless. The decoration is so elaborate, it must have come from that top-tier bakery downtown.
And a cake of this size can't have been cheap."


Paola picked up the cake knife, ready to make the first cut, when the servant suddenly paused as if remembering something important. She hurried forward and fished two envelopes from her apron,looking flustered. "Forgive me, I nearly forgot. Mr.Morgan wrote two personal letters - one for Mr.Kendrick Owen and..."
###Chapter 27 Paid Attention To Her Every Word
Taking a close look at the second envelope, the servant studied the name before finally saying, "The other for Miss Kirk."


Paola's features went rigid. "Who did you say it's for?"



Disbelief flickered in Percy's eyes as he lunged for the letter. "What are you saying? How could that be for Rylie? She's only just arrived today. There's no way she even knows Brad."


His eyes caught the name. It was impossible to deny -it was for Rylie. "How could this be?"


Rylie had come from the countryside, returning to the Owen family for the first time today. The thought of her somehow knowing Brad made no sense at all.


Confusion clouded not only the Garretts, but also the
ens. No one could figure out why Brad would send Rylie a cake out of nowhere.


Disappointment crept across Paola's face as she read the name herself. All her earlier excitement now felt ridiculous. She forced a thin smile and looked straight at Rylie. "So, you and Brad already knew each other? Seems I made a mistake."


Laurel's usual calm was starting to crumble, leaving her with only an uneasy grin.


From the moment Rylie had seen the oversized cake,she suspected what was happening. Percy, though reluctant, surrendered the envelope to her.


With careful hands, Kendrick broke the seal and scanned the letter. The note explained how Rylie had spent her birthday at the Kirk family with Stacey. A frown darkened his brow as he tried to mask the pain, then he passed the letter to Felix. "To be honest, if it weren't for Brad, we never would have found Rylie. He wrote to congratulate me for reuniting with my granddaughter and clearly said the cake is meant for her."
Felix, after reading, handed the note to his brothers.His expression grew even grimmer. "Today isn't Rylie's real birthday. Her actual birthday falls on Christmas. There's no mistaking it."


Deandre, always the careful one, spoke up. "I've known Brad a long time, and he's never sent a birthday present to any girl before. Why is Rylie special the moment she walks back into our lives?"



A laugh slipped out of Marcus as he gave Deandre's shoulder a reassuring pat. "No sense worrying.Maybe Brad just wanted to be thoughtful."


Deandre's tone grew unyielding. "He's. never gone out of his way for anyone else, not once."


That remark struck Paola hard, making her squirm inwardly.


Brad's message to Rylie was nothing more than a brief, heartfelt wish: "Happy Birthday, Rylie."


Back when they had that dinner high above the city,he'd paid attention to her every word.
Aside from a handful of colleagues and her own patients, Rylie had never encountered someone who listened to her so closely-and acted on it.


A faint, wistful smile touched Rylie's mouth. "The Kirks picked the day they adopted me to be my birthday. For years, I marked the occasion, not realizing it wasn't the real one."


As Brad's letter crumpled in his grip, Deandre spoke with quiet resolve. "From now on, every single birthday, we'll celebrate in style. Count on it."


Gratitude filled Rylie's voice. "Let's slice the cake.Everyone should have a piece."


The sight of that cake grated on Paola's nerves. She excused herself quickly. "I'mstuffed. I'll be in the piano room working on music," she said, escaping the room.



Once everyone had enjoyed dessert, Rylie checked the clock and rose to take her leave.



Worry clouded Kendrick's features. He tightened his
 old on her hand. "W/hy are you heading out so late?Are you not happy spending time with us?"


Noticing the worry etched on her grandfather's face,Rylie offered a gentle smile. A touch of warmth entered her voice as she explained, "Of course I enjoy staying with you. I've got a race tonight. If l don't head out soon, I'll miss the start."


The mention of racing caught Kendrick completely off guard. "A race? You're a racer, Rylie?"


Grinning, she replied, "I am, and I'm actually pretty good at it!"


Deandre, curiosity piqued, chimed in right away, "Let me drive you over there."


Felix, however, held up a hand to intervene. "It isn't a good idea for you to be out right now. Marcus, you go with her."



Turning to Felix, Rylie said, "Felix, I can get there on my own. Just let Rory keep me posted about your surgery. I'd like to assist when it happens."
Felix looked stunned. "You'd do the surgery yourself? Aren't you still a student?"


Despite knowing his sister's skills, a little doubt flickered across his face. He worried that she was still gaining experience.


Rylie picked up on his unease and tried to put him at ease. "I won't be operating alone. I'll be observing while another doctor handles it."


Since Felix was now her brother, she felt that only by staying by his side during his surgery couId she feel at ease.


Eventually, Felix gave a nod, this time with full confidence. "If you want to get hands-on experience,go for it.I can handle it."


Her laugh was soft and sincere. "Thank you, Felix.That means a lot."



Before leaving, she promised Kendrick that she would come back soon. Just as she reached the door, her phone buzzed-Britton had messaged to  say that the race was moved to an off-road track three days ago and wanted to know her timne of arrival.


Rylie, riding her motorcycle, stopped just outside the estate. She checked the time and called Britton. "Put me last in the lineup. There's a chance I'll be late."


Suddenly, a high-end car slid past her, then eased back in reverse.


The window at the rear lowered, and Brad's striking features appeared. "Out this late-where are you off to?"



Catching sight of Brad, Rylie instantly saw her opportunity to make up for lost time. She left her bike on the curb and leaned against his car window."There's a race at the mountain circuit tonight. I have to be there by eight. Any chance you could help? I'll knock some off your next treatment bill."


Brad, although scheduled for an international meeting at the same hour, paused to check the time and quickly weighed his options.  "Hop in. I'll have a helicopter ready for you,"' Brad replied, making arrangements without hesitation.
###Chapter 28 I'll Watch The Race


Without uttering a single word, Rylie settled herself inside Brad's car.

Crolens' legendary winding mountain road, home to the World Racing Knockout Tournament, was notorious for its steep descent and endless hairpin curves-features that made the race daunting for even seasoned drivers.

Up above, a helicopter hovered, its blades slicing through a gentle drizzle as it made its way around the mountain.

Brad broke the silence, his tone even. "From what I've heard, this course hasn't seen a race in five years. Extreme elevation shifts put both drivers and their machines to the test. They also say the fatality rate is no joke."

Rylie stretched out in the seat, unfazed. "I'm impressed you're so well-versed in this track's reputation."

Brad turned, his eyes searching. "Feeling prepared? I haven't spotted your name in any major races before. Is this your championship debut?"

A ghost of a smile flickered on Rylie's lips, her eyes shining with quiet determination. "Officially, yes.But if we're talking experience, there isn't a soul here who can outdrive me."

No one who watched her could dismiss the authority she carried, despite her youth.

Rain had stopped at the foot of the mountain by the time the helicopter touched down. Already, the area buzzed with racers and eager onlookers.

Jumping from the helicopter, Rylie started to thank Brad, only to catch a shadow of emotion crossing his face as he lingered in the cabin.

Her gaze drifted skyward, and with a sudden motion, she dug out a candy from her bag, tore off the wrapper, and signaled from the edge of the aircraft. "Come here. Bend down."

Brad paused, weighing her request, then ducked down from the helicopter, curiosity clear.
His voice was steady. "What is it?"

Rylie pressed the candy gently to Brad's lips, her fingertip leaving a fleeting touch that unsettled him in ways that he couldn't explain.

Brock, the vigilant soldier assigned to Brad's security, sprang forward. "Sir! You really shouldn't accept food from anyone!"

Ignoring the protest, Rylie parted Brad's lips with practiced confidence and slipped the candy inside.Moisture from her fingers lingered briefly before she wiped her hand on her pants. "I made it myself.The medicine's aftereffects might still linger, especially with the altitude changes. This should help you adjust."

Instead,a cool burst of mint spread through Brad's mouth, soothing the pressure in his chest almost immediately.

He waved his hand to indicate to Brock that he was fine, his expression softening slightly."|tdoes help."

A quick grin flashed across Rylie's face."Time for me to go."

While she disappeared into the crowd, Brad's hand drifted to his mouth, and a quiet chuckle escaped him."Fascinating woman."

Subtle shifts in Brad's mood never escaped Rylie's attention, and she picked up on it instinctively.

Breaking the moment, Brock interjected, "General, the meeting's about to begin. Colonel's wondering why you aren't logged in yet. They're still waiting on your verdict about the Emerald Sea oil field."

Letting out a slow breath, Brad reclined in his seat. "Push it to midnight. Book a VIP suite overlooking the track-I'll watch the race from there."

Surprise flickered in Brock's eyes, and he blurted,e you planning to stay for Miss Kirk and take her home when she's done?"

A coolglance from Brad met his question. "Is there a rule against it?"
Brock kept his thoughts to himself, though he couldn't help but feel that his commander's interest in that remarkable doctor was becoming more obvious-even at the expense of a high-stakes meeting.

International waters near the Emerald Sea had recently yielded new oil reserves, and rival nations were already dispatching reconnaissance ships, raising tensions all around.

Brad seemed to read Brock's mind and simply remarked, "They can handle decisions on their own sometimes."

A heavy feeling dropped in Brock's stomach. "Then may you break every record, General-even for the next ten thousand years."




At the registration desk, Rylie caught sight of countless Phillip supporters in the stands, their banners waving proudly.

Stacey's admirers were there as well; despite being one of the youngest racers, she charmed the crowds and always drew the spotlight with her polished appearance at every ceremony.

Rylie glanced around coldly, already anticipating how Stacey might mess things up and how Phillip would face the fans' wrath after a crushing defeat.

Waiting at the entrance, Britton spotted her and quickly flagged down the officials. "She's here! Our last team member has arrived!"

From the registration area, members of Phillip's crew noticed Rylie too, shouting for Nicolas, "Look!Rylie actually made it! We thought she'd bail!"

For hours, Phillip's calls to Rylie had all gone unanswered, his temper rising with each attempt. Her appearance at the track now had him scoffing in triumph. "Of course she came. There was no way she'd miss the race."

He leaned toward Stacey, lowering his voice. "Since she's finally shown up, we stick to our usual plan.You'll run the anchor leg, Stacey. Rylie can handle the other segments."
###Chapter 29 Could Win First Without Me


Stacey hesitated. "Phillip, I've trained so long for this race. I don't think I'm any worse than Rylie. Why can't I be the one to compete?"

One of the crew chimed in, "Let Rylie handle it. She reacts better to sudden turns. Tonight's course is brutal-we're racing on a mountain road. We're just looking out for Stacey's safety."

Phillip nodded. "They're right. It's risky out there. I don't want anything to happen to you. Let Rylie do it.You'll still get credit either way."

Stacey didn't want to argue or take the risk. She faked a disappointed look and gave a small nod. "If that's what you think is best, Phillip, then okay."

Phillip gave her head a gentle pat. "I'll go sign Rylie up."

Britton was about to wave Rylie over when Phillip bumped into him on purpose. He narrowed his eyes."You're starting to act really smug."

Phillip gave a short glance. "Facing someone who always loses? | think I've earned it."

Britton raised a brow. "Don't start talking like a winner just yet."

Phillip ignored him and stepped forward, cutting Rylie off. "Didn't you say you weren't coming? So what are you doing here now?"

Rylie stared at him flatly. "Why do you care?"

Phillip clenched his jaw but said nothing at first. The race was about to begin, and he forced himself to stay calm. "If you insist on racing for my team, fine. I'll allow it. I'm letting the past go-even after how you treated Stacey. The race is starting soon. Go sign in. You'll be the backup."

Rylie gave a short, cold laugh. "Backup? Phillip, are you serious? Did I ever agree to race for you?"

Phillip's face froze. He raised his voice. "Then why are you at the sign-in booth?"

"Boss!" Britton suddenly stepped in between them, nudging Phillip out of the way as he grabbed  Rylie's arm. "You promised you'd race for us."

Phillip suddenly understood that Rylie had chosen Britton's team, and he nearly exploded with anger.
"Rylie! You're actually joining Britton's team! You do know he's our biggest rival this year, don't you?"

Rylie smirked. "Why are you upset? Didn't you brag that your team could win first without me?"

Phillip snapped, "But that doesn't mean you can join Britton's team. That's betrayal!"

"Betrayal?" Rylie's face turned cold. Her voice sharpened. "You aIl kicked me out. Your family disowned me in public. I was never part of you to begin with." If anything, they betrayed her first!

Phillip's mouth opened, but no words came out. His face burned with anger. "Fine. One last offer. Join my team and I'll split the prize money with you. I'll even let you stand on the podium."

"No thanks." Rylie brushed past Britton and walked straight up to Phillip. She met his eyes and said clearly, "I'm going to win this race. That trophy? It's mine. Not yours."

Phillip was fuming. All he could do was yell, "Unbelievable! You really think you'll win without being on my team? Rylie, you're going to lose-and badly!"

Meanwhile, Britton looked pleased as ever. He led Rylie straight to the sign-in area where she signed her name under his team.

Phillip's crew stared in disbelief. "What just happened? Why would Rylie choose Britton's side?"

Stacey spoke quietly."It's probably because I joined. Maybe she didn't want to be on the same team.Should I just drop out?"

Phillip snapped his head toward her."Absolutely not! You've been training with me all this time. It would mean nothing if you quit now."

Stacey's eyes welled up. "But Rylie doesn't want to be here. Maybe I should say sorry. Ask her to come back."

Phillip's voice rose. "No! I only asked her to race out of sympathy. We'll win with or without her."

Over on Britton's side, Rylie was welcomed with cheers. The team looked thrilled to have her.

Britton turned to her. "Boss, the mountain road's rough tonight. The weather shifts fast, and the cold hits hard. Which lap do you want?"

This race had six team members per side. Each one ran a full lap. The fastest team overall would win.

Back then, Phillip's side had always counted on Rylie to make up for Stacey's slow time.

Now, with worse weather and a tougher course, Rylie glanced toward Stacey and said, "Phillip's team probably kept her as the final lap. I flew in by helicopter. The top of the mountain's already raining.Roads are slick and freezing, and it's only going to get worse as we go."

Britton nodded. "So, you're taking the last lap."

Ryle gave a firm nod. "I am. I'll show Phillip exactly what happens when he puts the wrong person at the finish."

Britton grinned. "If you're driving the last leg, we're not losing."

The starting horn blared.

Lights flashed across the track.Excitement rippled through the crowd.

Jake Hardy, the first racer from Phillip's team, walked upto Rylie and spoke in a low voice. "We always saw you as family. What you did tonight really stung. Your brother's hurt. So are we."

Rylie didn't flinch. "You say I was family, but I've never been allowed on the podium. Not once."

Jake looked away. "I thought you weren't the type to care about that kind of recognition."

Rylie let out a laugh and flipped him off. "Recognition? Then why are you even racing for first? Just for fun? And if you're so above it all, why didn't any of you give me your spot on that podium?"
###Chapter 30 On The Final Leg


A hard glare settled over Jake's features as he retorted, "Rylie, you're acting completely reckless.Victory isn't yours to take, and don't come begging your brother for mercy when it falls apart." With those words, he pivoted and strode off.

Stationed at the helm of the command post, Rylie readied herself for the crucial final lap. She slid on her headset and spoke with authority. "Team, I'm shifting our tactics for this race. Let's pull together and give it our all."

Soon,in a blaze of red and green, the signal lights flickered-instantly, twenty cars thundered down the rain-soaked track, engines howling in perfect harmony. Sheets of rain poured from above, and every spin of the tires sent geysers of water shooting skyward.

Using every ounce of muscle from his modified engine, Jake lunged into the race, carving out the coveted inside lane.

Like a predator unleashed, his car screamed down the straightaway, edging out a clear advantage with half a car's length to spare.

Meanwhile, Britton's lead driver bore down, jaw clenched, fingers dancing across the wheel as he dialed in settings for maximum traction in the downpour.

"Turn three's a trap!" Rylie called out through the headset. "There's deep water ahead. Keep it steady and don't force your way through."

Without hesitation, her teammate responded and quickly adjusted his driving, "Roger that!"

Rylie had barely finished the warning before disaster struck-Jake's car lost its grip entering turn three, spinning helplessly across the slick surface and smashing into the guardrail in a shower of sparks.

All around the circuit, the commentator's excited voice reverberated from the hologram displays:"A shocking turn of events! Phillip's top driver has crashed in the opening lap!"

"How could this happen!" A surge of disbelief overtook Phillip. Fury boiling over, he slammed his fist against the pit rail, leaving a sharp dent in the alloy as metal groaned beneath his knuckles.

Stacey offered a shaky reassurance from behind, fingers nervously twisting the hem of her suit. "Don't worry, Phillip. We haven't lost yet."

Determination etched into his jaw, Phillip locked his eyes on the gap closing between Jake and Britton's lead. "Jake, do not let Britton's team claim the first lap advantage. They're closing in-find a way to hold them off!"

The message was crystal clear to Jake. All the other teams faded into the background; Britton's drivers were the only real threat. Buying time against them meant hope for victory remained.

Spotting Jake's strategic move, Rylie caught on immediately and warned, "Heads up - Jake's coming up behind you. He'll try something risky. Make room."

"But if I let him through, I'll lose momentum and forfeit our lead," the team's lead driver sneered, voice tight with uncertainty.

Rylie didn't flinch. "Trust the plan. We can sacrifice a little time-keeping everyone safe is the priority."

She understood all too well the kind of desperation that would drive Phillip to bend the rules.

Britton threw his support behind Rylie, saying, "You heard her-follow the boss."

Reluctance written all over him, the lead driver eased off, letting Jake slide ahead so they finished the lap neck and neck for third and fourth place.

Thunder rumbled as the race pressed on, and the rain only fell harder.

Cutting through the storm, Anna Foster-Britton's third driver- put on a masterclass in precision,nailing every drift in a series of S-curves and surging up to second place.

Britton's excitement was evident as he drummed his fingers across the screen. "Anna's tearing it up!We're only one and a half seconds from the lead now!"

From her post in the pit, Rylie wiped rain from her goggles, listening as Britton kept his eyes on the weather feed. "Looks like it's finally clearing up on the summit."

A thoughtful frown creased Rylie's brow. "I doubt it. When I flew in by helicopter, I saw a thick cloud mass building over the summit. I'd bet hail's on the way."

With a sly grin, Britton replied, "Their team's rookie hasn't raced in weather this brutal. If she ends up running the final lap like you predict, they're in rea trouble."

Earlier laps saw Britton's and Phillip's crews racingside by side, their times separated by mere fractions.

That neck-and-neck struggle was all part of Rylie's plan. She'd timed her last run to coincide with Stacey's, pitting them head-to-head and making any gap between them crystal clear.

By the time the fifth lap brought the field to the mountain's peak, the sky that looked promising just moments before had darkened. Only a dozen cars remained.

Raindrops thickened, transforming into marble-sized hail that hammered the vehicles with every hit.

"Boss, I can barely see ten yards in front of me!" the fifth driver, Chad Blake, reported shakily through the communicator. "Braking distance has increased at least threefold!"

Eyes fixed on the data, Rylie kept her composure. "Smooth on the throttle. Let your instincts guide you.Start slowing down a good 200 yards before turn seven-don't risk it."

Trusting her, Chad drew a steady breath, relying on his gut and his dashboard as he ghosted through the whiteout. His car slipped past Phillip's as if invisible, clawing into the lead and shrinking the gap to just 0.8 seconds.

Meanwhile, down in the pit, Stacey was already in her seat, helmet fastened, bracing for the handoff.Phillipo stepped over, his words hushed but urgent. "Stacey, weather's gone wild at the summit. We're trailing Britton by just 0.8 seconds. You have to make it up on this lap. It's all in your hands now."

A jolt of nerves shot through Stacey. Rylie had always carried the pressure before, buying her time in every relay. Now, everything was on her shoulders.

Jake, sweat still streaking his face, added his own push, replying, "Whether we clinch the win or not-i's on you, Stacey."

Uncertainty gnawed at her. She glanced up and asked, "What's happening on the summit? Is the weather still rough?"
A weary sigh escaped Phillip. "No, the weather's taken a turn for the worse. Hail's coming down hard,and you can barely see ahead. It's too late to swap drivers, so you have to stay sharp. But meanwhile,you can't let Rylie get past you. She's the only one standing in our way now."

Steeling herself, Stacey gave a resolute nod. Outwardly, she looked composed, but her grip on the steering wheel betrayed a faint tremor.

Why did Rylie have to be on the final leg as well? If she failed-especially against Rylie-how would Phillip see her? And what about the team, or all those fans cheering her on?
###Chapter 31 Die, Rylie


Across the track, Rylle pulled out her earbuds and walked straight toward her car-Black Mirage.

The vehicle had been sitting untouched in Britton's garage. Now, for this race, he'd finally rolled it out.

"I haven't touched the engine," Britton said. "It's still running exactly how you funed it last time." He gave a nod toward the new paint job. "Only thing I changed was the color. Looks sharp, doesn't it?"

Rylie gave the car a once-over. Satisfied, she climbed in. "Alright. Let's go."

The moment her car reached the starting line, the crowd began to murmur.

"That design... Doesn't it look like one of Revline's builds?"

"But Revline hasn't worked on a car in years. And this driver- she's a woman. That's rare."

Phillip spotted the car, and his face went tight. "How is this possible?"

Everyone familiar with racing cars knew that Revline's creations were rare. Their speed, their handling,the cost-nothing matched them. These machines sold for hundreds of millions.

If Rylie really had one, then Phillip had no idea how the race would turn out.

How was she connected to Revline? Why hadn't he ever heard of this?

But the questions had to wait. The fifth racer was already in view. His two sisters, Stacey and Rylie,were about to go head-to-head.

Stacey gripped the wheel so tightly that her knuckles turned pale. Her car gave a slight shake,not from the weather, but from her hands trembling on the controls.

"Three. Two. One! Go!"

Both engines roared to life. Stacey's pink custom slipped on the wet track. The tires spun out briefly before they found grip. Meanwhile, Rylie's Black Mirage blasted forward, slicing through the rain and grabbing half a car-length lead in seconds.
Phillip shouted from the sidelines, "No turbo lag? Are you kidding me?"

He hadn't been told that Rylie had already removed the speed limiter from her car.

At the first tur, Stacey dropped into third. Phillip clenched his fists and yelled, "Stacey! What are you waiting for? Step on it!"

Stacey tensed up the moment Phillip yelled. She saw Rylie pulling ahead, clenched her jaw, and slammed the gas pedal down hard.

"Disable the limniter! Rylie's the only one in your way- overtake her now!" shouted Phillip.

She followed the command and switched off the limiter. Her car responded instantly, gaining speed in seconds.

It surged forward and pulled alongside Rylie's vehicle. She glanced over, the adrenaline kicking in. Her competitive side roared to life. The turbines screamed as she pushed past Rylie.

"Nice move, Stacey!" came Phillip's voice in her ear.

Rylie didn't react. The lead didn't bother her. She had already noticed the drop in visibility.Hail had begun to fall. At their current speed, a single mistake could be costly.

Suddenly,hail peted Stacey's windshield. Her breath caught in her throat. She blinked fast, trying to see through the storm. In the mirror, she caught a glimpse of Rylie's car. It clung to the inside line, one wheel barely touching the ground, slicing close to the guardrail. She could tell that Rylie was going for the overtake.

Stacey immediately activated the mechanical button to prepare for another speed boost, but Phillip's warning came through her headset. "Your tires are worn from the high speed, and the cornering isn't great. Don't go too fast; just keep Rylie behind you and get through steadily."

"I can't!" shouted Stacey. "She's going wide on the turn, and I have to stay at this speed to make it through!"

A reckless thought surged through her mind. There were no barriers on this stretch. Just one small nudge at the edge could send Rylie's car flying off the cliff.

If Rylie crashed, every problem would disappear.
Rylie noticed what was happening. She saw the angle, the pressure, and the space narrowing.But she didn't flinch. She pressed the lever forward and floored the gas, preparing to take the bend.

"Is she insane?!" the commentator yelled. "That corner took out three racers last year! She's actually going for it!"

Stacey saw her shot and hit the brakes. The lights on her car flashed bright. In the pit, Britton's heart nearly stopped."Boss!"

Stacey's eyes burned with something wild. "Die, Rylie," she muttered under her breath.

In the VIP room, Brad sat motionless. His fists clenched in his lap. His face had gone cold and hard as ice.
###Chapter 32 Report


Stacey wanted Rylie gone.

But Rylie only smirked. The in-car camera caught her expression, calm and fearless. Without hesitation, she took her left hand off the wheel and flipped a switch on the center console.

Two sharp rows of ice spikes snapped out from under the chassis, stabbing deep into the road. The car clung to the turn like it was glued to the curve, barely missing Stacey's bumper by inches. Rylie slid past her with poerfect control and took the lead.

Just behind her-Stacey's car suddenly skidded at the same spot.

The high-end stabilizing system failed under the pressure of the hail. Her car spun hard, rotating like a toy top.

"No! No!" she yelled, slamming the brakes, but it only made things worse.

The vehicle slipped sideways toward the edge. Her rear tires lifted, hanging over nothing.

At the last second, a rescue hook fired from beneath the track and snagged her car by the frame.

"Phillip's Team Car No.6-rescue complete! The race continues!"

The crowd jumped to their feet. "Unbelievable save!"

Rylie's car shot down the track like a bullet and vanished into the storm.

Back in the pit, Phillip stared at the monitor. He didn't move. He didn't speak. Just one thought ran through his head-it was over.

By now, Rylie was fifteen seconds ahead. But the real threat hadn't hit yet.

A brutal crosswind tore across the peak of the mountain.

"Boss! Wind speeds have passed the safety threshold!" Britton called through the communicator."You should ease off-"
"Shuti." Rylie cut the line.

Her car pushed through the wind like à missile. The tachometer was already deep in the red. The engine roared, ready to blow.

Up ahead,something worse appeared. A jagged crack split open across the track.

The commentator's voice trembled. "Theroad's breaking apart from the cold! Officials justissued a red flag waming!"

Rylie didn't ease up.

Fifty yards before the crack, Rylie yanked the steering wheel upward.

The car lifted off the ground. With the help of the crosswind, it cleared a full 200 yards through the air.

All four shock absorbers blew out on impact, but she gripped the wheel tight and kept control without a hitch.

The crowd broke into roaring applause. The commentator, watching the clock, shouted, "If Britton's team sets a record tonight, it's all because of No. 6! She's tearing down the track like a rocket! Let's hope she makes it!"

"Fantastic!" said Brock, flashing a fist pump. He turned to Brad, who never took his eyes off the screen."Dr. Kirk's skills are on another level."

Brad's tense expression softened. His gaze followed the car with pride. He stood. "Let's go meet her."

While Rylie crossed the finish line cleanly, Stacey's car was just being hauled back onto the track. The final times appeared on screen. For Phillip's team, it was painful to see-one minute and twenty-eight seconds behind.

This wasn't just a gap; it was a chasm!

The commentator's voice took on a somber tone. "Who would've guessed the defending champions would drop all the way to eighth? A single mistake by No. 6, and their title slipped away. Tough break for the team."

Back in the pit, Stacey returned with her head down. She didn't dare look at anyone.
Phillip stormed up, yanked the car door open, and dragged her out. "I fold you to ease off! Are you brainless? You kept pushing it through that curve and then hit the brakes? Didn't I explain the tire wear situation to you clearly?"

Stacey hadn't expected him to snap in front of the whole crowd. Her cheeks burned.

"l just... I just didn't want Rylie to pass me. I thought I could hold the line! You're the one who didn't check the tires properly. That's why l lost control out there!"

Phillip's face turned red. "You're blaming me? After all this time, you're still driving like an amateur!You're the reason we lost!"

Stacey's anger flared. She shoved him back and started to walk away.

From the stands, soda bottles flew. The crowd shouted insults.

People had bet big. Phillip's team had always been the favorite. For years, they held the top spot. This time, expectations had turned into outrage.

Now that they weren't even in the top three, fans who lost money turned furious.

One bottle hit Jake square on the head. He stood up, furious. "This whole race was a setup! Someone from our side gave Britton's team everything - our strategies, our driving habits! That's the only reason they won. There's no other explanation!"

"I'm reporting this! This isn't fair!" Phillip, still seething, took Jake's words to heart. The idea struck him fast. Maybe he could get Rylie's results thrown out by the committee.

Hearing the commotion, fans started shouting too. They now demanded an investigation.
###Chapter 33 She Tried To Kill Me


News reached Britton's team, and Rylie heard it too. She let out a sharp laugh. "They want to investigate me? I haven't even dealt with what they did back then."

Out on the racetrack, the judges and drivers had already gathered. As Rylie arrived, someone from Phillip's team pointed at her. "She was our racer. She's been a key part of our lineup for years. She knows our system inside out."

Rylie crossed her arms, a bitter smile pulling at her mouth. "Is that so? Then how come my name's not listed among your champions?"

The judges went through the records. They found nothing. "In the official race entries, the only female member from your team was Stacey Kirk," one of them said. "Rylie appeared only as a substitute. She wasn't even technically qualified to race under regulation."

In the crowd, fans from Phillip's side started shouting for an explanation. They demanded answers from both the judges and Rylie. Some even threatened to have Britton's team disqualified.

The noise grew louder. Rylie grabbed the nearest microphone. A loud feedback screech cut through the tension. All eyes turned to her.

She looked at Phillip's team without flinching. "Yes, I raced with them. Every season. I was there from their very first win. But why is it only today, after | switched teams, that I broke a racing record? The truth is, I never got to finish an official race. I was always subbed in, just to stall for Stacey, so she could cross the line and take the win. They got the titles. They stood on the podium. I wasn't even allowed in the photo."

Her voice remained even as she continued, "The trophies were earned with my laps, but never meant for me.So why is it a crime to leave? Why should I stay loyal to people who never treated me like a real teammate? Britton gave me a real spot. I ran the final leg, I crossed the finish line, and I won a race that actually counted. If you were me, would you stay with Phillip's team? Or would you choose someone who saw your worth?"

Everything she said cut straight to the point. There was no defense left for Phillip's side.
People in the crowd were stunned.

They went back and reviewed old race data. Rylie had been in every championship. She was always the fastest one. She built their lead every year. In contrast, Stacey's results were consistently poor, always at the bottom. Had it not been for Rylie, who widened the gap with other racers, Stacey wouldn't have been able to win first place.

The crowd began to understand. "So Phillip's team kept winning, but never broke a record because Stacey was slowing them down."

"No wonder Rylie's lap shattered the record. She was the reason they won at all."

"And she wasn't even listed as an official member? No contract? No rules binding her? Then she's free to switch teams."

More and more voices turned on Phillip's team.

"What a joke. She carried them for years, and they didn't even let her on the podium."

"Same team, same race. Yet only Stacey got the spotlight. That's not a team. That's favoritism."

The crowd started calling them out. Members of Phillip's team stood frozen, their heads down,unable to respond.

Not long after, the judges made their ruling. Britton's team would keep their victory. Rylie's membership was confirmed as valid.

Phillipo had never faced such a crushing loss. But he had no way to deny it-everything Rylie said was true. He had never imagined that she would care so deeply about being left out.

The crowd wasn't quiet about it either. Every shout of "favoritism" landed squarely on him. They all accused him of choosing Stacey over Rylie.

Rylie dropped the mic without a word. She walked straight up to Stacey, lifted her hand, and punched her hard across the face. Gasps echoed through the stands. A few people stood and cheered. "Good hit! That freeloader had it coming!"

Stacey screamed as she hit the ground. Phillip rushed over, grabbed Rylie's arm, and held her back."Stop it,Rylie! What's wrong with you? We've already lost everything. Isn't that enough? What else do you want?"

"What do I want?" Rylie's voice cut like glass. Her eyes were burning cold. "She tried to kil me on that turn. And now I can't even land a punch? Maybe I ought to show you how it feels too."

Stacey wiped her lip. Blood streaked her hand. Her voice trembled. "I didn't mean to-I swear it wasn't on purpose!"

Jake stepped up fast. "That's enough, Rylie! You're out of line!"

Another member of Phillip's team added, "Exactly, Stacey just wanted to win the race too badly.Mistakes happen during the process. How can you blame her?"

Britton stepped in front of Rylie, his voice steady. "You're blaming her? That move Stacey pulled-anyone with a brain knows what danger it could bring. She didn't slow down when she should have.She waited until Rylie was beside her, then tapped the brakes on the outer lane?"

At that moment, a call came through to the judges from the VIP lounge. They looked at one another,then turned to review the footage again.

The tension broke when one of the judges grabbed the microphone. "We've just received a report from a spectator. Driver Six from Phillip's team-Stacey Kirk- has been found in violation of the rules.After reviewing the footage again, we have a ruling."

In an instant, Phillip's team was on edge.

Jake spun around, eyes wide. "What?! A report? Who did that?!"
###Chapter 34 Her Glory


The judge didn't bother with Phillip's protest. He looked straight ahead and delivered the decision."After a full review, the panel has reached a unanimous ruling. Phillip Kirk's racing team violated the competition rules because of Stacey Payne's conduct. The penalty is disqualification. Effective today,the entire team is banned from racing for five years."

Phillip's voice cracked with fury. "What are you talking about? How can you say we broke the rules?"

One of the panel members calmly held out the evidence. "This ruling is final. If you want to contest it,you may submit an appeal later."

Rylie glanced toward the stands, surprised that someone in the crowd had turned them in. But it made sense. Everyone had seen the same thing.

For years, several sponsors backed Phillip's team. Their support kept the operation running and paid the drivers. But now, with a five-year ban slapped on them, there was no way those sponsors would stay.

Those who had spoken in Stacey's defense stood awkwardly. The color drained from their faces.

Phillip, desperate to stop the panel from going through with it, shouted toward Rylie, "You've got to speak up! Tell them Stacey didn't break any rules! Don't let them destroy my career! Everything I've worked for is on the line!"

He finally understood how serious this had become. But Rylie only gave a small smile. "That's not my decision," she said. "And anyway, you all said she trained so hard. What's a five-year ban if she was doing it for the team? You guys should understand her. She meant well, right?"

Jake had held his tongue long enough. Now he turned on Stacey, whose mouth was bleeding at the corner."Look what you've done. You've dragged us all into this mess!"

The same teammates who once defended her now walked away in silence.

Stacey had never imagined it would spiral this far. Guilt tightening her chest, she walked to the panel and pleaded, "This is all on me. My teammates weren't involved. Please- just ban me, not Phillip's team.1 accept any punishment."

The panel listened, then responded without sympathy, "Racing is a team effort. That's how these relays work. You win together or you lose together. Besides, Miss Payne, the evidence shows your actions weren't an accident."

Her eyes were filled with panic. "I didn't mean to! I swear it wasn't on purpose!"

One of the judges gave her a dismissive glance and pulled up the car's telemetry data. "This is what we found," he said. "There was no sign that you began to slow before braking. The system shows you hit full brake force at once - far too abrupt to be an accident. There were no signs of correction or hesitation." He looked her in the eye. "Do I need to explain what that means? You could face criminal charges for this."

The mention of prison made Stacey stiffen. Phillip, who had been watching nearby,turned toward her.His voice, low and bitter, sliced through the noise. "Enough. Just stop embarrassing yourself."

Phillip never once believed that his sister would try to kill Rylie. Now that it had been exposed in front of everyone, a darker thought crept in. What if this was't the first time? Had she done something before and simply gone unnoticed?

A sudden wave of exhaustion swept through him. As he watched Rylie walk farther away, he finally grasped the kind of hopelessness that she must have carried all this time.

Up on the podium, she stood tall at the center. The judges handed her the championship trophy as brilliant lights bathed her in gold. Her teammates celebrated beside her. Confetti rained down from above.In that moment, she looked like she belonged to a different world.

Rylieshone that night.

Her grace and certainty unsettled Phillip in a way nothing else had before. For the first time, she scared him. His phone wouldn't stop buzzing.

As he stared at the screen, the club manager's furious voice burst through the speaker. "What were you thinking? The sponsors didn't just walk away. They're asking for money back! You forced Rylie out of the team? She's your sister too, isn't she? You do realize Stacey's nowhere near her level, right?You've taken things so far, we might lose the club over this!"
Phillip had nothing to say. Not one word. His silence came from panic.

His thoughts spiraled. Maybe he had chosen wrong all along. Their wins were real, sure, but those victories had Rylie's namne written undemeath. She was the one who hed the team together. He'd clung to the glory while forcing her into the shadows. Now, with her gone, everything crashing down felt deserved.

Those trophies on the shelf? They mocked him now.

On the stage, Rylie's smile held steady. Then her eyes landed on a face that she hadn't expected to see in the crowd.

She paused for just a second, then handed the trophy to Britton without a word. She hopped down and slipped through the crowd toward one person.

He stood quietly-tall, lean, his black coat rippling with the breeze. The collar of his white shirt sat loose, just enough to reveal the clean lines of his neck.

Stray bits of confetti landed on his lashes, but he didn't move. He let them fall, unfazed. There was something wild behind his calm. He carried himself like someone relaxed but always watching.Like something dangerous beneath soft wool.

Rylie stopped in front of him. "So you didn't leave?"

###Chapter 35 Still Pretending


"Yes. It's late now, and Ithought I should give you a ride home. By the way, the race was a surprise."Brad's eyes lowered slightly, his gaze softening into the shape of a smile. It was the kind of smile that reminded Rylie of a winter sky-clear and cold, distant but glowing.

Rylie had seen attractive men before, but none quite like him. Brad carried both calmn and danger in one breath, gentle in manner yet holding the firm presence of someone who had faced war. That kind of balance was rare.

Rylie composed herself quickly and smiled. "I can drive myself. I'll be fine."

Brad didn't waver. "It's not safe to be out this late. I'll take you."

Rylie lifted a brow and motioned lightly."Then lower your head."

From across the crowd, Phillip spotted them. Brad beside Rylie had a quiet elegance. He lowered his head slightly, a small bow. Rylie reached up and tugged the ribbon from his hair.

"It's done." Rylie tossed the ribbon to the side."Let's move."

As Brad rose again, he caught her scent. His fingers twitched faintly. A small smile tugged at his lips.

Brock followed at a distance, completely baffled.

In his mind, Brad would only bow like that when saving the prisoners of war. Yet now, Brad had done it willingly-for Rylie.

Phillip tried to get a closer look, but before he could step forward, the crowd surged. The two had already vanished into it.

When Rylie boarded the helicopter, she caught sight of the judges approaching in haste. Their eyes brimmed with admiration, something that was rarely offered so freely.

One of them called out, "If we had known you would attend, we'd have done things differently tonight."

"You did well," said Brad, his voice calm.
As the doors slid shut, the judges remained below, their backs straight, standing in ful attention.

That was when the truth settled in. Rylie turned to him. "You were the one who filed the report against Stacey.It was you, wasn't it?"

Brad leaned back and tapped the armrest with two fingers. "If someone spots a mistake in a race and speaks up, is that not the right thing to do?"

Usually, a simple complaint fromn the crowd wouldn't lead to this kind of fallout. Races like these were wrapped up in sponsors and influence. Judges often looked the other way.

But not when Brad was involved. Even the President treated him with formality.

"Thank you." Rylie gave a small nod. "If you ever need anything, I can offer a discount on your treatment fees."

Brad gave a quiet laugh. His eyes shifted again, soft around the edges. The light caught them just right,turning what once felt distant into something warmer. Something less guarded.

"I appreciate that, Miss Kirk."

Later that evening, Rylie returned to the community near the military compound.

The following day, while she was giving free consultations at the clinic in the community, Clive showed up carrying his old medical records.

"Dr. Kirk, could you take a look at my leg?" His voice held a note of hope.

Rylie skimmed through the reports, then asked him to roll up his pant leg. She pressed gently along the area near his knee. He winced, breath catching.

She drew her hand back. Her voice was steady and sure. "The compression of the nerve has led to muscle weakening. Regular treatments won't be enough, but surgery paired with rehabilitation could help restore function. It won't be easy,though."

Clive's face brightened. "If it means healing, I can take whatever pain comes with it."

Rylie replied, "Before anything else, you'll need a series of injections. These will get your body ready for the procedure. I'll have the medication prepared and sent to your place."
Clive could hardly contain his grin. "How much should I pay for the consultation upfront?"

After a short pause, Rylie said, "Seven hundred thousand."

She didn't go easy on him either. Knowing that Clive had no shortage of money, she prescribed his medicine based on Aetheris Pharmacy's usual rates.

Clive found the cost reasonable and handed over the payment with a smile. "This is nothing. I've seen top doctors for this leg before, and seven hundred thousand wouldn't have even covered half of it."

Once Clive was taken care of, Rylie grabbed her helmet, mounted her motorcycle, and rode off to Aetheris Pharmacy. She wasn't expecting to bump into Freddy as he rushed out the door.

She lifted her visor. "Where are you going in such a hurry?"

Freddy spoke fast. "Trouble again. Someone's been stirring up chaos over at HaloFlow for days now.Today's worse than ever. A crowd's gathered. They're accusing Ms. Hobbes of malpractice-even death."

Rylie's face darkened. She handed him a slip. "This is Clive's prescription. Prepare it and have it delivered. I'll go and help Selah."

Rylie started her engine and took off. When she arrived at HaloFlow Pharmacy, she found the situation just as described. A small mob was causing damage, shouting at the building. The staff stood around Selah,trying to keep her safe. Selah herself looked furious.

People from nearby houses and shops had already filled the alleyway.

"Did something happen?"

"They say Selah's responsible for a death!"

"You're kidding!"

"I wish I were! They say she used to work in a big hospital. Then she vanished. Now they think she's hiding something."

"I got my meds from her just yesterday. Should I be worried?"

"If there's truth to this, I won't let her treat me anymore."
The noise bullt quickly. Selah's face turned pale, and her knees buckled.

Yosef stepped forward, smug and loud. "So this is where you've been hiding. Funny how no one here knows what you've done."

He gave a slow shake of his head. "Still acting like the bold woman you used to be. Competing against the Wildes like it's nothing."

'This place isn't for your nonsense.Leave," said Selah, holding her cane tightly.

He blocked her path. "Still pretending? You think I don't know it was your idea to send that girl to the ospital?"

That girl?

Selah's eyes darted up. "You mean Rylie?"
###Chapter 36 Rylie's Anger


"Yes, that country girl. I kept wondering how someone with her background managed to climb so high - now I see you were the one pulling the strings." Yosef's lips twisted in contempt. "That Nexo-7formula Rylie handed to Mr. Morgan - don't bother denying it. You whipped it up from the recipe you stole from the Wilde family, didn't you?"

After making sure that his words sink in, he added, voice oily with threat, "Ms. Wilde's willing to let this go.Just hand the formula back, and we'll forget this ever happened."

A voice, ice-cold and unmistakably female, broke in from the shadows. "That's not your call to make."

In one swift motion, Rylie slid off her helmet, her gaze glinting with cold. Her hand shot out, clutching the nearest man's collar and wrenching him backward. He lost his footing, barely managing a gasp before her knee smashed into his midsection, leaving him writhing in pain on the ground.

Two more thugs charged, wielding clubs. Rylie pivoted, caught the wrist of the first and twisted hard.Bone cracked, the club clattering to the ground.

Before the second could react, she spun on her heel, knocked his legs out from under him, and forced him to kneel in the dirt.

Her foot pressed down on a fallen stick as she surveyed the group, her tone cold and final."Anyone tries coming for HaloFlow Pharmacy again, and they'll be lucky if they can hold a toothbrush."

Yosef never saw it coming-a girl who looked fragile and unassuming, laying waste to his hired muscle in seconds.

A flicker of panic shone in his eyes. "You don't get it, Rylie. The Wilde family could have every last person at HaloFlow thrown in jail for theft any time they want."

A cold sneer curled on Rylie's lips, saying, "Who ends up in handcuffs hasn't been decided yet."

His nerves frayed, Yosef hurled an invitation at her. "Don't get too full of yourself. The Morgans are holding another seminar for Mr. Brad Morgan. That's your official invite-from Ms. Wilde. If you've got the nerve, show up. We'll see who gets unmasked as the real thief!"
Rylie snatched the invitation midair, her glare like ice. "Tell her I'f be there. And warn the Wilde family to keep their noses clean-they might find trouble they're not ready for."

Yosef let out a laugh, as if she had told the most ridiculous joke. "You think the Wilde family is just a bit of trouble? Let's get something straight-no one in Crolens dares cross them. The Wildes control everything here, and you'd do well to keep that in mind."

"I won't forget," Rylie replied, her lips curled in a cool smirk, eyes shadowed with something unreadable.

Once Yosef and his men finally cleared out, the onlookers faded away too, leaving behind only the staff and a few regulars. Several patients approached Selah, who looked shaken and pale, murmuring comfort, "Don't let them get to you. We know how skilled you are, Dr. Hobbes."

A forced smile flickered on Selah's lips as she instructed the nearby pharmacist to show the last guests out and lock the doors.

Rylie guided Selah gently into a chair. "I never thought the Wilde family's fakes would stir up trouble here. I'm sorry you had to be dragged into it."

Selah let out a long breath, brushing off the blame. "Don't apologize. I've never gotten along with the Wilde family anyway."

Settling beside her, Rylie patted Selah's back in quiet support. "The way they spoke, you sound like you have a past with the Wilde family. You've never told me about it."

A shadow crossed Selah's face as she looked away, refusing to revisit oId wounds. "It's ancient history.Nothing that needs retelling." Her eyes flickered to the invitation in Rylie's hand."Please don't go to that meeting. The Wilde family never fights fair-they'll try anything to hurt you."

Rylie didn't pry further, simply waving the invitation with a shrug. "I can handle them. This time, the Wilde family is the one getting wiped out."

Knowing how sharp and determined Rylie was, Selah didn't argue, just reached over to affectionately pat her head. "Freddy mentioned you've finally found your real family. Isn't it time you went home to them?"

But Rylie caught the sadness in Selah's eyes-a loneliness that came from having no children of her own.She gave a mischievous grin. "What are you talking about? HaloFlow is home for me too! Besides,nobody cooks fike you. I'm staying for dinner. Will you make something speciāl?"

Warmth retumed to Selah's expression, her smile blooming with affection. "I'H get started right now."

As Selah disappeared into the kitchen to start dinner, Rylie pulled aside one of the pharmacists at HaloFlow. "Can you fill me in on what really happened all those years ago?"

After a moment's reluctance, he finally opened up.

In those days, both Selah's and the Wilde family's names were on the rise in the medical world. Even so, Selah's family didn't have the same resources, and she was their brightest star. A bitter disagreement erupted between her and Evita over how to treat a critical patient-Selah pushed for a groundbreaking neural surgery, but the patient died right on the operating table.

The tragedy hit even harder because the patient's relatives held serious power, and the fallout destroyed Selah's family's prospects overnight. Had it not been for the lives she'd saved before-and someone influential stepping in-Selah would have been behind bars much longer than she really had.

Rylie's mind worked through the story. She knew how careful Selah was with every case; something about this version didn't sit right.

A major surgical mistake seemed impossible for Selah unless the truth was buried deeper.

Leaving the pharmacy, Rylie called Britton straight away, saying, "I need you to dig up every instance of malpractice involving the Wilde family at VitaLink Hospital. Get me hard evidence- I want to make sure the Wildes are taken down for good."

Hearing the gravity in her tone, Britton responded instantly, "You got it, boss. I'll handle it and get back to you as soon as possible."

Once dinner with Selah wrapped up, Rylie made her way back to Serenity Manor.

Inside, Paola's room sparkled with brand new furniture and decorations. Laurel greeted her with a rehearsed smile. "Do you like how I arranged your room, Rylie? If anything's missing, just say the word."

Rylie's gaze swept over the room's over-the-top princess decor. She managed a polite nod. "Thank you for your trouble,Aunt Laurel."
Kendrick soon appeared at the door. "Rylie, Grandfather wants a word with you."

Upon entering Kendrick's study, Rylie spotted her two brothers and Paola already waiting.

She walked up to the desk. "Grandfather, you wanted to see me?"

Kendrick motioned for her to take a seat on the sofa. "Since you've come back, I've been thinking about throwing a grand banquet in your honor-a chance for friends and dignitaries from all over to meet my cherished granddaughter. Still, Paola mentioned that you might not be comfortable with something so big right away and suggested we hold off for now. How do you feel about it? The decision is completely yours."
###Chapter 37 Medical Discussion


In her own quiet way, Rylie shied away from flashy displays and the energy of packed rooms. She looked around and admitted, "This isn't the kind of environment I'm used to."

Paola turned to Kendrick with a soft smile. "Grandpa, maybe I could take her out to find some clothes that suit her and make her feel comfortable. She'll want to look her best when people come by."

Among all the families in Kouhron, the Owens stood at the very top. Their reputation depended on their connections, and they never missed a social event. Paola had a practical suggestion, but Kendrick didn't want his granddaughter to feel uncomfortable or pressured. After a moment of thought, he said,"If you want to pick out something new, I can give you money for it. But you don't have to change a thing if you're happy as you are."

No one would call Rylie carefree, not now, especially surrounded by relatives that she barely knew. She could see that this world operated by rules that left little room for hoodies and worn jackets.

She spoke up, her voice steady. "I do want to get a few new things."

Without hesitation, Kendrick's expression brightened. He produced a black card, placing it in her palm with the care of someone handing over something priceless. He said, "I don't really know what young women like to wear. To be safe, I bought a shopping mall. Everything in there is yours for the choosing."

Stunned,Paola stood frozen, watching Kendrick present the card.

The mall wasn't just any store- it was the largest in Crolens, worth more than most people could imagine.

Paola had spent years in the Owen household, sometimes receiving lavish gifts from the family,the sort that drew attention at any gathering. But the thought of gifting an entire shopping center was beyond belief.

Kendrick's love for his granddaughter was plain to see, and as Paola watched, she couldn't help but feel a surge of envy and anxiety.

Understanding the magnitude of the gesture, Rylie tried to refuse. "Grandpa, I have my own money."
Stil, Kendrick insisted that she take the card. "Let me make up for the years you've been lost to us."

Her resistance faded, and she nodded."Okay."

Paola leaned closer and suggested, "If you're free, we could shop together. I'IF help you pick out some outfits, and there's a big charity event coming up. It could be a nice way to get to know people."

A quick nod was all Rylie offered. "Sure," she said.

Paola's expression shifted, a glint of something unkind flickering in her eyes. In her mind, no matter how fond the Owens were of Rylie, all that affection would crumble when society caught a glimpse of Rylie's lack of polish at the upcoming gala.

Kendrick clapped his hands together. "Felix's operation is tomorrow, so let's all get some sleep," he said, signaling the end of the gathering. One by one, everyone filtered out of the study.



Military General Hospital would host Felix's operation, and Rylie arrived at dawn. She had already told Rory that she wanted to watch the procedure.

While the surgical staff prepared Felix for surgery, he caught sight of Rory and Rylie deep in conversation just outside the operating theater. At first, Felix figured that he was witnessing a classic teacher-student exchange. But as the discussion unfolded,something felt off.

Questions kept coming from Rory, the hospital's renowned senior surgeon, but he was directing them at Rylie, instead of offering explanations himself. The medical terminology quickly became complex,leaving Felix behind.

Rylie, all seriousness, laid out answers with confidence. When she finished, Rory's face lit up with understanding. "Ah, so that explains the sudden drop in blood pressure for that patient last time," he said, looking relieved.

"Give my approach a try if you run into it again," said Rylie, as if giving advice was second nature.

Felix couldn't hold back his confusion any longer. "Rylie, how come you sound like the real doctor here?"

His faith in Rory's expertise wavered. Did the chief surgeon lack even the basic knowledge of a medical student?

Laughter rippled through the medical téam nearby. "No need to worry, Mr. Owen. This sort of éxchange is pretty normal for them. Dr. Carter often goes to Miss Kirk for hélp when he's stumped,"someone explained, a smile in their voice.

Felix could barely process what he was witnessing. Was it not strange for a skilled physician well into his seventies to defer to someone who hadn't even finished school?

Questions hung in the air. Rory spoke in a quiet tone. "If we enter from the posterior-lateral angle, do you think that would minimize nerve plexus tension?"

Eyes fixed on the scan, Rylie let her fingers drum twice on the glossy film. "That approach is dangerous. The spinal cord's arterial supply might get damaged. It's smarter to start from the side control the blood vessels first, then remove the mass."

A slow nod came from Rory as he mulled over the advice, then addressed the anesthesiologist.. "Get the patient ready in the lateral position."

Felix's voice trembled with disbelief. "Wait, isn't the lead surgeon supposed to make calls like this?"The question barely left his lips before the anesthesia took hold, blurring his thoughts and pulling him under.

###Chapter 38 An Appointment Required


Soon, the surgery began. If Felix were still awake, he would find that what was happening was far more bewildering than what he had wltnessed fust now.

"Should I set the cautery to forty-flve?" Rory stopped mid-cut through the muscle, glancing over his shoulder at her.

"Thirty-five will do. His clotting's already weak." Rylie stayed glued to the monitor, her hand calmly adjusting the suction tube's angle.

As Rory neared the tumor, a nurse passed him a pair of fine micro scissors. Before he could take them,Rylie reached out instead. "Use the blunt ones. Sharp tips could rupture the capsule."

Without missing a beat, shehanded him another tool, and he accepted it like it was routine.

The circulating nurse gave her arm a discreet pinch. She still wasn't used to scenes like this. It felt like the student was being guided by the master-except everyone knew the roles had somehow flipped.

Then came the moment that left the whole room frozen.

Rory had just grabbed the forceps when Rylie caught his wrist. "Wait. There's a hidden vein just off to your left-two o'clock."

She leaned in, gently shifting the tissue to reveal a narrow vessel. "There. Now go on."

Silence blanketed the room.

No one dared say a word about the sweat beading on Rory's forehead or how he kept glancing at her before making every decision.

It wasn't until the final fascia stitch was tied that Rory let out a sigh. "Drainage tube goes next-"

"Angle it forty-five degrees. Aim toward the diaphragm." Rylie stepped in again. Her fingertips traced along Felix's rib. "His liver sits higher than normal. A standard placement might tear the capsule."

Later, in the recovery room, Felix stirred to the soft buzz of nurse chatter. "Dr. Carter looked like he'd been through a war," one whilspered. "Sald he's never fếlt that much pressure working beside Miss Kirk."

He opened his eyes to find Rylle by the bed, one hand in her coat pocket, casually checking his vitals.

A# around him, the room buzzed wlth quiet awe. Every eye seemed drawn to Rylle. Fellx blinked slowly.

There was no doubt now. His slster wás nothing short of remarkable.

Rylie saw that he was awake. She handed the record book to a nurse and walked over to the bed. With a gentle tone, she said, "The tumor's gone. The biopsy shows it's benign. You'll need to rest for at least two weeks, take it easy, and stay away from alcohol."

Felix's face clouded with thought. "Where did you learn all this, Rylie? Even Rory- the hospital's most famous and experienced surgeon-asks for your advice."

Rylie gave a small smile. "Dr. Carter doesn't take advice from me. We just help each other out."

Felix had worked in business for years. He could see through modesty when he heard it. He still couldn't grasp how his sister, who never even finished medical school, could surpass someone like Rory.

"If that's all, then you should rest," said Rylie. "I'm going home."

"Hold on." Felix stopped her. "I've got a meeting tonight. I left an important document at home. Can you grab it for me?"

Rylie's brow furrowed. "Felix, you shouldn't be stressing over meetings right now. You just had surgery.Don't you care about your recovery?"

Felix softened at her words but tried to reason with her. "I didn't think the surgery would be a problem and had my assistant schedule the meeting for tonight."

"That's not happening," said Rylie, firm and unbending.

Felix wasn't one to back down, but this time, he did. "Alright, I'll call Deandre.He'sprobably still at the office. The meeting's tied to his research anyway. Just bring him the file, and he can go in my place."

Rylie gave a nod. "Got it."
The Owen Tamily had already settled in Crolens after leaving Kouhron. With businesses spread across countries, Felix now worked from their Crolens branch.

Rylie went home and found the fRe. The cover read,"Comprehensive Organ Regeneration and Immune Compatibility Transplant System."

Her eyes narrowed. That kind of research would need at least hundreds of millions in funding. And it was tied to Deandre.

Only then did she realize - her brothers weren't just businessmen. They had secrets too-just like her.

Deandre was walking two separate paths. One as a mafia heir. The other as a scientist pushing boundaries in bioscience.

One identity destroyed lives. The other tried to save them. Rylie couldn't help but find him fascinating.

After getting the company address from Felix, she hopped on her motorcycle and took off.

Elsewhere, Fred had brought Casper-his future father-in-law-to the company. He was hoping to secure a place for the Kirk family in the project and maybe earn a share of the profits.

As Fred parked near the entrance, he adjusted his tie and turned to Casper. "The Owen family used to be nobles back in Kouhron. They're nothing like us. They care about proper manners and old-school etiquette. That's part of why they picked us. It's how I carry myself. So once we're inside, just let me do the talking. Try not to say much."

The smug tone rubbed Casper the wrong way. Still, given how fast the Dury family was climbing and how his own business was falling apart, he forced a smile and nodded. "I get it. I'll watch myself."

They stepped out of the car and entered the lobby of the Owen Group. Right away, they spotted someone unexpected.

Rylie stood near the reception desk, a helmet tucked under one arm. Her black jacket clung neatly to her frame, giving her the look of someone who belonged on a racetrack, not in an office building. She was speaking to the receptionist. "I'm here to deliver something to Deandre Owen."

The receptionist looked up briefly and asked, "Do you have an appointment?"
Rylie paused."No."

"Then you can't go up," said the woman, eyes on her computer. "You'l need fo speak with the assistant and come back another time."

Rylie stood silent. Felix hadn't sald anything about needing clearance. After thinking it over, she spoke again. "I'm his sister. I don't need an appointment."

That earned her a sharp laugh. The receptionist tossed her a look dripping with scorn. "You must've heard something about the Owen daughter showing up today," she said. "But do you honestly think you look like an Owen?"

She gave Rylie a full once-over and continued, "Have you even looked in a mirror?" Women try all sorts of things to ge into Mr. Owen's office, but that excuse? Thât's á first."

A few nearby employees paused their tasks, drawn in by the rising tension.

"Since the Owen Group set up shop here in Crolens," the receptionist went on, her voice rising. had folks showing up daily pretending to be family. But you?" She narrowed her eyes and jabbed her words with extra weight. "You're the only one who walked in looking like you just came off a racetrack.
###Chapter 39 You're Just in Time


Rylie held back a sigh. "I truly am..."

With an impatient flick of her wrist, the receptionist interjected,"That's enough out of you. Any more trouble and I'll get security involved." Her gaze swept over Rylie dismissively. "If you're going to fake your way in, at least put some effort into your outfit. Learn how to dress up like a lady from a wealthy family before lying."

A quiet laugh escaped Rylie. "Wasn't the Owen family's daughter missing all these years, though?"

Dismissal sharpened in the receptionist's reply. "Missing? She's living in comfort at Serenity Manor.
The only ones pretending are women like you, coming from nowhere and playing at being her."

Several staff passing by joined in the chorus. "Quit holding up the line-just get her out of here."

As she listened, Rylie put the pieces together. The receptionist seemed convinced that Paola was the true daughter of the Owens. Paola had been living there for so long, and a lot of people believed that she was an Owen.

Any irritation slid off her shoulders. Instead, she spoke evenly. "You might want to check with your higher-ups before you force me out. If you make me call myself, things will get much more complicated."

Doubt flickered in the receptionist's eyes. She stood torn, weighing whether to pick up the phone,when another voice broke the tension.

Amusement played on Fred's lips as he stepped forward. "So it's you, Rylie. Banished from the Kirk family, and now you're pretendingto be the Owens' lost daughter for cash?"

Casper's mood soured instantly. He snapped, "Rylie! Have you no shame showing up here like this?"

Fred continued, the mockery thick in his tone, "Mr. Kirk, take a good look at your daughter-throwing away her pride just to chase after a rich family."

Next, he addressed the receptionist with a flourish, his manner suddenly refined. "No need to confirm.You really ought to have security remove scammers like her right away. She will only stain the Owen Company's name."

Recognition dawned on the receptionist, her jaw dropping as she connected the dots. "Wait, I know that face.I've seen this woman on the news before."

The doubt vanished. Instead, a sneer settled on her lips as she addressed Rylie. "Now I remember.You're the so-called daughter of the Kirk family who got tossed out for your bad reputation."

A sharp jab of Casper's finger followed, and his words were biting. "Leave, right now! If you mess up my meeting with Mr. Owen, you'll regret it."

A laugh bubbled from Rylie, unexpectedly bright. "I'm not going anywhere."

"Unbelievable-how thick-skinned can you get?" Confidence swelled in the receptionist with every supportive glance. She leaned over, pressing the intercom button to summon security.

Refusing to be intimidated, Rylie pulled out her phone, her tone steady as she spoke. "Deandre, I'm downstairs at the branch. The front desk says I'm a fraud and wants to toss me out."

Deandre's frustration spilled out in his answer."Why is this happening? I left word at the desk that my sister would be dropping by! Don't move, I'll send someone down right now."

A smirk danced across the receptionist's face. "Keep acting tough. Let's see what happens next."

A shrill ring sliced through the tension at the desk. Lifting the receiver, the receptionist paled as she listened to the fury pouring through the phone."What do you mean?!"

The supervisor on the line shouted, "Have you lost your mind? That's the Owens' daughter at the door -the one missing for ages! You're fired! Clean out your desk and leave!"

Shaken to her core, the receptionist nearly collapsed, her hand trembling so much that she dropped the phone. All she could do was stare at Rylie, who lounged against the counter with an air of effortless composure.

A faint, mocking smile played on Rylie's lips. "Surprised? Amazing what one phone call can do."

Fred couldn't help but wonder about the abrupt change, though he had another agenda. Tapping the countertop, he said, "By the way, someone should let Mr. Owen know that Fred is here about the three-hundred-million business partnership we discussed." By now, the receptionist could barely register Fred's demand. Panic overtook her as she rushed to Rylie's side, tears streaking down her cheeks while she bowed low. "Please, I'm so sorry! I didn't realize you were Mr. Owen's sister-I swear I thought it was Paola! Please don't let them fire me. I can't lose this job!"

Compassion rarely extended from Rylie to people who wore cruelty like a badge. "You had every chance to double-check the facts," she said, voice cool and steady. "But instead, you let arrogance decide for you. People like you end up driving away good clients just because of how someone's dressed."

Fred and Casper stood rooted to the spot, completely thrown off by what was unfolding.

Fred tried to get a grip on the situation, his nerves suddenly taut."What do you mean-sister? Who is Rylie supposed to be related to? Someone explain!"

Incoherent with fear, the receptionist could only sink to her knees, grabbing hold of Rylie's pant leg."Miss Kirk, I'm begging you-don't let them dismiss me! I really need this job!"

Working the reception desk at the Owen Group's branch didn't call for any special qualifications, and it paid handsomely for those who could keep up appearances.

Now the thought of losing that easy security had her begging at Rylie's feet, desperate for mercy.

Everyone who had jeered at Rylie earlier had disappeared, not daring to breathe too loudly and hoping that she didn't remember their faces.

With barely a glance down, Rylie offered only a cold warning, saying, "Everyone gets taught lessons by life.What you do with them is your choice."

Security personnel entered next, not to remove Rylie, but to gently pry the receptionist from her grip on Rylie's clothes. The woman was led away, already facing the reality of a severance check and a quick exit. Rylie didn't so much as flinch.

Fred and Casper exchanged uneasy glances, their faces drained of color. The evidence before them was hard to ignore - maybe Rylie did have real ties to the Owen family. Still, they struggled to understand how someone they looked down on could possibly share the Owen bloodline.

Suddenly,the elevator chimed. An impeccably dressed assistant stepped out, trailed by a half-dozen
bodyguards in black, each one moving with practiced precision.

The assistant's presence immediately caught Fred's attention; he recognized the man from earlier contract negotiations, always seen at the side of Felix and trusted with all the important paperwork.

With an ingratiating grin, Fred hurried over. "There's really no need for you to trouble yourself, Mr.Cullen. We could have just gone up to the conference room on our own."

Alistair Cullen barely spared him a glance, cutting straight past to stand next to Rylie. He offered a respectful bow. "Miss Owen, I apologize for the way you were treated today. I'll make sure the reception staff sends you a written apology for your review. Anyone involved in today's disrespect will be dealt with accordingly, so please set your mind at ease. Also, Mr. Deandre Owen is waiting for you in Mr.Felix Owen's office."

Acknowledgment flickered in Rylie's eyes. "Lead the way."

Panic flashed across Fred's face. "Wait!" he called out, unable to process what he was witnessing. He lunged forward,only to have the bodyguards block his path. Desperation colored his voice..Cullen,please-let me through! Just a moment!"

Taking command, Alistair guided Rylie to the private elevator reserved for executives. "You'll find Mr.Deandre Owen on the tenth floor. I'll have to leave you here, as other matters require my attention.Thank you for understanding."

A reassuring smile from Rylie put him at ease. "Don't worry about it. I can go up by myself." The doors slid shut behind her, closing off the lobby and its chaos.

Lingering by the elevator, Alistair waited until Rylie was out of sight before turning to address Fred.

The look he gave was frigid. "Mr Dury, perfect timing. Mr. Felix Owen wants a word with you."

###Chapter 40 Such A Heavy Blow
A sharp jolt ran down Fred's spine. It felt like a cold gust had cut through him. He realized that the situation was spiraling out of control. Sweat began to gather across his back.


He tried to keep himself steady, though his voice betrayed him. "M-Mr. Cullen, what does Mr. Owen want to discuss with me? Maybe we could talk about this inside?"



Alistair, stone-faced and unreadable, unlocked his tablet and pulled up a file. "In line with the addendum under Article 7, the Owen Group has the right to immediately end ties with any party guilty of misconduct." He looked up, sharp and direct. His stare struck like a blade. "Mr. Dury, your comments about Miss Kirk already count as a breach."



Fred's legs gave way a little. He staggered, nearly falling. He grabbed hold of Casper's arm, clutching it with such desperation that his nails nearly broke skin "Mr. Kirk! W Rylie really... Is she really...?"


Casper's lips trembled. But no words came. Fred clung to a small thread of hope. "Couldn't there be some kind of mistake? Rylie really is... an Owen? My wife picked her up from some remote town. There's no way she's tied to that family."
Alistair's voice cut in, laced with scorn. "Are you questioning the Owen family's credibility? Miss Rylie Kirk was confirmed through DNA. Mr. Kendrick Owen personallyverifiedthat.	she'shis	missing granddaughter."


Casper stood frozen. His skin turned a pale shade of grey. "How is this even real..."



Not long ago, the Kirk family not only expelled Rylie but also publicly humiliated her over supposed conduct issues. All of this must have been seen by the Owen family.



Casper's knees buckled. He almost couldn't stay upright.





"This can't be true! She's nothing more than a fake the Kirk family has raised for two decades!" Fred shouted.His face twisted in panic.



He scrambled to find his phone. "I need to call Mr.Owen right now! This whole thing must be some kind of error!"



Alistair let out a low, humorless laugh and nodded at the nearby guards. "Mr. Owen wanted me to make this clear. The Dury family is fully accountable for the emotional damage his sister suffered after the broken engagement."



He tapped the tablet again. Fred's phone buzzed right away."The Owen Group is canceling the entire three -hundred-million deal. The forty million you invested upfront will now be seized as a penalty."


Fred's jaw dropped. "Forty million?!" The phone slipped from his hands and hit the floor.


He just stood there, stunned. That was half of Dury Group's working capital for the year. How could he possibly explain this to his family?


A thought struck him. He turned toward the elevator and slammed his palm against the button. "Rylie! Rylie!Come out here and explain yourself! Tell me who you really are! Say something-"



Before he could get another word out, two bodyguards yanked him back. They tossed him out the front door. Casper followed right behind, both men thrown out together like trash.



Alistair stepped out of the building and glanced down at the two men on the pavement. "Mr. Dury,your reputation as a womanizer is known all over Crolens.Do you actually believe that deal was yours because of merit? If Mr. Felix Owen hadn't held affection for his younger sister- who already had a childhood engagement with you- you wouldn't have gotten anywhere hear this project."



His lip curled as he kept going. "And yet, you had the nerve to cancel the engagement with Miss Kirk? You had everything handed to you, and you threw it away.That's not bold. That's just stupid."

Fred's vision began to blur. A wave of heat rose in his chest. He coughed, spit out blood, and collapsed on the ground.


Casper stood frozen. The blow had left him speechless.









Rylie stepped onto the tenth floor and followed the secretary down the hallway to Deandre's office.



Just then, a side door flew open. A striking woman with tight curls and a sharp outfit stepped into the hallway,her face clouded with irritation.



She took off her sunglasses, snatched the secretary by the arm, and snapped, "I've been sitting here for three hours. Where's Deandre? Why won't he see me?"



The secretary ducked her head. "Miss Johnson, please try not to make things difficult. Mr. Owen is still tied up. It might be better to return another day."



"I just talked to Paola. She told me Deandre isn't meeting with anyone important today," said Fiona Johnson, folding her arms."So should I believe you or his cousin"



"You can call Mr. Owen yourself if you like," the secretary answered politely


Fiona's stare darted to Rylie. She studied her face,her posture,her poise-and felt her stomach drop."Who is she? What is she doing here?"


"I'm sorry," said the secretary softly. "That's confidential."



Hearing that, Fiona jumped to conclusions, assuming that Deandre had found someone new just after breaking up with her, causing her eyes to redden.



Rylie caught the emotion on Fiona's face but didn't slow her pace. She walked right past and entered the CEO's office.



Shaken and uneasy, Fiona immediately called Paola."He's refusing to meet me. Could you please talk to him for me?"



Paola took a moment before answering, "That's not something I can do. If Deandre doesn't want to meet,no one can change his mind. If he's made up his mind,you'll just have to accept it."



"How am I supposed to accept this?" Fiona said, voice rising. "I just watched a young woman walk into his office!"



Paola sounded impatient now. "Fiona, Deandre is rarely home. He's been around beautiful women all year long. You should've known this would happen when you got involved with someone like him."
###Chapter 41 Real Influence Within The Owen Family

The message couldn't have been more obvious. Paola had no intention of stepping in, and she certainly wouldn't risk crossing Deandre for someone like Fiona,no matter her fame.



Frustration welled up inside Fiona as she ended the call, her fists clenching at her sides.


Instead of giving up, she chose to remain seated on the plush sofa outside the CEO's office, determined not to leave just yet. Soon, she spotted a group of receptionists approaching, each one carrying plates piled high with gorgeous, pricey pastries.


A hopeful spark appeared in Fiona's eyes. "Are those for me?"



A receptionist offered her a polite smile. "They're for Miss Owen. Mr. Owen was worried she might have skipped lunch to come here, so he had us put together a little spread."



"Miss Owen?" The name left Fiona momentarily frozen, memories of Paola's earlier complaints tumbling back into her mind.
That conversation had been about the long-lost Owen daughter, newly returned and settling in at Serenity Manor.



Realization dawned - could it be the eccentric woman she'd glimpsed earlier? That unusual young woman was actually the missing Owen daughter.



As she watched the receptionists disappear inside with their plates, Fiona's thoughts twisted into knots.



Not long after, the office door swung open and Rylie emerged.Fiona sprang to her feet, offering a strained,apologetic grin as she moved to block Rylie's way. "I'm so sorry, Miss Owen. I didn't realize who you were earlier."



Rylie immediately recognized Fiona from the silver screen- after all, Fiona was a well-known actress,the very star who'd been cast in Spencer's upcoming movie.



It was a curious overlap, since Paola happened to be composing for the film, which was still in its early development stages.


Rylie paused a moment, then stepped forward and offered her hand. "I'm Rylie."


Fiona quickly grasped Rylie's hand, introduced herself with practiced poise, and asked, "Do you know if  Deandre is available?"



"You've got ten minutes," said Rylie, her tone polite but brisk. "He has a meeting after that, so you can catch him now if you hurry."


That answer left Fiona blinking in surprise. "He actually agreed to see me?"



With a faint, knowing smile, Rylie explained, "I let him know you'd been waiting a long time out here, hoping for a chance to talk."



in a flash, Fiona's whole demeanor changed. "Rylie,let's exchange contact information! If you ever want to go to a concert or a movie premiere, just tell me -I'll get you tickets,front row!"



"No problem," Rylie said, passing along her contact info before heading on her way.



The thought never would have crossed Fiona's mind that someone as steadfast as Deandre - who wouldn't even listen to Paola-would so easily bend for Rylie. Clearly, this newly returned daughter held real influence within the Owen family.



Earlier, in Deandre's office, Rylie had first asked if she might join his advanced medical research project.Thinking that she was simply curious, Deandre agreed to let her visit the lab once the group formed and funds were secured.
But then Rylie brought up Fiona's situation, and Deandre's demeanor soured. "We met abroad, spent a month together, nothing more. I even gave her a generous parting gift. I can't understand why she keeps turning up."



Calmly, Rylie replied, "She mistook me for your girlfriend when I arrived, and she looked genuinely upset. Money doesn't fix feelings, Deandre. Why not meet with her, explain things clearly?"



Something in his sister's words gave Deandre pause.For a moment, he remembered how Fred ended things with Rylie, only to announce a new engagement immediately after. Was she projecting her own hurt onto Fiona's heartbreak?



"I'll see her," Deandre answered without hesitation."Don't worry-I'm nothing like Fred."



A soft smile played on Rylie's lips. "I know you're not."



After leaving the branch office behind, Rylie steered her car toward Vantage Mall, the city's premier shopping destination. In her pocket, she carried the exclusive blank card that opened every door in the place.


Tonight, Paola had extended an invitation to browse for refined, elegant clothes together.
Arriving at the cafe nestled within the mall, Rylie quickly spotted Paola holding court among a cluster of other well-dressed young women from wealthy families.



Paola was quick to catch sight of her, rising from her seat with a wave. "Rylie! You made it-come join us!"



Suddenly, every eye in the group turned to Rylie,and a wave of murmured gossip swept through the air.


"So that's the Owen family's lost daughter? She doesn't hold a candle to you, Paola."



"Honestly, look at those bargain-bin brands she's wearing.What was she thinking?"



"No surprise there. The Kirk family clearly didn't teach her the first thing about style. She just doesn't belong in this crowd."



Paola interjected,pretending to protect Rylie from the barbs, "Let's not judge. Rylie's simply down-to-earth,not one to stress over labels. She's actually wonderful company."



Laughter rippled through the group, their glances heavy with dismissal



Walking up to Paola, Rylie quietly remarked,"thought it would be just us on this shopping trip."
"Don't be upset, Rylie. Everyone was eager to meet you and become friends. When word got out about our shopping trip, they were determined to tag along,"Paola said softly,looping her arm through Rylie's."Try not to take it to heart. They're just being friendly-and you might find their advice helpful when it comes to picking the perfect look."



Rylie picked up on the insincerity hiding behind their smiles; to her, it was clear that these women came more for entertainment than friendship. Still,she kept her thoughts to herself and gave Paola a polite nod."If you say so."



"Well, what are we standing around for?" one of the women sneered, glancing at the others with a sly spark in her eyes. "Let's help Miss Owen find something stunning for the charity gala!"
###Chapter 42 Where Did You Get The Money
Rylie wore a subtle smile, barely noticeable, as she let Paola slip her arm through hers. The two of them strolled into the high-end wing of Vantage Mall,flanked by a cluster of well-dressed young women from wealthy families.


Overhead, glittering chandeliers poured light acrOSS the polished floor, and the air carried a mix of expensive perfume.



"Shall we look at Petalpoly first?" asked Paola,motioning toward a boutique nearby. "Their latest pieces would suit the charity gala beautifully."



"Alright," said Rylie, her voice light, her gaze moving past the dresses in the window that each bore eye-watering price tags.



The young women exchanged glances, a qquiet amusement shared between them. Isabella Olson,dressed sharply in luxury clothes, tilted her head. "Miss Owen, have you ever been to a gala of this caliber before? Would you like us to explain the dress code?"She put extra weight on the word "before," her tone sharp.
Rylie answered with a half-smile, "That won't be necessary."


"Oh my, Isabella, that was a bit harsh," said Paola with an amused tone.



Then she added, "Still, she makes a point, Rylie.Events like this have their own rules. Take that one,for example."



She nodded toward a gown on display, the hem covered in glimmering crystals. "It's the highlight of the store this season and would be perfect for the event."



A few of the other young women glanced at one another, then spoke up. "Paola's choice is excellent!That gown could have been made just for you, Miss Owen. It suits your elegance perfectly!"



Paola gave a small nod to a staff member, who carefully took the gown off the rack. She turned to Rylie. "Go ahead and try it on. Ifit suits you, we'll find jewelry to match."



"The jewelry here is surprisingly impressive," said Isabella as she held up a striking pink diamond necklace,lifting it to Rylie's collar with an exaggerated grin. "Look at this. Isn't it just right?"


The praise from these women flooded the space, but Rylie could tell that it was nothing more than thinly veiled ridicule.



She ran her eyes over the extravagant dress, her gaze pausing at the fine print on the tag. It read:"For costume parties only."


A soft scoff stayed behind her lips. Did they honestly think that she was naive enough not to notice?



Wearing something meant for a theme party to a charity gala? She wasn't that easily fooled!


And that flashy diamond necklace? If she wore that,she'd be the butt of every joke at the gala.



Rylie's lips lifted in a smile, cool and cutting. "|thought women from your circles had refined taste and a talent for pairing garments with style."



She let her fingers brush a crystal on the dress and added, "Turns out I was wrong. Calling this cheap knockoff haute couture? You're all so tacky."


The group fell silent. Isabella's face tensed as she fired back, "We're helping you find a dress, and you call us tacky? What's your deal?"



Without blinking, Rylie shoved the dress into Paola's arms. Her tone didn't change. "You'd be better off distancing yourself from people with such poor taste.They're dragging down the Owen family's reputation.
 It's embarrassing."



"You-!" Paola's temper snapped, but when she met Rylie's sharp stare, her voice caught in her throat. She knew right then that Rylie had figured her out.



"I'll choose my own dress. You don't have to trouble yourself," said Rylie with a slight smile. "You can enjoy your afternoon. I'll browse elsewhere." She turned and walked away, not once looking back.



Paola stood frozen, teeth clenched. One of her companions offered a pat on the shoulder. "Don't let it get to you, Paola. Even if she's not completely clueless, she's not stealing your thunder. Sure, she talks back, but let's see what she ends up wearing."



Paola breathed out slowly and gave a quiet reply, her feigned kindness returning. "I really did want to help her."



Rylie wandered around alone for a while before stepping into the Beedleshine boutique, a designer label. A certain handbag caught her attention,and she walked over to examine it.



A sales assistant approached with a cheerful tone."You've got great taste, miss. That's our newest release. It's priced at $100, 000. Unfortunately, we're out of stock at the moment. Would you like to take a look at something else? We've just stocked some  lovely globes, tableware, and bicycles too."



Luxury shops weren't a usual stop for Rylie. She had never paid attention to the competitive habits of socialites. Since turning of age, the Kirk family had excluded her from their events, always sending Stacey in her place.



Before that, her brothers from the Kirk family sometimes bought her clothing or accessories,but none of it ever cost more than $10,000.



Rylie picked up the bag and passed it to the assistant."I'm not interested in the rest. I just want this one."



"I'm sorry, miss," said the woman with a tight smile."This is a display model. You'll have to wait for restock." She smiled again, but it wasn't sincere. It was common knowledge in the store that if a customer didn't purchase enough leftover stock, they wouldn't get access to new releases. No commission meant no bag.



Rylie was just about to set the handbag down, thinking that it truly wasn't in stock, when voices drifted in behind her.



Stacey had come with Tessa, who brought her along for a shopping trip. "You'll be marrying into the Dury family soon," said Tessa. "If you don't carry expensive bags and wear proper jewelry,real socialites won't take you seriously."



Still holding her mother's hand, Stacey gave a small smile. "It's fine, Mom. My brothers have already bought me plenty of bags and jewelry. They're all worth tens of thousands."



Tessa shook her head. "That's not enough. Once you're married to Fred and mingling with the upper circle, you'll notice that the truly elite carry handbags that cost at least hundreds of thousands." She gave Stacey's hand a firm pat. "We'll get you something extravagant today. You can't afford to be seen without status in future events."



Though Stacey felt thrilled inside - she had never owned anything so costly before-she kept her tone soft. "Alright. I'll go along with your plan."


They walked into the Beedleshine boutique and immediately caught sight of Rylie near the handbags.



"Rylie?" they said in unison, clearly taken aback.



Rylie turned toward them. Before she could say anything, the same associate from earlier stepped forward with a warm smile. "Mrs. Kirk, it's been a while.What can I help you with today?"



Tessa brushed past the greeting without so much as a glance. Her expression tightened as she stepped up to Rylie. "So, instead of scraping by with those good  -for-nothing parents. you've decided to shop for luxury iterns? What's the story? Did some rich man start keeping you on the side?


Her voice was shatp and full of scorn. To her. Rylie was nothing but a souirce of shame



Rylie didn't bolink. Her reply was flat. "Didh't Stacey already explain everything to you about the car racing?"
###Chapter 43 Vantage Mall's Only Unlimited Black Card
Stacey's grip on her dress tightened until her nails threatened to break the skin. "Rylie, what are you even saying? I have no idea what you're talking about..."


A sly chuckle slipped from Rylie as she traced lazy circles on the countertop. "So,Phillip kept the truth from the rest of you? The racing team's been barred from competition for five years, all thanks to Stacey's infraction."



Lifting her eyes, Rylie pnned them both with a look as cold as ice. "And now the sponsors want seven million in damages. Mrs. Kirk, was that news to you?"



Tessa's expression faltered for a split second, then she forced out a laugh. "Stacey is on the verge of becoming the Dury family's young mistress. Seven million is nothing to us." She then drew Stacey closer,voice sharpening to a hiss. "But you-betraying your brother and sister, joining others' team, and bringing damage to your own family!"



"Is that so?" Rylie tilted her head, lips twisted in a mocking smile. "You mean I took the championship reward that Phillip was confident in getting and disrupted his original plan? Well, you're right."


"What?!" Tessa's eyes flew open, shock etched across her face. "Excuse me?!"



Now it all made sense-the missing seven million her husband had discovered, money quietly funneled from the company's account that was supposed to pay the workers. The deficit now sat directly on their shoulders.



The more she dwelled on it, the more her temper flared. She snatched her purse from the counter and threw it at the shop assistant. "Throw this girl out! I'm buying the bag!"



The shop assistant hesitated, anxiety flickering across her features. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Kirk, but she's a customer,too.I have no authority to make her leave."



Tessa didn't hesitate-she jabbed a finger at the bag that Rylie had just admired. "That one there? Pack it up for me. I'm buying it for my daughter!"



The shop assistant's eyes gleamed. "Would you like to see our other new arrivals? We just got in a selection of dinnerware, globes, and more."



Tessa,fully aware of the bundling game,made a show of confidence. "Bundle up everything. I'll take it all."



Brightening, the assistant did a quick calculation. "The bag alone is one hundred thousand, and the rest brings the total to two hundred thousand. Mrs. Kirk,will that be cash or card?"



Standing to the side, Rylie finally caught on-the fake shortage was a ruse, just another trick to inflate commissions through forced add-ons.



Tessa hadn't expected the final tally to be so steep;her plan was to cap spending at one hundred and fifty thousand. But pride wouldn't let her back down. She produced her card, voice tight. "If this gets her out, I'll pay right now."



A cloud of worry passed over the assistant's face.After thinking it over, she drifted over to Rylie and dropped her voice. "Technically, we can't throw out customers. Would you mind stepping outside and coming back later? I can give you two thousand for the trouble."



Rylie's eyebrow arched, amused. "You must be making a pretty penny on this."


The assistant's reply came with an awkward grin. "You won't lose out, will you?"


"How about you fetch your manager?" Rylie gave her a friendly but pointed smile, handing over a sleek black card. "Let your manager decide. Ask him directly if there's any stock on that bag. If she says no, I'll  leave without another word."



Though she'd never seen this card before, the shop assistant couldn't risk offending either woman-especially not with that kind of money in play. She hurried off to brief the manager on the situation.



Taking the card, the manager checked the number,then scoffed, "If we say the bag's out of stock, it's out of stock. We make our living on those bundles.Even a black card can't change store policy."



The manager's words trailed off as her eyes grew wide and her fingers started to shake. In a hushed voice,she leaned toward the shop assistant. "Wait-this is Vantage Mall's only unlimited black card. The cardholder is that Owen family daughter who just came back!"



The shop assistant felt her knees turn to jelly. "You're kidding!"



Voice barely steady, the manager whispered, "I got the memo last night. She was expected to shop today -the Owen family's patriarch bought out the whole building just for her!"



Color drained from the assistant's face. "I figured the Owen family's daughter would be surrounded by security. I never guessed she'd look so normal. Oh no -I've probably just insulted her..."
Not even five minutes passed before both manager and shop assistant came hurrying out together.


Spotting their rush, Tessa curled her lip in contempt."Finally. Are you going to sell me that bag or not?"


Without glancing at Tessa, the manager bowed deeply to Rylie, her tone nothing but reverent. "Please forgive us for not recognizing you right away. It's an honor to welcome you. Which bag do you like? I'll have them all delivered to your door. Any unpleasantness before was our mistake - please overlook it."



The shop assistant bent low as well, voice trembling."I'm so sorry-I had no idea who you were."


Tessa's eyes narrowed in disbelief. "You're apologizing to her? Are you joking? The true VIP is standing next to me. What sort of business are you running?"



The manager hesitated only a moment before turning to Tessa."I'm sorry, Mrs. Kirk, but we can't throw out our customers. I hope you'll understand."



Tessa's voice took on a sharp edge. "Maybe you don't realize this, but Kirk Group is about to sign a partnership with Owen Group - Mr. Owen himself brought the contract! Didn't Owen Group just buy out this entire mall? I want exclusive access to shop here.How hard is that to understand?"
The manager had meant to keep things civil, but the more Tessa spoke, the more he wondered if the Kirk family understood just how far out of their depth they were.



Turning to Rylie with unwavering respect, the manager asked, "How would you like to handle this?"



Rylie's face remained unreadable. "Show them the door. And make sure Mrs. Kirk and her darling daughter don't set foot in Vantage Mall again."


Tessa let out a derisive laugh. "You're telling me to go?Who do you think you are?"



But the manager calmly motioned for the staff to assist, and soon a small crowd of shop assistants and sales associates formed a gentle but firm wall. "It's time for you to leave. Our store-and all of Vantage Mall-will no longer serve you."



Tessa reeled, stunned. "Have you lost your minds? You can't just throw me out!"


"If you don't go quíetly, security will handle it. Trust me, being dragged out won't do your reputation any favors," the manager replied, his tone leaving no room for argument.



Stacey stared, just as rattled. "All this because of something Rylie said? My future husband is one of Mr.  Owen's top business partners. Aren't you worried about your own jobs?"


A small, knowing smile played on Rylie's lips. "No one told you? That three-hundred-million-dollar contract was canceled this morning."



Tessa's temper flared, and she retorted, "How dare you wish misfortune on our family!"



Her words barely left her lips before several staff members firmly ushered her toward the exit. In the chaos, Tessa stumbled and collapsed, her chronic leg pain seizing up and leaving her writhing on the floor.Stacey hurried to her side, but despite her best efforts,she couldn't get Tessa back on her feet, and together they made a pitiful sight.



Sweat beaded across Tessa's forehead as she grimaced through the pain. "It's never hurt this badly before."



Stacey,her confidence starting to waver, fumbled for comfort. "I went to Marsha- she's supposed to be the Wilde family's medical genius. She even got a special prescription from her grandmother. With the medicine and my massages, your legs should be healing. This must just be a side effect."



Taking Stacey at her word, Tessa clung to her arm and forced herself upright. "Get your father on the phone now! That ungrateful brat Rylie will pay for this humiliation.I won't let her get away with it!"



Stacey tried to offer reassurance, but doubt crept in."Something's off, Mom. The staff here all know the Kirk family. Why would they still side with Rylie and risk crossing us?"
###Chapter 44 Kirk Family's Trouble
Tessa barely let the suspicion cross her mind before brushing it aside. "Her status above ours? No chance.She must have found herself some sugar daddy."



"I'll call Fred-he might know what's really going on,"Stacey said,already fishing her phone from her bag.


Before she could place the call, the mall's loudspeakers crackled to life: "Attention all shoppers.Effective immediately, Vantage Mall will be closed to the public for the exclusive use of the Owen family's honored daughter. All shops are to suspend business for the next two hours."



"What?" Stacey jerked her head up in disbelief.All around them, the mall's lights flickered off, leaving only the Beedleshine boutique aglow beneath a single,stark spotlight. A dozen of black-suited bodyguards assembled,forming a barrier to keep out prying eyes as they guided a young woman from the store.


Tessa's voice trembled. "What... what is this?"


A sick feeling took hold of Stacey. "It couldn't actually be Rylie, could it?"
"That's ridiculous," Tessa retorted. "There were other girls in there, and Rylie's just some country bumpkin.She couldn't possibly be that important."



Not far away, a cluster of frustrated young women from wealthy families was also being hustled toward the exits. Paola's face had gone pale, and her friend shouted furiously at security, "You're out of your minds! Paola's an Owen too! How dare you treat us like this?"



The security team exchanged a look,then one of them made a quick call and returned with a stiff apology."Sorry, but the directive is clear. The entire mall is reserved for the Owen family's only daughter. No exceptions."



Isabella clung to Paola's arm, her eyes flashing. "This is insane! Paola, you're an Owen, aren't you? There's no way they'd go to all this trouble for that nobody.They must have meant you!"



Paola couldn't even fake a smile. "Let me make a call,"she said quietly.



Slipping away from her circle, she dialed Deandre and laid out the whole situation. His apology was little more than an afterthought. "Sorry, Paola. I just wanted Rylie to have the run of the mall today. It honestly slipped my mind."

Her chest tightened, but she forced her voice to stay pleasant. "I don't mind being shown the door, but do you think you could let my friends shop? That's all l ask."



Deandre replied,"Got it. You can all join Rylie. Have fun."



The call ended, leaving Paola simmering with jealousy that she tried to hide. Despite being just from a distant branch of the Owen family, she had always counted herself as the Owen family's cherished daughter.



There was no way this outsider, Rylie, could take her place. Paola would make sure that everyone knew who the Owen family's real daughter was.



When she returned, the bodyguards,now briefed with new instructions, changed their tune and courteously ushered her group back inside. That move salvaged her standing-her friends never doubted her claim of being an Owen.







Elsewhere, trouble brewed. Casper hadn't set foot outside his office in days, barricading himself from the world.



Tessa's chronic leg pain had flared up badly, and a nasty reaction to her medication landed her at VitaLink Hospital. Stacey was left behind at home,nerves on edge for reasons that she couldn't quite explain.



Nicolas was bedridden and unable to run the family's affairs. Leland spent his days in the hospital,his nights at the company-his energy drained, his hair graying faster than ever. Phillip was nowhere to be found;rumors said that the fiasco with his racing team had him barely keeping it together.



Ever since Rylie's departure from the Kirk family,nothing had been the same.



That afternoon, as usual, a servant prepared a homemade meal and delivered it to Tessa's hospital room. Leland stood beside her bed, medical chart in hand, his expression grim. "The latest round of tests shows your legs' condition hasn't improved. In fact,it's gotten worse."



All color was drained from Tessa's face. "That's impossible. Stacey went to the Wilde family's famous doctor for my medicine, and she's been massaging my legs every day."



Hearing the name "Wilde family" made Leland's face tighten with frustration. Ever since Nicolas' sudden decline, his trust in their so-called experts had evaporated. None of Marsha's remedies had made the  slightest difference.



"For now, stick to the painkillers and stop using anything Stacey picked up from Marsha," he suggested.



Tessa clung to the hope of good news. "And Nicolas?Has he improved at all?"



Leland let out a weary sigh and shook his head. "His legs' nerves have shut down. At this point, the only option doctors are recommending is amputation, to keep it from getting any worse."



Tessa felt the world drop out from beneath her. Her voice pitched upward. "Amputation? Are you serious?How could it possibly come to this? Before we came back, Nicolas promised me he was fine-he could walk, run, even manage the business. He was in perfect health!"



A heavy silence hung in the air before Leland finally spoke."That was true-up until Rylie was forced out."
###Chapter 45 How Is That Possible
Back then, everyone was convinced that Rylie meant to harm Nicolas, interpreting her attempts to induce vomiting and flush out toxins as malicious. That misunderstanding was what led to her expulsion from the family.



Once Rylie was gone and her treatments ceased,it wasn't long before Nicolas lost the use of his legs. His health slid downhill with alarming speed.


Leland pressed his lips together, weighing his words before saying, "Mom, maybe we were wrong about Rylie. I think she was trying to help Nicolas-using medicine to purge the poison through vomiting Medically,it's possible.Maybe...we judged her unfairly."



Tessa's gaze drifted to her own legs as she whispered,"Now that I think about it carefully, I find Stacey's massages never really helped. Ever since | stopped takingthosemedications,thepain'sonlygottenworse..."



Just then, the door swung open and a servant entered,setting a lunchbox on the table and pulling a slip of paper from their pocket, handing it to Leland.



"This is a prescription Miss Rylie Kirk prepared for Mrs Tessa Kirk before she left. Perhaps you can have these medicines filled for her."



Leland glanced at the prescription and recognized nearly every ingredient - rare, costly herbs that couldn't be found at any run-of-the-mill pharmacy Only Aetheris Pharmacy would carry these.



A surge of shock passed through him. Even with his premium membership and discounted rates at Aetheris, he wouldn't come close to affording the medicines listed here.



With a tremor in his voice, he asked, stunned, "Are you saying Rylie prescribed all this?"


The servant nodded. "Yes, sir. Miss Rylie Kirk used to send these to Mrs. Tessa Kirk regularly. After she left,the deliveries stopped."



Confused, Tessa looked up. "Is there a problem? Did Rylie send me something harmful?"



Leland shook his head, lips trembling. "No, these are the finest medicines money can buy. The total cost...it's more than tens of millions."



Tessa's eyes went round with disbelief. The glass slipped from her grasp and hit the floor with a crash,sending water everywhere.


"Tens of millions?" Her voice changed pitch, her  hands fisting the sheet in shock. "Where would Rylie get that kind of money? She...she even needed us to pay for her tuition..."



Her words faded as old memories resurfaced-bottles and vials in Rylie's room, tossed away by Stacey without a second thought. Beautiful containers holding what she'd assumed were suspicious or worthless remedies, now revealed as treasures.



Leland looked as if all the color had been drained from his face. He fumbled for his phone. "I'm calling Aetheris Pharmacy right now." His hands shook as he dialed, then he paused and turned to the servant."What about the medicines Rylie left for Nicolas? Do we still have any of them?"


The servant hesitated before reaching into an apron pocket, pulling out a yellowed slip of paper."She always tucked the prescription beneath the jars after mixing them. I thought it best to keep it safe."



Leland took the note with trembling fingers.



He scanned the list-each medicine named in Rylie's steady handwriting was rarer and more potent than the last. Some of these herbs could fetch fortunes on the underground market. For Rylie, it seemed as ordinary as scribbling out a recipe for soup.



Just then, the call connected with a ping. A crisp, cool voice from Aetheris Pharmacy answered,"Dr. Kirk, all of those ingredients were bought up by an anonymous client last year. And as you're no longer a premium member at Aetheris, we won't be able to assist you. Goodbye, and best of luck-"



Leland stared at his phone in horror. "No longer a member? How is that possible?"



He never got an explanation. The line went dead,leaving a heavy, anxious silence in the hospital room.



A vivid flash of memory seized Tessa-the dazzling spotlight at the mall, the deference shown to Rylie by every bodyguard. Her fingers clung to Leland's coat,her voice shaking. "Rylie... she's the Owen family's daughter. She really is."
###Chapter 46 Visiting The Owen Family

Stillness pressed in on the hospital room, as heavy as a sealed crypt.


Leland's frown deepened. After a long pause,he answered, "I've sensed for a while that Rylie was hiding something,but she's been treating you and Nicolas for years. If she really belonged to the Owens,wouldn't they have claimed her long ago? Why would they let her live with us all this time?"



Tessa gradually calmed down. "If that's not the case,then where did she get all that money to buy us these precious medicines? Did she secretly embezzle funds from our company?"



Leland shook his head, weariness in his tone. "These prescriptions cost tens of millions, Mom. If she'd funneled it out of the family accounts, Dad and Nicolas would have caught on long ago. The only explanation is that Rylie's truly exceptional - her medical expertise is world-renowned, respected even at Aetheris Pharmacy."



He remembered running into Rylie at Aetheris and thinking that she had followed him there. Now, he realized that she must have been there for business -as a consultant, or perhaps even as their advisor.



Regret hit hard as Leland realized how many chances he had missed, how easily he had been led by Stacey's rumors.


Tessa was stilI trying to process it all. "But she's so young! How could she be a medical expert?"


Their eyes met. Leland managed a rueful smile."If there's any hope for you and Nicolas, we'll have to swallow our pride and ask Rylie for help. An apology might go a long way."



In the past, a word from them could have prompted Rylie to help, but now Leland understood that Rylie had grown distant and might not be willing to assist.



Jaw clenched, Tessa refused to yield. "You want me to apologize? After all those years of raising her? She owes us! She should be the one thanking me and doing all she could to help us!"



Leland just sighed. "Let's not fight about this now. In a few days-"



He was cut off by Stacey's panicked voice over the phone. "Leland, do you know what's happening with the three-hundred-million-dollar project? The Owen family was supposed to hand it to the Dury family-now something's wrong! Fred won't even return my  calls!"



Leland was momentarily speechless. "What do you mean? The deal fell through?"


Stacey's voice was thin with panic. "Yes! Fred said the Dury family put up at least half their fortune as collateral for this project. Now Owen Group has announced that Dury breached the contract, and their deposit has been confiscated. Leland, what's happening?"



With Fred tying up so much of his family's resources,the loss of this project spelled disaster for the Durys.



Leland's complexion paled. "You just got engaged to Fred, and our family invested in Dury shares so we could get a piece of that three-hundred-million-dollar project. If this falls apart now, the fallout will hit us too..."



Stacey was growing frantic. "What should we do?I tried talking to Dad, but he's locked in his office,hasn't said a word or answered my calls in days."



"He's probably aware of everything already." Leland's mind was racing-he was the only one left to act,the only one with any chance of salvaging things. He'd have to get in touch with Fred and see if the damage could be undone,



The moment Stacey realized that Leland was planning to approach the Owens, she chimed in, "Take me with you, Leland. I promise not to make a scene- I just want everyone to know I stand with the Kirk family,and I'lI support you no matter what."



Something in Leland eased a little. "Alright. We'll go together."


Fred, meanwhile, had suffered a breakdown after his confrontation at Owen Group. By evening, he was admitted to the hospital for psychiatric care. He spent his lucid moments muttering, "There's been a mistake.This isn't real. It can't be."



Neither of Fred's parents had the faintest clue what went wrong during his visit to the Owen Group's subsidiary, but their worry only grew.



As the Kirks prepared their visit to the Owen family,Tessa-legs aching-allowed herself to be helped by Stacey and joined the group.



When they arrived at Serenity Manor, the servants quickly informed Kendrick. He had no interest in dealing with them directly and left everything in Deandre's hands.



Leland and Kenneth Dury, Fred's father, went on ahead to speak with Deandre, while the others were shown around the manor's gardens by a group of attentive servants.
Just before he left, Leland turned to his mother and sister. "Mom, Stacey, remember-we're meeting Mr.Deandre Owen with Mr. Dury. This isn't just any prominent family. Mind your manners and try to leave a positive impression."


Tessa gave a brisk nod. "Don't worry, I know what's at stake."



Meanwhile,Rylie was preparing for the charity gala Paola had mentioned earlier. She'd arranged for a trusted assistant to bring over a jewelry box from her private collection, and the delivery was now waiting at Serenity Manor's front door.



Inside the box was a rare treasure she'd picked up at a discreet auction-an heirloom from a royal lineage,elegant and timeless, valuable without being flashy.



A servant knocked lightly at her bedroom door and said, "Miss Owen, there's a package for you at the entrance that needs your signature."



"Alright, I'll be there," Rylie replied, stepping out of her room with an easy stride, only to run right into Tessa, Stacey, and Fred's mother, Octavia Dury. The three of them were being escorted through the hall.


They stopped in their tracks, startled by the sight of her.
Stacey, taking in Rylie's plain clothes, couldn't stop herself from blurting out, "Rylie, don't tell me you've ended up as a servant for the Owen family!"


Tessa's gaze flickered to the elderly woman dressed in a servant's uniform standing near Rylie. Stacey's words suddenly made sense. Tessa examined the woman closely, and her demeanor softened in relief.


This must be Rylie's biological mother, she thought


A strange sense of reassurance settled over Tessa. No matter how skilled Rylie was, there was no way she could be the Owen family's real daughter. Perhaps her medical talents had gotten her into Aetheris Pharmacy's good graces, but at the end of the day,she was just following her birth mother around as a servant.



In Tessa's eyes, Rylie's position here looked even bleaker than what she had endured with the Kirk family.



Despite the look of sympathy plastered across Stacey's face, her thoughts mirrored Tessa's completely.



She remarked, "Rylie, is it hard working here? This isn't the Kirk house, you know. Here, you can't do as you please. You'd better follow the rules and stay out of trouble."
The servant by Rylie's side seemed startled and offended by the comment, ready to jump in with a correction, but Rylie addressed it first. "You really don't need to worry about me."
###Chapter 47 Please, Show Us Some Mercy
Rylie shifted her eyes to Tessa's legs. The signs of deformity were becoming harder to miss. She spoke with quiet caution.



"You should stop using whatever Stacey gave you.Keep that up, and you might end up like Nicolas."



Stacey flinched. Her voice turned meek. "I never mishandled Mom's medicine. It was you who cut it off.Her pain never eased after that. I only asked Marsha to help her feel better."



Rylie narrowed her eyes. Was she supposed to carry the blame again?


Rylie didn't waste another word. Turning on her heel,she walked away. Tessa, realizing that she still needed Rylie's treatment, swallowed her frustration. Her tone softened. "Rylie, I know how skilled you are. Aetheris Pharmacy even recognizes your ability. You wouldn't be able to afford those high-end prescriptions otherwise. Though you're not my biological daughter,I've raised you for nearly twenty years, and I do care about you. I don't want to see your talent wasted here."


Rylie stopped mid-step and looked back. "Wasted?"
Tessa nodded with a rehearsed smile. "I'll make a new announcement. You and your mother will live with us.From now on, you'll be my private medical adviser.You'll handle my prescriptions and give me massages.Isn't that better than playing servant in this house?"



Rylie's lips twitched. Tessa always managed to sound generous while being selfish.


She let out a short laugh. "The Kirk family fell apart because of foolish people like you. You keep stirring messes no one wants."



Stacey sprang up, defensive. "Rylie! Mom always meant well. Why do you keep turning on her?"


Octavia had kept quiet until now, but the shift in the servants' faces caught her attention.



She reached for Tessa's arm to keep her from saying more. But Tessa, too full of pride to listen, pressed on Her voice aimed at the servant beside Rylie. "That girl was adopted into our family. I did everything I could to raise her, but she turned out wrong. Always wild.Never proper. And you let her and her mother stay here, like nothing's wrong. Do you even realize the kind of trouble they might bring?"



The servant who was mistaken for Rylie's mother stiffened. Her eyes were filled with disbelief and fury."Mrs. Kirk, Miss Kirk, what are you talking about? I am Before she could finish, a new voice rang out. "What's all this noise?"



Marcus, just returning from a visit to the music association, spotted the commotion. His eyes narrowed as he made his way toward them.



Stacey's entire face lit up at the sight of him.



Tessa, recognizing the cut of his suit and the quality of his watch, immediately toned down her attitude.



Octavia, quick to adjust, stepped forward with a polished smile. "Good afternoon, Mr. Owen. I'm Octavia Dury."


Marcus returned a slight nod, then looked at Rylie."There's a package at the entrance waiting for your signature. It's been sitting there for some time."


The moment she heard his warm and familiar tone directed at Rylie, Octavia's stomach turned. A sense of dread settled over her.



Rylie cast a glance at Tessa, then looked to Marcus with deliberate calm. "The Kirks tried to stop me from working for the Owen family. They wanted me to go back and serve as Mrs. Kirk's private masseuse instead."



Not a single person spoke. The air hung heavy with silence.



Tessa, unaware of how dire the moment had become,rushed to speak. "Mr. Owen, you probably don't know,but this girl used to be part of our household. I'm just trying to help her avoid a life of drudgery. I don't want her trapped in a seivant's role like her mother. My intentions are kind-"



The servant beside Rylie had finally heard enough.Her voice rang out sharp with fury. "What sort of nonsense is that? How could Miss Owen be my daughter?"



Tessa's fawning smile slipped away in an instant.



Marcus turned to her. His voice remained polite, but the chill in his words made the warning unmistakable."Is that how you speak of the Owen family's daughter?You dare say she's a maid? A masseuse?"



His words landed hard. Tessa felt the shock ripple through her.



Her knees gave slightly under her. "What...What did you say?"



Octavia looked as if lightning had cracked through a calm sky. She froze, eyes wide. Rylie? The long-lost daughter of the Owen family? If that were true, then her son had nearly married into the Owen family-without even knowng it.
The realization struck with brutal force. In a blink,everything made sense-the way Fred had gained that three-hundred-million-project-the way it had been yanked away just as quickly. It had all been because of Rylie. Had they left the engagement untouched,their family could've broken into the elite class of society.



Regret burned through Octavia, leaving her face tight with remorse.



Stacey,unwilling to accept it, blurted out loud, "Rylie?That girl from nowhere? You're saying she's an Owen?That's impossible!"



Before anyone could respond, a reprimanding voice echoed nearby. "Why so much noise? Mr. Kendrick Owen is trying to rest!"


An old butler trailed behind Kendrick as he made his way forward.



Rylie, whose expression was usually unreadable,now wore a faint smile as she stepped toward the old man."Grandpa."



She approached with ease and added softly, "I hope we didn't disturb your rest."


"Age steals sleep from us. Don't worry about it."Kendrick placed a gentle hand on her head. His eyes were warm with affection. "What's all this ruckus?" He paused briefly, noticing her attire. "Why aren't you dressed yet? Didn't you plan to meet Paola at six for the charity gala?"


Rylie kept her tone light as she answered, "Yes, I just bumped into a few familiar faces."



Kendrick turned to Tessa and asked Rylie plainly,"What were you discussing?"



Marcus answered before she could speak, "Not much,really. They were just saying Rylie should go back to being Mrs. Kirk's personal masseuse. A live-in servant,essentially.What do you think of that,Grandpa?"


Kendrick's expression changed in an instant. The warmth in his eyes faded. "So you think the daughter of the Owen family should be sent back as someone's household help? After how you treated her?"



Tessa's complexion turned ghostly. "That's not what meant. I had no idea Rylie was from the Owen bloodline."



Kendrick gave a cold, bitter laugh. He cast a hard look at Octavia and snapped, "Do you really believe all those business opportunities landed in your hands by coincidence? And then you come here and speak so proudly?"


"No,no,no, I didn't mean it! I never said a thing about this!" Octavia, overcome by panic, nearly dropped to her knees. "I never insulted Rylie. This is all Tessa's fault. She's the one who caused this. Our family has always thought highly of Rylie. It's Stacey who ruíned everything by chasing after Fred. If not for her, Rylie would have been part of our family by now!"


Desperate to save face, Octavia scrambled to recover the situation, adding, "Once we return, we'll break off all ties with the Kirks. I swear it. Please, Mr. Owen,show us some mercy. The Dury family can't survive without your support!"
###Chapter 48 Too Late To Regret It
Stacey gasped for air, her body threatening to give out, while Tessa looked just as shaken. Clinging to each other, Tessa's voice trembled as she stammered,"Stacey, d-did you hear what he just said?"



The truth crashed down on Stacey, imnpossible to ignore. Rylie, the girl she'd gone to such lengths to exile, had not sunk into hardship - she'd risen to become the beloved granddaughter of the world's richest man.



"No,it can't be... it just can't!" Stacey's face lost all color, her lips quivering as she refused to believe what she was seeing. "Why would Rylie end up with everything?" The shock left her swaying, barely able to stand.



Tessa's instincts kicked in as she hurried to steady her."Stacey, hold on!"



With a cold stare, Rylie watched their drama unfold,her mouth twisting into a sly, mocking grin. "Relax She's having a fit, not dropping dead."



Kendrick gave a low, disdainful snort. Turning to the butler, he said, "See them out before they make more of a scene."



Wasting no time, the butler moved in, his tone courteous but unyielding. "Ladies, I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave."



Sensing which way the wind was blowing, Octavia quickly put space between herself and the others,slipping away without so much as a glance back at Tessa and Stacey.



Tessa,still holding up a faltering Stacey, kept her eyes downcast and left quietly, humiliation burning in her cheeks.



Jealousy and panic flickered in Stacey's eyes as she cast one last look over her shoulder at Rylie.



Rylie didn't return the glance. She simply turned to Kendrick and said, "Grandpa, I'll sign for my delivery and get ready for my appointment."



With a gentle nod, Kendrick said, "Go on, Rylie. Don't keep them waiting."



A faint smile lingered on Rylie's lips as she stepped away.


Elsewhere, in Deandre's study, Leland and Kenneth were fighting desperately to save what remained of their family businesses.
Impatience radiated from Deandre as he leaned back in his chair, voice sharp and unforgiving. "It was the Dury family who violated the agreement first, so my brother is within his rights to reclaim the project. The Kirks chose to ally themselves with the Durys-now you'll have to live with the consequences."


Sweat began to bead along Leland's brow. "Mr. Owen,I think there's been a mistake. We're ready to make reparations for the losses. Couldn't you give us another opportunity?"


A bitter, cold laugh slipped from Deandre."A second chance? Do you remember how your family tormented my sister all those years just to please Stacey? And now you stand here asking for mercy?"


Leland's eyes widened in disbelief. "Your sister?"


At that exact moment, the door swung open and Marcus entered, his tone even and composed."Deandre, Grandfather wanted me to relay this:from today forward, neither the Kirks nor the Durys are allowed to set foot in Owen Group or residence."


A rebellious smirk flickered on Deandre's lips. "About time. I'm done with the polite act. Honestly, I'm itching for a real fight with those two families."



Shock hit Leland like a blow, draining the color from his face.
Kenneth,collapsed in defeat, stared at his hands and whispered, "We're finished...there's nothing left..."



With a cold glint in his eye. Deandre rose and motioned to the door. "You can show yourselves out now."



Meanwhile, Rylie was collecting her delivery at the entrance when the Kirk family appeared again. From across the way, Tessa shouted, "Rylie! I was wrong!Please, forgive me!"



Without a word or a flicker of emotion, Rylie signed for her parcel, nausea rising in her throat, and walked away without looking back







Inside the Morgan residence, a quiet tension lingered.



Naval drills had just wrapped up, and Brock finished briefing Brad on military affairs before moving on to the latest Morgan family updates. "The Owen family's $300 million business district bid just went public. Our team is already negotiating, and we expect the contract to be sealed next week. You've also received an invitation to the medical school's hundredth anniversary, and there's a charity gala tonight. In two days, the aerospace tech expo opens-they're eager to know if you'll attend."
Brad fiddled with the military formations on the sand table before him, not even raising his head. "I need to focus on recovery. Set aside everything except the Owen deal."



Only the most important items warranted his attention now; all distractions could wait



"Yes, sir." Brock gave a crisp salute and slid the Owen project folder closer


A question drifted out as Brad's eyes narrowed."What's the latest from the Owens?"



A thoughtful pause stretched while Brock sorted his thoughts-Brad was surely asking about Rylie. "Miss Owen's engagement to Fred Dury was called off not long ago. Then the Owens abruptly pulled ouut of the three-hundred-million project,plunging both the Kirk and Dury families into chaos. With bankruptcy on the horizon, they've turned their bitterness toward Miss Owen. Moreover, the Wilde family - the giants in medicine - are watching her closely. Strangely,though, every shadow they sent her way has disappeared. Our guess? Miss Owen orchestrated their removal herself. The Owens seem to be in the dark.There are also a few assassination bounties on her head,but so far, no one has made a move."



A faint smile ghosted across Brad's face as he tapped the table. "She's the key to my survival, Brock. If she prefers a low profile, we'll see that she stays out of the limelight. Now, as for the Kirks and the Durys..."


His hand swept across the sand table, plucking up a flag and tossing it aside with finality. "Clean up the mess for her. Make sure those families don't get another chance to rise."



Brock gave a firm nod. "Understood, sir."


As the gala drew near. Paola-after taking her time with hair and makeup-finally called Rylie. Her tone was sweetly apologetic. "Rylie, sorry! My styling ran late today. If I send the car now, we'll miss the event.Would you mind getting there on your own?"
###Chapter 49 Too Scared To Show Her Face
Rylie checked the time. "Only thirty minutes left, and you're just telling me now?"



Paola's voice came through the line, soft and apologetic. "I'm really sorry. I was up all night working on the music.I must've dozed off while getting ready I can send a driver right now if you want."



A male voice broke in from the background. "Why do you keep saying sorry to her? Does she think being part of the Owen family makes her better than everyone else? She spent time in some forgotten town and now walks around like she owns you. What kind of attitude is that?"①



Without a word, Rylie ended the call. So that was the plan? They wanted to make her show up late and look ridiculous?



Without wasting another moment, she dialed a different number The line rang twice before a deep voice answered, "Miss Owen, or should|say, Dr.Owen?"



"Just call me Rylie," she said. "I need your help.Mind if I borrow the helicopter? I'll subtract it from your next bill."
Brad hadn't expected to hear from her. He glanced down, fingers toying with the model warship on his desk. "Another emergency?"


"I have to be at the Darkwell charity gala," she said plainly. "Can you manage it?"



Brad straightened his cuff and smiled faintly. "Funny you called. I'm heading there myself. Why don't we go together?"



Once the call ended, Brad turned to Brock, who was standing nearby. "Didn't you say it's a charity event?We shouldn't skip something like that. Make the preparations. We're going."



Brock stood frozen for a second. Just earlier, Brad insisted that he wasn't going. Now, after that phone call, everything changed? Wasn't this the same man who was supposed to be on medical leave?



"Alright-"



As he left to get things ready, Brock couldn't help but mutter under his breath. It turned out that even a man like Brad wasn't immune to flipping his decisions,especially when a woman like Rylie was involved.







Rylie stepped onto the lawn, her evening gown trailing behind her as the roar of a helicopter sliced through the air. Wind whipped around her legs, tugging at the hem of her dress.



She raised her hand to block the breeze, her hair lifting in soft waves from the downwash. The aircraft settled above the grass.



As the cabin door swunng open, Brad stood in the doorway, dressed in a sharp black suit. He waited with one hand extended, his stance calm and assured.


A faint smile tugged at his lips. His voice carried with ease. "Please."



Without hesitation, she placed her hand in his. His fingers wrapped around hers, steady and sure, guiding her inside the cabin.



Once she was seated, he let go of her hand with quiet politeness and leaned slightly toward her. "You're heading to the charity gala. Didn't your staff warn you about the time? | figured your brothers would've sent a driver."



"I've got a car," she said. "But Paola insisted on going together, so I waited." Her eyes cooled. A wry tone crept into her voice. "She stayed up all night writing music and passed out at the salon. No time to pick me up. If I'd driven to Darkwell myself, l'd have arrived even later."
Brad's gaze lingered. He took in her appearance for a brief moment before speaking with calm precision."Given your background, it makes sense. You're a direct descendant of the esteemed Owen family,with your grandfather's business empire stretching across continents and your brothers predominantly based overseas. Most of your brothers operate overseas.That leaves your uncle, Terrance Owen, to manage the branch in Crolens. It's no surprise someone like Paola tries to take advantage while you're here." 1



She studied him, amused. "You know quite a bit about my family. I thought you spent most of your time at sea."



Brad gave a soft laugh. "Everyone has their sources.Or a network of their own. Don't you think?"



His words held a deeper meaning, and Rylie didn't refute it, understanding that he was explaining the Owen family's complex network for her benefit.



"How much of the Owen assets sit under that branch?"she asked.



"Just the territory in Crolens, with little overseas business," Brad replied coolly. "Not worth worrying about."



Rylie nodded and said, "As long as they don't provoke me, I won't take action."
The helicopter began to descend. Moments later, it touched down on the helipad near the Darkwell venue.



The event had just started. As she stepped out, Brad remained behind. He had his own entrance, one that kept him away from public eyes.



Rylie chose not to walk in with Brad. Just before they went their separate ways, she gave a small smile and said, "Looks like there'll be a bit of a performance tonight."



Brad smiled faintly. "I'll be watching," he said.



Inside the venue, Paola sat among a cluster of well-dressed young women. Now and then, their gazes drifted toward the entrance.



Isabella leaned in and murmured, "Is she too scared to show her face? Maybe she's worried she'll embarrass herself."



Paola gave a quick shake of her head. With Johnny Reid sitting nearby, she couldn't risk agreeing out loud Instead, she took a softer approach. "It makes sense for Rylie to be nervous. This is her first time at such a high-profile event. I really should've gone to fetch her myself."



Johnny reached for her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. "You've already done so much. You're thoughtful, even when you're tired." He looked toward the door. "If Rylie has any sense, she'll stay away. With you here, the Owen family's already well represented."



Paola dropped her gaze, cheeks tinged pink."I'm nothing special. There's no real difference between the two of us."



As their conversation faded, the main doors opened with a hush.



Two staff members gave a courteous nod and announced, "Miss Owen has arrived."



It was her first public appearance since returning to the Owen family. Naturally, every head turned in her direction.



Paola's expression changed instantly. Her eyes widened with anticipation, tinged with glee at the thought of Rylie being humiliated. The corners of her lips lifted as she whispered with giddy disbelief, "She actually came."



And just then...
###Chapter 50 Real And Fake Jewelry
Right as Paola spotted Rylie, the look on her face stiffened.What she saw wasn't what she had imagined.Rylie had not arrived in a cheap dress, nor did she look the least bit uneasy.



Johnny narrowed his eyes and studied her. "So this is the Owen girl we've heard so much about? She's nothing like the rumors going around."



Rylie wore a form-fitting black satin gown that left her shoulders bare. Her hair was neatly pulled up. A vintage necklace rested against her collarbone. The whole look was polished and refined.



Paola forced a smile. "Of course. I've always said Rylie and I were similar. We both carry ourselves like ladies."



"She doesn't just look refined. She looks like she runs the place." Intrigued, Johnny commented, "Look at the way she interacts with others; it's the air of sophistication. It seems she's learned well to represent the Owen family without embarrassment at this gala."



Paola clenched her hands at her sides. She replied quickly, though her thoughts were in disarray.
She knew that she had to keep Johnny's interest on her. The Reid family had power, especially in maritime trade. Not quite the Morgans,but still valuable. Johnny might make a decent husband.



"I saved a seat for you, Rylie. Come sit here." Paola took slow steps toward her and looped her arm around Rylie's. Her smile looked apologetic. "Sorry about earlier. I made you late."


Rylie's eyes were cool. "Even though you and your parents are just a branch of the Owen family,you are still an Owen after all. Showing up on time is the least you could do. Do I need to keep reminding you of that?"



The words hit hard. Paola hadn't expected to be scolded like that, especially not in front of so many people. Her cheeks flushed, and her voice wavered "I worked late last night. I didn't mean to hold you up.Nexttime, I'll make sure I'm not late."



Her friends couldn't stay quiet any longer. Isabella stepped forward and said, "Paola was working on music for a director. She's exhausted. Can't you cut her some slack? You don't even work. You spend your days doing nothing but lounging around. Why should you scold her?"



"Is that so?" Rylie's stare turned sharp. "Since when does an outsider like you have the right to decide whether I can discipline my family members or not?And you say I do nothing all day. Where did that come from? If it didn't come from gossip, then it came from watching me. Either way, it's a violation of privacy.Have you been spying on our household? Did you plant devices? Or sneak into our system?"



She shifted her gaze and added plainly, "Miss Olson, I think I'll have the police inspect the entire house."



Her voice was steady but left no room for argument.Isabella stepped back, rattled. Her hands moved nervously as she blurted,"How absurd! Why would I bug your house? That's ridiculous!"


"If not that, then how else do you know what I do each day? Or are you simply spreading lies?" Rylie asked without changing her tone. "Seems like manners aren't something your family passed down very well."



Rylie had the final word, and Isabella stood humiliated.Had she chosen to escalate things, the Owen family could have easily crushed the Olsons without lifting a finger.



Sensing that the situation had spiraled out of control,Paola quickly stepped in. "Rylie, please don't be upset.Isabella meant no harm. She only said those things out of worry for me." Tears gathered in her eyes as her voice wavered, trying to appear pitiful.
"We're one family, Paola. Have you forgotten that we share each other's burdens?" Rylie's lips pulled into a faint smile, though it lacked warmth. "And yet you let your friends shame our name. Do you want people to think the Owen family breeds idleness?"



The weight of the accusation hit Paola hard. She clenched her fists but couldn't offer a single rebuttal.Her anger simmered, but all she could do was lower her gaze and mumble, "Fine, Rylie. I'll remember this."



Rylie turned from her and addressed the guests at the table with calm grace. "Please excuse the scene.I hope it hasn't disrupted your evening."



Her composure drew silent admiration. Many in the room, who had quietly dismissed her at first, now watched her more carefully.



The event was hosted by the Buckleys, known throughout the industry for their jewelry empire. This time, the auction aimed to help children living in poverty-stricken and isolated regions.



As things settled down, Celia Buckley stepped onstage.She wore a pale gold gown that shimmered beneath the lights.



Her voice rang clear as she greeted the guests."Thank you for joining us tonight. The Buckley family is honored by your presence at this charity gala."
She continued with poise after a brief pause,"Tonight's auction features pieces from our personal collection. Twenty percent of the sales will go toward education and medical needs for children in less fortunate areas."



Her words paused again as she surveyed the room.Her gaze swept across the first floor, then briefly stopped on one of the private viewing boxes above."Of course, it's not about the price of a bid. True charity lies in your intent. Whether the amount is high or low, every participant here is helping the children."



Just as Celia delivered her remarks, Isabella, still seething over her earlier embarrassment, noticed something odd. Both Celia and Rylie wore nearly identical necklaces.



Isabella studied the necklace around Rylie's neck, then turned her attention to the stage. Her earlier frustration gave way to sudden delight. "Doesn't it look like Miss Owen's necklace is exactly the same as Miss Buckley's?"



She tried to sound curious as she added, "Can anyone help me figure this out? I'd hate to accuse her unfairly and get scolded again."


A few guests began to murmur. Were the necklaces really that similar? Was Rylie wearing a fake?
The people seated nearby leaned in, comparing the two necklaces. One by one, their expressions shifted as their focus returned to Rylie



"They match perfectly. What's going on? Miss Owen,did your brothers only support Paola and not you? ls that why you couldn't get your hands on the original?"



"This is starting to look bad."



"She lectured Paola earlier like she was some authority."



Not even Paola had expected things to go this way.Still, the moment worked in her favor. Rylie's embarrassment gave her the chance to appear composed and kind. She stepped in gently. "Rylie must have made a mnistake. She probably didn't realize it was a replica. She doesn't have much knowledge about jewelry. Please don't be too harsh."



Then she leaned in close to whisper in Rylie's ear,"Take it off before too many people notice.Like you said earlier, we can't let the Owen family lose face."
###Chapter 51Whose Necklace Is Real

Rylie caught the smugness beneath Paola's voice but didn't react. She stayed calm in her seat and looked up at Celia on the stage. "It's quite a coincidence, but my jewelry isn't fake."


Paola faltered for a moment, trying to mask the irritation curling in her chest. She forced a smile and said, "Rylie, Miss Buckley's father owns a jewelry empire. Do you really think she'd fail to tell the difference between real and fake? Save yourself the embarrassment. Just take it off."



Isabella let out a laugh. "Paola, don't waste your breath. Rylie's too stubborn. She'd rather face Miss Buckley head-on than admit she's wrong."


Celia,still onstage, had already noticed the attention circling around Rylie and the matching necklace.



After wrapping up her speech, she stepped down carefully, gathering the hem of her dress as she made her way to the table.



In the private box above, Brad swirled his wine lazily.Brock leaned closer and murmured, "Dr. Owen's about to get chewed up. That knockoff necklace looks just  like Celia's. She's surrounded by sharks. Should we step in?"


Brad gave a dry laugh. "That depends. Who do you think the shark really is right now?"


"You mean to say Dr. Owen's necklace might be real?"asked Brock.



"I haven't confirmed anything," Brad replied, smirking "But she invited me here for entertainment. Let's just say she never fails to put on a show."



Celia reached the table, lifted her glass, and tapped Johnny's with a soft clink. "That eigteen-carat red diamond your grandmother likes is among the auction items tonight. Keep an eye on it, or it might disappear."



Johnny nodded and took a sip. "Appreciate the heads -up."


Just then, Isabella raised her voice. "Miss Buckley,your necklace looks identical to Miss Owen's. Was there ever a second one made? Isn't it odd you're both wearing them tonight?"


Celia turned toward Rylie and gave her a long look."This necklace is an heirloom. It's been in my family for three centuries. A queen once owned it. There is only one like it."


Then she looked directly at her. "Miss Owen, mind sharing where yours came from?"



Rylie brought her fingers to the sapphire resting at her collar. "Miss Buckley, are you certain yours is the authentic one?"



Celia's brows dipped faintly as she answered, steady and sure, "Of course it is. This piece is called 'Ocean's Tear.' It hasn't left our vault in over three centuries."


Rylie lifted her head, her voice calm yet pointed."Now that's interesting. This one, too, came from royal lineage, crafted three hundred years ago using age-old methods. The stones were hand-cut by court jewelers, each one bearing the royal mark."


Celia's face wavered for a second, but she laughed lightly and replied, "Miss Owen, imitations these days are surprisingly convincing. Still, the precision and artistry of true heirlooms can't be copied."



Paola quickly backed her up. "Exactly. Miss Buckley's necklace has been passed down in her family for generations. It wouldn't be right to suggest hers is a fake.You should stop acting like this."



Rylie didn't flinch. She simply turned her necklace around so the back was visible to the room.



"If we're talking about craftsmanship, why not let everyone judge for themselves?" Her voice was even,almost too composed. "Genuine royal pieces are marked in secret spots. It helps stop counterfeits from circulating." She held up the clasp. "This one has 'E.V.1732' etched into it. That stands for Edmund Verne, a master jeweler from the royal court."



At that, several guests leaned closer. When they spotted the engraving, murmurs rippled through the crowd, and some even leaned over to get a better look at Celia's necklace. Those familiar with antique jewelry began to exchange looks.



"It's not the same," whispered someone.



Celia's hand darted to her own necklace. Her fingers trembled as they brushed against the metal. There was no engraving.



Rylie didn't miss a beat. "Also, real royal sapphires produce a velvet-like glow under proper lighting.That glow can't be copied. It comes from the minerals formed under intense pressure."



She turned just enough for the chandelier's light to land on the necklace.



In a flash, the gems around Rylie's neck seemed to stir with life, rippling like the sea and glinting like stars scattered across a midnight sky.


Celia's necklace, by comparison, looked flat. The blue hue was bright, but it lacked any real glow.
Nobody in the room made a sound.


Isabella went pale. Paola clenched her gown so hard that her nails dug into the fabric. Neither could understand how someone like Rylie, with no high society upbringing and a background in only medicine,could speak so confidently about rare jewels.



Isabella snapped, her voice rising, "You're just making things up! What could you possibly know about jewelry? Miss Buckley has lived among gems since childhood.She wouldn't be wrong about her own necklace!"



Paola,clearly rattled, tried to hush the situation. "Rylie,stop this nonsense. You know where you are tonight.Apologize to Miss Buckley,now."



But Rylie didn't pay any attention to those two troublemakers. Her focus wvas fixed on Celia. "Miss Buckley, would you care to explain why your so-called heirloom has no marking and no velvet shimmer?"



Celia's breathing picked up, though she held her composure behind a faint smile. "That could be due to how it was stored. A slight change in preservation might explain the difference in appearance."



"Is that what you believe?" Rylie let out a soft laugh."That necklace was first auctioned at Wainwright Auction House. It came with full documentation of its history. But it was switched mid-auction by a thief. Its last confirmed sighting was five years ago on the black market overseas. Someone paid a fortune for it."


She paused briefly before adding, "Back then,it was valued at one hundred million. If that's the piece your family bought, then I'm afraid you've been scammed That's a very expensive mistake."


Celia's steps faltered, her color drained. "That's not true. You're lying."


Rylie answered gently, "I wish I were. But it's the truth."



By now, the stir around their table had drawn attention from others nearby. Keeping her tone even, Rylie spoke again. "Miss Buckley, will the auction continue as planned, or should we call some experts to take a proper look at both necklaces right here?"
###Chapter 52 There's An Assassin
Celia had grown up surrounded by jewelry. She understood, deep down, that Rylie hadn't been wrong The necklace that she wore was a fake.Her family had trusted international auctions without question and never imagined that it might be a counterfeit. For years, they kept it locked in their safe, believing it to be a treasured heirloom. Wearing it for the first time tonight had made her look foolish. Still, she had a way out.



Celia steadied her voice and said, "There's no need for more discussion. Miss Owen, thank you for telling me the truth. I need to go to the toilet now."


As she turned, Rylie spoke up, calm and composed."This replica may lack history, but the craftsmanship is still impressive. Even without the legacy, it's a fine piece to keep."



Celia slowed, looked back, and gave a nod. "Thank you."



After Celia walked away, the table fell into silence.Isabella, who earlier had hoped that Rylie would be humiliated,now sat staring at her lap, her face drained of color.



Johnny raised his glass toward Rylie. "Miss Owen, I didn't expect you to know so much about jewelry. You clearly live up to the Owen name. Here's to you."



Rylie touched her glass to his and answered with grace,"I only know a little. Forgive me if I came across as boastful."



Paola was awkwardly silent, unsure of what to say.Finally,she forced a smile and teased, "It's so lucky to always receive gifts. Rylie, your brothers gave you this set of jewelry, right? And you actually didn't tell me.I nearly embarrassed myself tonight because of it."



Everyone had seen how Paola insisted earlier that Rylie apologize. Now, the truth had flipped the situation on its head. She looked unprepared and unaware.



Rylie's tone remained light. "No one gave it to me."She met Paola's eyes and added, "We shouldn't always wait for others to gift us things. Buying what we want on our own is perfectly fine."



The smile slid off Paola's face. Her hands balled tightly in her lap. She hadn't expected Rylie to say it out loud-to hint that she relied on the family while Rylie stood independent. It was a blatant jab at her-suggesting that she was merely a dependent relyìng on the Owen family for appearances, while Rylie was the true, capable Owen daughter who stood on her own.



The guests seated nearby began trading glances, their smiles barely contained


"So Miss Garrett makes a habit of asking for presents   1



"No wonder she went after Miss Owen earlier. Sounds like envy to me."



A deep flush crept over Paola's ears as her smile stiffened. Her voice trembled as she tried to recover."Rylie, surely you're teasing. I only said so because think everyone in the Owen family loves you and that it's not surprise if they give you precious gifts-"



"Really?" Rylie swirled her wine glass with ease,her eyes playful but alert. "Then that's fine. But next, do remember to figure out what is really going on before jumping to conclusions." She paused. Her tone softened, though her words landed sharp. "That way,you won't humiliate yourself again."



The remark landed like a slap that Paola never saw coming. She lurched to her feet, the chair scraping across the polished floor.


"I... I need to freshen up." Her voice cracked as she rushed away.
Isabella stood up quickly and called after her, "Paola,wait! I'll come too!"



Their flustered exit left behind scattered giggles and stifled murmurs among the guests.



A woman in a silver dress leaned forward and said pointedly, "Miss Owen, I admire how you expose people's true colors with such few words."



Rylie offered a quiet smile, sipping her champagne as her gaze lifted toward the balcony above. Brad stood by the railing, watching from a distance. His eyes held hers. He raised his glass, the hint of a smirk playing on his lips.



Rylie tilted her head in acknowledgment, returning the Look with a faint, knowing smile.


Once the room settled, the auction began in earnest.Item after item dazzled the crowd as the auctioneer's voice rang out, driving the bids higher and higher.


Rylie leaned back in her chair, barely interested. These pieces, though lovely, were nothing compared to what she already owned.



She stifled a yawn, her gaze drifting lazily across the hall. A flicker of movement caught her attention. A server stood nearby-too still,too stiff.
Something felt wrong. A properly trained waiter wouldn't hold that posture. And his hand wasn't resting naturally under the tray. It was held firm, as though gripping something hidden. What kind of threat would even warrant a body like that here?



Rylie blinked once, and her casual air faded. Her back straightened. She scanned the crowd again, her eyes pausing on the second-floor balcony. The moment she saw the box, her expression changed.



That man wasn't here for just anyone. He was after Brad.



While the guests remained absorbed in the auction,Rylie rose to her feet. Johnny looked over and called out, "Miss Owen, the Buckley collections are coming up.Don't you want to see them?"



She answered with a simple, "Restroom break."Without hurry, she made her way toward the spiral staircase.Once she passed the last row of tables, her pace quickened. Her hand lifted the edge of her skirt just enough to move freely, heels clacking sharply across the floor.



The second level was hushed. Not a single voice drifted from the boxes. Rylie kept close to the wall until she caught a faint metallic sound just ahead. Her steps stopped. She turned the handle and pushed open the door without hesitation.
Inside, Brad reclined on a sofa, casually twirling a cup between his fingers. He glanced up at the sudden entry."Over already? I thought that show would last longer," he said.



Rylie slammed the door shut behind her and strode across the room. One hand grabbed his tie, yanking him downward. "There's an assassin."
###Chapter 53 Who Are These Assassins
Rylie's and Brad's faces drew so near that their cheeks brushed, breaths mingling in the hush between them.When their eyes met, she caught an unshakeable steadiness in his gaze - a cool assurance that revealed he'd already guessed about the assassins.Not a flicker of surprise touched his face.



Letting her hand drop, Rylie spoke. "You already knew."


Brad,still slightly hunched from her tug, kept his voice level. "That's just a soldier's instinct. But you, Dr.Owen, I'd say you're just as sharp. Did the Kirk brothers drill this into you, or is it all you?"



Rylie's tension melted as she realized that he truly had everything under control. "My family never taught me a thing. All of this is simply my own nature-sharp-eyed since birth."



Brad's mouth curved into a half-smile as he looked down at her. "No one's ever doubted your brilliance.And I noticed your concern for me, that's why you rushed in despite the risk."



Her eyebrow arched, Rylie studied his strikingly handsome features and, on a whim, reached out and pinched his chin.



Had there been any witnesses in the room, they'd have been startled by her audacity.


Rylie was testing the limits between them.


Though Brad stayed still, the subtle tension in his frame betrayed a side rarely seen beneath his composed exterior.



He asked softly, "Did I guess wrong?”


With her thumb idly tracing the line of his jaw, Rylie answered in a cool, quiet voice, "Given your health and position, you really have no business at these tiresome, low-rent charity galas. Why would the famous admiral suddenly take an interest in jewelry for debutantes?"



She stopped, her eyes lifting to meet his."Brad,you're here for me, aren't you?"



All traces of distant formality had vanished from her voice - what remained was a playful, grown-up boldness.



Before he could answer, the door swung open.


Brock entered,hauling a corpse, and said, "Mr. Morgan,it's done..."
Brock's words died in his throat, eyes going round with shock. He'd been busy clearing the grounds of assassins - only to return and find Rylie pinching Brad's chin, lost in a charged moment together.



When Rylie glanced over her shoulder, Brad's gaze trailed after her. Brock took the cue to beat a quick retreat, backing out and stammering, "Sorry, sorry, I'll let you two carry on!"


The door swung shut behind him.


Rylie let go of Brad's chin and stepped back, her subtle fragrance slipping away, leaving Brad with a faint sense of loss that he didn't care to admit.



"Looks like your people have things under control,"she remarked, already moving for the door. "I'll head out now."



Brad straightened, smoothing his jacket before following her to the exit. "Let me walk you out. The rest of this auction isn't worth sticking around for.The real entertainment's over."



Rylie slipped out the door, passing Brockas he quietly dealt with the last of the clean-up-his practiced efficiency clear in every move. There must have been no shortage of people hoping for Brad's demise.


She didn't bother asking who had put out the latest  hit. Still, as they descended the stairs together, Brad offered the explanation with the casual air of someone chatting about the weather. "There's been a recent oil discovery just offshore. Owhea wants in,so their navy's been running exercises close by."


Rylie's brow creased as she recalled the headline. "I remember seeing something about that. Didn't our fleet run drills as well?"



Brad let out a quiet laugh, adjusting his cufflinks."That was my command."



His tone shifted, a cold edge sharpening his words."One of Owhea's surveillance planes wandered too close and got shot down. They've been seething about it ever since."



Rylie arched a brow, her curiosity piqued. "So these assassins were sent by Owhea?"



"Odds are high their intelligence service is behind this,"Brad replied evenly, as if he were reciting stock prices."They're fond of shadow games like this."



Thinking back over Brad's headline-making career,Rylie chuckled. "You've eliminated more than a few of their operatives since you took command-and you manage to do it all in the name of duty. Not much they can say about it, can they?"



Catching sight of her laughter, Brad found himself distracted. Her smile had a way of outshining everything around her.


Noticing his lingering look, Rylie touched her cheek in confusion. "What is it?"



Brad halted beside her, then reached up to gently remove a fallen blossom from her hair. "Just the wind,"he murmured.



Rylie faltered for half a second,awkwardly lowering her hand. "Thanks."



The two stepped out into the corridor. The suspicious waiter she'd clocked earlier had long since vanished.



Meanwhile, inside the hall, Paola scoured the crowd for Rylie. She finally caught a glimpse of her leaving through a side door, accompanied by a tall man she didn't recognize.Who could he be?



Paola turned to Johnny, who was already rising from his seat, clearly bored. "If Miss Owen has lost interest in the jewelry, then it really must be dull tonight. Paola,I'm heading out."



Quick to react, Paola stood as well and whispered, "I just spotted Rylie leaving with a gentleman. No sense staying here either. Johnny, mind giving me a lift?"


Johnny raised an eyebrow. "Didn't you come with your driver? Wasn't it your delay with the car that made Rylie late to begin with?"


Johnny's bluntness caught Paola off guard, making her look down in embarrassment. "I wasn't trying to make things difficult. Are you blaming me too?"


Johnny shook his head. "That's not it. Just a reminder to be considerate next time. Working late isn't an excuse to keep people waiting." He saw straight through Paola's intentions - she was never just thoughtless.


Clearly uninterested in further entanglement,Johnny simply said, "I'm heading out."



The whole evening had left Paola simmering with frustration. Not only had she failed to embarrass Rylie,but she also became the one to be humiliated in front of every guest.



Back in her room, she flung her pillow onto the bed and exclaimed, "She's so infuriating! Always playing the innocent, and everyone falls for it. How does she manage to show up and eclipse me every single time?"Percy stood by the door, watching his sister's wounded pride with a troubled frown, his own sense of injustice growing on her behalf...
###Chapter 54 No One Decides For Me
"Rylie's just coasting on her brothers' affection,"Percy said, hoping to calm her. "One banquet and she's already walking off with some stranger.Sooner or later, everyone will see her for who she really is."He took a seat beside her. "Forget about her. Your focus now should be finishing that composition for Spencer. That international festival isn't going to wait. Let her dig her own hole. I'll help you show people who she really is."


Paola turned to the pile of blank sheets on her desk.Her fingers tensed around her pen. "You're right.Rylie can't match my talent in music, not now,not ever. I can't afford to waste energy on her."


Rylie was unaware that she had inadvertently motivated Paola to work through the night with renewed determination writing music. By dawn, with dark circles under her eyes, Paola was ecstatic as she held her completed work.
After a quick review, she delivered the finished score directly to Spencer's hands.


That same morning, Rylie had gotten plenty of sleep.After breakfast, she made her way to the community near the military compound, offering free check-ups to the elderly there. As she went from one patient to another, she sensed an odd heaviness in the air.They looked at her with troubled eyes but didn't speak up.


Rylie tried to coax them into talking, but they only gave vague smiles and shook their heads.Most left quietly after taking their prescriptions, leaving her uncertain and curious.


Rory was tending to the plants that day. Once he learned that Rylie was around, he stopped by and used the chance to bring up a few medical concerns.


During a short pause, she lowered her voice and asked, "Did something happen? Everyone seems off today."


"They're all on edge," Rory answered with a sigh."It's the drills at sea, the rising tension. War seems closer by the day. And most of their families are serving right at the front. They're scared, and rightfully so."


Rylie frowned, still uneasy. "I get that, but I could tell they wanted to say something more. It wasn't just fear.What aren't they telling me?"


Seeing that Rory seemed to know more, Rylie urged,"Tell me directly."


Rory looked away, speaking carefully. "Things have been rough these past two years. Military doctors are stretched thin, and some districts have no coverage at all. They're planning to draft civilian doctors from local hospitals, but the pay is low and the risks are high. Few are willing to go." He hesitated before adding, "Your name came up. They're afraid that if the shortage worsens, they'll ask you to step in. They believe in your skills. They think you're their best chance if something happens to their boys."


Rylie nodded slowly. "So that's it."


"I told them not to worry," Rory added. "With your standing in the Owen famnily, they won't let you be sent anywhere near danger."


Rylie held his gaze. "If the time comes, I'll go. Who l am doesn't depend on anyone's name. No one decides for me."


Rory gave her shoulder a light pat, his expression softening as another topic came to mind. "That young general from the Morgan family managed to get through the first phase of treatment. Still,everyone knows Nexo-7 doesn't offer lasting results.He might seem healthy for now, but we both understand the reality. The prognosis isn't promising.The Morgan family is holding a second-phase seminar soon. A number of medical elites are expected to attend. Will you be there?"


Rylie gave a slight nod, her eyes narrowing. "I already have a clear understanding of how Brad should be treated."


"Did he give you permission to handle it?"


"Yes," Ry/lie answered. "The research project belongs to Timothy, but I'm the one managing the experimental work. Brad agreed to fund the project and provide a lab. I'm in charge of the planning and the treatment."


Rory blinked in surprise before asking, "Then why the need for a seminar? Isn't it already settled?"


Rylie's tone remained even. "Brad and I have our arrangement, but it's a private one. The Morgan family wasn't part of that deal. Sean respects Brad,sure, but he's not going to risk everything on just one voice. They want to collect perspectives and weigh their options. That's fair."


Rory leaned back slightly and added, "Word is, the Wilde family's aiming to dominate this seminar."


Rylie gave a faint smile, though her gaze turned colder. "The Wilde family? Their time in medicine is nearly over."
###Chapter 55 Playing The Piano
Rory noticed the chil in her gaze and let out a quiet sigh. "The Wilde family might be headed for trouble.I've heard whispers about their hospital. They certainly don't live up to their claim of compassion."


Time quickly arrived for the Morgan family's seminar.


Rylie, living nearby, didn't rush. She rose early,spent some time at the Serenity Manor gym boxing and stretching through Pilates. After a refreshing shower,she walked to the library.


The manor's library held a vast collection gathered by the Owen family over time. Many of the books were rare, some even considered priceless.


As Rylie explored the aisles, she reached the section on music. The table nearby was cluttered with books pulled off the shelves. Loose pages lay scattered,and paper balls had piled up beside the stacks. Her brow furrowed. "These were curated by professionals.How did they end up like this?"

A passing servant paused and explained, "Miss Garrett was writing music here over the past few days. We didn't have the chance to clean it up."

Rylie picked up a crumpled sheet from the pile.It contained part of a composition. Paola had started it but never finished.


After reading through it, she frowned slightly, then tossed it into the waste bin. Her eyes then fell on the nearby piano, which had been moved out of the music room and now sat just beyond the shelves.


Paola must've been using this space for her composing recently.

Rylie continued through the east wing of the library.Three of the walls were lined with tall shelves filled with leather-bound volumes. The fourth opened into a full-length window that overlooked a peaceful garden. From there, cherry trees framed the scene,and a still lake reflected the moonlight at night.

Drawn in by the setting, Rylie took a modern sheet omusic and settled onto the piano bench. As she opened the lid, a servant approached quickly. "Miss Owen, Miss Garrett said this piano was recently tuned. It was a gift from Mr. Marcus Owen. If you're not familiar with it, we'd prefer if it wasn't played.She'll be upset if it's damaged."


"I know how to play," said Rylie.


Without another word, her hands drifted to the keys.She began to play, glancing through the notes as her fingers moved with ease.


The soft tones of "Clair de Lune" filled the library.The melody rose and fell like cherry petals floating gently to the ground.


The servant's eyes widened, caught off guard by how natural Rylie sounded.


She said nothing more and stepped aside, continuing to organize the mess on the table.


Midway through the piece, Rylie suddenly paused.


The notes on the page flickered in her mind, syncing with the slow fall of blossoms beyond the glass. A strange sensation rose from deep inside her.Something seemed to wait beneath the surface of the music.


She shut the book quietly. Her wrist hovered above the keys, still and silent for three slow seconds. A gentle breeze swept past the window, brushing cherry blossoms against the glass with a faint tap.


Something stirred inside her.


Rylie lowered her hands and struck a set of notes that didn't exist in any written score. The sound faltered at first, like it wasn't sure where to go. But the rhythm settled soon enough and carried itself forward.


Rylie shut her eyes. No longer bound by form or expectation, her hands moved freely across the keys.


A melody unfolded in that quiet room. It opened with the soft touch of spring. Then it rushed forward like a summer storm. By the end, it slowed again, fading like leaves falling gently in autumn.
Behind her, the servant stood motionless. Books still in hand, she listened in silence, eyes wide with wonder.


The petals outside seemed to fall in rhythm with the music, floating down as though they, too, had been caught in the moment.


When the final note slipped away, Ryie let her hands fall to her lap.


The servant spoke in a hushed voice, admiration thick. in each word. "Miss Owen - that was incredible. It felt like listening to Mr. Marcus Owen himself. It makes sense now. You really are siblings."


Rylie glanced toward the Debussy score beside her.Sunlight hit the words "Clair de Lune," making them glow.


A soft thump landed nearby. One petal had drifted through the open window and rested on the piano bench.


Rylie reached down to pick it up but noticed something beneath the piano. She crouched and  retrieved a tiny object. It was a silver hairpin, shaped like a music note. It belonged to Paola.


Thinking back, Rylie remembered hearing a phrase in her melody. Just two bars. Unfinished and rough. But she had shaped it into something fuller as she played.


Turning to the servant, Rylie asked for paper and a pen. She began jotting down the notes. It wasn't finished. Only the beginning had taken form. The rest still waited to be shaped.
###Chapter 56 Refusing To Believe
Rylie glanced at the clock and saw that it was nearly time to leave. She gave the sheet music and hairpin to the servant and said, "Please take this music back to my room. Give the hairpin to Paola. She probably left it behind."



The servant gave a nod. "Alright."


As Rylie stepped out of the music room, a man wearing a hat entered and slowly made his way through the library. His eyes scanned the empty space as he muttered, "That's odd. I thought I heard music in here. Where did Paola go?"


At that moment, Paola sat alone in the guest room,fidgeting with her hands. She kept glancing at the door, but no one came in. The security guard had already said that Spencer was on the property, but she hadn't seen him. Had he gotten lost?


Paola rose from her seat and headed out, intending to find him herself. On her way through the corridor,she spotted the servant carrying the sheet music.


"Have you seen Director Aguilar?" she asked quickly.


The servant shook her head. "No. I came from the library. Miss Owen asked me to hand this to you."


Paola took the hairpin without much thought and slipped it into her pocket. Then she continued down the hallway and finally saw Spencer standing near the library. She smiled as she called out, "Director Aguilar!"


Spencer turned to her with a grin. "Paola, I was just about to find you. Why did you leave without a word?"



Paola froze at the question. Leave? What was he talking about? She had waited for him in the guest room the entire time.


Before Paola could respond, Spencer started speaking again. "You've finally proven your musical ability. The arrangement today reminded me of Marcus' early work. Every concern I brought up in the email -gone. The opening now sounds exactly as l imagined."


Paola's expression faltered. She didn't know what Spencer was talking about. She hadn't even approached the piano today. She had spent the morning preparing for Spencer's arrival. The sheet music hadn't been touched since yesterday.Then who had played it?


Spencer's admiration deepened, and whatever Paola wanted to explain faded in her throat.


Spencer removed his hat and went on, "That melody - just preserve it. Add the rest when you can. I'll assign someone to write the lyrics and use it for the opening act."


He opened a notebook from his briefcase and added,"Do you have a full version of it? I'd like to note the main theme. It's absolutely beautiful."


Paola's eyes wandered past Spencer toward the library, her mind replaying what the servant had said earlier when delivering the hairpin. Someone else had been in there this morning-Rylie. Could it really have been her?


"The sheet music still needs work," said Paola, her voice low and dry. Her throat felt tight. "There are a few parts that still need fixing. It's not ready just yet."


Spencer gave her shoulder a light pat. "No need to rush. What I've seen so far is already quite good.Can you send me the full version by next week? Then we'll consider it settled."


"Alright." Paola gave a slow nod. Inside, her thoughts swirled in confusion.


Spencer then said, "We'll leave that for now. ls Marcus home? The academy in Crolens is marking its anniversary. Their principal asked me to pass along an invitation."


Paola answered quickly, "Marcus is at home. He should be in the study. I'll have someone lead you there."


When Spencer finally turned away, her legs nearly gave out. She leaned against the wall, trying to catch her breath. Her chest tightened. Her vision began to dim. Was it truly Rylie who had played that piece?The servant had said that the items were from the library. She was sure that the delivery was for Rylie's room. But how could Rylie even know how to play?And even if she did, how could Rylie match her level of skill? The composition alone should have been out of her reach.



"No... no way." Paola's whisper trembled out. She refused to believe that Rylie could impress Spencer or write music to match her own.①







Rylie arrived just in time, jogging up to the entrance of the Morgan Estate.


There were more attendees at this seminar than there were when she had rushed to save Brad.


People were still coming in. Rylie joined them,dressed plainly in a white tracksuit and wearing a sun hat. She looked nothing like the usual guests.


The guards at the gate hesitated. They didn't recognize her unti she took off her hat and said, "I live nearby. Thought I'd run here this morning."


Everyone on the estate knew that Brad had recently delivered a gift to the Owen family's daughter. They just hadn't connected that person to Rylie. Still, many remembered that she had once saved Brad's life.



Just as one of the guards moved to let her pass, a taunting voice cut through the air behind her."So you're still pretending to represent Aetheris Pharmacy? And now you've shown up here to milk the Morgans for favors?"



Marsha appeared beside Evita, helping her walk.Behind them were Timothy and Yosef.


Each one of them had clashed with Rylie before.


Rylie lifted an eyebrow and replied with a small grin,"Well,look who it is. The gang's all here."


"We aren't close," said Timothy coldly. "I don't recognize frauds as my students. Especially ones who hide behind the name of healing."


His voice rang with contempt. His glare was sharp
and full of malice. "Where's the Morgan security?Someone get over here and toss her out!" he shouted.
###Chapter 57 Seminar Incident
Evita gave a theatrical shake of her head, pretending to scold gently. "Alright, don't go too hard on the girl.She's still your student, after all."


Timothy's voice rose, brimming with rage. "You don't understand what she's done! She wrecked my entire research project. She wiped out all my data. Because of her, Mr. Morgan pulled his support. That study could've saved his life!"



A faint smile tugged at Rylie's lips, laced with frost."Your project? If I really destroyed it, why not just do it again? Weren't the reports yours? Weren't you the one in charge? Like you always said, I was only a student keeping records. If the data's gone, why is it that all those 'groundbreaking' results you boasted about vanished with it, Professor Powell?"



Timothy froze. The confidence was drained from his face. He couldn't say a word.
The truth behind his research was plain. His work on clinical medicine and artificial intelligence barely scratched the surface. Most of the effort came from his students. Deep down, even he never believed that it would amount to anything. He was only after the Morgan family's money. Evita had convinced him that Brad wouldn't live through the year.Once he died, there'd be no one left to demand results, and Timothy could walk away with the funding.



Rylie gave him a sideways glance, her voice low and calm. "What would Mr. Morgan think if he learned how little you actually knew about your own study?"


"You're lying!" Timothy snapped, his voice cracking."Nobody would take your word over mine!"


Evita suddenly raised her voice. "Enough. Keep your mouth shut."



Her face turned stern. That fool was on the verge of blurting out something that would expose everything.


Timothy bit back his anger and stayed quiet under her cold stare.
Turning to Rylie, Evita spoke indifferently, her expression sharpening with pride. "You're from HaloFlow Pharmacy. You trained under Selah Hobbes. I won't hold that against you, not yet. But let's be honest. The reason you got your hands on Nexo-7 wasn't due to your skill. Selah stole the formula from the Wilde family. If not for that theft,we would've had the medication ready long before Brad's condition turned critical."


At the mention of Selah's name, murmurs rippled through the room.


"Isn't that the doctor who caused a patient's death during a botched procedure?"


"Why didn't the Morgans vet their guests more carefully? They let someone like Rylie take part in this seminar?"


"How dare Selah send a student out to do her bidding? Does she truly believe everyone has forgotten what she did?"


"It makes sense now. No wonder the girl could hand over a pure dose of Nexo-7. If Selah's behind her,then of course. Selah and Evita used to dominate the medical field together, but later, Selah stole formulas just to keep her edge. And the poor Wilde family's reputation suffered. It's no wonder the Wildes hate Selah so much."



The crowd grew restless. Their stares turned cold.Rylie felt the shift instantly. That was exactly the response Evita had been hoping for. But Selah was nowhere in sight. Evita really wwished that Selah could be present and face the humiliation together with Rylie:


Evita put on a gentle tone, though the edge in her words was clear. "Your mentor may know medicine,but her ethics are questionable. Her reputation isn't exactly spotless. I doubt the Morgan famnily would risk Mr. Brad Morgan's care on someone like you. lf something goes wrong, could you handle the blame?There's still time to make things right. Go back to school. Stay on track before it's too late."


Others standing nearby took her lead and began to chime in.
"Why would someone like her be allowed to treat Mr.

Morgan here at the estate?"


"Her invitation must be fake."


"Security, escort her out at once."


The moment the word "fake" was mentioned, the guards exchanged a look, then turned to Rylie and asked politely, "Miss, may we see your invitation?"


Evita had counted on this. She assumed that Rylie wouldn't bring one. The last time Rylie had visited, it was only because she'd delivered Nexo-7. So Evita took a gamble, hoping to publicly shame her and warn Selah not to get involved again.


But Rylie didn't come unprepared. She calmly reached into her pocket and pulled out an invitation.


It looked nothing like the others. The card had a deep red background edged in gold, and the handwriting was unmistakably unique.


The guards leaned in for a closer inspection. The change in their expressions was immediate.Onlookers began whispering to each other. "Is there something wrong with her invitation?"


Timothy took the opening and raised his voice. "Of course she doesn't belong here! Her mentor already ruined lives, and now she's teaching her student to lie and cheat! This is disgraceful!"


Evita pretended not to take sides, though her smile gave her away. "You're still young, Rylie. If you're really so eager to pose as a doctor, you could ask one of us seasoned experts for help. These little tricks of yours won't get you far."


"How shameful."



"Is this the kind of training Selah gives her apprentice? I'd be too embarrassed to show my face."


Rylie didn't react. She didn't glance their way. She simply waited, calm and composed, as the guards decided what to do next.


Without warning, both guards stepped forward,bowing low. Their voices rang out, clear and firm."Welcome.Please come in!"


The chatter stopped at once.


Their sudden show of respect landed like a quiet blow across Evita's face. She stood still, caught off guard. None of this made sense.


One guard, still bent slightly, addressed Rylie with care, "The seminar will be held in the front hall. If there's anything you need, I'll be right there to assist.Please follow me."



Beside him, the second guard gripped the invitation tightly. Sweat gathered in his palm. The writing on the card was clear and strong. Most invitations looked alike, ordinary and printed. But this one -marked with gold and stamped with weight-meant something only a few within the Morgan family would understand.


Out of all the invitations sent by the Morgans, just one carried Sean's own handwriting. It was meant for Healing Hand, a figure known only in whispered circles of the medical world.The guards didn't know for certain if Rylie was that person. Still, the risk of turning her away was too high.


Rylie expected this shift. She remembered the message that she had received through the dark web. Sean had sent her the card himself,handwriting every word. She never meant to use it. But now that the Wilde family was involved, she figured that there was no reason to hold back.
###Chapter 58 Deal With The Consequences Yourself
Word of the commotion at the gate had already made its way indoors.


Brock stepped out, calm and firm, his presence drawing the crowd's attention. They greeted him with practiced smiles.


None of them had met Brad, but they all knew Brock well. He rarely left Brad's side.


Still, Brock paid them no mind. His expression stayed cold-until he caught sight of Rylie.


"Good morning, Miss Owen. Have you had anything to eat?" he asked.



Rylie handed him her sun hat without ceremony and said, "I did. I just came from my morning run."


Brock accepted the hat and smiled. "I was out running myself. Come, I'll walk you to the seminar hall."



Rylie gave a nod. "Alright. Let's go."


The crowd stared, unsure of what they were seeing.


The Morgan family had a reputation built on military discipline and cool reserve. Their bodyguards came from top units. Brock, especially, was known for keeping close to Brad and speaking to few. So watching him treat a young woman like a close friend caught everyone off guard.


Evita and her family had tried to make Rylie feel unwelcome. Yet Brock's gesture flipped the situation.Now it looked as if Rylie were a special guest at the Morgan estate.


Evita gritted her teeth. "What is going on? Why would the Morgans be kind to someone like her? Her reputation is awful. Have they lost their minds?"


Marsha leaned closer and whispered, "Grandma,we're still on Morgan land."


Evita bit back her reaction. Timothy couldn't hold his  in. He pointed at Rylie, raising his voice. "Are the security guards all asleep? She's a fraud! Her mentor caused a death, remember!"


One of the guards stepped forward. "Sir. Put your hand down."



Timothy, already bitter from losing his research funding, could hardly contain his rage. He didn't care who was listening. "You let people like this in, and now you can't even-"


The guard didn't let him finish. In one swift move,he grabbed Timothy's wrist, twisted it, and shoved him back. His voice rang out, low and stern. "This is Morgan ground. We do not allow disruption. The Morgans decide what is just."


That plain-looking guard suddenly stood like a soldier, his presence silencing the crowd.


Seeing that he was about to be escorted out,Timothy stumbled and reached for Evita's sleeve."Aunt Evita! Please!"



Evita jerked her arm away. "How many times have l warned you not to act like this? You never listen.I can't help you anymore. From now on, deal with the consequences yourself."


Timothy's face twisted in panic. "No! I know | was wrong! Please, Aunt Evita, don't abandon me! I was only trying to help you!"


Deep down, he knew the truth. If the Wilde family turned its back on him, everything would be lost.


But it was too late now. His expulsion sent a clear message to everyone else, and they slipped into the Morgan estate in uneasy silence.


Evita stood still, her chest tight with worry. Timothy was his nephew after all. Watching the Morgans treat himn like that felt like a direct insult. But she couldn't afford to speak up. With Aetheris Pharmacy's online ban hanging over them, their influence had already grown thin. She had no choice. Today, she needed to take the lead as Brad's attending physician if she hoped to keep her family in the picture.


As she approached the estate entrance with Marsha and Yosef, a guard stepped in their way."I'm sorry,"
he said. "The invitation allows only one assistant per attending physician."


Evita's lips twitched. NJot again. This day was already bad enough.


Marsha turned toward her, the edge of hesitation in her voice. "Grandma?"


Evita tightened her grip around Marsha's fingers."Yosef, wait outside. Marsha's coming with me."


Yosef said nothing. He wasn't pleased, but he knew better than to argue at this moment.


Marsha quietly exhaled. Relief washed over her. She knew that her grandmother had no plans of letting her stay behind. They were there for more than Brad's treatment. Making an impression on him was just as important.


Inside the estate's elegant reception room, the air was calm but thick with whispers. The walls held old scrolls and calligraphy, the kind passed through generations. Even the teacups had the look of heirlooms.
Each time a well-known doctor stepped in, a butler announced their name for all to hear.


Rylie walked in right on time. When the words "HaloFlow Pharmacy" rang out, heads turned.


The glances weren't open stares, but the message behind them came through clearly.


No one welcomed her. The other doctors stayed just far enough to make their disapproval known.


Still, she wasn't alone. Rory noticed the stares and understood her choice to stay quiet. He said nothing.He simply took the seat next to her and sat close, a silent sign of support.


Not long after, a man's voice came from the side,calm but laced with surprise. "Rylie."
###Chapter 59 This Event Belonged To Them
The familiar voice caught Rylie's attention, and her eyes found Leland in the crowd. Surprise flickered across his face-clearly, he hadn't expected to see her today.


Only a few days had passed since their last encounter, yet Leland appeared almost gaunt, deep shadows circling his eyes - a testament to exhaustion and sleepless nights.


Most likely, the constant turmoil at home was taking its toll, leaving every responsibility directly on his shoulders.


Rylie quickly looked away, her features cool and unreadable, making no effort to acknowledge him.


Regret pressed heavily on Leland; beneath the surface, anguish simmered. The Kirk family's business had stumbled again, all thanks to entanglements with the Durys. Every new venture crumbled, misfortune dogging his every step.


A desperate need for comfort gnawed at him, but with chaos already consuming the household,he kept his worries hidden, unwilling to burden anyone else.


The seminar invitation had come after much effort-one small hope to seek help for Brad and perhaps lift the Kirks' fortunes, though he doubted that it would be enough.


Standing among a roomful of celebrated physicians,Leland felt the weight of every glance. The Kirk family's troubles were common knowledge, and few cared to interact with him.



After wrestling with his thoughts, he finally crossed the room to where Rylie sat and took the seat beside her. "Could we talk for a moment?"


Rylie's gaze slid over, detached and even. "We've already gone our separate ways. Remember? I am no longer a Kirk. What's left to discuss?"
A lump rose in Leland's throat. "Nicolas... He's scheduled for amputation next week."


Her face betrayed nothing, the news met with cold silence.



Holding back his sorrow, Leland continued, "Since you walked away, everything at home has unraveled.Please,Rylie-come back. Help Nicolas. Help Mom."


Rylie rested her chin on her palm, pausing thoughtfully before answering, "Alright. I'll come back'-if you send Stacey packing."


His reply was immediate, almost defensive. "Rylie,you're an Owen now and have all the wealth. If I kick Stacey out, she'll have nowhere to go."


"Pfft." A sudden, cold laugh escaped Rylie. "So when you demanded I walk out on the Kirks, did it cross your mind that I might end up homeless, too?"


Leland's mouth opened, but words failed him. "l..."


With a look of pure disdain, Rylie turned away. "Don't waste my time.Go."
For a moment, Leland hesitated, then added, his voice low, "I've heard about you and your mentor,how you supposedly stole the Wildes' medical formula. If Brad or Sean hears about this, even being the richest man's granddaughter won't shield you in Crolens, the territory of Morgan family."


"Huh." Rylie's lips curled into a sneer. "After all the times the Wildes have played you for a fool, you still buy their lies?"


That jab left Leland momentarily speechless.


Still, the Wildes' reputation in medicine was ironclad,and as a staff member at VitaLink Hospital, Leland couldn't help but lean on their authority.


"I know you're talented, Rylie. You wouldn't have won Aetheris Pharmacy's trust if you weren't. You brought back rare meds for Nicolas and Mom." He tried again,softer now. "But you're not in Ms. Wilde's league.She's seen more patients than you could imagine."


His words were meant to be advice, but to Rylie, it was just pointless lecturing.
She flicked her gaze toward the door, dismissing him with a wave. "Looks like the show's about to start. If you stay here nagging, you'll lose your shot to get the Wildes' attention."


A glance was all it took-Leland noticed the shift outside, shot to his feet, and hurried off, leaving Rylie in the corner.


In this world of white coats and quiet power,reputation was everything. The room buzzed with conversation, doctors from top schools and families mingling easily - yet every single one of them deliberately left the young woman by the window out of their circle.


A pharmacy whose name no one recognized was bound to be dismissed, written off as unworthy of respect.


The contrast was stark. Evita swept into the hall and instantly became the center of attention, half the crowd quick to cluster around her. "Ms. Wilde, what a pleasure to see you!"


A composed "Yes," was her response, as Evita moved gracefully through the throng. Marsha kept pace beside her, greeting acquaintances with the easy polish of someone used to admiration.


For the Wildes, this event belonged to them; what happened outside was insignificant!


Standing tall, Evita and Marsha advanced, not bothering to acknowledge Rylie as they strode past.


The reason for Rylie's isolation was no secret; it wasn't just her obscure pharmacy background.The Wildes' public accusation- that she'd stolen their high-purity medication to treat Brad, slipping in under false pretenses - had poisoned her reputation.


Most present viewed her with thinly veiled contempt.


The air was rich with the scent of fresh coffee.


Unfazed by the coldness that surrounded her, Rylie drummed her fingers on the chair's arm, sitting alone in the corner.


Her eyes dropped to her cup, a faint, enigmatic smile touching her lips. As far as she was concerned, the real fireworks had yet to begin.


A sudden, commanding voice cut through the hum of conversation. "Attention, please." The words echoed from above, silencing the room for a moment.


Heads turned as Brad, immaculate in a dark tailored suit, began his slow descent from the second floor.
###Chapter 60 Go Solo Or Team Up
Brad, as a soldier, stood tall in his tailored suit. Broad shoulders and a narrow waist gave him the sharp look of a blade waiting to strike. There was strength in every line of fabric, quiet but ready to erupt.


One hand rested in his pocket. The other, shaped by familiar tension, curled lightly against the gold-colored railing. His fingers showed signs of old habits -faint calluses from handling a gun. Still, they didn't take away from his quiet grace.


Light slid across the hard edges of his face. From beneath steady brows, his eyes swept over the room with the practiced calm of a man used to holding authority.


Tucked at Brad's collar, a small golden insignia offered the only hint of his life before the boardroom.


As he moved down the stairs, his shoes gleamed with each step. The rhythm of his descent was sharp and deliberate, carried not by fashion, but by habit born fromn years of training.


At the last step, he stopped and tugged gently at his tie. That small, thoughtless motion brought attention to the clean lines of his neck. A few in the room forgot to breathe.


"Thank you for waiting." Brad's voice landed deep.Each word was rough around the edges, but steady.


Even in a suit, he gave the sense of a predator in disguise. Like a wolf dressed in silk, holding back teeth sharp enough to tear through flesh.



Marsha's hand slipped. Her coffee cup tipped and splashed the liquid over the white tablecloth. She hadn't realized that she was holding her breath.


The doctors stood at once.


"Mr. Morgan!" Evita stepped ahead, hope flashing in her eyes. "I've reviewed your case closely and outlined an initial plan for treatment-"



Brad lifted a hand to stop her mid-sentence.
"I'm not here to hear words. I want to see skill."


His eyes drifted over the crowd, pausing just slightly on Rylie. "I've brought three patients with conditions like mine. Their records are available to all of you.Your task is to name the illness and explain how you'd treat it. I'll be the one deciding who gets it right."


Evita met his challenge head-on. "Mr. Morgan, your illness is among the rarest we've ever seen. If someone here can treat those patients as well as l can,what happens then?"


Brad held her gaze and answered without flinching,"Then I'd ask you to craft a plan that stands above the rest, Ms. Wilde. Because for me, there's only one doctor who can take the lead."



Even among the brightest minds in medicine, he only needed one. The silence between them hinted at a rivalry that needed no words.


Evita held onto her confidence as she asked,"Then how do we begin consulting with the patients?"
"You can go solo or team up. I'm not picking for you,"said Brad.


That left the door wide open for anyone aiming to form smart alliances.


Evita was sure that she and her granddaughter could hold their own. So when Leland stepped in, thinking that his past connection with Marsha might give him a way in, she turned him down without blinking.


She gave his outstretched hand a quick glance, a smirk tugging at her mouth.


With a slow motion, she adjusted her sleeve. Her eyes never even met his.


"Dr. Kirk," she said, loud enough for the nearby tables to catch, "we've handled our medical work just fine without help from the outside."


Leland froze halfway through the gesture, his hand hanging there awkwardly. His face tightened with unease. He had expected at least a small nod of respect. With his degrees and his name, he thought that Marshall and her grandmother would show basic manners. But they just shut him out without a second thought.


There was a time, back when the Kirks still had pull,when Marsha might've kept up appearances. She would've smiled, maybe even humored him. But that era was gone. Their name didn't hold weight anymore.


Marsha stood beside her grandmother and let out a small laugh. "Dr. Kirk, maybe you should head over to Rylie." She paused for effect.


Then her eyes cut across the room and landed on Rylie. "A thief working together with a fool-what a good team!"
###Chapter 61 The Illness Of The Third Patient
The remark drew a few quiet chuckles from the gathered doctors.


Evita raised her chin and walked with the pride of someone who owned the room. "Some folks have never stepped inside a proper medical school,yet they still parade themselves where real expertise belongs."


She made sure that her voice carried as she added."Marshy, always remember - our family's medical skill isn't something just any amateur can match."


"You're exactly right, Grandma," said Marsha,her tone obedient though mischief sparkled in her eyes."Some people can't even handle the basics of a diagnosis."


The two spoke in perfect rhythm. Every word that they threw stung like barbs.
Leland shrank back and drew his hand away.He looked ready to defend himself when a crisp snap echoed across the room. He turned toward the sound. Rylie had just shut a medical case. She stood up slowly.


Evita had thrown her jabs at Leland, but her real target was Rylie.


The crowd fell still as Rylie walked toward her,each step pressing down on the old woman's nerves.


"Ms. Wilde," said Rylie, her smile faint and her eyes cold. "Since you're so sure of yourself..."


She reached into her coat pocket and drew out a pair of medical gloves. She slid them on, taking her time."Why don't we place a little bet?"


Evita narrowed her eyes. "What kind of bet?"


"Let's see who can reach the correct diagnosis first,"said Rylie, tapping her fingers lightly on the edge of the table.



Evita let out a laugh. "Really? Do you even know who you're talking to, girl?"


"Of course," said Rylie. She tilted her head slightly,a smile softening her words, but there was nothing gentle behind it. "I'm talking to a liar who's about to get completely exposed and humiliated."


Gasps and murmurs rippled through the crowd.


Rylie turned to Leland. "Want to team up with me?"


Leland met her eyes. They were steady and calm,like stars blinking gently above the ocean.


His throat moved as he swallowed, and then he gave a nod."Okay."


Evita clenched her fists, ready to explode, when a sharp voice sliced through the air. "Begin the diagnosis." It was Brad.


No one had seen him walk in, but there he stood on the second-floor landing, his arms crossed as he looked down with mild amusement.



"Remember," he said, pausing for a beat as his eyes flicked toward Rylie. "I expect the best result."
Evita threw Rylie one last glare before turning on her heel and walking away. Marsha hurried after her but still managed to toss one last insult. "Just you wait,you shameless liar!"


Rylie dusted off her sleeves without looking back.


The air in the hall tightened. Everyone sensed that this showdown had barely begun.


Evita stepped forward, eager to show off the Wilde name. Though Aetheris Pharmacy and Healing Hand had boxed her in, she had clawed her way into Crolens. Now she wanted to silence that arrogant Rylie once and for all.


People slowly emerged from the examination rooms arranged by the Morgans. Some shook their heads in defeat. Others worethe kind of grim faces that came from doubt.



Only Evita came out smiling, walking with light steps and feigned warmth.


"We're clear on the symptoms for the first two patients. But this last one-I can't pin it down."
" don't get it either. It looks like heatstroke. But Mr.Morgan said the three patients had the same signs as his. Surely, it shouldn't be as simple as heatstroke."



"And he noted coughing and numb limbs. That hints at a neurological problem, and the medical report shows a shadow. But I still can't figure out what it means."



Someone let out a quiet sigh.


Rylie stepped forward. Marsha halted beside Leland and scoffed, "Working with a fraud will only make your defeat worse."



Leland clenched his jaw. Since boyhood, he'd been hailed as a genius. Still, being mocked in public by a woman chipped away at his composure. He had held back long enough.


"If Rylie's a fraud, what does that make you?"


Marsha blinked, taken off guard. "You're comparing me to her?"
Leland's tone sharpened. The mask of calm broke."You're not even close to her level. My brother needed an amputation because of your prescriptions. What kind of healer in Crolens lets that happen?"


Marsha flinched. Her face twisted so badly that even her makeup couldn't hide it.


"You!" She jabbed a red-polished finger at his face."Who gave you the right to question my skills?"
###Chapter 62 Battle In The Consultation
Leland swatted Marsha's hand aside. His eyes, wild and sharp, burned with rage that had been bottled up too long. "You want proof? Look at my brother's leg. That so-called miracle drug you gave him turned a small ache into full-blown necrosis."


A wave of uneasy chatter filled the room. Some of the senior doctors leaned toward one another,exchanging looks that said more than words could.Evita's expression hardened. She moved fast, pulling her granddaughter close. "Marsha, leave him be.There are better things for you to spend your time on."



Marsha clenched her jaw but stayed still. Her forehead pulsed with fury, and her fists curled at her sides as she fought the urge to lash out.


Rylie stood nearby, arms folded, quietly observing  the chaos like someone watching rodents in a cage.A faint smirk tugged at her lips. Marsha caught it.


Marsha turned to her. "Wipe that smile off your face.You'll get yours soon enough."


As Marsha turned to leave, Leland instantly regretted his impulsive outburst.


The Kirks weren't doing well, and now he had offended the Wilde family. Once the seminar was over, he was afraid that the VitaLink Hospital would likely fire him.


Leland trailed behind Rylie toward the consultation room, doubting everything about her credentials. He muttered, "With Ms. Wilde in the room, the winner's already been picked. We just have to pretend we've still got a shot."


Rylie didn't respond, Instead, she leaned over the first patient and began her assessment. Her voice was steady when she finally spoke. "The problem with the Kirk family is that you only trust people who shine. You never look at what's hiding in the shadows."
Leland narrowed his eyes. "You really think you can do this?"


Rylie didn't answer. She focused on the report,flipping through pages until she found what she needed.



She scribbled notes and pieced together a treatment plan. It included three different approaches, each with unique meds and costs, all tailoredto fit the patient's budget.


He wrote his own version but frowned deeper with each side-by-side review. Every part of hers made his look half-baked.


Then he spotted something. His finger tapped the third section. "Are you serious? You're mixing ketamine with pregabalin? That doesn't even follow the treatment protocol for neuroimmune disorders."


Still writing, she replied without lifting her head,"Protocols stay the same. Patients don't."


He raised his voice. "That mix is neurotoxic. And you've thrown in an experimental NMDA receptor
blocker too-"


"It's the only thing that's stopping his neurons from dying off," she interjected. Rylie finally lifted her head, her clear eyes meeting Leland's gaze. "Did you even read the spinal fluid report? His glutamate levels are quadruple the normal count. That kind of spike points straight to neurotoxic overload."


Leland froze. He snatched up the report and flipped through it with trembling fingers. Buried in all the technical language, the glutamate levels were clearly flagged as dangerously high.


He stammered, "'But... this treatment just feels too extreme."



"I'd rather gamble with recovery than watch him waste away in a coma," she said. Rylie clicked her pen shut. "Typical immunosuppressants won't work this time. There's over seventy percent damage to his blood-brain barrier. What matters now is bringing back protection for his neurons, not dragging out more immune suppression."
Leland mouth opened, but no sound followed.There was nothing that he could say to counter her logic.That was when it hit him. He'd been clinging to textbook answers for too long, forgetting that every patient carried their own puzzle.


He pointed at one of the drugs in her second plan."Why would you even use doxycycline? That's not for neurological stuff."


Rylie's lips curved, just slightly. "You really should keep up with Frontiers in Neuroimmunology. The latest volume has a wvhole piece on this." She pulled up the study on her tablet. "Silvercrest University found that this class of antibiotics helps regulate neuroinflammation. Especially when it stems from something like a mycoplasma infection. Just like in his case."


Leland took the tablet from her and read the summary. His brows drew together as he tried to absorb the findings. Those studies had always felt outside his lane. He'd skipped over them.


"I'll need time to look through these properly," he said, struggling to admit it.


"We're out of time." Rylie closed the tablet. "Let's move to the next one."



Their second patient wasn't any easier to figure out.


Leland stared at the brain scans. Diffuse lesions stretched across the cortex. Sweat gathered on his brow as he leaned in closer. "This almost resembles prion disease, but something doesn't line up."


Rylie was already pulling on gloves. She stepped over to the patient and began checking his skin. "It's not prion-related." She pointed to a patch on the arm."These tiny rashes? Capillary dilation." Then she gently opened one eyelid. "See this? The blood vessels in the conjunctiva are abnormal."



He leaned over to inspect them himself. She was right. The signs were clear now that he looked closer."What does that mean, exactly?"he asked.


"Brain ischemia from vasculitis," Rylie answered,jotting notes on the plan. "We'll still need imaging to confirm it, but this points to a rare form of ANCA- related vasculitis."


"Hold on!" Leland cut in. "If this really is vasculitis,then why didn't the others catch it? The standard ANCA results were negative!"


Rylie exhaled sharply. "Because all they did was run the usual panel. This strain doesn't show up there.You need a specialized ELISA test to trace antibodies that target membrane protrusion proteins." Rylie turned the results toward him as she added, "Look at this. His complement levels are way below normal.That's a major indicator."



The room tilted slightly as Leland processed it. His vision wavered. Those same numbers had been in front of him. He just hadn't connected the pieces.Rylie had a way of cutting through noise. It was as if she could see the disease bare and unfiltered.


He cleared his throat. "Your protocol- it includes rituximab and pulse doses of cyclophosphamide?"


"Exactly." Rylie nodded once. "We need high-intensity immunosuppression. Add plasma exchange,and it's our best shot at halting the damage before it  spreads."

He blinked hard. "But the death rate - it's nearly thirty percent."

"If we don't treat it, the mortality jumps to one hundred." Her tone stayed even. "But I've adjusted the frequency and dosage. The risk drops to under fifteen now."


It clicked for Leland right then. Her approach wasn't guesswork. She had built it on firm science and lived experience. What seemed like reckless choices at first were backed by clear knowledge of how each drug behaved and what the illness demanded.

So by the time they moved on to the next patient, he found himself hesitating before pushing back. This man's symptoms were even stranger. A burning fever that wouldn't quit. Weakness in the limbs. But there were no signs of infection or swelling anywhere.

Rylie glanced at the older man's face, mostly hidden under the blanket, and let out a soft chuckle. "Out of all three, he's the easiest one to figure out."
Leland stared at her, stunned. He'd combed through this chart more than once. Still, nothing had made sense. "Really? But I don't see it. I really don't.
###Chapter 63 Who Is The First

Rylie gave the patient a quick once-over. After scribbling just a few words into his chart, she shut it with a calm finality. "Alright. We're done here. Let's wait for the official results."



Leland blinked in surprise. "That's it? You're finished already? So, what's wrong with him?"


Rylie gave him a small smile. "Nothing."


That answer only deepened Leland's confusion.


Outside the room, the other participants were still busy whispering about the patient's symptoms.Rylie had been the last to enter, yet she was the first to walk out-barely fifteen minutes later.


As soon as they saw her, the others dropped their serious expressions and began smirking.


"Wow, that was quick. Bet she didn't understand a thing."
"Just look at Leland. Poor guy's face says it all. They totally missed it."


Evita took it all in and felt her confidence rise.Without Selah guiding her, what threat could that girl possibly pose?


At the same time, Brad sat calmly at the head of the table. The butler brought over the final results, which Brock then handed off to a few seasoned physicians from the military hospital. Their review didn't take long.


Brad gave the results a brief glance and barely reacted. "Go ahead. Announce it," he told Brock.


Brock gave a small nod and left the room for the second-floor landing.


"Everyone," he began, his voice firm and steady."You've all completed your assessments. The results are with me now. Ms. Wilde. Miss Wilde."



Evita stood without hesitation, her lips fighting back a smile.
flaws, which places them in second."


Second? Evita's smile stiffened in an instant.


She wasn't the only one caught off guard. The room stirred with disbelief.


If the Wildes didn't take first place, then who did?


"Could be Rory," someone whispered. "He's from the military hospital. He might know the evaluators the Morgans brought in. That could've helped him score higher."


"Still... this is Mr. Morgan's health we're talking about. I doubt they'd risk any kind of favoritism."


Murmurs filled the space, but Brock didn't offer any answers just yet. Instead, he turned to the crowd."Miss Owen, would you mind stepping forward and shedding some light for us?"


Rylie popped the last bit of her candy in her mouth,wiped her hands, and stood up without hurry.Everyone watched as she made her way to the front."Sure," she said, her voice calm. "What exactly would you like me to explain?"


Brock unfolded the chart she'd written in and glanced at the contents with a faint smile. "It's the third patient's condition we'd like to understand. And your treatment plan, specifically."


People leaned forward, eyes narrowing as they scanned the paper.


There was only one line. "Get plenty of rest and stay hydrated."


"Rest?" someone echoed. "That's it? That's the treatment?"





"Seriously? The Morgans signed off on this? How could they take that seriously?"
###Chapter 64 Faked
"This is absurd. How could the Morgans accept such a diagnosis?"


"Selah's student? She's a fraud. How did someone like her even get into a seminar this important?"


The room grew louder. One voice fed another until the whole crowd was buzzing, tossing out accusations and doubts. Rylie stood calmly as whispers labeled her a fake. Leland stayed beside her, his face burning. He wanted to vanish.


He thought about speaking up. But with so many doctors around-people he might work with one day -he held his tongue.



Rory shook his head at Leland's reaction. In a clear voice that cut through the crowd, he declared, "I have faith in Rylie's skills. Even I can't figure out what the third patient's ailment is either, so it makes sense if he isn't sick at all."
Brock scanned the restless crowd. The tension had built too high. He clapped his hands to get their attention. "Let's settle this. I'll announce the final result now. The person chosen to serve as chief physician for Mr. Brad Morgan," he said, "is Rylie from HaloFlow Pharmacy, and Leland will be joining her."



The room fell into stunned silence. Then it shattered with disbelief. "What!? Did he just say HaloFlow Pharmacy?!"


Marsha stood frozen, stunned speechless. Evita blinked hard and rushed forward, yanking the slip of paper out of Brock's hand.


In thick, black print, it read: HaloFlow Pharmacy.


Leland's shame gave way to surprise, then pride, as the words sank in. He realized that Rylie hadn't just held her own. She'd beaten every doctor in the room.


Voices swelled again, this time buzzing with a different kind of energy.


The same people who'd mocked Rylie were now watching her like she lit up the place. The Wilde family,meanwhile, looked like they'd swallowed bitter pills.


Evita stood stiff with disbelief. Someone her age,with decades of respect behind her, had just been shown up by a girl that no one had even heard of until now.


With the slip still clutched in her hand, she took a breath to steady herself and asked, "As a physician,l know I shouldn't question the employer's decision.But I need to ask. How does someone so young,someone who hasn't even graduated, end up in charge of Mr. Brad Morgan's care? How can this choice be considered anything but reckless?"



The Wilde family led the outcry, questioning Rylie at every turn. More doctors followed, many of them proud of their credentials, now lining up to cast doubt on her.



"Rylie? She's just some outcast from the Kirk family.I heard she was trouble. If it were Leland standing here, maybe I'd believe it."
"With her past, there's no way she's that skilled. The Morgans should really rethink this whole thing."


Brock eyed the group of skeptics gathering fast. "So none of you are buying it?"


Evita turned sharply toward Rylie and Leland, eyes fixed on the latter. "Leland, you've been with VitaLink for years. School aside, most of your training came from this hospital. Didn't you help train her? Let's hear your thoughts about the third patient."


Leland tried to speak, but his voice came out rough."All three diagnoses were made by Rylie. She's more capable than l am."


Evita hadn't expected that. Her mouth tightened,clearly displeased that Leland didn't back her up. "I trust the Morgan family, but I can't let an opportunist walk away with this. If I'm going to lose, I need to see proof. Let her explain her diagnosis. I want to know who truly deserves the role."


Rory gave a dry laugh. "Come on, Evita. Don't be petty. You're too old for that."
Evita snapped back, "This isn't pettiness. I just want this junior to convince me."


Rylie spoke up at last, calm and unhurried. "The report was fake. The patient isn't sick. The heat from his body came from a hot water bottle. The shivering? Faked."


"That's ridiculous," Evita said quickly. But laughter broke out before she could say more.


At that moment, the doors across the room opened.


A man stepped out, walking with quiet strength. He held a hot water bottle in one hand, and though he wore a patient's gown, he carried himself like someone used to being in charge.


He smiled and said, "Sharp eyes, young lady. You're right. I'm not ill."


The room went dead silent.


Evita's hand shook as she pointed. "Mr. Morgan?"


He chuckled and handed the bottle to his butler. "It's me. I was the third patient, just in disguise."
Then he turned to Rylie with an approving look."Out of everyone here, only she figured it out."
###Chapter 65 The Wilde Family's Downfall
To keep his identity hidden, Sean had wrapped his face tightly, making it nearly impossible for everyone to recognize him during the examination.



"I overheard every word from the consultation room,"said Sean. He stood tall, voice steady and eyes sharp. "HaloFlow Pharmacy has earned first place,no question."



The room fell quiet. One doctor, who had been the loudest critic, suddenly had nothing to say. Evita's face turned pale, then red. Her head stayed low.Sean's reveal left no doubt - her skills had been outmatched too quickly by someone that she had dismissed. Nobody had imagined that the third patient would be Sean himself, playing sick. Evita couldn't afford to let someone whom she looked down on destroy everything that she had worked for.

Her eyes darted around. Now that the Wilde family was blacklisted by Healing Hand and had a bad reputation on the dark web, they were struggling. If they couldn't secure Brad's chief physician rights today,it was all over.


She gave Marsha a subtle signal. Marsha raised her voice at once. "HaloFlow stole our family's formula.They used it to save Mr. Brad Morgan at a crucial time! That wasn't help - that was theft. The Wilde family has never lost a patient. We've always practiced medicine with integrity. How can you trust someone who snuck their way to the top?"


Rylie stepped up, her tone sharp and cool. "Funny. Is there any proof that Selah was involved in a setup back when that patient died? Who's really the fraud here?"



Evita scoffed, shaking her head,"We have the proof.Selah's selfish mistake cost a life. The case was reviewed thoroughly. You've been misled. Still, if you hand over the formula, I won't press charges."


"Charges?" Rylie looked at the clock, then passed her phone to Evita, smirking. "Go on. Call them. I'd be honored."



"You!" Evita sputtered. "You think I won't? If you weren't Brad's physician, I'd have had you locked up already."


"No call yet?" Without hesitation, Rylie snatched her phone back, dialed the number herself, and lifted it to her ear. "Let me help. I'll call the police to come get me."


Everyone watched in stunned silence. Who would call the police on themselves? What exactly was Rylie planning?


Even Evita couldn't make sense of what Rylie was doing.Meanwhile, Marsha kept pressing forward."Go ahead and call them," she snapped. "That formula you stole is worth hundreds of millions. You'll be rotting in prison before long."


"Rylie's out of her mind!"


"Does she think being Brad's chief physician means she can do whatever she wants?"
"They really need to rethink trusting someone like her!"



The murmurs picked up again. This time, most voices leaned toward the Wildes. And just as the room swelled with noise, the clock struck two. Sirens echoed in the distance.



Rylie lowered her eyes and smiled. "Right on time."


Outside, police cars pulled directly onto the estate lawn. Everyone inside the hall turned toward the windows, watching as officers in black tactical gear stepped out.


"Did she seriously call them?" someone whispered.

"But that was so fast! She just made the call!"



Gasps turned into whispers, then full-blown chatter.If Rylie was dragged out now, the seat as Brad's physician would be back up for grabs.


Even Marsha looked thrilled. She leaned toward Rylie and mouthed, "You just ruined yourself."


The front doors swung open. A tall officer marched in, gaze firm, shoulders squared. The room tensed.


No one spoke. They waited for him to name Rylie.


"Ms. Evita Wilde. Miss Marsha Wilde," the officer said clearly,voice firm and steady. "We're with the Economic Crime Investigation Division, Special Action Unit. You're both under arrest for medical fraud and illegal practice."


Evita froze. Her voice barely made it out. "There's a mistake.You must be confused."



The officer pulled out a warrant. His tone didn't shift."Over the past five years, VitaLink Hospital has racked up three hundred cases of medical fraud,totaling over two hundred million in damages.We have evidence showing those crimes were carried out under your direction. The Wilde family has sold organs, taken bribes, performed surgeries without cause, committed academic fraud, and framed fellow doctors."



Marsha grabbed Evita's arm in panic. "Grandma, this can't be happening. We've already-"
"Quiet!" snapped Evita. "This is nonsense. Our hospital's always been honest. We've never cheated a patient-not even for a cent."



One of the officers stepped forward with cuffs in hand. "You'll need to come with us."


"No! I want a lawyer! I'm not going!" Marsha's voice cracked. But she didn't get far. A tall officer forced her to the floor, cuffed her without hesitation, and led her out in disgrace.


Whatever plan she had to win over Brad with her credentials had completely collapsed.


The room was frozen. Not a single person moved.


The police, expected to arrest Rylie, had instead removed two Wildes. Even Leland - still employed by VitaLink and closely tied to Marsha-was brought in for questioning.



"I'm just a doctor," he protested, raising his voice."VitaLink hired me. I don't know anything about what the Wilde family's doing! Why are you taking me?"
"Answer our questions and you'll be fine. If you've done nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about."



Leland turned to Rylie, panic rising. "My sister and I are supposed to help treat Mr. Brad Morgan!"


"I'll manage without you," Rylie said, her voice flat."Maybe you should start thinking about your own mistakes."



Her face didn't change. She looked as if everything that had happened had gone exactly how she planned it.


In a room full of experts, Rylie had dragged the Wilde family's secrets into the light- and brought both them and VitaLink Hospital crashing down.


Leland's chest tightened with regret. He'd known that things weren't right. He'd seen mismatches between the diagnoses and the operations he performed. The hospital had been cutting corners-and worse-but he said nothing. Now he was being taken too.
Once he was gone, silence finally settled over the hall. No one spoke. The fear lingered. If the Wildes had gone down, who else might fall with them?


Then someone broke the quiet. "Check your phones!" a voice called out.
###Chapter 66 The Invite
No one saw it coming, but in a blink, every phone in the hall buzzed to life. Electronic billboards acrosS Crolens-once silent or looping dull ads-suddenly lit up with the exact same video.


Onscreen, a nervous middle-aged woman, hands shaking, held out a sheaf of medical documents. "Dr.Wilde, does my son really need imported drugs?Aren't the local ones good enough?"


The scene cut to Marsha's sharp profile. She didn't bother to hide her annoyance, cutting the woman off."If you're strapped for cash, why show up at all?"With a flick of her wrist, the report landed on the table. "The imported drug is far more effective than the local ones. If you truly love your son, shouldn't your priority be saving his life?"


A dull thud echoed as the woman collapsed to her knees, voice breaking. "Dr. Wilde, I'm begging you,please! I really can't afford the imported drug!"
Marshna's patience snapped. She rose to her feet,slamming the table and sending her heels clattering across the tile. "If you're going to beg, do it outside.Don't take up time for real patients!" Her glare shot to the nurse."Next!"


Security stepped in, dragging the woman away as her desperate cry echoed through the lobby."My son-he's only sixteen!"


Abruptly, the video cut off-only to fade back in with a different scene. This time, a nervous young intern approached Evita, medical file in hand. "Dr. Wilde,this woman just has a benign tumor. Surgery should be enough. There's no need to risk her life with so much chemotherapy before-"


Evita's response was brutal. She hurled the report in his face."Who runs this hospital, you or me? If I don't squeeze every penny out of the patients, how do l keep dead weight like you on payroll?"


The camera followed as the intern was forced out,humiliated and injured. In a later interview, voice hoarse with bitterness, he recounted the aftermath.

"I performed surgery with Dr. Kirk. He kept quiet even though he had connections-he was safe. But the rest of us? VitaLink ruined my hands for speaking up. Now I'll never touch a scalpel again. People call this the Wildes' hospital, but it's just a slaughterhouse feeding on sick people's misery."


After the intern's damning testimony, the video rolled on, one victim after another appearing onscreen.Each told of surgeries gone wrong, their lives permanently altered,families left in ruins.


Every story pointed the finger squarely at the Wildes,their once-sterling reputation now drenched in disgrace.


With the last testimonial fading to black, a wave of shock rippled across the city.


VitaLink Hospital - once the pride of Crolens -found itself at the center of a firestorm, outrage erupting in the streets and all over the news.


No sum the Wilde family could offer was enough to bury the scandal or halt the headlines racing across social media.
Almost overnight, both the Wildes and their flagship hospital became untouchable, their names whispered only in disgust.


Former allies wasted no time-connections with the Wildes were severed, everyone scrambling to avoid the fallout.


But for now, all the attendants just gaspoed at the chaos unfolding before them.


Yet the question hung in the air: Who orchestrated such.a devastating expose? Could Rylie have been involved?


As curious glances darted her way, Rylie merely offered a calm smile and waved her phone in the air."Just a little scare tactic. I didn't even dial anyone."


No police call had come from her; at least on the surface, she appeared uninvolved. Coincidence or not, Sean's keen gaze lingered on Rylie a moment longer before he spoke up. "That's all for today. The seminar is over."


Soon after, Brock leaned over, voice low. "Dr. Owen,
our general would like to invite you for coffee."


Rylie gave a small shake of her head. "It's too late for coffee tonight. I promised my grandfather I'd be home for dinner. Remind him to ease up on the coffee, and get more rest. Next week, make sure he stops by the clinic-the medication isn't working like it used to, and we're ready to move forward with the next phase."



Brock accepted her instructions with a simple nod."Will do."


Sliding her sun hat back in place, Rylie left the Morgan estate, making sure she was gone before the sky lost its glow.


Upstairs, Brad lingered at the wide study window,watching her stride away with a steady gait. "The police arrived out of nowhere," he said, "even we weren't given a heads up."


One of his staff replied from behind, "This was a covert sweep-meant to slip past the Wildes' actual protectors and nab the guilty without warning."
"Who orchestrated it?" Brad asked, eyes never leaving the horizon.


A brief pause, then the subordinate admitted, "The hacker covering their tracks is good. We haven't found them yet-but we're on it."


With Rylie gone from sight, Brad finally turned, a faint smile tugging at his mouth. "Forget it. There's no reason to dig any deeper."


His subordinate blinked, caught off guard by Brad's relaxed tone and almost approving smile. "If someone's righting wrongs, there's no needto keep them under a microscope."



..·


Back in her bedroom, Rylie's instincts immediately told her that something was amiss.


A careful scan of the space brought her straight to her desk. She called out for the servant. "Did anyone come in here today?"


Looking honestly confused, the servant shook her head. "No, Miss Owen. I only dropped off that music score you asked for."


The handwritten score still sat exactly where she'd left it, undisturbed. Yet something about the room still felt off. With nothing visibly missing, she let the servant go, but suspicion lingered in her mind.


If it wasn't Paola poking around, then it had to be that troublemaker Percy. What was he looking for in her room?Not finding any answers, Rylie decided to let the matter rest for now. She took a quick shower,changed into clean clothes, grabbed her motorcycle keys, and set off for the research lab that Brad had secured for her-ready to pick up where Timothy's work had left off.


Afternoon slid into evening, and Rylie was still deep in her research when her phone buzzed. Percy's name flashed on the screen, his message an unexpected invitation to meet at a bar later.


A faint frown creased her brow as she stared at the text. Percy had never shown much interest in her before; this out-of-the-blue invite seemed strange.


She kept her reply simple, saying, "Okay." Saving her latest results, she made up her mind to see what he was up to.


When darkness settled, Rylie zipped through city streets on her bike and parked outside the bar that Percy had named. Inside, thumping bass vibrated through her chest, shaking the floor as she made her way in. It didn't take long to spot Percy, lounging in a corner booth, a handful of sharply dressed friends gathered around him.


"Well, look who decided to grace us with her presence." Percy lifted his glass in mock salute, v/oice thick with sarcasm. "Honestly, I figured you'd chicken out."



Expression unreadable, Rylie slid into a seat across from him. "What's this about?"



With a sly laugh, Percy gestured to his group. "Word got around that I had a cousin nobody had met.Everyone wanted a look,so here we are."Around the table, designer jackets and sparkling dresses mixed with sly glances, his friends sizing Rylie up with smirks and curious eyes.
###Chapter 67 Beer Pong Stakes
"Have you thought about what we should call her?Percy calls her Rylie, but maybe we should use Miss Kirk instead."



"There's also the option of addressing her as Miss Owen.What do you think?"


"But even after she came back to the Owen family,they never made an official announcement. And even if she's an Owen, her personality is still so bad that she doesn't look like a gentlewoman at all."


Percy let out a loud snort. "Nobody in my family has the time for details like that. My cousins are tangled up in their own problems, and Grandfather is busy throwing a spring gala for my sister, It's no surprise Rylie slipped through the cracks."


Underneath these words was a clear message: Rylie barely mattered to them, just another invisible member tucked away in a house overflowing with money and secrets.


The truth was simpler than any of them realized -Rylie just wanted a quiet life, away from flashy events and gossip.


As for the spring gala, that was news to her. No one had ever mentioned it before.


Leaning back in her chair, Rylie looked indifferent. "It seems you truly care about the surname. But I'm different; whether you think I am an Owen or a Kirk doesn't matter. Percy, neither you nor Paola goes by the Owen name, and that does hurt you so much,right? After all, you want to be considered part of the Owen family by the public, but the surname makes many think you're not. Interesting, l've become an Owen without much effort, but you two just can't change your surname no matter how desperately you want."



That remark brought the conversation to a sudden halt, leaving the others scrambling for a response and making the tension in the air nearly tangible.


A cloud seemed to settle over Percy's face. "My sister and I have spent our whole lives with the Owens. We're just as much a part of this family as anyone."


Instead of arguing, Rylie flashed a cool smile, let her eyes roam across the table crowded with paper cups,and flicked a ping pong ball into one, splashing beer onto the table.



She continued, "Funny, isn't it? Your father never built his fortune inside the Owen family. He was dirt poor until he moved in with the Garretts, becoming their live-in son-in-law. Only then were you and your sister born, both carrying your mother's last name.Technically, you belong to the Garretts, but here you are, still living under my roof. Maybe you should ask yourselves why that is. Could it be that there's something wrong with your own family?"



The color drained from Percy's face, his embarrassment growing with every word.He always took pride in being recognized as an Owen, and hardly anyone dared bring up the Garrett name.Rylie's boldness cut deeper than he cared to admit.
He had intended to teach Rylie a lesson for his sister's sake, but instead, she had dominated the conversation, leaving him outmaneuvered and at a loss for words.


His patience running thin, Percy grabbed a nearby bottle and rose from his seat, thrusting it toward Rylie. "You'd better think before you speak, unless you're looking for trouble!"


The glass bottle hovered dangerously close to Rylie's face, prompting uneasy glances from the others.Still, she remained perfectly still, her calm and unwavering stare radiating a quiet, unsettling strength.


"You seem to forget I am your cousin, Percy. Treating your family like this truly isn't what an Owen would do."


With every second under Rylie's gaze, Percy's nerves twisted in knots, yet his humiliation only made his temper flare hotter.


Before things escalated, one of his friends stepped in, gently urging Percy to set the bottle down and return to his seat.


Unbothered, Rylie swept her eyes across the cluttered table. "So, what's everyone playing tonight?"


Someone answered from across the table, "It's beer pong."


The idea seemed to spark something in Percy."You've probably played before at school,haven't you,Rylie?"


Although she hadn't joined in herself, Rylie understood the game's basics. "You called me here just for a drinking game? Is this really how you spend your time?"



Yet again, Rylie managed to turn the conversation back on him, her words stinging sharper than before.Percy forced a laugh, frustration showing, "Actually,I've got plenty on my plate. I'm studying for the Navy enlistment exam."



With a raised brow and an unimpressed look, Rylie eyed Percy up and down before letting out a sigh.
"You thínk so?"


The jab couldn't have been more obvious. Tapping his own chest, Percy replied, "That's right. I finished third in a world-famous hacking competition. The Navy could use someone like me. Even Brad had good things to say. You really think everyone from the Owen family is as worthless as you?"


A sudden laugh burst from Rylie. "Are you talking about that contest? The trophy meant nothing, just some plastic hype. Brad was only trying to be polite because he's older than you."


In truth, her entry into the competition was out of sheer boredom, and the system's weak security made it laughably easy- Britton could have taken first without breaking a sweat. No one could say Percy had real talent.


Percy's patience had clearly reached its limit. "You think you're better than me? What do you even know,being a woman and all?"


Rylie tossed another ping pong ball into a c up."Maybe I don't know everything, but I'm certain I canFrom the corner, one of the rich guys let out a low whistle and said, "Come on, Rylie, even we can't win against Percy at this. Don't set yourself up to lose."


A smirk played on Rylie's lips. "So, are we playing or what?"



Excitement lit up Percy's face, but he was in no rush to make it easy for her. He gave a discreet signal, and a glamorous woman at his side chimed in, "What's the fun in just drinking? Why not clear out the other side's cups and add a little dare for whoever loses?"


Percy, not missing a beat, raised the stakes. "Alright,if you lose, Rylie, you've got to do a strip tease right here on the pole. Deal?"


Her answer was a calm smile. "Fine, but if you're the one who loses?"



Confident to the point of arrogance, Percy replied,"That's not going to happen."


Rylie's grin only widened.,if you end up losing,
you'll be the one stripping and putting on a show for everyone,okay?"
###Chapter 68 I'll Take A Look Myself
Percy gave a firm nod and said, "Sure."


Cheers exploded from the crowd, drawing glances from every corner of the bar and sending the energy surging through the room like a spark on dry timber.


Even the noise made its way to the suite on the upper floor.


Inside the VIP room, a man in a dark suit lounged on a sofa. He held an unlit cigar but waved off the lighter offered by the man kneeling beside him.


"| don't smoke anymore. What's all that fuss outside?"



"Just some kids getting overexcited."


Ronan Boyd leaned closer, holding out a lighter with a nervous smile. "I know your health isn't great.I wouldn't have dragged you to such a smoky mess if it weren't important."
Brad ignored the lighter and turned it over in his hand. "The mayor's secretary got arrested this morning.Same with the Wilde family. Tell me, Ronan -how deep are you in this?"


"I swear | wasn't part of their organ trafficking. I do have lines I don't cross," said Ronan, trying to sound steady. "But now they're trying to frame me. If that sticks, I'm done."


Brad spoke coolly. "I'm in the military. I don't cover for criminals."



Ronan quickly added, "Of course, I understand. But you know this bar is just a side business. It's to maintain relationships with big clients who buy medical equipment. I assure you, my dealings in medical devices are entirely legitimate. I wouldn't risk anything else, especially when the equipment for your fleet alone is profitable enough."


Brad stared hard at him, eyes sharp enough to see through walls. Ronan gulped and lifted a trembling hand. "I promise I've done nothing shady. This is a setup. The Wilde family tried to interfere with the fleet's health systems, and I reported them. You know l've always been straight with you."


Brad didn't speak for a beat. Then he slowly raised his hand. "I get it."


Ronan felt the air return to his lungs. That gesture was all the reassurance he needed.


Downstairs, the noise grew louder. Ronan frowned and turned toward the door. He waved at the waiter."Go check what's happening. It's bothering my guest."


The waiter stepped closer and explained, "Mr.Percy Garrett is playing games with his cousin."


Ronan scoffed, visibly annoyed, "I don't care who they are. Go down and tell them to keep it quiet.Drinks are free tonight, but don't let them disturb us."


Before the waiter could leave, Brad stood up. He smoothed his suit and said calmly, "No need. I'll take a look myself."


Ronan blinked in surprise. He didn't expect Brad to care about whatever nonsense the rich kids were doing, but he said nothing. He bowed slightly and trailed after Brad.



"There's really nothing of value going on down there," Ronan mumbled.


On the lower level, Percy's group had already gathered. Some were whistling, others had their phones up to record the scene.



The lights in the bar flickered, throwing dim shadows across Rylie's steady face. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and slowly scanned the glasses lined up on the table.



"You first." Percy pushed the balls in her direction,the motion almost daring.


Without hesitation, Rylie let out a soft chuckle. She grabbed a ball, tossed it without aiming, and watched it arc cleanly into the farthest glass. A small splash followed.



The crowd let out a loud cheer.
Percy's face shifted for a moment, but he caught himself and said, "Not bad luck."


He took his shot next. After a brief pause, he squinted, aimed, and let the ball fly. It barely cleared the rim before dropping in.


"This pace is too slow," said Rylie. "Can I toss two at a time?"



Some in the crowd exchanged doubtful glances.They knew the odds were tougher that way.


Still, Percy smirked and agreed, "Fine. Just don't cry about it when you lose."


Rylie picked up two balls and sent themn flying. They dropped cleanly into two glasses. Percy tried to pass it off as sheer luck. But that excuse wore thin. One after another, she knocked out half his glasses without missing.


On his next turn, Percy misjudged the throw. The ball skipped the rim and hit the floor. He started to sweat and tapped his fingers against the table,restless.
Rylie leaned her chin on her hand. Her smile was faint but unmistakably smug. "Nervous already Percy?"


His jaw tightened. "Don't get cocky." He rose abruptly, leaned forward, and tossed the ball again.This time, it sank in.


He let out a breath and glanced at her. "You're up."


Rylie nonchalantly picked up three balls, not even glancing at the table, and tossed them at once. The balls spun in the air and landed steadily in Percy's last three glasses.



Silence swept the room.
###Chapter 69 Deliberately Falling Down To Gain Sympathy
"No way!" Percy slammed the table hard, sending his wine glass toppling over. The red liquid splashed across the surface in a messy spill.


Rylie rose from her seat with unhurried grace,smoothing out the folds in her sleeves. "A bet is a bet. And don't forget it's you who proposed this game."



The blood was drained from his face as the crowd started shouting, "Take it off! Take it off!"


His jaw clenched. Without warning, he grabbed a bottle nearby and smashed it on the table. Glass shards flew everywhere as the room recoiled in shock.



"Enough! Shut up!" he yelled.


The chanting stopped instantly. Rylie stood her ground, calm as ever. Her eyes didn't even blink.


She stared straight at him, her voice low but firm."Someone who can't accept their defeat gracefully doesn't deserve to be an Owen."


His pride crumbled. Jaw tight, shoulders hunched, he walked toward the platform. He undid his buttons,one by one, revealing bare skin under the dim lights.Before he could finish, the door to the bar flung open.


Paola rushed inside, her white dress flowing behind her."Wait!"



She hurried forward, pulling Percy's shirt back over his shoulders and shielding him with her own body.


Facing Rylie, she spoke softly. Her voice trembled,though she tried to hold her head high. "Rylie, Percy doesn't mean any harm. He's still young. Please don't hold this against him."


She dipped her head slightly. Her lashes trembled like a hurt child pretending to be brave. Still, she  forced a smile. "He acts without thinking sometimes,but he never means to offend. If he did, then l sincerely apologize. Please don't make this harder on him."



She reached for Percy's hand and clasped it gently.The gesture was tender, like a bird shielding its chick.Her gaze was steady, yet something fragile lingered in her eyes. "If you're angry," she said, "then blame me. I didn't guide him well."


The crowd began to murmur.


"Rylie's being too harsh. Actually, she's the one who doesn't deserve to be an Owen, always so aggressive and impolite."


"Paola's so gracious. Even stepping in for her brother."




Behind her, Percy stood stiff and restless. Watching her defend him only added to his frustration. He leaned in and muttered, "You don't have to do this,Paola."



Instead of replying, she gave his hand a slight squeeze. It was a silent plea to stay quíet. Her eyes stayed on Rylie, wide and brimming with unspoken words.


Rylie let out a soft laugh. "Now I'm a little lost."


She stepped forward and looked Paola in the eye."He invited me here. He set up the game. He said whoever loses will have to admit defeat." Her gaze sharpened. "So tell me, how exactly did I become the villain in your story, Paola?"


Rylie didn't flinch, not even for a second. Paola had counted on her reacting, but nothing came. Her silence left no room for Paola's bait to land.


Paola bit her lip. In a sudden move, she stepped in and gripped Rylie's arm. "Don't take this too seriously," she said, forcing a smile. "It's just a game.For the sake of the Owen family's dignity, think of the bigger picture."


Just as Rylie was about to pull her arm free, Paola unexpectedly tugged on it, pushing it against herself.The next moment, her delicate face showed a hint of panic as she stumbled backward off the stage.
"Ah!"



"Paola!" shouted Percy, bolting forward.


The pole stage wasn't high. A few people in the crowd caught her before she could hit the floor hard,so she landed without getting hurt.



She sat cradling her ankle, her face tight with pain.Tears brimmed in her eyes as she stared at Rylie. Her voice trembled. "You've never liked me,but-why did you push me?"



She winced dramatically, and her act worked.The room stirred with outrage.



"Rylie went too far!"



"Paola was being kind, and she got pushed?"



"No wonder the Kirks threw her out. Even with money, she acts like a street thug. Look how she treats her cousin."



Percy burned with anger. He pointed at Rylie and shouted, "That's enough! You've gone too far!"
The voices swelled, each louder than the last, but Rylie stood in place. Her face was calm. A faint,unreadable smile tugged at her lips.



She stepped down slowly, stopping in front of Paola.Her eyes lowered, and her voice came out smooth and quiet. "I have to say, Paola, youracting's not bad at all."


Paola froze for a beat, then dipped her head again,her voice even softer. "Rylie, what are you talking about? I don't understand-"


Rylie didn't bother to answer. She lifted her head and swept her gaze across the room. "This place has security cameras. We can check what happened."


Paola's expression faltered. Her hand twitched as it reached for her skirt, fingers curling into the fabric.She knew this bar well. Percy came here often. The owner made sure no cameras were ever active. Big shots and heirs preferred it that way. There would be no footage.


With this thought, Paola steadied herself, then smiled again. "If you'd like to check, that's fine. I just hope that when the truth comes out, you'Il show Percy some understanding. We'll callit even,yes?"


Rylie watched her carefully. There was a quiet flicker in Paola's eyes. Paola's confidence wasn't coming from innocence. It came from knowing that the cameras had been turned off long ago. Clearly, Paola had come tonight to ruin her.


At that moment, the door on the second floor creaked open. Ronan raised a hand, and the blaring rock music stopped. People paused mid-conversation and turned to look up.


A tall figure stepped into view. Brad stood at the top of the stairs, one hand in his pocket, the other flicking a metal lighter open and closed. His voice carried down without effort. "What's all the noise about?"


The room stilled. Heads turned. Under the dim glow,his sharp features caught the flickering flame, and for a moment, no one spoke.
###Chapter 70 Won't Let Anyone Escape Blame
Paola's eyes shifted. Then, with practiced ease, she slipped into a sorrowful look. "Brad."


A sharp click rang out as Brad closed his lighter. He straightened from where he had been leaning against the rail and began to descend the steps.


The crowd, made up of heirs and high-society offspring, instinctively moved aside, parting to make way for him.



Rylie kept her eyes on him as he walked forward. His presence was rare in places like this. Still, every glance, every whisper, every breath turned in his direction, drawn in like water pulled by a whirlpool.


Brad didn't flinch at the attention. At the edge of the dance floor, he paused and lifted his chin slightly."What's the fuss this time?"
Percy, eager for Brad's approval, jumped down from the stage and pointed at Rylie. "It was her. She almost hurt my sister. She's always like this."


Paola tugged on his arm. Her voice softened,her eyes dropped, and she interrupted gently. "Please don't say that. Rylie didn't mean anything. I wasn't pushed. I just slipped. Please don't blame her, Brad."


Rylie folded her arms. She watched Paola put on the act, her face unreadable. The dramatics would've won an award. She couldn't confront Paola here, but outside, a stern talking-to in the alley was certainly on the table.



A blind spot? That wasn't hard for Rylie to find.


She had something planned already. Nothing too elegant. Just enough to settle the score. But Brad's sudden step into the mess threw her off.


"A bet's a bet. It has to be kept." Brad's calm voice cut through the noise. He looked at Percy and spoke again. "This is something you should've learned in grade school."
Percy tensed. His lips parted, ready to argue. Brad didn't give him the chance. "You'd rather break your word than lose face? And now you've got your sister pretending she fell, so that you could escape from honoring the bet?" He gave a small laugh. "Is this what the Garretts teach their children?"


That line settled the matter. Everyone caught it. Brad didn't count the Garrett siblings as part of the Owen name. Rylie didn't miss it either.


Paola's face turned ashen. She reached out quickly and said, "Brad, it's really not what you think-"


Brad lifted his hand to stop her mid-sentence. His gaze had cooled, and his voice carried the weight of quiet disapproval. "Paola, it's one thing for your brother to act like a child. But why are you making it worse by getting involved?"


Then he shifted toward Percy. "You started this. Now that you've lost, you think backing out and blaming others is acceptable?"


He moved forward slowly, stopping just in front of Percy. "Do you know what kind of person I can't stand?" His tone dropped to a cutting chill. "It's people like you. You stir up trouble and then hide behind someone else when it backfires. If that's how you handle pressure, how do you expect to serve in uniform?" Percy turned pale and retorted loudly, "I do admit l lost! I'm just furious that Rylie pushed my sister.Brad, how can you take such a violent woman's side?"



Brad turned and looked at Rylie. "Did you push her?"


Rylie gave a dry snort. "If I had meant to do that, she wouldn't be standing upright."


He nodded, knowing full well that she wasn't exaggerating.


He reached for Paola's shoulder. His words sounded kind, but a cold note slipped in. "You've always treated me as a friend. If this truly isn't your fault, I'l make sure you get the justice you deserve."


Paola's heart thudded, thinking maybe he still felt something for her. She offered a soft voice,trying to sound gracious. "Thank you, Brad. But I'm really okay. We can just let this go."


Brad shook his head. "I won't falsely accuse anyone.But I won't let anyone escape blame either. Rylie owes you a proper explanation."


Off to the side, Ronan's eyes found Brad's. He hesitated for a second, then said as he grasped what Brad wanted him to do, "There was a recent inspection. I ended up fixing the bar's cameras. The recording should be available. I'll bring it over, Mr.Morgan."



Paola's face, once bright with hope, suddenly tightened. The recording available? The timing couldn't have been worse.



She stepped forward quickly. "There's no need, Brad.It's fine. Really."


Percy gripped her hand. "Paola, don't let this go just because you're nice. Rylie has to apologize. Let's check the footage."


Rylie gave a sharp smile, eyes shining with  amusement. "Yes. Let's do that. I'm all for it."


Brad pointed toward the largest screen in the room."You know what to do. Put it up."


Then he looked back at Paola. Her face had gone pale. Still, he smiled gently and said, "You'll never be mistreated while I'm around, Paola. Not on my watch."
###Chapter 71 Ice Bath
Paola felt the weight in her chest tighten, her hands damp with sweat. It felt like she might collapse any second. She prayed the dim lights in the bar would blur the truth. Maybe the camera wouldn't catch every move.


Behind the scenes, Ronan moved quickly. He went to fetch footage from tiny pinhole cameras tucked into the corners of the room.


The obvious cameras hadn't been helpful. Ronan had installed the hidden ones for patrons who liked privacy but still needed protection.


Those discreet lenses had night vision. They recorded high-definition footage that clearly showed Paola pulling Rylie and then throwing herself to the floor.



As the video played across the large screen, the noise in the room swelled.
Paola stood frozen, color drained from her face. Her lips quivered as she tried to keep herself steady.


On the screen, the moment of her pulling Rylie was clear. Even the quick flicker in her eyes betrayed her intent.


"No - this has to be wrong - " she whispered,staggering back a step in her heels.


Brad moved just in time, catching her arm before she fell. His voice stayed quiet, but something in it struck hard. "Paola, steady yourself. The footage didn't miss a thing. Even your expression was recorded."


Percy snapped his head toward her. His eyes widened, disbelief splashed across his face. "Paola...did you really..."


The crowd erupted.


"What a performance!"


"She wasn't fragile at all. She planned the whole thing!"


"Paola really went too far with that trick..."
Paola trembled and suddenly yanked herself out of Brad's grasp. She raised her hand and pointed furiously at the screen. Her voice cracked as she shouted, "That's fake! It's been edited! Rylie... she's behind it!"



"Enough." Brad's voice cut through the uproar like a blade. Calm,but final.


He took out a handkerchief and wiped his hand where her tears had fallen. His eyes locked on her."Paola, keep pushing this, and things will only get worse."



Paola's knees buckled, and she crumpled to the floor. The waves of tears had smeared her makeup,her carefully curled hair now hanging in limp strands across her face. Whatever pity she once stirred had long faded.


Brad turned to Rylie. "Performing pole dances with lewd content might be a bit much. Why not let Percy and Paola admit fault and apologize?"


Rylie gave a faint smile. Brad had delivered the stage perfectly. "I suppose I can be generous."
Percy bent down to lift Paola, but she went limp in his arms.


Whether she fainted or faked it didn't matter to Rylie.She snorted quietly and said, "That's enough for tonight. I've had my fill. Take her to the hospital before something worse happens."


Even though Percy's frustration burned beneath the surface, he didn't saya word. He carried his sister out of the bar, not once looking back.


Brad signaled for everyone to leave. He didn't rush,choosing instead to trail behind Rylie at an easy pace.


Without turning around, Rylie said, "Given your condition, it's pretty bold of you to show up here tonight."


Brad's tone stayed even. "I didn't drink. Just came to settle a few things."


She let the subject drop. Once they reached the parking lot, she climbed onto her motorcycle. Before sliding on her helmet, she glanced sideways and said, "Thanks for the help. Don't be late for your next treatment."



He stood beside her and asked, "If I hadn't brought up the footage, were you just going to let this go?"


Rylie gave a low laugh. "In some way, you kept Paola alive tonight. There are blind spots in this city's surveillance. Whatever she could do in those places,I could have done far worse."



The warning in her words was clear.


Brad gave a small laugh. "So I meddled for nothing."


She shook her head. "Not quite. For someone like Paola, who parades herself as noble, public disgrace cuts deeper than any bruise. Her reputation's done for. And honestly, that's kind of satisfying."







Several days passed before the treatment resumed.


Rylie had temporarily changed the location to the researcch lab on campus.
With Timothy's project team now gone, the lab belonged to her alone.


Brad showed up right on time. As he stepped inside,he saw her absorbed in calibrating the equipment.She didn't glance his way. Under the cold lab lights,her white coat made her seem distant. Her fingers moved with precision as she worked the controls.


"You're just in time," she said, still facing the monitor."Lock the door."



Without comment, he reached back and slid the bolt into place.


He made his way to the lab bench, catching sight of a glowing blue vial resting under the lamp.



"This the new stuff?"



She turned at last, her eyes sharp and bright above her mask. "Yes. This one's different. It's a neuro-support compound to prep your nerves for surgery."


She motioned toward a deep container tucked into the corner. "But it's stronger than Nexo-7. You'll feel like your whole system's on fire. That's why I brought the ice bath."


Brad looked at the cold tub and raised a brow."Feels like I walked into an Ice Bucket Challenge."


"If that's too much for you, skip it," she said, voice even. "Still, the Nexo-7 won't hold up much longer.You'll start seeing the changes when you check the mirror."



He didn't argue, but his face told another story.Each day, he looked more worn, his skin a touch grayer,like something was drained from him slowly.


Anyone who understood the body would know he wasn't fine. Whatever pain he'd been suppressing had come back stronger and showed no signs of easing.


Brad sighed, unbuttoning his shirt. "Looks like I don't have a choice."



Rylie turned away and moved toward the machines,letting him handle it on his own. The faint rustle of cloth met her ears.
"All set." Brad voice came from the bath, slightly muffled.


Rylie glanced over her shoulder. He sat waist-deep in the ice, only his head and shoulders above the surface.



The cold had already colored his skin, outlining the shape of his muscles beneath the freezing water.
###Chapter 72 You'll Reach Full Recovery

Rylie steadied herself, reaching for the syringe that pulsed faintly with a blue glow. Under the lamp, its fine tip glinted like ice.


She walked over to the tub and knelt beside it. Her eyes stayed on the vein that throbbed in Brad's neck.


"This will sting," she said softly, fingers resting gently on his skin.


Just then, Brad caught her wrist, halting her. He turned partway to glance at her. "I'm not scared of pain. But the last time you used something this strong,it wrecked me."


Deep down, he didn't wwant to show such vulnerability in front of her again.


Their eyes locked. The freezing bath, warmed by his body, no longer felt like a barrier. Something between "Then you'd have to brace yourself for this - this one's worse," she told him, her voice low. "It targets your nerves. All of them." Her tone softened slightly."You have to endure it. I'll help you as much as I can."


In that moment, the sharpness she carried melted into something steadier. Her presence carried weight and calm, like someone you trusted without question.


"With you here, Dr. Owen, I've got nothing to worry about."



Brad let her go and turned his head. "Do it."


The needle broke his skin. His body jerked.


Rylie felt his pulse spike under her fingers. The muscles in his neck snapped tight.


As the drug entered his system, his breath turned heavy. Sweat lined his forehead and slid down his jaw, dripping into the bath below.


"You're doing fine. Just hang in there." Her voice dipped lower without meaning to. She reached up and steadied his shoulder.


His body shivered beneath her hand, trembling as the compound lit up every nerve it touched.



The second the last bit of fluid emptied, Brad abruptly lifted his head. His throat flexed, and a soft groan left his lips, low and rough.


Veins branched out in his eyes like spiderwebs,and he leaned forward without meaning to, dragged by a force he couldn't resist.



Rylie leaned in just as he faltered, steadying him before he could fall forward. The warmth of his breath grazed her neck, heavy and sharp with pain.



Without thinking, she placed her palm against his back and traced slow lines along both sides of his spine.



"Keep breathing. Nice and easy." Her fingers pressed with practiced care, targeting the places most likely to tense up. Each movement was precise, meant to release pressure, not cause more of it.
Brad's muscles began to loosen. Even so, his skin burned beneath her touch, standing out against the cold bite of the ice.


The ice surrounding him thinned fast, melting in thick drops under the heat of his body.


When she pressed her thumb beneath his shoulder blade, he flinched, letting out a muffled groan before gripping her wrist.


Rylie looked up, meeting his gaze.


Moisture clung to his lashes, and something unreadable flickered behind his usual stare.



"Don't press there." His voice had lost its usual edge,rasping with effort. Still, he kept hold of her wrist,as if needing the contact.


Rylie didn't pull away. Instead, she used her other hand to gently knead the side of his neck."How about this spot? Is it sore too?"



Brad gave a slight shake of his head. A few droplets fell from his lashes and splashed into the water.His breathing eased, yet his grip stayed firm. The ripples in the tub caught the light, dancing across the sharp planes of his face.


"Are you feeling any better?" she asked, the words softer than she intended.



Brad lifted his eyes and noticed the slight gap in her coat. Beneath it, the edge of a plain white shirt peeked out. As she leaned forward, the faint line of her collarbone came into view, and for a moment,that was all he could see. What hit him next wasn't the drug. It was the sight of her. And it burned hotter.


Neither of them spoke. Even the sound of melting ice was loud in the silence. Their breaths matched without effort, drawn in unison.


"lf | said no," he murmured, eyes still fixed on her."Would you keep treating me?"


For the first time, Brad let down his usual aloof facade, his brows furrowed in pain, yet a faint,defiant smile tugged at his lips.


Only then did Rylie register just how close they were.
She had nearly dropped to her knees in front of the ice bucket, completely surrounded by his presence.


She drew her hand away in a rush and accidentally brushed a vial with her elbow. It tipped and shattered beside her, the glass snapping the moment in half.


Her voice returned to its usual measured calm as she took a step back. "The peak effects have passed.Stay in for ten more minutes, then you're free to come out."



Brad.didn't respond. His fingers dug into the tub's edge, his eyes fixed on the faint pink across her ears.Her composure unsettled him more than it should have.



By the time ten minutes had gone, the improvement was clear.He climbed out of the tub, water falling at his feet in waves.


Without meaning to, Rylie glanced up, The backlight caught him in full silhouette as he reached for the robe.



That view- his shoulders broad, waist tapering in a sharp line - cast a tall shadow beside the bucket.Water traced slow paths down his spine.


"Enjoying the view?" He turned slightly as he spoke,a half-smile tugging at his mouth.


Rylie looked away just as quickly, brushing off the moment. "Leave the top open. I need to check the nerves along your back."


Brad turned obediently and tugged the robe down to his waist. The muscles across his shoulders shifted as he moved, catching the light in a way that made it hard to look away.


Faint scars ran across his skin. Instead of dulling his appearance,they gave him a rawness that drew the eye.


Rylie studied the results, breathing out in quiet relief."It's working. You'Il need monthly injections to keep feeding the nerves until you're ready for the procedure. With my Al-assisted method, you'll reach full recovery."


Brad's eyes brightened at the mention of a full recovery. He dressed and thanked her in a raspy voice. "I'll pay every penny of your fee. If you can really cure me, I'll agree to any request you make."


Rylie raised an eyebrow. "Any request? Even murder?"





Brad paused, the corner of his mouth curling with amusement. "From now on, Dr. Owen,your enemies are mine."



That vow, spoken in his low voice, left no room for doubt. He had chosen his side-and it was hers.
###Chapter 73 Willing To Be A Test Subject
ylie suddenly let out a laugh. "Alright."


Just then, the doors of the research institute burst open. Deandre's cheerful voice echoed through the entrance. "Rylie, your classmates said you were here -"

He froze when he saw Brad looking messy and half-dressed. His smile vanished, replaced by a scowl.Muscles tense, he stepped forward and pulled Rylie behind him. "What the hell, Brad! Are you messing around with my sister?"
Deandre swung a heavy punch, but Brad caught it easily. "You've misunderstood," Brad said calmly.


"Misunderstood? Your boxers are on that chair,and there's a tub right there! You call that a misunderstanding? You sure know how to enjoy yourself! Deandre raised his leg to kick, but Brad blocked it like it was nothing.


Brad, a little thrown by Deandre's anger, muttered,"Even if I was indeed intimate with your sister, what's wrong with that? She's already twenty, and she has every right to have a boyfriend. Why are you so furious?"



Rylie saw Deandre's face flush with rage. She quickly grabbed his arm and pulled him back. "Deandre,calm down. It's really not what you think."


Deandre turned to her. Her calm expression stopped him cold. Something inside him cracked.


He had barely spent time with her since coming back,and now Brad was taking her away?


He turned back, grabbed her shoulders, and leaned in. His voice dropped with urgency. "Rylie, listen to me. You can't be with Brad. He's always traveling for work - sometimes gone for years. When he's not away, he's dodging assassins. And now, he's sick.He doesn't have much time left. Are you really going to waste your youth on someone like him? I don't support this. Break up. You have to break up!"
Rylie tilted her head toward Brad with a sigh. "Look at the mess you've made."


Brad's smile remained, but his eyes turned cold.Deandre's words had hit him right in the gut.


He worried Rylie might take them seriously. But there was no space between them for half-truths.


"Deandre, he's lying to you," Rylie said, patting her brother's arm and pointing to the cluttered lab bench. "I was mixing a formula for him. I'm treating Mr. Morgan's illness, and I told him to soak in the ice bucket. That's all."



Only then did Deandre notice Rylie's lab coat,hanging loosely like a prop.


She was still a university student. Sure,she'd helped Rory with Felix's tumor surgery, but Brad's case was on another level.


Deandre looked at her seriously. "Rylie, stop lying.My team already analyzed Brad's condition. We couldn't treat him. How can you? You're still a student. You want to date? Fine, I'll protect you. But He continued, "Even if Brad dies and leaves you a fortune, we don't need his money. You can't throw away your future like this."


Rylie let out a breath. "I'm not playing around,Deandre. What will make you believe me?"


Deandre's tone deepened. "Any drug used on Brad needs rounds of research and trials. You've been busy with school and parties. When did you have time to develop a cure? And trials need donors and high-level approval. You don't even have a license.How could you do all that?"


Rylie paused. By her official identity, she didn't have a license. But on the dark web, as the Healing Hand,she did. Telling him that would only make things Worse.



At that moment, Brad stepped in. "I trust her. And she's already injected the medication."


Deandre blinked. "Injected? Was it tested?"
"No. He's my test subject," Rylie answered.


The words stunned Deandre. Rylie braced for his anger-she had clearly broken the rules. But instead of scolding, Deandre went silent. He seemed lost in thought.


Then he looked at Brad and said solemnly, "Whatever she's done, I'll take the blame. If you still have a conscience, don't let her carry the weight when you're gone."


Rylie was taken aback. Her brother was willing to take the fall for her.


Her voice softened. "Deandre, Mr. Sean Morgan knows that I want Mr. Morgan to be my patient, and he gave his permission. If you're still unsure, call him.Ask directly. Then you'll know if I'm telling the truth."


Her tone was steady and sincere. There was no sign of a lie.



Deandre hesitated. He didn't know what to believe anymore. Brad, now dressed, spoke calmly. "I'll head back. My father will talk to Mr. Kendrick Owen soon.
As for my illness, it's in fate's hands. No matter what happens, Rylie won't be dragged into it."
###Chapter 74 Brad's Revelation


Brad had always been known for his honesty, especially when the matter was serious. Deandre, though initially skeptical, was beginning to come around.

Rylie motioned for Deandre to follow her to the bench. The surface was covered in her tightly packed notes,all carefully arranged and easy to follow. She handed them over without hesitation. "These are the details of my experiments. Go ahead and look through them. Ask me if anything's unclear."

He gave the stack a nod before finally taking it. "Alright. I'll read them later."

Brad glanced at the clock. "It's getting late. Let's go grab something to eat."

Without missing a beat, Deandre answered, "We'll eat when we get home."①

Brad reminded him, "The drive from here to the Serenity Manor takes two hours."

Rylie agreed that the commute wasn't ideal. She also had plans to stop by HaloFlow Pharmacy that afternoon. "There are plenty of places to eat nearby," she said. "Let's just have lunch here."

Deandre let out a reluctant breath. "Fine. What do you feel like eating?"

Before she could reply, Brad offered a suggestion. "There's a new steakhouse around the corner. Nice setting."

go there," said Rylie with a small nod.

She stepped outside first and stopped short when she nearly bumped into someone standing frozen near the entrance. Stacey looked tired, her face drawn, her eyes fixed on the lab sign. She blinked at the sight of Rylie and asked without thinking, "What are you doing here?"

Rylie lifted an eyebrow. "The lab's been assigned to me. I'm running experiments. Why wouldn't I be here?"

Stacey stared at her, unable to look away. Under the morning sun, Rylie looked far too composed,her presence more striking than ever. Envy burned hot behind Stacey's clenched fists. The same girl she had tried to erase. The same girl who had lived under her shadow for years. And now, that girl was flourishing after leaving the Kirk name behind.
Her own life, meanwhile, had unraveled. Fred had broken off their engagement. Gossip clung to her wherever she went. Her brothers had grown colder with each passing day. Things were only getting worse.

She had meant to lash out, to throw an insult and maybe regain a sliver of pride. But before she could open her mouth, something else caught her eye. Two men stepped out of the lab behind Rylie. Both tall. Both unmistakable. Stacey recognized them right away. Names she had memorized. Faces she had daydreamed about. They were the kind of men she'd always hoped to meet in another life, the kind who lived in the world she had always chased but never reached.

And suddenly, her plan changed. She dropped to her knees and clutched Rylie's pant leg. Her voice cracked as she cried, "Rylie, I'm begging you. I'm kneeling. Please help our mother!"

The outburst didn't go unnoticed. Several students nearby stopped walking and turned to stare.

Brad and Deandre came up behind, and Deandre frowned at the sight. "What's happening?"

Before Rylie could answer, Stacey interrupted, tears streaking her cheeks. "Nicolas is dying, and Mom can't even stand today. I know you think you're better than us now, but they raised you for years. Please. Just come see them. Help them one last time."

With that, she twisted the moment, casting Rylie as heartless in front of everyone.

Whispers rippled through the crowd of students nearby.

Rylie kept her tone even.parents live in the countryside and work the fields. Stacey, what exactly are you saying?"

Stacey turned toward Deandre, her expression full of disbelief. Rylie's response made no sense. She had clearly returned to the Owen family and even had such influential brothers.

"Stop pretending. You're with the Owen family," Stacey insisted, her tears spilling again "I'm not after money. I just want you to help our Mom and brother."

Rylie slowly lowered herself to meet hereye. "What nonsense is that? My parents are farmers. Who started this ridiculous rumor about me becoming wealthy?" She glanced away briefly. "The Kirk family already kicked me out. It made the news. You all cutties with me. Now you want me to come back? For what? And 'Our' Mom and brother? Sorry, they're yours, not mine."

Stacey panicked and blurted, "You're the reason Nicolas and Mom started getting better. You used your

own medicine. If you refuse now, they will die because of you! How heartless you are!"

Rylie stared at her, blinking once. "What medicine? I don't even have a license. I'm still in school. I can't treat anyone legally.Where are you getting these stories?"

The students around them began talking in hushed voices again.

"Everyone knows the Kirk family turned her away. They even made it public. Now Stacey's groveling in front of her?"

"Why is she even asking Rylie? Leland is the doctor in the family. He should be the one helping, not a student."

Brad, who hadn't spoken yet, finally joined the conversation. "Leland might not be able to help either."

The entire group turned toward him, watching closely.

Stacey felt her stomach twist. Brad didn't rush. "Leland was arrested for medical fraud and organ trafficking. He's already in custody."

The color was drained from Stacey's face. "You're lying. What are you saying?"

She had known Leland was missing for days, but the police hadn't revealed anything. The family still didn't know what the charges were.

Brad's smile was faint but firm. "You'll know the truth by tonight. It'll be on the news."
###Chapter 75 This Is Only Fair


The air shifted. Students nearby glanced at one another, their faces tinged with shock. Organ trafficking wasn't just tabloid gossip. It was a crime. The idea that the once-respected Kirk family might be involved? It made stomachs turn.

Rylie hadn't said a word, but it didn't matter. Rumors moved quicker than sound, and by now, the crowd had turned on Stacey.

Rylie knelt, brushed her fingers under Stacey's chin, and exhaled slowly. "You forced me out, thinking you were cleaning house. But you pushed out the one person keeping your family together. Now look at it.You're all falling apart."④

She didn't raise her voice. Her calm made it worse. "You tossed out my medicine and put your faith in Marsha's nonsense. And what happened? Nicolas can't walk anymore. Soon, he'll lose his legs. Your mother's condition hasn't improved either. That's on you. You stood in front of them and made promises you couldn't keep. And they believed you."

Rylie spoke gently, almost like she felt bad. Her expression, though, said otherwise. "Their health keeps spiraling. You're here now, hoping I'll fix what you broke. You don't care if I succeed. You just want someone to blame when things go wrong again."

Stacey's face went pale. Rylie had struck a nerve. But Stacey wasn't here just for that; she was trying to get close to Deandre too.

Through tears, Stacey finally choked out, "I realize l messed up. I shouldn't have stolen the affection for you from our parents and brothers. Do whatever you want to me, just save Mom and Nicolas."

Just as Stacey was about to kneel before Rylie again, Deandre frowned even more and pulled Rylie away from her. "Are you sure you want to keep dealing with this kind of person?"

Stacey froze,hearing Rylie deliberately ask innocently, "What kind of person?"

Deandre didn't hesitate."The type who uses pity and deceit to climb up. Women like her ruin people's lives just to get ahead. Don't waste your energy on that trash."

The insult hit hard. Trash? Stacey sat there, stunned. Had she really sunk to that level?
Rylie's stare cut through her. "You knew what would help your mother. The prescription exists. So why haven't you gotten it?" She didn't pause. "Is the cost so much that the whole Kirk family's assets aren't even enough to cover that? Or maybe you just don't want to help her anymnore?"

Deandre leaned forward and said, "Nicolas has built up a decent fortune. If he passes and Leland ends up behind bars, what's stopping you and Phillip from plotting something?"

He left the rest unsaid. But it was obvious. People were beginning to suspect that Stacey and Phillip were aiming to seize what belonged to the family.

Stacey, now neck-deep in her own mess, stood frozen. A voice in the crowd called her disgraceful. Others joined in, tossing harsh words her way. She kept shaking her head, trying to explain herself. But no one listened.

Rylie said nothing. Her eyes stayed sharp and cold. The things Stacey was going through now were no different from what she had once endured. To her, this was only fair.

Deandre swung open the door of his sleek luxury car and gestured for Rylie to hop in. A few steps away,Brad climbed into his simpler ride. Both vehicles rolled out of sight, one right after the other.

A student watching from the sidewalk squinted at the cars and gasped, "Those aren't just fancy. Those cars are limited editions. Nearly ten million apiece."

Another voice chimed in, "That lead car? It's from the Owen family. They're literally the richest in the world.Rylie just left Stacey in the dust. What a climb."

Stacey tried to leave before things got worse. But fate had other plans. She turned too quickly and crashed into a classmate carrying a hot lunch. Soup splattered down her front, drenching her in oily/ broth. The crowd burst into laughter. She let out a loud, humiliated yeIp and ran off with her head down.

From that moment on, whatever was left of her reputation had been stripped away. The girl everyone once envied was now a cautionary tale.


··.

Inside the steakhouse, Rylie sat between Brad and Deandre, the three of them tossing around casual talk about Marcus, Midway through, Deandre remembered something."Oh right. Marcus has a friend in Crolens.He's putting together a solo concert there and wants you to play."
r
Rylie smiled faintly. "I'Il skip it. I'm not that great. Just a hobbyist. I'd rather sit in the crowd."

Deandre nodded after a pause. "Fair enough. I'll pass the word. We'll ask Paola instead. You and I can juISt eat snacks and enjoy the show."

While he spoke, he noticed Brad across the table, quietly slicing his steak with extreme care but not touching any of it. Deandre couldn't hold back. "What's with the tiny cuts? You planning to serve a toddler?"

Brad didn't answer right away. He carved one last bite-sized piece, then calmly pushed the plate toward Rylie and took the one she had nibbled from. The movement was smooth, unfussy, almost practiced.

Rylie blinked at the steak he'd taken. "I've already tasted that one."

Brad gave a shrug. "Doesn't bother me."

Rylie was momentarily at a loss for words.

Deandre leaned forward. "Wait, are you seriously cutting steak for her?"

Brad finally looked himn in the eye. "If a man can't take care of a woman younger than him, then what's the point of being older? You didn't do it. So I stepped in."

Deandre clenched his jaw. "That's not how this is supposed to go." The tension in his voice gave him away.Brad hadn't done anything loud or dramatic. Still, everything about him was getting under Deandre's skin,and he couldn't figure out why

###Chapter 76 Paola's Furtive Behavior


Deandre couldn't explain it, but watching Rylie pick up those perfectly sized steak pieces made him clench his jaw. The frustration didn't vanish, but he held it in.

Without hesitation, Deandre slid part of his steak toward her. "This is mny first go at taking care of someone,Rylie. I'm not some old guy with all the tricks, but I can manage this much. Go on, eat."

Brad paused mid-cut and glanced up. The look he gave Deandre meant that those words were unpleasant.

Deandre met his stare with one of his own. The message came through just as clearly, as if saying that Brad's words weren't any better.

Rylie gave a small shake of her head. "Thanks, Deandre. But this portion's already enough for me."

With no choice left; he retrieved the plate. "Fine. I'll just cut it up for you next time."

She smiled faintly."Okay."

In moments like that, she felt deeply grateful for the people around her.

After the meal, Rylie made her way to HaloFlow Pharmacy by herself. Selah hadn't seen her in a while.As soon as Rylie stepped inside, Selah reached out and held both her hands, checking her from head to toe."You're safe, right? That Wildes group didn't hurt you?"

"I'm fine, Selah," she said. "Is it busy today?"

"Not really. A few regulars came in for meds. Nothing more."

Rylie fell silent for a few seconds before speaking. "Have you ever considered starting a hospital again?Something official? You run a small clinic and treat everyone all by yourself every day. It looks tiring. If you have a hospital, we can recruit excellent doctors and treat more patients, and you won't be this exhausted."

Selah didn't answer at first. Then, after a long pause, she gave a small shake of her head. "Helping people this way is enough for me."

Rylie kept going. "But haven't you wanted to clear your name?" She looked straight at her. "I don't believe you caused anyone's death. There's probably more to what happened."

Selah froze for a moment but stayed quiet on the details. "It's alright. I'm happy with HaloFlow pharmacy."

Sensing that Selah didn't want to revisit the past, Rylie changed her tone. "Maybe we could expand the HaloFlow Pharmacy? We can build some wards and consultation rooms. Some patients want to stay a few nights. It doesn't feel right to send them away."

Selah didn't say yes, but she didn't say no either.

Rylie figured it was a start. Given time, she believed she could help guide Selah back to leading a hospital again.

After finishing dinner with Selah, Rylie made her way back to Serenity Manor.

The moment she stepped inside, she noticed a servant lingering near the hall who immediately darted away at the sight of her.

Curious, Rylie raised a brow and followed the woman's hurried steps, only to catch sight of Paola slipping out of her bedroom.

"What were you doing in my room?"

She had caught her red-handed. The servant turned pale and backed away without saying a word.

Paola was extremely embarrassed but couldn't admit the truth. She fumbled for an excuse. "Last time the servant cleaned your room, they left something that belongs to me behind."

"Oh?" Rylie tilted her head. "And what exactly was left behind?"

Scrambling to maintain her cover, Paola reached into her pocket and pulled out a hairpin.."This!"

Rylie took one glance and gave a half-smile."This?"

Without hesitation, Paola picked it up and brushed past her. "You probably won't believe it, but Marcus gave this to me." She paused halfway down the hall and tossed a glance over her shoulder."And just so you know, he invited me to his solo concert. He's the main act."

Rylie gave her a calm look. "That so? Then explain why you're rummaging through my drawer for sheet music."

Paola's smug expression vanished in an instant. "I have no idea what you're talking about."
<###Chapter 76 Paola's Furtlve Behavior
She turned and walked off without another word.

Rylie returned to her bedroom, thinking back to the hairpin Paola had waved around. That same pin had come from the library. There was no way it ended up here by accident.

After scanning her room, it became clear that someone had dug through her drawer-more than once. It didn't take much guessing to figure out what they were after.

She had written an impromptu piece not long ago. It wasn't finished. And yet, someone had discovered it.

Rylie sat for a moment, staring at the sheet music. To find out if her suspicion was right, she completed the second half, preparing two versions. One was the real score. The other was bait.

If Paola planned to take it and pass it off as her own, then she was walking straight into the consequences.

Once the task was wrapped up, Rylie logged into the dark web and spotted a high-priority message from Britton.

"Boss, our shipment got hit during transport at sea. The cargo vanished. A lot of our people didn't make it."

Without wasting a second, she rang Britton. "I arranged that route myself. Everything was covered. Could this be sabotage?"

Britton took a breath before answering. "Everyone in our ranks is under your chip. If anyone meant to betray us, they would've found a way to disable it. But nothing's happened. And the way this attack went down... It doesn't add up."

She narrowed her eyes. "How so?"

"They didn't even know what they were stealing," said Britton. "They triggered a blast and wiped out half the shipment.Those goods were worth nearly a billion."

Her chest tightened as the words sank in.

"They blew up half of it?"

Britton let out a sigh. "That's the strange part. Most of them died in the explosion, too. The few who survived took off with what little was left. The storm hit hard during all that. Our signal dropped once they got out of range.".

After thinking it over, he offered a plan. "We could use satellite tracking. If I tap into the system, I can lead a

team and reclaim what we lost."

Rylie shut it down immediately. "No. Too many eyes are on me. VitaLink, the Wildes, and the mayor's secretary's collapse-everything's too sensitive. If we hack anything now, it'll lead right back to me."

His voice rose in frustration. "They stole our weapons. And they probably don't even know how to use them.Could it be the buyer's trying to back out? They didn't want to pay, so they orchestrated this attack?"

She waved that off. "I doubt it. Give the team a bonus and tell them to get another batch ready.I'll deal with this quietly."

"Understood. By the way, the World Piano Association reached out. Their chairman said the Music Awards Gala wants you as a guest judge. They're hoping X. Aria shows up."

She gave a short laugh. "They don't care about me. They want that unfinished piano score. They're just using the gala as bait. Turn them down for me. I'm not making time for it."

Britton replied,"Understood."
###Chapter 77 The Special Guest


Rylie spent the next two days holed up in the apartment of the community near the military compound and skipped school. Inside, the room was equipped with full surveilance gear. Her bedroom back at Serenity Manor had already been wired with micro-cameras.

As Rylie had anticipated, once Paola learned that she hadn't been staying at the manor recently, the surveillance cameras caught Paola sneaking into her bedroom.

Rylie had set out two decoy music sheets in advance. One lay openly on the table. Paola gave it a quick look, dismissed it as gibberish, and began rifling through the drawers instead.

Before long, Paola uncovered the second sheet Rylie had forged using a piano workbook. Her excitement gave her away. She snapped photos and hurried out, convinced she'd found something real.

From her end of the surveillance feed, Rylie watched the whole act unfold. Her grin kept growing. That woman really was a joke. And yet people actually thought she was some kind of prodigy? The next Marcus,really?

Rylie brushed off the moment and turned back to her screen. She began working through intel from sea routes. Her fingers darted across the keyboard, breaking through a firewall and slipping into pirate camp servers that posed a risk to her shipping lanes.

After days of combing through logs, she ruled out the pirates as the ones behind it. Just then, her phone buzzed on the table. She stretched and glanced at the screen.

Marcus was calling.

"Rylie, the concert's starting. Are you coming? I reserved a VIP seat for you. Deandre mentioned you liked snacks, so I had some set aside at your spot."

She checked the clock. If he hadn't called, she might've missed it completely."I'm on my way.What about Deandre? He didn't say anything. Isn't he going?"

"He had a situation last night. He's alright, but he's got a few things to handle. He won't be there today."

"Alright, got it," said Rylie.
After the call, she opened her private messages. They came from the protection unit she'd sent to keep an eye on Deandre.

"Two separate groups planted bombs in his car last night. It exploded en route, but he's unharmed. We neutralized the hit squad and kept two alive for questioning. Based on what they said, this mafia conflict around him is getting worse. Everyone is trying to eliminate him and take the position as the mafia head."

Every one of the guards watching over Deandre had been chosen by her. Each of them could handle ten opponents without breaking a sweat. So she wasn't worried.

After reading through the report, she pulled on a jacket, swapped into a pair of jeans, grabbed her keys, and left the apartment on her motorcycle.


...

Marcus' solo concerts never had empty seats. They drew in society's upper crust, along with celebrities who didn't mind paying extra just to attend.

Among the guests were familiar faces from charity events-people who had heard whispers that Rylie was the long-lost daughter of the Owen family.

She arrived late. Arms trade business had held her up until the last minute. She slipped through the VIP entrance without a fuss, quietly scanning for her seat.

Across the aisle, a group of well-dressed women and their daughters caught sight of her. One of them,Isabella, raised her voice in a mocking tone. "Isn't that the girl who just returned to the Owen family? What's she doing showing up now? Did she get lost on the way in?"

Baila Torres stifled a giggle behind her hand. "I heard she spent her whole life doing whatever she wanted.The Kirks never bothered with extracurricular classes. She only cared about food, fun, and parties. Can she even follow classical music? Does she know what Marcus is playing?"

Hallie Thorpe put on a smug face and sighed. "Some people don't change. Even if they come from money,they still carry the scent of the countryside. Paola, on the other hand, has real talent. She's performing tonight."

Rylie glanced at them, unfazed. Without saying a word, she headed straight for the seat in the center of the front row-the Owen family's private section.

She had just settled in when Paola walked over, all smiles and sweetness, and said in a chirpy voice,"Rylie,why are you sitting there? That seat is reserved for one of Marcus' special guests. Yours should be further back."

Paola wanted to put her on the spot and make her look clueless in front of everyone.

Rylie didn't move. She tilted her head and asked, "What special guest?"

In truth, Paola didn't know either. She had overheard Marcus inviting a guest while passing by his piano room and later volunteered herself, hoping to be a guest at his concert.

Still, any guest Marcus personally invited would belong to the top tier of the music world. Performing with someone of his status could set a career in motion.

With a look of forced patience, Paola added, "Marcus said he invited a close friend, and this seat is theirs.lf you really want the front row that badly, we can trade. I'll be backstage soon anyway."

Rylie's fingers tapped gently on the armrest. A faint smile curled at the edge of her lips. "If it's meant for his guest, then this is exactly where I should be sitting."

###Chapter 78 Brad Always Saves Her Day


Paola's eyes flickered at Rylie's words. A question formed in her mind-had Marcus really invited Rylie as a special guest?

Isabella snapped, "Alright, Miss Owen, we all remember how you caused a scene at the last auction. I'll admit you've got some taste, but Marcus only invites top-tier musicians. Are you one of them?"

Rylie smirked."I could be."

Isabella rolled her eyes and scoffed. "I studied music formally. I know all the top musicians, except for the mysterious X. Aria. And you, Miss Owen-I've never heard of."

Paola quietly agreed. X. Aria had lived abroad for years and was known only through his music. It didn't seem likely Rylie had any ties to someone like that.

Paola didn't doubt Rylie had some talent, but as a special guest? That was hard to believe.

She lowered her gaze and said softly, "Rylie, today is Marcus' solo concert. I want everything to go perfectly,please."

The people nearby began to look at Rylie with disapproval. Baila frowned. "Miss Owen, Paola is your cousin,so maybe you think you can push her around. But today isn't the day. Don't embarrass the Owen family."

Rylie nodded."Alright."

She stood, then glanced around. "But if I don't sit in front, I won't have a seat at all."

Paola smiled gently. "Then take mine. I'll stand beside you."

Isabella muttered under her breath, "So Marcus didn't even give her a ticket? She's in the standing area."

Baila added, "Not every Owen likes this girl who suddenly popped up. She's nowhere near Paola's level."

Another woman chimed in, "Paola is also a guest of Marcus. She can't be standing at the back-what does that look like? Since Rylie has a standing ticket, she should stand. She's still an Owen, after all. How can she take someone else's seat?"

Rylie had seen through these little tricks before-with Stacey, with others. Back then, she'd sayed quiet for the sake of family, and it only made things worse. She wasn't going to make the same mistake twice.

Just as she reached for her phone to call Marcus over to deal with them, a deep, lazy voice interrupted."Sorry I'm late."

The voice was familiar. She turned, stunned, as the spotlight caught a tall figure walking in. Brad's once pale skin now glowed with health. His sharp features, high nose bridge, and that faint smile made him stand out effortlessly.

He walked straight toward her. "Why didn't you sit? You got here before me." He sat down on the VIP sofa next to her and looked up with a light smile. Then he scooted to one side and patted the narrow space left."What are you standing for? I bought a standing ticket. Don't tell me you're going back on your word and won't let me sit."

Gasps followed.The women stared in disbelief. Had Rylie bought the VIP seat-and Brad was just tagging along?

Rylie hesitated but eventually sat down in the small space he had made for her.

The sight of them sitting shoulder to shoulder shifted the mood entirely.

Confused looks circled the room. Wasn't this Brad- the naval hero? The admiral who rose to the top by thirty? Head of a powerful family? Yet here he was, sitting beside Rylie so casually... Amost intimately.

Paola's heart clenched. Her fingers gripped her dress tightly, though her face remained calm.

"So you did have a seat, Rylie," Paola said with a strained smile. "Why didn't you say something?|misunderstood. Everyone, please sit. The concert's about to begin."

The ladies kept quiet, but their eyes couldn't help drifting back to Brad.

The single VIP seat wasn't spacious, so their arms and shoulders brushed together. The faint cedar scent from Brad, laced with a bit of medicine, mixed with his body's warmth, making Rylie stiffen slightly.

Brad leaned in with a teasing tone. "Dr. Owen, nervous? I thought you didn't care about my body. But it seems you quite like the way I look dressed."

His voice was low, and she felt the vibration through his chest as it reached her shoulder- soft and strangely electric.
Rylie adjusted her position, and her knee brushed his.

Brad chuckled and suddenly placed a hand on her waist. "Stop moving. You're about to push me off the seat."

His touch was warm, steady- and left her no room to escape.

All eyes were locked on them now, especially Paola, whose expression twisted slightly, like she'd just tasted something bitter. Who would've thought the usually cold Brad could be this close with Rylie?

Rylie didn't pull away. Once she was settled, she replied lightly, "No wonder Deandre calls you a flirt.I see it now for myself."
###Chapter 79 What A Stupid Director


Brad lifted a brow and gave Rylie a smug grin. "No thank-you for me?"

"I don't need your help," she replied. Rylie turned toward him, their heads nearly brushing. The narrow space between them felt charged, like a held breath waiting to break.

As their eyes locked, Brad's breath hitched. "Alright then. I'm only here because Deandre asked me to watch over you."

Rylie remembered she had been an adult for quite some time now, and Brad's words sounded like an excuse. Deandre clearly didn't want Brad to have much contact with her.

Not seeing the point in dragging out the exchange, she let it drop. The house lights had dimmed already, so she eased into the cushions, letting the hush of the room settle in. Faint whispers came from the row behind her.

A man's voice carried behind her seat, easy to catch in the quiet. "Paola's got serious talent. The revision I requested is almost complete. She's debuting the piece tonight."

The man he was talking to lowered his voice. "Isn't that the composition you're saving for your next film?Spencer,you're really going to release it early?"

Spencer nodded and replied, "It was her suggestion. She's doing it for me, really. Marcus is known across the world. I'm stilllocal. She thought this concert would be a good chance to give my work some exposure."

His companion spoke with a nod in his tone. "Paola has both charm and skill. She's quite the package."

Rylie picked up every word. Her hearing had always been sharp, and nothing about the exchange escaped her.

She turned around and looked straight at Spencer. "You're right, sir. My cousin works on her music in the study at home. I've seen the pages piling up with edits. She's really put the effort in."

Spencer stared at her for a beat, trying to place her, then recognition clicked."Ah.Miss Owen."

He'd been there during the earlier incident. He hadn't warmed up to her since, so his response came out tight.

Rylie kept her expression pleasant. "She stays up late some nights. I've seen her go over the same piece again and again, just to meet your expectations, Mr. Aguilar."

Spencer's expression softened slightly. He gave a slow nod. "Yes, the final version was pieced together in the library. That's where I found it."

He paused, then added, "It turned out nothing like the original draft. The shift in style was dramatic. It really does show she might carry Marcus' legacy forward."

Rylie tilted her head and smiled faintly.that right? So you must've heard the piano but dídn't actually see who was playing it."

Spencer tilted hishead,clearly puzzled."Why would you say something like that?"

Rylie offered a light reply. it's nothing serious. I just think you've got a sharp ear, Mr. Aguilar.Maybe next time, you could hear me play."

She didn't say the rest out loud. In truth, she believed he lacked the discernment to read between the lines.For someone like him, the deeper truths stayed hidden.

Spencer took her words as a gentle nudge. He assumed she was hinting at composing for his film.Wanting to avoid any commitment, he gave a polite refusal. "I've been swamped lately, but maybe in the future."

Rylie gave a nod and kept her smile small. "Alright."

Anyone who understood music could tell from Paola's discarded drafts that her skills had limits. Even so,Spencer remained convinced that the sudden shift in her compositions came from her brilliance.

Rylie quietly wondered how he'd react once the truth came out.

Brad said nothing the whole time. He kept his gaze on Rylie, noticing the way her lips curved just slightly and how her eyes sparkled with something sly. There was a playfulness in her, the kind that hid its claws.①

He had finally figured her out. Rylie always wore a soft expression when she was laying a trap. She made people feel safe, just long enough to strike when it counted.

Meanwhile, Marcus stepped into the light. His coat was deep purple, his short hair neatly styled. He looked every bit the refined artist. Calm.Poised. Confident.

He began speaking, and the room stilled. His words, paired with his gentle air, pulled in every woman seated nearby.

His gaze swept toward the VIP section. "Lately, there's been a lot to celebrate in our home. One joy stands out- a treasure | thought I'd lost. She's here with us tonight. She gave me the spark to write this next piece. I hope it speaks to you."

A quiet stir passed through the crowd, especially among the women. Many turned their heads, their eyes landing on Paola. Some did it without thinking. Others meant to. Isabella leaned in and whispered, a little too loudly, "Marcus really does favor Paola. He invites her to perform, then calls her a treasure in front of everyone."

Paola tried to wave her off. "Stop, Isabella. He never said that to me. Maybe he was talking about the other guests. Maybe even Rylie."

Isabella giggled and nudged her."Come on. We all know how modest you are. Fine, just let him do the bragging."

Paola smiled, saying nothing more. She soaked in the stares, her cheeks glowing as eyes flicked toward her from all directions. Tonight, she was the only woman who would be performing on stage. The rest didn't matter. Not Rylie's stunts. Not anything else. She was born to be at the center. No one could outshine her.

Just as she basked in the illusion, a sharp screech tore through the auditorium from Marcus' microphone.

###Chapter 80 Stepped Into The Trap


Marcus caught sight of something that startled him, and he almost let the microphone slip from his hand.The sharp sound that followed drew everyone's attention. He no longer wore the calm look of a composed gentleman. Instead, his face had darkened.

"Who told you to sit beside that man?" said Marcus, voice clipped.

His eyes met Rylie's, catching her off guard. She blinked slowly and said, "Paola told me that seat was meant for your guest, so she wouldn't let me sit there."

Her voice remained quiet, but Marcus had sharp hearing. He didn't miss a word.

He faced the crowd and spoke straight into the mic. "That seat is yours. You are the guest I invited. I left a box of snacks beside the sofa just for you. Go back. Don't sit with any man."

Though his tone wasn't exactly harsh, his meaning was clear. The crowd picked up on it right away. His jealousy wasn't fiery. It sounded more like the scolding of an older brother who spoiled his sibling.

Rylie didn't argue. She stood, left Brad's side, and made her way to the sofa that Marcus had pointed out.

She sat down and opened the small box beside her. Inside were a few slices of cake and an assortment of juices.

When Marcus saw her back in the seat he'd chosen for her, his expression eased. He gave a soft laugh and said, "My sister always finds a way to stir things up. I hope she didn't bother anyone too much."

He adjusted his bow tie and returned to the piano."Let's begin."

The music that followed was beautiful, but the women who had mocked Rylie earlier didn't hear a single note.

Word of what had happened had already spread through the room. The whole exchange had been seen by too many, and now it was clear. Those elegant young women had formed a circle with the intent to isolate Rylie.

"I was this close to scolding Rylie. I thought she stole the seat,"someone whispered. "Turns out Paola made a mistake from the beginning."

Another voice followed. "She jumped in without even asking what was going on."

From the back, a fan of Brad's chimed in, "So the seat was indeed for him. He just helped her out by saying it belongs to her. He's such a gentleman."

Paola's expression had gone pale, though she stayed mostly in the shadows. She spoke softly. "I didn't know there'd be such a mix-up. No one told me Rylie was the guest Marcus mentioned. I truly misunderstood."

Isabella stepped in, quick to defend her. "How was that a misunderstanding? Rylie should have explained herself properly."

One woman muttered, "You didn't even give Rylie a chance. You all jumped in like you knew everything."Another voice joined in, firm but calm. Fiona had been silent until now. She had always felt unsure of Rylie's place in the Owen family, but things had changed. The way all three brothers treated her made it obvious.

Isabella snapped her head around. "So now you're defending her?"

Paola, too, was surprised that Fiona, who had always been close to her, suddenly defended Rylie. Shebit her lip and said pitifully, "Alright, Isabella, let's not argue, okay? Let's not miss Marcus' solo."

The room settled once more. Rylie glanced toward Fiona, her face unreadable. Fiona returned the look with a warm smile.

Rylie gave a nod and turned her attention back to the music.

Marcus' playing was something she held in high regard. The piece he composed just for her fell over the hall like soft moonlight. Each note carried the feeling of something precious returned. The crowd below was equally spellbound.

When the final note faded, the audience burst into thunderous applause.

Marcus glanced toward her, his expression filled with quiet warmth. Her heart stirred at the sight, and her lips curved in response.

He returned to the keys and played several familiar pieces, carrying the concert toward the break.

As the music paused, Marcus stepped forward. Thelights shifted, casting a glow over Paola. He extended a hand to her and said, "My cousin will be performing her newest piece during the intermission."
From the back, Spencer clapped his hands and whispered,"It's finally here."

Paola raised her gown slightly and passed by Rylie like a crowned royal. The light she carried brushed over Rylie before pulling away.

She took Marcus' hand and stepped up with ease, offering a graceful bow. Her poise and beauty drew quiet admiration from those watching.

"She really looks like someone born for this. The rest can't compare," someone whispered.

Lifting her skirt, Paola turned to the crowd and greeted them. As the clapping died down, she began to speak. "Tonight's piece is the theme for Director Spencer Aguilar's upcoming film, Twilight Horizon. Being able to debut it here at Marcus' recital is a tremendous privilege. Director Aguilar holds hismusic to the highest standard. Each note is refined to near perfection..."

Her eyes drifted to Marcus as she continued, "Still, my greatest thanks go to my cousin, Marcus. He taught me from an early age that true music must come from within."

She gave a playful wink. "I may not be on his level, but standing here tonight is already more than enough."

Her speech left no room for reproach. She praised the film, complimented Spencer, and reminded everyone of her ties to Marcus-all with one performance.

Rylie leaned to one side, resting her chin on her hand. As soon as Paola struck the first note, her gaze sharpened.Her lips lifted into a smirk. This fool had stepped into the trap with both feet. And now she had the gall to perform stolen music in front of all these people.

While the piece continued, Rylie tapped her fingers lightly against the armrest. When the third measure came,she froze. This was it.

 
###Chapter 81 A Born Genius


Paola's hands stalled briefly on the keys. She had drilled this transition over and over, but the tonal shift still gave her trouble. Luckily, her long familiarity with the piano helped her smooth over the slip. To the crowd,nothing seemed off.

Backstage, Marcus narrowed his eyes. With a low voice, he turned to Marlon Swain and asked,this what she wrote for Spencer?" His tone was quiet, but his doubt came through clearly. "It doesn't sound like her."

Marlon, a skilled musician himself, shared more than just a work relationship with Marcus. Most days, when Paola had questions, she reached out through email. It was Marlon who usually replied.

"I've heard most of her work," said Marlon. "This one's better than her usual, sure. But after the third section, it loses structure. Spencer's a director, not a composer. He might not notice the flaws, but they're there."

"You, too, think it needs fixing?" asked Marcus.

"Definitely.The second half feels incomplete," Marlon replied. "It still reads like a rough draft."

Great minds often shared the same view.

Paola brought the piece to a close with practiced ease, then rose with poise and gave a polished bow.

The crowd responded with loud applause.

She gave a playful wink and said, "Thanks to Marcus for the chance to play, and to Mr. Aguilar for letting me compose. And of course, thank you all for your support."

She flashed another smile. "If you liked it, feel free to follow me online. I'll be reading your feedback and making changes."

The purpose couldn't be more obvious-she wanted fame and popularity.

Rylie, who had sat silently the entire time, slowly raised her hand. "Paola," she said, "I think there's still room for improvement.".

The air turned heavy. Nobody expected her to speak. What nerve-to say that now?

Paola blinked,clearly thrown off."Wh-what did you say?"

Still wearing an innocent expression, Rylie said, "The piece wasn't quite right."

"Rylie!" snapped Isabella. "Do you have any idea where you are? Why would you say something like that during Mr. Owen's recital? There's no way Paola played it wrong."

Rylie tilted her head slightly. "But didn't she say she welcomes feedback? I'm only pointing out what I heard.Why get so defensive?"

Something in Paola's chest clenched. She couldn't let Rylie take the stage - not now. That would be disastrous.

Trying to brush it off, she stepped to the edge of the platform and forced a light tone."Rylie, you're joking,right? This piece has already passed through Mr. Aguilar and others-"

"Oh really?" Rylie turned to Spencer with an innocent look. "Mr. Aguilar, do you think this piece is perfect too?"

Spencer didn't speak right away. As a director, not a musician, he thought the piece suited his film well enough and might even earn awards. Still, not wanting to say the wrong thing, he muttered,"Well-music is subjective."

"Mind if I give it a shot?" Rylie rose to her feet. All eyes followed her as she strolled toward the piano."P'll just play a short part," she added casually.

Paola's breath hitched. Her hand shot out in reflex. "Rylie! This isn't the time or place... Please don't-"

Marcus! voice cut in before she could finish. "Let her play. She's my guest. Nothing about this is disruptive."He wasn't loud, but the way he spoke silenced the room.

He fixed his eyes on Paola's pale face for a moment, then his tone softened. "This is a free concert. I treat everyone here as friends. And among friends, we should be able to talk about music openly. That's the point,isn't it?"

That single moment broke the image Paola had worked so hard to maintain- the favorite cousin, the chosen performer.

Fiona watched with delight, muttering, "There's a clear difference in how he treats family."
 Someone in the back called out, "Let's hear Miss Owen play!"

Isabella scowled. "She's been with the Kirks her whole life and never touched a piano. She's going to embarrass herself."

Fiona shook her head. "Then why would she go up there? I believe she knows what she's doing."

Rylie, dressed casually, presented a stark contrast to Paola's elegance. Yet, when the spotlight hit her, the audience was captivated by her beauty, making the men blush andtheir hearts race.

She had the Owen looks, more striking than her brothers. And compared to Paola's practiced poise, her presence felt unforced-strong in a way that didn't try too hard.

She pushed up her sleeves, her wrist delicate and bare. The audience hushed as her fingers hovered over the keys.

"This is what I think it's supposed to sound like,"she said.

Her hands began to move. The same melody filled the hall, but now it breathed.

Every note flowed effortlessly. What had been stiff under Paola's hands now soared.

Then she hit the third part. Without pausing, Rylie wove in a new phrase - smooth, seamless. What had been jagged was now whole. The shift felt like moonlight trickling over still water.

A voice rose from the back. "My goodness..." Marlon shot to his feet. "That transition was flawless! And I heard people say she didn't study piano?" he said, shaking his head in awe. "This is the kind of skill someone develops young."

Marcus looked on with pride. "When I first met her, I knew she had talent. I checked. The Kirks never gave her lessons. Everything she knows, she taught herself."

Marlon's eyes widened. "Like you? She's a born genius. The Kirks never saw what they had. Now their ignorance is on full display."

Rylie had performed the complete "Twilight Horizon." Paola's version, in comparison, had been a haphazard blend of mismatched parts.
###Chapter 82 Rylie's Perfect Prediction And Planning


At first, the audience had been charmed by Paola's performance. But after they heard Rylie's version,murmurs spread through the crowd as more discerning ears began to notice the difference.

"The gap is staggering. You can tell the pieces aren't the same at all. She nailed every pause and shift.Rylie's performance felt alive."

"Paola's version sounds like a watered-down copy."

"No wonder it didn't sit right with me earlier."

Spencer stopped caring about how this would affect Paola's image. He slapped the armrest in excitement."That's it! That's the spark l've been looking for! No wonder something felt off. This version is exactly what the scene needs!"

The moment the final note vanished into the air, the room fell silent. Then applause thundered through the hall.

Rylie stood with quiet poise. She leaned toward Paola and whispered softly, "When you took my sheet music, you didn't realize I had made subtle changes. You didn't even know what you were copying." She tilted her head. "And you still have the nerve to call yourself a musician."

Her voice stayed low. The exchange stayed between them. But Paola's face turned ghostly. Her hands shook. The truth hit her like a wave. All her careful preparation had just been ripped apart by Rylie. Her big moment was ruined.

Trying not to fall apart, Paola forced a tight smile. She held the microphone and tried to sound composed."Rylie, I must say-your playing was wonderful. Truly impressive." She paused. "But may l ask-why did you play the original version | wrote?"

Her tone changed. She was trying to claw back whatever pride she had left.r. Aguilar's film hasn't come out yet. That piece wasn't supposed to be heard in full. I made slight changes so the full version wouldn't leak.How did you.know how it was meant to sound?"

Rylie's brow lifted. She was taken aback that Paola stilI had the gall to push the blame in her direction.

Marcus' brows drew together as he stared at Paola. Her remarks hinted that Rylie had stolen the music she'd just performed. That didn't sit well with him.

He was about to speak up when Rylie took the microphone from Paola. She gave a faint smile and turned to Spencer. "So, that's how it is? If what Paola said is true, she must have given you the final version? Then why did you look so surprised just now?"

Spencer didn't know what to say. The version Paola had submitted was the same one she had played earlier -Paola hadn't made any adjustments. They had finalized it weeks ago. Now that she suddenly changed her story, it made the whole thing suspicious.

Should he defend her? His name had already been tied to Paola's arrangement. If she were exposed to have copied someone else's work or been dishonest, that could damage his film. Audiences were picky. A single scandal could ruin everything.

After a quick mental calculation, Spencer made his decision. He was going to say that he was unaware when Paola suddenly interjected, "I haven't informed Mr. Aguilar yet. This was mainly for promotional purposes."

Rylie gave a soft laugh that peeled away whatever pride Paola had left. "You really didn't think this through.If you're going to steal, at least check for cameras first."

She reached into her pocket, pulled out her phone, and handed it to her cousin. She kept her voice low."Have a look. Can you explain what you're doing in my bedroom?"

Paola stared at the screen. The footage was clear. The camera had caught her lifting the music, and even the notes on the sheet could be seen.

Her face twisted in panic. "Rylie, are you insane? You actually installed a camera in your own room?"

Who would do such a thing? Rylie would. She always went against expectations.

With a flick of her fingers, she tucked her hair behind one ear and smiled. "It's my room. I can put in whatever | want."

The two stood far from the crowd, speaking in hushed tones. The microphones remained untouched, but anyone watching could tell something was wrong. Paola's eyes were wide. Her lips trembled. It was clear they were arguing.

Marcus noticed the shift in the room and walked toward them. Rylie handed him the phone. He glanced at the screen. After a few seconds, he turned to Paola. "So that's why the music sounded off. You copied her work and blamed her?"

Paola's breath caught. She tried to recover, but her voice quivered. "Please, Marcus, let's talk about this later. Don't tell them. Please. I didn't mean to... Just don't let the audience find out. I'Il explain everything."

If that video got out, she wouldn't recover from it. Her image would shatter.

Marcus didn't respond right away. He turned to his sister. "Rylie, what do you want to do?"

Rylie gave a quiet smile. "This is a family matter. If we handle it here, it'll only bring shame to us. Let's take care of it later, as she asked. Could you tell the guests something to settle the room?"

He nodded slowly, moved by how patient she remained. "You must have been like this when living with the Kirks. That's why they always walked all over you," he said.

Rylie tilted her head, the smile on her face carrying weight. "I didn't stay quiet this time. I did call her out,didn't l? This might not have been laid out piece by piece, but anyone with sense should know what happened here tonight."

Marcus, who wasn't easily fooled, caught on quickly to what she meant.

He turned to the audience and spoke with grace. "Everyone, I apologize for the interruption. What happened was just a family matter. I'll personally discuss the arrangement with Mr.Aguilar."

With a formal bow, he added, "Now, please let me present the final piece."

A hush settled over the room, thick with unease. Marcus had offered a way forward, but even so, it was clear to all what he had truly meant.

Off to the side, Paola stood motionless. Her gown clung to her skin, soaked with sweat. She noticed the glances from the crowd and briefly considered pretending to faint.

Before she could make her move, Rylie stepped in. She placed a steady hand on her waist. "You'd better not fall, Paola. It would be such a shame if you hurt that face."

That comment alone was enough to jolt her upright. Paola held her posture, though her hands trembled at her sides.

Spencer exited the room in a rush. His jaw was tight as he muttered into his phone, "Pull the theme song right now. I don't care. It's the one Paola gave us."

Rylie walked back to her seat with calm steps. As she passed Brad, his voice rose just loud enough for her to hear. "You're really going to let her get away with it?"

She kept her eyes forward but answered smoothly, "Of course not." Her voice dropped low. "Take a look around. Everyone's recording. These days, there's no such thing as keeping a family matter private."

###Chapter 83 Paola's Collapse


Someone from the crowd had already posted the scandal online before the lights even dimmed. The headline was loud and clear. "Marcus Concert Disaster: Paola Garrett Plagiarism Scandal."

Brad laughed under his breath. "You sly little fox."

Rylie glanced at him but didn't argue. She knew foxes had a reputation for being clever. She accepted the name without protest.

As the event wound down, Brad took a phone call. His mnood shifted, and he stepped out before the rest.

Rylie stayed until the last note faded, then left the hall with Marcus for dinner.

Before she reached the exit, Spencer's voice called from behind. "Miss Owen, could you hold on a second?"

She turned around, smiling. "What is it?"

He hesitated. "Would you mind if we talked in private?"

She lifted a brow. "Alright."

They moved to Marcus' lounge. Once they were alone, Spencer spoke sincerely, his earlier judgments pushed aside. "Miss Owen, that composition... It was really yours, wasn't it? I heard the piano in the library.It had to be you."

Rylie sank into the sofa and answered with ease, "Yes, I played it."

Things started falling into place for him. He had followed the music to the library, expecting to find Paola,but saw no one. They only ran into each other later in the reception hall. Now it all made sense. The person who was playing the piano at that time was Rylie.

He straightened in his seat. "We truly loved that piece. Would you consider selling the rights? It would be perfect for my film."

Rylie thought about it before answering, "I can't take full credit. The opening few bars came from Paola's discarded notes. I noticed them on her desk and finished the piece based on those."

She gave a knowing smile. "It could work as a shared composition. Paola sparked the idea, but | turned it into something complete. Her mistake was trying to pass it off as hers."

Spencer leaned forward slightly, unsure. "So... what are you saying?"

She kept her tone calm. "I don't mind a collaboration. Ask Paola if she's open to co-composing."

Spencer paused for a moment, then let out a quiet sigh. "Looks like I was wrong about you. I'm sorry for how I judged you earlier." He offered his hand. "I doubt Paola will object. I'll get the contract drafted and send it over soon. Looking forward to our ongoing collaboration."

Rylie rose from her seat and shook his hand. "I'm looking forward to it too."

Meanwhile, Paola had just stepped out of the restroom, hoping to explain herself. As she neared Marcus'lounge, she noticed the door left slightly open. Inside, she saw Rylie and Spencer shaking hands. The words "looking forward to our ongoing collaboration" echoed in her ears, making her legs feel like jelly.

She pushed the door open and burst in, her voice high with disbelief. "Mr. Aguilar! How could you do this to me?!"

Both turned to face her. Her eyes were red, her makeup streaked from tears, and her breathing unsteady.

"I poured nights into that music. You told me this was my shot!" Her hand shot out toward Rylie. "And now you want to team up with her? That melody was mine! She built that piece from my ideas! Doesn't that make her a thief too?!"

Rylie lifted a brow, the corner of her lips curling. She didn't respond right away

Spencer frowned and said, "Paola, you've misunderstood..."

The noise reached Marcus, who arrived in time to catch the scene. "What's all the shouting for?"

Paola turned to him, distraught. "Even you think I'm in the wrong? Just because she's family? You're letting her get away with stealing my work! Do I mean nothing to you? How can you be so unfair?"

For a moment, the lounge fell completely silent. Rylie stood up and slowly approached her, gently brushing a tear off Paola's cheek.

"You poor thing," she said, her voice soft. "Mr. Aguilar's here to talk about co-authorship."

Paola blinked, stunned."Wh...what?"
Spencer handed her a tissue. "Yes. Miss Owen suggested that the piece be credited to both of you. She even said the first few bars came from your early drafts. There's no plagiarism involved."

Marcus' expression turned icy. He faced Paola with no trace of warmth left. "Rylie would never stoop to your level. Even when she's wrong, she doesn't go out of her way to drag others down." His voice stayed flat, but his words hit hard. "You say I'm being unfair? Maybe I am. That girl spent two decades out there, getting nothing from me. Not a single thing. But you? Paola, did we ever deny you anything? We gave you everything, and still, you chose to act like this."

Paola's hands trembled slightly as she came to her senses. Her voice softened as she said, "I'm sorry,Marcus. I let my fear cloud my judgment. I didn't want to lose face in front of everyone. I thought if I missed this chance to work with Mr. Aguilar, I wouldn't get another."

Marcus didn't soften. "You're afraid now? What about when you crept into Rylie's room to take what didn't belong to you? Were you afraid of being caught then?" He then pulled Rylie close, shielding her from further shame and turning back to Paola. "You've let me down. Clearly, the Owen family failed to teach you restraint. You'd better go back to your own family with your mother. Maybe the Garretts can knock some sense into you."

Paola stood frozen. The idea of returning to her birth family struck her like lightning. That would mean severing ties with the Owen family!

Her breath hitched as realization sank in. "Marcus, please. I was wrong! I swear I would remember this lesson and never make the same mistake!"

But Marcus didn't turn back. He walked out of the lounge beside Rylie, leaving behind a silence that spoke volumes. Spencer said nothing, but the way his eyes followed Rylie said more than words ever could.

Paola dropped onto the nearby couch, mind spinning with fear and shame. Her phone buzzed. Laurel's name flashed across the screen. She answered through broken sobs.

"Where are you?" Laurel asked,alarmed.

Paola couldn't hold it in. Her voice cracked as she wailed, "Mom... please help me!"
###Chapter 84 Playing The Victim


When Laurel stepped into the room, she found Paola in pieces. Her daughter was sobbing so hard that she could barely breathe. Paola had never stumbled like this before. Life had always unfolded in her favor. But with Rylie around for only a few days, everything had unraveled. Her world was already coming apart.

Laurel wrapped an arm around her trembling shoulders and whispered, her voice heavy with fury, "I never imagined that girl could dig so deep without us noticing."

Sniffling, Paola struggled to speak. "Marcus wants to send us back to the Garretts. What are we going to do,Mother?"

Laurel scowled. "You brought this on yourself. How many times have I told you? If it's something money can fix, you don't do it with your own hands. And yet you went into her room and took her things." Her voice hardened. "Did I raise a fool? What happened to everything I taught you?"

Paola flinched at the scolding. Her tears wouldn't stop."It's over. She's going to release that video. I know she will."

Laurel scoffed, "Even if she keeps it to herself, do you really think no one will catch on? You passed someone else's work off as your own." She glared. "Those women were never your friends. They flattered you because of your connection to the Owen family. Now that something's wrong, they'll tear you apart without a second thought."

"I'm finished," Paola whispered, barely audible.

Laurel straightened her spine. "Don't you collapse on me. I won't let you drag yourself into the mud. We are not leaving this family, not until you marry someone with power. I'll handle this."

For the first time in hours, Paola saw something other than despair. "Then what do l do?"

Later that evening, Rylie returned to the Owens' estate. Just as she sat at the table, a servant rushed in, his face pale.

"Something serious has happened! Miss Garrett cut her wrists. It was a suicide attempt!"

Everyone froze. No one touched their food. Kendrick was the first to break the silence. "What made her do something so extreme?"

Marcus hadn't spoken about it earlier, but with the news now out, he had no choice. "This has nothing to do with Rylie. Paola brought it on herself."

Kendrick's eyes darkened. He dropped his utensils with a heavy clatter. "Unbelievable. All that over a stolen piece of music? That's shameful."

His wife leaned forward, her brow creased. "Did she survive?"

"She's in the hospital," said the servant. "Still in danger."

Rylie lowered her head slightly. Her fingers tapped the table as she said quietly,"She went too far."

Marcus looked at her steadily. "What do you intend to do?"

Rylie gave a faint nod. "Since this all started with me, I'll go see her."

Then she rose and turned to Kendrick. "Grandfather, leave this to me."

Kendrick gave it a moment's thouight before offering a nod. "Handle it properly. Don't give outsiders a reason to sneer."

At the hospital, Rylie stepped into the room and found every Garrett already present. Laurel sat close to Paola, her eyes red and swollen from crying. The second they noticed someone at the door, the air shifted.Even Laurel's sobs fell silent for a beat.

She had assumed Kendrick would bring more of the Owens to the hospital due to the family ties.It had never crossed her mind that Rylie would be the only one sent.

Laurel clenched her fists, but the real objective tonight was Rylie. Whether the rest came or not didn't matter.

Laurel stood up and faced her. "Rylie, this happened because I failed to raise my daughter right. I'm sorry for the trouble."

Paola stirred on the bed. Her face looked pale, and her bandaged wrist left streaks of red across the blanket. Moving slowly, she slipped off the bed and lowered herself onto her knees.

"I was wrong, Rylie. I really am."

Rylie gave her a cold look. "Wrong about what?"

Paola swallowed her sobs. Her voice trembled. "I had no right to use your composition. I won't ask you to forgive me. Just please don't drag my family into this. They didn't do anything."

Rylie replied evenly, "I never intended to go after your family. I've already talked to Spencer.He knows you inspired the piece, and we're both listed as composers. Your reputation is safe."

Not long after, Percy burst into the room. His face was dripping with sweat, and his gym clothes clung to him. He must've run straight from training.

He stopped when he saw Paola kneeling, her arm bandaged in red-soaked gauze. Rylie stood in front of her,calm and unreadable.

He rushed forward in a fury and pulled Paola into his arms. "Rylie! What more do you want-her dead?" His shout echoed through the room.

Laurel quickly stepped in and grabbed his arm, crying out, "Stop it, Percy. Rylie's not the one who hurt Paola. She brought this on herself."

Percy scowled, his voice laced with venom. "Since you came back, it's been nothing but disaster.If my sister dies because of you, I swear l'Il make you pay for it!"

Rylie didn't blink. Her gaze stayed steady on him. "Why are you talking as ifI bullied her? Isn't it she who broke into my room? Isn't it she who tooka private piece of music and claimed it for herself? And now she is playing the victim by committing suicide?"

Her eyes shifted to Paola, who still sat slumped on the floor. "Your poor acting might fool others, buta medical student. That bandage is tied wrong. And the blood on it? It's from blood plasma, not your bleeding,right?"

Paola's face turned pale. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

Rylie pulled out a chair and took a seat. Her expression lost all softness. "That concert was a warning. You live off the main Owen family. You'd do well to remember your place. If not, I'll step in for Grandfather myself -and I won't be as gentle next time."

###Chapter 85 Lauurel Takes Action


Laurel could no longer keep up appearances. Being threatened by someone younger, even without an audience, bruised her pride.

She nearly snapped back but stopped herself. After a moment, she lowered her head. "I didn't realize your grandfather had already handed over the family's authority. You're right. This is on us. I failed to raise my daughter properly. I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive us."

"Mom!" Percy's voice trembled with disbelief. Watching his mother bow her head to Rylie filled him with dread.He nearly lunged forward, but Laurel tightened her grip on his wrist.

"Percy! Control yourself," she hissed. Her hand shot to his neck. "Apologize!"

His pride stung, but under her stern gaze, Percy clenched his jaw and mutered, "I'm sorry, Rylie."

Rylie knew who the true puppet master was. Of the three, Laurel schemed the most. She rose from her seat."I came on behalf of Grandpa and my brothers. Paola, since you're fine, I'Il take my leave. Rest well."

Just as she stepped out, Percy turned and punched the wall, frustration spiling out."Mom! Paola! Are you really going to let her push us around like this?"

Laurel placed a hand on his shoulder. "You're always so quick to act. Do you actually believe I bowed down to that sly little girl?"

Percy looked up. "What are you saying?"

Paola,sitting on the bed, slowly unwrapped the bandage from her wrist. Her voice came out low. "I fell for Rylie's trick again. I didn't expect her to be this cunning. She's got the video showing my theft. I can't let anyone see it."

Percy stared in shock. Her wrist showed no injury. The blood had been faked. His mind reeled. "So it's true then? What my friend told me about the recital?" He stepped closer, his voice raised. "Paola, you really stole Rylie's music? You copied a song from someone like her?"

He could hardly believe it.

Shame burned Paola's cheeks, but she still spoke up. "She trapped me on purpose! That piece started with

my idea! I was the one who came up with it! She only used my concept to write it!"

Percy had no grasp of music, but something about her words didn't sit right."If it really came from you,why couldn't you write it yourself?"

Paola froze. The question silenced her. Embarrassment swelled inside her chest.

Every artist knows inspiration comes and goes like a spark. But how many could actually turn that spark into something real? Who could do that? Not her. She'd spent days revising draft after draft. Spencer had rejected them all. The only version he praised was the one Rylie had scribbled in minutes.

Paola figured Rylie must have seen the discarded drafts and found a wvay to push the idea further. Was it possible she really carried the Owen family's gift for music? Could she truly be a genius?

Paola clenched her jaw. "What makes you think I'm not capable of composing something that good? Rylie stole my concept. There's no other explanation."

Laurel quickly backed her up. "Rylie never studied music. If she has any skill at all, it came from using Paola's ideas. That's the only reason her piece sounds decent."

Percy looked calm on the outside, but something inside him wouldn't let go of what Rylie said earlier.

"Percy, don't forget your enlistment check-up is tomorrow. Head home and rest. Don't stay out late."

His mother's words sent him out of the hospital. As soon as he left, a man in a hat entered the room.He looked like a photographer. After inspecting a camera hidden near the ceiling, he turned to Laurel."Ms.Garrett, the footage is clean. We can edit it as needed."

Laurel looked pleased. Paola, on the other hand, fidgeted. "Mom, are you absolutely sure the man you hired won't mess anything up?"

"I didn't take chances," Laurel replied. "That little brat is sneaky. I paid seven hundred thousand for a top-tier thief. No matter where she stashes that video, he'll get it back."

While they plotted indoors, Rylie walked out of the hospital, helmet in hand, ready to hop on her motorcycle.Just as she was about to mount, she spotted a group of boys shoving an elderly beggar.

The man tried to shield his body, but the kids pushed him over.

From the ground, his strained voice cracked. "Stop! Don't do that!"

Rylie's expression turned icy. She marched over and seized the leader by the collar. "At your age, and you're already picking on the elderly? Who raised you?"

Startled by her fierce tone, the boys scattered and ran.

Rylie crouched to gather the man's bread. Once she helped him up, he took her hand and said with gratitude, "Thank you, dear. I had no idea what to do."

"It's nothing." Rylie smiled as she steadied him onto his cart. "Some kids just need someone to knock sense into them."

After he left, she turned back toward her motorcycle, but a sudden breeze caught her attention. She froze mid-step. Something didn't feel right.

A sharp, woody scent lingered in the air. It wasn't the kind of smell you'd associate with a beggar.She knew that perfume well-- an exclusive fragrance made in tiny batches. It sold for nearly a million.

Her hand slipped into her pocket. It was empty.

Rylie turned instantly and dashed in the direction the old man had gone. But he was already gone. Not a trace. Whoever he was, he knew how to move undetected. Still, Rylie believed no one could disappear so cleanly that she couldn't catch them.

She stood by her motorcycle again, one foot planted, staring down the vacant street. Her voice came soft with a grin. "Interesting."
###Chapter 86 Devin Finch


Rylie had a rare talent for reading the human body and predicting motion. One glance at the alleyway and surrounding road was enough. She veered off toward a narrow lane up ahead.

She hit the brakes at a sharp turn and caught sight of a scuff mark on the right wall. It was faint but recent.Clearly, a car had left its mark. Smirking, she followed the trail.

Barely three minutes passed before she trapped the vehicle in a cul-de-sac.

Rather than surrender, the driver floored the gas. The van surged forward, heading straight for her.

He figured she'd panic and jump out of the way. Thatillusion shattered when she drew a pistol with practiced ease, flicked off the safety, and raised it-aimed straight at the windshield.

Tires screamed. The vehicle jolted to a stop, just a yard from where she stood.

The door creaked open, and the"old beggar" stepped out. Looking at Rylie, he laughed, his voice turning unexpectedly young this time. "So the Owen girl's this sharp. Didn't think anyone out there could track me down."

Rylie recognized the voice at once. Gun lowered, she asked, "How much did Laurel offer you?"

The man yanked the synthetic layer off his face, stunned by how closely her voice matched his employer's."Who are you?" he asked cautiously.

Rylie didn't answer; instead, she extended her palm. "Give me the phone."

Though his mind hadn't caught up yet, his body obeyed. Devin Finch walked over, eyes still wide,and handed over the stolen device without a word.

Then Devin's face shifted. His eyes widened as he stared. "You're the Healing Hand!?"

The realization rattled him. Only one person could activate the signal embedded in his system. It dawned on him all at once. The woman he was assigned to tail-the newly returned daughter of the Owen family-was none other than his superior. And she looked like she hadn't even graduated yet.

Rylie wasn't surprised by the delay in his recognition. Devin and his crew worked overseas and had never seen her real face. Unless she called, they never showed up. Therefore, Rylie guessed that Laurel must have paid a steep price to get his attention.

She leaned against the hood, idly weighing the phone in her hand. "What's her plan for this?"

Devin didn't hesitate. "She asked me to extract the security footage, edit it, and make it seem like you doctored the clip of Paola's theft. She wants it to look like a setup."

Rylie broke into laughter. "That explains the melodrama back at the hospital."

He stared at her, clearly still reeling. "Are you really the Healing Hand? That's true, isn'tit?"

"If I said no, would it even matter?" she replied coolly.

Devin gave a slow shake of his head. "None of us ever imagined you'd be this young. Britton never said a word."

To most, anyone running such massive operations-a medical conglomerate, a tech empire, and a weapons manufacturer-should look the part. A middle-aged man, maybe. Someone intimidating, or at least severe.

What Devin saw instead left him speechless. The legendary "Healing Hand" turned out to be a young woman in her twenties, born into one of the most prominent families in Crolens.

He kept sneaking glances her way. There she was, leaning casually against a motorcycle. Her fingers spun the phone around like a toy. If he didn't know better, he would have guessed she was just a college student killing time.

"Why do you keep looking?" she asked with a slight smirk. "Were you expecting someone different?"

"No, not at all," said Devin, shaking his head quickly. "Just... caught off guard, that's all."

After a short pause, he said, "So Britton never told us who you really were because-"

Her tone was light, but her words were sharp. "Because if a crew like yours found out the 'Healing Hand'was just some girl, you would've stopped listening long ago."

Back when she first stepped in, the chip technology she'd created hadn't been stable. She couldn't risk exposure, so Britton kept her hidden. She hadn't expected him to guard her identity so fiercely that none of them ever saw her face. But that had been then.

Now,her technology was well-developed, and it was already impossible for them to betray her. They'd have to either be loyal to her or commit suicide.

Devin shifted topics. "Laurel offered me eight million and told me to spread her story as if it were real."

Rylie's brow lifted slightly. "She's awfully generous."

He paused for a few seconds, then said, "Maybe it's because your grandfather plans to leave Serenity Manor to you. And Detour Inc too. It used to be under Terrance's care."

She pushed off the motorcycle at once, expression sharpening. "Who told you that?"

Scratching the back of his head, Devin answered, "LaureI doesn't trust anyone. I've had a listening device hidden in her room for years. I check in now and then."

That caught Rylie off guard. A small laugh escaped. "Well. That clears that up."

Then Devin glanced sideways, almost embarrassed. "So... does this count as fixing what I messed up?"

Back when the incident with the maritime weapons broke out, every team was out on assignment. According to the rules, Devin shouldn't have taken on freelance work.

She wiped the smile from her face and replied with a straight tone, "All the money you made will be seized.It'll be split among those still grinding in the field."

He gave a firm nod. That wasn't even close to harsh.

"I'll make sure they're looked after," he said. "Should I stay out of Laurel's way now?"

"No," she answered. "Go ahead and finish the job."

Rylie was well aware that upon returning to the Owen family, she was under countless watchful eyes. Her image,which had been deliberately tarnished by Stacey in the Kirk family, still lingered in their minds.

She had to prove them wrong. Every single one of them.

Since Paola repeatedly sought confrontation, Rylie didn't think there was any need for her to show mercy time and again. Paola wanted to use her as a stepping stone? That would be her gravest mistake.

###Chapter 87 What's Your Next Move


Devin couldn't figure out what Rylie was really after, but he still followed her instructions.

The night he got the high-definition video, he put his editing skills to work. He spliced the footage, jumbled the timeline, and slipped in another clip-this one of Paola's self-directed performance.

Thanks to his talent, hardly anyone could tell the final cut was fake when it finally hit the internet.

That same night, a video surfaced of Paola finishing her music score and heading into Rylie's room to share it. Later, the footage showed her going back to retrieve it. The clip spread like wildfire.

By morning, trust fund kids and socialites couldn't stoptalking about Rylie's scandal. They claimed she'd pulled dirty tricks to swipe Paola's original music and tried to pin the plagiarism on her.

Inside the Garretts' villa, Laurel scrolled through the flood of online comments with a look of quiet satisfaction. She absentmindedly ran her fingers through her daughter's hair."Let's see how that spoiled brat plans to claw her way out of this."

Paola kept her eyes glued to the screen, a smug little smile tugging at her lips. "Mom, your plan's genius.Rylie's reputation with the elites? Completely trashed. I honestly can't wait to see how she plans to cling to them now."

Rylie had seen this coming the moment the video dropped. One after another, people in their circle spoke up for Paola, picking apart her reputation like vultures. The oly person who dared defend her was Johnny, a man she'd met just once at the banquet.

"I think Miss Owen's talent speaks for itself. Maybe there's more to this story than people realize."

When Paola caught wind of this, her annoyance was impossible to hide. Didn't that practically scream she'd set Rylie up? She'd even toyed with the idea of keeping Johnny as a backup fiancé-but clearly, the guy was hopeless ifhe couldn't see the truth at his age.

Over at the Morgan estate, Brad was just wrapping up a brutal stretch of work. A robbery and explosion involving an unidentified cargo ship had taken place right at the country's maritime border, leaving behind pieces of some custom-made firearm scattered in the water.

Now, the navy had no choice but to team up with the security department to dig into what really happened.

Brad hadn't caught a wink of sleep in two nights. Even after two strong cups of coffee, he stil looked as pale as paper.

Brock watched him, concern written all over his face. "You've only just gotten better under Dr. Owen's care.You really shouldn't be pushing yourself like this."

"It's just two days. I'll manage," Brad said, leaning back on the couch and closing his eyes. After a pause,he asked out of nowhere, "Any idea what Rylie's up to these days?"

Brock answered, "I'll look into it."

It didn't take long before he came back with the latest gossip from the upper circles. The good news? Rylie still drew plenty of attention - clear proof she hadn't lost her worth. The bad news stung. People were calling her a disgrace to the Owen family, saying she wasn't cut out for high society.

A heavy silence from Brock finally made Brad open his eyes. The hesitation written across the man's face didn't slip past him. His gaze sharpened, and for once, a flicker of something broke through his usual indifference. "Trouble found her again, didn't it?"

Rather than answering right away, Brock passed him the tablet. "People are saying Dr. Owen stole her cousin's music to get ahead-and then framed her to keep things quiet. It's already turned into a mess."

After watching the entire video, Brad spoke with indifference. "Are all these people blind?"

Brock gave a small nod. "Just the usual crowd of rich kids gossiping. Should I start dealing with it?"

Brad gave a slight nod without thinking, and Brock turned to leave right away. "I'll have the tech team recover the originalvideo and help clear Dr. Owen's name."

"Hold up," Brad called after him.

"Don't release it just yet-not right away."

Brock paused, confused."What?"

"Just bide your time."

tis mind wandered to Rylie's usual air of confidence, like she always had the upper hand no matter what ras thrown at her.

She was the type who always said he didn't need to step in-that she could handle things on her own. But this time? Would it be the same?

No amateur could've pulled off a video like that- most people wouldn't even catch that it had been tampered with. Whoever was behind it clearly knew what they were doing.

Could Rylie really handle this on her own? Brad found himself curious, wanting to see how it played out-but he was ready to step in the second she needed him.

···

As rumors about Rylie spiraled out of control, splashed across gossip blogs and trashy news outlets, she quickly became the city's latest punchline. At first, the Owens planned to shut it down fast.

Kendrick was so furious that he nearly grabbed his cane, ready to storm out and confront the people spreading lies face-to-face.

He didn't blame her for failing to fix the mess. Instead, he held her hand, shouldering the blame without hesitation.

"This is on me. You were never truly valued in the Kirk family-how could you stand a chance against people that sly? I'll make sure you get the justice you deserve."

Felix, her eldest brother, sat beside him, his expression unreadable as his fingers moved quickly across his tablet. "I've already lined up a PR team. We'll have this mess under control by tonight at the latest."

Marcus, her second brother, punched in a number with a cold look on his face. "That video's been tampered with. I saw the original one Rylie sent me after her solo concert. I know exactly who's behind this."

Deandre, her third brother, had rushed back the moment he heard the news, and he looked even angrier than the others. "It's got to be the Garretts, right? Paola's sneaky, sure-but she's not that clever. Laurel must be behind all this! That woman is trying to clear a path for her daughter, using Rylie as the stepping stone! Is she seriously asking for trouble? I'm going over there right now!"

Marcus grabbed his shoulder, holding him back before he could act on impulse. "You can't pull your mafia tricks here in Crolens. Everything in this place runs on evidence. If you make a move without proof, you'll just hand them another weapon to use against our sister."

Deandre ground his teeth in frustration. "Then what's the plan?"
Having her family rally behind her stirred something warm in Rylie's chest. She gave her grandfather's trembling hand a light squeeze. "Don't worry about me, Grandpa. I've got it under control."

Concern shadowed Kendrick's face. "Why act tough now, silly girl? Let your brothers and me handle this for you."

"No need for that." A faint, mischievous glint sparked in her eyes. "That so-called 'leaked' video?I gave them permission to post it. Otherwise, none of you would've seen it."

Out of her pocket, Rylie pulled a USB drive and slid it into the TV port. The screen lit up with a side-by-side comparison- one video was the so-called "original" making rounds online, the other showed the full,untouched surveillance footage.

"What am I looking at here?" Felix asked, adjusting his glasses in surprise.

"Professional video analysis," Rylie said, pointing to the highlighted edits on the screen. "Whoever did it knows their stuff-but they're not perfect."

Marcus's gaze sharpened. "So you set this up from the start. You let the rumors spread on purpose. What's your next move?"
###Chapter 88 Wesdown International Piano Competition


"The entire high society is watching now. Not just me-Paola is under the spotlight too." Rylie smiled."Ever since I came back quietly, those who know who I really am believed I didn't belong in the Owen family.I used to think family matters didn't need the world's opinion. But I overlooked one thing - my brothers' and grandfather's pride. As an Owen, I have to show the world that I, Rylie, am just as remarkable."

Her words stirred something deep in her brothers and grandfather.

Deandre,though still unsure, stepped forward first. "So, Rylie, what do you plan to do?"

"I'm signing up for the famous Wesdown International Piano Competition. Registration for our national division opens tonight," Rylie answered calmly.

Deandre, uninterested in music, blinked in confusion."What's that?"

"It's one of the most prestigious piano competitions in the world. Held every four years,"Marcus explained.He then looked puzzled. "But it's not time yet. How do you know registration is open?"

Rylie smiled faintly. "I saw it online. Registration begins at 8 PM."

Marcus frowned and shook his head. "That's not possible. The Wesdown competition is strict with timing.Registration never opens early. And with how confidential they are, even prep work is kept under wraps.Rylie, you might've seen fake news."

"I'll have the PR team clear up the rumors," Felix added.

"There's no need." Rylie glanced at the clock."Let's just wait till eight."

Seeing how sure she was, her brothers didn't argue. They adored her, and if anything went wrong, they were ready to back her up.

What they didn't know was that Rylie, under her identity as X. Aria, had made one phone call that changed the entire competition schedule.

At exactly 8 PM....

The official Wesdown website released full details-the competition date, venue, registration process, and awards-exactly as Rylie had said.

Marcus' eyes widened. He gripped the edge of his tablet tightly.

"The portal is really open," he muttered, refreshing the page to be sure it wasn't a prank.

Next to him, Deandre noticed his reaction and leaned in. A smile broke across his face. "Rylie was right."

"This doesn't make sense. Even the President wouldn't get anything out of those music elites. They never leak information, let alone release it early," Marcus said, still stunned.

Felix took a sip of wine and smiled. "Marcus, girls are allowed to keep secrets. If she doesn't want to say more, just let it be. As long as she's happy,that's what matters."

Marcus rubbed his forehead. "I know we all revolve around Rylie, but it feels like she doesn't just know the organizers-she's deeply involved with them."

"Maybe. Who knows? Tell me, how good is Rylie's playing? I only know it sounds nice, but I can't tell who plays better," Deandre said.

"She's a natural," Marcus said honestly.

Felix chuckled, and Marcus shot him a look. "What's so funny?"

"Nothing," Felix replied, covering his mouth. "Just remembered the hospital staff once said the same thing.Back then, they said Rylie was born to be a doctor."

Deandre let out a sigh. "She really is a genius. So, what are we even worried about?"

Meanwhile, as fake videos about Rylie continued to spread online, the Owens' silence confused the public.People began to wonder if she truly wasn't favored. If she was, why weren't the Owens speaking up or trying to erase those videos online?

Laurel had been keeping an eye on the Owen family's reaction. She believed trouble might be coming and had already prepared a counterplan.

Paola, who had once been tricked badly, grew uneasy. "Mom, do you think Rylie's setting another trap for us?"

Laurel thought for a while,then smiled with confidence."Devin has always been reliable. The Owens probably hired experts to verify the videos. They must've confirmed that the one online is real and the one Rylie showed was fake. That's why they're disappointed in her."

Paola's eyes lit up. "So what should we do next?"

Just then, Isabella called, her tone light and mocking. "Paola, did you hear Rylie's latest joke?"

Paola glanced at Laurel before replying."NO,I've been practicing piano. Haven't kept up with gossip. What did Rylie do now?"

"The Wesdown International Piano Competition has opened registration for our division. I saw Rylie's name on the website."

Paola looked shocked. She turned to check the calendar. "But isn't that held every four years? It's not time yet."

Isabella replied, "Exactly. But the organizers suddenly decided to hold the competition early, catching all of us off guard. Paola, are you planning to register too? Winning a prize in that competition has always been yourdream," Isabella said.

Paola's heart skipped. Winning at Wesdown meant joining the ranks of the best pianists. She might not reach Marcus' global fame, but at home, she'd finally be respected. Still...
###Chapter 89 Witness A Legend At The Piano


A shadow flickered across Paola's face. "Why would Rylie choose this moment, of all moments, to throw herself into the competition? Is she trying to make some kind of statement?"

Thoughtful silence settled as Isabella considered her friend's words. "That's definitely possible. With her joining, does that mean you'll be standing across from her atthe finals?"

Agreement was written all over Isabella's response. After exchanging a flurry of hurried messages, Paola wasted no time in ending the conversation and reaching out to Laurel with the news about Rylie.

She spoke with urgency. "Mom, Rylie's just entered the Wesdown International Piano Competition. She's clearly trying to prove something. What am I supposed to do now?"

Anxiety was clear in the way Paola's shoulders sagged, and Laurel felt it like a knot in her own chest.With her tone steady, Laurel said, "From the moment you learned to walk, I made sure you studied with the best piano teachers. You've put your heart into this for years, and now you're going to let Rylie rattle you? Do you truly believe you can't outplay someone who's never even had real lessons?"

Color rose in Laurel's cheeks as her frustration grew. Paola's answer came after a long pause. "But Mom,Rylie's actually good. Sometimes I wonder if it's because I'm not a direct Owen, like she is..."

A dry laugh escaped Laurel. "Genes? If that's what you're worried about, remember this -your father isn't Kendrick's son, sure, but he's still the nephew. Owen blood runs in him, and has it done him any favors?"

Paola said nothing, shrinking from her mother's biting words about her father, her eyes fixed on the floor.

Softening at the sight of her daughter's pain, Laurel pulled her close and spoke gently. "This isn't about who you're related to. Rylie only managed something special because she borrowed your ideas. You're the reason she stood out. Your talent is miles ahead of hers."

For the first time that evening, Paola's eyes brightened as hope took root. She clung to Laurel's sleeve and whispered, "I want to do this, Mom. I want to show Rylie what I'm capable of. Will you help me?"

Wrapping her daughter in a tight embrace, Laurel answered without hesitation, "Absolutely, you have my support."
...

Much later, with night pressing against the windows, Rylie sorted through her emails at her desk. The shrill ring of her phone broke the silence-Ron Bentley was calling.

She picked up, her voice edged with fatigue. "Ron, what's so urgent at this hour?"

The Wesdown International Piano Competition counted Ron among its senior organizers, yet he was far more than an administrator; royal blood from Ostium flowed in his veins, and music was his lifelong pursuit.

Excitement laced his words. "Word is out that you plan to unveil the restored version of that incomplete classical score you bought a while back. Are you really doing it at the competition?"

A steady composure marked Rýlie's response. "I managed to finish reconstructing it, but it took a while."

Surprise lingered in Ron's voice. "I honestly didn't think you'd ever make that piece public."

Without missing a beat, Ron continued, "You've even agreed to play the final piece yourself, stepping in as a judge. The participants this year will witness a legend at the piano-X. Aria, live."

Rylie allowed herself a small, wry smile. "If I'd had a choice, I wouldn't be doing this."

"That's all I needed to hear. Don't think you can change your mind at the last minute," said Ron.

"You have my word. I'll take my seat at the judges' table," replied Rylie.

Once the call ended, she peeled the wrapper from a lollipop and popped it into her mouth. Afterward, she logged onto her dark web account to skim through fresh emails.

A new tip from Britton caught her eye. The navy had hauled up weapon fragments for analysis and looked set to bring in specialists for further dismantling. If the research panned out, the arms factory she worked with might miss out on a future contract.

She hardly worried. Most of her shipments had gone north, and she knew others would try to duplicate her work. Still, none came close.

Her technology remained out of reach, no matter how hard the competition tried.

Another alert reported that a full shipment of weapons had surfaced in Crolens and Troale. But the goods had disappeared without a trace, whisked away by a crime syndicate soon after arrival. The authorities were scrambling to investigate.

Crolens. That name made her pause. She muttered to herself, "So they wound up in Crolens? I've never hacked their port surveillance system before."

Strict firearm regulations defined the country where she resided. Without government backing and considerable ingenuity,moving weapons into Crolens would have been impossible.

At the same time, a corruption probe loomed over Crolens' mayor. The scandal had grown when his secretary was caught up in the massive healthcare scheme tied to the Wilde family, leaving the mayor with little room to deny involvement.

That left only one pressing question: Who had the power to greenlight this shipment into Crolens?
###Chapter 90 Their Closeness In The Laboratory


Paola wasted no time filling up the forums and chat rooms during the two-day registration window for the piano competition. What thrilled her most was seeing her own carefully edited video featured front and center on the competition's official website, playing for everyone on an endless loop. Enthusiastic viewers did not hesitate to call her a genius, saying she played as though music was a language she had always known.

Things could not have been more different for Rylie. The whispers were merciless. All through those circles,people pointed out that she had put her name down for the auditions as well, yet there was not a trace of her performance anywhere. The silence was enough for everyone to assume that she had been bluffing all along, only to be unable to put together a single noteworthy piece or even pass the first round.

Brock had a new routine now. Besides handling daily work reports, he found himself keeping tabs on anything and everything related to Rylie.

"People are turning on Rylie, and the Owens haven't stepped in. The word is that she's about to get cast aside by them," said Brock as he finished reading the latest messages.

Brad glancedup, a thoughtful look flickering in his eyes. "Do you know what she's been doing lately?"

"She's stuck to her old habits. She just shuttles between the university's lab and the military base, not much else. She hasn't gone back to the Owens' place. Do you think she's really been hurt this time and can't bring herself to return?"

Brock's voice wavered for a moment, but he continued, "Maybe you should go see her."

The suggestion hung in the air while Brad's fingers hovered above the table."Why get involved in someone else's family drama?"

He knew exactly what would happen if he went. That young woman would look right at him with steady,unfazed eyes, saying, "I don't need you to step in. I'll take care of myself."

Picturing that, Brad raised his eyebrow. Despite being so young-barely past twenty-she carried herself with a level of grit and composure that most people never developed.

She refused to lean on anyone. That kind of self-reliance was troubling.

On impulse, Brad stood, reached for his coat draped over the back of his chair, and walked out of the office.

By the time Rylie finished her chaotic shift in the lab, tension knotted her shoulders. She shrugged off her lab coat and checked her phone out of habit.

A message from Freddy at Aetheris Pharmacy waited for her."The Kirk family in Crolens is offering up 70percent of their company if you can fix Nicolas's leg. Are we moving forward or not, Boss?"

She studied Freddy's words, tapping her finger on the desk while she weighed the Kirk family's financial standing.

Not long ago, the Kirks had been worth less than eighty million, and now seventy percent of that sat on the table. The offer was far from impressive.

Still, a quiet smile played at her lips. Rylie decided she would accept.




Someone from the community near the military compound had gone out of their way to pack her a thoughtful lunch. No sooner had Rylie taken her first bite than the routine quiet was interrupted.

The lab door swung wide, and Brad strolled in. He had draped a jacket over one arm, his white shirt open at the collar, revealing the sharp lines of his build beneath the fabric.

Across the room, he spotted her-hunched over in a corner, working through a mysterious lunch. As she met his gaze, there was a brief flicker of confusion in those almond-shaped eyes, with a stray bit of food clinging stubbornly to her lips.

He walked over, his attention snagging on the mystery vegetables in her bowl. A frown creased his brow. that what counts as lunch these days?"

The sudden interest from him caught Rylie off guard. "Why? Did your health take a turn again?"

Setting her meal aside, she stood and reached for a fresh pair of medical gloves."Go on, sit down. Tell me what's hurting you."

Brad kept his real reason for showing up to himself. Easing into a chair nearby, he offered a half-hearted complaint. "Feels like something's off with my neck. Could be the meds, I don't really know."

Surprise flashed across Rylie's face. "Your neck is the problem?"
She picked up a medical flashlight, holding Brad's jaw with one hand while the other cast a warm yellow light across his sharp features.

The closeness between them was evident. Brad caught the mix of clinical sterility and a subtle trace of something sweet drifting from her.

"Any tingling or numbness lately?" she asked, her tone thoughtful.

He shook his head. "Nothing like that."

She motioned for him to stick out his tongue. Her hand cradled his jaw as she peered into his mouth,thoroughly focused.

Brad remained motionless, letting her work. His breath slowed, and the steady rise and fall of his throat betrayed a sudden awareness. He found his eyes wandering to her lips, barely a breath away from his own.

One stubborn grain of rice clung to her lower lip, trembling slightly with every breath- a detail that reminded him of a kitten caught in the act of sneaking a treat.

Without much thought, Brad reached up, his thumb brushing across her mouth. "You've got a bit of lunch right here."

Rylie went utterly still. The warmth and roughness of his fingertip, toughened by years on the shooting range, sent a ripple through her nerves.

The next second, she jerked upright. The penlight slipped from her grasp, bounced once, and rolled away.

While she collected herself, Brad lingered in his seat, an amused grin curving his mouth. "Didn't expect that much of a reaction. Did I embarrass you?"

Rylie crouched down to retrieve the penlight. Her heartbeat steadied as she glanced back at him. "There's nothing wrong with your neck. Tell me, why are you really here? Is it possible you missed me after a few days apart?"

The sharpness of her reply caught Brad off guard. Closing the gap between them, he shifted into her space."So many stories are flying around these days. I started to wonder if you'd lost your drive for research.That's why I showed up-to make sure you're all right and to see if you want a hand."

Scanning the leftovers in her lunchbox, he frowned at the heap of roots and scraps of meat. "Is this what's left for you? Did the Owens finally turn their backs on you?"

Arms folded and voice flat, Rylie shrugged off his concern. "Looks like I'll be on my own soon."

His steady composure wavered as Brad's eyes met hers, a rare graveness taking hold. "Then maybe you should let me look after you instead."

###Chapter 91 Award-winning Paper


Surprise flickered across Rylie's features, her laughter breaking the silence that had followed her initial shock.Sunlight streamed down, bathing her in warmth and lending her an almost glowing vibrance.

The sight left Brad completely spellbound. He couldn't look away from her infectious grin, losing his train of thought for a heartbeat.

In a playful gesture, Rylie lifted the food box and held out a piece of the mysteriouslant roonudging it toward his lips. "Mr. Morgan, are you brave enough to taste this?"

Before he realized what was happening, Brad's reflexes had already betrayed him-he opened his mouth and took a bite.

The flavor hit instantly, an odd mix flooding his palate. His face contorted, as though he had chewed on something both musty and pungent, with the unmistakable tang of spoiled fish.

A deep frown etched across his brow, Brad fought the urge to spit it out. His visible discomfort drew a barely contained snicker from Rylie. "This is fish mint. One of the servants picked it up fresh at the market.It's a lot better with meat, don't you think?"

Pressing his knuckles against his mouth, Brad stifled a cough and managed to whisper, "Please... water..."

Amused, Rylie noticed the flush in his cheeks and quickly passed him a glass. "Is it really that awful?"

He grabbed the water and gulped it in one go, Adam's apple working and sweat popping out on his forehead. Once he caught his breath, he muttered, "You'd have to be fearless to wvillingly eat something like that."

With mischief dancing in her eyes, Rylie twirled another piece between her fingers. "Care to risk it again?"

Brad instinctively backed away. Normally composed in every negotiation, he now looked thoroughly rattled by a simple herb. He watched her playful expression, then, in a sudden move, he reached out and caught her wrist.

"If you're such a fan..." With a swift tug, he drew her close, his other hand bracing on the counter, hemming her in. "Maybe you should have a little more."

Rylie, stunned by the sudden closeness, found herself pressed against him. The scent of antiseptic and clean linen filled her senses as she lifted her gaze to meet his, their faces nearly touching. The spoon she'd been holding slipped from her hand, clattering to the floor.

Lowering his head until their lips nearly brushed, Brad let his breath linger between them. "What's wrong?Have you lost your nerve?"

Out of nowhere, a piercing alarm blared through the lab, making both of them jump. In a heartbeat,Rylie used the distraction to wriggle free, instantly cutting the moment short. "The Petri dish-it's overheating!"

Her quick dash to the workstation looked more like a getaway than a concern for her experiment.

Brad stayed rooted to the spot, pressing his tongue to the roof of his mouth, the odd tang of fish mint refusing to fade. For some reason, he realized the aftertaste had started to grow on him.

He called her name out of the blue,"Rylie."

"What is it?" she answered without glancing back.

With casual confidence, Brad rolled his cuff and suggested, "I haven't had lunch. Once you're finished here,let's grab something to eat."

"No, I'll pass. My neighbor prepared a meal just for me, and I won't let it go to waste."

Rylie continued, "Besides, I have other plans this afternoon. If you're that hungry, you can go on your own."

He couldn't help himself. "So what's keeping you busy?"

A sigh slipped from Rylie as she glanced over her shoulder, weighing whether to answer or brush him off.She finally said, "There's an academic event at the university. They're handing out awards this afternoon,and my name's on the list."

A flicker of amusement crossed Brad's face, though a hint of genuine surprise lingered in his voice."So you found time for a paper on top of everything else?"

While adjusting the temperature of the Petri dish, Rylie nonchalantly replied, "Pulled a few late nights last week. Wrote about breakthroughs in neural regeneration."
\


After a beat, she added, "Actually, I analyzed some of your samples for it."

The news caught Brad off guard. His eyes narrowed, a faint glint of suspicion appearing as he considered her words.

He moved closer, his presence quietly looming, and spoke in a low tone. "Let me get this straight. My lab results are part of your ticket to the stage?"

Her hands paused mid-task. She straightened, facing him directly. "Nothing wrong with making use of what's available. NNo names, no details-nobody will trace anything back to you."

Only the soft, mechanical whir of the incubator broke the quiet that followed.

With a half-smile, Brad mimicked her earlier gesture, tipping her chin with one finger.,Dr. Owen,does that mean you owe me a share if you cash in?"

She swatted his hand away, shooting him a look. "Pretty sure saving your hide was payment enough."

A real laugh escaped him, quick and easy, and she felt a little jolt somewhere deep inside."Guess you're right. My life's in your debt, and so's a little blood."

He slipped his phone back into his pocket and straightened his sleeves. "Tell me the details for the ceremony.I'll handle the ride."

Before Rylie could object, Brad was already holding out her coat, his stance by the door firm and expectant,shutting down any protest.

Impatience colored his voice as he checked his watch."Let's go. Linger much longer and you'll end up missing your big debut."

Exiting the lab, Rylie trailed behind, watching sunlight scatter in patterns across the polished corridor floor.A quick glance at her phone assured her there was still a good thirty minutes before the ceremony kicked off.

Brad's car was parked outside the building, a sleek, luxurious black Bentley, its smooth lines gleaming coldly under the sun.
He pulled open the passenger door with a practiced motion. As Rylie slipped into the car, a faint,familiar trace of antiseptic reached her nose-the same subtle scent she always noticed on Brad's lab coat.

As he settled in behind the wheel, Brad threw a sideways look her way. "Nervous?"

A light laugh escaped her. "It's just an academic write-up, hardly enough to make me break a sweat."

By the time they reached the medical college, the conference hall was bustling. Rows of seats were filled,and a massive LED screen kept cycling through the list of featured research - Rylie's entry, "Novel Discoveries and Clinical Applications of Neuroregenerative Factors," flashed boldly across the display.

Inside, she felt the weight of attention settle over her-eyes tracked her movements, some openly curious,others edged with skepticism, and a few looked downright unfriendly.

A whisper, heavy with mockery, floated from a cluster of students. "Isn't that Rylie Kirk?"

Someone else murmured, "Didn't you hear? She's involved with the Owen family now. Gossip travels fast,doesn't it?"

All around her, conversations burst forth, voices rising and overlapping in a sudden clamor.

A familiar voice called out, "Rylie, I didn't think l'd see you at this event."

She pivoted to face the speaker and found Stacey standing amid a group of Timothy's old lab colleagues,their company elevated by the presence of a distinguished professor. Stacey wore her usual fragile charm,the sort that seemed to draw sympathy wherever she went.

Skipping over Stacey entirely, Rylie let her gaze land on the man beside her-Stetson Ahmed, the medical school's associate dean. "Mr. Ahmed," she called out, her tone even.

A small nod acknowledged her. "Rumor has it you wrote this paper alone," Stetson said. "You managed to outshine entire teams with faculty mentors backing them. Quite the feat."

Her reply was reserved. "I appreciate the kind words."

Stetson offered a few more words of encouragement. "Best of luck in the results."

In his mind, this was surely the high point of a recent graduate's career. Getting her name on the shortlist had to be sheer fortune, no matter the effort or talent. As for taking home a real award, especially for a topic so ambitious? He doubted it. The judges probably just liked her boldness enough to give her a mention.
###Chapter 92 Handling All Of This By Herself


Trailing carefully behind Stetson, Stacey made sure not to do anything that might set Rylie off. She knew full well she wasn't a match for her. All she could muster was a weak smile. "Mom and Dad really miss you. It'd mean a lot if you came home to visit."

Rylie acted like Stacey wasn't even there, heading straight for her seat without sparing her a glance.

All around them, whispers stirred like wind through leaves. Some people murmured that ever since Rylie went from being the Kirk family's fake daughter to a real high-society figure, she'd grown too full of herself.Others said she was smart to ignore someone like Stacey- who knew how easily a simple conversation could turn into a trap?

If not for making it to the finals, Rylie wouldn't have even bothered showing up. Leaning back lazily, she stifled a yawn, waiting for the award ceremony to finallykick off.

Stories about Rylie had already reached Stetson's ears. After Timothy was put in jail, the lab he once led was handed directly to Rylie by the mysterious investor backing the project. The decision had sparked no small amount of gossip among the mentors.

Naturally, Stacey-who used to call herself Rylie's sister-became the one that everyone wanted to ask questions about Rylie.

According to what Stacey told them, Rylie's academic track record was solid, but nowhere near the level required to run a medical research lab solo. Not to mention, she had only just turned twenty this year.

Every so often, Stetson found his gaze drifting toward Rylie, who looked moments away from dozing off in her seat. "Rylie's truly impressive. If shewere to join my research group, it'd be a huge win for us."

When she heard that, Stacey's smile faltered. Her life with the Kirk family was already hanging by a thread.Things weren't much better at school. Most of the girls had started to shut her out, leaving her to cling to old connections from her former research group. Getting into Stetson's team had taken no small effort-countless compliments, constant eagerness to help. But now, hearing him talk about recruiting Rylie so openly sent a wave of panic through her.

Biting down on her lip, she carefully steered the conversation in a different direction. "Professor Ahmed,  heard there's a special gold award this year, aside from the usual top three prizes. Is it meant for our group's paper?"

Hearing that, Stetson gave a light, self-satisfied laugh. "That's right. Our work has brought some meaningful progress to the field. It might seem small now, but it's caught the experts' attention. That's why they created the gold award in the first place."

Stacey smoothed out the wrinkles on her blazer, checking herself quickly before flashing a polite smile. "All thanks to you, Professor Ahmed, and the guidance of our senior team. This award feels like a golden stamp on my future career."

With the Wilde family's downfall and VitaLink Hospital under investigation, Stacey's dream of working at VitaLink Hospital with Leland and Marsha as soon as she graduated was shattered. The Kirk family wasn't faring much better, barely holding on by a thread, and her brothers had long stopped hiding their disappointment in her. Stacey knew that she had no one left to rely on but herself to carve out a future.

Stetson, clearly enjoying the flattery, allowed a wider smile to stretch across his face. "Let's not overdo it,Stacey. In this field, staying humble is part of the job."

With her head bowed slightly, Stacey answered in a soft, obedient tone, "Of course,Professor Ahmed."

Soon after, the host stepped onto the stage, offering a warm smile as he kicked off the ceremony with a few welcoming remarks. One by one, the esteemed experts were invited up to introduce themselves before moving on to announce the nominated papers and the teams behind them.

Each time, a mentor would rise with their group of students, sharing stories of late nights, setbacks,and the hard work poured into their research.

The sound of applause rolled through the hall.

As Rylie's name came up, the host cleared his throat and projected his voice with practiced energy."Up next, we have 'Novel Discoveries and Clinical Applications of Neuroregenerative Factors. Would the representative from the team please step forward to share a few words?"

Another round of applause followed, echoing out of habit more than excitement, as eyes naturally drifted oward the side of the stage where most assumed a team of researchers would be rising together.

ut... From the center of the room, a single, slender figure stood slowly and without hurry.

With one hand tucked casually into her lab coat pocket, Rylie used the other to straighten her collar as she strolled toward the aisle. Her long ponytail shimmered like silk beneath the bright stage lights.

Silence fell over the entire venue in an instant.

Every pair of eyes locked onto the lone young woman making her way to the front without hesitation.

Near the back, a tall figure leaned lazily against the wall, his gaze never straying from her. A faint smile tugged at his lips. Even alone, she carried the weight and presence of an entire team.

A hushed voice broke the silence somewhere in the crowd. "She's handling all of this by herself? No mentor,no team behind her? How is that even possible? Rylie's seriously built different."

Stacey's eyes flew wide open, her fingers unconsciously digging into the flesh of her palm. She couldn't tear her gaze away from Rylie's back, no matter how much she wanted to look elsewhere. It was still hard to believe- the woman she once looked down on and trampled on was now standing alone in this grand academic hall, holding the room's attention with ease.
###Chapter 93 Who Is The Real Gold Award Winner


Each team was required to step onto the stage and give a brief introduction of their paper's findings and how they validated them. Usually, every member presented their part.

Meanwhile, Rylie was alone, so she had to give the introduction all by herself. She took the mic, her gaze calm and steady as she scanned the audience before speaking. "Hello, everyone, I'm Rylie. I completed all the research and experiments for this paper on my own. It's an honor to be shortlisted for this medical competition. I welcome open discussion and gladly share all the data and findings from my work."

The applause that followed was lukewarm.Few were truly optimistic about her chances.

After all, Rylie was still a student-young and without a guiding professor. The fact that she completed such a complex paper on her own in just two days raised doubts about its quality and authenticity, as no one knew whether her findings had been validated or not. What was more, she was up against teams led by top professors.

Most assumed she was only here for the experience, not the prize. Even the mentors shared that view.

Then the host returned to the stage and began announcing the winners, along with the prize money for each category.

"First, the third prize goes to 'The Application of Gene Therapy in Parkinson's Disease' by Professor Marcelo Watts'team!"

Applause broke out as a middle-aged professor and his students walked up to receive their award-a two-hundred-thousand-dollar research grant.

"Next, the second prize goes to 'Clinical Research on Stem Cell Transplantation for Spinal Cord Injury,' by Academician Padgett Ward's team!"

Cheers followed as Padgett's team secured a three-hundred-thousand-dollar grant. Students onstage congratulated one another with boright smiles.

Next, the first prize winner would be revrealed. Stetson's team began adjusting their clothes, preparing to take the stage.
"I heard the first prize comes with five hundred thousand dollars!" one student whispered excitedly.

Stetson stayed composed, his hands resting on the table. "Let's not celebrate too soon. It's not our turn yet,"he said.

The students glanced at each other. "Professor Ahmed, the next one is the first prize," one of them said.

Stacey chimed in softly, her tone full of confidence, "We deserve better than that. With your guidance, we're sure to win the gold award. I heard this award didn't even exist before. It was added just for us because of the breakthrough in our research."

Stetson chuckled. "Yes, I heard the same. The gold award comes with one million in funding. Besides,they would help us set up a full research team and secure our future."

For them, winning that award meant everything.

Stacey's eyes sparkled as she looked toward the stage, already imagining herself being called Dr. Payne.

The host cleared his throat and smiled mysteriously."Now, for the first prize in this competition... The winner is..."

He paused, building suspense as his gaze swept the crowd.

"The Application of Gene Editing Technology in Neurodegenerative Diseases, by Professor Stetson Ahmed's team!"

The room erupted in cheers. But Stetson's smile vanished. He tightened his grip on the meeting manual.

His students beamed and exchanged hugs, not noticing that Stetson, Stacey, and other team members looked stunned.

Stacey's smile faded. Wasn't the gold award supposed to be theirs? W/hy had they only won first prize?

The others, influenced by Stetson's earlier words too, looked confused. "Weren't we promised the gold award? What happened?" one student whispered.

"Did the committee change it last minute?" another muttered.

"Or... Was there never a gold award to begin with?"

Speculation filled the air, but no one dared speak up.
"Professor Ahmed and team, please come up to receive your award," the host called again.

Stacey leaned closer to Stetson. "Everyone's watching. Let's go onstage first. I believe we still have a shot at the gold. Maybe it's just a mix-up."

Stetson forced a smile and rose stiffly, his eyes locked on the envelope still in the host's hand-the one that hadn't been opened yet.

His mind raced. Who could've taken the gold award? He had reviewed most of the papers and found none that could rival his.Except...

He turned slightly and looked at Rylie. He hadn't bothered to read her submission properly. It was a student's solo project, unpolished and untested. He dismissed it after a quick glance. There was no way...Or was there?

As he walked up the steps, his thoughts swirled.

Each step felt like walking on clouds-light, dizzying, unreal. The cheers in the hall blurred into buzzing noise. Five hundred thousand dollars. On any other day, it would've been a dream come true. But right now,it felt like a slap in the face. His hopes of securing a bright future had just cracked.

"Congratulations, Professor Ahmed. Please say a few words," the host said, handing over the trophy.

Stetson took the mic and swallowed his frustration. "First, I'd like to thank the committee for their recognition..."

His speech was short and stiff. Hiseyes kept drifting toward the final unopened envelope. Who had taken the award that was supposed to be his?

The joy of winning had vanished. For him and his team, the ceremony had turned into a bitter pill. Once offstage, all eyes turned to the host, waiting for the final announcement.

Smiling, the host stepped forward. "Originally, the ceremony was to end here. But among the submissions,one stood out. Its value to the medical field far exceeded even our top expectations. Because of this, the committee unanimously agreed to add a gold award above the first prize."

le paused and glanced at the card in his hand before continuing, "And the winner of this award might urprise you.l know I was certainly stunned."

e took a deep breath and read aloud. "The gold award goes to the author of 'Novel Discoveries and Clinical Applications of Neuroregenerative Factors'-Rylie Owen!"
###Chapter 94 Care To Walk Us Through Your...
Shock registered across every face as the host's announcement echoed through the hall.


Instead of the enthusiastic cheers meant for a champion, the audience's applause faltered, uncertain,with students taking a moment to absorb what had just happened.



Stetson's congratulatory smile vanished, his hand unconsciously creasing the certificate meant for the top winner. The young woman he'd dismissed as a non -threat had walked off with the highest honor. How could that possibly be? Where was the justice in this outcome?



"Impossible..." The words slipped out, barely audible.


Without warning, he sprang to his feet, voice slicing through the uneasy silence. "There's something wrong here!"



A hush fell over the crowd as the host cleared his throat and addressed him with visible discomfort,asking, "Is there a problem, Professor Ahmed?"


Fuming,Stetson marched up to the front, his outrage plain for all to see. "I refuse to accept this decision!How can a mere undergraduate-someone not even finished with her degree - overshadow the painstaking work of veteran professors?"



The audience buzzed, a low tide of whispers sweeping through the room.



Not missing her chance, Stacey stood too and lent her voice to the protest. "Professor Ahmed makes a valid point! Rylie's data isn't transparent, and her experiment was completed far too quickly for these results to be reliable. This isn't what a gold award looks like!"



Turning her attention to the panel of judges, Stacey continued, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears,"Academic honesty is the heart of science. We can't let opportunists drag down the reputation we've built here!"



Her impassioned plea struck a chord, and a ripple of agreement passed through the hall. Someone in the back leaned toward their neighbor and whispered,"Seriously, have you heard the latest? Rylie was booted out by the Kirks own family, only to get picked up by the wealthiest folks in town."



"Is it possible that Rylie's connection to the Owen family tipped the scales, landing her that gold award?"

 "That crosses a line. Medicine isn't some schoolyard contest-lives hang in the balance."



Murmurs intensified as tension rippled through the crowd, with the judges quietly conferring among themselves.



A senior panelist finally addressed the room,his brow furrowed. "Professor Ahmed,let me assure you, all submissions were evaluated anonymously, and the review process was exceptionally thorough.There was no bias."


Stetson's tone was biting. "If that's true, then how did she gather her data? Are we really to believe an undergraduate pulled off such advanced neural regeneration research alone?"


Curiosity swept the auditorium as every head swiveled in Rylie's direction.



Unbothered, she twirled a pen between her fingers,radiating calm.



One of the judges leaned forward, addressing her directly, saying, "Miss Owen, would you care to walk us through your methodology?"



Rylie placed her pen down with quiet confidence,rising from her seat at an unhurried pace. Rather than heading straight to the stage, she met Stetson's stare with a mysterious smile. "Professor Ahmed, I welcome the chance to answer any concerns. Please, stop me at any point if something isn't clear."



Taken aback by her poise, Stetson managed to regain his composure. "You talk a good game. But if you can't give a solid explanation, that's proof the results are bogus!"



A gentle nod preceded her next move as Rylie reached into her bag and pulled out a USB drive."Let's walk through it together. I'll lay out every step for you all."



Without hesitation, Rylie cast her research findings onto the auditorium's main screen, filling it with graphs, time-stamped lab reports, and the full timeline of her work.



She addressed the audience with measured confidence. "Although I drafted the paper over a couple of days, the actual data collection spanned almost two months." Step by step, she outlined how she identified a rare patient for sampling, then backed up each stage of her methodology with precise figures and documented evidence.



Layer upon layer of advanced médical theory filled her presentation, leaving undergraduates glancing at one another in confusion. In the faculty section,several Ph.D. advisors watched in silent awe.

Any suspicion of plagiarism crumbled, as her fluid delivery and quick, detailed answers to tough questions made it clear she knew the material inside out.



The clarity in her voice and the command she held over the material gradually won over many skeptics in the hall.



Stetson, looking even more unsettled, rose from his seat and tried to stump her with complex, borderline -hostile inquiries. Rylie addressed each challenge head -on,sometimes even expanding the conversation with innovative ideas and potential future research.



Impressed murmurs grew among the judges. Her grasp of the field and her willingness to push boundaries didn't go unnoticed.



But just as the room's tension began to dissolve, a quiet voice drifted through the rows, catching Stacey's attention.



One of the school's top students, poised to begin graduate studies, whispered, "Look at these results.One should realize that none of our school's standard equipment could produce this level of data in such a short timeframe. Where did Rylie do these experiments?"



A classmate nodded. "The university's gear is as good as it gets around here. If she used a private lab, those are heavily secured - nobody just walks in off the street."



When she heard this, Stacey's eyes flashed with a new sense of purpose. She sprang to her feet. "Rylie, you claim these results came from our school's equipment,but as far as I know, you'd need industry-grade machinery to reach those numbers in two months. Are you certain all this data is authentic?"



A soft laugh escaped Rylie as she pulled out her USB drive, then made her way to the media team manning the projection equipment.



Her abrupt detour left the tech group glancing at one another in confusion, but she leaned down, gesturing to their laptop. "Would you mind if I take over for a moment?"



Struck by her calm confidence, the students could only manage a wordless nod. "Go ahead," one finally stammered.



Seizing the controls, Rylie deftly accessed the lab's security archive, then quickly merged her experiment footage onto her USB drive. The entire process took less than three minutes.



Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the auditorium began to turn hostile.
Many in the crowd believed Rylie was retreating out of guilt, and accusations started flying from all directions.



A handful of Stetson's students - still bitter from being bested by Rylie back in Timothy's research group- sprang to their feet. "Revoke Rylie's award!Academic fraud has no place here! Justice for Professor Ahmed! He deserves the top honor!"


Their rallying cries swelled as others joined, and Stacey's smile grew sharper. She leaned closer to Stetson and whispered with confidence, "You don't have to worry. No one is going to take what belongs to you."



Putting on a mask of grave concern, Stetson heaved a dramatic sigh. "Stacey, in research, honesty comes before all else. If there's been any dishonesty, it must be addressed with the utmost graveness..."

###Chapter 95 Let's Grab A Meal Together
Stetson paused deliberately, sweeping his gaze across the venue to ensure all eyes were on him before continuing, "That said, I believe the younger generation deserves a chance to explain themselves."



Though his words seemed impartial, each carried a subtle edge, insinuating the possibility of Rylie's dishonesty while positioning himself as the gracious elder willing to offer her a chance.



Stacey immediately picked up on the message. Her eyes reddened."Professor Ahmed, you're far too kind!But academic misconduct is a serious offense that cannot be overlooked!"



She turned to Rylie, her voice quivering, nearly breaking into tears. "Rylie, if you come clean now,there's still a chance people might forgive you..."



"Are you done?" Rylie's soft voice cut through the room, commanding attention.



Stacey,incensed by her composure, raised her voice "What is that attitude supposed to mean? Are you trying to justify fabricating your data?"

Without a hint of urgency. Rylie pluigged the USB drive into the laptop and pulled up a video. Since everyone seems 50 interested in my research process



The large screen lit up with high-definition footage Rylie appeared in a lab coat, operating a unique instrument. The timestamp marked the video as two months old.



"Is that...?" An elderly professor on the judges' panel suddenly rose. "That's a quantum-level microscope!"



A wave of astonishment swept through the room. The advanced equipment was rare - only a handful existed in the country. Even Stetson's lab didn't have one.



Rylie opened a second video. "These are logs from my research at the school's experimental lab, the one formerly overseen by Timothy Powell. Starting from two months ago, I've meticulously documented all my research processes."



The screen showed her meticulously recording data,visibly worn out from sleepless nights, with dark circles etched under her eyes.



"That's impossible!" Stacey objected, her voice rising again. "Powell's Lab doesn't even have that kind of equipment!I've never seen it!"
Rylie shot her a calm, indifferent glance. "of courseyou haven't l bought it myself."
Stacey froze. "That's ridiculous!
"ls it?" Rylie responded with a faint, mocking smileYou're well aware that l can afford it. Your Kirk familystill owes me tens of millions in unpaid medicalexpenses
The room erupted in murmurs, and Stacey's faceflushed with embarrassment. Her temper boiled overShe's lying! Don't believe her! She even stole hercousin's piano compositions-she's a fraud! Nothingshe says is true!"
'Enough!" the chairman of the judges interjected, histone firm. "Rylie's findings have been reviewed andaffirmed byseven independent experts:And nowshe's presented complete documentation of her workWe will not continue to discredit her simply becauseof her youth and brilliance. There is no flaw in herresearch."
He turned sharply toward Stetson. "Professor Ahmedcontrol your student. This is an academic platformnot a courtroom for baseless accusations. Don't bringinternet gossip into a scientific evaluation.
Standing center stage, Rylie cast a cool glance at thepale-faced Stacey and the shaken Stetson before
shifting her eyes toward the back of the hall


Brad stood there, arms folded, a trace of amusement glinting in his eyes.



A faint smile tugged at Rylie's lips. She raised the trophy high.



She had claimed this victory, thoroughly and on her own terms.



After the ceremony, Rylie stepped outside and saw Brad's car still parked nearby. After a brief pause,she walked over, opened the door, and got in.



"Why are you still here?"



Brad leaned back against the leather seat, relaxed "Let's grab a meal together. We've got something to celebrate, don't we?"



Rylie weighed the medal in her hand. "This?" She tossed it casually into her pocket. "The prize money won't even cover half my project costs."



Brad replied, "Isn't the rest of the funding coming from me?"



Rylie looked over at him. "Should'I be thanking you,then?"



Brad chuckled. "Steak?"
No I'm eating at HaloFlow Pharmacy tonight, she said,then hesitated briefly. "You want to come?



She offered the invitation out of politeness, not expecting him to accept. But he nodded without the slightest hesitation. "Sure."



Rylie gave a slight nod in return. Well... alright then.



On the way, Rylie took a few calls, some from contacts in the community near the military compound, and one from Clive.



Under her care, Clive's legs had shown significant improvement. Word of his recovery was spreading,and the call felt hesitant, almost awkward.



"Sorry to bother you,Dr.Owen," Clive said. "But a few friends of mine with chronic illnesses are asking if they could come see you. They've been pestering me nonstop-I had to ask."



Rylie paused in thought. "I'm really swamped right now But you can go see my mentor. She treats patients at HaloFlow Pharmacy, and honestly, her skills are better than mine. She should be able to help them."


Clive quickly noted the address. "Got it, got it. Thank you,Dr.Owen."



The Luxury car turned into a quiet alley near the pharmacy Rylie and Brad stepped out greeted warmly by locals along the way



"Rylie, you're back! I told Selah you were coming -she's so happy, she's slaughtering a chicken right now!"



Rylie responded with warmth, greeting familiar faces,while Brad followed, enduring the curious stares with grace.



As they entered the courtyard, Selah was seated outside, cleaning the chicken. Word of Rylie's return had traveled fast.



Selah stood up, wiping her hands on her apron,her smile warm though a subtle concern lingered in her eyes. "Oh, Rylie... and you brought a guest?"



Brad softened his usual military posture and greeted her politely



Selah took one look at the tall, striking Brad and paused for a beat, clearly recognizing him."Isn't this 



s just a guest," Rylie interjected quickly. joining us for dinner. Nothing more, so don't overthink it."



Selah nodded. "I'll prepare a few extra dishes, then."


"There's no need to go overboard," Brad added, "Just a regular meal is fine"



Rylie rolled up her sleeves and turned to him. "You're the guest-go sit in the backyard living room until dinner's ready."



She took the knife from Selah, crouched down, and began preparing the chicken herself. Her movements were practiced and efficient, her blade cutting precisely at each joint.



Brad didn't leave. He leaned against the doorframe,watching with curiosity."Didn't think you knew how to do this."



"Back at the Kirk estate," Rylie replied without looking up, her voice flat. "This was just part of the daily routine."



As soon as he heard that, Brad's eyes narrowed slightly.

###Chapter 96 Propose
Selah set a small bowl of greens on the table, a quiet sigh slipping from her lips. "Rylie's had to grow up fast She's been through more than her share with the Kirk family."



"That won't be her story anymore," Brad replied under his breath.



A bit slow to catch his words, Selah lifted her head."Huh?"



Brad gave a faint smile. "Oh, nothing. Don't mind me."



As night settled in.



Rylie lent Selah a hand, working together to finish up the cooking. When everything was ready, the three of them sat down to share the meal.



With her usual warmth, Selah offered a polite smile."It's just a simple meal - please, make yourself comfortable."



Brad took a bite of the stewed chicken, surprised by how tender and flavorful it was - far better than anything his private chef had prepared



Though he wasn't known for having much of an appetite. tonight was different He found himself reaching for seconds without hesitation. It was the first time since his illness that he'd eaten this much.



Selah let out a soft laugh. "Young people always eat well."



Peering curiously into the soup pot, Brad offered a genuine compliment. "This is excellent. What's your secret?"



Selah smiled warmly. "That's thanks to Rylie. She's got a habit of wandering into the mountains to gather herbs and such. Says they're good for the body."



Rylie gave a small nod, adding in her usual calm tone,"Just a few leaves that help boost immunity. Eating them often keeps you healthy."



Watching how much Brad seemed to enjoy the meal,Selah couldn't help but smile. Knowing the kind of man he was-and knowing he'd protect Rylie-she offered kindly, "If you ever want more, feel free to stop by HaloFlow Pharmacy. Even if Rylie's not around,I'Ll gladly cook for you."



Before Brad could respond, Rylie cut in with a playful tone, saying, "Your cooking is amazing, but he's got a chef waiting on him at home."



Choosing to ignore her, Brad looked at Selah and thanked her directly. "Then I'll gladly take you up on that oftel



Rylie shot him a look, half surprised by how cheekily he accepted an elderly woman's kindness like it was nothing



Still, seeing Selah's smile only deepen, she let it slide without further comment.



After they'd finished eating and rested for a while,Brad stood up to leave. Rylie stayed seated, her tone casual. "I'm spending the night here with Selah. You go on ahead."



Brad gave a slight nod. "Okay then."



After watching his car drive away, Rylie returned inside and sat at the coffee table, asking Selah,there something on your mind you wanted to tell me?"



With a quiet sigh, Selah shook her head. "It's nothing,really."



Rylie knew better than to press. Letting out a sigh of her own, she dropped the subject.



But when morning came, the unexpected arrival of the Dury family caught her completely off guard.



After freshening up, Rylie stepped into the courtyard -only to stop short at the sight before her. Scattered across the ground were several boxes. Out of curiosity, she flipped one open Inside lay a pile of jewelry-gaudy pieces with lackluster stones. Nothing impressive, though the lot might fetch a few hundred thousand.



By then,neighbors had already gathered near the gate,craning their necks to watch the scene unfold.



Seeing Rylie come out, they teased with smiles,"Which young gentleman has come to propose to Rylie,bringing so much stuff? It's worth a few million,isn't it?"



Her brows pulled together in confusion. Propose?What did that mean? Was she somehow getting married without even knowing it?



One of the pharmacists from HaloFlow Pharmacy stepped outside and, spotting Rylie standing dazed in the courtyard, called out,"Why are you just standing there? Everyone's already gathered in the front hall."



"Who's here to propose?" Rylie finally snapped out of it and asked her first question of the morning.


The pharmacist blinked, looking puzzled. "The Dury family. You really didn't know? They're already in a meeting with Selah."



A stunned look crossed Rylie's face."They've got guts,showing up here with a proposal like this!"
 Bi the time she walked into the front hall, she found the small consultation room packed with Dury family members, all crowding around Selah as if they were already part of the family



Rylie strode in, her tone deliberately sharp. "What's all this about? Did Mr. Fred Dury suddenly come down with some rare illness and pay in advance with all these gifts?"



"Oh, don't be silly." Selah quickly pulled Rylie to her side, giving her hand a reassuring pat. "The Dury family is here to talk about your engagement.Have you forgotten? You were promised to them as a child."



With a raised brow, Rylie answered coolly, "Pretty sure I broke off that engagement-publicly,too."



Selah blinked, clearly caught off guard. "You did? You called it off yourself?"



Catching the look on Selah's face, Rylie finally realized where all the confusion had started.



A soft, helpless laugh slipped from Rylie's lips."Wait a second-did you honestly think I got dumped? Is that why you called the Dury family here, trying to patch things up?"



Selah's face froze with awkwardness, while Fred stepped forward, forcing a sheepish smile. "Rylie, come on I know the feelings between us are still there You still have love for me Whatever happened before- that's on me. Can't we just move past it and start over?"



Standing nearby, Fred's parents wore strained, eager smiles. Octavia quickly jumped in, her tone honeyed."It's my fault,really.I should've raised him better. From now on, Rylie, you'll have the final say in anything involving the Dury family. Let me make it up to you,alright?"



Rylie gave a faint, polite smile. "It was my mentor's mistake for arranging this. I owe you an apology,but as for marriage-there's no future for me and Fred."



Selah faltered, unsure. "Rylie, are you really saying this because you mean it? I heard from the neighbors...they said it was all over the news, how you were publicly dumped. I thought you were heartbroken. I don't want my mistakes to cause you more pain."



With a soft laugh, Rylie pressed her fingers to her temple. "So this is what's been weighing on you these past few days?"



Selah reached up to cup Rylie's cheek, her eyes filled with quiet concern. Though she had worried about ruining Rylie's future, it seemed that fear had been unnecessary all along.
Ryle let out a light sigh and patiently explained. The Dury family isn't as respectable as you think Their so -called 'fine young man' was dating me while sneaking around with Stacey. He wanted to string us both along -sisters, no less. Would you honestly accept that?"



At those words, Selah's face turned red with anger.Hands trembling, she snatched up the broom from the corner and stormed toward the Dury family. "Leave!All of you, get out of my house! How dare you treat me like a fool!"



Fred ducked awkwardly, flustered as he tried to defend himself. "Wait, please... Let me explain-"


"Enough with your lies!" Selah swung the broom again,faster than anyone expected from someone her age."If you think you can bully Rylie, you'll have to deal with me first!"

###Chapter 97 Boyfriend
With Selah's fierce resolve, the Dury family was thrown out completely - along with several large boxes of proposal gifts.



Rylie looked them in the eye and warned, "Don't come near me again. If you do, I won't hold back next time."



The Dury family finally gathered their things and left in silence.Their departure didn't go unnoticed-several neighbors witnessed the scene.



Evie Clayton, who always loved a spectacle, stood at the door snacking and remarked, "Those gifts add up to a few million. Rylie, why won't you agree to such a good family? If you marry into them, you won't have to struggle keeping that little pharmacy afloat. You'd be living the good life."



Rylie paused at the door before closing it and said calmly, "A man who can't be faithful won't bring happiness, no matter how rich he is."



Evie scoffed, "Marriage is just about daily life. As long as there's money, what's the big deal? All men stray.Just turn a blind eye. Everyone knows you were kicked out of the Kirk family, and your engagement was broken off. Life can't be easy now."

Not everyone knew Rylie had become the granddaughter of a powerful business magnate -news didn't spread as fast outside the elite circles.



Before Rylie could reply, Selah came out, her expression sharp. "Money isn't everything. True happiness comes from love and respect. If he truly loves and protects her, that's all that matters."



Rylie couldn't stand women who gossiped and dragged others down. She cut in suddenly, saying,"Didn't your daughter marry into a family that moved here from another city? New money, right? How's that going?"



Just then, another neighbor, Leona Ruiz, strolled by with a basket of vegetables and chimed in, "She came back the other day asking for money. That so-called rich husband has a mistress, and rumor says she's pregnant with a son. He's showering her with gifts too."



Evie's face darkened at once. "What nonsense are you spouting?"



Leona didn't back down. "You don't want people talking about you, but you're quick to badmouth Rylie just because HaloFlow Pharmacy charges a little more for your medicine? Those same medicines cost twice as much at big chain stores. HaloFlow raised prices just a bit, and you start spreading rumors?"

Evie's face flushed with anger. "I didn't start any rumors! It's all in the news-plain as day. Rylie's an abandoned woman with a broken engagement.In our village, that's unwanted. The Dury family wants to marry her, and I'm just looking out for her!"


Leona snapped back, "Save it! Rylie already has a boyfriend-handsome,too,with that upright military vibe. Did you see that luxury car parked near the alley?My son said it's a global limited edition worth nearly ten millions. The Dury family's gifts can't compare!"



Rylie blinked.Boyfriend? What boyfriend?



Selah, on the other hand, seemed to catch on. Her eyes lit up as she took Rylie's hand. "Oh, it's him?That's great. I've always thought he was a good kid. A little thin maybe, but steady and kind. And he's good -looking,too."



Leona nodded excitedly. "Exactly! He's worlds ahead of Evie's flashy son-in-law."



Evie, clearly irritated by the comparison, muttered,"I've never seen this so-called boyfriend. Does he only visit at night? That's suspicious. What if he already has a family or a girlfriend? I'm just saying-I don't want Rylie to get hurt."



Selah hesitated and looked at Rylie with concern."He's probably in his thirties. Have you asked him carefully?



Rylie sighed, a little overwhelmed. "This is ridiculous He's not my boyfriend."



Evie jumped on that. "Then why do you always meet him at night? Are you two hiding something? Rylie,you can't be doing things you'll regret!"



Leona added with a playful smile, "Why not just ask him? We've got nothing to hide."



Selah now looked even more unsure.



Though Rylie was irritated by the gossip, Selah's worried expression made her give in. She pulled out her phone and sent a message.



"Are you free? Selah thinks you're my boyfriend. Can you help me clear it up?"



To her surprise, he replied almost instantly. "I'm free."


Since he was up for it, Rylie turned to Selah. "I'll call him."



She tapped the video call icon.



Moments Later, the screen lit up.


Brad appeared in a dark suit, seated in a leather chair,his expression calm and eyes sharp. Behind him was a wide screen and a massive floor-to-ceiling window showing the landmarks of a bustling financial district.



Rylie raised an eyebrow."Are you in a meeting? I can call back."



Brad set his pen down and answered gently, "No need.It's just wrapping up."



Across the room, his team sat frozen. Wrapping up?What was wrapping up? Just a moment ago, Brad had been scolding them over internal issues at Morgan Group. Layoffs were looming. Now, one video call later, their strict boss had transformed into a charming gentleman.


Whoever was on the call had clearly saved them.Before this call, they were unsure if they would be the next ones to be dealt with by Brad.


Brad glanced around the long table. That was enough



Several department heads quietly began packing up,sneaking glances at the screen. Some whispered,wondering who could soften Brad's gaze like that.



"No bother at all-my team just stepped out," Brad said calmly. From the cracked door, a few team members could still hear his warm baritone drifting out. One even joked that it had to be Brad's twin in there.

 Brock. who knew better than anyone, smiled faintly 'That's what love does to him."
###Chapter 98 She's My Girlfriend
Brad rose from his chair, leaving the top buttons of his black shirt undone. His cool and distant manner made his good looks even more striking. He looked straight at Rylie through the screen. "Where's Selah?"



"She's right here with me." Rylie turned her phone,showing Selah and a few others seated beside her.



When Brad leaned into the light, his appearance stunned the older women for a moment. His charm hit them so fast that it left their senses scrambled.



Evie couldn't help but compare him to her own son-in -Law. Brad looked far more refined, even through a screen.



She asked,"Leona told me you're dating Rylie now. Is that true?"



Brad gave a gentle smile. "I am.Does that bother you?"



Rylie blink<ed fast, surprised. She leaned in toward the screen, trying to catch his eyes.


Wasn't he supposed to make things easier? Why was he only making it worse?

But he looked right into the camera and smiled like nothing was wrong. The sunlight washed over his face.and those women fell for it just like that



Leona followed up with another question. "What does your family do? We just want to make sure Rylie isn't being misled."



Brad nodded politely. "I'm not sure why there's been any confusion. My family's been in the military for generations. As a soldier, I've always held myself to a higher moral standard."



Leona turned her head slightly and gave Evie a look."A soldier? That's wonderful." Then she added as she glanced at Evie, "And to think we believed Rylie had been left behind. She's clearly moved on to someone even better."



Brad let out a low laugh. "She didn't chase me. I begged her to give me a chance."



Selah finally smiled, her tension fading. "I'm glad to hear that."



But Rylie already knew Brad had gone too far. If he kept spinning stories like this, no one would know what to believe.


She pulled the phone away and said, "That's enough.He's working today. We shouldn't bother him."
Once she got Evie and Leona out the door. Selah went back to her patients. Rylie stepped into the yard.phone still in hand. She turned her camera back on.Have you forgotten what I had asked you to do earlier?"



Brad smiled softly. "Wasn't this better? Selah's calm now. If she figured out it was a lie, the neighborhood gossip would've hit her harder."



Even without a full explanation, Brad had already figured out what was going on.



He leaned against the window,looking straight at her."Do you think I handled it wrong?"



Rylie let out a slow sigh. "Let's just leave it as is."



"Alright." His gaze stayed on her. There was something unreadable in his eyes. His voice dropped low and soft."My girl."



Her chest tightened as she ended the call.







Since the Wesdown International Piano Competition's preliminary round had been suspended, Rylie's name didn't appear on the list. Neither Paola nor her circle could find her anywhere.
Isabeila looked over the list and smiled "Paola, you came in third With a bit more effort, you can take the whole thing I wonder how Rylie feels right now-must be humiliating not even making it past the first round.



Paola kept her smile soft."I've got dinner with Johnny and the others, so I can't stay long."



Isabella's face brightened. "I wish I could come too."


"Okay, let's go together. I'll mention it to Johnny. I'm sure he won't mind," said Paola.



Isabella clung to her arm, cheerful. "You're the best friend I've ever had."



Paola smiled again, but it never reached her eyes. She wasn't just doing this out of kindness. She knew Rylie would attend the gathering. Using Isabella to spread the rumor about Rylie failing the preliminaries seemed convenient.



Rylie, on the other hand, had received the same invitation. She remembered Johnny. He once spoke up for her. His family held power in the shipping business.



She decided to go but chose to come late. She had more urgent matters to deal with.


The Kirks had given up what little they had left to fund Nicolas lea surgery even letting go of their home


Rylie booked the surgery at the military hospital. She told the family that only the patient would be allowed to see her.



They had no choice but to agree. It was a matter of life and death.



When Rylie arrived at the hospital, Rory had already anesthetized Nicolas. He looked at the girl walking in,his gaze complex. "Why did you change your mind and decide to save the Kirk family member? Nicolas 'legs are difficult to treat. He's delayed treatment for so long that even if he recovers, he'll be crippled."



She let out a short laugh. "This isn't about kindness.It's a fair exchange. I don't deal in loss."



"The Kirk company isn't worth much," Rory said. "Even if you take most of their shares, you'll gain little."



"I know," she said. "But I don't want it for the money."After pulling on her gloves, she walked up to Nicolas and looked down at his pale face. "That company's just leverage."



The Garretts had control over assets once held by the Owens. Kendrick's plan was simple. Let her hold ground in Crolens, a place where the Owens lacked footing.

She picked up the scalpel. "We're starting."


Because of the extent of the damage, the operation ran seven hours straight. By the end of it, fatigue was all over her face. Still, it was a success, and Rory didn't hold back his praise.



"That was remarkable. I filmed it-it'll help our med students." He added, "We've got a little dinner tonight.Just a few folks from the department. You in?"



She removed her gloves, pulled off her mask, and reached for a drink. "I've got another event tonight.I'm late as it is. It wouldn't be right to miss it."



"You're not who you used to be," said Rory. "Make sure you don't stay up too late."



By the time she got to the venue, the gathering was already underway.



She opened the door to the private room and heard Isabella's loud laugh. "Well, if it isn't our little piano star,Miss Owen. We thought you skipped out because you didn't pass the Wesdown preliminaries. I almost dropped by your house to cheer you up."



Laughter broke out around the table. Paola sat beside Johnny, sipping red wine like it was part of a routine.A small look of pride crept across her face.
Johnny looked like he was about to speak,but then Rylie walked in. Her expression stayed calm.



"Sorry I'm late. I had a surgery." She tossed her coat over a chair and gave the room a glance. "Did I miss anything interesting?"


"Quite a bit," Isabella said, her tone sharp.were just saying how some people aim too high by joinìng the Wesdown competition."
###Chapter 99 Johnny's Gathering
A young man chimed in with a smirk, "Playing the piano is an art-it takes elegance and skill, not just money."



The room burst into laughter.


Paola waved a hand dismissively, pretending to be gracious. "Alright, everyone, let's not be harsh. Even though Rylie didn't make it past the preliminaries, her courage is admirable. I'm sure she'll succeed someday."



Isabella laughed loudly, covering her mouth with mock shock. "Courage? Shouldn't it be cheekiness? If it were me, I'd be too embarrassed to show my face.But some people have thick skin- failing the first round and still showing up at such a fancy event!"



The laughter only grew louder.



A few rich kids exchanged amused glances. One of them even pushed a wine glass toward Rylie, silently suggesting she drink her shame away.



Johnny's expression darkened. He set his wine glass down with a firm thud. "That's enough."
The room fell silent at once.


Johnny poured a glass of juice, walked over to Rylie,and quietly took the wine glass away. "You look tired.Don't harm your health over this. Try some orange juice instead."



Rylie took the glass. "Thank you."


Johnny nodded and rested a hand lightly on the back of her chair. His gaze swept the room as he spoke."Everyone here is my guest. Rylie is my guest too. If anyone can't show respect, I won't hesitate to ask them to leave."



No one had expected Johnny to defend her. Paola's face stiffened as she awkwardly adjusted her dress,trying to hide the resentment in her eyes.



When she looked up again, her expression had softened into a polite smile. "Johnny's right. We're all friends here-let's be civil."



Isabella quickly changed the subject. "Weren't we supposed to have a yacht party? When are we heading out?"



Johnny replied casually, "The yacht is ready. You can head over anytime."



He turned to Rylie. "But Miss Owen, could you wait a moment? I have a favor to ask."



Rylie nodded. "Sure."


Just as Johnny was about to leave with her, Paola stood up abruptly. "Johnny, where are you taking Rylie?Is this somewhere the rest of us can't go?"



All eyes turned to the two of them. The air grew tense with quiet speculation.



Someone cracked a joke, "Are you ditching our lovely Paola for a private moment with Miss Owen? Since when did your taste change so much?"



Paola looked visibly hurt, her eyes locked on Johnny."So this really is a private date? Maybe I shouldn't stay here after all."



Isabella chimed in, "Johnny, say something! You can't seriously be planning a date with Rylie-you've only met her once!"



Rylie raised an eyebrow. "Now I'm curious too.What do you need my help with?"



Johnny let out a resigned sigh. "My grandmother's a collector. She recently wanted to donate a set of ancient jewelry to the museum. It's said to be a thousand years old, but the museum's expert says it's fake.We invited other appraisers, and they all agreed -it's a counterfeit."
Rylie tilted her head. "How much did she pay for it?"


"Twenty million dollars," Johnny replied.


Gasps filled the room. Even Rylie blinked in disbelief.



No wonder Johnny had come to her again- this wasn't just about pride. It was about a twenty-thousand-million-dollar mistake.



Paola couldn't help herself. "Johnny, this is a professional matter. If all the experts say it's fake,what can Rylie possibly do? She's not a magician or something, unable to turn a fake into a real one."



Johnny looked directly at Rylie. "After what happened at the Buckley family's gala, I believe in your judgment. You clearly know your craft. I'd really appreciate it if you'd take another look."



Rylie gave a slight nod. "Alright. Let's go."



Johnny turned with her."Let's go."



Isabella suddenly stepped in front of the door and shouted, "Mr. Reid, have you had too much to drink?The news about Rylie plagiarizing Paola's sheet music is everywhere. She's done it before! And the jewelry appraisal at the gala? That was just luck. Don't trust her!"
Johnny's expression turned cold. His voice dropped "P'll judge right and wrong for myself." He stared at Isabella, his tone biting. "Besides, I don't remember inviting you. Paola insisted on bringing you."



Isabella turned pale. "I..."


Johnny looked at Paola next. "Please keep your friends in check. She's rude and lacks basic manners.Don't bring her next time."



Isabella stood frozen, stunned speechless. Paola's face turned stiff with embarrassment.
###Chapter 100 Encountering Robbers On The Road
Rylie went along with Johnny as he returned to the Reid estate.



The manor stood by the bay, built completely from white marble. Sapphire mosaics stretched across the domed ceilings, creating ripples like waves frozen in stone.



When they stepped into the main hall, the chandelier above scattered light in every direction. The reflection danced across the walls, giving the room the look of a palace beneath the sea.



Paintings lined the hall,each one showing a different cargo ship once owned by the Reid family. Every canvas told a piece of their long-standing maritime legacy.



"My grandmother's waiting in the treasure room," said Johnny as he walked beside her down a qquiet corridor.Past the windows, a row of private yachts shimmered in the moonlight, docked neatly just beyond the glass.



Inside that room, an older woman with silver hair let out a quiet sigh as she stared at a locked safe.
The moment she noticed Rylie, her dull gaze turned clear. "Is this the girl who pointed out the Buckley heirloom was fake? Please, sit down."



Rylie returned the greeting politely, though something inside the safe had caught her eye. Inside sat a set of jewelry, old and valuable. At the center was a rare ruby, its deep red glow pulsing under the light like a heart.



"That's the one," she murmured. Hulda reached inside carefully. "The appraisers said the gem's cut was too modern. They insisted it was fake."



Rylie slipped on a pair of gloves and grabbed a magnifying glass. She leaned in, studying every line and angle. Her finger drifted over the stone's surface and stopped where the edge dipped slightly.


"This isn't fake," she said without hesitation. "It's genuine. And it's worth a great deal."



The older woman's hands shook. Her cup dropped to the floor. "Real? But they were all so sure this is fake."


"They made an error," said Rylie, lifting the ruby toward the light. "Look here. You'll see tiny processing marks, but they weren't made with modern tools.They're from a lost technique used by the Osmond family. They were famous for restoring art pieces centuries ago. People who don't know that history will misread it."



She continued, "The Bocross craftsmen-masters in their time - were the ones who developed this cutting method to bring damaged heirlooms back to life. The knowledge didn't survive. That's why modern experts confuse it with forgery."



While she explained, Johnny couldn't take his eyes off her. Her poise, her mind, the way she moved-all of it held him still.



Across the room, Hulda saw the way her grandson looked at Rylie and immediately understood what he was thinking.



After finishing her explanation, Rylie looked up and asked softly, "Any questions left?"



Hulda exhaled in relief. "I knew l wasn't wrong to trust my instincts. This pieceis irreplaceable. But how could someone your age see what even the experts missed?"



Rylie gave a faint smile. "I read a lot. I've also spent years learning about jewelry. That helps. And this kind of piece needs to stay at a steady twenty degrees Celsius. Your vault mixes artifacts that need different storage. It's safer to keep them apart."



Before anyone could respond, a voice came from the doorway. "Madam, the appraiser from Crolens Museum is here."
Hulda showed a warm smile at Rylie and explained calmly, "Some folks from Okvale Museum said this was a fake. They even offered to discard it for me.I refused. I brought it home, planning to get another opinion from Crolens. My grandson then suggested inviting you too. I hope you won't take that the wrong way, Miss Rylie."



Rylie nodded. "No offense taken. It's smart to get more than one view."



Hulda turned to the servant and asked them to bring the appraiser inside.



The man who entered looked close to eighty,and carried himself like someone who'd spent decades in museum work. His expertise in antique jewelry was evident.



He took his time examining the gem under a magnifying glass, speaking quietly with Rylie as he worked.



Eventually, he straightened up, his tone certain."Those folks from Okvale have no idea what they're talking about. This is the real deal. If you ever want to donate it, our museum would be honored."


A content smile crossed Hulda's face. "That was my plan. My grandson will bring it over for you."
The appraiser then approached Rylie and handed her a card. "Take this. Your insight and knowledge are remarkable. Did you study this in school? We could really use someone like you at the museum."



Rylie took the card with a smile. "It's just a personal interest. My background's actually in medicine."


The old man blinked, clearly surprised."Your generation keeps raising the bar."



Johnny carefully stored the jewelry in a protective box and turned toward her. "I'mn heading that way myself. Let me give you a ride."



Hulda walked her to the door herself, her grip on Rylie's hand warm and sincere. "Come by whenever you'd like. If there's anywhere you wish to visit,just let Johnny know. Our ships can take you anywhere."



Touched by the gesture, Rylie looked at her and smiled. "Thank you, Mrs. Reid."



Hulda let go, glanced at Johnny, then watched them go with a quiet smile.



Johnny placed the box securely in the rear seat and started the car. They followed 'close behind the museum vehicle as it rolled onto the highway.



He glanced to the side, where the sea met the road.
The moon had begun to rise, its light dancing on the waves and painting the ocean with a silver glow.



He turned to Rylie in the passenger seat, then reached forward and tapped a button. The roof folded back.Cool wind rushed in and swept through her hair,making her blink against it.


"Is there anything you're not good at?" he asked suddenly.


Rylie turned her gaze to the sea. "What?"


Johnny gave a small laugh. "Medicine. Music.Appraisal. Is there anything you can't master?"


Rylie gave a playful smile. "I just taught myself these things on the side. They're nothing more than hobbies.I know a little about each, but not enough to call myself an expert."



Johnny laughed under his breath, his fingers tapping lightly against the wheel. "Hobbies? Those 'pastimes'put seasoned professionals to shame."



The breeze caught Rylie's hair. She tucked it behind her ear and glanced at him. "Was that your way of paying me a compliment?"



"I was just being honest." Johnny's eyés narrowed as he looked into the rearview mirror. "That black car's been behind us for three turns now."
Rylie cast a brief glance at the mirror. The SUV was following from a distance that wasn't too far,but not close enough to seem innocent. She leaned slightly toward him. "Who else knows about the jewelry?"



"Only my grandmother. The man from Crolens Museum too. Aside from them..." He tightened his grip on the wheel. "The folks from Okvale Museum."



She looked back toward the mirror. "Okvale? They've been in the city for years. Could they be resorting to something like this?"



Her eyes turned sharp as she added, "That's a professional tail. Pull over. I'll take it from here."


Johnny blinked. "I can drive too, you know.Why would I hand over the wheel?"



Rylie shot back, "Keep arguing, and we'll lose everything- including that expensive jewelry. Pull over or get robbed."



As Johnny hit the brakes, the SUV suddenly accelerated toward them! Without missing a beat,Rylie unlatched her seatbelt,vaulted over the console,and shovedhim toward the other seat. "Strap in!"



She moved so fast that he didn't even realize what had happened until he found himself on the passenger side.
A loud crash followed. The SUV rammed into the back of their car.



Rylie fixed her gaze on the rearview mirror, her voice low as she commanded, "Get help on the line."



Johnny pulled out his phone and dialed quickly,glancing at the back window. "They're gaining on us!"



The off-road vehicle jerked to a stop. Four masked men leapt out, metal rods in hand, closing in without a word.
