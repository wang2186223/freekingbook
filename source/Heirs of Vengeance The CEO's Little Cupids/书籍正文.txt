"Left bleeding at the altar, Serena rebuilds her empire—until billionaire twins appoint her as mommy. Can she trust their guarded CEO father? Or will old enemies destroy their second chance?"
********
Serena's POV

I awoke to a world bathed in heat and haze, my body a live wire humming with need. The room around me was unfamiliar-a luxurious hotel suite, dimly lit, with shadows dancing across the walls from a single bedside lamp. The vast bed beneath me had silk sheets that felt cool against my burning skin, a stark contrast to the fire raging inside. I shifted, and my own clothes-a soft blouse and tight jeans-clung to my curves, suddenly feeling too constricting, too tight. The blouse had ridden up slightly, exposing a sliver of my stomach, while the jeans hugged my hips and thighs, doing nothing to hide the hard peaks of my nipples or the insistent ache pulsing between my legs.

My head swam as I tried to piece together how I'd gotten here. Memories flickered like broken film-laughter, a crowded gala, the clink of a glass, someone handing me a drink. Then, darkness. Now, this: a stranger in an armchair across the room, his silhouette sharp against the glow of city lights seeping through a large window. He was watching me, his face half-hidden, but there was something about him-a flicker of recognition I couldn't grasp through the fog clouding my mind.

"Serena," he said, his voice low and rough, sending a shiver racing down my spine. "You're awake."

I tried to respond, but my throat was dry, my tongue heavy. "Who are you?" I managed, the words barely a whisper.

He rose and crossed the room, each step deliberate, until he stood beside the bed. Up close, he was striking-sharp jaw, piercing eyes, a body that promised strength beneath his clothes. "It's me," he said softly. "You don't remember?"

I squinted, searching his face, but the haze wouldn't lift. "I I don't know." My voice trembled, not from fear, but from the overwhelming desire surging through me. My skin prickled, hypersensitive; every breath I took seemed to stoke the fire in my core.

He sat on the edge of the bed, close enough that I could feel his warmth. "You've been drugged," he explained, his tone gentle but strained. "Someone slipped something into your drink. I brought you here to keep you safe."

The words should have startled me, but they barely registered. All I could focus on was the need clawing at me, raw and relentless. My body didn't care about explanations-it craved touch, release, *him*. I reached out, my fingers brushing his arm, and the contact jolted me like a spark. I gasped, my chest heaving.

"I need" I couldn't finish, but my eyes locked with his, pleading.

He swallowed hard, his gaze dropping to where my blouse had shifted, revealing the curve of my waist, and the way my jeans accentuated my hips. "Serena, this isn't right. You're not yourself."

But his protest felt distant, meaningless against the tide of lust drowning me. I gripped his shirt, pulling him closer, my nails digging into the fabric. "Please," I begged, my voice hoarse. "I can't stand it. Help me."

For a moment, he resisted, his eyes searching mine, torn between restraint and something darker-desire, mirroring my own. Then, slowly, he leaned in, and his lips brushed mine. The kiss was tentative at first, testing, but I surged forward, hungry, desperate, and it ignited into something fierce. Our mouths clashed, tongues tangling, and I tasted the faint salt of his skin.

I tugged at his shirt, fingers fumbling with buttons until I could push it open, revealing a chest sculpted with muscle. My hands roamed over him, greedy, feeling the heat of him beneath my palms. He groaned into my mouth, and I felt the hard length of him pressing against me through his pants, a promise of what I craved.

He pulled back, breathless, his eyes dark with conflict. "Serena, are you sure? I don't want to take advantage-"

"I need you," I cut him off, my voice thick with want. "Please, don't make me wait."

With a low, defeated sound, he surrendered. He helped me out of my blouse, his fingers trembling as he undid the buttons, exposing the lace bra beneath. He sucked in a breath, his gaze fixed on the sight before him, and I arched my back, letting him see more. He deftly unclasped the bra, and my breasts spilled free, his hands immediately cupping them, kneading the soft flesh, thumbs grazing the sensitive peaks, drawing a moan from my lips.

Next, he worked on my jeans, peeling them down along with my panties, leaving me completely bare before him. His eyes raked over my body-my full breasts, the dip of my waist, the glistening wetness between my thighs-and I reveled in it, in being seen, wanted. "God, you're beautiful," he murmured, his voice raw.

His mouth found my breast, lips closing around a nipple, sucking gently as his tongue flicked over the sensitive bud. I arched into him, a cry tearing from my throat as pleasure spiked through me. His hand kneaded my other breast, thumb circling the taut peak, and I writhed beneath him, the sensations too much and not enough all at once.

Then, he trailed lower, kissing a path down my stomach, his breath hot against my skin. He paused at the apex of my thighs, looking up at me, a silent question in his eyes. I nodded, frantic, spreading my legs wider, offering myself. His smile was wicked as he dipped his head, and when his tongue brushed my swollen clit, I nearly came undone. He licked me, slow and deliberate, tasting my wetness, then sucked gently, drawing a scream from my lips. His fingers joined in, sliding inside me, curling to stroke that perfect spot, and the world shattered.

I came hard, my body convulsing, waves of ecstasy ripping through me. But even as the climax faded, the drug-fueled fire raged on, insatiable. I needed more-I needed *him*.

I pulled him up, kissing him fiercely, tasting myself on his tongue. "Now," I demanded, breathless. "I want you inside me."

He settled between my legs, his cock nudging my entrance, slick with my arousal. He hesitated one last time, searching my face, but I locked my legs around his waist, urging him on. With a deep groan, he thrust into me, filling me completely. I gasped, my walls stretching around his thickness, the sensation exquisite and overwhelming.

He moved, slow at first, each stroke a delicious torment, then faster, deeper, as I met him thrust for thrust. Our bodies slapped together, the rhythm primal, the air thick with our gasps and moans. I clutched at him, nails scoring his back, lost in the feel of him-his hardness driving into me, the friction building me higher.

"Harder," I panted, desperate. "Don't stop."

He obeyed, pounding into me with wild abandon, the bed creaking beneath us. Pleasure coiled tight, a storm gathering in my core, and then it broke-a second orgasm, fiercer than the first, tearing through me like lightning. I screamed his name, though I still didn't know it, my body trembling as he followed, his own release spilling hot inside me, his groan echoing mine. But then a voice cut through the haze, sharp and grounding.

"Serena Serena."

I blinked, and the dim hotel room vanished. Bright lights flooded my vision, and I found myself back in the present, sitting in a cushioned chair with my makeup artist, Jen, peering at me. Her hand rested lightly on my shoulder, her brows furrowed with concern.

"Are you okay, Serena?" she asked, her voice soft but insistent.

My heart was still racing, the vividness of the daydream leaving me flustered. I felt a flush creep up my neck, and I quickly forced a smile to cover it. "I'm fine," I said, though my voice came out a little shaky. "Just drifted off for a second."

Jen tilted her head, studying me for a moment, but she didn't push. Instead, she picked up a lipstick tube and held it up. "Okay then, lipstick. What color are you feeling?" She paused, a teasing smile tugging at her lips. "We might need to speed things up a bit-I don't want to keep your fiancé waiting too long."

###chapter 2
Serena's POV

I stood nervously in the bathroom of Manhattan's most prestigious hotel, adjusting my custom-made wedding gown. The dress felt tight around me, but I didn't notice the pressure, completely immersed in the joy of the upcoming ceremony. Three years with Ian Whitmore had led us to this moment. We had weathered many storms and faced countless discussions, overcoming the whispers, sideways glances, and not-so-subtle accusations. Despite everything, I had believed in us. In him.
Taking a deep breath, I stepped out of the bathroom. The rooftop garden was a vision in white and gold, with roses and ribbons gently swaying in the autumn breeze. Everything felt surreal, like a dream I never wanted to end.
Ian was already waiting for me at the entrance, his expression initially cold. As our eyes met, he paused briefly before a subtle smile softened his features. He reached out, taking my hand with a measured gentleness, pulling me closer. "You look absolutely stunning today," he said, his voice calm and restrained. He leaned in, placing a brief kiss on my forehead.
I smiled, my heart swelling with emotion. "Thank you, Ian. I couldn't have imagined a more per-"
A deafening crack split the air.
GUNSHOT.
For a moment, my mind went completely blank. The world seemed to stop, sounds fading into a distant hum. Then reality came crashing back with brutal force - the acrid smell of gunpowder, the distant screams gradually growing louder, the thundering of my own heartbeat in my ears. Primal fear surged through my body like ice water in my veins.
My hands found Ian instinctively, fingers clutching at his suit jacket with desperate strength. He was my anchor, my safety, my protection. I pressed myself against him, trembling, my knuckles white from gripping his arms so tightly.

"Ian! RUN!" My voice was high with panic as screams erupted from every direction. The peaceful garden transformed into a scene of chaos - chairs toppling, glasses shattering, guests scrambling over each other in blind panic.
But something was wrong. Despite my desperate grip, Ian's attention was elsewhere. His eyes darted frantically across the crowd, searching. "I'm sorry," he whispered, forcefully prying my fingers from his arms before I could process what was happening. He wrenched his arms from my grasp, leaving me swaying and vulnerable.
"Ian, please!" I screamed after him as he plunged into the panicked crowd. My voice was lost in the cacophony of screams and shattering glass. "Don't leave me here!"
The world became a blur of white and gold, now tainted with terror. Guests pushed past me, some knocking into my shoulders, others nearly trampling me in their desperation to escape. The sweet scent of roses mixed with the acrid smell of gunpowder. My wedding dress, once a symbol of joy, now felt like a cage, restricting my movements as I stumbled through the chaos.
Through tears, I caught a glimpse of Ian's retreating figure. He was sprinting across the ballroom floor. His arms were wrapped protectively around a woman in a pale blue dress-my step-sister Nina. Her face was buried in his chest as he guided her toward the emergency exit.
The sight pierced deeper than any bullet could have. A surge of betrayal and despair washed over me, making it hard to breathe.  
In my desperation to flee, I tripped over a fallen table, sending me stumbling into a broken centerpiece. Sharp pain lanced through my right ankle as glass shards bit into my skin through the delicate satin of my wedding shoes. I tried to call out to him one last time, but my voice cracked with despair.
More shots rang out. The screaming intensified. I was alone, abandoned by the man I trusted most, in a sea of chaos and terror. My vision began to blur, the world spinning around me. As consciousness slipped away, I felt warm hands lifting me from the floor - a final comfort as everything faded to black.
I woke to the harsh lights of a hospital room, my head throbbing with each beep of the heart monitor. The antiseptic smell made my stomach turn, or maybe it was the memories flooding back.
The door swings open, and my entire body tenses instinctively. Every nerve ending still feels raw from the shooting. My father, Lawrence Sinclair, marches in. Angela follows with her usual calculated grace, and then comes Nina.

The sight of her makes my stomach clench with revulsion. Less than twenty-four hours ago, I watched her pressed against Ian's chest as he carried her to safety, while I lay bleeding and abandoned on that marble floor. Now she stands there, perfectly composed in her designer outfit, wearing an expression of concern that makes my skin crawl.

"Oh, Serena, are you okay?" Each word drips with fake gentleness that makes me want to scream. My hands clutch the hospital sheets, knuckles white, as I fight the urge to throw something at her perfect face.

I glare at her, silence burning in my throat. The betrayal sits like acid in my chest.

My father's face tightens, his businessman's mask cracking with irritation. "What's your problem? Nina's worried about you!"

A laugh escapes me, bitter and harsh. "Worried? Yeah, sure." The words taste like bile in my mouth. "She looked pretty cozy with Ian while I almost got trampled." The phantom pain in my ankle throbs, a reminder of the glass that cut into me as I fell.

Angela steps closer, her expensive perfume making me nauseous. "Serena, we need to focus on what's important. The wedding was a disaster. We have to handle this."

Something snaps inside me. Years of buried resentment burst through the surface like a geyser. "What's important, Angela? My mother's been dead for years and you've done nothing but pretend to care about me. All you care about is keeping Nina happy." I turn to my father, rage making my voice shake. "And Dad, when did you ever give a damn about me?"

The memory of my mother's funeral flashes through my mind - how quickly Angela moved in, how Nina took center stage while I was pushed to the margins of my own family.

My father slams his fist on the bed's guardrail, the impact making me flinch despite myself. "Shut your mouth, Serena! You think the Whitmores still want anything to do with you after this mess? You think Ian wants a woman like you? Announce the end of this engagement now, or we'll do it for you!"

Hot tears burn behind my eyes, but they're tears of fury, not sadness. The IV in my arm pulls painfully as I clench my fists. "Oh, that's great. Blame me, right? Pretend I'm the one who messed everything up." My voice rises, years of pain pouring out. "What about you, Dad? What about replacing Mom so fast no one even had time to mourn? What about having Nina waltz into our home like a princess while I got nothing?"

The crack of his palm across my face echoes in the room. The sting blazes across my cheek, but the physical pain is nothing compared to the hurricane of rage and humiliation inside me. Angela gasps theatrically. Nina hides behind her, playing shocked, but I catch the gleam of satisfaction in her eyes.

I straighten slowly, tasting blood where I've bitten my cheek. The monitor beside me beeps faster, matching my racing heart. "Do that again," I say, my voice deadly quiet, "and I swear I'll call the police. Go ahead, hit me one more time. Let's see what the tabloids say when they find out how Lawrence Sinclair treats his daughter."

He stands there, breathing hard, his hand still raised. For a moment, I see uncertainty flicker in his eyes. He's not used to me fighting back. None of them are. They're used to the old Serena, the one who tried so hard to please everyone.

"Get out," I say quietly, then louder when they don't move. "Get the hell out of my room!"

Angela tries one last time, "Serena, let's-"

"OUT!" I scream, my voice cracking with the force of my rage.

My father storms out, shoving the door so hard it slams against the wall. Angela and Nina follow, both wearing identical expressions of disgust and annoyance. As soon as they're gone, I bury my face in my trembling hands.

A soft sound from the doorway broke through my thoughts. Two small figures stood there, their faces pinched with worry.

"Mommy?" The girl's voice was sweet and clear.

###chapter 3
Serena's POV

Boy is wearing a hospital gown like mine, and girl is in her own clothes. They look about five or six, both with these unbelievably perfect, pretty faces that make it hard to look away. They rush toward me with no hesitation. Before I can say anything, they climb up on my bed, one on each side. Their tiny arms wrap around me.
"Mommy, did someone hurt you?" boy asks, his voice all gentle and sweet. Girl looks at me with big, bright eyes and nods, "Did bad people do this to you?"
My chest tightens. I have no idea who these kids are, but they're looking at me like I'm the most important person in the world. I'm not their mom. I've never seen them before. But they're wiping my tears, so careful and clumsy.
I try to keep my voice calm, "Kids, you must have the wrong person." I reach out and smooth their soft hair. They stare at me, unblinking, and say in perfect unison, "No, you're our Mommy."
Boy starts rattling off details about their "Daddy": He's got a bad temper, he's quiet, he's always working, not eating right, and he smokes. Girl chimes in, "But Daddy is so handsome and rich, Mommy. Don't leave us again." Their insistence shakes me. I try again, "You're both very cute, but I'm really not your Mommy."
They exchange a look, like they know something I don't. Boy's face lights up with determination, "You are our Mommy, and we know a secret" Girl nods eagerly, looking like she's about to spill everything.
Before she can speak, a low, firm male voice comes from the doorway, "Milo. Stella." The kids freeze and turn around. I follow their gaze.
He stands tall and strong, dressed in a crisp white shirt with the top button undone, revealing a hint of his well-defined neck and chest. I can almost see the outline of muscle under that shirt. His tailored slacks and polished shoes complement his fit physique, a testament to his regular workouts. His hair is a sleek, jet-black mane, meticulously styled, adding to his striking presence. His gray eyes are captivating, their cool intensity drawing you in and hinting at a depth of emotion beneath their surface. 
His face is a masterpiece of sharp, angular lines-high cheekbones and a strong, chiseled jawline that exude confidence and masculinity. A neatly trimmed beard accentuates his strong jaw, adding a touch of rugged sophistication to his flawless appearance. He's ridiculously good-looking, the kind of handsome that stops you cold. Even in my confused state, I feel a kick of heat inside me. I've seen plenty of good-looking men in Manhattan, but he's on another level. The tension in the air around him is intense, controlled, and strangely exciting.
"Daddy!" Milo and Stella say, less confident now. The man shoots them a sharp look. "Go back to your room," he says, his voice calm but leaving no room for argument.
Milo frowns, Stella pouts, but they don't fight it. Before leaving, Milo turns to me, "Mommy, we're right next door. Will you come see us later?" Stella's eyes are bright and hopeful, "Please, Mommy?"
I can't refuse, not when they look at me like that. "Okay," I say, even though I have no idea what's going on. I plan to explain to them later that I'm not their mother.
Milo and Stella give me their names and then hop down, following the tall guy. He doesn't look at me at all, just turns and leaves. I feel unsettled, but also relieved by his distance. I'm not great at talking to strangers, especially not men like him who look like they walked off the cover of a magazine.
I hobble awkwardly toward the restroom, leaning heavily on my crutches to keep my weight off my injured leg. After taking a few moments inside, I step back out into the main room and nearly jump-he is there again, standing quietly as if he never left. I stare at him. He's so calm, standing there with his hands in his pockets. 
"Do I scare you?" he asks flatly.
"No," I say quickly, "I just didn't expect anyone else to be here." I'm defensive, unsure what he wants.
He watches me carefully before speaking, "I'm Lucas Harrington. The Harrington Group owns the banquet hall where your engagement party was held yesterday. The shot-" He pauses as if choosing his words. "We are responsible for what happened. I'm here to pay for your hospital expenses. If you want compensation, including lost income or emotional distress, just tell me."
I feel a rush of bitterness and exhaustion, but I try to keep calm. "Just cover my medical bills," I say.
Lucas studies me, his gaze strong and unreadable. My leg is starting to ache from standing too long. He notices my discomfort. "Need help?" His tone is distant, but he's clearly aware I'm about to topple over.
"No, I'm fine," I say, trying to keep what's left of my pride. But as soon as I take another step, my crutch slips. I panic. I'm about to crash down hard, but he's too fast. Lucas steps in and catches me, his arm solid around my waist, pulling me tight against him. My face ends up near his chest, and I inhale the faint scent of clean soap and something warm. I can hear his heartbeat. It's strong, steady, and I'm way too close to this insanely good-looking, strong man I've never met before.
I mumble, "I'm okay," trying to push away, but as I do, I lose my balance again. Without a word, Lucas just scoops me up into his arms, lifting me like I weigh nothing. I instinctively grip him tightly, but upon touching his muscular arms, I blush, feeling embarrassed. I hurriedly let go, maintaining an awkward posture. He crosses the room with smooth, steady steps and gently sets me down on the bed. Every muscle in his arms felt real, not like those scrawny guys I've met at parties. He's got a quiet strength that rattles me.
A furious voice snaps at us from the doorway. "What the hell are you doing?"

###chapter 4
Serena's POV
I know that voice. Ian Whitmore. My fiancé-or what was supposed to be my fiancé before everything went wrong.
My heart twists. I look at Ian. He's glaring at me like I've committed some crime. Lucas doesn't say a word, doesn't even look at Ian. He just finishes placing me on the bed and takes a step back. Ian storms over, face contorted with anger.
"Serena Sinclair!" he practically shouts. "I always knew you'd never change!"
I stared at Ian coldly, my heart filled with icy disappointment. That face that once made my heart skip a beat now only evoked feelings of unfamiliarity and disgust. 
Yesterday, he had abandoned me without a second thought. Despite the crushing heartbreak, our three years together might have earned him the chance to explain-though forgiveness was another matter entirely. In that raging shot, he'd chosen Nina, leaving me alone in a inferno.
But now, facing his baseless accusations and public humiliation, I trembled with rage. My fingers dug into my palms, nails nearly breaking skin as I fought to maintain composure.
When Ian didn't get an answer from me, he turned to examine the man standing silently beside my hospital bed. His gaze traveled from top to bottom, taking in Lucas's impressive height and commanding presence. I saw the moment of recognition flash across his face.
Ian's expression shifted, something jealous flickered in Ian's eyes.
I took a deep breath, forcing myself to remain calm. "Ian, let's break up."
The words hung in the air between us. Three years of deep affection, ending in this sterile room. As I spoke, something in my chest seemed to shatter, but strangely, it wasn't as painful as I'd imagined. It felt almost... liberating.
Ian's face contorted as if I'd physically struck him. He stared at me in shock, unable to believe what he'd just heard.
"Serena, who do you think he is?" he shouted, jabbing a finger toward Lucas. "He's just a cop! You're actually breaking up with me for him?! Have you lost your mind?"
His voice was hoarse with fury, his face flushed crimson. Disbelief and rage burned in his eyes.
Lucas remained silent beside me, but I sensed his slight movement. His eyes flashed with contempt and coldness, but he chose not to speak. His body leaned forward almost imperceptibly, ready to intervene if necessary.
"Why we're breaking up?" I said, my voice icy with barely controlled anger. "Shouldn't you know perfectly well? The moment you chose to save Nina yesterday, wasn't everything clear? Ian, stop treating me like a fool!"
My voice trembled, not from fear but from the anger and hurt churning inside me, threatening to break through my carefully constructed composure.
Ian froze, his indignation suddenly arrested. He stood speechless for a long moment, his expression a complex tangle of emotions, before finally relaxing as if some burden had been lifted from his shoulders.
He sighed heavily. "Perhaps we should never have been together from the start. Serena, you're too independent, too strong-willed. During our relationship, I always felt... dispensable, even pressured. You don't actually need me."
His voice grew quieter, his gaze shifting away as if trying to justify himself.
Looking at Ian, I suddenly laughed-the kind of laugh that comes when pain numbs everything else.
Memories flooded back: our meeting overseas when I was performing as a street artist, how charmingly cultured he'd seemed then; how he'd known about my troubled past but said he only cared about our future; how I'd returned with him to America during the Whitmore family crisis, spending two relentless years helping him rebuild his family's reputation.
My independence and strength-qualities that had saved his family-were now my failings? This was my reward for giving him my whole heart?
"Ian, you ungrateful bastard," I spat, my voice trembling with rage. "Aren't you afraid I'll leave and take the company's top talent with me? Aren't you afraid I'll go to the media and expose your affair?"
The words hit their mark. Ian's eyes immediately reddened, his facade cracking at the threat to his public image. His face contorted with fury as he lost all control. He lunged forward, reaching for my shoulders. "Serena, listen to me!"
I instinctively shrank back, a flash of fear crossing my face.
"Get your dirty hands off her," Lucas's voice cut through the air like ice, the sudden warning filled with such intimidating authority that Ian froze mid-motion.
###chapter 5
Serena's POV
Ian's head snapped toward Lucas, his face flushing an even deeper red with humiliation. "This is between us! You have no right to interfere!"
Ignoring the warning, Ian reached for me again, his movements fueled by wounded pride.
In one fluid motion, Lucas stepped between us. His hand shot out, gripping Ian's wrist with such force that Ian gasped in pain.
"I said, don't touch her," Lucas repeated, his voice dangerously low. "Assaulting an injured patient in a hospital? Are you trying to get arrested?"
Ian struggled to counter-attack, but Lucas's strength and technique far exceeded his expectations.
"Calm down," Lucas's voice was low and dangerous, "or I'd be happy to help you cool off."
I watched Lucas, noting his composed demeanor that somehow contained an unmistakable authority. The sunlight streaming through the blinds cast alternating bands of light across his determined face.
Lucas released his grip, and Ian stumbled back, adjusting his rumpled shirt cuffs with a face full of defeat and fury.
"You'll regret this, Serena," Ian said through clenched teeth. "You'll realize that without me, you're nothing!"
He turned to Lucas, his eyes flashing with malice. "And you-don't think wearing a uniform makes you special. I'll make you understand what happens when you mess with the Whitmore family."
"Ian," I said coldly, "stop wasting both our time. From today onward, we owe each other nothing."
Lucas stood beside me, his posture relaxed but his gaze vigilant, ready to intervene again if necessary.
Ian turned away angrily, throwing back one last threat before leaving: "You'll regret this, Serena. Both you and this cop will regret this."
He slammed the door behind him, leaving the room suddenly, terrifyingly quiet. 
I breathe out, the tension leaving my body. I look at Lucas. "Thanks for helping me earlier," I say quietly. "And thanks for that too." I gesture vaguely to the door, meaning the subtle way he stood by me. "I'm really tired. I just want some time alone."

Lucas nods, his face expressionless. Before leaving, he places a box of tissues on my bedside table. "A man who feels pressure being with a strong woman isn't good enough," he says, his voice low and firm. "That's on him, not on you."
I froze. *This man seemed to give me a different feeling.*

Lucas's POV
Yesterday was a nightmare I can't shake off. I still can't believe a homeless guy went on such a random rampage. We're still digging into it, but so far, it looks like no personal vendetta, just pure madness.
After the shots rang out, I rushed to the wedding venue. My heart was pounding, every step fueled by adrenaline. When I saw her-Serena-in that white wedding dress, lying there so vulnerable, it hit me hard. She looked like a flower that had been crushed and was about to wilt. I couldn't just stand there and do nothing.
I ran to her, my mind racing. "Stay with me," I shouted, kneeling beside her. She was barely conscious, her breaths shallow. I felt a surge of protectiveness I've never felt before. I pulled her into my arms, trying to keep her stable until help arrived. 
In the hospital, I listened to everything that happened. The screams, the panic, how Ian chose Nina over her. It was clear Serena was hurt not just physically but emotionally too. It sparked something in me, an urge to protect her that I can't fully explain.
Curiosity got the better of me. I started digging into her background. Turns out, she's a powerhouse. She and Ian were building something big together, working day and night. She's driven, fierce, everything you'd expect from a top executive. The contrast between her current state and her usual dominance is stark. It makes me even more interested in her. There's something about her resilience and vulnerability that I can't ignore.

Additionally, I'm pleased that my children are very fond of her, which surprises me. The connection between them seems unbroken by time. Thanks God, this problem that worried me most has been solved effortlessly.

I think that, including her conversations with her fiancé, she directly announced the breakup to him without leaving any room for doubt. I admire her decisiveness. I feel that I need to confront my feelings for her, take action, and let her my feeling.
I pulled out my phone and dialed. "Walter?"

"Sir." His response was prompt and respectful, as always.

"Starting today, when you prepare Milo and Stella's meals, have an extra portion sent to the room next door."

"...Yes, sir." I could hear the curiosity in his hesitation, but he knew better than to ask questions.

Just as I ended the call, my phone buzzed again. Drew's name flashed across the screen.

"I heard you just got back from abroad, and your hotel's already been shot up?" His tone was concerned.
"Yeah," I replied calmly.
"Have they figured out who did it?" Drew pressed, clearly trying to get a reaction.
"So far, it looks like some homeless individuals carried out a random shooting. They're still investigating."
"That's a bummer," he sighed. "Isn't Milo being discharged today?"
My son had been admitted with a wrist fracture that needed surgery the day I returned-definitely not the homecoming I'd planned.
"No," I replied. "I extended his stay by two weeks."
"Is something wrong with him?" Drew's voice tightened with concern.
"He's fine." I maintained a deliberately casual tone. "Just enjoying some extra vacation time."
"...This isn't a hotel, Lucas!"
"We'll talk later."
"Lucas, wait-maybe I should call a shrink to check on you-"
"Save it for yourself." I ended the call before he could continue. Lowering my phone, I couldn't help but glance back at the room next door-her room.

###chapter 6
Serena's POV
I barely noticed a quiet knock on my hospital room door. The events from last night-Ian's confrontation, Lucas's steady presence-still swirled in my mind.
"Excuse me, Miss Sinclair?" a refined voice called, pulling me from my thoughts. "I'm Walter, Lucas's butler. He asked me to make sure you're well taken care of during your stay."
I looked up to find an impeccably dressed older man standing in the doorway, flanked by two younger women in neat uniforms. His bearing suggested both authority and discretion - exactly what you'd expect from someone managing a wealthy household.

"That's... very thoughtful," I managed, thrown off balance by this display of consideration. "But really, it's not necessary-"

"I assure you, it is." Walter's tone brooked no argument as he supervised the setup of what appeared to be a gourmet lunch. "Mr. Harrington was quite specific about your care requirements."

The rich aroma of the food made my stomach growl traitorously. As I watched the careful arrangement of dishes, I noticed Walter placing a small box on the bedside table.

"What else would you like for dessert?" Walter inquired as he made final adjustments to the place settings.

I had intended to decline, but seeing Walter's consummate professionalism, I found myself curious to sample a private chef's culinary skills. Dropping my hesitation, I asked, "Would it be possible to have the Lemon Tart garnished with mint leaves?"

Walter immediately produced a small notebook and jotted down the request. "Of course, I'll have it delivered tomorrow," he replied without missing a beat.

I nodded gratefully in response.

"Your personal effects, Miss Sinclair. Mr. Harrington took the liberty of having your phone replaced - same model and number as before."

I stared at the box, a complicated mix of emotions rising in my chest. The gesture was thoughtful - overwhelmingly so - and yet...

"Why is he doing all this?" I asked quietly.

Walter's expression remained professionally neutral. "Mr. Harrington believes in taking care of those he considers important, Miss Sinclair." With a slight bow, he added, "The nurses will remain to assist you. Please don't hesitate to ask for anything you need."

After he left, I found myself picking at the admittedly delicious food, my thoughts drifting to the two children in the next room. Despite my confused feelings about their father, Milo and Stella had worked their way into my heart with surprising speed.

"I'd like to see them," I told one of the nurses - Julie, according to her name tag. "Could you help me to their room?"

The short journey next door revealed Milo propped up in bed, a book open on his lap. His face lit up the moment he saw me. "Mommy!"

That single word shot straight through my defenses. I moved closer as he reached for me, his small arms wrapping around my waist with complete trust. In the corner, I noticed Stella, sitting quietly with a stuffed rabbit clutched to her chest.

"Hi," I said softly, meeting her eyes. She ducked her head shyly, but I caught the hint of a smile.

"I... I like you," she whispered, her voice barely audible. The simple honesty of her words made my throat tight.

I spent the next hour with them, listening to Milo's animated chatter and watching Stella gradually edge closer until she was leaning against my chair. The peace of the moment was broken by Lucas's arrival.

He filled the doorway, tall and imposing in his dark suit. My breath caught at the sight of the bandages on his wrist - evidence of his rescue attempt that I hadn't noticed during last night's confrontation with Ian.

"They should be sleeping," he said, but there was no real reproach in his tone.

"We wanted to wait for Mommy," Milo protested, tightening his grip on my hand. Stella nodded in silent agreement.

I felt a flash of panic. "I should go-" 

"Stay." Lucas's voice was quiet but firm. "Unless you want to leave?"

"I..." I looked down at Milo's pleading face, then at Stella's hopeful expression.
"Would you mind watching them until they fall asleep? I need to take a call," Lucas said, his phone already in hand. There was a gentle consideration in his voice as he added, "Only if you're comfortable with it."
"Fine, I'll stay until they fall asleep," I replied softly, watching as Milo's eyes began to droop.
Lucas gave a slight nod, then quietly stepped out into the hallway to take his call.
It didn't take long. Milo drifted off mid-sentence, his hand still clasped in mine. Stella curled up like a cat, her breathing evening out as I stroked her hair. Kids really have enviable sleep. I have no idea how much melatonin I've been taking over the years. Seeing they asleep, I reached out to leave, but as soon as I did, Milo's chubby little arm held my tighter, murmuring, "Mommy, don't leave us..."
I felt a wave of sadness, thinking they were so unfortunate. Looking at Milo and Stella's adorable little faces, I couldn't imagine what kind of heartless mother would be willing to leave them behind. Unable to resist, I bent down and kissed Milo and Stella.
As I straightened up, I froze - Lucas stood in the doorway, his grey eyes fixed on me, expression unreadable.

I didn't expect such a coincidence, which left me feeling quite embarrassed. "This doesn't mean anything,"  I immediately felt the urge to explain myself. "I'm not-"

"Milo and Stella waited up an extra hour just to see you," he interrupted, diffusing the awkward moment.

I pressed my lips together, choosing my next words carefully. "Mr. Harrington, you should make it clear to Milo and Stella that I'm not his mother."

His grey eyes held mine steadily, saying nothing. The sudden silence made me wonder if I'd overstepped.

Taking a deep breath, I continued, "The gunshot was just an accident. You don't need to send meals or hire nurses for me, and I'll transfer you the money for the phone."

"I thought you were more perceptive, Miss Sinclair."

I blinked. "Excuse me?"

"They need a mother," he stated matter-of-factly, his deep voice resonating in the quiet hallway.

"And?" I raised an eyebrow, already dreading his response.

His intense gaze studied me for a long moment before he spoke again, his voice dropping slightly. "And They like you. So you should understand that I'm pursuing you."

The directness of his statement caught me off guard. I stared at him, searching for any sign of insincerity. 

"You don't need to respond immediately," Lucas continued, pausing as if searching for the right words. "After all, we're still... unfamiliar with each other."

We were barely more than strangers, really.

I took a deep breath, trying to maintain my composure. "Mr. Harrington, aren't you being rather cavalier about relationships?"

His eyebrow lifted slightly. If he'd seemed somewhat approachable before, now there was a distinct coldness to his demeanor.

"Your kids like me, so you pursue me? Am I just a tool to you? What happens when your kid stop liking me and becomes attached to another woman? Will you pursue her instead?" My voice came out harsher than intended. I softened it as I added, "I'm sorry, but I can't accept your values."

"My pursuit of you has nothing to do with my kids," Lucas stated plainly. "It just happens that both kids and I have good taste."

I thought I must have misheard. This sudden confession... had to be a joke, right? We'd known each other for what - a few hours?

"And you don't need to worry about they liking other women," Lucas continued deliberately. "It runs in our family to be... singularly focused."

Was he highlighting his kids' loyalty? His own? Or was this meant to be some kind of... promise?

I refused to let him set the pace of this conversation. "Regardless of your motives, Mr. Harrington, I'll be clear: I reject your pursuit."
###chapter 7
Serena's POV

Those gray eyes remained fixed on me. I have to admit, they were captivating, making me stare at him without even realizing it. But I couldn't accept such a ridiculous and insincere confession.

"Our only connection should be settling the accident compensation-"

"I reject your rejection, Miss Sinclair," Lucas cut in, his tone brooking no argument.

The arrogance in his voice sparked my anger. "Do you even know anything about my past? I'm not as perfect as you seem to think."

"I never doubt my judgment, and I don't care about the past."

"Someone else once said the same things," I retorted bitterly. "How did that turn out?"

How could I possibly trust a virtual stranger?

"You shouldn't compare me to trash." The sudden stillness in the air was broken by his cold words, his expression severe.

I felt my heart skip a beat. His expression made me feel as if I'd genuinely insulted him. Suddenly, I found myself laughing. I wasn't even sure why.

"I'll make sure you see the difference between me and trash, Miss Sinclair," Lucas said, his eyes flickering at my laughter.

The translation of those words was clear enough... he intended to pursue me regardless. He turned and walked away, as if unwilling to waste any more time on this discussion. His decisions, it seemed, were not up for debate.

"Mr. Harrington," I called after him, finally finding my voice.

He stopped but didn't turn around.

"I suggest you look into my past."

"Not necessary."





Ian's POV

The late afternoon sun cast long shadows through the Sinclair mansion's floor-to-ceiling windows as I strode through the familiar marble hallway. My footsteps echoed against the polished floor, each step helping to shed the unpleasantness of the hospital scene. 

Lawrence Sinclair's study remained exactly as I remembered - dark wood paneling, leather-bound books, and the subtle scent of aged bourbon. He looked up from his desk as I entered, his expression sharp with anticipation.

"Did Serena agree to break off the engagement?" he asked without preamble.

I adjusted my tie, buying a moment to compose my response. "The relationship is over. The formal dissolution of the engagement will follow naturally."

Nina sat in one of the wingback chairs, her presence a stark contrast to Serena's usual challenging stance. Where Serena would have demanded answers, Nina simply watched me with those warm, admiring eyes.

"It's already done," I added, letting my gaze rest on Nina. "Though I regret that you'll have to wait a bit longer, darling."

She shook her head, her expression softening. "I don't mind waiting. Just being with you makes me happy, Ian."

The warmth in her voice soothed something raw inside me. This was how things should be - simple, uncomplicated. No constant challenge, no need to prove myself.

"There's something else you should know," I said, turning back to Lawrence. "When I went to see her, that cop from the incident was there. The one who carried her out."

Lawrence's face darkened. "Typical. She never could maintain proper standards."

I nodded, bitter satisfaction coursing through me. "Though it seems he might be more than just a cop. There's something... different about him."

"Different how?" Lawrence's attention sharpened.

"Just a feeling." I paused, choosing my words carefully. "He carried himself like someone used to authority. And Serena... she seemed different around him."

"Speaking of authority," Lawrence leaned forward, "I heard Lucas Harrington has returned to Manhattan. The Harrington Group's prodigal son, finally home to take the reins."

The name caught Nina's attention. "Lucas Harrington? Isn't he the one who had a child overseas? The mysterious heir everyone's been gossiping about?"

"The very same," Lawrence confirmed. "Charity gala made by  Harringtons next month will be his official introduction to Manhattan society. Nina, as StarRiver's new CEO, you should make an effort to meet him."

I watched Nina's face carefully as she processed this information. "What's he like?" she asked, curiosity evident in her voice.

"No one really knows," I interjected smoothly. "He's been abroad for years. Though given his... situation, I doubt he's anything special. Probably trading on his family name while hiding his inadequacies behind foreign success stories."

Nina laughed softly. "You're probably right. Besides," she added, reaching for my hand, "I already have the most impressive man in Manhattan."

I squeezed her fingers, savoring her complete devotion. "Let's focus on what matters," Lawrence said, pulling out a folder. "The StarRiver transition plans. Nina, you'll need to be ready to take control within the month."


Serena's POV
I've been stuck in this hospital room for a whole week. The white walls, the stale smell of disinfectant-everything's been driving me crazy. Today, I'm finally getting out. My leg still hurts, and I have to rely on a crutch, but that's a small price to pay for my freedom.
As I lie in bed, ready to check out, I remember something: I never transferred that money to Lucas Harrington. I stare at my phone. Oh well, he doesn't look like he's short on cash. I'll just consider it compensation for his emotional offense against me. 
With a slight smirk, I scroll through my contacts and dial a vaguely familiar number. It connects to Cassius Swift, my mother's attorney. He speaks calmly, reminding me of what he told me before-my mother, Helen Sinclair, left StarRiver Group to me. It's mine whenever I'm ready to claim it. My heart skips a beat. I tell him I'm ready to take back what belongs to me. We agree to meet at StarRiver Group.
Before I leave the hospital, Milo and Stella show up again. These kids have been visiting almost every day. Milo's always teasing me, making silly faces, doing whatever he can to lift my mood. Stella is quieter-she stands there, looking at me with those soft eyes, not saying much, but her presence is warm and comforting. It's strange that I don't mind them. 
Yet every time I see their father, Lucas Harrington, something inside me tenses up. He said he was going to pursue me, but since then, he hasn't made any real move. He appears and disappears like a shadow, leaving me unsure how to feel. The only tangible care I've noticed is the food Walter brings me daily-fresh, delicious meals. I can't deny they taste good, but it doesn't wash away the uneasy feeling I have about Lucas.
I pack my things-mainly just the phone Lucas gave me and a few personal items. Nothing special. Milo looks up at me, eyes brimming with sorrow. "Mommy, will I still see you?" The word "Mommy" hits me hard.
I force myself to smile. "Of course, Milo. I'll leave my number, and if you miss me, just call, okay?"
Milo's face brightens instantly. He jumps up and kisses me on the cheek, leaving me speechless. Stella steps forward and hugs me tight, not saying a word but somehow telling me she doesn't want me to vanish. My throat tightens. I pat her head gently.
Leaning on my crutch, I head for the corridor. Lucas is there, trailing behind like my own personal bodyguard. Even though I want to tell him to back off, I can't find the words. At the hospital's entrance, he opens the car door for me. I think about refusing, but when I meet his gaze-steady, unwavering-I sigh and get in.
Once inside, Lucas asked, "Ms. Sinclair, where do you live?"
"Tribeca Towers."
Since returning to the country, I haven't been back to the Sinclair family. No one from my family has inquired about me.
"Hmm." Lucas responded, giving a nod to the driver. The driver quickly nodded back.
The sedan began to move slowly.
Suddenly, Lucas leaned closer to me. My heart skipped a beat, and I felt a sense of guardedness. Lucas had always kept his distance from me...
In the next moment, I saw him bend down to fasten my seatbelt.
I pressed my lips together, feeling a flush of embarrassment.
After securing the seatbelt, Lucas spoke in a calm tone, "Ms. Sinclair, there's no need to clench your fists so tightly."
I abruptly lowered my head, realizing I had unconsciously been clenching my fists. Embarrassment spread through me...
"Don't worry, Ms. Sinclair. I have always maintained my integrity."
Feeling a bit uncomfortable, I decided to push back. I let out a dry laugh, crossing my arms. "So, you claim you're all pure as driven snow, but somehow you ended up with two kids. Care to explain how that magic trick worked?"
He stays calm-too calm-eyes on the road. "I was forced."
###chapter 8
Serena's POV
My jaw nearly hits my knees. Forced? Seriously? That's a curveball I did not see coming. I gulp, then try to steer this conversation onto safer ground. "O-kay, so why'd you two split up, exactly?"
He shrugs, eyes fixed on the road. "She didn't like me."
I roll my eyes. "Wait, so Miss Universe looked at you-Mr. Tall, Dark, and I'm-So-Above-It-All-and just said, 'Eh, I've seen better'? Really?"
His voice doesn't change. "She never wanted a child. After giving birth to Milo and Stella, she planned to abandon him."
I feel sick, fury and sadness mixing in my chest. "That's awful," I manage to say. "You're better off without her."
He says nothing more. The silence is thick, but I sense something complicated in his expression as we reach my building. I open the door and step out. "Thanks," I say, forcing some civility.
Lucas just nods, watching me as I head into the lobby. He doesn't follow, and that's a relief. I don't need him trying to push his way into my private space. I barely exhale when I hear him answer a call-something about Milo and Stella and their grandfather. I don't know the details. 
The next morning, a bright sunny day. I put on a sharp blazer and skirt, add a touch of makeup. I see my own reflection in the mirror-Serena Sinclair, ready to reclaim what's hers. I arrive at StarRiver Group, Cassius by my side. In the lobby, I meet Henry Lockwood, a man my mother trusted deeply. He greets me politely, "Miss Sinclair, I have news. Lawrence Sinclair is about to appoint Nina as the company's new general manager. The ceremony's happening right now."
I smile, a cold, practiced smile. "No problem," I say, keeping my voice level.
The moment I walk into StarRiver Group's meeting room, I feel every pair of eyes drilling into me. The place is packed with top employees and executives. The tension is thick and suffocating. I know I'm not exactly welcome, but I don't give a damn.
Nina Sinclair, looking all sweet and poised at the podium, is seconds away from delivering what I assume is her shiny new "I'm the boss now" speech. She sees me and freezes like I just sucker-punched her. For a second, she can't even speak.
My father, Lawrence Sinclair, sits in the front row like the proud king of this stupid kingdom. He notices Nina's weird reaction and turns to look. The second he spots me, his face darkens. Every muscle in his neck strains. The anger in his eyes could burn a hole right through me.
He stands up, and the whole damn room goes quiet. Everyone's looking at us, wide-eyed and curious.
"What the hell are you doing here?" he hisses, stepping closer. His voice is dripping with disgust. "This is none of your business."
I keep my back straight, my voice steady. "Last I checked, this was my mother's company," I say, my words cold as ice. "I think I have every right to be here."
He clenches his jaw. "I'm not arguing with you. Get out. Now. I don't have time for your crap."
I lift my chin, refusing to move. Instead, I push past him into the room. The crowd parts like I've got the plague. Everyone's whispering, nudging each other, expecting some big showdown.
Nina flashes me a fake smile so sweet it's nauseating. "Serena, what a surprise! You came to see my ceremony? I'm so happy you're here." Her voice is all sugar, but her eyes are sharp. She's trying too hard, and I can see right through her.
I ignore her cheerful act. I'm done playing this stupid game. I pull a document out of my bag and hold it up. "Listen up, everyone. I'm Serena Sinclair. Today, I'm here to make something very clear: StarRiver Group belongs to me, per my mother's will. I appreciate whatever management my father's provided while I was away, but I'll be taking over now."
The room erupts in whispers. People gasp, glance at each other, jaws dropping. Nina's standing there clutching her speech, looking like a complete idiot. I can almost see her pride crack and crumble. Her eyes go red, her face twists. She's been humiliated, right here, in front of everyone.
She squeaks out, "S-Serena, are you short on cash or something?" Her voice wobbles. "I-I mean, I heard you were interested insome gigolo guy. Did you need money to impress him or what?"
The employees start mumbling again, eyebrows shooting up. What the hell is she talking about? She's grasping at straws now, trying to paint me as desperate and broke.
Before I can snap back, my father storms forward. "I'll give you four million," he spits, pulling out a checkbook like he's tossing scraps to a stray dog. "Take the money and get lost. Don't ever show your face in StarRiver again. This place isn't yours."
I grab the check he scribbles out and rip it into tiny pieces right in front of his nose, letting them flutter to the floor. The entire room sucks in a breath.
"four million?" I say, voice sharp. "Do you think this is some back-alley deal? StarRiver's net profits run in the tens of millions, and you think a lousy five million is gonna get rid of me? Don't make me laugh."
Lawrence's face contorts, every line of dignity disappearing. He looks like he wants to strangle me right here. Nina's so pale she could pass out. I'm sure they never expected me to just show up and flip the table on their little power game.
I hold their furious gaze, unmoved. "You've got one day. Pack up whatever personal crap you have here and leave. If you stay, I'll make sure you regret it. I'm not playing nice anymore."
I turn on my heel and walk out. Behind me, I hear people whispering, shuffling, not sure what to do now that the Sinclair family drama just exploded in their faces.
###chapter 9
Lucas's POV
I'm standing in my new office at Harrington International Holdings, right in the heart of Manhattan. The floor-to-ceiling windows give me a clear view of the city's skyscrapers and buzzing streets. The space around me is sleek and gray-sharp lines, dark tones, top-tier furniture. It's my first official day here, and I'm supposed to settle in, but my mind's all over the place.
Miles, my assistant, steps in and hands me a neat stack of files. "Boss, we've got a high-level meeting in half an hour. The board wants you there. The chairman insists."
I nod, flipping through the pages without really focusing. "Alright. Anything else pressing before the meeting?"
Miles hesitates, tapping his finger on the edge of my desk. "I've got the profiles you asked for. The senior managers, their backgrounds, what they've been up to. Everything's in here," he says, pointing to the folder. "I've been here a month already, getting a feel for the place, and I think I've pieced together who's who."
I scan a few paragraphs. My brain's half plugged in. Something else is nagging at me. "Miles," I say quietly, "any word from StarRiver Group today?"
Miles's eyes flick up. "Yes, actually. Big news. Miss Serena Sinclair showed up at StarRiver this morning. Apparently, it was supposed to be Nina Sinclair's big day-her appointment as GM. Except Serena crashed the party."
My jaw tenses. Serena went straight into that den of vipers on her own. "And?" I ask, trying to sound casual.
"She completely blew it up." Miles lets out a nervous laugh. "Nina froze at the podium. Lawrence Sinclair lost it. People say Serena took back control-she told them all to leave if they didn't like it. She practically humiliated them." He glances at me carefully, like he's watching for a reaction. "Word is this might shake up the market. Everyone's talking."
I lean back, fingers tapping the desk. "Serena" I mumble under my breath. She sure as hell doesn't need me to hold her hand. She's handling things her own way, and from what Miles says, she's doing it with zero mercy.
Miles clears his throat. "Lucas, are you alright?"
I snap back. "I'm fine. Just thinking."
Miles studies my face. "Boss, you've never cared about anyone's drama before. You usually keep people at arm's length. But now you seem different." He pauses, then lowers his voice. "Need me to do something behind the scenes for Serena? Smooth things over somehow?"
I bite my lip, considering. Serena just turned StarRiver upside down on her own. She's strong. She doesn't need me to babysit her. "No," I say finally. "She can handle herself."
Miles nods. "Understood."
I pick up the phone and dial Serena's number. The line connects, and I hear her voice. But before I can say a word, she's shouting, "Whitmore, if you call again, I swear I'll make you regret it!" She's furious, venom in her tone. She thinks I'm Ian. I stay silent, letting her realize it's not who she thinks.
There's this awkward pause, then her voice drops a notch. "Who is it?"
I keep my voice calm. "It's me, Lucas."
A muffled curse, then she speaks again, softer. "Sorry, I didn't realize it was you. That outburst wasn't meant for you."
I almost smile. "So who was it meant for?"
She hesitates. "Lucas, you know exactly who. Don't play dumb."
I drum my fingers on the desk. "You need help with him?"
Her response is instant. "No, I don't. I'm good. Do you have a reason for calling?"
I reply in calm. "No reason. Just checking in."
Serena asks, "What are you trying to confirm?"
I reply with a hint of playfulness, "Just checking if the number you gave Milo is real."
She stays silent for a moment, then with a bit irritation says, "I'm not lying to them."
I find her response cute and, smiling slightly, say, "Dinner tonight to celebrate my first day at work."
She's clearly taken aback by the sudden invitation, pauses as if thinking it over, then politely responds, "Sorry, Lucas, I'm busy."
I don't give her a chance to argue. "Six o'clock. I'll pick you up."
"Lucas, I said-" I hang up before she can finish. 
Seconds later, my phone buzzes. A text. I open it. "Lucas, I really can't tonight. Congrats on the new job though." Attached is a Starbucks e-gift card for twenty-five bucks. Cute. She's basically telling me to enjoy my coffee alone. I stare at the screen, amused, a grin tugging at my lips.
Miles steps closer. "What's going on?"
I show him the e-gift card. "What does it mean when a woman gives a man money? Even if it's just a coffee card?"
He blinks. "I, uh maybe she's trying to keep things friendly but distant? Like, 'here's something nice, now leave me alone'?"
I laughed even more happily. 
A courteous knock resonated through the doorway. The secretary respectfully announced, "Mr. Harrington, Ian Whitemore, the General Manager of Whitemore Group, wants to see you. Should I let him in?"
I stiffen. "No."
"When would you like to meet him...?"
"I'm never available," I retorted coldly.
The secretary trembled. "I'll have Mr. Whitemore come back later."
I stayed silent. The secretary departed, clearly shaken.
"Wait," I suddenly interjected.
She swiftly turned back. "Tell him I'll be in a board meeting. Once it's over, I might have some time."
She nods, "Understood," hurries out.
###chapter 10
Ian's POV
I settle into a lounge chair in the waiting area, my eyes drifting to the floor-to-ceiling windows. I can see the busy streets below, people in suits rushing around like ants. I just need a few minutes of Lucas's time, a simple conversation to secure a future position for the Whitmore Family's high-end fashion line in what's going to be the biggest damn commercial district in the country. That's all I want.
Time passes, and I finally notice movement. Through the glass, I see a group of executives passing by. One of them, a man with a stack of folders-maybe that's his assistant-leads the pack. I lean forward, eyes narrowed.
They move as one through the sea of suits, smooth and self-assured. Through gaps in the crowd, I catch glimpses of someone at the front - must be Lucas. He turns, and for a moment our eyes meet. I manage a polite smile and nod. He pauses, his brow furrowing slightly, before returning the nod and hurrying to catch up with his team. The crowd swallows him again, leaving just the blur of dark suits and purposeful strides.
I return to my seat, tapping my foot against the marble floor. It's okay. He's busy. They told me he's in a board meeting. Fine. I can wait. The Whitmore Family's position in the upcoming commercial district is too important to screw up by being impatient. I've got all day if needed.
I wait for hours, but Mr. Harrington never appears. The secretary keeps making excuses: first he's in a board meeting, then he's at lunch, then he's inspecting a site. By late afternoon, everyone's leaving, and I'm still here. Finally, she admits he left for the day. I've wasted my entire day waiting for a man who never intended to see me.
Left. For the day. After making me sit here like an idiot since morning. I turn on my heel and storm out of the building, face like stone. I climb into my car, slam the door. My phone buzzes. It's Nina calling.
"Hey, lan!" Nina's voice is sugary sweet, always trying to sound helpful. "You spent all day at Harrington International, right? You must've had a great chat with Mr. Harrington! How did it go?"
My knuckles turn white around my phone. "I'm not in the mood, Nina."
She's quick, though. Always fishing for details. "I'm having dinner with Evelyn right now. Wanna join us? Or maybe you and Lucas made dinner plans?"
I grind my teeth. "I'm not going anywhere. You two have fun."
She pauses, her voice growing concerned. "You sound upset. Everything okay?"
I swallow my anger. I'm not telling her I got played. "I'm fine. Just tired. I want to go home."
She tries to soothe me. "Alright, get some rest. By the way, you saw Mr. Harrington up close, right? How is he? Some middle-aged big shot with a dad bod?"
I let out a bitter laugh, but it comes out hollow. "Not really. He's pretty plain, honestly."
Nina giggles. "I figured. Well, I won't keep you. I'm almost at the restaurant. Feel better, okay?"
I hang up, tossing my phone onto the passenger seat and slammed my fists on the steering wheel and yelled, "AHHHHH! FUCK YOU! Lucas Harrington, just you wait!" I growled fiercely.

Serena's POV
I'm lying on my bed, phone in hand, trying to decide on dinner. I'm not in the mood to cook, and I'm about to tap on the delivery app when my phone rings. It's the same unfamiliar number from this morning. I sigh, already prepared to shut down Lucas's "invitation." 
"Hello?" I say, voice clipped. I expect Lucas's low voice. Instead, I hear a bright, excited voice: "Mommy! It's me, Milo!"
My heart clenches. Milo. I can almost see his big eyes and cheerful grin through the phone. "Milo?" I manage. It's been three days since I last saw him and Stella.
Milo chatters on, "Daddy and Stella and I are coming to pick you up in ten minutes! We're going to have dinner together! I miss you!"
I open my mouth, ready to refuse. But then Milo calls me "Mommy" again, that simple word making my throat tight. I can't say no. "Alright," I whisper, feeling my carefully built resistance crumble. "I'll wait downstairs."
It's ridiculous, but I find myself grabbing my crutch and leaving the apartment. Outside, the city lights blur against the dusk, and I spot Lucas's black Maybach parked near the entrance. He's leaning against the car, tall and so damn self-assured. People are staring-he's the kind of man who draws eyes without trying.
He sees me, and for a second, something warm sparks in his gaze. He strides over, takes my crutch from me, and slips an arm around my waist as if it's the most natural thing in the world. I feel the weight of curious glances, but I just grit my teeth and let him lead me to the car. Inside, Milo and Stella beam at me like I'm their entire world.
Milo bounces in his seat, "Mommy, I got transformer for you to see after dinner!"
Stella's voice is softer, sweeter, "Mommy, I'm really hungry. Can we have cake later? I want something sweet."
They keep talking, rattling off all the dishes they want to eat. I relax a bit, answering them gently. "Sure, we can have whatever you like." Milo cheers, Stella grins. Lucas says nothing, just watches us with that quiet intensity, his presence filling the car even without words.
The restaurant is classy, floor-to-ceiling windows giving a stunning view of the city. The waitress seats us at a table near the glass. As I settle in, my eyes drift across the room. That's when I see them: Nina Sinclair and Evelyn Whitmore, sitting not too far away, laughing over something.
Lucas flips through the menu, but I know he's noticed my sudden tension. Without a word, he follows my line of sight, his gaze sweeping over Nina and Evelyn. They're talking loudly enough that snatches of their conversation reach me.
Evelyn's voice drips with scorn. "Date with a guy who's got kids and got dumped before? I'd rather die." She laughs, harsh and bitter. "And what about that Serena Sinclair? Eighteen and knocked up, wasn't she? No shame."
I feel Stella tug on my sleeve, pointing to a dessert page. "Mommy, look, chocolate mousse! Can we get that?"
Milo chimes in, "And mango pudding for me!"
I force a smile. "Of course, sweetheart." My chest tightens, but I refuse to show any weakness. Lucas's voice is low, calm. "What would you like to eat?" he asks me, ignoring the hateful whispers from across the room as if they don't exist. His words brought my attention back to ordering. Just as the waiter and I were placing my order, he suddenly stood up.
He excuses himself to the restroom, leaving me with the kids. I turn my full attention to Stella and Milo, allowing their bright, eager voices to ease the sting of those cruel words lingering in my chest. Stella whispers happily, "After dinner, I'll show you my drawings, Mommy. I drew the stars."
I stroke her hair. "I can't wait, baby."
A few minutes pass, then I see Lucas returning. Almost immediately, I notice two waitstaff approach Nina and Evelyn's table. One of them says politely, "I'm sorry, we need to clear this section. Would you mind leaving now?" The tone is firm, no-nonsense.
Evelyn's face twists. "What do you mean clear the section? It's barely dinnertime!"
"Ma'am, we're asking you to leave." The waiter's smile doesn't falter.
###chapter 11
Serena's POV
Evelyn spits, "What do you mean? We're not done!"
Nina and Evelyn sputter, outraged. They have no idea what's happening. It's barely dinnertime, and they haven't finished their meal. They're ranting now, voices sharp and offended.
I don't react. I just straighten my spine, give my order to the waitress who appears at my side, and tap on the dessert page for Stella.
Lucas returns to his seat, his expression unreadable, but I catch the slight curve of his lips. He says nothing about what just happened. Instead, he quietly asks Milo what he wants to drink, and Stella if she needs more napkins. The kids are oblivious to the tension that just boiled.

The waiter's smile doesn't budge. "I'm sorry, ma'am, but I have to insist."
Nina huffs, "Do you know who we are? I'll complain to your manager!"
Evelyn raises her chin, glaring. "We'll file a complaint. This is unacceptable."
The waiter shrugs and taps the badge on his chest. "Feel free to complain, ma'am. My name and number are right here." His tone is cool, unshaken.
Nina and Evelyn stand, furious, expecting everyone else to be asked to leave as well. But the other tables remain seated, calm, enjoying their meals. This stings them even more.
Evelyn points wildly, her eyes landing on a random table-my table. Nina follows her gaze. The moment Nina spots me, her eyes narrow, full of spite. Evelyn notices Lucas, her eyes widening at the sight of him. She looks impressed, as if she's never expected to find such a strikingly handsome man here. The shock on her face is almost funny.
Nina's voice cuts through the low hum of the restaurant. "Sis?" She tries to get my attention, her tone dripping with disbelief and resentment. I don't move, don't even turn my head.
Nina's frustration turns into something uglier. I can sense the jealousy radiating off her. She's got all kinds of twisted ideas in her head, no doubt. She sneers loudly enough for me to hear, "So he's the 'cop' you fell for, right?" She smirks, making sure I hear every word. "I guess you got tired of being alone after you broke up with Ian. Now you're settling for a guy with kids."
Evelyn snorts. "Lowering your standards, Serena? Bringing kids here, to such a pricey place, is that how you show off your new high-class life? Didn't know trash like you could afford a meal here."
I clench my jaw. I try to keep it together because Milo and Stella are right here. They don't deserve to witness a meltdown. But Nina won't stop, her words turning more hateful. She drags Ian Whitmore into it, acting like I'm heartbroken and desperate, like I'm using Lucas and the kids as some twisted revenge scheme.
That's it.
I gently press my palm over Milo's ear. He's smart; he covers Stella's ears, too. I won't let their innocence be tainted by these foul words. I stand up, voice cold, cutting through the noise. "You think everyone's like you, picking up rotten leftovers? Ian Whitmore is nothing to me now. I threw him away first, remember?" My words slice through Nina's facade. Her face turns pale.
Evelyn tries to strike back, sneering,"Oh, jealous much? Sounds like we're hitting sour grapes territory here." She shoots a nasty glance at Lucas, acting like he's beneath them. "So you settle for a low-grade man and his kids. Pathetic."
I'm about to snap again when suddenly, Lucas's voice breaks in. Low, cold, and lethal. "What kind of man?" he asks, eyes on them, voice so quiet it's terrifying. Nina and Evelyn shut up instantly, their bravado evaporating.
Lucas stood up gracefully, his movements calm and composed. He buttoned his suit, exuding the commanding presence of a king. With an oppressive aura, he approached Nina and Evelyn, his demeanor leaving no room for doubt. He looked down on them condescendingly and said in a low voice, "This is my woman. I'm working hard to pursue her. If you dare to speak ill of her again, I will make you disappear completely from Manhattan, along with your families." His eyes were sharp, revealing a lethal fierceness that sent chills down their spines.
Nina and Evelyn recoiled in fear, taking several steps back before collapsing into their chairs. With just one look, Lucas signals the staff. A waiter steps forward, face blank, tone polite but firm. "Ladies, please leave. Now."
"How dare-" Nina still wanted to fight back, but was interrupted by the waiter. "You're on our blacklist. No next time."
Nina trembles with anger, Evelyn looks ready to scream, but they know they can't win. Nina yanks Evelyn's arm, muttering something about paparazzi and pulling back later. They storm off, hissing threats that mean nothing.
The moment they're gone, the tension collapses. It's as if the room exhales. Other diners pretend not to have noticed the show, focusing on their meals again. I sink back into my seat, my heart still pounding.
Milo tugs my sleeve, voice small, "Mommy, were they bad people?"
I force a gentle smile and ruffle his hair, "Yes, sweetheart. They were bad. But don't worry, Mommy won't let them hurt us."
Stella leans close, relief shining in her eyes. I sense Lucas looking at me, maybe impressed I didn't crumble. Milo clenches his tiny fist like he's ready to protect me if needed.
I pick up my utensils again, carefully slicing my steak into small pieces for Milo. He beams at me, places a quick kiss on my cheek. Warmth spreads through my chest. Across the table, Lucas quietly takes my plate and does the same for me, slicing my steak into perfect cubes. He pushes the plate back, and I nod, "Thanks."
Lucas raises a brow, smirking. "You could thank me the way Milo did."
My cheeks catch fire. "Not a chance," I blurt, refusing to even consider that scenario. My heart's flipping around like a fish out of water, and I'd rather not figure out why. Lucas chuckles, like he's scoring points in some secret game. "Fair enough," he says, pretending to be all gracious about it.
Just then, Stella waves a spoonful of chocolate mousse in front of my face, practically bouncing in her seat. "Try this, Mommy!" She looks way too proud of her dessert-delivery skills. I lean in and taste it. Sweet, creamy, perfect. "Delicious, honey," I say, smiling at her like she just invented dessert itself.
Lucas, never missing a chance, says, "I want to try too." Stella giggles and feeds him a spoonful. I watch this bizarrely charming scene unfold-this big, aloof guy calmly letting a tiny girl spoon-feed him chocolate. Am I on some weird hidden-camera show?
Stella tilts her head, all curious. "Sweet, Daddy?" she asks, bright-eyed.
Lucas meets my gaze with a look. "Very sweet," he says, voice soft and way too loaded. My face warms up like I'm standing next to a bonfire. I know he's not just talking about mousse here.
###chapter 12
Serena's POV
After dinner, Lucas took Milo and Stella back to his father's home. I try to tell him, "I can grab a cab, really," but he waves me off, saying it's no trouble. There's a driver this time, and the poor guy looks like he'd rather vanish than listen to our awkward exchange. I stay quiet, my heart thumping for reasons I don't care to name.
We reach Tribeca Towers's entrance. I open the car door slowly-still need my damn crutch-and before I can even grunt in protest, Lucas is outside, waiting. He moves to help me out like it's the most natural thing in the world. I manage a stiff "Thanks." He nods, expression calm but unreadable.
I hobble forward a few steps before stopping short and turning to face him. "Lucas." My voice comes out rougher than intended. He lifts a brow, waiting. I swallow. Screw it, might as well say it. "They were telling the truth, you know. About me. About what happened when I was eighteen. About... having a kid out of wedlock."
The second I say it, my chest tightens. I expect him to flinch, to step back, to look disgusted, something. Instead, he just stands there, silent, eyes steady on mine. I try to read his face. Nothing. It's maddening.
Frustration seethes beneath my skin. "Look, I'm not going to pretend to be someone I'm not. I don't need your pity. And if-"
Before I can finish, he's there-close, too close. In one swift, fluid movement, he hooks an arm around my waist and pulls me firmly against his chest. I barely have time to suck in a breath before his mouth covers mine, hot and insistent. 
My thoughts short-circuit. His lips pressed against mine, and I felt the softness and warmth of his kiss. It was unexpected and intense, making my heart race and my cheeks burn. The unfamiliar sensation between our lips grew hotter and more pressing, making it hard to think straight.
My palms fly up, pushing him back until the chill night air separates us again. "What the hell?" I demand, my voice shaking, heart thundering so loudly I'm sure he hears it. I try to reel in the rush of heat flooding my veins, but it's no use-my cheeks are burning.
He doesn't apologize. Not even close. He studies me with that calm, confident gaze, and when he speaks, his voice is low and even, "That's my answer. I don't give a damn about your past."
It's such a simple statement-quiet, sure-but it sets my nerves on edge, my pulse racing faster than I'd ever admit. "Why would you do that? You can tell me!"
His head tilts slightly, the corner of his mouth lifting into a smirk. "Because talk is cheap," he says, voice like silk. "Actions leave a mark you can't argue away."
Under the soft illumination of the nighttime city lights, his smile radiated an irresistible charm, making his features even more striking. His grey eyes, deep and enigmatic, held a mesmerizing allure. Each glance was both intense and inviting, drawing me into their depths as if revealing unspoken stories. 
The anger I had been holding onto instantly dissipated the moment I saw his face. "You could've just said so," I snap, but my words stumble out, lacking bite. He's got me all twisted up inside.
His amusement barely concealed. "You would've kept fighting me, Serena. Found another reason to run." He pauses, letting his gaze travel over my face. "Now you know I mean it."
My mouth opens-ready to hurl some furious retort-but nothing comes. God, he's right. I hate that he's right. His confidence, his unapologetic claim, it's all spinning around in my head.
After a weighted silence, he leans in once more, not touching, just close enough that I can feel his warmth. His breath brushes my ear, sending a traitorous shiver down my spine. "Go upstairs. Get some rest."
I stand there, paralyzed by the memory of his mouth on mine, the heat he left behind, the way he shattered every excuse I had. He steps back, nods once-like we just sealed some deal-and turns to his car.
The engine of his Maybach hums as it pulls away, leaving me stranded on that quiet sidewalk, heart still pounding, lips still buzzing with the imprint of his kiss.
###chapter 13
Evelyn's POV

I stormed into the living room, my Louboutins clicking against the marble floor as I paced back and forth. I could feel my parents' and Ian's eyes following my every movement, but I couldn't care less. The absolute audacity of what had just happened at that restaurant - me, Evelyn Whitmore, being asked to leave? The very thought made my blood boil.

"You won't believe what just happened," I spat out, spinning to face my family. "That supposedly exclusive 'Le Jardin' restaurant actually had the nerve to kick me out! And guess who I saw there? Serena Sinclair, dining with some strange man and a child, acting like she owned the place!"

Ian's face darkened at the mention of his ex-wife, while my mother's perfectly manicured nails drummed against her crystal wine glass. "Serena certainly has developed quite the attitude lately," Grace remarked, her voice dripping with disdain.

"Le Jardin?" My father's brow furrowed. "Isn't that one of the Yeager family's establishments?"

I nodded emphatically. "Exactly! Nina and I specifically chose it because it's supposed to be paparazzi-free and high-end, but-" I stopped mid-sentence as a thought struck me. Drew Yeager. Of course! That pathetic excuse for a man who'd spent half of college trying to date me. "Oh my God, this must be Drew's doing. He's still bitter that I rejected him!"

The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. A small, smug smile played at my lips. "How juvenile can he be? Using his family's restaurant to get my attention? As if I'd ever lower myself to date someone like him!"

My self-satisfied musings were interrupted by my phone's shrill ring. My agent's name flashed across the screen. "What now?" I answered irritably.

"Evelyn, have you managed to offend someone influential recently?" Her voice was tense. "The director just called. They're... they're recasting your role."

"WHAT?!" I nearly dropped my phone, my heart thundering in my chest. This couldn't be happening. This was my big break, the role that could propel me to the top.

My eyes burned with angry tears as I listened to her continue about the production company, Vanguard Media. Ian's head snapped up at the mention of the company name.

"Vanguard Media? That's under Harrington International Holdings," he said slowly. "Evelyn, did you somehow manage to offend the Harrington family?"

"Of course not!" I snapped. "I don't even know any of them!"

"Unless..." Ian's eyes narrowed thoughtfully. "Drew Yeager and Lucas Harrington are close friends. If Drew wanted to cause trouble..."

My hands clenched into fists. "That sneaky little weasel! He's behind all of this, using his connection with Lucas Harrington to ruin my career!"

"You know," Ian said carefully, "you could try talking to Drew. Or better yet, Lucas Harrington himself. Remember when Dad suggested that match? If you'd considered marrying Lucas-"

"Are you out of your mind?" I whirled on him. "Marry a man with baggage? Become someone's stepmother? I'd rather deal with Drew's petty revenge than stoop to that level!"

Ian shrugged, clearly done with the conversation. "Your choice, sis."





Lucas's POV
The night stretched beyond the tinted windows of my Bentley, its neon-lit darkness a fitting backdrop to my thoughts. Drew's call came just as I was reviewing some documents.
"You've been avoiding our gatherings, yet you had time to visit my restaurant and have someone removed?" Drew's voice carried its usual mix of complaint and amusement. "Should I be honored?"
"Thanks," I replied simply, my attention still half on the papers in front of me.
"Come on, Lucas! Was there a woman involved? You've never shown any interest in women." Drew's laugh echoed through the speaker. "I was starting to think Milo and Stella just appeared out of nowhere."
I glanced at my watch. "Work call coming in." 
"For fuck's sake, Lucas-" I ended his protest with a tap on the screen, switching to Miles's incoming call.
"Mr. Harrington, about the TV series Vanguard Media is investing in," Miles began carefully. "The female lead is currently Evelyn Whitmore. Production starts next month."
"Replace her." My voice left no room for argument.
"Sir?" Miles hesitated. "The Whitmore family-"
"Tell them we have someone more suitable in mind."
"Would that be... Ms. Sinclair?" 
My jaw tightened. "Watch your words, Miles. Eleanor Yates will take the role."
"Yes, sir. Right away."
Eventually, I'm in a private room at one of Manhattan's most exclusive clubs, Drew's persistence finally wearing me down. Eight years since we'd last shared a drink like this. Spencer and Jace were already there, the four of us falling into old rhythms.
"Time flies," Drew mused, raising his glass. "Let's drink properly tonight, Lucas."
His phone rang, and his expression soured as he checked the screen. "Evelyn Whitmore," he announced with a roll of his eyes, answering it on speaker.
"Drew Yeager, you pathetic, juvenile-" Her shrill voice filled the room.
Drew hung up mid-rant. "Crazy woman," he muttered, taking another drink."Who is it?" Spencer asked, eyes locked on Drew's scowl.
Drew shot back, clearly annoyed. "Evelyn Whitmore."
Spencer laughed, shaking his head. "Back in high school, weren't you into her? How come you don't feel the same now?!"
Drew rolled his eyes, taking a swig from his drink. "What's that supposed to mean?! We were young. Did you like every pretty girl you saw? If I have to say it, I actually preferred Serena Sinclair. She's definitely the most beautiful!"
I felt my grip on the glass tighten, the coolness of the bourbon doing nothing to soothe my nerves. Jace Gillard jumped into the conversation. "Speaking of Serena, didn't her engagement party with Ian Whitmore fall through recently? I heard the Whitmores used that as an excuse not to marry her anymore."
Drew leaned back, clearly irritated. "The Whitmores are probably looking down on Serena's past. It's normal for men to care, but if you care, you shouldn't have messed with her! Think about how Serena sacrificed so much for the Whitmores. I've seen her at this club multiple times, getting drunk, puking, and dealing with harassment just to secure sponsors for the family. I honestly thought Ian Whitmore not marrying Serena would make him a terrible person! But he actually chose to act like a jerk!"
I felt the weight of Drew's words pressing down on me. My hand tightened around the glass even more, ice clinking against the sides.
Drew tried to lighten the mood, but it was no use. "Enough about the Whitmores, bad luck, let's drink!"
Everyone else started to loosen up, the tension easing as drinks flowed. But I couldn't shake off the heaviness in my chest. I sat there, staring at my glass, replaying Drew's rant about Serena. It was like a punch to the gut.
Jace noticed my silence and clinked his glass against mine. "Need some air?" he nodded toward the balcony. I followed him out, the night air doing little to cool the anger simmering in my chest.
I pulled out a cigarette, the flame briefly illuminating Jace's face before I took a deep drag. The smoke filled my lungs, a temporary escape from the chaos inside.
Jace broke the silence, his voice softer. "I've met Serena a few times too. Once, she had a stomach hemorrhage, and I took her to the hospital."
I exhaled slowly, the smoke mingling with my thoughts. "She's tougher than she looks," Jace continued. "Most people wouldn't be able to take her down."
I flicked the ash into the night, feeling the weight of his words. "I need to inform you of something. Eleanor Yates will be joining Vanguard Media's new TV series as the lead actress."
Jace looked at me, his eyes narrowing. "She never collaborates with Vanguard."
I met his gaze, unwavering. "She has no choice. She already resisted, but it was futile. You need to be prepared."
Jace sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I don't mind."
I nodded, feeling a surge of determination. "Tell Drew and Spencer I'm leaving now."
Their words hit me like physical blows. My hand shook slightly as I took another drag, the smoke doing nothing to dispel the image of Serena, alone and in pain, yet still standing strong.
I finished my cigarette in three sharp draws, my mind filled with images of her quiet suffering. The same woman who now smiled so gently at my children, who carried herself with such quiet dignity - how much had she endured in silence? A protective rage surged through me, mixing with an emotion I wasn't ready to name.
"Tell them I left," I said to Jace, already heading for the exit. My footsteps echoed with purpose across the marble floor, each step carrying me closer to a decision I'd been unconsciously moving toward.
In my car, the alcohol hit harder than expected, the city lights blurring into streaks of color through the windows. But my mind was clear on one thing, crystallized by the anger and something deeper, something that made my chest ache with a fierce tenderness. I pulled out my phone, typing carefully:
"From now on, I'll be there."
###chapter 14
Serena's POV
I wake up to the faint glow filtering through my curtains. My body still feels heavy. I pause for a second, my eyes landing on my phone. There's a new message from Lucas-just a few simple words. Last night's conversation with him hangs in my mind, but his text is as cryptic as it gets: "From now on, I'll be there."
I don't have the energy to decode him right now. With an sigh, I put my phone aside and limp to the bathroom.
I spend a few minutes washing my face, doing a light makeup routine, and then I choose a crisp, black tailored pantsuit-something professional and no-nonsense. My leg still kills me sometimes, so I choose flat shoes.
Once I leave my apartment building, I'm about to hail a taxi when a sleek black Maybach pulls up. A man in a crisp suit steps out and walks up to me. He's young, polite, and carries himself with the trained confidence of a professional driver.
"Ms. Sinclair?" he says, offering me a business card. "I'm Ethan Brooks. Mr. Harrington asked me to drive you to StarRiver Group."
I pause, a flash of irritation and confusion mixing in my chest. Lucas did this without asking me first. Typical of him to make a decision on my behalf. Still, the throbbing in my leg is getting worse, so I decide not to argue.
"Fine," I mutter, sliding into the back seat. On the way, I pull out my phone and shoot Lucas a curt message: "Thanks."
He replies almost instantly with a short, "No problem."
When we arrive at StarRiver Group, Ethan gets out and hands me his business card again. "I'm your full-time driver, ma'am. I'll be back to pick you up later."
I nod. "Alright," I say simply.
Walking through the lobby, I feel dozens of eyes on me. It's no secret that yesterday's shake-up has everyone gossiping. Some people avert their gazes; others stare openly. I don't slow down. I head straight to the executive elevator that goes up to the chairman's floor.
Inside my new office, the space has been cleaned up, all trace of the previous chaos gone. I sink into the chair and pick up the phone.
"Come to my office," I say flatly.
After a few minutes, a woman in a loud, floral outfit strolls in. She's wearing a blouse with a flashy pattern and a pencil skirt two sizes too tight. Her makeup is caked on, her lipstick almost neon. She seems annoyed before she even opens her mouth.
"I'm April Carter, Mr. Sinclair's secretary," she announces.
I watch her, feeling a mocking smile tug at my lips. It's so typical of my dad to surround himself with people who look like they're part of a cheap beauty pageant. "Get a notebook," I say. "We have a lot of work to do."
April sighs dramatically, leaves the office, and comes back with a small notepad and pen. She looks like she'd rather be anywhere else. I lean forward.
"Listen carefully. First, I want a complete set of basic info on all employees from HR. Second, I want every single ongoing or planned project file from the Group Department. Third, I want the Marketing Department to bring me sales data from the past six months. Fourth, the Finance Department needs to prepare the same period's financial reports. Last, the Design Department must submit every design file-both in production and not yet launched. There's a meeting at two this afternoon with all senior department heads and the vice president, Henry Lockwood. No one's allowed to be late."
April jots down random scribbles, looking half-bored. When I ask her to bring me coffee, she stands there blankly until I ask, "What's your name again?"
She sighs. "April. April Carter."
I just nod. "Right. Coffee. Now."
She rolls her eyes and leaves. I release a frustrated breath, massaging the tense spot at my temple. This is going to be a long day.
By two o'clock, I'm seated in the conference room. Only Henry is there with me, fiddling with his pen in anxious silence. April Carter pops her head in.
"I told them about the meeting," she says with a shrug, "but no one's here yet."
"Then go and remind them," I snap. "If they're not here in ten minutes, they might as well resign."
She gives me a mock salute and disappears. Henry looks at me, surprise evident in his eyes. I lift my hand, telling him to stay quiet. I'm not here to justify my decisions.
Within ten minutes, a group of sluggish, overly confident managers file in. They're clearly trying to send a message, like they can walk all over me. They settle into their seats, exchanging smirks. I don't give them a warm welcome.
"Let's get started," I say. "Show me what you've prepared."
Cole Anderson from HR goes first, shrugging casually. "Didn't have time to compile everything. We'll do it tomorrow."
Similar excuses come from the Group Department, Marketing, and Finance. They're playing it like they own the place, giving me lazy reasons why they can't get their work done. The arrogance makes my blood boil, but I keep my tone steady.
Finally, Design Department's turn. Nina stands up. She's all smiles and polished words, acting like some sweet little angel. "I actually have our latest designs ready," she says brightly. "May I present them?"
I don't miss the triumphant look in her eyes. She spends nearly an hour flipping through slides. Dresses, suits, accessories-the works. I try to concentrate on the designs, but I can't help noticing the smug tilt of her smile.
"So," she concludes, "we're ready to launch next month. Everything's set."
I press my fingertips together. "I see room for improvement," I say bluntly.
Nina's face tightens, just for a split second, but she quickly replaces it with a fake grin. Cole Anderson jumps in to protect her. "Serena, you might want to be careful here," he says in a patronizing tone. "Nina's designs lead the fashion trend. She's won an international award. Worldwide ranking number five, Asia's number two, under her brand name Lilac. You probably shouldn't be criticizing her."
Nina fakes a humble laugh, batting her eyelashes. "Oh, Cole, please. I'm not even Asia's number one yet. It's such a shame."
I slam my hand on the table, giving them both a hard stare. "Asia's number one," I say, my voice dripping with sarcasm, "isn't that still not number one globally?" Then I turn back to Nina. "If you're so confident, aim higher. Don't act like being second in Asia is enough to shut me up."
###chapter 15
Serena's POV
I slam my hand on the table, giving them both a hard stare. "Asia's number one," I say, my voice dripping with sarcasm, "isn't that still not number one globally?" Then I turn back to Nina. "If you're so confident, aim higher. Don't act like being second in Asia is enough to shut me up."
I stand up and walk to the projector, shoving my own flash drive into the port. "Take a look," I snap, pressing a button to display a series of images from recent international runway shows. Models in bold, futuristic cuts and vibrant colors appear on screen, each design pushing boundaries. "This is what's trendy right now. These are from top designers in Milan, Paris, London-everyone is changing the game."
I flip to Nina's designs from earlier-bland reinterpretations of last year's work with slightly different colors. "Notice something? Yours look outdated next to these. The silhouettes are the same, just rehashed with minor tweaks." My voice hardens, and I point at her. "You brag about being internationally ranked, yet you're too lazy to step out of your comfort zone."
Nina's cheeks flush bright red. She opens her mouth, but no words come out. Cole Anderson tries to jump in, but I toss him a cold glare. "You want to defend her? Please. Because I'm dying to hear another excuse."
He shuts up. The rest of them just watch, probably deciding if this is the moment they gang up on me. But no one dares. Not after I've just made Nina look like a fool.
I straighten my jacket. "From now on, every single design from this department goes through me first. I don't care if it's a button on a blouse or a new collection for next season-I approve it, or it doesn't exist." I turn to Nina. "You've got one week to rework this nonsense. Next Tuesday, you'll show me something actually worth producing."
Nina swallows. "Fine," she mutters, eyes lowered.
Then I glance around the room, taking in their stunned expressions. "And for the rest of you," I say coldly, "don't think I've forgotten your little stunt. You promised materials today and came empty-handed. I want everything on my desk first thing tomorrow morning. If you fail again, your performance this month goes straight to zero."
The uproar starts immediately-half-assed protests, panicked glances, muttering under their breath. I don't bother replying. Instead, I grab my tablet and walk toward the door. Henry Lockwood quietly follows, leaving them to deal with the fallout.
We make it back to my office in silence. The door clicks shut behind us. My adrenaline is still spiking, and my injured leg throbs with every step, but I refuse to show any weakness. Henry hovers near my desk, looking unsettled.
"Serena," he begins, choosing his words carefully, "you just arrived and already pissed off the entire senior management. We'll have trouble winning them over."
I slump into my chair, rubbing my temples. "They're not here for me to 'win over,' Henry. They're here to do their jobs. But right now, they're all my father's people, and they're loyal to him, not me. If I'm going to keep StarRiver Group from falling apart, I need to root them out."
He frowns. "You plan on replacing them? All at once?"
A flare of irritation flashes through me, but I keep it in check. "Not necessarily. But I will do it if they push me." I tap my fingers on the desk. "Lawrence Sinclair has eyes everywhere. If I don't show I'm serious, they'll walk all over me. One good blow, and they'll fall in line."
Henry hesitates. "Still, if we let them go... we risk losing people who actually know how to run certain departments."
"Then we hire new ones," I snap. "We bring in experts from outside. Hell, I can hire a rookie if it means they're not going to stab me in the back."
He says nothing, but I see the doubt lingering in his gaze. I get it-this is a risky move. But after everything I've been through, I'm done playing safe.
"First order of business is to replace April Carter. She's obviously my father's spy, and I don't want her snooping around."
Henry's eyebrows shoot up. "April? That's a direct move against Lawrence. She reports to him constantly-everyone knows it."
"Exactly," I say. "We kill that channel, we cut off one major leak. He won't see the next moves coming so easily."
Henry's silent for a few beats, then nods slowly. "Alright. I'll handle the paperwork. But be prepared for backlash."
###chapter 16
Serena's POV
It's already past ten at night when I finally look up from my desk. Stacks of paperwork surround me, and my head throbs from hours of concentration. Working late feels like an old habit-back when I was stuck in the Whitmore offices, I'd sometimes stay till midnight, desperately trying to meet insane deadlines. Now, I'm here at StarRiver Group, fighting to protect everything my mom left me. Love? It seems not on my agenda anymore.
I lean against the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the skyline shimmer in the dark. A fleeting thought of Lucas crosses my mind-his deep gaze, that calm but intense presence, those broad shoulders. I force the image away. He might be warm under that icy exterior, but I'm not about to let hope mess with my head again.
My phone buzzes, snapping me out of it. It's almost 10:30. I dial Ethan Brooks, my driver. "I'm heading out," I say simply. He confirms he'll be at the entrance in five minutes.
Outside, Ethan opens the car door for me, and we drive through the quiet streets until we reach my apartment. As soon as I get out, I spot a delivery man standing by the door.
"Serena Sinclair?" he asks, holding a paper bag. "Your order from Le Bernardin."
I blink in confusion. "I didn't order anything."
He points at the receipt. I see a scrawled note: "From Milo & Stella." Immediately, I realize who's really behind it. Lucas. My chest tightens in an odd mix of gratitude and annoyance. Typical Lucas-quietly meddling.
Inside, I sit at my dining table, opening the fancy takeout box. It smells heavenly. I let out a tired sigh and dig in. Part of me wants to text Lucas, but in the end, I don't. I'm afraid of putting in all that effort, only to gain nothing and end up getting hurt myself.
The next few days pass in a blur. On my fourth day in charge of StarRiver Group, most department heads are still dragging their feet. I expected that. Henry Lockwood feeds me all sorts of insider info, enough to expose their games if I need to.
Around noon, my office phone rings. I see Beatrice Sinclair's number flashing on the screen and feel my stomach tighten. I pause for a heartbeat, then pick up the receiver.
Before I can utter a greeting, her voice blasts through the line-sharp, cold, and vibrating with anger. "You ungrateful brat," she spits. "I should've known you'd turn out exactly like your mother-no loyalty, no respect for those who gave you everything."
The venom in her words jolts me, and I clench the phone tightly. "Don't speak about my mother that way," I manage, keeping my voice steady even as my pulse thunders in my ears.
Beatrice's laugh is brittle and mocking. "You dare talk back? After all the Sinclair name has done for you, you still show nothing but disrespect. You're just as shameless as she was. I can't imagine why I ever expected better from you."
My knuckles whiten around the receiver. "I'm done listening to this," I say, each word measured. "If you want to insult me, go ahead. But leave my mother out of it."
She practically snarls on the other end. "Blind to your own faults, aren't you? So full of yourself-just a pathetic mirror image of that woman."
My voice trembles with barely contained fury. Then I hear my father, Lawrence Sinclair, grab the phone.
"Tomorrow is your grandmother's 73th birthday," he growls. "You'd better show up. Don't test my patience."
I force a laugh. "Count me in," I say, my voice dripping with mock cheer. "I wouldn't miss it for the world."
I slam the phone down, letting out a shaky breath. So they want me there. Fine. I'm gonna show them what I'm made of.
By eight in the evening, I'm wrapping up another marathon day. April Carter has already clocked out. I settle into her vacant chair and boot up her computer. I've picked up a few hacking tricks over the years. Within minutes, I'm digging through hidden folders, copying documents onto my flash drive. 
Feeling the strain in my shoulders, I call Ethan to drive me home. But when I slide into the back seat, I almost jump-it's Lucas sitting beside me.
"You look surprised," he says with a small, confident smile. His voice is smooth, almost teasing. "You're leaving earlier than usual."
I shrug, trying to calm my racing pulse. "Long day. Needed a break."
He gives a soft chuckle. Up close, he's even more striking with his piercing gray eyes and neatly cropped black hair. A short, trimmed beard highlights the sharp lines of his jaw, giving him a rugged edge. His cologne, subtle yet spicy, fills the small space between us. I swallow, reminding myself to focus.
"You're not going home," Lucas states, his tone leaving no room for argument. "We're heading to my place."
"Excuse me?" My eyebrows shoot up.
He arches one brow back. "You can call it a late dinner invitation. Or a chance to not starve yourself on instant noodles. Whichever you prefer."
I hesitate, a part of me wanting to refuse, but curiosity and exhaustion win out. "Fine," I mutter, feeling a slight sense of relief at the thought of possibly seeing Milo and Stella. It's been way too long since I've been around them.
Lucas's building is in one of Manhattan's most expensive districts. The doorman greets him by name, and we ride a private elevator straight into his enormous loft. Floor-to-ceiling windows reveal the city lights, and the plush interior screams wealth.
"You were hoping to see Milo and Stella?" Lucas says as he hands me a glass of water. There's a hint of a smirk on his lips. "They're staying with Howard Harrington tonight."
I quickly cover the disappointment that flickers in my chest. "I wasn't hoping for anything."
He lets out a low laugh. "Sorry to let you down."
Before I can snap back, he turns and heads into kitchen, rolling up the sleeves of his shirt. Even from here, I can see how his forearms flex, all corded muscle and quiet strength.
"Could you help me tie this apron?" He holds it out, glancing over his shoulder.
I step behind him, my heart thudding in my ears. My fingers brush the smooth fabric of his shirt, and I catch that same understated cologne. It's dangerously intimate, standing this close to him, smelling his warmth. For a moment, a wild thought crosses my mind: I imagine him suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing a gentle kiss to my knuckles. My cheeks burn as I picture it, and I have to shake my head to banish those reckless fantasies. I tie a neat knot, then step back quickly, my pulse racing so hard I can barely breathe.
"You hungry?" he asks, turning around to face me. His eyes flick to my mouth before locking with mine.
"Starving," I admit, but my voice comes out softer than I intend.
Lucas starts pulling out ingredients-fresh vegetables, a prime cut of steak, a couple of small lobster tails. He moves with such ease, like cooking an elegant meal in the middle of the night is the most natural thing in the world. The way his shoulders shift under the fitted fabric of his shirt is... distracting.
"You're good at this," I blurt, clearing my throat. "Not many heirs to a billion-dollar empire know their way around a kitchen."
He gives a half-shrug. "Used to live abroad with Milo and Stella. They were small, needed proper meals. So I learned." Then, he sends me a sidelong glance. 
I grimace. "It's your ex's loss. This smells amazing."
He flips the steak, the sizzle echoing in the spacious room. "It's not too late to accept," he murmurs, almost to himself, but then his gaze flicks toward me, like he's waiting to see how I react.
I blink. "What?"
He just chuckles, grabbing plates. "Never mind. Let's eat."
We end up at his sleek dining table, the view of the city rolling out before us through those massive windows. I cut into the steak, and it practically melts in my mouth. My stomach does a happy flip, and I let out a quiet groan of satisfaction.
"Better than Le Bernardin takeout?" Lucas's smirk is back in full force.
I scowl, recalling the meal he sent to my place. "Show-off."
###chapter 17
Serena's POV
He walks into the kitchen and returns with dessert: a Lemon Tart, mint leaves neatly placed on the plate. My eyebrows shoot up. I never expected him to fuss over dessert details.
He notices my surprise, flashing me a casual grin. "Walter told me you like your Lemon Tart with mint leaves," he says, tearing a small handful of leaves and scattering them over the dessert.
I pick up my fork and take a bite. The zesty lemon explodes on my tongue, followed by that cool hint of mint. It's so perfect. I glance at him, trying to figure out how he manages to be both infuriatingly cocky and quietly thoughtful.
When we finish, I move to gather the plates. "I'll handle these," I say. "Where's your dishwasher?"
Lucas nods toward the kitchen. "Knock yourself out," he says, but there's amusement in his tone. Then he steps behind me, takes the apron he wore earlier, and slips it around my waist.
My breath hitches as I feel the warmth of his chest almost grazing my back. I edge away, trying to regain my composure. "I can tie it," I mumble, fingers fumbling with the apron strings. Just as I turn to set a plate in the dishwasher, my elbow knocks another dish off the counter. It shatters against the floor, and a jagged piece slices my finger.
"Damn it," I hiss, blood welling up instantly.
Lucas is by my side in a flash, his grip firm yet gentle as he examines the cut. "Hold still," he orders, voice low and laced with concern. A moment later, he's running my hand under cool water, pressing a clean towel against the wound. I try to pull back, but he doesn't let me. His eyes narrow, like I'm some stubborn child. "Stop moving."
My heart pounds at the way he's taking charge. He's so... overwhelmingly protective. And I'm not used to that-nobody is protective of me.
When he finishes bandaging my hand, I clear my throat, feeling strangely vulnerable. "It's just a small cut."
He ignores my remark. "I'm taking you home," he says, his gaze unwavering. There's no point fighting him on this, especially when I'm too tired and the cut's throbbing.
We end up in his car, and this time, Lucas is at the wheel. I sink into the passenger seat, the skyline flashing by in bright neon. My mind drifts to the Sinclair family. My grandmother's party is tomorrow, and I already know it's going to be a showdown.
Lucas shoots me a sidelong glance. "Busy tomorrow?"
I press my lips together. "I have some... family obligations."
He nods, then says, "Keep next month's seventeenth open for me."
I turn to him, surprised. "Why?"
His eyes stay on the road, but the corner of his mouth quirks up in a faint smile. "You'll see."
Something about the way he smiles makes me feel an odd wave of comfort. Maybe it's the way his strong hands grip the steering wheel, or how his voice drops an octave whenever he speaks to me. Either way, I find myself nodding. "Fine."
When we arrive at my apartment, he parks smoothly at the curb and looks at me. For a moment, neither of us speaks. There's a softness in his gaze I wasn't expecting, like he wants to say something else. I feel a knot form in my stomach-am I really letting him get this close?
"Thank you... for everything," I manage, slipping out of the car.
His responding smile is calm and almost affectionate. "Get some rest."
I head upstairs, half-dazed. Everything tonight seemed too warm, too fantastic-completely unlike my usual life.
The next morning, my phone blares way too early-seven on the dot. I drag myself up, ignoring the throbbing cut on my finger. When I see the caller ID, my mood nosedives. Beatrice Sinclair.
I pick up, not bothering to hide my irritation. "Yes?"
Her voice is immediately harsh. "You'd better show up for my birthday. And don't you dare embarrass me in front of our relatives." She mutters a string of insults under her breath.
I take a long breath. "I'll be there," I say, sounding icy even to my own ears, then end the call. I toss the phone aside and stare at the ceiling. It's barely morning, and I already feel like clawing someone's eyes out.
After a quick shower and minimal makeup, I glance at a framed photo on my bedside table-my mom, Helen Sinclair, smiling so softly it makes my heart ache. I promise her silently that I'll protect what she left behind, no matter how hostile the Sinclair household gets.
By ten, I'm standing at the gates of the Sinclair family mansion. The place looks exactly like it did when I was a kid-grand, cold, and brimming with an arrogance that always made my skin crawl. A handful of relatives loiter in the courtyard, casting me contemptuous looks like they're sizing up an unwanted stray dog. I've endured these stares my whole life; they don't even sting anymore.
Inside, the grand foyer is decked out with expensive decorations, for Beatrice's 73rd birthday. I step in and spot her sitting at the center like a queen on her throne. My father, Lawrence, stands off to the side with Angela, and Nina hangs nearby, looking smug as ever.
Beatrice's gaze locks on me, and her lips curl. "You're late."
I swallow the retort that threatens to spill out. Late? It's exactly ten, the time she told me to come. "Nice to see you too, Grandmother," I say, voice dripping with sarcasm.
She narrows her eyes, but I don't break eye contact. If she wants a fight, I'm ready. "You should feel honored to be invited into this house," she snaps.
I just shrug. "Where's Caden? Not joining the fun?"
Lawrence steps forward, clearing his throat. "He worked late last night. Needs rest."
I bite back a bitter laugh. "Is that so? How convenient."
Nina seizes the moment to glide over, wearing a faux sweet smile. "Serena, I'm so glad you made it. Grandma's been waiting for you."
###chapter 18
Serena's POV
I can practically see the rest of the relatives eyeing us, ready to gossip. My stomach churns. Nina's act drives me insane; it's all part of her ploy to stay in everyone's good graces. But I force a polite nod.
I barely step away from Nina when someone else calls out to me in a mocking tone. I glance over and recognize Margaret Sinclair, my father's younger sister, standing among a cluster of Sinclair relatives. Her perfectly styled hair and glittery jewelry reflect her usual thirst for attention. She points at me with her champagne flute.
"Serena," Margaret says, loud enough for everyone to hear, "did you really come empty-handed to your grandmother's birthday? What happened-too broke to buy a gift?"
I bite my lip. A wave of tension washes over me. Before I can speak, Beatrice makes a dismissive sound from across the room. "Even if she did bring something," she mutters, "it'd probably be cheap junk."
Their contempt is practically suffocating. I straighten my posture. "I don't recall you asking for gifts, Grandmother."
Nina sidles up, wearing that fake smile she's perfected. "Oh, Serena, don't blame Grandma. She just wants to see if you're finally ready to take responsibility. Didn't you splurge at that fancy restaurant with friends a while back? Yet now you claim you have no money to honor Grandma on her big day?"
I clench my fists, breath hitching. "Well, Nina," I say, my tone measured, "at least I pay for my own meals instead of ripping off other people's designs."
A flicker of panic crosses her face. "What... what are you talking about?"
I nod at the outfit draped over a mannequin in the corner-clearly meant for Beatrice. "That dress you claim to have designed for Grandma? It's from Whitmore's SW spring collection. A leftover from last year that nobody wanted."
Nina's cheeks flush. "That's nonsense. I simply drew inspiration-"
"Knock it off," I cut in, my voice cold. "You changed the collar, maybe added a different belt, but it's the same pattern. You can fool everyone else, but I worked in Whitmore. I know exactly where it came from."
An uneasy stir ripples through the Sinclair relatives. A couple of them step forward to peer at the garment. Nina tries to laugh it off. "Well... it's just that Grandma's unique style deserved a classic piece."
Beatrice narrows her eyes, torn between scolding Nina and maintaining her own dignity. Margaret quickly fans the flames. "Serena, you're making a scene. It's a family gathering, not a battleground."
I shrug. "Tell that to the person who started the fight."
An awkward hush settles, broken only by the occasional whisper. That's when I decide it's time to drop my own surprise. I pull a small velvet pouch from my purse and hold it up. "Since you're all so concerned about whether I brought a gift... maybe you'll appreciate this."
Inside is a stunning ruby necklace, set in ornate filigree that dates back to medieval Europe. The gemstones catch the light with every subtle movement, sending red sparks across the marble floor. A hush falls over the room, sharper and more profound than before.
Margaret's eyes widen. She's known to dabble in antique jewelry, and I can see her struggling not to look impressed. "That can't be... This piece was sold at a Manhattan auction for over a million dollars." She sounds reluctant, but she's forced to admit the truth. "It's genuine, isn't it?"
I raise a brow. "You tell me." Her silence is enough. I turn to Beatrice, extending the necklace with a flourish. "Would you like this, Grandmother?"
Her eyes gleam with greed-just for an instant. But then she sets her jaw. "What makes you think I'd accept this from you?"
"Right." I pocket the necklace again, ignoring the collective gasp from the relatives crowding closer for a better look. "No sense in forcing an unwanted gift."
Beatrice's expression darkens, and Nina's face contorts with jealousy. I almost feel a perverse sense of satisfaction at their frustration.
More relatives trickle in, and soon the living room is bustling. Lawrence announces we'll move to the backyard for a special presentation in Grandma's honor. He leads everyone to a makeshift open-air cinema, beaming like he's orchestrated the biggest surprise.
"I have prepared a video tribute for Mother's birthday," Lawrence declares. "A series of precious memories."
I hang back near the projector, catching the eye of one of the tech crew I spoke with earlier. My instructions were crystal clear: play my piece first, then switch to Lawrence's. I watch him nod, and a flutter of anticipation stirs in my chest. 
The screen flickers on, and a hush falls over the crowd. Everyone expects some sentimental slideshow of Beatrice's photos or something equally cutesy. Instead, the first image is a selfie of Lawrence with April Carter-my so-called secretary-wrapped around him in a motel room. The angle is raunchy and leaves no doubt about what they're doing.
A collective gasp sweeps the crowd. Some relatives stifle cries of shock or mutter curses under their breath. A second photo flashes on screen: Lawrence leaning in for a kiss, April wearing next to nothing. Then a string of messages, full of cheesy romance lines and explicit undertones. I catch glimpses of phrases like "I'll make you head secretary for life" and "no one can replace you in my office". My stomach twists at the sheer sleaziness.
###chapter 19
Serena's POV
The crowd stands there, completely stunned by the intimate photos and explicit messages flashing on the big screen. I see several cousins shielding their eyes, and more than a few older relatives muttering curses under their breath.
I cross my arms, my pulse hammering in my ears as I watch the chaos unfold. Margaret seems torn between wanting to tear the projector down and sprinting out of this nightmare. Beatrice, my grandmother, looks like she might faint. Her face is white, her mouth slack-an expression I've never seen on her before. And Nina? She's hovering near the snack table, half-hidden, looking like she'd rather vanish than be associated with any of this.
Finally, Lawrence steps out of the house, gift bag in hand, wearing a self-satisfied smirk. His eyes lock on the images for half a second, and his face goes ghostly white.
"What the-" he stammers, voice cracking in raw panic. He drops the gift bag, the wrapped box clattering onto the grass. A shocked hush ripples through the crowd, and then he bolts forward, screaming at the top of his lungs.
"Turn it off!" he roars, jabbing a finger at the stunned staff. "TURN IT OFF RIGHT NOW! Fuck-"
His voice is shaking with rage, and I can practically see the veins bulging in his neck. The rest of the family stands there, dumbstruck, as he flails around, frantically yanking wires in a desperate attempt to kill the feed, until the machine finally shuts down.
After a long breath, Lawrence, panting with rage, scans the sea of wide-eyed Sinclair relatives. "I-I'm sorry for the confusion," he finally sputters. "Everyone, let's just... let's just focus on Mother's birthday. Please go enjoy dinner. This-this is a setup. Someone's trying to sabotage me. This is all fake, AI nonsense!" But the hush that's fallen over the crowd tells me nobody's buying the AI excuse.
He practically chokes on his words. The man is drowning in humiliation and can't even find a rope to cling to. I stand off to the side, feigning disinterest, but inside, I'm savoring every second of his downfall.
People shuffle around, clearly rattled, but Lawrence claps his hands and forces a shaky smile. "Let's all return to the dining hall," he says. "Don't let these ridiculous, uh, photos ruin the evening."
No one believes him, though. I see Sinclair relatives muttering among themselves, throwing side-eyes at him. A few cast suspicious looks my way, like they're guessing I'm behind the big reveal. I just shrug, adjusting the bandage on my finger and ignoring their stares.
Beatrice catches sight of the explicit pictures on the screen. Her face goes dangerously dark. She looks like she's ready to burst a blood vessel. 
Angela steps forward, tears streaking her made-up face. Her voice trembles as she looks up at Beatrice with sheer desperation. "Mother," she pleads, "this is humiliating-Lawrence's affair with that woman... I can't bear it. Please, you have to help me."
Beatrice's jaw set rigidly and her eyes ablaze with anger. She places a hand on Angela's shoulder, trying to steady the younger woman. "Stop your crying," she orders softly, though her tone is ice-cold.
Beatrice narrows her eyes, the muscle in her jaw jumping as she exhales. "That secretary," she says, practically spitting out the word. "I want her to learn her lesson. And I want her gone. Permanently. Understand?"
Angela nodded slightly.
Inside the dining hall, I find my assigned seat. A man I don't recognize-fat, wavy blond hair, mid-thirties maybe-sits down next to me. He gives me a stiff nod, but I barely acknowledge him. My mind is already halfway out the door. I can't stand these events and their fake civility.
Eventually, the main course arrives, and the room hums with whispered conversations. When dessert finally comes, I set my fork down, my appetite long gone.
I push back my chair and head for the exit, weaving around tuxedoed men and overdressed women. But before I can escape the suffocating atmosphere, two figures block my path: Nina Sinclair and Ian Whitmore. Nina's wearing her usual plastic smile, while Ian hovers awkwardly behind her.
Nina's voice drips with false concern. "Serena, leaving so soon? Are you okay? After all the chaos, we just wanted to check on you."
Ian tries to look sympathetic. "Yeah, we... we were worried. It's been a while since we talked."
I roll my eyes so hard I nearly see the ceiling. "Worried? About me? Right." I can practically taste the poison in the air. "Please, spare me the act. I'm done pretending we're chummy."
Nina's smile wavers. "Serena, we're just trying to be nice-"
"Nice?" I snap, cutting her off."Don't insult my intelligence."
Ian opens his mouth, but I stare him down, daring him to speak. He shuts it again.
I sidestep them and keep walking, my heels echoing on the marble floor. But before I can actually make it out, I hear Lawrence's enraged bark from somewhere behind me.
"Serena! Get back here, now."
I clench my teeth. Great. Another round. With a sigh, I turn around and follow his voice up a winding staircase to the second-floor garden terrace. The night sky hangs overhead, the city lights twinkling in the distance. If this weren't a Sinclair-owned property, it'd almost be beautiful.
Lawrence stands there, hands balled into fists at his sides, jaw clenched like he's trying not to explode. "You," he hisses, "did you do this? The video, the photos... you think you can humiliate me like this?"
I cross my arms over my chest. "What are you talking about? You're the star of that production, not me."
His eyes narrow. "Don't play dumb. Only you would have any reason to sabotage me in front of the entire family."
I let out a dry laugh. "You're giving me too much credit. Maybe the universe finally decided to expose you."
He exhales, a cruel sound. "Fine. Keep denying. But you owe this family a debt, and you're going to repay it."
"Repay it?" I snap. "After what you pulled tonight, you still think you get to order me around? Don't make me laugh."
His mouth twists into a scowl, but he forces his voice to stay calm. "I have someone I want you to meet. A man named James Chapman. You saw him at dinner-he was sitting next to you. Well, he's from a respectable branch of the family and works at Harrington International Holdings."
I raise an eyebrow. "So, you want me to be his wife? Why don't you marry him off to Nina? She loves anything with a big wallet."
Lawrence's nostrils flare. "Don't test me, Serena. This arrangement could benefit us all. You're not getting any younger, and if you continue this rebellious streak-"
I cut him off, pure fury rising in my chest. "I don't care who he is. I'm not a chess piece you can move around."
Lawrence snarls under his breath but doesn't press the point. He knows better than to argue when I'm like this. He storms off, mumbling something about "that damn girl" and "ruining everything." Typical.
No sooner has he disappeared down the stairs than I hear footsteps behind me. I turn to see James Chapman, that stranger from dinner, approaching. Under the terrace lights, I notice he's actually not bad-looking-a polished, corporate vibe, maybe 35, wearing an expensive suit. But the sneer on his face makes my skin crawl.
He looks me up and down, like I'm an item for sale. "So you're Serena Sinclair," he says, voice dripping with condescension. "I heard you've been stirring up trouble. What are you, some rebellious little princess with no real assets?"
My jaw clenches. "Excuse me?"
He shrugs. "Just calling it like I see it. Your reputation... not exactly stellar. And rumor has it, you're strapped for cash. Why else would your father be so desperate to marry you off?"
I glare daggers at him. Every cell in my body screams to knock that smug grin off his face. But I hold back-barely. "You don't know a thing about me. And frankly, I don't give a damn about your opinion."
James laughs, a low, patronizing sound. "Well, if your father wants to arrange something, I might consider it... for the right price. But let's be real-someone like you? Hardly first-class material."
###chapter 20
Serena's POV
I meet his gaze, cold and unwavering. "Then you'd better find someone else, because I'd rather burn this entire mansion down than tie my life to a jerk like you."
He raises an eyebrow, his grin never fading. "We'll see," he says, giving me one last condescending glance before strolling off.
I head downstairs. My mind's focused on just one thing: getting the hell out of here. But as soon as I step past the foyer, I spot Nina lingering by the main entrance, arms folded, an annoyingly smug look on her face.
"Serena," she calls, voice dripping with fake concern. "Wait up."
I don't slow down. "What is it?"
She rushes over, blocking my path. "I heard Dad wants to arrange something with James Chapman. Makes sense, doesn't it? He's well-paid, fairly high up at Harrington International Holdings, great connections-"
"Don't waste your breath." I cut her off, feeling that familiar flash of anger. "I'm not interested in middle-aged jerk who think they're God's gift to women."
Nina's eyes flick over my face. "You're being too picky. You know, you're not exactly young anymore, and a man with stable finances-"
"Spare me," I snap. "Having a decent paycheck doesn't make him a decent human being. You, of all people, should know appearances mean nothing."
Her face twitches at that backhanded jab. "Fine," she says sweetly, "but keep in mind, you could do worse. At least he's not a total nobody."
I let out a harsh laugh. "He's beyond nobody-he's a smug creep who thinks I'm desperate. And if you're so eager, why not marry him yourself?"
Nina stiffens, and for a second, her mask cracks. "My business is none of yours," she hisses under her breath.
I step around her. "Exactly. Now get out of my way."
She doesn't pursue me further, but I can feel her glare on my back. I know what she's thinking. She wants me shackled to some mediocrity so that her own path stays open-especially if she's angling for Ian Whitmore or any other prestigious connection.
I wake up the next Monday morning, half-expecting more chaos to explode in my face. The first thing is April Carter turning up at my office around lunchtime, eyes red and puffy. She clutches a resignation letter to her chest, trembling so hard she can barely hold it out to me.
"I'm leaving," she chokes, voice wobbling.
I glance up and notice faint bruises on her neck and what looks like scratch marks near her collar. It's obvious somebody roughed her up, likely on Angela's orders. I don't bother pretending to sympathize.
"You already signed an NDA when you joined StarRiver Group," I remind her, flipping through the letter. "Anything that happened here-"
She cuts in, tears streaming. "I know, I won't say anything. Please, just let me go."
She looks so pitiful it's almost laughable. Once, she acted all high and mighty, throwing herself at Lawrence for power or money or both. Now she's just a terrified pawn being kicked off the board.
"Your final paycheck will be processed next week," I say coolly, handing back her letter. "Don't come back."
She sniffles, nods, and practically sprints out. I'm left feeling nothing-no pity, no regret. She chose this twisted game; she lost. End of story.
That same afternoon, I call Henry Lockwood into my office. He steps in, calm as ever, and I give him a quick rundown. "April's out. We need a new secretary."
He nods. "I've shortlisted a few candidates, but one stands out: Vincent Chadwick. Relatively new to the field, good at administrative work, no complicated ties-"
"Sounds perfect," I say, leaning back in my chair. "Set up a meeting."
Henry hesitates. "Are you sure about someone so inexperienced?"
I shrug. "He won't cause trouble if he's on a tight leash. And that's exactly what I need right now."
Henry nods in agreement. "I'll let him know."
Tuesday arrives, and with it comes a scheduled design presentation by Nina Sinclair. She's got this ridiculous entourage from the Design Department, led by some so-called design chief named Linda Finley. They settle into the conference room, flipping through slides of bland, recycled sketches.
I sit at the head of the table, tapping my pen against my notebook. "That's it?" I say when Nina finishes her pitch. "It looks like you took a bunch of random 'trendy' pieces and cobbled them together. Where's the identity? Where's the brand uniqueness?"
Nina flushes. "We're trying to integrate multiple influences-"
"Cut the crap," I interrupt. "StarRiver Group needs its own voice. What I see is a halfhearted patchwork of mainstream knockoffs. This isn't going to fly."
Linda Finley lets out a derisive snort. "You're the chairman, right? Maybe you can enlighten us with your brilliant creative ideas."
I fix her with a glare. "Be careful what you wish for, Linda. Starting today, I'm taking direct oversight of the Design Department. Every design concept goes through me."
A ripple of shock spreads across the table. Nina's eyes widen, and Linda clamps her mouth shut. I push my chair back, standing up. "If you want to keep your job, step up your game. I'm not here to babysit lazy copycats."
As I turn to leave, Nina blurts, "Wait, Serena-there's a reason Dad recommended me to manage this department. I'm-"
I hold up a hand. "Actually, Nina, I have an announcement. Since you've already been so involved in StarRiver Group's operations, I'm promoting you. Effective immediately, you're the new general manager of the entire company."
Her jaw drops. Everyone around the table gasps. One or two manage half-hearted claps, clearly confused. Nina's eyes dart between me and the others. "You... what?"
I flash her a sweet smile. "Consider it Father's will, right? He's always praising your competence. Now you can prove it." I step closer, pat her shoulder gently. "I'm sure you'll do a great job."
She looks stunned, unsure whether to feel flattered or trapped. The room buzzes with whispering. I walk out, letting the heavy conference room door slam behind me.
Back in my office, I barely have time to sit down before the phone rings. I snatch it up, already suspecting who it might be.
"Serena." My father's voice practically vibrates with fury. "What the hell are you doing promoting Nina to GM? You think this is some kind of joke?"
I lean back in my chair, twirling a pen between my fingers. "Isn't that what you wanted? She's your prized protégé. I'm just honoring your efforts. This is StarRiver Group, after all. You and Nina have been involved for years. Why not let her run it?"
He hisses through the receiver. "Don't act coy. You know exactly what you're doing."
###chapter 21
Serena's POV
"You're right, Nina's been at StarRiver for years," he had boasted, voice dripping smug satisfaction, "not like you, some newcomer. If you really want StarRiver managed right, putting Nina in charge is your smartest move yet!"
I gave a polite chuckle, though I felt nothing but scorn. "Well, I'll consider that your good wish, then."
He didn't hear the sarcasm under my forced civility. "By the way," he went on, "don't forget our arrangement with James Chapman-this is not optional. You need to-"
"That's my private business," I cut him off, my patience gone. "I don't need you meddling."Before he could get another word out, I pressed the end-call button. 
The second I toss my phone aside, it buzzes again. For a split second, I think it's him calling back, but no. It's Ian Whitmore. Ugh. I roll my eyes. Probably some self-congratulatory text about me and Nina reconciling or how he can't wait to see me at some fancy function. Without a second thought, I swipe left, delete it.
I sink into my office chair, running a hand through my hair. The entire design department is in chaos thanks to Nina's half-baked sketches, and I'm busy drafting a new plan for our upcoming line. 
Then my cellphone rings again. I glance at the caller ID, Lucas. My pulse jumps a little despite myself. There's just something about his name lighting up my screen that makes my heart skip. I answer casually, hoping he can't hear that slight hitch in my breath.
"Lucas," I say.
He chuckles, voice deep and smooth as silk. "Seems like you picked up a bit faster this time, Serena."
I roll my eyes even though he can't see me. "You caught me at a good time. I was about to throw my phone at the wall."
He laughs, that warm, throaty sound that travels straight from the speaker to my chest. "By the way," he adds, his tone dropping a notch, "I told you, call me something else."
I lean back, pretending to think. "Let's see... Luc? Or how about I just call you 'trouble'?"
His voice turns playful. "Close, but not quite what I had in mind. I'm leaning toward something more intimate. Like 'hubby.'"
I bark out a short laugh, heat flooding my cheeks even though I hate to admit it. "Yeah, keep dreaming."
Lucas doesn't push it, but I can sense his satisfaction. He's the kind of man who can wait out a storm, confident everything will bend in his direction eventually. And maybe he's right. There's a magnetic pull in the way he talks, the way he looks, that's almost impossible to ignore.
"Anyway," he continues, "You know that date I told you to keep open? It's in two days, but I need your help today. Milo and Stella have fittings for some outfits they'll need for the big event. Seaguard International Mall, Aurora Devereaux-already booked."
I open my mouth to protest. But he's quick. "Before you say no, I want them to have a good time. And you're the only one who knows exactly what will look perfect. I promise I'll make it up to you."
He says "make it up to you" in such a low, suggestive tone that my insides tighten. Damn him. I press my lips together. "Fine," I mutter. "But don't expect me to be thrilled about it."
"That's my girl," he says, voice practically humming with pleasure. And before I can snap back, he hangs up.
I push out a sigh, gather my bag, and head downstairs. Sure enough, Stella and Milo are waiting in the lobby with Ethan Brooks. Milo's leaning against a pillar, looking at the overhead light fixture like it's the most interesting thing he's ever seen, while Stella's fussing with her hair in the reflection of a window.
"Hey, kids," I say, masking any trace of annoyance.
A flicker of excitement crosses Stella's face. "Hi, Serena! Dad said we get to pick out dresses and tuxedos for some big event. Can we get something sparkly?"
I grin despite myself. "Sparkly might be an option. Let's go see what we can find."

Their excitement is infectious, though, and by the time we reach Seaguard International Mall, even I'm feeling a little more lighthearted. We wind our way to Aurora Devereaux, a high-end boutique known for custom-tailored outfits. The store's polished floors gleam under crystal chandeliers. Rows of designer gowns and suits line every wall in a rainbow of silk, satin, and chiffon.
The SA at the front recognizes me-probably from some tabloid shot of StarRiver Group's new boss-and rushes forward to greet us.
The second we step inside, though, I spot two very unwelcome figures: Nina Sinclair and Evelyn Whitmore. They're practically drooling over a rack of high-end gowns, giggling like they own the place.
Nina lifted a sky-blue silk gown, holding it up in front of the mirror for a moment, then glanced over at Evelyn with a teasing grin. "You used to say you weren't interested in Lucas Harrington, yet here you are, gearing up for his charity gala in a fancy dress?"
Evelyn rolled her eyes in mild exasperation, letting out a dismissive snort. "Who said I'm dressing up for him? I do this for myself!" She ran her fingers along the soft pink satin gown draped over her arm, looking quite pleased with herself. "And maybe I'll dazzle the entire crowd while I'm at it. Let them see what true taste looks like."
"Well, you're gorgeous and have the figure to match," Nina remarked, darting a sideways glance at the gown Evelyn was holding. Her voice carried a hint of flattery. "The moment you walk in, you'll be the center of attention."
"Exactly. Wouldn't want to waste these natural gifts." Evelyn flipped her hair over one shoulder, a smug smile tugging at her lips. She motioned for the SA to hand her the soft pink gown, pressing it against her body as she studied herself in the mirror. "This one's not bad, don't you think?"
Nina's gaze flicked over the gown's smooth lines, and she nodded with a smile. "The color suits you. The style is eye-catching. If you pair it with a simple diamond necklace, you'll look even more radiant."
"Then it's settled." Evelyn struck a slight pose, clearly satisfied with how the gown accentuated her waist. "On the night of the event, I'll make everyone regret not taking a closer look at me."
###chapter 22
Serena's POV
Milo and Stella grip each of my hands, their eyes glowing with excitement as they take in the glittering racks of designer gowns and tuxedos. My plan is straightforward: pick up their custom outfits and leave before someone recognizes me. Or so I hope.
But of course, things never go that smoothly.
"Serena Sinclair?!"
I tense the moment I hear that shrill, all-too-familiar voice. It's Evelyn Whitmore.
I roll my eyes and sneak a quick hand into my purse to start recording on my phone. I already know this woman's going to run her mouth the second she sees me.
Evelyn zeroes in on me, voice pitched loud enough for half of Manhattan to hear. "Wow, can't wait to be a stepmom, Serena? Throwing money around on fancy clothes just so you can-what, trap a guy?" She flicks her hair with a mocking grin. "Because let's face it, with your little 'history,' you don't have much else to offer, do you? You think dripping in designer labels will make people forget who you really are?"
My jaw tightens, but I catch Milo and Stella darting anxious looks up at me. I force a small smile for them, then calmly pull out my phone. "Interesting opinion," I say. "Let's see if you're so cocky after hearing yourself on tape."
I tap the screen, and Evelyn's earlier jeers play back, her words dripping with ridicule. She pales instantly, glancing around as if she can't believe I had the audacity to record her.
"You-" she sputters, cheeks flaming. "How dare you-"
I arch a brow. "Keep talking, Evelyn, and I'll post this little gem online. I'm sure your agent will love handling that scandal, especially after you just lost a show." I watch the rage swell in her eyes, but Nina grabs her arm, whispering something that sounds like "not worth it."
I can't help letting out a low, humorless laugh. She's so easy to provoke. For a moment, silence crackles in the air-then she tries a different angle.
"You know," Evelyn says icily, "some of us remember your past. Eighteen years old, sneaking around And now, the father of these brats? Just a cop, isn't he? They can wear all the fancy tuxedos in the world, but they'll never climb out of that gutter."
Nina puts on a sweet, fake-lipped smile. "Evelyn, let's not-"
But Evelyn doesn't stop. "So go ahead, dress them up. That won't change a thing."
Milo and Stella stare at me, confusion and hurt flickering in their big eyes. I sigh, pushing back a flash of anger. "Why don't you worry about your own affairs?" I say coolly. "I'm not here to please you."
She opens her mouth like she wants to fling another insult, but I dismiss her with a bored wave. I turn my full attention to the kids, guiding them toward a well-dressed store assistant. She's already holding two sleek garment bags-one black tailcoat for Milo, one adorable little gown for Stella. The SA mentions these were finalized just this morning.
Milo practically bounces on his toes. "Is that for me? Stella, look at this!" He dashes forward, eyes wide with excitement. Stella, more reserved, follows, her cheeks flushed.
"Let's try them on," I say gently.
It's like watching a fairytale scene unfold. Milo emerges in a crisp black tuxedo with perfect tailoring, looking like a tiny prince. Stella's dress is a soft, pale blue that complements her big, bright eyes. My heart swells seeing them beam with happiness. I snap a few photos, open my messages, and send them straight to Lucas Harrington, who's probably in the middle of crushing some international business deal.
My phone buzzes.
Lucas: "You think they look good?"
I can't hold back a small laugh. "Of course," I text back. "They're amazing."
He replies with a single word: "Good."
Even through the screen, I can practically picture the half-smile curling his lips, the hint of satisfaction in those intense gray eyes. It's frustratingly attractive. I inhale slowly and pocket my phone.
Just then, another SA appears, holding a breathtaking gown in her arms-something shimmering, beaded, and clearly made to turn heads. She heads straight for me.
I blink. "I didn't order any-"
Then it hits me. Lucas. My breath catches in my throat as I stare at the stunning dress before me, my fingers trembling slightly as they brush against the luxurious fabric. The man has a habit of pulling stunts like this, dropping gifts without warning, but this... this is beyond anything I could have imagined.
My heart races as I take in every detail - the perfect cut, the way it catches the light, how it's exactly my style but somehow even better than anything I would have chosen myself. Lucas, always so thoughtful, so attuned to exactly what would make my heart soar. How does he do it? How does he always know?
A strange mix of emotions washes over me - pure joy at the sight of such a beautiful piece, deep gratitude for his thoughtfulness. Nothing quite compares to the thrill of discovering beautiful clothes, especially when they come from someone who understands you. I want to try it on immediately, to see how it transforms in the light, to spin and watch it move.
Before I can even say a word, Evelyn swoops in from nowhere.
"I'll take that," she says sharply, snatching the gown right out of the SA's hands.
The SA looks alarmed. "Ms. Whitmore, that's not-"
Evelyn tosses her hair, eyes gleaming greedily. "Whoever sees it first gets first rights to buy, right? Sorry, Serena, but I found it now. I'm not letting it slip away."
I set my jaw. "Listen, Evelyn, that dress was commissioned for me-"
She cuts me off with a sneer. "Commissioned, stolen, doesn't matter. I want it. And if you or this store clerk try to stop me, I'll make sure your brand gets blasted on every social media platform." She whips out her phone, waving it like a weapon.
Nina flutters behind her, all fake sympathy. "Oh, Evelyn, maybe it's not worth fighting over-"
"Shut it," Evelyn snaps. Then she eyes me with that smug grin. "So, you gonna make this easy, or do I have to raise a little hell in front of these precious kids?"
I let out a slow breath, mustering a cold, thin smile. "Alright, how about we settle this like adults?"
Her eyes narrow. "I'm listening."
I gesture at the gown she's draped over her arm. "If it fits, you can have it. For free. But if it doesn't, you owe me the full price. And that's not a small number."
Evelyn's lips curl into a mocking smile. "Dear Serena, I maintain my figure. You should've worried about your waistline before you made a bet with me. Deal."
She spins on her heel, practically dragging Nina behind her, and they disappear into the fitting room. Less than a minute later, frantic whispers and irritated grunts filter through the door.
###chapter 23
Serena's POV
I settle onto the plush velvet sofa in the VIP lounge of Aurora Devereaux, crossing my legs as gracefully as I can manage. Milo and Stella sit beside me, nibbling on little chocolate pastries the boutique provided. Their eyes keep flicking toward the fitting-room door, where Evelyn Whitmore and Nina Sinclair have barricaded themselves with my dress. I hear muffled curses and the frantic rustle of expensive fabric.
"She's stuck," Stella whispers, eyes wide with curiosity. Milo snickers under his breath.
I gently pat their shoulders. "Don't gloat," I say. "But if she tears it, she's paying triple."
I sipping from the tiny cup of coffee in my hand. "Having trouble in there?" I call out sweetly.
No response at first. Then comes Evelyn's sharp hiss. "Nina, pull harder! That zipper can't be stuck!"
I'm afraid that shimmering dress jammed against her torso, likely about to burst at the seams. I shoot Milo a reassuring glance; he and Stella exchange a giggle. They know exactly what's going on-Evelyn's arrogance just met cold reality. Apparently, her "perfect figure" isn't so perfect after all.
A solid minute passes before Nina finally cracks open the door. She's flushed, hair escaping her neat updo. Evelyn appears behind her, face bright red, clutching the half-zipped gown around her waist.
Evelyn's glare locks on me. "This-" She tugs in frustration at the dress's bodice. "This must be defective. There's no way I gained weight."
Nina nods vigorously. "Yes, obviously the sizing is off!"
I roll my eyes. "Maybe you should try less complaining and more honesty. You agreed to the bet-wear it, or pay up."
Evelyn sets her jaw, shooting a furious look at Milo and Stella, almost like it's their fault. Then she snaps her gaze back to me. "Fine. Let's see how you look in it. If you can fit this thing so easily, prove it."
She thinks she's baiting me. I just arch a brow and pass my coffee to Stella, telling her and Milo to wait with the pastries. I saunter into the fitting room, ignoring Evelyn's hateful stare. The SA hovers, ready to assist, but I wave her off. I know exactly how to slip into this dress. It's custom-made.
Sure enough, the dress slides up like silk over my skin. The zipper glides without resistance. The mirror confirms it: shimmering crystals flow seamlessly along my figure, hugging every curve in a way that's both elegant and bold. I smile to myself. Lucas really does know how to make me feel untouchable.
As I adjust my gown to fit better, I hear Evelyn say "brother," and a familiar voice responds-Ian Whitmore.
I yank the curtain aside and step out. The store goes dead silent. Evelyn's mouth falls open. Nina almost drops her phone. Even the other customers pause to stare. I can see the reflection of Milo and Stella in the nearby mirror, their eyes turning into big, gleaming saucers.
"Wow," Stella breathes, beaming. "You look like a princess!"
Milo nods furiously. "A super-awesome princess!"
I give the kids a quick wink, then level my gaze at Evelyn. "You were saying?"
She's speechless, her expression a mixture of envy and burning anger. Ian Whitemore sees me in the gown, and practically loses his train of thought. I catch the flicker of astonishment in his gaze before Nina yanks him back to reality.
Evelyn recovers enough to hiss, "Fine. You proved it fits. Big deal. Just name your price so I can walk away from this stupid fiasco."
I fold my arms, letting the crystals sparkle under the bright boutique lights. "20 grand. Unless you want to risk ripping it trying again." I watch her expression darken at the number.
Ian steps in, coughing. "Evelyn, let's not blow this up. We-uh-we can handle this like civilized adults." His eyes flick to me. "I'll cover it, Serena. Consider it compensation for everything."
My lips curl into a cold smile. "You mean hush money? Or do you prefer calling it a 'parting gift'? Doesn't matter to me as long as you settle up."
Evelyn bristles at my tone. "Don't act so high and mighty. You're only winning because you starve yourself or something."
My laugh is short, clipped. "Believe what you want, Evelyn. Hand over the payment and we can all move on."
Ian signals the SA, and in hushed voices, they work out the transaction. Nina lingers by Evelyn's side, throwing me baleful looks. But she stays oddly quiet. Probably knows she can't do anything now.
Finally, the SA returns, nodding politely. "Everything's settled, Ms. Sinclair. The gown is yours. Also, Mr. Whitmore has kindly offered to pay for the children's outfits as well."
I flash a mocking smile at Ian. "How generous of you."
He doesn't respond, just looks embarrassed. Evelyn seethes in silence, arms crossed. She hates losing, especially in public. But there's no backing out now. She glares at me like she wants to claw my eyes out. I shrug, turning to Milo and Stella.
"Ready, kids?"
They nod eagerly. I step back into the fitting room, carefully changing out of the exquisite gown. Once I'm done, I exit, dress in one hand, my chin held high. Evelyn and Nina look like they want to spit fire, but they say nothing.
###chapter 24
Serena's POV
I hold onto Milo's and Stella's hands as we step out of the mall. I notice Ian Whitmore hurrying up behind us, his face flushed and a little out of breath. Then Ian steps right in our path, blocking us.
"Serena," he says, voice tense. "Can we talk?"
I let out a sharp exhale. "What's there to say, Ian? You already paid for the dress. Are you regretting the price tag now?"
He shakes his head, lips thinning. "I'm not broke, Serena. Don't insult me. You've been ignoring my messages for weeks. I thought we could still be friends despite everything." His gaze flickers toward Milo and Stella. "I didn't expect you to be playing nanny. Is he making you babysit his kids?"
My jaw clenches. "You're delusional. Since when do you think you can waltz in and give me life advice? You lost that privilege a long time ago."
Ian's eyes harden, frustration boiling beneath his calm facade. "You used to trust me," he mutters. Then he forces a crooked smile. "But hey, I see you got them fancy new outfits. You sure he isn't using you for your cash? I heard-"
"Stop." My voice is cold, a single word filled with anger. "Don't talk about he like you know him. You have no idea what he's capable of."
I turn to lead Milo and Stella away, but Ian catches my arm, grip tight enough to make my nerves spark with fury. Stella yelps, and Milo's eyes flare with protectiveness. My heart starts pounding, ready to lash out.
Suddenly, Milo and Stella jump between us, their small bodies shielding me. Stella tries to pry Ian's hand off my arm with all her might, and Milo-he bares his teeth and gives Ian a fierce little bite on the wrist.
"What the-!" Ian flinches back, cursing in pain. He snatches his hand away, staring at Milo in shock.
"Don't you dare touch her!" Milo says, his voice trembling with emotion.
Stella looks at Ian with her big, determined eyes. "We won't let you hurt Mommy! So back off!"
My chest tightens. I'm overwhelmed by how these two kids, still so small, are willing to fight for me. Despite everything, they stand tall like miniature warriors. Ian looks like he wants to spit more insults but he's clearly embarrassed to be attacked by a pair of six-year-olds in a public mall corridor.
A few people slow down, watching curiously. Ian glares at me, voice low and angry. "You'll regret this. One day you're gonna need me again, and I won't be there."
I manage a cool laugh. "I'd rather starve than beg you for help."
With that, I spin around, shoulders stiff, and gently usher Milo and Stella toward the exit. Ian shouts after us.
By the time we reach my car, the twins are still breathing fast from the confrontation. I check Milo's mouth-thank goodness-and give Stella a once-over to ensure Ian didn't bruise her. Both are fine, just rattled.
"You guys okay?" I ask softly, kneeling to their level.
Milo glances away, cheeks turning pink. "I'm sorry I bit him, Mommy. I just-he was grabbing you."
Stella nods fervently. "Yeah, we had to do something."
I pull them in for a quick hug, my voice coming out gentle. "I really appreciate you both looking out for me."
When we finally get back to my apartment, the sun is sinking low, painting the skyline with a dusky orange glow. I text Lucas, letting him know about we're home. He responds with a short message, telling me he's stuck at the office but wants me to keep Milo and Stella overnight.
I sigh, both relieved and irritated. "Looks like you're stuck with me tonight," I tell the twins, trying to sound upbeat.
"Yay!" Stella squeals, jumping a little. "We can watch TV and eat dinner together!"
Milo nods. "I'm hungry!"
I grin, feeling my exhaustion fade. "All right, let's order something good. You guys like pizza or do you want something fancy?"
They share a conspiratorial glance. "Pizza," they say in unison.
"Pizza it is," I laugh.
Within minutes, I've placed an order for a big, cheesy pie. The three of us spread out in my living room, rummaging through my streaming apps. Milo stares at the big screen in fascination, while Stella flips channels, from reality cooking shows to science documentaries.
"Oh! Look, that's Eleanor Yates," Stella exclaims when she lands on a flashy entertainment special. "She's so pretty!"
Milo nods in agreement. "Yeah, Dad likes her-he says she's a rising star."
The second I hear "Dad likes her," my stomach twists. The light, happy mood I had a moment ago vanishes. It's like someone poured ice water down my spine. Lucas doesn't usually talk about celebrities, so I never thought I'd have to worry about him crushing on someone else. But now, hearing about Eleanor Yates-kind, charitable, and apparently gorgeous-makes my heart sink. My chest feels tight, and this sudden wave of disappointment hits me, turning my thoughts dark.
"I guess your dad's got taste," I say, forcing a light tone. But inside, my mind spins. Is she prettier than me? More charming? More everything? I stare at her on the screen, trying to figure out what Lucas sees in her. My heart pounds with a weird mix of jealousy and insecurity, like I'm not good enough. I swallow hard, pasting on a half-smile, but I can't shake the uneasy feeling gnawing at me.
The pizza arrives, and we eat on the living room floor, the twins giggling through mouthfuls of cheese and sauce. I should probably scold them for talking with their mouths full, but the moment feels too relaxed and warm. Once we're done, Milo and Stella eagerly help me carry boxes to the trash.
Afterward, we settle back down in front of the TV, channel surfing aimlessly. My phone buzzes again-Lucas checking in. He won't be back till late, maybe past midnight. I type out a short reply, telling him we're fine, though my heart tightens a little.
Tonight is about Milo and Stella, so I shove those thoughts aside and focus on them.
Time slips by, and soon Stella is yawning, leaning her head on Milo's shoulder. He's blinking tiredly, too.
"C'mon," I say, getting to my feet. "Bath time. Then maybe we'll read a story or watch one last cartoon."
They both look hesitant, cheeks flushing. "We can bathe ourselves," Milo mumbles.
"Oh, I know," I say lightly. "I'm just here in case you need help with shampoo. I do a mean scalp massage."
Stella giggles, and they follow me to the bathroom. The condo has a spacious tub, and while I set out fluffy towels, they shyly slip into the warm water.
"Everyone grows up eventually, right?" Stella asks after a moment, eyes curious. Water droplets cling to her lashes. "Dad says we'll be adults before we know it."
"Yeah," Milo chimes in. "It feels so far away though."
I smile, carefully rinsing shampoo out of Stella's hair. "Trust me, time flies when you're not paying attention. One day you'll wake up, and poof- you'll be grown."
Milo's voice is small. "Then... you and Dad?"
He doesn't finish, but I know what he's really asking. Will I still be around when they're older? Will Lucas still want me in his life?
My chest aches at the thought, but I keep my tone light. "Well, I'm not going anywhere for now. Let's just focus on the present, okay?"
###chapter 25
Serena's POV
By the time I finish helping Milo and Stella out of the tub, both of them are yawning so hard their little shoulders tremble. I grab a couple of my oversized white T-shirts from the closet and hand them over.
"Put these on," I say gently. "They'll be like nightgowns on you guys."
They hold up the shirts against their bodies, giggling at how baggy they look. Stella's reaches right to her knees, and Milo keeps tugging at the hem, trying to see how much of him it covers. Even though they're laughing, I notice just how sleepy they both are. Their eyes droop, still glowing with that childlike sparkle, but exhaustion is winning.
Once they're clothed, I scoop them up-one in each arm. They're heavier than they look, but I manage to carry them to my bed. I sit them down on the edge of the mattress and grab a hairdryer from the nightstand. The steady hum of hot air fills the room.
Milo rubs his eyes, fighting sleep. Stella mumbles something about a cartoon, but before I can reply, her head lolls forward. I take turns carefully running my fingers through their damp hair, aiming the warm breeze at them until their locks are dry enough not to make them shiver.
My chest tightens at the sight of them slumped against each other, half-asleep. There's so much trust in their little faces. They fought for me earlier, defending me from Ian with all their might, and now they look like angels. I kill the hairdryer and gently tuck both of them under the covers.
I lean over and kiss Milo on the forehead, then Stella. "Sweet dreams," I whisper, my voice trembling with an emotion I can't quite name. Love, maybe. Relief.
I tiptoe out of the room and pull the door halfway shut. My phone buzzes, and I remember I'd texted Lucas, asking if he could pick up the twins tomorrow morning. But there's no reply. I sigh and set the phone on the kitchen counter, mentally preparing myself for a quiet night with two sleeping kids in my bed.
Suddenly, the doorbell rings. I freeze. Through the peephole, I see none other than Lucas. The moment I spot him, my heart does this stupid flip. Even though he's just standing there in the dim hallway, he's so... overpoweringly handsome. He wears a dark suit that highlights his sculpted frame.
In a panic, I glance down at myself-my robe is loose, barely tied. My hair is still damp. My cheeks burn. I scramble away, rush into my bedroom, and yank on a conservative pair of sweatpants and a plain T-shirt, hastily tying my damp hair into a messy bun. I toss the robe aside, inhale, then head back to the door.
I open it, trying to look composed. "You're here late."
Lucas steps inside, shutting the door softly. His eyes roam over me, lingering just enough to make my pulse spike. "I got your text," he says, his voice deep, "and I finished work earlier than expected."
I shift awkwardly. "Milo and Stella are already asleep. You could've just come in the morning."
He shrugs, gaze flicking toward the bedroom. "I was hungry. And I wanted to see them."
I raise an eyebrow. "Hungry?"
He smirks, a small curve of his lips that makes my stomach twist. "Yeah. I haven't eaten all day."
There's an awkward pause. I was about to suggest ordering takeout again, but he cuts me off with a look that says he's not in the mood. "I can cook something," I offer. "How about some instant spaghetti with cream mushroom sauce?"
He nods without hesitation. "That'll do."
I hurry into the kitchen, rummaging for a pot and dried pasta. I can sense Lucas's presence behind me, his gaze taking in every detail of my apartment. I feel self-conscious in my casual clothes, but I try to focus on the simplest meal I can manage.
Within ten minutes, I have a small plate of spaghetti ready. I hand him a fork, and he digs in quietly. There's something so intimate about cooking for him this late at night, both of us standing in my kitchen with only the stovetop light on.
Once he's finished, I brace myself. "Let me get the twins. You're taking them tonight, right?"
He shakes his head. "Didn't you tell me in that text you wanted them to stay over?"
A flicker of confusion crosses my face. "Well, yeah, but I assumed you'd at least respond."
Lucas just shrugs. "I read it. Decided to come here anyway. It seemed like the right thing to do."
I can't tell if he's being considerate or just messing with my head. The air feels charged, like we're both dancing around something we can't name.
"Uh, okay," I say quietly. "Bathroom's down the hall if you need it."
He passes by me, heading to my room first. My heart jumps-I realize I left some clothes on the floor, including my bra from earlier. I dart in behind him, panicked.
The soft lamplight reveals the twins asleep on the bed, pillows half off the mattress. And there, on the floor near the dresser, is my bra. Before I can grab it, Lucas kneels down and picks it up. He holds it out, not saying a word, but his eyes glimmer with a teasing edge.
My cheeks burn. "Thanks," I mumble, yanking it from his hand and stuffing it behind my back.
He doesn't laugh or smirk. Instead, there's a strange warmth in his gaze. "Go on," he says softly. "I'll just use the bathroom real quick."
I slip out, heart hammering. I toss the bra into my closet, slam the door, and take a moment to calm myself.
A few minutes later, I wander into the living room. Lucas emerges, still looking perfect even at this hour. He notices my damp hair and points to the blow dryer on the couch.
"You're gonna catch a cold," he murmurs. "Sit."
I swallow, not sure I should let him do this. But he switches on the hairdryer, and I end up obeying without argument. Warm air hits my neck, and he runs his fingers through my strands, careful not to tug. Each soft pass of his hand makes my pulse race. We stay like that for several minutes, neither of us speaking. My eyes slide shut, and I'm weirdly comforted by the steady sound of hot air and Lucas's deliberate touch.
When he finally stops, I open my eyes and realize my breathing is shallow. He sets the dryer aside and says quietly, "I'll come back around eight in the morning to pick up the kids. That okay?"
I nod, my voice faint. "Yeah. Sure."
We walk to the door together. He notices a pair of men's slippers-ones I'd bought for Ian a long time ago-tucked against the wall. He scoops them up and glances at me. I see something flicker across his face, maybe annoyance. Without asking, he tosses them into a nearby trash bin, like it's the most natural thing in the world.
I stand there, stunned. He's basically erasing traces of Ian from my apartment. 
As he steps outside, I can't hold back my question. "Lucas are you actually from that famous Harrington family in North City?"
###chapter 26
Serena's POV
Lucas's still got one hand on the doorknob, the other resting casually against his hip. In the warm light, his features are striking. The mere sight of him steals my breath.
He doesn't even blink. "Yeah," he says, voice calm and low. "I am."
My pulse jolts. I knew it all along, honestly. The way he carries himself, the wealth, the confidence, the single father situation-everything pointed to him being a Harrington. Still, hearing him confirm it makes my stomach twist.
Lucas cocks his head. "When did you figure it out?"
"Just now," I admit, folding my arms. "But it wasn't that hard. Your last name, your lifestyle, and you being a single dad. And, well" I pause, eyes drifting over his unfairly good looks. "You look a lot better than any of those tabloid photos. They never do you justice."
He arches a brow, lips curling. "That's the nicest thing I've heard today."
I shrug, trying to seem indifferent even though my heart is hammering. "Just stating the obvious," I say lightly. "Anyway, I'm not mad you didn't tell me. We're not exactly at the 'share all our secrets' stage."
Lucas nods. "I get it. But since someone kept calling me a cop"-his tone drips with sarcasm that's obviously aimed at Ian-"I was waiting for the right time to clear everything up. Didn't want you thinking I was lying."
I huff, rolling my eyes. "He's an idiot. He's always been blind and clueless."
Lucas chuckles, a deep, rumbling sound that makes my body heat up in ways I'm trying so hard to ignore. Then he glances at his watch. "It's getting late. I should go. Thanks for watching Milo and Stella."
I manage a small smile. "Sure. Take care."
He dips his head and steps out, leaving me in the silent hallway, mind racing with all kinds of questions. I shut the door, exhale, and head to my bedroom where Milo and Stella are curled up, sleeping soundly.
Sunlight filters through the blinds when I get up. Milo and Stella are still dozing, their tiny forms nestled under the blankets. I slip out quietly and shuffle to the kitchen, determined to make breakfast. I'm no gourmet chef, but toast, fried eggs, and milk can't be too hard.
Before long, the smell of butter and eggs fills the apartment. I might've left the eggs a bit too long on the pan, but it still looks edible enough. Just as I'm placing everything on the table, I hear little feet padding across the floor.
"Morning, Mommy." Stella yawns, rubbing her eyes. Behind her, Milo follows, hair sticking up in every direction.
"Morning, sleepyheads," I say gently. "Come sit. I've got breakfast ready."
They climb onto chairs, blinking like baby owls. Milo tentatively pokes at the fried egg. "Looks yummy," he says, flashing me a shy grin.
Stella nods, chewing on her toast. "It's good, Mommy," she murmurs through a mouthful of bread, and my heart feels warm and fuzzy. Even though the egg's edges are a bit burnt, they're eating it all with big smiles, and that simple acceptance makes me grin right back.
After breakfast, I'm wiping down the countertop when the doorbell rings. I open it to find Walter Williamson-Lucas's butler-standing there, as proper and polite as ever.
"Good morning, Ms. Sinclair," he says, tipping his head. "Mr. Harrington has an early meeting with clients, so he asked me to pick up Milo and Stella."
He gestures to a small suitcase at his side. "Also, Mr. Harrington sent over some of their clothes and personal items. And these." Walter lifts a pair of men's slippers, neatly wrapped in a plastic bag. "He mentioned you might need these for the next time he comes over, or if the children stay again."
I raise my brows. "He really thought of everything, huh?"
Walter inclines his head. "He's quite thorough, yes."
I can't deny the flutter in my chest. Lucas Harrington, that cocky, devastatingly handsome man, is also annoyingly attentive. I motion for Milo and Stella to grab their things. The kids run over, still wearing the oversized T-shirts I lent them for pajamas. Walter smiles kindly as he hands them change of clothes.
Once they're dressed, Milo and Stella cling to my hands. "Mommy, when will we see you again?" Milo asks, a hint of worry clouding his eyes.
Stella nods. "We don't want to say goodbye forever."
I crouch down, meeting their gazes. "We'll see each other soon. Trust me." I think of the big charity banquet-the Harrington family event-coming up on the 17th. "We'll see each other tomorrow if all goes as planned."
They beam at that, relief washing over their little faces. "Okay," they chorus, hugging me tight before following Walter out the door.
I'm barely in my office for five minutes when Vincent Chadwick-my assistant-walks in with an elegant, cream-colored envelope. He hands it over with a knowing smile. "Harrington family's grand event. You're officially invited."
I open the envelope and find a formal invitation, complete with Lucas's signature in a bold, confident script. There's a strange surge of warmth in my chest, but I push it down.
Just then, my office door bursts open. Nina Sinclair stomps inside, face twisted with anger. "Serena," she snaps, eyes flashing, "what the hell is this about a 'no show' note on my name in the company records? You're humiliating me!"
I straighten in my chair. "You missed work without notice," I say bluntly. "We follow standard procedure. You didn't show, we log it as absence."
She glares, hands trembling. "You disappear all the time-why isn't your name in the records?"
"Because I own this place," I answer, not bothering to soften my tone. "And last I checked, you don't. If it bothers you, you're free to walk."
Nina's jaw tightens, and for a split second, I see the fear flicker in her eyes. She might hate it, but she knows she can't just quit. Instead, she forces a smile that looks more like a grimace. "Fine. Have it your way. But you just wait. Something big's happening tomorrow-everyone's going to be talking about it. I doubt you'll even be allowed through the doors."
I snort. "We'll see about that."
She lets out a huff, turning on her heel to leave. Right before stepping out, she throws me a parting glare and slams the door.
The biggest day is coming. The most luxurious private club is ablaze with lights, drawing in fleets of sleek cars and limousines. Paparazzi line the entrance, cameras flashing, while guests in designer gowns and tailored suits glide down the red carpet. It's the epicenter of high society tonight, all for the Harrington family's charity banquet.
I step out of the car, my heart thumping. I can practically taste the anticipation in the air. 
I take a moment to smooth my dress, inhaling the crisp air. I can't help but wonder what kind of look he'll give me when he sees me-his invitation in my clutch, my heart pounding faster than I'd like to admit.
###chapter 27
Serena's POV
I take one last calming breath as I step onto the red-carpeted entrance. Cameras are flashing everywhere, and the crowd is huge. My heart is pounding so loudly I swear everyone around me can hear it. The warm light gleams off my dress, which clings to me in all the right ways.
I square my shoulders and walk inside.
The interior of this private club is dazzling. Chandeliers sparkle overhead, and the music is soft yet elegant. It's the kind of place where everyone's out to impress. The men are in crisp tuxedos; the women in flashy gowns. Servers glide around with silver trays, offering champagne and hors d'oeuvres.
I'm about to head deeper into the crowd when I catch a glimpse of a group of familiar faces off to the side. Sure enough, Nina Sinclair and Evelyn Whitmore are huddled together, tossing me looks like I'm some unwelcome intruder. Right beside them is Ian Whitmore, scanning the room like he owns it. My blood simmers, but I force myself to keep my expression calm. This isn't the first time they've tried to make me feel like I don't belong.
I'm making my way through the crowd when I catch Ian's voice. He's standing with a bunch of flashy, loud guys, and I can't resist slowing down just enough to eavesdrop.
"Ian, I heard you've met Lucas!" one guy says, sounding excited.
"Yeah, I have," Ian answers with a casual shrug."He used to always nod and smile when he saw me."
"Damn, you're lucky," another chimes in. "Last time I tried to see him, his people turned me away at the door."
"Same here," a third dude adds. "I don't even know what the guy looks like in person."
Then someone else pipes up, "None of us can compare to Ian, right? He single-handedly saved Whitmore Group from going under. He's a big shot now. If my family collapsed, I'd have no backup plan."
Everyone laughs, patting Ian on the shoulder like he's some hero. The conversation might sound like a joke, but it's clear they're pumping him full of praise.
One of them leans forward, eyes gleaming. "Dude, once Lucas shows up, you gotta introduce us. My old man won't stop nagging me to get close to him. Says we're all young and I should learn from him."
"Yeah," another agrees. "We're friends, aren't we? You won't leave us hanging, right?"
Ian hesitates a second-I see the uncertainty flicker in his eyes-but then he nods. "Sure," he says, forcing a smile. "If he has time, I'll do what I can."
"Awesome," they all cheer, talking over each other in excitement. "It's settled, man."
I take a step forward, and suddenly, Ian from that circle blurts out. He stalks over, dropping his voice low so only I can hear. "What are you doing here, Serena?" His tone is hostile, laced with suspicion. "Who brought you in? Because I know StarRiver Group didn't get an invitation. And the Sinclair Family sure as hell didn't bring you."
I fold my arms across my chest, refusing to give him an inch. "This is Harrington International Holdings' event," I say coolly. "You're not the boss here, so why do you care who comes and goes?"
His eyes narrow. "If you're crashing the party, that's gonna look bad on you-"
"Then let it look bad," I cut him off. "It has nothing to do with you."
He huffs, trying to sound magnanimous. "I can tell everyone you're my plus-one. Spare you the embarrassment of getting kicked out."
I glare at him. "We're over. Don't touch me."
The moment I turn away, I can practically feel him seething behind me, but I keep on moving. My steps lead me toward a quieter corner. I grab a champagne flute, hoping I can at least enjoy a drink before someone else tries to grill me.
I'm still sipping when I sense eyes on me again-Nina Sinclair and Evelyn Whitmore. They're whispering, occasionally casting smug glances my way. I can only guess they're stirring up rumors, probably bragging about how Ian's got connections to "Lucas Harrington" and can revive the Whitmore Family. Nina's taking obvious pleasure in thinking I'm a nobody here.
Just as I'm about to roll my eyes and walk off, a staff member in a neat uniform steps up, politely but firmly. "Excuse me, Ms. Serena Sinclair? We've received reports that someone without a valid invitation entered the premises. Could you please show us your credentials?"
###chapter 28
Serena's POV
My stomach knots for a split second. Of course they'd pull a stunt like this. I notice Nina and Evelyn in the distance, smirking. Even from here, I can tell they're thrilled to see me cornered.
The staffer tries to be polite, but I see the judgment flicker in his eyes when people start whispering around us.
"Isn't she some gold-digger, sneaking into events?"
"Word is she's shamelessly crashing. I heard she was kicked out of the Sinclair Family years ago."
My chest tightens, memories of all the past humiliations boiling up. I clench the stem of the champagne glass, hold my head high, and face the staffer calmly.
"Of course," I reply, carefully controlling my voice. "I can show you proof."
The crowd is gathering, waiting for me to crumble. From the corner of my eye, I see Ian crossing his arms, a smug grin creeping onto his face. Nina and Evelyn hover close, practically salivating at the idea of me getting tossed out.
Suddenly, someone speaks up behind me.
"Hey, aren't you Ian's fiancée? Or ex-fiancée or something?"
I spin around and lock eyes with a guy who looks vaguely familiar-he's one of those guys who was chatting with Ian earlier. He scans me from head to toe, confusion written all over his face.
He mutters under his breath, "If she's with Ian, why's she standing here alone?" Then, out loud, he says, "Hey, I'll go get Ian. He's right over there."
I can't help a sarcastic smirk. These idiots think I only got in because of Ian. They believe he's my golden ticket to these fancy circles.
And, of course, I hear the whispering ripple through the crowd.
"Didn't she nearly ruin Ian's life back then?"
"Yeah, that accident, or whatever it was-she's the reason everything went south, right?"
"She's got a nerve showing up here."
I clench my jaw, forcing myself not to snap back. 
The staffer remains by my side, smiling at me as though the moment I fail to produce my invitation, he'll switch faces and throw me out in the most humiliating way possible.
Before I can even reach into my clutch, that same guy reappears-this time dragging Ian Whitmore by the sleeve. Ian's brows lift in fake surprise when he sees me.
"Oh, Serena," he says, loud enough for the entire crowd to hear. "I thought you weren't feeling well tonight, so you said you'd skip this event."
His tone is pure performance. He's clearly trying to distance himself, making sure everyone knows I'm not with him. I swallow the anger that's bubbling up in my chest and meet his gaze with cold disinterest.
"How sweet of you to check on me. But I never said I wasn't coming."
That's all I manage to say before the staffer cuts in.
"Mr. Whitmore, is she with you?" he asks. "We've had some inquiries about Ms. Sinclair's invitation."
Ian hesitates for a split second. Then, in a syrupy voice, he pretends not to know my status here.
"Well, I didn't bring her as a plus-one," he announces to everyone within earshot. "So she might be here... on her own?"
All around me, people murmur and snicker. One guy outright laughs, a high-pitched sneer that sets my teeth on edge.
"Seriously? She just snuck in here?"
"Wow, talk about desperate!"
"I knew she was shameless, but this is next-level."
My blood roars, but I keep my composure. The staffer clears his throat again, like he's giving me one more chance before he calls in security. I gently set my glass on a nearby tray, open my clutch, and pull out a gold-edged invitation.
"Actually," I say, letting my voice carry, "I have my own invitation. Could you please verify it?"
The hush that falls over the crowd is almost deafening. Everyone leans in, jaws nearly dropping to the floor. The staffer inspects the gold card, comparing it with his guest list. As soon as he confirms it, his entire demeanor does a 180. He bows slightly and says,
"My apologies, Ms. Serena Sinclair. There appears to have been a misunderstanding. Welcome, and enjoy your evening."
A chorus of uncomfortable mutterings washes through the crowd. Ian goes stiff, and his eyes flick to Nina and Evelyn, who look like they've swallowed sour lemons. The black invitations in their hands suddenly look cheap compared to my gleaming gold one.
I let my gaze land on them for a second longer, savoring their shock. Then I turn back to the staffer.
"No worries," I reply with an icy calm. "I'm sure it's an easy mistake to make."
I walk past Nina and Evelyn, catching their furious expressions. Nina's lips are pressed so tight they're almost white. Evelyn clenches her phone like she wants to crush it. I pause by them just long enough to toss a small, mocking smile their way.
"Hope you're both having fun," I say softly, then continue on.
Behind me, I hear Ian trying to salvage the situation by throwing Evelyn under the bus. He's muttering something about how she must have messed up or tried to cause trouble. Nina tries to chime in, but Ian warns her to keep her distance if she doesn't want to get dragged down, too.
The ripple of movement at the entrance caught everyone's attention. Conversation died mid-sentence as new arrivals commanded the room's focus. The shift in atmosphere was instant-from the casual buzz of Manhattan's elite to a silence heavy with anticipation.
"Is that Lucas?" The whispers rustled through the crowd. In Manhattan's upper circles, the mere mention of Harrington International Holdings stirred envy and awe. The name carried weight that even money couldn't buy - true old-world power.
I watched from my position near the corner as Ian Whitmore made his move. He strode forward with the confidence of someone who thought they held all the cards, extending his hand to Miles with a practiced smile. "Mr. Harrington, what an honor to see you again." The way he preened, you'd think he was the guest of honor himself.
Miles furrowed his brow in confusion at Ian's enthusiastic greeting, mechanically returning the handshake before hurrying to catch up with the group moving ahead. 
Ian remained rooted to the spot, savoring what he believed had been a meaningful exchange with "Lucas," a self-satisfied smile playing across his features. 
I watched him with a mixture of pity and contempt. His complete inability to read social cues or pick up on the obvious dismissal was almost painful to witness. Such utter obliviousness, I thought, shaking my head slightly. The man's foolishness knew no bounds, and I couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness at how pathetically unaware he was of his own desperate behavior.

The party gradually resumed its rhythm, though now with an undercurrent of excitement. Ian had positioned himself at the center of a small crowd, basking in their attention as he regaled them with tales of his supposed close connection to the Harrington family. "Of course, Lucas and I often discuss business over dinner," he was saying, conveniently glossing over which 'Lucas' he meant.

"A police officer rubbing shoulders with Lucas Harrington?" His voice dripped with condescension. "Now that's something you don't see every day." He paused, clearly expecting me to either defend myself or show appropriate appreciation for his attention.
###chapter 29
Serena's POV
I turn, and there he is-Lucas, standing off to the side, tall and intimidating, his dark hair slightly tousled in a way that makes me want to stare forever. A perfectly tailored suit molds against every line of his strong body, emphasizing lean muscle that nearly crackles with energy. The moment he steps closer, I feel his presence like a current in the air.
He addresses me in a tone so soft only I can hear. "Milo and Stella will arrive soon with my grandfather," he says, glancing toward the far side of the ballroom. "I want you to wait for them."
His voice is low, rich, and it rolls through me like slow thunder. I nod, my throat tight. "Got it."
Lucas holds my gaze for a split second longer-long enough to send heat fluttering through my chest-then he moves away. Ian and his circle stare at Lucas's retreating figure, trying to piece everything together.
A clueless buddy of Ian's leans in. "Hey, man, who is that? Another security guy? Didn't you say he used to be a cop?"
Ian shrugs like it's no big deal. "Yeah, probably just a glorified bodyguard. Being handsome won't get you too far in this crowd."
I hold back a laugh. If only they knew the truth about Lucas. Their ignorance is downright pathetic.
Suddenly, the atmosphere in the room shifts again. The chatter dies down, and heads swivel toward the main entrance where an older man is being wheeled in-a regal figure in a luxurious suit, his hair silvery and neat. The hush is instant. Howard Harrington, the patriarch. He's escorted by staff and surrounded by top-tier guests, all jockeying to give their most gracious greetings. It's like a swarm of bees around honey.
I see Milo and Stella trailing behind, tiny and wide-eyed in the crush of people. They look like they're trying to keep up with the grand procession but seem overwhelmed by the sheer number of strangers crowding close. My heart tightens. I can't leave them in that chaos.
I push forward through the throng just as Howard begins to exchange pleasantries with some VIPs. Nina Sinclair is among them-her lips parted in a simpering smile, hoping to gain the old man's favor. The second she spots me, her expression hardens. Before she can make a snide remark, I slip around her and head for Milo and Stella.
Ian tries to block me again, seizing my wrist. "What the hell do you think you're doing?" he growls under his breath. "You don't just walk up to Howard Harrington like you own the place. Let the real players handle this."
I yank free, my voice ice-cold. "Get out of my way."
He scoffs. "You're just embarrassing yourself."
Ignoring him, I cut through the crowd. Milo and Stella spot me, and relief floods their faces. A couple of bodyguards follow close behind them, but they hang back, letting me take over.
"Mommy!" Milo tugs my hand. "It's so loud here."
Stella clings to my side. "Can we get some dessert now? Great-Grandpa's surrounded. We're stuck."
I grin, bending down to brush Stella's hair behind her ear. "Of course we can."
I lead them toward the dessert table in a quieter corner of the hall, feeling a thousand eyes on us. Nina Sinclair soon reappears, stepping into our path with a bright, toothy smile that's dripping with venom.
"Aww, Serena, I didn't realize you were in charge of babysitting," she says, her tone full of mock sweetness. "Such a convenient role, don't you think?"
My spine stiffens. "Don't start, Nina. I have no patience for your games."
She arches a brow. "I'm just making conversation. But don't you think you're overstepping boundaries, parading those kids around at a formal event? People will talk, you know."
I stand my ground. "If you're so worried about people talking, maybe go mind your own business."
For a split second, Nina looks like she might lash out, but then she notices how close Stella is, blinking up at her in confusion. With a disdainful sniff, Nina steps back and storms off, clearly not ready to spark a scene with a child in the crossfire.
I turn my attention back to Milo and Stella, guiding them to the gleaming array of cakes and sweets. Their eyes light up instantly, and they start picking out slices of chocolate cake and fruit tarts. I help them fill small plates, relieved to see them relax.
Off to my left, Evelyn Whitmore stands near Jace Gillard, the famous director under the Harrington umbrella. Evelyn's body language is all fake charm-she's leaning in, fluttering her eyelashes. I catch snippets of their conversation over the general buzz.
"I want to know why I was suddenly replaced," she asked discreetly.
"That was a decision from higher up at the company," Jace replied, sounding uninterested.
She pressed on. "Aren't you one of the shareholders in Vanguard Media?"
Jace shook his head. "This came straight from Harrington. I don't have the final say."
"Harrington?" Her face darkened. "Was Drew Yeager involved in this? He's denied it to my face before."
Jace sighed. "Why don't you ask him yourself?" He pointed toward the entrance, where Drew Yeager and Spencer Sherwood had just arrived.
Hearing this response, she wasn't satisfied and fell silent for a moment. Then, in a flattering and seductive tone, "...and if you ever need someone with my experience, I'd be thrilled to collaborate," she says, voice syrupy. "Oh, by the way, here's my personal number. Feel free to call me anytime. Even late at night."
I roll my eyes. Typical Evelyn, trying to cling to anything that might elevate her status. She holds out a little slip of paper, no doubt scrawled with her contact info. But Jace's eyes flick to it with mild annoyance.
"Thanks," he mutters curtly, "but I've got all the talent I need right now. You'll have to contact my assistant if you want an audition."
Evelyn's smile wavers, clearly not expecting such a direct brush-off. She tries to protest, but Jace politely shakes his head and walks away, leaving her standing there with that piece of paper in her hand. She looks ready to explode from embarrassment.
To make matters worse, Eleanor Yates-a well-known socialite who's rumored to have her own ambitions in the entertainment world-steps by at that exact moment. She eyes Evelyn's predicament, lets out a soft, mocking snicker, and keeps strolling. Evelyn's cheeks flare red, and she quickly pockets the note.
"Mommy?" Milo nudges me, his mouth already smudged with chocolate frosting. "Do we have to go back soon?"
Stella tilts her head. "Yeah, it's too crowded by Grandpa."
I place a hand on Stella's shoulder, smiling gently. "You two can stay with me a little while longer, okay? We'll take a break."
###chapter 30
Serena's POV
Evelyn's still reeling from the way Eleanor Yates just laughed in her face, and the storm brewing in her eyes is impossible to miss. Beside me, Milo and Stella fidget with their plates, nibbling on leftover cake crumbs.
Suddenly, the lights dim except for a bright spotlight in the center of the stage, and the chatter dies down. A host steps forward, microphone in hand, announcing that the Harringtons are about to make a formal statement. People around us instinctively gather in front of the raised platform. There's a ripple of excitement-nobody wants to miss whatever the Harrington patriarch has to say.
A pair of bodyguards reappears at my side and politely gestures for Milo and Stella to return to their places with Howard. I catch both kids' eyes and give them a reassuring nod. They hesitate before letting the guards guide them back toward the stage area.
I settle into the crowd. Howard Harrington is rolled out in his wheelchair, looking regal and composed in his expensive suit. Standing just behind him is Lucas, the powerful, sinfully good-looking man I've been trying not to stare at all night. Even from across the room, I feel that overwhelming surge of energy he carries. He commands the room with an unmistakable presence, the kind that makes everyone else naturally fall in line. Just by standing there, he radiates the quiet authority of someone who knows exactly how much power they hold.
Milo and Stella stand to one side, eyes bright but a bit nervous in all the attention. They've clearly been taught how to act in front of a crowd like this, but they're still just kids. I see Lucas give them a small, reassuring smile, the kind that tugs at something deep in my chest. It's hard not to think he's even more attractive when he's being gentle with them.
I spot Evelyn and Nina off to one side, whispering to each other in a panic. Their faces have gone pale, and their eyes keep darting between Lucas, Howard, and the crowd of curious onlookers. Ian stands with them, jaw clenched tight, like he's trying not to show how rattled he is. But when Stella and Milo trail behind, the kids standing proudly on the stage next to Howard's wheelchair, I see all three of them gasp in unison-eyes widening, mouths hanging open like they can't believe what they're witnessing. It's obvious they never imagined Lucas would be the one at the center of it all, nor that the two children would be treated like precious royalty in front of everyone.
Howard's voice fills the hall through the speakers, strong despite his age. "Distinguished guests, esteemed colleagues, dear friends..." He pauses, letting his gaze sweep across the room. "First, I must thank you all for joining us this evening."
After a few moments of polite acknowledgments, his tone shifts, becoming warmer and more personal. "Tonight, I have an announcement that marks a new ###chapter for Harrington International Holdings." Another calculated pause. "I've had the privilege of watching my grand-son Lucas grow into a man of extraordinary capability and vision. And now, it's time for him to take the lead of our Manhattan operations."

He turns slightly in his wheelchair to look at Lucas with unmistakable pride. "Under his direction, I have every confidence that our presence in Manhattan will not only continue but flourish in ways we've yet to imagine."

The applause starts instantly, thunderous and genuine, bouncing off the crystal chandeliers and filling every corner of the massive hall.My eyes fix on Lucas as he steps forward to speak. His tone is calm, voice deep enough to send shivers down my spine. He thanks Howard, mentions future goals for the company, and somehow manages to sound humble yet unapologetically in control. Every word he says only amplifies the applause, until people are practically worshipping him. And why wouldn't they? He's the perfect blend of power and allure, the type of man who can crush you or captivate you without blinking.
The applause thunders through the hall, echoing off the crystal chandeliers overhead.

Lucas steps forward, and I can't tear my eyes away. His deep voice fills the room with a calm authority that sends chills down my spine.

"Thank you, grandfather," he begins, his words measured and precise. "Your trust means everything to me." He pauses, commanding complete attention without effort. "Harrington International has always stood for excellence and innovation. As we move forward, we'll not only maintain that legacy but build upon it."

The crowd hangs on his every word. Even the usually chatty socialites are silent.

"Manhattan has been our home for generations," he continues, "and under my leadership, we'll deepen our roots here while reaching for new horizons."

The applause swells again, even louder than before. I watch as people lean forward, completely entranced. And how could they not be? He stands there radiating power and magnetism, the kind of man who could either destroy you or bewitch you with just a look. The scariest part? I'm pretty sure he knows it too.
From across the crowd, I spot Ian Whitmore. His face has gone ashen. It finally clicks for him that Lucas, the man he dismissed as a "glorified bodyguard," is actually the heir to one of the most formidable empires around. 
The realization hits him like a sucker punch. His circle of friends looks equally stunned, stumbling over themselves, unsure how to act now that their ringleader just got turned into a total fool.
Lucas finishes speaking, and as the applause winds down, he surprises everyone by striding right toward Ian. Every person in the vicinity freezes, waiting to see what's about to happen. Ian tries to stand tall, but I see how his posture stiffens. The color drains from his cheeks, and he actually steps back a little.
"Lucas Harrington," Lucas says in a pleasant enough voice, offering a hand as though to greet Ian formally. "We haven't met officially, have we?"
Ian opens his mouth, probably to apologize or stammer some fake pleasantry, but his words stick. He lifts his hand, desperate to salvage some dignity, but before he can shake Lucas's hand, Lucas withdraws it with a half-smile.
"Forgive me," Lucas adds in a low, almost polite tone, "but next time, try not to mistake me for just anyone. I'd hate for there to be any confusion about who's who."
A ripple of laughter rolls through the crowd. It's not loud, but it's enough to confirm that everyone's in on Ian's humiliation. Ian stands there, arm still half-extended, face blazing red. I can practically see the rage and humiliation radiating off him. He's been slapped down in the most public, painful way possible.
I feel a spark of satisfaction. It's about time Ian got a taste of the embarrassment he's tried to dish out to me. While everyone else is caught in the spectacle, I drift off to the side, enjoying a front-row seat to his downfall. But of course, Ian notices me. He whirls around, spots the subtle smile curling my lips, and marches over, fury twisting his expression.
"You," he spits, voice low and shaking. "You knew, didn't you? You knew who he was this whole time, and you let me make a fool of myself?"
I arch a brow. "I'm not responsible for your assumptions."
He clenches his jaw, nostrils flaring. "You could've told me!"
###chapter 31
Serena's POV
I roll my eyes. "Why would I do that? Maybe if you didn't jump to conclusions and judge people by their looks, you wouldn't be in this mess."
Ian's face contorts with anger. He looks ready to lash out or say something truly vile, but the crowd behind him is still buzzing, and he must sense that starting a full-blown argument now would only drag him deeper. With a final glare, he storms off, probably going to lick his wounds in private.

I watch Ian storm off, shoulders tense and fists clenched. His humiliation is almost tangible, but he won't dare explode again in front of so many people. I stand there for a moment, exhaling slowly, letting the last echoes of anger slip away. The night already feels too charged, too full of unexpected twists.
Just when I'm debating whether I should slip out of this place before more drama erupts, a man wearing a perfectly tailored suit hurries over. He's got short, neatly combed hair and the kind of polished demeanor that screams "professional." I've seen him a couple of times hovering around Lucas.
"Excuse me, Ms. Sinclair?" he says, his voice polite but urgent. "I'm Miles. Mr. Harrington's assistant. He asked me to pass along a message-he'd prefer if you didn't leave just yet."
My heart does a little flip at the mention of Lucas's name. After everything that happened tonight, he can't be done with me just yet? I clear my throat. "Uh, why?"
Miles offers a tight smile. "He'd like to speak with you when he's finished handling a few matters. If you could wait for him... I'd really appreciate it."
For a split second, I'm tempted to brush him off and leave. I'm beyond tired of everyone's judgmental stares and the tension that's been building all night. But before I can decide, Miles steps back into the crowd and disappears as swiftly as he arrived.
I'm still mulling over my next move when I spot Milo and Stella weaving through the guests, coming straight at me. They look excited-and a little relieved-to find me standing here. Stella's eyes shine as she grabs my hand, while Milo's grin spreads across his face like he's up to something.
"Mommy!" Stella calls out, tugging on my sleeve. "You're not leaving, right?"
Milo nods, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "We still want you to take us to the garden. They have a huge swing set out there!"
Something in me softens. It's impossible to say no to these two. I sigh and force a small smile. "Okay, I'll stay for a little bit."
They both cheer like it's the best news they've heard all night. I let them lead me toward the double doors that open onto the grand estate gardens. The air outside smells of flowers and night dew, and just for a moment, I feel like I can finally breathe again.
But the moment we approach the marble staircase leading down into the gardens, a waiter carrying a tray of wine and champagne nearly crashes right into us. His eyes are wide, and he's stumbling like someone tripped him on purpose. Instinct jolts me-I yank Milo and Stella out of the way, but not fast enough to avoid the spray of red wine sloshing onto my dress. My body goes rigid, the wet cold seeping through the delicate fabric.
The waiter practically falls over himself apologizing. "I'm so sorry! I-I lost my footing-"
Behind him, I spot Nina Sinclair and Evelyn Whitmore standing to the side with smug little smirks. They're exchanging looks like they just pulled off some elaborate prank. My stomach twists. It doesn't take a genius to see who orchestrated this.
Evelyn steps forward, fake sympathy coating her words. "Oh, Serena, dear, you look like you've taken quite a spill. That's such an expensive dress too." She glances at my wine-stained gown, her lips curving into a nasty smile. "It's a pity it got ruined."
I grip Stella's hand a bit tighter, forcing myself to remain calm. I can feel anger simmering in my chest, but I do my best to hold it in check. "Accidents happen," I say with a shrug, though my voice trembles with barely contained rage. "Nothing a good dry cleaner can't handle."
"Oh, but that fabric's so delicate," Evelyn coos, still pretending to be oh-so concerned. "Are you sure you wouldn't rather just go home and change? I'm sure it's more comfortable than sticking around likethat."
Behind her sweet tone, I can hear the unspoken message loud and clear: Leave. You're not wanted here. I square my shoulders, refusing to budge. "I'll manage."
Evelyn scoffs, rolling her eyes. "Suit yourself." She flicks her hair over her shoulder as she spins around. The grand sweep of her gown trails behind her-until Milo's foot just "happens" to land squarely on the edge of the skirt. There's a loud rip, and Evelyn stumbles with a startled yelp.
The entire room seems to freeze. Evelyn whips around, her face twisted in shock. Part of her gown is torn, exposing the pricey underlayer beneath. The look on her face is priceless: absolute horror. There's a scattered gasp from nearby onlookers.
Milo blinks innocently, looking up at her with big eyes. "Oh no, I'm sorry," he says, voice trembling with a mocking sweetness that makes me want to laugh out loud. "You won't be mad at a kid, right?"
Evelyn's mouth opens and closes, but no sound comes out. She is livid, practically shaking with humiliation. Within seconds, Daniel and Grace Whitmore rush over to drape a jacket around Evelyn's shoulders, trying to salvage her dignity. Her voice cracks in hysterical rage. "I-I need to leave," she hisses.
They hustle her away, ignoring everyone's gawking. And the entire time, Milo watches them go with a triumphant smirk, one that matches the defiant gleam in Stella's eyes.
I'm about to respond when a magnetic, deep voice cuts through the air. "What's going on here?"
I glance up to see Lucas striding toward us, his tall frame moving with a quiet power that sends goosebumps down my arms. Before I can say anything, he's at my side, sliding his hand under my elbow and guiding me away from prying eyes. His dark suit fits his muscular frame perfectly, and this close, his presence is overwhelming. 
He glances at my soaked dress, his handsome face tightening with concern. "Are you okay?" he asks in a deep, low voice that makes my heart skip. Without waiting for my answer, he shrugs off his own jacket and drapes it over my shoulders. The warmth of the fabric and the faint scent of his cologne wrap around me like a protective cocoon.
I swallow, wondering how many shocked eyes are locked on us right now. "I'm fine," I manage, even though my chest is still pounding with anger and adrenaline. "It's just some spilled wine."
Milo pipes up, voice loud and clear, "Daddy, Evelyn tripped that waiter on purpose. We saw her stick out her foot."
Stella nods eagerly. "She wanted to ruin Serena's dress."
Lucas's gaze hardens, his jaw setting in a grim line. "I appreciate you two telling me," he says quietly to them. Then he turns to me, voice gentler. "I'll handle this."
###chapter 32
Serena's POV

Evelyn Whitmore stood frozen, visibly shaken by Lucas's commanding presence. Her momentary hesitation vanished as quickly as it came, replaced by a venomous determination that twisted her delicate features.

"Mr. Harrington!" she shouted, her voice echoing through the grand hall. "Do you have any idea what kind of woman Serena Sinclair really is? You've just returned to New York, so you probably don't know how promiscuous and loose she is! She was sleeping around at eighteen and even got pregnant with a bastard child! She hasn't even broken up with my brother yet, and here she is, shamelessly throwing herself at you. Don't fall for her tricks!"

Her words hit me like physical blows. Shock gave way to anger and humiliation that burned through my chest. Why was she doing this? Why here, in front of everyone?

Around us, the elegant party atmosphere shattered. Guests turned to stare, their whispered conversations growing louder by the second. I could hear snippets of their speculation, each word more cutting than the last.

"So that's Serena Sinclair? She works fast, already sinking her claws into Lucas Harrington."

"Did you hear about her dress? Worth a million, I heard. She really went all out to seduce Lucas Harrington."

"Earlier, I heard Milo Harrington call her 'Mommy.' Don't tell me she's already gotten to him first?"

"Serena Sinclair certainly knows what she's doing..."

Evelyn's lips curled into a triumphant smile as the whispers grew. I could read her thoughts in that smirk: she wanted to humiliate me, to make Lucas see who I really was. She truly believed he couldn't accept someone like me after this revelation. The determination in her eyes screamed that she would never allow me to get close to Lucas Harrington.

Lucas's voice cut through the murmurs like ice. "Serena Sinclair was trapped and forced into pregnancy at eighteen. That was her misfortune, not her shame. Her past hardships deserve sympathy and understanding, not malicious slander and mockery!"

"Don't let her fool you! She's nothing but a-" Evelyn started to argue, but Lucas's voice grew even colder.

"From this day forward, anyone who speaks ill of Serena Sinclair is my enemy. And I show no mercy to my enemies."

Daniel Whitmore's face had drained of all color. He rushed forward, practically tripping over himself in his haste. "It's all my fault for failing to teach my daughter proper manners. We've offended Mr. Harrington greatly. We'll leave immediately. Please, sir, don't hold a grudge against us for this small slight. We're leaving right now!"

He roughly grabbed Evelyn's arm, preparing to drag her from the hall. Something in my chest loosened as I watched them turn to go, though the turmoil in my heart refused to settle.

"Wait." Lucas's commanding voice stopped them in their tracks. "My son mentioned earlier that she ruined Serena's dress."

"I'll pay for it! How much?" Daniel quickly offered. "I'll compensate Serena fully."

"Dad!" Evelyn protested, her voice shrill. "That dress was bought by Ian in the first place!"

"Shut your mouth!" Daniel roared at her, making me flinch at the raw fury in his voice.

Lucas regarded them coolly. "Shouldn't one apologize first when they've done something wrong?"

"Apologize to Serena! Now!" Daniel ordered his daughter, his voice brooking no argument.

Evelyn's chin lifted defiantly. "I won't-"

"Evelyn Whitmore!" Her father's threat hung heavy in the air. "Are you refusing to listen to me?"

Under her father's menacing glare, Evelyn's pride finally crumbled. Tears streamed down her face as she lowered her head. "I'm sorry," she choked out.

"It's fine," I managed to say, keeping my voice steady despite the lingering humiliation. Her tearful apology offered a small measure of consolation, though the sting of her words remained.

"Mr. Harrington, may I take my daughter home now?" Daniel asked anxiously.

"Let this be the last time something like this happens," Lucas warned, his tone leaving no room for argument.

"Yes, yes, of course. I'll make sure to teach her better," Daniel promised frantically. Still seething, he roughly pulled Evelyn along as they made their undignified exit from the hall.

The silence they left in their wake felt deafening.
The last guest left, and the place slowly emptied. People were still whispering and casting sideways glances at Lucas and me. I could feel their eyes burning into us, full of doubt and curiosity. "Two people who couldn't be more different, how could they possibly be involved?" That's what everyone was thinking, or at least that's how it felt. 
My heart raced with confusion and unease. I tried to stay calm, forcing a neutral expression, but inside, I was a whirlwind of emotions.
Lucas stepped closer, his presence commanding the room's attention even as it thinned. "I've got some things to handle tonight," he said softly, his deep voice steady. "Wait for me, and I'll drive you home later."
I hesitated, shaking my head. "No, I can manage on my own"
"Listen to me," Lucas insisted, his eyes locking onto mine with a firmness that left no room for refusal. His strong jawline and piercing gaze made it impossible to argue with him. There was something undeniably attractive about him, something that went beyond just his looks. I felt a flutter in my chest, a mix of gratitude and something else I couldn't quite place.
"I appreciate it, really," I said, my voice wavering slightly. "But I don't want to be a burden."
Lucas reached out, his hand gently touching my arm. "You're not a burden. Let me help."
"Take care of yourself, okay?" Lucas said, his tone softening as he looked around.
"Yeah, you too," I replied, managing a small smile.
As Lucas turned to leave, he glanced back at his children. "Take care of mom," he instructed firmly.
"Of course, Dad," Milo and Stella responded in unison, their innocent voices cutting through the tension. Watching Lucas interact with his kids was heartwarming. He had this way of making everyone feel valued and loved.
Feeling a mix of warmth and confusion, I took Milo and Stella's hands tightly and led them out of the garden. My mind was racing-humiliated by the whispers, yet oddly comforted by Lucas's support. 
As we left, I saw Nina Sinclair standing a short distance away, her eyes cold and unforgiving. She watched me walk away with a smirk that sent chills down my spine. There was something malicious in her gaze, something that screamed revenge. Seeing Lucas here, looking like a king, only fueled her jealousy and hatred. 
Night had fallen completely by the time Milo and Stella were safely with Walter. The children needed their rest. Alone again in the now quiet room, I sank into a chair in the corner. 
Just as I was lost in my thoughts, I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up to see Jace Gillard standing nearby, a playful smile on his face. "Serena, you've got some impressive drinking skills," he teased, leaning casually against the wall.




I managed a laugh, feeling a bit more at ease. "Thanks, Jace. It's been a long night."
###chapter 33
Serena's POV

I managed a laugh, feeling a bit more at ease. "Thanks, Jace. Long time no see, It's been a long night."
My heart pounded. It had been months since our last meeting, and I wasn't sure how he'd react. Jace took a sip of his drink, his eyes meeting mine with a hint of concern. "Serena, your stomach isn't well. Maybe have a little less to drink."
I forced a smile, trying to play it cool.
Jace and I stood apart from the crowd, our conversation stilted and brief. It felt strange, like we were two ships passing in the night.
"So," Jace said, nodding towards Lucas who was chatting confidently with others, "he's nice."
I blinked, trying to figure out his meaning. "Oh, you mean Lucas."
Jace gave a small smile and gracefully set his glass down, glancing at his watch. "It's getting late. I should head out."
I returned his smile with a polite nod. "Take care."
He nodded back, a warm smile playing at his lips, before turning and walking away. Moments later, Drew Yeager and Spencer Sherwood also left, their eyes briefly meeting mine. I ignored their glances, focusing instead on the time. How much longer did Lucas have to finish his social obligations? I'm so tired I could fall asleep.

Just then, my eyes caught Lucas moving towards the back garden. My stomach churned with unease, but I decided not to follow. Maybe he needed some fresh air.
After a while, Eleanor Yates stormed into the banquet hall, clearly angry. A short time later, Lucas calmly walked back in. Something felt off to me, but I restrained the urge to confront him. Then Ian, holding his phone and sporting an evil grin, jogged over, passed by me, and even waved goodbye.
Lucas approached me, his presence commanding. I reached for my glass, ready to take another sip of red wine, but before I could, he grabbed it from my hand. Without a word, he downed the remaining half in one swift gulp.
"Sorry to keep you waiting," he said, his voice smooth and controlled.
I stood there, stunned, the taste of the wine lingering. "Mr. Harrington, have you finished?"
He smirked, stepping closer. "Let's go, I'll take you home."
I rose from my seat, feeling a wave of dizziness wash over me. As I did, Lucas's strong arms reached out to steady me. "Careful."
"Thanks," I murmured, pushing his hand away deliberately. I didn't want to be too close, not yet. I needed space, even though his presence was undeniably magnetic.
He pressed his lips together, eyes meeting mine before he finally let go. I took a step forward, determined to keep moving.
"Come on," he said softly, falling into step beside me.
We walked side by side, our shadows blending as we moved through the crowd. The room seemed to fade away, leaving just the two of us. People around us watched, whispers starting to circulate. 
"These two are totally made for each..." I heard people whispering around me.
Inside the car, the city lights blurred past the car window as I struggled to keep my eyes open. My head felt heavy, and the world seemed to spin slightly even with my eyes closed. I couldn't remember the last time I'd drunk this much - no, that wasn't true. I knew exactly when: the night after I walked away from Ian and the Whitmore Group.

"Just a few more minutes," Lucas's voice came from beside me, low and steady. I wanted to respond, but my tongue felt too heavy. Instead, I let my head rest against the cool window, trying to ground myself in the sensation.

The car's gentle motion must have lulled me to sleep, because the next thing I felt was strong arms lifting me. My eyes fluttered open to find Lucas's face inches from mine as he carried me. I should have protested - Serena Sinclair didn't need to be carried like some damsel in distress - but my body felt too disconnected to fight it.

"Your door code?" he asked as we reached my apartment.

"Birth-" I started to mumble, but I heard the keypad beep and the door clicked open. How did he...?

The apartment was dark except for the city lights filtering through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Lucas carried me straight to my bedroom, his steps sure despite the dim lighting. As he set me down on the bed, I caught a whiff of his cologne - subtle cedar mixed with something warmer.

"Let me help with these," he said softly, carefully removing my heels. His touch froze for a moment, and I knew he'd noticed the red marks where the straps had cut into my ankles. The bed shifted as he stood, and I heard water running in my bathroom before he returned with a warm washcloth.

"You don't have to..." I tried to protest as he began gently wiping my makeup away.

"I know," he replied simply, continuing his careful ministrations.

My eyes landed on the photo on my nightstand - me and my mother at my high school graduation, both of us smiling, unaware of what would happen just months later. The familiar ache in my chest intensified.

"How did you know?" I asked suddenly, my voice barely above a whisper. "That I was framed?"

Lucas's hand stilled for a moment. In the dim light, his expression was unreadable, but his voice was gentle when he spoke. "Because I saw the truth. I've always seen it."

Something cracked inside me then - maybe it was the alcohol, or his quiet certainty, or the weight of carrying my defenses for so long. "When I was eighteen," I heard myself saying, "my own father said he'd rather see me dead than bring shame to the Sinclair name. He believed them without question. Everyone did."

The first tear slipped down my cheek, and then another. "I'm sorry," Lucas murmured.

"Don't be," I managed. "It has nothing to do with you."

"It does." His voice was firm but gentle. "Because you deserved better. You deserved to be believed."

I looked up at him then, really looked at him. Even Ian, who'd claimed to love me, had always harbored that slight doubt. He'd said the past didn't matter, but his uncertainty had shown in a hundred tiny ways. But here was Lucas Harrington, who had no reason to care, looking at me with absolute conviction.

"You're the only one," I whispered, my voice breaking. "The only one who's ever truly been on my side."
###chapter 34
Lucas's POV 
The vulnerability in her voice shattered something inside me. "I came too late," I said softly, watching as another tear traced down her cheek.

"You came just in time," she whispered back, and the raw honesty in her eyes made my chest ache.

Before I could stop myself, my hand moved to her face, gently brushing away a tear that had escaped. The moment my fingers touched her skin, I felt her slight tremor. Our eyes met, and something shifted in the space between us - a current of understanding, of possibility.

My heart was racing as I leaned closer, drawn by an irresistible pull toward her. But just as I neared her lips, she turned her head slightly. My kiss landed softly on her cheek instead. The rejection, though gentle, felt like ice in my veins.

I immediately straightened, my body rigid with self-reproach. "I apologize for being forward." The words came out steady, masking the storm of emotions underneath.

As I started to rise, wrestling with disappointment and shame, her next words froze me in place.

"I have trouble with... physical closeness." Her voice was controlled, but I could hear the pain beneath the surface.

What followed shattered my world. She spoke of being drugged at eighteen, of unconsciousness and violation, of a father who chose disbelief over support. Each word was like a knife, twisting deeper into my chest. Rage and anguish warred within me - rage at those who had hurt her, anguish at her suffering.

Before I could respond, she bolted for the bathroom. The sound of her retching tore at me. I wanted to go to her, to shield her from these memories, but I forced myself to wait, giving her the space she needed.

When the sounds subsided, I approached carefully. She was pale, trembling. With infinite gentleness, I lifted her in my arms, feeling how light she was, how fragile she seemed in this moment.

"I'm tired," she murmured as I placed her on the bed.

"Get some rest. I won't take advantage." The words were a promise, both to her and to myself.

I watched as her breathing evened out, her features softening in sleep. My hand hovered over her face, wanting to trace the line of her cheek, to somehow erase the pain of her past. But I managed to hold myself back, and a strange bitterness welled up inside me.





Eleanor's POV

As I pulled up, my high heels clicking against the pavement with deliberate nonchalance. Quinn wasn't answering my texts. I pressed my phone to my ear, listening to it ring while fishing through my designer bag for cigarettes.

"Finally decided to pick up?" I drawled when she answered. "Where were you at Grandpa's birthday party? Don't tell me you were busy playing servant for the Sherwoods again."

Her tired sigh came through the line. "Eleanor, you know how it is. The Sherwood project deadline-"

"Always the Sherwood project," I cut her off, my heels clicking against the floor as I approached my suite. "You're basically running yourself into the ground for Spencer. What's the point? He won't even notice."

"It's not about Spencer," Quinn protested, but I could hear the hesitation in her voice. "I'm doing this for myself, for my career."

"Right," I drawled. "Keep telling yourself that. You know you can't lie to me, Quinn."

I pushed open the door to my suite, instantly noticing something was off. The bathroom light was on, spilling a warm glow into the darkness of my bedroom. I froze, my hand tightening around my phone.

"By the way," I continued smoothly, not missing a beat, "I'll be filming in Weehawken for the next few weeks. We should meet up."

"Sounds good," Quinn replied, oblivious to my situation.

"Get some rest, okay? Don't work too late." I kept my voice steady as I approached the bathroom door. "Good night."

I ended the call just as I pushed open the door, coming face to face with Jace Gillard. He stood there in casual clothes, his ears turning red as he realized the compromising situation.

"Well," I drawled, leaning against the doorframe with forced casualness, "this is unexpected. What brings the great Director Gillard to my humble bathroom?"

He turned around slowly, his expression carefully neutral. "There was a leak in my bathroom. I didn't know you'd be back today."

"Clearly." I let my lips curl into a sardonic smile. "Shouldn't you be with Evelyn?"

"Eleanor..." His voice held a warning note.

"Sorry, should I call you 'Uncle Jace' instead?" I watched his jaw tighten at the formal title. "That would be more appropriate, wouldn't it?"

The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words. Finally, he moved past me, his shoulder barely brushing mine. "I'll have maintenance fix the leak tomorrow."

"Don't bother," I called after him. "I won't be staying long anyway."

The door clicked shut behind him, and I waited until his footsteps faded away. Only then did I let my carefully constructed facade crumble. My hands shook slightly as I lit a cigarette, watching the smoke curl toward the ceiling. The cigarette burned down to my fingers. I barely felt the sting.
###chapter 35
Serena's POV

The sharp morning light pierced through my eyelids, adding to the merciless throbbing in my head. I groaned, slowly becoming aware that I was still wearing last night's gown, the fabric now wrinkled beyond salvation.

As I shifted, a slight sting from my ankle caught my attention. Looking down, I discovered a neatly applied bandage - definitely not my handiwork. The memory flickered: Lucas, crouching down with careful precision, tending to my twisted ankle. My throat tightened unexpectedly at the thought.

Turning my head gingerly, I spotted a glass of honey water on the bedside table, accompanied by a note in elegant handwriting:

"Honey water helps with hangovers. Remember to eat breakfast - an empty stomach after being sick isn't good for you. I'm traveling for business, back in the city in a week."

No flourishes, no unnecessary words. Classic Lucas. I reached for the glass, the honey's subtle sweetness surprisingly comforting against my parched throat. 

After a much-needed shower, I unceremoniously tossed the ruined gown into the trash. "Free dress anyway," I muttered, feeling oddly lighthearted. I'd planned to crawl back into bed, but Lucas's note nagged at me. Fine. Breakfast it is.

As I waited for my coffee to brew, my phone buzzed. Ian Whitmore. A photo appeared on my screen - Lucas grabbed Eleanor's hand, refusing to let her go. Anger was evident on Eleanor's face, and both of them were dressed in the evening gowns from last night's banquet.

My heart sank, leaving a hollow emptiness inside. A inexplicable anxiety washed over me. 

Ian's message followed: "Serena, don't get any ideas. Lucas Harrington isn't seriously interested in you. You're just pretty enough to play with. Trust me, a man like him has women lining up. You're just one of many."

I remembered Milo's innocent comment weeks ago: "Daddy really likes Miss Eleanor!" Looking back on everything that happened last night, I can't help but feel it was all so ridiculous-I almost got fooled again. The coffee machine beeped, its timing almost comical. 

My fingers hovered over the phone for a moment before typing: "In adult games, who's playing whom isn't always clear." Without waiting for his response, I blocked him.






Nina's POV
The morning sun crept through the floor-to-ceiling windows of my bedroom, casting a soft glow on the pink silk sheets. I scrolled through my phone for the tenth time, refreshing various news sites and social media feeds. Nothing. Not a single photo or mention of last night's Harrington family banquet had made it online.

I couldn't help but admire their influence. The Harringtons truly were in a league of their own - when they wanted something kept private, it stayed private. My gaze drifted to the silver Valentino gown still draped over my vanity chair, memories of last night's events playing through my mind.

My phone buzzed, Ian's name lighting up the screen. I stared at it for a moment, suppressing a sigh before answering with my sweetest voice. "Ian! I just woke up."

"Nina, did you sleep well?" His tone carried that familiar warmth that used to make my heart flutter. Now it just felt... tedious.

I forced a small yawn. "Mm-hmm. I missed you at the banquet last night. Where were you?"

"About that..." He paused. "My father thinks it's time we made our relationship public."

I sat up straighter, my mind racing even as I kept my voice soft and uncertain. "But Ian, didn't you say you were worried about Serena causing trouble? If she makes a scene, both our families will be affected."

He let out a bitter laugh. "Your sister's too busy with Lucas Harrington now to care about us."

The mention of Lucas made my fingers tighten around the phone. Lucas Harrington. The image of him from last night flashed through my mind - tall and commanding in his perfectly tailored suit, those piercing grey eyes that seemed to see right through everyone's facades. Everyone's except mine.

"Still," I pressed on, coating my words with concern, "the media's barely forgotten about the broken engagement. If we go public now, won't it seem like..." I let my voice trail off, knowing Ian would fill in the blanks himself.

"Nina..." The frustration in his voice was evident.

"I just want to protect you," I whispered, playing my role perfectly. "You know I don't care about keeping us secret. As long as I have you, nothing else matters."

After a few more minutes of careful manipulation - a delicate balance of sweet promises and practical concerns - I finally ended the call. The smile dropped from my face as I tossed my phone aside.

I walked to the window, looking out over the Manhattan skyline. Ian Whitmore was becoming more of a liability than an asset. He'd served his purpose in making Serena miserable, but now? Now I had my sights set on something far more valuable. Someone who truly deserved to stand at the top.

Lucas Harrington.

Let the real game begin.
###chapter 36
Serena's POV

I leaned back in the chair in my office, my eyes scanning over the design proposal for what felt like the hundredth time. The presentation boards were spread across my desk, each one representing hours of solitary work - work I had to do alone because I couldn't trust anyone in the design department. They were all Nina's people now.

My coffee had long gone cold, but I took a sip anyway, grimacing at the bitter taste. The clock on my computer showed 2:47 AM. In less than six hours, I would be presenting this to the board. A meeting that everyone expected to be my downfall.

"Ms. Sinclair?" Vincent's voice startled me. I hadn't realized he was still here. "I brought you fresh coffee."

I managed a small smile. "You should have gone home hours ago."

"I thought you might need this for tomorrow's meeting." He set down the steaming cup, his eyes flickering over the design boards. "Everything looks amazing."

"Thank you, Vincent." I paused, considering. "For tomorrow's meeting, make sure we have enough coffee for everyone. It might run long."

"American coffee for everyone except Mr. Chapman. He prefers green tea, right?"

I nodded, impressed by his attention to detail. "Perfect. And make sure to document everyone's arrival times tomorrow."

After he left, I turned back to the window, watching the city lights blur through my reflection. Tomorrow would be more than just a presentation - it would be a chess match.

Morning arrived too quickly and not soon enough. I was already in the conference room when the first executives began trickling in. Henry Lockwood arrived first, then the rest of the senior management team. I watched their subtle exchanges - the raised eyebrows, the knowing smirks. They all expected to witness my failure today.

"Nina sends her apologies," Vincent announced from the doorway. "She'll be a few minutes late."

Perfect timing. I kept my expression neutral as I began the presentation. "Shall we start? I know everyone's time is valuable."

I clicked through the first few slides, laying the groundwork for our new direction. The collection I'd designed was a deliberate fusion of cyberpunk elements with 1960s vintage aesthetics - something that would set trends rather than follow them. With each new slide, the smirks around the table began to fade, replaced by genuine interest and, in some cases, poorly concealed surprise.

Nina chose that moment to make her entrance, her practiced apologetic smile freezing when she saw the designs on the screen.

"Perfect timing, Nina," I said warmly. "We were just getting to the market positioning strategy."

The next hour passed in a blur of presentations, questions, and barely concealed tension. When I finally clicked to the last slide, the silence in the room was deafening.

"Any questions?" I asked, knowing there wouldn't be any. The presentation was bulletproof.

"This is..." Henry cleared his throat. "Quite comprehensive."

I smiled. "I'm glad you think so. And speaking of comprehensive - I believe in recognizing excellent work. I'd like to announce a bonus structure for this project."

The energy in the room shifted instantly. I could practically see the wheels turning in their heads, recalculating their allegiances.

"For each member of the design team, a $3,000 bonus." I paused, letting that sink in. "And for Nina, who has been so... instrumental in this process, a special bonus of $50,000."

Nina's head snapped up, her eyes wide with confusion. She knew as well as I did that she had contributed nothing to this project. In fact, she had actively worked against it. But now she was trapped - accept the bonus and tacitly admit to being outmaneuvered, or refuse it and lose face.

"That's... very generous," she managed.

I continued smoothly, "I'd like to discuss our brand ambassador situation. I understand you're handling the contract renewal with Chloe Addison?"

Nina recovered quickly, her practiced smile back in place. "Yes, she's been very cooperative, and her rates are quite reasonable."

"I was thinking we might want to aim higher." I pulled up Eleanor Yates's latest campaign photos. "Her aesthetic would align perfectly with our new direction."

I watched Nina's expression carefully. There it was - that flash of dismissal, the certainty that I couldn't possibly afford Eleanor Yates.

The meeting wrapped up shortly after, with the executives filing out in a markedly different mood than when they'd entered. Nina lingered behind, clearly wanting to speak with me, but I gathered my materials unhurriedly.

"Serena," she started, her voice honey-sweet. "The designs are incredible. I had no idea you were working on something so... ambitious."

I met her gaze steadily. "Sometimes the best moves are the ones nobody sees coming."

"Nina." I called out just as Nina was about to leave my office. She turned, her heels clicking softly against the polished floor. "Remember, what we discussed about the endorsement changes stays between us for now."

"Of course, Serena." Nina's lips curved into what she probably thought was a sincere smile. "I completely understand the need for confidentiality at this stage."

I maintained my professional smile as I watched her leave. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed increased activity around the secretary's desk - likely observers planted by other executives. Perfect. The performance had achieved exactly what I'd intended. Now it was just a matter of time.

Back at my desk, I reviewed the decision to change StarRiver's brand ambassador. The current market position of our fashion line was, to put it kindly, unremarkable. In today's cutthroat luxury market, being average was equivalent to being obsolete. We needed both internal strengthening and external rebranding.

Eleanor Yates was the perfect choice. Her recent indie film success had caught the attention of several major fashion houses, but she hadn't signed any apparel endorsements yet. The window of opportunity was closing fast. In business, I'd learned to keep emotions out of decisions. The numbers spoke for themselves.

I picked up my phone, staring at a number I hadn't dialed in over a year. Memories of that rainy night flooded back - Jace Gillard helping me to the hospital, covering the medical bills without hesitation. We'd exchanged numbers afterward, though we'd never really stayed in touch.

The line rang three times before his familiar voice answered. "Serena. This is unexpected."

"Jace," I said, keeping my tone light. "I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time."

"For you? Never." His easy charm hadn't changed. "What can I do for Manhattan's most formidable CEO?"

"I need to connect with Eleanor Yates. I understand you're handling some of her projects." I paused briefly. "It's about a potential endorsement deal."

The silence that followed was unexpected. Jace was known for his quick responses and ready wit. This hesitation felt... deliberate.

"I see," he finally said, his tone carefully neutral. "You know, it's interesting you're coming to me about this. Wouldn't it be easier to reach out through... other channels?"
###chapter 37
Jace's POV

There was a brief pause before Serena replied, her voice firm. "I prefer to handle business matters through proper channels, Jace. I believe that's the most professional approach."

I felt my respect for her tick up a notch. No wonder Lucas was so intrigued. "Of course. Let me check Eleanor's schedule and get back to you."

After ending the call, I immediately dialed Lucas. This was too good an opportunity to pass up.

"Harrington speaking," his deep voice came through, all business as usual.

"Hey," I drawled, already anticipating his reaction. "Just had an interesting call from Serena Sinclair. Seems she's interested in working with Eleanor."

The silence on the other end was deafening. I could practically hear him tensing up.

"Oh?" His attempt at casual interest failed miserably. "And what did you tell her?"

"Well, as her *passing acquaintance*," I emphasized the words deliberately, "I told her I'd check Eleanor's schedule."

"Passing acquaintance?" The edge in his voice was exactly what I'd been fishing for. "Since when do you-"

"Got to go, Lucas. Some of us have actual work to do." I hung up, chuckling at his predictable reaction. For someone so composed in business, he was hilariously transparent when it came to Serena.

At the film set later that afternoon, I spotted Eleanor walking past, her usual cool demeanor firmly in place. The way she deliberately avoided looking in my direction.

"Eleanor," I called out, keeping my voice professional. "Got a minute?"

She paused, turning slowly. "What is it?"

"You should be able to wrap by four today," I said, watching her expression carefully. "Serena Sinclair would like to discuss a potential endorsement."

The slight widening of her eyes at Serena's name didn't escape my notice. "Serena? Who? That woman Lucas jumped in to help at the last dinner?"

"The very same." I maintained my casual tone. "I can skip the dinner meeting if you'd prefer to meet with her privately."

Eleanor studied me for a moment, probably trying to decode my motives. Finally, she nodded. "That would be... acceptable."

As I watched her walk away, I pulled out my phone to text Serena the details. Her reply came quickly - a polite request to visit the set beforehand. Another point in her favor; she understood the value of personal touches in business.

Smart woman, I thought, sending her the address. No wonder Lucas is so smitten.



Serena's POV

The buzz of my phone drew my attention away from the reports. Jace had already sent over the film set's location and schedule - his efficiency was a pleasant surprise.

"Vincent," I called through the intercom. "Please arrange for Le Jardin's signature dessert box to be delivered to the film set this afternoon. Have it sent under Eleanor Yates's name."

"Of course, Ms. Sinclair. What time should we plan to leave for the set visit?"

"Three o'clock. Make sure the car's ready." I turned back to my laptop, determined to clear my schedule before the visit.

The drive to Weehawken took longer than expected. I used the time to review quarterly projections, occasionally glancing out at the changing landscape as we left the city behind. The film studio complex emerged gradually - a sprawling collection of buildings and outdoor sets that looked like pieces from different time periods cobbled together.

When we arrived, filming was already in progress. Jace stood behind the monitors, his presence commanding even in casual attire. He acknowledged me with a slight nod - the kind of professional courtesy I appreciated. No need for small talk when work was in progress.

I found myself unexpectedly drawn into the scene unfolding before the cameras. Eleanor Yates stood in period costume, her character caught in what appeared to be an emotional confrontation. The way she conveyed internal struggle through subtle changes in expression was masterful.

Then came the kiss scene. I watched as her co-star leaned in, noted the flicker of hesitation in Eleanor's eyes before she closed them. A single tear traced down her cheek - and then she turned away, breaking character.

"Cut!" Jace called out, his voice firm but not unkind. 

"I'm sorry," Eleanor said, quickly wiping away the tear as she addressed the crew. The vulnerability in her voice vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

Jace announced a brief break, and the set burst into organized chaos as crews began resetting for a different scene. That's when Eleanor noticed me.

"Ms. Sinclair," she said, approaching with a warm smile that seemed genuine despite her obvious fatigue. "You're even more striking in person than in the business magazines."

"You're too kind," I replied, matching her tone. "Though I must say, your performance just now was incredible. The emotional depth you brought to that scene..."

She laughed softly. "Are you sure you've never acted? You have the presence for it."

"Trust me, I'll stick to what I know. Speaking of which, regarding the endorsement discussion-"

"Over dinner?" she suggested, dabbing at her face with a tissue. "I actually have a friend joining us - I hope that's not an issue?"

"Not at all."

"And thank you for the desserts," she added. "That was thoughtful."

"Just a small gesture of appreciation for your time."

As I watched her return to her position, I found myself pleasantly surprised. I'd expected more resistance, perhaps even hostility, given the complicated dynamics of the industry. Instead, Eleanor Yates seemed refreshingly straightforward.
###chapter 38
Eleanor's POV

As I stared at my reflection in the makeup mirror, willing my racing heart to slow down. Five years in the industry, over a dozen productions, and here I was about to film my first on-screen kiss. The thought made my stomach churn.

"Eleanor?" Ryan, my scene partner, approached with what he probably thought was a reassuring smile. "Want to run through the dialogue one more time?"

I managed a tight nod, though conversation was the last thing I wanted. The crew bustled around us, adjusting lights and checking equipment, their movements only amplifying my anxiety.

"Scene three, take two!" The slate clapped, making me jump slightly.

Ryan moved closer, his cologne too strong in the confined space. My back hit the wall as he placed his hand beside my head, exactly as blocked in rehearsal. But as his face drew near, I jerked away.

"I'm sorry," I mumbled, heat rising to my cheeks.

"Cut!" Jace's voice cut through the tension. The director's chair scraped against the floor as he stood. "Eleanor, a word?"

My stomach dropped as I followed him to a quiet corner of the set. Here it comes, I thought. The legendary "Demon Jace" was about to tear into me for wasting everyone's time. But his next words surprised me.

"We can cut the kiss scene," he said quietly. "I'll revise the script."

I stared at him, caught off guard by this unexpected suggestion. Then anger flared - not at his words, but at what they implied.

"If you didn't want me doing kiss scenes, you shouldn't have written them in the first place," I said, my voice steady despite my racing pulse. "I won't be the one taking the blame for script changes now."

Something flickered in his eyes - surprise? respect? - before he nodded curtly. "Places, then."

Back against the wall, I closed my eyes, fists clenched at my sides. The camera whirred, Ryan's footsteps approached, and then his lips were on mine. I forced myself to stay still, to play my part - until I felt his tongue push against my lips.

My whole body went rigid, but professional training kept me from shoving him away. The seconds stretched like hours until finally, mercifully, Jace called "Cut!"

I didn't wait for feedback. Pushing past Ryan, I strode toward my trailer, but his voice followed me.

"Eleanor, wait! Sorry about that, the director wanted more passion in the scene-"

I whirled around, a bitter laugh escaping my throat. "Jace told you to use tongue?"

"Well, no, but-"

"Then don't you dare blame him for taking liberties." My voice shook with rage, tears pricking at the corners of my eyes. The hypocrisy of it all hit me - Jace's earlier "concern" now feeling like a calculated move rather than genuine consideration.

"I was just trying to make it more convincing," Ryan protested weakly.

"Save it." I turned away, gesturing for my assistant to follow. As we walked to my trailer, I could feel dozens of eyes on my back. 

"Start removing this makeup," I told my assistant once we were safely inside. "I'm done for today."

As she worked, I caught my reflection in the mirror again. My eyes were bright with unshed tears, but there was steel in them too. Five years in this industry had taught me plenty about playing my part - but some lines weren't meant to be crossed.
Serena's POV

I kept my gaze fixed on the phone screen, deliberately ignoring the incoming message notification. Through the tinted windows of my Mercedes, I had a clear view of the film set where Eleanor was finishing her scene. Ryan Anderson's "accidental" prolonging of the kiss scene didn't escape my notice, nor did the subtle darkening of Jace's expression.

The door opened, and Eleanor slid into the back seat, her dress rustling against the leather. "I'm so sorry for keeping you waiting, Serena."

"No need to apologize," I responded smoothly, maintaining my professional demeanor. "Today's schedule is relatively flexible." I gestured to the driver, and we pulled away from the set, heading toward Aquavit.

The restaurant's VIP room exuded quiet luxury and panoramic city views. After we settled in, Eleanor's friends,Quinn Ashford arrived.
Eleanor greeted, "Quinn, it's so good to see you again," then casually introduced me: "This is Serena."
"Isn't this Ian Whitmore's fiancée?" Quinn Ashford asked discreetly.

"Former," I corrected without missing a beat, my tone carrying just enough finality to discourage further discussion. "Eleanor, shall we discuss the endorsement details first?"

Eleanor leaned back in her chair, studying me with unexpected directness. "To be honest, StarRiver's clothing line is too... ordinary. It lacks the impact I look for in partnerships."

I felt a flicker of surprise at her candor - most A-list celebrities would have found a more diplomatic way to phrase that criticism. But her straightforwardness was refreshing. "You're right," I acknowledged, reaching for my portfolio. "StarRiver was under my father's management until recently. To be direct: yes, our previous collections were ordinary. But that's about to change."

I spread out the design sketches for our upcoming season. Eleanor's eyes widened slightly as she leaned forward, her fingers hovering over the detailed renderings. The subtle shift in her expression told me everything I needed to know.

"We're implementing a complete brand reformation," I continued, watching her study each design with growing interest. "These pieces will debut exclusively with our new campaign."

"The market positioning, production timeline?" Eleanor asked, her initial skepticism giving way to professional curiosity.

"All planned and secured. We're prepared to offer twenty million for the endorsement contract."

Eleanor's lips curved into an unexpected smile. "Let's make it ten."

I blinked, certain I had misheard. "I'm sorry?"

"Half price," she clarified, her eyes meeting mine with surprising warmth. "If I don't give a discount, I'll get criticized from family. Ten million, and I'll be StarRiver's exclusive spokesperson."
###chapter 39
Serena's POV

The offer caught me off guard - it was far better than anything I had hoped for. But years of business negotiations had taught me to maintain my composure. "That's very generous of you, Eleanor."

"Not generous," she corrected, gathering the designs into a neat pile. "Smart. I recognize potential when I see it, Serena. And what you're showing me here?" She tapped the portfolio. "This is going to be something special."

I studied Eleanor's face carefully, searching for any hint of ulterior motive behind those surprisingly favorable terms. The memory of those photos Ian had sent - showing her and Lucas in what appeared to be an intimate moment at charity event - flickered through my mind.

"These terms are... unexpectedly generous," I said carefully, keeping my tone professional despite my internal wariness.

Eleanor's laugh was warm and genuine as she waved her hand dismissively. "Oh please, business is business. I like keeping things straightforward." She leaned forward, her eyes twinkling. "Speaking of which, Alice can handle the contract signing tomorrow morning if that works for you?"

I nodded, still slightly thrown by her easy manner. Before I could respond further, she suddenly declared, "You know what? Let's celebrate! This calls for a drink."

"Elly," Quinn interjected softly from beside her, ever the voice of reason. "You have that morning scene tomorrow..."

"Not until eleven," Eleanor countered with a grin, already signaling the waiter. She turned to me, her expression brightening. "And please, call me Elly. All this formality is exhausting."

The corners of my mouth lifted despite my reservations. "Then you should call me Rena."

As the waiter arrived with a bottle of wine that probably cost more than most people's monthly rent, I found myself relaxing incrementally. Eleanor sitting across from me was nothing like her carefully curated public image. Where the cameras captured elegance and reserve, the woman before me radiated warmth and an almost reckless authenticity.

Three glasses in, I discovered that female friendship could indeed be forged over good wine and better conversation. Eleanor's stories about her early career had me laughing despite myself, while Quinn's dry commentary added the perfect counterpoint to Eleanor's exuberance.

"You should have seen me in my first commercial," Eleanor was saying, gesturing expressively. "I was supposed to be this sophisticated lady drinking tea, but I kept burning my tongue on every take. By the twentieth attempt, I was ready to swear off hot beverages forever!"

The night deepened around us, the restaurant's subtle lighting creating intimate pools of warmth in our private room. As eleven o'clock approached, I noticed my phone screen lighting up with a message. Lucas's name appeared, as it had every night recently. I turned the phone face down, the familiar mixture of longing and determination washing over me.

"Let me call my driver," I offered, noting how the wine had left me pleasantly warm but still coherent. Eleanor, on the other hand, was practically glowing with good cheer.

"No need," Quinn answered smoothly, already helping Eleanor into her coat. "We're headed in the same direction. Besides, I think someone needs to make sure this one actually makes it to set tomorrow."

"I am a consummate professional!" Eleanor protested, then stumbled slightly as she stood. "Usually."

As I watched their car disappear into the night traffic, I felt my phone vibrate again. Another message from Lucas. My finger hovered over the notification for a moment before I resolutely slipped the phone into my bag. No matter how much my heart ached to respond, some distances needed to be maintained.





Eleanor's POV

The city lights blurred past my window as I pressed my phone closer to my ear, giggling into it with exaggerated triumph. "Lucas, guess what?" I singsonged, my voice carrying the warmth of several glasses of wine. "I actually managed to drink your precious Serena under the table tonight."

I could practically hear his disapproving frown through the phone. It only made me laugh harder, the sound bubbling up from somewhere warm and loose in my chest. "Oh, don't worry... she's fine. Just maybe... a tiny bit more drunk than usual." The words came out slurred, but I wasn't nearly as intoxicated as I was pretending to be. It was just easier this way - playing up the tipsiness, letting everyone think I was just the fun, carefree Eleanor who could drink anyone under the table and bounce back the next morning like nothing happened.

"Mmm... getting sleepy now," I mumbled into the phone, already letting my voice trail off. "Talk tomorrow..." I ended the call and let my head fall against the cool window, maintaining the steady breathing of someone drifting off to sleep. It was a practiced art by now - this ability to seem completely passed out at will. Quinn's soft sigh from the driver's seat told me she wasn't surprised. She'd seen this routine plenty of times before.

The car rolled to a stop, and I heard Quinn's door open and close. I kept my eyes shut, my breathing deep and even. But then I heard another car door slam nearby, followed by footsteps that made my heart stutter in my chest. I knew those footsteps. Even after eight years, I still knew them.

"Eleanor's had a bit too much to drink," Quinn explained, her voice carrying a note of apology. "Would you mind getting her upstairs? I can't quite manage on my own."

There was a pause - just long enough for my pulse to pick up speed - before Jace's low voice responded with a simple, "Alright."

I forced myself to stay completely still as strong arms slid beneath me, lifting me with surprising gentleness. The familiar scent of his cologne wrapped around me, and suddenly I was seventeen again, sitting on the school roof with Quinn under a star-filled sky, my words tumbling out in an excited whisper: "I think I'm in love with him, Quinn. I think I'm in love with Jace."

The elevator ride was silent except for our breathing. I focused on keeping mine steady, fighting against the way my body wanted to react to his proximity. When we reached my floor, his arms tightened slightly, adjusting his grip as he carried me to my door. 

He laid me down on my bed with a gentleness that made my chest ache. But instead of leaving immediately, he hesitated. I could feel him standing there, could sense him looking down at me. Then, so lightly I might have imagined it, his fingertip brushed across my lower lip. The touch was feather-soft, almost reverent, and I knew he was thinking about the kiss scene I'd filmed earlier that day. His breath caught, just slightly, and I felt him lean closer.

For one endless moment, I thought he might... but then he straightened up. His footsteps moved away, and the door clicked shut behind him.

Only then did I let the tears slip free, sliding silently down my temples into my hair.
###chapter 40
Serena's POV

My head throbbing with the aftermath of last night's drinks with Eleanor. The taste of black coffee did little to dispel my hangover. Fragments of the previous evening flashed through my mind - Eleanor getting increasingly drunk, her usually composed demeanor crumbling as she emptied glass after glass of wine.

"Ms. Sinclair?" Vincent's voice cut through my thoughts. He stood at the doorway, holding a stack of documents. "The contracts are ready, and Ms. Yates's agent has confirmed their arrival."

I straightened in my chair, ignoring the protest from my aching head. "Give me a moment." Despite the discomfort, signing Eleanor was too important to delay. StarRiver needed this win.

The conference room was mercifully dimmer than my office. Eleanor sat with her agent, looking immaculate despite our late night - though I noticed the slight strain around her eyes. She managed a professional smile as I entered.

"I apologize for last night," she murmured as we exchanged pleasantries. "I rarely drink that much..."

"It's fine. Let's focus on today's contract." I kept my tone polite but measured. Something about how easily this deal had fallen into place made me uneasy, especially given Eleanor's connection to Lucas.

After the signatures were complete, I turned to Vincent. "Keep this under wraps until the official announcement."

"Of course, Ms. Sinclair. Legal has reviewed all confidentiality clauses." His efficiency was reassuring - a welcome change from the constant information leaks under my previous secretary.

Back in my office, I stared at the stack of reports on my desk. Having a competent secretary helped, but it didn't change the fact that Father still controlled most of the company. Every decision felt like walking through a minefield.

By late afternoon, the headache had become unbearable. I packed up early, something I rarely allowed myself to do. The ride home was a blur of city lights and traffic sounds. I ordered takeout, barely tasting it as I ate, then dragged myself through a hot shower that did little to ease the tension in my shoulders.

In bed, I found myself checking my phone again. No messages from Lucas all day. "No beginning, no end," I muttered to myself, trying to ignore the hollow feeling in my chest. "We each have our own paths."

The doorbell's shrill ring jolted me awake. The bedside clock showed 3 AM in harsh blue digits. Confused and slightly alarmed, I checked the security feed on my phone.

My breath caught. Lucas stood at my door, still in his business suit despite the hour. He wasn't supposed to be back for another three days.

I sat frozen, heart pounding. Part of me wanted to pretend I hadn't heard the bell. Lucas was proud - his showing up like this was unexpected enough. Our day of silence had convinced me we were drifting back to being casual acquaintances.

The doorbell rang again, more insistent this time.

My hand hesitated over the intercom button. One press would either open or close whatever this was between us. The late hour made everything feel more significant, more dangerous.

Finally, I pressed the button. "I'll be right down."




Lucas's POV

I stood in the elevator, watching the floor numbers tick upward. I adjusted my tie in the mirrored wall, a habitual gesture more than necessity. Even with the slight buzz of alcohol, I maintained my composure - a lifetime of training wasn't easily undone by a few drinks.

The hallway to Serena's apartment stretched before me, softly lit and empty. Each step echoed against the floors, matching the steady rhythm of my heartbeat. I paused before her door, allowing myself a moment to inhale deeply.

My knuckles hovered over the door. Ridiculous, really. I'd faced down boardrooms of hostile investors without hesitation, yet here I was, uncertain about knocking on a door. The irony wasn't lost on me. Finally, I rapped against the wood, three precise knocks.

Footsteps approached from inside. Light, measured steps - I'd learned to recognize her walk. The door opened, and Serena appeared in the narrow gap. Her hair was loose around her shoulders, and she wore simple loungewear. The warm light from her apartment caught the wariness in her eyes.

"Did you get the wrong apartment?" Her voice was polite but distant, like addressing a stranger who'd lost their way.

I let a slight smile play across my lips. "No, I came to see you." The words came out softer than intended, betraying more than I meant to.

"It's late. I was about to sleep." She shifted her weight, subtly increasing the distance between us. The movement was small, but it felt like a chasm opening.

"I apologize for the intrusion." I maintained my smile, though something cold settled in my stomach. "I was in the neighborhood and thought-"

"You could have called." She cut me off, her tone clipped. "If there's something urgent."

"You haven't been answering my messages lately." I kept my voice light, but we both knew the weight behind those words.

"I've been busy." A practiced response, delivered without meeting my eyes. "And I have an early meeting tomorrow."

I opened my mouth to respond, to press further, but she was already stepping back. "Good night, Lucas." The door closed with a quiet finality.

I stood there, staring at the polished wood. The last time I'd seen her, she'd smiled at me, her eyes warm with something that had made my heart race. Now this wall of politeness. What had changed? I replayed our recent interactions, searching for a misstep, but found nothing that warranted this sudden frost.

My phone buzzed. Miles, my driver, was calling. I let it ring twice before answering.

"Sir, I-"

"Where are you?" Ice had crept into my voice.

"I thought you'd be longer, so I went to-"

"Come back. Now." I ended the call, sliding the phone back into my pocket with controlled precision.

When Miles arrived fifteen minutes later, I was waiting by the curb, my expression carefully neutral. He started to apologize, but I held up my hand.

"Phone and wallet." My tone left no room for argument.

His face paled. "Sir, it's past midnight-"

"That's correct. Perhaps next time you'll remember to wait." I took his belongings and stepped into the car. "The walk home will give you time to reflect on following instructions."
###chapter 41
Serena's POV

The autumn collection's launch meeting ran longer than expected. Sitting at the head of the conference table, I rubbed my temples, trying to maintain composure while processing Arthur Burton's report. My stomach churned - not from skipping lunch, but from the barely concealed mockery in his tone.

"So, Mr. Burton, you're telling me our entire production line is at a standstill because of a sudden worker strike?" I kept my voice level, though my fingers tightened around the production report. "And this information is only reaching me now, three weeks before our launch?"

Arthur leaned back in his chair, a slight smirk playing at the corners of his mouth. "With all due respect, Ms. Sinclair, you've been quite busy with the marketing campaign. We didn't want to trouble you with... operational details."

The condescension in his voice made my blood boil. Around the table, I caught several executives exchanging glances. They were waiting to see how I'd handle this - the young CEO facing her first major crisis. I could practically hear their thoughts: "Just like her father predicted. Too inexperienced."

"Operational details?" I placed the report down with deliberate slowness. "Mr. Burton, a complete production stoppage isn't a detail - it's a catastrophe that threatens our entire fall season. When exactly did this strike begin?"

He shuffled through some papers, taking his time. "About... ten days ago?"

"Ten days." The words fell like ice between us. "And the standard protocol for labor disputes is to notify senior management within twenty-four hours. Would you care to explain this discrepancy?"

Arthur's smirk faltered slightly. "Well, we thought-"

"No," I cut him off, rising from my chair. "You didn't think. Or rather, you thought you could undermine this launch by withholding critical information." I turned to address the room at large. "Let me be perfectly clear: if this collection fails to launch on schedule, every dollar of lost revenue will be traced back to those responsible for the delay. Every. Single. Dollar."

The silence that followed was deafening. I nodded to Vincent. "Get the car ready. We're going to the factory."

As the room emptied, Arthur lingered, his earlier smugness replaced by calculation. "Ms. Sinclair, the workers are quite... agitated. Perhaps it would be better to let HR handle-"

"Thank you for your concern, Mr. Burton." I gathered my tablet and phone. "But I prefer to see things for myself."

In the elevator, Vincent waited until we were alone before speaking. "The workers are claiming unpaid overtime, Ms. Sinclair. But all the official records show full payment."

I closed my eyes briefly. Of course. "Two sets of books?"

"Most likely. And Mr. Burton has been handling all communication with the factory manager, Leon Hendrix."

The pieces were falling into place. My father's allies, positioned throughout the company, working to orchestrate my failure. I took a deep breath, squaring my shoulders as we reached the parking level.

"Vincent, call Legal. Have them start reviewing our labor contracts. And get me everything we have on overtime payments for the past six months."

The drive to the factory took forty minutes - forty minutes I spent reviewing financial reports and trying to ignore the gnawing realization that I'd been blind to this brewing crisis.

The factory parking lot was eerily empty when we arrived. Leon Hendrix met us at the entrance, his expression a mix of smirk and barely concealed disdain.

"Ms. Sinclair," he drawled, looking me up and down. "This is unexpected. My daughter's about your age, you know. Though she's still learning the basics of retail."

"How fortunate for her," I replied coolly. "I, on the other hand, am here to discuss why our workers haven't received their overtime pay."

His face darkened. "I wasn't aware you were familiar with factory operations."

"I'm familiar with basic mathematics, Mr. Hendrix. And the numbers aren't adding up."

Before he could respond, a commotion erupted from the factory floor. A group of workers had spotted us through the windows, and within minutes, we were surrounded by dozens of angry faces. I caught a glimpse of Leon Hendrix as he casually walked to his office.


"It's the CEO!" someone shouted. "Don't let her leave until we get our money!"

I raised my hands, keeping my voice steady. "I'm here to understand exactly what's happening and make it right."

"That's what they all say!" A woman pushed forward - their representative, I guessed. "We've been working twelve-hour shifts for months with no extra pay. We have families!"

Looking into their tired, angry faces, I felt shame burn through me. How had I missed this? All those glossy reports about increased productivity, and I'd never questioned the human cost.

"I give you my word," I said, meeting the representative's eyes, "this will be resolved. Not with promises - with action. Starting now."

"Words are cheap," she shot back. "We've heard it all before."

"Then let's move past words." I turned to Vincent. "Call the finance department. I want a complete audit team here within the hour. And get me a tablet - we're going to review every overtime record, right here, right now."

The crowd stirred, surprised by the immediate response. 





Nina's POV


My dad's phone buzzed, it's Leon.

"The workers have surrounded the site," Leon reported, his voice tense. "Serena Sinclair is trapped inside the office building."

I fought to keep the smile from my lips. Of course she'd get herself into such a mess - what did she expect, marching into that construction site like she could solve anything? 
Father sank in the chair, a cigar between his lips as he answered the phone, "Teach her a lesson."
"Boss, rest assured-I know what to do." 
He hung up, a satisfied grin curling at the corners of his mouth. "Now, Nina, about the Whitmore family's proposal..."
I straightened in my seat, carefully arranging my expression into one of demure concern. "The engagement announcement?"

"Daniel called this morning. They want to make things official between you and Ian."

I twisted my fingers in my lap, the picture of daughterly uncertainty. "Dad, I don't think we should announce anything with Ian right now."

His eyes narrowed. "Why not? The Whitmores are one of the most prestigious families in Manhattan. This merger would be-"

"That's exactly why we need to be careful," I interrupted softly, then paused as if gathering my courage. "Have you seen how... close Serena's gotten to Lucas Harrington?"

The mention of Lucas had the intended effect. Father's jaw tightened, his fingers drumming against the desk. "Harrington? He's probably just using her to negotiate better terms."

"Maybe." I bit my lip. "But what if she's trying to use him against us? You know how vindictive she can be."

"Lucas Harrington would never seriously consider someone like her," Father scoffed, but I could see the seed of doubt taking root. "The Harringtons would never accept a woman with her... history."

I leaned forward, pressing my advantage. "But what if she convinces him to target StarRiver? We're vulnerable right now, with all the negative press. And Serena knows all our weaknesses."

Father's expression darkened as he considered the implications. The silence stretched, broken only by the gentle hum of the air conditioning.

"What do you suggest?" he finally asked.

This was the moment I'd been waiting for. I lowered my eyes, the perfect image of filial sacrifice. "I could... try to get close to Lucas myself."

"What about Ian?"

"I care about Ian," I said softly, letting my voice waver just slightly. "But I care about our family more. If being the bad guy is what it takes to protect StarRiver..." I trailed off, knowing Father would fill in the blanks himself.

"The Whitmores won't take kindly to being strung along."

"We don't have to burn that bridge yet," I assured him. "Just... delay things. Keep our options open."

I could practically see the wheels turning in Father's head as he weighed the possibilities. The Harringtons were, after all, far more powerful than the Whitmores. And Lucas... well, if Serena could catch his eye, how hard could it be?

"You'd do this for the family?" Father asked, studying my face.

I met his gaze steadily, while inside my heart raced with triumph. "Of course, Dad. We can't let Serena destroy everything you've built."
###chapter 42
Serena's POV

"Don't believe her empty promises!" The female worker representative's voice cut through the uneasy silence. Her face was flushed with anger as she stood up again. "This is just a delaying tactic. We demand proper compensation and benefits!"

Looking at the crowd of agitated workers, I knew with crushing certainty that further explanation would be pointless. Their minds were already made up, carefully manipulated by forces working in the shadows. Lawrence's influence was clear in how perfectly orchestrated this protest appeared.

Vincent stood slightly behind me, his presence reassuring despite the volatile situation. I turned slightly, keeping my voice low. "Find a way to slip out and call the police."

"Ms. Sinclair, I can't leave you alone-" His concerned whisper was cut short by my firm response.

"I'll be fine. We need backup before this escalates further." I maintained steady eye contact until I saw understanding flash across his face. Vincent gave an almost imperceptible nod and began to carefully edge.

Half hours later, the piercing wail of police sirens shattered what remained of the fragile order. Their faces contorting with panic and renewed anger. The situation was spiraling out of control faster than I'd anticipated.

I took advantage of the chaos to move toward the exit, keeping my movements deliberate and calm despite my racing heart.

"Ms. Sinclair, look out!" Vincent's terrified shout made me whirl around. Time seemed to slow as I caught sight of the steel pipe arcing toward my head. My body froze, mind blank except for the absurd thought that at least I'd worn my favorite suit to what might be my last day.

The impact I braced for never came. Instead, I felt myself being yanked sideways and enveloped in a protective embrace. A sickening thud followed, accompanied by a grunt of pain from my rescuer. I knew that voice.

Looking up, I found myself staring into Lucas's face, his features tight with barely concealed pain. "Are you hurt?" he managed through gritted teeth.

Before I could respond, he broke into a harsh coughing fit that he tried to suppress. My stomach dropped when I noticed the growing dark stain on the back of his pristine suit jacket. The steel pipe had caught him squarely across the shoulders.

"Get Mr. Harrington to the hospital immediately!" I ordered Miles, my voice sharp with urgency. When a police officer approached about taking statements, I cut him off with a quick gesture. "Vincent will handle the initial report. This man needs medical attention now."

Lucas tried to protest, but another cough silenced him. I could feel him trembling slightly from the effort of staying upright. "Don't talk," I commanded, surprising myself with how steady my voice remained despite the terror coursing through me. "We're going to the hospital. Now."

As Miles helped Lucas toward the exit, my mind raced with questions. How had Lucas known to be here? Why had he been watching me? But those questions could wait. Right now, the only thing that mattered was getting him proper medical care.

Lucas's gentle hum a stark contrast to the tension inside. I kept turning back to check on him, my heart clenching at his increasingly pallid complexion. Under the dim interior lights, beads of sweat glistened on his forehead, and though he tried to mask it, each bump in the road drew a subtle wince.

"Dr. Thompson is waiting at the hospital," Miles said from the passenger seat, his usually carefree tone now clipped with urgency. His fingers drummed against his phone, probably messaging various contacts.

I nodded mutely, unable to tear my eyes from Lucas. The scene kept replaying in my mind - the heavy wooden stick swinging towards me, and Lucas's sudden movement to shield me. The sickening thud as it connected with his back. The way he'd maintained his protective stance despite the impact, making sure I wasn't touched.

"I'm fine," Lucas murmured, catching my worried glance. Even now, in obvious pain, he was trying to reassure me. The irony wasn't lost on me - after a month of deliberately maintaining my distance, here I was, closer than ever, watching him suffer because of me.

The past month flickered through my thoughts. All those dinner gatherings with Milo and Stella where I'd carefully avoided his gaze, speaking only when necessary. How I'd time my exits perfectly to avoid any chance of being alone with him. Lucas had gone from attempting conversation to accepting my coldness with quiet dignity, though he never stopped bringing the children to see me.

I'd told myself he was only doing it for Milo and Stella's sake. That their attachment to me was the sole reason he maintained any contact. But now, watching him fighting waves of pain because he'd protected me without hesitation, I wasn't so sure anymore.

Two hours felt like an eternity before we finally pulled up to the private entrance of New York-Presbyterian. The medical team was already waiting with a gurney. As they helped Lucas out of the car, a muffled groan escaped him despite his obvious attempt to suppress it. My fingers curled into tight fists, nails digging into my palms.

"Miss," one of the nurses approached me with forms, but Miles smoothly intercepted.

"I'll handle the paperwork," he said, giving me a meaningful look. "Go with him."

I followed the medical team down corridors, the lights harsh after the darkness of the car. Just before they wheeled him into surgery, Lucas caught my wrist with surprising strength.

"Serena," he said softly, his grey eyes finding mine. "Don't be afraid."

The doors swung shut behind him, leaving me standing there, my wrist still tingling from his touch. It was so typically Lucas - worried about me even when he was the one heading into surgery.

The next three hours were a blur of pacing and fragmented memories. Miles handled calls and arrangements while I sat in the waiting area, my mind toggling between present anxiety and past moments. All those times over the last month when I'd caught Lucas watching me with an unreadable expression. The way he'd step back whenever I created distance, respecting my boundaries while somehow maintaining a protective presence.

When Dr. Thompson finally emerged, his expression was reassuring despite the gravity of his words. "Mr. Harrington has sustained severe back trauma, muscle damage, and a minor fracture to his right ribs. There's also some kidney contusion, but thankfully no major organ damage. He'll need two to four weeks of bed rest for proper recovery."

Relief flooded through me, followed quickly by guilt. All this because he'd protected me, even after I'd spent weeks pushing him away.

In the private room, Lucas lay still, eyes closed against the pain. The steady beep of monitors provided a rhythm to the night city lights twinkling beyond the window. Miles consulted with the medical team about post-operative care while I stood by the bed, unconsciously straightening the edges of his blanket.
###chapter 43
Serena's POV
The doctor's footsteps faded down the hallway, leaving behind a heavy silence in the private hospital room. The steady beep of the heart monitor provided an oddly comforting rhythm in the dim light.

Lucas lay there, his usually commanding presence diminished by the stark blue hospital gown. A bandage wrapped around his torso peeked out from beneath the fabric, and smaller ones dotted his arms. His jaw was clenched tight, those perfect features drawn with pain he was trying to hide. Something twisted in my chest at the sight.

"Does it hurt?" I asked softly.

His grey eyes opened, fixing on me with an intensity that made my breath catch. "Yes," he admitted simply.

The raw honesty in that single word shattered something inside me. "Why would you do something so reckless?" I demanded, anger seeping into my concern. "You could have been killed! What were you thinking, rushing in like that?"

"It would hurt more," he said, his deep voice roughened by pain, "if you had been the one getting hit."

I froze, my heart skipping a beat. The words hung in the air between us, heavy with meaning I wasn't sure I was ready to face. A question bubbled up before I could stop it: "Do you say that to everyone?"

"Only you." His gaze never wavered, steady and sure in a way that made my knees weak.

"That's..." I swallowed hard, suddenly aware of how close I was standing to his bed. "That's quite special treatment, isn't it?" As soon as the words left my mouth, I wanted to take them back. What right did I have to question his personal life? "Never mind. We should focus on your recovery. I heard you came because-"

"Because I heard you were heading to the factory," he finished, wincing slightly as he shifted position.

The reminder of the factory incident snapped me back to reality. "This was my father's doing," I said, my voice hardening. "Lawrence has been trying to force me out of StarRiver. He probably thought sending me to inspect that facility would scare me into submission." A bitter laugh escaped me. "He didn't count on you showing up."

"Let me help," Lucas offered, attempting to sit up straighter. "I have resources-"

"No." a mix of gentlness and firm in my tone. "This is my battle to fight. I'll handle my father and anyone else who thinks they can push me around." My fingers curled into the fabric of his hospital gown. "I promise you'll get your explanation, but right now, you need to rest."

My phone buzzed, and I pulled it out to see Vincent's name on the screen. "What's the status?" I answered, stepping away from the bed.

"The attacker is in custody, Ms. Sinclair. The preliminary hearing is scheduled for tomorrow morning."

"Good. Have Cassius Swift meet me there. We'll make sure he confesses." I ended the call, my stomach choosing that moment to remind me I hadn't eaten all day with a sharp pang.

"You should go," Lucas said quietly. "You haven't had dinner yet, have you?"

I turned back to him, startled. "How did you-"

"You keep touching your stomach when you think no one's watching." A faint smile played at the corners of his mouth. "Go eat something."

I hesitated, torn between the mountain of work waiting for me and the man lying injured in this hospital bed. The man who had taken a beating meant for me. "The work can wait," I found myself saying. "And I'm not particularly hungry."

His smile widened just slightly. "Liar."

"Maybe." I settled into the chair beside his bed, pulling out my phone. "But I'm staying anyway. Try to get some sleep." 

I watched Lucas's furrowed brow finally smooth out as he drifted off to sleep. The hospital room was quiet except for the soft beeping of monitors and his now-steady breathing. 

My phone vibrated in my pocket. Looking at the screen, I saw Lawrence's name and quickly silenced it. The last thing I wanted was to disturb Lucas's much-needed rest. After a moment's hesitation, I powered off the phone entirely. If he was calling about the assault incident escalating-which I suspected he was-I had no interest in being his source of information.

"Ms. Sinclair?" Miles's quiet voice drew my attention. He stood in the doorway, holding a tray. "Mr. Harrington arranged for the kitchen to prepare a special dish. He mentioned you might be hungry."

I stared at the tray, something tightening in my chest. Even in this state, he had thought to make sure I was taken care of. The gesture was so thoughtful, so... Lucas.

But I couldn't let myself be moved by these small kindnesses. People like Lucas and people like me-we came from different worlds. After everything that had happened with Ian, I couldn't risk trusting someone so completely again, no matter how genuine they seemed.

I'd been so swamped with work lately that I hadn't had a proper night's sleep in ages. As soon as I finished eating, drowsiness washed over me, and I ended up dozing off right there on the sofa.

The next thing I knew, Lucas's deep voice startled me awake.

"Sleep well?"

I jerked upright, mortified to find a blanket had been draped over me. "I... how long was I asleep?"

"About three hours." His voice held a hint of amusement.

I was supposed to be taking care of him, and instead, I'd slept more soundly than he had. As I tried to collect myself, I noticed him shifting uncomfortably.

"Do you need to use the bathroom?" The question slipped out before I could stop myself, making an already awkward situation worse.

"Yes, actually." 

"I mean..." I fumbled for words.

"I can stand," he said matter-of-factly. "Just help me up."

"The doctor said you need bed rest," I protested. "Maybe I should call a nurse-"

"You can support me. I'm not that heavy."

That wasn't the point! But before I could argue further, he was already trying to sit up. Stubborn man.

Getting him to the bathroom was a challenge. Despite his claims, Lucas was solid muscle, and I nearly stumbled under his weight as he leaned against me. Once inside, I turned to leave, but his quiet "I might fall" stopped me in my tracks.

"I'll be quick," he promised.

I turned to face the wall, hyper-aware of his warm presence at my back. The sound of... well, everything... seemed magnified in the small space. My face grew increasingly hot as seconds stretched into minutes.

So much for "quick."

"Done?" I finally asked, my voice higher than usual.

"Sorry for the wait," he said, sounding genuinely apologetic. Then added, with what I swore was a smirk in his voice, "Though they say good kidney function is a sign of health."
###chapter 44
Serena's POV


I helped Lucas back to his bed, hyper-aware of his arm around my shoulders and the warmth radiating through his thin hospital gown. The moment he settled against the pillows, an awkward silence descended. We were alone - no nurses, no orderlies, not even Miles hovering in the background.

"Would you like some fruit?" I blurted out, desperate to break the tension. Without waiting for his response, I grabbed an apple from the fruit basket on the bedside table. As I picked up the small knife, I realized I might have made a tactical error. Years of focusing on spreadsheets and corporate takeovers hadn't exactly honed my domestic skills.

The apple twisted awkwardly in my hands as I tried to maintain one continuous peel. The skin broke repeatedly, leaving a jagged mess that looked nothing like the elegant spiral my mother used to create. I could feel Lucas watching me, and when I glanced up, I caught the hint of amusement in his eyes.

"It's... distinctive," he said, his lips quirking.

I looked down at my mangled attempt. "I suppose that's one way to put it."

"I'm afraid I don't have much strength," Lucas said, his voice dropping lower. "Would you mind...?"

I shot him a skeptical look, remembering how he'd managed just fine walking to the bathroom earlier. But something in his steady gaze made me pick up a piece of apple anyway. My hand trembled slightly as I held it to his lips.

The brief touch of his mouth against my fingers sent an electric current up my arm. My heart hammered against my ribs as he took the fruit, his eyes never leaving mine.

"It's sweet," he murmured. "Would you like to taste?"

"N-no," I stammered, withdrawing my hand quickly. "I'm not really a fruit person." I practically fled to the small bathroom to wash my hands, using the moment to collect myself.

When I returned, Lucas's expression had grown serious. "Your stomach problems - they're from all the business dinners, aren't they?"

I sank into the chair beside his bed, surprised by the sudden shift in conversation. "Yes. There was a time when I thought I had to prove myself at every opportunity. All those late nights, endless drinks with clients..." I trailed off, remembering Ian's cutting words during our breakup. Too independent. Too career-focused. Too strong-willed.

"For Ian Whitmore." Lucas's voice held a note of disapproval. "He wasn't worth it."

"No," I agreed softly. "He wasn't." I straightened in my chair, feeling something settle in my chest. "From now on, I only live for myself."

A knock at the door interrupted the moment. "Sir?" Miles's respectful voice carried through the wood.

Lucas's expression flickered with something that might have been annoyance before smoothing over. "Yes?"

"Dinner has arrived."

I watched with mild amusement as he stood frozen, dinner tray in hand, waiting for Lucas's permission like a cautious deer sensing danger. Only after Lucas gave an almost imperceptible nod did Miles dare to step inside.

I observed them both, noting how even in a hospital bed, Lucas maintained that unmistakable air of authority. His presence seemed to fill the room despite his current weakened state, and I couldn't help but admire - and slightly resent - how he commanded respect without saying a word.

"Miles," I spoke up suddenly, keeping my voice deliberately casual.

"Yes, Ms. Sinclair?" He straightened immediately.

"Mr. Harrington's hands seem weak. Would you mind helping him with dinner?"

The look of sheer panic that crossed Miles' face was almost comical. His eyes darted between Lucas and me like a trapped animal seeking escape. Lucas, for his part, appeared equally taken aback, though he masked it better - just a slight tightening around his eyes betrayed his surprise.

"I... that is..." Miles stammered, looking desperately at his boss.

Lucas's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly before he gave a resigned nod. "If you insist," he said, his tone carrying just enough edge to make Miles' hands tremble as he picked up the spoon.

I hid my smile behind my own dinner, thoroughly enjoying the awkward dance playing out before me. Miles looked like he was attempting to defuse a bomb rather than feed his boss soup, and Lucas's expression of barely concealed suffering only added to my satisfaction. 

The meal proceeded in tense silence until I finished my dinner and stood to leave. That's when Lucas spoke up.

"Before you go..." His voice had lost its earlier edge, taking on an oddly vulnerable quality that made me pause. "The doctor said I can't shower, but I need help getting cleaned up. The male nurses..."

I froze, suddenly understanding where this was headed. My mind raced through the available options - both Miles and the night nurse were male, and Lucas had just cleverly eliminated them both.

"I won't be able to sleep otherwise," he added softly, and I could have sworn I saw the ghost of a smirk playing at the corners of his mouth.

I thought of the debt I owed him - the strike he'd taken for me. With a resigned sigh, I reached for a washcloth. "Close your eyes," I commanded, trying to sound clinical and detached.

His eyelids obediently dropped, but I could sense his awareness of my every movement as I began wiping his face. When I reached the buttons of his hospital gown, I hesitated.

I'd seen shirtless male models before - it was part of the fashion industry. But this felt different. As the fabric fell away, revealing his sculpted torso, I found myself having to consciously control my breathing. Even injured, his physique was impressive - all lean muscle and perfect proportions. A flush crept up my neck, and I blamed it on the room's temperature.

"Don't forget the back," he murmured, and I silently cursed his apparent mind-reading abilities.

By the time I finished, my hands were slightly shaky, though whether from exertion or something else, I refused to analyze. 

"There's one more place..." he started.

"Don't push it," I cut him off, my voice sharper than intended. "You can handle that yourself."

I changed the water and gave him a fresh cloth, deliberately avoiding his gaze. The used washcloth went straight into the trash - a fact I hoped he noticed.

"Will you come tomorrow?" he asked as I gathered my things.

I hesitated. "I'll be busy with work-"

"The pain medication makes me dizzy," he interrupted softly. "And the nights here are... lonely."

I had to bite back a laugh at his transparent manipulation. "Really? Playing the helpless card?"

A slight smile tugged at his lips, but he didn't deny it.

"I'll come if I finish work early," I conceded, already knowing I'd regret this weakness. "But no more theatrical performances about your suffering."

His smile widened just enough to confirm my suspicions about his acting skills, but he simply nodded. As I left the room, I could feel his satisfied gaze following me out.
###chapter 45
Serena's POV

As I approached the entrance of StarRiver Group, my heels clicking against the polished steps. I'd perfected the art of projecting calm authority, even when my morning was about to be disrupted by an unwelcome presence.

Nina stood by the revolving doors, affecting concern with practiced precision. Her cream-colored designer dress and perfectly styled hair screamed 'innocent younger sister' - a role she'd mastered over the years.

"Serena," she called out, her voice honey-sweet with fabricated worry. "Father's been trying to reach you all day."

I maintained my stride, not bothering to slow down. "My phone died."

"He's really worried about you." Nina fell into step beside me, her shorter legs working harder to match my pace. "You should at least call him back."

I caught the curious glances from employees entering the building. I stopped abruptly and turned to face her, my voice low but sharp. "Is he worried about me, or worried about himself?"

The flash of uncertainty in her eyes confirmed my suspicion. She was Lawrence's messenger, sent to gauge my stance on the factory situation.

"I don't understand why you're being like this," she said, her lower lip trembling slightly. "We're family."

"Family." I let the word hang between us, heavy with unspoken accusations. "If that's all, I have a company to run."

I left her standing there, knowing the dismissal would sting more than any words I could have chosen. The security guard nodded respectfully as I passed, and I felt Nina's gaze boring into my back until the elevator doors closed between us.

My office provided a momentary sanctuary. I inhaled the familiar scent of fresh coffee that Vincent had already placed on my desk. When my phone rang, I allowed myself a small, bitter smile. Right on schedule.

"Serena." Lawrence's voice carried that particular tone of authority he reserved for when he felt his control slipping. "You know how serious the factory situation is. Why aren't you answering my calls?"

I spun my chair to face the window, watching a cloud pass over the sun. "Is this a command performance? Should I bow before answering the royal summons?"

"This isn't a joke." His frustration crackled through the line. "Do you realize what could happen if this goes to court?"

"Perfectly." I traced the rim of my coffee cup with one finger. "The police have evidence of systematic safety violations. The prosecution has witnesses."

The silence that followed told me he hadn't expected me to be so well-informed. I pressed my advantage.

"I have three conditions," I said, my voice cool and professional. "Accept them, and I'll ensure this stays out of court."

"You're in no position to make demands."

"First," I continued as if he hadn't spoken, "full compensation for Lucas Harrington's medical expenses and damages. Second, a formal apology from those responsible, with a written guarantee against future disruptions. Third," I paused for effect, "Leon Hendrix and Arthur Burton resign immediately. Production operations transfer to my direct oversight."

The sharp intake of breath on the other end was deeply satisfying. "You can't-"

"Those are my terms. The hearing starts in two hours." I glanced at my watch. "I need your answer in the next thirty minutes, or we proceed as scheduled."

"Serena-"

I ended the call with a decisive tap, setting my phone face-down on the desk.
The intercom buzzed softly. "Ms. Sinclair? The legal team is ready for your briefing."

"Thank you, Vincent. I'll be there in five minutes."


Nina's POV

I tapped my perfectly manicured nails against the steering wheel as I pulled into the hospital parking lot. The bouquet of pink carnations lay carefully arranged on my passenger seat, their delicate petals a perfect match for my deliberately chosen outfit. Earlier, I had called Father about my plan to visit Lucas Harrington.

I checked my reflection in the rearview mirror one last time. The soft pink blouse complemented my complexion perfectly, and my makeup struck just the right balance between natural and alluring. I had learned exactly how to present myself during my time with Ian - a skill that had served me well. If I could win over someone as proper as Ian Whitmore, surely Lucas Harrington wouldn't be immune to my charms.

The private wing of the hospital screamed luxury, all granite floors and hushed voices. I found his room easily enough - the largest VIP suite on the floor. Taking a deep breath, I adjusted my expression into one of gentle concern before knocking softly.

The sight of him nearly took my breath away. Even lying in a hospital bed, Lucas Harrington commanded presence. His sharp features and those piercing grey eyes made my heart skip a beat. This was going to be more enjoyable than I'd anticipated.

"Mr. Harrington?" I stepped in with my most graceful walk. "I'm Nina Sinclair. I brought these for you."

His gaze flickered to the flowers, then back to me with such disinterest that I felt my first twinge of uncertainty. "Serena's sister," I added quickly, letting my smile turn shy.

"Half-sister," he corrected coldly. "Same father, different mothers."

I felt my smile strain but kept it firmly in place. "Yes, well... I wanted to come check on you. Serena's been so worried, but she's been swamped with work..." I moved to place the flowers on his bedside table.

"Worried?" His voice sharp. "The same way you were worried about her when you pursued her fiancé?"

I froze, my fingers still wrapped around the flower stems. "That's... Ian and I... it wasn't like that." My voice wavered exactly the way I wanted it to. "We fell in love naturally. These things happen..."

"Save it." The two words sliced through my explanation like a knife. "I'm not interested in your version of events. Or in anything else you have to say."

Heat crept up my neck, but I forced myself to stay composed. This was just a minor setback. Men like Lucas Harrington enjoyed the chase - I just needed to adjust my strategy. After all, I had won Ian over despite his initial devotion to Serena. This would be no different.

The sound of the door opening made me turn, and there she was. Serena looked annoyingly put-together in her designer suit.

"I was just leaving," I said softly, gathering my dignity around me like a shield. I had almost reached the door when Lucas's voice stopped me.

Serena and I locked eyes, and I couldn't help the small smirk that tugged at my lips. Poor Serena, always showing up at the worst moments.

"Miss Sinclair."

My heart leaped. I turned back, letting hope and vulnerability show in my expression - a look that had never failed to work on men before.

"Yes?"

His eyes met mine, cold and sharp as winter frost. "I should mention something. I have a severe allergy."

I blinked, glancing at the carnations still in my hands. "Oh! I'm so sorry about the flowers-"

"Not to the flowers." His voice was precise, cutting. "To you. Please don't show up here again."

The words hit like a physical blow. I stood there, frozen, as humiliation burned through my veins. Through the roaring in my ears, I heard Serena's small intake of breath. The flowers trembled in my grip as I forced myself to walk - not run - to the door.

Only when I was safely in my car did I let the tears fall, hot and angry down my cheeks. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot. Serena might have won this round, but I had learned from my experiment with Ian. I knew how to play the long game.
###chapter 46
Serena's POV

As I watched Nina's retreating figure. She clutched a bouquet of pink carnations, their pristine petals a stark contrast to her reddened eyes. Her shoulders trembled slightly as she walked away, each step echoing against the sterile floor.

My mind drifted back to our college days. Nina had always been the center of attention, surrounded by admiring faces. She'd perfected that wide-eyed innocent look, coupled with a delicate laugh that drew people in like moths to a flame. I'd watched from the sidelines as she worked her magic, wrapping everyone around her little finger with practiced ease.

Even Ian had fallen for it. I remembered the day I first noticed him looking at her differently during a gala. The way his gaze followed her across the room, how he'd smiled at her vapid small talk.

But Lucas... Lucas was different.

Taking a deep breath, I pushed open the door to his hospital room. The antiseptic smell hit me immediately, mingling with the faint scent of fresh flowers from the various bouquets dotting the room. Lucas lay propped up against white pillows, his usual commanding presence somehow undiminished by the hospital gown and setting.

"I meant what I said yesterday," I began, meeting his steady gaze. "About not letting you take a loss in this."

He raised an eyebrow but remained silent, waiting.

"The situation at StarRiver is... complicated right now." I kept my voice even. "My father still maintains significant control. I need time to handle certain elements, but in the meantime-" I reached for my checkbook.

"Money?" His voice was low, almost amused.

"I know you don't need it," I said quickly, fingers tightening on the leather cover. "But it's all I can offer at the moment to-"

"No," he interrupted, his grey eyes holding mine. "There's much more you could do."

Something in his tone made my heart skip a beat. The afternoon light caught his profile, softening his usually sharp features. For a moment, neither of us spoke.

"Like taking care of me," he finally said, his voice gentler than I'd ever heard it, "until I'm discharged."

I was a little surprised. He looked at the expression on my face with a playful note in his voice and said, "What's the matter-are you disappointed?"

I found myself momentarily captivated by his attracting smile, realizing he wasn't trying to make things difficult for me at all.

If things had been different... if I hadn't learned the hard way about trust and betrayal... maybe I could have let myself feel what was building between us. Maybe I could have acknowledged the way my pulse quickened when he looked at me, or how his smiles seemed to illuminate something long dormant in my chest.

But I couldn't. Not again. Not even for him.

I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil beneath. "It's the least I can do, given the circumstances."

I busied myself adjusting his water pitcher, straightening items on his bedside table-anything to avoid meeting his gaze. My fingers brushed against the cool surface of a glass, and I focused on that sensation, using it to anchor myself against the dangerous undercurrent of emotions threatening to pull me under.

The afternoon sun filtered through the curtains of the room, casting a warm glow across my laptop screen. I was deep in quarterly reports and acquisition proposals, my fingers moving rapidly across the keyboard. The steady rhythm of typing occasionally mixed with the soft rustle of papers from Lucas's direction, creating an oddly comfortable atmosphere.

I barely registered the sound of footsteps approaching until Miles's voice broke through my concentration.

"Boss... are you peeling apples?"

I glanced up from my screen. Miles stood in the doorway, documents in hand, his usually composed expression replaced by undisguised surprise. Lucas sat in his hospital bed, methodically cutting an apple into neat, uniform pieces.

"Is there something wrong with that?" Lucas's voice carried its usual quiet authority, though I detected a hint of amusement.

"No, sir, of course not. I just... I'll come back later with these reports." Miles retreated, but not before shooting me a meaningful look that I pretended not to notice.

I returned to my work, falling back into the familiar pattern of numbers and projections. Time passed in the comfortable silence until my hand, operating on autopilot, reached for something beside my laptop. The sweet crunch of apple registered before I fully processed what I was eating.

I froze mid-chew, suddenly aware of the nearly empty plate beside me. What remained were two small, perfectly cut pieces, each with a toothpick placed exactly in the center. The knife work was impeccable - uniform thickness, even the skin trimmed to leave just a hint of red.

"I'm sorry," I said, heat creeping into my cheeks. "I wasn't paying attention. I don't usually even like fruit that much..."

"I'm honored you enjoyed them." Lucas's voice was soft, making my embarrassment worse. "Though I notice you left the smallest pieces for last."

I stared at the remaining apple slices, searching for a response that wouldn't sound completely ridiculous. "I was distracted by work."

"You've been distracted a lot lately." His tone shifted slightly. "Particularly since my last business trip."

My fingers stilled on the keyboard. I'd wondered if he'd noticed - of course he had. Lucas noticed everything. I kept my eyes fixed on the screen, though the words had become meaningless shapes.

"I just think we need some boundaries," I said carefully. "Professional ones."

"Professional boundaries." He repeated the words slowly, as if tasting them. "Is that why you've been avoiding being alone with me?"

"I don't really believe in love anymore," I offered, the words feeling hollow even as they left my mouth. "It's better to keep things..."

I said finally, grasping at the easier explanation. Anything was better than admitting the truth - that seeing him with Eleanor had awakened something I wasn't ready to face, that the prospect of letting him closer terrified me more than any boardroom battle ever could.

His eyebrow arched slightly. "That's not an answer, Serena. That's an excuse."

"Are you wavering about my pursuit?" His grey eyes held mine, searching. "I've noticed how you tense when I get too close, how you find reasons to leave rooms I enter."

"I just think..." I paused, gathering my thoughts. "We could be friends. I could even be Milo and Stella's godmother. That would be-"

"No." The word fell between us like a stone. "That's not an option, Serena."

"I don't understand why not. It's a perfectly reasonable-"

"You have two choices," he cut in, his voice dropping to that low register that never failed to send a shiver down my spine. "You can be Milo and Stella's mother, or you can be my wife."

I blinked. "Isn't that... the same thing?"

A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "Exactly. You don't get to choose just one part of this, Serena. It's all or nothing."

"You'll regret this," I warned, though my voice lacked conviction.

"I've already had my share of regrets." He shifted in the bed, then said slightly. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to use the bathroom."

The conversation ended abruptly as he carefully maneuvered himself out of bed. 

I only left the hospital after Lucas had fallen asleep.
In the dead of night, I received a call from Lawrence. He informed me that Leon Hendrix and Arthur Burton would submit their resignations tomorrow. He also said he would personally accompany the perpetrator to visit Lucas in the hospital to apologize and offer compensation.
The next morning, I received resignation letters from both men.
Lucas then messaged me, saying my father had visited the hospital and compensated him with a substantial amount.
Sitting in my office, I dialed the internal line. "Vincent, please ask Nina Sinclair to come. Also, there will be a meeting in half an hour - no one is to be late!"
###chapter 47
Nina's POV
As I made my way to my office, my chin held high despite yesterday's humiliation at Lucas's doorstep. That's my superpower, really-the ability to bounce back from anything. While others might still be nursing their wounds, I was already planning my next move.
My phone buzzed. Vincent's message was characteristically terse: "Ms. Sinclair wants to see you immediately."
My steps faltered for just a moment. Had Serena finally decided to confront me about yesterday? I touched up my lipstick in the elevator's reflection, adjusting my expression into one of innocent concern. 
The executive floor was eerily quiet when I arrived. Vincent barely glanced up from his computer as he buzzed me in.
Serena sat behind her massive desk. She was reviewing documents, her reading glasses perched on her nose, and didn't immediately acknowledge my presence.
"Sit," she said finally, not looking up.
I perched on one of the leather chairs, my hands clasped demurely in my lap. The silence stretched between us like a rubber band about to snap. My mind raced through possible scenarios-a reprimand, a demotion, maybe even a threat about Lucas.
"I just received resignation letters from Leon Hendrix and Arthur Burton," Serena said suddenly, removing her glasses. "I approved them."
My heart skipped a beat. Those were Father's most loyal people in the company, positioned strategically in our production division. What game was she playing?
"The fall collection's production management is now unmanned," she continued, her voice neutral. "I've decided to put you in charge of it."
I kept my face carefully composed, but my mind was whirling. This made no sense. Why go through all the trouble of forcing out Leon and Arthur-only to hand their power to me? I was just as much Father's ally as they were. More so, even. The end result would be exactly the same.
"The entire production line?" I asked, my voice carefully modulated to show just the right amount of surprise and gratitude.
"Full authority," she confirmed, sliding a folder across the desk. "You'll start tomorrow. The team needs direction for the next quarter's planning."
I picked up the folder. "We're family," I said softly, letting my voice warm with emotion. "Of course I'll help shoulder the burden for you and StarRiver."
Serena's face remained impassive. I stood slowly, clutching the folder to my chest. "Thank you for trusting me with this, Sister."
She had already returned to her work, dismissing me without a word. I walked to the door, deliberately taking my time, waiting for her to mention yesterday's incident. But she remained silent, the only sound the soft rustle of papers as she turned a page.
As the door closed behind me, a small smile played at the corners of my mouth. Oh, Serena. Maybe she was afraid of antagonizing me. With Leon and Arthur gone, she needed someone to handle the production line-someone who knew the business and could keep things running. 
She was truly so distracted by Lucas that she'd made a tactical error. The Serena I knew would never be so careless, but love had a way of making people stupid. I'd seen it happen countless times.




Serena's POV
The murmur of voices filled the boardroom as I took my seat at the head of the table. I could hear fragments of conversations, none of them particularly respectful - just as I'd expected.
I placed my tablet on the polished mahogany table and cleared my throat. The conversations continued. I didn't raise my voice or make any aggressive moves to demand their attention. Instead, I began speaking in my normal tone, knowing the weight of my words would do the work for me.

"I've approved the resignations of Leon Hendrix and Arthur Burton, effective immediately."

The effect was instantaneous. The room fell silent, all eyes snapping to me. Leon had been with production for over a decade, and Arthur was one of the most experienced project managers.

"Nina will be taking over Production," I continued, watching their reactions carefully. "She's shown remarkable initiative lately, and I believe this will be an excellent opportunity for her to prove herself."

I could see the shock rippling through the room. They were puzzled why I made this decision - by putting Nina in charge of Production. I kept my expression neutral as I watched Cole Anderson exchange a pointed look with person beside him.

"I'd like to thank my sister for her support," I added, injecting warmth into my voice that didn't reach my eyes. "Nina has been invaluable these past few months."

The silence that followed was deafening. Not a single person moved to applaud. Even Nina, seated three chairs down on my right, remained still, her perfect smile frozen in place.

"Moving on to our next item," I continued smoothly, "we'll be implementing several organizational changes effective next week." I paused, letting the tension build. "Cole Anderson will be transitioning to Assistant Manager in Operations."

Cole's chair scraped against the floor as he stood up abruptly. "This is ridiculous! I've been HR Director for fifteen years. You can't just-"

"I can, and I am," I cut him off, my voice level but carrying an edge of steel. "Your experience is precisely why we're offering you this opportunity rather than immediate termination. The choice is yours."

His face had turned an interesting shade of red. "This is because I supported your father's position on the Paris project, isn't it? You're punishing anyone who doesn't bow to your every whim!"

I let his words hang in the air for a moment, then responded with ice in my tone. "Your performance review is in the folder in front of you. Your decisions regarding staff allocation have cost us nearly two million in the last quarter alone. The numbers speak for themselves."

Cole grabbed his folder and stormed toward the door. "You'll be hearing from my lawyer!"

"Everett," I addressed our legal counsel without missing a beat, "please ensure Mr. Anderson receives a copy of his contract section regarding performance-based reassignment. Page thirty-seven, I believe."

As the door slammed behind Cole, I continued the meeting as if nothing had happened. "For those remaining, you have until end of day Friday to accept your new positions or submit your resignations. Everett will be available to discuss the terms with each of you individually."

I gathered my things unhurriedly, noting how no one quite dared to meet my eyes. "Nina, congratulations again on your new role. I'm looking forward to seeing what you do with Production."
She managed a tight smile. "Thank you, Serena. I won't let you down."
As I walked out of the boardroom, I could feel the tension crackling in the air behind me.
###chapter 48
Nina's POV

The angry voices reached me before the footsteps did. I was just wrapping up some emails when my office door burst open, flooding the room with furious employees. The sight of their faces - twisted with anger and betrayal - made my stomach drop.

"Miss Sinclair, what's the meaning of this?" someone shouted from the back. Others quickly joined in, their voices overlapping in a cacophony of accusations. I gripped the edge of my desk, trying to maintain my composure while my mind raced to make sense of what was happening.

"Everyone, please," I raised my hands, fighting to keep my voice steady. "Please Calm down."

Ava, from markrting, stepped forward, her tablet thrust out like a weapon. "Don't pretend you don't know. The mass position transfers? The department restructuring? Your sister is using the guise of transfers to force everyone to resign !"
"There must be some misunderstanding," I said carefully, reaching for my phone. "Let me contact Serena-"
"She's gone," April cut in sharply. "Left the building right after making the announcements. And conveniently left you to deal with the fallout."

The realization hit me like a physical blow. Of course she had. My dear sister had played her hand perfectly, hadn't she? I remembered all those private meetings she'd insisted on having with me over the past few weeks, making sure others saw us together, creating the impression we were working closely on company decisions.

I was still processing this when Cole Anderson stormed in, his face red with fury. The HR director slammed his phone onto my desk with enough force to make me flinch.

"Explain this," he demanded, pointing to an email on his screen. "Why am I being removed from my position without cause?"

"Mr. Anderson, please calm down-" I started, but he cut me off with a harsh laugh.

"Calm down? After you and your sister orchestrated this whole thing?" He leaned forward, palms flat on my desk. "The secret meetings, the sudden promotions, pushing out Leon and Arthur - it was all planned, wasn't it?"

My hand trembled as I reached for my own phone, but Cole snatched it away before I could grab it. "No more calls. No more lies. I want answers."

That's when everything clicked into place. The production department leadership role she'd pushed me into. The design credit she'd insisted on giving me for StarRiver's new line. Father firing Leon and Arthur under her threat. Each piece had been carefully positioned, and I'd been too blind to see the pattern until now.

"This is your family's doing," Cole's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "And if I don't get my position back, I'll make sure everyone knows exactly what kind of people you all are. Even if we all go down together."

After he stormed out, I sat alone in my office, fury building like a pressure cooker in my chest. All my life, I'd been the one in control, the one who kept Serena in her place. Now she'd outmaneuvered me so completely that I hardly recognized what had happened until it was too late.

I stared at my reflection in the darkened window, watching my perfectly composed expression crack at the edges. A cold smile spread across my face as I began to plan. My sister had always underestimated me. It was time to remind her exactly who she was dealing with.


Serena's POV

The office clock read 10:37 PM. I stared at the production reports scattered across my desk, the numbers starting to blur together. Three days. It had been three days since I last visited Lucas at the hospital, and the guilt was eating away at me.

Though appointing Nina as supervisor was part of my plan, I couldn't afford to let my guard down. Each day, I meticulously reviewed progress reports and made frequent visits to the factory floor. Corporate warfare was like chess - one wrong move could cost everything.

My phone screen lit up. My finger hovered over Lucas's contact, deleting and retyping the message several times before finally sending: "Are you asleep?"

The response came almost instantly: "No. Waiting for you."

I could picture his expression - that subtle upturn of his lips, barely noticeable unless you knew where to look. My own lips curved into a small smile before I caught myself.

"You should rest early," I typed back, trying to maintain some semblance of propriety.

"Then come put me to bed?" His reply made my heart skip a beat.

After a moment's hesitation, I called my driver. "Ethan, could you take me to  Hospital?"

"At this hour, Miss Sinclair?" Ethan's surprise was evident.

"Yes. I need to check on someone." The formality in my voice had softened, and I noticed Ethan hiding a knowing smile.

I pushed open the door to Lucas's room as gently as possible, not wanting to wake him if he'd fallen asleep.

The bed was empty.

The sound of running water came from the bathroom, and before I could retreat, the door opened. Lucas stood there, water droplets trailing down his bare chest, a white towel precariously low on his hips. Despite myself, my eyes traced the defined lines of his muscles, the way his wet hair fell effortlessly across his forehead, the droplets sliding down his sculpted abdomen. 

His piercing grey eyes met mine, smoldering with a mix of surprise and something more intense. As he moved, the towel shifted slightly, each motion graceful yet undeniably masculine. The faint scent of his aftershave lingered in the air, heightening the magnetic pull between us. 

In that moment, every detail of Lucas-from the way his broad shoulders relaxed to the enticing glimpse of his toned arms-made it impossible to look away.

"Like what you see, Miss Sinclair?" His voice held that familiar mix of amusement and heat that made my pulse race.

I spun around quickly, my face burning. "You... you should put some clothes on!" The words came out more breathless than commanding.

"I would," he said, his voice closer now, "but you're standing in front of my closet."

I could feel the warmth radiating from his body, smell the fresh scent of his shower gel. My heart was pounding so loud I was sure he could hear it.

"I'll... I'll wait outside," I managed to say, my usual composure completely shattered.
###chapter 49
Serena's POV

My smile froze when I spotted his feet. He was wearing those slick hospital slippers, practically skating across the wet floor. Before I could call out a warning, it happened - his foot slipped on the surface.

I moved without thinking. Basic physics would have told me that my slight frame wouldn't do much to stop his fall. Yet there I was, lunging forward to catch him.

We went down together, but even in his unstable state, Lucas managed to curl his body protectively around mine. His hand cradled the back of my head, preventing it from hitting the floor. The impact knocked the breath from my lungs, leaving me acutely aware of his weight pressing against me.

"Are you alright?" His low voice rumbled close to my ear, sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.

"Lucas, I can't breathe," I managed to wheeze out, trying to ignore the burning in my cheeks. He shifted immediately, but in the process, the towel around his waist came loose.

The sight triggered something deep within me. Suddenly, I wasn't in the hospital room anymore. I was eighteen again, trapped in that nightmare of powerlessness and violation. My stomach lurched violently.

I scrambled to my feet and barely made it to the bathroom before emptying my stomach contents. Through the roaring in my ears, I heard his concerned voice calling my name, felt his presence hovering uncertainly at the doorway.

"It's not you," I gasped out between heaves, desperate to erase the hurt I'd glimpsed in his eyes. "I just... remembered something unpleasant from the past."

When I finally emerged, he had properly dressed and was standing by the window, his expression carefully neutral. The tension in his shoulders eased slightly at my appearance.

"Your arm," I said quickly, grasping for a change of subject. "The fall didn't aggravate your injury, did it?"

"No." His response was soft, measured. A pause, then: "I'm being discharged in three days."

I nodded, already backing toward the door. "I'll come pick you up." The hospital room suddenly felt too small, too intimate. "I should go. StarRiver has been keeping me busy lately."

"I know." His voice stopped me at the threshold. "Thank you for coming today, Serena."

"Lucas... could you move? It's getting hard to breathe," I managed to say, trying to keep my voice steady despite the rising panic in my chest. The weight of his body against mine was triggering memories I'd rather forget.

He immediately tried to push himself up, but in doing so, the towel around his waist slipped. My eyes widened before I could look away, and suddenly the room felt too small, too warm. Memories I'd suppressed for years came rushing back - that horrible night when I was eighteen, trapped, helpless...

I barely made it to the bathroom before retching violently. The cool porcelain of the toilet bowl against my forehead provided little comfort as waves of nausea rolled through me. Behind me, I could hear Lucas's concerned voice calling my name.

When I finally emerged, his face was tight with worry. "I'm so sorry," I said quickly, hating how shaky my voice sounded. "It's not... it's not because of you. There are just some memories..."

"I understand," he cut me off gently, now properly covered and keeping a careful distance. The concern in his eyes made my chest ache. "You don't need to explain."

I desperately searched for a way to change the subject. "Your arm - did you hurt it just now?"

"No," he replied simply.

"Good. I should probably head home," I said, glancing at my watch. "Things are pretty hectic at StarRiver right now."

"I'm being discharged in three days," he mentioned casually.

"Already? Hasn't it been less than two weeks? Did the doctor approve?"

"You'll come pick me up?" There was something expectation in his question.

"Of course. I already told Miles about it. Didn't he mention it?"

"Just making sure," he said with studied nonchalance. "You haven't exactly been consistent about visiting."

I pressed my lips together, unable to argue. He was right - I hadn't kept my promise to visit every day.

"Get some rest," he said, surprising me by being the one to suggest I leave. He understood how busy things were for me right now.

"Goodnight then," I said quickly, already heading for the door.

At StarRiver's photography studio. I ran my fingers over the fabric of the signature piece - a navy blue blazer with subtle geometric patterns that I'd designed specifically for Eleanor. This was my first major project since joining StarRiver, and I couldn't help but feel both excited and anxious.

The sound of cheerful laughter broke through my thoughts. Eleanor had arrived, dressed casually in jeans and a white t-shirt, her hair pulled back in a messy bun. She greeted everyone with genuine warmth - quite different from the polished celebrity image I'd expected.

"Good morning, Serena!" she called out, making her way directly to me. "I hope you're ready to make me look fabulous today."

"The clothes are all prepared," I replied professionally, gesturing toward the rack. "Would you like to try on the first outfit?"

Eleanor's eyes lit up as she examined the blazer. Without waiting for her stylist, she slipped it on and walked to the full-length mirror. The tailoring accentuated her figure perfectly, just as I'd envisioned.

"Oh my God," she exclaimed, turning to examine different angles. "This is hands down the best casual wear I've ever worn. Where's the designer? They deserve a bonus!"

I felt my cheeks warm slightly. "I'm glad you like it. I designed it myself."

She whirled around, eyes wide. "You? You're not just the coordinator?" A grin spread across her face. "Well, if this collection doesn't blow up, it's definitely my fault, not the clothes. These are perfect."

Her candid praise eased some of my anxiety about the launch. I'd always believed in my designs, but market reception was unpredictable. As I helped her with the other pieces, I found myself wondering about her relationship with Lucas.

The shoot progressed faster than anyone expected. Eleanor moved through poses with practiced ease, taking direction well and even suggesting angles that might better showcase the clothes. What I'd scheduled as a full day's work was completed three hours early.

"That's a wrap!" the photographer announced, reviewing the final shots with satisfaction.

As the crew began packing up, Eleanor approached me, still wearing the blazer. "Hey, are you free tonight? I actually got the evening off from my drama shoot. Want to grab dinner?"

I hesitated, surprised by the invitation. "Don't you need to rest?"

"Nah," she waved off my concern. "Having drinks with you seems fun. Do you like Nordic cuisine? There's this place called Aurora I've been wanting to try."

Looking at her earnest expression, I found myself nodding. "Aurora sounds perfect."

"Great!" She beamed. "You know, Serena, you're different from what I expected. In a good way."

As I watched her head to the changing room, I realized she was different from what I'd expected too. Behind the glamorous public image was someone refreshingly genuine - a "lovable goofball," as the entertainment blogs called her. Maybe that's why she and Lucas...

I stopped that train of thought. Tonight was about getting to know a potential friend, not analyzing her connection to Lucas Harrington.
###chapter 50
Serena's POV


The soft lighting of Aurora's private dining room cast elegant shadows across our table as I watched Eleanor Yates take another generous bite of her wagyu steak. Her complete disregard for the typical celebrity's dining etiquette was... refreshing. No carefully measured bites, no strategic pushing of food around the plate - just pure, unapologetic enjoyment.

"You know," Eleanor said between bites, dabbing her lips with a napkin, "I have to admit something. I completely misjudged you at first."

I raised an eyebrow, taking a small sip of my wine. "Oh?"

"Yeah. I thought you were just another trust fund princess, the kind who clings to powerful men." She gestured with her fork, completely unapologetic. "But you're actually quite interesting. And gorgeous, I'll give you that."

The corner of my mouth twitched. "Let me guess - Ian Whitmore helped form that impression?"

Eleanor rolled her eyes. "That man has a talent for taking credit for other people's work, doesn't he?"

The words hit closer to home than I expected. Memories surfaced of late nights spent refining business proposals, strategizing market entries, all while Ian smiled for the cameras and accepted the accolades. At the time, I'd told myself it didn't matter who got the credit as long as we succeeded together.

How naive I'd been.

"It's funny," I said, swirling the wine in my glass. "Back then, I never thought to count how many of those successful ventures were actually my ideas."

Eleanor leaned forward, her expression suddenly serious. "Is that why you broke up? The credit-stealing?"

"No." I placed my glass down carefully. "He fell for my stepsister, Nina."

"That little devious pretender?" Eleanor snorted inelegantly, making me laugh despite myself. "Men can be so blind sometimes. No offense, but your ex has the emotional intelligence of a teaspoon."

Before I could respond, my phone buzzed. Vincent's name flashed on the screen.

"I have to take this," I apologized, standing. "It's about your ad campaign."

The next few minutes were spent in efficient discussion of promotional materials and release timing. When I returned, Eleanor had ordered a bottle of white wine.

"I hope you're planning to share that," I said, settling back into my seat.

"Obviously." She filled both our glasses with practiced ease. "We're celebrating our mutual good taste in moving on from toxic people."

Two bottles later, Eleanor's cheeks were flushed, and her usual sharp wit had softened into something more vulnerable. When I suggested calling her a car, she shook her head vigorously.

"No, no. I want to see your place." She leaned in conspiratorially, her voice dropping to a whisper. "We're going to be family soon anyway."

I froze. If I didn't know about her connection to Lucas, I might have interpreted that statement very differently. The thought made me bite back a smile.

"You're drunk," I said gently.

"Maybe." She grinned, unrepentant. "But I'm also right."

I'd always kept people at arm's length, especially after that scandal at eighteen. The isolation during my years abroad had only reinforced that habit, perhaps making me more susceptible to Ian's attention when he came along.

But sitting here with Eleanor, her guard completely down, I felt something I hadn't in a long time - the potential for genuine friendship. It was both terrifying and strangely comforting.

"Come on," I said, standing and offering her my arm. "Let's get you home before you say something else that makes both of us blush."

Her laughter echoed through the restaurant as we made our way out, drawing curious glances.

I gently closed my bedroom door, careful not to wake Eleanor. She had fallen asleep in the car, and since I couldn't get her address out of her, bringing her to my place seemed like the only option. Looking at her peaceful face against my pillow, I felt an unexpected surge of protectiveness. 

The sight was oddly comforting - Eleanor Yates, the rising star who usually maintained such careful composure, now completely vulnerable in sleep. Dark lashes rested against her cheeks, her breathing deep and even. I adjusted the comforter, tucking it around her shoulders before placing a glass of honey water on the nightstand.

After a quick shower, I noticed my phone's screen repeatedly lighting up with incoming calls. Wrapping myself in a robe, I stepped onto the balcony, letting the cool night air settle around me. When Ian's name flashed across the screen again, I took a deep breath and answered.

"Signing Eleanor Yates as StarRiver's spokesperson?" His voice dripped with contempt. "You never cease to amaze me, Serena."

"Is there a point to this midnight call, Ian?" I kept my voice level, though my fingers tightened around the phone.

He laughed, the sound harsh and bitter. "Don't play innocent. You know exactly what you're doing. First Lucas Harrington, now Eleanor? Quite the cozy arrangement you're building there."

"I don't follow."

"Oh, please. You have already known about Eleanor and Lucas's little affair. Two women serving one man - how progressive of you, Serena. You've certainly come a long way from that naive eighteen-year-old girl."

The old wound he referenced stung, but I refused to let it show. "Fascinating theory, Ian. Though I'm more interested in hearing about you and Nina. How long has that been going on?"

His sharp intake of breath told me I'd hit my mark. "That's none of your business."

"Neither are my company's contracts. But since we're sharing opinions - how many times did Whitmore try to sign Eleanor? Three? Four? It must be frustrating, watching StarRiver succeed where you failed."

"Failed?" He spat the word. "StarRiver is nothing compared to Whitmore. You're playing in the big leagues now, Serena, and you're not ready."

"We'll see about that." I ended the call before he could respond.
###chapter 51
Serena's POV

When I returned to my bedroom, Eleanor was already sitting up against the headboard, looking somewhat disoriented but more alert than before. The warm glow from my bedside lamp cast gentle shadows across her face, highlighting the slight fatigue in her features despite her attempt to appear composed.

"How are you feeling?" I asked, keeping my voice soft.

She gave me a wan smile. "Better. Your bed smells nice." The directness of her comment caught me off guard, but I maintained a polite smile. It was refreshing to encounter someone so straightforward in our usually guarded social circles.

"Would you like some honey water? Or I could prepare a hot bath if you prefer. Or I could call my driver to take you home," I offered, giving her options while carefully observing her reaction.

"No, I'd rather stay here tonight, if that's okay." Eleanor pulled her knees up to her chest.

"Of course. Would you like some coffee? I was about to make some for myself."

Her eyes lit up slightly. "Black coffee at this hour? You're braver than you look, Serena."

In the kitchen, I found myself automatically reaching for the sugar bowl. "Do you want sugar with-"

"No sugar," she said. I gave her a suprise look.
 
"You too?" Eleanor raised an eyebrow, a genuine smile playing at her lips.

I nodded, pouring the steaming coffee into two mugs. This small shared preference somehow made the late-night atmosphere more comfortable between us.

We settled on the couch, and I turned on the TV, keeping the volume low. By coincidence - or perhaps fate's sense of humor - one of Eleanor's reality shows was playing. She was on screen, radiant and commanding, teaching aspiring actresses about camera presence.

"Well, well," Eleanor smirked, glancing at me sideways. "Looks like I've found a faithful fan."

I chose not to correct her assumption about my viewing habits. I watched her from the corner of my eye as she observed her on-screen self with an expression I couldn't quite read.

The peaceful moment was interrupted by her phone's sudden buzz. Eleanor's body tensed almost imperceptibly as she glanced at the screen. She let it ring until it went silent.

Minutes later, my phone lit up. Jace's name flashed on the screen.

"She's not answering her phone," his voice came through, tense with poorly concealed concern. "Could you pass along a message? Tomorrow's shoot is crucial - tell her not to be late."

"She's actually staying at my place tonight," I replied evenly, noting how his tone shifted from anxiety to relief, then to a forced casualness.

"Oh. Good. That's... good. Just make sure she gets the message about tomorrow."

"Okay," I replied, though something still felt odd about the situation. What kind of scene could be so important that it needed a midnight reminder?

I distinctly noticed that when Jace Gillard called earlier, there was an urgency in his voice. Yet by the end of the call, his tone had become oddly casual.

"I won't keep you up any longer. Good night."

"Good night." When I relayed his words to Eleanor, her expression darkened momentarily before she masked it with a look of indifference. 

"Are things... not good between you and Jace Gillard?" I asked carefully.

"No, everything's fine," Eleanor replied offhandedly.

But something definitely felt off about their dynamic. Why wouldn't Eleanor take the director's calls? Usually, you wouldn't ignore a director's phone call.

Perhaps Eleanor's status gave her that leverage? After all, I'd heard this was only an A-level production, not S-level, and Eleanor's current market value and position meant she could easily book S-level projects.

But that didn't fit - Eleanor never struck me as the type to pull rank.

"I'm tired," Eleanor announced suddenly, punctuating her words with a yawn that seemed only partially theatrical. "I think I'll go to sleep now."

"Of course," I nodded, gathering our empty coffee cups. 

I finished plating a simple but nutritious breakfast. I'd even made an extra portion, anticipating she might be hungry after last night's feast.

The sound of shuffling feet announced Eleanor's arrival. She emerged from the guest room looking decidedly less polished than her usual camera-ready self, hair slightly mussed and eyes still heavy with sleep.

"Breakfast is ready," I said, gesturing to the spread of scrambled eggs, whole grain toast, and fresh fruit I'd arranged. "Nothing fancy, but it'll get you through the morning."

Eleanor wrinkled her nose, waving off my offer with a lazy hand. "Thanks, but I'm starting a diet today."

I raised an eyebrow, recalling how she'd devoured plate after plate of marinated beef last night. "That's not what you were saying when you were on your fourth serving of venison."

"Exactly!" She dropped dramatically into a chair, somehow making even that look graceful. "I went completely overboard last night, which means today is definitely diet day."

"Skipping breakfast isn't the best way to start a diet," I pointed out, unable to completely suppress my mothering instinct. "It's terrible for your metabolism."

"Don't worry about me." Eleanor pulled out her phone, fingers flying across the screen. "My assistant is bringing a boiled egg white and non-fat milk. I'll eat in the car."

She glanced at the time and straightened slightly. "Jace was super clear about not being late today. I can't afford to get on his bad side."

I bit back a smile, thinking of how she'd deliberately ignored the director's calls just hours ago.

"Oh, right," she said suddenly, looking up from her phone with unexpected sincerity. "Thanks for last night. When you get married, I'm giving you something amazing as a wedding gift."

The casual mention of marriage caught me off guard. Wedding? To whom? The thought stirred something uncomfortable in my chest, but before I could dwell on it, Eleanor was already moving on, chattering about her upcoming scene.
###chapter 52
Evelyn's POV

"Evelyn, aren't you at the studio yet?" Ian' voice with a slight irratation.
"I have a short video to shoot today, brother. I'll come tomorrow for the promotional ads and posters," I replied, keeping my voice light despite my impatience.
"Couldn't you have told me earlier?" Ian's disapproval was clear.
"I just got the notification." The lie slipped easily from my lips. "Look, I have to go. We're about to start shooting." Truth was, I hadn't just received the notification - I'd completely forgotten about it. 
I stabbed at the red button on my phone, ending Ian's call with more force than necessary. My brother could be so annoying sometimes with his constant hovering. 
The fact that I was shooting this video at Eleanor Yates's film location only made my mood worse. Just thinking about how she'd snatched that role from me made my blood boil.
"Miss Whitmore?" A timid voice interrupted my brooding. One of the assistants hovered in the doorway, clipboard clutched to her chest. "They're ready for you on set."

I gave my reflection one last appraising look. "Fine. Tell them I'll be there when I'm ready."

The assistant scurried away, but not before I caught the whispered conversation outside my door: "Did you hear Eleanor Yates signed with StarRiver? They say she's brilliant in the new..." The voices faded, but the irritation remained, sharp as a paper cut.

The lighting crew bustled around, adjusting equipment while the director's chair sat conspicuously empty.

"Where's Lee?" I demanded of no one in particular.

"Director Lee had an emergency." A familiar voice, cool and professional, made me stiffen. "I'll be handling today's shoot."

Jace Gillard. Of course it would be him. I remembered all too clearly how he'd dismissed me at the Harrington gala, barely acknowledging my presence despite my family's status. He stood there now in his typical casual attire, looking more like a college professor than a director, reviewing something on his tablet.

"Places, everyone!" He called out, not even looking up. "Miss Whitmore, if you could take your mark."

The first take went exactly as I'd rehearsed. I knew my angles, knew how to make the camera love me. I'd been doing this since I was sixteen.

"Cut." Jace's voice cut through my concentration. "Let's try that again. This time with actual emotion instead of poses."

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. "Excuse me?"

"Your eyeline is wrong, your movements are calculated rather than natural, and there's zero genuine emotion in your expression." He finally looked up from his tablet, his gaze clinical. "You're performing for the camera instead of inhabiting the character."

"I've been acting professionally for years," I snapped, my perfectly manicured nails digging into my palms. "Who are you to-"

"I'm the director," he interrupted, calm as still water. "And right now, what I'm seeing is a model trying to act, not an actress bringing a character to life."

The heat in my cheeks spread to my entire face. How dare he? In front of the entire crew? I stormed toward him, my voice rising with each step. "You know nothing about-"

My heel caught on a cable. I stumbled, grabbing at the nearest support - which happened to be Jace's arm. He staggered backward, colliding with the scaffolding behind him. There was a horrible metallic groan from above.

Time seemed to slow. I looked up to see a steel pipe breaking free from its mounting, falling directly toward me. My body froze, my mind blank with sudden terror.

Then something solid slammed into me from the side. I hit the ground hard, the breath knocked from my lungs. A sickening thud, followed by a sharp cry of pain.

When I managed to push myself up, I saw Jace lying beside me, his face contorted in pain, the fallen pipe across his leg. Blood was already seeping through his jeans.

"Someone call an ambulance!" voices shouted around us. The set erupted into chaos.

But I could only stare at him, my mind struggling to process what had just happened. This man who I'd been ready to tear into moments ago had just thrown himself between me and danger without hesitation.

I lay trembling beneath Jace, his body shielding mine from the fallen metal scaffolding. Tears streamed down my face as the reality of what just happened began to sink in. My heart was racing, and I couldn't stop shaking.

"Director Gillard, Miss Whitmore!" The crew members rushed forward, concern evident in their voices.

Jace let out a small cough as they helped him up. I noticed him wince slightly, though he tried to hide it. The crew then helped me to my feet, my legs still unsteady.

"Let's get you both to the hospital right away-" one of the crew members started.

"That won't be necessary. I'm fine," Jace said firmly, though I could see him testing his movements carefully. The scaffolding hadn't been too high, but the metal poles that had fallen could have caused serious damage if not for his quick thinking.

"I-I'm okay too," I managed to say, my eyes fixed on Jace. Thanks to him, I hadn't gotten so much as a scratch. Looking at him now, I noticed things I hadn't before - the sharp line of his jaw, his striking features that could rival any leading man in the industry. Something stirred in my chest, an unfamiliar feeling I couldn't quite place.

"Take care of this," Jace instructed the crew, already moving toward the adjacent set. As he walked away, I caught a glimpse of Eleanor Yates in her costume heading in the same direction.

I stood there, my hands still trembling slightly, watching Jace's retreating figure. The man who had just saved me was nothing like the image I'd had of him before.
###chapter 53
Serena's POV

I checked my phone one last time as I walked through the hospital corridor. Lucas had texted me several times last night - never directly asking me to pick him up, but dropping enough hints that even I couldn't miss his intention. The messages had that careful, almost casual tone I'd come to recognize when he wanted something but was too proud to ask outright.

When I reached his room, I found Miles busy with discharge paperwork, his efficiency evident in his quick movements. And there was Lucas, sitting perfectly still on the small sofa by the window.

I paused in the doorway, caught off guard by his appearance. Gone was his usual sharp business attire, replaced by a light blue button-down and khaki pants that somehow made him look younger, more approachable. But I didn't miss the paleness of his face or the slight tension in his shoulders that suggested he wasn't feeling as well as he wanted to appear.

"You came," Lucas said simply, his deep voice carrying across the room. His eyes met mine with an intensity that made me want to look away.

"I was in the area," I replied, aiming for casual but probably missing by a mile. "Ready to go?"

Miles glanced between us and suddenly became very interested in his phone. "I need to drop these forms at the nurses' station," he announced, heading for the door. "I'll meet you both at the car."

The silence that followed his exit felt heavy with expectation. Lucas hadn't moved from his spot on the sofa, and I realized with a mix of exasperation and something else I didn't want to examine too closely that he was waiting for me to help him up.

I crossed the room, trying to project an air of professional detachment. "Need a hand?" I noticed that for a moment, a smile flickered at the corner of his mouth.

The moment I got close enough, Lucas shifted his weight, effectively forcing me to either step back or support him. I chose the latter, almost stumbling as he leaned heavily against me. He was solid muscle, and I could feel the warmth of him even through his shirt.

"You're heavier than you look," I muttered, adjusting my stance to better support him.

"Must be all that last food," he replied, his breath brushing my ear and sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.

The walk to the car was an exercise in maintaining composure. Lucas seemed in no hurry to reduce how much he was leaning on me, and I was acutely aware of every point of contact between us. By the time we reached the car, my heart was racing, and I wasn't sure it was entirely from the physical exertion.

The drive started in silence, broken only by the soft hum of the air conditioning. I kept my eyes fixed firmly on the road ahead, though I could feel Lucas's presence beside me like a physical weight.

"Miss Sinclair," Miles spoke up from the frontal seat, his tone carefully neutral. "I saw in the news that you signed Eleanor Yates as your brand's new ambassador."

I tensed slightly. "Yes, that's right."

"She's perfect for fashion brands," Miles continued. "Beautiful, sophisticated. Don't you think so, sir?"

I couldn't help glancing at Lucas, trying to read his expression in my peripheral vision.

"She has good genes," Lucas replied, his tone maddeningly neutral.

Good genes. The words echoed in my mind, sparking unwanted questions. How well did he know Eleanor to comment on her genes? Had they already introduced themselves to their parents? I tried to push away the thought, but it lingered like an unwelcome shadow.

As we pulled up to the impressive gates of the Harrington estate, I noticed Walter stepping out onto the front steps. It struck me then - he actually lived here. During my previous visit, Lucas must have asked him to stay elsewhere temporarily. The realization made me uncomfortably aware of how much preparation had gone into that evening.

Before I could dwell on it further, the car door flew open, and two excited voices called out in unison.

"Mommy!" Milo and Stella rushed forward, their faces bright with excitement. "Dad wouldn't let us visit you at the hospital!"

"Hey, slow down," Lucas cautioned, but his voice held more amusement than warning.

I caught Lucas's eye over their heads, noting his slight smile. "Your daddy needed to rest and heal," I explained, running my hand through Milo's hair. "If you were there, he'd be too busy making sure you were okay."

Stella pouted. "That's not why. He didn't want us to monopolize you."

Heat crept into my cheeks as Lucas chuckled. "Come inside," he said, steering us toward the door. "It's getting cold."

At the entrance, Milo proudly pointed to a pair of slippers. "Look! We got these for you. Daddy helped us pick them."

The slippers were elegant but cozy, in a soft shade that matched the house's décor. My throat tightened as I remembered Lucas's slippers at my place. 

"Thank you," I managed, trying not to read too much into it. "They're perfect."

"Come on, we'll show you around properly this time!" Stella grabbed my hand, while Milo took the other. "Dad said you might stay over sometimes, so you need to know where everything is."

"I - what?" I stumbled slightly, caught off guard by their assumption.

"Your room is next to ours," Milo continued enthusiastically. "Though Dad said you'd probably stay in his room instead."

"Milo!" Lucas's voice carried a rare note of embarrassment. "That's enough."

I felt my face flame. The twins' innocent comments made everything feel too real, too intimate. This wasn't just about Lucas and me anymore - there were two children involved, children who seemed to have already accepted me into their lives.

Over dinner, the conversation flowed more naturally, though I remained hyper-aware of every interaction. The twins kept up a steady stream of chatter about school and their activities, while Lucas maintained a careful balance between managing their enthusiasm and making me feel welcome.

Then Stella asked the question that would change everything.

"Mommy, are you staying tonight? Please say yes! We could have breakfast together tomorrow!"

I nearly choked on my grape, and Lucas quickly handed me a glass of water. "Not tonight," he said smoothly. "But perhaps in the future, when the time is right."

"You mean after you get married?" Milo asked innocently.

The word 'married' hit me like a physical blow. Marriage had never been part of my plan - not after everything that had happened with Ian. And certainly not with someone like Lucas Harrington, whose world seemed to operate on a different plane from mine.

"That's enough questions for now," Lucas intervened.

On the drive home, I knew I had to address it. We had let things go too far, allowed the children to develop expectations that might never be met. It wasn't fair to them.

"I need to say something," I began, my voice steadier than I felt. "I know I have a past, but I'm not the kind of person who takes relationships lightly. You're... you're Lucas Harrington. You could have someone... someone without complications, someone who fits into your world naturally."

I forced myself to continue, even as I felt his tension beside me. "I think it's better if we stay friends. I can't give you what you deserve, and I won't let myself be a source of disappointment for those children."

Before he could respond, I asked him to stop the car. We were near enough to my building that I could walk the rest of the way. As soon as the car stopped, I got out, leaving him sitting there with an expression I couldn't - wouldn't - read.

As I walked away, I told myself this was the right decision. In the days that followed, I threw myself into work at StarRiver, grateful for the distraction. Lucas didn't contact me, and I convinced myself that meant he understood and agreed with my decision.
###chapter 54
Ian's POV

The sales report trembled in my hands, its numbers burning into my retinas like acid. StarRiver's new clothing line had captured over a third of our market share in Manhattan. The thought made my jaw clench.

I slammed the report onto my desk, sending ripples through my coffee.
"Mr. Whitmore?" The markerting manager's voice quavered from the doorway. "The complete competitor analysis you requested."

"Come in." I straightened my tie, a habit from years of board meetings. The young man placed a thick folder on my desk with trembling hands.

As I flipped through the glossy pages, my breath caught. The designs were... exceptional. Innovative silhouettes, perfect proportions, masterful use of fabric and form. And Eleanor Yates proved surprisingly dedicated. Whether in public or on her private social media accounts, she frequently discussed StarRiver Fashion, praising their designs enthusiastically.
The combination of positive word-of-mouth and strong design quality instantly thrust StarRiver Group into the spotlight, capturing everyone's attention. After seeing, My stomach churned.
"Who's their new designer?" I kept my voice carefully controlled.

"That's the thing, sir..." He shifted uncomfortably. "It's Nina Sinclair."

The name hit like a physical blow. Nina. My fingers tightened on the folder's edge until my knuckles went white.

"And no one thought to mention this development earlier?" Ice dripped from every word. "We've been hemorrhaging market share to StarRiver for weeks, and you're just now telling me that?"

"Sir, we didn't realize-"

"Exactly. You didn't realize. You didn't think." I rose slowly from my chair, enjoying how he shrank back. "That's not what I pay you for, is it?"

After he scurried out, I pulled out my phone. Nina answered on the second ring.

"What game are you playing?" I demanded without preamble.

"Ian." Her voice held that familiar sweetness that had always set my teeth on edge. "I was wondering when you'd call."

"Cut the act. Why are you helping Serena?" I couldn't contain my anger as I watched Nina try to play innocent.

"I had no idea it would blow up like this," she said with helplessness. "I was just designing randomly at first, but she kept rejecting everything. I had no choice but to follow her demands. I never imagined it would be this successful."

"You should have told me beforehand," I snapped, unable to hide my fury. 

"You didn't warn me about Serena wanting to sign Eleanor Yates, nor about StarRiver Fashion's major overhaul. Don't you understand, Nina? We're supposed to be family!"
"Have you completely lost your mind?" I couldn't help but explode.

Nina's words came out slow and deliberate: "StarRiver Fashion's success might not be such a bad thing after all."

The words stopped me cold. I looked out my office window at the gathering dusk, mind racing. "What exactly are you saying?"

"You're angry." Her tone turned cool. "I don't appreciate that. Call me back when you're ready to have a civilized conversation."

The line went dead.

I stood there, phone still pressed to my ear, as the pieces began shifting in my mind. I paced restlessly in my study. The conversation with Nina from moments ago kept replaying in my mind. I'd lost my temper. Running a hand through my hair, I glanced at my phone, its screen still dark. Had I pushed too hard?

My fingers hovered over the dial pad before I made the call. Nina answered on the second ring, her voice carefully neutral.

"I apologize for earlier," I said, keeping my tone gentle. "I spoke harshly because I worry about you. You're too loyal sometimes - even when Serena's clearly using you."

A pause. I waited, letting the tension stretch.

"You think I'm that naive?" Nina finally responded, her voice carrying an edge. "That I don't see what's happening at StarRiver?"

I settled into my leather chair, interest piqued. "What do you mean?"

"The brand's riding high right now. All positive press, growing sales..." She trailed off meaningfully. "But you know how quickly things can change in fashion."

My grip tightened on the phone. "Internal reshuffling won't hurt StarRiver's reputation."

"Maybe not StarRiver's," Nina agreed. "But Serena's personal reputation... that's different."

I sat up straighter. "We can't use my reputation as ammunition. The social fallout-"

"Remember those photos I sent you?"

The words hung in the air. Those photos - tastefully compromising, perfectly framed for misinterpretation. I'd been shocked when Nina first shared them, insisted we couldn't use them. But now...

"It's not right," I said, but my protest sounded weak even to my own ears.

Nina's laugh was soft, knowing. "Was it right when she humiliated you? When she threw away everything we'd built?" She paused. "Besides, this is business. We wait until production costs are committed, then strike. No loans, no expansion. The company becomes vulnerable."

I found myself nodding, mind racing ahead to possibilities. "And then..."

"And then we step in to 'save' it. All very proper and businesslike."

The plan unfurled in my mind like a blooming flower, elegant in its simplicity. 

"You're brilliant," I said, meaning it. "We should announce our engagement soon, show a united front-"

"Not yet," she cut in smoothly. "Let's focus on the plan first. Timing is everything."

"Of course." I smiled into the darkness. "You're absolutely right, darling. As always."

We exchanged a few more endearments before ending the call. Sitting in my darkened study, I felt a thrill of anticipation.
###chapter 55
Serena's POV

The sales figures on my screen painted a picture of stunning success - StarRiver's latest collection had exceeded even our most optimistic projections. Nearly every item was sold out nationwide within days of launch. I smiled, remembering Mother's words: "Fashion isn't about exclusivity, Serena. It's about making beauty accessible to everyone who appreciates it."

"Miss Sinclair?" Vincent poked his head into my office. "The production team is ready for the expansion meeting."

I nodded, gathering my tablet. We needed to scale up immediately - no artificial scarcity, no playing games with supply and demand. That wasn't what StarRiver stood for.

The peaceful satisfaction shattered when my office door burst open again. Lily, PR Director, practically stumbled in, her face ash-white. "Miss Sinclair... I'm so sorry, but you need to see this."

She thrust her phone at me. The headline from Radiant Times blazed across the screen: "StarRiver's Dark Secret: How Serena Sinclair Climbed to Success." Below it, a carousel of photos started auto-playing. My blood ran cold.

There I was, at various high-society events, being cornered by potential sponsors. Men leaning too close, hands lingering too long - moments I'd endured while securing backing for Whitemore. Now these same photos were being weaponized, twisted into a sordid narrative of sleeping my way to the top. The article specifically mentioned my relationship with Ian Whitmore, painting me as an unfaithful gold-digger who'd used him as a stepping stone.

"They're saying..." Lily swallowed hard. "They're claiming you... with multiple men, while you were engaged to Mr. Whitmore..."

I set the phone down with steady hands. "How bad is it?"

"It's everywhere. Social media is exploding. And... Mr. Whitmore just posted a statement."

Of course he had. I pulled up Ian's social media myself. His carefully worded post neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, simply expressing that our relationship had "ended amicably" and that he "wished to respect everyone's privacy." The perfect way to pour gasoline on the fire while appearing above it all.

My office phone started ringing. Then my cell. Then my email notifications began pinging rapidly.

"The customer service lines are overwhelmed," Lily reported, her voice shaking. "People are demanding refunds, returns... saying they won't wear clothes made by... by..."

"A whore?" I finished quietly, watching the social media comments scroll past. The venom was impressive in its creativity. Apparently, I was an ungrateful social climber who'd betrayed the magnificent Ian Whitmore, who'd so generously stooped to dating someone of my common background.

The irony almost made me laugh. Those photos - every single one of them - had been taken at events where I'd been hustling to secure sponsors for Ian's family's ventures. I'd endured those uncomfortable moments, those unwanted advances, those predatory power plays, all to help the Whitmore. And now Ian was using them to destroy me.

"Miss Sinclair?" Lily hovered anxiously. "Radiant Times is requesting a statement."

I looked at the chaos unfolding on my screens - plummeting stock prices, cancellation notices, social media meltdown.

"Let them wait," I said softly, my voice steady despite the storm raging in my chest. "I need a moment to think."

While I was lost in thought, Wesley Morgan, Sales Director, barged into my office, his usually composed demeanor visibly shaken.

"Ms. Sinclair, we're facing unprecedented returns across all retail locations. The shopping malls are threatening to pull our products from their shelves due to customer complaints."

I kept my expression neutral, though my fingers unconsciously tapped against the desk. Before I could respond, Caleb Reed from Procurement burst in, his face ashen.

"The suppliers are demanding immediate payment. They're threatening legal action if we don't settle by the end of the week."

The customer service department's report came through on my phone: "Lines completely overwhelmed. Unable to handle the volume of complaints."

I took a deep breath, my mind already formulating a response plan. "Call an emergency management meeting in ten minutes." My voice remained steady, betraying none of the tension coiling in my chest.
As I stood to prepare for the meeting, I caught a glimpse of Nina through the glass walls of my office. She was whispering to someone, a hint of a smirk playing on her lips as she cast a sideways glance in my direction. I forced myself to look away. There would be time to deal with her later.

The situation with Eleanor was worse than I'd anticipated. News alerts kept popping up on my screen: "StarRiver Scandal: Celebrity Endorser Eleanor Yates Under Fire." Her upcoming TV show was put on hold, and social media had turned into a battlefield.

My hands hovered over the phone. Eleanor didn't deserve this collateral damage. I dialed her number, preparing myself for the inevitable.

"Eleanor, I think we should terminate our contract." I tried to keep my voice professional. "I'll cover all penalty clauses-"

"Serena Sinclair!" Her sharp tone cut through my practiced speech. "Is that what you think of me?"

I fell silent, caught off guard by her anger.

Her voice softened. "I know you're being set up. I believe you. And I'm not going anywhere."

Something warm pressed against my eyes. "But your career-"

"My career can handle it. Besides, my brother just called me and-"

My phone buzzed with another call. Lucas's name flashed on the screen. I hesitated, then switched lines after saying goodbye to Eleanor.

The silence stretched between us for several seconds.

"I have a meeting," I said finally, my tone deliberately distant.

"StarRiver's stock has started to fluctuate." His voice was calm, matter-of-fact. "I've arranged for an international crisis management team to handle the press. They'll be available whenever you need them. The funding's already been arranged as well. Use it if necessary."
###chapter 56
Lucas's POV

I kept my movements measured and deliberate as I worked through the crisis response checklist, though my mind raced with possibilities and contingencies.

Miles stood quietly by the door, tablet in hand, waiting for my next instruction. I'd already set several wheels in motion: calls to media outlets, arrangements with the PR team, and a discreet conversation with Eleanor's management. Now came the hardest part.

My fingers closed around the Mont Blanc pen, turning it slowly as I stared at my phone. The urge to protect her warred with the knowledge that she valued her independence. I'd learned enough about Serena to know that a wrong move now could push her further away.

"Get the international crisis management team ready for tomorrow morning," I told Miles, keeping my voice steady. "Have them route through Weehawken first."

He nodded and stepped out, leaving me alone with my thoughts. The pen rotated faster between my fingers as I dialed her number. One ring. Two. The city lights blurred into streaks of gold and silver beyond the glass.

"Mr. Harrington." Her voice was controlled, professional. Too professional.

I forced myself to match her tone. "I've arranged for the negative coverage to be pulled. The crisis team will be here by morning, and I can have the funds transferred immediately."

The silence that followed felt endless. I could almost see her expression - that careful mask she wore when wrestling with difficult decisions.

"I appreciate the offer, but no." Her words came slowly, deliberately. "I'll handle this myself."

The pen stilled in my grip. "Don't you trust me?"

"No." A pause, then softer: "I don't trust anyone but myself anymore."

My knuckles whitened around the pen. "Serena-"

"Mr. Harrington," she cut in, "I'm grateful for your concern. But this is my problem to solve. I won't have you facing complications because of me."

The line went dead. I stared at the phone, jaw clenched, as the silence of the office pressed in around me. The pen creaked in protest under my grip.

A quiet knock preceded Miles's entrance. He took one look at my expression and said, "She turned down the help?"

I set the pen down before I could snap it. "She did."

"Sir." Miles's voice held a note of careful consideration. "Remember who she is. StarRiver's heir wouldn't risk her mother's legacy without a plan."

The tension in my shoulders eased slightly as his words sank in. He was right. Serena had survived worse, had rebuilt herself from nothing once before. If she said she could handle this...

"Keep monitoring the situation," I said, turning back to my laptop. "Discreetly."

"Of course, sir."

The night stretched ahead, filled with work that demanded attention. But my thoughts kept drifting to her, hoping she knew that even if she wouldn't accept my help directly, I'd still be here.


Serena's POV

At StarRiver Group's executive conference room, twenty-four pairs of eyes fixed on me, each revealing varying degrees of panic. I kept my gaze steady, though my fingertips pressed slightly harder against the leather portfolio in front of me.

This was StarRiver's first major crisis since Mother had passed away. The thought of her gave me strength - she would have handled this with the same composure I needed to show now.

"Serena, have you figured out how to handle this?" Nina's voice cut through the tension, dripping with manufactured concern. "If we don't act quickly, StarRiver might..."

I studied her carefully. The slight upturn of her lips betrayed her satisfaction at the chaos she'd orchestrated. Ian was likely involved too - the timing was too perfect to be coincidental. They were still using the same old tricks, just with higher stakes now.

"Thank you for your concern, Nina." I kept my voice level, ignoring the flutter of anxiety in my chest. "Let's review the situation systematically."

Wesley Morgan cleared his throat. "The preliminary numbers show fifty thousand units affected. The social media backlash is..." He trailed off, his expression grim.

I nodded, allowing the weight of the situation to settle before speaking. "I have a four-step plan to address this crisis."

The room fell silent. I could feel Nina's eyes boring into me, probably hoping to see me crumble. Instead, I straightened my spine and continued.

"First, we will accept all returns unconditionally."

"But the financial impact-" Wesley started.

"Will be significant," I finished for him. "Which brings me to step two. I need Finance to calculate our exact shortfall by end of day. Factor in both the 50% return rate and outstanding payments."

I paused, noting how Lily was already taking rapid notes.

"Third, we're holding a press conference tomorrow morning. Lily, I want you to invite all major Manhattan media outlets. No private negotiations, no under-the-table deals. We face this transparently." I turned to her. "Please arrange appropriate refreshments for the media. We're not bribing them, but we will show them proper hospitality."

Lily nodded, a glimmer of respect in her eyes.

"Finally, all department heads must reassure their teams. No external discussions about this situation. We handle this as one unified company."

The tension in the room had shifted. Where there had been panic, I now sensed cautious hope. But I wasn't finished. In a move that surprised even myself, I stood and bowed deeply to the assembled executives.

"StarRiver is more than just a company to me," I said, my voice firm despite the emotion threatening to crack it. "It's my mother's legacy, and I give you my word - I will not let it fall."

The silence that followed felt electric. Then Wesley stood up.

"Ms. Sinclair has my complete support," he declared.

"And mine," Lily added immediately.

One by one, the other executives voiced their support. I straightened, catching Nina's expression darken from the corner of my eye. 

"Thank you," I said quietly. "Please begin implementing the plan immediately. We'll reconvene at 8 AM tomorrow to review progress."

As the executives filed out, I remained standing. Nina lingered by the door. "That was quite a performance, sis."

I turned to face her, seeing not just my stepsister, but a reflection of all the challenges ahead. "It wasn't a performance, Nina. It was a promise."
###chapter 57
Ian's POV

I stared at my phone, watching the headlines about Serena disappear one by one. My fingers tightened around the device as another notification popped up - yet another article taken down. Fury coursed through my veins as I dialed Nina's number.
"They're all gone," I spat out the moment she answered. "Every single piece of negative press about Serena. Someone's been systematically removing them."

Nina's voice came through, carefully measured. "I know. It seems Lucas Harrington's been quite... proactive in protecting her interests."

A bitter laugh escaped me. "Of course. Serena certainly knows how to wrap men around her finger, doesn't she?" The words tasted like acid on my tongue. "First me, now Harrington. She's quite talented at that particular game."

"Ian, calm down. The damage is already done. The public won't forget the scandal so easily."

I paced across my study, the evening light casting long shadows across the hardwood floors. "She's planning a press conference, Nina. A press conference! The audacity of that woman..." My free hand clenched into a fist. "She actually thinks she can salvage her reputation."

"Let her try," Nina's voice held a note of calculated malice. "The more she exposes herself, the more vulnerable she becomes."

I paused by the window, watching the city lights flicker to life. "I'll handle the media contacts. Make sure they ask the right questions." I said through clenched teeth, "If Serena wants to face the press, we'll give her an audience she won't forget."

After hanging up, I settled into my leather chair, opening my laptop to check the latest developments. My blood ran cold as I saw Eleanor Yates's latest social media post - a lengthy defense of Serena, suggesting she'd been framed. The comments section was a battlefield, with opinions starting to shift.

"Damn it," I muttered, scrolling through the responses. Some were still condemning Serena, but others... others were beginning to question the narrative we'd so carefully constructed. Then came the announcement that made my stomach turn - StarRiver Group's unconditional return policy. A strategic move that was already garnering public approval.

My hand shook slightly as I reached for my phone again. I needed to act fast. Within minutes, I was making calls to every media contact in my network, my voice steady despite the panic clawing at my chest.

"I want her cornered at that press conference," I instructed one editor after another. "No softball questions. No easy escapes." I made promises of exclusive access, of future favors - whatever it took to ensure their cooperation.


I picked up my phone, finding Serena's number with practiced ease. The connection tone hummed - once, twice - before her voice came through, cool and composed as ever.

"Having some trouble lately, Serena?" I couldn't keep the smugness from my voice. "Three million in losses, I hear. Not to mention the twenty million units already in production. That puts you what - over a hundred million in the red?"

Her silence was telling. I continued, relishing each word. "And without investors backing you... well, we both know where this is heading."

"Is there a point to this call, Ian Whitemore?" Her voice remained steady, irritatingly so.

I leaned back in my chair, adopting a more conciliatory tone. "Actually, there is. I could help you, you know. All you need to do is admit you're in over your head. StarRiver Group needs experienced leadership, not..." I paused deliberately, "amateur hour."

"That's very generous of you." The sarcasm in her voice made my fingers tighten around the phone. "But I'll have to decline."

"Always so stubborn, aren't you? This is exactly why things didn't work between us. You never could accept help gracefully." I sneered.

"Speaking of help," her tone shifted, becoming razor-sharp, "those photos that leaked to the press - they wouldn't have anything to do with you, would they?"

My heart skipped a beat, but I kept my voice steady. "Photos? I have no idea what you're talking about. Though if you're facing some media scrutiny, perhaps it's because you've made yourself too visible. The press can be quite ruthless with prominent figures."

"Interesting theory. Especially since some of those photos were from private events. Events where you were present, if I recall correctly."

I stood up abruptly, pacing beside my desk. "I rarely attend those kinds of gatherings. And I certainly don't keep track of who drinks what with whom."

"No?" Her voice carried a dangerous edge now. "Then you wouldn't know anything about Nina's involvement either?"

The name hit me like a physical blow. I stopped pacing, my free hand gripping the back of my chair. "Nina? What are you implying?"

"I think you know exactly what I'm implying, Ian Whitemore. The timing, the specific photos chosen, the convenient leak - it all points to someone with intimate knowledge of those events. Someone working with Nina."

"You're delusional," I snapped, heat rising in my collar. "If you're looking for someone to blame for your failures, try looking in a mirror. Your own arrogance is what's bringing you down, Serena. You and your pathetic attempt to prove yourself."

"Interesting choice of words. Especially coming from someone who's been working so hard to orchestrate my downfall."

The pretense was crumbling, and with it, my composure. "You don't know what you're talking about. This conversation is over."
I jabbed the end call button, my hand shaking with rage. How dare she? How dare she sit there, so calm and collected, while accusing me? The press conference tomorrow couldn't come soon enough. Let's see how composed she remains when everything falls apart.
###chapter 58
Serena's POV

I set the phone face-down on my desk, my movements deliberate and controlled. The city lights twinkled beyond my office windows, unchanged despite how my world had just shifted on its axis. Five years. I'd given Ian Whitmore five years of my life, fought countless battles by his side, even saved his family's company from bankruptcy. And this was his answer - conspiring with my sister behind my back.

"I can accept that you don't love me anymore," I whispered to the empty office, my voice steady despite the rage coursing through my veins. "But I cannot forgive this betrayal."

My computer chimed with an incoming email from Lucas. I hesitated before opening it, my father's words from years ago echoing in my head: "Trust is a luxury we can't afford, Serena."

My finger hovered over the reply button, but I couldn't bring myself to type even a simple "thank you." The walls I'd carefully constructed had risen higher than ever. After all, hadn't I trusted my own father once? Hadn't I believed in family, only to watch Lawrence choose Nina over me time and time again?

The sky was beginning to lighten when Vincent knocked on my door. "Ms. Sinclair, we've confirmed the media attendance for today's press conference. Thirty-five outlets have RSVP'd."

I looked up from the stack of documents I'd been methodically organizing. "Almost double what we expected. Everyone loves a good family drama, don't they?"

Walter shifted uncomfortably. "Should we try to limit the number?"

"No." I straightened a paper clip with precise movements. "Let them all come. And Vincent, please ask Nina to my office."

She arrived fifteen minutes later, all wide-eyed concern and perfectly calculated sisterly worry. "Serena," Nina's voice dripped with false sympathy as she closed the door behind her. "I heard about the press conference. You don't have to do this alone. I know how difficult-"

"You'll be joining me," I cut her off, my tone pleasant but firm. "After all, this concerns both of us, doesn't it?"

A flicker of uncertainty crossed her face. "Of course, I'll support you. You don't need to worry about-"

"I'm not worried at all," I smiled, watching her carefully. "Why would I be? Today isn't about me, Nina. It's about truth... and consequences."

She tried to read my expression, but I'd had years of practice keeping my thoughts hidden.

"Now," I stood, gathering my files. "Shall we go give the press what they came for?"

Nina's answering smile wavered slightly. Good. She should be nervous.

The press conference room at the Tribeca Towers feels like a battlefield. Camera flashes assault my vision like strobe lights, turning the modern space into a disco of hostility. I maintain my composure, keeping my spine straight in my fitted black blazer. The weight of StarRiver Group's future rests on my shoulders.

Nina stands beside me, her eyes conspicuously red-rimmed. She's perfected the art of looking devastated, I'll give her that. Every few minutes, she dabs at her eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief - a performance worthy of an Oscar.

"Ms. Sinclair." A reporter from The Phoenix Herald rises, his voice cutting through the chaos. "Are you here to address the allegations of your multiple affairs that surfaced yesterday?"

Before I can respond, another journalist jumps in. "How do you feel about betraying Ian Whitmore? Don't you think he deserved better?"

The questions come like rapid fire, each more pointed than the last. I remain silent, watching the frenzy build. A woman in the third row practically leaps from her seat: "Eleanor Yates has publicly supported you on social media. What did you offer her in exchange?"

Nina lets out a small, theatrical sob beside me. "Sister..." she whispers, just loud enough for the nearest microphones to pick up. I resist the urge to roll my eyes at her performance.

"Will StarRiver Group survive this scandal?" someone shouts from the back. "Your father's health has been declining - was this stress the final straw?"

Years of boardroom battles have taught me that timing is everything. Let them exhaust their ammunition first.

Finally, when the room reaches a fever pitch of accusations and speculations, I lean forward slightly toward the microphone. "May I speak now?"

The effect is immediate. The chaos dies down, replaced by an anticipatory silence that feels almost electric. Even Nina's theatrical sniffling stops.

"If everyone is finished, I would appreciate your attention," I continue, my voice steady and measured. "After I've said my piece, I'll answer your questions - all of them, as time permits."
###chapter 59
Serena's POV

"Thank you all for coming today," I said, my voice steady and clear through the microphone. "I'd like to address the photographs that were released yesterday."

More flashes erupted. From the corner of my eye, I caught Nina shifting uncomfortably in her seat.

"First, I want to confirm that yes, these photographs are authentic." I paused, letting the murmurs ripple through the crowd. "They haven't been manipulated or doctored in any way."

The admission sent a fresh wave of excitement through the room. I could see reporters frantically typing on their phones, no doubt racing to be the first to break this confirmation. But I wasn't finished.

"However," I continued, "context is everything. These photos were taken during my time working in public relations at Whitmore Group, when the company was facing significant financial difficulties."

A reporter from Radiant Times shot up his hand. "Ms. Sinclair, are you suggesting these were business meetings? The intimate nature of some of these photos-"

"What you're seeing," I cut in smoothly, "are carefully selected moments from standard corporate social events. Every person in those photos was a potential investor or sponsor for Whitmore Industries."

I maintained eye contact with the room, my voice never wavering. "During my relationship with Ian Whitmore, I was completely faithful. These photos have been deliberately chosen and timed to suggest impropriety where none existed."

"But let's ask ourselves an interesting question," I said, my tone shifting slightly. "Who would have had the resources and access to take these photographs? Who would have had the motivation to hold onto them for all these years, waiting for the perfect moment to release them?"

Nina seemed even more uneasy than before. The room grew quieter, the reporters sensing a bigger story emerging.

"Nina," I turned to face her directly, "you seem nervous. Perhaps you'd like to explain why these photos - photos that were taken while I was working at your boyfriend's family company - have suddenly surfaced now?"

She jerked in her seat, color draining from her face. "Serena, what are you implying? I-I would never..."

"Never what, Nina? Never orchestrate a campaign to discredit me right when StarRiver Group is about to announce its new strategic partnership?" I kept my voice calm.

Camera flashes punctuated the silence like irregular heartbeats, casting harsh shadows across Nina's increasingly pale face. I watched as her fingers twisted the hem of her designer blazer.

"Sister, you can't possibly misunderstand me like this," Nina's voice wavered, dripping with manufactured sweetness. Her eyes darted between the reporters and me, desperately seeking allies in the crowd. "I've always respected you..."

I remained silent, studying her performance. The corner of my mouth twitched slightly as I caught Vincent's subtle nod from the back of the room. Everything was ready.

"Miss Sinclair," a reporter called out, his pen poised eagerly over his notepad, "can you identify who was behind the recent allegations?"

I maintained my composure, my voice steady and clear. "The person who's currently with Ian Whitmore..." I paused, letting the weight of my words sink in. "Or rather, the person who was already involved with him while we were still together - that's your answer."

Nina's artificial smile faltered for a split second before she recovered, turning to the reporters with practiced concern. "My sister has been under tremendous pressure lately. She's probably just trying to deflect attention from the real issues." Her voice took on a wounded tone. "I've always supported her, but to think she'd accuse me of such things..."

I almost admired her commitment to the act. Almost.

"Vincent," I called out softly, "the lights, please."

The room dimmed, and the projector hummed to life. The first image filled the screen: Nina and Ian at his 27th birthday celebration, their faces intimately close. The timestamp in the corner was unmistakable - a night I remembered all too well. I had been securing a crucial sponsorship deal, apologizing profusely for missing the celebration. Ian had been so understanding, so considerate.

The irony made me want to laugh.

"That... that night was different!" Nina's voice had lost its sweetness, taking on a shrill edge. "You weren't there, so I went to represent the family. There were others present-"
###chapter 60
Serena's POV

"Yes," I cut her off smoothly, "there were others present. That's exactly how these photos came to be."

The reaction was immediate - dozens of cameras turned away from us to capture the image. The whispers among the reporters grew louder. Nina's carefully constructed mask was slipping, panic bleeding through the cracks. 

"This was taken three months ago," I said calmly, "at the Odyssey private club."

I pressed the button to go to the next photo. This one showed her and Ian in the club's private pool area, his hands on her waist.

"Just swimming lessons," Nina blurted out, her voice rising an octave. "Ian was teaching me to swim. That's all!" She looked around the room, seeking support, but found only skeptical faces and furiously scribbling pens.

"Interesting," I said softly. "Especially since you've been on the university swim team since freshman year."

The third photograph appeared before she could respond. They were in a dimly lit VIP room. She seemed drunk, leaning dependently against Ian Whitemore, and his hand slipped under her clothes. Nina's face paled.

"I was drunk," she stammered. "I wasn't feeling well, and Ian was just helping me..."

"You seem to need a lot of help from my former fiancé," I observed. The reporters' whispers had grown to a steady buzz.

But it was the final photograph that silenced everything. Even the camera flashes stopped for a moment.

There was Ian, still in his engagement ceremony suit, with Nina in his arms. The timestamp showed it was taken just hours before he was supposed to meet me at the altar. The intimacy of their embrace was undeniable.

The lights blazed back to life in the conference hall, casting harsh fluorescence over Nina's pallid face. I stood my ground, watching her carefully constructed facade crumble. The sea of reporters before us erupted into chaos, their voices blending into a crescendo of shock and accusation.

Nina's fingers trembled as she gripped the table.

"Ms. Sinclair - Nina - is it true about your relationship with Ian Whitmore?" A reporter thrust his microphone forward. "When did it begin?"

Nina's lips parted, but no sound emerged. Another voice cut through the chaos: "How long have you been involved with your sister's ex-fiancé?"

The questions came rapid-fire now, each one more pointed than the last. I watched as Nina's composure fractured further, tears welling in her expertly made-up eyes. It was fascinating, really, how quickly her mask of innocence was dissolving.

"You've been making accusations against your sister for months," a female reporter pressed, her tone sharp. "Was this all just a smokescreen to hide your own actions?"

Nina's shoulders began to shake. "You don't understand," she choked out, her voice barely audible. "It's not... I never meant..." The tears spilled over now, sending black mascara trails down her cheeks.

Some of the reporters exchanged glances - I could see them weighing whether to ease up in the face of her distress. But others pressed harder.

"Nina Sinclair, what do you say to allegations that you deliberately sabotaged your sister's engagement?"

I saw Nina's eyes dart toward the exit. Before she could make her move, I stepped forward and caught her wrist. Her head snapped up, eyes wide with panic and fury.

"Running won't solve anything," I said quietly, pitched for her ears alone. "We're going to clear everything up right here."

She tried to wrench away, but I held firm. "Let me go," she hissed, her tear-stained face contorting. "Haven't you humiliated me enough?"

I met her gaze steadily. "Humiliation? Is that what you call accountability?"

Moments later, something shifted in her eyes then - the panic receding, replaced by something colder. When she spoke again, her voice had changed, taking on a strange, almost dreamy quality.

"Fine. You want the truth?" Nina turned to face the reporters. "Yes, Ian and I are in love. We have been for months. We tried to fight it, but..." She gave a delicate shrug, her lips curving into a small smile. "Sometimes the heart wants what it wants."

I felt my own lips curl into a sardonic smile. Even now, she was trying to spin this into some tragic romance. The reporters surged forward with renewed vigor, but I barely heard their questions.

"How convenient," I said, just loudly enough to carry. "That your heart happened to want exactly what would hurt me most."

Nina's eyes flashed, and for a moment, her careful mask slipped. In that instant, I saw what I'd always known was there: pure, undiluted hatred. 

"I know what I did was wrong," she began, her voice wavering. "Ian and I... we never meant to hurt anyone. Sometimes love just happens, and you can't control your heart." She dabbed at her eyes with a tissue, the perfect picture of remorse.

The reporters weren't buying her performance. "Ms. Nina Sinclair," one of them called out, his tone sharp. "If this was truly about uncontrollable love, why continue the affair after Mr. Whitmore and Ms. Serena Sinclair's engagement was announced? Why the secrecy?"

I suppressed a smile as Nina's composure cracked slightly. She hadn't expected them to be so direct. "I... we..." she stammered before collecting herself. "We tried to stay apart. Ian even agreed to the engagement to spare everyone's feelings. But our connection was too strong to deny."

"Speaking of sparing feelings," another reporter cut in, her red lipstick as sharp as her words, "isn't this a pattern in your family, Ms. Sinclair? Your mother Angela was also involved with Lawrence Sinclair while he was married to Serena's mother."

The color drained from Nina's face. This wasn't following her script at all. She'd clearly expected sympathy, perhaps even admiration for her "brave honesty." Instead, the vultures she'd invited were turning on her.

"That's... that's completely different," she protested, but her voice had lost its melodic quality. "I've been in so much pain, carrying this burden. All I want now is forgiveness and understanding." Her eyes found mine, pleading. 

With cold amusement, I watched Nina continue her performance of self-justification.

Nina said weakly, her voice trembling with practiced emotion. "I feel terrible about betraying my sister. But sometimes you can't control who you fall in love with - feelings themselves aren't right or wrong. Back then, Ian and Serena were just two lonely people finding comfort abroad. It wasn't real love. But Serena gave so much to Ian, and he felt too guilty to tell her he wanted to break up."

"I know our relationship won't get any public sympathy, and I don't expect forgiveness," Nina continued, her eyes glistening. "I'll accept all the criticism and hatred I deserve! But now that you've exposed us publicly, sister, I actually feel relieved. I've been carrying this guilt about you for so long, never able to truly be happy with Ian, always feeling depressed."

I watched her performance with detached amusement. Her manipulation skills were indeed impressive - even in this situation, she was still trying to control the narrative.

"Sister, I'm not angry that you chose to humiliate me this way. In fact, I'm grateful - it's finally set me free," Nina said, looking at me with practiced sincerity. "I hope you can forgive Ian and me for falling in love uncontrollably. I really don't want this to ruin our sisterly bond."

"Blood is thicker than water, sister," she said, her voice trembling just enough to sound genuine. "Time heals all wounds. Can't we move past this, for the sake of family?"

The room fell silent, all eyes turning to me. I met her gaze steadily, letting the moment stretch until the air grew thick with tension. When I finally spoke, my voice was clear and cold as winter frost.

"No," I said simply. "A homewrecker never deserves forgiveness."
###chapter 61
Serena's POV

The camera flashes exploded like lightning, capturing Nina's mask as it finally shattered. 

"Infidelity can never be forgiven," I stated, my voice calm and clear. The scratching of pens ceased abruptly. "No circumstance, no excuse, no amount of time can justify betraying someone's trust that way."

A ripple went through the crowd. In my peripheral vision, I caught Nina's fingers tightening around her tissue.

"Miss Nina Sinclair," a reporter stood up, his expression hardening as he addressed Nina. "What about the photographs? The ones that were used to question your sister's reputation?"

Nina's response came too quickly. "I had nothing to do with those pictures," she protested, her hand unconsciously rising to fidget with her necklace. "Everything I've done has been for StarRiver's benefit. The autumn collection-"

"I think," I interrupted softly, reaching for my phone, "everyone might be more interested in this."

The recording began to play, Ian's voice filling the suddenly silent room: 
"I am Ian Whitemore About that press conference tomorrow-could you make sure your people really keep an eye on things?"
"So, Mr. Whitemore, are you saying we should go easy on Serena Sinclair?" The voice on the other end distorted.
"No," Ian Whitemore promptly denied. "In fact, the opposite."
He went on, "Once tomorrow's done, I'll make sure to show my appreciation."

As the recording continued, I was acutely aware of every reaction in the room. The sharp intake of breath from the front row. The furious typing on laptops. 

My mind drifted to the email I'd received from Lucas days ago. Just the files - no message, no instructions, no pressure. He'd given me complete freedom to decide whether to use them. The gesture spoke volumes about his respect for my autonomy, yet I couldn't help but maintain my guard. Trust, once broken, was like a cracked mirror - even when repaired, the lines remained visible.

Nina's complexion, already fair, turned ashen. I watched as her nails dug into her palm, leaving crescent-shaped marks. The reporters leaned forward in their seats, pens hovering over notepads, as Ian's voice filled the room.

"Miss Nina Sinclair," a reporter stood up, her voice sharp. "These recordings clearly show collusion between Ian Whitmore and you to sabotage StarRiver Group. How do you respond to this evidence?"

Nina's lips trembled before she forced them into a tight smile. "This is Ian's personal opinion and has nothing - ."

"Miss Nina," another reporter cut in, "StarRiver's recent booming sales have impacted Whitmore's market share. Is this your main motive for slandering Serena and StarRiver?"
"I-I really didn't..." Nina continued to stubbornly deny it. "I never meant... This isn't what it looks like!" Her eyes darted around the room. "Serena, please, you have to understand-"
I observed Nina's increasing agitation with detached interest. Her hands shook slightly as she adjusted her microphone.

"Ladies and gentlemen of the press," I finally spoke, my voice steady and measured. "I didn't want to hold this conference. But when backed into a corner, sometimes the only way out is through the front door." The metaphor landed exactly as intended, drawing knowing nods from several veteran reporters.

Nina's breathing grew more erratic as I continued. I could sense her mounting fury at my composure.

"With the evidence now public, I believe everyone understands the whole story. Appreciate you all being here for today's press briefing."

"Oh, by the way, I have just one thing to say to Ian and Nina: I wish Ian and Nina all the happiness in the world together. May their relationship be as loyal as their business practices." I concluded, allowing the faintest smile to touch my lips.

The room erupted with questions, but I was already stepping away from the podium. 
###chapter 62
Lucas's POV

On my screen, news coverage of the press conference plays on mute, frozen on a frame of Serena addressing the reporters. Even without sound, her composure is evident in every line of her posture, in the unwavering look in her eyes.

I lean back in my chair, letting out a slow breath. She proved stronger than I'd anticipated. Not that I ever doubted her capabilities, but the way she handled the situation - it showed a level of resilience I hadn't expected.

Miles enters with a fresh cup of coffee, placing it on my desk with practiced precision. "The press conference has been making quite the rounds, sir. Every major outlet is covering it."

"Her performance was... unexpected," I admit, keeping my tone neutral despite the pride threatening to seep through.

A knowing smile plays at the corners of his mouth. "I told you Ms. Sinclair would have everything under control. She wouldn't have refused your help without being absolutely certain."

I nodded slightly, my fingers hover over my phone's keyboard. I've already typed and deleted three different messages to her. Each attempt at congratulations feels either too formal or too intimate. In the end, I close the messaging app entirely. She's made it clear she wants to handle things independently, and I understand why. Life has taught her the hard cost of trusting too easily.

The phone rings, Drew Yeager's name flashing on the screen. I consider letting it go to voicemail, but knowing Drew, he'd just keep calling.

"Tell me you watched that press conference," he says the moment I pick up, not bothering with a greeting. "Our little reporter really knows how to command a room."

"She's not 'our' anything," I reply, my voice dropping a few degrees.

"Touchy, touchy." I can hear the grin in his voice. "But seriously, Lucas, she handled herself beautifully. Smart, fierce, independent - exactly your type. If you don't make a move soon-"

"Weren't you considering that study abroad program in Switzerland?" I cut in smoothly. "I hear winter semester applications are still open."

Drew's laugh carries through the phone. "Message received, loud and clear. But speaking of celebrations - your birthday's coming up. Twenty-eight is a big deal. We should do something."

I glance at the calendar on my desk, an idea taking shape. "Perhaps."

"Don't 'perhaps' me. You need to start living a little. When was the last time you-"

"I'll think about it," I interrupt, already reaching for my phone again. This time, when I open the messaging app, I know exactly what to write.

*Delete the previous draft*

My fingers move decisively across the screen: "My birthday is the day after tomorrow. Keep your schedule clear. Dinner."

Short, direct, leaving no room for refusal while still giving her the dignity of choice. It's an acknowledgment of her victory today, wrapped in an invitation that allows her to feel she's repaying a debt rather than accepting charity.

The minutes stretch as I wait for her response. I tell myself I'm not watching the phone, but my eyes keep drifting to the screen anyway. When it finally lights up with a simple "Okay," I feel the tension I hadn't realized I was carrying ease from my shoulders.

Miles chooses that moment to return with some documents requiring my signature. He pauses at my desk, noting my expression.

"Good news, sir?"

"Just confirming a dinner arrangement," I reply, but I can't quite keep the satisfaction from my voice.




Ian's POV

The news was playing on my phone screen, her face radiating that infuriatingly serene confidence. Serena Sinclair, her voice clear and unwavering as she delivered the final blow to my reputation.

"I believe these documents and recordings speak for themselves," she was saying, that slight smile playing at the corners of her lips. "As for Mr. Ian Whitmore and Miss Nina Sinclair, I wish them..." A perfectly timed pause. "...lasting happiness together."

The rage building inside me reached its crescendo. With a roar that seemed to come from somewhere primitive and dark, I hurled my phone at the marble floor. The crack of the screen shattering echoed through the room, followed by the tinkling sound of glass skittering across the polished surface. Each piece reflected the afternoon sunlight filtering through the heavy curtains, creating a constellation of broken light.

Evelyn flinched at the violence of the gesture. She stood pressed against the far wall, her fingers nervously twisting the pendant at her throat. "Brother... please try to calm down..."

"Shut up!" The words came out as a snarl. The social media notifications kept coming, each ping like a needle under my skin. #WhitmoreScandal was trending, along with #SinclarRevenge. The court of public opinion had already rendered its verdict.

The PR team's urgent report lay scattered across my desk, their carefully worded suggestions for damage control now meaningless. Every news outlet was running with the story, each one featuring that damning photo of Nina and me leaving the hotel, along with snippets from the recorded conversation that left no room for denial.

My phone - or what remained of it - lit up again. Father's name flashed across the spiderwebbed screen. Before I could move, the heavy double doors burst open. My father filled the doorway, his presence seeming to suck all the oxygen from the room. His face was a mask of cold fury that made even my rage seem childish in comparison.

"Ian." His voice was low, controlled, but vibrating with anger. "What have you done?"

I met his gaze, struggling to maintain some semblance of dignity. "Dad, I can explain-"

"Explain?" He crossed the room in three long strides. "Explain how you've managed to destroy not only your own reputation but potentially our entire family's standing? Explain how you let that Sinclair woman outmaneuver you so completely?"

Evelyn tried to intervene. "Father, perhaps if we-"

"Be quiet!" He rounded on her. "And you - you need to distance yourself from this mess immediately. Cancel any public appearances. No social media. Nothing that could connect you to this scandal."

The walls of the room seemed to be closing in. Outside, I could hear phones ringing throughout the office as our PR team scrambled to contain the damage. Serena had played her hand perfectly, timing the release of the evidence for maximum impact.

Father turned back to me, his voice dropping to a deadly whisper. "Listen carefully, Ian. You have exactly one chance to salvage this situation. One chance to prove you're still worthy of the Whitmore name. Fix this, or don't bother coming back to the company at all."

The door slammed behind him with enough force to make the crystal decanter on my desk rattle. In the sudden silence, I could hear my own ragged breathing, feel the pulse pounding in my temples. 

I closed my eyes, trying to center myself, but all I could see was Serena's satisfied smile at the press conference.

When I opened my eyes again, they fell on Evelyn, still hovering uncertainly by the wall. "Your phone," I said, my voice hoarse but steady. "Give it to me."

"What? Why do you-"

"Give it to me!" The words came out sharper than I intended, making her jump.
###chapter 63
Serena's POV

I was reviewing the quarterly reports when my phone vibrated against the glass surface, displaying a name that made my lips curl into a knowing smile: "Evelyn Whitmore."

Ian. Of course he'd use his sister's phone.

I let it ring twice more, using those moments to center myself. Finally, I picked up the phone and answered with deliberate calm.

"Hello, 'Evelyn.'" I infused just enough irony into the name to let him know his ruse hadn't fooled me for a second.

"You've done it now." Ian's voice trembled with barely contained rage, dropping all pretense. "You've really done it this time, Serena."

"Have I?" I leaned back in my chair, gazing out at the Manhattan skyline. "And here I thought I was just evening the playing field."

"Evening the-" He barked out a harsh laugh. "You call what you did evening the field? You destroyed everything!"

"Isn't that what you taught me to do?" I kept my voice light, almost conversational. "You were quite the instructor in destruction, as I recall."

"Don't you dare turn this around on me," he snarled. "How did you get those photos? Who's been helping you?"

I traced a finger along the edge of my desk, remembering the plain manila envelope that had appeared on my doorstep the day after the engagement disaster. "Would you believe they came from someone with a conscience? Though I suppose that's a foreign concept to you."

"Stop with the sanctimonious act. We both know you're no better than me. All those years of supposed trust and loyalty - we're cut from the same cloth, Serena."

The words hit like a slap, and I felt my carefully maintained composure crack. "Let me make something perfectly clear, Ian." My voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Don't ever presume to put us on the same level. You're right about one thing - I did trust you. I was loyal. The difference is, I actually meant it."

"The recordings," he cut in, desperation creeping into his tone. "There's no way you could have gotten those unless-"

"Unless someone was smart enough to see through you from the beginning?" I allowed myself a small smile, thinking of Lucas's foresight. "You really should be more careful about what you say in board meetings. You never know who might be listening."

The silence on the other end was telling. I could almost see him putting the pieces together, realizing just how thoroughly he'd been outmaneuvered.

"Lucas," he finally spat the name like a curse. "He's behind this, isn't he?"

"Lucas simply provided the truth you tried so hard to hide." I straightened in my chair, steel entering my voice. "Everything else - the timing, the execution - that was all me. Consider it my parting gift for all those lessons in betrayal you taught me."

"You think you've won?" His voice had gone quiet, dangerous. "This isn't over, Serena. You have no idea what's coming."

"Actually, I do." I stood. "What's coming is the consequences of your own actions. There's an old saying about sowing and reaping, Ian. I suggest you reflect on it."

"Don't you dare-"

"We're done here." I cut him off with finality. "Don't call this number again. Not even from Evelyn's phone." I ended the call before he could respond.




Nina's POV

I curled deeper into the leather sofa, surrounded by scattered tissues and the remnants of my carefully constructed image. The press conference played on repeat in my mind, each remembered flash of the cameras feeling like another stab to my dignity.

*They're probably writing their stories right now.* The thought sent a fresh wave of panic through me. I couldn't bear to check my phone, knowing what I'd find - headlines, social media posts, all of them dissecting my public breakdown. My fingers trembled as I reached for another tissue.

*Damn you, Serena.*

A knock at the door shattered my spiral of self-pity. "I said leave me alone!" I shouted, my voice cracking perfectly. The door opened anyway, and I whirled around, ready to unleash my frustration on whatever incompetent assistant had dared to disturb me.

The words died in my throat. Standing in the doorway was my grandmother, Beatrice Sinclair, with my mother Angela hovering just behind her. The sight of them instantly shifted my calculations. I let my shoulders slump further, making sure to keep my mascara-stained tissues visible.

"Grandmother..." I whispered, my voice trembling. "I'm so sorry. I've disappointed you, haven't I?" I didn't have to fake the way my hands shook - the adrenaline of opportunity coursing through me took care of that.

Beatrice's stern expression softened slightly as she stepped into the office. She'd always been my most reliable ally, especially when it came to conflicts with Serena. Mother caught my eye briefly as she closed the door behind them, and I saw the familiar glint of understanding in her gaze.

"I never meant for things to get so out of hand," I continued, dabbing at my eyes. "I just... I didn't expect Serena to humiliate me like that in front of everyone. Her own sister..." I let my voice break on the last word.

"That girl has always been trouble," Grandmother muttered, her jaw tightening. I could practically see the wheels turning in her head. This was exactly what we needed - her protective instincts activated, her existing bias against Serena reinforced.

"Maybe she's still bitter about Ian," I offered hesitantly, as if the thought had just occurred to me. "Ever since their engagement ended..." I trailed off, watching Grandmother's expression darken further.

"That's enough about her personal affairs," Grandmother cut in sharply. "Where is she now?"

I exchanged a quick glance with Mother. This was the opening we'd been waiting for. "In her office, I think. But Grandmother, please don't be too hard on her. I'm sure she didn't mean to-"

"That is my concern, not yours." Grandmother's tone brooked no argument. "Show me where."

I rose unsteadily to my feet, making sure to sway slightly so Mother had to steady me. "Of course, Grandmother. This way." As we moved toward the door, I caught Mother's subtle nod of approval.

*This is almost too easy,* I thought, leading them down the hallway toward Serena's office. The clicking of Grandmother's heels against the marble floor sounded like a countdown to victory. I could already picture Serena's face when she saw who I'd brought to her door.

We rounded the corner to find Vincent Chadwick standing guard outside Serena's office. His eyes widened slightly at the sight of us, and he stepped forward, blocking the path.

"I'm sorry, but Miss Sinclair isn't taking any visitors at the moment," he said firmly.

Grandmother drew herself up to her full height. "I am not a visitor, young man. I am Beatrice Sinclair, and that is my granddaughter's office. Step aside."
###chapter 64
Serena's POV

Vincent's protest died mid-sentence as Beatrice Sinclair swept in, her presence filling the room with a suffocating tension. Nina and Angela hovered behind her like vultures waiting for their feast.

I remained seated behind my desk, my fingers still resting on my keyboard. *So predictable*, I thought, watching them arrange themselves before me. I gave Vincent a slight nod, dismissing him. His concerned glance before closing the door didn't escape my notice.

The crack of Beatrice's palm against my cheek shattered the silence. The force of it snapped my head to the side, sending a wave of burning pain across my face. The familiar metallic taste of blood filled my mouth where my teeth had cut into my cheek.

"You ungrateful creature!" Beatrice's voice dripped with venom. "How dare you humiliate our family like this?"

The pain pulsed in rhythm with my heartbeat, but it wasn't the physical sensation that threatened to overwhelm me. It was the memories that came flooding back, triggered by that all-too-familiar sting...

*I was twelve again, standing in the mansion's dining room. Two days without food, my legs trembling as I stood in the corner. "Until you learn your place," Beatrice had said. My mother had only been gone for three months...*

*Fourteen, my ear ringing from another slap, the doctor saying the hearing loss might be temporary. Nina smirking from behind her mother's skirts...*

*Sixteen, kneeling on dried rice in the study, my knees bleeding through my uniform skirt while Beatrice lectured about family loyalty...*

The memories crystallized into a sudden, stark realization. They had never accepted us - my mother or me. The Sinclair family's façade of welcome had lasted only as long as my mother's grip on StarRiver Group. After her death, their true colors had emerged, painting my childhood in shades of cruelty and contempt.

"You're just like your mother," Beatrice spat. "Devious, Selfish-"

I reached for my phone, my movements deliberate despite my trembling hands. "I'm calling the police. I'm being physically assaulted-"

Beatrice lunged forward, snatching the phone from my grasp. "You worthless piece of-" Her words dissolved into a stream of abuse, but I barely heard them. A strange calm had settled over me, like the eye of a storm.

"Do you know what I regret most in my life?" I interrupted her tirade, my voice steady despite the throbbing in my cheek. "It's not the missed opportunities. It's not even the years of abuse I endured in your house." I stood slowly, drawing myself to my full height. "The thing I regret most is carrying the Sinclair name."

The silence that followed was absolute. Even Nina's perpetual sniffling had stopped.

"You ungrateful-" Beatrice started again, but I cut her off.

"Ungrateful?" A bitter laugh escaped my lips. "What exactly should I be grateful for? The way you treated my mother? The way you encouraged Nina to torment me? Or perhaps I should thank you for the month I spent partially deaf after one of your 'disciplinary' sessions?"

"Your mother was nothing but a social climber who-"

The words died in her throat as I slammed my hands on the desk. "Don't you dare speak about my mother." My voice had dropped to a dangerous whisper. "You never deserved to breathe the same air as her."

From my position behind the desk, I watched the silent exchange of glances between Nina and Angela. Their barely concealed smirks spoke volumes - they were enjoying the show, watching Beatrice put me in my place. 

I straightened my spine, ignoring the stinging in my cheek. "You know, Beatrice," I said, my voice carrying just a hint of amusement, "for someone who claims to care so much about the family's reputation, you're remarkably comfortable with physical assault in a corporate office."

Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "How dare you take that tone with me? You're nothing but a-"

"A what?" I interrupted, my lips curving into a cold smile. "A successful CEO? Someone who actually earned her position instead of marrying into it?"

The barb hit its mark. Beatrice's face flushed with rage as she raised her hand again. This time, I was ready. My fingers wrapped around her wrist, stopping the blow mid-arc. The shock in her eyes was almost worth the earlier slap.

"I wouldn't," I said quietly. "Once was more than enough evidence for the assault charges."

She yanked her hand free, trembling with fury. "You son of a bi-"

"Let me make something perfectly clear," I cut in, my voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "I will never set foot in the Sinclair mansion again. But don't mistake that for surrender. I'm going to initiate a full audit of the family trust."

Nina's smirk faltered. Angela's hand flew to her throat. Beatrice's face turned an interesting shade of purple.

"You have no right!" she sputtered. "You lost any claim to the family assets when you-"

"When I what?" I leaned forward, placing both hands on my desk. "When I refused to let Nina sabotage our company? When I exposed her incompetence at the press conference? Or perhaps when I dared to succeed despite your best efforts to break me?"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. I could see the wheels turning in their heads, finally realizing this wasn't going to play out according to their script.

"You're just like your mother," Beatrice spat. "She never understood her place either."

"My mother?" A quiet laugh escaped me. "My mother built this company while you were playing society wife. The only reason you treated her with any respect was because she held the purse strings. The moment she died, you showed your true colors."

The sharp rap of knuckles on wood interrupted our standoff. The door opened to reveal two uniformed police officers, their presence immediately changing the dynamic in the room.

"We received a report of assault?" the taller officer said, his experienced gaze taking in the scene.

"That would be my report," I said calmly, touching my reddened cheek. "Mrs. Beatrice Sinclair struck me during what was supposed to be a business meeting."

"This is a family matter!" Beatrice protested, but her voice had lost some of its authority.

"Assault is assault, ma'am," the second officer stated firmly. "Whether it's family or not."
###chapter 65
Serena's POV

"Ma'am," the male officer chimed in firmly, "any form of physical violence is a serious matter, regardless of family ties."

I gestured toward the ceiling. "There are security cameras in the office. Everything was recorded." My voice remained steady, though my right ear felt like it was stuffed with cotton, creating an unsettling partial silence.

Angela stepped forward, her heels clicking against the floor. "Surely we can handle this privately," she suggested, her practiced smile faltering when neither officer responded to her charm.

"We'll need you to come to the station," the female officer told Beatrice. "And Ms. Sinclair, would you like to get a medical examination?"

"Yes," I replied. My phone vibrated in my pocket-probably Lawrence or Angela's flying monkeys-but I ignored it. "I want this documented properly."

Nina lingered by the door, her expression a mixture of concern and poorly concealed satisfaction. She was probably already crafting the narrative she'd spread through her social circles.

At the hospital, the lights cast harsh shadows as the doctor examined my ear. The antiseptic smell reminded me of childhood visits after "accidents" that the family had always been so careful to explain away.

"The impact has caused temporary hearing loss," the doctor explained, her voice clinical. "There's trauma to the eardrum. This constitutes a minor injury, but it could have been much worse."

"How long until it heals?" I asked, watching her write up the report.

"Hard to say exactly. Could be days, could be weeks." She looked up from her paperwork. "You'll need to follow up with an ENT specialist."

My phone buzzed again. I glanced at the screen: three missed calls from Lawrence, two from Angela. They'd have to wait.

"I want to press charges," I told the doctor, my voice firm. The partial silence in my right ear felt like a reminder of every time I'd stayed quiet before. "I need all of this documented."

She nodded, understanding more than I'd said. As she completed the medical report, I thought about the security footage waiting in the office system. Beatrice had finally shown her true colors to people outside our gilded cage of a family. And this time, there would be consequences.

I lay in the adjustable bed, scrolling through news feeds and social media, watching the digital storm unfold with detached interest.

The internet had exploded. Every social platform was flooded with discussions about Ian and Nina, their names trending alongside particularly creative hashtags. Comments ranged from disappointed to outright vicious, with some going as far as dragging their entire family histories through the mud.

I paused on a financial news article analyzing the potential impact on both companies. The predictions were grim: consumer boycotts, plummeting stock prices, irreparable reputation damage. The Whitmore Group and StarRiver Group were both facing significant losses. I closed the article without a hint of sympathy.

My thumb hesitated over Ian's last Weibo post. The comment section had undergone a dramatic transformation. Where supporters had once gathered, critics now swarmed. The top comment-"A match made in hell"-had garnered thousands of likes.

Then I noticed something unusual: Lucas had interacted with the post. Just a simple thumbs-up emoji, but coming from his verified "Lucas Harrington, Harrington International Holdings" account, it carried weight. It was his only social media activity in months.

The comments under his response were enthusiastic:
"THE Lucas Harrington actually posted something!"
"King behavior"
"That thumbs up says everything"

I found myself smiling, imagining his expression as he made that simple gesture-probably casual, unbothered, but with that slight upward curve of his lips. The mental image came so naturally that it startled me.

When had I started paying this much attention to his reactions? When had I begun to automatically picture his expressions, anticipate his responses? This growing awareness of him was... unsettling.

My phone buzzed again-another call from Lawrence. I watched his name flash across the screen until it faded to black. 

A shadow fell across my bed, and my heart skipped-actually skipped-as I looked up to find Lucas standing in the doorway. His presence filled the room, somehow making the sterile hospital space feel warmer.

Before either of us could speak, my phone lit up again. Lawrence's name appeared on the screen, his timing as impeccable as ever.

"Had enough of this drama?" Lawrence's voice crackled through the speaker, harsh and demanding.
###chapter 66
Serena's POV

I held the phone tightly, my knuckles white against the black case. Lawrence's voice trembled with rage on the other end, each word dripping with accusation.

"You're going to regret this, Serena. Pressing charges against your own grandmother for intentional harm? Have you lost your mind?"

A cold smile tugged at my lips. "Oh? Didn't she tell you? According to her, I'm not part of the Sinclair family anymore."

"She was upset! People say things they don't mean when they're angry." His voice took on that familiar patronizing tone that made my stomach turn.

"Really?" I kept my voice level, though my free hand clenched into a fist. "So I guess I'm just upset too. Isn't that convenient?"

"That's enough!" Lawrence's voice rose sharply. "I'm still your father, and you will show some respect-"

"Respect?" The word tasted bitter. "So being an elder gives you the right to be cruel?"

I could practically see him pacing in his office, the way he always did when he lost control of a situation. "You're not listening to reason, Serena. If you pursue this-"

"You're right. I'm not listening anymore." My voice came out tired more than angry. In my mind, I could see all the times he'd taken her side, all the times he'd never asked for my version of events, never tried to understand.

"Then you'll face the consequences." His tone shifted to something harder, more threatening. "I promise you'll regret-"

The phone slipped from my grasp, but instead of falling, it was caught by a strong hand. I looked up to find Lucas standing beside me, his grey eyes dark with controlled anger as he brought the phone to his ear.

"Mr. Sinclair." His voice was deceptively calm, almost pleasant. "Why don't we discuss exactly what consequences you have in mind? And while we're at it, we can talk about whether you really think you can make charges stick against your mother, especially with my support behind Serena."

The silence on the other end was deafening. When Lawrence spoke again, his tone had undergone a remarkable transformation. "Lucas! I... this is just a family disagreement. You understand how these things can get heated-"

"I understand perfectly." Lucas's free hand found mine, his thumb brushing soothingly across my knuckles. "I'm on Serena's side. Whatever she wants, she'll have my full support. I trust that's clear enough?"

"Of... of course." Lawrence's voice had gone silky smooth, the voice he used for business deals. "Serena is lucky to have someone like you. You should both come for dinner soon. As a family."

Lucas's only response was to end the call. He set the phone down and turned to me, his expression softening. "Are you alright?"

I nodded, suddenly exhausted. "You didn't have to do that," I said quietly.

"No," he agreed, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly. "But I wanted to. And I meant every word."




Nina's POV

I watched Father's face darken as he ended the call, his knuckles white around the phone. The living room felt suffocating, thick with tension and unspoken anger.

"She's completely out of control," he muttered, pacing between the leather armchair and the window. Each step echoed his growing rage. "And now she has Lucas Harrington backing her."

I let my lower lip tremble, carefully timing the catch in my voice. "Did... did you manage to talk some sense into her, Dad?"

His glare whipped toward me, making me shrink back instinctively. Not entirely an act - Father's anger had always been frightening, even when it wasn't directed at me. "And you! What exactly have you accomplished? We had a plan, Nina. You were supposed to get close to Lucas."

"I'm trying!" I pressed my hands against my eyes, letting tears slip between my fingers. Inside, I seethed at the mention of my sister's latest triumph. Of course Serena would have Lucas Harrington defending her. She always got everything handed to her. "But she's always there, always hovering around him. I can barely get within ten feet of him without her appearing!"

"Excuses!" Father's voice rose sharply. "That's all I ever hear from you. Your sister manages to secure the most eligible bachelor in Manhattan while you can't even-"

"Lawrence." Mother's calm voice cut through his tirade like silk over steel. She placed a gentle hand on his arm, her designer bracelet catching the light. "We need to focus on what's important right now. Your mother could face serious charges."

I recognized my cue, drawing a shaky breath. "I'll do anything to help Grandmother. I'll even get on my knees and beg Serena for forgiveness if that's what it takes."

"Serena won't forgive Grandmother even if you beg her," Father said with grim certainty, his fingers drumming against his desk. "She'll just use it to humiliate you."

Mother shot me an approving glance so quick I almost missed it. "It's not Nina's fault things have gotten so complicated. If Serena hadn't been so easily manipulated by Ian Whitmore in the first place..."

I watched Father's expression shift as Mother worked her magic. She had always known exactly which strings to pull.

"That worthless Whitmore boy," Father spat. "And now she's trying to destroy this family's reputation with these ridiculous charges."

"Perhaps," Mother suggested softly, "if we focus on damage control for now... Nina can take some time to develop a new strategy with Lucas."

I dabbed at my eyes with a tissue, making sure Father caught my expression of desperate determination. "I won't let you down again, Daddy. I promise."

"Fine." He ran a hand through his hair, tension still radiating from his shoulders. "But first, we need to handle this situation with your grandmother. She'll have to apologize to Serena."

"Will Grandmother agree to that?" I asked softly, though I already knew the answer.

"She'll have to agree." Father's voice was hard with suppressed rage. "Otherwise, her only other option is prison!"
###chapter 67
Serena's POV

Lucas handed me my phone with a gentleness that seemed at odds with his usual commanding presence.

"Thank you," I said quietly, accepting the device without meeting his eyes. The familiar weight of it in my hands brought little comfort - it was just another possession, like everything else in my life that could be taken away at a moment's notice.

I watched as Lucas picked up my medical chart, his fingers moving with the practiced efficiency of someone used to analyzing complex documents. His expression remained neutral until he reached a particular page, where his brow furrowed slightly.

"Your right ear..." he paused, and I could hear the careful control in his voice. "It's temporary?"

"Yes." I kept my tone even, matter-of-fact. "Nothing to worry about."

But Lucas didn't move on as I'd hoped. Instead, he stayed on that page, his finger resting on what I knew was the detailed description of my symptoms. I could see the slight tension in his shoulders, the way his jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

"It happened before," I found myself saying, surprising even myself with the admission. "When I was young."

His hands stilled on the chart. "Did it hurt?"

A bitter smile touched my lips before I could stop it. "More then than now." I looked down at my hands, perfectly still in my lap. "When you're small, you can't fight back. But I'm not that helpless little girl anymore. People can't hurt me so easily now."

The silence that followed felt heavy with unspoken understanding. I glanced up to find Lucas watching me, his grey eyes filled with an intensity that made my chest tighten. His fingers twitched slightly - a tell I'd started to recognize when something affected him more than he wanted to show.

"Could you..." I gestured toward the fruit basket on the bedside table, desperate to break the moment before it became too much. "Would you mind peeling an apple?"

"Of course." The relief in his voice was subtle but present as he set aside the chart and reached for the fruit. "Any particular way you prefer it?"

"Like last time," I said softly, watching his hands as he picked up the small knife. His fingers were long and elegant, unmarked by the kind of calluses my father's golf-playing friends usually had. "The one you peeled before was sweet."

Lucas worked in silence, the peel coming off in one continuous spiral. I found myself mesmerized by the methodical movement of his hands, the careful way he removed every trace of the skin without wasting any of the flesh beneath. It was such a simple thing, yet it spoke volumes about his character - precise, thorough, considerate.

The apple slice balanced delicately on my fork. Before I could take a bite, Lucas leaned forward slightly. "May I try some?"

I extended the fork automatically, then hesitated, suddenly aware of the intimacy of the gesture. But before I could withdraw, his fingers wrapped gently around my wrist, holding it steady. My breath caught as he took the apple directly from the fork, his eyes never leaving mine.

"Sweet," he said casually, as if he hadn't just made my heart race with such a simple action. I forced myself to remain still, though every nerve in my body hummed with awareness of his touch, still warm on my wrist.

The silence stretched between us, filled with unspoken words. I focused on steadying my breathing, pretending to be absorbed in selecting another piece of apple.

"When are you planning to leave the hospital?" Lucas finally asked, his voice breaking through the tension.

I managed a light smile, grateful for the change in subject. "I could leave anytime, but I think I'll stay a couple more days."

"The day after tomorrow is my birthday," he said quietly, watching my reaction.

"I remember." I met his gaze steadily. "I'll be there for dinner. On time."

"I'll be waiting." The simple statement carried more weight than it should have.

As evening settled in, casting long shadows across the room, I tried to dismiss him. "You should head home. I'll be fine."

"I'm staying." His tone left no room for argument. "I'll sit right here."

"Lucas..."

"When I was in the hospital," he interrupted, "you came to take care of me often."

"That was different," I reminded him. "You were there because of me."

A slight smile curved his lips. "I always repay my debts generously."

I could have argued further, pointed out that he owed me nothing, that I was used to being alone. But something in his expression made me hold back. Perhaps it would hurt him to be sent away.

So I turned onto my side, facing away from him, and closed my eyes. The soft sound of his breathing mixed with the distant hospital noises, strangely comforting in the growing darkness.

Just before sleep claimed me, I heard him shift in his chair, followed by a whisper so quiet I might have imagined it: "If only I had known back then..."


I hadn't meant to actually fall asleep. Using sleep as an excuse to make Lucas leave was one thing, but genuinely drifting off with someone else in the room? That wasn't like me at all. Yet here I was, blinking awake in the dim hospital room, momentarily disoriented by the shadows playing across the ceiling.

As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I turned my head to find Lucas asleep on the small couch, his tall frame awkwardly compressed to fit the limited space. The sight triggered a memory of when our positions were reversed - when I was the one watching over him in a hospital room, guilt gnawing at my conscience because he'd been injured protecting me.

He looked uncomfortable, his long legs hanging off the edge of the couch. Without thinking, I slipped out of bed, moving as quietly as possible toward the spare blanket folded at the foot of my bed. The floor was cold against my bare feet, and I had to pause for a moment to steady myself.

Just as I reached out to drape the blanket over him, his eyes snapped open. I froze, blanket still suspended in mid-air.

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"

Before I could finish the sentence, his hand shot out and grabbed my wrist. In one fluid motion, he pulled me forward. I lost my balance, falling against his chest as he twisted, somehow managing to flip our positions until I found myself trapped beneath him on the narrow couch.

My first instinct was to push him away, to scramble free from this compromising position. But when I looked up, ready to protest, the intensity in his eyes made the words die in my throat. My heart hammered against my ribs, and I was acutely aware of every point where our bodies touched.

He lowered his head toward my right ear, saying something I couldn't hear. The irony of my temporary deafness choosing this moment to matter wasn't lost on me. His weight pressed me deeper into the couch cushions, making it difficult to breathe - though I wasn't sure if that was from the physical pressure or the emotional tension crackling between us.

"Wake up," I finally managed to whisper, though part of me wondered if I was talking to him or myself.

"What did I do?" His voice was rough with sleep, but his eyes were alert now, taking in our position with dawning comprehension.

I almost laughed at the question. At least he was aware enough to know he had done something, rather than accusing me of putting myself in this situation. The thought gave me the strength to find my voice again.

"You're crushing me," I said, aiming for a matter-of-fact tone despite the heat rising in my cheeks.
###chapter 68
Serena's POV

"Please get up." I tried to keep my voice steady, fighting against the nervous flutter in my chest. The weight of Lucas's body pressed against mine, his breath warm against my neck.

The silence in the hospital room felt oppressive, broken only by the steady tick of the wall clock and the distant hum of medical equipment. Lucas immediately moved away, his usual grace momentarily abandoned as he stood up, running a hand through his disheveled hair.

"I'll be right back," he muttered, his voice hoarse as he strode toward the bathroom, leaving me alone with my racing thoughts.

I sat up slowly, my fingers unconsciously smoothing the wrinkles of my patient gown. The ghost of his touch lingered on my skin, and I forced myself to take deep breaths, trying to calm my thundering heart. This was Lucas Harrington - father to Milo and Stella. I couldn't afford to let my guard down, no matter how my body had responded to his proximity.

The sound of running water from the bathroom gave way to footsteps, and I found myself staring intently at the floor as he returned. Despite my best efforts, my eyes flickered briefly to his composed figure, and I felt heat creep up my neck when I caught him watching me.

"What exactly... did I do?" Lucas asked, his deep voice carefully controlled.

I cleared my throat, aiming for a casual tone that I didn't quite feel. "You were sleeping. I thought you might be cold, so I was putting a blanket over you. Then you just... sort of grabbed me. Like sleepwalking."

His jaw tightened slightly. "I apologize. I didn't mean to..." He paused, and I noticed a faint flush creeping up his neck. "Sometimes these things are... difficult to control. I hope I haven't made you too uncomfortable."

The hint of amusement in his voice when he apologized made something twist in my stomach. Was this routine for him? How many women had he charmed with this act of the accidentally passionate businessman?

"Only with you," he said softly, his blue eyes intense as they met mine. "I've only ever been this... intimate with you, Serena."

My heart skipped a beat before rationality kicked in. I almost laughed at the line - it was almost too perfect, too practiced. Besides, he had two children. Clearly, he'd been intimate with at least one other woman. 

"It's fine," I said briskly, standing up and smoothing my skirt. "We should both get some rest. It's been a long day."

But as I turned away, I couldn't quite ignore the way my skin still tingled where he'd touched me, or how his gaze seemed to follow my every movement. I told myself it was just physical attraction - natural, but dangerous. I had too much at stake to let myself be swayed by rehearsed lines and magnetic grey eyes, no matter how convincing they might be.

A soft knock at the door interrupted the lingering tension between Lucas and me. Miles entered with dinner, his movements careful and precise as he arranged the containers on the small hospital table. The rich aroma of food filled the room, momentarily displacing the sterile hospital smell.

"Miles, join us for dinner," I said, noticing how he was already backing toward the door. "There's too much here for just the two of us."

Miles froze mid-step, his eyes darting instinctively to Lucas. I caught the slight tightening of Lucas's jaw - clearly, he'd been hoping for a private dinner. Well, too bad. After our earlier... incident, I needed a buffer.

"Don't let it go to waste," I added firmly, using my CEO voice. That seemed to do the trick. Miles pulled up a chair, though he sat perched on the edge like he might need to flee at any moment.

The meal proceeded in awkward silence, broken only by the quiet clink of utensils. I used the time to compose a mental list of everything I needed to check on at StarRiver. Having Lucas hover over me all day hadn't exactly been conducive to work.

"You should go home," I told Lucas once we'd finished eating. "Milo and Stella will be wondering where you are."

He studied my face for a long moment, and I kept my expression neutral. Finally, he nodded, though reluctance was written in every line of his body as he stood.

"Call me if you need anything," he said, his voice low and intense. "Anything at all."

I waited until his footsteps faded down the hallway before letting out a long breath. The room suddenly felt larger, less suffocating. I pulled out my phone and started making calls.

"The new collection's sales figures?" I asked Wesley Morgan, our sales director. His response made me sit up straighter.

"Up 300% from last week? Are you certain?"

The good news continued. Caleb Reed from Purchasing reported that our main suppliers had suddenly become much more flexible about payment terms. Amazing how a surge in sales could change people's attitudes so quickly.

I was just finishing my last call when my phone buzzed with a social media notification. Eleanor had posted again, and I found myself smiling as I read through the supportive comments from her fans. The crisis seemed to be well and truly over - her reputation was bouncing back even faster than our sales figures.

Then I saw her latest post: "Need gift suggestions for a special man's birthday! He's sophisticated, successful, and impossible to shop for. Help a girl out? 🎁"

My finger hovered over the screen as an uncomfortable sensation settled in my stomach. Lucas's birthday was coming up. The phone suddenly felt heavy in my hand.
###chapter 69
Serena's POV

I stared out the car window as Ethan navigated through the evening traffic, my fingers fidgeting with the hem of my white dress. Several times I'd spotted gift shops along our route, each one a reminder of my failure to buy Lucas a birthday present. But what was the point? Tonight wasn't about celebrating - it was about getting answers.

"Ms. Sinclair, we're almost there," Ethan's voice came through the rearview mirror, professional as always. I caught his brief glance and wondered if he could sense my unease.

The towering glass building came into view, its sleek facade reflecting the city lights. As Ethan pulled up to the entrance, my heart skipped a beat - there was Lucas, cutting an imposing figure in a perfectly tailored black suit. The sight of him made me instantly regret my casual choice of attire. My simple white dress and soft curls seemed woefully inadequate next to his formal wear.

"Am I late?" I asked softly as I approached him, trying to mask my discomfort.

Lucas shook his head, his eyes lingering on my dress. "Right on time." His voice carried its usual quiet authority, but something in his expression shifted - so subtle I almost missed it.

The elevator ride should have been brief, but time seemed to stretch in the confined space. I watched, caught off guard, as Lucas suddenly removed his jacket.

"Hold this for me?" he asked, handing me both his jacket and bow tie. Before I could respond, he was rolling up his sleeves with precise, deliberate movements. The stark white dress shirt, now open at the collar, transformed his appearance from formal to casually elegant. The exposed skin of his forearms drew my unwanted attention.

The realization hit me like a physical blow - he was adjusting his appearance to match mine. The gesture, so thoughtful and unnecessary, made guilt surge through me.

I clutched his jacket tighter, the expensive fabric a reminder of everything that stood between us. The faint scent of his cologne drifted up, and I forced myself to focus on why I was really here. Eleanor Yates deserved the truth, and so did I.

The elevator continued its smooth ascent toward Le Jardin, each floor bringing us closer to a conversation that would change everything. I kept my eyes fixed on the illuminated floor numbers, acutely aware of Lucas's presence beside me, and the weight of unspoken words between us.

Just as the elevator passed the thirtieth floor, Lucas spoke again, his voice carrying a hint of amusement. "You look beautiful tonight, Serena." The simple compliment landed like a punch to my chest. How could he make this even harder?

I managed a small smile but couldn't bring myself to meet his eyes. 

The massive double doors of the VIP room swung open, revealing a space that took my breath away. Sparkling crystal fixtures cast a warm glow over dark wood panels and floor-to-ceiling windows that framed the city's glittering skyline. But what really stopped me in my tracks wasn't the luxurious décor - it was the group of well-dressed men lounging at the elaborately set table.

Lucas's hand remained steady at my back as he guided me forward. "Let me introduce you to my friends," he said, his voice carrying that quiet authority I'd come to know so well. "You already know Jace, my uncle."

I nodded politely to Jace, who returned the gesture with his characteristic reserve. My mind was spinning, trying to process this unexpected gathering when I'd prepared myself for a confrontation.

"Drew," Lucas continued, gesturing to a man with friendly features who started to step forward. I caught Lucas's subtle head shake, stopping Drew's movement before it began.

"We went to the same school!" Drew's enthusiasm bubbled over anyway. "You probably don't remember, but I was a year ahead of you in high school."

Before I could respond, Lucas moved on smoothly. "And Spencer."

The tall, model-handsome man gave me a playful grin. "Miss Sinclair, you're even more stunning than at the press conference."

"Thank you," I managed, maintaining my composure. "You're quite handsome yourself." I kept my tone light and professional, even as I noticed the challenging glint in his eye when he glanced at Lucas.

Lucas leaned closer, his voice dropping for my ears alone. "They're old friends, but I've spent most of my time abroad. This is my first birthday celebration in Manhattan, so they insisted on joining." His tone carried a hint of wry amusement. "Don't mind them too much."

I clutched his jacket and bow tie closer, suddenly aware I was still holding them. The casual intimacy of carrying his clothes while surrounded by his friends made my cheeks warm. But before I could hand them back or voice any of the thoughts tumbling through my mind, a familiar voice cut through the room.

"Started without me? How could you!"

Eleanor stood in the doorway, holding an elaborate bouquet. My stomach dropped as I watched her make her entrance, all perfectly timed drama and sparkle.
###chapter 70
Eleanor's POV

As I pushed open the heavy wooden door, the scene before me was exactly what I'd expected - everyone already gathered around the elaborately set table, wine glasses gleaming.

"Started without me? I'm wounded!" I announced dramatically, pressing a hand to my chest. "The party can't possibly begin before the star arrives."

Drew's laugh rang out from his seat near Lucas. "You heard her - nobody dared touch their utensils before Eleanor the Great made her entrance."

I flashed him a playful smile, appreciating his quick wit. The room felt warm and intimate, perfect for Lucas's birthday celebration. Making my way around the table, I caught the subtle notes of expensive wine mingling with the restaurant's signature truffle dishes.

Moving to Lucas, I wrapped my arms around his neck from behind. "Happy birthday, you impossible man." I could feel him stiffen slightly at the contact. From my peripheral vision, I noticed Serena shift almost imperceptibly in her seat.

"And what's this?" Lucas asked dryly, eyeing the elaborate bouquet I'd brought. "Trying to turn my birthday into a garden show?"

I straightened up, affecting an injured expression. "I'll have you know each flower was personally selected and arranged by yours truly. One of a kind, just like my affection for you." I paused for dramatic effect. "Though clearly wasted on someone who wouldn't know a rare orchid from a dandelion."

"If you're hoping to guilt me into appreciation, you might want to try something more substantial than flowers," Lucas remarked, but I didn't miss how his gaze lingered on the arrangement after I mentioned hand-picking them.

Noting Serena's slightly tense posture, I pivoted smoothly. "Serena, darling, would you mind giving me your expert opinion?" I leaned closer to her. "Is my new perfume as divine as I think it is?"

Her eyes lit up with genuine interest as she caught the scent. "Royal Chamber's Premium Rose? It's gorgeous on you."

"I knew you'd recognize it!" I beamed, genuinely impressed. "Your taste is as impeccable as ever. I was particularly struck by how you handled that press conference last week - absolute masterclass in grace under pressure."

"Where's Quinn?" I asked Spencer, scanning the familiar faces around the table. "Shouldn't she be here?"

Before Spencer could respond, Drew jumped in with a laugh, "When have you ever seen Quinn at any of Spencer's gatherings?"

I felt irritation flare in my chest. "Then why did he marry her in the first place?" The words came out sharper than I'd intended, but I didn't care.

Drew just shrugged helplessly, clearly indicating he had no answer either.

Spencer's response was casual, almost dismissive, accompanied by a smile that made my blood boil. "Political marriage. You know how it works, right?"

"Men are pigs," I spat out, disgust evident in my voice.

Despite my close relationship with this group through my Lucas, there was no question where my loyalties lay when it came to Quinn and Spencer's marriage. I stood firmly in Quinn's corner, both feet planted. These guys might be my friends, but that didn't mean I had to approve of everything they did.

The shift in atmosphere was palpable as we discussed Quinn's situation. My earlier playfulness evaporated, replaced by genuine anger. The statement hung in the air, heavy with meaning. I caught Serena's thoughtful expression.

Looking around the table, I had to admit that if it weren't for knowing Serena would be here, I probably wouldn't have bothered spending my evening with this group of businessmen. 

Drew's animated voice cut through the gentle clinking of wine glasses. "Now that's not fair!" he protested, straightening in his chair. "We're different. Take Lucas here - he's been completely devoted to raising his kids, not a single scandal all these years. And Jace? The man's so pure he doesn't even have a girlfriend. As for me..." He placed a hand dramatically over his heart. "I may be surrounded by beauty, but I remain untouched, like a diamond in the rough
."

Eleanor let out an elegant snort, rolling her eyes. "Please."

"Eleanor Yates, you're getting way too disrespectful of your big brothers!" Drew wagged his finger at her playfully.

"You can't even outdrink me," Eleanor shot back, a challenging glint in her eye.

"Oh, that's it!" Drew slammed his palm on the table, though his eyes sparkled with amusement. "If you don't end up begging for mercy tonight, I'll change my last name!"

"Sure, you can take mine. 'Drew Yates' has a nice ring to it, don't you think?"

I couldn't help but smile at their banter. The warm lighting of the private room cast a gentle glow over the scene, making everything feel intimate and comfortable. Then Eleanor turned to me, her eyes bright.

"Serena, come on, join us!"

"She doesn't drink," Lucas's voice cut in before I could respond, firm and brooking no argument.

Eleanor's expression flickered. "Why not?"

"She just doesn't," Lucas repeated, his tone final.

I could sense Eleanor's mood shift slightly, a shadow passing over her previously playful demeanor. Wanting to ease the sudden tension, I quickly explained, "I actually injured my ear recently. Doctor's orders - no alcohol for now."

"Your ear?" Eleanor's expression immediately transformed to one of concern. "What happened?"

"It's nothing serious," I assured her with a smile. "Should be fine in a few days. I'm just sorry I can't join your drinking contest. And I never properly thanked you for your support back then."

The sparkle returned to Eleanor's eyes as she turned back to Drew. "Well then, it's just you and me. I won't rest until you're crying for mercy!"

I watched their interaction, noting Eleanor's transparent emotions and genuine nature. There was something touching about her straightforward approach to life and relationships. I wondered if it was this very innocence that made her trust Lucas so completely.

Jace smoothly intervened before the drinking contest could escalate too far, expertly redirecting the conversation. As the evening wore on, Eleanor suddenly turned to me, her eyes clear and sincere despite the wine she'd consumed.

"Serena, I really like you, you know that?"

The simple declaration caught me off guard, creating an unexpected warmth in my chest. There was something disarming about her honesty, so different from the calculated interactions I was used to in the business world.
###chapter 71
Serena's POV

I felt a strange mix of warmth and unease as Eleanor leaned across the table, her eyes bright with sincerity despite the slight flush from the wine. "Quinn is my best friend, no one else comes close..." She paused, then broke into a wide smile. "Well, except you now, Serena. You're also my best friend."

The sudden declaration caught me off guard. I could sense Eleanor's genuine feelings toward me. Her sincerity was precisely what made my emotions so complicated and conflicted. My chest felt tight whenever I thought about it.
I turned to glance at Lucas, who was politely managing his drinks throughout the evening. 
Tonight. The words that needed to be said couldn't wait any longer.
As the dinner drew to a close, everyone was in high spirits. The wine had loosened the atmosphere considerably, and Drew was absolutely insistent about continuing the evening with some jazz performances.
Before I could voice any objection, our entire group was already heading to the luxurious entertainment club on the sixteenth floor. 
Lucas must have noticed my discomfort. "If you're bored, I can take you home," he offered quietly. When I shook my head, his eyes softened. "I want you to know more about... my life."

That made me pause. There was something vulnerable in the way he said it, like he was offering more than just a glimpse into his social circle.

When the doors opened to the VIP room, I had to admit I was impressed. Though compact, the space was meticulously designed - all gleaming surfaces and subtle lighting that made everything feel intimate yet luxurious.

"What song do you want? I'll queue it for you!" Eleanor called out, already comfortable on one of the plush sofas. Her enthusiasm was infectious, even as I noticed Jace slip out to the restroom for the third time, his face notably pale.

"Don't drink too much," I warned Eleanor, watching her reach for another glass. "You'll feel awful tomorrow."


Eleanor nodded in agreement, but her body language told a different story as she gravitated toward Lucas. As I stood up to select a song, I caught sight of her practically collapsing against Lucas's shoulder.

Lucas steadied her with a reflexive motion. Though his expression flickered with annoyance, he didn't push her away.

I hesitated for a moment, my fingers unconsciously touching the delicate chain around my neck. Then, squaring my shoulders, I made my way to center stage. Taking my place at the microphone, I began singing while the jazz band improvised an accompaniment. The vocalist stepped to the side, providing backup harmonies.

The familiar melody of the song flowed through me, but my attention kept drifting to the scene I'd left behind. Each note carried the weight of emotions I was trying to process - frustration, uncertainty, and something else I wasn't quite ready to name.

As I sang, time seemed to slow down. The dim lights of the VIP room faded away, and I lost myself in the lyrics of "Unfaithful." I barely registered the others' presence until the final note faded, and sudden applause jolted me back to reality.

"You should've been a singer!" Eleanor's excited voice cut through my daze. "You're even better than me!"

I felt heat rise to my cheeks, unused to being the center of attention in this group. Drew's eyes narrowed thoughtfully as he glanced between Lucas and me. "Nice singing, Serena, but those lyrics... are you trying to say something?"

"What are you talking about?!" Eleanor straightened up from where she'd been leaning against Lucas, her voice sharp despite her drunken state. "It's just a song! You don't think Lucas is the third wheel, do you?"

The irony of her defense made my chest tighten. I watched as Lucas remained silent, his usual composed expression softened by alcohol, a slight flush coloring his cheeks. He looked more approachable than ever, and that somehow made everything harder.

Singing with people I barely knew suddenly felt suffocating. This would probably be the last time I'd be here with them, I realized. The thought brought a strange mix of sadness and resolution.

The night wore on, with Eleanor and Drew taking turns at increasingly enthusiastic performances. I stayed in my corner, watching Lucas's profile in the shifting lights. The slight flush on his face deepened as the evening progressed, his usually sharp eyes taking on a dreamy quality I'd never seen before.

"Let me take you home," Lucas said finally, his voice carrying a gentleness that alcohol had unleashed.

I took a deep breath. It was now or never. "Lucas, I need to talk to you."
###chapter 72
Serena's POV

I could feel my heart pounding as I looked at Lucas across the dimly lit room. The warm glow from the crystal pendant lights softened his features, making him appear more striking than usual.

"Let's end this here," I said, forcing the words past my lips. The statement hung heavy in the air between us.

Lucas's fingers tightened almost imperceptibly around his glass. His expression shifted, the warmth draining from his eyes, though his voice remained carefully controlled. "What did I do wrong?"

The gentleness in his restraint made my chest ache. Even now, he was trying not to frighten me away. I drew a steadying breath. "I've told you before - I won't be falling in love with any man again. I've rejected your advances multiple times..."

"Serena Sinclair." The use of my full name cut through my prepared speech. His blue eyes fixed on mine with an intensity that made me want to look away. "Give me one reason that will make me give up."

The formality in his tone felt like a physical blow. I hadn't realized how much I'd grown used to the way he usually said my name, warm and intimate. Now I could see I'd truly hurt him.

"You should know," I began carefully, "that despite my... reputation, in the three years I was with Ian, we never went beyond holding hands and hugging." I met his gaze directly. "I have my principles about physical intimacy before marriage."

Lucas leaned forward slightly. "Is that what disappoints you about me?" There was something in his voice - a willingness to change, to accommodate - that made this even more painful.

"It's about Eleanor," I said quietly. The name seemed to thicken the air between us. "She's a good person, Lucas. Cheerful, kind-hearted, sincere. You should consider what you have with her." I forced myself to continue, though each word felt like swallowing glass. "Milo and Stella need a mother figure."

For a moment, he was silent. Then, "She's not bad, that's true."

Four simple words. They shouldn't have had the power to make my heart feel like it was being crushed. I kept my expression neutral, even as I felt something inside me crack. The soft lighting that had seemed intimate moments ago now felt like it was highlighting every micro-expression I was trying to hide.

I told myself this was what I wanted. This was the right thing to do. But I couldn't help wondering why doing the right thing felt so much like making a terrible mistake.

The ache in my chest was familiar - an old friend I'd learned to ignore. After everything I'd been through, heartbreak had lost its sharp edges. Whatever was growing between Lucas and me wasn't deep enough to leave lasting scars. At least, that's what I kept telling myself.

"So you're stepping aside for her?" Lucas's voice carried an edge I'd never heard before, cutting through my thoughts.

I maintained my composure, forcing a gentle smile. "It's not about Eleanor. You two are well-matched, and I genuinely wish you happiness. We can all be friends - Eleanor, you, and me."

"Friends?" He nearly spat the word. "You think I need another friend, Serena?"

"Then... goodbye, Lucas." I turned to leave, my movements deliberately steady despite my racing heart.

"You're really something, aren't you?" His words dripped with icy sarcasm. "Always so damn composed."

I hesitated, my thoughts drifting to Milo and Stella. If there was any regret in this situation, it was leaving these sweet kids. But before I could take another step, Lucas's hand shot out, gripping my wrist with surprising force.

"What kind of man do you think I am?" The raw anger in his voice made me flinch.

Everything happened too fast. He yanked me toward him, and I collided with his chest, the impact sending a sharp pain through my nose. The familiar scent of his sandalwood cologne mingled with whiskey, making my head spin. Then his lips found my earlobe, teeth grazing the sensitive skin.

"Lucas, stop-" I tried to push away, my nails digging into his arms. But he only held me tighter, his embrace a contradiction of punishment and desperation, like a man terrified of losing something he'd only just found.

The warmth of his body against mine felt dangerous, awakening feelings I'd been desperately trying to suppress. His heartbeat thundered against my cheek, matching the frantic rhythm of my own. This wasn't the controlled, sophisticated Lucas Harrington I knew. This was someone else - someone raw and honest and frightening in his intensity.

Time seemed to stretch and compress all at once in that moment, the outside world fading until all that existed was the sound of our ragged breathing and the desperate grip of his hands.
###chapter 73
Serena's POV

A wave of heat rushed to my cheeks as Lucas pulled me closer. His breath was warm against my ear, and I found myself torn between wanting to pull away and staying exactly where I was. My heart hadn't quite settled from our earlier conversation when the door suddenly burst open.

"Oh my God! I'm so sorry!" Eleanor's voice pierced through the intimate atmosphere. She stood in the doorway, her eyes wide with genuine panic. "I really just needed to use the bathroom! I didn't mean to-I'll just-"

My body tensed instantly. Of all people to walk in, it had to be her. I tried to step back, but Lucas's arm remained firmly around my waist. The mortification was overwhelming - I could practically feel my ears burning red.

"Come here," Lucas commanded, his voice carrying that unmistakable tone of authority that seemed to make everyone comply. Eleanor hesitated for a moment before stepping forward, her designer heels clicking against the floor.

I kept my eyes fixed on the ground, wishing I could disappear. The silence felt suffocating until Lucas spoke again.

"What do you call my grandfather?" he asked Eleanor, his voice steady and deliberate.

"Grandpa Howard..." Eleanor replied, her voice small but clear.

My head snapped up at this exchange, a slight tremor running through my body. Lucas's thumb traced gentle circles on my back, a subtle gesture of reassurance.

"And what does that make us?" Lucas pressed on, his voice taking on an almost amused tone.

Eleanor's response came with an awkward laugh. "Well... you're my brother, technically. Though you never let me forget the 'older' part."

The realization hit me like a wave. I buried my face deeper into Lucas's chest, beyond embarrassed at my earlier assumptions. The silk of his shirt was cool against my burning cheeks, and I could feel the slight vibration of his chuckle.

"Now you understand?" Lucas murmured, his words meant only for me. I managed a small nod, still refusing to lift my head. The embarrassment was so intense I could probably carve out a whole apartment in it.

Eleanor's voice cut through the air, filled with jest. "Brother, what's going on with you two?"

BROTHER. The word echoed in my mind as I struggled to process its implications. Before I could fully grasp the situation, Lucas's voice took on an amused tone.

"Actually, she thought you and I were-"

Panic shot through me. I instinctively slapped my hand over his mouth, desperate to prevent him from revealing my embarrassing assumption. The last thing I needed was for Eleanor to know how badly I had misinterpreted things.

I felt Lucas's lips curve into a smile against my palm, the sensation sending an unexpected shiver down my spine. When his lips brushed deliberately against my hand in what felt distinctly like a kiss, I yanked my hand away as if burned, my face flooding with heat.

Lucas's eyes danced with barely contained laughter as he turned to Eleanor. "Aren't you leaving?" His tone carried an unmistakable authority that made his sister straighten up immediately.

"Right, I'll just..." Eleanor backed toward the door, a knowing smile playing at her lips. "I'll see you both later."

Once the door clicked shut behind her, Lucas turned his full attention back to me. The amusement in his expression had been replaced by something more serious, more searching.

"Why would you think I was involved with Eleanor?" he asked, his voice soft but intent. "More importantly, why would you think I'm the kind of person who would pursue you while being with someone else?"

I twisted the hem of my dress between my fingers, unable to meet his gaze. The fabric wrinkled under my nervous fidgeting, but I couldn't stop. How could I explain that Ian's words had planted seeds of doubt? That my own insecurities had let those seeds take root?

"I..." I started, then faltered. The truth felt too revealing, too vulnerable. Lucas waited patiently, his presence both comforting and unnerving.
###chapter 74
Serena's POV

The usual warmth in Lucas's grey eyes had been replaced by something darker, more intense. When he finally spoke, his low voice carried an edge I'd never heard before.

"So this is why you've been keeping me at arm's length all this time?" The formal address stung more than it should have. "This is why you've repeatedly pushed me away? Why you didn't even prepare a birthday gift for me today?"

The hurt underlying his controlled tone made my chest tighten. I opened my mouth to respond, but what could I say? That I'd let my insecurities and past experiences color my perception of him? That I'd been so afraid of being hurt again that I'd created problems where none existed?

"I..." My voice wavered, and I forced myself to meet his gaze. "I made assumptions without..."

"Never mind," he interrupted, his shoulders suddenly relaxing as he let out a quiet sigh. "The misunderstanding has been cleared up. That's enough."

The abrupt shift in his demeanor caught me off guard. I found myself lost in thought about Lucas's inexplicable indulgence - or perhaps "doting" was a better word. Every time I expected him to draw a line, to finally show some limit to his patience, he simply... didn't.

What could have possibly sparked such intense feelings as we first meet? There was nothing special about that encounter that would warrant this level of affection.

Yet here he was, showing a degree of tolerance that seemed to know no bounds. The more I thought about it, the more puzzled I became. What exactly had drawn him to me? What mysterious element had kindled these emotions that seemed so disproportionate to our brief acquaintance?

I stole a glance at his profile against the city lights. The question nagged at me, like a puzzle piece that refused to fit.
A small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth, softening his features. "Besides," he added, his voice taking on a warmer tone, "today hasn't been without its pleasant surprises."

I stared at him, trying to decipher the meaning behind his words and that enigmatic expression. "What do you mean?" I finally asked, my curiosity getting the better of me.

I found myself puzzled by his statement. Was it because we'd finally cleared up our misunderstanding? Because he no longer had to guess at the reason behind my sudden emotional distance? I could sense it - Lucas's cautious approach with me, like walking on eggshells.


Lucas's grey eyes held a glimmer of something that made me want to look away. His satisfaction was practically radiating off him as he spoke, his voice carrying an unmistakable note of masculine pride.

"You and Ian... there was nothing between you." 

I had been feeling guilty, but his words suddenly sparked a flash of exasperated embarrassment. Men really were all the same - such... fixated
virginity desires!

"Let's go. I'll take you home," he said, reaching for my hand with casual confidence, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.

My first instinct was to pull away, but the memory of my earlier accusations stayed my hand. Then it struck me - was this why he wouldn't let me apologize? Making me feel too guilty to refuse his sudden familiarity? The more I thought about it, the more convinced I became that this calculating man was using the situation to his advantage.

Truly, successful businessmen were always calculating, weren't they?

His fingers were warm against mine, and I found myself reluctantly allowing the contact. 

I glanced through the glass walls toward the main area where the birthday celebration was still in full swing. Making a decision I hoped I wouldn't regret, I said, "Let's stay a bit longer. They don't seem done celebrating yet. And I don't have work tomorrow anyway."

"Mm." Just one syllable, but the satisfaction in his voice was unmistakable. The slight upturn of his lips told me everything I needed to know about how pleased he was with my suggestion.
###chapter 75
Serena's POV

The warmth of alcohol lingered on my cheeks as Eleanor and I settled into the corner of the VIP room. The rest of the party continued in full swing, but my mind kept drifting back to what had happened in the hallway with Lucas.

"So," Eleanor leaned closer, her dress catching the dim light, "what exactly did my brother do to you out there?"

"Nothing!" I answered too quickly, feeling the heat rise in my face.

She raised an eyebrow, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "Really? Because he seems different since you both came back. He was barely touching his drink before, but now look at him." She gestured toward Lucas, who was actually engaging in conversation with Drew across the room.

I tried to keep my expression neutral, but Eleanor's sharp eyes caught the slight tremor in my hand as I reached for my glass. "And what's that on his arm?" she asked, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Those look suspiciously like scratch marks. You know, the good-looking ones are always the best at..."

"Eleanor!" Lucas's deep voice cut through our conversation like a blade.

She jumped up with exaggerated alarm, nearly spilling her drink. "Oh! Would you look at that? I suddenly remembered where the bathroom is!" She scurried away, leaving me alone with my burning cheeks and racing heart.

Lucas moved to take her vacant seat, his presence both comforting and unnerving. The party around us had begun to wind down, the energy shifting as the clock ticked past midnight. Drew was attempting to lead another drinking game, but even his enthusiasm had started to fade.

"We should go," Lucas said softly, his voice carrying only to me.

I glanced at the others, still caught up in their revelry. "What about them?"

"They'll outlast us," he replied with a slight smile. When I hesitated, he added, "It's past midnight now. My birthday's officially over, which means I'm no longer obligated to stay."

Something in his tone made me look at him more closely. Despite the lateness of the hour, his grey eyes were clear and focused. The same eyes that had looked at me with such intensity in the hallway. I quickly pushed that thought away before my blush could deepen.

"Okay," I agreed, gathering my clutch.

As we stood to leave, I caught Eleanor watching us from across the room. She gave me an exaggerated wink that made me want to sink into the floor. But then I felt Lucas's hand, light but steady at the small of my back, guiding me toward the door. The touch was proper, barely there, yet it sent a shiver up my spine.

In that moment, I realized something had shifted between us. The carefully maintained distance that had always existed was beginning to crumble, and I wasn't sure if I was ready for what lay on the other side of that wall.

Drew's voice carried after us as we left: "Hey, birthday boy! Leaving so soon?"

"Some of us have real work tomorrow," Lucas called back, his tone carrying a friendly warning that prevented any further protest.



Eleanor's POV

I headed for the outside restroom since Drew seemed to have commandeered our private one.

That lightweight-I'd finally managed to drink him under the table tonight. Though I had to admit, I might have overdone it a bit myself.

As I stepped into the hallway, my feet suddenly faltered. The world swayed ever so slightly, reminding me that perhaps I should have paced myself better with those cocktails. The marble flooring beneath my heels seemed to stretch endlessly before me, its polished surface reflecting the dim overhead lights in a way that made me blink twice to focus.

Spencer Sherwood, looking perfectly comfortable with some blonde draped over his arm. My blood instantly boiled.

"Spencer," I said, injecting every ounce of venom I could muster into his name, "you're really living up to your reputation as a sucm."

He had the audacity to smirk. "Eleanor. Always a pleasure."

"Move," I snapped. "You're blocking my way to the restroom." The blonde-whoever she was-had the sense to look uncomfortable.

Instead of stepping aside, Spencer leaned against the wall, casual as could be. Something in me snapped. I pulled out my phone, maintaining eye contact as I dialed.

"Quinn, darling!" I practically sang into the phone when she answered. "You won't believe who I just ran into. Spencer is here, and-oh my, is one boy not enough to satisfy you? Want me to call you a high-class escort? I guarantee satisfaction!"

Spencer's face darkened. I shouldered past them both, my heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

The ladies' room provided a brief sanctuary. I splashed some cold water on my face, trying to calm down. The anger still simmered, but at least my hands had stopped shaking.

That's when I heard it-the unmistakable sound of retching coming from the men's room back near the VIP area. I shouldn't care. I really shouldn't. But something in the painful sound made me pause.

The party had mostly dispersed when I returned to our section. The sound came again, followed by what seemed like a stumble.

"Hello?" I called out, approaching the private bathroom attached to our room. "Anyone in there?"

A groan answered me, followed by the sight of Jace Gillard nearly face-planting as he tried to stand. I caught him just in time, surprising myself with my quick reflexes.

"Careful there," I said, softer than I'd spoken all night. This was... unexpected. Jace never drank. Everyone knew that. Yet here he was, barely able to stand.

"Eleanor?" His voice was rough, confused. "What are you..."

"Apparently saving you from cracking your skull open," I replied, but there was no bite in my words. "What happened? You never drink."

He tried to straighten up, still leaning heavily against me. "Needed to... forget something."
###chapter 76
Eleanor's POV

Something in his tone made my heart twist. I'd known Jace for years, had always seen him as the composed one, the reliable one. Seeing him like this felt wrong.

"Come on," I said and struggled to help him sit on the floor, leaning against the wall. "Let's get you some water."

As I watched him take small sips, I realized my anger from earlier had completely evaporated. Sometimes the universe had a funny way of shifting your perspective. 

"ACHOO!" Jace let out a violent sneeze. He was allergic to perfume. The stronger the scent, the more severe his allergic reaction.
I knew this - it was intentional. I specifically wore strong perfume to keep him at a distance. Tonight, whenever I had come over to drink with Drew and the others, he'd deliberately moved away.

I stepped back further. He sneezed several more times in rapid succession.
Then, with visible effort, he struggled to his feet. 

I watched as he hunched over the bathroom sink, splashing cold water on his face. His movements were precise despite his obvious discomfort, transforming from the man who'd been violently sick moments ago into someone attempting to piece together his dignity.

"You haven't left yet?" His voice cut through the silence, sharp and cold. He straightened his back, drops of water still clinging to his jaw.

"Was just about to." I kept my tone deliberately flat, though my eyes lingered on his reflection in the mirror. The fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows under his eyes, making him look even more exhausted than he probably felt.

When he asked about Drew, I couldn't keep the bite from my voice. "He was completely wasted."

Jace's shoulders tensed slightly at my words, but before I could analyze his reaction, he turned to face me. "Let's go. We can share a ride back."

I hesitated, surprised by the offer. The smart thing would be to refuse, but something made me pause. *It's not like I'm the one who'll suffer*, I told myself, ignoring the little voice that suggested otherwise.

The walk to the car was silent, my heels clicking as I deliberately stayed a few steps ahead. Behind me, I could hear his measured footsteps occasionally interrupted by a suppressed cough.

Once inside the car, my strategy began to backfire spectacularly. The enclosed space amplified the sweet, heavy scent of my perfume. Jace tried to maintain his composure, but the periodic sneezes betrayed him.

"Drive faster," I instructed driver, watching Jace's reflection in the window as he struggled to maintain his dignity.

"Safety first," Jace managed between sneezes, his voice hoarse.

I rolled my eyes, though something in my chest tightened at his obvious discomfort. "I just can't stand your sneezing," I said, the words coming out sharper than intended. It was easier this way - letting him think I was merely irritated rather than concerned.

The perfume continued its assault in the confined space of the car, and I found myself lowering the window slightly, allowing the cool night air to filter in. 

The car finally pulled up to the Harrington mansion, its headlights cutting through the darkness. Before I could say anything, Jace practically threw himself out of the vehicle, stumbling toward the corner of the building. The sounds of his retching made my stomach clench.

"Should we call the family doctor..." I started to approach him, but another violent sneeze stopped me in my tracks.

"ACHOO!" He was a mess - trying to throw up and sneeze at the same time. I'd never seen him look so vulnerable, so utterly stripped of his usual composure.

"I'm calling the doctor to come here," I announced, already pulling out my phone.

The family doctor ended up having to support Jace back to his room. He could barely stand on his own feet. After a quick shower, I emerged to find his door still open, warm light spilling into the hallway. I hesitated for a moment before my feet carried me inside.

"How is he?" I asked the doctor, trying to keep my voice neutral even as my eyes fixed on Jace's pallid face.

"Excessive drinking... He'll need an endoscopy tomorrow at the hospital."

"That serious?" The words escaped before I could stop them.

The doctor nodded gravely. "Mr. Gillard already has superficial gastritis..."

"How long will the IV take?" I glanced at the dripping fluid, then at my phone. 1 AM glared back at me.

"One to two hours."

My mind immediately went to tomorrow's schedule. He was supposed to be directing... 

"Don't worry, miss. I'll stay by Mr. Gillard's side," the doctor assured me.

Later, lying in my own bed, sleep refused to come. The events of the evening kept replaying in my mind. I suddenly realized something I'd missed before - every time Drew had tried to drink with me, Jace had intercepted, taking the glass himself.

A strange warmth bloomed in my chest at the realization, but I quickly squashed it down. *Don't do this to yourself*, I thought fiercely. *Don't give yourself any hope or expectations!*

Still, as I tossed and turned, I couldn't help but remember how he'd looked in that corner of the mansion - sick and sneezing but still somehow maintaining that stubborn dignity of his. The image wouldn't leave me alone, no matter how hard I tried to push it away.
###chapter 77
Serena's POV

The dim interior of Lucas's car was silent except for his steady breathing. I stole a glance at his sleeping form - head tilted back against the headrest, features relaxed in what appeared to be alcohol-induced slumber. As we pulled up to my building, I carefully unbuckled my seatbelt, trying not to wake him.

"Thank you for the ride," I whispered, reaching for the door handle.

His hand shot out, wrapping around my wrist. My breath caught at the sudden contact. For someone supposedly passed out drunk, his grip was remarkably precise.

"Let me walk you up," he murmured, his voice low and steady. A hint of sandalwood cut through the lingering scent of whiskey as he leaned closer. 

"That's really not necessary," I protested, but he was already opening his door. I watched with growing suspicion as he walked around the car - his steps far too even for someone who'd had as much to drink as he'd claimed.

The elevator ride up was a study in contained tension. Lucas stood close enough that I could feel the warmth radiating from him, but maintained just enough distance to be proper. I found myself hyperaware of every slight movement, every quiet breath.

"Well, this is me," I announced when we reached my door, turning to face him. "You should head home and get some rest."

"Mm," he agreed, making no move to leave.

"It's late," I tried again.

"It is," he nodded, still not budging.

"Weren't you leaving?"

"I was," he said, the corner of his mouth twitching slightly. "But I just remembered something important."

"What?"

His eyes met mine, surprisingly clear for someone supposedly intoxicated. "You haven't given me my birthday present yet."

I stared at Lucas, still lingering in my doorway with that expectant look. His earlier façade of drunkenness had completely vanished, replaced by an alertness that made my pulse quicken.

"A birthday present? Now?" I tried to keep my voice steady. "Most people wait for a reasonable hour."

"I can be quite reasonable," he said, his deep voice carrying a hint of amusement. "A small gesture would suffice."

The way he looked at me made it hard to think straight. His eyes held mine with an intensity that sent warmth creeping up my neck. I knew I should just wish him happy birthday and close the door, but something in his gaze made me hesitate.

"Just a gesture?" The words came out softer than I intended.

"Mm." His slight nod was accompanied by the barest curve of his lips.

Maybe it was the late hour making me reckless. Maybe it was the lingering effects of our evening together. Before I could second-guess myself, I rose on my tiptoes and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek.

The moment my lips touched his skin, I felt his sharp intake of breath. Time seemed to suspend itself for that brief contact. When I pulled back, the look in his eyes had transformed into something darker, more intense.

"I hadn't expected Serena Sinclair to be so... generous with her gifts," he murmured, his voice dropping to a low timber that made my stomach flutter.

"I thought a simple 'happy birthday' would suffice," I managed to say, fighting the blush I could feel spreading across my face.

"Oh no," he stepped closer, just slightly. "I much prefer your choice of delivery."

My heart was thundering so loudly I was sure he could hear it. "You got your present. You should go home now."

"As you wish." But he lingered for another moment, his eyes holding mine with an expression that made my knees weak. "Sweet dreams, Serena."
###chapter 78
Beatrice's POV

I stood in the stark hospital corridor. The nurses scurried past, avoiding my gaze - as they should. Lawrence followed a few steps behind, his leather shoes making softer sounds against the linoleum.

"Where is Serena's room?" I demanded of a young nurse who had the misfortune of crossing my path. My voice carried the weight of decades of command.

The nurse checked her tablet, her fingers trembling slightly. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Sinclair, but Miss Serena checked herself out this morning."

"What?" The word escaped my lips like a whip crack. "Without waiting for me?" 

My fingers tightened around my designer handbag. How dare she? That ungrateful girl had always been troublesome, but this level of disrespect was unprecedented. I pulled out my phone, my fingers stabbing at the screen.

The call connected after three rings. Before she could speak, I launched my attack. "Still want me to come apologize to you in person? Who do you think you are, Serena? Get back to the Sinclair mansion immediately!"

The call disconnected with a decisive click. She had hung up on me. On me! 

"How dare she-" I began, but Lawrence's voice cut through my indignation like a blade.

"Do you have any idea what position you're in?" His voice thundered through the corridor, drawing startled looks from passing hospital staff. "If Serena presses charges, you're looking at felony assault. The only reason you're not in custody right now is because of your medical condition. That doesn't make you innocent, and it sure as hell doesn't give you a free pass to assault people!"

I stared at my son, my hand pressed against my chest. He had never raised his voice to me. Never. "You... you're shouting at me..."

"Mother!" The word carried generations of frustration. "This isn't about respect anymore. This is about consequences. Serena has Lucas Harrington's backing now. Do you understand what that means?"

My legs weakened, and I found myself lowering onto a nearby bench. The synthetic leather felt cool through my silk dress. Around us, people pretended not to stare while watching avidly.

"Lawrence," Angela's smooth voice cut through the tension as she appeared at my side. Her hand rested on my shoulder, warm and reassuring. "Why don't you go get the car? I'll stay with Mother."

After he stormed off, Angela sat beside me, her voice dropping to a confidential murmur. "Mom, think about it this way. Once this blows over, we just need to be more careful. Not give her any ammunition. She's just a girl - she's not really a match for you. When the time comes to settle scores..." She left the thought hanging, rich with possibility.

I patted her hand, feeling the familiar surge of calculation replace the shock and hurt. She was right, of course. This was merely a temporary setback. I hadn't maintained my position at the head of this family for decades by giving up at the first sign of resistance.






Serena's POV

The notification chime dragged me from sleep. I reached for my phone, squinting against the morning light streaming through windows. My coffee machine hummed to life automatically, its familiar sound filling the quiet room.

My irritation at being awakened vanished as I scrolled through the headlines. Vanguard Media's latest coverage showed Ian Whitmore's reputation continuing to crumble, with Whitmore Industries' stock in freefall. The numbers brought a smile to my face - another day of multimillion-dollar losses. The market was ruthless, and for once, that ruthlessness worked in my favor.

I paused on a particularly scathing article, my thumb hovering over the screen. Lucas... my thoughts drifted to yesterday, to that moment when I kissed him. My fingers unconsciously touched my lips, remembering. 
Looking back over the past weeks with Lucas, I realized he had taken quite a few liberties. The birthday kiss lingered in my memory, along with those subtle touches - his hand at the small of my back as he guided me through doors, his fingers brushing mine when passing documents, the way he would lean just slightly too close when speaking privately.
What unsettled me most wasn't his boldness - it was my own response. Each "accidental" contact sent a whisper of electricity through my skin. When he stepped close, I found myself holding my breath instead of stepping away. Even now, thinking about it made my heart beat a little faster.
In the bathroom, I caught myself frowning at my reflection as I fixed my hair. The memory of Ian was like a bitter aftertaste I couldn't quite shake. I shook my head, scattering water droplets and unwanted thoughts.

My phone felt heavy in my hand as I pulled up Lucas's contact. The coffee machine beeped its completion, but I ignored it.

"Are you free tonight?" I texted.

His response came quickly: "Yes."
Standing in my kitchen later, surrounded by grocery bags, I debated whether to invite Milo and Stella. Their presence would make things simpler, safer. But as I unpacked fresh herbs and vegetables, I admitted to myself that simple wasn't what I wanted. Not tonight.

I hesitated, then typed: "Come to my place for dinner."

"I'll be there."
###chapter 79
Serena's POV

The doorbell rang precisely at seven. I smoothed my hands over my dress one last time before opening the door. Lucas stood there, impeccable in a charcoal suit that I immediately recognized as bespoke Savile Row. His black hair was freshly styled, the subtle waves tamed into sophisticated order. 

The cut of the suit emphasized his broad shoulders, tapering perfectly to his waist. His striking grey eyes seemed darker in the evening light, holding that familiar intensity that always made my pulse quicken. A hint of stubble, precisely maintained rather than coincidental, followed the sharp line of his jaw. He held a bouquet of white lilies and deep red roses, and the ghost of his signature cologne - subtle but unmistakable - reached me before he spoke.

"I came straight from the office," he said, his voice carrying that familiar hint of amusement that told me he knew I wouldn't believe him. The suit was too perfect, too fresh. He'd clearly gone home to change.

"Thank you," I said, accepting the flowers. Our fingers brushed briefly. "Come in."

I led him to the living room, aware of his presence behind me. "Make yourself comfortable. Dinner's almost ready." Almost ready was an optimistic assessment, but I wasn't about to admit that.

In the kitchen, reality hit hard. The ribeye steak sizzled threateningly in the cast iron pan, spattering hot olive oil in all directions. I tried to remember the cooking times I'd researched, but the meat looked nothing like the tutorial videos.

"Need any help?" Lucas appeared in the doorway, leaning against the frame with casual elegance.

"No, I'm fine-" A particularly aggressive pop of oil caught my bare arm. "Ah!" I jumped back, nearly dropping the tongs.

Lucas moved forward instinctively, but I held up a hand to stop him. "Really, I've got this. Please, just wait in the living room."

He hesitated, then nodded, though I could see him fighting back a smile. "Whatever you say."

Once he was gone, I surveyed the battlefield that was my kitchen. The scallops were somewhat salvageable, though not quite the golden-brown perfection I'd aimed for. The lobster bisque, thank god, had turned out decent. The steak... well, that was a work in progress.

Twenty minutes later, I emerged from a quick change into a midnight blue cocktail dress, having managed to plate everything in a way that almost resembled the reference photos I'd studied. Lucas stood as I entered, his eyes tracking my movement with appreciation.

The candlelight softened the dining room, reflecting off the crystal wine glasses I'd set out. Lucas pulled out my chair, the gesture so natural it barely registered as old-fashioned.

"Is this a belated birthday dinner?" he asked, settling into his own seat.

I nodded, focusing on smoothing my napkin. "Yes." I hesitated, then added quietly, "And an apology."

His expression warmed, genuine pleasure replacing his usual careful control. "I like both of those reasons."

I watched Lucas with bated breath as he cut into the steak I'd prepared. The soft clink of his knife against the bone china plate seemed deafening. Despite the intimate lighting and the perfect table setting, my heart wouldn't stop racing.

Lucas maintained his usual composed expression as he took the first bite. I'd spent hours researching recipes and practicing this dish, determined to impress him. The way he methodically chewed, his face betraying nothing, made my stomach twist into knots.

"How is it?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. My fingers fidgeted with the stem of my wine glass, waiting for his verdict.

"It's fine," he replied smoothly, taking another bite. "Not bad at all."

Something about his too-careful movements made me suspicious. I reached for my own fork, ready to taste the fruits of my labor, but Lucas's hand suddenly covered mine. His touch was warm and gentle, but firm.

"I wouldn't if I were you," he said softly. "One case of food poisoning at the table is enough."

My heart sank as I pulled my hand back. "What do you mean?"

Instead of answering, he cut another piece of the steak and put it in his mouth. I grabbed my fork again, determined to know the truth, and managed to snag a small bite before he could stop me.

The taste hit me like a punch to the gut. The meat was simultaneously burnt and raw, with an odd bitter undertone that definitely shouldn't have been there. I quickly reached for my water glass, trying to wash away the taste.

"Oh God," I groaned, mortified. "You've been eating this the whole time? Why didn't you say something?"

Lucas dabbed his mouth with his napkin, the picture of elegance even in this awkward moment. "You went to so much trouble. It would have been ungrateful to complain."

"I'm so sorry," I said, feeling my cheeks burn. "I really thought I'd improved since last time."

A small smile played at the corners of his mouth. "Don't worry about it. In any household, only one person needs to know how to cook."

My heart skipped a beat at his casual implication of a shared future. To hide my flustered reaction, I stood up. "Let me at least make you something edible. I know I can't mess up a sandwich."

"Serena." His voice stopped me before I could escape to the kitchen. When I looked back, his eyes were warm with affection. "Thank you for trying."

That simple acknowledgment of my effort, the genuine appreciation in his voice, made my embarrassment fade. I smiled back at him, feeling a flutter in my chest that had nothing to do with my culinary disaster.

"Just wait," I said, heading toward the kitchen. "I promise the sandwich will be better than the steak. Though that's not saying much."

When I returned with our impromptu late-night snack, I found him still sitting at the elegantly set table, looking completely at ease. Only Lucas Harrington could make eating a hastily made sandwich look like a sophisticated dining experience.

"Much better," he declared after taking a bite, and this time I could tell he meant it.

I relaxed into my chair, the tension finally leaving my shoulders. "I think I'll stick to business deals and leave the cooking to the professionals from now on."

"Or," he said, his eyes meeting mine over the rim of his wine glass, "you could leave it to me."
###chapter 80
Serena's POV

Lucas sat across from me, his posture perfect as always.

My fingers traced the rim of my water glass absently. The question that had been weighing on my mind all evening finally found its way out. "Do you..." I paused, gathering my courage. "Do you really have feelings for me?"

Lucas lifted his gaze to meet mine. The intensity in his grey eyes made my heart skip. "I thought I'd made that quite clear," he said softly.

The gentle certainty in his voice made this even harder. I took a deep breath. "I should be honest with you. I don't... I don't feel the same way. Not yet."

"I know." His voice remained steady, though I caught a flicker of something in his expression. "That's been quite clear as well."

The city hummed quietly beyond my windows as I gathered my thoughts. "If we were to try this..." I began carefully, watching his reaction. "There are things you should know."

Lucas leaned forward slightly, his full attention on me. "Go on."

"I need time. A lot of it." My voice grew stronger as I continued. "There won't be any... physical intimacy. Not for a long while." I kept my eyes fixed on his, refusing to look away. "I'm extremely busy with work, so our time together will be limited. And I need time to build trust before I can develop deeper feelings."

He remained silent, processing each condition.

"Also," I added, "I'd prefer if we kept this private for now."

Lucas's response was simple but carried weight. "Alright."

"Just 'alright'?" I couldn't help but ask.

A slight smile touched his lips. "What would you prefer I say? I understand your terms, Serena. I accept them."

The tension in my shoulders eased slightly, but another question nagged at me. "Then... should we try?" The words came out barely above a whisper.

"Yes." His voice had a slight tremor that betrayed his otherwise calm exterior.

The silence that followed felt charged with unspoken emotions. Lucas broke it with a careful question. "Do you..." he hesitated uncharacteristically. "Do you hate him? The one who hurt you?"

"Yes." The word came out sharp and clean, like breaking glass.

The wine glass trembled slightly in my hand as the silence stretched between us. Lucas's usual composed demeanor tinged with something I couldn't quite read.

I watched as he opened his mouth, then closed it again, his fingers drumming an irregular pattern on the white tablecloth. It wasn't like him to hesitate.

"Serena." His voice was lower than usual. "Do you need a moment?"

I forced a smile, though my hand still shook. "No, go on."

He studied me for a long moment, his eyes holding something that looked uncomfortably like understanding. "That night... how much do you remember?"

The question hit me like a physical blow. Memories I'd tried so hard to bury came rushing back - the darkness, the fear, the helplessness. My throat tightened.

"Everything." My voice came out barely above a whisper. "I remember everything clearly. I kept saying no, begging him to stop, but he..." I swallowed hard, my right hand unconsciously moving to my right ear. "He didn't listen."

Lucas's expression darkened. He started to say something, but the words were lost to the dead silence in my right ear. I leaned forward slightly. "Sorry, could you repeat that? My right ear..."

He shifted closer, careful to maintain a respectful distance. "Is there any possibility that what you said... didn't match what your body was expressing?"

I stared at him, uncomprehending. "What?"

He seemed to catch himself, something flickering across his face before he asked instead, "If you were to meet that person today, what would you do?"

"I wouldn't." The answer came immediately, sharp and certain. "I don't want to see him. Ever."

The silence that followed felt heavy with unspoken words. Lucas's hand moved across the table toward mine, then stopped, hovering uncertainly. When his fingers finally brushed against my skin, I flinched involuntarily.

He withdrew immediately. "I'm sorry."

"No," I reached out and caught his hand before he could pull away completely. My fingers trembled against his palm, but I forced them to stay. "I... I want to try. To get used to this. To you."

His hand remained perfectly still under mine, neither pulling away nor pressing closer. "We have time," he said softly. "There's no rush."

I stared at our joined hands, feeling the gentle warmth of his skin against mine. Part of me wanted to pull away, to retreat behind the walls I'd built so carefully over the years. But another part, one that grew stronger each day, wanted to stay.

"I know it's not easy," he continued, his voice carrying clearly to my left ear. "And I'm not asking you to forget. Just... maybe consider that the future doesn't have to be defined by the past."
###chapter 81
Serena's POV

I stand in my doorway, watching Lucas straighten his suit jacket. The hallway's soft lighting casts gentle shadows across his features, and neither of us seems eager to end the evening.

"Text me when you get home," I say, then immediately feel self-conscious about how domestic that sounds.

Lucas's lips curve into that subtle smile I'm still getting used to. "Worried I'll get lost?"

"Don't be silly." I try to sound stern, but can't help matching his smile. "I just..." My voice trails off, uncertain how to explain this new protective instinct.

"Get some rest, Serena." His voice has that warm, low quality that makes my pulse quicken.

"You too."

"Goodnight."

"Goodnight."

We stand there, caught in this gentle stalemate. I'm holding the door handle but not closing it; he's half-turned to leave but hasn't taken a step. The silence between us feels charged with everything we're not quite saying.

"You should go in," he says softly.

"You should start walking," I counter.

His quiet laugh breaks the tension. "We're not very good at this, are we?"

I'm about to agree when he moves - so smooth and sudden that I barely register it happening. One moment he's standing at a respectable distance, the next he's close enough that I catch the subtle scent of his cologne. My breath catches as he leans in, and then I feel the gentle press of his lips against my forehead.

"Boyfriend privileges," he murmurs against my skin before pulling back.

My face floods with heat. I'm frozen, heart thundering in my chest, as he steps away with that same quiet confidence he always carries.

"Now I'll go," he says, and this time he actually starts walking toward the elevator.

I watch him until he disappears around the corner, my hand unconsciously rising to touch my forehead. Only when I hear the elevator doors slide shut do I finally step back into my apartment and close the door, leaning against it with a shaky breath.

In the sudden quiet of my home, I can't stop the smile spreading across my face. It feels ridiculous to be this affected by such a simple gesture, but coming from Lucas - who always moves with such deliberate intent - it feels monumental.

I press my cool hands against my warm cheeks, trying to calm my racing heart. 

Half hours later, my phone buzzes with a text. It's from Lucas: "Home safe. Sweet dreams, Serena."

I bite my lip, typing back a quick "Goodnight" before I can overthink it. As I get ready for bed, I catch myself touching my forehead again and again, remembering the gentle pressure of his lips. 

At my office, I felt my phone buzz and couldn't help but smile at Lucas's message: "Good morning, girlfriend."

My fingers hovered over the screen, warmth spreading through my chest at this simple sign of affection. After everything we'd been through, these quiet moments of connection felt precious. I was about to reply when my office phone rang.

"Miss Sinclair," my secretary's voice came through, with a hint of concern. "Your grandmother Mrs. Beatrice Sinclair is here with your father and Mrs. Angela Sinclair."

I took a deep breath, straightening my blazer as I stood. "Send them in." My voice remained steady.

They filed in like a carefully choreographed parade - Grandmother Beatrice leading with her handbag clutched close, Lawrence following with his perpetually disappointed expression, and Angela trailing behind with her practiced look of concern. The morning light caught the diamond brooch at Grandmother's throat, sending prisms dancing across the walls.

"Serena." Grandmother's voice wavered slightly - a calculated tremor. "That day... I was wrong. I let my emotions get the better of me." She took a step forward, her hand extended toward me.

I remained behind my desk, maintaining the physical barrier between us. I turned down her offer, and she awkwardly pulled her hand back, her face going pale. "You came all this way to say that?" My tone was cool.

"Don't be like this," Lawrence interjected, his voice carrying that familiar note of disapproval. "We're family."

"Family." The word tasted bitter. "Is that what we were when Grandmother was being charged?"

Grandmother's expression flickered - a crack in her perfectly composed facade. She quickly reached for the luxury shopping bag she'd brought, pulling out an elegantly wrapped box. "I brought you something special, from that boutique in Paris you always loved..."

"I'm not interested in gifts." I kept my voice level, watching as her fingers tightened around the package's handles. "What I want is an acknowledgment of what really happened that day."

"What more do you want?" Angela stepped forward, her sympathy act firmly in place. "Your grandmother's apologizing. Would you have her get on her knees at her age?"

I noticed the slight tremor in Grandmother's hand, the way Lawrence shifted his weight uncomfortably. They'd expected this to be simple - a quick apology, an expensive peace offering, and business as usual. 

"No one needs to kneel," I said finally, my voice softening just enough to seem reasonable. "But I won't pretend everything is fine just because you brought me a gift."

Grandmother's eyes flashed with familiar anger before she caught herself. She set the gift bag on my desk with deliberate care. "We're trying to make peace, Serena. Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be."

I remained standing, my posture straight. "I appreciate you coming here. But if that's all, I have a meeting scheduled."

I knew exactly what the Sinclairs were thinking. Their greatest fear was scandal - anything that might tarnish the precious family name. This apology was just a temporary measure. Once the dust settled, they'd come after me even harder than before.

"Do you really think a simple apology is enough for that slap, Grandmother?" I asked, watching her carefully.

Her jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. She'd clearly hoped I would be more easily placated. "What would it take for you to forgive me, then?" Her voice strained with forced patience, and I could practically see the calculations running behind her eyes. 

"Would you let me slap you back?" she asked, feigning sincerity with well-practiced concern.
###chapter 82
Serena's POV

I couldn't help but laugh. We both knew if I dared raise a hand to Beatrice Sinclair, the family would destroy me. The assault charges would mysteriously disappear, replaced by a much worse narrative.

"I wouldn't dare," I replied frankly.

From the corner of my eye, I caught Angela's slight slump of disappointment. 

I watched Grandmother's triumphant smile spread across her face, knowing she thought she'd won. "Now that we've settled things properly," she said, "we just need you to withdraw those unfortunate charges."

I kept my expression neutral, years of board meetings serving me well. "You're right, Grandmother. There's no point in pursuing legal action." I paused, letting her satisfaction grow before continuing. "I'll withdraw the charges - in exchange for ten percent of Sinclair Holdings' shares."

The silence that followed was absolute. Lawrence's knuckles went white where they gripped his armrest. Angela's perfectly arranged smile froze, then cracked.

"Have you lost your mind?" Lawrence's voice rose sharply. "You have no right to demand such a thing!"

I maintained my calm, pulling out a leather folder I'd prepared for exactly this moment. "Actually, I do. Mother owned twenty percent of Sinclair Holdings before her death. Her will specifically mentioned StarRiver Group, but was silent on other assets." I met his gaze steadily. "According to inheritance law, those assets should be split equally between spouse and child."

"You're trying to blackmail us." Angela's voice trembled with indignation.

"I'm claiming what's legally mine." I spread the documents across my desk. "My lawyers have confirmed it. Ten percent of Mother's shares should have come to me years ago."

Lawrence stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. "This is absurd. I won't be threatened by my own daughter."

"It's not a threat. It's a choice." I kept my voice level. "We can handle this quietly, or we can let the courts decide - alongside Grandmother's assault charges. I'm sure the press would love to cover both stories."

I watched the color drain from his face. The Sinclair name meant everything to him - the thought of it being dragged through the mud was his worst nightmare.

"You wouldn't dare," Grandmother hissed, her earlier pretense of remorse forgotten.

"Try me." I met her glare without flinching. "I have nothing to lose. My reputation's already been questioned thanks to this family's actions. But yours?" I shrugged. "Well, that's still pristine, isn't it?"

Angela stepped forward, her voice rising. "Lawrence, you can't possibly-"

"Enough." His voice cut through her protests. He looked suddenly tired, the morning light harsh on his face.

"Lawrence!" Grandmother's outrage filled the room.

"You have one day to consider." I kept my voice steady as I delivered the ultimatum. "Tomorrow, my legal team will begin preparations for both cases. I'm sure they'll find the inheritance laws particularly interesting."

Lawrence's jaw tightened, and I could see the calculations running behind his eyes.

"Lawrence, you can't possibly agree to this!" Angela stepped forward, her perfectly manicured hands gesturing frantically. "You only have fifty percent of the shares yourself, and she wants ten percent? That's absurd!"

"Shut up!" His voice cracked like a whip. "Would you rather see my mother in jail?"

Angela's face flushed. "But so many shares..." she persisted, her voice trembling with barely contained greed.

The sharp crack of palm meeting flesh echoed through my office. Grandmother had moved so quickly I almost missed it. Angela stumbled back, holding her reddening cheek, her eyes wide with shock.

"How dare you!" Grandmother's voice shook with rage. "You think about shares when my freedom is at stake?"

I watched the scene unfold with cold satisfaction. Angela's eyes filled with hatred, but she quickly masked it with a wounded expression. "Mother, you misunderstand. I'm not disregarding your situation. I just think Serena is being unreasonable..."

"Silence!" Grandmother cut her off, trembling with fury.

I pulled out the prepared contract, sliding it across my polished desk. "The paperwork is ready. Everything's in order."

Lawrence picked up the contract, scanning it quickly. "You'll withdraw the charges against your grandmother?"

"After you sign." I remained firm. "Though honestly, you're not in a position to negotiate. These shares are legally mine either way. By signing voluntarily, you're simply saving the family's reputation - and giving me a reason to be merciful."

He signed with a sharp, angry motion. The pen scratched against paper like a confession of defeat.

"One more thing," I added, watching their faces carefully. "Nina should probably tender her resignation. It's rather awkward for an executive to be caught undermining her own company. Unless she'd prefer to explain her actions to the board?"
###chapter 83
Serena's POV

The silence that followed was deafening. I could see Angela wanting to protest, but the red mark on her cheek kept her quiet.

They filed out of my office like defeated soldiers. As the door closed behind them, I allowed myself a moment of quiet triumph.

The morning sun had climbed higher, warming the leather of my chair. Somewhere in heaven, Mother must be watching. All those years of sacrifice, all those shares she'd worked so hard to accumulate - they were finally back where they belonged.


Ian's POV

The boardroom still held traces of the morning's tension - stale coffee and cigarette smoke lingering in the air like accusations. I sat alone at the table, watching another notification flash across my phone screen. Stock prices. Down. Again.

"Useless!" Father's words from minutes ago still rang in my ears. "One week, and you can't even contain a simple scandal? Is this how you plan to run Whitmore Industries into the ground?"

I clenched my jaw, remembering my clipped response. "I'll handle it today."

"You'd better." His final warning had carried the weight of generations of Whitmore expectations. "Don't make me regret choosing you as my successor."

Now, in the empty boardroom, I pulled up the week's headlines on my tablet. Each one felt like a personal assault:

*"Whitmore Heir and Sinclair Heiress: Secret Affair Exposed"*
*"Serena Sinclair's Tears: 'He Betrayed My Trust'"*
*"Whitmore-Sinclair Merger in Jeopardy?"*

My fingers tightened around the device. Lucas Harrington. It had to be him pulling strings behind the scenes. The thought of him with Serena made my blood boil.

Making my way to my private office, I settled into the leather chair and opened my phone's encrypted folder. The photos were still there - Harrington with Eleanor at the charity gala last month. Their body language suggesting intimacy, her hand lingering on his arm. Circumstantial, but in the right context...

I gave Evelyn a call.

"Brother?" Evelyn's voice dripped with annoyance. "I'm getting ready for the fashion gala tonight. What's so urgent?"

"Is Eleanor still the closing act?"

"Why do you care about that social climber?" A pause. "Wait... Ian, what are you planning?"

"Yes or no, Evelyn."

She sighed dramatically. "Yes, she's closing. But you should focus on fixing things with Nina instead of-"

"Worry about your own problems." I ended the call, a cold smile forming as I studied the photos again.

The pieces were falling into place. By tomorrow morning, the city's attention would shift to a much juicier scandal. Harrington's perfect reputation would take the hit this time, and Serena... she'd see him for what he really was.



Evelyn's POV

Chaos reigned in the backstage area of Le Grand Fashion Gala. Makeup artists rushed between stations, stylists frantically steamed designer gowns, and PR teams barked into headsets. I stood in my corner, watching it all through the mirror while my makeup artist added final touches.

The moment the makeup artist left, I scrutinized myself in the mirror. Perfect. The champagne-colored Valentino gown hugged my curves exactly as it should, and my freshly styled hair cascaded over one shoulder in elegant waves. I looked every bit the star I was meant to be.

"Miss Whitmore, we need to start the rehearsal in twenty minutes." My manager's voice grated on my nerves.

"I need some air," I snapped, not bothering to look at her. My thoughts were consumed by one thing only - Jace would be at tonight's ceremony. He'd been avoiding my calls for weeks would finally be within reach.

I heard Eleanor Yates was also attending. Of course she was - that woman seemed to appear everywhere lately, stealing roles that should have been mine. My fingers clenched involuntarily at the thought.

The corridor was mercifully empty as I made my way toward the VIP area. My Louboutins clicked against the floor. I knew exactly which room was his - I'd made it my business to know.

Outside his door, I paused to check my reflection in my phone camera. A slight adjustment to my lipstick, a strategic loosening of a curl - everything had to be perfect. I could already picture his expression when he saw me.

Without knocking, I pushed open the door. The sight that greeted me made my breath catch - Jace stood by the window, shirtless, his sculpted torso catching the late afternoon light. He turned sharply at my entrance, surprise quickly morphing into annoyance.

"Oh!" I covered my mouth in feigned shock, though my eyes lingered appreciatively. "I'm so sorry, I should have knocked."

"You should leave," he said flatly, reaching for his shirt.

I took a step forward, deliberately catching my heel in my dress. As I stumbled, he reflexively moved to catch me - exactly as I'd planned. My hands pressed against his bare chest as I steadied myself.

"My hero," I breathed, looking up at him through my lashes. "I just wanted to thank you properly for that day you directed for me..."

The door opened again. Eleanor stood in the doorway, holding a bow tie. Her eyes took in the scene - my hands still on Jace's chest, his state of undress.

"Don't let me interrupt," she said coolly, placing the tie on a nearby table before turning to leave.

The muscles under my fingers tensed. "Eleanor, wait-" Jace called after her, but she was already gone. The tenderness in his voice when he said her name made my blood boil.

"What's going on between you and her?" I demanded, dropping all pretense. "Why was she bringing you your tie?"

Jace stepped back, putting deliberate distance between us. "Miss Whitmore, if there's nothing urgent, I need to change."

"I could help with that," I offered, letting my voice drop to a suggestive whisper. "I'm not looking for anything serious. Just... mutually beneficial arrangements."

His expression hardened. "Leave. Now. Unless you want everyone to know about your... interesting proposition."

Humiliation burned through me as I backed toward the door. But beneath the shame, determination crystallized. If he thought this was over, he was wrong. Nobody rejected me - especially not for Eleanor Yates.

"This isn't finished," I muttered as I pulled the door shut behind me.
###chapter 84
Eleanor's POV

In my dressing room, I was frustrated, recalling just events when Alice burst in, her phone still in hand.

"Eleanor, we have a situation." Her usual composed demeanor was cracking. "Evelyn Whitmore claims she's 'feeling unwell.' They want you to walk now."

I met my reflection's gaze in the mirror, noting the careful hours of preparation that had gone into my appearance. "When?"

"Ten minutes."

My fingers curled into my palm, but I kept my voice steady. "That wasn't our agreement with the organizers."

"I know, but-" Alice's phone buzzed again. She glanced at it and her face darkened. "They're saying Evelyn will walk last."

"No." I stood up, the silk of my gown rustling softly. "I agreed to walk the red carpet under specific conditions. If I walk now, the carpet closes after me. Those were the terms."

Alice nodded, already dialing. "Let me handle this."

I watched her pace the small dressing room, her voice growing increasingly heated. "What do you mean, 'circumstances have changed'? We have a contract... No, you listen..."

The argument continued, but my attention drifted to the mirror again. Years of careful image cultivation stared back at me. Every premiere, every red carpet, every interview-I'd built my career from scratch, refusing to trade on my family name. The thought of Evelyn using her connections to upstage me made my blood boil, but I couldn't let it show. Not here. Not now.

Alice's sharp intake of breath pulled me back to the present. "The company president is insisting," she said, her voice tight with anger. "Apparently, the Whitmores made some calls."

"Of course they did." I smoothed my expression into careful neutrality, even as my nails dug into my palms. "Tell him I'll do it."

"Eleanor-"

"It's fine." It wasn't, but I'd learned long ago to pick my battles. "But Alice? I need a moment alone."

Once she left, I allowed myself five seconds of pure, unadulterated fury. Five seconds to remember who I really was-not just Eleanor Yates, rising starlet, but a member of one of Manhattan's most powerful families. Five seconds to imagine telling Evelyn exactly who she was trying to manipulate.

Then I tucked it all away, just as I'd been doing for years.

The walk to the red carpet was a blur of assistants and last-minute touch-ups. Just before I stepped out, Alice caught my arm.

"There's something else you should know." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "About Evelyn and Jace."

My heart stuttered, but I kept my face carefully blank. "Oh?"

"They're together now. Or at least, that's what she's telling everyone. Given that he's Howard Harrington's adopted son..." She trailed off, watching me carefully.

The irony almost made me laugh. Jace Gillard-the one person in the industry who knew my real identity, the one connection to my old life I couldn't quite sever-and now this.

"Well," I said, adjusting my bracelet, "isn't that interesting."

The red carpet was a gauntlet of flashing lights and shouted questions. I moved through it with practiced grace, each pose and smile perfectly calculated. Then I heard her voice.

"Eleanor, darling!" Evelyn's saccharine tone carried clearly over the chaos. "I'm so sorry about earlier. You don't mind, do you?"

I turned slowly, taking in her calculated appearance of fragility. The perfect victim, should anyone be watching. And people were always watching.

"Not at all," I replied, matching her sweetness with steel. "Though I've never been one to fight over scraps. That's more of a... dog's game, isn't it?"

Her smile flickered. "I'm not sure I follow."

"No?" I stepped closer, pitching my voice for her ears alone. "Good dogs know their place, Evelyn. You're in mine."

The next few moments played out like a carefully choreographed scene. As Evelyn took a step forward, her heel somehow caught on the perfectly smooth floor. She stumbled dramatically - too dramatically - and fell with a graceless thud.

"Oh my God, are you okay?" One of the event staff rushed forward, right on cue. I noticed a few photographers turning their cameras in our direction. Of course they would.

"I-I think I've hurt my leg," Evelyn whimpered, her hand clutching her ankle. "The pain... I don't think I can make it to my assigned seat."

A small crowd had gathered now. I could hear the whispers, see the phones recording. This was exactly what she wanted - an audience for her little performance.

"Should we call a doctor?" Another staff member asked anxiously.

Evelyn shook her head, her perfectly styled hair somehow still immaculate despite her fall. "The event's about to start... I just need somewhere to sit. Somewhere closer..." Her gaze drifted meaningfully to my seat.
I'm seated in the front row, right near the cameras, while she's tucked away in the corner of the third row. It's obvious she's trying to take my spot to grab more exposure and attention.
I felt my jaw tighten. The audacity of this woman never ceased to amaze me. "How convenient," I said, my voice carrying just enough edge to make several heads turn. "That you'd fall right here, right now."

"Eleanor," she gasped, managing to look wounded. "Are you suggesting I did this on purpose?"

I let out a short laugh, the sound cutting through the manufactured tension. "Suggesting? No, Evelyn. I'm stating it outright." I took a step closer, towering over her in my heels. "You want my seat? Is that what this little performance is about?"

"I-I just can't walk to my assigned spot," she stammered, though I caught the flash of calculation in her eyes.

"Oh, really?" I let out a cold laugh. The fury in my eyes was unmistakable.

I hadn't grown up being anyone's pushover. As a child, my stubborn temper meant I'd fight anyone who crossed me. Hell, I'd even made Drew Yeager cry once.

"Since Miss Whitmore seems so fond of injured legs," I enunciated each word with deadly precision, "let me help make that injury real. I, Eleanor Yates, never take the fall for someone else's games."

I raised my foot, my stiletto heel glinting dangerously, and kicked her leg with all my might.

In this world, there wasn't a single person I was afraid to take on.
###chapter 85
Eleanor's POV

I didn't think. Rage blazed through my veins as I lifted my leg, aiming straight for Evelyn's leg. Time seemed to slow as my heel rose higher, my body coiled with all the fury and hurt I'd been holding back.

But my foot never reached its target.

A familiar figure materialized between us, moving with the fluid grace I once knew so well. Before I could stop my momentum, my heel connected with Jace's shin instead of Evelyn's leg. The impact sent a jarring shock up my leg, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the way my heart seized in my chest.

"Jace..." The name escaped my lips before I could stop it, barely a whisper.

He didn't even look at me. Without a word, he scooped Evelyn into his arms as if she weighed nothing at all, his movements precise and protective. The sight of her in his embrace felt like a knife twisting in my gut. Her delicate fingers curled into his shirt, her expression a perfect blend of vulnerability and triumph as she gazed up at him.

*Don't cry. Don't you dare cry, Eleanor.*

I dug my nails into my palms, using the sharp sting to ground myself. I'd already wasted too many tears on Jace Gillard. Each one had been a mistake, and I refused to add to that collection of regrets.

He set Evelyn down a few feet away, his movements careful but distant. She immediately reached for his arm, her fingers wrapping around his sleeve with practiced familiarity.

"Director Gillard..." Her voice dripped with sugary sweetness that made my stomach turn.

I watched as confusion flickered across her face, her perfect mask cracking just slightly before she released his sleeve. Without another word, Jace turned and walked away, his footsteps echoing in the sudden silence.

My legs carried me back to my seat on autopilot. I smoothed my skirt with trembling hands, pretending to be fascinated by the nonexistent wrinkles in the fabric. The clicking of my heels against the floor seemed unnaturally loud in the heavy silence.

*It's fine. Everything's fine.* 

I adjusted my posture, spine straight, chin lifted. I'd learned long ago that sometimes the only defense was to wear your dignity like armor. So what if he'd chosen to protect her? So what if seeing them together felt like having my heart ripped out all over again?

I had survived worse. I would survive this too.

The murmurs buzzed around me like persistent flies. 
"Did you see how gentle Jace was with Evelyn just now?"

"They make such a perfect couple..."

I let out a quiet breath. A small, bitter smile played at the corners of my lips as I listened to their excited whispers. The irony wasn't lost on me - how they gushed about his gentleness as if it were some newfound trait.

The memories washed over me like a tide, unbidden and unstoppable. I was five when Grandfather brought Jace home. Ten years old, already carrying himself with that quiet dignity that would become his trademark. I remember trailing after him through the mansion's endless corridors, my small feet pattering against the hardwood floors.

"Uncle!" I'd call out, my childish voice echoing off the walls. He'd acknowledge me with the barest of nods, never breaking his stride. "Wait for me!"

But he never did. Not really. Even then, there was always that distance, that invisible wall I couldn't breach. I didn't understand it then - how could I? At five, everything seemed simple. If you loved someone enough, they had to love you back. That's how fairy tales worked.

The scene shifted in my mind to his college graduation. Spring air thick with possibility, cherry blossoms drifting like pink snow across the campus. I watched from the sidelines as girl after girl approached him, confession letters clutched in trembling hands. Each one walked away with the same polite rejection, yet my heart clenched every time.

That night, I waited by our front gates. The air was cool, carrying the scent of night-blooming jasmine from garden. My heart thundered in my chest, each beat a drum of anticipation.

When he finally appeared, there was the slight sway in his step that spoke of celebration drinks. His tie was loosened, jacket slung over one shoulder. No trace of perfume, just the clean smell of expensive scotch.

"What's wrong?" he asked, noticing me in the shadows. His voice held that same distant concern he'd always shown me.

I didn't answer. Instead, I stepped forward, years of bottled emotions finally spilling over. When my lips met his, they tasted of Highland single malt and unspoken words.

"I..." I started to speak. I wanted to confess my feelings. The words were right there, burning on my tongue. I couldn't wait any longer - the fear that someone else might claim him first was eating away at me. He was studying film directing, after all. He'd be surrounded by actresses in an industry where relationships formed and broke like waves.

But before I could continue, Jace leaned down and caught my lips with his. Then his tongue found mine, and thought became impossible.

His kiss was gentler than I'd imagined in all my daydreams. So tender that in that moment, I felt like the happiest woman in the world.

I never did manage to confess that night - my legs had turned to jelly from his kisses. In the end, he had to carry me back to my room. By then, I was too shy to say anything coherent.

Besides, after we'd both made moves like that, words seemed unnecessary. Everything between us felt natural, inevitable. Like water flowing downhill.

Later that night, I shared my happiness with Quinn, my best friend, giddy with the sweetness of it all.

"He actually kissed you?" Quinn's voice through my phone speaker was pure excitement. "By the gates? Like in some romance novel?"

I smiled, curling up in my window seat. "It wasn't exactly planned. He'd been at some corporate event, and I just... waited." The admission made me sound desperate, but Quinn wouldn't judge.

"And? What happened after?"

"Nothing. He just... left." I traced patterns on the cool glass. "But Quinn, the way he kissed me... it wasn't just some drunk mistake. I know it wasn't."

There was a pause before Quinn spoke again. "Eleanor, honey... just be careful, okay? Jace has a reputation with women. You know that."

I did know. But knowledge and feeling are different creatures entirely.

As evening settled in, I found myself back at the gates. The air had turned cooler, autumn making its presence known in the rustling leaves and early darkness. My phone showed 11:47 PM - late enough that my presence here was probably foolish. But last night had started this way too, hadn't it?

The sound of an approaching car made my heart leap. I recognized the sleek black Bentley immediately - Jace's preferred evening ride. But as it pulled up to the gates, I caught a glimpse of something that made my blood run cold. There was someone in the passenger seat.

I stepped back into the shadows of a large oak tree, its branches offering concealment. The car stopped. In the dim glow of the interior light, I could see them clearly - Jace and a woman I vaguely recognized from some streaming show. She was laughing at something he'd said, her hand resting casually on his arm.

Then he leaned over, and they were kissing. Not the hesitant, scotch-flavored kiss from last night. This was familiar, practiced - the kiss of people who knew exactly what they were doing.

Something in my chest cracked. I must have made a sound, because they suddenly broke apart, the woman's eyes wide as she spotted me.

"Eleanor?" Jace's voice held none of last night's warmth. "What are you doing out here so late?"

I stepped forward, grateful for the darkness hiding my expression. "I could ask you the same thing."

The woman was already gathering her things, mumbling something about calling an Uber. Jace didn't stop her as she slipped out of the car.

"Go home," he said once we were alone. "You're too young to understand-"

"Too young?" My voice came out steadier than I felt. "I was old enough last night when you kissed me."

He ran a hand through his hair - a gesture I'd always found endearing before. Now it just looked rehearsed. "I had too much to drink. Let's just forget about it."

"You weren't drunk." The words felt like glass in my throat. "I tasted the scotch, but you weren't drunk."

"Eleanor." He sighed my name like I was a child being difficult. "What happened last night... it was a mistake. I was feeling nostalgic, maybe. You're like family."

Family. The word hit like a slap. I wanted to scream, to rage, to demand explanations. Instead, I found myself oddly calm, watching him as if from a great distance.

"Right," I said finally. "Family."
###chapter 86
Eleanor's POV

Then he leaned over, and they were kissing. Not the hesitant, scotch-flavored kiss from last night. This was familiar, practiced - the kiss of people who knew exactly what they were doing.

Something in my chest cracked. I must have made a sound, because they suddenly broke apart, the woman's eyes wide as she spotted me.

"Eleanor?" Jace's voice held none of last night's warmth. "What are you doing out here so late?"

I stepped forward, grateful for the darkness hiding my expression. "I could ask you the same thing."

The woman was already gathering her things, mumbling something about calling an Uber. Jace didn't stop her as she slipped out of the car.

"Go home," he said once we were alone. "You're too young to understand-"

"Too young?" My voice came out steadier than I felt. "I was old enough last night when you kissed me."

He ran a hand through his hair - a gesture I'd always found endearing before. Now it just looked rehearsed. "I had too much to drink. Let's just forget about it."

"You weren't drunk." The words felt like glass in my throat. "I tasted the scotch, but you weren't drunk."

I know his alcohol tolerance better than anyone. He never drinks enough to get drunk, precisely because he can't handle alcohol well.

"Fine, I admit I wasn't drunk." His eyes meet mine as I stand there crying like a fool, and there isn't even a flicker of sympathy in his gaze. "I'm 22, a grown man. It's hard to reject any woman who throws herself at me. Just forget about it."

Forget about it? Any woman?

The pain cuts deep into my chest. Through my tears, I manage to whisper, "That was my first kiss."

"Sorry," he says, his voice devoid of any real remorse.

My heart pounds against my ribs as I gather every ounce of courage I have. "Don't you like me?" I ask, unable to hide the desperate hope in my voice.

"No." He doesn't hesitate, his words falling like ice. "Never have, since we were kids. I just had to keep smiling since I was living under your family's roof."

Never liked me... just because he lived under our roof.

All this time, I've been fooling myself.

His dislike was real. His kindness was fake. I find myself laughing through my tears. Laughing at my own naivety. Laughing at how I could still hope for anything from Jace.

The spotlights burned into my skin as I walked down the runway, each step measured and precise despite the exhaustion seeping into my bones. Years in the industry had taught me how to keep smiling even when my face felt like cracking.

"Simply stunning!" The announcer's voice boomed through the speakers, but I barely registered it. My mind was elsewhere, trapped in a loop of memories I couldn't shake. 

Backstage was organized chaos - makeup artists rushing between models, photographers snapping last-minute shots, stylists frantically adjusting outfits for the final group photo. I found my way to my designated corner, where my makeup artist was waiting.

"Touch-ups for the interviews?" she asked, already reaching for her brush.

I nodded, catching my reflection in the mirror. The woman staring back at me looked flawless - not a single hair out of place, makeup still camera-ready.

"Eleanor!" The host from the Fashion Gala approached with her microphone and camera crew in tow. "You absolutely owned that runway! How does it feel to be the face of Vanguard's spring collection?"

My lips curved into the practiced smile I'd perfected over the years. "I'm honored to represent Vanguard. Their vision for fashion has always been revolutionary, and this collection particularly speaks to the modern woman's strength and elegance."

The words flowed automatically, my media training kicking in without conscious thought. But behind my professional facade, another voice echoed from the past:

*"That was my first kiss."*

*"Sorry."*

*"Don't you like me?"*

*"No. Never did. But when you're living under someone's roof, you learn to smile."*

"Eleanor?" The host's voice snapped me back to the present. "You seemed lost in thought there for a moment."

"Just overwhelmed by the amazing energy to - ," I recovered smoothly, but before I could respond, chaos erupted at the exit. A swarm of reporters pushed through security, their cameras flashing like strobe lights.

"Eleanor Yates! Can you comment on the photos released tonight?"

"Is it true about your relationship with-"

"Sources claim he's been funding your career-"

The questions hit like bullets, each one aimed to draw blood. Through the chaos, I caught Evelyn's satisfied smile as she stepped back into the shadows.
###chapter 87
Eleanor's POV

"If I were in a relationship," I said, keeping my voice light and professional, "I would be happy to share that news with everyone." The words felt hollow in my mouth, practiced lines that usually worked but now seemed to bounce off the wall of skepticism around me.

"Eleanor! What about the photos?" 

"Who's the mystery man?"

"Are you secretly dating?"

Years of media training kicked in automatically. I kept my smile steady, even as my stomach twisted into knots. "I'm sorry, but I'm not sure which photos you're referring to," I said, maintaining eye contact with the nearest reporter while trying to scan for an escape route.

The questions grew more aggressive. Cameras flashed from every angle, creating a strobe effect that made it hard to focus.

Just when the press of bodies started to feel suffocating, I heard April's voice behind me. "Make way! Coming through!" Security guards materialized, creating a human corridor. Strong hands guided me through the chaos, and suddenly I was being bundled into the waiting car.

The door slammed shut, muffling the shouted questions outside. I let out a shaky breath as April slid in beside me, already furiously typing on her phone.

"Elle, look at this." She thrust her phone at me, her expression tense.

I took one look at the "scandal" photos and couldn't help but laugh - a slightly hysterical sound that surprised even me. It was Lucas. Even with his face completely blurred out in the photo, I recognized the scene instantly. The charity gala's distinctive circumstance, that exact moment when my brother had forced me to return.

"You know who this is?" April's eyes narrowed. "Elle, please tell me this isn't actually a secret boyfriend situation."

I pressed my lips together, trying to find the right words. "It's... complicated. But not in the way they think." I gestured at the tinted windows, where camera flashes were still visible. "I can't explain everything right now, but trust me - keeping this mysterious is better for everyone."

April studied me for a long moment. "Alright. But there's something else you should know." She hesitated. "Jace has been running interference with the media all evening. He's the reason this didn't break until after the ceremony."

I felt my breath catch slightly at that news. Jace had no obligation to help me, especially given how things ended between us. Yet here he was, still watching my back. How absurd! 

"Tell the PR team to deal this," I said finally, watching the last flashes of cameras fade as we pulled away from the venue. 

The car rolled to a stop outside the Harrington mansion. Through the tinted windows, I could see him waiting by the gate - Jace Gillard. My fingers tightened around my phone as I took a steadying breath.

I stepped out of the car, keeping my eyes fixed on the path ahead.
"Eleanor."

*Keep walking. Just keep walking.*

"Eleanor Yates."

His hand caught my arm, and I jerked away as if burned. "Don't touch me," I snapped, finally meeting his gaze. "You disgust me."

Jace's expression remained infuriatingly gentle. "The news story. Have you figured out how to handle it?"

"The agency's taking care of it," I replied coldly. "Don't worry, it won't affect your precious show's ratings."

"It's from Harrington's charity gala, isn't it? With Lucas." He paused, studying my face. "I could talk to him, see if he can help suppress the story."

A bitter laugh escaped my throat. "Could you just... stay away from me, Jace? I've been trying so hard to avoid you. If my brother hadn't insisted, I wouldn't be here at all. Wouldn't be in your show. When I have no choice but to deal with you, could you at least give me the courtesy of leaving me alone?"

My voice cracked on the last words, eight years of carefully contained pain threatening to spill over. The cool night air felt thick, suffocating.

"I'm sorry," he said quietly. Always so quietly, so gently. It made everything worse.

"You think I don't love you anymore?" The words burst out before I could stop them. "Is that what you tell yourself?"

"I don't deserve this from you."

"You're right, you don't." I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to hold the pieces together. "And I'm stupid enough to keep feeling this way. But don't worry, I'm used to it. Just stay away from me, and I can pretend I never loved you at all."

I turned away, forcing my steps to remain steady. "Good night, Uncle Jace."

In the distance, a flash of white light appeared under the tree. I quickly realized it was the paparazzi and hurried home.
###chapter 88
Ian's POV

The negative headlines about Eleanor were still trending, and I couldn't help but smile as I scrolled through my phone. The pressure I'd applied behind the scenes was working perfectly - her management company clearly couldn't suppress this scandal. Leaning back in my chair, I savored the moment.

*Time to check on Serena*, I thought, reaching for my phone. I wanted to see how she was handling her friend's public humiliation.

The phone rang three times before she answered. "What do you want, Ian?" Her voice was cold, controlled.

"I was just wondering," I kept my tone light, casual, "do you think Lucas will step in to help Eleanor? Given their... special relationship." The words rolled off my tongue smoothly, each one carefully chosen to cut.

A brief silence. Then Serena laughed, the sound sharp and dismissive. "Is that the best you can do?"

Her response pricked at my ego. I stood up, pacing across the office. "I'm genuinely curious, Serena. How did you manage to seduce Lucas Harrington?" The words came out harsher now, my control slipping. "You used to act so pure and proper, pushing my hand away if I even tried to touch you. Now look at you."

"Comparing yourself to Lucas?" Serena's voice dripped with derision. "That's ambitious, even for you. What exactly do you think you have over him? His looks? His wealth? His influence? You don't even come close."

My fingers tightened around the phone. She had no right to speak to me this way. "You-"

"Oh, and Ian?" She cut me off, her voice turning almost playful. "You might want to keep an eye on Nina. She's always had a habit of wanting what I have. Always gets jealous when I have something better than her. I wonder... has she noticed Lucas yet?"

The suggestion hit like a physical blow. My free hand clenched into a fist. "Nina isn't like you," I spat, but even as I said it, memories of Nina's recent strange behavior flooded my mind. The way she'd grown distant, how her eyes followed Lucas at social events...

"Nina would never-" I started, but Serena had already hung up.

I stood there, staring at my phone. A cold feeling settled in my stomach. Nina had been acting differently lately. More distant. Less interested in our plans. But surely she wouldn't...



Serena's POV

The gossip headlines about Eleanor were getting worse by the hour. The latest one screamed in bold text: "Rising Starlet Eleanor Yates: Secret Sugar Daddy Revealed?"

My thumb hovered over Lucas's contact. It was late, probably too late for a business call, but this wasn't just business - this was family. After another moment's hesitation, I typed out a message and attached the latest article link.

"Have you seen the news about Eleanor?"

Three dots appeared almost immediately, then disappeared, then reappeared. Finally: "Yes."

Just that. One word. I waited, but nothing else followed. My fingers moved across the screen again.

"Aren't you going to help clear things up? Most people online are convinced she's being kept by some wealthy businessman."

The response came faster this time: "Let her learn from this."

I stared at those words, a mixture of disbelief and anger rising in my chest. "What do you mean, 'let her learn'? She's your sister!"

"I've never supported her entertainment career. If this incident makes her quit and return to Harrington International, all the better."

The casual dismissiveness in his text made my blood boil. "Are you seriously acting like a brother right now?"

"I am acting like the future head of Harrington International. The entertainment industry is beneath our family's dignity."

I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. The blue light of my phone screen felt harsh against my eyes as I typed my next message. "What if Jace helps? He has experience handling this kind of PR crisis."

The reply took longer this time. When it came, the words carried a distinct chill: "You seem quite familiar with Jace's capabilities."

I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the obvious jealousy in his response. "I'm just trying to help Eleanor. Why won't you let Jace handle this? He's more than capable."

"He's adopted," Lucas replied bluntly. "We keep him away from core family matters to avoid future inheritance disputes. It's better this way."

"So that's how your family treats people?" I finally wrote back. "Sorting them into convenient categories of worth?"

The three dots appeared and disappeared several times before his response came through: "You're oversimplifying a complex family matter."
###chapter 89
Serena's POV

"So you're just going to let Eleanor's situation slide?" I asked, unable to completely mask my concern despite trying to keep my tone professional.

His reply came swiftly: "She'll handle it. If she can't, she knows where to find me."

The certainty in his response gave me pause. Lucas wasn't one to abandon responsibilities, and his confidence in Eleanor's ability to manage her own affairs made me reconsider my stance. Still, I couldn't help but feel a lingering worry.

I was about to return to my work when another message from him appeared: "We haven't seen each other since making things official."

My heart skipped a beat. Before I could formulate a response, he followed up: "Is this what Miss Sinclair meant by 'trying to date'? Virtual dating?"

The hint of complaint in his message made me smile despite myself. "Work doesn't feed itself," I typed back, trying to keep things light.

"Spiritual nourishment is just as essential as physical sustenance," came his swift reply.

"So I've been starving you?" I couldn't help but play along.

"Absolutely famished."

The conversation was veering into dangerous territory, and I could feel the heat rising to my cheeks. Thank goodness this was over text and not in person. 

Taking a deep breath, I decided to redirect the conversation. "I miss Milo and Stella. Why don't we have dinner together tonight? We could bring kids. I'll try my best to leave work on time."

Minutes later, his response arrived: "Fine."

I bit back a smile at his obvious disappointment, even as I felt a small thrill of victory at my tactical maneuver. The children would provide the perfect buffer while allowing us to spend time together - a win-win solution if I'd ever seen one.

Returning my attention to work, I pulled up the details for the Manhattan TV station's reality show focused on celebrity styling. The competition would be fierce, with designers from across the country vying for spots, but the potential exposure for participating brands was undeniable. The station's shows consistently garnered high ratings, making this essentially free advertising too good to pass up.

Without much hesitation, I submitted my application for the designer selection process. The preliminary rounds would determine who got to work with the celebrities and participate in the actual show filming. 

I was reviewing the quarterly reports when a familiar voice pierced through the afternoon silence. "Mommy!" 

Looking up from my desk, I saw Milo bounding toward me, his school backpack bouncing with each step. Behind him, Stella followed at a more measured pace, her gray eyes-so like her father's-watching the scene unfold. Lucas stood in the doorway, his tall frame relaxed against the frame but his gaze intent on us.

I crouched down, opening my arms to catch Milo in a warm embrace. "How was school today, sweetheart?"

"We learned about dinosaurs!" Milo's excitement was contagious. "And I drew a T-Rex eating pizza!"

I noticed Stella hanging back, her small fingers playing with the hem of her uniform sweater. "Would you like a hug too, Stella?"

Her face lit up, though she tried to maintain her composure as she stepped forward. When both children were in my arms, I caught Lucas's expression changing-his brows drawing together slightly.

"Daddy's frowning!" Milo announced, pulling back to do an exaggerated impression of his father's expression.

Stella, ever perceptive, tugged gently at Lucas's hand. "Are you upset because we're all paying attention to Mommy?"

"Maybe Daddy's having his second adolescence," Milo declared with perfect innocence, causing me to burst into laughter.

Stella's eyes twinkled mischievously. "Or maybe Daddy wants a hug too."

Lucas's frown deepened, but I caught the slight twitch at the corner of his mouth. "If you're all done analyzing my facial expressions," he said dryly, "we have dinner reservations at Jean-Georges."

The ride to the restaurant was filled with Milo's animated chatter about his day, while Stella occasionally added quiet corrections to her brother's more dramatic retellings. I noticed Lucas watching us through the rearview mirror, his eyes softening whenever they landed on the children-or me.

Jean-Georges was quiet when we arrived, the early evening light casting a warm glow. We had just settled into our usual corner booth when a familiar voice cut through our comfortable family moment.

"Lucas? What a surprise!"

I looked up to see a well-dressed young woman standing by our table, her surprise seeming a touch too rehearsed. Stella immediately shifted closer to her father, her small hand finding his beneath the table.

The woman excitedly introduced herself, "I'm Sophia Mitchell, Rachel Thorne's cousin. We met before when you and her were studying abroad together."

"She's coming back to Manhattan soon," Sophia continued, her eyes flickering between Lucas and me. "She mentioned how much she's looking forward to catching up."

I felt rather than saw Lucas tense beside me. "Ms. Mitchell," his voice was cool and dismissive, "we're about to have dinner."

"Of course, I wouldn't want to intrude." Sophia's smile didn't quite reach her eyes as she glanced at me one last time before departing.

"Who's Rachel?" Milo asked innocently, reaching for his water glass.

"No one important," Lucas answered quickly-too quickly.

I caught Stella watching her father's face intently, her expression far too knowing for a child her age. She squeezed Lucas's hand and changed the subject, asking about dessert options with deliberate cheerfulness.

As we looked over the menus, I couldn't shake the feeling that Sophia's "chance" encounter was anything but random. Rachel's impending return felt like a storm cloud gathering on our horizon. But looking at Lucas helping Milo with his menu while Stella leaned contentedly against his arm, I pushed those thoughts aside.
###chapter 90
Serena's POV

"Careful, Milo, it's still hot," I said, cutting his steak into bite-sized pieces. 

I caught between helping Milo with his steak and noticing Stella's quiet glances. The girl sat with perfect posture, carefully handling her silverware, but her eyes kept darting between her plate and my hands as I helped her brother.

"Would you like some help too, Stella?" I asked gently, meeting her eyes.

She straightened in her chair, a picture of practiced grace. "I can manage on my own..." But after a moment's hesitation, she added in a softer voice, "Actually... if you don't mind..."

I smiled and reached over to help her, noting how she tried to hide her pleased expression. The warmth in my chest grew as I realized how much these small moments meant to both children.

"Well," Lucas's voice carried a hint of playful complaint from across the table, "I see I've become completely invisible tonight."

Before I could respond, Stella suddenly spoke up. "But Daddy, it's fair! You have Mommy to keep you company, and we have her to take care of us."

I felt heat rise to my cheeks at her innocent observation. Lucas cleared his throat, though I could see the corners of his mouth twitching upward.

The conversation shifted when I brought up Rachel. After the misunderstanding about Lucas and Eleanor, I'd decided to always ask directly about things from now on. As Lucas began to explain, I noticed both twins perk up, their attention suddenly razor-sharp.

"Our grandfathers served together in World War II - mine and Rachel's, so they remained close. Even though our families lived in different cities, they kept in frequent contact. When I was young, my grandfather loved taking me to visit relatives, so we visited the Thorne family in Paterson many times. Rachel Thorne is..." Lucas paused, searching for the right words.

"Your childhood sweetheart," I raised an eyebrow.

"No," Lucas denied firmly. "More like... a family friend's daughter."

*A family friend's daughter?! Somehow that description felt even more ambiguous.*

"When I was young, my grandfather sent me abroad to study, and her as well. After university, I stayed overseas to expand Harrington's international market, while she remained abroad to manage the Thorne enterprises," Lucas continued. "Because of our families' connection, we looked out for each other."

*Looked out for each other? In what way?!*

Lucas caught my scrutinizing gaze and his lips curved into a slight smile. "Don't worry, there was nothing between us."

"Whether there was or wasn't something is all in your past. I don't care," I said dismissively.

Lucas's mood suddenly brightened. "Miss Sinclair, I see you're making progress," he commented.

"Hmm?" I looked at him, puzzled.

"You've learned to use your mouth to ask questions. Unlike before, when you just silently condemned me - "

"Mommy," Stella cut in with startling earnestness, "you don't need to worry. Daddy likes being with you the most!"

I felt my face flush. In that warm and comforting moment, I decided to let it go and put my complete trust in Lucas.

After dinner, I headed home in Lucas's Maybach.

In the back of the Maybach, Stella had gradually shifted until she was leaning against my shoulder, recounting her day at school with surprising animation. Milo chimed in with his own version of events, their voices filling the car with warmth and laughter.

I caught Lucas watching us, his expression soft in a way that made my pulse quicken. When our eyes met, he didn't look away, and I found myself wondering how this evening had evolved from a simple dinner into something that felt so much like... family.

"Mommy," Stella murmured, her voice growing sleepy, "will you have dinner with us again tomorrow?"

The question hung in the air, weighted with more meaning than her young years might suggest. I glanced at Lucas again, waiting for my answer with poorly concealed interest.

"I'd love to," I replied softly, feeling Stella relax against me. "As long as your father doesn't mind sharing my attention again."

Lucas's low chuckle filled the car. "I suppose I'll survive. Though I might need some compensation later."

"Daddy!" Both twins protested in unison, and I couldn't help but laugh, even as I felt my cheeks warm again.

The darkness inside the car wrapped around us like a soft blanket, broken only by the occasional flash of streetlights. As we drove through the quiet streets, the twins' playful chatter filled the comfortable silence.

Then it happened. His fingers brushed against mine, seemingly by accident at first. But instead of pulling away, Lucas gently took my hand in his. My heart skipped a beat, and I felt warmth spread from where our palms touched. I tried to keep my breathing steady, but the simple contact sent tingles up my arm.

From the corner of my eye, I caught Stella watching our joined hands. She quickly looked away, pretending to be fascinated by the passing buildings, but I could see the small smile playing on her lips. Despite my usual composure in business meetings and family confrontations, this innocent display of affection had me feeling like a teenager again.

"Mommy?" Milo's voice broke through my thoughts. "You like sitting next to Daddy, don't you?"

I felt my cheeks warm. "Yes, it's... comfortable," I managed to reply softly.

The car eventually pulled into the underground parking garage of Tribeca Towers. As the engine died down, none of us seemed eager to break the moment. Lucas reluctantly released my hand, and we stepped out into the fluorescent-lit space.

"Goodbye, sweetheart," I said, reaching out to touch Milo and Stella's cheeks. Milo beamed at me, his eyes bright with childish affection.

Before I could step back, Stella moved forward and wrapped her arms around my waist in an unexpected hug. "Mommy," she whispered against my blazer, "will you come see us tomorrow?"

I stroked her soft hair, fighting the lump in my throat. "Of course, if I can."

Lucas stood watching us, his grey eyes soft. "Get home safe," he said, his deep voice carrying across the space between us.

As I watched their car disappear around the corner, I could still feel the phantom warmth of his hand in mine.
###chapter 91
Eleanor's POV

I don't remember exactly how I got to Serena's apartment building. The world was spinning, and the city lights blurred into streaks of gold against the dark sky. All I knew was that I couldn't go home.

The cold concrete of her doorstep seeped through my dress as I sat there, waiting. My phone buzzed several times, but I ignored it. The world could wait. Everything could wait until Serena came home.

When I finally heard the click of heels against floor, I lifted my heavy head. There she was, key in hand, looking surprised to find me hunched by her door.

"Eleanor?" Serena's voice cut through my alcohol-induced haze. "What are you doing here?"

"You're finally back," I mumbled, my voice cracking. The sight of her concerned face made my eyes well up with tears I'd been holding back all evening. "I... I just..."

She quickly knelt beside me, her hand gentle on my shoulder. "How much did you drink?"

"Just a little... or maybe a lot." I tried to laugh, but it came out more like a sob. "I knew... I knew you'd take care of me..."

"Come on, let's get you inside." Serena helped me to my feet, steady and strong as always. The world tilted dangerously, but her arm around my waist kept me from falling.

Inside her apartment, everything was neat and familiar. She guided me to the bathroom, where I caught my reflection in the mirror - mascara smeared, lipstick faded, hair a mess. I barely recognized myself.

"Want to tell me what happened?" Serena asked as she handed me a warm washcloth. The concern in her voice made my chest tight.

"Nothing really." I focused on wiping my face, avoiding her eyes. "Just... there are some people at home I don't want to see right now."

"Eleanor..."

"I'm fine," I cut her off quickly. "Can I just... can I sleep? Please?"

She sighed but nodded, helping me into her guest room. 

She didn't push, and that's why I loved her. Instead, she dimmed the lights and left a glass of water by the bed. "Get some rest. We can talk in the morning if you want."

Just as I was settling under the covers, my phone buzzed again. This time, Serena glanced at the screen before handing it to me.

"Your agent's calling."

My heart skipped when I saw the name.

"Eleanor? We need to talk." Something in Alice's tone made me sit up straighter. "It's about you and Director Gillard."

Just hearing his name sent an unwelcome flutter through my chest. I pressed my fingers against the bedspread, steadying myself. "What about us?" I kept my voice carefully neutral.

"Photos are circulating online of you two together. The media's already running with it."

My fingers went cold. "What photos?"

"Listen, I'm sending you the links now, but-"

I was already pulling up the news sites. The headlines hit me like a physical blow:

*"Rising Star Eleanor Yates and Award-Winning Director Jace Gillard: Hollywood's New Power Couple?"*

*"Exclusive: Inside Eleanor and Jace's Secret Romance"*

The first shot showed Jace and I outside the mansion. Even though we were clearly standing apart, the media had spun their own narrative. They claimed we were having a lovers' quarrel, embarrassed at being caught by paparazzi. 

"Let me see," Serena leaned closer to look at my phone screen. I tilted it toward her, my hand surprisingly steady despite my racing heart.

"Look at this," I pointed to the second photo. "They're comparing it to an earlier blurred photo they thought was Jace." A bitter laugh escaped me. "I can see why they made the connection though. Lucas's profile does look somewhat similar to Jace's."

"This is ridiculous," I snapped into the phone, my voice sharper than I intended.

"Eleanor." Alice's voice took on that careful tone she used when delivering uncomfortable suggestions. "Maybe we should consider-"

"No." The word came out like a whip crack.

"Just hear me out. Your image could actually benefit from this. Director Gillard's new project is generating major buzz, and a potential relationship would-"

"There is NOTHING between Jace Gillard and me." My voice trembled with the effort to keep it under control. "And there never will be. I want this shut down. Now."

My hand was shaking so badly I nearly dropped the phone. Serena had abandoned her laptop entirely, watching me with concern.

"Eleanor, be reasonable," Alice pressed. "The public loves a good romance story, especially between-"

"This isn't a story," I cut in. "This is my life. And I'm not playing this game with him again." The last words slipped out before I could stop them.

"At least consider-"

"No." I took a deep breath, forcing my voice to steady. "Release a statement. Keep it professional. Director Gillard and I maintain a purely professional relationship. That's all."

After ending the call, my fingers trembled as I pulled up Jace's contact. I hadn't called this number in years, had sworn I never would again.

I hit dial before I could second-guess myself. Each ring felt like an eternity.

"Eleanor." His voice was exactly as I remembered it - smooth, controlled, betraying nothing.

"I need you to make a statement immediately." I cut straight to the point, my words clipped and professional. "Deny any relationship between us. I'll do the same. We need to shut this down before it spirals further."

The pause that followed was barely noticeable, but I knew him well enough to recognize it as deliberate. "Of course," he said finally. "But we should align our stories first. How do we explain your presence at my door that night?"

My stomach dropped. Serena had abandoned any pretense of working on her laptop, watching me with growing concern.

"I..." The word hung in the air, incomplete.

"Take your time," Jace said, his tone maddeningly reasonable. "We need a credible explanation. The media won't accept vague statements, not with those photos circulating."

I resumed pacing, each step carrying me from one end of the bedroom to the other. "I don't know," I admitted finally, hating the weakness in my voice. "I'll think about it and get back to you."

"Eleanor-"

I ended the call before he could finish. My hand was shaking so badly I had to set the phone down on the nightstand.

"That was him, wasn't he?" Serena's quiet question made me realize I'd been standing frozen, staring at nothing. "The one you've been avoiding all this time."

A harsh laugh escaped me. "A wolf in sheep's clothing." The words came out bitter and sharp. "That's what he is - looks like a gentleman, acts like one too. Until you get close enough to see the truth." I turned to face Serena fully. "Don't let his polished exterior fool you. He's a snake in expensive suits, a predator with perfect manners."

"Eleanor..." Serena's voice was gentle, concerned.

"No." I cut her off, suddenly unable to contain the words anymore. "You don't understand. He's... he's heartless beneath that sophisticated facade. A monster in tailored clothing. Everything about him is calculated, choreographed for maximum effect." 

My voice cracked slightly. "And the worst part? He's so good at it that everyone falls for the act. Everyone except those who've seen behind the curtain."

I sank onto the edge of the bed, exhaustion suddenly weighing down my limbs. "You know what makes it even more obvious? My brother." A small, genuine smile touched my lips for the first time that evening. "He's everything Jace pretends to be - loyal, sincere, someone who actually means what he says. The difference is like night and day."

My phone buzzed again on the nightstand. Jace's name appeared on the screen. I stared at it for a long moment before turning the phone face down.
###chapter 92
Serena's POV

I'm surprised we ended up talking about Lucas. "It's amazing how much Stella takes after Lucas," I said, keeping my tone casual. "The way she holds herself, even her expressions..."

Eleanor's lips curved into a fond smile. "Right? They're practically carbon copies. Milo too. If they didn't look so much like Lucas, we might have wondered if he'd picked them up somewhere." She laughed, but there was something guarded in her eyes.

I took a breath, venturing carefully into more delicate territory. "Have you... have you ever met their mother?"

The change in Eleanor's demeanor was subtle but immediate. She shook her head slowly. "No one has. Not even in the family. And Lucas?" She gave a small shrug. "He never talks about her. At all."

My fingers absently traced patterns on the bedspread as I processed this. "Never?"

"Never." Eleanor shifted, tucking her legs under her. "The twins were brought home by my grandfather when Lucas was twenty-one. He was studying abroad at the time." She paused, seeming to weigh her next words carefully. "I heard... I heard my grandfather on the phone once. He said their mother abandoned them at the hospital right after they were born."

The words hit me like a physical blow. Suddenly, I was back in that sterile hospital room, the weight of loss crushing my chest. I thought of my kids from years ago. I wanted it so desperately, but in the end, it still was a stillborn. Before I could stop them, tears were sliding down my cheeks.

"Serena?" Eleanor's voice was startled, concerned. "Oh god, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to-"

I quickly wiped at my eyes, but it was too late to hide my reaction. "It's fine," I managed, though my voice betrayed me. "I just... I can't imagine anyone doing that. Leaving their own children..."

"I still can't believe that woman," Eleanor said, shaking her head. "Walking away from Lucas and those adorable kids? She must have been completely blind." She rolled onto her side, propping her head up with one hand. "Drew and I talked about it once - we think she probably had no idea who Lucas really was."

I found myself leaning forward slightly, curiosity getting the better of me. The woman who had left Lucas and the twins was something of a mystery, one I hadn't dared to ask about directly. 

"Speaking of current problems," I redirected gently, "we should really focus on handling this rumor situation."

Eleanor waved her hand dismissively. "Please, scandals are like breakfast in this industry - they happen every day." But I noticed the slight tension in her shoulders that betrayed her casual attitude.

"True, but most rumors don't come with actual photos," I pointed out. "This situation with Jace needs careful handling."

"Actually, if you revealed your identity, this scandal would resolve itself," I pointed out.

"Didn't Lucas tell you?" Eleanor sighed. "My whole family opposed me entering the entertainment industry. They wanted me to help with the family business, just like how my parents are helping with Harrington International now. But I have zero interest in business - I just want to act." 

She ran her fingers through her hair in frustration. "My grandfather and parents finally agreed to a compromise: I could pursue acting, but only if I made it completely on my own, without any connection to the family. Otherwise, I'd have to come back and take over the family business. If I publicly announce my identity now, it would count as using the family connection, and grandfather would definitely drag me back home!"

"That does make things complicated," I said frankly. "Especially since you were photographed with Jace right outside your door. That's going to be hard to explain away."

"Jace said he'd figure something out," Eleanor mumbled, clearly too exhausted to think about it anymore. "We'll just have to wait and see what he does."

The weariness in her voice was becoming more pronounced. I watched as she unsuccessfully tried to stifle a yawn.

"Why don't you get some rest?" I suggested, standing up. "I'll take a quick shower and come back to keep you company."

Eleanor looked up at me, her expression suddenly serious. "Serena, you really are something special. Lucas is so lucky to have found you."

"Thanks to his ex's poor judgment," she added with a hint of mischief, "or I wouldn't have such an amazing sister-in-law."

As I headed toward the bathroom, I couldn't help but smile. She wasn't wrong - meeting Lucas had been one of the best things to happen to me. Though I had to wonder, as Eleanor's words echoed in my mind, about the woman who had walked away from it all. What kind of person could leave behind not only Lucas but those precious children?

Eleanor's voice drifted from the bedroom, barely audible: "Maybe women need to date a few jerks before they can recognize their soulmate..."
###chapter 93
Eleanor's POV

The insistent ringing of my phone pierced through my dreams. I groaned, fumbling blindly for it. Alice's name flashed on the screen.

"Alice, what's wrong?" I mumbled, still half-asleep. "Can't this wait..."

"Jace has already made a public statement." Alice's voice cut through my drowsiness like ice water.

I sat bolt upright, sleep vanishing instantly. I heard a soft knock, and Serena entered the room. Her footsteps were quiet on the plush carpet as she approached, still in her silk pajamas. My fingers trembled slightly as I opened my news feed.

There it was. The headline seemed to mock me with its bold clarity: "Director Jace Gillard Confirms Relationship with Evelyn Whitmore." The accompanying photo showed them at home, her hand resting possessively on his arm.

"Eleanor?" Alice's voice softened. "Are you still there?"

"Yes." I was surprised by how steady my voice sounded. The morning sunlight caught the dust motes dancing in the air, and I found myself focusing on them rather than the words swimming before my eyes.

"How could he be so blind?" Alice's indignation crackled through the phone. "Choosing Evelyn Whitmore over you? The woman's reputation in the industry is-"

"Alice." My fingers unconsciously smoothed the bedsheet's wrinkles. "What's done is done."

"The studio wants to release a statement. Just a simple congratulatory message. Show everyone how gracefully you're handling this. What do you think?"

I watched as my coffee, brought earlier by Serena's housekeeper, grew cold on the bedside table. "Whatever you think is best."

"Eleanor..." Serena's concerned voice came from across the room. I glanced over to see her watching me, her expression troubled. She knew Evelyn better than most, knew what this meant.

"I'm taking the day off," I announced quietly, ending the call with Alice. The phone felt heavy in my hand as I set it down.

"She's not..." Serena hesitated, choosing her words carefully. "I don't have anything against the Whitmore family, but Evelyn isn't known for her kindness."

I managed a small smile, appreciating her attempt at comfort. "I know."

"Do you want to talk about it?" Serena asked softly.

"No." I pulled my knees up to my chest, wrapping my arms around them. "I think I just need some time alone."

She nodded, understanding in her eyes. As she quietly left the room, I remained still, watching the sun's slow march across the floor. My phone buzzed continuously with messages and notifications, but I let them go unanswered. 

I saw Evelyn's social media update: "Jace and I have been together for quite some time. We're happy together and will be even happier in the future. Thank you everyone for your concern."

She'd attached a selfie of them together. Their faces were pressed close, clearly showing their intimacy. They looked... in love.

The comments below, however, were far from supportive.

"Are you kidding me? Yesterday we heard about Eleanor Yates and Jace Gillard, I was really shipping them! Now I wake up and he's with someone else?"

"Obviously Eleanor got played. What else could have happened when Jace took her home late at night? Now that their relationship is exposed, he's denying everything."

"Evelyn comes from a good family. Men are all about status! Even though Jace is part of the Harrington family, he's adopted. He won't inherit much."

"Jace is so irresponsible. Poor Eleanor, she got deceived..."

I just kept scrolling through the comments with a detached expression, feeling strangely numb.




Serena's POV

I sat in the armchair, scrolling through my phone as social media exploded with discussions about Jace.

*BREAKING: Director Jace Gillard Spotted with Evelyn Whitmore Hours After Eleanor Yates Incident*

The headlines were predictably sensational, painting Jace as the villain and Eleanor as the victim. 

In an instant, everyone started criticizing Jace for being unfaithful and irresponsible. Evelyn Whitmore didn't face much backlash, but since she and Jace had officially announced their relationship, she inevitably received some hate comments about being desperate and having no moral standards. Meanwhile, Eleanor had completely become the victim in everyone's eyes.
Had Jace traded his reputation to protect Eleanor's future? Was it just my imagination? Why did I get the feeling that Jace actually cared deeply about Eleanor? And why did Eleanor hate him so much?

People don't hate others without reason, unless...

I glanced at Eleanor beside me, watching as she put down her phone and drifted back to sleep. The words on the tip of my tongue remained unspoken.
If someone doesn't want others to know something, I'll pretend I don't know either.

After breakfast, I gently knocked on Eleanor's door and said softly, "I need to get ready for work. Will you be okay by yourself, Eleanor?"

"Yeah," Eleanor mumbled, "everything's sorted now anyway. I'm just going to catch up on some sleep."

"Alright. There isn't much food in the house, so order delivery if you get hungry."

"Mm-hmm."

In the car, I pulled out my phone and called Lucas. The familiar deep timbre of his voice answered on the second ring.

"Eleanor's staying at my place," I said without preamble.

"Good. She needs someone right now." There was something in his tone - a knowledge that went deeper than mere concern.

"You know something about this, don't you?" I kept my voice neutral, testing the waters.

Lucas was quiet for a moment. "Living under the same roof, you notice things. Eleanor thinks she's better at hiding than she is." He paused, then added with a touch of regret, "I shouldn't have pushed her to come back to the Harrington house. I didn't realize she was still... that it was still affecting her after all this time."

I gripped the steering wheel tighter. "Does Jace not care for her at all?"

"Their situation is... complicated," Lucas said. "Jace is both a good friend and my elder. I need to keep his confidence for now." His pause carried weight. "What matters is that they can't be together. That's just how it is."

I tightened my grip on the steering wheel. "You seem to know an awful lot about something you claim you can't discuss."

A low chuckle came through the speakers. "I could tell you everything," he said, his tone shifting to something more deliberate. "But it involves private Harrington family matters. Not something I can share with outsiders." Another pause. "Of course, if a certain someone were to become a Harrington herself..."

"Really?" I couldn't help but laugh. "Are you actually using family secrets as leverage?"

"I prefer to think of it as additional motivation," Lucas replied, and I could hear the smile in his voice. "Eleanor can stay at your place for now. I'll have Walter find her a suitable apartment within the week."

"That's fine." I watched the traffic light ahead turn red. "She needs space right now anyway."

"Speaking of space," Lucas's tone changed again, becoming lighter. "Would you be interested in taking a trip?"

The sudden shift caught me off guard. "I can't. Work is about to get incredibly busy."

"How busy?"

"Three months, at least." I could already see the mountain of tasks ahead. The merger negotiations alone would consume weeks.

"Three months." He seemed to be considering this. "Then let's make a deal. After three months, you can't say no to me."

I nearly missed the light turning green. "Excuse me?"

"You heard me." His voice carried that tone - the one that mixed authority with affection in a way that somehow made my protests die in my throat. "Three months. Then you're mine."

"The Harringtons really are a family of foxes, aren't they?" I muttered, earning another laugh from him.

"Only when we want something badly enough." His voice softened. "And I want you, Serena."

The honk from the car behind me jolted me back to reality. I realized I'd been sitting at the green light, lost in his words. "I need to go. I'm almost at the office."

"Three months," he reminded me, his voice warm with promise.

"We'll see," I replied, but we both knew I'd already given in.
###chapter 94
Serena's POV

Vincent's knock interrupted my thoughts. "Ms. Sinclair, the social media analysis report you requested."

"Thank you, Walter." I accepted the folder, my eyes immediately finding the key metrics. The downward trend in negative coverage about Jace Gillard was exactly what I'd expected. "Harrington International stepped in?"

"Yes. The negative stories have been effectively suppressed over the past week."

A slight smile curved my lips. "Of course. Jace really knows how to play the game." I closed the report. Harrington International wouldn't support Eleanor in the entertainment industry, but they'd naturally move to suppress any scandal involving Jace. It didn't cause too much impact overall, given that Jace Gillard was primarily a behind-the-scenes worker. Even with the negative publicity, the fallout was limited. Eleanor actually benefited from the situation - her position as the victim earned her public sympathy, making it something of a blessing in disguise.


The drama surrounding Ian and Nina had similarly faded from the headlines. Ian had indeed played it "smart" in this situation. But his methods were truly despicable.

My phone buzzed with a new email notification. The Battle of the Needle - official contestant confirmation. I scanned the details: thirty-two contestants, twelve episodes, and a prize that included premium advertising rights in NBC's top-rated variety shows. But the real value wasn't in the obvious reward - it was the platform, the exposure, the chance to elevate my designs beyond the shadow of the Sinclair name.

"Vincent, clear my schedule for the preliminary filming dates," I said, already mentally cataloging the designs I'd been reserving for the right moment.

The studio was exactly what I'd expected - professional chaos carefully orchestrated for maximum dramatic effect. Cameras and lighting equipment created a maze of technical precision, while production assistants scurried about with clipboards and headsets.

I'd barely finished signing the final paperwork when I heard her voice - sweet as artificial sweetener and just as synthetic.

"Serena, what a surprise!" Nina's practiced smile was firmly in place as she approached, every movement calculated for the cameras I knew were already rolling. "I had no idea you'd be here."

I met her gaze coolly. "Nina. How unexpected." The irony in my voice was subtle enough to maintain plausible deniability, but clear enough that I saw the flicker in her eyes.

She probably saw the show as a chance for redemption, backed by whatever resources our father and the Whitmore family could provide.

"Good luck with the competition," I said, my smile distant. "I'm sure it will be... enlightening."

I didn't expected to see Evelyn Whitmore here. She sauntered over, surrounded by her entourage of assistants, her voice dripping with mockery. "What a coincidence running into you here of all places."
The sight of her caught me off guard, though I supposed I should have anticipated her presence at this event. It made perfect sense - the show producers had specifically avoided casting A-list celebrities, instead opting for a mix of former stars whose fame had faded and perpetual B-list actresses. With the format pairing celebrities with regular people, no current top-tier star would risk having their spotlight stolen by an unknown partner.


Evelyn's POV
*I don't expect to see Serena here, Does she really think running a clothing company gives her the right to enter a designer competition? It's absolutely ridiculous!*
I drawled, letting my lips curl into a cold smile. "Well, what an unpleasant surprise," I deliberately looked Serena up and down. "I didn't expect to find you in a place like this."
Serena's expression didn't change. "Evelyn," she acknowledged me with infuriating calm. "I see you're still spending more time on your appearance than your talent."

"You know, Serena," I stepped closer, letting my voice drop to a venomous whisper, "confidence is one thing, but arrogance? In front of millions of viewers? You're setting yourself up for quite a fall."

She met my gaze steadily. "You should worry more about yourself, Evelyn. From what I know of Jace, he's not fond of women who cause stir up trouble."

My fingers tightened around my clutch. The memory of that 4 AM phone call flashed through my mind - Jace's voice, distant and calm, discussing our "relationship" like it was just another business arrangement. Which, of course, it had been. The carefully staged photos, his perpetual coldness, the way his eyes would drift to Eleanor whenever she was near...

I still can't figure out what's really going on between Jace and Eleanor. The news reports suggested they were involved, and I'd noticed their suspicious closeness before. But when their relationship became public, why would Jace rather tarnish his own reputation than admit to it?

I didn't waste time dwelling on it though. As far as I'm concerned, just having Jace date me is enough. I'm confident that once we're together, he'll definitely fall in love with me. How could he not?

But this past week since our relationship became official has been... different than I expected. Jace hasn't reached out to me even once. Every time I text or call, he brushes me off with excuses about being busy. He barely acknowledges me at all.

I was already feeling unsettled about the whole situation, so when Serena had the nerve to point it out in front of everyone, she hit a raw nerve. If there weren't so many witnesses around, I swear I could have strangled her right then and there!

The casual mention of his name sent a spike of rage through me, I fight to maintain my composure. "Oh? And how would you know what Jace likes?"

"We had drinks at Lucas's birthday party," she replied with a small smile that made my blood boil. "You should have been there. Oh wait - you weren't invited, were you?" then she walked away.

My vision blurred with fury. Lucas Harrington. Was She deliberately bringing up Lucas to intimidate me? After all, Lucas and Jace's relationship was anything but ordinary.

Forcing my attention to Nina, I switched tactics. "Nina, darling," I said sweetly, though my voice was tight. "Remember who you're representing here. The Whitmore Group has invested quite heavily in your public image - more than mine, actually. Don't disappoint us."

"Of course, Evelyn," she replied smoothly. "Ian and I are basically a package deal now. Clear my name, and his reputation gets cleared too. Plus, if I win this major award representing the Whitmore family, it'll bring glory to our entire family name." 

she paused, then continued with growing confidence, "When I was at StarRiver, I never truly showed my full potential. How could I, working under Serena? The thought of it was insufferable. But this time... this time I'll give it my all. I'll absolutely stun everyone with what I can really do!"
###chapter 95
Serena's POV
I entered the recording studio for "Battle of the Needle" and took my assigned seat as directed by the show producer.
This pilot episode focused on introducing contestants to the audience and pairing designers with celebrity partners. 
When it was my turn to be introduced as StarRiver Group's Chief Designer, I could feel the skeptical glances from around the room. It was clear they assumed my selection for the show was merely a publicity stunt. After all, what could be more dramatic than having the "Sinclair sisters" - Nina and me - competing against each other?
"Please welcome Serena Sinclair, Chief Designer of StarRiver Group!"

The host's voice carried a subtle undertone that made my job title sound like a punchline. I maintained my composure as I took my place at the center stage, the spotlights creating a perfect circle of isolation around me. 

"Thank you for having me," I said, my voice steady and professional. "As a designer, I prefer to let my work speak for itself." Short, direct - exactly how I wanted to present myself.

The whispers in the audience grew louder. I caught fragments of their conversations: "...just another corporate heir..." "...probably bought her position..." Their judgment was expected, almost boring in its predictability.

The real show began when Nina took the stage. She practically floated to the center, her white dress catching the light perfectly. The host's voice suddenly gained genuine warmth.

"Nina Sinclair, graduate of Parsons School of Design, winner of the Rising Star Fashion Award, and the face of Whitemore International's youth collection!"

The audience erupted in applause. Sixteen celebrities rose from their seats, each holding up a card expressing their desire to partner with her. My lips curved into a slight smile - not out of joy, but recognition. This was exactly the kind of spectacle Nina lived for.

"I'm truly honored," Nina's voice dripped with practiced modesty. "And I would love to partner with Evelyn Whitmore."

More applause. More adoration. I watched as Evelyn - sleek and polished in her designer outfit - embraced Nina like a long-lost sister. Their performance was flawless, I had to give them that.
After the introductions, none of the celebrity contestants chose me as their partner. They seemed to prioritize practical concerns over potential drama - while my presence might boost ratings, they worried about being eliminated alongside me in the first round. The show's rules were clear: if a designer was eliminated, their celebrity partner would leave with them. This made everyone particularly cautious about their choices.
"Serena," the host turned back to me, his tone apologetic, "it seems we have one remaining partner for you - Olivia Warren."

Olivia stood up hesitantly. She was known as the lowest-ranked celebrity on the show, but there was something genuine in her uncertain smile that I found refreshing.

"I would be happy to work with Ms. Warren," I said, meaning every word. Authenticity over popularity - I'd made that choice long ago.

The actual competition portion passed in a blur of fabric and focused concentration. When the judges began their evaluation, the studio fell silent.

"This is... unexpected," the first judge said, studying our design with genuine interest. "The technical execution is impeccable. The innovation in the structural elements while maintaining wearability - this is professional-level work."

"Fifth place," the head judge announced, "goes to Serena Sinclair and Olivia Warren."

I heard Nina's sharp intake of breath before I saw her expression crack. For a split second, her perfect mask slipped, revealing the fury beneath. Fifth place out of twenty teams - not bad for the unwanted pair.

As we left the stage, I caught snippets of the judges' private conversation: "...reminds me of Helen's early work..." "...raw talent, not just connections..."

Nina brushed past me, her shoulder deliberately hitting mine. "Enjoy your little victory, sister," she whispered, her voice honey-coated venom. "It won't last."
###chapter 96
Lucas's POV

I clicked replay for what must have been the twentieth time. On my office monitor, Serena's performance at Battle of the Needle played once again. Her composed demeanor masked the pressure she must have been feeling, but I caught the slight tremor in her hands before she began. The same subtle tell I'd noticed whenever she was nervous yet determined. My fingers tightened imperceptibly on my mouse as I watched.

A poorly suppressed snicker from behind made my jaw clench. Without turning, I could picture Miles trying and failing to maintain his professional demeanor.

"Something amusing?" My voice carried an arctic chill.
"Apologies, sir." Miles straightened, though his eyes still danced with mirth. "It's just... refreshing to see you so..." he searched for a diplomatically safe word, "invested in Miss Sinclair's success."
I swiveled slowly in my chair, fixing him with the look that had once caused a board member to resign on the spot. "Out."
I didn't bother watching him leave, my attention already drawn back to the screen. Serena had chosen a bold strategy for her first appearance - risky, but brilliant if she could pull it off. The judges' surprised expressions confirmed she'd succeeded in catching them off guard.

My phone was in my hand before I'd made the conscious decision to call her. It rang three times before she picked up.

"Lucas?" Her voice sounded strained, distracted. In the background, I could hear the bustle of what was likely the show's production.

"I saw your performance."

"I'm really busy right now. I'll call you back later, okay?"

The line went dead before I could respond. I set the phone down with deliberate care, though my expression had darkened considerably.

A notification from the group chat drew my attention:

Drew: Hey Lucas, caught your lady's debut? She's all over social media! Fifth place in her first battle - talk about an underdog story! 🔥

Spencer: Quite the lineup... Serena, Nina, Evelyn... This is going to be interesting.

Drew: Can you imagine if Eleanor joined? Now THAT would be entertainment! 

I watched the messages roll in, my thumb hovering over the keyboard. The thought of Serena facing off against Nina and Evelyn stirred something dark in my chest.

Spencer: @Lucas @Jace Any thoughts?

Minutes later, my phone buzzed, Serena's name lighting up the screen. I let it ring twice before answering, maintaining my composure despite the immediate lift in my spirits.

"So," I drawled, keeping my voice deliberately low, "I have to learn about my girlfriend's TV debut from the news?"

A soft sigh came through the line. "It's just a competition, Lucas. Three months max."

"And you couldn't mention this to me because...?" I leaned back in my chair, gaze fixed on the cityscape beyond my office windows. 

"I didn't want to make it a big deal." Her voice carried that stubborn note I'd come to recognize. "Besides, it's already done."

I arched an eyebrow, though she couldn't see it. "You think I can't handle what Ian can manage?" The words came out sharper than intended, laden with implications about the media coverage I knew he'd arranged for Nina.

Her laugh, warm and genuine, caught me off guard. "My talented boyfriend seems to be forgetting that his equally talented girlfriend doesn't need to buy her way to the top."

Something in my chest loosened at her confidence. I found myself smiling despite my earlier irritation. "Remember this, Serena Sinclair - you have a mountain of gold behind you. Solid, stable, and shining. You don't have to face everything alone anymore."

The line went quiet for a moment. I could hear her soft breathing.

"Have you eaten?" I asked, deliberately lightening the mood.

"Not yet. I might make some noodles when I get home."

"Oh? You know how to make noodles?" I couldn't resist teasing her.

"Of course I do." She sounded indignant. "Want me to make some for you?"

"Are you offering to cook for me?" I let my voice drop lower, enjoying the slight catch in her breath.

"I-" She stopped. "You're impossible sometimes, you know that?"

"Only sometimes? I must be losing my touch." I smiled, imagining the blush probably coloring her cheeks. "Get some proper dinner, Serena. Don't just settle for instant noodles."

"Yes, sir," she replied, a smile evident in her voice. "Was that all you called for? To scold me about food?"

"Would you prefer I had another reason?"

"Goodbye, Lucas." She was definitely smiling now.

"Goodbye, Serena." I kept the line open until I heard her hang up.
###chapter 97
Serena's POV

I was deep in concentration, reviewing StarRiver Group's latest financial reports when my phone buzzed. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across my office as I absently reached for it, my mind still caught up in analyzing profit margins.

"I thought Ms. Sinclair had forgotten about me entirely."

Lucas's voice, tinged with gentle reproach, snapped me back to reality. My heart skipped a beat as I suddenly remembered our dinner plans. Looking at my watch, I winced - it was already past seven.

"Where are you?" I asked, hurriedly gathering my things.

"Look down."

Rushing to the window, I saw him standing by his car, his tall figure unmistakable even from the twentieth floor. He lifted his hand in a casual wave, and despite my guilt, I couldn't help noticing how striking he looked in the evening light, his suit jacket draped casually over one arm.

"I'm so sorry," I said, already heading for the elevator. "I got caught up in a meeting. You should have called earlier."

"The fact that you remembered at all is enough." His voice carried a hint of amusement that made my cheeks warm.

Ten minutes later, I hurried out of the building. Lucas was leaning against his car, looking unfairly composed for someone who had been waiting for over an hour.

"I really am sorry," I repeated, coming to a stop in front of him.

He studied me for a moment, his grey eyes reflecting the city lights. "I suppose you'll have to make it up to me."

The drive to my apartment was filled with a comfortable silence, broken only by occasional glances that carried more weight than words. Once home, I insisted on cooking dinner as part of my apology, despite Lucas's protests.

In my kitchen, I was chopping vegetables when I felt him step behind me. His presence was announced by the scent of sandalwood, and before I could react, his arms slipped around my waist.

"Is this part of your apology?" he murmured close to my ear, making my heart race.

"Don't move," I managed to say, trying to focus on the knife in my hand rather than the warmth of his chest against my back. "And no talking either."

"As you wish." I could hear the smile in his voice, but he remained still, his presence both distracting and oddly comforting.

A sudden sizzle from the pan made me jump, and I reflexively reached out, brushing against the hot edge. I hissed in pain, and instantly, Lucas's embrace turned protective.

"Where did it burn you?" His voice was sharp with concern as he gently took my hand, examining my fingers with careful attention. The sting faded under his touch, replaced by a different kind of warmth that spread through my chest.

Looking up at his worried expression, I found myself caught in his gaze. The kitchen lights seemed to dim, the world narrowing to just us, the steady beat of his heart against my back, and the gentle way he held my hand.

"It's nothing," I whispered, but made no move to pull away. 

He held my hand under the running water, his larger frame making me acutely aware of how small I felt next to him. The burn barely stung anymore, but I didn't move. Something about his protective stance made me want to stay still.

"Why are you always so careless?" he murmured, his breath warm against my ear.

"I'm not!" I protested, though the words lacked conviction. 

"Only around you." My voice is getting softer and softer as I speak.

His tone held a hint of satisfaction that made my heart flutter. "I'm honored to be the one you let your guard down with."

I felt my cheeks warm at his words. He was right - I never showed this vulnerable side to anyone else. Even in board meetings where millions were at stake, I maintained perfect composure. Yet here I was, getting flustered over a minor burn in my own kitchen.

"The noodles are going to overcook," I said, trying to regain some control of the situation.

"Don't move." His voice was gentle but firm.

"They won't taste good if-"

"I'll handle it. You sit down and be good." He guided me to one of the bar stools, his hand lingering on my shoulder before he turned to the stove.

I watched as he moved efficiently around my kitchen, his sleeves rolled up to reveal strong forearms. The sight of him cooking stirred something warm in my chest.

The simple pasta dinner turned out perfectly, of course. We ate at my dining table, the city lights twinkling through the windows. The food tasted better than it should have - ordinary spaghetti somehow transformed into something special by his presence.

As we finished eating, my thoughts began drifting to the design sketches waiting on my laptop. The autumn collection deadline was approaching, and I needed to review the latest modifications. But how could I tell him I needed to work? After he'd waited for me, cooked for me, taken care of me...

"You're thinking about work." It wasn't a question.

I looked up, startled. "How did you-"

"You get this little crease between your eyebrows." His finger brushed my forehead softly. "Go on. I know you have deadlines."

The understanding in his eyes made my chest tight. I opened my mouth to protest, but he was already standing, gathering the dishes.

"I'll clean up while you get started." He pressed a kiss to my temple as he passed. "Just promise you'll get some rest tonight."
###chapter 98
Serena's POV

I watched him glide toward the kitchen, his tall figure casting a long shadow across the warm-lit floor. A wave of understanding washed over me - this was why he'd suggested dinner at my place. He knew about my deadlines, wanted to save me the time of going out. The realization made my heart flutter.

"Go on," Lucas called from the kitchen, the gentle clink of dishes accompanying his voice. "I'll handle this."

I hesitated for a moment before gathering my laptop and heading to my study. The glass walls had seemed an extravagant choice when I first moved in, but now they let me catch glimpses of him as he moved efficiently through the kitchen, sleeves rolled up to his elbows.

Settling into my chair, I opened the autumn collection files. The design for Olivia Warren's showcase piece needed finalizing tonight. My mother's old advice echoed in my mind: "Color is emotion made visible." She'd built an international reputation under a pseudonym, her designs gracing runways while she remained in the shadows. I touched the screen, tracing the lines of the evening gown I'd been working on.

Should I go with the deeper burgundy? The current shade felt too... safe. Olivia had specifically requested something that would make a statement. My fingers moved across the trackpad, adjusting tones and saturations.

A notification popped up in the corner of my screen. I clicked it absently, still focused on the color gradients. Then my brain registered what I was seeing.

My hand froze on the mouse.

The webpage that had opened was definitely not work-related. Not even close. My eyes widened as I took in the extremely explicit content - clearly aimed at a female audience. I could feel my cheeks turning bright red. 

Eleanor had borrowed my laptop last week to check her email while waiting for a meeting. Had she...? But that didn't seem like her style at all.

"Would you prefer this type?"

The low voice behind me nearly made my soul leave my body. My hand jerked on the mouse, clicking frantically but somehow missing the close button entirely. How had I not heard him approach? 

"I-" The word stuck in my throat as Lucas reached past me, his presence warm against my back as he calmly closed the window. The silence that followed felt deafening in the study, broken only by the soft hum of my laptop.

I kept my head down, staring at my hands in my lap, my cheeks burning. The burgundy design on my screen seemed to mock me now, as vibrant as my embarrassment. This was worse than any fashion week disaster I'd ever faced. How could I explain that this wasn't...that I hadn't...

"Serena." His voice was gentle but firm. "Look at me."

I gripped the edge of my desk, gathering courage. I needed to explain about Eleanor using my laptop, about the strange feeling I had about this whole situation. But when I tried to lift my head, embarrassment kept it firmly down.

I felt rather than saw him move, coming around to lean against my desk. The subtle scent mixed with the lingering aroma of dinner.

"Serena." This time his voice held a note of concern that finally made me look up.

As I lifted my head, everything changed in an instant. Instead of meeting his eyes, I found myself meeting his lips. The contact was soft, accidental, and absolutely electrifying. We both startled, a small tremor running through our bodies at the unexpected intimacy.

Time seemed to slow, stretching this moment into an eternity. The gentle hum of my laptop faded away, replaced by the thundering of my heart. Through the glass walls, the city lights sparkled silently, casting us in a dreamlike glow.

I knew, with crystal clarity, that this was a crossroads. If I pulled away now, Lucas would step back, maintaining that careful distance we'd always kept. If I stayed... The thought sent a shiver down my spine.

My fingers twitched involuntarily against the desk, and I felt his sharp intake of breath. The slight movement had brought us impossibly closer. His hand moved to cup my face, the gesture achingly gentle, asking permission rather than demanding.

The choice crystallized in that touch. My eyes fluttered closed, surrendering to the moment, to the warmth of his presence, to the possibility of what could be...

SLAM!

The sharp sound of a door echoing through the apartment jerked us apart. My eyes flew open, heart racing for an entirely different reason now. Through the glass walls, I could see movement in the living room.

"Serena?" A familiar voice called out. "Are you home?"
###chapter 99
Eleanor's POV

I froze in the doorway, my hand still gripping the handle. The scene before me felt like a paused movie - my brother and Serena springing apart, their faces flushed. The evening light filtering through the glass walls made everything painfully clear.

*Oh god. Why didn't I knock?* 

Lucas's eyes met mine with a death glare that made me want to dissolve into the floor. Serena smoothed her blouse, maintaining more composure than either of us siblings.

"What are you still doing here?" Lucas's voice was dangerously low.

I shifted my weight, desperately searching for words. "I... um..." 

"Eleanor, it's getting late. You should head to bed," Serena intervened, her tone gentle but firm. I shot her a grateful look.

Finding my courage (or maybe just my usual sass), I crossed my arms. "Well, big brother, if you had the guts to actually ask Serena to move in, I'd be gone in a heartbeat!"

"Eleanor!" The warning in his voice was clear.

I raised my hands in surrender, backing toward the door. "Look, I'm exhausted from filming all day. I'm just going to take a shower and crash. Don't mind me - carry on with... whatever." I couldn't help the smirk that crept onto my face.

"And delete those inappropriate files from your computer," Lucas called after me.

I spun around, indignant. "Inappropriate? It's research material for my role! It's art!"

His expression didn't waver. "Eleanor..."

"Fine, fine! I'll delete it." I couldn't take his murderous stare anymore. *As if those "inappropriate" files hadn't created the perfect opportunity for him to kiss Serena*, I thought wryly. *Some gratitude would be nice.*

I retreated to the study to clear my computer, muttering under my breath about ungrateful older brothers who couldn't appreciate the finer points of method acting research. Still, I couldn't keep the smile off my face. Those two were absolutely hopeless without my inadvertent matchmaking.




Serena's POV

I escorted Lucas to the door, my heartbeat still slightly unsteady.

"It's getting late," I said softly, surprised by the tenderness in my own voice. "You should head back - Stella and Milo are waiting at home, and we both have work tomorrow."

"Mm." His response was brief, but his eyes held mine for a moment longer than necessary. Then his gaze shifted, hardening slightly as it landed on my study door where Eleanor waited. The subtle change in his expression spoke volumes about his displeasure at having our evening interrupted.

Before he turned to leave, his eyes dropped to my lips, and I felt heat rise to my cheeks. The intensity of his gaze made my heart skip a beat. Flustered, I moved to close the door - perhaps a bit too quickly - and nearly bumped into him in the process. The near collision sent a jolt of electricity through me.

As soon as Lucas's footsteps faded down the hallway, Eleanor emerged from the study, her expression entirely too knowing. "Well well," she drawled, settling herself on my couch. "Was that your first kiss with my brother?"

"No..." The word slipped out before I could stop it.

Her eyebrows shot up with delighted interest. "Oh? So he's that good at kissing?"

I turned away, pretending to straighten some papers on the coffee table, but my mind was already drifting.

Tonight had been different. When he leaned in, I'd felt the anticipation building in my chest. I'd known exactly what was coming, and I hadn't moved away. Instead of anger, there had been a warmth that spread through my entire body, a sensation that lingered even now.

"You're blushing," Eleanor observed with obvious satisfaction.

"I'm not," I protested automatically, though I could feel the heat in my cheeks betraying me. The remnants of red wine still perfumed the air, mixing with the fading traces of Lucas's scent. Everything felt somehow softer, more intimate in the warm lighting of my living room.

"Oh, I just remembered something," Eleanor settled into makeup chair. Her eyes met mine in the mirror, bright with curiosity. "When did you decide to venture into the wonderful world of competitive fashion shows?"

I smiled, keeping my tone light. "StarRiver needs a younger voice. What better way than Battle of the Needle?"

The words came easily, practiced. But beneath them lay the truth I carried like a compass - Mom's dream of seeing StarRiver become a beacon in the fashion world. I could still hear her voice, soft but certain: "Fashion isn't just for the elite, darling. It's about making beauty accessible to everyone who dreams of it."

Eleanor's expression shifted to concern. "Speaking of the show, Nina's been spotted around town with Evelyn Whitmore lately. Those two together..." She shook her head. "One plays innocent while the other goes for the jugular. Be careful."

"I know." I met her gaze steadily. The alliance wasn't surprising - Nina had always gravitated toward people who could serve her purposes.

"At least Lucas keeps an eye on things," Eleanor added with a knowing smile. 

The mention of Lucas brought an unbidden warmth to my chest, but I kept my expression neutral. 

Days later, under the harsh studio lights, I understood exactly what Eleanor had meant. The camera angles subtly shifted whenever I spoke, catching unflattering shadows. My workstation had been positioned where the lighting washed out my designs. Small things, easily dismissed individually, but forming a pattern.

"Serena, we need to reshoot your critique of Jessica's design," the director called out. "Could you make it a bit more... critical?"

I caught Nina's satisfied smirk from across the room, Evelyn standing strategically close to her. They thought they were forcing my hand - push back and seem difficult, or comply and appear harsh.

"Actually," I smiled, maintaining eye contact with the camera, "I think Jessica's work shows remarkable potential. The construction needs refinement, but the vision is bold." I paused, letting my genuine appreciation show. "Sometimes the greatest designs come from daring to be imperfect."

The director blinked, thrown by my deviation from his script. From the corner of my eye, I saw Nina's smirk falter.

When the rankings were announced, I only came in 12th place, a steep drop, but I barely made it to the next round.
###chapter 100
Serena's POV

I understood that this wasn't going to be just another design battle. Outmaneuvering the two wouldn't be particularly challenging. The key was to make them feel unthreatened.

In the first round, though I had deliberately held back some of my abilities, I might have shown a bit too much of my hand. I wasn't entirely sure of the other designers' skill levels at that point.

But after that first round, everything became crystal clear. I now knew exactly how to play this game - when to push forward and when to pull back.

I sank in my armchair, scolling the feeds about show, the comments section was already buzzing with speculation, most of them questioning whether my first-round success had been a fluke. I set my phone aside, returning my attention to the production schedule. 

My focus was interrupted by an incoming call. Ian Whitmore's name flashed across the screen. For a moment, I considered letting it go to voicemail, but experience had taught me that avoiding confrontation only delayed the inevitable.

"Serena, why embarrass yourself like this?" His voice dripped with familiar condescension. "Everyone knows StarRiver's designers helped with your first design."

I continued reviewing the timeline before me, my pen moving steadily across the page. "What do you want, Ian?"

"I'm trying to help you save face. Your true abilities are finally showing through. You should withdraw before-"

"Is there a point to this call?" The production numbers were far more interesting than his attempted provocations.

"Nina's different from you," he snapped. "Once she wins the competition, we're getting married. You'll never have another chance with me, Serena."

A laugh escaped before I could stop it - genuine, surprised amusement. "Your confidence is fascinating. What makes you think I want another chance?"

His breath caught slightly - a tell I remembered well from our past. "You're just jealous because Nina's rising star is eclipsing yours. But you should worry more about yourself. Lucas Harrington has a fiancée, you know. They just haven't announced it yet. And she's far above your league."

I glanced at the framed photo on my desk - my mother at the opening of StarRiver's first store, her eyes bright with pride and determination. How strange that I'd once thought Ian's approval meant something.

"Goodbye." I ended the call mid-protest, silencing the phone before returning to my work.

Last time Ian Whitemore caused such a mess, I'm not falling for it again this time, not one bit.


Nina's POV

I sat in one of the leather armchairs, watching Evelyn pace back and forth across the imported Persian rug. Her Giorgio Armani heels clicked against the hardwood floor with each step, a rhythmic punctuation to her growing agitation.

"This is absolutely ridiculous!" Evelyn's voice cracked with fury as she slammed her phone onto the leather couch. "Changing partners for the finale? What are they thinking?"

I shared her frustration, but something else gnawed at me - a creeping unease I couldn't quite shake. Each time we'd thought we had Serena cornered in the previous rounds, she'd somehow managed to squeak through. Always last, always barely making it, but making it nonetheless.

Ian sat behind his desk, his expression carefully controlled as he loosened his tie. "I understand your frustration, Evelyn, but the station has already made their announcement."

"You're close with the production team," Evelyn whirled to face him, her designer dress swishing with the movement. "Can't you do something about this?"

"I've already tried," Ian's fingers drummed against his desk. "They were... unreceptive to any suggestions of changes."

I studied Ian's face, noting the slight furrow between his brows that betrayed his own concern. "But this completely changes everything. The finale was supposed to be my moment."

"It still can be," Ian leaned forward, his voice taking on that familiar reassuring tone he used when trying to smooth over a problem. "You're still the strongest designer in the competition, Nina. This is just... an unexpected variable."

"Unexpected variable?" Evelyn let out a sharp laugh. "That's what we called it the last three times we thought we had Serena eliminated. Remember the avant-garde challenge? She was dead last until those last-minute changes somehow won over the judges."

The memory made my stomach clench. I'd been so sure that challenge would be Serena's downfall. "And the streetwear round," I added quietly. "She was struggling the entire time, then pulled out that 'innovative' design in the final hour."

Ian's expression darkened. "That's what concerns me about this partner swap. Serena has shown an... unfortunate talent for adapting to unexpected situations."

The afternoon light had shifted, casting the office in deeper shadows. I watched as Evelyn finally sank into the couch, her anger seeming to deflate into something more like worry.

"I've worked too hard for this," I said, more to myself than to them. "We've all worked too hard to let her ruin everything now."

Ian stood, walking to the floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked Manhattan. "The question isn't whether we've worked hard enough," he said, his reflection ghostly in the glass. "It's whether we've anticipated everything she might do."

The silence that followed Ian's question felt heavy in the dimming office. I found myself staring at my phone, scrolling through Battle of the Needle's social media feeds. Each post featuring Serena's designs showed the same pattern - consistently high audience engagement, despite her always barely scraping through.

"Ian," I said slowly, my finger hovering over a particularly popular post, "have you noticed something strange about Serena's advancement pattern?"

He looked up from his laptop, eyebrow raised. "What do you mean?"

"Every time she's survived elimination, it's been through audience votes. Not jury decisions, not designer scores - pure public support." The realization made my stomach twist. "What if... what if she's been playing us all along?"

Evelyn stopped her pacing, her heels falling silent on the Persian rug. "Playing us?"

"Think about it," I continued, my voice growing tighter. "She always seems to be struggling, always appears to be on the verge of elimination, but then somehow pulls through at the last minute. What if it's deliberate?"

Ian's expression darkened as he leaned forward in his chair. "That's quite an accusation, Nina."

"Remember that viral collection from StarRiver last season?" The words tumbled out faster now. "The one that broke all their social media records? I always wondered who designed it, since it wasn't credited to their usual team."

A heavy silence fell over the room. The implications hung in the air like smoke.

"We can't let her win the finale, Ian." I tried to keep my voice steady. "Think about what it would mean for the Whitmore name. After everything we've invested-"

"That bitch!" Evelyn suddenly burst out, making me jump. "How did she manage to get Lucas Harrington wrapped around her finger?"
"She's just another one of Lucas's playthings. He already has a fiancée."
I tried to keep my voice steady, but my fingers unconsciously gripped the edge of my chair. Next to me, Evelyn practically bounced in her seat, her eyes lighting up. "Really? Who is it?"
I couldn't help leaning forward too, my pulse quickening. This could be exactly what I needed to drive a wedge between Serena and Lucas. A fiancée in the picture would change everything.
Ian's expression turned maddeningly smug as he waved off Evelyn's question. "Someone way out of our league, so I'll keep that information to myself for now. Can't have you running your mouth and causing trouble for our family, sis." 
He paused, catching my eye with a knowing look. "But Nina, your concerns aren't unfounded. Serena's still hanging around Lucas, and he's helping her out - though it's hardly any effort for someone like him."
I took a deep breath, letting my shoulders slump slightly as I perched on the edge of one of Ian's chairs.

"I might have an idea," I said softly, making sure to keep my eyes downcast. "But I'm not sure if we should..."
###chapter 101
Nina's POV

Ian's pen stopped tapping against his desk. Even Evelyn paused her restless pacing to look at me. I could feel their attention like a spotlight, exactly where I wanted it.

"What kind of idea?" Evelyn demanded, her impatience barely contained.

I bit my lip, letting the silence stretch. "It might be too harsh on Serena. After all, she's still technically family..."

Evelyn's laugh was sharp enough to cut glass. "Family? Did you forget how she humiliated you at that press conference? How she dragged Ian's name through the mud?"

I flinched, not entirely for show. The memory of that day still stung, even if it was useful for my current purpose. "I remember."

"Then stop being so soft," Evelyn snapped. "She never treated you like family. Why should you?"

I twisted my hands in my lap, the picture of reluctant conviction. "You're right. For Ian's sake, I'll do whatever it takes." Inside, I was smiling. They were falling for it perfectly.

"What's your plan?" Ian asked, his voice carrying that familiar edge of calculation.

I outlined my idea, watching their expressions shift from surprise to appreciation. It was beautiful in its simplicity, really. The live broadcast would make it impossible for anyone to prove deliberate sabotage, and the random partner assignments would give us the perfect cover.

"Nina," Evelyn breathed, genuine admiration in her voice. "I didn't think you had it in you."

I ducked my head, allowing a hint of shame to color my voice. "Is it too cruel? Maybe we shouldn't-"

"It's perfect," Ian cut in, standing up from his desk. "She brought this on herself."

A warm glow of satisfaction spread through my chest, but I kept my expression troubled. "If you're sure..."

"More than sure," Evelyn said, reaching for her phone. "I'll start making the arrangements."

I nodded, maintaining my facade of reluctant participation while internally savoring our upcoming victory. But then a stray thought crossed my mind, dimming my triumph. The rumors about Lucas Harrington's fiancée...
As much as it delights me to think of Serena being played by Lucas Harrington, the possibility that he might have a fiancée changes everything. If he's already engaged, then I've lost my chance to use this against her!
I press my lips together. Better to wait and watch for now. 




Lucas's POV

On screen, the Battle of the Needle finale was about to begin, the stage awash in dramatic lighting as the camera panned across a thousand eager faces in the audience.

My phone buzzed again. Drew had been flooding our group chat with messages since the show began.

"IT'S STARTING! The ultimate showdown begins! 🔥" 
"Serena looks absolutely stunning tonight."
"Can you believe Evelyn and Nina are paired up? This is going to be WILD!"

I ignored the messages, my attention fixed on the stream. The production value was impressive - three international judges, including Marlon Wright, the acclaimed designer, seated at their panel. The contestants' popularity rankings flashed across the screen: Nina and Evelyn leading with overwhelming support, while Serena and Olivia languished at the bottom.

"Miles," I called out, my jaw tightening at the flood of comments praising Nina. "How do I turn off these comments?"

"Right away, sir." Miles stepped forward, reaching across to adjust the settings. The stream cleared, leaving only the pure feed of the competition.

"Boss," Miles began, "I must say, I truly admire Ms. Sinclair's strategy."

I raised an eyebrow, inviting him to continue.

"Making it to the finals is one thing," he explained, taking a seat when I gestured. "But consistently maintaining the lowest ranking while advancing each round? That's brilliant. She's deliberately staying under the radar to avoid corporate interference."

My phone buzzed again. Drew: "Think Evelyn might throw a tantrum mid-show? 👀"

I set the phone face-down just as Serena stepped onto the stage. The lighting caught the subtle shimmer in her gown, but it was her quiet confidence that commanded attention. No flashy entrance like Nina's, no dramatic poses like Evelyn's - just pure, refined elegance.

"She's smarter than I gave her credit for," I murmured, watching as she took her position. The camera caught her subtle smirk.

Adrian nodded. "She's playing the long game. While everyone else fights for spotlight, she's building foundation." 

Every gesture measured, every response carefully calibrated. I felt the corner of my mouth lift slightly. Serena continued to surprise me, and I was beginning to realize just how much I enjoyed that fact.






Nina's POV

I stood in the dressing room of the Battle of the Needle studio, running my fingers along the expensive fabric of my pre-prepared design sketches. Everything was perfect. I'd spent a fortune having an international designer create these concepts.

"Nina, the producers want us on set in five minutes," Olivia Warren, my new partner for the competition, poked her head through the door. Her anxious expression made me smile.

"Don't worry," I assured her, letting warmth seep into my voice. "Just remember what we practiced. We've got this." I caught my reflection in the mirror and adjusted my blazer. Perfect poise, perfect smile - exactly what the cameras would expect from a Sinclair.

The studio lights were blazing as we took our positions. I couldn't help but glance at Serena's station. My dear sister was examining the provided fabrics with that annoyingly serious expression she always wore. I suppressed a smirk.

"Welcome to the final round of Battle of the Needle!" The host's voice boomed through the studio. "Today's challenge: create an evening gown in thirty minutes using only the materials provided!"

Exactly as Evelyn had told me it would be. I felt a flutter of satisfaction - having friends in production certainly had its advantages.

"Your time starts... now!"

I moved with practiced confidence, selecting the exact materials I'd planned for. The other contestants scrambled around, but I maintained my composed pace. After all, I'd rehearsed these exact movements for the past week.

"Beautiful choice," I heard someone whisper as I pulled out the midnight blue silk. I acknowledged them with a gracious smile, though internally I was rolling my eyes. Of course it was beautiful - I'd had an expert plan every detail.

Twenty minutes in, my dress was taking shape exactly as planned. I could hear the audience's appreciative murmurs. From the corner of my eye, I noticed several judges nodding approvingly at my progress. Perfect.

"Time's up! Hands away from your creations!"

I stepped back, satisfied. My gown was finished first - another calculated move. The cameras loved efficiency. The audience erupted in applause as my model walked the runway, the midnight blue silk catching the light exactly as intended.

"Magnificent work from Nina Sinclair!" the host announced, and I allowed myself a modest smile, head tilted just so. This was my moment. I'd finally show everyone who the real fashion talent in Manhattan was.

Then I heard it - a collective gasp from the audience. My head snapped toward Serena's model, and I felt my carefully maintained smile freeze on my face.

She'd created a pure white gown that seemed to capture light itself. As Evelyn moved, the fabric rippled like starlight on water, each step releasing a cascade of subtle sparkles that made my own design look... ordinary.

"Impossible," I whispered, feeling the triumph drain from my body. "She couldn't have..."
###chapter 102
But she had. I watched in horror as the judges leaned forward, their earlier approval of my work forgotten in the face of Serena's creation. The audience's reaction to my dress felt pale and polite compared to the genuine awe her design inspired.

I felt Olivia's hand on my arm. "Nina, are you okay? You look-"

I shrugged her off, maintaining my smile through sheer force of will. But inside, rage and disbelief churned. 

My hands are trembling as I watch the scores climb on the massive display screen. The bright stage lights suddenly seem suffocating. Serena stands there, perfectly poised as always, while I fight to keep my expression neutral. God, I hate how she makes everything look so effortless.

The lead judge's voice echoes through the auditorium. "Despite its simplicity in design, the technical execution is remarkable..." She's talking about Serena's piece.

I grip the hem of my dress, trying to ground myself. The fabric bunches between my fingers as I do the mental math - even with Ian's strategic low scores, there's no way to overcome the point gap. Twenty percent from the judges isn't enough to tip the scales when her technical scores are so overwhelmingly superior.

Nina's POV

The reality crashes over me like ice water: I'm going to lose. Again.

This wasn't how it was supposed to go. I'd planned everything perfectly. No way Serena pulled that off, this is some kind of scam. Lucas had to be the one helping her! I bet my life she didn't do it herself!

My gaze darts to Evelyn, seeking any sign of support. She's studying Serena's design with an intensity that makes my stomach churn. For a terrible moment, I think she too has fallen under Serena's spell - but then her eyes meet mine.

There's a flash of something calculated in her expression, followed by the slightest nod. It's barely perceptible, but I know that look. It's the same one she wore when we discussed contingency plans, the quiet assurance that she hasn't forgotten our arrangement.

I force myself to breathe normally, though my heart is still racing. This isn't the end. It's barely even the beginning.


Lucas's POV

I gestured to Miles to enable the comment section on the livestream. The notifications from group lit up my phone screen.

Drew's messages came in rapid succession:

"Serena absolutely killed it tonight, right out of the gate!" 

I watched the screen, maintaining my usual composed expression even as Miles cast occasional glances my way.

"What the hell is wrong with these judges?" Drew continued. "Calling her design 'simple'? Don't they understand the difference between simple and minimalist? Even I get that, and I'm just a restaurant owner."

The corner of my mouth twitched slightly. Drew's indignation was amusing, but not entirely misplaced. The bias against Serena was becoming increasingly apparent.

"You know," another message popped up, "Evelyn's got her charms - caught my eye back in the day. But tonight? In Serena's design? She's on another level entirely."

The comment section of the livestream was equally passionate:

"How is this just luck? Serena's talent is undeniable!"

"I used to think Nina's designs were great, but this comparison is brutal..."

"These judges must be blind! Or bought. How else could they downplay Serena's work like this?"

"Still team Nina! She's probably holding back to keep things interesting."

I leaned back in my chair, fingers unconsciously tapping against the armrest as the second round began. The theme "Phantom" flashed across the screen in bold letters. 

Nina first took center stage, her movements confident but somehow rigid. There was something desperate in her efficiency.

Olivia Warren emerged wearing Nina's creation, and I noticed the subtle tremor in Nina's hands as she made final adjustments.

The camera caught Nina's expression as she watched the judges. Her eyes held that familiar look - the same one I'd seen countless times in business meetings when someone from a modest background tried too hard to prove themselves. But there was something else there too: a burning fixation whenever she glanced at Serena.

"Sir," Miles spoke softly, drawing my attention back to the present. "Should I prepare the preliminary reports for tomorrow's meeting?"

I shook my head slightly, my eyes still fixed on the screen. "Let's see this through first."

Serena's POV

"The next presentation will begin in five minutes," a stagehand announced, clipboard in hand.

I nodded, trying to shake off the growing unease in my stomach. The design I'd created for Evelyn was bold but elegant - a silver-white masterpiece that should have made her ethereal. 

I left the workshop area, walked past the changing room where Evelyn was switching into the gown I had designed, and headed to the stage to await her showcase.

The audience's collective gasp drew my attention to the runway. My heart stopped. There, gliding down the catwalk, was Evelyn - but the dress she wore wasn't mine. Instead of my carefully crafted silver-white creation, she was draped in cascading red roses, the fabric moving like liquid fire under the spotlights.

"This is... perfect!" someone in the audience exclaimed.

My fingers dug into my palms as I fought to keep my expression neutral. The dress was stunning, I had to admit - but it wasn't mine. Every fold, every detail screamed of a different designer's touch. It looked similar, but it's all a bit fuzzy in my mind. As Evelyn reached the end of the runway, she threw a practiced smile toward the judges, then caught Nina's eye in the front row.

That's when I saw it - the barely perceptible smirk they shared, a flash of triumph passing between them. 

*I waited outside for Evelyn for fifteen minutes, and in that moment, I knew something was wrong. But I was already on stage - there was no turning back.*

I had prepared myself for the possibility that she might tamper with my dress. I had even planned for it-if she damaged my design, I would mend it right there. I could explain it away, say she accidentally tore it while trying it on. At worst, it would cost me a few impression points, nothing that would significantly impact the final result.

What I never anticipated was that Evelyn would have the audacity to completely switch out the dress in front of everyone.

This couldn't have been a spontaneous decision. From bringing in the dress to the backstage fitting room, to having the staff assist with the change-everything must have been meticulously planned in advance.

Bold move, certainly, but there were no cameras in the fitting room. A dress swap wouldn't be impossible to pull off with the right preparation.

I maintained my composure. It occurred to me, with cold clarity, that my original design had likely already been whisked away by planted staff members. Even if I exposed her now, I had no proof.

After all, for dramatic effect, we designers had been required to work in sealed black rooms from start to finish.

Yes, there were supervisors in those black rooms, but whether they had been bought off by Ian? That wasn't even a question worth asking.

I'd spent so many rounds guarding against Nina and Ian, only to be outmaneuvered in the final round.

"Ladies and gentlemen," the announcer's voice boomed, "please welcome our final contestant of the evening!"

The audience erupted in applause. I remained frozen in place, my mind racing through options. 

When the judges announced their decision, I wasn't surprised. The red rose dress had captured everyone's imagination. Nina approached me after the ceremony, her face a mask of sweet innocence.

"Congratulations, dear sister," she said, eyes glittering with barely concealed satisfaction. "I just knew you would win."

I accepted her embrace, feeling the eyes of the crowd on us. "Thank you, Nina," I replied, my voice steady despite the anger burning in my chest. "It's certainly been an... illuminating evening."
###chapter 103
Lucas's POV

I watched the unexpected scene unfold before me. Despite Serena's clear victory, it was Nina who was drawing the crowd's attention, accepting congratulations with practiced grace. Something felt off about the whole situation, but I couldn't quite place what.

My phone buzzed repeatedly with notifications from our group chat. I glanced down, keeping one eye on the screen.

"@Lucas, what's up with Nina? She's acting different. Another PR stunt to clean up her image?" The message was from Drew.

"Hey, speaking of design - any chance you could ask Serena to design something for me?" Drew's message continued.

Spencer's response was immediate and cutting: "With your build? Don't waste Lucas's future wife's time."

I ignored the bickering that followed, my attention drawn back to the stage as Serena stepped forward to give her acceptance speech. The studio lights caught the elegant lines of her winning design, and for a moment, everything seemed perfect.

Then a voice cut through the applause: "That dress is plagiarized!"

The accusation hung in the air like a thunderclap. I watched as ripples of confusion spread through the audience, my muscles tensing instinctively.

"It's copied from Lumi Nova's collection!" Another voice joined in. "It was in last year's fashion magazine!"

The previously celebratory atmosphere crumbled as murmurs turned to shouts. I noticed security personnel beginning to move along the aisles, but they were too late to prevent what happened next. A plastic bottle arced through the air, followed by others, forcing Serena to step back from the podium.

The host quickly came back to try to calm things down. "To everyone here and watching at home, our network has made a unanimous decision. Firstly, we're not going off the air. We'll finish the final judging with you all watching, so don't worry. Secondly, please keep calm and stay in order, and don't risk your safety by any unnecessary crowding or pushing. Finally, we promise that this competition will be completely fair and give both our contestants and our audience a satisfying ending." 

The host's words helped to quiet the crowd a little.

I watched Serena's face carefully. Where others might have seen a calm mask, I could detect the slight tension around her eyes, the barely perceptible tightening of her jaw. She remained perfectly still, even as the judges huddled in urgent discussion.

Finally, the head judge stepped forward, his expression grave. "After careful comparison with Lumi Nova's 'Shade' collection from last year, we find significant similarities that cannot be ignored. The evidence suggests..." He paused, clearly uncomfortable. "This design appears to be plagiarized."

The comments scrolled endlessly on my screen:

"How disgusting. I can't believe Serena Sinclair would plagiarize."
"And I actually supported her. Makes me sick."
"Compared to her, Nina actually seems like the better person."

The group chat had fallen silent. They knew my temperament well enough - I held grudges, and I wasn't someone to be crossed. I continued tapping my finger against the desk, each tap measuring out my growing fury.

The more I thought about it, the clearer the picture became. Nina's reaction at the show had been too perfect, too practiced. The way she'd arranged her features into shocked disappointment while her eyes gleamed with satisfaction - it was a performance worthy of an award.

Miles stood quietly by my desk, watching my finger tap with growing concern. He'd worked with me long enough to recognize the signs. This wasn't just irritation. This was cold fury.

The social media tide was turning rapidly in Nina's favor. Every refresh brought new praise for her "integrity" and "genuine talent." The orchestrated nature of it all only fueled my anger. Someone had planned this, timed it perfectly to maximize the damage to Serena's reputation.

I finally broke the heavy silence. "Acquire the Whitmore Group."

Miles shifted slightly. "Sir, from a business perspective, the Whitmore Group doesn't offer much value-"

"They're an eyesore." My finger stopped its tapping. In the sudden stillness, those two words carried the weight of an execution order.

I could see Miles processing the implications. The Whitmore Group might not have much business value, but that wasn't the point. This wasn't about business - it was about sending a message.

I stood up, adjusting my cuffs with deliberate precision. The movement was unhurried, controlled - just like my anger. 

"Car. Now. We're going to the venue," I ordered Mile, my voice clipped and icy, my anger held tightly in check.
###chapter 104
Nina's POV

"Completely," Marlon replied. "Lumi's true identity has been one of fashion's best-kept secrets, but today, it's time for the truth to come out."

A flash of movement caught my eye. Serena stood at the edge of the stage, her expression unreadable. She didn't look triumphant or smug - just calm, as if this revelation meant nothing to her. That composure made it even worse.

The competition hall erupted with voices of disbelief. My heart raced as I watched the crowd turn on Serena, their skepticism matching my own desperate hopes.

"Mr. Wright, how can you claim she's Lumi Nova? Where's your proof?" A man near the front row stood up, her voice cutting through the chaos. Others quickly joined in.

"Anyone could claim to be Lumi! She's never shown her face in public!"

Marlon Wright sat calmly at the panel, his expression serene despite the hostility. I studied him carefully, searching for any sign of uncertainty or deception. But his pale blue eyes remained clear and steady.

"Let me tell you about the first time I met her," he began, his voice carrying a gentle warmth that made the crowd lean in despite themselves. "For years, I handled all her design submissions. She was brilliant but completely anonymous - just a name and incredible talent."

My fingers dug into my palms as I watched Serena. She remained motionless, her face betraying nothing.

"Then two years ago," Marlon continued, "she decided to return to her home country. That's when she finally agreed to meet me in person." A slight smile touched his lips. "I still remember my surprise when this beautiful young woman walked into my office. Her designs had always carried such strength and maturity, I'd imagined someone older."

The hall had grown quiet. Too quiet. I could feel the audience's skepticism wavering, being replaced by something else - belief.

No. This couldn't be happening.

"But that's just your word," another voice called out. "How do we know you're telling the truth?"

Marlon's expression shifted, a flash of anger breaking through his composure. "You question my integrity?" His voice carried a sharp edge now. "I am the chief editor and lead designer of this country's most prestigious fashion magazine. My entire career is built on recognizing and nurturing talent."

He stepped forward, his presence suddenly commanding. "I stake my professional reputation on this: Serena Sinclair is Lumi Nova. And anyone who doubts that clearly knows nothing about design."



Serena's POV

The audience's murmurs grew louder, a wave of speculation washing over the studio.

I closed my eyes briefly, memories flooding back. Six years ago, in Paris, when my designs were rejected by major fashion houses. Marlon found me in my tiny workshop, surrounded by crumpled sketches and tears of frustration.

"Your designs aren't the problem, Serena," he had said, his voice gentle but firm. "It's your fear of being seen. The world needs to know the artist behind these masterpieces."

He was right. I'd hidden behind the Lumi Nova persona, terrified that my family's drama would overshadow my work. Marlon helped me navigate the international fashion scene, turning Lumi Nova into a respected name. He never asked for anything in return, except my trust in myself.
My past has made me incredibly guarded, reluctant to trust anyone. The wounds from my original family run deep. If it weren't for Marlon Wright, who moved mountains to protect me, my designs might never have reached the world stage. He helped me transform my life, bringing my work to global recognition.
But just when I reached the pinnacle of my career, I returned home for Ian Whitmore.
I thought finding someone who could accept me-accept my past-was rare. I felt I needed to cherish it, to show gratitude. How naive I was.
To help Ian revive the Whitmore empire, I sacrificed everything. I gave up my thriving career, spent countless nights at business functions. The constant drinking numbed me, drained my passion for design. I lost all inspiration, all creative spark. If Marlon hadn't persistently encouraged me, helped me rediscover my original passion, I wouldn't be standing on this design stage today.
I sacrificed so much for Ian, though I never told him directly. I thought he would see it, feel it, understand my devotion.
The irony cuts deep now.
"I can verify my identity," I spoke clearly into the microphone, my voice cutting through the chaos. The studio fell silent. "Could someone please bring my phone from my dressing room?"

My phone arrived. With steady hands, I typed out a message I'd drafted years ago but never had the courage to send. "To my devoted followers: Today, I, Serena Sinclair, confirm that I am Lumi Nova. My journey as a designer began in shadows, but it's time to step into the light."

The studio erupted in gasps and exclamations as phones lit up with notifications. I looked directly into the main camera. "Everyone can check Lumi Nova's official social media accounts for confirmation."

Marlon's eyes met mine, filled with pride and understanding. I gave him a subtle nod. "Thank you for everything, all these years," I whispered, too soft for the microphones to catch.
###chapter 105
Ian's POV

Looking at Serena now, my face darkens with barely contained rage. All these years together, and I never knew she was Lumi Nova.

Back when we first met, she was performing on the streets. Without my help, she probably would have starved on those foreign streets. When we were together, she mentioned something about a good career opportunity abroad. But that was right when my family's company was in crisis, and my parents called me back home. I dismissed her opportunity as nothing significant - in my mind, it was just another job that would barely pay the bills.

I could sense her reluctance to let it go, but the Whitmore Group meant everything to me. I have to admit, my feelings for her were genuine then, and I selfishly wanted to keep her by my side.

I never imagined how much she would help me. She stood beside me as I entered the family business, worked in public relations, helped secure numerous sponsorships. Initially, her dedication moved me, and I planned to give her a good future.

Then Nina came along.

Nina was completely different from Serena. She was more attentive to my feelings - she could sense my slightest displeasure and worshipped me blindly. She made me feel like a man. Meanwhile, Serena would challenge my decisions in front of the company executives, and worse, they would often take her side. My authority in the Whitmore Group diminished daily, leaving me feeling increasingly frustrated and humiliated.

The stark contrast drew me closer to Nina, leading to that night when I pretended to be drunk. While Serena had barely let me hold her hand during our entire relationship, Nina gave herself to me completely, without asking for any commitments. This increased my affection for her.

Even then, I couldn't bring myself to break up with Serena. Our history was real, and I hesitated to end it - until the shot at our engagement forced my hand when I chose to save Nina, exposing our relationship.

Despite the breakup, I felt I owed Serena something - after all, she had saved the Whitmore Group. I thought I could still look after her, until she moved on to other men. I had always believed she would only love me, and couldn't accept her loving anyone else. That's when I started working against her, determined to make her regret her disloyalty!

But time after time, she proved me wrong. And now, she's become a sensation. I spent so much money on publicity for Nina in this competition, even preparing articles announcing her victory. Just when I had finally pushed Nina to the pinnacle, Serena delivered this devastating blow!

Once again, I've been humiliated by Serena! 

I clench my fists, glaring at her image on the screen with undisguised hatred.



Serena's POV

The stage lights burned against my skin as silence descended over the audience. Under the harsh glare of dozens of cameras, I could feel every eye in the venue fixed on me. 

"We regret to announce that we must disqualify Serena Sinclair from the competition," the host's voice echoed through the venue's sound system. "The rules clearly state that all designs must be original."

I lifted my chin, meeting his gaze directly. "I did create an original design."

The host paused, his professional smile faltering for a moment. "Miss Sinclair, the rules are very clear-"

"Yes, they are." My voice cut through the whispers that had begun to ripple through the crowd. "I followed every rule. My original design was replaced without my knowledge or consent."

A collective gasp rippled through the audience. On the massive LED screens above the stage, I could see my own face, composed and determined, alongside Evelyn's rapidly paling complexion.

"Are you suggesting..." The host trailed off, clearly thrown off script.

"I'm not suggesting anything. I'm stating a fact." I turned slightly, making sure the cameras could capture my next words. "My assistant, Mia, replaced my original design."

In the wings of the stage, I caught sight of Mia's face draining of color. She took an involuntary step backward, nearly stumbling into a lighting rig.

Her panicked look told me I was right.

The murmur from the audience grew louder. 
"OMG plot twist!"
"I knew something was off!"
"Look at Mia's face!"

"These are serious accusations," the host interjected, trying to regain control of the situation. "Do you have proof?"

"When the producers stuck me with an assistant I didn't know, I got this bad feeling, so I planted a hidden camera in my backstage workspace. It totally caught Mia on camera moving my dress in the opposite direction from the dressing room." I kept my voice steady, watching Mia's experssion crumble further.
###chapter 106
Evelyn's POV

Every gaze was fixed on Mia. The spotlights and cameras all centered on her. Under that intense pressure, Mia began shaking uncontrollably, completely panicked. After a long, silent moment, she finally crumbled and open her mouth. 

Her confession hung in the air, each word a nail in my coffin. "Ms. Whitmore made me do it," she'd said, her voice breaking. "She ordered me to switch Ms. Sinclair's dress with the red one." The cameras zoomed in closer, their red recording lights blinking like accusatory eyes.

"Ms. Whitmore." The host's voice cut through the chaos, sharp and unforgiving. "Why did you sabotage Serena Sinclair's dress? What made you resort to such tactics?"

My throat constricted. The words wouldn't come. I could feel my carefully constructed world crumbling around me. Years of building my reputation in the industry, gone in an instant. My fingers trembled as I gripped the microphone, my other hand unconsciously smoothing my designer dress - a nervous habit I'd developed since childhood.

"Nina," I whispered, my eyes desperately seeking out my best friend in the crowd. Nina had always been my safety net, my partner in every scheme. She would help me. She had to.

But when Nina stepped forward, her expression wasn't what I'd expected. Her normally warm eyes were cold, distant. "Evelyn," she began, her voice carrying through the speakers, "I can't believe you would do this. Using such underhanded methods to sabotage my sister..."

My heart stopped. This wasn't the script we'd planned. "Nina, what are you-"

"As much as it pains me," Nina continued, cutting me off, her voice thick with manufactured emotion, "I have to withdraw from the competition. I cannot be associated with such behavior. The crown belongs to my sister, Serena. She's always been the better designer."

The betrayal hit me like a physical blow. My legs weakened, and I had to fight to stay upright. The whispers in the audience grew louder, and I caught fragments of their judgment: "Disgraceful," "Always knew she was fake," "Career over."

The room started spinning. The lights seemed to grow brighter, more accusatory. Somewhere in the chaos, I heard the host asking another question, but the words were lost in the ringing in my ears. My hand flew to my throat, trying to loosen an invisible noose.

I looked at Nina one last time, searching for any sign of our friendship, any hint that this was all a mistake. But she'd already turned away, walking toward Serena with open arms. The perfect picture of sisterly devotion, while I stood alone in the spotlight, abandoned and exposed.




Nina's POV

*How dare she act so righteous*, I thought, watching Serena stand confidently at the microphone. Her words made my blood boil.

"A competition is a competition - there's no room for courtesy," she declared, her voice steady and clear. "I won't accept a victory that people could later dismiss as unearned."

I clenched my fists as she continued addressing the judges: "I trust you'll make your decision based solely on merit, without outside influence. The audience, both here and watching at home, deserves a legitimate outcome."

My anger only grew as the crowd started rallying behind her. They were supposed to be on my side! But now they were calling out:

"Show us Serena's design!"
"Give Serena a fair chance!"
"Let the competition continue - we want a real result!"

*Of course they'd support her*, I fumed silently. *Lumi Nova's designs were always crowd-pleasers*. I watched as the audience's excitement built, knowing my carefully laid plans were starting to unravel. This wasn't how things were supposed to go at all.

I watched as Serena graciously thanked the audience before taking her gown into the backstage, then disappearing into the changing area.

Minutes felt like hours. Then she emerged, and my heart stopped.

There she stood on stage, an ethereal vision that seemed to have stepped right out of a painting. The entire audience fell silent, completely captivated. Not even Hollywood's greatest stars could compare to this moment.

I couldn't tell anymore which enhanced which - whether the exquisite, regal gown elevated her beauty, or her beauty elevated the gown's elegance. They had become one perfect creation.

*It's breathtaking*, I admitted bitterly to myself. *Absolutely breathtaking*.

The beauty before us was beyond description, beyond comparison. And I hated every second of it.

The audience erupted in thunderous applause, she bathed in spotlights that made her glow like some divine being. My stomach churned as I watched her, poised and elegant, accepting the Battle of the Needle trophy with graceful humility. The roar of admiration from the crowd felt like needles in my ears.

"Absolutely stunning!" 
"A masterpiece!"
"Serena Sinclair is truly in a league of her own!"

Each praise felt like a slap across my face. I dug my fingernails into my palms, forcing myself to maintain my composed expression. The cameras were still rolling, after all. I wouldn't give them the satisfaction of capturing my true feelings.

My mind drifted back to that night seven years ago, when I'd finally found a way to crush her. I remember watching from the shadows as she stumbled out of that party, the drug I'd slipped into her drink taking effect. Everything had been perfectly planned - the hired man, the hidden cameras, the scandal that would destroy her pristine reputation forever.

The plan hadn't worked exactly as intended - the man had developed a conscience at the last minute - but fate had smiled upon me anyway. The pregnancy, the miscarriage, the scandal... it had all spiraled beautifully out of control. I'd stood by, playing the concerned sister while watching her world crumble. The way Father had looked at her, the whispers in the halls of our home, the tears in her eyes as she boarded that plane to exile - those memories had sustained me for years.

But now here she was, risen from the ashes I'd scattered her into, more radiant than ever. The way the audience gazed at her with adoration made my blood boil. This wasn't how it was supposed to be. She was supposed to stay broken, stay gone, stay defeated.

"I want to thank everyone for their support," Serena's voice rang clear through the speakers. "To the judges and the show's production team, thank you for giving me the chance to clear my name. This trophy represents more than just a victory - it represents vindication."

Her eyes swept across the audience, and for a brief moment, they met mine. "And remember," she continued, her lips curving into a subtle smile, "karma always comes full circle. What goes around, comes around."
###chapter 107
Serena's POV

The extended four-hour broadcast of *Battle of the Needle* had just wrapped up with unprecedented ratings. Standing in the buzzing studio, I could feel the electric atmosphere of success hanging in the air. Staff members hurried past, exchanging excited whispers about the viewership numbers that kept climbing.

I made my way through the familiar corridor towards Marlon's office. After such a significant achievement, expressing gratitude to him was both professional courtesy and genuine appreciation.

"Marlon," I said, finding him reviewing some papers at his desk. "I wanted to thank you for your support tonight."

He looked up with a satisfied smile. "This is all you, Serena." He shook his head, impressed. "I have to say, I'm looking forward to seeing the full impact of tonight's broadcast."

Our conversation was interrupted by a commotion outside. Through the window, I could see camera flashes lighting up the darkness like lightning strikes. A crowd had gathered at the television station's entrance.

As I approached the lobby, the scene became clearer. Evelyn Whitmore was surrounded by reporters, their microphones thrust forward like weapons. Her usually perfect composure was cracking under the barrage of questions.

"Ms. Whitmore, why did you try to sabotage Serena Sinclair? Were you afraid of the impact on Whitmore Enterprises?" a reporter demanded.

"Was this a calculated move against StarRiver Group?" another voice joined in.

I watched from a distance as Evelyn's carefully maintained facade began to crumble. Her fingers twisted the strap of her designer bag, knuckles white with tension.

"That's enough!" she finally snapped, her voice sharp with hysteria. "Get out of my way! I'm leaving!"

Nina appeared at her side, the picture of concerned friendship. "Evelyn, please calm down," she said softly, though loud enough for the cameras to catch. "These reporters are just doing their jobs."

The false sympathy in Nina's voice made my stomach turn. I knew that look in her eyes - the same calculated gleam I'd seen countless times. She was performing for the cameras, positioning herself as the voice of reason.

SLAP!

Evelyn spun around, her hand connecting with Nina's cheek in a sharp slap that echoed through the lobby. The cameras went wild, capturing every second of the meltdown.

Before the situation could escalate further, a familiar figure cut through the crowd. Jace Gillard, his expression grim, took Evelyn's arm and began leading her away from the chaos. The reporters parted before him, perhaps sensing that the show was over.

I watched them disappear into the night. The sight of Jace's protective gesture stirred a memory of Eleanor. He ended up not being worthy of all the love Eleanor had for him.

Nina stood frozen, her hand still hovering near her reddened cheek. Despite her earlier performance of concern, I caught the flash of genuine surprise in her eyes - not from the slap, but from Ian's continued absence. Her carefully crafted plan was unraveling, and for once, she couldn't hide her disappointment.

The night air grew heavier with tension as the reporters, like sharks sensing new blood, suddenly turned their attention toward me. Camera flashes erupted in a dizzying constellation, temporarily blinding in their intensity. From the corner of my eye, I saw Nina's reluctant retreat, her steps slow and measured as if waiting for one last chance at the spotlight.

"Miss Sinclair!" The reporters closed in, their microphones thrust forward like weapons. "How do you feel about being sabotaged by Evelyn Whitmore in the competition? Aren't you upset?"

I maintained my composure, though exhaustion tugged at the edges of my consciousness. "The truth has a way of revealing itself," I replied, my voice steady. "I believe the ones who should feel hurt aren't necessarily the ones who were targeted."

The crowd pressed closer, the air growing thicker with each passing moment. More questions came rapid-fire, each reporter trying to outshout the others.

"Why did you keep your identity as Lumi Nova secret? Was there a specific reason?"

I felt a familiar weight settle in my chest - the burden of secrets and half-truths. "My reasons for privacy are personal," I said firmly. "I hope everyone can understand and respect that."

The questions continued, but one cut through the noise with particular sharpness: "What do you have to say to Ian Whitmore? After everything he's done to hurt you-"

"Ian Whitmore and I have gone our separate ways," I interrupted, unable to completely mask the weariness in my voice. "His choices are his own to make, and frankly, they no longer concern me. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's getting late."

But the wall of bodies remained impenetrable, cameras still flashing relentlessly in the darkness. The station's exterior lights cast harsh shadows across eager faces, each hoping to capture one more moment of vulnerability. My feet ached in their heels, and the weight of the day pressed down like a physical force.

"Please," I said, summoning what energy I had left, "it's been a long day, and I'd like to go home."
###chapter 108
Serena's POV

The drizzle fell softly around me, tiny droplets catching the fading light. I stood there, acutely aware of the whispers and stares from the crowd gathered outside the venue. My silver-white gown suddenly felt heavier in the dampening air, but I maintained my composure, shoulders back, chin lifted slightly.

That's when I heard it. The distinct purr of luxury engines cutting through the murky disarray. A fleet of gleaming Rolls-Royces emerged from the rain like phantom ships, their chrome accents catching what little light remained in the day. The crowd's whispers grew louder, phones raised to capture the unexpected arrival.

My heart skipped a beat as the central vehicle came to a stop. I knew who it was before the door even opened. Several tall men in black suits emerged first, efficiently deploying umbrellas despite the light rain. Then, he stepped out.

Lucas. Even in the dim light, his presence commanded attention. His tailored black suit was impeccable, and the way he moved spoke of natural grace and authority. The Patek Philippe on his wrist caught a glint of light as he adjusted his grip on the black umbrella. Our eyes met across the distance, and I felt that familiar flutter in my chest.

He walked toward me with measured steps, each movement deliberate and elegant. The crowd seemed to part instinctively before him, creating a path between us. I noticed how the rain seemed to enhance rather than diminish his aura.

As he drew closer, I caught the subtle scent of his cologne mixing with the fresh rain. He stopped before me, close enough that his umbrella now sheltered us both. His grey eyes held mine, and I saw the warmth in them that so few others ever got to witness.

His hand extended toward me, palm up - an invitation. A gesture so simple yet loaded with meaning. I placed my hand in his, feeling the warmth of his skin against mine. His fingers closed around mine with gentle firmness, and I felt anchored, protected.

Camera flashes erupted around us, creating a constellation of artificial stars in the rain. But in that moment, they felt distant, unimportant. The world had narrowed to just us - the warmth of his hand, the shelter of his umbrella, the private smile we shared.

As we walked to the car together, I was aware of the picture we must have presented - the kind of scene that would dominate society pages tomorrow. But for once, I didn't care about the headlines or speculation. The only thing that mattered was the steady presence beside me, the way his thumb brushed almost imperceptibly across my knuckles as he helped me into the car.

The door closed with a soft thud, sealing us away from the world outside. Through the tinted windows, the rain-soaked scene became a watercolor painting of lights and shadows. 

The elevator climbed smoothly to the top of Harrington Holdings, my heart keeping pace with each ascending floor. The familiar ping announced our arrival, and as the doors opened, I caught my breath.

The helipad stretched before us, a sleek helicopter waited. Manhattan's skyline provided a stunning backdrop, the city's lights beginning to twinkle in the dark.

"Congratulations, Miss Sinclair." Lucas's voice was formal, but his eyes held that private warmth I was beginning to know so well. Before I could respond, Miles approached, carrying what had to be the most exquisitely arranged bouquet of roses I'd ever seen.

"Boss spent the entire morning preparing these roses himself," Miles commented, his usually stoic expression betraying a hint of amusement. I looked at Lucas in surprise, noting the almost imperceptible shift in his posture - was that embarrassment?

The roses were perfect, each bloom carefully selected and arranged. The wrapping paper bore subtle creases that spoke of meticulous attention, far from the polished precision of professional florists. Something about those small imperfections made my heart swell.

Without thinking, I rose on my tiptoes and pressed a quick kiss to Lucas's cheek. The moment my lips touched his skin, I froze, horrified at my impulsiveness. I pulled back quickly, feeling heat rush to my face. Lucas stood perfectly still, but I caught the slight upturn of his lips and the deepening warmth in his grey eyes.

"I... thank you," I managed, clutching the roses like a lifeline. The helicopter's blades began to turn, sending a warm breeze across the helipad.

"Shall we?" Lucas gestured toward the waiting aircraft.

Reality crashed back in. "Wait, what? Where are we going?"

"The Bahamas." He stated it as simply as if he were suggesting lunch.

"I didn't bring any luggage," I protested weakly.

"Already packed for you." His smile grew more pronounced.

"I have meetings tomorrow..."

"Rescheduled."

"......"

"Your passport's already packed too," he added, clearly enjoying my flustered state.

The rotor blades picked up speed, drowning out any further protests I might have made. Lucas's hand found the small of my back, guiding me toward the helicopter. I should have been annoyed at his high-handedness, should have insisted on maintaining my carefully planned schedule. Instead, I found myself fighting back a smile.

"You promised me three months," he reminded me, his lips close to my ear to be heard over the noise. "I'm simply collecting on that promise."

As we settled into the plush interior of the helicopter, Manhattan spread out below us like a jeweled carpet.
###chapter 109
Eleanor's POV

I leaned back against the leather seat of my car, eyes closed, trying to shed the emotional weight of tonight's scene. Six hours of filming a breakdown, and my character's pain still clung to me like a second skin.

"You did amazing tonight, Eleanor," Alice's voice came softly from the front seat. "Take some rest. We've got about forty minutes until we reach your place."

I managed a slight nod, not opening my eyes. The gentle hum of the car's engine and the distant sound of late-night traffic were almost enough to lull me into sleep.

"Did you see what happened at Battle of the Needle today?" My assistant's excited whisper caught my attention. "It was like watching a movie unfold in real time."

My eyes fluttered open. "What about it? Did Serena win?"

"She absolutely crushed it!" The enthusiasm in my assistant's voice made me smile despite my exhaustion. She caught herself and quickly added, "Though of course, you're still my number one idol, Eleanor."

I waved off her concern, sitting up straighter. "Tell me everything."

"Well, Evelyn tried to sabotage Serena's performance," my assistant continued, her voice dropping conspiratorially. "But Serena caught on and turned the tables. You should have seen Evelyn's face when her plan backfired. It was epic!"

The satisfaction in her voice matched the warmth spreading through my chest. I reached for my phone, curious to see the coverage for myself. A quick search brought up dozens of articles, and I found myself smiling at the headlines praising Serena's victory.

Then my thumb froze mid-scroll.

There, beneath the competition coverage, was a photo that felt like a punch to the gut: Jace escorting Evelyn from the venue, his hand protectively at her elbow. The timestamp showed it was taken just hours ago.

"Eleanor?" Alice's concerned voice seemed to come from very far away. "You should try to get some sleep. It's been a long day."

"Yes," I murmured, letting my phone drop into my lap. "Just resting my eyes."

I turned toward the window, grateful for the darkness that hid my reflection. A single tear rolled down my cheek, and I quickly wiped it away. 

"How can Jace throw away his reputation like this?" assistant's voice rose with indignation. "Doesn't he know that anyone associated with Evelyn right now will be-"

"That's enough," Alice cut in sharply. I caught her quick glance in my direction through the rearview mirror. "Eleanor needs to rest."

I kept my expression carefully neutral, though my fingers tightened imperceptibly around my phone. 

By the time we reached Serena's apartment, the city had settled into its late-night quiet. I expected to find lights on, perhaps even a small celebration for her victory. Instead, darkness greeted me.

"Serena?" My voice echoed in the empty space. No answer.

I pulled out my phone again, this time dialing Serena's number. Straight to voicemail. I tried Lucas next, with the same result. A knot of worry began to form in my stomach.

After a moment's hesitation, I called Drew.

"Eleanor! To what do I owe this late-night pleasure?"

"Have you seen Lucas? I can't reach him or Serena."

There was a telling pause on the other end. "No idea, but after Serena's stunning performance tonight... let's just say if I were Lucas, I wouldn't be answering my phone either."

"Drew," I warned, though I couldn't help but smile slightly.

"Hey, want to grab a drink? Sounds like you could use one."

I sank deeper into Serena's plush sofa. "Not tonight. We're wrapping up filming soon. I'll have a few days off after that - I promise to make it up to you then."

"I'll hold you to that," he chuckled before hanging up.

The apartment
 fell silent again. I found myself wondering, not for the first time, how long it takes to forget someone. To unlearn the way he smile, the sound of his laugh, the feeling of his hand at your elbow.

Some say time heals all wounds. But sitting alone in the dark, watching the city lights dance across empty walls, I wondered if some memories simply refuse to fade - if some people leave marks on our hearts that no amount of time can erase.
###chapter 110
Lucas's POV

The door of the ocean-view suite clicked shut behind us. Serena had fallen asleep during our drive after the airport, her breathing soft and even against my shoulder. 

I carried her to the bedroom, careful not to wake her. The six-hour flight and subsequent drive had clearly taken their toll. Her head rested naturally against my chest, blond hair cascading over my arm.

Setting her down gently on the king-sized bed, I took a moment to study her features. The usual sharp intelligence that animated her face had softened in sleep, replaced by a rare vulnerability that stirred something protective in my chest. Without thinking, I reached out to brush a strand of hair from her cheek.

The ocean breeze rustled the gauzy curtains, carrying with it the rhythmic sound of waves. I adjusted the air conditioning to a comfortable temperature and pulled a light blanket over her sleeping form.

Just as I was heading toward the bathroom for a shower, a phone buzzed quietly. I moved swiftly to silence it before it could disturb Serena. Eleanor's name flashed across the screen.

"Yes?" I kept my voice low, moving away from the bed.

"Lucas? Is Serena okay?" Eleanor's voice carried a distinct note of concern.

"She's sleeping."

"Oh." A pause. "Listen, you better not-"

"She's safe with me." My tone was firm but not unkind. I understood Eleanor's protective instincts toward Serena.

"But you can't just-" Eleanor's voice rose slightly. "I mean, you're both alone and-"

"Manage your own affairs, Eleanor. I'm going to bed." I ended the call before she could protest further, setting the phone on silent.



Serena's POV

Consciousness returned slowly, like waves lapping at the shore of my mind. The first thing I noticed was unfamiliar softness beneath me - different from my own bed. My thoughts felt foggy, disconnected. Where was I?

I forced my heavy eyelids open. Dim evening light filtered through floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating an unknown room. Luxurious and intelligent, the sound of the sea filling the air, and an endless blue horizon. The salty tang of the air was refreshing as I looked out at the vast ocean. The last clear memory I had was being in the car with Lucas, heading to... Sandals Royal Bahamian? Everything after that was a blur.

Alarm shot through me as full awareness hit. My clothes felt different against my skin. I sat up abruptly, heart pounding as I looked down at myself. Instead of my original gown, I was wearing a silk pajama I'd never seen before.

With trembling fingers, I checked underneath. My underwear was gone.

"How could I have been so careless?" I muttered, angry at myself for letting my guard down around Lucas. Just because he'd shown a gentler side lately didn't mean...

"Are you writing a screenplay in your head, Serena?"

The low voice made me jump. Lucas stood in the doorway, his tall frame silhouetted against the hall light. How long had he been watching me?

"When did you get here?" I demanded, pulling the blanket higher despite being fully dressed.

"Long enough." His lips curved in that infuriating half-smile. "I've seen everything there is to see, anyway."

Heat rushed to my face - both from embarrassment at being caught checking myself and fury at his deliberately ambiguous response. "What exactly does that mean?"

Instead of answering, he gestured toward a door. "Your luggage is in the walk-in closet. Everything's been unpacked. There are people preparing for dinner, so you might want to put on some underwear before joining us."

I grabbed a pillow and hurled it at the doorway, but he'd already stepped back, closing the door with a soft click. His quiet chuckle drifted through the wood, a slight smile plays on my lips.
###chapter 111
Serena's POV

The space was vast, dominated by an enormous bed beneath a stunning starlit ceiling. Countless points of light twinkled above, creating an illusion of infinite space that felt both dreamlike and surreal.

Making my way to the window, I pushed open the tall glass pane. The ocean spread before me, an endless expanse of dark water catching moonlight on its rolling waves. The breeze carried the distinct scent of salt and sea, refreshingly cool against my skin. I allowed myself a moment to appreciate the view before turning toward the walk-in closet.

The closet stopped me in my tracks. Our clothes hung side by side - my blouses next to his crisp shirts, my dresses alongside his suits. The casual intimacy of it sent an unexpected flutter through my chest. I quickly selected the most conservative loungewear I could find, a cream-colored cashmere set that felt like armor against my sudden awareness of our shared space.

Descending the curved staircase, I caught sight of Lucas in the living room below. He sat with characteristic grace on a leather sofa, one leg crossed over the other as he scrolled through his phone. His white loungewear softened his usual commanding presence, though nothing could fully mask the natural authority he carried. In the open kitchen beyond him, a chef worked quietly at breakfast preparations.

Lucas looked up as I reached the bottom step, his grey eyes warming with a smile that made my pulse skip. Without a word, he rose and crossed to me, his hand finding mine with natural ease. His fingers threaded through mine, warm and sure, and I found myself allowing the intimate gesture.

"Did you sleep well?" he asked, his voice carrying that particular low tone that seemed reserved for early mornings and private moments.

"Yes, thank you," I managed, aiming for composure despite being acutely aware of our joined hands and the chef's discreet presence.

Lucas guided me toward the dining area. "Dinner can be served," he called over his shoulder, settling me into a chair with the kind of old-world courtesy that seemed to come naturally to him.
 
Course after course of exquisite dishes arrived, each one more elegant than the last. The servant poured rich red wine into our glasses, the deep burgundy liquid catching the soft lighting.

Looking at the spread of premium ingredients before me, I suddenly realized how hungry I actually was.

"Please, eat," Lucas said, his voice gentle.

I didn't need to be told twice. Taking up my knife and fork, I dug in. We were both famished, it seemed.

We ate in comfortable silence for about half an hour, until the edge was finally taken off my hunger. "How long are we staying here?" I asked, breaking the quiet.

"How long would you like to stay?" Lucas countered, a subtle smile playing at his lips.

I shot him a look. "As if my opinion matters."

Lucas actually chuckled at that. "You're becoming quite perceptive, Serena."

I rolled my eyes.

"About a week," he finally offered.

*About?* I frowned at the vagueness.

"Unless we find ourselves reluctant to leave," he teased, his grey eyes twinkling.

"Lucas," I said, feeling my temper rise, "I haven't properly arranged anything at work. We just won the competition - NBC wants to collaborate with StarRiver on the fashion line. Who are they supposed to work with while I'm not there?"

"Miles will handle it," Lucas replied with complete confidence.

I stared at him.

"This week, your only responsibility is to enjoy yourself," he stated matter-of-factly.

I remained silent. With Lucas, it seemed, negotiations were never really an option.

My phone buzzed against the table, drawing my attention from the conversation. Eleanor's name flashed across the screen - three missed calls from earlier this evening. 

Lucas's hand covered mine before I could pick up the phone. "Eleanor called?" His tone was casual, but his eyes held a hint of worry. He knew as well as I did about Eleanor's recent struggles.

"Yes, I should call her back." I gently pulled my hand free.

He leaned back in his chair, his posture relaxed but his gaze intent. I could feel him watching as I stepped away from the table, moving closer to the windows.

Eleanor answered on the first ring. "Finally awake, you two?" Her voice carried its usual playful lilt, though something felt slightly forced about her cheerfulness.

"Eleanor..." I started, but she cut me off with a laugh.

"Oh come on, I meant 'awake.' Though if other things happened..." She let the suggestion hang in the air, and I could practically see her waggling eyebrows.

I felt heat rise to my cheeks, grateful she couldn't see my face. "How are you doing? Are you okay being alone?"

"Of course I'm fine!" Her voice took on that particular brightness that made my heart ache. "Remember what my brother said - I've been navigating the entertainment industry solo since I was eighteen. So enjoy your getaway, I can take care of myself."

The forced lightness in her tone made me want to reach through the phone and hug her. Some wounds needed time before they could be touched, even by friends.

"How long are you staying there?" she asked, smoothly changing the subject.

"Lucas mentioned a week," I replied, watching his reflection in the window. He was still at the table, pretending to read something on his phone while obviously listening to my side of the conversation.

"Ah, right - the Harrington anniversary celebration is next week." There was a knowing quality to Eleanor's voice that made me turn back toward Lucas. He met my gaze steadily, a slight curve on his lips.

"Eleanor..." I started again, wanting to circle back to how she was really doing, to talk about Jace and everything that had happened.

"Don't worry about me," she interrupted firmly. "I'm stronger than I look. Always have been."
###chapter 112
Eleanor's POV

I ended the call with Serena, a faint smile lingering on my face. It was touching how she always checked in on me, even with everything going on in her life. 

The smile faded as I glanced around the busy set. Everyone was rushing about, but somehow no one was calling for me. *Weren't I supposed to be shooting my next scene by now? I'd been sitting in this chair for what felt like hours.*

"Hey, Sarah?" I called out to my assistant, trying to keep my voice light. "Any word on when we're starting the next scene?"

She hurried over, clutching her tablet. "Let me check right away."

I watched her scurry off, drumming my fingers against the armrest. The waiting wasn't what bothered me - that was part of the job. But something felt off about today's schedule. The bedroom scene had been on the shooting list for weeks, and suddenly there was all this hesitation?

When Sarah returned, her expression told me everything before she even opened her mouth. "They're... making some adjustments to the schedule," she said carefully.

"What kind of adjustments?" I sat up straighter.

"Director Gillard said he'll explain-"

I was already on my feet. I spotted Jace by the monitors, deep in conversation with the cinematographer.

"Jace." My voice cut through the general buzz of the set. "When exactly are we shooting my scene?"

He turned slowly, and I knew. I just knew. "Eleanor. We're working on finding a suitable body double first. Once that's settled-"

"Body double?" The words came out sharp enough to make nearby crew members flinch. "Who said anything about a body double?"

"That's the production's decision." His tone was dismissive, like he was talking to some newcomer who didn't know how things worked. "It's not up for discussion."

I stepped closer, lowering my voice but hardening each word. "I. Don't. Need. One."

"Look," he sighed, finally turning away from the monitors. "You're a great actress, Eleanor. But for this particular scene-"

"For this particular scene, you want to replace me with someone else's body while keeping my face? Without even discussing it with me first?" Blood rushed to my face. "I've been preparing for this scene for weeks. It's crucial for my character's development-"

"The decision's been made." He cut me off, already turning back to the monitors. "Your contract gives us this discretion. You'll be notified once we're ready to shoot."

I stood there, anger bubbling beneath my skin. After all these years, I knew Jace Gillard's stubborn nature all too well. Every rejection, every dismissal - they had become as familiar as my own reflection.

"At least give me one chance to prove myself," I said, fighting to keep my voice steady. "Why shut me down without even trying? What makes you so sure I can't handle this scene?"

The set had gone eerily quiet. Even the usual background chatter of the crew had died down to nothing. Jace remained focused on his monitors, his jaw set in that familiar, unmovable way.

"This intimate scene is mandatory from the investors," he finally said, his voice clinical and detached. "There will be multiple close-ups. I can't guarantee what will make it past the censors, but I need to deliver something."

A bitter laugh escaped my throat. "Oh, I get it now." The words came out dripping with sarcasm. "Is it because my body isn't good enough for your artistic vision, Director Gillard?"

He finally turned to face me, his expression hardening. "That's why you're not suitable."

Those five words hit harder than any lengthy explanation could have. My hands clenched into fists at my sides, memories flooding back unbidden. That night years ago, stumbling toward him after one too many drinks, desperate to close the distance between us. The sharp pain as my head hit the corner of his desk when he pushed me away. The scar hidden beneath my hairline - a permanent reminder of my foolishness.

"Perfect," I spat out. My foot connected with the nearest chair, sending it crashing to the floor. The sound echoed through the silent set like a gunshot. "Absolutely perfect."

I turned and walked away, my heels clicking against the floor in sharp, angry staccatos. Behind me, I heard Jace's voice, steady and professional as ever: "Everyone back to work. We're moving on to scene twenty-three."
###chapter 113
Serena's POV

I stood by the windows, watching the waves lap against the pristine shore below. Earlier call kept replaying in my mind.

"How's Eleanor doing?" I asked, trying to keep my voice casual as I turned to look at Lucas. He sat at the desk, focused on his laptop screen, probably handling another endless stream of emails.

"She needs time," he replied without looking up, his fingers continuing their steady rhythm on the keyboard.

"Time?" I couldn't keep the edge from my voice. "Lucas, she's your cousin. The one you've protected since she was little."

That finally made him pause. His grey eyes met mine, calm and steady in a way that suddenly irritated me. "Which is exactly why I need to handle this carefully."

"By taking Jace's side?" The words came out sharper, but I couldn't stop myself. "Eleanor has looked up to you her entire life. You're her perfect big brother figure who's always supposed to be on her side."

Lucas closed his laptop with deliberate care. "And because I care about her, I need to help her understand that you can't force someone's feelings."

"I can't believe you." I let out a harsh laugh. "So Jace is always right in your eyes?"

"This isn't about right or wrong, Serena." His voice remained maddeningly level. "Eleanor deserves someone who truly loves her."

"Eleanor deserves someone who won't stomp on her heart!" I snapped back. "You men are all the same. You talk about protecting people, but when it really matters, you just stand there and watch them get hurt."

Lucas stood up slowly, his tall frame backlit by the last rays of sunlight. "Sometimes protecting someone means letting them face the truth, even when it hurts."

I turned away from him, pulling out my phone to distract myself. The news headlines immediately caught my eye - apparently, the media had been busy. Article after article praised my recent business decisions while tearing into Ian's reputation. The contrast was stark: I was portrayed as the resilient heiress who had risen above betrayal, while Ian was painted as a social climber who had traded loyalty for ambition.

"The Whitmore empire's desperate attempts to salvage their heir's reputation through paid articles seem to be backfiring," one headline declared. I could almost taste the schadenfreude in the writer's tone.

"Your PR team is doing an excellent job," Lucas commented, having moved to read over my shoulder.

I locked my phone screen with more force than necessary. "Don't change the subject. We were talking about Eleanor."

"Were we?" His voice held a note of knowing that made me want to scream. "Or were we talking about how some wounds still haven't healed?"

I whirled to face him. "This has nothing to do with Ian or my past. This is about Eleanor, who's probably crying her eyes out right now while you sit here defending the man who broke her heart!"

"Eleanor's strong," Lucas said softly. "Stronger than you're giving her credit for. Just like you were."

The parallel he was drawing hung in the air between us, unwelcome and uncomfortable. I grabbed my purse from the nearby chair. "I need some air. Don't wait up."

As I walked toward the door, his voice followed me: "Running away won't help her either, Serena."

I paused with my hand on the doorknob, not turning around. "No, but at least I'm not pretending that standing still is the same thing as standing up for someone."

The door clicked shut behind me with a quiet finality, leaving Lucas alone in the room.

When I returned to the suite, my feelings have settled a lot. The room was dimly lit, with only a floor lamp casting a warm glow near where Lucas sat, his attention still focused on his laptop. I sank into the armchair across from him, pulling out my phone more out of habit than interest.

The headlines immediately caught my eye. Nina's latest media manipulation was impossible to miss - she'd managed to turn the whole situation with Ian into a narrative that painted her as an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire. The comments section was flooded with sympathetic responses. I had to admit, she'd gotten better at this game.

"Nina's quite the media strategist now," I remarked, scrolling through another artfully crafted article.

Lucas glanced up. "Does that concern you?"

"Not concern exactly." I locked eyes with him. "Let's call it... healthy vigilance."

Before he could respond, a new notification popped up. The hashtag #SerenaSinclairsDarkKnight was trending. I tapped on it, and there we were - a photograph from that night at the station. I was wearing the silver-white gown that had caught the camera flashes like starlight, while Lucas stood beside me, his face partially hidden but his presence unmistakable. Even with his features obscured, there was no disguising that aristocratic bearing.

I found myself studying his face - the sharp line of his jaw, the intensity in his grey eyes. The room suddenly felt warmer than it had a moment ago.

"Don't look at me like that," he said softly.

"Like what?"

"Like you're trying to see through me." His voice dropped lower. "It makes me want to kiss you."

My heart skipped a beat, but I managed to keep my voice steady, though it trembled slightly. "That's a rather presumptuous thing to say," I said, trying to sound annoyed.

"Is it?" He leaned forward slightly. "Your pulse says otherwise."

I realized I was unconsciously touching my neck and quickly dropped my hand, feeling my cheeks flush. "You're impossibly arrogant," I scoffed. 

"Confident," he corrected, amusement dancing in his eyes. "There's a difference."

"Why did you hide your face that night?" The question slipped out before I could stop it.

Lucas closed his laptop, his full attention now on me. "Wasn't that the deal? No public acknowledgment of our relationship?"
###chapter 114
Serena's POV

I pressed my lips together, wrestling with my thoughts. *Yes, I had said that, and I truly didn't want to go public with our relationship. Being with Lucas... I wasn't entirely confident about it. Perhaps I had developed some feelings, or maybe I just couldn't resist his kindness.*

*But after what happened with Ian, combined with growing up in the Sinclair household, trusting anyone had become incredibly difficult for me. Going public would only complicate things. Beyond my fears about whether this relationship would last, I worried that Lucas's prominent position would become another obstacle in my path. Right now, all I wanted was to handle my own affairs independently. I couldn't bear the thought of tethering myself to anyone else.*

"Yes," I responded quietly, the single word carrying the weight of all my unspoken doubts.

"Serena," Lucas continued, his reflection taking a step closer, "shouldn't you give me a deadline? When will you allow me to acknowledge us publicly?"

The weight of StarRiver Group's future pressed against my shoulders, a constant reminder of why I couldn't afford any distractions. Yet here I was, my heart betraying my carefully constructed walls every time Lucas was near.

"I-" The words caught in my throat. 

Lucas's reflection showed him running a hand through his dark hair-a rare gesture of frustration from someone who usually maintained perfect composure. "I understand your concerns about StarRiver's situation," he said quietly. "But I'm not asking for a public announcement. I'm just asking for a timeline. Even if it's ten years from now."

The absurdity of his statement made me turn around. "Ten years?"

His gray eyes held mine with unwavering intensity. "For you, I've learned to wait. Whether it's a moment, a year, or a decade."

Something in my chest tightened at his words. This was exactly what I feared- his sincere words were fatal. I turned back to the window, watching as a plane's lights blinked across the night sky.

"The board meeting is next week," I said finally, deflecting. "I need to focus on that first."

Lucas didn't push further, but I heard him move closer. His presence radiated warmth behind me, close enough that I could catch the subtle scent of his cologne. "Then I'll help you prepare for it. That's what partners do, whether public or private."

I closed my eyes, feeling the familiar conflict rise within me. Part of me wanted to lean back into his strength, to accept the support he so freely offered. But the other part-the part shaped by years of family politics and corporate machinations-whispered warnings about dependency and vulnerability.

"I can handle it myself," I murmured.

"I know you can." His voice carried no hurt, only quiet conviction. "That's not why I'm offering."

"Sometimes," Lucas said softly, "strength isn't about handling everything alone. It's about choosing who to trust with your vulnerabilities."

His words hit too close to home, and I felt my carefully maintained composure crack slightly. "And what if that choice is wrong?" I whispered, voicing the fear that had haunted me since Ian's betrayal.

"Then you learn and grow stronger," he replied. "But you don't let one wrong choice deny you all the right ones."

My feelings for Lucas aren't nearly as cold as they used to be. Something is growing, taking root in my heart faster than I can control. The way he commands every situation, his unwavering presence... I find myself defenseless against it.

His intensity leaves me no place to hide, and truthfully, I'm not sure I want to hide anymore. The feelings are there, sprouting and growing stronger with each passing day.

But there's this weight in my chest, these doubts that won't let go. How long will it take for me to truly let down these walls I've built? When will I be ready to give myself completely to this relationship, without any reservations? It feels unfair to Lucas, moving forward into something deeper when I'm still carrying all this emotional baggage. He deserves someone who can give their whole heart, and right now... I'm not sure I can be that person.

Lucas clearly recognized my inner conflict. A touch of sadness flickered in his eyes. He paused for a moment, then shifted the conversation.

"Why hide being Lumi Nova?" His voice was gentle but direct, carrying genuine curiosity rather than accusation.

I tensed involuntarily, though I couldn't deny the care evident in his words. "I never intended to keep it hidden," I said softly, "but my mother asked me not to tell anyone."

"If I'm not mistaken," Lucas said, his tone suddenly taking on an oddly playful edge, "your mother passed away years ago? Unless... she's been appearing in dreams? Or perhaps rising from the grave!"

I shot him a sharp look, startled by his irreverent words. But something in his slight smile made the knot in my chest loosen unexpectedly. It was the first time anyone had spoken so lightly about my mother's death, and strangely, it felt a weight lifting from my chest. The tension eased, replaced by an unexpected lightness.

"My design talent must be largely inherited. When I was little, my mother personally taught me design. Actually, my mother was also an internationally renowned designer, but she was extremely low-key and never participated in competitions, always keeping her identity hidden. When I was very young, my mother told me that if one day my designs were recognized, I should never reveal my identity to the public."

Lucas looked surprised.

To be honest, I was too, thinking back on it now.

"I never understood why my mother insisted on this, perhaps she was worried about drawing too much attention. But..." I tried hard to recall my mother's face as I spoke, "my mother wasn't actually the type to just accept things passively. That's why I couldn't understand why she would make such a request of me. Sadly, she's no longer here, and I'll never know the answer. She was the only person in this world I truly trusted, the only one who genuinely cared for me. I'll always keep her words close to my heart."

Lucas fell silent.
I could tell he was also pondering why my mother would make such a request of her daughter, why someone who was clearly a top designer would choose to remain anonymous.

"If it weren't for Evelyn's trap this time, I probably would have kept hiding it forever," I said softly.
I felt somewhat dejected about not being able to fulfill my mother's wishes.

Lucas must have sensed my mood shift because he tried to comfort me. "Actually, sometimes life's regrets turn out to be the best arrangements in disguise. Your mother didn't want to see you being bullied like this. Maybe she had a change of heart and rearranged your fate, forcing you to reveal your identity under these circumstances."

I looked at Lucas.
Though it sounded a bit like sweet talk, I had to admit it did comfort me.

"I hope so," I smiled slightly, feeling more at peace.
After all, my mother had always said never to make things difficult for myself.
If there were things I couldn't prevent, I could only accept them gracefully.

Lucas remained quiet, giving me space to process my thoughts. Finally, he spoke again. "There is one thing you said earlier that I have to disagree with."

I turned to look at him, curious despite myself. The expression on his face was unreadable in the dim light, but his voice carried an undercurrent of something I couldn't quite identify.

"What's that?"
###chapter 115
Serena's POV

"You said the only person who ever cared about you was your mother," he spoke quietly, his voice carrying that distinctive tone that always seemed to reach straight into my chest. "That's not accurate."

I tilted my head, confused. "What do you mean?"

"There's me." The simplicity of his statement caught me off guard, delivered with such matter-of-fact certainty that I couldn't help but let out a small laugh.

"You really never miss a chance, do you?" I meant it to sound teasing, but my voice came out softer than intended. Lucas had a way of doing that - turning my defenses into gentle surrenders without even trying.

He moved closer, guiding my head to rest against him. The warmth of his body seeped through his shirt, and I found myself relaxing despite my usual guardedness. "Your mother came to me in a dream," he said, his voice carrying a hint of playfulness I rarely heard. "She asked me to take care of you in her place."

The ridiculous statement should have made me roll my eyes. Instead, I felt something crack inside my chest - a wall I'd built so carefully, developing its first significant fissure. Trust Lucas to break through my defenses with such an absurd, sweet lie.

"Lucas..." I kept my eyes fixed on the shadows playing across the floor. "I need some time."

His hand found my shoulder, steady and warm. "You have all the time you need. I'm not going anywhere."

The silence that followed was comfortable, filled with unspoken understanding. Then, because he was still Lucas Harrington, he had to ruin it.

"It's getting late," he murmured, his voice taking on a playful edge. "Should we go to bed?"

My entire body tensed, and I jerked away from him, feeling my face flush hot. His quiet chuckle only made it worse.

"While I'm aware my looks could be considered very attractive," he said, his voice rich with amusement, "I won't compromise my principles without a legal commitment."

"You're impossible," I muttered, but couldn't help the smile tugging at my lips. Trust Lucas to diffuse tension with his particular brand of dry humor.

"Of course," he continued, his voice taking on an exaggerated tone of helplessness, "you knows I'm physically weak. If you were to use force..." He paused deliberately, eyes twinkling with mischief. "I wouldn't be able to resist." He seemed to take far too much pleasure in my flustered state.

"Your room is on the second floor," he said, his voice returning to its usual calm timbre. "I'll be staying on the first floor." Then, because he apparently couldn't help himself, he added, "By the way, the hotel staff helped change your clothes earlier. Please don't sully my reputation."

I wanted to roll my eyes at his talk of protecting his virtue, but something in his careful consideration touched me. Even in jest, he was always conscious of my comfort and boundaries.

"Get some rest, Serena. I'll see you in the morning." he said softly.

As I watched him leave, I realized that maybe my mother wasn't the only one who had ever truly cared for me. Maybe she had sent someone else to make sure I wouldn't be alone - even if he did have the worst timing with his jokes.

The next morning, I woke to brilliant sunshine streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows. My phone showed only one message - from Eleanor. The silence from everyone else was telling, but surprisingly peaceful.

I stepped onto the balcony, letting the sea breeze wash over me. The view was breathtaking - crystal clear waters stretching to the horizon, waves catching the morning light like scattered diamonds.

A movement below caught my eye. I looked down at the private pool and felt my breath catch in my throat. Lucas was swimming laps, his powerful strokes cutting cleanly through the water. As he reached the pool's edge and pulled himself up, I couldn't help but stare. Water cascaded down his sculpted chest, his usually perfect hair falling carelessly across his forehead. The sight of his lean muscles and sharp jawline made my heart skip a beat.

I quickly turned away, pressing my suddenly warm cheeks against the cool morning air. 

Lucas's voice drifted up from the pool below. "Want to swim?"

"No." The refusal came automatically, even as I remembered how graceful he had looked cutting through the water moments ago.

"Can't swim?"

"That's not it." I crossed my arms, trying to maintain some semblance of resistance.

"I'll wait." His tone held that familiar quiet certainty that told me the matter was already decided.

I found myself analyzing my own reaction - how easily I yielded to his suggestions when they didn't conflict with my principles. It was both frustrating and fascinating how this man, with his hundreds of careful calculations, always seemed to know exactly how far he could push.

After changing into the leopard-print swimsuit, I wrapped myself tightly in the plush robe. The glass staircase leading to the pool felt unnecessarily exposed, though I knew the area was completely private. Lucas was waiting by the water's edge, still managing to look impossibly elegant despite being half-dressed.

"Like what you see?" he asked, noticing my lingering gaze.

"Not particularly." I forced myself to sound dismissive, though the morning light highlighting the planes of his chest made that increasingly difficult.

"Lying to yourself again." His smile held that knowing edge that always made me want to prove him wrong.

Perhaps that's what prompted my next ill-advised comment. "Have you forgotten how I threw up in your hospital room?"

The shift in his expression was immediate - playfulness vanishing into something darker. Before I could process the change, his hand closed around my wrist, and the world tilted. A startled gasp escaped me as I hit the water, the shock of cold momentarily overwhelming my senses.

When I surfaced, sputtering and disoriented, my first coherent thought was the realization that I had, once again, underestimated Lucas's capacity for surprise.
###chapter 116
Serena's POV

I adjusted the strap of my leopard-print swimsuit, acutely aware of Lucas's gaze sliding over me. His lips curved into a subtle smirk.

"Admiring the view, Lucas?" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

"The suit suits you," he replied with characteristic smoothness, his eyes twinkling. I felt heat rise to my cheeks and turned away, pretending to examine the pool.

"Did you have Walter pack my luggage?" I asked, aiming for casual but hearing the slight edge in my voice. The idea of someone going through my personal items didn't sit well with me.

Lucas's smile widened. "Walter doesn't have quite the eye for fashion. Your navy silk pajamas and cream robe are in the second drawer of your bedside table, by the way."

I blinked, caught off guard by his attention to detail. Something fluttered in my stomach, but I pushed the feeling aside. "You packed it yourself?"

"Someone had to make sure you had everything you needed." He walked to the pool's edge, his movements deliberate and graceful. "Care for a race?"

I studied him skeptically. "A race?"

"One lap." He gestured at the Olympic-sized pool. "I'll even give you a half-lap head start. Winner gets to make one request."

I bit back a smile, keeping my expression carefully neutral. "That's quite generous of you."

"I try to be fair," he said with mock solemnity.

"And no backing out of the request?" I asked, testing the water with my toe.

"You have my word." His gray eyes held mine, sending an unexpected shiver down my spine despite the humid air.

"Fine," I agreed, trying to sound reluctant. "But no cheating."

"Naturally."

I slipped into the water, savoring its cool embrace. Swimming had always been my sanctuary, though few people knew about my competitive background. I took my position, purposefully adopting a decent but unremarkable freestyle form.

"Ready?" Lucas called out.

I nodded, and he began counting down. I started swimming at a measured pace, hearing him enter the water behind me. I kept my strokes steady, listening to him gaining ground. Just as I sensed him about to pull ahead, I let my facade drop.

My arms cut through the water with practiced efficiency, my kick intensifying as years of training took over. I surged forward, leaving him in my wake. When I touched the wall, I turned to find him staring at me with a mixture of surprise and admiration.

"I probably should have mentioned," I said, unable to suppress my grin, "if Lawrence hadn't sent me to business school, I would have been swimming NCAA Division I."

Lucas swam closer, water dripping from his hair. "You played me."

"Brilliantly," I agreed, then squealed as he suddenly lunged forward, caging me against the pool's edge with his arms. His face was inches from mine, eyes dancing with amusement.

"And here I thought I was being gentlemanly with that head start."

"Your mistake," I said softly, hyperaware of how close he was, of the water droplets clinging to his eyelashes.

"Apparently." His voice had dropped lower, sending warmth spreading through my chest despite the cool water. "So what's your request, champion?"

I opened my mouth to respond, but movement at the pool entrance caught my eye. Servant was approaching with a breakfast cart, his expression professionally neutral despite the scene before him.

"Looks like the champion is hungry. Perhaps we should have breakfast first," Lucas suggested. "Then you can tell me what you've won."

I watched him pull himself out of the pool, water cascading down his shoulders. I pulled myself out of the pool and onto a chaise lounge at the edge of the water, eating breakfast as my mind wandered.

I hadn't actually thought about asking Lucas for anything. I was used to relying on myself for years.

"Don't lie to me," I suddenly said.

Lucas looked at me.

"That's all I want. Whatever happens, even if you stop liking me one day, just tell me directly. Never lie to me." I emphasized each word.

*If Ian had told me right away when he fell for Nina, things wouldn't have gotten so messy between us. I wouldn't have been hurt so deeply. And I refused to go through that again.*

"Alright," Lucas responded, his gaze tender, his tone resolute.

"Do we have any plans for today?" I asked.

"No," Lucas answered.
I frowned. So Lucas's idea of vacation was just switching locations to play on his phone and sleep?

"Be patient, Serena. Take another day to just hang out. I mean, I'm a little worried you might not be able to handle all the fun stuff I've got planned for the next couple of days," Lucas said with a cheeky smile.

I looked at him skeptically. By the third day, I understood exactly what he meant.

On the second morning, I was barely awake when Lucas practically carried me onto his yacht. The gentle swaying of the boat and the salty breeze finally roused me from my drowsy state. As my eyes adjusted to the dazzling morning sunlight, I found myself on the deck of a luxury yacht, surrounded by endless ocean.

"What... where are we?" I blinked, still disoriented. The last thing I remembered was Lucas showing up at my door, insisting I come with him for an "urgent matter."

He didn't answer, just guided me to a cushioned lounge chair. Before I could protest, he pressed something cool into my hand. Sunscreen.

"Put this on," he said in that commanding tone that left no room for argument. "You'll burn otherwise."

"I don't need-" I started to object, but he was already squeezing some onto his palm. 

"Turn around," he instructed, his voice low and firm.

My heart skipped a beat. "I can do it myself!"

"Can you reach your back properly?" His gray eyes held a glint of amusement. "Consider this a professional courtesy."

Before I could form a coherent response, his hands were on my shoulders, spreading the cool lotion with precise, deliberate movements. My skin tingled everywhere he touched. I tried to focus on the horizon, on the rhythmic sound of waves, on anything except how intimate this felt.

"Your turn," he said after what felt like an eternity. When I didn't move, he added with a hint of challenge in his voice, "Fair's fair, Serena."

My hands trembled slightly as I applied sunscreen to his broad back. His skin was warm under my fingers, muscles firm and defined. I tried to maintain a clinical detachment, but my racing pulse betrayed me.

"How's the technique?" he asked, and I could hear the smile in his voice.

"Fine," I managed, hoping he couldn't feel how my hands had started to linger.

"Yours too," he murmured, and something in his tone made my cheeks flush even more than the morning sun.

"Have you ever ridden a jet ski before?" Lucas asked as we made our way down to the beach. The morning sun glinted off the waves, making the water look like scattered diamonds.

"No. Actually, this is my first time doing anything like this." In light of yesterday's swim meet, my response was especially honest.

He studied me for a moment, and I braced myself for judgment or mockery. Instead, his expression softened. "Then we'll take it slow. I'll teach you everything you need to know."

The jet ski waited at the shoreline, bobbing gently with the waves. It looked a lot more intimidating up close. Lucas must have noticed my apprehension because he squeezed my shoulder reassuringly.

"Don't worry, I'll be right beside you the whole time."

His patient instruction and steady presence helped calm my nerves as we got started. The initial fear of the powerful machine beneath me gradually gave way to exhilaration as we skimmed across the water. Wind whipped through my hair, and salt spray kissed my face. 

"Having fun?" Lucas called out, keeping pace beside me on his own jet ski.

I couldn't help but laugh, the sound carried away by the wind. For the first time in years, I wasn't thinking about StarRiver Group, or Nina's schemes, or any of the thousand responsibilities weighing on my shoulders. I was just... living.

Back on the beach, Lucas wasn't done with his surprises. "Want to try surfing next? Or we could do some diving-"

"No!" The refusal came automatically, my old defenses kicking in.

"We don't have to if you're not comfortable," he said, his voice gentle. "Want to-"

"No!" I cut him off again, then felt guilty about my sharp tone.

His lips twitched. "-have some water?"

My cheeks burned as he handed me a bottle, clearly amused by my jumpiness. I accepted it with a mumbled thanks, feeling foolish for assuming he was going to suggest another adventure.

"But tomorrow," he continued casually, "I thought we could try something different. How do you feel about helicopters?"

I lowered the water bottle slowly. "Helicopters?"

"And skydiving."

My guilt over my earlier reactions evaporated instantly. "Are you insane?"

He smirked, "Don't worry. I'll be right there with you, remember?"

The strange thing was, despite my outward protests, I was starting to believe him. Starting to trust that when Lucas said he'd be there, he meant it.

I took another sip of water, using the moment to steady myself. 

"Fine," I heard myself say. "But if I die jumping out of your helicopter, I'm coming back to haunt you."

His laugh echoed across the beach, rich and genuine. "I look forward to it, Serena."
###chapter 117
Serena's POV

Exhaustion weighed on every inch of my body. The gentle waves of sleep pulled me under, a well-deserved rest after last night's ocean adventure. 

A knock shattered my peace.

"Go away," I mumbled into my pillow, pulling the covers higher.

The knocking persisted, followed by Lucas's unmistakable voice. "Serena, time to get up."

I cracked open one eye to check my phone. "5:30 AM? Are you insane?"

The door opened - of course he had a key card - and Lucas strode in, already dressed in casual wear instead of his usual suits. The morning light caught his sharp features as he approached my bed.

"Rise and shine, sleeping beauty."

"I don't want to shine. I don't even want to rise. My toes hurt from yesterday's boat trip."

He pulled back my covers with zero sympathy. "Wear something comfortable. We're going on a little trip."

Twenty minutes later, still grumbling, I found myself boarding a helicopter. The early morning air was crisp. As we lifted off, the Bahamas spread out below us like a painting - azure waters dotted with islands, all bathed in the soft glow of dawn.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Lucas's voice came through my headset.

I had to admit it was breathtaking. 

"Tandem skydiving. You'll be attached to me the whole time."

"No. Absolutely not." I crossed my arms, heart already racing. "I'm not jumping out of a perfectly good aircraft."

"You don't have a choice." His grey eyes held that familiar stubborn glint. "Consider it therapy for your fear of heights."

"Lucas Harrington..." My voice trembled. "If I die, I'm haunting you forever."

"Noted." He started helping me into the harness, his movements precise and confident. I tried to ignore how his hands lingered a moment too long each time he adjusted the straps.

Standing at the open door, wind whipping at my face, I questioned every life choice that had led to this moment. The ocean looked impossibly far below.

"I can't do this," I whispered.

Lucas's chest pressed against my back as he secured our harnesses together. "Trust me, Serena."

"I really, really hate you right now."

"Close your eyes if you need to." His breath was warm against my ear. "On three. One..."

"Wait-"

"Two..."

"Lucas-"

"Three."

We fell.

My scream was lost to the wind as we plummeted through empty space. Eyes squeezed shut, I clung to the harness straps like they were the last threads of my sanity.

"Open your eyes," Lucas called over the rush of air.

"No!"

"Open them, or I might have to kiss you to distract you."

My eyes flew open, partly in shock at his words, partly in indignation. And then...

Oh.

The world expanded around me in breathtaking clarity. Sunlight painted the clouds in pink and gold. The ocean below was an endless expanse of blue, islands scattered like emerald jewels on azure silk. We weren't falling - we were flying.

Slowly, my death grip on the straps relaxed. The initial terror melted into something else entirely: freedom. Pure, absolute freedom.

I spread my arms wide, letting out a laugh that came from somewhere deep inside. The wind sang past us as we glided through the morning sky, weightless and wonderful.

"Still hate me?" Lucas asked, and I could hear the smile in his voice.

"Ask me when we land," I replied, but we both knew the answer. In that moment, suspended between heaven and earth, I felt more alive than ever before.

All too soon, the ground began to approach. Lucas deployed the parachute, and our wild descent transformed into a gentle drift. As we floated down, I found myself wishing we could stay up there just a little longer, in that perfect pocket of sky where nothing existed except wind and light and the solid presence of Lucas behind me.


We touched down softly on the beach, and I stood on shaky legs as Lucas unclipped our harnesses. My heart was still racing, but now from exhilaration rather than fear.

"Extreme sports are great for relieving stress," he said, studying my face with those intense grey eyes. "That's how I got through some rough times myself."

"Were you under a lot of pressure?" I asked, studying his profile.

"Being the heir to Harrington International isn't easy." 

I nodded silently, unable to argue with that truth.

"The year my parents died, my grandfather couldn't handle the shock of outliving his child and fell ill. My aunt and uncle weren't capable of running the company, and Jace wasn't allowed to manage it either. Suddenly, all the family pressure fell on my shoulders. I was barely twenty." He paused, his voice carrying a weight I'd never heard before. 

"Dealing with the loss of both parents while trying to keep Harrington International afloat... when the pressure became too much, I'd come out here for extreme sports. It worked, I can tell you that much."

The realization hit me then. Lucas hadn't brought me here because he was some adrenaline junkie looking for a thrill. He'd brought me here to help me forget my troubles, to give me a chance to truly relax.

Something stirred in my chest, a feeling I couldn't quite name. Lucas's thoughtfulness was becoming harder and harder to resist.
###chapter 118
Serena's POV

The ffith day, we went to biggest mall there. I used to think shopping was my forte. After all, I'd spent years cultivating a discerning eye for luxury brands and mastering the art of strategic purchases. But watching Lucas shop was like witnessing a force of nature - swift, decisive, and completely overwhelming.

I held the Vacheron Constantin Traditionnelle diamond-set women's watch, its weight a testament to its precious metals and stones, admiring the hand-polished surfaces, the intricate hand-engraved details, and the seamless integration of diamonds into the dial. Before I could even check the price tag, Lucas's voice cut through my contemplation.

"We'll take it," he said to the eager sales associate, not even glancing up from his phone.

"Wait, I haven't even tried it on-"

"Do you like it?"

"That's not the point! I haven't-"

"I like it," he stated simply, his grey eyes finally meeting mine with that infuriating mix of authority and affection. "That's enough."

I watched in disbelief as the sales associate whisked away the cardigan, adding it to the growing collection of bags and boxes. This had been happening all afternoon - every item I showed even a flicker of interest in was immediately purchased. A silk scarf I'd merely touched, a pair of heels I'd glanced at twice, a handbag I'd commented on in passing - all bought without hesitation.

"Aren't you worried about going bankrupt?" I asked, half-joking.

Lucas stopped walking and turned to face me. The afternoon sun streaming through the skylight caught his profile, highlighting the sharp angles of his face. "You shouldn't underestimate your boyfriend's capabilities, Serena. This is pocket change. Feel free to choose whatever you like."

His casual dismissal of what must have been tens of thousands of dollars made my head spin. "So what wouldn't be pocket change to Mr. Harrington?"

He stepped closer, his voice dropping to that low, intimate tone that never failed to make my pulse quicken. "Perhaps... when your name appears next to mine on legal documents. Then we'd be talking about half my assets."

My heart stuttered. Was he really talking about...? The casual way he dropped marriage into conversation made me simultaneously thrilled and terrified. This man moved at his own pace, completely unconcerned with normal relationship progression.

"I'm tired," I announced abruptly, desperate to escape the intensity of the moment and the implications of his words. "Can we get something cold to drink? I saw a café back there."

A knowing smile tugged at his lips, but he didn't press the issue. "Of course." He gestured for the sales associates to handle our purchases and placed his hand lightly on my lower back, guiding me toward the café.

The café offered a welcome respite from the afternoon heat. After the whirlwind shopping spree, its cool interior and simple décor felt almost soothing. Almost - until Lucas decided to approach ordering ice cream with the same excessive enthusiasm he'd shown for shopping.

"We'll take one of each flavor," he told the server, who brightened at the prospect of such a large order.

"No," I cut in quickly. "Just one chocolate, please." When Lucas raised an eyebrow, I added, "Too much ice cream isn't good for you."

The server looked between us, uncertain, until Lucas nodded his acquiescence. As she went to prepare my order, I noticed something. "Aren't you getting anything?"

His lips curved into that infuriating smirk. "As you said, too much ice cream isn't good for you."

The chocolate ice cream was perfect - rich and creamy, melting smoothly on my tongue. I was savoring my third spoonful when Lucas suddenly leaned across the table and took a bite from my cone, his lips touching exactly where mine had been moments before.

"What are you doing?" I nearly dropped the cone in surprise.

"Helping myself," he replied with perfect composure. "No need to order another one. As you mentioned, too much ice cream isn't good for you."

I narrowed my eyes at him but continued eating, determined to ignore his provocative behavior. Two bites later, he did it again.

"Lucas!" His full name came out sharper than I intended.

"Yes?" The picture of innocence, except for that glint in his eyes.

"Stop eating my ice cream!"

"I'm helping you eat less. It's for your health." His tone was serious, but his eyes danced with amusement.

Before I could formulate a suitably scathing response, a cheerful voice interrupted us. "Excuse me!" A man with a professional camera hung around his neck approached our table. "I hope you don't mind, but I couldn't resist capturing that moment. The lighting was perfect, and your interaction was just so..."

I tensed, expecting Lucas to shut down this invasion of privacy with his usual cold efficiency. Instead, he surprised me by asking to see the photos.

The photographer showed us his camera display, and I felt my chest tighten. There I was, looking at Lucas with an expression I'd never seen on my own face before - soft, unguarded, absolutely besotted. Even while supposedly angry at him, I'd been looking at him like... like...

I quickly handed the camera back to Lucas, pretending to be completely unfazed. "Where to next?" I asked, desperate to change the subject.

"That's up to you."

"Bungee jumping." The words came out before I could stop them.

Lucas's eyebrows rose slightly, but he simply stood and offered me his hand. As we left the café, I couldn't help thinking: *Can't we just have one peaceful day without my heart doing backflips?*
###chapter 119
Serena's POV

The last day in Bahamas. Instinctively, I reached for my phone to check the time - 8:30 AM. Usually, Lucas would have already knocked on my door, his deep voice carrying a hint of amusement as he urged me to "rise and shine." But today, there was only silence.

I lay there for a moment, letting the gentle sound of waves wash over me. It was strange how quickly I'd grown accustomed to this paradise. When Lucas first brought me here, I'd been resistant, viewing it as just another power play. Now, the thought of leaving made my chest tighten unexpectedly.

After waiting another fifteen minutes, I finally called him.

"Lucas?" I kept my voice neutral, fighting back a note of concern.

"Good morning, Serena." His voice was warm but distracted. "I apologize, but some urgent business matters came up that require my immediate attention. I'll try to be back before dinner."

"Of course," I replied, maintaining my composure. "Work comes first."

After hanging up, I wandered onto the balcony, letting the tropical breeze play with my hair. The ocean stretched endlessly before me, its surface glittering like scattered diamonds under the morning sun.

I spent the morning by the pool, alternating between swimming laps and lounging with a book. The water was perfect - cool enough to be refreshing but warm enough to stay in for hours. As I floated on my back, watching wispy clouds drift across the azure sky, I found myself thinking about Lucas. He'd been different here too - more relaxed, letting his usual stern facade slip to reveal glimpses of dry humor and genuine warmth.

The day drifted by in a lazy haze. I ordered a light lunch and ate it on the terrace, accompanied only by the rustling of palm fronds and distant calls of seabirds. The hours ticked past with no word from Lucas. Several times, I caught myself reaching for my phone, fingers hovering over his number before pulling back. He had responsibilities; I understood that better than most.

As sunset approached, painting the sky in brilliant strokes of orange and pink, I resigned myself to dining alone. The resort staff had already set a solitary place at the outdoor table when my phone finally buzzed.

"Serena." Lucas's voice held an unusual note that I couldn't quite place. "Come to the windows in the living room."

"What? Why-"

"Trust me."

Curious despite myself, I made my way to the designated spot. The night had fully settled in, transforming the window into a dark mirror that reflected the room's warm lighting. For a moment, nothing happened. Then the sky exploded.

Fireworks burst across the darkness, their brilliant colors reflecting off the calm ocean surface. Each explosion painted the night in shades of gold, red, and blue, creating patterns that seemed to dance just for us. I stood transfixed, barely breathing, as the show continued.

My phone buzzed again. "Come outside," Lucas said simply.

I stepped out onto the terrace, still mesmerized by the display above. And there he was, standing in the garden below, illuminated by the cascading lights overhead. 

For once, I didn't try to analyze his intentions or guard my reaction. I simply smiled, letting the warmth of the moment wash over me like the gentle breeze.

As the last firework faded into the night sky, I found myself stunned by Lucas's romantic gesture. The man who typically exuded cold authority had orchestrated this breathtaking display just for me. The gentle lapping of waves against the shore filled the momentary silence, and the salty breeze carried the lingering scent of gunpowder.

Just when I thought the evening couldn't get more surreal, the sweet notes of a violin drifted through the air. I turned to find the source and saw a violinist emerging from behind a row of palm trees, his instrument singing a slow, romantic melody into the night.

Lucas stepped closer, his tall frame illuminated by the scattered garden lights. "May I have this dance, Ms. Sinclair?" he asked, extending his hand with an elegant flourish.

My heart skipped a beat. In the soft lighting, his usually sharp features looked softer, more approachable. I placed my hand in his, trying to ignore the slight tremor in my fingers. His palm was warm and steady against mine.

He drew me close, one hand settling at my waist while the other held mine aloft. The violin's melody wrapped around us as we began to move, our feet leaving gentle impressions in the cool sand. I could feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat where our bodies touched, slightly faster than usual.

"Satisfied with our trip?" he asked, his voice low and intimate.

"Mm-hmm," I managed, too aware of our proximity to form a more coherent response.

"I'm not quite satisfied," he murmured.

"Haven't had enough fun yet?" I tried to inject some annoyance into my tone, remembering all the activities he'd dragged me into over the past days.

His gray eyes locked with mine. "With you."

That single word, spoken in his deep voice, sent a shiver down my spine. The casual comment felt weighted with meaning, and I found myself holding my breath.

The violin's melody swelled around us as we continued to dance. Lucas's thumb traced small circles on my waist, each movement sending sparks of awareness through my body. I could smell his cologne, a subtle woody scent that seemed to wrap around me like an embrace.

"May I, Serena?" he asked softly, his gaze dropping to my lips.

The question hung between us, loaded with possibility. Part of me wanted to pull away, to retreat behind the walls. But another part, one that had been growing stronger during our time here, wanted to lean in.

Before I could overthink it, I rose onto my tiptoes. My lips met his in a tentative kiss that quickly deepened as he responded. His hand tightened at my waist, pulling me closer as my fingers curled into the fabric of his shirt.
The kiss was nothing like I'd imagined - and I had imagined it, though I'd never admit it aloud. It wasn't the calculated seduction I'd half-expected from him, nor was it the aggressive claiming I'd feared. Instead, it was patient, thorough, and devastatingly tender, a slow, intimate exploration that intensified as our tongues first touched, then lingered, sending shivers down my spine.
###chapter 120
Serena's POV

In the beautiful, tranquil night, our lips met in a passionate kiss.

Lucas seemed frozen for a moment, allowing me to kiss him with nervous inexperience. I noticed his throat move as he swallowed hard. Then his fingers slowly lifted to pull my body tightly against his chest. He lowered his head, deepening our kiss.

In that moment, the world around us seemed to fade away. There was only us, deeply intertwined with each other.

My legs went weak - literally weak from Lucas's kiss. Without hesitation, he lifted me up effortlessly. I gasped in surprise. The next moment, he had placed me on the dining table nearby, his lips finding mine again, refusing to give me even a moment to catch my breath as he kissed me endlessly.

The night seemed to grow deeper. Lucas had swept aside all the tableware. I could see the desire darkening in Lucas's eyes, so intense it felt like it could burn right through me.

I felt nervous, my breathing heavy, making my chest rise and fall noticeably. I had no idea how much I was tempting him, how hard he was fighting himself not to give in, with desire so thick in the air you could cut it with a knife.

Lucas's body gradually leaned down, moving closer to me. I pressed my lips together tightly. I could feel how much he wanted me, how much he desired...

I clenched my fists. A flash of memory from my nightmare at eighteen suddenly crossed my mind. Fear flickered through my eyes, but when Lucas truly came close, I chose to close my eyes. My fists tightened, but I made no move to push him away. I was trying to accept it, trying so hard to accept...

After what felt like forever, the expected didn't happen. The weight pressing against me suddenly disappeared.

THUD!

When I opened my eyes again, I saw Lucas had plunged into the ocean beside us, creating a dramatic splash. After entering the water, he began swimming back and forth frantically, forcing himself to calm down.

My heart trembled. I didn't know what would have happened if Lucas and I had done it - perhaps I would have accepted it, forced myself to accept it, constantly telling myself that Lucas was Lucas, different from that man from my past. But in this moment, seeing Lucas restraining his desire for my sake, I let out a huge sigh of relief.

I wasn't actually as brave or fearless as I thought. If Lucas and I had crossed that line tonight, I wasn't sure if I would regret it, but I was certain I would have carried an emotional burden.

And Lucas didn't let me bear that burden. 

I got up from the dining table and walked toward the ocean's edge. Lucas had been in there too long.

Standing on the beach, I called out to him, "Lucas!"

He emerged from the water. He had removed his black suit jacket, and his white shirt was completely soaked, clinging to his body, clearly outlining his muscular frame.

"Can you come out now?" I asked.

"Almost," he replied.

"Come on up," I reached out my hand to help him.

"You probably shouldn't touch me right now, Serena." Lucas warned.

My fingers twitched slightly. I certainly understood his implication.

"I'll come up myself," Lucas said as he emerged from the water.

The ocean was quite cool at night. As he came out, I could clearly feel the coldness of his body.

A sea breeze blew past at that moment, making Lucas sneeze. He looked somewhat disheveled.

I couldn't help but laugh.

"And whose fault is this?" Lucas grumbled.

"Let's go back," I said, my mood genuinely light and happy.

We walked back to the beach house one after the other. Lucas headed straight to his room, planning to warm up with a hot shower.

"Lucas," I called after him.

He turned around.

"Thank you," I smiled, truly moved by everything he had done tonight.

Lying in my suite at the beach house, I found myself unable to sleep. The memory of Lucas's kisses still lingered on my lips, and the way he had pulled back - jumping into the cold ocean rather than taking things further - kept replaying in my mind. Such restraint from a man of his position and power was... unexpected.

A smile tugged at my lips, though I felt a twinge of guilt knowing he was probably freezing after that impromptu swim.

Sleep continued to elude me. I was surprised by my own reactions tonight - how I hadn't pushed him away, how I had been willing to let things progress despite my past trauma. With Lucas, everything felt different. Safer. The way he had read my momentary fear and immediately pulled back, putting my comfort above his desires... it spoke volumes about the man he truly was.

When morning came, we both showed signs of our sleepless night - the slight shadows under our eyes, the way we moved just a bit more slowly than usual. 

"I should probably apologize for earlier," Lucas said over coffee, his voice carrying that distinctive low timber.

"For what exactly?" I kept my tone light, though my heart raced at the memory.

His lips curved into a self-deprecating smile. "For nearly losing control... though I'm more surprised you're not angry with me."

"Maybe I'm not angry because I trust you," I replied softly, surprising myself with the honest admission.

His eyes darkened at my words, and he set down his coffee cup with deliberate care. "Did you... have trouble sleeping last night too?"

"I just slept too much yesterday," I deflected, suddenly finding my breakfast extremely interesting.

"Is that really why?" His knowing smile made my cheeks warm. "You're quick to deny it."

He looked devastating in his casual morning attire - a light blue button-down with rolled-up sleeves that did nothing to hide his athletic build. The memory of how that shirt had clung to him after his ocean swim made my mouth go dry.

"We should head to the airport after breakfast," he said eventually.

"Already?" I couldn't keep the disappointment from my voice.

"Unless you'd prefer to stay longer..." He left the suggestion hanging, his grey eyes intense as they held mine.

The invitation was tempting - so tempting. But we both had responsibilities waiting for us back in Manhattan. The StarRiver Group wouldn't run itself, and I knew Milo and Stella would be eager for their father's return.

Still, as we prepared to leave, I couldn't help but feel that something fundamental had shifted between us.

We were no longer just two people thrown together by circumstance and mutual attraction. Last night had proved that what was growing between us went deeper than that. And for the first time since my disastrous relationship with Ian, I found myself looking forward to wherever this path might lead.
###chapter 121
Serena's POV

The familiar Manhattan skyline gradually came into view through the private jet's window as I stirred from my nap. Lucas had insisted I rest during the flight, quietly handling his own work while letting me sleep. The thought brought an involuntary smile to my face.

The plane touched down at 3 PM sharp. As we descended the stairs, I spotted Miles waiting beside a sleek black Mercedes. His efficiency never ceased to amaze me.

"Welcome back to Manhattan, Mr. Harrington, Miss Sinclair," Miles greeted us with his characteristic professionalism.

Once we were settled in the car, Miles began his briefing. "The three business dinners have been rescheduled over the next three days. Tonight's priority is the Harrington International anniversary celebration. Your evening gown has been prepared as requested."

I raised an eyebrow. "My evening gown?"

"As the future Mrs. Harrington, you should definitely attend tonight's celebration," Lucas interjected smoothly, his gray eyes holding a hint of amusement. "Consider it an inspection of your future domain."

I felt heat rise to my cheeks at his words, still not quite used to such open declarations of his intentions. To hide my reaction, I turned to Miles. "Miles, what's your salary? StarRiver could use someone with your capabilities."

A low chuckle came from Lucas. "You won't be able to poach him."

"Oh? And why is that?"

"There's only one way to get Miles on your team," Lucas replied, his voice dropping to that dangerous octave that never failed to make my heart skip. "Marry me. Then what's mine becomes yours."

The rest of the drive passed in a blur of business updates. Miles detailed StarRiver's latest collaboration with the television network, his precise knowledge of my company's operations impressive as always. 

We pulled up to the luxury boutique where my gown awaited. Lucas, already in his perfectly tailored suit, needed to handle some work before the celebration.

"I'll see you tonight," he said, his hand briefly squeezing mine before he left with Miles.

Standing in the boutique's private fitting room, I gazed at my reflection in the full-length mirror. The crimson gown Lucas had chosen was exquisite - modern yet timeless, exactly like the man himself. 

After three hours of styling hair and applying makeup, Ethan navigated the Rolls-Royce through evening traffic with practiced ease. As we approached the Harrington International headquarters, the building's façade gleamed against the darkening sky, its windows illuminated for tonight's 50th-anniversary celebration.

The scale of the event struck me the moment I stepped into the grand ballroom. Three levels of opulent space stretched before me, far grander than the charity gala previously. Chandeliers cascaded from the ceiling, their light catching on the champagne towers and creating endless sparkles across the room. It seemed every significant figure in Manhattan's business world had turned out for the occasion.

I moved through the crowd, nodding at familiar faces while scanning for one in particular. It had been too long since I'd seen Milo and Stella, and I missed them terribly. The thought of their bright smile and innocent questions made my heart ache a little.

"Serena Sinclair?"

The male voice caught me off guard. I turned to find a well-dressed man watching me with an expectant expression. Something about him seemed vaguely familiar, but I couldn't quite place him.

"Yes?" I offered a polite smile.

His expression darkened. "I'm James Chapman."

The name should have meant something, but my mind remained blank. I maintained my diplomatic smile while trying to place him - perhaps a business contact I'd forgotten?

"You really don't remember me, do you?" His tone carried an edge of anger that seemed disproportionate to the situation. "I get that playing hard to get is a common tactic, but this is just nauseating!"

I took a step back, my smile fading. "I apologize, but I really don't-"

"Your father personally introduced us at the Sinclair mansion," he cut in, reaching for my arm. "Or have you forgotten that too?"

The memory suddenly clicked into place. He was one of the many suitors my father had paraded before me. I'd dismissed the introduction so quickly I'd barely registered James's existence.

"Let go of me," I said quietly but firmly, "unless you want to make a scene."
###chapter 122
Serena's POV

I took a step back, withdrawing my arm from his grasp. "Let go of me," I repeated, my voice carrying an edge of steel beneath its quiet surface.

James Chapman's face darkened with anger. "Still playing the untouchable princess, aren't you?" He matched my retreat with an aggressive step forward.

I maintained my composure, though my lip curled slightly. "Ah yes, now I recall. One of those... unmemorable introductions."

"Unmemorable?" His voice rose, drawing curious glances from nearby guests. "Do you have any idea who you're talking to? Everyone at this Harrington International anniversary gala is here because they matter in Manhattan."

I let my gaze sweep the opulent ballroom, noting with sudden clarity the conspicuous absence of both the Sinclair and Whitmore families. A warmth bloomed in my chest as I realized the likely architect of those particular omissions. Lucas's subtle protectiveness never ceased to surprise me.

"And you think that makes you important?" I asked with elegant disdain. "That you managed to secure an invitation?"

James's face flushed an ugly red. "Listen carefully, Serena. I'm a senior executive at Harrington International. My position here is crucial. Your little StarRiver Group? If you want any chance of establishing yourself in Manhattan, you'd better learn to show proper respect."

A cold smile touched my lips. "Respect? Is that what this display is about? You must be terribly insecure in your position if you need to announce it so... desperately."

"You-" He stepped forward again, but I held my ground.

"Tell me, Mr. Chapman," I continued, my voice dripping with mock curiosity, "do you always need to remind people of your importance? Or is it just around those who've forgotten meeting you?"

The muscle in his jaw twitched. Several nearby conversations had died down as people pretended not to watch our exchange. 

James's expression shifted into what he probably thought was a benevolent smile. "You know, Serena, given our distant family connection, I'm willing to be generous here." He spread his hands in a magnanimous gesture that made me want to laugh, especially since I'd spotted Miles hovering quietly in the background. "With the right attitude and proper respect, I could ensure your path in Manhattan remains... smooth."

I maintained my composed smile, watching his increasingly smug face. "How thoughtful of you, Mr. Chapman. And what exactly makes you think I need your... assistance?"

"Let's be realistic," he leaned in, lowering his voice to what he must have imagined was an intimate tone. "Your current success is temporary. Once the spotlight fades, people will remember your past. But I'm willing to overlook all that - you should consider yourself fortunate."

My smile didn't waver. "And what past would that be, Mr. Chapman? Please, enlighten me."

His confidence grew with what he mistook for vulnerability in my question. "Your position at StarRiver, your presence here tonight - it's all quite precarious, isn't it? One word from someone in my position at Harrington International..."

"James." Miles's cool voice cut through the air like a blade. I watched with carefully concealed amusement as James's spine stiffened in recognition.

"Mr. Reed!" James spun around, his entire demeanor transforming instantly from threatening to fawning. "I was just having a friendly chat with Ms. Sinclair about-"

"About your position at Harrington International?" Miles's expression remained perfectly neutral. "That's actually quite timely. I've been meaning to inform you - your services will no longer be required, effective immediately."

The color drained from James's face. "But... but I don't understand. My record-"

"Has been under review for some time," Miles finished smoothly. "Ms. Sinclair isn't someone you can afford to threaten, James. Though I suppose that's no longer a concern for you."

"This is- there must be some mistake," James stammered, looking frantically between Miles and me. "I can explain-"

"Your severance package will be processed by HR," Miles continued as if James hadn't spoken. "I suggest you make your exit from the gala discreet. We wouldn't want to cause a scene, would we?"

As James slunk away, his earlier bravado completely deflated, Miles turned to me with a slight nod. 

I returned his nod with a grateful smile. "Thank you, Miles. For everything."

"Simply maintaining the company's standards, Ms. Sinclair," he replied professionally, though I caught the hint of amusement in his eyes.

A movement on the second floor caught my eye. Through the ornate balustrade, I glimpsed Lucas watching the scene below, a slight smile playing at his lips. Before I could process what that meant, a woman beside him turned to look at me. Though her gaze wasn't hostile, something about it made my instincts prickle. She said something to Lucas before they both disappeared from view.

The grand chandelier's light shifted, drawing attention to the panoramic elevator as it descended. Howard Harrington made his entrance, his wheelchair pushed by Lucas. My heart clenched, remembering Lucas's words on that beach in the Bahamas about his father's stroke and the loss that had paralyzed him. The weight of family tragedy was visible in the careful way Lucas guided the chair, in the protective stance he maintained.

I watched as Lucas's aunt Clara Harrington and her husband Grant Yates took their places near Howard. Jace Gillard stood nearby, completing the family tableau. The absence of Milo and Stella was notable - though unsurprising for such a late event.

"There you are!" Eleanor's voice carried from the second floor. I looked up to find her leaning against the railing, champagne glass raised in greeting. Our eyes met in silent understanding - the kind only true friendship could forge.

"Don't miss my brother's moment, darling," she called down, her eyes sparkling with significance. "You'll want to watch this."

The lights began to dim, drawing everyone's attention to the stage.
###chapter 123
Serena's POV

The spotlight illuminated Lucas, his presence commanding immediate attention. Impeccably dressed in a designer suit, with his hair slicked back and a serious expression on his face, he took to the stage. I couldn't help but be captivated. His presentation was flawless, each word carrying the weight of authority and confidence.

"In the past fiscal year, Harrington International has achieved unprecedented growth across all key sectors," Lucas began, his voice resonating through the ballroom. "Our core markets have seen a 27% increase, with international expansion exceeding initial projections by 15%."

I found myself drawn to the subtle changes in his expression as he spoke - the slight lift of his eyebrow when emphasizing key points, the measured gestures that accompanied each statement. There was something undeniably attractive about a man so completely in his element.

The presentation transitioned seamlessly into Howard Harrington's announcement. From his wheelchair, he projected an air of dignity that commanded respect. "Today marks a pivotal moment for Harrington International," he declared, his voice carrying surprising strength. "I am officially stepping down, passing the reins to my grandson, Lucas Harrington."

Applause erupted through the ballroom. I watched Lucas accept this moment with characteristic grace. That's when Howard's voice cut through the celebration with words that stopped my world.

"And I have one more announcement," he continued, his eyes twinkling. "I'm pleased to share that my grandson Lucas is engaged to Ms. Rachel Thorne of Thorne Industries."

For a moment, I couldn't breathe. Howard Harrington's words hung in the air like a physical weight pressing down on my chest. Lucas... engaged? To Rachel Thorne? The champagne glass trembled slightly in my hand as I struggled to maintain my composure.

My fingertips turned numb against the crystal stem, but I forced myself to keep smiling, even as I felt the color drain from my face. Around me, the elegant crowd burst into enthusiastic applause, their excitement feeling like needles against my skin. Every "congratulations" echoing through the room was another twist of the knife.

My mind raced back through every moment we'd shared. Every lingering look. Every almost-touch. Every time I'd thought I'd seen something more in his eyes. Had I imagined it all?

Rachel emerged from the crowd in a shimmering silver-rose gown that caught every light in the room. The dress wasn't just expensive - it was a statement of belonging, of fitting perfectly into this world. As she took her place beside Lucas, I noticed the matching rose accent on his black suit collar. What I'd dismissed as a festive touch now revealed itself as a carefully planned detail.

They looked perfect together. The power couple everyone expected. Lucas Harrington and Rachel Thorne - a match made in corporate heaven.

My mind flickered back to his words on the beach. The memory felt like a cruel joke now. I'd been naive enough to believe him, to think that all his attention meant something more.

But I should have known better. Hadn't life taught me enough lessons about trust? About hoping? The familiar numbness crept in, a protective shield I'd developed over years of disappointment. Of course this would happen. Of course.

I didn't make a scene. Didn't shed a tear. With practiced ease, I turned and walked toward the exit, my heels silent against the plush carpet. Behind me, the sound of celebration continued, undisturbed by my departure.

Sometimes the worst pain isn't the sharp kind that makes you cry out. It's the dull ache of realizing you've been fooled again, and the only person you can blame is yourself.





Lucas's POV

Rachel glided toward me in her silver-rose gown, every step perfectly calculated for maximum effect. The matching rose accent on my collar suddenly felt like it was burning against my skin. Of course they'd planned this - every detail orchestrated for the perfect engagement announcement.

"Lucas." My grandfather's grip on my wrist tightened, his voice barely a whisper but filled with steel. "Don't you dare ruin this."

Through the sea of faces, I caught sight of Serena turning away. The composed grace of her retreat was somehow worse than if she'd made a scene.

"I never agreed to this," I muttered, the words coming out through clenched teeth.

Rachel reached us, her practiced smile never wavering. "Lucas, everyone's watching," she murmured, extending her hand.

The pressure of expectations pressed in from all sides - the anticipatory hush of the crowd, the cameras poised to capture the moment, my grandfather's vice-like grip. But all I could focus on was Serena's retreating figure.

I wrenched my arm free from Howard's grasp. The sudden movement sent a ripple of whispers through the crowd.

"Lucas!" Howard's voice carried a warning that would have cowed me years ago. Not anymore.

I pushed past Rachel, ignoring her startled gasp. But before I could take three steps, a wall of dark-suited security materialized in front of me.

"Get out of my way." My voice was low, dangerous.

"We have our orders, sir." The lead guard's tone was apologetic but firm.

I could see Serena through the gaps between them, getting further away with each second. My hands clenched into fists, knuckles white with tension. The urge to fight through them warred with the knowledge that causing a scene would only make things worse.

By the time the guards "escorted" me to a private room, Serena was long gone. The door closed behind me with a final-sounding click.
###chapter 124
Serena's POV

I walked out of the grand ballroom with deliberate grace, each step measured and unhurried.

The night air hit my face as I stepped outside, bringing with it the familiar symphony of Manhattan - distant sirens, the hum of traffic, the pulse of a city that never truly sleeps. My crimson gown caught the light from the towering buildings around us, and for a moment, I allowed myself to appreciate the irony.

"Your car, Ms. Sinclair," Ethan held the door open.

I slid into the back seat of the black Rolls-Royce, letting out a carefully controlled breath only after the door closed behind me. The leather seats were cool against my bare shoulders, and I watched the city lights blur past the tinted windows, consciously avoiding any glimpse of the building I'd just left. *Don't hope, and you won't be disappointed.* 

It took precisely six blocks before I realized we weren't heading toward home.

"Ethan," I kept my voice level, "this isn't the way to my apartment."

There was a slight pause before he responded, his eyes meeting mine briefly in the rearview mirror. "Mr. Harrington requested your presence at the family estate, Ms. Sinclair."

My hand instinctively moved toward my phone, but Ethan's next words stopped me cold.

"I wouldn't advise making any calls, Ms. Sinclair. Mr. Harrington assured me no harm will come to you, but unnecessary resistance might... complicate matters."

I felt my jaw tighten but forced it to relax. In Manhattan's upper echelons, the Harrington name carried weight. If Howard Harrington wanted someone to disappear, they disappeared.

The car turned onto Fifth Avenue, leaving the busier streets behind as we headed toward the more exclusive neighborhoods. I used the time to think, to plan. My mind cataloged every detail - the route, the driver's demeanor, the timing.

The Harrington estate emerged from behind wrought iron gates like something from another era - a mansion that wouldn't have looked out of place in Newport's Gilded Age. Old money, old power. The kind that didn't need to announce itself.

A butler met me at the door. His silver hair and impeccable posture were as much a part of the house as its marble columns.

"This way, Ms. Sinclair," he gestured toward the grand staircase. "Mr. Harrington will join you shortly."

The study he led me to was exactly what I expected - leather-bound books, antique furniture. A silver tray of refreshments sat on a side table, an oddly hospitable touch for what was essentially a kidnapping.

I settled into one of the leather chairs, smoothing my gown with steady hands. The clock on the mantel read 9:15 PM. 

I helped myself to a delicate chocolate truffle from the tray. Whatever was coming, I refused to face it on an empty stomach. At precisely 10 PM, the study door opened.

I rose from the chair as Howard was wheeled in by his butler. 

The door closed behind them. Now it was just the three of us in the study.

Howard positioned himself behind the desk, while butler stood respectfully behind him. Both of them studied me intently.

Some people possessed an innate ability to intimidate - it was impossible to ignore their presence.

"Please sit, Miss Sinclair," he finally spoke after scrutinizing me.

"Thank you, Mr. Harrington," I responded, maintaining my composure - neither submissive nor arrogant.

"Miss Sinclair, I'll be direct." Howard's voice carried the weight of generations of authority. "I want you to leave Lucas."

I'd been expecting this conversation, but the bluntness still caught me slightly off guard. I took a measured breath, keeping my voice steady. "With all due respect, Mr. Harrington, I don't believe this is something for others to decide."

He lifted his teacup, and I noticed the slight pause in his movement - barely perceptible, but there. His eyes, sharp as ever, studied me over the rim. "You're not what I expected, Miss Sinclair."

"And what did you expect?" I met his gaze evenly.

"Someone easier to intimidate, perhaps." The ghost of a smile touched his lips. "I've done my research on you, Serena. Your handling of the StarRiver crisis was... impressive. The way you outmaneuvered Nina Sinclair- that showed real talent."

The compliment felt like the prelude to a strike. I remained silent, waiting.

"Which is precisely why this situation is so... unfortunate." He set down his cup with deliberate care. "You're a remarkable young woman. Smart, capable, ambitious. You could have your pick of suitable matches. Jace Gillard, for instance, has expressed interest."

A humorless laugh escaped me before I could stop it. "Love isn't something you can orchestrate like a business deal, Mr. Harrington."

"Isn't it?" His eyes hardened. "Given your background and capabilities, you could choose anyone in the Harrington family - except Lucas."

The words stung more than I wanted to admit. They echoed too closely to wounds that hadn't fully healed, reminders of past rejections and family betrayals. 

"I understand your position," I said carefully. "And I respect that you want what's best for Lucas and his children. But if this relationship needs to end, it should be our decision. We deserve at least that much dignity."

Howard's fingers drummed once on his desk. "You misunderstand, Miss Sinclair. I'm not suggesting a mutual parting. I want you to leave him. Make him believe it's your choice."

The cruelty of the request hit me like a physical blow. "No." The word came out soft but firm. "I won't pretend to be something I'm not to make this easier for you. If you want to destroy what Lucas and I have, you'll have to do it openly."
###chapter 125
Serena's POV

I rose from the armchair, my movements deliberate and controlled. "We're done here. I won't waste any more of your time, Mr. Harrington."

"Don't be hasty, Miss Sinclair." His voice carried that particular tone of the powerful - one accustomed to buying their way out of any situation. "Let's discuss terms."

I paused, not quite at the door. The grandfather clock ticked steadily in the corner, marking each moment of this particular power play.

"I can make this worth your while." He opened a drawer, removing a checkbook with calculated casualness. "Name your price."

The corner of my mouth twitched. "Mr. Harrington, if I wanted money-"

"The Sinclair Group," he interrupted. "I can help you reclaim what's rightfully yours."

That made me turn back, if only slightly. Howard's eyes glinted with satisfaction at having caught my attention. The bait was expertly chosen - he'd done his homework well.

"And the Whitmores," he continued, pressing his advantage. "I could destroy them. Make Ian pay for everything he did to you."

The temptation was there, I had to admit. For a moment, I let myself imagine it - taking back Lawrence's company, watching Ian's smug facade crumble. But the price was too familiar. Another powerful man thinking he could dictate the terms of my life.

"I can earn my own money, Mr. Harrington." My voice was quiet but firm. "And as for the Sinclair Group or the Whitmore family - they're hardly worth my concern. Just a matter of time."

He steepled his fingers, studying me. "All three then. Money, power, revenge. Everything you want, served on a silver platter."

"You're missing the point." I met his gaze steadily. "The fact that you're so desperate to make me leave Lucas... it reveals more than you intended."

His fingers tightened imperceptibly. Even the butler, still as a statue behind him, seemed to tense.

"You're afraid," I continued, the realization crystallizing as I spoke. "Afraid that if you don't force me away, Lucas won't let me go. And if I have that kind of influence over him..." I let the implication hang in the air.

The mask slipped. Howard's face darkened with genuine anger. "You're holding the wrong cards, Miss Sinclair. I can make you lose everything."

"Can you?" I allowed myself a small smile. "You've just shown me exactly how much leverage I have. The great Howard Harrington, reduced to bribing a young woman to leave his grandson."

"So you've decided to stand against me?" His voice carried the weight of decades of unchallenged authority.

I met his gaze steadily. "At my young age, as a nobody, how could I dare to stand against Mr. Harrington? I'm merely asking for fairness - "

"I'll give you fairness!" He cut me off, his voice sharp in the elegant study of the Harrington mansion.

I kept my expression cold, though I could feel my heart racing.

"I'll make you willingly walk away from Lucas," he continued.



Eleanor's POV

I burst through the crowd in the grand ballroom, my heart pounding against my ribs. The engagement announcement still rang in my ears.

"A perfect match," someone whispered nearby. I wanted to scream. Perfect? No, this was wrong. Everything about Rachel Thorne was too polished, too precise. Like a diamond that sparkled just a bit too brightly to be real.

My eyes caught Serena's silhouette as she slipped away from the crowd. The slight tremor in her shoulders was visible only to those who knew where to look. I knew that kind of pain - the kind that steals your voice and leaves you struggling to breathe. The same pain I'd felt years ago when Jace...

"Miss Yates." A security guard's broad shoulders blocked my path. "No one is to leave during the announcement."

"I need to see Ms. Sinclair," I insisted, trying to keep my voice steady despite the growing panic in my chest. "She's my friend."

"I'm sorry, but those are my orders."

I pulled out my phone, dialing Serena's number for what felt like the hundredth time. Straight to voicemail. "Serena, please pick up. I understand... I know how it feels when..." I stopped, watching my brother's face across the room. His jaw was clenched, eyes burning with barely contained fury. It seemed that he hadn't known about this announcement either.

The next hour crawled by like broken glass across skin. I kept checking my phone, pacing in my heels. My fingers couldn't stop fidgeting with my bracelet.

Finally, the crowd began to thin. I made my way toward the exit, my steps quickening with each passing moment.
"Eleanor."

That voice. I froze, my hand tightening around my clutch. "What do you want, Jace?" I didn't turn around.

"Howard probably took her to the Harrington mansion." His voice was careful, measured.

I spun to face him, alarm cutting through my usual defenses. "What? Why would he-" The rest of my question died as Jace reached for my arm. I jerked back instinctively, the movement creating a pocket of awkward space between us.

His hand dropped slowly. "You know how Howard operates. If he sees an opportunity..."

"That manipulative old-" I bit back the rest of my words, already moving toward the parking area. My grandfather never did anything without multiple motives, and Serena was far too vulnerable right now to face him alone.

"Eleanor," Jace called after me. "Be careful. This isn't just about Serena and Lucas anymore."

"Eleanor!"

Jace's voice cut through the silence, his footsteps rapid behind me. Something in his tone made me stop, my hand tightening instinctively around my purse strap.

"What is it?" I turned, catching the urgency in his expression.

He closed the distance between us quickly, slightly out of breath. "If I'm right, Howard took Serena to the Harrington estate."

My blood ran cold. "How do you know?" 

The parking plot suddenly felt colder, the shadows deeper. Grandfather had always been ruthless in getting what he wanted, and Serena... my mind raced with possibilities, none of them good.

"I need to go there." I started to move, but Jace reached for my arm. I jerked away before he could make contact, my body responding before my mind could process the movement.

"Wait," he said, letting his hand fall back to his side. "When you see her, tell her not to trust anything Howard says. Don't let her make any decisions before Lucas explains everything."

I narrowed my eyes, studying his face. "What do you mean? Is Lucas hiding something from her?"

Jace hesitated, and in that moment of silence, I caught it-that slight shift in his expression that confirmed my suspicions. "It's complicated," he finally said.

"Complicated?" I repeated, my voice sharp. "My brother better have a damn good explanation for this."

"He does." Jace ran a hand through his hair, a gesture I'd noticed he made when stressed. "Stay with her these few days. She needs someone right now. I'll reschedule your shooting scenes."

The concrete pillars cast alternating bands of light and shadow across his face as he spoke. I could see the tension in his jaw, the way he was choosing his words carefully. There was more he wasn't telling me, but I knew pushing wouldn't get me answers.

"Fine," I said, already turning toward my car. "But this better not be another one of Grandfather's games."

"Eleanor," Jace called after me one last time. I paused but didn't turn around. "Be careful. This situation... it's more delicate than you might think."

I didn't respond, just kept walking.

Half hours later, I took the stairs two at a time, my heart pounding against my ribs. When I finally reached Grandfather's study, I didn't bother knocking-I threw the heavy door open, the sound reverberating through the room.

"Grandfather!"
###chapter 126
Eleanor's POV

The scene before me froze like a carefully arranged tableau: Serena, looking small in one of the chairs, and my grandfather, standing by his massive desk like the king of his domain.

"Eleanor," Grandfather's voice carried that familiar note of disapproval. "What happened to your manners?"

I ignored his rebuke, moving immediately to stand beside Serena. My hand found her shoulder, a gesture both protective and reassuring. "At your age, bullying a young woman like Serena? What would people say?"

Grandfather's expression didn't change, but I caught the slight tightening around his eyes.

"We're just discussing business," he said smoothly, adjusting his cufflinks with practiced nonchalance.

"Yes," Serena agreed, her voice steady despite the tension I could feel in her shoulder. "It's just business."

I didn't believe either of them for a second. The air in the study was too thick with unspoken threats, the kind I'd grown up breathing. "Are we done here? I'm taking Serena home."
Grandfather moved to the window, his reflection ghosting across the glass. "Eleanor," he said, his tone shifting to something that made my spine stiffen. "It's time you came back to handle the family business."
My fingers curled into fists at my sides. "We had a agreement."

He turned then, the dying sunlight casting harsh shadows across his face. "Business is business, we're not bound by rules."

The words hung in the air like smoke, acrid and suffocating. I knew better than to respond-years in this house had taught me when silence was the sharpest weapon. Instead, I helped Serena to her feet, keeping myself between her and Grandfather as we moved toward the door.

Just before we left, I caught Grandfather's reflection in the darkening window. He was watching us with an expression I knew too well-the look of a man who believed he'd already won the game.  

Serena's POV

The city lights blurred past the car window, matching my fractured state of mind. Eleanor sat beside me in silence. I kept my gaze fixed on the passing scenery, watching as familiar landmarks slipped by without really seeing them.

"Thanks for the ride," I said as we pulled up to my building, my voice eerily steady even to my own ears. Eleanor's reflection in the window showed her watching me with poorly concealed concern.

The doorman nodded respectfully as we entered the lobby. The elevator ride was silent, save for the soft hum of machinery and the gentle chime at each floor.

Inside my apartment, I moved through my evening routine with mechanical precision. Shoes lined up perfectly by the door. Bag placed on its designated hook. Jacket hung with mathematical accuracy in the closet.

"Serena." Eleanor's voice broke through my methodical movements. She was still here, of course. I'd almost forgotten.

"I'm going to take a shower," I announced, already heading toward my bedroom. "Make yourself comfortable."

The hot water couldn't wash away the evening's events, but it gave me something else to focus on. I counted the seconds under the spray, letting the steady rhythm of water droplets drown out any unwanted thoughts.

When I emerged, wrapped in my silk robe, Eleanor was sitting cross-legged on my bed. Her worried face was obvious.

"You don't have to stay," I said, carefully running a brush through my wet hair. "I'm fine."

"Serena, it's okay to cry." Eleanor's voice was gentle. "Trust me, holding it in only makes it worse. I've been there."

I met her eyes in the mirror, my lips curving into what I hoped was a convincing smile. "I'm fine, Eleanor. Really."

She moved to stand behind me, her reflection joining mine. "Listen, Serena. I don't care what happens between you and Lucas. You'll always be my best friend. Even if you two become mortal enemies."

My hands stilled on the brush. In the mirror, I watched as my fingers unconsciously straightened the already-perfect collar of my robe. "I trust you," I said finally. "And it's not because you're connected to the Harringtons." I set the brush down. "I've just... accepted reality. When you truly accept something, it stops hurting so much."

Eleanor's eyes filled with tears that I couldn't - wouldn't - shed myself. I turned away from the mirror, busying myself with arranging the pillows on my bed, each one at exactly the right angle.

"You don't have to be strong all the time," she whispered.

"I'm not being strong." My voice remained steady. "I'm being practical. Life goes on, Eleanor. The sun will rise tomorrow, meetings will be held, decisions will be made. That's all there is to it."

She watched as I methodically turned down the bed, each movement precise and controlled. Finally, she sighed. "I'll stay tonight."

"You don't need to."

"I know." She settled onto the chaise lounge by the window. "But I will."

I slipped between the sheets, every movement calm. Eleanor's quiet breathing, a reminder that I wasn't alone, even as I wrapped myself in solitude.

Sometimes, I reflected, acceptance feels a lot like numbness. But numbness was better than pain. Numbness was practical. And practical was all I could afford to be right now.
###chapter 127
Eleanor's POV

"Jace rescheduled my scenes," I said, watching her carefully. She lay there, perfectly still, her face a mask of composure that scared me more than any display of emotion would have. "He wants me to stay with you for a while."

She nodded slightly, her fingers smoothing an already-perfect wrinkle in her silk sheets. "That's not necessary."

"He also said something else." I leaned forward, my words tumbling out in a rush. "Don't trust anything my grandfather says. Don't agree to anything. Wait for Lucas to explain."

A slight tension around her eyes was the only indication she'd heard me. The silence stretched between us.

"Serena," I burst out, unable to contain myself any longer. "Lucas doesn't love Rachel. He couldn't have known about this engagement announcement. Think about it logically - why would he bring you there just to humiliate himself? It doesn't make sense!"

She turned her head slightly, meeting my desperate gaze with calm eyes. "Eleanor," her voice was gentle, almost pitying. "When your grandfather announces an engagement between Lucas and Rachel in front of all those people, what do you think the outcome will be, regardless of Lucas's feelings or knowledge?"

The question hit me like a physical blow. I opened my mouth to argue, then closed it again. My hands clutched at her cotton duvet, seeking anchor as my certainties began to crumble.

"But..." my voice wavered. "There must be a way..."

"The Harrington name carries weight," Serena continued, her voice maintaining that terrible calm. "Your grandfather's word is practically law in certain circles. Once announced, such an engagement becomes a matter of family honor, business alliances, and public perception."

I felt tears welling up in my eyes. "Lucas wouldn't - he's not -"

"It's not about what Lucas would or wouldn't do anymore," she said softly. "It's about what he can or cannot do."

The city lights blurred through my tears as the full weight of the situation finally hit me. I'd grown up in this world of power plays and family obligations, yet somehow I'd maintained a childish faith that love could conquer all. Watching Serena's composed acceptance, I felt naïve and helpless.

"I should have known," she continued, almost to herself. "The signs were there. The Thorne family's recent business movements, the timing of Rachel's return from London..."

"Stop," I whispered. "Please stop analyzing everything so calmly. How can you be so composed when everything's falling apart?"

She turned to me then, and for a brief moment, I caught a glimpse of something raw in her eyes before it vanished behind her careful mask. "Because falling apart isn't a luxury I can afford right now."

I slumped against the side of her bed, feeling suddenly exhausted. "I don't know what to do," I admitted.

"There's nothing to do," she replied. "And Eleanor?" She waited until I looked up at her. "Our friendship won't change, regardless of what happens between Lucas and me."

The words, meant to comfort, only made my heart ache more. Because Serena Sinclair was already preparing for a future where she and my brother were strangers, and there wasn't a thing I could do about it.

I woke to emptiness beside me, my hand instinctively reaching across the cool sheets where Serena had lain. Nine o'clock - later than usual. Sunlight streamed through the half-drawn curtains, casting long shadows across the bedroom floor. Last night's memories flooded back: lying awake, watching Serena's unnaturally still form beside me, her breathing too measured to be genuine sleep.

Rolling over, I recalled how she'd barely moved all night, maintaining that same rigid position hours after I'd finally dozed off. Even in distress she remained controlled, contained.

The scent of coffee drew me to the kitchen, where I found an immaculately arranged breakfast waiting. Everything was laid out with precise care - fresh fruit, yogurt, whole grain toast. A folded note sat propped against the coffee cup: "All sugar-free, low-fat." Those five words carried more tenderness than a thousand romantic declarations.

My phone buzzed as I settled at the table.

"Already at work?" I typed.

"At the TV station. Discussing collaboration," came her characteristically efficient reply.

I smiled, imagining her in some sleek conference room, commanding attention without effort. "Won't disturb your important business then. Breakfast was lovely. Love you."

"Love you." Two words, but they warmed me more than the coffee.

My contentment shattered as I scrolled through the morning news. There it was - my brother's engagement photos with Rachel Thorne splashed across every major outlet. They looked picture-perfect. The comments below gushed about the "perfect match" between our families, praising the Thornes' political connections and business empire.

Perfect match? More like a perfectly executed hostile takeover. My fingers tightened around my phone as I read article after article praising this "merger" of elite families.

"Need to discuss rescheduling the shoot timeline," I texted my agent, my jaw clenched. "If Serena's back at work, I should be too."
###chapter 128
Serena's POV

I scrolled through my phone, scanning the comments under the latest society news headline: "Harrington Heir Lucas Harrington and Rachel Thorne Announce Engagement."

My finger paused over a particularly heated discussion about Milo and Stella. Someone had written a lengthy speculation about them being Rachel's children, garnering hundreds of responses. A slight twinge flickered in my chest, but I closed the app with practiced indifference.

The phone buzzed - Ian Whitmore's name flashed across the screen. I considered letting it go to voicemail, but something made me answer.

"How does it feel?" His voice dripped with false concern. "Seeing the news?"

I kept my voice deliberately light. "Unless this is about business, I'm rather busy."

"Come now, Serena. We both know Lucas Harrington would never choose someone like you. Not with your... history."

A small smile curved my lips. "You mean like how Nina was your choice? How's that working out for the Whitmore family's influence in Manhattan these days?"

His sharp intake of breath told me the barb had landed. "You've gotten quite sharp with that tongue of yours."

"Learned from the best - your dear Nina." I traced a pattern on my desk with one finger. "Though I must say, watching Harrington International systematically dismantle both Whitmore and Sinclair interests in the market has been... educational."

"You-" he sputtered. "You're actually proud of being his puppet?"

"Oh Ian," I let out a soft laugh. "I don't need to compete with Rachel Thorne. I only need to know that Lucas was willing to target your family and mine. Actions speak louder than press releases, don't you think?"

The silence stretched between us. When he spoke again, his voice had lost its mocking edge. "Why did you hide it back then? Being Lumi Nova? If you had just told me-"

"Really?" I cut him off, my voice crystallizing into ice. "You want to discuss honesty? With me? After what you and Nina did?"

"Serena-"

"I have no interest in explaining myself to someone who betrayed me." My finger hovered over the end call button. "Goodbye. Don't call again."

I hung up before he could respond and turned back to my laptop, pushing thoughts of Lucas, Rachel, and old betrayals aside. 



Eleanor's POV

I arrived at the set earlier than scheduled. My heels clicked against the floor as I made my way through the bustling crew members.

"Miss Yates," my assistant hurried to my side, tablet in hand. "Mr. Gillard has already arranged the body double for today's intimate scene."

I couldn't help but let out a soft, sardonic laugh. "Has he now?" The thought of Jace Gillard personally selecting a body double seemed both amusing and irritating. "And I suppose he's particularly proud of his choice?"

"He mentioned she'd be perfect for the scene."

"We'll see about that," I muttered, adjusting my silk blouse. The studio lights were already blazing, transforming the set into a carefully constructed illusion of luxury.

Before I could make my way to my dressing room, a familiar, saccharine voice cut through the ambient noise of the set. "Eleanor! What a lovely surprise!"

Evelyn Whitmore stood near the director's chair, holding an elegantly wrapped box from Park Avenue Pastries. Her dress seemed excessive for a simple set visit, but then again, everything about Evelyn was excessive.

"I brought these amazing pastries," she gushed, her perfectly manicured fingers tapping the box. "They're absolutely divine. You simply must try-" She lifted the lid, then affected an exaggerated pout. "Oh no, they're all gone! I'm so sorry, Eleanor. The crew just couldn't resist them. I'll be sure to bring more next time."

I met her gaze with a cold smile. "Don't trouble yourself." Walking past her, I could feel her eyes burning into my back. The sweet fragrance of her perfume couldn't mask the sourness of her intentions.

Taking my position beside the monitor, I watched as Jace directed the lighting crew. "We're ready for the double," Jace called out.

I crossed my arms, prepared to critique whatever amateur he'd selected. But when the woman stepped onto the set, I felt my carefully maintained expression slip for just a moment. Her build, her posture, even the way she carried herself - the resemblance was uncanny.

"Hello, Miss Yates." Her voice was professional, respectful.

"Hello," I responded, studying her face. Jace's attention to detail was irritating in its perfection. "I hope you're prepared for multiple takes. We maintain high standards here."

"Of course." She nodded, completely unfazed by my cool tone.

As I watched her take her position on the set, I had to admit - silently and grudgingly - that perhaps Jace's eye for detail deserved more credit than I'd been willing to give. But I'd rather drink stale coffee than tell him that.

"Ready to begin," Jace announced, his voice carrying across the now-hushed set. "And... action."

I stood there, watching my double perform the scene I'd rehearsed countless times in my head, wondering if this was how others saw me - professional, and perfectly controlled.

I wrapped up a couple of close-ups and returned to the room to take my make-up off.

My phone's sudden vibration against the countertop. Mother's name flashed across the screen, and I felt my lips curl into an automatic smile.

"Dearest mother," I chirped, keeping my tone deliberately light. "Missing your precious princess already?"

The silence that followed was telling. I could practically feel the temperature drop through the phone.

"Eleanor." My mother's voice carried that particular edge that made me sit up straighter. "What's this I hear about you confronting your grandfather yesterday?"

I picked up another makeup wipe, trying to maintain my composure. "Grandfather was bullying Serena! I was just standing up for what's right. He can't just-"

"Enough." The word cut through my explanation like a knife. "You will apologize to him tonight."

"Tonight?" The makeup wipe froze halfway to my face. "What do you mean tonight?"

"The Thornes are coming for dinner. Howard wants to discuss Lucas and Rachel's engagement details."

My stomach dropped. "Lucas's engagement? But he doesn't even-" I paused, a horrible thought striking me. "Mother, I've been trying to reach him since last night. He's not answering his phone. Is he...?"

"You will be at dinner tonight," she continued as if I hadn't spoken. "This isn't up for discussion."

"Please," I switched tactics, letting a hint of vulnerability creep into my voice. "I have early shoots tomorrow. Can't you put in a good word for me? You know how much I love acting, I don't want to give it up so soon..."

"Eleanor." Her tone softened fractionally, but remained firm. "Some sacrifices are necessary. This dinner is important for the family."

"What's Grandfather planning?" I couldn't keep the frustration from my voice. "Lucas clearly doesn't want this marriage! You can't just-"

"Stay out of your brother's marriage arrangements with Rachel Thorne." The ice was back in her voice. "I don't mind your friendship with Serena, but some matters are beyond your authority. Do you understand?"

I bit my lip, tasting the waxy remnants of lipstick. "Yes, Mother."

My fingers hovered over my phone for a moment before typing out a quick message to Serena:

""SOS. No dinner at home tonight. Don't wait."

"Okay." Her reply came instantly.

"Dinner at the Harringtons' tonight. Should see my bro there. Pretty sure Gramps is holdin' him captive - why we can't reach him. I'll msg u when I see him," I sent another text. 

Serena didn't reply this time. I clutched my phone. No matter what, I had to find out my brother's true thoughts tonight.
###chapter 129
Evelyn's POV

I stood outside the dressing room, watching Eleanor gather her things through the half-open door. The sight of her bare face in the mirror's reflection only intensified my irritation - even without makeup, she possessed an effortless beauty that made my carefully crafted appearance feel overdone.

I adjusted the Cartier necklace, ensuring it caught the light. "Eleanor, rough day of filming?" I kept my voice sweet, leaning against the doorframe. "I heard you needed quite a few takes for that last scene."

Eleanor continued methodically packing her bag, her movements measured and calm. The lack of response made my fingers twitch against the doorframe. I stepped into the room.

"You know, Jace surprised me with this last night." I touched the necklace again. "Even with all those ridiculous tabloid stories, he's been so supportive. That's what real love looks like, Eleanor." The words came out sharper, betraying the anxiety churning beneath my composed exterior.

She finally turned to face me, her expression maddeningly serene. "That's wonderful, Evelyn. I'm happy for you both." Her genuine tone only fueled my growing agitation.

"Let's be clear about something." I moved closer, dropping all pretense of friendliness. "I've seen how you look at him during script readings. Whatever little game you're playing - using your supposed 'talent' to get close to him - it stops now." I smoothed my Chanel blazer. "You really think someone like you can make it in Manhattan? Without connections, without influence?"

My hands were trembling slightly, but I pressed on. "I'm having dinner with his family tonight. At their home." I bragged, my desperate need to assert dominance overwhelming my better judgment. "So whatever fantasies you're entertaining about Jace, forget them. You're nothing in this world, Eleanor. I can make sure you never work in this industry again."

Eleanor picked up her bag with the same quiet grace she'd shown all evening. "Thank you for your concern, Evelyn. Have a lovely dinner." She walked past me, her composure intact, leaving behind only the faint scent of perfume.

Eleanor carried herself with that irritating natural grace, her back perfectly straight, every movement calculated yet fluid - everything a Hollywood starlet should be. I watched her glide across the room, my blood beginning to simmer, the slight smudge in my lipstick from biting my lip too hard, the tension visible around my eyes.

Just wait. Once I solidify my connection with Jace, once I establish ties with the Harringtons... My lips curved into a tight smile as I imagined my first order of business: making sure Eleanor Yates never works in this industry again. 



Eleanor's POV

Standing in front of the Harrington mansion, I arrived earlier than planned. Through the grand windows, I could see only my grandfather Howard, along with my parents Grant and Clara, sitting in the formal living room. Everyone else was yet to arrive.

Several times I wanted to ask about tonight's plans, but Mom's warning glances kept me quiet. Still, just sitting there felt awkward and unbearably boring.

After some thought, I stood up and suggested, "Maybe I should wait by the entrance to greet my brother? Wouldn't that make it feel more... ceremonial?"

Before Clara could respond, surprisingly, Grandfather nodded. "Go ahead."

I happily took my leave from the living room. Truth be told, I just wanted to escape Grandfather's watchful eyes so I could check my phone. One of the Harrington household's strict rules: no phones in front of the elders.

Making my way to the grand entrance, I pulled out my phone while waiting for my brother. The minutes ticked by slowly as I scrolled through my messages.



Evelyn's POV

The Harrington mansion loomed before us, its limestone facade catching the golden hues of sunset. As our car pulled up to the ornate iron gates, my heart fluttered with anticipation. This was meant to be my moment - my official introduction to the Harrington family.

"Wait here for a moment," Jace said, his attention already fixed on his buzzing phone. "I need to take this call."

I stepped out of the car, smoothing my dress for the hundredth time. The gates slowly swung open with a soft mechanical whir, their elaborate metalwork casting intricate shadows across the cobblestone driveway. Everything about this place spoke of old money and power - exactly the world I belonged in.

My fingers traced the diamond pendant at my throat. Why did Jace always do this? Leaving me alone at crucial moments, as if I were some afterthought to his busy schedule. I checked my reflection in my compact mirror, ensuring every detail was perfect. My makeup was flawless, my hair expertly styled - I looked every inch the future Mrs. Harrington.

Then I saw her.

At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. Eleanor Yates, standing there by the side entrance as if she had every right to be here. My blood turned to ice, then quickly began to boil.

"What the hell?" The words escaped in a harsh whisper. This couldn't be happening. Not here, not now.

She hadn't noticed me yet, her attention focused on her phone. She looked infuriatingly put-together in a simple white blazer and tailored pants. My mind raced with possibilities - each more infuriating than the last. 

Is she deliberately trying to cause a scene just because I mentioned I was coming? The audacity of this woman is beyond belief!

I can feel my nails digging into my palms as rage courses through my body. There's no way I'm letting her ruin my important meeting with the Harringtons. This is supposed to be my moment - my official introduction to the family.

I stride toward her, my dress swishing with each determined step. My vision narrows, focused solely on her smug face. 

"Why are you here?" My voice came out sharp, causing her to look up. "Are you stalking us now?"

SLAP!

Before she could respond, before she could spin whatever lie she'd prepared, something in me snapped. All the frustration, the insecurity, the barely contained rage - it exploded in one violent moment. My hand moved of its own accord, the sharp crack of the slap echoing in the evening air.

Time seemed to freeze. Eleanor's head remained turned to the side, a red mark blooming on her cheek. My palm stung. In the distance, I heard car doors closing, footsteps approaching.

My perfectly planned evening lay in shambles around me, much like my composure. But as I stood there, trembling with a mixture of horror and lingering rage.

What had I done?
###chapter 130
Eleanor's POV

My cheek burned with the stinging aftermath of Evelyn's slap. The sound echoed in the air, leaving even the security guards frozen in shock. I touched my face, the heat beneath my fingertips a stark contrast to the cold wind.

I had expected Evelyn to be surprised, maybe even angry, but physical violence? That was new. Her eyes blazed with fury as she jabbed a finger in my direction.

"Eleanor Yates, have you no shame?" She practically spat the words. "How dare you show up here! After what you did this afternoon, preventing me from meeting Jace's parents?"

The security guards exchanged uncertain glances, clearly torn between their duty to maintain order and their reluctance to intervene in what appeared to be a personal dispute. I felt my own anger rising - in all my years, no one except Jace had ever dared to treat me this way.

My hand was already rising for retaliation when a firm grip caught my wrist. Jace. Of course.

"Stop." His voice carried that familiar commanding tone that used to make my heart skip. Now it just fueled my anger.

Evelyn immediately ducked behind him, her expression morphing into one of calculated vulnerability. The transformation was almost impressive - from attacking tigress to wounded dove in seconds.

"Let go," I demanded, my voice ice-cold.

"Violence isn't the answer," Jace said, still holding my wrist. "If you need to hit someone, hit me instead. Consider it payment for what I owe you."

A cold smile tugged at my lips as I glanced between him and Evelyn. Her triumphant smirk from moments ago had faltered, replaced by uncertainty.

"How touching," I replied, my tone dripping with sarcasm. "Such devotion. How can I hit you if you don't let go?" I shifted my arm.

I could feel Jace's grip loosening slightly. The moment his fingers relaxed, I yanked my hand free. But instead of striking him as he'd expected, I spun around and slapped Evelyn hard across her face. The crack echoed in the air.

"You-" Evelyn's shriek cut through the air as she stumbled backward, her hand flying to her reddening cheek. "How dare you!"

"How dare I?" I adjusted my sleeve calmly, smoothing out an invisible wrinkle. "I simply returned what was given."

Evelyn lunged forward, but Jace caught her arm. Her perfectly styled hair had come loose, matching her unraveling composure. "Let go of me! Who does she think she is? Some nobody who sneaked her way into the Harrington mansion?"

I watched her tantrum with detached amusement, noting how quickly her polished socialite facade had crumbled. The corners of my mouth lifted in a cool smile.

"Nobody?" I arched an eyebrow, my voice dropping to a silky whisper. "Perhaps you're right. I'm just Howard Harrington's granddaughter." 

The words fell like stones into still water. Evelyn's face drained of color, her mouth opening and closing without sound. Jace's grip on her arm went slack.

"His... what?" Evelyn finally managed to choke out.

"His granddaughter," I repeated, savoring each syllable. "Though I suppose 'nobody' does have a certain ring to it. Less complicated than explaining how I'm his daughter's daughter, don't you think?"

The silence that followed was deafening. It was fascinating, really, watching her worldview shift in real time.

"You're lying," Evelyn spat, but her voice trembled. "If that were true-"

"If that were true, what?" I cut her off smoothly. "Would you have thought twice before raising your hand to me? Or are you only concerned about consequences now?"

I stared at Jace without a hint of concern for Evelyn's obvious rage. I really didn't want to look at him, but sometimes it was unavoidable.

"You should remember your place," I said coldly. "You're only my grandfather's adopted son. You have no blood ties to the Harrington family, and absolutely no right to inherit any part of Harrington International Holdings. To us - the real Harringtons - you're nothing but an outsider. Someone dispensable. So you have no right to demand anything from me. I'll hit whoever I please!"

Only those who truly know each other understand exactly which words cut the deepest.

"Understood. I'll keep that in mind next time," Jace replied, accepting my harsh judgment and belittlement with cold detachment.

He knew just as well how to wound me most deeply.

I turned and walked away. When you get used to something, it stops mattering altogether.




Evelyn's POV

My world tilted on its axis. Eleanor's words echoed in my head like a nightmare I couldn't wake from. Howard Harrington's granddaughter. The phrase kept repeating, each iteration making less sense than the last.

I sought refuge in denial, grasping at the familiar contempt I'd always felt for her. The shabby wannabe actress, the desperate social climber - those were the comfortable labels I'd assigned her. But now those certainties were crumbling like sand castles at high tide.

"That's impossible," I whispered, my voice betraying me with a tremor. My fingers twisted the strap of my bag, the leather creaking in protest. "The Harringtons would never..."

The proof was right there in Jace's face - that carefully blank expression he wore when confirming uncomfortable truths. My stomach lurched as memories crashed over me: every snide comment, every orchestrated humiliation, every time I'd dismissed Eleanor as nothing more than an opportunistic gold digger.

"Tell me it's not true," I pleaded with Jace, hating how weak I sounded. The manicured gardens of the Harrington estate seemed to spin around me. "Jace, please."

His silence was devastating. The gentle rustle of leaves in the spring breeze felt like mocking laughter.

"I didn't know," I stammered, the words tumbling out in desperate justification. "How could I possibly have known? She was just some struggling actress, she never..."

My legs threatened to give way as the full implications hit me. I'd spent months tormenting Howard Harrington's granddaughter. The man whose social connections could make or break entire dynasties.

Eleanor's retreating figure blurred as panic clawed at my throat. The irony was excruciating. All this time, I'd looked down on her as a social inferior, when she'd been born into the very inner circle I'd spent my life trying to penetrate. I felt sick.
###chapter 131
Evelyn's POV

The convoy of Bentleys glided up the curved driveway of the Harrington estate, their polished surfaces gleaming in the spring sunlight. I found myself instinctively straightening my Chanel dress as the entire Harrington clan emerged to welcome their guests. Even Howard Harrington, the family patriarch, was wheeled out by butler.

My heart skipped a beat when I spotted Clara Harrington and Grant Yates among the welcoming party. They rarely appeared at public, making this occasion all the more significant. Eleanor Yates lingered by the massive oak doors.

The first Bentley's door opened with practiced precision. Lucas Harrington stepped out, his tall frame commanding immediate attention. Without missing a beat, he turned and extended his hand toward the passenger side. My breath caught as a woman emerged - Rachel Thorne, the name had been making waves in Manhattan's social circles.

"Thank you," she said, her voice carrying just the right note of gracious warmth. Her blue Dior suit caught the sunlight, making her appear almost ethereal.

"You're welcome." Lucas's response was coolly polite, maintaining the careful distance of old-money propriety. 

I couldn't help but compare her to Serena. Where Serena blazed like an uncontrolled fire, Rachel moved with the precise grace of someone born into privilege. The thought of Serena's mere existence suddenly seemed gauche in comparison.

The family patriarch, Clarence Thorne, emerged next, supported by another impeccably dressed butler. His presence seemed to add gravitas to the already weighty atmosphere. "Howard, my old friend," he called out, genuine warmth breaking through his usual reserve.

"Clarence." Howard Harrington's stern features softened marginally. "It's been too long."

I watched as Franklin and Audrey Thorne, followed by their son Garrett, completed the picture-perfect family tableau. I'd already spent hours poring over every article I could find about the Thornes. Each new detail I'd discovered had only made Serena seem more inadequate in comparison.

Lost in my thoughts, I didn't notice Rachel's gaze falling on me until it was too late. Our eyes met briefly, and I felt my cheeks flush at being caught staring. She gave me a small, gracious smile that somehow made me feel even smaller. In that moment, I understood with crystal clarity why the Harringtons had chosen her.

For the first time in my life, I felt completely out of my depth.

I stole another glance at those around me. Eleanor Yates stood not far away, radiating an effortless grace that made my stomach twist. Everything about her demeanor spoke of someone who had been born into this world, not merely invited into it.

My eyes drifted to Jace. He too seemed perfectly at ease, as though such gatherings were as natural as breathing. They all carried themselves with an innate confidence that came from generations of wealth and power.

Among these true elites of society, I felt like an imposter in designer clothes.

The feeling churning in my gut was pure humiliation. For the first time in my life, I experienced what it meant to be truly outclassed. That deep-seated inadequacy blooming in my chest was foreign to me - I, who had always considered myself above others. Yet here I was, at what should have been a simple family dinner, feeling completely diminished.

What stung even more was the realization that I had imagined myself to be the evening's focal point - after all, wasn't I here to meet the family? But the Harringtons hadn't spared me a single meaningful glance. The utter dismissal from these people who actually mattered in society was almost unbearable.



Eleanor's POV

I sat at the dinner table, watching grandfather and Clarence Thorne dominate the conversation with their endless reminiscing about the old days. Their rapport was obvious.

"I truly apologize for missing Harrington International's 50th anniversary celebration last night," Clarence said apologetically. "I had an unexpected meeting in Boston."

"Come now, we're too close for such formalities," Howard waved it off. "Though I did take the liberty of announcing Lucas and Rachel's engagement in your absence. I hope you don't mind?"

"Mind? The announcement being made on such an important day for Harrington International is an honor for Rachel," Clarence quickly responded.

"You're too kind - Lucas is the fortunate one to marry Rachel. It's an honor for the Harrington family," Howard insisted.

They continued their mutual flattery while I couldn't help but watch my brother. With the elders present, I hadn't gotten a chance to speak with him privately. His expression remained completely unreadable - I couldn't tell if he accepted or rejected this arranged marriage with the Thorne family, and it was making me anxious.

"Since you're here in Manhattan, you should stay a while," Howard suggested warmly. "Lucas can show you around. The city's changed dramatically these past years."

"Perfect timing - my schedule is clear this week, though I have to be in Boston next week," Clarence agreed. "Though with my health, I'd prefer just having tea and chess matches with you."

"Quite right. As you can see, I'm not very mobile myself these days," Howard gestured to his wheelchair. "Let the young people enjoy themselves. Lucas has been back six months now, but Rachel's been abroad so long, she might need a refresher on the city."

"Understood," Lucas replied - not enthusiastic, but not resistant either.

I watched this whole scene unfold with mounting frustration. Damn it, Lucas was such a jerk sometimes.
###chapter 132
Eleanor's POV

My gaze kept drifting to the other end of the long dining table, where Lucas was being his usual perfect self. The way he leaned over to place a slice of prime rib on Rachel's plate made my stomach churn.

*Screw his gentlemanly manners.*

Rachel's smile was genuine as she thanked him. My grip tightened on my fork until my knuckles turned white.

"Eleanor." Mr. Thorne's voice cut through my thoughts like a knife. "I hear you've been doing quite well on Beneath a Starlit Sky?"

I nearly bit my tongue, quickly composing my features into what I hoped was a gracious smile. "Thank you for your interest, Mr. Thorne. I've just been lucky enough to act the film."

"Luck?" He chuckled, swirling the red wine in his glass. "From what I've seen, you've got real talent. Though I must admit, I never expected Grant's daughter to pursue a career in entertainment."

I dabbed at my lips with the crisp linen napkin, buying time to formulate a response. "Well," I offered a self-deprecating laugh, "when your grades aren't stellar, sometimes you have to find... alternative career paths."

"Now, now, don't sell yourself short." His eyes crinkled at the corners as he studied me. "You've built quite a name for yourself. But tell me, at your age, surely you're thinking about settling down?"

The question hit like ice water down my spine. From the corner of my eye, I caught Garrett shifting in his seat, suddenly very interested in our conversation.

"Someone like me," I kept my tone light as I lifted my wine glass, "should really focus on their career. The entertainment industry isn't exactly forgiving when it comes to dating."

"Career is important for young people," Mr. Thorne nodded sagely, then glanced meaningfully at his grandson. "But one shouldn't neglect matters of the heart. Take Garrett, for instance - successful in his own right, from a good family..."

"Oh no, please," I rushed to interject, nearly spilling my wine in my haste. "Garrett's practically like a brother to me. We grew up together, it would be..." I forced a laugh.

Garrett cleared his throat. "I wouldn't mind exploring the possibility," he said quietly, causing me to nearly choke on my sip of wine.

The crystal glasses clinked too loudly as I set mine down with trembling fingers. "You can't be serious," I managed, trying to keep my voice steady. "We've known each other since we were kids."

"Sometimes that's the best foundation," Mr. Thorne interjected helpfully, looking entirely too pleased with himself.

I smoothed my napkin across my lap, buying time to steady my nerves. "I appreciate the thought, but my contract has strict clauses about dating. My management would have a fit." The excuse sounded weak even to my own ears, but I pressed on. "Besides, I'm sure Garrett can find someone much more suitable."

Garrett pushed his glasses up and smiled. "That's not quite right."

My eyes widened in disbelief.

Rachel chimed in from beside us, "I really like Eleanor's personality too. Being around you always brings such joy. My brother actually talks about you quite often - he's watched every single movie and TV show you've been in."

I turned to Garrett, my voice trembling slightly. "You... you're not actually interested in me, are you?"

Garrett's smile remained gentle and warm.

He was sitting right next to me - probably not a coincidence in the seating arrangement. 

Then, like an older brother would, he reached out and patted my head. "I said I like your personality, not that I'm interested in you. Though, since we're both single, if you're interested, we could give it a try..."

"Not interested," I cut him off immediately. "Actors in our industry aren't allowed to date casually. Besides, my brother and your sister are discussing marriage - let's not make things more complicated than they need to be."

"It wouldn't be complicated at all. It would bring our families even closer," Mr. Thorne said with a laugh.

"Grandfather, don't scare Eleanor." Garrett's protective tone was obvious as he came to my defense. "She's right - Lucas and Rachel's wedding should be our priority right now."

"Their marriage is already set in stone - we just need to pick an auspicious date." Mr. Thorne replied casually. "I'm just worried about you being alone at your age. You should seize opportunities when they present themselves."

"Yes, understood."

The silence that followed felt endless, broken only by the soft clink of silverware against fine china. 

Finally, mercifully, someone changed the subject to the latest market fluctuations. I let out a breath I hadn't realized I'd been holding, though my appetite was completely gone. The rest of dinner passed in a blur of forced smiles and mechanical responses, while my mind raced with barely contained emotions.
###chapter 133
Eleanor's POV

I glanced over my shoulder for the third time, making sure the others were still absorbed in their evening chess games. Grandfather's methodical style meant those matches could stretch for hours - perfect for what I needed to do.

"Lucas," I hissed, pulling my brother toward the darker corner of the yard. The perfectly manicured hedges provided some cover, but I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. "What's going on with Rachel Thorne?"

His face remained impassive, but I caught the slight tightening of his jaw. Under the dim light, the shadows seemed to deepen the lines of tension around his eyes.

"And what about Serena?" I pressed on, my voice rising despite my efforts to stay quiet. "Do you have any idea what she's going through? She's been trying to reach you for days! No calls, no messages - you just vanished. What's she supposed to think?"

"My phone was confiscated," Lucas said flatly, his gaze sliding toward the room.

"What?" The word came out as a strangled whisper. "Grandfather did this?"

"I'm being monitored," he continued, his voice carrying that careful control I recognized from our childhood - the tone he used when things were seriously wrong. "Until Rachel leaves Manhattan."

"Damn it!" I dug into my purse, fingers closing around my phone. "Here, use mine. Just let her know-"

"Mr. Harrington." A deep voice cut through the darkness, making me jump. Two suited figures materialized from behind the hedges, their presence turning the garden's shadows suddenly menacing. "Mr. Howard's orders are clear. No unauthorized communication."

"Christ!" I spat, my hand clenching around my phone. "This is ridiculous! You can't just-"

"Eleanor." Lucas's quiet voice stopped my outburst. His expression hadn't changed, but there was something in his eyes - a determination I hadn't seen before. "Tell her to wait for me."

The security guards moved closer, their message clear. I watched helplessly as they escorted Lucas back toward the house, his tall figure disappearing into the house.

The clock in the hallway struck half past ten, its deep chimes echoing through the corridor of the Harrington mansion. Mother's insistence on me staying overnight at the mansion felt like another one of her calculated moves, though I couldn't quite figure out the angle yet.

The evening had dragged on endlessly until grandfather and Clarence finally retired to their rooms. Only then did the suffocating atmosphere begin to dissipate, allowing the rest of us to disperse. As I made my way down the hallway toward my room, an unexpected sight caught my attention.

Through the partially open door of Jace's room, I glimpsed Evelyn Whitmore - a far cry from her usual dramatic self. She was perched on the edge of a chair, her usual confidence notably absent. I couldn't help but smirk at the sight. The social butterfly of Manhattan, reduced to skulking around in the shadows. How fitting.

"Eleanor?" Jace's voice came from behind me, and I turned slowly, maintaining my composure. "Aren't you going to Serena's tonight?"

I met his gaze with a cool smile. "Don't worry. I'll make sure my windows are sealed tight. Whatever noise you and Evelyn make next door, I won't hear a thing."

His expression tightened almost imperceptibly. "That's not what I meant."

"Isn't it?" I kept my voice deliberately light, though the underlying edge was unmistakable.

"Garrett Thorne is a good man," he said suddenly, catching me off guard with the abrupt change of subject.

I felt something cold settle in my chest. "I know he is. But my personal life is exactly that - personal. You don't need to concern yourself with it, Uncle Jace." The formal title felt like ice on my tongue. "Rest assured, I harbor no expectations regarding you. I won't interfere with your romance. As for my issues with Evelyn, that's between her and me. Whether she's your girlfriend or not doesn't change my opinion of her. Of course, I'll maintain appearances in front of the Harringtons. I won't disrupt your marriage plans."

"Eleanor, that's not-"

"I don't care what you mean," I cut him off, reaching for my door handle. "I'm telling you this only so you'll stop trying to insert yourself into my life. Goodnight, Uncle Jace."

The heavy door closed behind me with a decisive click, the sound echoing in the silence of the hallway. In the darkness of my room, I allowed myself a moment of weakness, pressing my forehead against the cool wood. Then I straightened up, squared my shoulders, and moved away from the door.










Evelyn's POV

I spot Eleanor Yates standing by the doorway.

Jace had been called away by Howard Harrington, asking me to wait in the room until he could take me home. I don't even know why I came here tonight. Not a single person in the Harrington household has given me more than a passing glance.

Seeing Eleanor now is excruciating. Every condescending remark, every snide comment I've ever made about her flashes through my mind. The arrogance in my words makes me want to sink through the floor. God, what will people say when they find out about her true identity? I can already imagine the headlines, the social media storm, all aimed at me.

Eleanor notices my discomfort - of course she does. The slight curl of her lip tells me everything I need to know about what she thinks of me.

She walks past me with the kind of confidence I used to possess, her head held high, practically radiating disdain. The irony isn't lost on me - this is exactly how I used to treat her. 

My salvation arrived in the form of quick footsteps approaching the waiting room. I immediately softened my expression, tilting my head just so as Jace Gillard appeared in the doorway.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice professionally neutral. "Father would like to see you in his study."

My heart skipped. Howard Harrington wanted to see *me*? I fought to keep my voice steady. "Mr. Harrington... wants to see me?"

"Yes. If you'll follow me."

I rose gracefully, making sure to let a hint of vulnerability show in my movements. "Jace," I said softly as we entered the hallway, my voice honey-sweet, "is your father... is he in a good mood?"

"He deals with facts, not moods." Jace's clipped response sent a chill down my spine.

*What happened to the man who used to hang on my every word?*

The hallway stretched endlessly before us. I tried to slow my pace, to prolong these moments with Jace, but he maintained a perfectly professional distance.

As we approached the study's imposing double doors, panic began to rise in my throat. "You're coming in with me, aren't you?" I reached for his arm, but he smoothly stepped aside.

"He asked to see you alone." Jace's face might as well have been carved from marble.

"Jace..." I let a pleading note enter my voice, one that used to work so well.

"Just be direct with him. He appreciates honesty." The irony in his tone was subtle but unmistakable.

I watched him retreat down the hallway, leaving me alone before the massive doors. Taking a deep breath, I raised my hand to knock. The sound seemed to echo through the entire mansion, sealing my fate with each reverberation.
###chapter 134
Evelyn's POV

The massive doors closed behind me with an ominous thud. Howard Harrington's study seemed to stretch endlessly before me, dominated by floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.

"Mr. Harrington," I softened my voice to its most dulcet tones, channeling years of charm school training. "Thank you for taking the time to-" My heels caught on the edge of an antique rug, sending me stumbling against a priceless chair. "I'm so sorry!" I gasped, my carefully cultivated poise deserting me.

"Sit down, Evelyn." His voice held all the warmth.

I perched on the edge of another antique chair, hands folded demurely in my lap to hide their trembling. The silence stretched between us.

"The Whitmore family's current... situation." Howard finally spoke, each word precisely chosen. "You must be aware of it."

My heart stuttered. "I... I don't see what that has to do with-"

"The Harrington family," he cut through my protest like a steel blade, "is not within your reach."

The smile I'd been desperately maintaining crumpled. "But Jace and I... we truly love each other..."

"Love?" His laugh held no humor. "Your performance at the Battle of the Needle. Your scene at Le Jardin. The paparazzi incidents at the Charity Gala. All of Manhattan has witnessed your... theatrics."

Each accusation landed like a physical blow. "Those were misunderstandings! I never meant-"

"Jace's attention to you," he continued as if I hadn't spoken, "was merely sympathy. Nothing more."

The truth in his words cut deeper than any denial could have. "I'm offering you three choices." Howard's voice was clinically detached. "One: leave Jace voluntarily. Two: accept compensation for a clean break. Three: I speak with your father directly."

My vision blurred with unshed tears. The mighty Whitmore name that I'd wielded like a shield now felt like defenseless.

"I..." My voice cracked. I forced myself to meet his steel-gray eyes. "I want an S-plus grade leading role script."

Howard's slight nod felt like the final nail in my social coffin. "A wise choice. The contract will be delivered to your lawyer tomorrow."

I rose on shaky legs, my dress suddenly feeling like a cheap costume. As I reached the door, his voice stopped me one final time.

"Evelyn? The next time you visit the Harrington estate, it will be as an actress at a social function. Nothing more."






After I left the study, I could still hear his words, each syllable precise and cutting: "The Harrington family has certain... standards, Miss Whitmore."

I quickened my pace, desperate to maintain some semblance of dignity. The palatial corridors of the Harrington mansion, now felt suffocating. Every oil painting, every antique vase seemed to witness my downfall.

When I finally saw Jace standing by his Bentley in the circular driveway, something inside me shattered. The perfectly coordinated facade I'd maintained in Howard's study crumbled completely. "You knew," I choked out, my voice barely above a whisper. "You knew all along they would never accept me."

Jace's expression remained impassive, his eyes carefully neutral. The same eyes I'd once found so captivating now felt like steel walls. His silence only fueled the fire building in my chest.

"Was this your plan?" My voice rose. "Bring me here to be humiliated? To be told I'm not good enough for the mighty Harrington name?" My hand struck his cheek before I even realized I'd moved. The sharp crack seemed to hang in the air between us.

"Evelyn." His voice was quiet, controlled. Always so controlled. "You're making a scene."

"A scene?" I laughed, the sound brittle and sharp. "If you wanted to end things, you could have just told me directly. But no, you had to orchestrate this whole spectacle, didn't you?"

The security lights cast harsh shadows across his face as he touched his reddening cheek. "My father was actually being kind. He offered-"

"To be friends?" I cut him off, forcing my voice to soften, to steady. Years of social training kicked in automatically. "Of course. The Whitmores and Harringtons have always been... friends."

Something flickered in his eyes - surprise at my sudden composure, perhaps. I dabbed at my tears with precise movements, careful not to smudge my makeup. "You're right. I apologize for my outburst. It was... unbecoming."

The leather seats of his car creaked as we settled in for the drive me home. I stared out the window, watching the exclusive suburbs of Upper East Side drift by. My reflection in the tinted glass showed a perfect mask of serenity, but beneath it, my mind was already spinning with possibilities.

Friendship could be... useful. The game wasn't over - it was merely changing shape. I'd been raised in this gilded cage of power and privilege; I knew exactly how many doors could be opened with the right connections, the right pressure points.

"I hope we can still be friends, Jace," I said softly, my voice hitting that perfect note of vulnerable sincerity. "I'd hate to lose your... friendship."

I allowed myself a small smile. *Time is on my side*.

Just because we're breaking up now doesn't mean it's forever. Agreeing to end things with Jace was purely strategic - a temporary retreat. Getting something out of it was just smart business.

The car pulled up to the Whitmore Manor. Just as I reached for the car door handle, Jace's voice stopped me. "Evelyn, wait." The soft purr of the Bentley's idle engine filled the silence between us. 

"About Eleanor..." He hesitated, something rare for him. "I'd appreciate if you could keep what happened today private."

The mention of her name sent an immediate surge of irritation through me. Eleanor Yates. Even thinking about her made my jaw clench. "Of course," I replied, my voice honey-sweet. "We wouldn't want to tarnish the pristine Harrington family image, would we?"

Jace's expression shifted slightly - a minute tightening around his eyes that most people would miss. But I'd spent weeks studying his every micro-expression. "It's not about image, Evelyn. It's about respect."

"Respect?" I couldn't keep the edge from my voice. "Like the respect she showed you today? The way she mocked you in front of me?"

"Eleanor has always been... direct," he said, and something in his tone made my stomach twist. There was an undertone of warmth there, of understanding. Of affection.

The pieces suddenly clicked into place, forming a picture I'd been too blind to see. The way he always defended her. How he'd smile slightly at her sharp comments. The fact that he'd never once criticized her, even when she clearly deserved it.

"You have feelings for her." It wasn't a question.

"No." His response was immediate, but there was something in his eyes - a flicker of something I couldn't quite read.

"Don't lie to me," I pressed, turning to face him fully. The streetlight cast harsh shadows across his face. "I've seen how you look at her, how you always take her side."

"She's family, Evelyn. That's all."

I laughed, the sound sharp in the quiet night air. "Family doesn't mock you like she did today. Family doesn't go out of their way to undermine you at every turn."

"You don't understand-"

"Then explain it to me," I challenged. "Explain why you're so protective of someone who clearly doesn't respect you."

His silence spoke volumes. I watched as he gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles whitening. "It's complicated," he finally said.

"Is it because of Howard?" I asked, my voice softer now. "Is he the reason you won't admit your feelings for her?"

"There are no feelings to admit." His voice was firm, but I'd learned long ago that firmness often masked uncertainty. "Goodnight, Evelyn."

I stepped out of the car, the cool night air hitting my face. I watched his Bentley disappear down the curved driveway. *It didn't matter. Whether he admitted his feelings for Eleanor or not, I wasn't about to step aside.*
###chapter 135
Eleanor's POV

The black sedan's taillights disappeared into the darkness. I fished out a cigarette from my purse, the flame from my lighter briefly illuminating the somber expression. Taking a long drag, I watched the smoke curl upward into the night sky. 

My phone felt heavy in my pocket. I knew I needed to call Serena, but finding the right words seemed impossible. Finally, I pulled out my phone and dialed her number.

She picked up on the third ring. I forced a lightness into my voice. "Hey, workaholic! Don't tell me you're still at the office?"

"Eleanor." Her voice carried its usual calm strength. "Just wrapping up some things."

"Still working? You've been pushing yourself too hard." I couldn't keep the concern from my voice. "When was the last time you ate?"

"Well, I was away for a week." Her tone remained even, but I caught the slight emphasis on 'away' - a subtle reference to her time with Lucas that made my heart clench.

I leaned against balcony parapet, taking another drag from my cigarette. "That's exactly why you should be taking it easy. The StarRiver Group won't collapse if you leave before midnight for once."

"There's too much to catch up on." A pause, then the sound of papers shuffling. "But I'm almost done here."

I bit my lip, knowing what I had to say next. The words felt like lead on my tongue. "I... I saw my brother today."

The shuffling stopped. The silence on the other end was deafening.

"He's under grandfather's surveillance," I continued, my voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "He can't call or see you right now. But he wants you to wait for him."

I held my breath, expecting... well, I wasn't sure what I expected. Anger? Sadness? Instead, Serena's response came with an almost philosophical acceptance that took me by surprise.

"Manhattan isn't that big," she said softly. "If Lucas wants to see me, well, it wouldn't be too difficult for him."

Her words made me smile despite everything. "You're taking this better than I expected."

"What's there to take?" A hint of amusement colored her words. "Your grandfather can't keep him locked up forever. This is Manhattan, not a medieval castle."

I crushed my cigarette under my heel, watching the last ember die out. "You're right. But still, take care of yourself, okay? You shouldn't work so late."

"Says the person calling me at nearly midnight." The gentle teasing in her voice made me laugh.

"Fair point. I won't be home tonight - there are some things I need to handle here." I started walking toward the room. "But I'll be back tomorrow to check on you."

"I'm not a child, Eleanor."

"No, but you're my friend. And friends look out for each other." I suggested. "Get some rest soon, okay?"

After ending the call, I slipped my phone back into my pocket, my steps quickening as I rushed toward Lucas's wing. My heart was racing - I needed to tell him about Serena's response, to give him hope in the prison our grandfather had created.

But as I rounded the corner, two suited figures materialized from the shadows, blocking my path. My stomach dropped.

"I need to see my brother." I tried to keep my voice steady.

The taller guard's face remained impassive. "Mr. Harrington is asleep."

"Then wake him up." The words came out sharper than I intended, my patience already wearing thin.

"Mr. Howard's orders - no one sees him alone."

I felt my nails digging into my palms. "I'm his sister-"

"Especially you, Miss Yates." The guard's interruption was like a slap in the face. The message was clear - my closeness to Serena made me a liability in grandfather's eyes.

"Damn it!" The curse escaped before I could stop it, echoing off the walls.

Standing there in the hallway, the reality of our situation hit me full force. This wasn't just about keeping Lucas away from Serena anymore. The emergence of the Rachel Thorne marriage prospect, the increased security - grandfather was serious about controlling every aspect of Lucas's life.

I turned away, my heels practically stabbing the carpet as I stormed down the hallway. Almost without conscious thought, my feet carried me toward another wing of the house - toward Jace's room.

I told myself I was just going to wait a few minutes, see if he came back. Just as I was about to give up, convinced I was being foolish, I heard footsteps.

"Looking for me?"

Jace's voice, quiet and controlled. I turned slowly.

"I need you to tell Lucas something. Serena said she'll wait. I tried to tell him myself, but the guards wouldn't let me in. Grandfather must have specifically mentioned me because of my friendship with Serena..." I said calmly. 

Jace studied me with those penetrating eyes of his, and nodded slightly.

"Thank you," I said finally, when the silence grew too heavy. The words came out soft, formal, nothing like the passionate arguments we used to have.

I returned to my room and shut the door, feeling no flicker of emotion.
###chapter 136
Serena's POV

The headlines dominated my phone screen for the third day in a row. Vanguard Media seemed determined to document every minute Lucas Harrington spent with Rachel Thorne. Today's featured photo showed him opening a car door for her outside Harrington International's headquarters, his tall figure slightly bent in a gentlemanly pose. The caption read: "Power Couple Alert? Harrington Heir Continues to Show Special Attention to Thorne Heiress."

I scrolled past it, my thumb hovering for a fraction longer than necessary. The accompanying article dissected their supposed three-day "courtship tour" across Manhattan - from Central Park to Fifth Avenue's luxury boutiques, and now to the corporate headquarters. Each sighting meticulously detailed, each gesture analyzed.

The quarterly reports on my desk demanded attention, yet my thoughts kept drifting to two much more appealing distractions.

Milo and Stella. Their faces appeared in my mind - Milo's mischievous grin when he managed to sneak an extra cookie, Stella's serious expression as she explained her latest artwork. A smile tugged at my lips despite my mood.

"I need a break," I muttered, reaching for my phone again.I dialed a familiar number.

"Walter? This is Serena."

"Miss Sinclair." Walter's steady voice came through immediately. "How may I help you?"

"Are Milo and Stella home? I was thinking of taking them out for ice cream." The words came out more hesitant than I'd intended.

"Of course. Mr. Harrington specifically mentioned you have unrestricted access to visit them anytime."

I inhaled sharply at the mention of Lucas, keeping my voice carefully neutral. "Thank you. I'll be there in twenty minutes."

The doors opened silently to the familiar hallway. I'd been here times before, but something felt different. The penthouse door was slightly ajar.

I pushed it open, stepping into the expansive living room with its floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Hudson River. And froze.

Rachel Thorne stood by the panoramic windows, her elegant figure silhouetted against the afternoon light. She turned at my entrance and our eyes met in the reflection before she faced me fully.

"Miss Sinclair," she said, her smile perfectly positioned. "What a surprise."

I maintained my composure. "Indeed. I'm here for the twins."

"Of course you are." Rachel's voice carried a hint of something I couldn't quite identify. "They're quite fond of you, aren't they?"

Before I could respond, Walter appeared from the direction of the children's wing. "Miss Sinclair, I apologize - the children are just finishing their piano lessons. They'll be out shortly." He glanced between Rachel and me.

"That's fine," I said, deliberately keeping my tone light. "I can wait."

Rachel moved away from the window. "Actually, this is perfect timing. I've been hoping to have a word with you, Serena - if I may call you Serena?"

"Of course," I replied, wondering what game was about to unfold in this sunlit living room. "What would you like to discuss?"

The final notes of Chopin's Nocturne faded down the hallway. Then, a rapid pattern of footsteps broke through the tension. "Mommy!" Milo's voice rang out, pure joy and excitement. He burst into the room like a whirlwind, dark hair tousled, his piano lesson completely forgotten. Before I could brace myself, he launched himself into my arms.

"Hey, sweetheart," I whispered, wrapping my arms around him tightly. His familiar weight against my chest made my throat constrict. Had he grown taller in these few weeks?

Stella appeared in the doorway, her movements deliberately measured - so like her father it made my heart ache. She stood watching us, her gray eyes taking in every detail of the scene.

"You missed my art exhibition last week," she said quietly, her voice carrying across the room. The simple statement hit harder than any accusation could have.

I swallowed hard, keeping my voice steady. "I'd love to see your paintings, Stella."

She studied me for a moment longer, then slowly crossed the room to join us. Each step seemed carefully considered, her expression thoughtful beyond her years. When she finally stood before me, the corner of her mouth lifted in a slight smile that made her look startlingly like her father.

"Will you stay this time?" The question was soft but direct.

From the window, Rachel's voice cut through the moment. "They talk about you all the time, Serena." Her tone was pleasant, almost too pleasant. "It's quite touching, really."

I felt Stella shift closer to my side, a subtle but clear statement of allegiance. Milo, still clinging to me, lifted his head. "Daddy wouldn't tell us where you were! Even when Stella asked!"

"I've been very busy," I said carefully, running a hand through his hair. The excuse sounded hollow even to my own ears.

"Children need stability," Rachel observed, her smile never wavering. "It's so important at their age."

Before I could respond, Milo's grip on me tightened. "I want to go with Mommy!" he declared, the words bursting out like he couldn't contain them anymore.

"Me too." Stella's voice was quieter but no less determined. She slipped her hand into mine, her small fingers cool against my palm.

Rachel's perfect smile flickered for just a moment. "Now, children, I thought we could all have dinner together. I've made arrangements at -"

"No!" Milo's rejection was immediate and fierce. "We want to go with Mommy!"

The sound of the elevator doors sliding open cut through the tension. Footsteps in the hallway, familiar ones that made my pulse quicken despite myself. 

Then Lucas was there, filling the doorway with his presence, his gray eyes taking in the scene before him.
###chapter 137
Serena's POV

Lucas stood in the doorway, his presence changing the dynamics of the room instantly. I kept my expression neutral, acknowledging him with the kind of glance you'd give a casual acquaintance.

"Daddy!" Milo's voice broke through the tension. His eyes darted between Lucas and me, practically vibrating with hope. "Can I go to Mommy's place? Please?"

Stella, still standing close to me, reached out to tug gently at her father's sleeve. "Daddy..." Her soft voice carried a quiet determination. "I want to go too."

I watched Lucas's throat work as he swallowed, his eyes moving from the children to me, then deliberately away.

"Alright," he said finally, his voice low and controlled.

Milo's face lit up instantly. "Mommy, Daddy said yes! We can go to your place!"

"Thank you," I said to Lucas, my tone polite and distant. 

Stella's small fingers found mine. "Mommy, can we paint together when we get there?"

Before I could answer, Rachel stepped forward. "Milo, Stella, darling..." Her smile was warm, practiced. "I'm heading back to Philly soon. Could we have dinner together before I leave? As a proper goodbye?"

I felt Stella shift slightly, moving behind me in a subtle retreat. Milo's protective instinct kicked in immediately as he stepped closer to his sister.

"Miss Thorne has made reservations at Le Jardin," Walter added from his position near the hallway, his tone carefully neutral.

"I can bring the children back afterward," I offered, maintaining the veneer of civility. "Just let me know when you've finalized the time."

Rachel's smile brightened. "That would be wonderful! Wouldn't it, kids?"

Stella pressed closer to me, her silence speaking volumes. Milo's usual enthusiasm was notably absent. Lucas remained where he stood, watching the scene unfold with an unreadable expression.

"Well then," Rachel continued, undeterred by the children's lack of response. She moved forward as if to embrace them, but both twins instinctively shifted away. Stella retreated further behind me while Milo straightened his small shoulders, creating a barrier between Rachel and his sister.

The awkward moment hung in the air until I smoothly intervened. "We should get going. It's getting late, and I promised these two some ice cream."

"Ice cream before dinner?" Rachel's laugh tinkled like crystal. "You're spoiling them."

I met her gaze steadily. "Sometimes a little spoiling isn't such a bad thing." 

"Walter, could you help the children get their things?" Lucas spoke for the first time since giving his permission, his voice carrying that familiar quiet authority.

As Walter led the twins to their rooms, I found myself alone with Lucas and Rachel in the sun-drenched living room.

"I'll have Walter coordinate about dinner," Rachel said, her smile never wavering. "The children should have a chance to say goodbye properly."

I nodded, keeping my expression pleasant. "Of course."

The twins returned quickly, each carrying a small backpack. Stella immediately gravitated to my side while Milo bounced on his toes, eager to leave.

"Goodbye, darlings," Rachel stepped forward again, but stopped short when both children moved closer to me. If the rejection bothered her, she didn't show it.

Lucas remained where he was, his stance casual but his eyes intent as they followed his children's movements. Just before we left, Stella turned back to look at her father. 

The sliver Benz glided past us like a phantom ship, making my heart skip a beat despite my best efforts to stay focused on driving. In the rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of Stella, her grey eyes momentarily lifting from her book to track the familiar vehicle. Milo, on the other hand, practically bounced in his seat, pressing his small face against the window.

"Daddy's car!" Milo exclaimed, his excitement palpable in the confined space.

"Milo, please sit properly," Stella's gentle reminder came before I could say anything. "Mommy needs to concentrate on driving."

I smiled at her maturity, though my heart ached a little. At six years old, Stella often seemed more like a miniature adult than a child. "Thank you, sweetheart," I said, carefully navigating through weekend traffic. "How about we do something fun today?"

"Fun like what?" Milo's attention immediately shifted, his eyes sparkling with curiosity.

"Well..." I pretended to think, though I'd already made up my mind. "How about the amusement park?"

The suggestion hung in the air for a moment. Through the mirror, I saw Stella's carefully controlled expression crack slightly, revealing a flash of longing.

"Really?" Milo's voice rose with excitement. "Can we really go?"

"Of course," I assured him, then caught Stella's eye in the mirror. "Unless you're too tired, Stella?"

She shook her head, her blond hair swaying slightly. "I'm not tired," she said softly, then added with characteristic thoughtfulness, "But are you sure you're not too busy, Mommy? We understand if you have work..."

My throat tightened at her words. "Nothing's more important than spending time with you two today."

The parking lot was crowded when we arrived, but I managed to find a spot not too far from the entrance. As I helped Milo with his seatbelt, Stella was already organizing their small backpack, making sure they had everything they might need.

"Have you been here before?" I asked casually while we walked toward the entrance, each child holding one of my hands.

"No," Milo answered cheerfully. "Daddy always says we need to focus on our lessons first."

"He's very busy," Stella added quickly, her grip on my hand tightening slightly. "And he wants us to learn important things."

I swallowed hard, keeping my voice light. "Well, having fun is important too. And today, we're going to try everything you want."

The transformation in their expressions that made me feel warm. Milo's face lit up like Christmas morning, while Stella's carefully maintained composure softened into something more childlike.

The amusement park was a riot of color and sound, with carnival music mixing with laughter and excited screams. 

I guided the kids to a charming ice cream parlor near the carousel. Stella chose strawberry with rainbow sprinkles - her usual favorite, while Milo couldn't decide between chocolate and vanilla until I suggested he could have both. As we sat on a nearby bench, Milo's face lit up with each bite of his two-scoop cone, while Stella delicately licked her ice cream, occasionally glancing at me with her beautiful eyes.

Milo's eyes darted everywhere, trying to take in all the attractions at once and Stella's gaze lingering on the carousel.

"Would you like to ride that first?" I asked her gently.

She hesitated, then nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. "Is it... is it okay?"

"Of course it is." I squeezed her hand. "Today is about having fun."

As we waited in line, I watched Stella automatically straighten Milo's collar and smooth his hair. Such a little mother hen, always taking care of her brother. When we finally boarded the carousel, though, something magical happened. As the ride began to move and the music played, Stella's careful mask slipped completely.

A genuine laugh escaped her lips as her horse rose and fell with the motion. Milo, on the horse next to her, was giggling uncontrollably, but I couldn't take my eyes off Stella.

We moved from ride to ride, and I found myself cataloging each new expression on their faces. Milo's uninhibited excitement was a constant, but Stella's moments of childhood delight were like precious gems I wanted to treasure forever.

It wasn't until we were sharing cotton candy - pink for Milo, blue for Stella - that I noticed him. A man in a dark suit, trying very hard to look inconspicuous while maintaining a careful distance. One of Lucas's security team. The knowledge that he was still watching over them, even from a distance, sent an unexpected warmth through my chest.

"Mommy?" Stella's voice pulled me back to the present. She was looking at me with those knowing eyes of hers, a small frown creasing her forehead. "Are you okay?"

"I'm perfect," I assured her, reaching out to wipe a smudge of cotton candy from her cheek. "Just thinking about how lucky I am to be here with you both."

Her smile in response was shy but real. "We're lucky too," she whispered, then added even more quietly, "I wish we could do this every weekend."

"Me too!" Milo chimed in, his face covered in sticky pink sugar. "Can we, Mommy? Please?"

I looked at their hopeful faces and felt something shift in my chest. "We'll do our best," I promised, meaning every word. "Now, who wants to try the Flying Elephants?"

As we climbed higher, the park's lights beginning to twinkle below us, I felt Stella lean against my side. "Thank you, Mommy," she murmured, her voice heavy with approaching sleep.

I wrapped my arm around her, pulling Milo closer on my other side. "Thank you," I whispered back to them. "For letting me be part of your world."
###chapter 138
Serena's POV

After the Flying Elephants, Milo and Stella explored the playground together, my heart swelling with a mix of joy.

"Mommy, look how high Stella can climb!" Milo's excited voice carried across the playground. Stella, already perched near the top of the jungle gym, gave a small, shy wave.

"Be careful, you two," I called out, though I knew Stella would keep them both safe.

The playground was alive with the energy of weekend families, but I found myself focused entirely on my two. Stella helped Milo navigate the monkey bars, her small hands ready to catch him if he slipped. The sight made my throat tight with emotion.

"Would you like to try the paddle boats next?" I suggested, pointing to the small lake where colorful boats bobbed gently on the water.

"Yes!" they chorused, their synchronized enthusiasm making me smile.

The lake was a mirror of blue sky and scattered clouds, disturbed only by the gentle ripples from our boat. Stella and Milo sat side by side at the front, their legs too short to reach the pedals, while I did the paddling.

"Look, look!" Stella suddenly pointed at the water, her usual composure breaking into childlike wonder. "There are fish!"

"So many!" Milo pressed closer to the edge, making the boat rock slightly. "They're like little silver stars!"

I was about to respond when my phone buzzed in my pocket. The notification made my heart skip: "Rachel Thorne would like to connect with you." My finger hovered over the screen, but Milo's delighted giggle pulled me back to the moment. The phone went back into my pocket.

"Can we go closer to the fish, Mommy?" Milo asked, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

"Of course, sweetheart." I steered us gently toward the cluster of tiny fish, watching as both children leaned over to get a better look, Stella's hand automatically reaching out to steady Milo.

We spent the next hour trying different attractions and walked toward the Ferris Wheel. The sun was starting to set when I heard a familiar voice behind us.

"Serena?"

My body tensed before my mind could even process the voice. Rachel Thorne and Lucas stood a few feet away, elegant as ever in her casual wear, looking somewhat out of place among the cotton candy and balloon vendors.

"Rachel," I managed to keep my voice steady. "What a surprise."

Her gaze drifted from me to the children, lingering just a moment too long. "Indeed," she said softly. "I was just passing by." She paused, then added with a practiced smile, "With Lucas."

I noticed Lucas then, standing slightly behind her, his expression carefully neutral. Before I could respond, Stella, who had been playing chase with Milo, darted back to my side and slipped her small hand into mine. The gesture wasn't lost on Rachel - I saw the slight tightening around her eyes.

"Daddy!" Milo called out, but stayed close to my side instead of running to him.

"Having fun?" Lucas asked softly, his eyes taking in both children's slightly disheveled appearance.

Before either child could answer, Rachel stepped forward with a bright smile. "Well, what a nice surprise!" Rachel greeted Milo with a smile.

"Um-hm" Milo's response was noticeably cold.

The tension in the air thickened. Rachel's hand dropped to her side, her smile becoming more brittle. "You're still so cold, just like your father," she said to Milo, trying to lighten the mood. "No girl will ever like you if you keep that up."

"I don't need girls to like me," Milo replied instantly. "I have Mommy, and that's enough."

"That's right," Stella chimed in, looking up at me with those searching eyes of hers. "We have the best mommy in the world."

I felt my throat tighten at their words, at the fierce loyalty in their voices. The line for the Ferris wheel moved forward, and we shuffled along with it. Rachel seemed determined to salvage the situation.

"Why don't we all ride together?" she suggested brightly. "The cars can fit eight, and it would be lovely to catch up."

I felt both children tense. "Oh, I wouldn't want to intrude on your date," I replied smoothly. "Besides, with the press around..." I gestured vaguely to where I'd spotted a few photographers earlier.

"I'm scared of heights," Stella suddenly announced, her voice small but clear. "I want to sit with Mommy."

I caught Lucas's slight smile at his daughter's declaration - we both knew she had climbed to the top of the jungle gym without hesitation earlier.

"Of course," Lucas said smoothly. "We'll take the next car."

"But I want to sit with Mommy too!" Milo quickly added, not to be outdone.

"Then it's settled," I said, grateful for their intervention. "We'll see you both later."

When our turn came, I helped the twins into the car, acutely aware of Rachel's eyes on us. 

The car swayed gently as it climbed higher, the fairground lights beginning to twinkle below us in the deepening dusk. Stella's hand remained firmly in mine, her head eventually coming to rest against my arm.

"Mommy?" Stella's voice was hesitant.

"Yes, sweetheart?"

"I made something for you today." She reached into her small backpack and pulled out a carefully folded paper. "It's not very good, but..."

"I helped too!" Milo chimed in proudly.

I carefully unfolded the paper to find a crayon drawing of four figures holding hands: two tall ones and two small ones, standing beneath what appeared to be a rainbow. The details were precise - clearly Stella's work - while the abundant use of bright colors suggested Milo's contribution.

"It's beautiful," I whispered, feeling my eyes grow damp. "Is this us?"

Stella nodded, watching my face carefully. "Do you really like it?"

"I love it," I pulled them both closer. "I'm going to put it somewhere special as soon as we get home."

"Really?" The hope in her voice was almost painful to hear.

"Really." I kissed the top of her head, then Milo's. "Thank you both."

As our car reached its apex, I could see Rachel and Lucas in the car behind us, their figures small but distinct. Rachel was talking, her hands moving animatedly, while Lucas seemed to be looking up at our car.

But here in our little bubble, with Stella's drawing in my lap and both children warm against my sides, those complications seemed distant and unimportant.
###chapter 139
Serena's POV

Milo pressed his face against the glass, his excitement barely contained, while Stella sat quietly beside me, her small hand tucked in mine.

"Look, Mommy! We can see the whole city from here!" Milo exclaimed, his breath fogging up the glass. His enthusiasm reminded me of another little girl who once pressed her face against this same window, marveling at the lights below with her mother.

I felt Stella's grip tighten slightly. When I looked down, her grey eyes were studying my face with that uncanny perception of hers. "Mommy, your eyes are getting red," she said softly, reaching into her little packbag for a handkerchief.

"It's because Mommy's too happy," I managed, pulling both of them closer. "Having two such wonderful children makes me the luckiest person in the world."

"We'll always protect Mommy!" Milo declared, temporarily abandoning his window vigil to wrap his arms around mine. Stella nodded in agreement, though I caught a shadow of worry cross her delicate features.

"Mommy," she began hesitantly, "do you know that Godmother comes to see Daddy a lot when we're abroad?" The sudden shift in topic caught me off guard. Before I could respond, Milo jumped in eagerly.

"Yeah! But Daddy's always super cold to her. Not like how he looks at you-" He was cut off by Stella's gentle but firm squeeze of his hand, her eyes warning him not to continue.

"I know what Rachel was trying to do," Stella said, her voice quiet but clear. "She always does that - tries to make it seem like she's our mother. But she's not. You are."

I felt my heart catch in my throat. "Stella..."

"It's true," Milo turned from the window, his expression serious. "She visits sometimes and brings presents and tries to hug us, but it doesn't feel right. Not like with you."

I shook my head slightly, more at the complexities of adult relationships than at their observations. "Some things are for grown-ups to figure out," I said carefully, running my fingers through Milo's hair. "What matters is that I love you both very much, and that will never change."

"We know," Stella whispered, leaning her head against my shoulder. "You're the best mommy in the world." The simple statement, delivered with such conviction, brought fresh tears to my eyes.

The cabin reached its apex, suspended between earth and sky. In this moment, with one child curled trustingly against each side, I felt both incredibly strong and achingly vulnerable.

"Do you want to take a picture?" I suggested, trying to lighten the mood. Both children immediately brightened, though in their distinct ways - Milo with an enthusiastic "Yes!" and Stella with a gentle smile as she helped smooth my hair.

As I held up my phone, I caught our reflection in the glass - the three of us framed against the glittering cityscape. Stella was discretely wiping away the last trace of my tears while Milo threw up an exuberant peace sign. The photo captured everything about us: Milo's boundless energy, Stella's quiet devotion, and my own complex mixture of joy and melancholy.

"Perfect!" Milo declared, examining the result. "Can we send it to Daddy?"

Stella's hand found mine again, her grip communicating support. "Maybe we should keep this one just for us," she suggested diplomatically. "It's our special moment."

The cabin began its descent, bringing us back to earth and reality. 

"Where should we go next?" I asked as the lights of the carnival grew closer. "We still have time for another ride or some games."

"Can we try the claw machine?" Milo bounced in his seat. "I saw a huge teddy bear earlier!"

"You already have three," Stella reminded him, though her tone was more amused than chiding.

"But this one's different! It's wearing a bowtie!" His earnest explanation made both Stella and me laugh.



Rachel's POV

At the Ferris wheel capsule, I studied Lucas's reflection in the glass. The setting sun painted golden stripes across his sharp profile, highlighting that familiar jawline I'd traced countless times in my dreams. He stood perfectly still, maintaining a careful distance between us in the enclosed space.

"Manhattan's grown so impressive," I said, keeping my voice light and nostalgic. "Remember when grandfather used to bring me to visit? The skyline wasn't nearly this magnificent back then."

"Mm." Lucas's response was barely audible, his gaze fixed on some distant point beyond the glass.

I fought the urge to clench my fists, maintaining the serene smile. The capsule continued its slow ascent, each second of silence between us stretching longer than the last. 

"The Harrington's new building really stands out," I tried again, gesturing toward the sleek tower that now dominated the downtown vista. "The architectural design is quite bold."

Lucas responded with a slight nod, still refusing to meet my eyes. The motion sent a sharp pain through my chest. 

The memories of our shared past threatened to overwhelm me. How different would things be if I'd chosen to stay instead of chasing my ambitions abroad? The question that had haunted me for years felt especially bitter now, trapped in this glass box with his indifference.

I'd always assumed Lucas would wait for me. The thought of another woman claiming what I'd foolishly taken for granted made my nails dig into my palms.

"The city's changed," I said softly, letting a calculated note of vulnerability enter my voice. "Sometimes I barely recognize it anymore."

The past Rachel might have waited for him to come to her, secure in her position. But that Rachel hadn't noticed the subtle shifts in the social landscape during her absence - hadn't anticipated someone like Serena Sinclair slipping into the spaces she'd left vacant.

Grandfather would be easy enough to convince about the marriage arrangement. He'd always had a soft spot for Lucas, seeing him as the perfect match to stabilize the Thorne family's position. The tricky part would be playing this right - appearing reluctant enough about the arrangement that Lucas wouldn't suspect my hand in it.

"Your grandpa and mine, they were really good friends," I mentioned casually, watching his reflection for any reaction. "It was nice to see them catching up. Almost felt like old times."

Lucas shifted slightly, his shoulders tensing almost imperceptibly. "The past is the past, Rachel."

The words were cold, but at least he was speaking. "Of course," I agreed smoothly, allowing a hint of resignation to color my tone. "We've all grown up, haven't we?"

He didn't respond this time and the suffocating slince began again.

As we stepped away from the Ferris wheel, Lucas's attention had already shifted, his gaze drawn to something - someone - in the distance. I followed his line of sight, my heart clenching when I spotted Serena kneeling to adjust Milo's jacket while Stella waited patiently beside them.

"I added Serena on social media," I said, watching Lucas's face carefully. For the first time since our awkward Ferris wheel ride, his expression shifted - the barest flicker of interest breaking through his careful mask of indifference.

"Should I explain our relationship to her?" I kept my voice light, casual. "Clear up any... misunderstandings?"

"No need." His response was immediate and firm.

"She seems to have misunderstood quite a bit." I persisted, my fingers unconsciously finding the pendant at my throat. "About our history -"

"Then you should stay away from this." Lucas finally turned to look at me, his grey eyes holding a warning I couldn't ignore. "Rachel, don't complicate things."

"I see... I wasn't thinking clearly." I forced a smile. Graceful surrender on the surface, while my mind raced with alternative strategies.

The carnival continued its relentless cheer around us. A child's laughter pierced the air, and I watched as Milo's excitement drew an genuine smile from Serena. It was the kind of natural interaction I'd never quite managed with him, despite years of trying.

I had to admit, even without makeup, Serena possessed the kind of beauty that turned heads. But Lucas wasn't shallow - I knew him better than that. What drew him to her went deeper than appearance, and that realization scared me more than anything else.

The arrangements were already in motion - a marriage alliance between our families that had been "years in the making." The story was perfect: childhood friends, families with strong business ties, a union that made sense on paper.

"Rachel." Lucas's voice pulled me from my thoughts. "Whatever you're planning - don't."

I met his gaze steadily. "I'm not planning anything, Lucas. I just care about you."

He shook his head slightly, and I saw something like pity cross his face.
###chapter 140
Serena's POV

It was already 10:30 PM when I brought Milo and Stella home.

We'd ordered takeout on the way, and started eating as soon as we got in. Stella, ever so thoughtful, volunteered to help clean up the dishes and even carefully wiped her brother's mouth. Watching her take care of Milo made my heart warm in an inexplicable way.
Remembering Rachel's earlier request about having dinner with the kids before leaving, I picked up my phone and texted her:
"It's getting too late tonight. You can pick up the kids tomorrow."
A moment later, Rachel replied: "Okay, thank you for taking care of them."
After a short rest, I took them for their baths. Stella insisted on bathing herself, but still let me blow-dry her hair. As I stood there drying her blond locks, I caught our reflection in the mirror. Those deep gray eyes of hers, so similar to Lucas's, made my heart sank.

While Milo was already fast asleep, I heard soft footsteps in the hallway. Stella stood in the doorway of her room, clutching her sketchbook.

"Can't sleep?" I asked quietly, careful not to wake her brother.

She shook her head, her long dark hair swaying. "I want to finish my drawing first." 

"Just a few minutes then," I smiled, following her to guest room. I sat on the edge of her bed while she settled at her small desk, the lamp casting a warm glow over her workspace.

"What are you drawing tonight?"

"It's us," she said softly, her pencil moving confidently across the paper. "The picnic. See?" She held up the sketch - a remarkably detailed drawing of our impromptu picnic, complete with Milo chasing butterflies and Lucas spreading out the blanket.

"That's beautiful, sweetheart." I moved closer to examine the drawing. "You captured everyone perfectly."

Stella beamed at the praise, then hesitated. "I drew you sitting next to Daddy," she explained, pointing to the figure. "Is that okay?"

My heart melted at her uncertain expression. I gently squeezed her shoulder. "I love being in your drawings."

"Good." She carefully added final touches to the sketch. "Because I want to hang this one on the wall too."

After she finished, I helped her get ready for bed, brushing her hair as she told me about her dance class and how she'd helped her teacher organize the costumes for their upcoming recital.

"Will you come watch me dance?" she asked as I tucked her in, her voice carrying that vulnerable note that reminded me she was still just a little girl despite her mature demeanor.

"I wouldn't miss it for anything," I promised, smoothing her covers.

"Pinky swear?" She held out her small finger, suddenly looking very much like her twin brother.

"Pinky swear." I linked my finger with hers, then leaned down to kiss her forehead. "Sweet dreams, princess."

"Goodnight, Mommy," she whispered, already drifting off.

Despite my exhaustion, sleep eluded me. I found myself watching the two children beside me. Milo slept soundly, his cheeks flushed pink, lips slightly pursed in that adorable way of his. Stella lay on her side, one small hand protectively stretched toward her brother, her long lashes casting faint shadows in the moonlight. She looked like a little angel at rest.

I felt my eyes growing misty. These children... when had they snuck their way so deeply into my heart?

My phone vibrated in my pocket, breaking the spell. I quickly stepped out onto the balcony, sliding the door closed behind me to avoid disturbing them. When I saw the name, my stomach clenched. Beatrice Sinclair.

For a moment, I considered letting it go to voicemail. But some masochistic part of me, or perhaps that last stubborn thread of hope, made me answer.

"Hello, Grandmother."

"Have you heard about Lucas and Rachel Thorne?" Her voice crackled through the speaker, sharp with barely concealed glee. "They're getting married. What do you have to say about that?"

I kept my voice carefully neutral. "What would you like me to say?"

"Don't play coy with me, girl." She scoffed. "I warned you Lucas Harrington was out of your league. Now look at yourself - playing nanny to his child while he proposes to Rachel. How embarrassing."

My fingers tightened around the phone. "Is there anything else?"

"That attitude! This is exactly why you'll never measure up to the Sinclair name. Lawrence allowed you to take over StarRiver was a mistake. You're just like your mother - "

"Don't you dare speak of my mother, you're not worthy," I cut her off.
###chapter 141
Serena's POV

"Do you know his position at Harrington International?" Beatrice's voice rose sharply through the phone. "Senior executive, million-dollar salary! Now he's suddenly fired?"

I gripped the balcony railing, the cool metal grounding me as lights twinkled below. "If he's such a high-level executive," I replied evenly, "how could I possibly have the power to get him fired?"

"Don't play innocent with me!" She scoffed. "James has a good connection with the Sinclairs for years. He wouldn't have lost his position without your interference."

"Interesting." I kept my voice deliberately calm. "So you believe a senior executive at Harrington International lost his job because of me, rather than his own actions?"

There was a moment of silence on the other end. When Beatrice spoke again, her tone had shifted, honey replacing vinegar. "Serena, dear... I spoke harshly because I was worried. You understand, don't you? James has a family to support."

I closed my eyes, remembering countless similar conversations over the years. The pattern was always the same - criticism, then guilt, then manipulation. "His family situation is unfortunate, but it has nothing to do with me."

"How can you be so cold?" Her voice softened further, dripping with false concern. "You wouldn't want your grandmother to lose face in front of the whole family, would you? After everything we've done for you..."

"Everything you've done for me?" I laughed, the sound brittle in the night air. "Let's talk about that, shall we? For someone who only remembers me when they need something, who beat and berated me as a child, you certainly ask for a lot of favors."

"How dare you!" Beatrice's facade cracked. "The Sinclairs raised such an ungrateful child! Your father gave you everything-"

"The Sinclairs didn't raise me at all," I cut in, my voice trembling slightly. "If not for my own abilities, I would have starved abroad long ago. Or have you forgotten how you shipped me off to boarding school the moment my mother died?"

The words hung in the air, years of unspoken truth finally finding voice. I could hear Beatrice's sharp intake of breath.

"You're just like your mother," she spat. "Always playing the victim, never considering family loyalty-"

"Family loyalty?" My laugh held no humor. "Is that what you call it? Using people until they're no longer useful, then discarding them? No wonder you're so concerned about James. You see yourself in him."

"You little brat-"

I ended the call, my hand shaking slightly. The cool night air did little to calm the burning in my chest. Before I could collect myself, my phone buzzed again. Lawrence Sinclair.

"Yes?" I answered, knowing what was coming.

"Is this how you treat your grandmother?" My father's voice thundered through the speaker. "After everything this family has done for you?"

"I won't accept her insults or your criticism." I kept my voice low, conscious of Milo sleeping inside. "If that's all - "

"James Chapman lost his position because of you!" He cut in. "Your grandmother just told me - "

"That was his own doing," I interrupted. "The board's decision had nothing to do with me."

"He has a good connection with the Sinclairs for years! You could have protected him."

I laughed softly, without humor. "The way you protected me, Father?"

A sharp intake of breath. "You jerk - "

"Bye, Lawrence" I ended the call and blocked both numbers before they could call again. I take a deep breath. The emotional waves still hit me, no matter how I try to steel myself. 

The wounds from family-they cut the deepest. These deeply rooted shadows... I wonder how long it will take before I can truly make peace with everything. It's like that scar from when I was eighteen, still raw in its own way.

Inside, I could hear Milo and Stella's soft snores through the partially open door, the sound somehow both comforting and painful.

My phone buzzed with notifications - probably Nina or Lawrence, eager to add their own criticism to the mix. Instead of checking their messages, I found myself scrolling through my social media feed, a mindless activity to calm my nerves.

Then I saw it.

Rachel Thorne's latest post catches my eye: "Manhattan is beautiful. I love everything about this place."

Below is a photo taken from the top of a Ferris wheel. Most of the frame captures the night cityscape, except for one small detail in the bottom right corner-a man and woman's hands, tightly clasped together.
###chapter 142
Nina's POV

I watched with carefully concealed satisfaction as Grandma paced back and forth. Her face was flushed with anger, hands gesturing wildly as she continued her tirade about Serena's latest transgression.

"That girl! The absolute nerve of her!" Grandma's voice trembled with indignation. "After everything we've done for her, she dares to speak to me like that?"

I gracefully rose from my position on the sofa, approaching Grandma with perfectly practiced concern etched across my features. "Grandma, please don't work yourself up like this." I placed a gentle hand on her arm, my voice soft and understanding. "You know Serena... she's probably just upset about Lucas's engagement news."

Inside, I savored the bitter truth of those words. Lucas Harrington - the one man I couldn't have. The thought of him still made my heart clench with a mixture of desire and resentment. But if I couldn't have him, at least I had the satisfaction of knowing Serena couldn't either.

Grandma scoffed, her perfectly manicured hand dismissively cutting through the air. "Upset? She should know her place! Thinking she could somehow catch Lucas Harrington's attention - it's delusional! That man is practically Manhattan royalty."

"You're right, of course," I murmured soothingly, even as my inner voice whispered that Serena had already caught more of Lucas's attention than I'd ever managed. "She's probably just processing the news poorly. You know how emotional she can be."

The sound of my father's footsteps drew our attention to the doorway. He entered the room, his expression troubled as he loosened his tie. "Nina, sweetheart, do you have a moment?"

"Of course, Daddy." I moved toward him, noting the tension in his shoulders.

He waited until Grandma had huffed her way out of the room before speaking. "The Whitmore situation is worse than we thought. They're asking for another investment round."

I carefully controlled my expression, but my mind was already racing with possibilities. "Ian mentioned something about temporary cash flow issues, but I didn't realize it was this serious."

"Temporary?" Father's laugh was harsh. "They're hemorrhaging money. The board is pushing for an emergency meeting tomorrow." He ran a hand through his silver-streaked hair. "If we don't step in, it could get messy. The press would have a field day with this - both our families' reputations could take a hit."

I settled onto the arm of his favorite chair, my voice thoughtful. "What if... what if there was a way to distance ourselves from the situation naturally?"

"Nina..." His tone carried a warning.

"What if I create a situation where Ian has to break up with me?" I let vulnerability seep into my voice, knowing exactly how to play this moment. "It would give us a clean break from any obligation to help."

Father straightened, concern crossing his features. "A break-up? But Ian would never - not with their situation. He knows they need our support now more than ever."

"Trust me, Daddy." I reached for his hand, squeezing it gently. "I know exactly what I'm doing. Our family won't be affected at all." My lips curved into a soft smile, even as contempt for Ian's weakness curled in my stomach. "Sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good of the family."

I watched understanding dawn in his eyes, followed quickly by pride and gratitude. He pulled me into a tight embrace. "My clever girl. Always thinking of the family first." He pulled back, his expression serious. "You know, even if StarRiver Group is out of reach, you'll always have a place in Sinclair Corp. I'll make sure of it."

"Thank you, Dad." I buried my face against his shoulder to hide my triumphant smile. Pathetic Ian. He actually believed I cared about him, that I'd stand by him through his family's crisis. 

Ian would be easy enough to manipulate into ending things - his pride had always been his weakness. And once that was done, perhaps it was time to turn my attention back to more interesting pursuits. After all, engagement wasn't marriage.


Serena's POV

Milo was deeply engrossed in his new space shuttle model. His small fingers carefully attached each piece while muttering technical terms he'd picked up from somewhere. Across from him, Stella sat at the dining table, her colored pencils spread out in a precise rainbow arrangement as she worked on her drawing.

I leaned against the kitchen counter, savoring this peaceful moment. The twins had been staying with me for the weekend. My phone buzzed with a message, breaking the comfortable silence.

Rachel: "I'll pick up Milo today. Might as well take Stella too."

The carefully casual tone of her text made something twist in my stomach. I glanced at the refrigerator where Stella's latest "the picnic" hung.

"Of course. What time? The kids are in the middle of their projects," I replied, deliberately using the plural.

"Be there in an hour."

I put my phone down and watched the twins for a moment longer. Milo's face scrunched in concentration as he consulted his instruction manual. "The auxiliary boosters need to be aligned perfectly," he announced to no one in particular.

Stella's colored pencil moved in precise strokes across her paper. She'd inherited Lucas's perfectionist streak, each color chosen with careful deliberation.

"Milo, Stella," I said softly, "Your godmother Rachel is coming to pick you up in an hour."

Milo looked up from his model, disappointment clear on his face. "But I haven't finished the propulsion system yet!"

Stella's hand paused mid-stroke, her pencil hovering above the paper. She didn't look up immediately, but I caught the slight tension in her shoulders.

"You can bring it back next weekend to finish," I assured them, keeping my voice light. "We'll have plenty of time then."

Stella finally raised her head meeting mine. Something flickered in them that made my heart ache.

"Of course," she said quietly, beginning to gather her art supplies with methodical precision. Each pencil went back into its designated slot in her case, ordered by color. 

Milo rushed to pack his model, pieces clattering as he tried to fit everything into the box. "Can we work on the landing gear next time?" he asked hopefully.

"Absolutely," I promised, helping him collect scattered parts from under the coffee table. "We can look up some real NASA designs too."

As I straightened up, I noticed Stella standing by the dining table, her art case clutched to her chest. She glanced at the unfinished drawing she'd been working on, then back at me. With quick, decisive movements, she folded the paper and held it out.

"Here," she said softly. "I'll finish it when I come back."

I took the paper, careful not to crease it further. "I'll keep it safe until then."

The doorbell rang precisely an hour after Rachel's text. Stella's hand found mine as we walked to the door.

Rachel stood in the hallway, immaculately dressed as always. Her smile was picture-perfect as she bent down to the twins' level. "There are my favorite people! Stella, honey, I love what you've done with your hair today."

Stella shifted slightly closer to me, her grip tightening. She managed a polite slime. "Thank you, Rachel."

"Milo, sweetheart, did you have fun with your model?" Rachel reached out to ruffle his hair. Her attention swung back to Stella with almost theatrical enthusiasm. "And I heard you've been drawing! You'll have to show me your art sometime."

I felt Stella's subtle flinch. "Maybe next time," she murmured.

As the twins gathered their things, Rachel turned to me with that same perfect smile. "They're such darlings, aren't they? So like their father." Her voice dropped slightly. "You know, things between Lucas and me... they're not what you might think."

I met her gaze steadily, saying nothing. 

Stella appeared at my side, art case secured across her shoulder. Without warning, she wrapped her arms around my waist in a tight hug.

"Bye, Mommy," she whispered against my shirt. "Don't lose my drawing, okay?"

"Never," I promised, returning her hug. Over her head, I caught Rachel's carefully masked flash of annoyance.

I stood in the doorway watching them leave, Milo chattering about his model while Stella walked in silence. Just before they turned the corner, Stella looked back.

Back inside my apartment, I carefully unfolded her drawing and pinned it next to the picnic on the refrigerator.
###chapter 143
Serena's POV

Second morning, I was scrolling through my phone, trying to ignore the trending news that seemed determined to catch my eye: "Lucas Harrington Bids Emotional Farewell to Rachel Thorne at JFK." The photos showed them standing close together near the private aviation terminal, Rachel's hand lingering on Lucas's arm.

"Focus, Serena," I muttered to myself, gathering my portfolio for the morning's brand strategy meeting. The Lumi Nova revelation had created unprecedented opportunities for our luxury fashion line, and I couldn't afford to be distracted by tabloid drama.

The elevator doors opened directly into StarRiver Group's executive floor, where Vincent was waiting with a stack of reports.

"Morning, Miss Sinclair. The team's already assembled in the main conference room."

I nodded, already shifting into business mode. "Perfect. Let's not keep them waiting."

The conference room buzzed with anticipation as I entered. All eyes were on the presentation screen where our latest market analysis was displayed.

"Ladies and gentlemen," I began, setting my portfolio on the table, "our market research indicates that the Lumi Nova revelation has created an unprecedented window of opportunity. But to capitalize on it, we need to move fast."

I clicked through the slides, presenting our strategy with precision. My phone vibrated silently in my pocket - Lucas calling again. I ignored it.

"The luxury segment is primed for disruption," I continued, pushing thoughts of Lucas aside. "With the right funding, we can position StarRiver as the next major player in high-end fashion. I've already lined up meetings with potential investors."

The vibration came again. This time, it was Ian Whitmore. I declined that call too.
The meeting ran longer than expected, and by the time we wrapped up, the sky had darkened with approaching storm clouds. I gathered my things, declining Vincent's offer to be my driver.

"I'll be fine," I assured him. "Go home to your family."

The parking garage was eerily quiet, my heels clicking against concrete the only sound. I fumbled with my keys, an inexplicable unease creeping up my spine. 
A hand clamped over my mouth from behind, rough and unyielding. I tried to scream, but the sound was muffled against my attacker's palm. My mind went blank for a split second before erupting into chaos - every worst-case scenario I'd ever imagined crashed through my thoughts at once.
"Don't move, Miss Sinclair." His voice was cold. "We're going to take a little ride."
I struggled, my bag falling to the ground, contents scattering across the concrete. My heart hammered against my ribs as I tried to remember my self-defense training, but his grip was too strong. 
Panic clawed at my chest, making it hard to breathe. The world seemed to narrow to pinpoints of sensation - the rough hand against my face, the thundering of my pulse in my ears, the sharp smell of him that made my stomach turn. 
"Let her go!" A familiar voice rang out through the garage, followed by rapid footsteps. *It's Ian Whitemore!*

The man spun us around, keeping me pressed against him. I saw Ian Whitmore charging toward us, his usually perfectly styled hair disheveled, his suit jacket already discarded.

What happened next was a blur of violence. Ian tackled the man, forcing him to release me. I stumbled backward, watching in horror as the two men traded brutal blows. *The man is James Chapman. How dare him!*

Blood sprayed across the concrete when Ian's fist connected with Chapman's nose, but Chapman managed to slam Ian into a nearby column.

"Serena, run!" Ian shouted, even as he winced in pain.

Instead, I grabbed my fallen phone and dialed 911 with shaking fingers. Within minutes, the garage was flooded with police officers, their weapons drawn, their commands echoing off the concrete walls.

It was 1 AM when Ian and I stepped out of the police station. The streets were unusually quiet, with only the occasional taxi breaking the silence. The air bit through my thin blazer, and I couldn't suppress a shiver.

Ian immediately started to remove his suit jacket. "Here, take-"

"Don't," I cut him off, wrapping my arms tighter around myself. The last thing I needed was to wear his jacket, to smell his familiar cologne. "I'm fine."

He lowered his arms slowly, wincing at the movement. In the harsh streetlight, I could see the bruises beginning to form on his face, the dried blood still crusted at the corner of his mouth. The sight made something twist in my chest - not quite guilt, not quite concern, but something uncomfortably in between.

"You need medical attention," I said, keeping my voice professionally neutral. "I'll drive you to the ER."

"Serena-"

"My car's just around the corner." I started walking, not waiting to see if he'd follow.

Inside my Mercedes, the silence felt heavier. I turned the heat up and pulled away from the curb.

"About what happened back then," he began, his voice low. "I need to apo-"

"Don't." The word came out sharper than I'd intended. I softened my tone slightly. "The past is the past. Let's focus on the present."

He shifted in his seat, and I could feel him studying my profile. "That's actually why I've been trying to reach you. Whitmore Enterprises needs-"

"A partnership with StarRiver," I finished for him, the pieces clicking into place. Of course. This wasn't about the past at all - it was about business. "That's why you've been calling."

"It's not just that." He ran a hand through his disheveled hair, a gesture so familiar it made my chest ache. "The market's changing, and Whitmore's facing some challenges. Your success with the Lumi Nova revelation... we could help each other, Serena."

I navigated through the empty streets, taking the turn toward St. Luke's Hospital. "You know why that's not possible."

"We could keep it strictly professional. The terms would be extremely favorable-"

"I worked at Whitmore for two years, Ian." My knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "Your management system isn't mature - it's outdated and conservative. Your marketing strategies are at least five years behind current trends. And that's not even addressing the issues with your design department."

"We can change. With your influence-"

"Ian." I pulled into the hospital's parking lot, killing the engine. The sudden silence felt like a physical presence. "If you really knew me at all, you'd understand that this isn't possible. Our relationship - personal and professional - ended the moment we broke up. You made your choice then. I've made mine now."

He was quiet for a long moment, then said softly, "I didn't choose Nina because I wanted to."

"Don't." My voice shook slightly. "Don't you dare make excuses. Not now. Not after everything."

We sat in silence until a security guard tapped on the window, pointing at the "Emergency Vehicles Only" sign. I started the car again, moving to the regular parking area.

The ER was surprisingly quiet for a midnight. I waited while they cleaned Ian's cuts and checked for concussion, maintaining a careful distance. The lights made everything look harsh and unreal, turning Ian's bruises into abstract watercolors across his skin.

Finally, the doctor cleared him to leave, though she recommended observation for the next 24 hours. We walked to the hospital entrance together, our footsteps echoing in the empty corridor.

"Thank you," Ian said as we reached the doors. "For everything tonight."

"Take care of yourself, Serena." He touched my shoulder briefly, then turned away.

I watched him walk away to wait Uber. When I turned to head back to my car, I froze.

Lucas Harrington was standing by the emergency entrance.
###chapter 144
Ian's POV

Lucas Harrington stood by the emergency entrance. The sight of him sent a jolt of shock through my system. The tabloids had been full of their intimate farewell just hours ago.

She faltered for just a moment, almost imperceptible unless you knew her as well as I once had.

The space between them crackled with tension. Neither moved, neither spoke, yet the air itself seemed to shift with unspoken words.

"Are you done?" Lucas's voice was low, controlled, carrying easily across the quiet parking lot. The casual possessiveness in his tone made my fists clench.

"Yes." One word from Serena.

"Let's go." Not a request, but a command, and to my disbelief, Serena didn't bristle at it. The Serena I knew would have cut anyone down to size for presuming to order her around. This Serena simply moved toward him.
I watched as Lucas and Serena walked past me, completely ignoring my presence. Their quiet confidence was maddening - neither showed any sign of being affected by external pressures. Serena didn't recoil from Lucas despite his engagement to another woman. And Lucas... he didn't display even a hint of jealousy about Serena's history with me.
It was as if they shared an unspoken trust, their connection immune to the chaos around them. The way they moved together, so in sync, so assured...
They treated me like I was nothing but air.
My fists clenched involuntarily at my sides. How could Serena - proud, dignified Serena Sinclair - willingly step into the role of "the other woman" with Lucas Harrington? The thought of it made rage build in my chest until I could barely breathe.
The irony was suffocating. Serena, who had always carried herself with such superiority, was now ready to become exactly what she'd once despised.
They disappeared around the corner, leaving me alone in the harsh hospital lights.

My phone rang just as Lucas's Bentley disappeared into the night. Nina's ringtone - pierced the cold air. I let it ring twice, three times, composing my thoughts before answering.

"Ian, darling!" Nina's voice dripped honey and concern. "I've been so worried. Why haven't you called?"

I leaned against the cold brick wall of the hospital, my ribs protesting the movement. "I was just about to call you."

"Were you?" The doubt in her voice was carefully measured. "It's past three AM, Ian. I've been waiting up all night." A delicate sniffle. "After everything I did yesterday, crying in front of Daddy, begging him to consider helping Whitmore..."

Last night, Nina called me in tears. Her sobs were uncontrollable as she explained how she'd failed to convince her father to invest in our company. She'd gotten into a huge argument with him, and coupled with her worries about Whitmore Enterprises' crisis, she completely broke down.

I was already on edge, the mess at Whitmore weighing heavily on me. Every day felt like walking through a minefield, and Nina's tears only amplified my frustration. I snapped at her twice, my voice harsher than intended. But instead of getting angry, she just apologized more, blaming herself. Then she mentioned something interesting - Serena could be the key to saving Whitmore Enterprises.

Through her tears, Nina explained that StarRiver was planning collaboration deals with other luxury brands. Given Serena's current popularity and media presence, any partnership with StarRiver would be incredibly profitable. If I could secure this project, it might be enough to pull Whitmore back from the brink.

I know Serena too well - she'd never help Whitmore now. But Nina kept encouraging me, insisting we had nothing to lose at this point. She mentioned that James Chapman had issues with Serena, and knowing his vindictive nature, he might try to cause problems for her. Nina suggested I could use that situation to play the hero, possibly softening Serena's stance toward me.

Nina pointed out that Serena was particularly vulnerable right now, having been apparently abandoned by Lucas Harrington. She believed that if I made the right moves, Serena might set aside our past differences. Nina explicitly told me not to worry about her feelings - saving Whitmore had to come first.

*"Our love is unshakeable," she assured me. "Like a rock."*

Her devotion moved me deeply. In that moment, I felt incredibly fortunate to have someone who loved me so completely, who would put aside her own feelings for my family's sake.

"Did you see Serena?" she pressed when I didn't respond. "How did it go?"

The image of Serena walking away with Lucas flashed through my mind. "Not as planned."

"Oh, darling." Another carefully calculated pause. "You know she's vulnerable right now, especially with all this Lucas and Rachel drama. The timing couldn't be better for us."

"Serena's not as vulnerable as you think."

"But she must be! I mean, Lucas practically flaunted Rachel at JFK. Every gossip site has the pictures." Nina's voice took on that excited edge it always got when discussing her sister's potential misery. "Serena hates public humiliation more than anything. Remember how she reacted when news of our engagement broke?"

I did remember. The ice in Serena's eyes when she'd thrown her ring at me. The way her voice never wavered as she told me exactly what she thought of my family loyalty.

"The StarRiver bidding process starts this week," I said, steering the conversation away from dangerous waters. "We're running out of time."

"Isn't there any way," Nina's voice cracked with desperation, "to force my sister into cooperating with Whitmore?"

"I can't threaten her anymore..." I stopped mid-sentence, a thought suddenly crystallizing in my mind.

*Force Serena to cooperate with Whitmore?*

A shiver ran through me as a malicious idea took shape, darkness flickering behind my eyes. I thought of James Chapman, of the fear in Serena's eyes when he grabbed her.

"Nina." I made my voice soft, indulgent. "You'll be the only Mrs. Whitmore. I promise."

"I know, darling." She practically purred. "I'll always wait for you. No matter what it takes."
###chapter 145
Serena's POV

I handed Lucas my car keys. His fingers lingered for a fraction of a second longer than necessary. I watched as he circled around to the driver's side, his movements precise and deliberate.

I slid into the passenger seat, though my mind was already racing ahead to my 8:30 AM meeting. The StarRiver Group's latest procurement bid couldn't afford any mistakes.

The engine purred to life, and we pulled away from the hospital in silence. The streets were eerily empty at this hour, the usual cacophony of horns and sirens replaced by the soft whir of tires on asphalt.

I glanced at the dashboard clock: 3:52 AM. My fingers unconsciously drummed against my thigh as I calculated the remaining hours until my alarm would sound. Three hours and eighteen minutes, assuming we wrapped this up quickly.

"Lucas," I finally broke the silence, my voice sounding unexpectedly loud in the confined space. "Whatever you need to say, you can say it now."

He remained focused on the road ahead, his gray eyes reflecting the passing streetlights. His hands gripped the steering wheel slightly tighter. But still, no response.

"I have an important meeting first thing tomorrow morning," I tried again, unable to completely mask the edge of frustration in my voice. The digital numbers on the dashboard seemed to mock me as they ticked forward another minute.

"I know," he replied, his deep voice carrying that characteristic calm that usually steadied me but now only served to heighten my agitation. Two words, then back to silence.

I watched his profile in the alternating patterns of light and shadow as we wound through the sleeping city. The strong line of his jaw was set in that particular way that meant he was working through something in his methodical fashion. Under different circumstances, I might have found it endearing. Right now, it was maddening.

The familiar entrance to Tribeca Towers' underground parking appeared ahead, Lucas smoothly guided the car down the ramp. 

He pulled into my spot, the engine's quiet rumble echoing slightly in the enclosed space before he cut it off. The sudden silence felt heavy, expectant.

I didn't move to get out of the car. Neither did he. The air between us seemed to thicken with unspoken words.

"Say it," I said finally, my voice quiet but firm. I turned to face him fully, taking in the tension in his shoulder.

He finally turned to meet my gaze. His expression held that particular mix of determination and hesitation.

"It's late," he said quietly. "We should get some rest. We can talk tomorrow."

A sharp laugh escaped me before I could stop it. "I don't see why we need to drag this out." I kept my voice steady. "Let's end this cleanly. I'm too busy to deal with ambiguity. I handled things with Ian efficiently enough, didn't I?"

The mention of Ian Whitmore made something flicker in Lucas's eyes.

"The engagement to Rachel..." He paused, his fingers tightening almost imperceptibly on the steering wheel. "I had no idea. Grandfather announced it without my knowledge."

"I know," I cut him off cleanly. "Eleanor told me everything." He didn't seem surprised by the answer. "She told me how Howard made the announcement, how they took your phone, kept you under surveillance."

The low hum of the garage ventilation system filled the silence between us. A car alarm echoed distantly from somewhere above, the sound bouncing off concrete walls before fading away.

"Give me six months," Lucas said finally, his voice carrying that quiet intensity that had once made my heart skip. Now it just made me tired. "I'll handle this."

"And then what?" I turned in my seat to face him fully. "Another surprise engagement? Another family obligation you can't refuse?"

"That won't happen."

"How can you guarantee that?" The words came out sharp, precise. "Howard can strip away your freedom and cut off all your connections in an instant. He's already proven that. How can I trust you'll be able to stand up to him in six months when you couldn't do it today?"

I watched as he absorbed the blow, noting the subtle tightening of his jaw, the way his shoulders tensed.

"Serena." The way he said my name still held that note of intimacy. "I know I'm asking a lot-"

"No," I interrupted. "You're asking for blind faith, and I don't have any left to give. Let's be clear, I don't trust you."

The words fell between us like stones, heavy and final. I saw them land, saw the impact in the slight flinch he couldn't quite suppress.

"I trusted Ian once," I continued, my voice softening slightly despite my best efforts. "I believed in promises and potential and all those pretty words about love conquering all. You know how that ended." I reached for my purse, needing suddenly to be out of this car, away from the weight of his gaze. "I won't make the same mistake twice."

"This isn't the same situation," Lucas said, an edge of frustration finally breaking through his careful control. "I'm not Ian."

"No, you're not," I agreed, my hand finding the door handle. "You're arguably in an even worse position. At least Ian only had to answer to himself. You?" I pushed the door open, letting the garage's cold air rush in. "You have generations of Harrington expectations weighing you down. And I've seen exactly how much those weigh."
###chapter 146
Serena's POV

My hand was already on the door handle when his voice stopped me. The quiet desperation in his tone made something in my chest ache, but I forced myself to stay focused.

"I won't let myself get caught between the Harringtons and the Thornes," I said, keeping my voice steady. "I don't have the power to handle either family. My peaceful life didn't come easily, Lucas. If I have to choose, I'll choose to stay away from you without hesitation."

The silence that followed was deafening. I watched as something flickered in his eyes - disbelief, maybe, or hurt.

"Is what we have really so fragile?" he finally asked, his voice barely above a whisper. The raw emotion in his words made me grip the door handle tighter.

"We barely have anything," I replied, forcing my tone to remain neutral. "If you remember, I only agreed to try dating. Clearly, it wasn't working out."

"I don't believe you." His words came out sharp, cutting through my carefully constructed facade. "I don't believe you feel nothing. Feelings are mutual - I can sense them."

Before I could react, his hand shot out, fingers wrapping around my wrist. The grip wasn't painful, but it was firm enough to make me acutely aware of how much strength he was holding back. His eyes, when they met mine, had a reddish tinge that spoke of exhaustion and something deeper, more volatile.

"I also don't believe you're the type to give in so easily," he continued, his voice growing more intense. "You wouldn't let either family's pressure make you give up without a fight. That's not who you are."

I could feel my pulse racing under his fingers, wondering if he could feel it too. "Lucas," I said softly, "I'm human, not invincible. Even I fear powerful enemies."

His grip tightened slightly, and I suppressed a wince. The pain was almost welcome - it gave me something to focus on besides the storm of emotions I could see building in his eyes.

"You've never backed down from a challenge before," he pressed. "You've faced down board members times your age, turned around failing companies, stood up to your entire family. Why is this different?"

I stayed silent, but something must have shown in my face because suddenly his expression changed. The intensity didn't fade, but it shifted, became more focused. More dangerous.

"What did grandfather say to you?"

The question hung in the air between us. I could feel the moment stretching, taut as a wire about to snap. His fingers were still around my wrist.

"He told me to leave you," I finally admitted. "On my own terms."

Lucas's grip went slack, but I didn't pull away. I watched as understanding dawned in his eyes, followed quickly by anger.

"Why didn't you tell me?"

I let out a small, bitter laugh. "What difference would it have made? Howard has the power to destroy everything I've built at StarRiver. Everything I've worked for. He made that very clear."

"I could have-"

"What?" I interrupted. "Protected me? You couldn't even protect yourself from being locked away and having your phone taken. How could you protect me from Howard's influence?"

The words came out harsher than I intended, but I couldn't take them back now. I watched as they hit home, saw the flash of pain cross his face before he could hide it.

I turned my gaze fixed on some point beyond the windshield, not wanting to see Lucas's reaction.

"You agreed to his terms?" His voice was carefully controlled, but I could hear the tension underneath.

"Yes." The word came out steady, almost casual.

"Did he threaten you?"

A small, bitter smile tugged at my lips. "Not exactly. He just... opened my eyes to reality." I finally turned to look at him, noting the barely contained anger in his expression. "Sometimes the truth is more effective than threats."

"Remember in the Bahamas?" I asked suddenly, the memory rising unbidden. "You promised to grant me one wish." A soft, humorless laugh escaped me. "I asked you not to lie to me. Pretty ironic, isn't it? This whole thing was built on lies."

I watched as Lucas's hands tightened, his knuckles turning white. Something in his expression shifted, a decision being made.

"The man you were with that night when you were eighteen..." he said slowly, each word seeming to cost him. "It was me."

My fist clenched involuntarily in my lap. 

"I was staying on the same floor," he continued, his voice low and controlled. "I saw you with a man outside your room. He was trying to force you inside. I recognized you from Drew's high school photos, so I intervened. Asked him who he was. He couldn't give me a straight answer, so I got you out of there."

Fragments of memory began to surface - the corridor's spinning walls, a stranger's unwanted hands, then different hands, steadier ones. A hotel room that wasn't mine.

"I took you to my room," Lucas said, his eyes fixed straight ahead. "I was planning to leave, but you were feverish, face flushed. And then you..." He paused, seeming to choose his words carefully. "You kissed me. Pulled me onto the bed."

My nails were digging into my palm now, but I barely felt it. The memories were becoming clearer, filling in gaps I'd tried for years to understand.

"I know I should have resisted," he admitted. "But you were..." He stopped, shook his head. "That's no excuse. I should have done better."

"I asked if you hated him," he continued after a moment. "The man from that night. You said yes. I wanted to wait until you were more comfortable with me, until you didn't flinch at my touch anymore. I thought..."

"You thought what?" My voice came out surprisingly calm. "That if I fell for you first, finding out you'd taken advantage of me when I was drugged would hurt less?"

"No!" The vehemence in his voice made me flinch. "I never - it wasn't like that. I was trying to protect you that night."

"By lying to me for months?" The calm was slipping now, anger seeping through. "By watching me struggle with those memories, letting me think..." My voice cracked, and I hated myself for it.

"Serena..."

"Don't." I held up a hand, needing space, needing air. The car suddenly felt impossibly small. "Just... don't."

Memories were flooding back now - the taste of champagne, the room spinning, the feel of hands on my skin. His hands. Lucas's hands. All this time...

"So Howard was right," I said finally, my voice barely above a whisper. "About everything."

"What did he tell you?"

I smiled, though it felt more like a grimace. "That the Harringtons always get what they want. That you'd known me, wanted me, since that night. That this whole relationship was just you finally claiming what you'd marked as yours years ago."

"That's not-"

"Isn't it?" I cut him off. "You kept tabs on me through Drew. You manipulated your way into StarRiver's business dealings. You orchestrated every interaction until you had the perfect opportunity to approach me." Each word felt like glass in my throat, but I couldn't stop. "Was any of it real? Or was I just a conquest you'd been planning for seven years?"

The look on his face - pain, guilt, desperation.

"Serena, please," he reached for me, but I jerked away. "Let me explain."
###chapter 147
Serena's POV

"I tried to find you after that night," his voice rised. "But my parents' accident happened, and suddenly everything..." He trailed off. "Everything changed."

I remained silent. The mention of his parents' accident stirred something in my memory - newspaper headlines.

"Then Milo and Stella were brought home," he continued. "And Howard's control became absolute. Every move I made was monitored. Even that night at the hotel..." He paused, his jaw tightening. "He knew. About everything."

A chill ran down my spine despite the car's warmth. The memory of that hospital room, of the doctor's cold voice pronouncing my baby a stillborn, suddenly felt sharper, more painful.

"The stillbirth story," Lucas's voice had dropped to barely above a whisper. "Howard bribed the doctor. He wanted to keep the baby."

The words hit me like a physical blow. My hands began to shake in my lap, and I clasped them together tightly, trying to control the tremors. The pain of that loss - the grief I'd carried for seven years - suddenly took on a new, horrifying dimension.

"I saw you again in Germany," he continued, seemingly unable to stop now that he'd started. "You were with Ian. Walking together in the sunset. I wanted to approach you, but..." He shook his head. "You looked happy. I didn't have the right."

"So this was revenge?" My voice came out steadier than I felt. "For moving on?"

"No!" The vehemence in his voice made me flinch. "I would never... That's not why."

"Then why?" I demanded, turning to face him fully. "Why be so good to me? We were strangers. I abandoned kids. I hurt you. What reason could you have to care?"

A bitter smile crossed his face. "I knew about you long before that night. Back in high school. Drew talked about you constantly - the star student, the beauty everyone admired."

"High school crushes don't last long years," I said flatly.

"They do when fate keeps bringing you back together." His eyes met mine in the dim light. "The hotel. Germany. Your wedding."

"The shooting at my hotel," he continued. "I saw Ian save Nina, leaving you behind. I couldn't... I couldn't let you..." His hands clenched tighter.
"I don't want to hear any more explanations," I interrupted, my voice cutting through the heavy air of the car. "Whether they're true or not doesn't matter anymore. We ended the day Howard announced your engagement."

The redness rimming his eyes made something in my chest ache, but I pushed the feeling aside. This wasn't the time for weakness.

"You're not even willing to listen?" The quiet desperation in his voice almost made me waver.

I pulled out my phone, my fingers moving with deliberate calm as I pulled up a news article. "Call me selfish, but logic tells me this: You and Rachel grew up together." I gestured to the society page photo of them at a gala, both looking perfectly matched in their elegance. "Your engagement makes perfect sense. As for me..." I forced a small, bitter laugh. "I forced myself on you that night and abandoned your child. This could all be revenge."

"That's not-"

"Maybe it is, maybe it isn't." I put my phone away, each movement carefully controlled. "The truth is, it doesn't matter anymore. What matters is that I've made my decision."

"Maybe my doubts aren't about your capability," I said finally, my voice softening despite my best efforts. "Maybe I just don't love you enough. It's better to end this before we get in too deep."

I watched the words land, saw them sink into him like physical blows. Part of me wanted to take them back, to ease the pain I could see etched across his features. But that would only make things harder in the long run.

"Take the car," I said, reaching for the door handle. "Have Ethan bring it back when convenient."

"Serena." My name on his lips still had the power to make my heart skip, but I couldn't let him see that. "Please don't do this."

I stepped out of the car, my heels clicking against concrete with a finality that echoed through the empty garage.

"You know this isn't the real reason," Lucas called after me, his voice carrying a note of desperation I'd never heard before.

I didn't turn around. "Goodbye, Lucas."
Two hours and fifteen minutes until my alarm. Just enough time to shower, change, and lock away these memories alongside all the others I tried not to think about. 

I leaned against the elevator wall, allowing myself one moment of weakness in the privacy of the small space. One moment to acknowledge the pain in my chest, the trembling in my hands, the tears I refused to let fall.

One moment. That's all I could afford.

BANG!

A loud thud snapped me back to reality.
###chapter 148
Lucas's POV

The click of her heels against the parking garage floor echoed through my mind like gunshots. Each step taking her further away, each second ticking down to what felt like an end I couldn't accept. Serena's silhouette moved  toward the elevator.

I moved before conscious thought could intervene. My legs carried me forward in long, urgent strides, my heart thundering against my ribs. The distance between us collapsed as the elevator doors began to slide shut.

"WAIT." The word tore from my throat, rough and desperate. My arm shot out, catching the closing doors. I collided with the elevator door, the impact producing a deep rumble. The motion sensor forced them back open with a soft mechanical whir.

Serena's eyes met mine, a flash of something - fear? anger? - crossing her features. "Let me go, Lucas."

Instead, I stepped into the elevator, my presence forcing her to retreat into the corner. The doors closed with a quiet finality, sealing us in this private battlefield of emotions. The confined space seemed to amplify every breath, every subtle movement.

My kiss was an act of desperation, anger, and longing all tangled into something brutal. Her small frame collided with the elevator wall as I pressed forward, tasting the salt of her tears mixing with the metallic tang of blood where she'd bitten my lip. The pain barely registered - nothing could compare to the agony of watching her walk away.

I felt her struggling against me, her hands pushing at my chest, but I couldn't stop. Wouldn't stop. Every fiber of my being screamed to make her understand that this wasn't just about desire, that she meant more to me than a single night of passion could ever express.
I felt her fists slowly unclench against my chest, her resistance fading into resignation. The fight drained from her body, replaced by something worse - acceptance. Not the warm, willing acceptance I'd dreamed of, but a numb surrender that made my heart twist.
She simply endured, passive and distant, as if she'd retreated somewhere I couldn't reach. The realization was like ice water in my veins.
Then I tasted salt.
Tears.
Her tears.
The shock of it froze me in place. I pulled back slowly, the sight of her tear-streaked face hit me like a physical blow. Reality crashed in as I stared at her face, really seeing what I'd done for the first time. My body went rigid with horror.
*Dear god. What had I become?*
"I'm sorry, I just..." The words felt inadequate, broken. My fingers trembled slightly as I reached up to brush away her tears, hating myself for causing them.

"It's fine." Her voice was empty, devoid of any emotion, and that emptiness cut deeper than anger ever could.

I watched, frozen in growing horror, as she began methodically unbuttoning her blazer. It fell to the floor with a soft whisper of expensive fabric. Her fingers moved to her white blouse next, each button coming undone with deliberate slowness, revealing the pale blue lace beneath.

"Serena!" I grabbed her hands, halting their movement. My voice was rough with emotion. "Stop."

Her laugh was bitter, cutting. "Wasn't the first time good enough? Is that why you're here? Unfinished business?"

The words hit like shards of glass, each one drawing blood. My vision blurred red with fury - not at her, but at myself, at whatever I'd done to make her think this was all I wanted from her.

"How many times would it take?" she continued, her voice eerily calm. "Tell me a number, Lucas. We can get it out of your system, and then you'll let me go, right?"

"Is that what you think of me?" My voice was barely recognizable, raw with emotion. "That all I want is your body? That I chased you down here, stopped this elevator, because I'm looking for a quick fuck?"

Her eyes met mine, and for a moment, I saw past the cold mask to the hurt beneath. "What else could you want? We both know how this ends, Lucas. The powerful CEO always gets bored eventually. At least this way, we set the terms."

Her words struck like acid, burning through every shred of my control. The accusation that I only wanted her body, that this was just about sex - it ignited a fury I couldn't contain. Before I could stop myself, my fist slammed into the elevator wall beside her head, the impact sending shockwaves of pain up my arm.
I saw her flinch, saw the momentary flash of shock in her eyes. The realization that I'd frightened her - that she might actually believe I could hurt her - made me sick to my stomach.
DING.
The sound cut through the tension like a knife. The doors slid open with a soft mechanical whir.
###chapter 149
Serena's POV

The elevator doors suddenly slid open. I hadn't even pressed a floor button yet - we were still in the parking garage.

Eleanor jumped, startled. Coming back this late was already unnerving enough, and the sudden sound from the elevator must have nearly given her a heart attack.

When she registered the sight of us - a man and a woman - inside the elevator, she froze completely. It wasn't until the elevator chimed impatiently that Eleanor snapped out of her shock.

She quickly withdrew one foot and stammered, "Please, continue. I... I didn't see anything!"

Then the elevator doors closed between us.

Lucas's grip on my arm was unyielding as he pulled me down the hallway from the elevator. Each step sent waves of discomfort through my body, but I refused to show any reaction.

"Let go of me." I kept my voice deliberately cold, emotionless.

He didn't respond. The only sound was our footsteps against the floor and his slightly ragged breathing. I could feel the tremors running through his fingers where they gripped my arm - not from weakness, but from some barely contained emotion.

When we reached my door, he finally spoke. "Get inside." His voice was rough, almost unrecognizable.

I fumbled with my keycard, hyper-aware of his presence behind me. My first thought had been to change the security codes tomorrow, eliminate any possibility of him accessing the apartment again.

The door clicked open. I expected him to follow, to continue whatever this display of dominance was supposed to achieve. Instead, he remained in the hallway, one hand braced against the doorframe.

I turned, confused by this deviation from the script I'd imagined. The overhead lights caught something unexpected in his eyes - a suspicious shimmer that couldn't be, shouldn't be tears. Lucas Harrington didn't cry. He was steel and stone, calculated moves and careful control.

"What are you-" I started to ask, but he cut me off.

"Serena." My name from his lips sounded like it was being torn from somewhere deep inside him. "Don't let go. I really, really want a future with you."

The words hit me with physical force. I'd been so certain that this - whatever this was between us - was shallow. Manageable. Something I could walk away from with my heart intact. I'd convinced myself that his interest was fleeting, that my own feelings were safely contained.

The door closed behind Lucas. In that fleeting moment, I caught something-or thought I caught something-that made my heart stop. 

A tear, tracing down his cheek. 

Or perhaps it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. The possibility of that single tear haunted me more than any words could have.
###chapter 150
Eleanor's POV

I rushed up to Serena's floor. My mind was a jumble of worry for Serena, whom I'd hoped to find and console. But as the doors slid open, I froze mid-step.

There, in the dimly lit hallway, stood my brother. Lucas was leaning against the wall, his head bowed so low I couldn't see his expression. But what I did see made my breath catch - a tear sliding down his cheek, catching the warm light before falling to the floor.

I couldn't move. In all our years growing up together, I'd only seen Lucas cry once - at his parents' funeral. Even then, it had been silent tears quickly brushed away, his composure never truly breaking. But this... this was different.

"Lucas..." I whispered, my voice barely audible in the thick silence of the hallway.

He didn't respond, didn't even acknowledge my presence. Another tear fell.

My mind raced, trying to piece together what could have happened. The news about his rumored engagement to Rachel Thorne had been spreading through Manhattan's social circles like wildfire. Did Serena break up with him? The thought made my chest tight. 

"I thought..." Lucas's voice was rough, barely above a whisper. He didn't finish the sentence. I could hear the pain in those two words.

I'd never seen him invest so much of himself in anyone before Serena. Even his carefully maintained walls seemed to lower around her, revealing glimpses of warmth I'd thought he'd lost years ago.

I took a careful step forward, then another, until I was standing beside him. The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words.

"Want to get a drink?" I finally asked, keeping my voice gentle. "Bemelman should still be open."

The minutes ticked by. Finally, Lucas straightened up, though he kept his face turned away from me.

"...Alright."

We rode the elevator down in silence. 

The night air hit us as we stepped out of the building, bringing with it the distant sounds of traffic and the ever-present energy of the city. Ethan, was already waiting with the car, but my brother shook his head slightly.

"We'll walk," he said, his voice steadier now but still carrying an unfamiliar weight.

Bemelman was quieter than usual at this hour, the usual buzz of Manhattan's elite replaced by soft jazz and the clink of glasses. The maître d' took one look at Lucas's face and led us to a private corner booth without a word. 

I watched with growing concern as Lucas reached for the bottle again, pouring himself another generous measure of whiskey. His usual precise movements had grown slightly less controlled, though his face remained as impassive as ever.

"Maybe you should slow down a bit," I suggested softly. The ice clinked against his glass as he lifted it to his lips, ignoring my words completely.

"Did you and Serena have a fight?" I ventured carefully, watching his reaction. His hand tightened around the glass for a moment, but he offered no response. Just that telling pause in his movements before he took another drink.

The ice in my own untouched martini had long since melted, but I barely noticed. My mind was racing, trying to piece together the puzzle of what had happened.

"Lucas," I started again, my concern finally overwhelming my caution, "what's really going on with you, Serena, and Rachel?"

His response, when it came, was delivered in a voice as cold as the ice in his glass. "I'm not marrying Rachel."

I sat up straighter. "The engagement was publicly announced by both families. This isn't something you can just brush aside - it's about the Harringtons' and the Thornes' reputations!"

"I don't care about reputations," Lucas bit out, his voice carrying an edge.

"But you should!" My voice rose slightly, echoing in the confined space. "This isn't just about what you want. The media's already running with the story. Every society column in Manhattan is talking about the 'merger of the year.' You can't just..."

"I can," he interrupted, his tone final. "And I will."

I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. This wasn't getting us anywhere. "Lucas, think about what this is doing to Serena," I said more gently. "She's already been through so much. The way she grew up, always treated unequally in her own home. And then what Ian did to her..." I trailed off.

Lucas's expression darkened at the mention of Ian's name, his knuckles white around his glass.

"She has no reason to trust you right now," I continued softly. "No matter what you say, no matter how sincere you are. The timing of this engagement announcement... it looks bad, Lucas. Really bad. And with her history..." I shook my head. "You're putting her in an impossible position. If you don't resolve this Rachel situation clearly and publicly, any relationship with Serena will brand her as 'the other woman.' Is that what you want for her?"

My brother remained silent, but I could see my words hitting home in the slight slump of his shoulders, the way his eyes fixed unseeingly on the amber liquid in his glass.

"She's such an incredible woman," I said, more to myself than to Lucas, pouring myself a drink at last. "It seems so cruel, doesn't it? The universe keeps throwing these challenges at her, one after another. First her family situation, then Ian's betrayal, and now this..." I took a sip, feeling the burn of the alcohol. "I'm worried this might be the last straw, you know? That this might be what finally makes her give up on love altogether."

The bottle made a hollow sound as Lucas set it down too hard on the table. "I won't let that happen," he said, his voice rough with emotion and alcohol.

"Then you need to fix this," I replied firmly. "Not just the Rachel situation - though that needs to be handled immediately - but you need to show Serena that she can trust you. That you're different from the others who've hurt her."

Lucas closed his eyes briefly, and in that moment, I saw just how much he was struggling. My confident, controlled brother, who always seemed to have all the answers, looked utterly lost.

"How?" The question was barely audible, but it carried the weight of his vulnerability.

"You start by being honest with her," I said quietly. "Not just about Rachel, but about everything. Your fears, your struggles with the family obligations, all of it."

Lucas's fingers drummed against the bottle, a nervous gesture I'd rarely seen from him. "You don't understand. When I try to explain, I see that wall going up in her eyes. The same wall she built after Ian's betrayal."

"Because she's terrified too," I countered. "You think Serena doesn't know what she's risking? She's already lost everything once. The company, her family's trust, her reputation - all gone because she trusted the wrong person."

His jaw tightened. "I'm not Ian."

"No, you're not," I agreed. "But right now, you're acting exactly like what she fears most - another powerful man putting family obligations and business considerations ahead of her."

"I'm trying to protect her," he said, his voice rough. "If I move too quickly against Rachel, against my grandfather's wishes, it could spark a war between our families. The Thornes wouldn't hesitate to use their influence to destroy everything Serena's rebuilt."

He ran a hand through his hair. "I know that resolving things with Rachel is the key to fixing this with Serena. But it's not that simple."

"It needs time," he continued, his voice growing hoarse. "I can't completely disregard the Harrington family's safety and burn bridges with the Thornes. I can't sever ties with my grandfather without considering our relationship. And my reckless actions... they could end up hurting Serena more. If I throw away everything - my reputation, wealth, power - how can I protect her from those who would harm her?"

The ice in his glass had completely melted. "Ending the engagement requires a process - careful planning, strategic maneuvering. What terrifies me is that by the time I accomplish all this, Serena might already be too far gone."

Lucas's fingers tightened around his glass. "I'm not even confident I can win her back. Once Serena gives up on something, she never looks back. Just like with Ian."

Looking up at me finally, his eyes held a desperation I'd never seen before. "That's why I need to find her now. I need her to wait for me, to not give up hope. I can't let her lose faith in me completely."
###chapter 151
Eleanor's POV

"You know what hurts the most?" Lucas's voice cut through the silence, barely above a whisper. "It's not that she left. It's that she had every right to."

That's what made this whole situation so impossible - nobody was truly wrong. They were just two people who loved each other, trapped in circumstances neither could control.

"How about this?" I straightened up, fighting against my slightly blurred vision. "Since I'm already staying at Serena's place, I can continue living there. I'll... put in some good words for you when I talk to her."

The moment the words left my mouth, I held my breath, watching Lucas's reaction. He turned slightly, his grey eyes meeting mine with an intensity that the alcohol hadn't dulled.

"You'd do that?" 

The question was soft, almost vulnerable. I couldn't help the small smile that crept onto my face.

"Aren't you glad to have such a thoughtful sister?" I ventured, trying to lighten the moment.

"Mm." Just a simple sound, but coming from Lucas, it felt like a warm embrace. I couldn't remember the last time he'd acknowledged me like this. Growing up, praise from him had been as rare as snow in summer.

Seeing the table covered with empty bottles, I knew I had to stop Lucas from drinking any more - things would get bad. So, I said, "Brother, no more drinking, let's head out."
The room was starting to feel pleasantly warm, and I had to concentrate to keep my words from slurring.

"Waiting," he replied, his voice steady despite the amount we'd consumed.

"For who?"

"The driver."

I couldn't help but smile. Even three sheets to the wind, my brother was still thinking ahead. Sometimes I wondered if it was a blessing or a curse, this inability to truly let go. 

The comfortable silence that had settled between Lucas and me was suddenly shattered by his unexpected question.

"Are you still in love with Jace?"

The words hit me like a splash of cold water. My fingers tightened around my glass as I fought to keep my expression neutral. "What are you talking about?" I tried to laugh it off, but the sound came out strained. Even in the dim lighting of the private room, I could feel his sharp gaze dissecting my reaction.

He didn't say anything, just maintained that steady, knowing look.

"Not anymore," I finally muttered, the words feeling like a betrayal of the feelings. It was as good as admitting I'd once been in love with him, but what was the point in denying it now? Lucas had always seen right through me.

The alcohol coursing through my system made everything feel more intense - the ache in my chest, the burn of unshed tears, the weight of eight years of unrequited feelings. I let out a bitter laugh.

"Eight years of one-sided love. God knows how I survived it." The words spilled out before I could stop them. "Thank goodness for my stellar emotional resilience, right?"

Lucas set his glass down with deliberate care. "You should let it go, Ellie."

Something in me snapped. Maybe it was the alcohol, or maybe it was the culmination of years of bottled-up feelings, but I couldn't hold back anymore.

"Yeah, right," I spat out, my voice trembling. "Because only you and Serena deserve love. Clearly, I'm not worthy of it!" The words came out sharper than I'd intended, laced with an bitterness.

I saw Lucas's expression shift, softening in a way it rarely did. "That's not what I meant."

"Then what did you mean?" I challenged, hating how my voice cracked. "When you were heartbroken over Serena, did I tell you to just 'let it go'? Some brother you are!"

The tears I'd been fighting began to well up, and I blamed it entirely on the alcohol. Crying over Jace Gillard in front of my brother - could this night get any more mortifying?

"You'll find someone better," Lucas said quietly, his voice gentler than I'd heard it in years. It was the same tone he'd used when I was little, and somehow that made it worse.

"We'll see," I managed, trying to sound nonchalant even as I blinked back tears. "Can we just... can we not talk about this anymore?"

He nodded, and I could feel his concern radiating across the space between us.

"I think it's time to go," I announced, pushing myself up from the leather seat. The room swayed slightly, and I realized I'd had more to drink than I'd thought. I took a careful step forward, determined to maintain at least some dignity.

That's when it happened. My heel caught on something - probably one of the many empty bottles littering the floor - and I stumbled. I braced myself for the fall, but instead of hitting the ground, I felt strong hands steady me.

My heart stopped. I knew those hands. I slowly raised my eyes, praying I was wrong, that this was just some alcohol-induced hallucination.

But no. There was Jace Gillard.
###chapter 152
Eleanor's POV

"Be careful," Jace said softly, his hands falling away from my elbows as soon as he was sure I was steady.

Wait. Jace? Wasn't a driver supposed to pick us up? My alcohol-fogged brain struggled to process this unexpected development. I clenched my fists, willing myself to maintain composure despite the sudden thundering of my heart.

"Can you walk by yourself?" The concern in his voice was evident as he addressed my brother. I noticed how his eyes quickly assessed Lucas's condition, cataloging every detail with characteristic thoroughness.

That was so typically Jace - always attentive, always caring, but never in the way I wanted him to be. Maybe that's what had drawn me to him in the first place. His quiet competence, his understated kindness, the way he carried responsibility so naturally.

"Eleanor," he said, turning back to me, "this is Serena's car. I can drop you off when I return it." His tone was matter-of-fact, leaving no room for argument or awkwardness.

The walk to the parking lot felt endless. The night air was cool against my flushed skin, and I concentrated on placing one foot carefully in front of the other. 

My mind wandered treacherously to all the seemingly perfect men in Jace's social circle - more handsome, more successful, more wealthy. Yet here I was, eight years later, still caught in his orbit.

In the parking lot, the sleek black car waited. Lucas took the passenger seat without hesitation, leaving me to slide into the back. 

Jace drove with the same precise care he applied to everything, taking the curves gently in deference to our inebriated state. As we stopped at a red light, Jace suddenly frowned. "Lucas, what happened to your hand?"

I leaned forward, noticing for the first time the angry red marks across my brother's knuckles. Had he hit something? When had that happened?

"It's nothing," Lucas dismissed, but Jace was already signaling to pull over.

"There's a pharmacy ahead," he said, his tone brooking no argument. "I'll get something for that."

Lucas leaned over and whispered a few words to Jace. Jace then exited the car and walked off in the direction of the pharmacy.

A yawn escaped me, and I settled back against the seat. The gentle hum of the car's engine combined with the alcohol in my system was making it increasingly difficult to keep my eyes open.

Through half-closed eyes, I watched the city lights blur past the window. Eight years of loving someone who barely saw me as more than a niece. The universe's cosmic joke at my expense.

The rest of the drive passed in a blur of streetlights and quiet conversation between the two men in front. I drifted in and out of consciousness, lulled by the smooth motion of the car and the low murmur of their voices. 

As we approached the apartments where Lucas lived, I roused myself enough to sit up straighter. I saw Jace helping Lucas walk home, my eyes heavy with sleep. Jace then came back to the car and drove off.



Jace's POV

After dropping Lucas off, I checked the rearview mirror one more time. Eleanor was still fast asleep in the back seat, her head tilted at an awkward angle that would surely leave her with a stiff neck come morning. 

I deliberately slowed the car, taking extra care over speed bumps and around corners. The streets were nearly empty at this hour, allowing me to focus on maintaining the smoothest possible ride. Through the mirror, I watched as she shifted slightly, mumbling something incomprehensible - exactly the way she used to do during those long-ago afternoon naps.

The sight transported me back to simpler times, when she was just Lucas's little sister who would inevitably fall asleep on my shoulder during movie nights. Back then, everything had been uncomplicated. I'd been the reliable uncle figure, the one who'd check on her during thunderstorms because I knew she was afraid but too proud to admit it.

Now, watching her sleep with her guard completely down, I couldn't help but notice how vulnerable she looked. Her carefully maintained professional image had slipped away, replaced by something that made my chest tighten with an uncomfortable mix of nostalgia and guilt.

Pulling into the underground parking garage of Serena's building, I turned off the engine and sat for a moment in the silence. Eleanor hadn't stirred once during the entire drive. Her head had slipped even further to the side.

There was no avoiding it - I'd have to carry her up. The thought made me hesitate, aware of how many boundaries this would cross, but leaving her to sleep in the car wasn't an option. With a resigned sigh, I got out and carefully opened the back door.

She barely stirred as I gathered her in my arms, automatically curling toward my chest the way she had as a child. The familiar gesture hit me with unexpected force. How many times had I carried her from the car to her bed after family gatherings? How many times had I been the one she trusted to keep her safe?

When Serena opened the door, her expression shifted from surprise to understanding as she took in the scene.

"I apologize for the late disturbance," I said quietly. "Eleanor fell asleep."

Serena hesitated, something unspoken flickering across her face. "Oh, it's fine. Actually..." She trailed off, then seemed to think better of whatever she'd been about to say. "Please bring her in."

I followed her to Eleanor's room, careful not to bump Eleanor's head or feet against any doorframes. Laying her down gently, I stepped back, trying to ignore how natural the whole thing had felt. Some habits, it seemed, were too deeply ingrained to forget, no matter how many years passed.

"The medicine is for your neck," I said to Serena as we returned to the living room, pulling the pharmacy bag from my pocket. I noticed she was still fully dressed despite the late hour, and there was a tension in her shoulders.

She paused, a slight look of surprise crossing her features.

"Lucas asked me to give this to you," I explained.

Serena pressed her lips together, remaining silent.

Earlier that evening, when James Chapman had grabbed her, he'd left a large bruise on her neck. I knew she thought Lucas hadn't noticed, but he had.

"Thank you," she said, accepting the medicine.

I could tell she was only taking it to spare me any awkwardness. She didn't want to dwell on small gestures like this anymore. I understood what her composure meant - the more casually she handled it, the less she cared. Honestly, I wasn't sure if Lucas could win her back at this point.

"Oh, and one more thing," I added. "There's hangover medication in there. If Eleanor wakes up with any aftereffects tomorrow morning, please give her one pill."

"Alright," Serena agreed, then continued softly, "If you can't give Eleanor a future, please keep your distance from her."

I felt a twinge in my chest.

"Having no hope is better than having false hope," she said directly.

"I understand," I nodded.
###chapter 153
Serena's POV

Eleanor sent me a text. "What time did you leave this morning?"

"Just after 7 AM," I replied.

"So you didn't sleep at all last night?" Her concern was evident even through the message.

"I got a little rest," I texted back. "Remember to eat. I have a meeting starting soon."

"Take care of yourself," Eleanor urged.

"I will."

Even through the screen, I could sense Eleanor's worry about my hectic schedule.

I put down my phone and headed to the conference room. The morning was spent discussing bidding proposals, while the afternoon was dedicated to developing a new brand strategy. For a company to keep growing, constant innovation is essential.

By the time the meetings ended, it was already time for most people to leave the office. I stayed behind to process dozens of approval requests that needed my attention.

My phone rang. I glanced at it and declined the call. A moment later, it rang again - an unknown number this time. After a brief hesitation, I answered, "Hello?"

"This is Midtown North Precinct, NYPD. We're calling in regards to yesterday's assault, Chapman versus Whitmore. We're requesting you come in to the station to clarify your statement."

"Alright," I agreed. "Should I come now?"

"That would be best."

"I'll be right there." I set aside my work and left my office.

Vincent looked surprised to see me leaving so early. "Ms. Sinclair?"

"My computer's still on. Could you help process the requests? Call or message me if you're unsure about anything."

"Of course," Vincent quickly agreed.

I took a taxi to the police station. My driving skills weren't the best, and given how little sleep I'd gotten last night, I didn't want to risk driving while fatigued.

When I arrived at the station, Ian was already there. My phone vibrated again - another call from Beatrice. I silenced it without looking.

"Ms. Sinclair?" The detective's voice broke through my thoughts. "If you'll follow me, we need to verify a few details about last night's incident."

I nodded, rising from the hard plastic chair. Ian Whitmore lounged against the wall. Our eyes met briefly before I looked away, refusing to acknowledge his presence.

The detective led us both to his office, a cramped space dominated by a desk cluttered with files and coffee cups. I deliberately chose the chair furthest from Ian, keeping my posture rigid despite my body's protest for rest.

"About Mr. Chapman's actions last night," the detective began, shuffling through his papers. "You're certain you want to press charges?"

"Absolutely." My voice came out stronger than I felt. "James Chapman's behavior was completely unacceptable. He threatened not only me but potentially the stability of StarRiver Group. I want this on record."

The detective nodded, sliding a form across the desk. "Please review and sign this statement."

As I leaned forward to read, my vision blurred momentarily. I blinked hard, forcing myself to focus on the words. My signature was less steady than usual, but it would suffice.

"That should be all for now," the detective said. "We'll contact you if we need any additional information."

I stood carefully, gathering my coat and bag. The floor seemed to tilt slightly beneath my feet, but I refused to show any sign of weakness. Ian followed me out of the office, his footsteps echoing mine.

"Serena." His said with hypocritical generosity. "Let me drive you home. It's late, and cabs are scarce at this hour."

"No, thank you." I kept walking, heading for the station's exit.

He persisted, matching my pace. "Don't be stubborn. We could grab a late dinner, talk things through. After everything that's happened with the Whitmore family crisis, I've had time to reflect. I realize now how much you did for me, how much I took for granted."

I stopped abruptly, turning to face him. "Save it, Ian. Your sudden concern isn't fooling anyone, least of all me."

"I'm being sincere." He stepped closer, lowering his voice. "I know I hurt you. I want to make amends. After this is all over, I'll stay out of your life completely. Just give me one chance to apologize properly."

A bitter laugh escaped my lips. "If you were truly sorry, you wouldn't be here right now, trying to manipulate the situation to your advantage. I see right through you, Ian. Whatever scheme you're plotting, whatever angle you're working - save your breath. I'm not giving you any opening to exploit."

The mask of contrition on his face flickered for just a moment, revealing a flash of the calculation beneath. "You've become quite cynical, Serena. I remember when you used to believe in second chances."

"I remember when I used to believe in you. We all grow wiser - ."

The world suddenly tilted sharply. I reached out instinctively, my hand finding the wall for support. The station's harsh lighting seemed to intensify, creating halos around every object. 

"Serena?" Ian's voice sounded distant. "Are you alright?"

I tried to respond, to maintain my composure, but the room was spinning faster now. A strange numbness crept through my limbs. Something was wrong - deeply wrong. The last thing I saw before darkness claimed me was Ian's face, his expression an unsettling mixture of blackness and calculation.
###chapter 154
Eleanor's POV

I watched as Le Jardin's private chef meticulously arranged the last dish on the dining table. The subtle aroma of truffle and herbs filled the apartment, but my attention was fixed on the delicate bone china soup bowl I'd specifically chosen for Serena. She'd grown so thin lately, her wrists as fragile as fine porcelain.

"The temperature will hold perfectly, Ms. Yates," the chef assured me, adjusting the warming plate. "I've included extra portions of the bone broth, as requested."

"Thank you." I checked my phone again - 8:55 PM. "That will be all."

After he left, I circled the table, adjusting everything to perfection. The silverware gleamed under the pendant lights, each piece perfectly aligned. Serena would probably tell me I was fussing too much, but she'd been pushing herself too hard lately. Someone had to look after her, even if she wouldn't look after herself.

Nine o'clock came and went. The candles burning lower. I'd canceled a client meeting for this dinner. The knot in my stomach was growing as I kept checking my phone.

By nine thirty, the unease had morphed into something darker. Serena's phone went straight to voicemail - again. This wasn't like her at all. Even during her busiest days, she never completely disconnected. She was too careful, too conscious of potential business emergencies.

"Something's wrong," I muttered to the silent apartment. 

I grabbed my keys and coat, hands shaking slightly as I punched the elevator button. The ride down to the parking garage felt endless. In my Range Rover, I gripped the steering wheel so tight my knuckles went white, trying to focus on breathing as I navigated through evening traffic toward StarRiver Group's headquarters.

The massive glass tower loomed ahead, its upper floors still illuminated despite the hour. I barely remembered to grab my visitor's pass before rushing through security. The elevator ride to the executive floor was torture, each floor number lighting up with agonizing slowness.

When the doors finally opened, I nearly collided with Vincent Chadwick. He stumbled back, startled by my sudden appearance.

"Ms. Yates? I wasn't expecting-"

"Where's Serena?" I cut him off, scanning the empty office space beyond.

Vincent straightened his tie, composure returning. "The CEO left hours ago. Around Five, I believe."

"Hours ago?" My voice rose sharply. "What about her evening appointments?"

"She canceled everything," he replied, frowning slightly. "Said she wasn't feeling well."

Ice formed in my stomach. Serena never admitted to feeling unwell, not unless something was seriously wrong. "Did she say where she was going?"

"No, just that she needed to handle some personal matters."

"Personal matters?" I echoed incredulously. "Serena doesn't have 'personal matters.' She lives and breathes this company."

Vincent shifted uncomfortably. "Well, she seemed... distracted today. After the meeting with legal about the Chapman situation-"

"Chapman?" My head snapped up. "What situation?"

But Vincent was already backing away, clearly realizing he'd said too much. "I'm sorry, Ms. Yates, but I really can't discuss company matters..."

I barely heard his excuses as I rushed back to the elevator, my mind racing. Back in my car, I sat motionless for a long moment, trying to think through the fog of panic. My hands trembled as I pulled out my phone, scrolling to Lucas's number.

The call connected on the second ring.

"Eleanor?" His deep voice was touched with surprise.

"Lucas," I choked out, tears suddenly threatening. "Serena's missing."

"What?" His tone sharpened instantly.

"She's gone! I've been waiting at home with dinner, but she never showed. Her phone's off - it's never off, Lucas! I went to StarRiver, but she left hours ago. Her secretary mentioned something about Chapman, but won't tell me more. She canceled all her meetings, said she wasn't feeling well, but you know her - she'd have to be dying to admit that!"

"Eleanor." His voice cut through my rambling. "Slow down. When was the last time anyone saw her?"

"Around Five, according to Vincent. But Lucas... she doesn't do this. She doesn't just disappear. Something's wrong. I can feel it."

There was a brief silence, then: "Stay where you are. I'm making some calls."

"But-"

"Eleanor." His tone brooked no argument. "Stay in your car. I'll call you back in five minutes."

The line went dead. I stared at the dark screen, feeling completely helpless.

A security guard passed by, giving my car a curious look. I realized I was crying, tears sliding silently down my cheeks. 

My phone lit up with Lucas's callback, and I grabbed it like a lifeline.

"Lucas?"

"She was at the police station." His voice was tight with controlled tension. "Something about filing charges against Chapman. That was about four hours ago."

"The police station? Why didn't she-"

"Eleanor, listen carefully. I need you to go home. I'll handle this."

"But I can help! I could-"

"Go home," he repeated firmly. "If she contacts you, call me immediately. Otherwise, stay put and let me work. Understood?"

I wanted to argue, to insist on doing something, anything. But the steel in his voice told me it would be useless. "Understood," I whispered.
###chapter 155
Lucas's POV

Serena was missing. My jaw clenched as I rose from my chair.

"Miles!" My voice cut through the stillness. The door opened immediately - he'd been waiting, sensing the urgency in my earlier movements.

"Sir?"

"Access the city's surveillance system. Focus on the route between the police station and StarRiver Group." I kept my voice steady. "I want every frame from the past four hours."

Miles nodded. "Should we notify the authorities?"

"No." The word came out sharper than intended. "Use our own people. Get me Burns." My grip on my watch tightened, the metal band digging into my palm.

The intercom buzzed. "Mr. Harrington, I have Burns on line one."

I pressed the button. "Status?"

"Still tracking Ian's movements." Burns's voice crackled through the speaker. "His phone's been off since 5 PM, but his car was last seen heading toward Brooklyn."

Ice crystallized in my veins. "Find him. No excuses."

"There's more." Burns hesitated. "We found security footage from StarRiver Group. Ian was there this afternoon, leaving through the back entrance."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. "Send everything to my phone. And Burns? When you find him, message me his location. Nothing else."

I ended the call, my reflection in the window growing harder.

Miles returned, tablet in hand. "Sir, the surveillance feeds are ready. And..." He paused, reading my expression. "The B protocol?"

"Initiate it." I turned from the window, my decision made. "Full spectrum."

"That could affect-"

"Execute the order, Miles." My tone left no room for discussion. He nodded and withdrew, leaving me alone with the growing darkness both outside and within.

I pulled up the footage on my computer, scanning through the streams of data. Each passing minute without answers felt like a physical weight, pressing against my chest. 

My phone vibrated. A message from Burns: "Security confirmed Ian's car entering the warehouse district an hour ago."

Another piece of the puzzle, and with it, a surge of cold fury. If Ian thought he could play games with me, he'd forgotten who I was.

I pressed the intercom. "Get me Howard Harrington."

Calling my grandfather at this hour would set things in motion that couldn't be undone. But as I waited for the connection, I remembered Serena's face, the trust she'd slowly begun to show. The way Milo and Stella had bloomed under her care.

"Lucas?" My grandfather's voice, sharp despite the hour. "What's wrong?"

"I need access to the offshore accounts." My words were clipped, precise. "All of them."

A pause. "The personal ones?"

"Everything."

Another pause, longer this time. When he spoke again, I heard the predator that had built our empire. "Done. Should I ask why?"

"Ian Whitmore has crossed a line." The name tasted bitter on my tongue. "He needs to learn what that means."

"Understood." A soft chuckle. "It's about time you showed them our teeth."

I pulled up another screen, fingers flying across the keyboard. Financial data streamed past - Ian's investments, his family's holdings, every vulnerability I'd cataloged and never used. Until now.

"Miles," I called out, knowing he'd be waiting. "Contact our friends at Vanguard Media. It's time they earned their retainer."

"The full package?"

"Everything we have." I paused, a cold smile touching my lips. "Make sure Ian's father sees tomorrow's headlines first."



Serena's POV

The first sensation that registered was the throbbing in my head. Consciousness returned slowly, like wading through thick fog, bringing with it a nauseating dizziness that made even keeping my eyes open a challenge. I hadn't eaten much all day that had probably led to this low blood sugar episode.

As my vision cleared, confusion gave way to a sharp spike of fear. This wasn't my bedroom at the Sinclair mansion, nor was it any room I recognized. The space was sparsely furnished, with heavy curtains drawn across what I assumed was a window, blocking most of the natural light. My arms were stretched uncomfortably above my head, and when I tried to move them, the bite of restraints against my wrists confirmed my worst fears.

I forced myself to breathe slowly, fighting down the panic threatening to overwhelm me.
The door opened with a soft click, and Ian Whitmore stepped inside.

"Finally awake." His voice was gentle, almost tender, making it all the more disturbing. "I was starting to worry."

"Untie me, Ian." I kept my voice steady, despite the fear coursing through my veins. "You realize this is kidnapping? You'll go to prison for this."

He laughed, the sound lacking any real warmth. "Prison? Oh, Serena. Always so dramatic." He moved closer, perching on the edge of the bed. "This is just a private moment between lovers. Who would believe otherwise? After all, we have such a... history."

I turned my face away as he reached out to touch my cheek, disgust rolling through me. "We're not lovers, Ian. We never will be again. Whatever this is - whatever you think you're doing - it stops now."

"It stops when I say it stops." The gentleness vanished from his voice. "You've forgotten your place, Serena. Running around playing CEO, rejecting my partnership offer, humiliating me in front of the public." His fingers gripped my chin, forcing me to look at him. "I've been patient. So patient. Giving you time to come to your senses. But you just keep making the wrong choices."

"The only wrong choice I ever made was trusting you." I met his gaze steadily, channeling all my contempt into my words. "Looking back now, it makes me sick to think I ever loved you."

The change in his expression was instantaneous. His features twisted, that carefully maintained facade cracking to reveal the ugliness beneath. His grip on my chin tightened painfully.

"Love?" he snarled. "You don't know the first thing about love. All you understand is ambition and betrayal. I offered you everything - position, power, respect. And you threw it back in my face."

"You offered me chains disguised as jewelry," I shot back. "A cage made of golden bars is still a cage, Ian. I see that now, even if I was too blind to see it then."

His hand moved to my throat, not quite squeezing but resting there - a clear threat. "The old Serena would never have spoken to me like this. What happened to that sweet, obedient girl who knew her place?"

"She grew up." Despite the fear making my heart race, my voice remained steady. "She learned her worth. And she realized that men like you - who need to tie women up to keep them close - are nothing but cowards."

The slap came without warning, snapping my head to the side. The pain bloomed across my cheek, but I refused to make a sound. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

"Careful, darling." Ian's voice had gone soft again, which was somehow more frightening than his anger. "You're all alone here. No Lucas Harrington to come running to your rescue. No daddy's money to buy your way out. Just you and me, like it should have been all along."

"You're wrong, Ian." I turned back to face him, letting him see the steel in my eyes. "I'm not alone. And you're not going to win this time."

His laugh was ugly. "Always so confident. Let's see how long that lasts, shall we?"

Ian's hands suddenly tightened around my throat. A searing pain shot through my neck, and I was consumed by a feeling of suffocation.
###chapter 156
Serena's POV

If I were to die, to die like this, by Ian... I would die with such a heavy heart. But I did not plead. I only glared at Ian, my eyes bloodshot.

His grip on my throat suddenly loosened, and I could breathe again. For a split second, I'd truly believed I might die, but my rational mind knew better - Ian Whitmore didn't have the courage for murder.

I watched him pace across the room. The confident facade was cracking, revealing glimpses of the coward beneath.

When he turned back to face me, there was something new in his hand that made my blood run cold. A small vial. Even maintaining my composure, I couldn't quite hide the flash of panic in my eyes.

"Scared now, Serena?" His voice was soft, almost gentle. "You should be."

"What is that?" I kept my voice steady, though my heart was racing.

"Just something to help you relax." He smiled, and it was terrible in its tenderness. "To remind you of how things should be between us."

A wave of revulsion washed over me. "You're even more pathetic than I thought, Ian. Is this what you've become? A man who needs drugs to force a woman to want him?"

His expression twisted. "Three years, Serena! Three years we were together, and I never laid a finger on you without your permission. I respected you!" The vial trembled in his hand. "And how did you repay that respect? By jumping into bed with Lucas Harrington!"

I actually laughed then, a sharp, bitter sound. "Respect? Is that what you call it? Tell me, Ian, was Nina keeping you satisfied all that time? Did you think about me at all while you were in her bed?"

"Don't you dare bring Nina into this!" But I could see I'd struck a nerve. His composure was slipping further.

"Why not? She's as much a part of this as anyone." I met his gaze steadily. "But you know what's funny? Nina doesn't love you, Ian. She never has. She only wants what I have - always has. Everything I want, she tries to take."

He scoffed, but there was uncertainty in his eyes now. "You're delusional. Nina loves me. She's supported me through everything-"

"Really?" I arched an eyebrow. "Then why isn't the Sinclair family helping Whitmore Corp through this crisis? If Nina truly loves you, where's their investment? Why are they standing back, watching your company crumble?"

The vial in his hand lowered slightly as doubt crept across his face.

"Let me spell it out for you, since you're too blind to see it." My voice was cold, precise. "This whole situation? It's her perfect setup. Once anything happens between us here, Nina will have exactly what she wants - proof of your infidelity. She'll play the heartbroken victim, use it as her excuse to leave you. And then? The Sinclairs can openly refuse to help your family's company. No one will question it, given your 'betrayal.'"

"You're lying," he whispered, but the conviction was gone from his voice.

"Am I? Think about it, Ian. Nina's always been calculating. She learned from the best - watching me all these years. But she lacks the nerve to make the hard choices herself. This way, she gets everything she wants. A clean break from you, her family's approval, and best of all? She gets to hurt me in the process."

I could see my words hitting home, each one finding its mark with surgical precision. The vial trembled more violently in his hand.

"The Whitmore name is already tainted by the financial crisis," I continued relentlessly. "Add a scandal like this? Your reputation would be destroyed. Nina walks away clean, while you lose everything. She's playing you like a puppet, and you're too arrogant to see the strings."

The silence that followed was deafening. I watched the realization dawn in his eyes, followed by the first stirrings of genuine fear. The careful plan he thought he'd crafted was unraveling before him, revealing the trap he'd walked right into.

"You're wrong," he said finally, but his voice lacked conviction. "Nina wouldn't..."

"Wouldn't she? When have you ever really known what Nina is capable of?" I laughed softly. "You thought you were so clever, Ian. But you're just another piece on her chessboard. And you've played exactly the move she wanted."

The vial slipped from his fingers, hitting the carpet with a muted thud. His face had gone ashen, and I knew I'd won. The logic was irrefutable, the trap too obvious now that I'd pointed it out.

The silence stretched between us. My words about Nina had shattered something in Ian, but not in the way I'd hoped. Instead of opening his eyes, he'd retreated further into denial, his expression hardening with dangerous conviction.

"You're wrong about Nina," he snarled. "She loves me more than herself. Your manipulations won't work, Serena." His fingers clenched around the vial he'd retrieved from the floor. "Nina would never calculate like that. She's pure, unlike you."

I watched him pace, my wrists aching from the restraints. "Pure? Is that why you're acting on her behalf, doing her dirty work?"

He whirled on me. "This has nothing to do with Nina! This is about you, about what you deserve!"

Before I could react, he was on me, one hand forcing my jaw open while the other brought the vial to my lips. I struggled, but bound as I was, there was little I could do. The bitter pill slid down my throat, followed by water that nearly made me choke.

"Perfect," he whispered, stepping back to watch me with unsettling intensity. "Soon you'll understand what real desire feels like."

Horror crept through me as understanding dawned. "Psychs? Really, Ian? Did Nina suggest this sophisticated approach?"

"Stop bringing her into this!" His composure cracked again. "Nina would never... she's not that calculating!"

"So you admit what you're doing is despicable?" I kept my voice steady despite the growing fear of what the drug might do. "The great Ian Whitmore, reduced to drugging women. What would your parents think?"

His laugh was ugly. "You won't be in any position to tell them." He pulled out his phone, checking the settings. "Once I have video of you begging for it, you won't dare speak a word. How would Lucas react to seeing you like that? You won't even be worthy of being his mistress."

I forced down the panic rising in my throat. Think, Serena. Focus. "You think this will break me? I survived worse at eighteen. This won't destroy me, Ian. But it will destroy you and what's left of the Whitmore name."

"Empty threats." But his hands weren't quite steady as he set up the phone. "You have no idea what I'm capable of."

"No, you have no idea what I'm capable of." My voice was ice. "I've faced public scandal before. I rebuilt from nothing. But you? The mighty Whitmore heir, caught drugging and assaulting a woman? Your company is already on the brink. This scandal would push it over the edge."

He paced again, agitation clear in every movement. "You're bluffing. Once the video spreads-"

"Once the video spreads, every business contact you have will drop you. Your reputation will be destroyed. Even Nina won't be able to save you - though I doubt she'll try. She'll probably be the first to condemn you publicly."

My hands clenched into fists as I fought to stay focused through the first wave of dizziness. The drug was starting to take effect, but I refused to let it show. "You'll lose everything, Ian. Your company, your reputation, your freedom. Was revenge really worth it?"

"Shut up!" He raked his fingers through his perfectly styled hair, destroying its careful arrangement. "You don't understand anything!"

"I understand everything." I met his wild gaze steadily. "I understand that you're still that insecure boy playing at power, desperate to prove yourself. But this? This just proves how weak you really are."

The phone trembled in his hand. "You think you're so clever, don't you? Always analyzing, always calculating. But your body will betray you soon enough. The drug will make sure of that."
###chapter 157
Serena's POV

The drug was making it harder to think clearly, but desperation sharpened my focus. "If you cross this line, Ian, you'll regret it forever." I forced steel into my voice despite the growing heat in my veins. "Lucas will kill you."

His laugh was hollow, tinged with madness. "Lucas? Your precious Lucas Harrington?" He leaned closer, his breath hot against my face. "He has a wife, Serena. You're just his mistress. Do you really think he'd risk murder for you?"

Each word struck like a physical blow. The truth was, I knew better than anyone what Lucas would do to anyone who harmed me. But Ian was beyond reason now, beyond threats or logic.

The room seemed to pulse around me, the effects of the drug intensifying. I dug my nails into my palms, fighting to stay focused. My skin felt too tight, too sensitive, every nerve ending screaming for relief.

"You don't look so defiant now," Ian observed, satisfaction dripping from his words. He reached for the restraints, and I tensed. "Let's make you more... comfortable."

As he worked at the knots, memories I'd tried to bury clawed their way to the surface. Another time, another place, when I'd begged to be released. The shame and helplessness threatened to overwhelm me, but I forced them back.

"Let me go," I managed, hating the tremor in my voice. "I'll cooperate with Whitmore Corp. We can still fix this."

"You expect me to believe you?" His fingers paused on the rope. "After everything?"

"I always keep my word." I pressed my thigh hard enough to bruise, using the pain to fight the drug's effects. "You know that about me."

The last restraint fell away, and for a moment, hope flared. Then his grip closed around my wrist like iron. "Nice try."

I moved anyway, throwing myself toward the edge of the bed. My legs were unsteady, but adrenaline gave me strength. I made it three steps before the room tilted sickeningly.

The door seemed miles away, stretching and warping in my drug-addled vision. I stumbled forward, knowing it was futile but unable to stop trying. My fingers had just brushed the handle when Ian's arms wrapped around me from behind.

"Did you really think I'd make it that easy?" His voice was almost gentle as he dragged me back. "No one will find you here. This place..." He paused, and I could hear the smirk in his voice. "Well, Nina and I spent many pleasant afternoons here. It's completely private. Soundproof. Secure."

The revelation hit like ice water. I went limp in his grip, tears sliding down my cheeks as the last hope of rescue dimmed.

He threw me back onto the bed, the impact jarring through my bones. "Now," he said, reaching for his phone again. "Where were we?"

I closed my eyes, unable to bear the triumph in his face. 

Ian's hands clamped onto my clothes, tearing at the fabric. The sound, so sharp and brutal, echoed the tearing of my sanity. A cold rush of air made my exposed skin crawl with dread. I tried to push him away, but my limbs were limp, powerless against his strength.

I felt his weight pressing down, crushing me, and tried to evade his grasp, but his grip was unyielding. His mouth, a brutal, demanding force, crashed down on my cheeks, my neck, his teeth and stubble scraping at my skin. Each kiss was an act of invasion, not affection, filling me with disgust and fear. He became a predator, claiming me as his territory.

His kisses weren't gentle explorations, but savage assaults. He sucked, he bit, as if devouring me. His breath, hot and rapid, reeked of liquor and something sickeningly excited. He was plundering, leaving me no space to breathe.

I fought, desperate to escape, but my nails scraped against his arms, useless against his force. I tried to turn my head, but his hands held it captive. I whimpered, my attempts at a shout reduced to broken sounds, my chest heaving, my breath ragged.

I tried to cling to consciousness, to resist, but the drugs had sapped my strength, my mind was swimming in a fog. I felt adrift, at his mercy, drowning in his control. Anger, fear, and despair swirled inside me. I couldn't accept that I was about to be degraded this way.

Tears streamed down my face. Some people's destinies seem forever shrouded in darkness.

Losing my mother as a child, watching my father marry another woman, gaining a stepsister who became my tormentor - with everyone in the family taking her side. Despite my academic excellence and obvious talent, that same stepsister framed me for an out-of-wedlock pregnancy that scandalized Manhattan's elite. I was expelled from my prestigious university, disowned by my father, left to wander foreign streets, desperately fighting to survive.

I thought I'd found true love once - a man I gave everything to, only to discover him sleeping with my stepsister behind my back.

Then I believed I'd found love again, finally gathering the courage to give my heart another chance. But it was all just another cruel deception.

Yet through it all, I kept fighting, kept pushing forward. Life is too precious a gift to waste. I couldn't bear to disappoint my mother's dying wish: "Even when I'm gone, carry my love with you. Live well, live happily."

Whenever life's burdens become too heavy to bear, I remember those words. They give me the strength to grit my teeth and endure.

I would survive this too. It was just another replay of that nightmare from when I was eighteen. Just another round of fate's cruelty.

Perhaps... perhaps with enough repetition, you simply become numb to the pain.
###chapter 158
Lucas's POV

The door exploded inward with a thunderous crash.
"What the f*ck!" Ian jerked back from Serena, shock flashing across his face.

"I'LL KILL YOU!" My roar was barely human as I lunged forward, vision blazing red. Ian's eyes widened in terror, frozen for a split second too long.

"Lucas? How-how did you find me?" Ian's shock turned to panic. I didn't bother responding.

I seized him by the throat, ripping him off Serena with savage force. His body slammed into the side table, sending the lamp crashing to the floor. Before he could recover, I was on him, straddling his chest as my fist connected with his jaw.

"HELP! SOMEBODY HELP!" Ian's screams echoed off the walls.

"I own this entire hotel now," I snarled, my voice low and dark. "My men have this floor surrounded. No one's coming to help you."

Blood sprayed from his mouth, spattering across my knuckles. Another blow crushed his nose, cartilage giving way with a sickening crunch. My perfectly styled hair had fallen forward, and I kept shoving it back with bloodied fingers, not caring about the crimson streaks it left across my forehead. His left eye was swelling shut, skin splitting under each impact. Dark bruises bloomed across his features.

"Please... stop!" Ian choked out between blows, blood and saliva bubbling from his lips. His pleading only stoked my fury higher. This monster dared to beg after what he'd done?

He tried crawling backward toward the window, fingers scrabbling desperately at the carpet. His hand caught the heavy curtains, yanking them down with a screech of tearing fabric as I dragged him back. The curtain rod crashed down, adding to the chaos of broken furniture and shattered glass.

"Boss!" Miles grabbed my arm. "You'll kill him!"

I hurled him aside with a snarl, barely registering his body hitting the wall. Nothing mattered except destroying the man beneath me.

"Boss, please!" Miles' voice cracked with desperation. "Think about Serena! She needs you right now!"

The words jolted me back to reality. My rage dissipated like smoke as I stumbled off Ian, tripping over the broken furniture. I rushed to Serena's side, my voice shaking. "Serena? Are you alright?"

She didn't respond. Her pupils were dilated, gaze unfocused as she stared past me into nothing. Her breathing was shallow and irregular, body trembling.

I spun back to Ian, kicking him viciously in the ribs. "What did you give her?"

A cruel laugh bubbled up through his bloodied lips. "Screw you."

Blind rage swept through me again. I grabbed the broken lamp from the floor and smashed it across his body. 

"Take him to the police," I ordered Miles, my voice raw. "Make sure he never sees daylight again."

"I'll handle everything, sir. Get her out of here."

I crossed to the bed in three long strides, my hands gentle now as I reached for her despite the trembling fury still coursing through me. Her clothes were torn, buttons ripped away... if I'd been even minutes later...

The thought threatened to send me back into a killing rage, but Serena needed me calm. I shrugged out of my coat, wrapping it carefully around her before lifting her into my arms. She felt so small, so fragile against my chest.

"I've got you," I whispered, cradling her close as I strode from that hellish room. "You're safe now."

I helped Serena into the back seat and quickly returned to the driver's position. Suddenly, I let out an involuntary groan as Serena leaned forward from the back seat, her head pressing against my neck. The heat from her fever-ridden body was overwhelming. In her drug-induced state, she was completely delirious - her burning skin pressed against mine, her hands erratically grasping at my shirt.

I forced myself to take steady breaths, maintaining iron control. Every muscle in my body tensed as I focused solely on driving. The situation was maddening, but I wouldn't take advantage - not when she was clearly not herself, affected by whatever drug they had given her.

Her hands had already torn several buttons from my white dress shirt in her fevered state. I kept my eyes resolutely on the road, gripping the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white. If this helped ease her discomfort, I would endure it.

Finally reaching Tribeca Towers' underground parking garage, I carefully extracted myself from the driver's seat, earning a disappointed whimper from Serena. The sound was filled with a vulnerability that tore at my self-control. After taking a moment to compose myself, I opened the door and lifted her into my arms.

The elevator ride was excruciating. Serena became even more restless in my arms, her burning hands now completely destroying what remained of my shirt buttons, exposing my chest. I kept my breathing measured and controlled, focusing on getting her safely to her apartment.

When Eleanor opened the door, her eyes widened at the scene before her. I strode past, carrying Serena directly to her bedroom. As I tried to set her down, she wrapped her arms around my neck, pulling me closer...

"Get out!" I managed to say to Eleanor, my voice rough with restraint.

Eleanor hesitated at the door. "Be gentle with her," she pleaded anxiously before finally closing it behind her.

I would need to call a doctor immediately. Whatever drug was in her system needed to be dealt with properly.

I kept my breathing measured as I dialed Dr. Thompson's number, never taking my eyes off Serena. Her skin was flushed, pupils dilated, and her usual composed demeanor had given way to something foreign and concerning. Within minutes, I heard the doctor's swift footsteps in the hallway.

"Elevated heart rate, disorientation, altered mental state," I reported in clipped tones, stepping away from the bed to speak with him. My jaw clenched as I watched Dr. Thompson examine her symptoms.

"It appears to be a psychedelic substance," he informed me quietly by the door. "I have a sedative prepared if her vitals become more unstable. The effects should naturally subside within hours, but she needs constant monitoring."

"I'll stay," I said firmly. "Wait outside with the medication in case it's needed." The doctor nodded and left, closing the door softly behind him.

I positioned myself in the furthest corner of the room, settling into a chair where I could keep watch. Every fiber of my being wanted to comfort her, but I knew maintaining distance was crucial right now. Her fevered calls tugged at something deep in my chest, but I remained rooted in place, speaking only in calm, steady tones when needed to reassure her.

Hours crawled by. I focused on her breathing patterns, marking each subtle shift as the drug worked its way through her system. My only movement was to occasionally text Miles to handle any urgent business matters - everything else could wait. Nothing was more important than seeing her safely through this.

"It wasn't your fault," I found myself saying quietly when her agitation peaked again. "I'm here, and you're going to be fine." I kept my voice steady, a counterpoint to the turmoil I felt watching her struggle.
###chapter 159
Serena's POV

The pain came first - a deep, persistent ache that radiated through every muscle. I kept my eyes closed, trying to piece together the fragments of last night through the fog in my mind.

Ten years ago. Another morning, another bed. I was eighteen then, young and naive enough to think running away would solve everything. Back then, I'd fled at the first light of dawn, leaving behind only crumpled sheets and my shattered innocence.

Now, at twenty-eight, I lay perfectly still, acutely aware of the steady breathing behind me. The warmth radiating from the body next to mine was both comforting and terrifying. I didn't need to look to know someone was there - Lucas Harrington.

Memories of last night began filtering back, like scenes from a poorly edited film. Ian's triumphant smirk as he led me to that hotel. The bitter taste of the pill. The way the room had started spinning, my body betraying me as the drug took effect. Then chaos - the sound of fighting, strong arms lifting me, and everything fading to black.

A slight shift in the breathing behind me told me he was awake. 

"Going somewhere?" His voice was low and controlled.

I forced myself to remain still, fighting the urge to wrap the sheet tighter around myself. "This changes nothing, Lucas."

"Serena." The way he said my name - soft yet commanding - made something twist inside my chest. "Look at me."

I didn't. Instead, I stared at the strip of morning light cutting across the floor, watching dust motes dance in the beam. "I appreciate your... intervention last night. But this situation is complicated enough without adding more confusion to it."

The mattress dipped as he moved, and suddenly his presence was overwhelming - not touching me, but close enough that I could feel the heat from his body. "Is that what you think this is? Confusion?"

A bitter laugh escaped me. "What else would you call it? Ian Whitemore tried to drug me, Nina is probably celebrating her success in ruining my reputation, and I ended up in bed with..." I trailed off, not quite sure how to categorize what Lucas Harrington was to me.

"With someone who stopped you from being assaulted," he finished, his voice taking on an edge. "Though I'm curious why you went to meet Ian alone in the first place."

"I didn't go there to meet Ian," I said, the words clipped. "I went to the police station to make a statement and ran into Ian. As I was leaving, I fainted due to low blood sugar."

Slience strenched between us. "Let's just forget about last night," I said, keeping my voice carefully neutral. "You should leave."

Lucas made no move to get up from the bed. Instead, he shifted slightly, causing the morning light to illuminate the bruises and cuts scattered across his torso. The sight made my breath catch - I hadn't noticed the extent of his injuries in the dim light earlier.

"Is running away your solution to everything, Serena?" His voice held that familiar mix of amusement and challenge that never failed to get under my skin.

I forced myself to look away from the angry red mark stretching across his ribcage. "This isn't running away. This is being practical. We both know this situation is complicated enough without adding... whatever this is."

"Look at me." When I didn't comply, his voice hardened. "Serena. Look at me."

Reluctantly, I turned my head. Lucas was sitting up now, the sheets pooled around his waist, his injuries even more apparent in the strengthening daylight. Despite myself, my eyes traced the path of a particularly nasty bruise blooming across his shoulder.

"You got those fighting Ian," I said quietly. It wasn't a question.

He nodded and studied my serious expression, his voice softening. "The doctor said Ian gave you Shrooms. They recommended sedatives, but I was worried about potential brain damage. So I stayed with you all night. I didn't take advantage of you, but you weren't lucid. You tore my shirt to shreds, and I had to stay close to keep you from hurting yourself."

I stared at him, stunned into silence.

"If you don't believe me, ask Eleanor or the doctor. They were outside the door all night," he added, watching my reaction carefully.

I didn't respond immediately. Despite his past omission about being the man from when I was eighteen, our time together had shown me his character. His dignity, his principles. he wasn't a liar - even with that past secret, he'd never denied it when asked. He'd simply waited to reveal the truth.

For him to state things this definitively... I had no real reason to doubt him. 

But I couldn't articulate what I was feeling. Perhaps I just didn't want to let Lucas in again. It was easier to wall myself off, to assume the worst about him. To avoid thinking too deeply about what had really happened last night - partly to protect myself from the pain, and partly because I didn't want to acknowledge his kindness.

"Do you believe me now?" Lucas asked softly, noting my silence.

"Just go," I muttered, though my voice had lost its earlier conviction.

Lucas gave a resigned smile and pulled back the covers.

When he did, I froze for a moment before quickly turning away. I'd forgotten he was shirtless.

Heat flooded my face as I quickly averted my eyes. "I... you... where are your clothes?"

His chuckle held a mix of amusement and embarrassment. "Ah, about that. You were rather... enthusiastic last night. My shirt didn't survive the encounter, and the rest..."

"Oh God." I buried my face in my hands, mortification washing over me. "I'm so sorry."

"Serena." His voice was gentle, almost teasing. "Look at me."

"Absolutely not." My voice was muffled by my hands. "Not until you're properly dressed."

"Which might be difficult, considering my current lack of options."

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to think practically. "Wait here. I'll get you something to wear. Consider it... compensation for last night."
###chapter 160
Eleanor's POV

I nearly fell flat on my face when the door suddenly opened. Only my quick reflexes and a lifetime of yoga classes saved me from an embarrassing collision with Serena, who was apparently in quite a hurry to leave.

"Eleanor?" Serena's surprise quickly turned to suspicion. "What are you doing here?"

"I wasn't eavesdropping!" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. I straightened up, trying to regain some dignity. "I was just worried about you two. It's already 3 PM, and after such an... exhausting night, aren't you hungry?"

Serena's cheeks colored slightly, but she maintained her usual composure. "I'm actually heading out to pick up some things."

I couldn't help but notice how she moved - there was something different about her usual grace, a subtle change in her posture that made my inner romantic sit up and take notice. "Things?" I echoed, trying to keep the grin off my face.

"Your brother needs..." she paused, clearly choosing her words carefully, "some new clothes."

Oh. My. God.

I bit my lip to keep from squealing. This was better than I could have iamgened. "New clothes?" I repeated innocently. "What happened to his old ones?"

"Eleanor." The warning in Serena's voice only made me more curious.

I held up my hands in surrender, watching her as she walked toward the elevator. Once she was safely in the elevator, I practically bounced into the apartment. "Lucas!" I called out, heading straight for the bedroom. "Dear brother, are you decent?"

"Go away, Eleanor." His voice came from behind the partially closed bedroom door.

Naturally, I ignored him. Pushing the door open, I found him wrapped in a bathrobe, looking decidedly less composed than usual. The room itself told its own story - rumpled sheets, scattered pillows, and was that a torn shirt peeking out from under the bed?

"So," I drawled, perching on the edge of an armchair. "You and Serena finally worked things out?"

Lucas gave me a look that would have frozen most people in their tracks. Unfortunately for him, I'd developed an immunity to his death glares. "It's not what you think."

"Really?" I gestured at his general state of disarray. "Because what I think is that you and Serena finally stopped dancing around each other and-"

"Eleanor Yates." His voice held that particular tone that usually meant I was pushing my luck. "Whatever scenario you're constructing in that overactive imagination of yours, I suggest you deconstruct it immediately."

But I wasn't about to let this go. Not when I'd been watching these two stubborn idiots circle each other for months. "Don't tell me..." I gasped in mock horror. "You couldn't satisfy her?"

The pillow that hit me square in the face was probably deserved.

"Out," Lucas ordered, but I caught the slight twitch at the corner of his mouth that meant he wasn't really angry. "Now."

"Fine, fine." I stood up, smoothing my dress. "But seriously, Lucas. Are you okay? Both of you?"

His expression softened slightly. "We're... figuring things out."

"That's not a no," I pointed out.

"It's not a yes either." But there was something in his voice, a warmth I hadn't heard in a long time. "Don't you have somewhere else to be?"

"Nope!" I settled back into the chair. "I'm perfectly happy waiting right here until Serena gets back. Someone needs to make sure you two actually talk instead of just making eyes at each other and pretending nothing's happening."

"Eleanor..."

"Besides," I continued cheerfully, "I want to see what kind of clothes she picks out for you. Given how your current outfit ended up, I'm curious about her taste in-"

The second pillow hit harder than the first.

"Out," Lucas repeated, but I could hear the reluctant amusement in his voice. 

"Fine," I sighed dramatically. I closed the door softly and made myself comfortable on the living room couch. 



Serena's POV

I stood in the bedroom, my back still turned to Lucas. 

"You can turn around now," Lucas said, his voice carrying the hint of amusement.

I turned slowly. The sight that greeted me made my carefully maintained composure falter for a split second. The clothes I'd hastily picked out at Saks Fifth Avenue - the black coat, white shirt, and khaki pants - somehow transformed on him into something that belonged on a magazine cover. It was unfair how effortlessly he wore them, as if they'd been tailored specifically for his tall, athletic frame.

"Does it meet your approval, Serena?" He adjusted the coat's collar, his movements deliberate and graceful.

I forced my expression into neutrality. "It's adequate. Eleanor's been waiting."

"You haven't answered my question about the fit," he persisted, taking a step closer. The afternoon sun caught his profile, highlighting the sharp angles of his face.

"The sales assistant chose well," I replied curtly, moving toward the door. "We shouldn't keep Eleanor waiting any longer."

"Always so proper, Serena." The way he said my name sent an unwanted shiver down my spine. "Except when you're not."

I shot him a warning glare. "Don't."

His grey eyes held mine, filled with an intensity that made the room feel suddenly too small. "Don't what? Remind you of how well you know my measurements?"

"This isn't appropriate," I managed, my hand finding the doorknob.

"Says the woman who bought me underwear." His low chuckle followed me as I yanked the door open and stepped into the hallway.

The sound of Eleanor's exasperated sigh greeted us as we entered the living room. She sat perched on the edge of the sofa. "Finally! I was beginning to think you two had forgotten about dinner entirely."

"My apologies," Lucas said smoothly, the picture of sophisticated charm in his new attire. "Serena was kind enough to provide me with more suitable clothing."

Eleanor's eyes widened slightly as she took in his appearance, then darted between us with poorly concealed interest. "Well, Serena, I must say you have excellent taste. Though I'm curious why Lucas needed new clothes in the first place?"

"A minor inconvenience," I cut in before Lucas could respond. "Shall we discuss dinner?"

"Dinner's been ready for quite a while," she said with a light laugh. "I'll have Walter bring it out now."
###chapter 161
Serena's POV

After dinner, Eleanor and I lounged in the living room, sharing a bowl of fresh fruit. Lucas had left for the police station to handle the Ian situation, leaving us to a peaceful moment.

"These strawberries are amazing," Eleanor commented, reaching for another one. "Want one?"

I accepted the fruit, enjoying the simple pleasure of casual companionship. It was strange how natural it felt, sitting here with Eleanor as if we'd known each other for years. "It's nice to just relax for once."

"You should do it more often," she replied, stretching out on the plush sofa. "All work and no play makes Serena a dull girl."

I rolled my eyes but couldn't suppress a smile. Eleanor had a way of making everything feel lighter, less complicated. While I reviewed some work emails on my tablet, she flipped through TV channels, providing running commentary on everything from reality shows to news programs.

Life felt almost normal. Then my phone buzzed with a news alert.

"BREAKING: Whitmore Heir Accused of Kidnapping StarRiver Group CEO"

My fingers froze over the tablet screen. Eleanor must have noticed my reaction because she immediately sat up straighter.

"What is it?"

"The news about Ian's attempted assault just broke," I said, scanning the article. The details were surprisingly accurate - the hotel location, the drugged drink.

Eleanor leaned over to read over my shoulder. "That scumbag? He always seemed so proper. How disgusting."

I continued reading, pieces clicking into place. The timing was too perfect, the details too precise. This wasn't just a leak - it was calculated exposure.

"Something's not right," I murmured, more to myself than Eleanor.

"What do you mean? Isn't it good that he's being exposed?"

I shook my head slowly. "Think about it. Who would benefit most from this story breaking right now?"

Understanding dawned on Eleanor's face. "Nina?"

"She set up the situation, probably recorded everything, and now she's using it to destroy both Ian and me." I couldn't help but admire the calculated cruelty of it. "If I try to deny it, I look like I'm protecting him. If I confirm it, I'm the victim of a scandal that will overshadow everything else about me."

"That's..." Eleanor seemed at a loss for words. "That's genuinely evil."

My phone buzzed again - a message from Lucas.

"Want me to handle the press?"

I stared at the message for a long moment. It would be easy to let him fix this, to use his influence to bury the story. But something made me hesitate.

"No," I typed back. "Let it play out."

I know Lucas's concern, but honestly, I'm not worried about the media circus. This isn't my first rodeo with the press - I've weathered worse storms before. 

What's actually interesting is watching how this is affecting Ian and the entire Whitmore family. They've always been so careful about their public image. Now? They're the ones scrambling to contain the damage. 

Eleanor watched me curiously. "You're not going to try to stop it?"

"Why should I?" I set my phone down, reaching for my coffee. "Nina wants to play chess? Let her. She just sacrificed her strongest piece."

"Ian?"

I nodded. "She probably thought she was being clever, setting up a situation where she could expose both Ian's kidnapping and my 'scandal'. But she forgot something important."

"What's that?"

"I have nothing to be ashamed of. Ian's the one who tried to drug me. He's the one who'll face criminal charges. And if the press wants to speculate about Lucas being my knight in shining armor?" I shrugged. "That's hardly a scandal."

Eleanor's smile was appreciative. "You're actually going to let Nina's plan backfire on her."

"I'm going to let her dig her own grave," I corrected. "The best revenge isn't plotting against your enemies - it's sitting back and watching them destroy themselves."

"I think I'm going to turn in early," I said, standing up. The events of the past twenty-four hours were finally catching up with me.

"Want company? We could have a proper girls' night, face masks and all?"

The offer was tempting, but I needed space to process everything. "Rain check? I just need some sleep."

Eleanor nodded understanding. "Call if you need anything. Even just to talk."

I nodded and walked toward my bedroom. "Good night."

I saw Ian Whitmore's tortured face as I walked into the interrogation room. For a moment, I almost didn't recognize him. The man sitting there, shoulders hunched and hair disheveled, seemed a far cry from the polished figure who once dominated Whitemore International.

His white dress shirt, usually pristine, was wrinkled and stained. Dark circles rimmed his bloodshot eyes, and a day's worth of stubble shadowed his jaw. 

"What are you doing here?" His voice came out hoarse, barely containing the rage simmering beneath the surface.

"I came to see how far you've fallen," I replied, my voice steady despite the tumult of emotions churning inside me. "It's quite a view from here."

Ian's hands clenched into fists on the metal table, knuckles white with tension. "Enough, Serena! Just shut up!" He tried to stand, the chair scraping against the floor with an ugly screech. The officer stepped forward immediately, a hand raised in warning. Ian slowly sank back down, but the fury in his eyes only intensified.

"Mr. Whitmore," the officer warned, his tone professional but firm.

I watched Ian struggle to compose himself, noting how his breathing came in short, sharp bursts. 

"You still don't see it, do you?" I pulled out my phone, pulling up the trending headlines. "Nina played you like a puppet, and you danced exactly how she wanted."

"You're lying!" The words exploded from him, desperation evident in every syllable. "This is just another one of your manipulations. You've always been jealous of what Nina and I have."

A bitter laugh escaped me. "Jealous? Of what exactly? Your brilliant plan that ended with you in handcuffs while she's probably sipping champagne somewhere, celebrating your downfall?"

Ian's face contorted, a mix of denial and dawning horror fighting for dominance. "She wouldn't... she couldn't..."

"But she did." I set the phone down on the table, screen facing up. The headlines glared accusingly: 'Nina Sinclair Distances Herself from Whitmore Scandal', 'Exclusive: Nina Sinclair's Shocking Revelations about Ex-Partner's Schemes'.

"She wouldn't dare," he whispered, but I could see the certainty crumbling in his eyes.

"She already has. While you're sitting here taking the fall, she's out there rewriting the narrative. You were never anything more than a convenient tool, Ian. Just like you tried to make me."

His shoulders slumped, the last vestiges of his arrogance finally cracking. "Is this what you came for? To gloat?"

I studied him for a moment, remembering the man I'd once thought I loved. How young and foolish I'd been, mistaking his controlling nature for strength, his manipulation for care.

"No," I said finally. "I came to make sure you understood exactly how thoroughly you'd been played."
###chapter 162
Ian's POV

I refused to look at the phone Serena held out. Everything seemed to mock my current state. 

"She wasn't even there," I said, my voice harder than I intended. "How could she have taken these photos?"

My mind raced to Nina's face, her gentle smile, the way she'd look at me with those adoring eyes. She loved me. She'd told me countless times how much she loved me. This had to be another one of Serena's manipulations.

"Think about it, Ian." Serena's voice cut through my thoughts, maddeningly calm. "Who knew exactly where you'd be that night?"

My fingers gripped the edge of the metal table. "You're trying to confuse me. Nina wouldn't-"

"The hotel room. The timing. The exact location." She laid out each word like a precise incision. "How did everything align so perfectly?"

A bead of cold sweat rolled down my temple. The officer shifted his weight by the door, and suddenly the room felt even smaller. I could feel my breathing becoming irregular, but I fought to maintain control.

"No..." I whispered, more to myself than to her. Nina loves me. She loves me so much she'd lose herself for me. She wouldn't... she couldn't...

"The cameras were installed before you arrived," Serena continued mercilessly. "Who could have arranged that, Ian?"

My hand trembled as I finally reached for her phone. The images were crystal clear - angles that couldn't have been taken in the moment. Planned. My stomach lurched as the implications began to sink in.

"This is impossible," I muttered, but the conviction in my voice was wavering. Memories started flooding back - Nina's insistence on that particular hotel, her detailed questions about my plans, the way she'd seemed almost... eager.

"And here's something you might find interesting." Serena swiped to another screen. "The truth about that night years ago, when I was drugged."

The phone clattered from my suddenly nerveless fingers onto the table. "What are you talking about?"

"Nina knew. She knew about the drugs, Ian. She helped plan it."

"No!" The word burst from me, but it sounded hollow even to my own ears. My body had started shaking, fine tremors I couldn't control. "You're lying..."

But even as I said it, pieces were falling into place. Nina's strange smile when we'd discussed that night. Her detailed knowledge of events she shouldn't have known about. The way she'd sometimes slip and mention things that had happened when she supposedly wasn't there.

"Enough, Serena..." My voice cracked. "I don't want to hear any more..."

"She even tried to seduce Lucas," Serena delivered the final blow almost gently. "Did you know that? While you were planning your revenge against me, she was trying to work her way into his bed."

The world tilted sideways. My vision blurred, and I could feel bile rising in my throat. The perfectly constructed reality I'd built around Nina - her love, her devotion, her innocence - shattered like glass.

"No..." The word came out as a broken whisper. My body was shaking uncontrollably now, hands gripping the table edge so hard my knuckles turned white. 

I remembered Nina's face when I told her about my plans for revenge. Not surprise. Not shock. Just that small, satisfied smile I'd mistaken for understanding. I'd been nothing but a puppet in her elaborate game.

"Why..." The question burned in my throat. "Why would she..."

"Because you were useful," Serena said simply. "Just like I was useful to you, once upon a time."

The truth of it hit me like a physical blow. I'd been so convinced of my own cleverness, my own control. But Nina had been playing a longer game, a deeper game. And I'd walked right into it, blind and willing.

My head fell forward, shoulders slumping in defeat. 

"Mr. Whitmore?" The officer's voice seemed to come from far away. "Do you need a moment?"

I couldn't respond. The room was spinning, memories of Nina playing on endless loop in my mind. Each sweet word, each loving gesture, now tainted with the poison of truth. My chest felt too tight, each breath a struggle.

"The press release goes out in an hour," Serena said, gathering her things. "Nina's official statement distancing herself from your 'unfortunate actions.' Her words, not mine."

A broken laugh escaped me, bitter and hollow. Of course she'd already prepared her escape route. 


As Serena turned to leave, I managed to raise my head. "Was any of it real?" I asked, hating the desperation in my voice. "Did she ever..."

"You should ask yourself that question," Serena replied, her hand on the door.

Twenty-four hours in police custody had taught me the value of control - of keeping my emotions in check even as my world crumbled around me. I sat very still in the metal chair, my fingers absently smoothing nonexistent wrinkles from my wrinkled suit.

I wanted to rage. To scream. To throw myself across the table and... but what would that accomplish?

As she turned toward the door, panic seized me. "Serena..." My voice came out rougher than I intended. I cleared my throat and tried again. "Did you ever truly care for me?"

She paused, her hand on the door handle. For a moment, I thought she wouldn't answer. Then she turned, and the look in her eyes wasn't what I expected. Not hatred. Not triumph. Just a tired sort of sadness.

"Isn't it obvious?" she said quietly. "I wouldn't have spent countless nights working, attending endless social events, for someone I didn't care about."

The words hit me like a physical blow. Memories flooded back - Serena staying up until dawn working on proposals, networking tirelessly at events I'd insisted she attend, sacrificing her weekends to help build my dream. I'd taken it all for granted, convinced myself she'd done it for her own ambition.

"I..." The words stuck in my throat. What could I possibly say now?

"You know what the difference was?" She wasn't looking at me anymore, but somewhere past me. "I never had to pretend with you. Until you decided that wasn't enough."

My chest tightened painfully. God, she was right. She'd never played games, never manipulated. She'd just been... Serena. And I'd thrown it away for Nina's calculated affection, her careful performance of devotion.

I stared at my hands, unable to meet her gaze. "I convinced myself you were using me," I admitted, the words bitter on my tongue. "That someone like you couldn't possibly..." I trailed off, finally recognizing the truth. "I was scared. Of not being enough. Of you realizing that and leaving. So I left first."

A single tear escaped, rolling down my cheek. I didn't bother wiping it away. What was the point of pride now?

"Nina knew exactly what to say," I continued, more to myself than to Serena. "She made me feel powerful, in control. But it was all an act, wasn't it? While you..." I couldn't finish the sentence.

"Take care of yourself, Ian."
###chapter 163
Nina's POV

I spotted her in the police station corridor. My lips curved into the sweet smile.

"Sister!" I called out, my voice dripping with artificial warmth. She turned, those sharp eyes of hers taking in my carefully crafted appearance.

Inside, I was laughing. Look at her, pretending to be above it all, when she'd clearly come to gloat over Ian's downfall. Not that I blamed her - I'd have done the same. In fact, I was about to do much worse.

The officer led me through the hallways to the holding area. My watch showed 2:30 PM - perfect timing for the press to catch wind of my "emotional visit" to my "beloved" Ian. The story practically wrote itself: the devastated girlfriend, standing by her man until the bitter truth forced her to make the heartbreaking decision to walk away.

When they brought him in, I had to suppress a smirk. Oh, how the mighty had fallen. Ian Whitmore, now looking like something the cat dragged in. His suit was wrinkled, his hair disheveled, and those eyes - those once-proud eyes were red-rimmed and desperate.

"Nina..." He reached for me across the table, and I recoiled instinctively.

"Disgusting," I said, not bothering to hide my revulsion. The hurt that flashed across his face was delicious. "Don't touch me with those hands."

"Nina, please..." His voice cracked. "You have to believe me. I did it all for us."

A laugh escaped me, sharp and cruel. "For us? Oh, Ian. There never was an 'us.' There was just you, being pathetically easy to manipulate."

He stared at me, uncomprehending. The time for pretense was over.

"Look at yourself," I continued, enjoying every word. "The great Ian Whitmore, reduced to this. Do you really think someone like me would want anything to do with you now?"

"What are you saying?" His hands were trembling on the table.

I leaned forward, dropping my voice to a stage whisper. "Should I spell it out for you? I never loved you, Ian. You were just Serena's man, and I wanted everything that was hers. It was almost too easy - a few batting eyelashes, some practiced smiles, and you came running like an eager puppy."

The color drained from his face. "You're lying. All those times we..."

"Were a performance," I cut him off. "And not even my best one. But you were so desperate to believe that someone like me could actually love someone like you." I laughed again. "God, your insecurity made it almost boring. No challenge at all."

He lunged across the table, hands reaching for my throat, but the officer was faster. As they wrestled him back into his chair, I didn't even flinch. His rage only made this sweeter.

"I came here today to put on a show for the media," I said, smoothing my skirt. "To ensure my clean break from your scandal. I could have left you with your delusions, but..." I shrugged elegantly. "Where's the fun in that?"

"You'll pay for this," he snarled, struggling against the officer's restraining grip. "When I tell everyone-"

"Tell them what?" I stood, gathering my bag. "That you were stupid enough to let yourself be played? That you threw away a woman who actually loved you for someone who saw you as nothing but a stepping stone?" I checked my reflection in my compact mirror, adjusting my lipstick. "Go ahead. It'll just make you look even more pathetic."

I turned to the officer, my practiced smile back in place. "I think we're done here. I have a press conference to attend - you know, to express my shock and disappointment at discovering Mr. Whitmore's true nature."

I savored the sight of Ian's broken expression one last time.

"Enjoy your cage, you rabid dog," I said, letting my voice drip with contempt. "You can spend the rest of your life going crazy in here."

He lunged forward again, but the officers were ready this time. As they restrained him, I couldn't help but laugh. Such a predictable reaction - like a puppet dancing on strings.

"You think this is funny?" he snarled.

"Actually, yes." I adjusted my scarf with deliberate elegance. "Watching you destroy yourself has been quite entertaining. Though I must admit, you made it almost too easy."

The door closed behind me with a satisfying click, shutting off his incoherent rage. Finally, I could be rid of this plague. In the quiet of the corridor, I began my transformation. The mask of the devastated girlfriend slid into place with practiced ease.

My fingers trembled slightly as I dabbed at my eyes with a tissue. The walk to the media area was like preparing to step onto a stage. I could already hear the clamor of reporters, see the flash of cameras through the precinct's glass doors. Time to give them what they came for - the heartbroken society darling, betrayed by the man she trusted.

I pushed open the doors, letting my eyes widen with practiced surprise at the wall of cameras. The flashbulbs exploded, and I instinctively raised a hand to shield my face - a gesture that would look perfectly vulnerable in tomorrow's papers.

"Miss Sinclair! How do you feel about Mr. Whitmore's arrest?"

I let my lower lip tremble. "I... I never knew..." My voice cracked perfectly. "Until I saw the news..."

The reporters pressed closer, hungry for more. My security detail formed a protective circle around me, adding to the drama of the moment. Perfect - it would make me look even more sympathetic.

"Did you have any idea about his plans?"

I shook my head, letting tears well up in my eyes. "How could I have known? The man I thought I knew..." I paused for effect, dabbing at my eyes with a handkerchief. "The man I loved would never have done something so terrible. Especially not to my sister."

The cameras clicked furiously at the mention of Serena. I could already see the headlines forming: "Devastated Nina Sinclair Stands by Family Despite Heartbreak."

"He asked for my help," I continued, my voice barely above a whisper - forcing them to lean in, to strain to catch every word. "He wanted me to help reduce his sentence. But I refused." I straightened my shoulders, letting steel enter my voice. "The law must take its course. No matter how much it hurts."

A reporter pressed forward. "How do you feel about Mr. Whitmore now?"

This was the moment I'd been waiting for. I let my carefully constructed composure crack, tears spilling down my cheeks. "Even if he hadn't done this to my sister... I could never forgive such a betrayal of trust. The Ian Whitmore I knew was an illusion, and I..." I broke off, pressing the handkerchief to my lips.

My security chief stepped forward. "Miss Sinclair needs rest. No more questions."

Right on cue, I swayed slightly, as if overcome by emotion. The photographers went wild, capturing my moment of "weakness." My security detail closed ranks, guiding me toward the waiting car.

Just before stepping in, I turned back to the cameras one last time. "I just pray that justice will be served," I said softly, letting my voice break on the last word.

The car door closed behind me, shutting out the chaos. As we pulled away from the precinct, I finally allowed myself a real smile.
###chapter 164
Nina's POV

The slam of the car door muffled the chaos of reporters behind me. Everything had gone exactly according to plan. The headlines tomorrow would paint the perfect picture: poor, betrayed Nina Sinclair, choosing justice over love.

"Back to the penthouse," I instructed my driver, already mentally planning my next moves. The destruction of Ian Whitmore was just the beginning. Soon, everyone would see-

The car lurched forward violently. My compact mirror went flying as I was thrown against the seat belt, lipstick smearing across my cheek.

"What the hell?" I snapped, my carefully maintained composure cracking. "Can't you drive properly?"

"I apologize, Miss," the driver's voice wavered. "A car suddenly changed lanes-"

"Just pay attention," I cut him off, dabbing furiously at the red streak on my face. This was exactly what I didn't need right now. I had appointments to keep, moves to make. The game was finally shifting in my favor, and I couldn't afford any-

Two black SUVs smoothly boxed us in.

My heart stopped. Through the tinted windows, I could see men in dark suits emerging from the vehicles. 

"Drive!" I ordered, but we were already trapped. The men approached with practiced efficiency, their movements synchronized and purposeful. My mind raced through possibilities - kidnapping? Revenge from Serena? Or had someone else discovered-

My phone rang, displaying an unknown number. With trembling fingers, I answered.

"Miss Sinclair. I'm Rachel." The voice was cultured, and absolutely confident. "I believe you're acquainted with my security team."

I recognized that voice. "Rachel Thorne?"

"Get in the car with my security team. We need to talk in person at my estate."

My pulse quickened. Rachel Thorne - Lucas's fiancee. What could she possibly want with me?

"And why should I trust you?" I kept my voice steady, though my hands were still shaking.

"Because the enemy of your enemy is your friend." Her tone carried a smile. "And you want Sinclair Group, don't you?"

The trembling in my hands stilled. Of course. This wasn't a threat - it was an opportunity.

"I'll come," I said, already reaching for my purse. "But my driver-"

"Will be well compensated for his discretion," she finished smoothly. "Now, shall we?"

The drive to the Thorne estate took us out of Manhattan's concrete jungle and into the manicured wilderness of the elite. Rachel's manor emerged from behind wrought iron gates - a masterpiece of classic architecture that made even my family's mansion seem modest in comparison.

Rachel Thorne waited in what appeared to be a private study. She sat in a high-backed chair, elegant in a tailored suit. Her smile was perfect and predatory.

"Nina." She gestured to the chair across from her. "Thank you for accepting my invitation."

I took the offered seat, matching her smile with my own practiced version. "How could I refuse such an... intriguing offer?"

"Indeed." She studied me for a moment, then nodded slightly, as if confirming something to herself. "I've been watching your recent moves with interest. That press conference today was particularly well played."

"You're too kind."

"Not at all. I recognize talent when I see it." She leaned forward slightly. "Which is why I think we can help each other."

"I'm listening."

"I want you to help me deal with Serena."

My heart skipped a beat, but I kept my expression neutral. "Why would I do that?"

"Because when we succeed, Sinclair Group will be yours." She said it so simply.

I allowed myself a small laugh. "Just like that?"

"Just like that." Rachel's smile didn't waver. "You've already proven yourself capable of removing obstacles. Serena is a different kind of challenge, isn't she? She has Lucas's protection now."

The mention of Lucas made my teeth clench. Yes, my dear sister had managed to snag the most eligible bachelor in Manhattan. Another thing she didn't deserve.

Rachel rose gracefully, moving to a cabinet. "Shall we discuss the details over a drink? I have an excellent Bordeaux that I've been saving for just such an occasion."

I watched as she poured two glasses of deep red wine. Everything about this situation screamed danger, but then again, hadn't I already proven I could dance with devils? And if she could really deliver what she promised...

"To new alliances," Rachel offered, extending one of the glasses to me.

I took it, allowing myself a real smile this time. "To getting exactly what we deserve."

The wine's rich aroma filled my nostrils as I swirled the crystal glass, watching the deep red liquid. 

I forced my fingers to remain steady on the wine glass. "Good," I said, keeping my voice level despite the excitement threatening to burst through my chest. "What do you need me to do?"

Rachel's smile widened slightly. She reached into an leather briefcase and withdrew a folder. "I have detailed plans, but first..." She slid the folder across the desk. "A gesture of good faith."

Inside were share transfer documents - ten percent of Sinclair Group's total shares. My heart nearly stopped.

"These shares," Rachel continued, watching my reaction carefully, "were acquired from other Sinclair shareholders. Your father won't notice - I've made sure of that. After we succeed, I'll help you acquire another thirty-one percent. You'll be the largest shareholder. Everything will be under your control."

The papers trembled slightly in my hands. I could almost taste it - the power, the control, everything that should have been mine from the start. But years of playing the game had taught me caution.

"What if," I began carefully, setting the folder down, "you don't transfer Sinclair Group after we succeed? Someone of your status... I couldn't really challenge you. These kinds of deals aren't exactly legal." I met her gaze steadily. "Not that I doubt your integrity, but trust should go both ways for maximum efficiency."

Rachel laughed - a genuine sound that somehow made her more dangerous. "Smart girl. You're absolutely right." She produced another document. "Which is why this agreement has already been legally prepared, with specific conditions and timelines. My reputation may protect me from many things, but a properly executed contract? That's binding even for someone like me."

I scanned the document, my legal training kicking in. The terms were clear, the conditions specific. It was real. This was real.

"Of course," Rachel added, her tone deceptively casual, "this agreement remains between us. No third parties need to be involved."

I looked up from the papers, matching her meaningful gaze. "I've never met you today, Mrs. Thorne."

"Excellent." She leaned back, satisfied. "Now, about Serena..."

"Give me some time," I said, standing as our meeting drew to a close. "I won't disappoint you."

Rachel rose as well, extending her hand. "I'm sure you won't. The car will take you home. Remember - discretion is everything."

As I walked through the mansion's grand hallways, I allowed myself to finally, fully smile.
###chapter 165
Serena's POV

The news about Ian's suicide in custody hit the headlines around noon. The news itself didn't shock me as much as my own reaction to it.

Ian Whitmore had chosen death over facing the consequences of his actions. The Whitmore Group's stock had plummeted to record lows after the allegations surfaced, and his father's public denouncement had been the final nail in their corporate coffin. Ian had always been more concerned with appearance than substance. The prospect of prison, public shame, Nina's betrayal and financial ruin must have been too much to him.

My phone buzzed, displaying Lucas's name. I stared at it, my finger hovering over the screen. We hadn't spoken since that night, though he had sent a brief message checking on me after Ian's death was announced.

"Serena." His voice carried its usual quiet authority.

I remained silent, watching the city lights.

"Milo and Stella..." He paused, and I could picture him in his office, probably standing by his own window. "They miss you. They've been crying, asking to see you."

The mention of the children cracked my carefully maintained composure. "I'll come over tonight."

"Thank you." Two simple words, but his relief was palpable.

I arrived at the Harrington residence just after eight. Walter opened the door, his familiar presence oddly comforting. The house felt different now - memories of previous visits ghost-like in their intensity.

"Serena!" Stella's voice rang out as she ran down the stairs, her brother close behind. She clutched a sketchbook to her chest, her eyes bright with excitement.

I knelt to catch them both, their small arms wrapping around my neck. The familiar scent of Stella's strawberry shampoo and Milo's clean, soapy smell brought an unexpected tightness to my throat.

We spent the next hour in their playroom. I helped Milo with his dinosaur puzzle while Stella showed me her recent artwork. Their chatter about school and friends filled the space, making it easy to pretend nothing had changed.

When bedtime came, they both insisted I read their story. I sat between their beds, reading about a brave princess who saved her kingdom. Stella fell asleep first, her hand still clutching my sleeve. Milo lasted until the final page, his eyes drooping as I tucked the blanket around him.

Lucas was waiting in the living room when I came downstairs. The soft lighting cast shadows across his face, making his expression unreadable.

"Would you like them to stay at my place for a few days?" I asked, remaining standing. "I could drive them to and from school."

"Can you manage that with your schedule?" His tone was neutral, but I caught the slight edge. "They start school at nine, and you're usually in the office by eight-thirty."

"I can arrange it," I replied, though we both knew it wasn't practical.

"Okay, I'll think about it," he said, a smile playing on his lips.

"Walter prepared honey lemon tea for you." He rose and walked to the kitchen, returning with a steaming cup. "It would be a shame to waste it."

I wanted to refuse, but the slight roughness in my throat from hours of reading betrayed me. The warm liquid soothed my voice, carrying the perfect balance of sweet and tart.
When I stood to leave, Lucas was already by the door. "I'll follow you home."
"I drove here," I replied curtly, a reflexive coldness creeping into my voice. The familiar tension returned.
"I know." His tone brooked no argument, carrying that quiet authority.
I pressed my lips together, suppressing the urge to challenge him. There was something infuriating about his protectiveness, yet beneath my irritation stirred an emotion I refused to acknowledge. My fingers unconsciously tightened around my car keys.
The drive home was a study in restraint. My white Audi led the way through night traffic, with his Maybach maintaining a constant distance behind. I could see his headlights in my rearview mirror. Every time I changed lanes or turned a corner, that gleam of light followed.
At my building, I stepped out of the car and walked straight to the elevator, not looking back. But I knew he was watching, waiting until the doors closed behind me. In the elevator's solitude, I finally allowed myself to exhale. 

Over the past few days, dinner at the Harrington residence had become a comforting routine. Walter's culinary skills never failed to impress, and the children's eager faces when I arrived made any exhaustion from work fade away. Tonight was no different - the aroma of freshly baked garlic bread filled the dining room as I helped Stella into her chair.

"Mom, is this Walter's special pasta?" Milo asked, eyeing the steaming plate before him.

"Yes, he made it especially for you two tonight." I smiled, watching him twirl the pasta with practiced precision.

Stella took a small, careful bite. "It's delicious," she whispered, her eyes bright with appreciation. 

"Mom?" Milo looked up from his plate, his expression suddenly serious. "This Friday, we're having a a sports day at school." His voice rose with excitement. "Could you come?"

Before I could respond, Stella added quietly, "We both signed up for the relay race." Her fingers fidgeted with her napkin, betraying her anticipation despite her controlled tone.

"Of course I'll come." The words left my mouth without hesitation. The way Stella's shoulders relaxed slightly.

"Really?" Milo bounced in his seat. "Promise?"

"Promise." I reached out to ruffle his hair. "I wouldn't miss it for anything."

Dinner continued with animated discussions about their upcoming races. Stella shared details about her team's practice sessions, while Milo enthusiastically demonstrated his running technique right there at the table.

After helping them with homework and tucking them in for the night, I headed toward the living room to collect my things. The house had become familiar territory.

As I approached the living room, voices drifted out - one distinctly Lucas's, the other female and elegant.

"The children seem happier lately," Rachel Thorne was saying, her voice carrying that perfect mix of warmth and sophistication. I froze just outside the doorway.

"They are," Lucas replied, his tone neutral.

I stepped into view, and Rachel's eyes met mine. She sat gracefully on the sofa, holding Lucas's coffee cup - the one I'd seen him use countless times.

"Serena, what a coincidence." Rachel's smile was perfectly pleasant. She took another sip from his cup, the gesture somehow both casual and intimate.

My throat tightened. She knew. She had to know about my daily visits, even about my relationship with the children. Yet here she sat, completely at ease, as if my presence was inconsequential.
Was she genuinely indifferent to Lucas because she didn't care for him, despite their engagement? Or was she so confident in her position that she viewed me as no threat at all? Perhaps this was all an elaborate performance, carefully crafted for Lucas.
Whatever her reasons, the reality remained unchanged - my presence here was inappropriate while Lucas and Rachel's engagement stood. 
"You must be tired," Rachel continued, her tone sympathetic. "Coming here every evening after work."

"It's fine." My voice sounded distant to my own ears. "I should go."

I saw Lucas step forward. "Let me walk you out."

"No need, it's still early," I refused immediately.

"I didn't get to say goodbye to Milo and Stella," I said. "Could you explain to them that I left?"

I slipped on my shoes and headed for the door. Despite my clear dismissal, I could hear Lucas's footsteps behind me.

As I reached the elevator, I turned and deliberately positioned myself between him and the entrance. Lucas met my gaze steadily.

"Lucas, in what capacity are you escorting me?" I challenged. "Your fiancée is waiting upstairs, yet you're walking another woman out. Have you considered how she might feel? As a man, you really shouldn't stoop to this level of behavior!"

"About Rachel and me-"

"That's your business," I cut him off sharply. "I don't need to know, nor am I interested in knowing. I won't be coming over in the evenings anymore."

Lucas remained silent, his expression darkened.

I stepped into the elevator without another word and pressed the button, watching the doors close between us. There was no point in having any emotional reaction to Lucas Harrington anymore.

The past was simply that - the past.
###chapter 166
Rachel's POV

I watched Lucas from my position near the elevator, studying the subtle changes in his expression as Serena's words hung in the air. In all the years I'd known him, I'd never seen him react to any woman this way - the barely perceptible tension in his jaw, the slight narrowing of his eyes. It was... unsettling.

Over the past decade, I'd observed countless women try to get close to him. Socialites, business partners' daughters, even celebrities - all had failed to capture his attention. He'd maintained an impenetrable wall of polite indifference, making his current behavior all the more striking. The only woman who'd ever been allowed into his inner circle was me, his children's godmother and old family friend.

Until Serena Sinclair.

"Lucas," I broke the silence, my voice carrying just the right note of apology. "Did I come at a bad time?"

He didn't respond, his gaze still fixed on the closed elevator doors. His silence felt charged with unspoken thoughts.

"Your grandfather asked me to visit," I continued softly. "I should have called ahead. I'm truly sorry for creating such an awkward situation."

That finally drew his attention. "I'll take you to your hotel," he said, his voice returning to its usual measured tone.

During the ride down in the elevator, I found myself remembering our time together in London years ago. We'd developed an easy friendship then, built on mutual understanding and respect. I'd maintained my dignified distance, believing there would always be time. 

What a miscalculation that had been. If only I'd been less proud, less certain of my position in those years we spent abroad. I could have...

"I heard about Milo and Stella's sports day tomorrow," I ventured, carefully casual.

"Mm." His noncommittal response would have discouraged most people, but I knew better.

"Your grandfather suggested I should join you." I paused, then added with careful hesitation, "I was going to decline, but he insisted it would be good for the children to have familiar faces there."

Lucas's hands remained steady on the steering wheel. "Fine." That single word sent a wave of satisfaction through me. 



Serena's POV

The buzzing of my phone interrupted the morning briefing. I glanced at the screen - Milo's number. My finger hovered over the decline button, but something made me pause.

"Excuse me," I said to the room full of executives, their expressions a mix of surprise and mild annoyance. "I need to take this."

"Mommy!" Milo's voice burst through the speaker, full of that irresistible mix of excitement and complaint that only he could manage. "You didn't forget about today, right?"

Before I could answer, I heard a shuffle and Stella's more measured tones. "Mom, we've been practicing really hard for the competition. You promised to come."

My eyes darted to the stack of contracts on my desk, then to the waiting faces around the conference table. "Of course I remember," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "I wouldn't miss it."

"You sound busy," Stella observed, ever perceptive. "We can text you the exact timing-"

"No!" Milo's voice cut in, closer to the phone again. "Mommy has to promise right now. Say it!"

I found myself smiling despite the pressure. "I promise, Milo. I'll be there."

After ending the call, I turned back to the room. "We'll need to expedite this review. I have a prior commitment at eleven."

Twenty minutes later, my phone lit up with a message from Stella. She'd sent a photo of the program, their competition time carefully circled in neat red pen. Below it, she'd written: "I've marked the important parts so you won't miss anything. We understand if you need to leave right after."

The thoughtfulness of it made my throat tight. When did this little girl become so considerate? So aware of the complexities of adult life?

Two hours later, I managed to slip into the school auditorium just as the lights were dimming. The back row offered enough shadow to remain relatively unnoticed, though I could see Milo scanning the crowd, his head turning left and right like an eager puppy. Stella, by contrast, stood perfectly still on stage, but I caught the subtle way her eyes swept the audience. When she found me, the corner of her mouth lifted in a slight smile.

Their performance was beautiful - a piano duet that showcased both their personalities. Milo's part was bright and energetic, while Stella played with a grace beyond her years. I found myself holding my breath at certain passages, not wanting to miss a single note.

It wasn't until the applause began that I noticed Rachel standing near the front row. She was speaking to Lucas, her hand resting casually on his arm as she laughed at something he'd said. The familiar sight sent an unexpected pang through my chest.

"Mommy?" 

I startled slightly. Stella had materialized beside me, still in her performance dress. Her eyes followed my gaze to where Rachel and Lucas stood.

"You're much warmer than she is," Stella said quietly, slipping her small hand into mine.

"Stella-" I began, but was cut off by Milo barreling into us at full speed.

"Did you see? Did you watch the whole thing? I only missed two notes and Stella helped me catch up and-"

"You were both wonderful," I said, pulling him into our little circle. Over their heads, I caught Lucas watching us, his expression unreadable. Rachel was saying something to him, but his eyes remained fixed on our little group.
###chapter 167
Serena's POV

After leaving the auditorium, Milo went off to his high jump event, and Stella headed to her gymnastics competition. I went up to the stands to watch, looking for a good vantage point.

Milo competed first in the high jump. His small frame gathered energy like a coiled spring before launching skyward. Each successful jump brought enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, particularly from Rachel, whose voice carried across the field. 

"Go, Milo! You're amazing!" Rachel's voice pierced through the ambient noise as Milo prepared for his sprint. She was standing now, waving enthusiastically from her premium seat near the front.

I noticed Milo's slight discomfort at the attention, his cheeks flushing pink even as he cleared the bar.

Stella's gymnastics performance came next. Where her brother was all explosive energy, she moved with a grace that seemed to suspend time. Her ribbon traced delicate patterns through the air as she performed, each movement precise and controlled. The audience's applause felt almost reverent. I found myself holding my breath during her more complex sequences, though my face remained carefully neutral.

After their competitions, the transition to the indoor pool brought an unexpected confrontation. As parents and students moved between venues, Rachel spotted me in the crowd.

"Miss Sinclair!" Her voice carried that particular pitch of calculated surprise. "You're here too? I haven't seen you all morning - where have you been hiding?"

Before I could respond, Stella materialized at my side. "Mom's very busy," she said, her tone perfectly polite yet somehow final. "We're just grateful she made time to come."

Rachel's smile flickered for just a moment. "Oh, you should have sat with us in the front! You missed such a great view of Milo's events. He was absolutely incredible in the high jump, wasn't he?"

I noticed how she deliberately avoided mentioning Stella's performance. Beside me, Stella's small hand slipped into mine. "Mom saw my routine," she said quietly. "I saw her applauding."

The swimming competition began with its usual controlled chaos. Milo stood at the starting block in his navy swimsuit, looking simultaneously excited and self-conscious. Rachel had positioned herself right by the pool's edge, her enthusiasm drawing attention from other parents.

I stayed back with Stella, who held up a small handmade sign reading "GO MILO!" in careful block letters. When Milo glanced our way, I gave him a subtle thumbs up. His answering smile was immediate and genuine.

The race itself was over quickly. Milo's form was excellent, his strokes powerful and efficient. Stella counted his laps under her breath, her grip on my hand tightening with each turn. When he touched the wall first, several lengths ahead of his closest competitor. I couldn't help feeling proud. Milo had inherited my swimming talent. 

In the stands, Stella was clapping enthusiastically for her brother. She turned to me, her eyes sparkling with admiration. "Mommy, Milo swims so well!"

I nodded with a warm smile. After the swimming competition, Milo went to the locker room to change.

Lucas left first with Rachel Thorne. I wondered if he was deliberately giving me some time alone with the kids.

Either way, Stella and I stayed behind, waiting by the entrance for Milo to come out.




Milo's POV

The warm shower did little to wash away my exhaustion after the swimming meet, but I couldn't stop smiling. First place. Dad would be proud when I showed him the medal tonight. 

The locker room was mostly empty now. Most kids had already left with their parents, their excited voices fading into distant echoes. I carefully hung my wet swimsuit on the hook, making sure it wouldn't touch my clean clothes. Dad taught me to always keep things orderly, even small details matter.

The sudden slam of my locker door nearly made me jump. I turned around to find Tommy Wilson glaring at me, his face red with anger. He had come in second place, trailing behind me by almost two seconds. I recognized the swimming gear he wore - the same brand Dad got for me, but his was still new while mine was worn from countless practice sessions.

"You stole my first place, you little brat!" Tommy's voice echoed against the tiled walls.

I took a careful step back, maintaining eye contact. "I won fair and square." 

"Fair?" Tommy sneered, taking a step closer. "Do you know who my father is? The new swimming pool? That's from my family's donation!"

I swallowed hard but kept my spine straight. "So what? That doesn't change how fast we swim."

The punch came without warning, catching me in the stomach. I stumbled backward, my shoulder hitting the metal lockers with a dull thud. The pain made my eyes water, but I blinked the tears away. 

"Hey guys, look who needs a lesson!" Tommy's voice carried through the locker room. Heavy footsteps approached - two older boys I recognized from the senior division. They were both significantly larger than me, with matching cruel smiles that made my stomach tighten.

"Hold him," Tommy ordered, and before I could react, rough hands grabbed my arms. The chlorine smell from the pool was replaced by their sweaty grip as they pinned me against the lockers.

Tommy stepped closer, his face inches from mine. "Call me boss and promise to lose next time. Then maybe we'll let you go."

"Never." The word came out automatically, even as fear crawled up my spine.

His face twisted with rage. "Wrong answer, rich boy." He nodded to his friends. "The garbage can. Let's see how he likes that."

My blood ran cold. The garbage can in the corner was overflowing with wet paper towels and used band-aids. Just the thought of being anywhere near it made my skin crawl. I started struggling harder, but the older boys' grip was like iron.

"Stop! Let me go!" My voice cracked, betraying my panic. They dragged me closer to the garbage can, my feet scraping against the floor. The smell got stronger, making my stomach turn. 

"Not so tough now, are you?" Tommy laughed, watching as they forced my head closer to the garbage. "Maybe next time you'll remember your place."

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block out the nauseating smell. The pain I was bracing for never came. Confused, I slowly opened my eyes, wondering why they'd hesitated-

That's when it hit me. The nauseating wave of stench came first, followed by a rush of putrid water. The garbage can lid slammed down on my head with brutal force, the impact sending me crashing to the floor. Their raucous laughter filled the locker room as I lay there, soaked in filthy water with trash clinging to my hair and face.

Through watering eyes, I could see their distorted faces above me, still laughing. Tommy's voice cut through the ringing in my ears: "Now that's what I call taking out the trash!"

My hands trembled as I tried to push myself up, but my head spun from the impact. Something warm trickled down my temple - I wasn't sure if it was dirty water or blood. The chlorine-scented air mixed with the garbage stench, making me gag.

"Should we give him another round?" one of the older boys asked, reaching for the garbage can again.

I wanted to say something defiant, but my vision was blurring.
###chapter 168
Serena's POV

Something was wrong.

I'd been waiting outside the locker room for far too long. Stella shifted restlessly beside me, her small hand tightening around mine. The swimming competition had ended fifteen minutes ago, and while other children had emerged from the changing rooms, there was still no sign of Milo.

"Should we check on him?" Stella whispered.

Before I could answer, a muffled thud echoed from behind the door, followed by cruel laughter. My heart stumbled. 

"Stay here," I ordered Stella, already moving. "Don't come in, no matter what."

I pushed through the door, the heavy chlorine scent hitting me first. Then I saw them - three boys surrounding a smaller figure on the floor. Milo lay crumpled beside an overturned garbage can, his wet hair plastered with bits of trash. Water mixed with something darker trickled down his temple.

The world narrowed to a pinpoint of fury. 

"STEP. AWAY. FROM. HIM." Each word dropped like ice into the humid air.

The boys spun around, their smug expressions faltering as they registered my presence. Their faces hadn't appear fear. The tallest - probably thirteen or fourteen - recovered first, plastering on an innocent smile that made my fingers itch.

"We were just playing around, ma'am." That dismissive response made my blood boil. I wanted to grab them, to kick them until they understood the magnitude of their cruelty.

"Playing?" The word tasted like poison. I crossed the distance in three steps, positioning myself between them and Milo. "Is this what passes for play in your household? Assaulting smaller children?"

My hands clenched involuntarily, the urge to slap both of them rising hot and fast. But seeing Milo's small figure nearby made me pause and take a deep breath. Violence wasn't the answer, especially not in front of a child. More importantly, I needed to check if Milo was hurt.

"Milo, honey." I kept my voice steady despite the rage thundering through my veins. "Can you look at me?"

He raised his head slowly, and my heart clenched. His left eye was already swelling, and there was a nasty scrape along his jawline. But it was the shame in his eyes that made me want to tear the room apart.

"I... I won the race," he whispered. "They said... said I cheated."

"It's okay, sweetheart," I whispered, my voice trembling as I knelt beside Milo. My hands shook as I pulled out my phone, forcing myself to document everything. Each photo felt like another stab to my heart, but I knew I needed evidence.

"Because there's no way a kid like him could beat us fair and square," one of the other boys sneered. "Everyone knows his dad probably bought the judges."

The door burst open before I could respond. A woman in athleisure wear strode in, her perfectly highlighted hair swinging. "Tommy? What's taking so long? We have your victory dinner reservations..."

She trailed off, taking in the scene. Her carefully lined eyes narrowed. "What's going on here?"

"Your son and his friends just assaulted a younger child," I said, my voice arctic. "I have photos. Would you like to see them before or after I call the police?"

"Assault? Don't be ridiculous." She waved a manicured hand. "Boys will be boys. I'm sure whatever happened was just harmless roughhousing."

"Harmless?" I helped Milo to his feet, steadying him when he swayed. "Look at him. Really look. Is this what you consider harmless?"

Two more parents arrived, drawn by the commotion. The excuses began flowing immediately - it must have been a misunderstanding, kids fight all the time, surely Milo had provoked them somehow.

"He cheated in the race," Tommy insisted, emboldened by his mother's presence. "That's why we taught him a lesson."

"Taught him a lesson?" The words felt like glass in my throat. "The only lesson here is what your parents have apparently failed to teach you about basic human decency."

"Now see here," Tommy's mother stepped forward, all pretense of politeness gone. "My son is a champion swimmer. He doesn't need to cheat to win, unlike some people who clearly bought their way-"

"Finish that sentence." My voice could have frozen hell itself. "Please, finish explaining how a child winning fairly deserves to be assaulted. I'm fascinated to hear your rationalization."

She faltered, finally seeming to register the dangerous edge in my tone. One of the other mothers tugged at her arm. "Catherine, maybe we should-"

"Should what? Let them get away with slandering my Tommy?" She jerked away. "These new money types always think they can push their way in where they don't belong. Well, I've been on the board of this club for fifteen years, and I can tell you-"

"Wait a minute," she said, her voice dripping with false recognition. "You're Serena Sinclair, aren't you? The one all over the business news lately?" Her lips curved into a cruel smile. "I didn't know you had a son. Who's the father of this bastard?"

###chapter 169
Serena's POV

Tommy and the other boys doubled over laughing, their fingers pointing at Milo like weapons. "What a bastard!" they jeered, their voices echoing off the locker room walls.

Behind me, I could feel Milo's small body trembling. The sound of his muffled sobs tore through my heart, each hitched breath like a knife. I clenched my fists. Something deep inside me shifted - a primal, protective rage.

"Watch your mouth," I said quietly, my voice carrying a warning.

But she was too far gone in her own spite to hear it. "Like mother, like son. No wonder the kid has no manners if this is his role model."

Others in the room - parents who had drifted in during the commotion - began muttering. I caught fragments of their whispers, each one designed to cut: 
"Those Sinclair women..." 
"...always in some scandal..." 
"Poor child, with a mother like that..."

I had weathered countless attacks in the corporate world, but this was different. This wasn't about business - this was about a child. About Milo.

"You know nothing about me or this child," I said, containing my anger. "But I know exactly what you are - a woman who raised her son to be a bully and coward."

A man stepped forward then, probably Tommy's father, his face red with anger. 

My fingers twitched at my side as rage coursed through me, hot and electric. Something in his entitled swagger, the way he puffed up his chest like he owned the room - it was the last straw.

"How dare you-" 

The slap echoed through the locker room. His head snapped to the side, a red mark blooming on his cheek.

"Since you failed to teach your child," I said into the stunned silence, "I'll teach him this lesson instead. Parents who fail to teach their children must bear the consequences."

The room erupted in chaos. Tommy's mother screamed something about assault, while his father recovered enough to advance menacingly toward me. The crowd pressed closer, the space suddenly feeling like a cage.

The situation was spiraling out of control faster than I could have anticipated. Tommy's father lunged forward, snatching my phone from my hand before I could react. The device clattered somewhere behind him, lost in the growing crowd of onlookers who had gathered to watch the spectacle.

"Not so powerful without your connections, are you?" he sneered, taking another step closer. His expression was even more menacing.

I backed up instinctively, guiding Milo behind me until we hit the cold metal of the lockers. The crowd had effectively blocked any path to the exit, and the air in the room felt increasingly thick and suffocating.

"Get on your knees and apologize to my wife," Tommy's father demanded, his voice echoing off the tiled walls. "Or else!"

"I don't negotiate with bullies," I replied, keeping my voice steady despite the rapid beating of my heart. "Whether they're children or adults."

His face contorted with rage. "You think you're so tough? Let's see how tough you are now." He cracked his knuckles menacingly, and I felt Milo trembling against my back.

I had faced countless boardroom battles, hostile takeovers, and corporate threats, but this was different. This wasn't about business or money - this was raw, physical intimidation.

"The only person who should be apologizing is you," I said, trying to buy time while frantically searching for a way out. "For raising a son who thinks violence is the answer to losing fair and square."

Tommy's mother let out a shrill laugh. "Look who's talking about violence! Didn't you just slap my husband?"

"That was a lesson in parental responsibility," I shot back, though I was beginning to regret that impulsive action now that the situation had escalated so dramatically.

Then something unexpected happened. Milo - small, brave Milo - stepped in front of me, his arms spread wide.

"Don't touch her!" his young voice rang out, trembling but determined.

My heart clenched. This child, who minutes ago had been a victim himself, was now trying to protect me. The pure, innocent courage of it hit me like a physical force.

"My dad is Lucas Harrington!"

Tommy's father laughed cruelly. "Your dad? Who do you think you are, kid?"

The words hung in the air like a thunderclap. I felt my breath catch in my throat as I watched the impact of this revelation ripple through the crowd. The muttering grew louder, more speculative.

Tommy's father's face twisted into something ugly. "Lucas Harrington? What a joke!" He took another menacing step forward. "A woman like her with Lucas Harrington? Keep dreaming, kid. Look at your mother - nothing but a gold-digging whore who-"

"I said STOP!" Milo's shout was fierce. He spread his arms wide, making himself as big as possible while standing in front of me. "You can't hurt her!"

Time seemed to slow down. I could see Tommy's father's hand rising, his face contorted with rage. Milo was too close, too exposed. 

"NO!" The cry tore from my throat as I lunged forward, desperately trying to pull Milo into my arms, but I knew I wouldn't make it in time.

"I really wouldn't do that if I were you."

A familiar voice cut through the tension like a knife. Deep, authoritative, and absolutely furious.
###chapter 170
Lucas's POV

The tension in the air hit me before I even reached the locker room door. Rachel's hurried footsteps behind me.

I threw the door open. The scene before me made my blood run cold: Serena backed against the lockers, and Milo shield her. A man had his hand raised, ready to strike him.

"I really wouldn't do that if I were you." I spoke with thunderous authority, barely containing my anger as the words burst out instinctively

The room froze at my entrance. The man's hand wavered mid-air as his eyes darted between me and Rachel. The recognition dawned in his eyes, followed quickly by fear. His hand trembled as he released his clenched fist.

"What's going on here?" My voice came out low, controlled, but carrying an edge that made the man take an involuntary step back.

"Daddy!" Milo's voice cracked as he crashed into my legs. His small shoulders shook with suppressed sobs. The sight of his usually cheerful face streaked with tears made something dark and primal stir in my chest.
"Are you hurt?" I asked, my tone softening as I addressed them.

Serena shook her head, but I caught the lingering worry in her eyes. She moved closer to Milo, her protective instinct evident in every gesture.

I knelt down to Milo's level. "Take your time," I said gently. "I'm here now." I kept one hand protectively on Milo's shoulder while my eyes never left the man who had dared to threaten them.

His lower lip trembled as he spoke. "They... they bullied Mommy. They were going to hit her. They called me..." He swallowed hard. "They said I was a bastard, that you wouldn't want Mommy, that you'd never have children with her."

Each word felt like ice in my veins, but I kept my expression calm for Milo's sake.

"Tommy hit me because I won first place in swimming," Milo continued, his voice growing stronger. "He said I cheated and he ask me to let him win next time. When I said no, they dumped the trash can over my head!"

Tommy's mother suddenly found her voice. Her husband tried to quiet her, but the words had already escaped.

"So you're Serena's latest man?" Her tone dripped with disdain as she looked me up and down. "You look respectable enough. Why waste your time with that worthless-"

SLAP!

The crack of my palm against her cheek echoed through the locker room. She stumbled, falling to the floor with the force of the carefully measured slap. The silence that followed was absolute.

My entire body radiated cold fury as I turned to face the rest of them. The husband had backed away, leaving his son exposed. The boy tried to retreat into his father's arms, but the man was too focused on his own self-preservation to offer protection.

"Daddy's scary," Milo whispered, but there was relief in his voice.

I forced myself to modulate my tone as I addressed the cowering family. "This is your only warning." My words came out precise and glacial. "If I ever hear that you've harassed my family again..."

I let the threat hang in the air, unfinished but unmistakable. The man nodded frantically, pulling his wife to her feet. She was still holding her reddened cheek, all previous bravado gone.

"I'll destroy you! My dad will bankrupt your entire company!" The young boy snarls at me, his face contorted with rage after seeing his mother struck. 

I fix Tommy with an icy stare, taking slow, menacing steps toward him, danger radiating from my every move. As I advance, his face morphs from panic to pure fear, and he scrambles behind his father for protection. His father, frozen in place, makes no move to shield him. 

"Milo, come here," I say, my voice gentle.

I kept my hand steady on Milo's shoulder as I knelt beside him, bringing myself to his eye level. "Tell me exactly what he did to you," I said softly, my voice carrying just enough steel to make the other boy shift uncomfortably.

His small hands trembled slightly as he recounted the incident, and I noticed the hurt lingering in his eyes.

"Go get that trash can," I instructed, nodding toward the corner. 

Milo hesitated, and I understood why. The values we'd instilled in him - kindness, respect, proper behavior - made him uncomfortable with the idea of retaliation. But there were times when a lesson needed to be taught.

"Sometimes, Milo," I explained carefully, "bullies only learn when they experience the same treatment they dish out. Do you understand?" I was proud to see that while my son was gentle-natured, he wasn't weak.

After a moment's consideration, Milo set his jaw and grabbed the trash can. In one swift motion, he upended it over the bully's head. The kid immediately burst into dramatic tears. It was exactly the kind of reaction I'd expect from a spoiled child who'd never faced consequences.

Tommy's mother let out an anguished cry. "God, no!" She shoved her husband desperately. "Please, help our son!" 

When he ignored her pleas, she snapped. "I'll kill you!" she shrieked, lunging toward Milo. Her husband caught her mid-stride, restraining her before she could reach him. Then he did the unthinkable-he slapped her across the face.

"Have you lost your mind?!" she shrieked at her husband. "Your son is being attacked and you're just standing there! What kind of man are you? You can't even protect your own family-"

"That's Lucas Harrington," her husband roared.

I watched with cold amusement as she froze mid-tirade. These people who threw their weight around based on their spouse's position always crumbled when faced with real power.

But what truly warmed my heart was Milo's transformation. Milo drew himself up to his full height - still small, but radiating authority - and demanded, "Apologize to me and to my mommy!" It was the first time I'd seen him channel this kind of presence. 

When the bully mumbled an apology under his father's stern glare, Milo wasn't finished. "Are you going to bully other kids again?"

"No," came the subdued reply.

"If I ever see you being mean to anyone else, I won't let you get away with it." Milo's small frame practically vibrated with conviction, and I couldn't help the proud smile that tugged at my lips. This was my son.

After ensuring the situation was fully resolved, I watched Milo return to Serena's side. She ran her fingers through his damp hair soothingly, murmuring words of praise that made him beam. The sight stirred something in my chest.

I stepped beside Serena, fixing my gaze on the couple. "Starting today, I don't want to see you anywhere near the school, including your son-"

"Wait." Serena's voice cut through my declaration.

I turned to look at her, expecting perhaps a moment of mercy. But I remained silent, respecting whatever decision she would make.

Her eyes, sharp as ice, locked onto the couple. "Earlier, weren't you the one who demanded I kneel and apologize to your wife?"

The man began trembling visibly. "I... I didn't realize who you were, your connection to Mr. Harrington, or young Master Milo's identity... It was entirely my fault..."

He and his wife kept bowing and apologizing, their previous arrogance completely shattered. The transformation was almost pitiful - almost.

"Since you understand your mistake," Serena pronounced each word with crystalline clarity, her gaze piercing, "then kneel and apologize to me."

This was exactly why I admired Serena - she was resolute and showed no mercy to those who cross her.

I observed the man's internal struggle. As a nouveau riche who'd spent years throwing his wealth around, kneeling must have felt like swallowing broken glass. But under the situation, his knees finally buckled.

Serena cast a meaningful glance at the woman still standing. The man immediately got the message, yanking his wife down beside him.

"We sincerely apologize. Please forgive our ignorance." The words that tumbled from his mouth must have been the most humiliating of his life. This was the price of arrogance.

"I'm taking Milo to get cleaned up - he still has a competition," Serena said, taking Milo's hand. She turned to me with a knowing look. "As for the rest... do whatever you see fit."

I nodded. I should have known better than to doubt her resolve. That unflinching strength was one of her most captivating qualities.

After she left with Milo, I turned my cold gaze back to the kneeling couple. Serena's eye-for-an-eye approach was elegant, but for me, it wasn't nearly enough.

I pulled out my phone and dialed a number. Since they enjoyed throwing their weight around in front of children, I would ensure they never had the capacity to intimidate anyone again.
###chapter 171
Serena's POV

"I'll take Milo to clean up," I said quietly, meeting Lucas's intense gaze. "The next match is soon... handle the rest as you see fit." The slight nod he gave me carried volumes of understanding.

"Go ahead," he replied, his voice low and reassuring. "I'll take care of everything."

Guiding Milo toward the bathroom, I kept my hand gentle but firm on his shoulder. My heart clenched at the sight of his rumpled swimsuit and hair still bearing traces of garbage.

Inside the bathroom, I locked the door behind us, creating a private sanctuary. The sound of running water filled the silence as I wet paper towels and began carefully cleaning his face.

"Are you feeling better now, sweetheart?" I asked softly, watching his expression in the mirror.

His eyes met mine, brightening with a resilience that made my chest ache with pride. "Much better! You protected me, and Dad taught them a lesson. And I even got to dump the trash back on them!" His enthusiasm faltered slightly. "I was scared at first, but Dad said sometimes being brave means doing the right thing even when you're scared."

I smiled, running my fingers through his damp hair. "Your father is right about that." Reaching for more paper towels, I continued cleaning away the last traces of the incident. "You know what makes a mother incredibly strong?"

"What?" He looked genuinely curious.

"Love for her child." I turned him to face me, kneeling to meet his eyes. "When I saw them trying to hurt you, nothing else mattered. Being a mother makes you capable of anything when it comes to protecting your child."

"Like a superpower?" His eyes widened with childish wonder.

I laughed softly. "Something like that. But Milo..." My tone grew more serious. "I need you to understand something important."

He nodded, sensing the shift in mood.

"I know you want to protect me, and that makes me so proud. But you're still growing up. Real protection isn't about rushing into danger - it's about being smart, being prepared, and knowing when to ask for help."

I straightened his swim cap, smoothing out the wrinkles. "Promise me you'll remember that? That you'll focus on growing stronger and smarter before trying to fight anyone's battles?"

He wrapped his arms around my waist, burying his face in my stomach. "I promise, Mom. But when I'm big and strong like - "

"When you're big and strong," I hugged him back, "we'll talk about it again. For now, let's focus on winning your next race, shall we?"

His face lit up at the reminder. "The relay race! We can't be late!" He pulled back, practically bouncing with renewed energy.

The hallway seemed brighter as we emerged, heading toward the stadium. Lucas and Rachel and Stella were waiting near the entrance. The way Lucas's eyes immediately found us, checking for any remaining distress.

Stella hurried over as soon as she spotted Milo and me. Without a word, but with eyes full of concern, she wrapped her arms protectively around her twin brother. Milo melted into his sister's embrace, his face lighting up with that innocent smile that was so uniquely his.

"Everything okay?" Lucas asked quietly as we approached.

I nodded, watching Milo practically skip ahead, already focused on his upcoming race. "He's stronger than anyone gives him credit for."

"The school board will be reviewing their anti-bullying policies," Lucas informed us, his tone suggesting this was the least of the changes coming. 

"Mom! Dad! Come on!" Milo called from ahead, waving excitedly. "The relay's about to start!"

When Rachel heard it, her smile faltered, giving way to a flash of embarrassment. I gave Milo a reassuring smile in response, then led the way with him and Stella as we headed to our positions for the relay race.

The relay race had always been the most thrilling moment of any sports day. As I watched from the bleachers, my heart swelled with emotion at the children's fighting spirit. Every stride, every handoff spoke of their determination and teamwork.

In the final leg, Milo grabbed the baton and sprinted forward with everything he had. Near the finish line, Stella stood cheering wildly for her brother. Despite starting behind, Milo made an incredible push in those last moments. He overtook the second-place runner just before the finish line, clinching the gold medal as the crowd erupted in cheers. Stella leaped with joy, rushing to be the first to embrace her brother.

I noticed Rachel's excited movements as she stood up from her seat, barely containing her enthusiasm. After their victory, both Milo and Stella's eyes kept finding their way to where I sat. Under the warm afternoon sun, their smiles were radiant and pure.

With the relay races finished ahead of schedule, the school made an impromptu announcement: they would add a parent-child relay race. It wouldn't count toward the official scores, but each class could organize teams of parents and children running together.

As the teachers began coordinating with the parents, Rachel immediately volunteered. Lucas hesitated briefly before following her to the track. I caught sight of Stella's expression - her lips pursed in obvious displeasure. She had never appreciated Rachel's attempts to play mother.

During the pre-race lineup, both Milo and Stella's faces clouded over when Rachel positioned herself behind them. Stella deliberately tugged her brother's hand, taking a step sideways to create distance.

Rachel noticed their reaction. She crouched down, reaching for Stella's hair with an overly sweet voice, "Godmother is also mother, darling. Don't reject me."

Stella dodged Rachel's hand while Milo looked up at Lucas with hurt in his eyes.

Only after Lucas gave a slight nod did the children reluctantly agree. In that moment, they both turned to look at me in the stands, their faces filled with apology - especially Stella, whose eyes held a glimmer of hope.

I offered them a gentle smile, making a small cheering gesture to show my support. Their shoulders relaxed slightly at my response.

As the teacher finished arranging the teams, they discovered one little girl was missing a parent partner. While they pondered this dilemma, Stella's voice rang out clear and strong: "Ms. White, can our mom join instead?"

"Isn't your mother already here?" the teacher asked, confused.

"That's the mom we want," Stella pointed toward me in the stands, with Milo nodding vigorously beside her.

The teacher looked puzzled but didn't press the issue. "Of course, that's fine."

When the invitation reached me, seeing the children's eager faces, I couldn't bring myself to refuse. I agreed to stand in as the little girl's temporary mother for the race. As I made my way down to the track, I could feel Milo and Stella's eyes following me, stealing glances filled with joy.

The starting positions were being assigned. At the blast of the whistle, the match begun.
###chapter 172
Rachel's POV

I stood at the edge of the track and my attention was fixed on the way Milo and Stella gravitated toward Serena. An unexplained rage welled up inside.

"Kids, come here!" I called out, ensuring my voice carried just the right note of maternal warmth. "Don't you want to wish your godmother luck?"

Milo glanced my way with that polite, distant look I'd grown to hate. Stella didn't even bother turning around. I'd spent hours choosing this outfit, even buying a matching hair ribbon to coordinate with Stella's. The ribbon now felt tight against my scalp.

"Darlings, no hug for me?" I bent down, arms outstretched, forcing a sweet smile. "Or I might just have to catch you and squeeze you anyway!"

"Thank you, Ms. Thorne," Milo replied with careful politeness, the formal address landing like a slap. Stella merely shifted closer to Serena, as if seeking protection from my affection.

Lucas stood nearby, his athletic frame casually elegant even in standard running gear. I straightened up, subtly adjusting my stance to highlight my figure. "The weather's perfect for a race, isn't it, Lucas?"

He nodded absently, his eyes tracking Serena as she helped another child adjust their shoelaces. The tenderness in his gaze made my stomach clench. 

*Serena, you picked the wrong person to mess with.*

The race began, and I positioned myself carefully. When Lucas approached with the baton, I saw his focus was already ahead, checking Serena's position in the next lane.

This only fueled my anger - seeing how everyone, from Milo and Stella to even Lucas, had their eyes fixed on Serena all day. I started running. 
I saw Serena gaining on me with each stride. My breathing was becoming labored - I'd never been particularly athletic, and she was clearly in better shape. The sound of her footsteps grew closer, steady and strong behind me. Just as she was about to pass, I made my move.
I shifted my trajectory ever so slightly, drifting into her lane. Serena was running at full speed, too focused on the finish line to notice my subtle intrusion. The collision was inevitable.
The impact knocked the breath from my lungs as we crashed together. The track's surface was hard against my back, and I felt a genuine flash of pain shoot through my shoulder and ankle.
Around us, gasps and cries of shock erupted from the crowd. Through my peripheral vision, I caught sight of kids and Lucas's worried face as they ran toward us. I had anticipated the next scenario.
But Lucas wasn't toward me. His found Serena, checking if she'd been hurt. I watched him help Serena to her feet and scanned her for injuries. The concern in his expression was sincere. Something inside my chest withered.

Serena shook her head and pushed away from his touch. It made me surprise. I needed to grip this opportunity.
I let out a pained moan, it wasn't entirely feigned. "It hurts..." I whimpered, watching their reactions come to me.
"Are you alright?" He finally turned to me, his voice carrying professional courtesy rather than personal worry. 

"It hurts," I whimpered, playing up the injury. Surely now he'd sweep me into his arms, carry me to safety like in all those romantic movies. "I don't think I can walk."

"I'll help you to the medical office," he offered, turning his back to me. "Climb on."

A piggyback ride. Like I was one of the children. Instead of carrying me in his arms - something he could have easily done. That small detail made my heart sink. I swallowed my disappointment and allowed him to carry me off the field, past the concerned whispers of other parents. Over his shoulder, I watched Serena gather Milo and Stella close, their small faces turned up to her in genuine worry.

"Should I call an ambulance?" Lucas asked once we reached the medical office.

"No, I just need rest," I managed, hope flickering. Surely he'd stay with me now.

"I'll have my helicopter take you to the hospital for a proper check," he said instead, already pulling out his phone.

I watched Lucas's back as he made arrangements for the helicopter, his posture straight and businesslike. My ankle throbbed, but the pain in my chest was far worse. He hadn't even looked at me since helping me to the bench.

"It's really not that serious," I ventured, trying to keep my voice light and casual. "There's no need for a helicopter."

Lucas didn't turn around, his phone still pressed to his ear. "The hospital is better equipped to assess any injuries." His tone was the same one he used when dictating memos - professional, detached, devoid of any personal concern.

Through the gaps between spectators, I could see the awards ceremony beginning. Milo stood proudly on the podium, his small face beaming as he received his medal. Stella bounced excitedly beside him, and Serena... Serena stood watching them both with such natural maternal pride that it made my stomach twist.

"I feel silly making such a fuss," I tried again, forcing a small laugh. "It's probably just a mild sprain."

"Better safe than sorry." Lucas finally turned to face me, but his eyes were cold. "Walter will accompany you to the hospital."

The dismissal in his voice was unmistakable. My carefully maintained composure began to crack. "Lucas," I said softly, using his first name deliberately, "about what happened with Serena..."

"What about it?" His question cut through the air like ice.

I swallowed hard, pressing on. "I don't want you to think... I mean, you shouldn't blame her for anything."

A muscle twitched in his jaw. "Why would I blame Serena?"

"I just..." My hands twisted in my lap, nails digging into my palms. "I don't want this little accident to cause any problems between - ."

"Rachel." His voice stopped me cold. "We both know exactly what happened out there."

Heat rushed to my face. "I lost my balance-"

"You crossed into her lane." He stated it as a fact, no anger, just cold certainty. 

Each word felt like a slap. "That's not-"

"It needs to stop." He wasn't even looking at me anymore, his gaze fixed on the award ceremony where Milo was now hugging Serena. "You're the children's godmother. That's a privilege and a responsibility. But you keep trying to make it something more."

"I care about them," I whispered, my voice trembling. "I care about you."

"No." His response was immediate and final. "You care about the idea of us. The perfect family you've imagined. But it's not real, Rachel. It never was."

Tears burned behind my eyes, but I wouldn't let them fall. Not here, not in front of him. "I just want..."

"I know what you want." His voice softened slightly, but that only made it worse. "And I'm sorry, but it's not going to happen. You're crossing boundaries that shouldn't be crossed."

The helicopter's distant thrum filled the awkward silence. 

"Let's go," Lucas demanded.
###chapter 173
Serena's POV

The beating of helicopter blades shattered the usual tranquility of the stadium. I stood motionless, watching as the sleek black aircraft descended, its downdraft whipping my hair around my face. Through the chaos, I caught sight of Rachel being carefully loaded aboard, Lucas's tall figure beside her. My grip tightened imperceptibly on my phone as I observed the scene, maintaining the composed expression.

"Serena." Lucas's voice cut through the noise as he approached me, his gray eyes intense. "Could you watch Stella and Milo tonight?"

I nodded, my face betraying nothing of the twinge in my back from the earlier incident. "Of course."

He hesitated for a moment, as if wanting to say more, but simply squeezed Milo's shoulder before heading back to the helicopter. I watched as Milo's small hand lifted in a wave to his father, his usually confident posture slightly diminished.

"Ready to go home?" I asked them softly, receiving a quiet nod in response.

The drive home was a study in controlled discomfort. Each small bump in the road sent sharp reminders through my back, but I kept my expression neutral, occasionally catching glimpses of Stella and Milo. 

My fingers found my phone, muscle memory dialing Eleanor's number.

"Eleanor, free for dinner tonight?"

"Oh honey, I'm so sorry - I've got to fly to LA for this crucial event. Is everything okay? You sound a bit off."

I forced lightness into my tone. "Just wanted to catch up. It's fine, we'll do it another time."

"You sure? You know you can tell me if something's wrong."

"Absolutely. Have a good flight." I ended the call, catching both children's concerned gazes in the mirror. Stella's eyes held a quiet worry, while Milo fidgeted with his toy car.

"How about we make something special for dinner?" I suggested, trying to lighten the mood.

Stella's face brightened slightly. "Could we make macarons?"

"Let's have some real food first," I smiled, then turned to Milo who was still unusually quiet. "What do you think, Milo? Should we try that new pasta recipe you found?"

His eyes lit up at that. "The one with the crispy garlic on top?"

"That's the one."

At home, I focused on creating a sense of normalcy, guiding both children through their evening routines while carefully managing my own movements. The kitchen came alive with the warm scent of roasted chicken and vegetables, along with the garlicky aroma of Milo's requested pasta. Stella meticulously set the table while Milo helped me with the cooking, standing on his step stool to carefully stir the sauce just as Lucas had taught him.

We ate dinner together, the silence comfortable and occasionally broken by the twins' chatter. I listened attentively, watching as they gradually relaxed, the tension from the afternoon's events slowly melting away.

After dinner came our attempt at macarons - which quickly turned into an impromptu food fight when Milo accidentally dusted his sister with powdered sugar, and Stella retaliated with a handful of her own. Their giggles filled the kitchen, and for a moment, the weight of the day lifted completely.

"Dad's going to laugh when he sees this mess," Milo said, wiping sugar from his nose and grinning.

"Only if you help clean it up first," I countered, ruffling his hair. "Both of you, go get cleaned up while I handle the kitchen."

As they headed off to shower, their playful bickering echoing down the hallway, I began tidying up. The simple domestic tasks helped ground me, even as each reach and bend sent warning signals through my body. 

It wasn't until kids were safely tucked in bed that I finally allowed myself to acknowledge the full extent of my discomfort. 

Through the mirror, I noticed a large bruise on my waist when I undressed in the bathroom. It hurt when I moved. After gritting my teeth through a shower and changing into pajamas, I went to find some bruise cream from the medicine cabinet.

Standing in front of the full-length mirror in the living room, I lifted my top and even pulled down my pajama pants slightly to better apply the cream to my waist.

"You should have that looked at."

The deep voice froze me in place. In the mirror, I saw Lucas standing in the doorway, his expression unreadable. I quickly pulled my robe closer, turning to face him.

"How did you get in?"

"Stella let me in when I knocked." His eyes hadn't left the glimpse of bruising. "Why didn't you mention you were hurt?"

"It's nothing serious," I replied, keeping my voice level. "Kids should be asleep by now. Since it's the weekend, there's no need to take them home tonight."

He took a step forward, and I instinctively stepped back, bumping against the counter. "Serena..."

"I'm fine," I cut him off, tightening my grip on my robe. "Rachel needed your attention more urgently. How is she?"

"Being treated." His jaw tightened slightly. "That's not what we're discussing right now."

"There's nothing to discuss." My voice was cold, but Lucas didn't move. Instead, his reflection in the mirror took a step closer, his height casting me further into shadow. "Stand back."

"Let me see the injury." His tone held that familiar note of authority.

"I said stand back." I pressed against the counter, maintaining what little distance I could in the confined space. The edge of the marble dug into my hip, a sharp counterpoint to the dull ache in my back.

He ignored my warning, closing the distance between us with deliberate steps. "Weren't you supposed to be unharmed?"

"Not as severe as Rachel's injury." I kept my voice steady, but my fingers tightened on the robe's fabric. The mention of Rachel's name hung in the air between us, weighted with unspoken implications.

"When will you learn to admit when you're in pain?" His eyes met mine in the mirror, gray and unflinching. Before I could react, his hand brushed the silk from my shoulder, exposing the mottled bruising beneath.

I jerked away, but there was nowhere to go. "Don't."

"Stop being stubborn." His fingers were surprisingly gentle as they probed the injury, but I stiffened at his touch. "This needs treatment."

"I can handle it myself."

"Clearly." The sarcasm in his voice was mild but unmistakable. "That's why you're standing here, unable to even reach it properly."

The truth of his words stung more than the injury. I watched in the mirror as he reached past me for the first aid kit I'd left on the counter, his movements precise and controlled. The familiar scent of his cologne wrapped around me.

"Don't worry," his voice dropped lower, almost mocking. "I won't lose control. Not even when you were drugged, let alone now."

The reference to that night sent heat flooding my cheeks. "That's not the point."

"I've seen it all before, Serena." His hands returned to my shoulder, cool with antiseptic.

"That was then." I met his gaze in the mirror, steeling myself. "We're strangers now."
###chapter 174
Serena's POV

His hands stilled for a fraction of a second before resuming their work. "Are we?"

I didn't answer, trying to ignore the gentle pressure of his fingers against my skin. Each touch felt like a betrayal - of Rachel, of my own resolve, of the careful distance I'd maintained.

"This will bruise badly," he said finally, his clinical tone at odds with the intimacy of the moment. "You should have mentioned it earlier."

"It wasn't relevant." I watched as he applied the medication with methodical care, his face serious in the mirror's reflection. "You had more important concerns."

"Rachel being injured doesn't make yours irrelevant." He caught my attempt to pull away and held me still with a firm hand on my waist. "Stay still. I'm almost done."

The warmth of his palm through the thin silk sent an unwelcome shiver down my spine. I forced myself to remain motionless, counting the seconds until this torturous intimacy would end. 


Lucas's POV

I gently applied the ointment, my fingers carefully avoiding pressure on the bruises marking her waist. The silence in the room was thick with tension, broken only by Serena's controlled breathing. I could feel her discomfort, the way her muscles tensed under my touch.

Her skin was warm beneath my fingertips, the elegant curve of her waist a dangerous temptation. The bruises stood out like violent watercolors against her pale skin. Something primitive and protective stirred in my chest at the sight.

Before I could stop myself, I leaned down and pressed my lips against her skin, carefully avoiding the injured areas. The kiss was feather-light, almost reverent.

Serena spun around instantly, backing against the mirror. Her eyes blazed with fury, turning that deep shade of brown that always signaled danger. "What are you doing?" she demanded. "Weren't you the one who claimed to have no interest in my body?"

"I couldn't help myself," I admitted quietly, watching the emotions play across her face.

"You're a married man!" The accusation in her voice cut through the air like a blade.

"No." I enunciated each word carefully, maintaining eye contact. "Not yet."

Her laugh was bitter, tinged with something that sounded like hurt. "So in Mr. Harrington's mind, as long as there's no marriage certificate, anything goes? Only legal contracts can restrain you?"

I stood there, speechless. She wasn't wrong - I had overstepped. My self-control, usually iron-clad, always seemed to crumble around her. Every glance, every accidental touch, drove me closer to the edge of my restraint.

"It's late. Please leave." Her voice had turned to ice.

I walked to the door, pausing at the threshold. "Eleanor will come tomorrow morning to help with the medication."

"I know," she replied flatly.

"Good night," I started to say, but the door closed in my face, nearly catching my nose. I deserved that.

Every time I saw her, I wanted to stay longer, to be closer. The need to protect her warred with my desire to possess her completely.

Standing in the hallway, I made a silent vow. Six months. I would give myself six months to clear up every misunderstanding, to remove every obstacle between us. I couldn't let her continue believing I belonged to another woman.

Six months. The countdown started now.
###chapter 175
Serena's POV

I sat at the head of the conference table, watching the representatives from three major construction firms shift in their seats. 

"The final voting process will begin in five minutes," Vincent announced, his voice steady and professional. I caught him glancing at me, seeking confirmation. I gave him a slight nod.

The past week had been intense. Our team had meticulously reviewed each proposal, looking for any potential weaknesses. This project would define StarRiver's direction for the next five years. I could almost taste victory-until the boardroom door swung open.

Two men in dark suits entered, their FBI badges glinting under the fluorescent lights. The taller one stepped forward. "Ms. Sinclair? I'm Special Agent Johnson with the FBI. This is Special Agent Miller."

The room fell silent. I felt every eye turn to me, but I kept my expression neutral.

"We have a federal warrant for your arrest." Agent Johnson's voice was clinical. "You're being charged with federal tax fraud and bribing an IRS official."

*What the hell!* 

Paralyzed with confusion - my mind went blank as I sat in the armchair, staring at the police officers, momentarily forgetting how to respond.

"Ms. Sinclair." Agent Miller's stern voice pulled me back to reality, my throat suddenly dry.

My mind raced through possibilities even as I maintained my composed exterior. *Rachel Thorne.* Of course. Only she had the connections and resources to orchestrate something this elaborate. The timing was too perfect to be coincidence.

"May I see the warrant?" My voice remained steady, betraying none of the anger building inside me.

As Agent Johnson handed me the document, his partner began reciting, "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney..."

I scanned the warrant quickly, my legal training kicking in. The allegations were specific: $4 million in bribes to an IRS official, resulting in $30 million in evaded taxes.

"Vincent," I turned to him, my voice low but clear. "Contact Davis & Thompson immediately. Tell Robert to handle this. All ongoing negotiations are to be postponed until further notice."

Vincent's face showed concern, but his response was professional. "Understood, Ms. Sinclair. I'll take care of everything."

As I stood, smoothing my suit, I addressed the room one final time. "Gentlemen, I apologize for this interruption. Mr. Chadwick will contact your offices to reschedule."

The representatives remained frozen, their expressions a mix of shock and barely concealed interest. Tomorrow's business papers would have a field day with this.

Agent Miller stepped forward, handcuffs ready. I raised an eyebrow. "Those won't be necessary. I'll cooperate fully."



Lucas's POV

The Germany boardroom hummed with quiet tension as I studied the merger proposal on the screen. My phone buzzed-Eleanor. I silenced it without looking.

"As you can see, Mr. Harrington, the Asian market projections..." The presenter's voice faded as my phone lit up again. Eleanor never called twice unless-

"Excuse me," I said, rising from my leather chair. The board members exchanged glances as I strode out.

"What is it?" My voice was sharp in the empty hallway.

"Lucas..." Eleanor's usual confidence wavered. "It's about Serena. The FBI just arrested her."

The world tilted. My hand tightened on the phone. "Explain."

"Tax fraud allegations. They took her from StarRiver's offices during the bidding meeting."

My jaw clenched. "Details."

"Four million in alleged bribes to an IRS official. Thirty million in tax evasion."

Ice spread through my veins. "Who's handling it?"

"She told Vincent to contact Davis & Thompson."

"Good." I was already walking. "Keep me updated."

Miles looked up as I re-entered the boardroom. One look at my face and he was on his feet.

"Ladies and gentlemen," I addressed the room, "We'll need to continue this via video conference. My assistant will coordinate the details."

"Sir," Miles murmured as we left, "The Shanghai team-"

"Not now." I loosened my tie. "Airport. Immediately."

In the elevator, I dialed Spencer. He answered on the second ring.

"The great Lucas Harrington calling me? The world must be ending."

"Serena's been arrested. Federal charges." The elevator numbers blinked downward. "I need your wife to handle the bail hearing before I land."

His playful tone vanished. "How bad?"

"Bad enough for the FBI to arrest her in front of the entire board."

"Christ." A pause. "Quinn's got a good relationship with Judge Matthews. We'll make it happen."

"I'll be in Manhattan by 2 AM."
###chapter 176
Spencer Sherwood's POV

I wake to a splitting headache. Last night's decisions scatter across the floor like breadcrumbs: a jacket, a tie, a woman's red-soled stiletto.

"Spencer..." A manicured hand trails across my chest. What was her name? - props herself up on one elbow, dark hair cascading over bare shoulders. Her attempt at a seductive pout falls flat against my growing irritation.

I catch her wrist mid-caress, my grip firm but controlled. Meeting her gaze, I let the temperature in my eyes drop several degrees. She withdraws her hand as if burned, the message received without a word needed.

The suite's phone feels heavy in my hand as I dial Quinn. One ring. Two. Her voice comes through crisp and professional.

"How much money do you need?" she asks, straight to business.

"No money. Bring me a fresh suit and the bail paperwork. Lucas needs you to get Serena out." I massage my temple, the hangover pulsing behind my eyes.

"Is it urgent?" A careful probe in her tone.

"Something else on your agenda?" The edge in my voice is reflexive.

"I should review Serena's case first."

I exhale, moderating my tone. "It's not an emergency, but Lucas will be anxious. Better move quickly."

"I'll do my best." Simple. Efficient. It's why our arrangement works.

The next hour crawls by. Quinn stands in the doorway, garment bag in one hand, manila folder in the other. Her gaze flicks past me to the woman in my bed, expression unchanging.

"Your payment." Quinn sets a thick envelope on the nightstand. "Car's waiting downstairs."

The woman-Sarah? Sandra?-clutches the sheet to her chest. "Ten thousand," she says, chin lifted in defiance.

Quinn nods once, precise as a metronome. "You'll find it's all there. The NDA is included. Sign before you leave."

I watch the interaction through the throbbing in my temples. Quinn's efficiency should be jarring at this hour, but it's exactly what I need. She hands me the garment bag without comment.

The shower helps. By the time I emerge, the woman is gone. Quinn stands at the window. "Serena's case." She doesn't turn. "The evidence is substantial. Tax evasion, bribery-they've built a solid chain."

"Lucas will handle it." I adjust my cufflinks.

"Not without significant risk." Her reflection meets mine in the glass. "Ten years, minimum. Unless..."

"Unless?"

"We need leverage. More than money can buy." She turns, manila folder open. "The prosecutor-"

A horn blares outside. Quinn snaps the folder shut. "We should go."

The elevator descent is silent. In the car, city's morning rush surrounds us, a symphony of impatience. Quinn navigates with surgical precision until a black SUV cuts across three lanes.

My arm shoots out instinctively, bracing her as she swerves. The movement brings us close enough.

"Your driving hasn't improved," I say, withdrawing my arm slowly.

"Neither has your taste in women." Her eyes stay fixed on traffic, but there's a ghost of sarcasm in her tone.

"The prosecutor," I prompt, steering us back.

"Rufus." She merges smoothly into the left lane. "Known for his integrity, which makes him dangerous. But everyone has pressure points."

"Find them."

"Already working on it." She hands me the folder without looking. "You might want to stay sober for this one, Spencer."

The rebuke stings, but she's not wrong. I scan the documents, forcing my hungover brain to focus.

"How soon can you get Serena out?" I ask, closing the folder.

"Maybe Today, if Lucas provides the funds." She said calmly.

But her careful driving grates on my nerves. Her fingers grip the wheel at exactly ten and two, each turn calculated with maddening precision.

"I can drive slower," she offers, catching my impatient glance.

"Don't you have a driver? My father would give you one in a heartbeat. He treats you like his own daughter." The words come out sharper than intended, laced with old resentment.

When she doesn't respond, I've had enough. "Pull over. Get out. Passenger seat." She complies without argument - she always does.

The city blurs past at a more acceptable speed once I'm behind the wheel. Quinn sits quietly beside me, reviewing papers with that unflappable focus.

The detention center looms ahead. Quinn gathers her briefcase, every movement precise. "Wait here," she says, already shifting into attorney mode. "Without Lucas present, overturning this case will be challenging."

I watch her disappear through the heavy doors, then pull out my phone. Lucas's number goes straight to voicemail. A knot forms in my stomach.

I dial Jace. "Is Lucas on a flight somewhere? Can't reach him."

The pause before Jace's response stretches too long. "Likely under house arrest overseas. My father's doing."
My expression darkened. "This complicates things."

The situation reeks of orchestration - someone powerful pulling strings behind the scenes. Without Lucas's influence, Serena has virtually no chance of avoiding prison time.

"I'll try to reach Lucas," Jace said. "He likely wanted Quinn to start working on Serena's case. Have her gather all the details so when Lucas returns, we can act quickly with the right strategy."

"Agreed." 
###chapter 177
Serena's POV

I'd been here for what felt like an eternity, though my rational mind knew it had only been hours.

When the door opened, I expected another interrogator. Instead, a woman in her early twenties entered, her tailored navy suit and structured leather briefcase marking her clearly as a lawyer. 

*Quinn Ashford. Eleanor's friend. Spencer Sherwood's wife, lead counsel for his firm.* It made me a bit surprise.

"Ms. Sinclair." Her voice was steady, professional. "I'm Quinn Ashford. Eleanor's friend. We met months ago. I'll be representing you in this case."

"Let me guess - Mr. Harrington sent you?" My lips curved into a bitter smile.

Quinn placed her briefcase on the table, her movements deliberate. "Does that affect my ability to help you?"

I turned slightly away, my fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of the metal table. Of course Lucas would do this - arrange for one of Manhattan's top lawyers to handle my case. My chest tighten with an emotion I refused to name.

"Before we discuss strategy," Quinn said, opening her briefcase, "I need to ask you directly - have you ever engaged in bribery or tax evasion?"

"Never." The word came out sharp, definitive. "Every transaction was legitimate."

She nodded, spreading three documents before me. "Then let's address these pieces of evidence. First, the bank transfers."

Quinn placed a folder in front of me with deliberate precision. I fought to keep my expression neutral, though my stomach tightened at the sight of those documents.

"I've obtained evidence of your crimes," Quinn stated, her tone was professionally detached. Her fingers spread across the folder but didn't open it yet.

I'd seen these documents before, but facing them again sent an involuntary chill down my spine. This was a carefully orchestrated trap.

Quinn began methodically listing the charges, her voice cutting through the calm of the room. "The evidence includes all your criminal activities..." She opened the folder, revealing neat stacks of papers with highlighted sections.

I listened intently as she detailed three main accusations: a suspicious $4 million transfer, $30 million in unreported taxes, and those damning dinner photos. Each piece was meticulously crafted to ensnare me. 

"I never transferred any money to Brad," I stated firmly. "As for those dinner meetings with him - they were standard business protocol. I'd just taken over StarRiver Group. Making rounds at various ports is expected in our industry. It's how business is done."

When Quinn questioned the bank account activity, I met her gaze directly, noting how her eyes narrowed slightly at my response. "I never received those funds. More importantly, I've never even opened that bank account."

My mind raced through the implications: orchestrating something this elaborate required an extensive network of connections. This wasn't the work of an amateur or someone with limited resources.

Quinn's expression shifted subtly as she suggested seeking Lucas's assistance. My heart constricted, but I kept my voice steady. "Ms. Ashford, who do you think is behind this case?"

Her silence spoke volumes. I pressed on, "You must have your suspicions. Given my relationship with Lucas, and his relationship with... certain parties, who do you think he would support?"

The words felt bitter in my mouth as I voiced a truth I'd learned the hard way: "In this world, when interests clash with emotions, interests always win."

Quinn's promise to help brought an unexpected warmth, despite her cool demeanor. Her chosen words and unwavering professionalism provided a strange sort of comfort.

As we discussed the tax reporting discrepancies, my thoughts turned to Vincent. My brow furrowed as I considered his possible involvement. I'd personally promoted him, trusted him. 

Quinn summarized our findings with clinical efficiency. "So our key focus areas are: the origin of the bank card, and the apparent coordination between your financial officer Jessa, your secretary Vincent Chadwick, the deputy director of finance Brad, and our anonymous informant. They appear to have all been compromised."

I nodded, appreciating her straightforward approach.

"I understand the situation now," Quinn said, gathering her papers with practiced efficiency. "Your bail hearing is in one hour. I'll do everything possible."

"Thank you," I replied, surprised by how much her quiet competence reassured me. "What are our immediate options?"

"Bail will be difficult given the charges." Quinn's voice remained steady. "If we can't overturn this..." She hesitated.

"How long?" I kept my voice level.

"I'll try to keep it under ten years."

Ten years. The words hit like physical blows. I was twenty-five. By the time I got out, my youth would be gone, StarRiver might be destroyed...
###chapter 178
Quinn's POV

As I exited the courthouse, my mind heavy with concern. Despite Serena's composed demeanor during our meeting, the failed bail attempt left an unsettling weight in my stomach. 

Spencer was waiting by his car, his casual stance a stark contrast to the gravity of the situation. I silently slid into the passenger seat.

"How is she?" he asked, starting the engine.

"Calm and rational," I replied, organizing my thoughts from our earlier conversation. "I reviewed the case details - there are several angles we can work with to get the charges dropped. If we can uncover the right evidence, Serena should be fine." I paused, then added, "Did you tell Lucas about the bail situation?"

"Couldn't reach him."

I frowned. "He's on a flight?"

"No." Spencer's fingers drummed against the steering wheel. "Howard has him under house arrest overseas."

The news hit me like a physical blow. I turned to stare at him, searching his face for any sign he might be exaggerating.

"That look won't change anything, Quinn," Spencer said with a resigned shrug. "The Harrington empire is still Howard's domain. Even with all his influence, Lucas can't override his grandfather."

My stomach tightened. "Without him, investigating Serena's case becomes significantly more difficult."

"Jace is trying to find a way to reach Lucas. Let's hope he succeeds."

I nodded absently, then remembered Eleanor. Pulling out my phone, I quickly dialed her number. When her worried voice came through, I briefed her on the situation, emphasizing Lucas's confinement.

After hanging up, I gazed out at the Manhattan streets sliding past, my mind churning through possibilities.

"You seem unusually invested in Serena's case," Spencer observed, breaking into my thoughts.

"An attorney has obligations to their client," I replied evenly.

"Really? Because it seems more like you've taken a personal interest in her."

I didn't deny it. "She's someone worth knowing."

"It's fascinating, really. Serena has this way of drawing people in. Even Lucas, who's famous for keeping women at arm's length, fell for her completely."

I felt my jaw tighten. "Don't get any ideas about her."

"Jesus, Quinn!" Spencer's voice sharpened with genuine anger. "What kind of person do you think I am? She's Lucas's woman!"

I barely stopped myself from pointing out his history. When we reached the Sherwood Group building, I started to turn toward the parking garage, but Spencer cut in, "I need your car."

Knowing his personality but still reluctant, I offered, "I could drive you wherever you need to go."

"Get out." His tone left no room for argument.

Gritting my teeth, I stepped out and watched him drive away in my only vehicle. Taking cabs home during late nights always made me uneasy, but Spencer had never been one to consider others' concerns.




Eleanor's POV

I practically flew back to the Harrington mansion that afternoon, my anger building with every step. I felt suffocating as I made my way to Grandfather's study. 

"Eleanor." A strong hand caught my arm just as I reached for the door handle. I looked up to find Jace Gillard's face - the last one I wanted to see right now.

"Let go of me!" I glared at him, fury evident in every line of my face.

He maintained his patronizing tone, still gripping my arm. "You need to calm down. I know you want to confront him about Serena, but barging in like this won't solve anything-"

I let out a harsh laugh, cutting him off. "Of course you'd say that. When it's your friend involved, suddenly nothing can be solved." My voice dripped with contempt. "You don't want a solution - you're just afraid I'll upset Grandfather and the whole family's harmony will be disturbed. And heaven forbid that affects you! I get it, Jace. As an adopted son, you're insecure about your place here. I understand why you're so desperate to please Grandfather and secure your position. But don't be so selfish."

My words echoed through the hallway. The household staff froze, trying to make themselves invisible.

"Let her in, Jace." Grandfather's aged voice carried through the door.

I yanked my arm free from Jace's grip. "Don't touch me again," I spat, before pushing open the heavy door.

Inside, grandfather sat behind his massive desk, looking infuriatingly composed. "Grandfather, what have you done to my brother?" I demanded.

His self-assured smile only fueled my rage. "He's my grandson, Eleanor. What could I possibly do to him?"

"Don't play games with me!" My hands clenched into fists. "Why are you keeping him locked up overseas? Why won't you let him come home?"

"Eleanor." He leaned back in his leather chair, regarding me with that calculating look I'd grown to hate. "You're young. You don't understand how these things work. The engagement is beneficial for both families. Love can grow over time-"

"Love?" I nearly choked on the word. "Is that what you call forcing two people together for business interests? In your world, everything's just a transaction, isn't it? Even people's lives!"

My eyes burned with unshed tears as he continued his warnings about family duty and responsibility. The butler shifted uncomfortably nearby. "Miss Eleanor, perhaps you should..."

I ignored him. There was no getting through to Grandfather today, but I wasn't giving up. As I turned to leave, Jace was still hovering in the doorway, trying to play mediator.

"Eleanor, you have to understand. The connections involved in this situation are complex. Your grandfather isn't being unreasonable-"

I fixed him with an icy stare. "Save your fake sympathy, Jace. Keep being Grandfather's perfect little lapdog - you're so good at it."

I stormed out, my mind made up. If no one else would stand up for what's right, I would. Serena wasn't going to face this alone.
###chapter 179
Jace's POV

I stood outside the study, watching Eleanor's angry figure disappear down the hallway. My throat tightened as conflicting emotions washed over me. I had intended to start negotiations for Lucas; her presence changed things.

Taking a deep breath, I knocked on the study door again.

"You're here about Serena's case too?" Howard's voice was cold, edged with a hint of angry.

"Yes, sir." No point in denying it.

He leaned back in his leather chair. "Unlike Eleanor, who's young and acts on impulse, you should know better, Jace."

I carefully considered my approach, deciding on absolute sincerity. "I'd just like to share my perspective, sir. Whether you choose to consider it or not is entirely your decision. I won't press the matter further if you disagree."

Howard paused, then nodded. "Proceed."

"The situation with Serena is straightforward - we both know the Thornes are behind this." I kept my voice steady, watching for his reaction. When he didn't object, I continued, "However, I don't believe they've played this as cleverly as they think."

I stepped closer to his desk, maintaining a respectful distance. "Lucas's current acceptance of the Thorne engagement isn't about inability - it's about priorities. He's juggling both the family's interests and Serena's protection. But he hasn't been pushed to his limit... yet."

Pausing strategically, I studied Howard's expression. "If Serena ends up in prison because of the Thornes, do you really think Lucas will stand idle? I can guarantee with absolute certainty that he'll retaliate, regardless of the consequences. The fallout would be... devastating. For everyone's sake - the family's and Lucas's - we shouldn't interfere with this situation."

I noticed Howard's fingers tighten around his eyeglass. A tell. I pressed forward with my trump card: "That's just the first point, father."

"The second concerns you and Luc," I paused, carefully choosing my next words. "Dad, let's be honest here - do you really think Lucas will marry Rachel? We both know you only made that promise to the Thornes because you were backed into a corner. Lucas didn't push back against it because he respects you enough to understand why you did it. Don't you think it's time you showed him the same understanding? You're risking the trust and respect he has for you, Dad. Is that really worth it?"

Silence filled the study, heavy with unspoken words.

After a moment, I straightened my jacket. "I won't take up any more of your time, father."

"Jace." His voice stopped me at the door.

My heart tightened.

"Your talent was never the issue," Howard said quietly. "Keeping you out of Harrington International... it was because of the delicate situation. I couldn't explain your presence to the rest of the family-or even rationalize it to myself."

"I've never questioned your judgment, father." My response was genuine. "If you hadn't brought me into this family, I would've died on the streets. Besides, Lucas is more than qualified to lead Harrington International. Entrusting him with the company was the right decision."

Just then, the butler - James, burst in. "Sir, we've lost all contact with Mr. Lucas."

My chest tightened, but Howard's response was calm. "Let him be".

Leaving the study, I pulled out my phone, hovering over Eleanor's number. After a moment's hesitation, I put it away. Perhaps I vanished in her eyes was the kindest option. 



Eleanor's POV

I stormed into Quinn's office, my blood practically boiling. Just thinking about Rachel's sanctimonious face made my anger surge all over again.

"I can't believe how awful she is!" I collapsed into the armchair, my bag sliding to the floor. "You should've seen her, Quinn. All that fake sunshine and rainbows act, while she's basically Satan in Louboutins. I always say nobody's perfect, but people who seem flawless? They're usually the worst kind of fake."

My head was pounding. Last night's reality show taping had dragged until 2 AM, and we'd started again at 7 this morning. I'd barely managed to scarf down a sad excuse for lunch in the car on my way to catch my flight back. It made my condition worse. But the rage coursing through my veins wouldn't let me rest.

Quinn's voice floated somewhere above my consciousness: "Eleanor, maybe you should get some rest..." But exhaustion was already pulling me under, the plush leather of the chair feeling impossibly comfortable.

I could barely make out Jace and Spencer's voices in the background as my eyelids grew heavier, until sleep finally pulled me under.

The next thing I knew, there was a loud THUD, followed by a sharp pain in my backside. I blinked, disoriented, only to find myself sprawled on the floor. Looking up, I discovered I had an audience: Quinn, Jace, and Spencer were all staring at me.

Perfect. Just perfect. Eleanor Yates, darling of the entertainment industry, face-planting in front of witnesses. Even better, they were all just standing there, watching me like I was some kind of performance art piece.

Finally, Quinn snapped out of it and rushed to help me. "Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?" Her hands were gentle as she helped me up.

"My butt hurts," I whined. Quinn started rubbing my lower back soothingly. It was the kind of casual intimacy that comes with years of friendship.

"Don't tell me you two are secret lovers," Spencer drawled, his smirk practically audible.

I shot him my best death glare. "What kind of soap operas have you been watching? You jerk."

"Come on, Eleanor. I grew up with your brother. We're practically family. Would it kill you to show me some respect?" He had the audacity to sound wounded.

"That's how I treat asshole," I fired back, not missing a beat.
I could tell I was getting under Spencer's skin - that familiar tension in his jaw said it all.
"Let's stay focused here," Jace said quietly, touching Spencer's arm.
"I'll let this go, but only because of Jace," Spencer said, fixing me with an icy stare.
I opened my mouth to snap back at him, but Quinn's warning grip on my arm stopped me cold.
"Look, we're done discussing Serena's case anyway," Spencer said, fidgeting with his tie. "I need food. Let's grab dinner."
They started making dinner plans, but one glance at Jace made my stomach turn. "You guys go ahead," I cut in. "Quinn and I will grab something on our own." Then, because I couldn't resist twisting the knife, I added, "I can't eat around people I don't like."

I dragged Quinn out of there before anyone could respond. They probably thought I meant Spencer - he was the obvious target, after all. But my words were aimed at Jace.
###chapter 180
Serena's POV

I spent a restless night in the holding cell. The hard cot and stark environment made sleep nearly impossible. I couldn't help but think about Ian Whitmore. Life had a way of being ironic - I never imagined I'd end up in the same situation he had been in not long ago. 

After a night of clear thinking, my mind had finally settled. As I carefully pieced together the sequence of events, something clicked - this couldn't have been Rachel Thorne's work alone.

I analyzed it methodically: While Rachel might be capable of orchestrating external pressure, manipulating StarRiver Group's internal operations so quickly would have been nearly impossible... unless she had inside help. Nina may have left StarRiver, but she had worked there for years, intimately familiar with every employee's strengths and weaknesses. With her calculating nature, buying loyalty would have been child's play.

The answer was obvious - Rachel and Nina were working together. "The enemy of my enemy is my friend," I thought bitterly. Rachel certainly knew how to play people.

"Serena Sinclair," a guard's voice cut through my thoughts. "You have a visitor. Come with us, and no funny business."

My heart sank, wondering who it could be. Quinn, perhaps? Had there been a breakthrough in the case?

The moment I stepped into the visitation room and saw Nina standing there, my fists clenched involuntarily. I noticed Nina registering my reaction, and though she tried to hide it, I could sense the satisfaction radiating from her.

"Sis, how could you be so foolish?" she said, her voice dripping with fake concern. "Tax evasion? Really? StarRiver Group always paid its taxes diligently when Dad was chairman. Even with the surge in profits since you took over, there was no reason to do something so... illegal."

I couldn't help but let out a cold laugh. "Drop the act, Nina. This has your fingerprints all over it. Save your crocodile tears for someone who might actually believe them."

"What are you talking about?" She immediately protested, eyes wide with practiced innocence. "How could I possibly do something like this? I don't have that kind of influence anymore."

I met her gaze steadily. "You're right - you don't have that kind of power. You just have an endless supply of schemes. The real power is coming from someone else, someone standing behind you."

Seeing her expression flicker, I knew I'd hit the mark. I continued, my voice low and warning: "Nina, let me give you some advice. There are certain people you shouldn't cross. They're far beyond your league."

"Hmph." She finally dropped her mask.

"Don't act so high and mighty, Serena," she sneered, malice gleaming in her eyes. "You're just jealous. Jealous that I've made powerful connections while you're rotting in here! And you have no one to blame but yourself - you just had to challenge the wrong people. I actually thought you were something special. I thought Lucas Harrington was so deeply in love with you that nothing could come between you. But look - you've been locked up for a day and a night, and where is he? When it comes down to business interests, how much do you really think you're worth to him?"



Nina's POV

I finally let my satisfaction bubble to the surface. Seeing Serena trapped here, I couldn't resist flaunting my victory. 

"I should thank you, Serena," I said, unable to contain my excitement. "I was almost foolish enough to pursue Lucas back then. If I had succeeded, I'd be the one under attack now. So really, I owe you my gratitude." The words flowed freely now that I no longer had to maintain my facade.

But Serena's response cut like ice. "You didn't stay away from Lucas because you were smart. You stayed away because you never had a chance."

Her words stung like a slap. I felt heat rise to my cheeks, knowing she was right. Lucas Harrington had never even looked my way. The memory of his indifference only fueled my anger.

"So what?" I spat back. "Should a woman's life revolve around men? Unlike you, I've never taken men seriously. They're just stepping stones to me. You're the fool who keeps getting burned by trusting them. You deserve everything that's happening to you!" I poured all my venom into the words.

Her sudden silence told me I'd hit a nerve. Remembering Rachel's instructions, I switched to a gentler tone: "Look, Serena, we're still sisters. Let me give you some friendly advice - you can't count on Lucas anymore. You're smart enough to figure out who's really behind all this. Don't fight it. It'll only make things worse..."

Slience stretched between us. Her indifferent face irritated me. "I'm trying to help you, Serena. I did warn you. Who can you really depend on now?"

The metallic screech of the door interrupted my threat. I turned around and felt my blood run cold.

*Lucas Harrington. Here. How?*

Rachel had assured me he was overseas and wouldn't interfere! My heart hammered against my ribs. But what truly shocked me was seeing Rachel herself walking in behind him.

I stood frozen, trying to make sense of this betrayal. Why was Rachel with Lucas? Everyone seemed to look through me as if I were invisible.

The final blow came when Lucas walked straight to Serena and said simply, "The bail paperwork is done. You can leave now."

*What the f**k?* I couldn't believe my ears. I clenched my fists so hard my nails dug into my palms, jealousy burning through my veins. What made Serena so special that Lucas would go to such lengths for her? And why hadn't Rachel stopped this?

Fighting for composure, I forced a concerned smile. "That's wonderful, Sis! You can finally leave this awful place. The conditions in here must have been terrible..."

But Serena didn't even spare me a glance as she stood and walked toward Lucas. I felt an overwhelming wave of humiliated and fury, especially with Rachel and Lucas there. I was silently cursing Serena the whole time.

Watching them leave together, with Rachel following, I felt an overwhelming wave of defeat and fury. The morning sun streaming through the barred windows seemed to mock me, illuminating my complete failure.

I remained standing in the visitation room long after they'd gone. The victory I'd been savoring just minutes ago had turned to ashes in my mouth. The scene burned itself into my memory, along with the bitter realization that I'd been nothing but a pawn in someone else's game. Had I lost this round so completely?
###chapter 181
Serena's POV

Following Lucas out of the detention center, I spotted Eleanor waiting by her Tesla Model S. After twenty-four hours of preparing for the worst, I hadn't expected her to be the first familiar face I'd see.

The moment Eleanor caught sight of me, she rushed forward and enveloped me in a tight embrace. "Serena, you're finally out! You look like you've been through a lot." Her voice cracked, eyes rimmed with red.

Her concern warmed my heart. I didn't want those closest to me to worry. "It wasn't as bad as I imagined," I offered a slight smile, trying to lighten the mood.

I knew Eleanor could see through my brave front, but right now, maintaining this facade of calm was all I could manage. Perhaps she expected me to break down in tears, but crying wouldn't solve anything. 

Rachel's voice cut through the moment, "Eleanor, would you mind taking Serena home? Lucas and I need to leave - My grandfather just arrived in Manhattan unexpectedly." She paused before adding, "We really can't keep him waiting."

I noticed Eleanor's sharp glance at Rachel but appreciated her choice to remain silent. I could sense her hostility toward Rachel, but I had no energy to deal with such dynamics right now.

"We should go, Lucas. Your grandfather and mine are waiting. If we delay any longer, I'm worried that..." Rachel trailed off meaningfully.

I felt Lucas's gaze on me but deliberately avoided meeting his eyes. In this moment, I chose to respond to his presence with complete detachment. No accusations, no emotional display - treating him like a stranger. This distance was my only form of self-protection right now.

After they left, Eleanor and I got into her car. During the drive through bustling streets, she couldn't contain her frustration about Rachel. "That manipulative woman, she must be behind all this. Playing the perfect lady in front of Lucas while plotting who knows what."

I remained silent. The detention had left me exhausted, but more importantly, my mind was consumed with how to handle my case. Nina was right about one thing - in this ruthless world, my power to fight back was minimal. But I couldn't give up yet.

Back at my apartment, Eleanor insisted I take a shower while she ordered dinner. I gave a brief nod and retreated to my room. Standing before the mirror, I finally saw my haggard reflection. 

Gone was the polished professional who once thought she had life figured out, who believed success was simply a matter of determination and hard work. That version of me seemed to belong to another lifetime now.

The weight of everything finally crashed down. My carefully maintained composure crumbled, and tears began streaming down my face. But I knew Eleanor was just outside - sweet, concerned Eleanor who had already done so much. I couldn't let her hear me break down.

Covering my mouth with trembling hands, I turned on the shower to mask any sound. The water's steady rhythm provided cover as quiet sobs wracked my body. Here, in this small sanctuary of steam and solitude, I could finally let go of the facade and allow myself to cry.

When I emerged from the shower, I found Eleanor had ordered an impressive spread. She kept piling food onto my plate, and looking at the growing mountain of gourmet dishes, I couldn't help but joke, "Are you worried I won't get food like this if I end up back in there?"

I'd meant to lighten the mood, but Eleanor's eyes welled up again. "Don't say things like that," she said urgently. "Lucas will fix this. He'll do whatever it takes to-"

"Let's not talk about him," I cut her off. I couldn't bear to discuss Lucas, nor did I want to explain why. Right now, I needed to face this alone.

We finished dinner in comfortable silence. Though I could tell Eleanor wanted to say more, to defend her brother, she held back. I was grateful for her understanding.

After dinner, I reached for my phone to call Quinn. She was not only my most trusted lawyer but also my only hope right now. My fingers trembled slightly as I dialed her number.

"I'm out of custody now. Would it be possible to meet and discuss my case?" I tried to keep my voice steady.

"Of course. Where are you? I can come to you." Her professional tone provided a small measure of comfort.

"I'm at home. I'll text you the address."

"Perfect. I'll be there shortly."

Within thirty minutes, Quinn arrived at my apartment. Her confident presence helped ease some of the tension in my shoulders. Eleanor seemed surprised by Quinn's arrival but quickly caught on. "You're here about Serena's case, right?"

However, Quinn's news made my heart sink. "Yes. I just received the latest updates on your case. Due to what they're calling 'sufficient evidence' - and more importantly, some powerful people pushing things along - your trial is set for two weeks from now. It will be a public hearing."

I heard Eleanor's sharp intake of breath. "That soon? Will we have enough time to gather our evidence?"

"It's... not ideal," Quinn said diplomatically, though her expression spoke volumes.

"Can't we delay it somehow?" Eleanor pressed.
###chapter 182
Serena's POV

"We can't refuse without valid grounds." Quinn's directness cut through any false hope.

I heard Eleanor curse under her breath, but I found myself becoming oddly calm. If we couldn't change the trial date, we needed to focus on what we could control. "If we lose the first trial, can we appeal?"

Quinn shook her head. "Technically yes, but realistically? The people behind this won't leave that door open. The judge will likely dismiss it immediately. We essentially have just these two weeks."

She then detailed her investigation findings. The bank's surveillance cameras had "coincidentally" malfunctioned. Jessa was adamant that everything had been done under my direction. Vincent had provided documents bearing what appeared to be my signature on every single page. Each detail felt like another nail in a carefully constructed coffin.

When Quinn handed me the signed documents, I examined them carefully. "This is my handwriting style, but I know I didn't sign these." I could hear the tension in my voice. 

As we sat in heavy silence, the doorbell rang. Before I could respond, Eleanor had already rushed to answer it.

The moment Lucas walked in, my heart constricted painfully. I forced myself to maintain my composure, choosing silence over the thousand words threatening to spill out.

"Lucas, thank goodness you're here!" Eleanor's excitement was palpable. "We were just going over Serena's case with Quinn. They're being incredibly devious. You need to take a look at this."

"Mm." His response was characteristically brief.

When I saw Quinn about to hand the case files to him, I reached out without hesitation to intercept them. Even as I felt his gaze on me, I kept my voice steady: "That won't be necessary, Mr. Harrington."

The atmosphere in the room instantly crystallized. But I had made my decision. This legal battle was one I needed to face with my own strength.

Quinn seemed hesitant to intervene. Eleanor, however, rushed to break the uncomfortable silence. "Serena, Lucas might be able to spot something we've missed..."

"No." My response was sharp and absolute, leaving no room for negotiation. I knew Eleanor would understand my position - in my shoes, she'd likely make the same choice.

I noticed Eleanor exchanging a meaningful glance with Lucas. She turned to Quinn with surprising enthusiasm. "Quinn, I saw this gorgeous outfit the other day that would look perfect on you. Let's go shopping!"

"Sure," Quinn agreed smoothly, catching on immediately.

As I watched them leave, I swallowed the words rising in my throat. 

*What could I possibly say to Lucas now? It felt like everything that needed to be said had already been spoken, yet what had it achieved? Nothing.*

"I know you blame me," Lucas's voice cut through the silence. "And I won't deny my part in your current situation. While I can't make immediate amends, my priority is resolving this case. I promise you won't face any harm."

His words sparked a bitter laugh in my chest. "Any harm, Mr. Harrington? Do you think what I'm experiencing now isn't harmful enough? Or does it only count if I spend the next decade in prison?" I met his eyes directly, challenging him.

I watched his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed, but I pressed on. "In fact, Mr. Harrington, you know better than anyone that the most direct solution isn't you playing the hero with evidence and defense strategies. It's you marrying Rachel and cutting all ties with me!"

My words plunged the room into silence. I saw him smile - a smile filled with such profound sadness that it almost made me waver.

"Serena." His voice softened, revealing a vulnerability I'd never heard before. "Can't we work through this together?"

The pain in my chest was sharp and immediate. Lucas Harrington, usually so dominant and assertive, now sounded utterly defeated. But I couldn't let my resolve crumble. I had to stand my ground.

"When your engagement was announced, I made myself very clear," I continued, my voice steady despite the tremor in my heart. "Our relationship wasn't deep enough for me to bear everything for you. And now look where we are - I'm facing retaliation from the Thornes because of you, and I don't have the resources to fight them. Why should I pay the price for your history with Rachel? Tell me, Lucas, how is that fair?!"

I could see each word landing like a physical blow. Something flickered in his eyes - doubt, perhaps, about his choices. In that moment, I could almost read his thoughts: wondering if he should give in, become the puppet they wanted him to be, numbly marry a woman he didn't love.

But I was surprised by his response. "Give me one chance," his voice was low and tremble. "That's all I'm asking."

This version of Lucas, so unlike his usual self, made my heart ache. But I couldn't back down. For once, I had to choose myself.

"A chance for what?" I asked, keeping my voice level despite the storm of emotions inside. "To watch everything I've built crumble because I'm caught in the crossfire between you and Rachel? To lose everything I've worked for because I dared to care about you?"
###chapter 183
Lucas's POV

I watched her resolved face, the sight sending a sharp pain through my chest. At this point, I could only make one final promise: "If I can't keep you safe through this, I'll marry Rachel. I'll never disturb your life again."

I knew I was gambling everything on this last hope. My heart pounded as I waited for her response, watching as she seemed to struggle with words before choosing silence.

I could guess what she was thinking. Ever since she'd discovered my deception about Milo and Stella - while deliberately getting close to her - she'd lost all trust in me. She surely believed I'd approached her purely for revenge: revenge for her disappearance years ago, revenge for abandoning kids without a backward glance.

The rational demeanor she maintained broke my heart, watching her deliberately deny herself any chance of getting close to me again. I understood. After Ian, then encountering someone like me, she was exhausted. In her life now, besides Milo and Stella, she refused to trust anyone.

"Fine," she agreed with resignation, her expression unchanged. I could tell she wasn't agreeing out of trust in me.


But just getting her agreement made me delighted. I knew her well enough as a businesswoman to recognize she'd accepted this as a transaction after weighing the pros and cons. At least this way, she could ensure her safety and avoid unwarranted imprisonment.

At her agreement, I felt myself slowly exhale. I had to admit, my palms had been sweating with anxiety.

"Let's look at the case," she said, handing me the files with clinical detachment, clearly unwilling to discuss anything else.

I took the documents and began studying them carefully. The situation was even more complex than I'd anticipated, each detail revealing the intricate nature of our opponents' planning. After a long while, I finally spoke: "Mind if I take a copy?"

"No," she replied, keeping it brief.

"Thank you." My voice rised and my gratitude was genuine, even in this professional exchange of case files. 

Her expression changed slightly at my excited response, but it quickly faded back to a blank stare.

"I should go. I'll call you the moment I have any progress," I said, not wanting to waste any more precious time.

"I only have two weeks," she reminded me from behind.

"I know." My response was firm, certain.

I forced myself to maintain a composed expression as I left, not wanting her to see my anxiety. But the moment I was out of her sight, my pace quickened. The case was indeed challenging, but I couldn't let her down. This might be my last chance.

In the car, I was already mentally dissecting every detail of the case. I knew these two weeks would be a race against time, and I had to win. Because this time, losing wasn't an option.




Serena's POV

I kept my head down, studying the case details, but I could feel Eleanor's steady gaze on me. Without looking up, I asked quietly, "What do you want to say?"

"Well, about my brother..." she began tentatively.

I didn't cut her off. Perhaps my earlier conversation with Lucas had shifted something subtle in my emotions.

Sensing my tacit permission, Eleanor seemed to find her courage. "The marriage to Rachel - he's being backed into a corner. I know he hasn't handled things perfectly between you and Rachel, but how could he? When he started pursuing you, he had no idea the Thornes were harboring these intentions. If he'd known, he would have dealt with them first before even thinking about approaching you."

I listened silently, feeling a familiar bitterness rise in my chest. Eleanor continued, her words coming faster now. "But once feelings developed between you two, and the Thornes learned about your existence, there was almost no way for you to stay completely clear of the Lucas-Rachel situation. Well, there was one way - if Lucas immediately cut all ties with you and agreed to be with Rachel. But he doesn't love her. Even if you weren't in the picture, he would never marry her."

She leaned forward slightly, her expression earnest. "Ironically, your presence became the Thornes' leverage against him. They must have realized how important you are to Lucas, which is why they're targeting you to force his hand. I'm not blaming you, please don't think that. I'm just trying to explain how difficult this is for him."

Watching Eleanor's anxious explanation, I understood her concern. She didn't want me to hate her brother; she wanted me to understand the pressure he was under.

"And I can promise you this," her voice grew remarkably firm, "my brother would sacrifice anything to keep you safe. Please don't be too hard on him? It would break his heart."

"I'm not making things difficult for him," I replied evenly, my voice carefully neutral. "We've reached an agreement about how to proceed civilly."

"What agreement?" she asked immediately, curiosity evident in her voice.

I didn't want to keep secrets from Eleanor, but I also didn't want her worrying more about our situation. "We'll discuss it later."

I could sense Eleanor picking up on my continued resistance regarding her brother, heard her soft sigh. 

*Matters of the heart were difficult for outsiders to fully grasp, even those closest to us.*

"Oh, right," she suddenly perked up, as if remembering something important.

I lifted my head to look at her.

"My brother has a journal - did you know about it?" she said.

"Hmm?" This was completely new information to me.

"I snuck a peek at it once," she continued, watching me intently. "I vaguely remember him writing about this girl. He mentioned she was really athletic - excellent at swimming and running."

At those words, my heart skipped a beat.
###chapter 184
Serena's POV

Eleanor's words caught me off guard. "You and Drew went to the same high school, and you were athletic too. I think my brother might have liked you even back then."

My heart raced and my fingers unconsciously traced the edge of the documents, a subtle tremor betraying my composed exterior, unsuring how to process this unexpected information.

"Of course, I'm just guessing," Eleanor added casually. "My brother's such a closed book - he never talks about these things." She seemed to find it hard to believe herself that her ice-cold brother could have been so secretly sentimental at such a young age.

Before I could dwell on it, Eleanor changed the subject. "Serena, I have my final scene to shoot tonight. It should have been done ages ago, but I've been too busy with other commitments to get back to the set. Once it's wrapped, I'm having my agent clear my schedule. I want to be here with you through the trial."

"You don't need to do that. I don't want to interfere with your work..." I tried to refuse, but Eleanor wouldn't let me finish.

"This is entirely my choice, so don't try to talk me out of it," she insisted. "My assistant's taking me to the set soon. We should finish around two or three in the morning. Just wait for me here, okay?"

Faced with such genuine concern, I chose silence. Sometimes, rejecting someone who truly cares for you is its own form of cruelty.

After Eleanor left, I sat alone on the couch, lost in thought. I knew I couldn't really find peace - not with the legal battle hanging over my head. I wasn't that carefree. Yet my mind kept circling back to Eleanor's words about "love at first sight."

My fingers trembled slightly as I finally reached for my phone and dialed his number. 

"Hello, it's me." I said softly.

"What's wrong?" His voice carried a hint of restraint, almost like he was surprised but pleased by my call.

"About my case," I said, deciding to focus on our shared concern, "I think Nina should be our primary suspect."

"Agreed," he responded immediately. "I'm having people look into the connection between your company's finance department and Nina. We need to find some trace evidence. Either Jessa has something to hide that Nina's using as leverage, or the incentive was significant enough for them to sacrifice themselves."

I considered this carefully. "The first scenario seems more likely."

"I'll work on getting more details about the financial officer's situation."

"Since this was clearly orchestrated," I cautioned, "any movement on our part could tip them off."

"I'll ensure the investigation is discreet."

"Thank you," I said formally.

There was a pause on the other end before he replied softly, "It's the least I can do."

After hanging up, I could feel that subtle distance between us, professional yet charged with unspoken emotions. Taking a deep breath, I leaned back against the couch, feeling more lost than ever.




Eleanor's POV

As I stood watching the stunt preparations, my frustration grew. A stunt double was getting rigged up for my final scene - a high-wire sequence that was supposed to be my dramatic exit from the show.

"What's going on?" I turned to my assistant, not bothering to hide my annoyance. After years of doing my own stunts, this felt like a step backward.

"Director Gillard's decision," she replied cautiously. I could sense her tension - she was probably worried I'd storm off to confront Jace like I had in the past.

My assistant rushed to explain, seeing my darkening expression. "Eleanor, he's just looking out for you. The jump is from the wall - almost thirty feet up. And you've mentioned your fear of heights before. The double really looks like you, no one will be able to tell. You'll just need to film a few close-ups."

I had to admit, she had a point. While I'd done wire work before, it was usually just to enhance fight sequences. I'd never filmed anything from this height. And yes, I did have a fear of heights, though I hated admitting it. As much as Jace irritated me, I couldn't deny he was the director. Plus, I didn't want to be responsible for holding up production.

"Let's take a look," I said finally, swallowing my pride as I headed toward the main set.

The scene was set up in the largest soundstage, with massive green screens surrounding a partial recreation of the wall. The stunt team was helping my double adjust her harness while Jace gave her detailed instructions. I studied her carefully - she did look remarkably similar to me, around the same age with a sweet, earnest demeanor.

Watching her, I felt an unexpected twinge of empathy. With her looks and work ethic, she could probably make it as an actress herself with the right breaks. The entertainment industry was always hungry for fresh talent.

When they hoisted her up into position, I noticed her trembling. Despite her brave face, she was clearly terrified. My irritation melted into guilt as I watched her shaking form suspended in the air. I made a mental note to treat her to dinner after the shoot and get her a thank-you gift. It couldn't be easy literally putting your life on the line to make someone else look good.

A deafening crack shattered my thoughts.

My heart stopped as I looked up to see the double swaying precariously, one of her support wires suddenly snapped. Screams erupted around me as she began to fall. I stood frozen, watching in horror as she plummeted directly toward me.

Everything seemed to slow down, yet happened too fast to react. The sickening thud as she crashed into me, the impact knocking us both to the ground, the sharp pain shooting through my body - it all blurred together in a moment of pure chaos.

Lying there stunned, my mind went completely blank. The studio lights above swam in and out of focus as shouts and running footsteps echoed distantly. Someone was calling my name, but I couldn't respond. The weight of the double's unconscious body pressed against me, making it hard to breathe.

Blood trickles down my forehead, warm and sticky. The metallic scent fills my nostrils as crimson droplets blur my vision. I gingerly touch the wound, wincing at the sharp pain. My fingertips come away red, confirming what I already knew.

"Eleanor! Eleanor, can you hear me?" My assistant's face appeared above me, pale with panic.

I tried to speak but could only manage a weak groan. Every inch of my body screamed in protest as I attempted to move.

"Don't try to get up!" Jace's voice cut through the chaos. "Someone call an ambulance!"

This is the last thing I heard.
###chapter 185
Jace's POV

I sat trembling on the hard plastic bench in the hospital corridor, staring at the blood on my hands. Eleanor's or her double's - I couldn't tell anymore. Maybe both. The scene kept replaying in my mind: rushing from behind the camera, lifting Eleanor's limp body from beneath her stunt double, shouting for someone to call an ambulance. My heart had nearly stopped in that moment.

I should wash it off, but I couldn't bring myself to move. What if something happened while I was gone?

No. I couldn't let myself think that way.

The chaos at the studio felt like a lifetime ago, though it had only been about an hour. The crew's initial shocked paralysis, then the frantic scramble to help. I'd loaded Eleanor into one car, her double into another, both racing toward hospital with sirens wailing.

Now all I could do was wait. The red emergency light above the double doors mocked me with its steady glow. It was all my fault. I was the director. I was responsible for every person on that set.

Rapid footsteps echoing down the corridor snapped me from my spiral of guilt. Clara Harrington and Grant Yates were hurrying toward me, their faces tight with worry. My stomach clenched at the sight of them.

"Jace! How is she? What happened?" Clara's voice cracked as they reached me. "How does a simple stunt go so wrong?"

I forced myself to meet their eyes, struggling to keep my voice steady. "Wire malfunction. The stunt double fell... landed on Eleanor."

"How bad is it?" Grant's face had gone ashen. "Please tell me my daughter's going to be okay."

"They're still working on her. In the ER." The words felt like glass in my throat. "Both of them."

Clara swayed slightly, and Grant quickly steadied her. "She'll pull through," he said, though his voice trembled. "Eleanor's always been a fighter."

"I never should have let her stay in this business," Clara whispered, tears gathering in her eyes. "The modeling was safe enough, but acting... all these stunts... I should have known something like this would happen."

Their words twisted the knife of guilt deeper. I wanted to apologize, to explain, to do something to ease their pain. But what could I possibly say?

The emergency room doors swung open, and a nurse strode out. "Family of Eleanor Yates?"

"Here!" Clara stepped forward immediately.

"The patient has sustained liver damage resulting in severe hemorrhaging," the nurse explained clinically. "She needs blood transfusions. We need donations from non-related individuals with AB negative blood type. The family's blood can serve as backup. The more donors we can find quickly, the better her chances."

I watched Clara's face drain of color as Grant fumbled for his phone. "I'll call the company," he said shakily. "Have them send anyone with AB negative right away."

My entire body went rigid, cold sweat breaking out across my skin. AB negative. I had it. But I couldn't.











Clara's POV

Standing in the sterile hallway outside the emergency room, I watched Grant hang up his phone. My heart was racing as I waited for news about Eleanor. 

"Lucas will arrange it," Grant turned to me, his voice strained but trying to sound reassuring. "They will be here soon. Very soon..."

In that moment, a chilling thought cut through my mind like a blade of ice. My heart skipped a beat as a terrible possibility emerged. My voice trembled slightly as I asked, "Grant, what's your blood type?"

"Type A," he answered without hesitation.

The words hit me like a physical blow. I'm Type A as well - I knew this with absolute certainty. But then... how could Eleanor possibly be Type AB? It defied every basic principle of genetics. Two Type A parents simply couldn't have an AB child.

I looked at Grant and saw the color drain from his face as the same realization dawned on him. Our eyes met in a moment of wordless horror, neither of us daring to voice the impossible question hanging between us.

I rushed to the nurses' station. "Excuse me," I said, trying to keep my voice steady, "could you please check with the ER team? I think there must be a mistake about Eleanor Yates's blood type. My husband and I are both Type A. It's impossible for her to be Type AB."

The nurse nodded, picking up the phone. "Let me verify that for you, Mrs. Harrington."

Those seconds of waiting felt like years. Each breath seemed to catch in my throat as I watched the nurse speak quietly into the phone. When she finally looked up at me, her expression confirmed my worst fears.

"They've double-checked, Mrs. Harrington. Eleanor is definitely Type AB."

The world seemed to tilt beneath my feet. My mind raced through countless memories - Eleanor's first steps, her smile that looked so much like Grant's, the way she wrinkled her nose just like him when she concentrated. How could she not be ours?

The oppressive silence in the hallway was suddenly broken by the sound of hurried footsteps. I turned to see a middle-aged woman rushing toward the nurses' station, her face etched with worry.

"How is Maeve?" she demanded breathlessly. "Please, I need to know how my daughter is doing!"

As she stepped into the light, I felt another shock of recognition. Despite the twenty years that had passed, I knew that face. "Maya?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

She froze for a moment, then seemed to collect herself, forcing an awkward smile. "Mr. and Mrs. Harrington," she said, bobbing her head, nervous greeting.

Anger flared through my confusion. "What are you doing here?" I demanded.

"I... I heard my daughter was injured during filming," she stammered, not quite meeting my eyes. "I came to check on her."

The fury I'd been suppressing burst forth. "Your daughter fell on top of mine," I snapped. "Eleanor could be dying because of her!"

Maya's reaction was startling in its intensity. "How is the young miss? Is it serious?" The desperate concern in her voice seemed oddly personal.

I stared at her, trying to understand the strange undercurrent I sensed in her behavior. But before I could question her further, she spun around to face the nurses' station. "Please, how is my daughter?"

Just then, the emergency room doors swung open. They wheeled someone out, her face pale but her injuries apparently not life-threatening.
###chapter 186
Clara's POV

As I watched Maeve being wheeled out of the emergency room, a memory hit me with the force of a physical blow. Twenty years ago, when I was pregnant, my housekeeper Maya had been pregnant too. She'd given birth at the Harrington estate, then suddenly announced she was taking her daughter back to her hometown. She'd left our employment immediately after...

NO! IT COULDN'T BE! The blood in my veins turned to ice as my face drained of color. I refused to believe something so outrageous could have happened to me. The very thought that Eleanor, the daughter I'd lovingly raised for over two decades, might not be my biological child was ridiculous.

But Eleanor's blood type... I forced myself to stay calm, though my voice trembled as I rushed forward to ask the doctor, "What's her blood type?"

"Type A," the doctor replied. The answer struck my heart like a hammer blow.

I stared at Maeve, noting the unmistakable resemblance to Eleanor - they could have been sisters. My mind refused to process what I was seeing. My whole body shook as I kept my eyes fixed on Maeve, the world blurring at the edges.

When I saw Maya trying to wheel Maeve away, I stepped forward to block their path. "Don't move," I commanded.

"Mrs. Harrington, my daughter needs to get to her room..." Maya's voice was panicked.

I locked eyes with her, enunciating each word deliberately: "Are you sure she's your daughter?"

Watching Maya stammer and avoid my gaze, I felt the last shred of hope crumble inside me. I turned to look at my husband, Grant, who stood frozen in place.

Rage, despair, and betrayal coursed through my body. I couldn't help but scream at him, "Grant Yates, what's going on here? Tell me! What's your relationship with Maya? Who is Eleanor's real mother?"

My hysterical shouts echoed through the hallway. Just then, a group of people rushed in. I saw Lucas hurrying toward us, asking urgently, "We've got ten people here, that should be enough. How's Eleanor?"

Seeing Lucas, I finally lost all control of my emotions. Tears streamed down my face uncontrollably.

"Aunt Clara." Lucas's voice changed when he saw my state.

The emergency room doors opened again, and a nurse hurried out. "Eleanor Yates's family? Are the Type AB donors here? The patient's condition is critical."

"Stop! Nobody helps Eleanor until we get answers!" As Lucas moved to organize the blood donors, I suddenly blocked their path. 

"Grant!" I turned back to my silently standing husband, my face contorted with fury and pain.
Grant slumped in his chair, head bowed in silence. As time crept by, Maya couldn't stand it any longer. She rushed forward, crying out, "Yes! Eleanor isn't your daughter - Maeve is! I switched them when they were born!"

The truth hit me like a physical blow, shattering every foundation of my world. The room began to spin, and I felt myself starting to collapse.

"Aunt." Lucas caught me just before I fell.

I stared at Grant, still standing there like a statue, and felt my entire world crumbling around me. Twenty years of memories, of love, of trust - all built on a lie. 

Around me, the hospital corridor had become crowded with Harrington Group employees, their faces showing a mix of concern and confusion at the tense scene before them.

"Aunt." Lucas stepped forward, his voice gentle but firm. "Let's save her first. We can sort everything else out later."

I felt the weight of every eye in that hallway on me, but all I could see was the lifetime of lies stretching out behind me. My voice came out as cold as ice: "No one moves. No one helps her."

"Aunt Clara, please-" Lucas started again, but I cut him off with a sharp gesture.

"Not until I know the truth. All of it." My hands were trembling, but my voice remained steady.

Maya collapsed to her knees in front of me, her face streaked with tears. "Please, I'm begging you - save Eleanor! This is all my fault. She's innocent in all this..."

I watched her grovel at my feet, her tears meaningless puddles on floor. Every sob, every plea for Eleanor's life only stokes the inferno of my rage.

"Innocent?!" The word tears from my throat as I kick her aside. My voice rises, trembling with barely contained fury. "What about my daughter's innocence? You forced my flesh and blood to be someone's stand-in! If anything happens to her now - after I've finally found her - are you saying this reunion should become our final goodbye?!"

Heat floods my face as I tower over her crumpled form. Every cell in my body screams for vengeance, demanding retribution for her audacity. The sheer nerve of this woman, playing puppet master with my daughter's life!

"I'm sorry," Maya sobbed, her hands clasped in front of her. "I'm so sorry. I was desperate... I thought I was doing what was best..."

"Best?" My laugh sounded hysterical even to my own ears. "You stole my child. You let me raise yours while my own daughter..." The words choked in my throat.

When Maya crawls to Grant, whimpering that Eleanor is his daughter too, a laugh rips from my chest - harsh, brittle, cruel.

"You're begging him?" Pure contempt drips from every syllable. "What exactly do you think he is in this house? He's nothing but a kept man. Every thread on his back, every morsel on his plate, every breath he takes - it all comes from me, Clara Harrington! Without me, he's less than nothing. Just a worthless dog!"

Through all of this, Grant had remained silent, a statue in an expensive suit. But now he finally spoke, his voice barely above a whisper. "That night... I was drunk, angry after our fight..."

I turned to face him. He couldn't meet my eyes.

"I made a terrible mistake," he continued, each word seeming to pain him. "Maya... it was just one night. I tried to pay her off the next day, but she said she needed the job, promised she wouldn't cause trouble. She seemed honest, and I was afraid if I pushed too hard..."

"And then I got pregnant," I finished for him, the pieces falling into horrible place. "And so did she."

Grant nodded miserably. "I tried to convince her to leave, but she kept insisting the baby wasn't mine, said she had a husband back home..."

"The babies looked so similar," Maya broke in, her voice small. "They both had his features. I... I thought I was giving my daughter a better life. A chance at everything I could never provide."

"While my daughter grew up without her real family?" The words tasted like ashes in my mouth. Twenty years of memories flashed through my mind - birthdays, holidays, school plays - all with the wrong child.

The nurse stepped forward again, her voice urgent. "Mrs. Harrington, we really need to-"

I turned to Grant, who flinched at my gaze. "Everything you have - everything you are - came from me, from the Harrington name! You're a parasite!"

The corridor fell silent except for Maya's quiet sobs. I looked at the assembled group of blood donors, these people who'd rushed here in the middle of the night to help a girl they barely knew. A mistress's girl.

"Aunt Clara," Lucas said softly, placing a steady hand on my shoulder. "Whatever happens next, right now there's a life at stake. Eleanor may not be who we thought she was, but she's still the girl you raised. Can you live with letting her die?"

I closed my eyes, feeling tears slip down my cheeks.

"She must die."
###chapter 187
Lucas's POV

Aunt Clara's face was a mask of fury and pain, while the assembled blood donors shifted uncomfortably, uncertain whether to move forward or retreat.

From my position near the emergency room doors, I could see every subtle detail - the trembling of Maya's hands as she knelt on the cold floor, the way Grant seemed to shrink into himself, and most importantly, the barely noticeable movement of Jace as he quietly slipped closer to the emergency room entrance. 

"Lucas." Aunt Clara's voice cut through the tense silence. Her eyes, when they met mine, were filled with a fierce determination that I recognized from countless board meetings. "You and I are the only real family here. Blood is thicker than water. I trust you won't betray me, won't do anything to break my heart."

I understood the weight behind her words. In our world, family loyalty wasn't just about emotion - it was about survival. Still, I couldn't help but think of Eleanor lying in the emergency room, her life hanging by a thread.

Before I could respond, Maya lurched forward, her forehead hitting the floor with a sickening thud. When she raised her head, blood trickled down her face from where she'd split the skin. "Please," she begged, her voice cracking. "Please save Eleanor. She's innocent in all this!"

The sight of her blood-streaked face triggered something in Aunt Clara. She took a step back, her expression twisted with disgust and cold determination. She approached Maeve, who lay there too weak to speak, and addressed the medical staff with an icy command.

"Move her to the best private room. No visitors without my explicit permission."

"Lucas, blood ties are what matter most. Everything else..." Clara glanced meaningfully at Grant, her words trailing off.

The rage and humiliation coursing through her was palpable. In that moment, I could see how desperately she wanted to destroy Grant. "...means nothing."

Clara wheeled Maeve away. I watched as Grant finally stirred from his stupor, taking a halting step toward his wife. "Clara, I-"

"Don't." My voice surprised even me with its coldness. "You brought this on yourself, Grant. If anything happens to Eleanor, it's on your head. Live with that."

He flinched as if I'd struck him, and in that moment, I saw him clearly for what he was - a weak man who had destroyed his family through his own selfishness. 

Maya crawled toward me now, leaving smears of blood on the pristine hospital floor. "Young Master Lucas, please, I'm begging you - save Eleanor..."

I looked down at her, remembering the quiet housekeeper who had always had a kind word for me. How many times had she looked at Eleanor and seen her own daughter? How many times had she watched Maeve and known she was denying her the life she deserved?

"You should have thought of this twenty years ago," I said, my voice devoid of emotion.

"It's all my fault, all my fault..." she kept murmuring through her tears. "Why did Eleanor have to suffer for this..."



Eleanor's POV

Pain. That's the first thing I register - a deep, throbbing ache that seems to radiate from every cell in my body. My head feels like it's being squeezed in a vice, and even without opening my eyes, I can tell the world is spinning. The sharp scent of antiseptic burns my nostrils, mixing unpleasantly with the metallic taste in my mouth.

Beeping. Steady, rhythmic beeping somewhere to my left. A hospital then. Memories flash through my mind in disconnected fragments - the film set, a sudden shout from above, then... nothing.

I force my heavy eyelids open, blinking against the harsh lighting. The first thing that comes into focus is Jace Gillard's face, and my stomach twists with immediate displeasure. 

"Where..." My voice comes out as a rasp, my throat dry and scratchy. "Where am I?"

"You're at Bellevue Hospital." Jace leans forward, relief evident in his expression. "How are you feeling?"

I take in my surroundings - the peeling wallpaper, the dated medical equipment, the narrow bed with its thin mattress. This isn't the private wing at Lenox Hill Hospital where our family usually goes. This is just some regular hospital ward.

"Why didn't you call my parents?" The words come out sharp despite my weakness. "Why am I in this... place?"

"Eleanor, please stay calm. I wanted to assess the situation first before-"

"Assess the situation?" I try to push myself up, ignoring the wave of dizziness that follows. "You mean cover it up, don't you?"

Jace reaches out to steady me, but I jerk away from his touch. "Don't touch me!"

"Miss Yates," a new voice interrupts - a doctor in a white coat standing at the foot of my bed. "You need to lie still. Your liver was injured in the fall, and any sudden movements could exacerbate the damage. You need complete bed rest."

"My liver?" I sink back against the pillows, not from obedience but from a sudden wave of exhaustion. "What about Maeve? Is she okay?"

"She's fine," Jace answers quickly. "Thanks to you, she only got minor bruises. Eleanor, about what happened-"

"Save it." I cut him off, my voice cold. "I'm telling you right now, Jace - I won't cover up your negligence. The equipment that fell wasn't properly secured, and that's on your production team. I won't hide that from my parents or my grandfather."

His face tightens. "That's not what I'm asking. I just think we should handle this carefully-"

The door opens, and my heart lifts at the sight of my mother and brother. "Mom," I call out, unable to keep the relief from my voice.

But she barely glances at me, her expression distant as she moves to speak with the doctor. The dismissal stings more than my physical injuries.
###chapter 188
Eleanor's POV

My mother stands by the window, her silhouette sharp against the muted light, while Lucas remains near the door, unusually quiet.

"Mom," I begin, trying to keep my voice light and cheerful despite the lingering pain in my side. "I'm really fine now. Just can't move around much. Please don't be angry - I'll be more careful next time."

The silence that follows feels heavy, oppressive. She doesn't turn from the window, her posture rigid in her perfectly tailored suit. My fingers unconsciously twist the thin hospital blanket, a nervous habit I've never quite outgrown.

"Mom?" I try again, uncertainty creeping into my voice. "I know you were worried, but-"

"Stop calling me that." Her voice cuts through the room like ice. She finally turns, and I barely recognize the woman before me. Her face, usually so carefully composed, holds nothing but cold disdain. "You're not my daughter."

The words hit me like a physical blow. I glance at Lucas, seeking reassurance, explanation, anything - but my brother's face is a mask of carefully controlled pain.

"What?" I force a laugh, though it sounds hollow even to my own ears. "Mom, what's wrong? If this is about the accident-"

"I said stop calling me that!" She reaches into her designer bag, pulling out an envelope. The paper makes a harsh sound as she unfolds it, the crisp edges somehow threatening in their precision. "This is a DNA test. Read it."

My hands shake as I take the paper. The medical terminology swims before my eyes, but certain phrases stand out with brutal clarity: "No maternal genetic match... exclusion of maternity... 99.99% probability..."

"I don't understand," I whisper, though a terrible understanding is beginning to dawn. "This can't be..."

"You're Grant Yates's daughter," Clara states, each word precise and cutting, "but not mine. My real daughter is Maeve Coleman - your stunt double."

I stared at her in disbelief as her words cut through me like shards of glass. "When I found out the truth, I was as devastated as you are now. Devastated that the daughter I loved so much wasn't my flesh and blood, but my husband's bastard child! And I raised this bastard for twenty-five years while my real daughter suffered out there!"

Memories flash through my mind - the way Maeve sometimes looked at me during filming, the subtle similarities in our features.

I never imagined she would one day point at me and describe me with such cruel words. How could she reduce my entire existence to such a vile term? That mother who loved me so completely - how could she become this cold, hateful stranger before me?

My head spins as I violently shake it, desperate to wake up from what must be some twisted nightmare. This can't be real. None of this makes any sense. The tears start flowing before I can stop them, hot streams down my cheeks as my whole body trembles.

"No," I scream, my voice cracking with hysteria. "No, that's impossible. All these years... you loved me. You-" 

"The love I once had for you has turned to hate." Her voice is devoid of emotion now. "Every time I looked at you - I was nurturing mistress's child while my own daughter lived in obscurity."

"Mom, please..." Each syllable comes out higher and more frantic than the last, like something wild and desperate clawing its way out of my chest. "I'm not... I can't be..."

"Eleanor." Her words dripped with venom. "As much as I once loved you, that's how much I hate you now." She spoke through gritted teeth. "I came here today to make one thing clear - from this moment on, the Harrington house is no longer your home. Get out of my sight immediately. I never want to see you again! I will terminate your entire entertainment career. I will freeze all your assets. And don't bother running to your so-called friends for help - anyone who shows you kindness now is making an enemy of me, Clara Harrington!"

"Everything you have came from the Harrington family, and now I'm taking it all back with interest! You have no right to any of it!"

I turn desperately to Lucas, who hasn't moved from his position by the door. "Brother..."

"I'm sorry, Eleanor," he says softly. "The lawyers are already preparing the papers. All assets will be frozen pending..."

The transition feels surreal - just hours ago, I was Eleanor Harrington. Now... now I'm nothing but an imposter. For over two decades, I've lived a lie as part of Manhattan's most powerful families. Now faced with undeniable proof, I can barely look at myself in the mirror. I feel like nothing but a thief.

"Mom," I whisper, my voice barely audible over the medical equipment. She pauses in her move. "I'm sorry."

She doesn't turn around. Her shoulders stiffen. "Disappearing from my sight forever - that's the only way you can repay the years I wasted on you." She hurried out of the room, unable to bear staying there another second.

The words hit harder than any physical blow could. This woman who raised me, who taught me how to hold my head high in society, who once kissed my scraped knees and celebrated my victories, now she won't even look at me.

"Brother..." I turn to Lucas, desperation clawing at my throat. The silence stretches between us, heavy with unspoken words. "I guess... I can't call you that anymore?"

His jaw tightens, but he doesn't respond. 

"Please," I force myself to focus, to remember my responsibilities even as my world crumbles. "Please tell Serena I can't help with the lawsuit anymore."

"I've already informed her." His voice is controlled, professional - the voice he uses with business associates, not family. Not that I'm family anymore.

The door closes behind them with a final, devastating click. The sound echoes in the suddenly vast emptiness of the hospital room, marking the moment when Eleanor Harrington ceases to exist.
###chapter 189
Eleanor's POV

Jace remains by my bed, a silent sentinel in the growing darkness. The steady drip of the IV provides a rhythm to my scattered thoughts.

A bitter laugh escapes my lips, drawing Jace's attention. "I used to mock you for not being a Harrington," I say, my voice rough with unshed tears. "Called you their lapdog. Karma really is something, isn't it?"

He remains silent, but I catch the slight tension in his shoulders. 

"Turns out I'm not a Harrington either." The words taste like ash in my mouth. "I'm just... nobody."

I catch myself starting to say "Mom" and forcibly correct it to "Clara" in my head. Another habit to break, another piece of my identity to shed.

"You should go," I tell Jace, forcing myself to think practically despite the emotional turmoil. "Mrs. Harrington... I mean, Clara... she's ruthless when she targets someone. Don't let yourself get caught in this mess."

He turns to face me, his expression unreadable in the dim light. Before he can respond, the door bursts open, making us both jump.

A woman rushes in - middle-aged, simple-dressed and disheveled, as though she's been running. Her eyes lock onto me with an intensity that makes me shrink back against the pillows. Something about her face seems vaguely familiar, like looking at a distorted reflection.

"Eleanor," she gasps, and then she's on her knees beside my bed. "I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry!"

The realization of who she must be hits me like a physical blow. My birth mother. The woman who gave me away, who let me live a lie for twenty-five years. Anger rises in my chest, hot and sudden.

"Get out," I whisper, then louder: "Get out!"

She reaches for my hand, but I snatch it away. "Please, let me explain-"

"Explain?" My voice cracks. "Explain how you let them steal someone else's life? How you watched another woman raise your child while the real Harrington daughter lived as a stunt double?"

Tears stream down her face, but I feel no sympathy. Only rage. Only the bitter taste of a life built on lies. "Why?" I demand. "Why did you have to ruin everything like this? I'd rather have had nothing than be hated by someone I loved so much."

The monitors register my increasing heart rate, their beeping becoming more insistent. Jace moves toward the door, presumably to call a nurse, but I barely notice. All I can see is this woman, this stranger who shares my blood, kneeling beside my bed as though she has any right to my forgiveness.

"Please," she tries again, her voice trembling. "You have to understand-"

"I don't have to understand anything," I cut her off, my voice ice-cold despite the fire in my chest. "You want forgiveness? Here's what you can do - disappear. Disappear and never come back. That's the only thing any of you can do for me now."

"I was foolish back then," she begins, her voice trembling. "I thought... why should all the children be Grant's? Why couldn't you have a better life with the Harringtons?"

"Stop," I cut her off, my voice sharp enough to make her flinch. "I don't want to hear your explanations. I don't want to see you."

"Please, Eleanor, you have to understand-"

"Understand?" The word comes out as a harsh laugh. "Get out! You abandoned me once - just stay gone forever. I'll never forgive you!"

Maya takes a step forward, reaching for me. "I was trying to give you a better life-"

"GET OUT!" The scream tears from my throat, making the machines beep frantically. "You ruined everything! You had no right to decide my life like that!"

Jace moves between us, gently but firmly guiding Maya toward the door. I watch them through a haze of tears, my hands clenched so tight my nails dig into my palms. The door closes behind them, and for a moment, blessed silence fills the room.

When Jace returns, I can't bear to look at him. His presence, his concern, his silent support - it all feels like mockery now. The drip of the IV seems deafening in the quiet room.

"When I was a Harrington," I say, my voice eerily calm, "you kept your distance. Now that I'm nothing, why are you still here? To watch me fall?"

"Eleanor-"

"Don't." My eyes fall on the heavy crystal ashtray on the bedside table. "All of this started because of you. Every time you're in my life, everything falls apart."

He steps closer, concern etched on his face. "Eleanor, I once rejected you because - "

The ashtray feels cold and solid in my hand. Before I can think, before I can stop myself, I hurl it at him. There's a sickening thud as it connects with his forehead, and blood immediately starts trickling down his face.

Jace staggers back, more surprised than hurt. The sight of his blood should make me feel guilty, but instead, it fuels something dark and desperate inside me.

"We're done, Jace. Forever." My voice doesn't even sound like my own anymore. "Every misfortune in my life is connected to you. You're my curse, and I'm finally cutting you loose."
###chapter 190
Lucas's POV

I caught Jace just as his knees buckled outside the hospital room, my hand instinctively steadying his shoulder. His face was ashen, and worry gripped my chest.

"How are you holding up?" I asked, noting the telltale pallor of significant blood loss.

It took him several moments to respond, his voice barely above a whisper. "I'm fine."

He was always downplaying everything. "How many units did you transfuse yesterday?"

"Not much." His evasiveness was both expected and frustrating.

I decided not to press further. "Let's get that forehead looked at."

He managed a slight nod, and I kept my hand on his elbow as we made our way to the doctor's office. 

While the doctor cleaned and dressed his wound, I contemplated how to broach the subject. This situation demanded absolute clarity. "With everything that's happened to Eleanor," I began, keeping my voice measured, "I need you to understand that I have to stand with my aunt."

His silence prompted me to continue. "While Eleanor isn't directly responsible for this situation - it's more about the previous generation's... complications - she remains central to everything. And while I understand the complexity, we can't ignore the fact that my aunt had to watch her daughter struggle while another child - specifically, her husband's illegitimate daughter - lived in luxury. That's the betrayal at the core of this."

I watched as Jace absorbed my words, noting his slight nod. Still, I needed to be completely clear. "I'm not telling you to stay away from Eleanor. I'm saying that if you make this choice, you need to be prepared for everything it entails. And I... I can only stand with my aunt."

"Understood" He said calmly. It carried the weight of someone who knew exactly what they were walking into.

I glanced at his bandaged forehead, then checked my watch. "I should go. Serena's case requires my attention, and I can't divide my focus right now. Whatever you decide, I'll respect it."

"Luc." The gravity in his voice made me pause. "Thank you."

The sincerity in those two words warmed something in my chest. I squeezed his shoulder. "We're family. No need for thanks."

Back in my car, I leaned back against the seat, watching evening traffic crawl past the windows. A sigh escaped me as memories surfaced unbidden - Eleanor as a little girl, trailing after me through the mansion's corridors, her pigtails bouncing as she called out "Brother!" That tiny child who used to hide behind my legs at formal events had grown into...

The sharp ring of my phone cut through my reverie. I glanced at the screen, the familiar number pulling me back to present concerns.
"Mr. Harrington, we've uncovered several suspicious transfers from Star River Group's private financial accounts."

"Forward me the records."

"Right away, sir."

I hang up the phone, my mind already racing through the implications of the financial records just uncovered. The transfers to underground gambling accounts could be the break we need in Serena's case. Without hesitation, I dial her number.

"Found new evidence," I say, keeping my voice measured despite the urgency I feel.

"Oh?" Her response is brief, weighted with exhaustion. Through the line, I can picture her in her living room, surrounded by case files. The space feels emptier now without Eleanor's presence, though I push that thought aside.

"I'll come over to explain." 

"Alright." She pauses, then adds, "Eleanor's phone is off. What kind of event requires a shutdown?"

My jaw tightens imperceptibly. Not yet. She can't know about Eleanor yet. "...We'll discuss that later."

Within thirty minutes, I'm at her door. The living room lights cast long shadows as I lay out the account records on her coffee table. Her eyes scan the documents intently, and I notice the slight tension in her shoulders.

"Your financial officer made multiple transfers to this account," I explain, tapping the paper. "Significant amounts. We've confirmed it's linked to an underground gambling operation." I watch her expression carefully as I continue. "These places are ruthless - broken bones, threats to family. Given the pattern, it's likely he fabricated these charges against you to cover gambling debts."

Serena nods slowly, her analytical mind already working. "So we have motive. But what about the source? Have you traced who's funding these accounts?"

"Multiple accounts involved. None connected to Nina Sinclair." I meet her gaze directly. "I'm investigating each one. There will be a trail."

"We're running out of time," she reminds me, concern edging into her voice.

"I'll handle it," I promise, meaning every word.

She shifts focus, surprising me with her next observation. "You know, Quinn mentioned the bank's camera was down when that card was opened. But we don't need the footage - we just need to prove I wasn't there. I already had my secretary secure the company surveillance footage from that day."

I feel a surge of admiration. This is why she's different - always finding angles others miss. 

"Brilliant," I say simply, letting my appreciation show.




Serena's POV

I felt heat rising to my cheeks as Lucas spoke with that indulgent tone he usually reserved for children. Eager to shift away from this awkwardness, I steered the conversation back to his earlier comment. "You mentioned something about Eleanor earlier - what happened to her?"

I noticed how his expression darkened, the warmth draining from his features.

"I wasn't going to tell you, given your own precarious situation," he said carefully. "But I don't dare keep this from you." That word - 'dare' - left me speechless. He was still keeping score.

"Eleanor had an accident on set last night. She's in the hospital-"

"What?" I couldn't help interrupting.

"Don't worry," he continued, his voice steady. "Though the accident was serious, she's stable. There was some liver damage that caused significant bleeding, but she's regained consciousness. Barring complications, she should be discharged within a week."

Anger flared in my chest. "Why wasn't I told? I could have been there for her."

The thought of Eleanor, who had always been nothing but genuine with me, lying in a hospital bed while I sat here oblivious made my blood boil.

"There's more to the story," Lucas said, placing a restraining hand on my shoulder. "The blood loss meant she needed transfusions. That's when they discovered her blood type is AB."

"And?" I asked, my brow furrowing.

"Both my aunt Clara and her husband are type A."

The implications hit me like a physical blow. I stared at him, unable to process what this meant. As he detailed everything that had transpired the previous night, I fell into a stunned silence, imagining how devastated Eleanor must have been upon learning the truth.

"I'm going to the hospital," I declared, already rising to my feet.

"Serena." His hand caught mine.

I turned to him, fury evident in my expression. "Don't try to stop me."

"Are you really planning to stay out of this?" I demanded, meeting his gaze directly. Deep down, I knew his likely answer. From his position, he had no obligation to help Eleanor. Clara was his aunt, and given how she'd been deceived, he should rightfully share in her anger.

But I couldn't help the disappointment that welled up inside me. Eleanor wasn't just some pawn in a game - she was a real person. How could he be so coldly logical about this? Where was his compassion?
###chapter 191
Serena's POV

Lucas met my gaze with characteristic intensity. "Aunt Clara is furious right now. If I intervene on Eleanor's behalf, it will only escalate the situation. The best approach is to let things cool down for a while. Once Aunt Clara's anger subsides, we can handle this more effectively. At least then, Eleanor won't end up with nothing."

My anger flared at his calculated response. "That's your strategy. Do whatever you want, but you have no right to stop me from seeing Eleanor."

"I admit I'm being selfish," he said, his voice measured. "I don't want you becoming my aunt's target. She's forbidden anyone from approaching or helping Eleanor right now. If you go see her, it will only make your situation worse. You're already dealing with the lawsuit."

"That's my problem," I replied coldly.

He persisted, his tone remaining steady. "Besides, Eleanor might not want to see you. She has her pride. Going from being Manhattan's golden girl to... this. Do you think she's ready to face you or anyone else? She probably needs time alone to process everything..."

"Lucas..." I started to argue.

"More importantly," he cut me off, "Jace is watching over her."

I paused, then let out a derisive laugh. "Jace? Really? When Eleanor was still the Harrington heiress, he could barely spare her a glance. Now that she's fallen from grace, you think he'll wade into this mess? And even if he wanted to, what could he do? Your aunt has banned anyone from helping her. What's Jace going to do - get himself thrown out of the family too? You really think he'd go that far for Eleanor?"

"Remember when I told you Jace had his reasons for rejecting Eleanor?" he said suddenly.

I remained silent, unwilling to engage with this line of reasoning.

But as he carefully explained those reasons, each word deliberate and weighted, I felt the ground shift beneath my understanding. In the span of a day, the Harrington family had dropped two bombshells that left me reeling.

Seeing my shocked expression, he concluded simply, "So yes, you can trust Jace in this."

I found myself wavering, my earlier certainty crumbling.

"I understand your friendship with Eleanor," he continued, his voice softening. "And I've never opposed that relationship. Eleanor is a wonderful person, Harrington or not. She deserves true friends. But you've tried calling her - her phone remains off. That says something. It says she doesn't want to be disturbed right now, by anyone."

My heart sank, unable to deny the logic in his words. Perhaps Eleanor really did need this time alone, rather than interference from anyone.




Eleanor's POV

The city was erasing me, one advertisement at a time.

I watched from across the street as workers tore down my billboard in the drizzling rain. They didn't even wait for better weather - that's how desperate everyone was to forget me. My face, printed on expensive paper that had cost thousands to produce, was now being crumpled and tossed into the back of a pickup truck like yesterday's garbage.

I had left the hospital early this morning, slipping out during the nurses' shift change. After a week of turning off my phone and shutting out the world, I couldn't take another day of her visits. Every day she'd come with her homemade soups, her eyes filled with a desperate need for forgiveness that made my skin crawl.

"I don't need this," I'd tell her each time, sometimes knocking the soup container to the floor in frustration. She never argued, never defended herself. She'd just silently clean up the mess and leave, her shoulders hunched with the disappointment. Her silence was worse than any excuse she could have offered.

My heart was screaming. *I don't want your pity or your attempts at redemption! I never want to see you again - not in this lifetime. I won't feel sorry for you, I won't forgive you, and I can't stand seeing you grovel like this. I'm sick of you trying to manipulate me with guilt!*

The headlines about Serena Sinclair's lawsuit still dominated social media, but surprisingly, my true parentage remained hidden. Of course it did - the Harringtons would never voluntarily expose such a scandal. I'd never officially been presented as their daughter anyway, so it was easy enough to keep buried.

November in Manhattan was brutally cold, and I'd left the hospital wearing only thin clothes. The doctor's warnings echoed in my head. "You're still weak. No exposure to cold, no strenuous activity. You need at least a month of rest." 

*But what did it matter now? When you've lost everything that defined you, what's a little physical discomfort?*

I wandered aimlessly through the streets. It was strange - I'd been featured in so many magazines and billboards, yet no one recognized me now. The only looks I got were ones of concern or confusion, probably wondering why anyone would be walking in this weather without a proper coat.

As dusk approached, the city's lights began to flicker on, but they offered no warmth. The rain had soaked through my clothes, and my hair clung to my face in wet strands. I should have been cold, but I felt nothing. 

I kept walking. After all, what else could I do? In a city of millions, I had never felt more alone.
###chapter 192
Eleanor's POV

My feet had carried me through rain-soaked streets all day, until I found myself standing before the Harrington mansion. A bitter laugh escaped my lips. Even when my mind was lost, my body somehow knew where to go - where I used to call home.

The familiar building loomed before me, its windows glowing warmly against the darkening sky. Yet I couldn't bring myself to take another step forward. Exhaustion finally overwhelmed me, and I sank down onto the wet pavement and watched raindrops dance in the streetlight.

"Mr. Harrington is asking for you. Come with me."

The old butler's voice startled me from above, his umbrella suddenly shielding me from the endless drizzle. Shock rippled through me, but I didn't dare hope. I just carefully followed behind him, my feet remembering every step of this path I'd walked countless times before.

By the time we reached the study, I was shaking uncontrollably. Whether from my soaked clothes or my mounting terror, I couldn't tell.

"Bring Miss Yates a wool blanket," Howard Harrington commanded.

Those words - "Miss Yates" - stabbed through my heart like a knife. Such a formal address, as if we'd never shared any familial bond at all.

"Miss Yates, please wrap yourself up. You're just recovering from illness; we wouldn't want you catching cold." the butler's tone was gentle as he handed me the blanket, but his kindness only made the pain sharper. I clutched the blanket tightly around myself, desperate for warmth, but finding only emptiness.

Howard's voice cut through the silence. "You must understand your situation by now. You are not a Harrington, and therefore, you no longer have any right to come to this house."

His words pierced me like icicles. I thought after a week, I'd grown numb to this truth, but tears still threatened to spill from my eyes.

"If you weren't Grant Yates's illegitimate daughter, perhaps the Harrington family wouldn't have to be so cold to you."

"But is it my fault?" My voice cracked with desperation. "Did I choose who gave birth to me? Why must I bear the consequences of something I had no control over?"

"You're not at fault," Howard replied, his voice unwavering. "But this situation has fallen upon you, so you must be the one to bear it."

At these words, I could no longer hold back my tears. So this was how cruelly unfair the world could be - I had never harmed anyone, yet I had to pay for sins that weren't mine to bear.

"What reason could we possibly have to continue accepting you? Taking you in would be an insult to the Harrington name, letting Grant Yates triumph over us. The Harrington family cannot afford such disgrace."

He paused, then delivered the final blow. "Leave now. Don't appear before us again. The further away you go, the better."

I could only nod and whisper, "Alright." What else could I do? I wasn't a Harrington anymore - I had become their shame, their stain.

"Please take care of yourself," I said, bowing deeply before Howard Harrington. I noticed his fingers twitch slightly - perhaps some remnant of affection remained for the girl he'd doted on since childhood. But none of that mattered anymore.

I carefully placed the wool blanket on the chair, terrified of making even the smallest mistake. As I left the study and walked toward the stairs, I saw her - my "stunt double." No, that wasn't right. I was the replacement, the imposter who had stolen twenty years of her life.

Maeve. Maeve Harrington now. She was the true Harrington heiress. Our eyes met across the landing. She wore a white princess dress and fluffy white slippers, every inch the cherished hothouse flower. Meanwhile, I stood there soaking wet, my shoes muddy, afraid to even step on the luxurious carpet for fear of sullying it.

"What are you doing here?"

The furious demand came from behind me. Before I could react, I felt a violent shove. I desperately grabbed the banister to keep from tumbling down the stairs.

"Eleanor Yates, how dare you show your face at the Harrington mansion again!" Clara Harrington pulled Maeve protectively to her side, disgust evident in her eyes. "Letting you recover in the hospital was the extent of my mercy. Don't test my limits!"

She wasn't finished. "Stop playing weak in front of me. Did you think you were still my daughter? That I would coddle you if you just acted pitiful enough? Let me tell you something, Eleanor - even if you dropped dead right here, I wouldn't spare you a second glance!"

My hands gripped the banister tightly - not from fear of death, but from terror that my blood might stain this expensive carpet. I started making my way downstairs in silence. I couldn't speak. The pain of being despised by someone you once loved was too overwhelming. I feared that if I said even one more word, I would completely fall apart.

A shadow appeared beside me, but I no longer had the courage to look up and see who it was.
###chapter 193
Eleanor's POV

"I'll walk you out," Jace Gillard's voice came softly beside me, as if afraid I might shatter at any louder volume.

"No need." My response was flat, emotionless. The last thing I needed right now was Jace's hollow gesture of kindness. I saw his hand reaching out to steady me, only to freeze mid-air when Clara's cold voice cut through the air, calling his name. I couldn't help but smile bitterly - just like that day at the hospital, here he was again, appearing only to retreat. He never even gave me the chance to hope.

"Jace, don't forget how you came to be part of the Harrington." Clara's reminder made the already tense atmosphere even heavier.

"Take care of yourself, Jace," I said quietly, not even bothering to look at him. "If you don't have the ability, don't try to play hero."

Each step I took toward the mansion's entrance felt like a farewell to my past, measured and suppressive. I found myself feeling an absurd sense of pride - even in these circumstances, I was maintaining my composure, walking out with dignity instead of crumbling on the spot.

The grand foyer that had once welcomed me home countless times now felt like a museum of lost memories. The massive front doors loomed ahead, no longer a gateway to comfort but an exit to exile.

The rain outside had settled into a steady drizzle, as if nature itself was providing a curtain for my exit. The iron gates that had once represented protection now stood as barriers, marking the boundary between who I was and who I had become.

Once I was sure I'd gotten far enough from the mansion - far enough that no one could see me from those warmly lit windows - my body finally gave out. My legs buckled, and I collapsed onto the wet pavement.

The rain soaked through my clothes, but I barely felt it anymore. The streetlights cast long shadows around me, their glow reflecting off the wet pavement like a spotlight on my failure.

Slowly, I felt the rain's chill fade away like the warmth of a fireplace embracing me. 

*Finally, it's over.* I closed my eyes, smiling peacefully.





Nina's POV

The social media notification lit up my phone screen. "#Serena Sinclair Faces Legal Battle While Family Celebrates" was trending. I allowed myself a small smile as I smoothed down my ivory silk dress, positioned strategically near the grand ballroom's entrance at The Plaza.

Camera flashes illuminated Grandmother Beatrice's silver hair as reporters swarmed around her. Her hands trembled. But it served my purpose beautifully.

"Serena cut ties with us when she was nineteen," Grandmother's voice wavered. "Such a disgrace to the Sinclair name. Never showed an ounce of respect for her elders or this family..."

I kept my expression carefully neutral, though inside I was savoring every word. The reporters' hungry expressions told me tomorrow's headlines would be exactly what we needed. One particularly eager journalist noticed me lurking in the shadows.

"Miss Nina Sinclair! Your sister is facing serious allegations. Any comment?"

I stepped forward, allowing the light to catch my face at the most flattering angle. "You know," I said softly, injecting just the right amount of pain into my voice, "for our elders, every child is precious. Grandmother wouldn't say such things unless she was truly heartbroken."

The camera flashes intensified. I could practically see the captions: "Devoted younger sister shows grace under pressure." If only they knew.

Inside the ballroom, the champagne tower sparkled like my future prospects. I navigated through Manhattan's elite with practiced ease, accepting sympathetic touches on my arm and murmuring appropriately diplomatic responses about "family matters" and "hoping for resolution."

"StarRiver's future?" I replied to one of the board members, maintaining eye contact while taking a delicate sip of champagne. "I believe in preserving our family legacy while embracing innovation. We must adapt to survive, don't you agree?"

I spotted Oliver in the corner, looking lost. Father had insisted he attend, but nobody was paying him any attention. As it should be. Three days from now, when Serena's verdict came down, even that small courtesy would be stripped away.

"Nina, darling." Grandmother's voice cut through my satisfaction. "For the keynote address, let's have Oliver speak."

The champagne turned bitter in my mouth. "But Grandmother, I've prepared-"

"Oliver needs the exposure," she said firmly, her social smile never wavering. "You understand, dear."

I watched my useless brother shuffle toward the podium, his shoulders squared with unearned confidence. My fingers tightened around the crystal stem until I feared it might snap. Just like I would snap each of them, once I had control.
###chapter 194
Quinn's POV

The setting sun cast long shadows across my desk as Serena and I finished reviewing tomorrow's court documents. I gathered my things, ready to head home, when her voice stopped me.

"Quinn?"

Something in her tone made me pause. We'd grown closer these past weeks, and I'd learned to read the subtle shifts in her expression. Right now, the slight furrow in her brow spoke volumes.

"What's wrong?"

"Have you... heard from Eleanor recently?"

The question caught me off guard. Eleanor had been unusually quiet. She'd promised to clear her schedule to support Serena during the trial, but I hadn't seen her in weeks.

"No, actually." I set my bag down. "Why?"

Serena's fingers fidgeted with a pen on her desk. "There's something you should know." She took a deep breath. "Eleanor... she isn't actually a Harrington."

"What?" The words didn't make sense. "That's impossible. Have you seen her and Grant? They're practically carbon copies of each other!"

"I know it's hard to believe-"

"Hard to believe? It's ridiculous!" I pulled out my phone, already scrolling to Eleanor's number. "When did you last hear from her?"

"About two weeks ago."

My finger hovered over the call button. Two weeks of silence from Eleanor was unprecedented. She was the type to send random memes at 3 AM or show up unannounced with takeout and gossip.

The phone rang. And rang. Just as I was about to give up, there was a click.

"Quinn." Her voice was barely above a whisper.

My eyes met Serena's across the desk. In that moment, we both blinked back tears.

"Where are you?" I demanded.

"That doesn't matter." She sounded tired. Defeated. "How's Serena? Is she ready for tomorrow?"

"Don't change the subject. Tell me where you are."

"I can't come back, Quinn."

"The hell you can't!" My voice cracked with emotion. "So what if you're not a Harrington? You think that changes anything? You have us - your friends. What are we, chopped liver?"

"Quinn-"

"No, you listen to me, Eleanor Yates. This isn't the end of the world. We're your family too, and we're not going anywhere. So whatever hole you've crawled into, get out of it and come home."



Eleanor's POV

"I'm fine, Quinn," I managed, my voice eerily calm even to my own ears. "Please don't worry about me."

"Don't worry? Are you kidding me? Elle, whatever's happening, we can help. Serena's already-"

"No," I cut her off, perhaps more sharply than intended. "Serena needs to focus on her case. And you... you're Spencer Sherwood's wife now. You can't get involved in this mess."

"Elle-"

"I have to go." I ended the call, turning off the phone before she could call back.

My eyes were burning with unshed tears. I hadn't thought about contacting Serena or Quinn. I couldn't bear to drag them into my mess.

Serena was already drowning in lawsuits, and her relationship with Lucas was... complicated enough. She had her own battles to fight. If she got involved with my problems, she'd have to face the Harrington family too. They loved each other deeply. But there were too many obstacles standing between them, too many things left unsaid. They had such a difficult path ahead - I couldn't let my problems distract them.

And Quinn... her situation was just as delicate. The Sherwood and Harrington families had been close for generations. Mrs. Sherwood and Clara Harrington were close, meeting three or four times every week. As a Sherwood daughter-in-law, even though the family adored and pampered Quinn, getting involved in my situation would only make things harder for her.

I couldn't bear it. My misfortune was my own to bear. I refused to let it shadow their happiness.

Now here I was, in the dingy motel on the outskirts. With my so-called mother.

After I fainted that day, I woke up here. A shabby motel room - small, messy, and dirty. Maya Coleman tried to make it more "comfortable" for me by changing the sheets. They're clean but worn so thin I can almost see through them. She took the couch in the living room area herself.

I don't refuse this arrangement.

I don't feel touched by her gesture either.

I just... exist here. Numb. Taking it all in with a detached acceptance that surprises even me. My mind feels as vacant as this room, refusing to process what's happening.

Until. Last night.

The thunderous knocking came at 3 AM, violent pounding that shattered the silence. In the past, such violent knocking would have terrified me to death. But now, I felt an eerie calm wash over me, as if I'd become numb to the world's chaos.

The brutal hammering was followed by the sound of the door being wrenched open. Then came the crashes - things being thrown and shattered. Maya Coleman's voice drifted up, pleading and desperate. "Please, lower your voice. Please. I've given you everything I have. I don't have any more money. Just leave us alone..."

"Don't you have a daughter? Pretty and gorgeous, isn't she? Go sell her! Sell her and give me the money, or I'll beat you to death!" The man's voice was guttural, dripping with menace.

"I really don't have any money left, I really..." Maya kept repeating, her voice trembling.

"I don't want to hear your excuses! Give me the money, or I'm going to sell your daughter!" Heavy footsteps approached the bedroom.

"Please, leave her out of this. I'm begging you - how much? How much do you want?" Maya's voice cracked with desperation.

"Thirty grand."

"What? Where would I get that kind of money? I couldn't earn that much for the rest of my life..."

"Then I'm taking your daughter." His words fell like lead in the darkness.

"No, you can't go in there..." 

The bedroom door exploded inward with a violent crash. Through the dim light, I could make out a middle-aged man with a crew cut, his face contorted with rage. His bulky frame filled the doorway like a nightmare made flesh.

In the weak lighting, he couldn't see me clearly enough to realize I wasn't Maeve. He lunged forward, reaching for my arm. "Come on, move!"

My body was weak from days of fever and barely eating. After collapsing at the Harrington house, I'd been burning up for days. The fever had finally broken, but I'd hardly eaten anything since, just enough to keep myself alive.

"Don't touch her! Don't you dare touch her!" Maya's scream was followed by the scraping of a chair across the floor. She swung it at the man with all her might.

He froze for a moment, stunned by her sudden rebellion. Then his hand shot out, striking Maya with such force that for one terrifying moment, I thought he'd killed her.

Maya crumpled to the floor like a broken doll, lying motionless for what felt like an eternity.

Having dealt with Maya, the man turned his attention back to me, his heavy footsteps echoing against the floorboards as he approached.
###chapter 195
Eleanor's POV

His grip on my arm was the match that ignited everything. The numbness that had been my shield these past weeks shattered, and all my suppressed emotions exploded at once.

"I'll give it to you." My voice rang out, sharp and clear in the dingy motel room. The fever made my head spin, but I forced myself to stay upright.

He laughed, an ugly sound. "Another lying bitch, just like your mother."

"I said, I'll give it to you." Each word was precise, despite the trembling in my limbs.

"Tomorrow," I continued, meeting his bloodshot eyes. "Or you can kill me right here. I'm not going anywhere with you. And if I'm dead, you'll face murder charges and still get nothing."

The silence stretched, heavy with tension. Maya whimpered from somewhere behind me, but I didn't turn. Every ounce of strength I had left was focused on maintaining this facade of control.

Finally, he released my arm. "Tomorrow. Or you'll wish I had killed you."

The door slammed behind him. My legs gave out and I crumpled to the floor, the dirty carpet rough against my palms. Maya's stream of apologies washed over me, but I couldn't respond. Didn't even look at her. The room swayed dangerously, and I focused on simply breathing.

When I woke the next morning, sunlight filtered through the threadbare curtains. The room had been tidied, erasing most evidence of last night's violence. But Maya's bruised face told the story clearly enough.

I watched her move around the small space, noting details I'd been too numb to see before. She couldn't be more than fifty, but stress and hardship had aged her prematurely. Her clothes were cheap but clean, her graying hair pulled back in a neat bun. Everything about her screamed poverty and struggle.

Maya approached cautiously with a bowl of instant oatmeal and a bagel. Usually, I waited until she left to eat the bare minimum needed to survive. But today, something shifted.

I took a spoonful while she watched. Her eyes welled up immediately, and I pretended not to notice.

I stirred the bowl, my voice carefully neutral. "Who is he?"

Maya's hands trembled slightly as she smoothed her faded apron. "My husband. Tom."

"After one night stand with Grant, I was alone with Maeve," Maya wiped her eyes, her hands trembling. "Tom seemed different. A construction worker, honest type. He didn't mind that I had a kid. When I mentioned my savings from the settlement..." She paused, taking a shaky breath. "I should've kept my mouth shut."

My stomach churned. "What happened?"

"He changed the moment he saw that money. Kept pushing me to invest in his 'business ideas.' First it was a food truck, then some crypto scheme. Lost everything, even mortgaged the house. Then..." Maya's voice cracked. "Then came the drugs. Meth. Changed him completely."

I watched her hands grip the cheap plastic tablecloth. The kitchen light made the bruises on her wrists more visible.

"When he's high, he gets violent. Takes whatever money I make cleaning houses. Last week, he showed up at Mrs. Peterson's place where I work, caused a scene. Got fired on the spot. Now I'm scrubbing toilets at the mall for minimum wage..."

"Why don't you just divorce him?" I asked, even though I already knew the answer.

"He won't let me. Threatens to kill me and Maeve if I try. We've run before - Atlantic City, Philadelphia. He always finds us. The beatings get worse each time." Maya dabbed her eyes with a paper napkin. "Called the cops twice. He did some time, but came back worse. What's six months in jail gonna do?"

"You could leave New York entirely," I suggested. "Go west maybe?"

Maya gave a bitter laugh. "With what money? I barely finished high school. Maeve's got a shot at community college..." She pulled out a crumpled handful of bills from her uniform pocket. "Here, take this. It's all I have, but you need to get out before he shows up looking for money."

I stared at the wadded twenties, my vision blurring. "I don't have anyone else. Not since you changed my life all those years ago."

Back in the tiny bedroom she'd let me use, I finally checked my phone. My Bank of America account - empty. Chase credit card - frozen. PayPal, Cash App, everything - cleared out. Clara Harrington hadn't just cut me off. She'd erased me.

Thirty grand dollars. Once, that was just a number to me. Now it felt like a noose tightening around my neck.

What hurt most wasn't the money. It was how quickly love could turn to nothing. How years of what I thought was family could vanish in an instant, leaving nothing but cold emptiness behind.

I stared at my phone's contact list, each name a lifeline I couldn't bring myself to grab. Lucas, Serena, Quinn, Drew... thirty grand would be pocket change for any of them. But I couldn't bear the thought of them seeing me like this, or worse, getting caught in the crossfire of the Harrington family's wrath.

The screen dimmed, then brightened as I scrolled past their names again. Finally, I tapped Linda's number. My last shred of professional dignity would have to go.

"Eleanor." Her usual warmth was gone. "I was about to call you."

"Linda, I need-"

"It's over, Eleanor. All of it. The endorsements are cancelled. Your upcoming projects are being reshot with AI face replacement. Everything that's already released is being pulled."

"I see." My voice sounded distant, even to myself.

"I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do."

After hanging up, I sat in silence. Then I scrolled to one last name: Garrett Thorne. I hesitated before dialing his number. My hand trembled slightly.

"Garrett?" My voice wavered as he answered.

I barely knew him, really. We'd only met briefly during the Harringtons' gatherings, exchanged some casual messages afterward. Nothing deep. Just another connection in Manhattan's intricate social web.

I chose him because I knew the Thornes wouldn't fear the Harringtons' retaliation. Clara Harrington, despite her likely displeasure, would have to tolerate any help the Thornes offered me.

"What is it?" His tone was detached, clinical.

"Could you... lend me thirty grand?" The words burned my throat. Thirty grand - what used to be pocket change for weekend shopping at Bergdorf's.

"That's not much," he replied coolly, "but I have no reason to lend it to you."

My heart sank. The warmth I'd remembered in Garrett's demeanor had vanished completely.

"My sister mentioned you're no longer a Harrington associate," he continued bluntly.

"No, I'm not." The admission felt like swallowing glass.

"I won't deny I was interested in you before. My grandfather's matchmaking attempts weren't unwelcome - I'd been focused on my career, and you seemed suitable. But everything hinges on social standing. Without your connection to the Harringtons, we're in different leagues now. For me, relationships are built on mutual benefit. Moreover," his voice hardened, "with the Harringtons targeting you, helping you would only complicate things for my sister. I thought you were considerate enough to understand that, Eleanor. This is... disappointing."
###chapter 196
Eleanor's POV

I gripped the phone tighter, silence my only response. To them, I was just being selfish, desperate.

He never even asked why I needed the money.

"Sorry to bother you," I managed finally, ending the call.

I stared at the stained ceiling of the dingy motel, so far from the penthouse I once called home. I could give up now, let whatever happens tonight happen. Death doesn't frighten me anymore.

But then Maya's face flashed through my mind. Maya Coleman - worn down by life, hands calloused from work, yet still managing to make me nutritious meals despite her poverty...

Tears rolled down my cheeks unbidden. I'd sworn I'd never forgive her, never soften toward her, never accept her as my mother.

Yet here I was, after just two weeks, worrying about what would happen to her.

I lost track of how long I cried. The tears just kept coming until Linda's message lit up my phone.

The offer she'd found me was for an adult film. Fifty thousand dollars, negotiated down because they knew I was desperate. Linda wasn't trying to insult me - she'd seen too many fallen stars to judge. She was just doing what she could to help.

My hands shook as I dialed the director's number. "Just one condition," I said, my voice steadier than I felt. "No face shots."

"That'll affect the price."

"I know."

After hanging up the phone, I got up to take a shower - fluctuating water temperature, garbage and hair on the floor, the cheapest possible toiletries. I'd gotten used to it all, just like I'd gotten used to everything else about my new reality.

Maya was waiting when I came out. "Going somewhere?"

I nodded.

She pressed some crumpled bills into my hand - maybe fifty dollars total. Everything she had. "Don't come back."

I took the money silently. I couldn't even afford a taxi anymore. But I also knew what would happen to her if I actually stayed away - the beating she'd take from Tom.

The phone's harsh blue light pierces the darkness of the stairwell, Quinn's name flashing across my screen. I let it ring once, twice, three times before my trembling finger finally swipes to answer.

"Eleanor." Quinn's voice carries that familiar mix of anger and concern. "Why are you avoiding us?"

My throat tightens. Tomorrow's Serena's court date. I should be there, standing beside her like I promised. Instead, I'm here in this dim stairwell, my back pressed against cold concrete, trying to find words that won't shatter what little composure I have left.

"I'm not avoiding anyone," I manage, but the lie tastes bitter. "I've just been... busy."

"Busy?" Quinn's tone sharpens. "That's what you're going with? We both know tomorrow-"

"I know what tomorrow is." My fingers grip the metal railing until my knuckles turn white. "I haven't forgotten."

The silence that follows feels heavy, loaded with all the things we're not saying. I close my eyes, and for a moment, I'm back in the Harrington mansion. The memory cuts deeper than any knife.

"I received your messages," I continue softly. "And Serena's. I just... I needed time."

"Time for what? To torture yourself?" Quinn's voice cracks with frustration. "We're your friends, Eleanor. Whatever you're going through-"

"You don't understand." The words burst out before I can stop them. "The Harringtons once were *my* family." My laugh comes out hollow. "And now it's gone. Not just the money or the status. Everything I thought I knew about myself... it's all collapsed."

"Then let us help you rebuild."

"No." I press my palm flat against the wall, steadying myself. "I need to do this alone."

"Since when did friendship become charity?" Quinn's anger flares. "Eleanor Yates, how dare you reduce what we have to mere *handouts*?"

The use of my full name makes me flinch. "That's not what I meant."

"Then explain it to me. Because from where I'm standing, you're just being stubborn and proud."

"Yes, I'm proud!" The words echo in the empty stairwell. "I'm proud, and it's all I have left. Don't you see? You and Serena... you're my last lifeline. If I come to you now, like this..." My voice catches. "If I lean on you and still can't find my way back..."

"I'm still here," I finally whisper. "I'm surviving. When I can't anymore, when life strips away every last shred of dignity and hope... then I'll come to you. But please, let me try this my way first."

I hear Quinn draw in a sharp breath, preparing for another argument. But something in my voice must reach her because when she speaks again, her tone has softened.

"Promise me one thing," she says. "Promise you won't let it get that far before you reach out."

My thumb hovers over the end call button. "Goodbye, Quinn. Tell Serena..." I swallow hard. "Tell her I'm sorry."

I end the call before she can respond, letting my phone slip into my pocket as I slide down the wall to sit on the cold steps.



Serena's POV

Quinn's trembling fingers dial Eleanor's number again, but this time, we're met with the automated message indicating her phone is switched off. The blue light from the screen illuminates Quinn's face, highlighting the tears gathering in her eyes. My heart aches at the sight.

"She's never had to struggle like this before," Quinn whispers, her voice breaking. "How is she supposed to manage on her own? She's always had everything handed to her..."

I watch as Quinn's fingers grip her phone tighter, her knuckles turning white.

"I understand why she's doing this," I say softly, thinking back to my own days of struggle. "It's not just about facing things alone or proving something to herself. She's trying to protect us."

Quinn's head snaps up, her eyes flashing with a mixture of anger and disbelief. "Protect us? She's out there somewhere, probably barely getting by, and she's worried about *us*?"

"Yes." I lean back against the wall, choosing my words carefully. "Eleanor knows our connections to the Harringtons. She's afraid that helping her might bring their retaliation down on us. That's just who she is - thinking of others even when she's at her lowest."

A bitter laugh escapes Quinn's throat. "That idiot! I don't care if I have to burn every bridge with the Sherwoods. How could she think we'd abandon her?"

I understand Quinn's frustration, but I also see something else - something familiar in Eleanor's choice. "We should respect her decision," I say, surprising even myself with the certainty in my voice.

"Serena-"

"I know what it's like," I interrupt gently. "Being cast out by the family you trusted, having everything stripped away." The memories of my own past with the Sinclairs surface, but they don't sting like they used to. "Sometimes, hitting rock bottom is what forces you to rebuild yourself."

Quinn's shoulders slump. "But she doesn't have to do it alone."

"No, she doesn't. But she needs to believe that she can." I reach out and squeeze Quinn's hand. "Eleanor isn't as fragile as we think. This might be exactly what she needs to discover her own strength."

After a moment of silence, Quinn nods slowly. "You'll keep an eye on her though, right? Just... just in case?"

"Of course." I manage a small smile. "We'll give her the space she needs, but we won't let her fall too far."
###chapter 197
Eleanor's POV

The lights blazed through the windows, a stark contrast to the darkness I felt inside. I only turned my phone back on when I reached the studio, immediately calling the director to let him know I had arrived.

The director's excitement was barely contained when he saw me. His blue eyes gleamed with an enthusiasm that made my stomach turn. "Eleanor, go change first. Just wrap yourself in a robe, that's all you need. Don't worry, I'll clear everyone out except for two camera operators and myself."

Noticing my red, swollen eyes, he added in what he probably thought was a comforting tone, "First time jitters are normal. Just follow my direction. With your figure, you could make men swoon just by existing. Relax."

"Okay," I responded mechanically.

My tears weren't about what I was about to do. They were about the phone call with Quinn moments ago. Her genuine concern had nearly broken my resolve. I had almost confessed everything. 

A female assistant led me to the changing room, her judgment evident in every glance she cast my way. I stood there, wrapped in the plush white robe, unable to take that final step through the door. 

I knew many stars did questionable things before making it big. Compromising oneself was practically an open secret in the entertainment industry. Even some A-listers still played these games at the behest of powerful producers.

But I bit my lip, wondering if I was the only one who was still... innocent... about to do something like this. The irony felt like a slap in the face.

Finally, I forced myself to open the door. I clutched the robe tightly around myself, only my calves exposed. A futile gesture of modesty, considering what was about to happen.

Under the harsh studio lights stood a bed, looking deceptively soft and inviting. The director instructed me to lie down and remove the robe.

I was trembling. My entire body shook uncontrollably.

On the director's third patient prompt, just as I was about to let the robe slip...

"ELEANOR YATES! DON'T YOU DARE!"

A furious shout suddenly echoed through the studio, making everyone, including me, jump. My heart skipped a beat as my fingers instinctively clutched the bathrobe wrapped around me.

I looked over to see Drew standing there, his face red with rage. I felt my blood freeze. I'd never seen him this angry before. Those eyes that usually carried a casual, carefree look now held something that genuinely frightened me.

I was stunned. Running into someone I knew in a place like this was the last thing I'd expected. Shame washed over me like a tidal wave, threatening to drown me completely.

Drew kicked over the camera in front of him, his fury reaching its peak. I could feel the anger radiating from him, the pressure making it hard to breathe.

The next second, he wrapped his arms around me, fiercely securing my robe, as if terrified it might fall off in front of all these people. His movements were urgent yet careful; I could feel his arms trembling. The protective gesture sent a wave of bitterness through me - I'd already decided to face everything alone.

The director, intimidated by Drew's presence, stammered, "Who... who are you?! This is a closed set, I can call the police for trespassing!"

The sketchy producer, intimidated by Drew's presence, stammered, "Who... who are you?! Get out of here before things get ugly!"

Drew thundered back, "You're the ones who should be worried! Running an illegal operation, no permits, no safety protocols - I should call the FBI right now!" His voice reverberated through the basement like thunder, and I could feel the other guys shrinking back.

The producer's face went pale. My heart was still racing, shame and gratitude wrestling in my chest.
Drew turned to me, his voice suddenly gentle, "Where are your clothes?" The stark contrast in his tone made my heart ache.
"In the back room," I answered softly, as if afraid to disturb the tense air around us.
"Go put them on," he ordered, his eyes brooking no argument.
"Drew..." I tried to explain but didn't know where to start. How could I tell him I'd run out of options?
"If it's about money, how much are these criminals offering? Fifty grand? I'll give you fifty right now!" Drew was practically exploding with anger. Looking at him, so furious his hair seemed to stand on end, I thought about how he'd be even more upset if he knew I was desperate enough to consider their measly thirty grand offer. A indescribable sadness welled up inside me.
But given the situation, I knew I couldn't stay. Deep down, maybe I was even relieved - relieved that he'd found me, relieved that someone had stopped me from making this dangerous mistake.
"Just give me a minute," I told him calmly, though emotions churned beneath the surface.
Drew hesitated for a long time before letting go of me, then followed me to the back room, afraid I might be trapped or threatened. His concern both touched and pained me - we weren't even that close.
After I changed, Drew wordlessly led me out of the basement, his hand holding mine firmly. His hand was warm, but it made my heart grow cold as I thought about the risks I'd nearly taken.
In his Mercedes, he didn't start the engine, seemingly still processing his anger. The silence in the car was almost crushing.
"How did you find this place?" I asked, my voice barely hiding a tremor.
He grew even angrier, "If I hadn't, you could've been hurt! Do you know what happens in these illegal operations? No safety, no protection, no legal recourse if things go wrong!"
"Sarah, if I hadn't been having dinner with some club owners tonight and overheard them talking about this underground operation and a new girl... I thought I'd heard wrong! I called your brother and found out what's going on! Damn it, Sarah, I know times are tough, but risking your safety like this?" His scolding was filled with concern, making me feel even worse.
I knew he wasn't judging me, just terrified that I'd put myself in danger for money. But his concern made me feel helpless, like I was back to being that little girl who needed protection.
"You've never been desperate," I shot back. "How would you know how I feel?" My voice was defiant but couldn't hide the bitterness.
"I...!" Drew was lost for words. Looking at his struggle to respond, my emotions were a tangled mess.
"Even though you interrupted my chance to make money tonight, I know you meant well, so I won't hold it against you. Just pretend you don't know me from now on. I'm getting out..." I tried to make my voice sound light, but my throat felt tight.
"How much do you need?" he suddenly asked. Those words hit me like a hammer to the heart.
I turned to look at him, unable to believe what I'd heard.
"I can get you fifty grand right now. Is that enough? If not, I can arrange more," he said directly, with a seriousness I'd never seen in him before.
"Not necessary," I refused. "I'll figure something out myself." As I spoke, I felt something twist in my chest.
"It's all business anyway, isn't it? Why not do business with someone you know? Isn't that better?" he said coldly.
###chapter 198
Eleanor's POV
I froze, staring straight at him. A storm of emotions churned inside me as the implications of his words shook me to my core. We'd always had this playful, casual friendship, and now...
"What's your account number? I'm transferring the money right now," Drew insisted, his voice firm. There was an intensity in his eyes I'd never seen before, making me want to look away.
"Drew, you don't have to go this far for me. I know you're loyal to your friends, but I'm in trouble with the Harringtons now. Getting involved with me means making enemies with one of the most powerful families in Manhattan. I don't want you to-" My words were cut off by a sudden warmth against my lips.
I stared at him wide-eyed, my brain still trying to process my unfinished sentence while my body froze at this unexpected intimacy. My heart hammered in my chest, threatening to break through some invisible barrier.
He had kissed me, silencing my protests. His presence overwhelmed my senses-the faint scent of his cologne mixing with traces of cigarettes, his signature scent that I'd grown so familiar with. This close, I could feel the slight tremor in his breath.
My mind went completely blank. All thoughts suspended, leaving only the warmth of his presence slowly breaking down my defenses. Memories flashed through my mind in fragments-Drew getting into a fight defending me outside that bar in downtown, his goofy smile during our late-night drinking sessions at Murphy's, that moment he offered me a cigarette when I was at my lowest point after losing my role.
We'd known each other for years, and I'd always seen him as a brother, a best friend. Now, with his lips suddenly on mine... I couldn't describe the feeling. Shock, confusion, panic, and something else-a flutter I couldn't quite name. All these emotions tangled together in my heart like a knot I couldn't untangle. That clear line we'd always had between us suddenly blurred into something undefined and intimate.

Jace's POV

I stood under the streetlight, watching two silhouettes in the car. An invisible hand seemed to clutch my heart, making it hard to breathe.

Their heads were close together. I wished I was blind. Yet every detail was etched into my vision with cruel clarity.

I couldn't see their expressions, but somehow, I understood everything perfectly. My mind desperately tried to deny what I was seeing, but reason cruelly insisted this was reality.

I turned away silently. A bitter taste rose in my throat, as if I'd swallowed the entire winter's chill.

I walked away quietly. Each step felt like walking on broken glass, and not just because of my injuries.

Walking was difficult. Whether from the beating or the weight crushing my heart, I couldn't tell.

I always lose her. I'd repeated these words countless times in my mind, but they'd never cut so deep before. From childhood, there had always been an invisible barrier between us, and now that chasm was finally, painfully visible.

I slumped down in an alley, out of their sight. I wanted to cry, but the tears seemed frozen, refusing to fall.

The wounds covering my body didn't hurt at all. How could the Harrington family's punishment compare to this heartache? Those bruises almost felt like redemption, proof that I'd at least tried to do something for her.

A shadow fell over me. I almost thought it was a hallucination. I looked up at Lucas Harrington. His presence was both unexpected and inevitable.

"Let's go," Lucas said. Two simple words that carried volumes of unspoken understanding. 

*Obviously, he'd also seen Eleanor with Drew together.*

I just got a call from Serena - Eleanor is thinking about doing adult films to make some money. I completely lost my mind. I'd gone crazy, trying to burst out of the mansion, only to be stopped by the butler. I was like a caged animal, not caring what dangers lay ahead.

"Jace, if you go out, you're no longer part of the Harrington family!" Father's threat still echoed in my ears.

"You already know my choice," I'd said, my face contorted but my heart surprisingly calm.

Father had threatened me in many ways, but I remained unmoved. His words fell flat, like punches thrown at cotton. Finally, we'd reached an agreement - if after three months I still insisted on leaving the Harringtons for Eleanor, he wouldn't stop me.

I'd agreed, as a final show of respect to him. Though I knew those three months would be tough, I was willing to wait. But I never imagined Eleanor would...

"Jace, when Dad took you in, it was out of pure kindness. Now you're turning against the Harringtons for some bastard? How dare you bite the hand that feeds you?" Clara's voice trembled with rage.

My throat tightened at her words. The familiar shame of being the charity case, the outsider, threatened to overwhelm me.

I let out a bitter laugh. "Funny you should mention that. Wasn't I just another bastard child myself?"

The words tasted like poison on my tongue, but God, it felt good to finally say them.

"Enough!" Howard's fist crashed onto the mahogany dining table. I noticed Milo and Stella flinch at the sound, their small bodies frozen in their chairs. 

"Watch your mouth, Jace," Howard's voice carried a clear threat. The same tone he'd used countless times before, when I'd stepped out of line.

Clara pressed on and was about to go for the kill. "Jace, don't you understand? Dad can take away everything he's given you just as easily as he gave it. Do you want to end up like Eleanor Yates?"

Eleanor's name hit me like a physical blow. Memories of her tears, her broken dreams, the way the Harringtons had systematically destroyed her.

"I'm willing to share Eleanor's fate," I replied without hesitation.

I watched as Clara's face turned an unhealthy shade of red, her blouse rising and falling with her rapid breathing.

"So be it." Father's voice was arctic. The same tone he'd used when he'd cast Eleanor out. "Paul."

"Yes, Mr. Harrington." The butler's response was formal, but I caught the slight tremor in his voice. Paul had been here longer than I had, had seen more family secrets buried than anyone.

"Have security escort him out. And make a public announcement - from this day forward, Jace Gillard has no connection to the Harrington family."

I caught Paul's hesitation, saw the apology in his eyes. But under father's steel gaze, he could only respond, "Right away, sir."

The security team's "escort" left me battered and bloody, but I didn't make a sound. Each blow felt like penance. Once they were done, I immediately got to my feet, tasting copper in my mouth. Lucas followed me out. I heard Clara trying to stop him, but father held her back.
###chapter 199
Eleanor's POV

Drew and I sat awkwardly in his car. Usually, we're both the life of the party, but that unexpected kiss turned us from social butterflies into awkward teenagers. The silence was deafening, and neither of us dared to break it. We just sat there, stiff as boards, not knowing what to do with ourselves.

I noticed Drew trying to say something several times, but the words never came out. I kept biting my lip, unsure how to handle this situation. My mind was racing. *How did we go from being bros to... whatever this is?*

Finally, Drew took a deep breath and broke the silence. "So, uh, let me get your account details first."

"My accounts..." I shifted uncomfortably, "Mrs. Harrington had them all frozen."

"Cash then?" he suggested.

I hesitated, not sure whether to accept or decline.

"I need thirty grand," I finally said.

"Just thirty?" He looked concerned, like it wasn't enough.

"Thirty's fine," I assured him.

"I'll hit the bank tomorrow when they open, get some more cash out," he quickly added.

"Really, you don't have to..."

"I'm a very generous sugar daddy," he declared with mock authority. But with his boyish features, casual suits, and that perpetual friendly expression, he looked about as intimidating as a golden retriever puppy.

I couldn't help but laugh. "Thanks, sugar daddy. But seriously, I know you mean well. I don't know when I'll be able to pay you back, but as soon as I can..."

"Eleanor, do you think I'm joking?" His expression suddenly turned serious.

*What else could this be?* Who catches feelings for their drinking buddy? Sure, our lips had connected, but that kiss was as chaste as a middle school dance.

"I'm dead serious," he said, clearly frustrated.

"Could you really hook up with your wingman?" I tried to keep it light.

"You might see me as your wingman, but I never saw you that way!"

I froze.

"Look, I've had a crush on you since forever. I only played the friend card because you weren't interested. Remember when you kissed Jace at that party? I actually had flowers and everything ready to ask you out that night. Then I saw you two making out by the Harrington's front gate."

My eyes widened. I had no idea Drew had feelings for me, or that he'd witnessed that moment.

"I buried my feelings and stayed your friend because I didn't want to make things weird. God, Eleanor, watching you heartbroken over Jace killed me. I wanted to tell you how I felt so many times, but I was scared of losing you completely. Do you have any idea what these years have been like?"

"Living it up at The Plaza, surrounded by socialites?" I quipped.

"I... that was just to get over you!" he defended weakly. "Besides, I might've partied at all the clubs, but I never crossed any lines. I have standards, you know."

"I didn't say anything," I smiled. Being with Drew had always been easy, natural. A moment ago, I'd been at rock bottom, feeling so trapped that even dark thoughts had crept in. But somehow, his words made everything feel a little lighter.

Maybe life wasn't as dire as it seemed.

"So... will you be my girlfriend?" he asked nervously, looking like an anxious prom date.

"Well, I did take your money," I teased.

Watching his face light up with joy, his already boyish features transforming into pure happiness, I felt an unexpected warmth spread through my chest.

Checking my phone, I suddenly jumped. "I need to get going," I said, gathering my things.

Drew's face fell. "Already?" he said, trying and failing to hide his disappointment.

"How about moving in together?" I said matter-of-factly. "I can move in tomorrow. Just need to handle something tonight." In film industry, I learn to cut through the BS pretty quick.

Drew nearly spat out his water. Watching his face turn red, I had to admit - maybe the tabloids were wrong about him being Manhattan's most eligible playboy. His deer-in-headlights expression seemed too genuine to fake.

"That's... wow, that's kind of sudden..." he stammered, fidgeting with his glass.

I almost smiled. *For someone who's supposedly a sugar daddy, he's acting like a teenager.* "Just drop me home then," I said instead.

The real reason for my hurry was Tom - he'd be back tonight. That thought alone made my stomach turn.

"Of course," Drew said, already reaching for his keys.

When his car pulled up to the run-down motel, I watched his expression shift from confusion to horror. "This is where you've been staying?" He couldn't keep the shock from his voice.

"Yeah," I said simply.

"Jesus, Eleanor... I'm sorry for being a jerk earlier. If I had to..." he trailed off, shaking his head. "I wouldn't last two days here."

I gave him a slight smile. That was Drew's best quality - his honesty.

Opening the door, I said, "I've got it from here. Drive safe."

"At least let me walk you up. This neighborhood's sketchy after dark."

"I'm good. Go home, Drew."

"Text me when you're inside," he insisted.

"Will do."

Clutching my purse with the stack of cash inside, I walked into the dimly lit building. It's amazing what you can get used to when you have no choice. Before I reached the room, I heard the crash of breaking glass. In this building, domestic violence was as common as sirens - everyone pretended not to hear.

I burst through the door to find him holding a broken chair leg over Maya.

"Back off!" I shouted.

He spun around, surprise flickering across his face before twisting into an ugly smirk. "Well, look who decided to come home! Was just teaching your mama what happens when you try to hide my meal ticket!"

Seeing Maya on the floor, her waitress uniform torn and bloody, something snapped inside me.

"Why did you come back? Get out of here, Elle!" Maya struggled to her feet, trying to push me toward the door despite her injuries. Her desperation broke my heart.

"Ain't nobody going nowhere!" he slurred, waving the chair leg. "Not till she starts earning her keep down at Joey's club!"

"Please, go," Maya begged, still trying to shield me with her body, ready to die protecting me.

Looking at her, I felt tears burning in my eyes, but beneath them was something stronger - rage.

###chapter 200
Eleanor's POV

I watched in horror as he threw Maya against the peeling wallpaper of the motel. The thud made my stomach lurch as she crumpled to the floor, her uniform still on from her shift. "Get out of here, baby," she gasped, her voice barely a whisper.

My hands shook as I faced him, his eyes wild with the desperate look. His fingers dug into my arm through my blazer. "You're coming with me to see my guy in Joey's club. Bitch like you can cover what I owe."

"Let go, I have the cash-" Before I could finish, a familiar voice cut through the stale air of the hallway.

"Take your hands off her!" Drew's voice boomed down the corridor.

My heart jumped - I thought he'd left after dropping me off. Looking back, I saw him standing there, his face pure fury.

Tom sneered, still gripping my arm. "Back off, trust fund boy-"

The crack of Drew's leather shoe connecting with Tom's stomach cut him off mid-sentence. As Tom stumbled backward, Drew pulled me behind him. He give me a reassuring look.

Next second, Drew's fist connected with Tom's jaw, sending him sprawling. Years of meth had left Tom a shell of the man. Now he just curled up on the stained carpet, whimpering, "Jesus Christ, stop, please..."

Part of me wanted Drew to continue, to make him pay for Maya. But reality hit hard - assault charges, Helm Media headlines about the Yeager heir in a street fight. "Stop," I caught Drew's wrist. "That's enough."

Drew stepped back, his chest heaving. Tom took several minutes to pull himself up using the wall for support.

I threw the envelope at him. "Here's your thirty grand. Come near us again, and I'm not calling the NYPD - I'm calling the DEA."

Maya's voice cracked from where she still sat by the radiator. "Where did you get that kind of money? Eleanor, don't - you need that for yourself..."

Tom clutched the envelope, thumbing through the bills with shaking hands. He limped toward the stairwell, muttering about staying uptown from now on.

When his footsteps faded, Drew turned to me, his voice tight. "You got that money for him? What's his deal?"

I told him everything. "Christ," Drew ran a hand through his perfectly styled hair. "Should've hit him harder."

"And trade your penthouse for jail?" I shot back, though my voice softened seeing the genuine worry in his eyes.

"He'll be back," Drew's jaw clenched. "Guys like that always come back when they need a fix. Next time..." He trailed off, and I saw real fear flash across his face.

"I'm handling this," he declared. "Tomorrow, we're getting you both out of here. I've got a place in Tribeca-"

"Drew." I studied his face, watching him shift uncomfortably.

"Not to live together," he quickly added. "For you and Maya. This neighborhood... Just pack tonight. I'll look at some options in my portfolio."

"Nothing flashy," I said quietly. "We need to stay under the radar."

His serious expression cracked into a smile. "Got it." He pulled out his iPhone, already texting his property manager as he headed for the stairs.

I looked back at Maya, still huddled by the rusty radiator. "Need to hit the ER?"

"Just bruises," she quickly refused, smoothing her crumpled uniform.

I didn't push. The truth was, I couldn't fully bridge the gap between us.

"Eleanor, that young man..." she ventured cautiously.

"A friend," I cut her off, not ready to explain. "Let's pack before Tom changes his mind about staying uptown."





Serena's POV

Eight AM sharp when Quinn and I pull up to the courthouse. Today's the hearing that will decide everything.

The case has been blowing up on X and Instagram for the past three days. This morning, I made the mistake of checking - half of the trending topics on X are about me. Our Town Car stops at the courthouse steps, and I can see the media circus already in full swing. Quinn glances at me, his PR training evident in his measured tone. "Want me to run interference?"

"I've got this," I say, straightening my blazer.

Quinn just nods. The moment we step out, it's like sharks smelling blood in the water. The press corps surges forward, CNN and Fox News microphones thrust in my face. Quinn tries to create a buffer, but they've got us surrounded.

"Miss Sinclair, your thoughts on today's proceedings?"
"Legal experts are predicting potential federal charges. Care to comment?"
"Your career at StarRiver - any regrets about how things played out?"
"You were notably absent from the StarRiver Foundation Gala. Sources say Lawrence Sinclair has officially written you out of the family trust. Can you confirm?"
"How are you handling the family's public denouncement?"

I channel my composure, projecting my voice with the authority. "The judicial process will take its course. I have full faith in the American justice system, and I'll respect whatever verdict is reached."

When they push for more, I cut it clean: "As for the Sinclair family's decisions, they're entitled to manage their affairs as they see fit. I accept that."

The press pack starts shifting - Nina's Mercedes has pulled up. She's wearing smart professional outfit, playing to the cameras. I watch as they swarm her instead: "Miss Sinclair, your father's statement was pretty clear about Serena's status. Why show up today?"

"Helm Media says you're here for the schadenfreude. Care to comment?"

Nina brings out her practiced Ivy League sympathy: "Family is family, no matter what. Despite everything that's happened with the company and the board, she's still my sister. I'm just hoping for the best possible outcome today."

Then Lucas's Bentley arrives with Rachel Thorne, and the media pivots hard. I catch snippets about their merger announcement and Thorne Enterprises' new Manhattan headquarters before stepping into the courthouse.

Inside, the scene is set: Lucas and Rachel in their power suits up front, Jace beside Lucas, while Spencer from Sherwood Group and Drew sit across the aisle. Everyone who from the Manhattan elite is here to watch the show.

###chapter 201
Serena's POV

From my seat in the defendant's chair at the New York County Supreme Court, I watched Judge Morrison bring down his gavel. My fingertips traced the edge of my blazer.

Assistant District Attorney Leach cleared his throat and stood. "Your Honor, on November 3rd, the Manhattan DA's office received credible information through our whistleblower hotline regarding tax fraud and corruption at StarRiver Group. The evidence indicates that Serena Sinclair, as CEO, orchestrated a scheme involving $4 million in bribes to IRS officials and tax evasion exceeding $30 million. The whistleblower has provided substantial documentation, including surveillance photos of meetings between Ms. Sinclair and IRS officials, along with falsified tax returns."

I kept my expression neutral, though my stomach churned. The SEC investigations I'd handled before were nothing compared to being a defendant in a criminal case.

"The prosecution calls Thomas Peterson to the stand," Leach announced. My breath caught slightly. I studied him as he walked forward: mid-forties, wearing a suit that had seen better days, the classic look of a mid-level federal employee.

Peterson began his testimony: "As a Senior Examiner with IRS, I became aware of irregular patterns in StarRiver's filings. During routine surveillance, I observed multiple meetings between Ms. Sinclair and Commissioner Brad at Bernard&Pike, which raised red flags given their timing around tax filing deadlines. Upon reviewing Star River Group's tax returns, I uncovered serious discrepancies in their financial statements. Not wanting to raise any suspicions, I investigated Brad's finances. My investigation revealed that an account opened in his wife's name contained $4 million in unexplained deposits."

The real gut punch came when Brad, the deputy IRS Commissioner, took the stand. I watched in disbelief as he folded immediately under questioning, confirming every detail about our "business dinners" and the subsequent favorable tax treatments. Jessa, my CFO, followed with equally damaging testimony about wire transfers and the accounting she claimed I had authorized.

Throughout it all, Quinn appeared absorbed in her notes, her lack of objections causing concerned glances from my executive team in the gallery. But when Judge Morrison called for the defense's response, Quinn stood with the confidence.

"Your Honor," she said, removing her frames, "the defense moves to enter a plea of not guilty."

Despite the mountain of evidence the U.S. Attorney's office had assembled, her certainty was unwavering. My hand finally stilled its nervous movement as I straightened in my chair, drawing strength from her composure.

 

Quinn's POV

The weight of every gaze in the courtroom bears down on me. The gallery of Manhattan's elite legal circles aren't even trying to hide their skepticism. Nina Sinclair even let out an almost theatrical laugh. A ripple of murmurs spreads through the courtroom.

Judge Morrison's gavel comes down hard. "Order! I will have order in this court." The chamber falls silent.

"Defense counsel, you may proceed," she says, adjusting her glasses.

I give a slight professional nod. "Thank you, Your Honor." Standing straighter in my suit, I continued. "After reviewing the prosecution's evidence and witness testimony, the defense has several material concerns to address."

"Firstly, while Mr. Peterson's position at the IRS qualifies him to identify potential discrepancies in StarRiver Group's tax filings, his alleged access to Commissioner Brad's personal accounts raises serious procedural and credibility issues."

"Secondly, Ms. Penrose's testimony about my client's alleged wire transfers to Commissioner Brad is undermined by the suspicious failure of Chase's security cameras during the account opening - a $4 million transaction that would typically trigger multiple compliance protocols."

"Third, regarding StarRiver Group's financial statements, the prosecution relies heavily on DocuSign records that were routinely handled by administrative staff, and physical signatures that any first-year forensic analyst would question."

I conclude with measured confidence, "These points form the basis of our motion for acquittal." The silence in the courtroom feels heavy with anticipation.

Thomas fumbled to explain. "I had access to the Commissioner's account because he asked me to make a deposit at the Midtown branch. That's when I noticed the suspicious transaction history."

I allow a carefully measured pause. "The prosecution would have us believe that a veteran IRS Commissioner, allegedly accepting substantial bribes, would carelessly hand over his account information to a irrelevant examiner?"

A few muffled chuckles from the gallery are quickly silenced by Judge Morrison's sharp look.

I continue, my voice steady. "For someone who's served twenty years in the IRS to make such a fundamental oversight stretches credibility beyond reason."

Leach Anderson rises, straightening his tie. "Objection, Your Honor. Counsel is engaging in speculation and attempting to impugn the witness's credibility without foundation."

"Sustained," Judge Morrison replies. "Keep to the facts, counselor."

I nod deferentially. "Yes, Your Honor." Then: "Permission to question my client?"

With approval granted, I turn to Serena. "Ms. Sinclair, regarding Mr. Peterson's allegations of tax fraud and bribery, what is your response?"

"Not guilty," she states.

She continued. "I can provide concrete evidence that I was in a Board meeting at the StarRiver during the alleged bank visit."

The gallery buzzes with whispers - senior partners turning to their associates, financial reporters scribbling furiously in their notepads.

###chapter 202
Quinn's POV

I watched Nina Sinclair's expression shift to barely concealed anxiety. Rachel Thorne kept her composure, but I noticed her unconsciously fiddling with her bracelet.

Rising from the prosecution table, I addressed the bench: "Your Honor, I move to present evidence proving my client's whereabouts during the alleged bank transaction."

Judge Morrison nodded. "Proceed, counselor."

I handed the USB drive to the court clerk and waited as the footage appeared on the courtroom's LCD screens. "The account in question was activated at First Manhattan Bank's Midtown branch at 10 AM on October 15th. During this exact time frame, my client was chairing a board meeting at StarRiver Group. This security footage, accelerated for time, shows her continuous presence there."

The courtroom fell silent as the footage played. This evidence would dismantle their theory about Serena's involvement.

After the playback concluded, I turned back to Judge Morrison. "Your Honor, this evidence strongly suggests a deliberate attempt to frame my client."

As expected, Leach jumped up. "Objection, Your Honor. The defendant's physical absence from the bank doesn't preclude involvement. Given the prosecution's allegations about Officer Brad's bribes, arranging a proxy bank visit would be trivial. This footage proves nothing about the account's ownership."

I'd anticipated this line of attack. "Your Honor, I request permission to cross-examine Ms. Jessa Penrose."

With the court's permission, I approached the witness stand. "Ms. Miller, you testified that my client directed you to file fraudulent tax returns and bribe Officer Brad?"

"That's correct," she replied, adjusting her blazer.

"What compensation did she offer for these federal crimes?"

"She... she was my boss at StarRiver. I had to do what she said to keep my position," Jessa responded, her accent becoming more pronounced under stress.

Seizing the opening, I pressed further: "So there was no direct compensation?"

"No."

I motioned to the clerk to display the next exhibit on the screens. "These are statements from your Chase Manhattan account. Could you explain the series of deposits from numbered accounts over the past six weeks?"

I watched her composure crack as her eyes darted over the transaction records displayed on the monitor.

"The withdrawals are particularly interesting," I continued. "Multiple wire transfers to the Bellagio in Las Vegas. According to these records, you've lost over $200,000 at their high-stakes tables. Would you care to explain?"

"That's... that's private. It has no bearing on this case. I invoke my Fifth Amendment rights," Jessa stammered, her hands gripping the witness stand.

I projected my voice for the jury: "It's absolutely relevant! Your gambling debts made you vulnerable to coercion. Someone promised to clear your markers with the casino if you helped frame my client!"

As Jessa's denials echoed through the courtroom, I pivoted back to Judge Morrison: "Your Honor, the prosecution calls Mr. Miller."

When the silver-haired man in a suit took the stand, Jessa's face went ashen.

I approached the witness stand, keeping my movements deliberate and controlled. "Mr. Miller," I said, using the measured tone, "this is a court of law. Just tell us exactly what happened, alright?"

"Yes, ma'am." He adjusted his tie.

I started with the basics, my heels clicking softly against the floor as I moved. "Please state your full name for the record."

"Edward James Miller."

"And what do you do for a living, Mr. Miller?"

"I'm a fine art reproduction specialist," he said, his voice nervous. "Based out of the Eastport."

"Could you elaborate on the type of work you do?"

"I reproduce museum-quality copies of classical paintings," he paused, then added, "Sometimes I also do signature and handwriting reproductions for historical documents and private collections."

I noticed Leach shifting in his expensive suit - he knew what was coming. "Would you be willing to demonstrate your expertise for the court today?"

"Objection, Your Honor!" Leach was on his feet before Miller could answer. "This is theatrical and wastes the court's time." 

I met Judge Morrison's eye. "Your Honor, this demonstration is vital to establishing the witness's credentials and expertise."

The judge adjusted her glasses. "Overruled, but keep it brief, Ms. Ashford."

I nodded to the court officer, who brought forward a legal pad and a pen. "Ms. Sinclair, would you please sign your name?"

After Serena finished, I handed the materials to Miller, watching Jessa Penrose from my peripheral vision. Her suit couldn't hide her growing discomfort.

The gallery fell silent as Miller worked. When he finished, several jury members leaned forward in their seats - the signatures were indistinguishable. 

"The court has witnessed Mr. Miller's expertise," I said, my voice carrying to the back of the courtroom.

Leach stood again, his face reddening above his striped tie. "Objection! This could be rehearsed testimony from a paid witness."

I turned, letting just a hint of steel enter my voice. "Mr. Anderson, the DA's office exists to pursue justice, not protect corporate interests at any cost." I saw him flinch slightly. "As for rehearsal - let's find out."

"Mr. Miller," I continued, "do you recognize anyone in this courtroom?"

"Yes." He pointed directly at Jessa Penrose, who was now gripping her blazer like a lifeline. "That woman there."

"How did you first connect with Ms. Penrose?"

"She reached out on Telegram. Said she had a consulting opportunity."

"What kind of opportunity?"

"She wanted me to reproduce Ms. Sinclair's signature on several StarRiver Group documents."

"When exactly was this?"

"Four weeks ago."

"Do you have evidence of these communications?"

"Everything's still in my iPhone messages and emails."

###chapter 203
Quinn's POV

I connected his phone to the courtroom's AV system. As the evidence appeared - detailed iMessage exchanges, DocuSign timestamps, Venmo payments - the gallery erupted in whispers. Judge Morrison tapped her gavel once, restoring order.

"The evidence is unambiguous, Your Honor," I stated, gesturing to the exhibit displayed on the courtroom's LCD screens. "The electronic signature verification logs show that Ms. Penrose bypassed StarRiver Group's standard SOX compliance protocols. She knew that getting a paper approval would let her circumvent the dual-authentication requirements in the digital system."

I caught Jessa nervously adjusting her blazer. Her nails drummed against the witness stand as she stammered, "That's not-I didn't-"

"Perhaps you'd like to explain the series of Telegram messages between you and Mr. Miller?" I continued, my voice steady. "Or the wire transfers to your account that coincidentally align with each falsified document?"

Jessa's silence spoke volumes. Turning to Judge Morrison, I adjusted my tie. "Your Honor, through digital forensics and witness testimony, we've demonstrated that my client was the target of a sophisticated corporate conspiracy. The defense rests."

I returned to the counsel table. When Judge Morrison asked if the government had any redirect, Leach Anderson's hesitation was palpable.

I rose again, unable to resist pressing our advantage. "Your Honor, given the evidence of potential securities fraud and wire fraud that has emerged during these proceedings, I believe the U.S. Attorney's office has an obligation to investigate who orchestrated this scheme. The integrity of our financial markets demands nothing less."

I watched Leach's face flush. Being outmaneuvered by a younger attorney clearly wasn't in his playbook. He weakly suggested referring the matter to the FBI's white-collar crime division for further investigation.

But I couldn't let them drag this out with another fishing expedition. "Your Honor, the government has failed to meet its burden of proof. We move for an immediate verdict under Rule 29."

After a recess that I ate a salad, we reassembled for the verdict. When Judge Morrison declared, "This court finds insufficient evidence to support the charges of securities fraud and tax evasion against Serena Sinclair. The defendant is hereby released," I heard muffled cheers from our side of the gallery.

Through the crowd, I caught Nina's face twisting with rage as she whispered furiously to side. Rachel Thorne managed a tight smile, highly aware of Lucas Harrington watching from the front row, but couldn't quite hide her displeasure.


Spencer's POV

I stood outside the courthouse, watching Drew fidget with his watch. "Your wife really brought her A-game today. Never paid much attention before, just knew you two were on the rocks. But after that performance in there? The AmLaw Daily's gonna be all over this. Better shape up, Mr. Can't-Keep-It-Professional-With-The-Associates, or you might find yourself traded in for an upgrade!"

I shot him with disdain. Not worth the oxygen to respond.

"Hey, don't shoot the messenger," Drew shrugged, adjusting his tie.

Our little circle headed toward the courthouse steps, where I spotted Serena and Quinn surrounded by everyone from Bloomberg to the Wall Street Journal.

"Anyone up for Symphony of Spice? My usual table's open," I offered.

"Board meeting at four," Lucas cut in immediately, checking his phone.

I turned to Jace, raising an eyebrow.

"Rain check," Jace replied, but his voice sounded off and his pale as the marble columns behind us.

"Come on, Drew. Don't tell me you're bailing too?" I pressed. We were usually the reliable pair at any Midtown happy hour.

"Count me out," Drew shot back without missing a beat. "And while you're at it, scratch me off the guest list for those weekend trips. The girlfriend's not into that scene, and I've got a standing appointment with my trainer at Equinox."

"Since when are you whipped by a girlfriend? Who's the mystery woman?" I couldn't help but laugh. "Let me do some due diligence. Manhattan's full of gold diggers hunting for that next Series A funding, if you know what I mean. Though hey, if it's a mutually beneficial arrangement, no judgment. Just don't want to see you get played like some fresh-off-the-boat startup kid!"

"Save your due diligence for your hedge fund," Drew snapped. "She's perfect."

"Look at you, acting like some lovesick summer associate..." I trailed off, noticing Jace practically speed-walking toward his waiting Town Car.

Lucas gave us one last look before heading out, Rachel falling into step beside him like the perfect corporate wife.

I frowned at Drew. "Did Jace seem off to you? Guy was walking like he just lost a Supreme Court case."

Drew's poker face stayed firmly in place. "I've got a lunch at Le Bernardin. And seriously? Worry about your own situation. With the way the legal press is circling your wife after today, you might find yourself getting served papers at your next Knicks game!"

He turned and strode toward his waiting Porsche.

I stood there on the courthouse steps, watching them all scatter. My eyes drifted to where Quinn held court with the reporters, and I couldn't help a cold smirk.

Media darling? Still the same as before.


Serena's POV

Finally free from the press conference, Quinn and I made our way back to the company . She slid into the driver's seat and started the engine. Even on Park Avenue's relatively straight stretch, I noticed how tentatively she was handling the car.

"Not used to city driving?" I asked, keeping my voice casual.

Quinn gave a self-deprecating laugh. "Born and raised in Manhattan, if you can believe it. Just never quite got comfortable with the traffic. Usually take the subway or Uber everywhere."

"No shame in that," I smiled, then added, "Though given your position at the firm, you might want to consider getting a car service."

I watched her grip tighten on the leather steering wheel as a yellow cab cut sharply in front of us. Her attention seemed to drift, despite the bumper-to-bumper traffic around us.

"Quinn, taxi!" I called out sharply.

She jerked back to attention, slamming the brakes. Thank god for seatbelts - I would've had an intimate meeting with the dashboard otherwise. A symphony of the finest horn-blaring erupted behind us.

"Let me take over," I offered.

She didn't argue, and we switched places at the next corner.

"God, I'm so sorry," Quinn muttered, clearly mortified. "This is why I stick to the 4 train."

"Really, don't worry about it. But seriously, you really need to hire a driver."

"Yeah, you're right."

"I'll drop you off at your place first, then have Vincent send someone for me," I said, not willing to risk her trying to navigate rush hour traffic alone.

"Thanks," she replied quietly.

I shifted the conversation: "About the lawsuit - any chance of further developments?"

Quinn visibly relaxed as we moved to legal territory. "Nothing that would stick. Our investigation couldn't find any paper trail linking Nina or Rachel Thorne to the situation. Any follow-up will probably just be some lower-level employee taking the fall."

I nodded, smoothly merging into the left lane. But internally, my blood was starting to simmer. Did Nina really think she could keep playing this game? She'd only grown more brazen, and now this alliance with Rachel...

I could feel my expression hardening behind my sunglasses. Some people really were determined to write their own downfall story.

###chapter 204
Nina's POV

I stormed out of the Court, my rage burning through every nerve in my body. Watching Serena walk free in there made me want to scream. How does my dear stepsister always manage to land on her feet? Pure luck, that's all it is. Everything Serena has ever gotten was handed to her on a silver platter.

Backing to my carBackigBackingto, my phone lit up with Rachel Thorne's name. My anger gave way to instant anxiety. This whole mess was my fault and Serena's lawyers had torn our case apart.

Gripping my phone, I wondered if the Sinclair shares I'd just acquired were about to be yanked back. Taking a deep breath, I answered: "Rachel."

"Forest & Flame. Now." The line went dead.

I could feel her fury through the phone. But when I arrived at the exclusive spot, Rachel was the picture of old money elegance, delicately stirring her wine.

"Rachel," I started quickly, "This was completely my fault. I never thought Jessa would mess up it so badly after fifteen years as StarRiver CFO..."

"Water under the bridge," Rachel cut me off with practiced smoothness. "I don't waste time dwelling on past failures."

I stood there awkwardly, my bag clutched like a shield.

"Moving forward is what matters in this business," she continued, her nails tapping against the goblet.

"So why did you call me here..." I ventured carefully.

"This represents thirty-one percent of Sinclair Group," Rachel said, sliding a leather portfolio across the table.

I froze, my stomach dropping. After I'd botched everything, she was offering more shares?

"This makes you the majority shareholder of Sinclair," she stated, her voice crisp.

I stayed silent, trying to read the angle. Rachel Thorne didn't give anything away without a reason.

"Take it," she pushed the portfolio closer.

My hand hovered over the documents. Finally, I had to ask: "The deal was these shares if we won the case. But we lost. I don't understand..."

"Sinclair means nothing to me. It's a small fish in my pond. You want it so badly? It's yours." Her tone was carefully measured.

I wasn't some naive debutante fresh out of university. "What's the catch?" I asked directly.

A slight smile curved her lips. "While your oversight cost us in court, Nina, you're not completely useless. I'm still willing to work with you. Take the shares. When I need something, you'll hear from me."

"And if that something's illegal?" I challenged.

"More illegal than what we've already done?" she replied archly.

I clenched my jaw, knowing full well that taking these shares meant being her puppet indefinitely. But ambition has always been my weakness. With these shares, I would control Sinclair. All those people - Grandma, Mom. They always favored Oliver, my useless brother who couldn't tell a merger from an acquisition. Why should he inherit everything just because he's Daddy's only son? The thought made my blood boil.

I took the portfolio.

"Serena proved... more resourceful than expected," Rachel mused. "And I clearly underestimated Lucas Harrington's involvement."

"Serena is... tenacious," I agreed carefully.

"I'll be in touch when I have a plan," she dismissed me with a wave of her hand.



Serena's POV

After seeing Quinn off, I returned to my apartment.

To be honest, I hadn't been completely comfortable with Eleanor living with me before. Even in a place this size, having a roommate took some getting used to. But now that she was gone, the silence felt overwhelming.

I missed Eleanor. I found myself wondering if she was settling into her new place okay.

Picking up my phone, I hesitated before hitting her contact. I knew she'd been worried about me through this whole legal mess.

When the call connected, my heart suddenly raced. "Serena." Eleanor's voice came through.

I snapped back to reality. "Eleanor, we won. The court ruled in our favor."

"Just saw it on the WSJ. Way to go, girl." Eleanor's tone was warm, but different.

I could feel she wasn't the same carefree Eleanor. Something had shifted - she sounded more grounded, more mature. It hurt to hear that change.

"How are you holding-" I started.

"I'm good, really good," she jumped in, with forced brightness. "You know what they say - everything happens for a reason. When life gives you lemons... well, maybe there's a better cocktail waiting around the corner."

"Are you seeing Jace?" I asked directly. I had my reasons for asking. First, there was something in her tone when she mentioned "better cocktails" - a warmth that felt genuine. Something - or someone - was making her genuinely hopeful.

Plus, Lucas had mentioned Jace would check in on her. If they could just be honest with each other instead of playing these games...

"What makes you think that?" Eleanor deflected, her voice taking on that overly theatrical tone.

I frowned.

"Me and Jace? Please," Eleanor continued. "He can barely manage his hedge fund, let alone a relationship. Jace and I..." She paused. "Look, I'll admit it - I was pathetic. All these years, turning down elites, pretending I was too focused on my career... meanwhile hoping Jace would get tired of those fashion week models and realize what he was missing. God, I sound like a bad rom-com."

I gripped my phone tighter, debating whether to tell her what I knew.

"I didn't want to admit I still had feelings for him," Eleanor continued. "I wasn't just lying to you - I was lying to myself. Acting like I was living my best life, like seeing him with someone new at every Gala didn't kill me. Truth is, all those late nights, I was just trying to numb it."

"Eleanor, actually-" I tried to break in.

"But it's different now. I've moved on," she cut me off. "I've met someone."

"What?" I nearly knocked over my candle.

"Trust me, I'm as shocked as you are. Who knew getting over someone could happen so fast?" Eleanor laughed. "That night I finally told Jace how I felt, everything seemed perfect. Next day, he's making out with some girl at our house's gate. Now I realize I was reading too much into it. Sometimes things just... change."

"You're not just saying this?" I didn't want to doubt her, but this seemed sudden.

"I wasn't going to tell you yet. Seemed too quick - didn't want to look like some desperate socialite jumping from one guy to the next," Eleanor said sheepishly. "But I didn't want you worrying about me either. So... it's Drew."

I actually did knock over the candle this time. Eleanor and Drew? Sure, they ran in the same circles, but they seemed about as compatible as The Plaza and McDonald's.

"I know, right?" Eleanor continued. "I always saw him as just another trust fund kid. Then he tells me he's had feelings for me for years. Drew always surrounded by models - had been carrying a torch for me this whole time. I had no idea. It... it got to me."

"Being touched by a gesture isn't the same as love..." I felt compelled to point out.

"I knew you'd say that - you always were the pragmatic one. But sometimes that's exactly how it happens. Not everyone can have your classic 'meet-cute' at a wine tasting. Sometimes it builds slowly. And what makes you fall for someone if not when they surprise you, show you who they really are? I never thought I'd feel this way about Drew, but now... I can't imagine not giving this a chance."

I could hear real happiness in her voice. This was completely different from her conversation with Quinn last night. Something had shifted.

So that was it? After years of Jace and Eleanor's "will-they-won't-they" drama, it was really over?

Thinking of Jace... I held back, ultimately deciding not to reveal everything. Some feelings, once put to rest, should stay buried in the past.

"You and Quinn can stop walking on eggshells around me. I'm good. And if I ever really need you, you'll know - I'll be the one showing up at your door with a bottle of Veuve," Eleanor declared.

"Deal," I agreed.

"Gotta run - I'm taking a cooking class."

"What?" That was unexpected.

"While I figure out my next move, might as well learn some life skills. Can't survive on Sweetgreen forever," Eleanor said with surprising sincerity.

I could tell she was genuinely trying to move forward. If Drew could bring light back into Eleanor's world, who was I to question it?

"Then I won't keep you from your culinary education," I said, smiling.

"Once I master more than avocado toast, you and Quinn are coming over for dinner."

"Promise?"

"Cross my heart."
###chapter 205
Serena's POV

I finally got some decent sleep today. Ever since the lawsuit began and Eleanor's accident, peaceful rest had been a luxury I couldn't afford.

As I stretched and yawned, debating between DoorDash and Uber Eats, a thought crossed my mind - if Eleanor was taking cooking classes, maybe I should make an effort too. With Milo and Stella visiting so often, I couldn't keep relying on Joe's Shanghai and Dig Inn.

After some internal debate, I changed into my joggers and decided to head to Whole Foods. But when I opened my door, I found Lucas standing there with the kids. I surprised - it wasn't even the weekend. Why would he bring them unannounced?

"I have to fly to London tomorrow," Lucas explained, adjusting his tie. "They'll need to stay for a week. Walter's visiting family during that time too."

I remembered suddenly that Lucas had been abroad when I had my accident, flying back on his private jet immediately after. The memory stirred something inside me, but I pushed it aside with a simple, "Sure, no problem."

"Going somewhere, Mommy?" Milo asked, clutching his Switch.

"Can we come too?" Stella perked up, her prep school uniform still pristine despite the long day.

"Yes... heading to Whole Foods," I said. "Thought I'd try cooking dinner."

"You're actually going to cook?" Both children looked shocked.

I caught Lucas's subtle smirk.

"You're really going to cook for us yourself?" Stella's eyes widened. "We usually just have Walter order from Caviar or heat up something from Dean & DeLuca."

Their eager expressions melted my hesitation. I took their hands in mine and turned to Lucas. "Go ahead to your meeting. We'll be fine."

Lucas didn't respond, just silently followed behind us. At Whole Foods, the usually composed Stella became completely childlike, darting between aisles with Milo, picking up organic ingredients for my inspection.

"Can we get the wild-caught salmon?"

"Look, they have those special Japanese mushrooms!"

Watching them explore the store with such enthusiasm, a warmth spread through my chest. We filled our cart with seafood from the sustainable section, organic produce, and some prime cuts. Before checkout, I told Lucas, "Watch them for a minute. Need to grab something from the pharmacy section."

When I returned with Tampax, I caught Stella's curious glance. I couldn't help but smile - someday, I might be the one helping her navigate these aspects of growing up.

Lucas and Milo were already at the checkout line when I walked up with my items. Lucas glanced at me and casually extended his hand. "Add it to my cart. I'm getting everything."

I hesitated, holding the Tampax boxes. The line behind us was growing longer and Lucas's expression had that familiar CEO impatience. Reluctantly, I handed them over, then became intensely interested in the latest issue of Vogue on the magazine rack.

"Sir, these products are part of our Prime member special," the cashier announced with practiced cheerfulness. "Buy two, get one free. We have Regular, Super, and Super Plus available."

"We'll skip the promotion," Lucas replied in indifference.

"It's actually included with your purchase," the cashier continued, unfazed. "Target and CVS are running the same deal. You might as well take advantage of the savings. Just need to know which variety you prefer."

He hesitated for a while, then turned to me. "Which ones do you want?"

The cashier's attention swung to me, and I felt my face burning. Behind us, I could hear a couple in workout gear having their own conversation.

"See?" the woman stage-whispered. "the suit guy is not only good-looking but also so considerate. He even asks girls what they like. Unlike you, who always just buys whatever you like without caring if I'm comfortable or not..."

"You said the Amazon subscription was fine!" her boyfriend protested.

"Whatever." Her eye roll was practically audible.

"Fine, fine. You can pick whatever you like later, okay?" he backpedaled.

"Ma'am?" The cashier's voice broke through my mortification. "Your husband's waiting on your preference. It's refreshing to see a guy this involved - most men just wait outside with their AirPods in."

I caught Lucas's satisfied smirk. I realized we were like a warm family, which made me feel even more uncomfortable. It felt like I was the mistress. Dying inside, I grabbed a random box. "These are fine."

After paying, we headed toward the parking garage where his car was waiting. I rarely did my own shopping and we'd somehow ended up with enough bags to fill a supermarket. Watching Lucas carrying two massive Whole Foods bags, I stepped in front of him. "I can take those. I'm sure you have meetings waiting."

"Really?" His skepticism was justified.

I frowned. How heavy could grocery bags be?

The answer was: very. The moment he handed them over, they crashed to the sidewalk. They'd looked so effortless when he was carrying them...

"Still feeling independent, Serena?" he asked, smugness in full force.

I pressed my lips together. This is what I got for deviating from my usual delivery apps.

Then he took the bags from my hands with an indulgent smile and walked towards his car. His natural gesture dissolved the previous awkwardness, and a warm feeling welled up inside me. A thought crossed my mind. How wonderful it would have been if the later events had never happened...

I followed with the twins, all of us heading back home in comfortable silence.

After finishing the unpacking, I headed to the kitchen to start dinner. I had barely begun checking the stuff when Lucas appeared again.

"I can handle this..." I started.

"It's almost 8, and both Milo and Stella haven't had dinner yet," he cut in.

I checked my watch, surprised at how late it had gotten.

"Let me cook - it'll be faster," he offered. "You can watch and learn. You'll pick it up more quickly that way."

I took a deep breath and acquiesced. In the corner of my eye, I caught Stella silently sliding onto one of the kitchen island's barstools, watching us with that slight, knowing smile.

In the kitchen, I assisted as Lucas cooked, absorbing his explanations about timing the pasta perfectly with the sauce. Our movements fell into an easy rhythm, while Stella helped set the table with the plates.

Soon, we had a proper dinner ready: pasta primavera, garlic bread, and a caesar salad. Lucas took his seat at the table as naturally as if he'd always belonged there.

"Mommy, this is amazing!" Milo exclaimed enthusiastically.

Before I could respond, Lucas jumped in. "Then finish your plate. Don't waste good food."

"I'm having seconds!" Milo declared.

Stella twirled her pasta. "It's really wonderful, Mommy," she said softly. Looking at these precious twins, warmth spread through my chest.

After dinner, when Lucas offered to help clean up, I declined. I wanted to avoid interacting with him as much as possible. As I loaded the dishwasher in kitchen, I heard Milo's voice carry over the marble island: "Mommy, this is exactly what I wanted for us."

"What do you mean, sweetie?" I asked, arranging the plates carefully.

"You know-having dinner together, going to Whole Foods on weekends," Milo explained, while Stella sat perched on one of the kitchen stools, swinging her legs slightly.

I was so moved that I couldn't speak.

"Don't you enjoy it too, Mom?" Milo looked up at me with those earnest eyes.

"Of course I do," I managed, though the words felt strange on my tongue.

"You're the best!" Milo beamed.
###chapter 206
Serena's POV

When I finished in the kitchen and walked into the living room, glancing at the clock on the mantel, I said, "It's getting late, Lucas. The kids have lacrosse practice tomorrow morning."

"Of course," he agreed easily, standing up from the sofa.

I walked Lucas to the door. The silence between us felt heavy with unspoken words, but there were things I needed to say.

"Thank you," I said, breaking the silence. Seeing his eyebrow raise slightly, I continued, "For everything with the lawsuit. Quinn was incredible, especially finding that evidence about the forged signatures."

"It was because of me that you were involved. You don't need to thank me," he replied softly.

I let it drop. Truth be told, I wished he would just go through with his engagement to Rachel Thorne and end whatever this was between us. But after everything he'd done to protect me from the corporate scandal, I didn't feel right making demands.

Desperate to break the tension, I switched topics. "Have you heard about Eleanor and Drew? They're officially dating now."

"I heard," he said simply.

Of course he had.

"Eleanor seems really happy," I continued. "I'm not going to analyze whether they're better as friends or more, but she's genuinely happy. So... I hope you'll let them be. Don't tell her about everything Jace did for her back in the day, and please make sure Jace stays away too."

"You don't need to worry about that," he said firmly. "Jace may be my uncle, but I protect all my friends equally. If Drew genuinely cares for Eleanor and she's chosen him, that's their business. I'll support them. So will Jace."

Catching my skepticism, he added, "Jace saw them together at car that night. He walked away immediately. If he had any intention of interfering, he wouldn't have left. That's not who he is."

I nodded, knowing he was right. I remembered the night Jace had found me barely conscious outside that Wall bar and taken me to hospital. Even knowing about my history with Lucas, when we had no connection at all, he could have called me an Uber and walked away. Instead, he'd stayed until he knew I was safe.

"Love isn't something you can control with a business strategy," Lucas said quietly, reading my expression. "That's why I won't give up. The moment you let go is the moment everything slips away."

With that, he turned and walked toward the elevator.

I watched him go, understanding exactly what he meant.

Taking a deep breath, I leaned against my doorframe. I had to admit - his unwavering determination made something flutter in my chest. But I wasn't ready to acknowledge what that meant.


Nina's POV

Monday morning at the Sinclair Group's executive board meeting.

I made sure to arrive early and took my place at the head of the boardroom table - the CEO's seat. I caught the sideways glances from the other board members and executives. They were probably shocked - Nina Sinclair had always played by the rules, maintaining the proper corporate etiquette. Even when Dad couldn't make it and asked me to run meetings, I'd always taken one of the executive seats.

Just before the meeting was set to begin, Dad walked in with Oliver. I watched his face harden the moment he saw me in his chair. The irony wasn't lost on me - despite his obvious favoritism, he still held those traditional views about male succession. Seeing his perfect daughter so blatantly breaking protocol clearly struck a nerve.

Oliver came charging in behind Dad. The second he saw me in the CEO's chair, he lost it. "Have you completely lost it, Nina? That's Dad's seat! Get up - you're making us look like a joke in front of the board!"

I gave him my once-over and didn't bother responding. That really set him off - he was used to playing the prince, Sinclair's golden boy. No one dared dismiss him like this.

Just as he started toward me, I pulled out the Sinclair share certificates and addressed the room. "As of market close Friday, I control 41% of Sinclair Group's voting shares, making me the majority shareholder. Under Delaware corporate law and our company bylaws, the majority shareholder assumes the position of CEO. Effective immediately, I am taking over as Chief Executive Officer of Sinclair Group."

The boardroom erupted in whispers and shocked looks. I savored the expressions on Dad and Oliver's faces.

I handed the certificates to my executive assistant. "Please distribute copies to my father, brother, and the board members for review."

"Right away, Ms. Sinclair," she responded, maintaining perfect professional composure.

Watching them scrutinize the legal documents, I allowed myself a small smirk. I'd planned to keep this ace up my sleeve until they really pushed me, but the temptation to pull the trigger was too strong. The view from the CEO's chair was everything I'd imagined.

"If there are no questions about the documentation, Dad and Oliver can take their seats," I gestured to the executive chairs, keeping my tone carefully casual.

Dad, who'd ruled Sinclair's boardroom from his perch for decades, couldn't handle the public humiliation. Though he managed to maintain enough composure to avoid a scene in front of the board, he stormed out, his shoes echoing down the hallway. Oliver, still playing the dutiful son, chased after him.

I straightened my blazer, completely unfazed. "Let's proceed with our regular quarterly review."

After the meeting, I barely had time to settle into my office before Oliver burst in, practically taking the door off its hinges. I glanced up, deliberately showing how little he concerned me.

"What's your angle here? How did you pull this off behind our backs? Where'd you get the capital? Which firms helped you?" His face was turning the same shade as his tie. "You're actually trying to steal Dad's company? You're just as bad as Serena!"

I let out a cold laugh. "Oliver, look at yourself. You're nothing but a spoiled Ivy League dropout who's never closed a real deal in his life. If Sinclair ended up in your hands, we'd be filing ###chapter 11 within a year."

"Shut up!" He lunged forward, but my assistant was faster, restraining him before he could reach my desk.
###chapter 207
Nina's POV

As he struggled against him, shouting, "Get your hands off me! Do you know who my father is? You'll all be looking for jobs by tomorrow!"

I picked up my phone, ready to call security. "Look at you - acting like some entitled brat throwing a tantrum. One more outburst like this, and I'll have you escorted out of the building permanently."

"You wouldn't dare!"

"Watch me. Get him out of my office," I ordered.

Dad chose that moment to walk in. "Let him go."

Out of what little respect I still had for him, I nodded to the assistant. Oliver immediately tried to charge me again, but Dad grabbed his sleeve, snapping, "Enough! You're making us look like amateurs!"

I smirked, watching Oliver instantly back down - the self-proclaimed prince of Sinclair, still terrified of daddy.

Dad switched to his negotiation voice. "Nina, we can structure a deal here. Return the shares, maintain the family harmony. We'll forget this morning ever happened."

I could barely hold back my laughter. "Dad, I finally understand why Serena hates our family so much. We truly are despicable, aren't we?"

Lawrence's face darkened with anger.

"I really don't know how you have the audacity to demand I give up my shares, and then magnanimously offer to 'let bygones be bygones.' Do you think I need your forgiveness? I didn't fight my way to the CEO position to keep playing your games!" 

I let out a bitter laugh. "Don't blame me for showing my true colors now. You pushed me to this point. Oliver is completely incompetent, yet you protect him at every turn. I've done so much for this family, but you never even saw me. Did you really expect me to work under Oliver forever? Who do you think you are - royalty?"

"Nina, that's enough! I'm still your father, and I-"

"Save it. The way you treated Serena showed me exactly how much 'family' means to you. You only care about your own interests. The moment anyone threatens them, you turn ruthless. You did it to Serena, and you'd do the same to me. I should thank Serena, really - she showed me the Sinclairs' true nature. That's what helped me climb to the top!"

"You only have one percent more shares than me," Lawrence snarled. "I can acquire more shares anytime. Do you really think you can stay on top for long?"

"Let me break it down for you," I smirked. "Serena owns ten percent, and the other board members have nine. Serena will never give you a single share - thanks to Grandmother publicly declaring we'd never ask for Serena's help. You sealed your own fate there. As for the other nine percent - if they were available, don't you think I would have bought them already?"

"You-!" Lawrence's veins bulged with rage.

He never imagined his trusted daughter would outmaneuver him like this.

"You brought this on yourself," I said coldly. "If you had shown even a shred of decency... Dad, if there's nothing else, take your precious son and leave. I have work to do."

"Nina, are you sure you want to go this far?" Lawrence tried threatening me one last time.

I didn't even bother acknowledging his empty threats.

As he turned to leave, I remembered something. "Oh, and Dad? Since you're no longer CEO, I'll have your office cleared out. I'll be moving in there. Feel free to pick any other office you'd like."

Lawrence's face turned ashen with fury as he stormed out, Oliver scurrying after him like a lost puppy.




Beatrice's POV

This morning's journal headline about Nina taking control of Sinclair Group has become the talk of Manhattan's social circles. Who would have thought that Nina, who always played the perfect debutante, would outmaneuver my son? My blood practically boiling.

The most-shared post suggests that "regardless of the circumstances, the Sinclair women are proving to be exceptional leaders," praising both Nina and Serena. How can I stomach this humiliation when my son has lost his position at Sinclair Group and become the laughingstock?

I can feel my blood pressure spiking. "After everything I've done for Nina, sending her to the ivy, getting her into all the right social circles - she turns out to be nothing but a snake! The way she's been manipulating the board behind our backs... I could just..."

I turn to Angela, my voice sharp. "This is your daughter's doing. What happened to all those etiquette classes and finishing school values you supposedly instilled in her?"

Angela puts on her victim face. "Mother, I had no idea Nina would turn out like this. You know how sweet she's always been..."

Her act only infuriates me more. "Oh, spare me the crocodile tears - I've had enough. Is this where Nina learned it from? Playing the innocent socialite while plotting like a corporate raider beneath?"

Angela continues her defense. "That's not true! Everything I've done has been for this family's legacy. I gave up my career to focus on raising the next generation of Sinclairs. Have you forgotten all that?"

I'm about to continue when Lawrence suddenly barks. "For God's sake, enough! As if the board meeting wasn't stressful enough! You two sound like a reality TV show - this isn't 'Real Housewives of Manhattan'!"

After an uncomfortable silence, I carefully ask. "Lawrence, darling, what's our strategy here? We can't let Nina turn this into her own millennial takeover story."

I press further. "Nina only has one percent more voting shares. Can't we have our people at Morgan Smith arrange a buyout?"

Lawrence's face darkens. "The other board members hold nine percent. I've had talked them. No matter what figure I float, they won't sell. These are legacy shares, held since the company's IPO. They don't need the cash - it's about tradition."

Suddenly, I remember. "Didn't you give Serena ten percent of the shares?"

This sets Lawrence off completely. He shouts. "Don't even start on that! If you hadn't caused that scene with Serena in front of the entire social scene, would I have had to give up ten percent to keep her from pressing charges?!"

I try to explain, but he continues. "And then you had to go and trash her to the media, announcing that the Sinclairs would never need her help? At your age, you still don't understand how we works!"

My face flushes. "How dare you! Lawrence Sinclair, I'm your mother - what would your father say if he could see you now?"

"If you weren't my mother, you'd be out of this house faster than last season's Prada! After all these years of letting you enjoy the family's position..."

I'm so angry my eyes are red with tears. I've never been treated like this before. My own son, whom I raised with my own hands, actually dares to speak to me this way today.

As Lawrence kicks over the crystal glass on the coffee table and storms out, my grandson Oliver adds. "Grandmother, Dad's right. You're being impossible."

I'm shaking with rage. Even my beloved grandson treats me this way. "The entitlement of this generation!"

Angela was still pretending to be caring as she comforted me before saying, "Actually, Mother, there might be a way to handle the Serena situation."

I looked at Angela intently. "What do you mean?"

"Serena is still part of the Sinclair family after all. Her ten percent shareholding is essentially useless to her-wouldn't it be better as cash?" Angela suggested. "We just need to give her a graceful exit. You publicly denounced her and cut her ties with the Sinclair family in front of the media. If you could just retract that statement, tell the media it was said in the heat of the moment, and show her some kindness, she might be willing to sell her shares back to us."

"Angela, are you trying to drive me to my grave?" My anger peaked. "Do you expect me, Beatrice Sinclair, to take back my own words? That would be utterly humiliating!"

"But we're out of options now. You've seen how determined Nina is. None of us can convince her otherwise. As her mother, even I want to teach her a lesson, but I'm powerless. The only solution is for you to swallow your pride and ask Serena." Angela continued.

"I won't do it. I would rather die than beg Serena!" The mere thought of such a demeaning act made my blood boil.

"Then we'll have no choice but to watch Sinclair Group fall completely into Nina's hands." Angela sighed with feigned resignation.

She started to stand up to leave.

"Wait." I gritted my teeth, knowing full well that I bore the greatest responsibility for this mess. "I'll call Serena."

"She won't answer your calls. If you're truly sincere about this, I suggest you meet her in person. It would show more genuine intent," Angela advised.

###chapter 208
Serena's POV

I'm in the middle of a crucial board meeting. We're reassessing our strategy after complications with the latest RFP process. All three shortlisted companies have pulled out, forcing us to either restart the bidding or consider bringing development in-house. The meeting's running long as the board debates ROI projections for each option.

As I exit the boardroom, Vincent catches me in the hallway, keeping his voice low. "Ms. Sinclair, your grandmother's in your office. Mrs. Beatrice Sinclair."

I feel my jaw tighten slightly.

Vincent explains, "She showed up during the quarterly review and... well, she was making quite a scene in reception. Given the situation with the reporters downstairs, I thought it best to-"

"You made the right call," I cut him off with a slight nod. I understand Vincent's overcautious approach these days. After that mess with the lawsuit, he's been dotting every 'i' and crossing every 't'.

When I walk into my office, Beatrice's scowl instantly morphs into her forced smile. "Serena, darling! These board meetings of yours... I had no idea you were so hands-on with operations these days..." She rises from my guest chair, bag in hand.

I bypass the gesture smoothly, moving behind my desk to maintain distance. I know exactly why she's here. Nina's lightning-fast acquisition of Sinclair Corp wasn't exactly subtle - clearly Rachel Thorne's return on investment for backing her hostile takeover.

"Serena." Beatrice settles back into her chair, unfazed by the rebuff. "I've been doing some soul-searching. What happened at the Foundation gala... I was completely wrong about you. Seeing how Nina's handled... I was totally blindsided by her act. I've come to apologize, dear. Your grandmother made a terrible mistake at the reading of the will. Can we move past this?"

I let out a soft laugh and offer a boardroom-neutral "Sure."

The silence stretches until Beatrice finally shows her hand. "Serena." I kept my eyes fixed on the screen when she spoke again, not acknowledging her. "I have another request," Beatrice finally revealed her true purpose for coming.

I gave a cold smile, not bothering to look at her.

"You know StarRiver is under Nina's control now - she only has one percent more shares than your father. With your ten percent stake, if you'd just give two percent to your father, Nina wouldn't be able to act so superior anymore." Beatrice's tone shifted to a wheedling sweetness as she mentioned Nina, clearly still bitter. "Don't worry, I won't let you lose out. I'll pay double the market price to buy those shares."

"No." I turned to face her directly, responding without a moment's hesitation. "I won't sell at any price."

"Serena, dear, those shares are useless to you now. Who knows what state Sinclair is in under Nina's management? And you're so busy at StarRiver now, when would you even have time to concern yourself with Sinclair's affairs..."

"Whether I have time or not is my business. These shares are all I have left from my mother. Even if Sinclair goes bankrupt, I won't sell." I cut her off coldly. "And as for Nina's capabilities - frankly, she's probably more competent than Lawrence."

"Serena Sinclair!" Beatrice finally lost her composure, shouting in anger.

I remained unmoved, too accustomed to such outbursts to even change my expression.

"I'd warned you," she threatened.

"Whatever." I dismissed her with contempt.

"You think I won't go straight to the press? Tell them how disrespectful you are, how you abused me? I can ruin your reputation!"

"Mrs. Sinclair." I couldn't even be bothered to call her Grandmother anymore. She truly didn't deserve it.

"Have you forgotten what you told the press? That I had nothing to do with the Sinclair family anymore? That the family would never come asking for my help? That I should be grateful if I didn't try to claim any Sinclair assets?" I replied with biting sarcasm. "Don't worry, I'm doing exactly what you said."

"You-!" Beatrice was clearly frustrated by her inability to manipulate me.

"I'm busy." I had no interest in continuing this pointless conversation. "Vincent."

"Yes?" Vincent Chadwick immediately entered the office.

"Show them out," I instructed coolly. "And from now on, don't let any unauthorized people in. If they cause trouble, call the police."

"Yes, sir." Vincent moved to escort Beatrice and Angela out. "This way, please."

Beatrice shot me a venomous look, spitting out one last threat: "Serena Sinclair, the tables will turn someday. You'll see what I'm capable of!"

"That statement applies more to your current situation," I replied evenly.

Beatrice left with a dark expression on her face.

###chapter 209
Angela Sinclair's POV

I watched with calculated satisfaction as my mother-in-law stormed out of the StarRiver. The media ambush I'd orchestrated was already in position - hungry journalists. Family drama among the top one percent still sells.

The reporters descended like sharks who'd scented blood. "Mrs. Beatrice Sinclair, what brings you to StarRiver today?"

"Is this about the rumored board coup at Sinclair Group?"

"Are you trying to broker peace with Serena after publicly disowning her ?"

I watched my mother-in-law's maintained composure crack. Leaning close, I whispered, "Think of what we have talked." Right on cue, she swooned. I caught her, making sure I was positioned perfectly for the photographs.

The reporters backed off. I seized my moment.

"Yes," I admitted. "After everything that happened at the shareholders' meeting, Mother Sinclair hoped to extend an olive branch. But Serena..." I paused, letting my voice catch. "The way she treated her grandmother, right here in the lobby of her own company. Pushing past her, mocking her ..." I dabbed at my eyes with a handkerchief. "We all know the pressure of running a company is intense, but family should still mean something, even on business."

My performance was perfect. Allegations that Serena Sinclair had verbally and physically abused Beatrice, went viral across social media. But by afternoon, everything had unraveled. Security footage from StarRiver's lobby hit social media, making Beatrice look like exactly what she was - a bitter society matron trying to manipulate the press.

The confrontation at home was explosive. Her slap caught me across the face, years of tennis keeping her arm strong. "You bitch!" she hissed. "I took you in from your middle-class life, and this is how you repay me? By making me look like a fool in front of the public?"

My cheek burned red from the slap.

Rage bubbled beneath my surface. For years, I'd endured Beatrice Sinclair's abuse - her slaps, her verbal attacks. I'm a human being, not some dog she can kick around.

I lifted my head and, in one swift motion, my hand struck across her face with a sharp crack.

Beatrice stood there, stunned. "Angela, you must have a death wish. How dare you-"

Before she could finish, I deliberately fell to the ground, making sure to hit the edge of the coffee table hard enough to look convincing but not enough to truly hurt myself.

Lawrence burst in, his voice thundering through the penthouse. "Mother, enough! Can't this family have one day without drama?!"

Beatrice immediately turned to him, playing the victim. "Lawrence, this woman had the audacity to strike me-"

"Where exactly did she hit you?" Lawrence's tone toward Beatrice held none of its former warmth.

"She just-"

"Mother was just upset," I cut in, pushing myself up from the floor with deliberately shaky movements, tears gathering in my eyes. "I tried to stop her from confronting Serena, but she wouldn't listen. She was convinced Serena would take her side. Now with all this media coverage, she can't handle the backlash..."

"Angela, you lying snake! You're the one who encouraged me to-"

"Enough!" Lawrence roared, clearly having reached his limit with Beatrice. "All you do is embarrass this family! Why couldn't it have been you who died back then instead of my father? Your presence here is nothing but a constant headache!"

"You... you!" Beatrice sputtered, clearly shocked by Lawrence's outburst.

"Aiden!" Lawrence barked. "Confine her to her suite. She's not to leave without my permission."

"You wouldn't dare!" Beatrice's face contorted with fury.

Lawrence didn't even spare her a glance as he stormed out.

"Lawrence Sinclair, treating me like this will bring divine retribution!" Beatrice shrieked as the butler practically dragged her toward the elevator to the upper floor suite. Her protests echoed through the house, but not a single staff member moved to help her.

I watched her being hauled away, savoring every moment of her humiliation. Nina had taken control of Sinclair Group, which stung - those shares should have gone to Oliver. But seeing Beatrice finally get what she deserved almost made it worth it. Besides, Nina was my flesh and blood. Surely she still held some affection for her mother.

Wouldn't she?



Serena's POV

I was reviewing quarterly projections when Vincent stepped into my office. He had that careful look when they're about to deliver potentially sensitive news.

"Ms. Sinclair, Atticus Thorne is here requesting a meeting. He mentioned something about the luxury line financing."

I paused, my coffee cup halfway to my lips. Considering we'd just wrapped up our last board meeting where we'd discussed going solo after two campanies pulled out of the bidding. The plan was to self-finance and maintain full control of distribution. Higher risk, but cleaner operationally.

"Show him in," I said, setting down my coffee.

A moment later, Atticus Thorne walked in, a blue suit. With his tall, straight posture and commanding presence, he caught my attention. Though not conventionally handsome enough to turn every head, there was something distinguished about him that set him apart from the crowd.

"Serena," he said warmly, extending his hand. He was using the casual approach.

"Atticus," I matched his tone, standing to shake his hand. "Please, have a seat."

Once we were settled, I didn't waste time. "Vincent mentioned you're interested in our luxury line?"

"I am." He sat with the easy confidence.

"Why now? Our situation isn't exactly a secret. Neiman's pulled out last week, and the media didn't exactly bury that story." 

"Because right now, StarRiver is undervalued. Your Fall collection proved you haven't lost your touch. The market's just spooked by the board drama." He spoke with the direct candor.

"Your portfolio?" I asked.

He pulled out a sleek leather portfolio. "Thorne Capital. We're boutique, but our assets under management are healthy."

I scanned the documents, noting the address. "What's your connection to the Thorne family?"

His slight smile told me he'd been waiting for this. "Rachel Thorne is my cousin, actually."

My eyes narrowed imperceptibly.

"Rachel's grandfather and mine were brothers," Atticus explained. "You probably know that the Thorne family is split between politics and business. My branch of the family went into politics."

I closed his company documents, my mind already reaching its conclusions though my expression remained neutral.

"I trust you're well aware of my... complicated relationship with the Thornes," I said carefully.

"Indeed," Atticus replied without hesitation. "That's precisely why I sought cooperation with you, Serena."

I raised an eyebrow.

"The enemy of my enemy is my friend." Atticus smiled, his expression the picture of cultured refinement. "Isn't that the same principle behind Rachel Thorne's alliance with Nina?"

###chapter 210
Serena's POV

I was about to decline when Atticus Thorne spoke up. "Serena, before you make your decision, let me explain why I'm going after Rachel, and what we could achieve together."

I held my tongue and waited.

"The Thorne family's always had a tradition," he began, leaning back in his chair. "Since my great-grandfather's time, we've maintained a careful balance. My side of the family focused on public service - Senate seats, governorship positions, that sort of thing. Rachel's branch handled our business interests. It worked perfectly for generations."

My attention caught on the way his fingers tapped against the table.

"But in the last decade," he continued, "Clarence - Rachel's grandfather - started pushing boundaries. He's been making the rounds in D.C., attending fundraisers, getting cozy with the DNC leadership. Meanwhile, Garrett claims he's running Thorne Corp, but everyone knows Rachel's the real power behind the throne."

"Their endgame is obvious," he said, his voice dropping lower. "They want to leverage Thorne Corp's success into political influence. But Clarence can't pull this off alone - he needs heavyweight backing. That's where Lucas Harrington comes in. The sudden engagement announcement wasn't exactly subtle."

He studied me. "I imagine you're wondering why a private equity giant like Harrington International matters in the political sphere?"

I stayed silent, though my mind was racing. I knew money and politics were two sides of the same coin.

"Super PACs," he said simply. "Dark money groups. Think tanks. Modern politics runs on corporate dollars, and the Thornes know it. Sure, they've got money, but compared to the Harringtons? They're playing in the minor leagues. With Harrington International's backing, they could fund a serious political operation. That's why neither Lucas nor Howard could easily refuse this alliance - even if they wanted to."

"And Lucas himself," Atticus continued, "Harrington's golden boy. When his father died and Harrington International was on the brink, everyone expected ###chapter 11. Instead, a twenty-something Lucas turned it into the most aggressive PE firm on the Street. Clarence sees Lucas as his ticket to the big leagues. Sometimes, being too good at what you do puts a target on your back."

The truth of his words settled heavily in my chest. I'd witnessed firsthand how Lucas's brilliant mind had made him the prize in the power games. The same mind that could dissect a billion-dollar deal in minutes, yet somehow still remembered exactly what my favorite...

"Let me be direct," Atticus continued. "To block Clarence's political ambitions, we need to make a move. In politics, unlike Wall Street, there's limited room at the top. If Clarence gets his foothold in D.C., my grandfather's influence diminishes. That's why I'm proposing this alliance, Miss Sinclair."

"You're overestimating my influence," I said bluntly. "Compared to the Harringtons or any major player on Wall Street, StarRiver Group is barely a blip. And politics? I wouldn't know the first thing about navigating the D.C. crowd."

"You're selling yourself short," he countered. "The fact that Lucas Harrington took notice of you speaks volumes..."

"Romance and business acumen aren't exactly correlated," I cut in sharply, ignoring the twinge in my chest at mentioning Lucas.

He pressed on, undeterred. "That's just one factor. While Clarence is trying to break into politics, my family needs to strengthen our business ties. You're positioning yourself as a rising force in the market. Sure, your current assets might not compete with the major players yet, but you're clearly a dark horse. I'm willing to bet on your potential." He paused meaningfully. "Plus, we share a common interest in preventing Lucas and Rachel's marriage."

"I want them to get married," I stated firmly. The words felt like glass in my mouth, but I meant them. If Lucas and Rachel could find happiness together, I needed to step aside gracefully.

"Regardless of what you're telling yourself," Atticus said with a knowing look, "I'm certain Lucas won't go through with marrying Rachel."

"Then why approach me?" I challenged. "Shouldn't you be having this conversation with Lucas?"

"Direct intervention would be too obvious," he explained. "The relationship between our families is... delicate. We haven't reached the point of open warfare yet. I need your help dealing with Rachel specifically."

I felt my shoulders tense.

"Everyone assumes Garrett is the key to the Thorne family's future plans, but they're wrong," he continued. "Rachel is the linchpin. Garrett might be their political play, but Rachel's the one keeping Thorne Corp running. If she stumbles, their business empire becomes vulnerable. Without that corporate backing, Clarence's political aspirations become pipe dreams."

"You're still overestimating me," I maintained. "I'm actively avoiding any confrontation with Rachel. I don't have the resources or inclination to challenge her."

"You don't have a choice," he said, his tone hardening. "You're already in Rachel's crosshairs. This setback will only make her more determined. You're smart enough to know that once she and Lucas are married, you won't simply be allowed to walk away. Rachel doesn't leave loose ends."

My heart sank, unable to counter his point.

"You've never been one to take things lying down," he pressed. "Otherwise, you wouldn't have made it this far. Your resilience is exactly why I know you won't refuse this offer."

"I'm refusing," I said firmly, meeting his gaze.

I saw a flash of steel in his eyes. After a long moment of silence, I decided to explain my position, feeling I owed him that much after he'd come all this way.

"I understand your logic," I said carefully. "Your proposal is... compelling in many ways. But I won't let myself be drawn into this power play. The level you're operating at, it's beyond my scope and interest. I don't have those kinds of ambitions. I just want..." 

I paused, choosing my words carefully. "I know my current situation isn't exactly stable, but actively jumping into this kind of warfare? That would only make things worse."
###chapter 211
Serena's POV

I watched Atticus Thorne's Adam's apple move slightly as he considered his next words. I knew he must have uncovered something.

Sure enough, he asked, "It's about the kids, isn't it?"

My expression must have changed, because he quickly added, "It wasn't exactly hard to find out."

"Mr. Thorne, if this is your approach, I don't think we have anything further to discuss," I said, my voice ice-cold.

"I'm not using the children as leverage, I assure you. I'm not that kind of person," he hurried to explain. "I just believe that a mother will do anything for her children. Don't you want to create a better, more stable future for them?"

"That's my personal business," I replied sharply. "I suggest you drop this line of conversation if you're not genuinely concerned about their welfare."

"Fair enough." He nodded and shifted gears. "Miss Sinclair, don't you want to take control of your own destiny? Are you content letting Rachel Thorne push you around, or are you banking everything on Lucas Harrington? No matter how he feels about you, Harrington is still a businessman, and when it comes to profits, very few people stay true to their principles."

I gave him a cynical smile. "Mr. Thorne, you're a businessman too. We've had one meeting - why should I trust you enough to work together? Is aligned interest really enough? What happens when those interests change? Politics shift all the time, and the Thornes are still family. After your little family squabbles are over, you'll all make up, and I'll be left holding the bag."

"That's exactly why I brought some insurance," he said, pulling a document from his leather briefcase.

I looked at him, instinctively assuming this was a bribe attempt, ready to shut it down.

"Just take a look," he said quietly.

I took the document and opened it. My face must have shown my shock as I read it. I stared at him.

"If I ever double-cross you, Miss Sinclair, you can use this to end my career," he stated simply.

I hadn't expected him to put himself on the line like this for a partnership.

He continued, "Whatever happens between Lucas Harrington and Rachel, right now, I'm your only real protection. At least with me on your side, Rachel won't dare try to use her connections to set you up."

I stayed silent, processing his words.

"Think it over, Serena," he said, standing to leave.

"Your document," I tried to hand it back.

"Keep it. As long as you haven't said no, I still have a shot at this partnership," he replied.

"I'm in," I decided suddenly.

I caught his slight smile before he masked it. My change of heart wasn't because I was moved by his show of trust, but because of what he'd said about a mother's strength. For Milo and Stella's sake, I needed to fight back.

Meeting his eyes directly, I said, "I can't promise I'll help you handle Rachel Thorne. The only thing I can guarantee is that I'll do everything in my power to maximize the business value of this partnership."

"That's enough. Rome wasn't built in a day. Rushing things just leads to mistakes," he replied.

"Should I brief you now on StarRiver Fashion's strategy?"

"No need. I'm just the capital - everything else is your call."

"Understood," I didn't elaborate, knowing that as a politician, business operations weren't his forte.

"Would you join me for dinner to celebrate our agreement?" he asked.

"I'm sorry, I can't. I need to pick up my kids," I declined firmly.

"Then I won't keep you from your family time," he said smoothly. "Could I get your cell number? We should stay in touch."

"Of course."

After exchanging contact information, he left.


Lucas's POV

Rachel called about the family situation - her grandfather was pushing the marriage arrangements again, citing the importance of "securing the family's future." I kept my voice neutral, responding briefly before ending the call.

A week later, I returned to Manhattan and headed straight to Serena's penthouse. It was already 11 PM. She just finished tucking in Milo and Stella. She looked surprised to see me standing there. "The kids just fell asleep. Tomorrow after school, either have Walter pick them up or go yourself. They have soccer practice at Riverside."

"We need to talk," I said. Despite the 14-hour flight from London, I tried to maintain my focused demeanor. I could tell Serena probably knew what this was about. While her partnership with Atticus Thorne hadn't made the journal, it was the talk of the cocktail circuit. Nobody expected the Thornes to partner with Serena's emerging StarRiver Group. But the deal was done, and now every hedge fund manager and venture capitalist was watching to see how it would play out.

"Come in," she stepped aside, leading me into her living room.

I sat on the couch and cut to the chase. "Why Atticus Thorne?"

"Right opportunity, right time, right value proposition," she answered calmly.

"Are you aware of what's happening inside Thorne family right now?" I pressed.

"I know enough to see the upside of this deal."

Fighting to keep my voice level, I said, "Serena, you can't tell me you don't see Atticus's endgame here."

"It's strictly business, Lucas."

I leaned forward. "Atticus told you about Clarence's political ambitions threatening the family's position. These aggressive moves against the family's traditional power structure. Because the timing is perfect. With this much at stake, do you really think getting involved is smart?" I challenged.

"Atticus can shield me from Rachel's vendetta," she replied coolly.

"And when he loses his board seat?"

"I'll cross that bridge when I come to it."

"This isn't like you, Serena. You never move without a long plan."

"So I should just trust your protection instead?" Her voice carried an edge.

My jaw tightened. "Have I ever given you reason not to?"

"You just said it yourself - Clarence has the SEC, and half of Congress in his pocket. If Atticus, with all his insider connections, can't touch him, what makes you think you can?!"

I watched her intently as she continued. "I was perfectly happy running my startup, Lucas. You pulled me into this world of old money and power plays, and I had to adapt. Let's be real - I'm on Rachel's hit list. As long as her family controls the East Coast financial sector, I have to watch my every move, wondering if the next 'random' SEC audit or negative press leak will destroy everything I've built. Atticus is my only shot at evening the odds. Without him, I'm just waiting for Rachel to finish what she started."

Her eyes glistened as she challenged me. "Lucas, what would you do in my position?!"

"Can't you see that partnering with Atticus hasn't just made you Rachel's target - you're now in Clarence's crosshairs too!" I struggled to keep my composure.

"So be it," she said with resignation. "There isn't much difference between a wolf and a pack of wolves."
###chapter 212
Serena's POV

I watched Lucas's throat tighten as he struggled to contain his emotions. The tension between us filled the living room, making the space feel smaller. We sat in heavy silence.

"It's late. You should head home," I said softly.

"Got anything for a late dinner?" The unexpected request made me look up at him. I had assumed the strain between us had reached a point where even civil interaction seemed impossible.

"Rough day. Couldn't eat much on the red-eye from London," he explained, his voice carrying the weight of exhaustion.

My heart sank, then nodded. "I could throw together some risotto?" It was all I had in my kitchen at this hour.

"That would be perfect," he said quietly.

I made my way to the kitchen that I rarely used. Despite my recent attempts to branch out beyond Postmates and DoorDash, I had to admit cooking wasn't my strong suit. Even the simplest recipes seemed to challenge me.

When I returned from the kitchen, I found him fast asleep on couch. The fatigue was evident on his face, and my chest tightened. I knew how demanding his role at Harrington International was, and I was painfully aware that the recent accidents had only added to his workload.

Taking a deep breath, I retrieved a cashmere throw from my bedroom and gently draped it over him. He stirred slightly but didn't wake.

I retreated to my home office to review some reports while waiting for him to wake up, but the hours stretched on. The clock on the wall showed it was past midnight, and I realized I would struggle to make my 8 AM meeting if this continued.

After saving my files and shutting down my MacBook, I approached him. "Lucas, wake up," I called softly.

His brow furrowed, and something like panic flashed across his face. Before I could finish saying, "It's late, you should get back to-" 

I let out a startled gasp as he suddenly pulled me down onto the couch, and I felt his warm lips press against mine, the lingering scent of his cologne enveloping me.

Before I could process what was happening, Lucas had me pinned against the couch, his weight pressing me into the plush cushions. His grip was unyielding, his cologne filling my senses.

The warm pressure of his lips crashed against mine, and I instinctively tried to push him away. "Stop!" But his embrace only tightened, making it difficult to breathe. In a moment of panic, my teeth caught his lower lip, drawing blood.

That seemed to snap him out of it. Lucas pulled back slightly, his steel-grey eyes darkening as he took in my flushed face beneath him. His suit was disheveled.

I opened my mouth to speak, but before I could get the words out - his lips found mine again. This time, the kiss was softer, almost tender, like the ones we'd shared during that weeks in Bahamas. The memory made me push harder against his chest.

When he finally released me, I hissed his name through clenched teeth. "Lucas freaking Harrington!" My voice shook with anger.

To my irritation, he had the nerve to smirk, running his tongue over his bloodied lip. I immediately looked away - his model appearance wasn't going to work on me anymore.

"My apologies," he said, his confidence somehow intact.

"Yeah, right. Like I haven't heard that before," I scoffed.

"Get off me," I said, my voice was cold.

Once he moved away, I straightened my loungewear. "Just leave."

"What about the risotto?" he asked, nodding toward my abandoned Blue Apron attempt in the kitchen.

"It's burned beyond recognition. Even the strays wouldn't touch it," I shot back.

I practically shoved him toward the door, cutting off whatever smooth talk he was about to attempt with a resounding slam.

Leaning against the door, I pressed my fingers to my tingling lips, angry at myself for the way my pulse was racing. Damn Lucas Harrington and his effect on me.
December in Manhattan was in full winter's grip.
Spencer Sherwood was hosting an end-of-year investor gala to celebrate his tech startup's successful Series B funding round. The grand ballroom was filled with elite - hedge fund managers, venture capitalists, and tech entrepreneurs networking over vintage champagne. I was actively expanding my team and looking for great people to join StarRiver. This gala would be perfect for connecting with potential candidates.
I chose a gown in platinum silk. Through the crowd, I spotted Quinn working the room with Spencer, her red gown a bold departure from her usual suits, which looked perfectly at home among the crowd.
"Serena."
I turned at the familiar voice. Jace Gillard stood there, looking thinner in black suit. He looked pale and disheveled, with an untrimmed beard that made him appear dejected.
"Long time no see," I greeted.
"Too long." His smile still held that director charm.
I felt a familiar ache. While Eleanor had faced a more public fall from grace, Jace's quiet struggles with burnout were just as real.
"Lucas just arrived," Jace murmured, nodding toward the entrance.
I followed his gaze to see Lucas Harrington walking in with Rachel Thorne. Without missing a beat, I excused myself.
I found a refuge on the corner. Quinn joined me minutes later.
"Hiding out?" she asked, settling onto the custom-heated marble bench.
I smiled. "Just taking a breather. How are your feet holding up?"
"These heels are murder," she sighed, slipping them off. "I should've stuck with Ferragamo."
"The curse of the red soles," I laughed. "Take them off - no one can see out here anyway."
Quinn glanced around the terrace before letting her feet rest on the heated stone. "God, that's better. The things we do for investor relations."
"It seems like Eleanor has been doing pretty well," she mentioned.
I nodded, genuinely pleased. "She's more resilient than any of us expected."
"It does," Quinn agreed.

Quinn's POV

I was chatting with Serena in the garden terrace. Marcus appeared by the stone pathway.
"Found you," he said with that familiar warm smile of his. I felt my shoulders tense instantly.

Being the intuitive person she was, Serena quickly read the room. "Quinn, I just remembered I need to make a call. I'll catch up with you later?"

I gave her a grateful nod. As she left, I caught her discreet glance back at me. Under the subtle landscape lighting, I fought to keep my composure as my eyes threatened to betray me.

"You've grown into quite the accomplished woman," he smiled, his voice carrying that same warmth I remembered from childhood.

I took a steadying breath before managing a quiet, "Marcus."

"Thought you might have forgotten about me after all these years," Spencer's older brother said. "It's getting chilly out here. Shall we head inside?"

As I reached for my heels, he stopped me. "Hold on."

Marcus knelt down, picking up my heel. The gesture reminded me of countless childhood memories, when he'd help me with my shoes after swimming. Just as he was about to help me, a familiar drawl cut through the moment.

"Really, brother? Playing Prince Charming with your sister-in-law?" 

Spencer stood there in his tuxedo, the lights creating a backdrop behind him. His tone carried that characteristic condescension.

"Quinn's practically family," Marcus replied, though his low voice had lost its warmth.

"No, Marcus. She's not 'practically' family - she's legally family. My wife, your sister-in-law," Spencer's casual stance belied his clipped tone. "I'll take care of my wife, thank you."

He approached us, and I watched Marcus hesitate before setting the shoe down and standing up.

"Oh, and by the way," Spencer added with practiced nonchalance, "your girlfriend's looking lost among the crowd in there. Maybe you should rescue her."

My heart skiped a beat when I hear they're dating. A quiet ache bloomed in my chest, but I took a deep breath and let it dissolve into acceptance. Serenity followed. 

Marcus offered a wry smile before walking away.

Spencer turned to me, his lips curving into that sarcastic smirk. "What's wrong? Surprised Marcus finally settled down?"

I composed myself, slipping into the calm facade. To him, I was just another merger and acquisition, albeit one that walked and talked.

He turned to leave. "Coming? Or did you actually expect the Prince Charming routine?"

This wasn't how I'd imagined my life would turn out. Spencer and I had no love lost between us - he'd made his disdain clear since our prep school days. If my family's hedge fund hadn't collapsed, I would never have agreed to this strategic marriage.

I hurriedly slipped on my heel, failing to suppress a wince. The six-inch heels had been manageable during cocktail hour, but after a full evening of networking, my foot was in terrible pain, and I could feel that the skin on my heel was scraped.

I caught Spencer watching me, one hand in his tuxedo pocket, radiating that cold indifference as I tried to mask my discomfort.

I steeled myself against the pain and matched his stride back into the glittering ballroom. I took his arm, playing my part in this high-society performance, every bit the perfect corporate wife these charity galas expected me to be.

Except for Sherwoods' events, I would absolutely not appear together with him, let alone interact at such close proximity

###chapter 213
Spencer's POV

I watch with barely concealed disdain as my mother, Christine, practically fawns over my "perfect" brother Marcus, who's just flown in from Berlin where he heads Max Planck Institutes's European division. The woman by his side is wearing a gorgeous dress, and her perfect smile is making my champagne sour taste even more bitter.

"Spencer, Quinn, come join us!" my mother calls out, her voice carrying that familiar lilt.

I stroll over with Quinn beside me, channeling my best passive-aggressive tone. "Well, look who decided to grace us with his presence. Harvard Business School's pride and joy actually cleared his calendar for me. Should I alert the New York Times?"

"Spencer!" My father, Richard, barks with stern voice. "Show some respect."

"It's fine, Dad," Marcus says with that same condescending smile he's had since his Harvard days. "Some things never change, right, baby brother?"

I can't help but roll my eyes. "You've been the family's golden boy since prep school. The youngest partner, board member of companies - how could anything I do possibly compare?" I glance around the ballroom. "I see Lucas by the bar. You guys can resume your perfect family reunion without me."
I could feel Dad barely containing his anger as he vented to Mom. "I just don't understand how two brothers could turn out so different," he fumed. "Marcus was always the smart one, always knew what he was doing. Never gave us any trouble. The only time he ever rebelled was when he decided to give up the family business to pursue his research career. We weren't thrilled about it, but how could we stand in his way? Especially when he was doing such important work for the country."
Then his voice turned bitter when speaking about me. "And then there's Spencer. Never took anything seriously. Getting into fights as a kid, and now? Nothing but drinking and chasing women. I can't even imagine what would happen to Sherwood Group if it ever ended up in his hands."
I heard the resignation in his voice as he continued, "Quinn is our only hope now. Maybe she can help Spencer get his act together and actually learn to manage the company properly."
I felt a toxic mix of anger and despair coursing through me. Their words cut deeper than they'd ever know. Quinn this, Quinn that - their perfect solution to fix their defective son. Each time they brought up her name, my resentment toward her grew stronger. The way they held her up as some kind of corporate savior made my blood boil.
They had no idea - or maybe they just didn't care - how it felt to constantly be measured against everyone else's standards. Marcus with his noble scientific pursuits, Quinn with her business acumen... and then there was me, the perpetual disappointment.
The more they pushed Quinn as the answer to all their problems, the more I despised her. 
"Coming?" I ask Quinn, already knowing she'll stay. Her silent response speaks volumes. "Right. Go to hell."
I make my way over to the bar where Lucas, Rachel, Drew, and Jace are hanging out.

"If it isn't tonight's star himself!" Drew calls out, raising his martini. "Enjoying your time with the family?"

I glanced at Drew with mild annoyance. "Thought you weren't showing up today. Why didn't you bring your girlfriend along?"

"She's shy," Drew replied with that insufferable grin of his.

"Tch." I couldn't help but scoff.

Drew's eyes wandered to the other side of the room. "Hey, was that your brother? The genius who went off to serve his country? He's back?"

I deliberately ignored his question.

"After all these years, you're still jealous of your brother," Drew needled.

"Jealous my ass," I snapped, feeling the heat rise to my face.

"Oh, touched a nerve, did I?"

"That's enough!" I reached out to give him a playful punch - nothing serious, just the usual banter between friends.

Drew blocked it half-heartedly, then let out an exaggerated "Ouch!"

"Getting soft since you got a girlfriend?" I rolled my eyes. "I barely touched your hand. What's with the dramatic reaction?"

"It's injured," Drew explained, holding up his finger to show a small cut.

"That tiny scratch?" I couldn't believe him. "How'd you manage that?"

"Cooking with my girlfriend," he said, practically glowing.

I stared at him in disbelief.

"Don't give me that look. It's called romance," Drew's face lit up like a lovesick teenager. "Someone like you wouldn't understand the joy in that."

I glanced at Jace, who remained silent.

"You're right, I don't understand. Nobody does," I said with exasperation. "Lucas, do you get this? Jace?"

Before they could answer, Rachel jumped in. "Actually, I think I understand," she said softly. "Cooking with someone you love can be quite wonderful."

Drew didn't respond her comment.

Rachel shifted uncomfortably before turning to Lucas. "It's getting late. Maybe we should head back, Luc. We have to leave early for Hoboken tomorrow."

Lucas agreed, then nodded to me. "We're heading out."

I nodded back, understanding how difficult things had been for him lately.

As soon as Lucas left, Drew started making his excuses too.

"Leaving already?" I groaned. "The party's just ending. Let's go for drinks."

"Need to get back to my girlfriend. Don't want her getting lonely."

"Drew, could you be any more nauseating with this lovesick act?"

Drew left without word, completely unfazed.

I turned to Jace. "If you have something else..."

"Nothing else. Once you're done, I'll join you for drinks."

I thought I'd misheard. The guy who hated nightlife was offering to go clubbing?

Jace had been acting strange lately, but I wasn't about to question it. I left the party early with him, my mind already on the night ahead.

###chapter 214
Quinn's POV

After the gala, I rode back to the Sherwood mansion with the family. In the car, Christine leaned forward from her seat. "Quinn, honey, you and Spencer have been married three years now. Have you thought about giving us a grandchild?"

I felt my chest tighten. A baby? Spencer spent more nights at club than in our wing of the house. The idea was laughable.

"I know it's been... difficult with Spencer," Christine continued, her voice softening. "But you've seen how he is. All those nights downtown, the gossip in the Post... Maybe a baby would give him something real to focus on besides bottle service at club. They say becoming a father changes men."

She didn't sound convinced. Neither was I.

"And then there's Marcus," she sighed, mentioning my workaholic brother-in-law. "Brilliant as he is in his research, even with this new girlfriend... I can't be sure he'll ever settle down. The Sherwood Group needs an heir - the shareholders are asking questions."

I understood their position. The Sherwoods had been generous, playing very nice to me and giving me a seat on their board. "I'll talk to Spencer," I heard myself say. "If he agrees... we can try."

It was past midnight when Spencer stumbled in, his suit reeking of vodka. He froze at his bedroom door, checking his watch - 2:30 AM.

"Lost?" His mouth twisted. "Marcus's room is down the hall, if that's what you're after."

I kept my expression neutral and played deaf to his mockery.

"Still here?" He glared when I didn't move. He loosened his tie with exaggerated movements. I looked at my watch instead of him.

After his shower, he emerged in a robe, scowling at finding me still on his armchair. "Quinn, what the hell? This isn't some Lifetime movie. Get out. I need to sleep."

"Your parents want a grandchild," I said quietly.

He barked out a laugh. "What am I, their personal breeding program? Not happening!"

"You're twenty-nine," I reminded him.

"I wouldn't do it at fifty-nine."

"By fifty-nine, your trust fund might not cover the IVF."

"Jesus, Quinn!" His carefully maintained composure cracked.

I stood up, keeping my voice steady. "According to my Flo app, I'm ovulating. One time could do it. If we miss tonight, it means more of your... precious time away from your buddies at club."

My silk robe was conservatively tied. "You've had plenty of experience in these situations. How do you want to handle this?"

His face twisted. "Have you lost your mind? Is this because Marcus brought his girlfriend home? That desperate? Remember our wedding night - how you couldn't even stay in the honeymoon suite?!"

Painful memories are flooding back, and I feel like I'm suffocating. I thought time would dull the pain, but his words still cut deep. I'm digging my nails into my skin, trying to use the physical pain to drown out the memories. I tried to compose myself. "This has nothing to do with Marcus. I just think we should start a family."

"I've already told you I'm not interested," he says, his impatience authority bleeding into every word.

Looking at his irritated expression, I stretch up on my heels, barely managing to kiss his neck. Even in heels, the height difference is ridiculous - he towers over my 5'4" frame with his basketball player height. I feel his throat tighten, his whole body going rigid.

My hand slips inside his robe. "Been skipping those SoulCycle classes lately?" I said, my fingers tracing his stomach. "Your six-pack isn't what it used to be..."

His expression hardens, that shark smile appearing. "Why don't you move that hand lower and find out?"

My fingers freeze against his skin.

"Getting cold feet?" He smirks.

"No, I just want to dim the lights." I hate how small my voice sounds.

"At least you know you're not Gisele Bündchen." His words cut like ice, but I stay quiet. The truth is, I just don't want to see the contempt in his eyes.

As I reach for the panel, he suddenly lifts me up. I startle at the sudden movement. He drops me onto bed like tossing a gym bag. "Let's make this quick."

His frame blocks out the moon light. When his face nears mine, I turn away instinctively.

"Really? Playing hard to get after trying to seduce me?" His laugh is pure condescension.

"We don't need to kiss to conceive." Even I can hear how pathetic that sounds.

"So this is just breeding stock for the Sherwood empire?"

"Family planning," I try to make it sound more sophisticated.

"Screw your family planning!" He pushes away from me. "If you're so hung up on my brother, go make your dynasty with him."

Before I can respond, he continues, his voice rising. "Let me tell you something, Quinn. I'm not some desperate fund manager who'll sleep with any socialite who comes calling. I have standards. You're like a Methodist choir girl in bed. You don't even make the cut. GET OUT."

His anger exploded so suddenly that my mind went completely blank. Before I can move, he grabs me and throws out.

The door slams hard enough to rattle the walls.

Tears streamed down my face, hitting the floor. I couldn't remember the last time I'd cried. I thought I'd become numb to things as I got older, but in that moment, I felt utterly humiliated. A deep, overwhelming sense of shame and a complete lack of dignity washed over me. I truly, deeply hated Spencer Sherwood - I always had, ever since we were kids.

I adjust my silk slip as I stand, fighting back tears. I'd expected tonight to go poorly - Spencer has always been volatile.

I push myself up from the floor when a hand appears in front of me.

Looking up, I see Marcus standing there. I was shocked, and desperate for him not to see how upset I was, I turned away abruptly and brushed away the tears. I took a deep breath, trying to get my heart rate back to normal. 

I take his offered hand and slowly stand. "Sorry if I woke you," I say quietly.

"Still on Berlin time," Marcus explains. He's been abroad for years doing research, only recently transferred back to Columbia for a new research grant.

"Has Spencer always been like this?" he asks, his voice gentle.

"You learn to deal with it," I reply. I don't want to lie to Marcus, but I also don't want him to worry.

"Quinn, I'm sorry. If I hadn't pushed for ..." he trails off.

"Ancient history," I force a smile. "It's late. I should get some sleep."

"Let me walk you to your room."

A sudden SLAM echoes through the house-Spencer taking out his anger on another door. I jump despite myself.

Marcus reflexively reaches for my shoulder. I could feel the warmth of his palm, and the feeling was oddly familiar. I was momentarily captivated, but I still pulled away.

"Sorry, I was just-" he starts.

"It's fine," I say, reaching my door.

As I'm about to go in, Marcus speaks up: "About Emma who came back with me-she's not my girlfriend. She's my colleague's daughter. I'm helping out until Aiden returns from his sabbatical next month."
###chapter 215
Quinn's POV

"The NSF wants me based here in Manhattan now. I'll mostly be at Columbia, with occasional trips to DC for grant reviews," he continues.

My heart skips a beat as the realization washes over me, though I force my face to remain perfectly still. "That's nice. Close to home," I say diplomatically.

"Quinn, I-"

My fingers tingle with suppressed excitement as I process this information, keeping my breathing steady and measured. "It's late, Marcus. Get some rest," I cut him off.

"...Right." I can see the unspoken words in his expression.

That night, I lie in my bed, exhausted but wide awake. Every time I close my eyes, my mind floods with memories I'd rather forget.

The next morning, I go through my usual routine, choosing a navy suit for the day. At breakfast in the main dining room, everyone except Spencer-who never surfaces before noon-is present, including Marcus and Emma.

"Oh my god, I feel so stupid! I totally thought she was your girlfriend," Christine laughs over her coffee.

"I wish! But Marcus here is playing hard to get. Don't worry though, Mrs. Sherwood, I'm persistent," Emma smiled.

"Emma, you're practically a sophomore. I'm old enough to be your professor," Marcus says firmly.

"Lucky for you, I have a thing for brilliant older men," Emma persists.

I focus on my avocado toast, letting their banter wash over me. After breakfast, Christine pulls me aside. "How did it go with Spencer last night?"

My heart sank, and yesterday's bad memories came flooding back. I tried to keep a neutral expression on my face. "He's not interested in that," I answer honestly.

"That boy..." she sighs. "We sent them to the same prep schools, same ivy league colleges, yet look at the difference." She touches my arm gently. "I'm sorry, Quinn. I'll try talking to him again."

I deeply appreciate her empathy and consideration. They have consistently treated me as if I were their own child, and the love they show me is one of the few warm feelings I experience. "Thanks," I smile. "I need to head downtown."

As I'm about to get into my car, Marcus appears: "Mind if I grab a ride?"

I glance at Emma behind him.

"Quinn, we're going to check out Fifth Avenue. Emma's never seen Manhattan during the holidays," Marcus explains.

From the driver's seat, I listen to Emma's enthusiastic chatter. It doesn't bother me-instead, I adore her naive and vivacious personality. I drop them off at Saks before heading to the Sherwood Group tower.


Jace's POV

A phone call jolted me awake. The production coordinator was confirming our afternoon shoot schedule.

Since parting ways with Harringtons, my directing career has stayed surprisingly stable. Sleep was impossible after that call. My hangover was brutal, head throbbing from too many whiskeys last night. So much for trying to drink away my problems - the bourbon only made everything worse.

In bed, I found myself scrolling through the group chat between Drew and Spencer on iMessage. The tears caught me off guard, sliding down my face before I even registered them.

The afternoon found me directing a night scene on location. We were shooting exteriors at a luxury condo complex. The weather was classic New York winter - freezing cold with that signature gray haze that meant snow was coming.

While blocking the actors and checking frames on the monitor, I spotted her. Eleanor was coming back, loaded down with grocery bags, bundled up in a coat and cashmere scarf that almost hid her face.

My heart skipped. When she started to look my way, I quickly turned to my assistant director, making a show of discussing the next setup.

Eleanor walked right past our film crew without breaking stride. Only after she disappeared into the lobby did I let myself look up, staring at the revolving door where she'd vanished.

"Mr. Gillard." My first AD's voice snapped me back.

"Yeah," I pulled myself together. "Okay, let's roll on this."

We kept shooting until well after dark.

"Want to grab an Uber, Jace?" one of the PAs offered.

"Thanks, but I've got my car. Need to handle a few things before heading out," I answered.

After the crew packed up and left, I sat alone on one of those stone benches. Winter in New York was brutally cold, especially after sunset, but I couldn't feel the chill.


Eleanor's POV

I stood by the window, watching the film crew pack up their equipment downstairs. Finally, I could bundle up in my wool coat and cashmere scarf, still trying to maintain my low profile before heading out.

Drew had left earlier for a meeting downtown. Now I was craving the famous hot chocolate and fresh cinnamon rolls from the corner food truck. Even at this hour, the streets were still alive with their usual energy - it should be safe enough to venture out alone.

The winter wind whipped down the street as I made my way downstairs, forcing me to keep my head down against the cold. When I reached the familiar silver food truck, its warm lights glowing invitingly, I ordered my usual.

"Flying solo tonight?" Mike, the vendor, asked with his characteristic Brooklyn accent.

"Yeah, Drew had a meeting," I murmured, keeping my face partially hidden behind my scarf. Even after being pushed out of the spotlight, I was still recognizable enough to warrant caution.

"That guy's something else," Mike chuckled warmly. "Last week when he picked up your order, he practically hugged the hot chocolate to his chest the whole way back to keep it warm. Must've burned himself, but he said you like it piping hot."

My heart warmed at hearing that. I should have seen what was right in front of me years ago. Instead, I'd chosen a path that only brought pain.

"Careful with that hot chocolate," Mike warned, handing over my order. "It's fresh off the burner."

"Thanks, Mike."

I called Drew while savoring my late-night treat, our conversation flowing easily as we discussed his meeting and the upcoming restaurant opening.

After finishing, I wrapped my scarf tighter and prepared to head back, still chatting with Drew. That's when the snow started. Delighted, I tilted my face up to watch the flakes drift down, sharing my childlike excitement with Drew as I stepped off the curb.

"SCREECH!"

The sharp sound of brakes cut through the night, followed by an impact that sent me sprawling onto the sidewalk, my phone skittering across the concrete.

Through my daze, I saw someone jump out of a black SUV, rushing forward with panic in their voice: "Oh my God, sir, are you okay?"

That's when reality hit - someone had pushed me to safety. Though I'd fallen, the SUV hadn't touched me. The person who'd taken the hit lay motionless in the street. 

I struggled to stand up and limped to pick up my phone nearby. I looked toward the accident scene, my heart sank when I saw the familiar camel hair coat. I had a premonition it was him. I limped toward that person, with each step my heart beating faster. After what felt like a century, I saw the face clearly in the dim glow of the streetlights. 

Jace Gillard!

"Eleanor? Ellie! What's happening? Talk to me!" Drew's worried voice carried from my phone.

I snapped back to reality, assuring him quickly, "I'm okay. There's been an accident."

"Were you hit?"

"No, no, I'm fine. Someone pushed me away... I need to check on them..."

"I'm coming right now. Don't move."

I ended the call and cautiously approached Jace. Blood trickled from scrapes on his face, and his expensive coat was torn and stained. His eyes were squeezed shut, his jaw clenched against the pain. 

My heart rebels against my mind's decree. Each beat seems to whisper his name, while my conscience screams at me to honor my oath. I find myself caught in an endless spiral of gratitude and guilt, of longing and resistance. 

"The ambulance is on its way," the driver said shakily, clearly in shock. A crowd of late-night pedestrians had gathered, their worried whispers mixing with the sound of approaching sirens.

When the EMTs arrived minutes later, I hesitated only briefly before climbing into the ambulance with them. The snow was falling harder now, dusting everything in white as we sped toward hospital.
###chapter 216
Jace's POV

It was just a surface wound. The cab driver had hit the brakes in time, resulting in only a minor impact. Though I'd scraped myself up pretty badly on pavement, no vital areas were affected. Still, the ER doctor recommended I stay overnight for observation, just to be safe.

After Dr. Patterson left, only Eleanor and I remained in the room. I watched as she organized all the hospital admission papers and medications on the standard-issue bedside table.

"Here's your paperwork - insurance forms, admissions documents, and your prescriptions. The nurse put your pain meds and antibiotic ointment in this drawer," she said with carefully maintained distance. Each professional, measured word reminded me of what we'd lost.

"Your iPhone got pretty banged up in the fall," she noted. "Want to use mine to call anyone at Harringtons?"

I just watched her silently. "I'm good," I declined with a slight shake of my head. She understood without explanation. 

"Should I call the nurse's station about getting you an aide?" she offered.

"The injuries aren't bad enough for that," I replied, fighting to keep my voice steady.

"Alright then." She nodded. "If that's everything, I should head out. Traffic on the FDR is probably terrible by now."

As she turned to leave, I couldn't stop myself. "Eleanor."

She paused, looking back at me.

"Your hand - you should have someone look at that scrape," I said, noting the angry red mark. The sight of her injury twisted something inside me.

"I'll stop by urgent care," she replied just as her phone buzzed with what was clearly a text notification. I couldn't miss how her face softened as she glanced at screen - such a stark contrast to her professional mask with me. I looked away as she typed a quick response.

After she finished texting, she asked, "What were you saying?"

I hesitated a bit. "Nothing," I shook my head, then added when I saw her frown, "Just... be careful heading home. The streets are still slick from the rain."

"Drew's picking me up," she stated matter-of-factly. "We're meeting some friends at Le Jardin for dinner."

Even though I'd known about her relationship with Drew, hearing her say his name with such casual intimacy felt like a physical blow. The pain in my chest had nothing to do with my injuries.

"Good," I managed, forcing a smile.

"Does it make you happy?" she asked, studying my attempted smile. "That I'm finally off your case? No more complications for a director with a bright future?"

"I actually..." I started, but she cut me off.

"Don't worry about it. I'm doing great. Better than you probably think. Looking back now, all those years of..." She paused, her voice steady and clear, "They really weren't worth anything."

I could only listen in silence. Each word landed like a precise hit, targeting all the wounds I'd accumulated.

Then she left without looking back. As I watched her figure disappear down the fluorescent-lit hallway, my vision blurred - though whether from the pain meds kicking in or something deeper, I couldn't say...



Serena's POV

It's been exactly a month since I last saw Lucas Harrington. No calls, no messages-radio silence.

This past month has been a whirlwind. StarRiver Group's luxury retail division has been making headlines in Women's Wear Daily. Our sales metrics are breaking records daily, and our stock has been trending upward on the NYSE. In a remarkably short time, we've managed to compete with several established players. While we're not quite Estée Lauder or Ralph Lauren yet-those empires weren't built overnight-our growth trajectory has caught everyone's attention. CNBC keeps calling me "Wall Street's rising star," and Bloomberg's predicting I could be the next fashion industry mogul.

But I know better than to let the hype go to my head. Being the media's darling can be a double-edged sword.

My partnership with Atticus Thorne this month has been... interesting. Though he's mostly been in Portland, we've kept in constant contact through Zoom and email. I've made sure to keep him updated with our marketing analytics and quarterly projections, and we've developed a decent working relationship.

Just after sending him this week's sales forecast, my phone lights up with his call.

"How about a trip to Portland?" he asks, straight to the point.

"Excuse me?" 

"My grandfather wants to meet you."

"Why?" I'm caught off guard.

"Let's just say you've made quite an impression," he says with casualness.

"Spencer, let's be clear-our partnership is strictly business, plus our mutual concern about Rachel. It doesn't need to extend beyond that." I keep my tone professional but firm.

"Come on, he's not going to bite. He just wants to talk business."

"I appreciate the offer, but I'll have to pass." 

"The Thornes are hosting their annual charity gala next week. Rachel's probably already had her assistant send you an invitation."

"And I'm supposed to drop everything and fly across the country?"

"Word on the street is they're announcing Lucas and Rachel's engagement date."

My heart grew heavy. So that's why he disappeared for so long - he got engaged. It seems he's given up resisting, I couldn't help but smile bitterly. "If it's a done deal, maybe it's time to focus on what we do best-business. We might even give them a run for their money in the market."

"You've got a point. You're sharper than half the VCs in Silicon Valley. I believe we could build something huge. But hey, nothing's final until the rings are exchanged. I'm not throwing in the towel yet."

"Your call." I let it drop. 

As I end the call, there's a knock at my corner office door. I haven't had a chance to digest the weight in my heart.

Vincent enters with careful efficiency. "Ms. Sinclair, this just arrived by courier-an invitation to the Thorne Foundation Annual Gala, next Saturday at Portland."

I examine the golden envelope, noting Clarence Thorne's signature. A personal invitation from one of the most powerful patriarchs-refusing would be social suicide in our circles. Atticus had played his hand perfectly.

My phone buzzes again. The name on the screen makes my heart skip. "Lucas Harrington."

The man who's been MIA for a month... Though that's not entirely accurate-he's been splashed across media and newspapers, always with Rachel Thorne on his arm at some LA hotspot or charity event, playing the perfect power couple.

I swipe to answer.

"Did you get the invitation?" he asks with a hint of anxiety.

"Yes," I keep my reply clipped.

"Don't come." Each word drops like a gavel in an empty courtroom.
###chapter 217
Serena's POV

The two bodyguards exchanged skeptical glances.

"He needs to get to hospital immediately," I pressed, letting my voice shake. "If he has a stroke or something, every minute counts. You want that liability on your hands?"

Without waiting for their corporate security protocol to kick in, I grabbed the sleeve of the nearest guard and pulled him inside. They found Jace exactly as I'd described-completely unresponsive on the sofa.

"Mr. Gillard?" The taller guard's voice boomed through the apartment.

Jace's forehead creased at the sound, but his eyes remained firmly shut despite his obvious struggle to open them.

"What are you waiting for, a medical degree?" I snapped. "New Haven General's ER is five minutes away. If he has a brain bleed or an aneurysm, that's the difference between life and death!"

Finally convinced by Jace's dead weight, one guard moved to lift him. I grabbed my bag, ready to follow.

"Ms. Sinclair," the other guard blocked my path, "our orders are to keep you here."

"Right, because I'm going to make a break for it with two armed guards and half of Manhattan's traffic cameras watching?" I countered. "I'm coming to the hospital. What if they need his medical history or insurance information? We can deal with your orders after we make sure he's not dying."

Without waiting for permission, I rushed after the guard carrying Jace. The other had no choice but to follow as we headed for the private elevator to the underground garage.

The black Cadillac Escalade cut through the evening traffic, with me wedged in the back seat between Jace Gillard and one of his security detail, while another drove. I could see Jace fighting the effects of the Ambien, his usual sharp features twisted in confusion. I knew from experience the sedative would only last a couple of hours at most - time wasn't on my side.

My phone felt slick in my grip as anxiety twisted my stomach. We were heading straight for New Haven General, taking Dona Tartt Avenue at a speed that made me nervous.

The SUV suddenly slammed to a stop. Pure instinct had me steadying Jace before he could pitch forward, the last thing I needed was a concussion complicating things. 

"What's the holdup?" the guard beside me snapped.

"Some jackass in a Lincoln ran the light," our driver growled. "Almost clipped us."

"Keep moving. Mr. Gillard needs medical attention," the guard ordered, his voice thick with irritation.

But as the Escalade prepared to roll forward, a black Mercedes appeared, blocking our path. Two men in tailored suits stepped out, positioning themselves directly in front of us.

"I'll deal with this," the guard muttered, checking his concealed carry holster before stepping out.

A text from Atticus popped up on my screen: "Get out of the car. Now!"

My heart pounded as I watched him walk away, my palm sweating against the door handle. The second he was clear, I yanked the door open and ran. I heard the driver's door slam and footsteps on the pavement, but I was already diving into the waiting Mercedes. As we peeled away, I caught the guard's furious expression in my side mirror.

Safe in Atticus Thorne's car, I finally let out the breath I'd been holding, though adrenaline still had my hands trembling. Atticus sat beside me, wearing his polite smile. I shot him an annoyed look - this wasn't some easy game to gloat over.

"You can't blame me for admiring your handiwork, Serena," he said, adjusting his tie. "Slipping Lucas Harrington's surveillance is no small feat, even for you."

I didn't respond. Nothing about this had been simple - it only worked because Jace trusted me completely. I'd betrayed that trust, and the guilt sat heavy in my chest. When my phone lit up with another FaceTime call, I declined it without looking.

Less than an hour later, I was boarding Atticus's Gulfstream G650 bound for Portland. He took me straight to Riverside Medical Center, the kind of private hospital that caters exclusively to Portland's elite.

"Let's head up," Atticus Thorne said, pressing the elevator button.

I eyed him carefully. "How do I know this isn't a setup?"

"You wouldn't have taken an plane to Portland with me if you didn't already have some faith in what I'm saying, Serena." There was that characteristic Thorne confidence.

*It's true, I made my decision a long time ago. Let's go all in.*

The hospital was one of those ultra-luxe private facilities where elite came to recover in discretion. Following Atticus through the corridors, I couldn't shake the weight of who we were about to meet-his grandfather, Silas Thorne. The man was practically a ghost; I'd never even seen his photo in media.

I'd figured a man reportedly fighting stage 4 cancer wouldn't be much of a power player anymore. People facing mortality usually show their cards. But...

The moment we stepped into the private suite, I froze. Instead of the expected hospice scene, I found myself facing a man who looked more like a semi-retired CEO than a terminal patient. He could've easily passed for early sixties, sitting there in a tailored robe, newspapers folded beside him. My mind raced. Had Lucas's intelligence team dropped the ball, or was this part of something bigger?

"Miss Sinclair expected the standard end-stage cancer patient setup, I see." Silas's voice carried that unmistakable politician's tone.

"The reports were quite convincing," I kept my voice neutral.

"All carefully planted." He didn't bother with pretense.

"So..." he continued, "I've been playing the long game here on the East Coast while everyone's been watching our West Coast operations."

I met his gaze. "If you've orchestrated something this complex, Mr. Thorne, why show your hand now?" In negotiation like this, false naivety would only backfire.

"Let's just say I've learned to trust Atticus's instincts about people." His words carried that distinctive mix of authenticity and stateliness.

"What exactly are you looking for from StarRiver Group?" I cut to the chase.

"This isn't about demands, Miss Sinclair. Consider it more of a... mutual understanding. When the dust settles after the Q4 earnings call, you'll find the Thorne family can be quite generous to its allies."

"I appreciate the clarity, Mr. Thorne." I kept my tone professional, but internally, my radar was blaring. In financial ecosystem, "mutual understanding" was just another term for mutually assured destruction.

###chapter 218
Serena's POV

I stood outside the Thorne Foundation charity gala. The scene was pure elite excess - paparazzi competing for angles, socialites' Instagram followers pressing against the barriers, and a small army of earpiece-wearing event staff coordinating with PD.

Inside the shelter of the Rolls-Royce, parked at the red carpet's end, I sat beside Atticus Thorne. After we'd left Riverside Medical Center, he'd accompanied me to Bergdorf's to select this light-green gown.

"Shall we?" Atticus asked with that characteristic reserve. He had that old money quality about him - the kind of unflappable composure you can't fake, no matter how many billions you make in tech or hedge funds.

My lips pressed together, conflict stirring. Lucas had been clear - he didn't want me anywhere near tonight's event. Yet here I was. I couldn't predict his reaction, and I shouldn't care, but...

"Yes," I met Atticus's gaze. 

"Something wrong?" I noticed his lingering look.

He caught himself, a ghost of a smile touching his lips. With a subtle nod to his private security detail, the door on his side opened first.

I watched as Atticus emerged into a strobe light storm of cameras, his frame commanding immediate attention. He circled the car with that distinctive grace, opening my door with practiced ease.

I placed my hand in his, aware that every society columnist and influencer had stopped breathing.

As I stepped out, I heard the collective gasp. Recognition rippled through the crowd. Taking Atticus's arm, I began our walk past the plaza's iconic facade, feeling the weight of crowd's attention. Each step was measured, practiced.

Walking the red carpet with him feels like navigating a minefield. While he maintains his signature subtle smile. I can't help but notice how the cameras seem to gravitate toward us.

He leans close, his breath warm against my ear as he whispers, "You've given me a whole new appreciation for what it means to walk a red carpet. I imagine Lucas Harrington must be contemplating my murder right about now."

I maintain my practiced smile for the cameras, but my voice carries an edge of ice. "Just keep walking."

His smile widens at my response - I can see it in my peripheral vision, and I know the photographers are catching every nuance of our interaction.

The press surges forward with their questions, like sharks scenting blood in the water.

"Mr. Thorne, what brings you and Miss Sinclair here together? Is there something special between you two?"

"Mr. Thorne, we've heard your grandfather is in poor health. Will he be attending tonight's gala?"

"Mr. Thorne, there are rumors about a major announcement from the Thorne family at tonight's charity event. Care to give us a preview?"

They turn their attention to me. "Miss Sinclair, what's your relationship with Mr. Thorne? Are you here as his date or as a special guest of the Thorne family?"

"Miss Sinclair, is that gown your own design or haute couture?"

"Miss Sinclair, StarRiver's luxury fashion line has been dominating the domestic market. Any plans for international expansion? Can you share your upcoming marketing strategy?"

Atticus takes the lead, his voice smooth as aged whiskey. "Miss Sinclair and I are here as business partners - nothing more."

When pressed about our joint venture in StarRiver's luxury line, he replies with calculated ambiguity. "Half true."

The reporters bite. "Half?"

"The partnership is real," he clarifies, "but the 'joint' part isn't. I'm merely an investor. All brand design, marketing, strategy, and sales are solely Miss Sinclair's domain."

I feel a complex mix of emotions as he publicly acknowledges my business acumen in front of the press. It's a power move, but I'm not sure for whose benefit.

When asked if he trusts me, he quips, "Trust? I'm mostly afraid I'd mess things up if I tried to get involved." The reporters laugh, and I can feel the tension ease slightly.

"Mr. Thorne has already clarified our business relationship, so I won't belabor that point. As for my gown, it's not one of my designs. Due to a small mishap during my flight to Portland, my original dress didn't arrive. Mr. Thorne arranged this Givenchy haute couture as a backup." I chimed in.

As we're about to make our exit, my heel catches - a genuine stumble. Atticus steadies me with practiced grace, his hand at my elbow.

That's when I see them - Lucas escorting Rachel Thorne onto the red carpet. My pulse quickens, a painful flutter in my chest. And I realize, with a sinking heart, that we're not just apart; we're adversaries now. The sadness is overwhelming, a heavy weight pressing down on me. But I lift my chin, maintaining my composed exterior. 
###chapter 219
Nina's POV

I stood at the entrance of Portland's Powell Hotel, my heart racing beneath my gown. As the newly appointed CEO of Sinclair Group, I'd finally secured an invitation to the Thorne family's annual charity gala. Truth be told, our company wouldn't normally make the cut, but Rachel Thorne made an exception. She personally sent the invitation via her assistant, mentioning that since we're now business partners, she wanted to "broaden our collaborative opportunities."

The invitation came in a envelope with gold embossing. I've moved out of the family estate, buying my own place in Pearl District. Angela, in her dress and perfectly coiffed hair, visited several times. She put on that fake smile of hers, going on about how "we girls finally have a seat at the table." She couldn't resist mentioning how Beatrice was practically under house arrest thanks to Lawrence. Her constant name-dropping of mutual friends and hints about "family legacy" made her intentions crystal clear - she wanted a piece of Sinclair's success.

Did she really think I'd forgotten all her tricks? I grew up watching her manipulate everyone at every country club event and charity board meeting. Her game plan was obvious: butter me up now, then start pushing for board positions and share transfers. I had security escort her out, even as she dropped her socialite façade and showed her true colors. I've worked too hard - no one's getting their hands on Sinclair's shares, not even family.

I'd spent three hours with my stylist perfecting every detail, expecting to own this red carpet moment. My heels clicked deliberately slowly on the carpet, waiting for the press to notice. After I took over Sinclair Group, I haven't given any formal interviews yet, and my PR team had prepped me thoroughly for tonight's event.

Just as I was chalking up the reporters' indifference to Portland aloofness, the atmosphere suddenly electrified. Turning around, I watched Atticus and Serena step out of a black Rolls-Royce. Every camera swiveled their way like moths to a flame. The reporters' enthusiasm made me feel like I was wearing last season's collection.

I tried telling myself their excitement was just for Atticus - this was a Thorne family event, after all. Of course, they'd fawn over Portland's most eligible bachelor. But then came the rapid-fire questions aimed at Serena, most having nothing to do with the Thornes or their charity foundation. The bitterness rose in my throat like bile.

Who does Serena think she is? Today's media circus has been a complete humiliation. And now she's cozying up to Atticus? Just because Lucas is with Rachel, she thinks she can just hop to the next billionaire? First Ian from the Whitmore fortune, then Lucas Harrington, and now Atticus Thorne - she's climbing the Forbes list one man at a time!

As I retreated crestfallen to the ballroom, someone shouted, "Mr. Harrington and Miss Thorne have arrived!" 


Rachel's POV

I watched as Serena gracefully entered the ballroom with my cousin Atticus. I clenched my fists as I noticed how naturally she fit with him. Lucas stood beside me, his black suit impeccable as always, as we both observed their interaction. The soft jazz from the quartet couldn't mask the tension in the air.

"Looks like my cousin and Serena have really hit it off," I remarked, aiming for the casual tone. I glanced at Lucas, studying his reaction.

He remained stoic - typical poker face. To the casual observer, he might have seemed indifferent, but I knew better. The more he tries to hide his emotions, the more it shows how much he cares about her.

Tonight was supposed to be our moment. After a month of Grandfather's strategic maneuvering - keeping Lucas in Portland to oversee Thorne Enterprises' expansion - we'd finally announce our engagement. 

Lucas hadn't fought it. He couldn't, not with the Thorne family's influence over the Portland shipping terminals his company needed. I'd promised him a marriage of convenience - just business. Once he helped stabilize our family's position, we could quietly divorce.

I'm not sure how much of that he actually believed, but he'd accepted it all in silence. Not that his belief mattered to me anymore - my goal was simply to secure the marriage. Once we're married, given both families' social standing and business interests, divorce would be practically impossible. Each step was calculated, leading him deeper into my carefully laid trap.

The press descended like vultures.
"Mr. Harrington, the market's buzzing about your involvement with Thorne Enterprises in Portland. Should we expect wedding announcements tonight?"

"Will you be dividing your time between Harrington International's Manhattan headquarters and Thorne's Portland operations after the wedding?"

"Miss Thorne, there's speculation about your relationship with Mr. Harrington's children. You've known each other for years - when did things change?"

While Lucas maintained his aloofness, I channeled my confident charm. "Lucas has been instrumental in advising on our expansion. Post-marriage, we'll both continue leading our respective operations. As for residential decisions between Manhattan and Portland, we're focused on business integration first."

Regarding Milo and Stella, I smiled warmly, "They're family to me. Having grown up together between Manhattan and our summer homes, they're as much mine as anyone's. But they're focused on their studies, and we'd appreciate privacy for their sake."

I whispered to Lucas. "I hope you don't mind my discretion about the children? The last thing we need is media's speculation."

"It's fine," he replied, his terseness in full effect.

Sometimes I feel like I'm performing in a one-woman show off-Broadway. But patience was a virtue my grandfather had drilled into me. Lucas would be mine - it was just a matter of time and strategy.

I put on my best concerned expression. "I just want to protect them from the gossip columns. They're like my own - you remember those years in London when they were little."

"I remember," he said, already scanning the room for potential investors.

I detected the perfunctory tone in his voice, and knowing he'd grow impatient if I pressed further, I let it go despite my dissatisfaction with his answer. Taking his arm, I walked with him into the hall.
###chapter 220
Serena's POV

The guest list for the Thorne Foundation's annual gala reads like a Who's Who of Oregon
and Washington society - campany executives, media moguls, and old money families who've shaped the city for generations.

The crowd's attention shifts as Lucas enters with Rachel Thorne. The buzz is understandable - after all, her grandfather Clarence had specifically chosen her to chair this year's gala, marking her official debut into the philanthropic scene.

A wave of appreciative murmurs follows them as they make their rounds. Lucas looks impeccable in his tuxedo. He has that rare quality that commands attention without seeking it, the kind of presence that makes even jaded socialites turn their heads.

Rachel stands out in a crimson gown, clearly dressed to make an impression.

"Getting under your skin?" Atticus asks beside me, watching them work the room.

"Not in the least," I reply honestly. "I genuinely hope they're happy together."

"That's disappointing to hear," Atticus says with a wry smile.

They approach us then - Lucas and Rachel. When my eyes meet Lucas's, the air seems to crackle with unspoken tension. The silence stretches between us like a taught wire.

Rachel breaks it first. "Well, cousin, looks like you got the jump on me," she says to Atticus.

"Oh?" Atticus plays along.

"I've been trying to get Serena for our foundation's initiatives for months," Rachel says with practiced grace. "Imagine my surprise when I heard about your partnership."

"Come on, Rachel," Atticus replies, his casual tone carrying an edge. "You've got Lucas Harrington backing you - that's worth more than half of Manhattan's capital combined. I'm just getting my feet wet in the foundation world. Don't shut me out before I've even started."

"Don't sell yourself short," Rachel says, her hand resting on Lucas's arm with calculated familiarity. "We're all on the same team here. Lucas, let's grab some champagne and toast to their success."

I maintain my composure as I watch her subtle power play. Lucas remains stoic, showing no intention of participating in the suggested toast.

The awkwardness is interrupted by Atticus. "I believe Mr. Harrington is aware that Serena's avoiding alcohol on doctor's orders."

I catch Lucas's sharp glance at Atticus.

"Besides," Atticus continues smoothly, "you've got a full house of donors to charm tonight, Rachel. Don't waste time on family."

"Fair point," Rachel concedes. "Lucas, we should check in with the board members. They're waiting by the silent auction."

I watch Lucas's jaw tighten almost imperceptibly before he turns away with Rachel. His gaze lingers on me, taking in my easy rapport with Atticus. I feel very uncomfortable, as if I had been unfaithful. Even though I try to push these thoughts away, this darkness keeps weighing on my mind.

As they walked away, Atticus caught me at the bar. "Talk about missed opportunities."

I took a sip of my sparkling water, keeping my tone casual. "What do you mean?"

"I thought Lucas might pull a Graduate moment back there - you know, sweep you off your feet, leave everyone shocked." He smirked, referencing the classic American film.

I gave him my analyst stares. I found his jokes boring, and they even made me a bit angry.

Atticus wasn't deterred. "Had my money on him losing his cool tonight. Thought he might channel his inner romantic hero and whisk you away from all this Thorne family drama. Would've made my day."

"You clearly don't know Lucas very well," I said, my voice cold.

"Got to hand it to him - man's got more restraint than I gave him credit for."

"And you're overestimating my significance," I replied, my tone neutra. Just stating facts - he'd overvalued my position in Lucas Harrington's portfolio, so to speak.

"Come on, Serena," Atticus said in drawl. "Take a good look at the guy's hands. He's gripping the glass like he's trying to crush it."

I was surprised by the details he described, I didn't want to believe what he said, I didn't want to give myself hope. My eyes flickered briefly toward Lucas before I caught myself.

"I need some air," I set down my glass, ready to escape to the terrace.

"Hold up," Atticus called out. "The real show's about to start."

I shot him a skeptical look, but he maintained that smug smile.

Eventually, I stayed, watching the power players work the room. Including Nina, of course, working the crowd like she was running for office.

The ballroom lights dimmed to that perfect charity gala ambiance, focusing everyone's attention on center stage where a spotlight carved through the sophisticated gloom.

Ryan's successor stepped forward with confident smile: "Distinguished guests, good evening. Thank you all for taking time from your busy schedules to join us at the Thorne Group's Annual Charity Gala."

Applause rippled through the crowd like a wave.

"Please welcome our hostess for the evening, Miss Rachel Thorne, to deliver the opening address."

Rachel emerged in stiletto heels, taking her place with the practiced grace of someone who'd grown up in the spotlight. When she took the mic, every socialite in the room leaned forward.

"This marks my first year chairing our foundation's gala," she began. "Any shortcomings in tonight's arrangements are entirely my responsibility. I must first thank my grandfather for this opportunity to prove myself. Thank you for believing in me."

She directed a perfect bow toward Clarence Thorne, who was holding court at his table.

"I'm also grateful to my parents and brother for their guidance. Your support has made this possible."

Another camera-ready bow.

"Finally, I need to thank someone special. Without his constant support, I wouldn't have found the confidence to take on this responsibility. He even put his merger deals on hold to spend a month with me in Portland." The room knew exactly who she meant - every gossip column in the city had covered Lucas's absence.

I felt Atticus studying my reaction. Without turning, I asked flatly, "This is your big show?"

"Not dramatic enough for you?" he countered.

I kept my face as blank as a new poker player.

Atticus let out a low chuckle.

I watched Rachel turn toward Lucas's table. "Lucas, thank you. Your support means everything."

The raw emotion in Rachel's voice was impossible to miss - as genuine as anything could be in this room full of practiced performances. The strategic lighting kept Lucas's reaction hidden.

"As always, every dollar raised tonight will go directly to the Thorne Foundation's charitable initiatives, with full oversight from our partners at Milano. Thank you all for being here."

Rachel gave a final graceful nod to the crowd, prompting another wave of appreciative applause.

"And now, I officially declare the Thorne Group's Annual Charity Gala... open!"
###chapter 221
Serena's POV

"Ladies and gentlemen, before we move to our silent auction items, I have an exciting addition to tonight's program," Rachel announced with her beautiful charm.

I have a vague feeling of a bad premonition.

The crowd of elites turned their attention to the stage, champagne glasses pausing mid-sip. Rachel continued, "We're adding a special auction lot - a spotlight dance at the Winter Ball tonight. Two lucky ladies will be selected to have their first dances auctioned off, with all proceeds benefiting the Children's Hospital's new pediatric wing."

I observed the subtle reactions around the room. The crowd was buzzing with discussion. I saw clear anticipation on Nina's face. I felt this was a trap set up for me.

"Any volunteers?" Rachel's voice carried across the room.

The room buzzed with nervous energy. Several groomed girls shifted in their seats, chatting with their mothers quietly.

Atticus knocked back his wine and leaned over. "You should do it. I'll make sure you outshine everyone tonight."

"Save it," I replied, though he just grinned at my response.

When the volunteers failed to materialize, Rachel smoothly pivoted. "Well then, let's make this more interesting. Everyone received a numbered paddle for tonight's auction. I'll draw two numbers, and those ladies will have the honor of participating in our special lot."

A wave of relief swept through the room - the burden of choice lifted from their feet.

"Number 5," Rachel announced.

Nina stood up, wearing a emerald gown while trying to channel old Hollywood ingenue. "That's me," she said with practiced modesty.

"Nina Sinclair, everyone!" Rachel's tone warmed considerably. "One of Manhattan's brightest young philanthropists. Please, join us on stage."

As Nina made her way up, Rachel pulled another number. "Number 71."

My auction paddle suddenly felt heavy in my hand. My brain kept thinking about possible scenarios and considering countermeasures.

"Do we have number 71?" Rachel's voice carried just a hint of knowing. Her words snapped me back to reality. 

Atticus, never missing a chance to stir the pot, smirked. "What are the odds? The Sinclair sisters in the spotlight again."

I shot him a icy look. This was no coincidence. Rachel would have had her staff memorize every major donor's paddle number before the event even started.

"Number 71..."

"Right here," Atticus called out, ignoring my death glare.

Rachel's surprise was sounded pompous. "Serena? Oh, this is perfect! Our two most generous young donors together. Please, come up."

"Of course," Having accepted this reality and with a plan already formed in my mind, I drew a quiet breath and responded with composure.

I made my way toward stage, catching the light. I catched Lucas's caring gaze, and the raw emotion in his eyes threatened to crack my composed facade. Forcing myself to ignore his tender look, I found my heels carrying me to the stage almost of their own accord.





Nina's POV

I'd spent hours with my stylist perfecting tonight's look - a emerald gown and Winston diamonds. Standing on the stage, I could feel the appreciative glances. I know my strengths - an innocent, vulnerable expression. But then Serena glided onto the stage, and suddenly it was like I'd become invisible.

God, I've always envied her effortless grace. She has that rare quality that makes even Vogue editors do double-takes - the kind of presence that makes everyone else, even someone like Rachel Thorne look like they're wearing off-the-rack from the department store.

Watching her step up, I felt my society smile falter. I could literally track the moment when every fund manager and real estate mogul's attention shifted from me to her. Once again, she'd stolen the spotlight without even trying.

Fighting back my irritation, I listened as Rachel announced, "Well, this is turning into quite the New York moment. Two of Manhattan's favorite sisters - I couldn't have planned it better myself."

After some society small talk, Rachel got down to business: "Let's move on to the highlight of our evening. We'll be auctioning off the first dance with these lovely ladies. Nina, you're first up."

I stepped forward, channeling my best charming smile as I took the microphone. Playing up my sweetheart image, I said, "I'm honored to be part of tonight's St. Jude's Children's Hospital benefit. As a first-time participant in this wonderful tradition, I'm truly touched by everyone's presence. I hope you'll all bid generously to support such an incredible cause."

The bidding started:
"Two hundred thousand."
"Three hundred thousand."
"Five hundred thousand."
"Eight hundred thousand."

Finally, some tech mogul won my first dance for a million dollars. Despite his messy hair and inappropriate clothes, the price point saved face. I'd expected maybe half that, and there had been decent competition from several venture capitalists - not too shabby.

Then came Serena's turn. I watched with barely concealed disdain as she took the mic: "St. Jude's Children's Hospital holds a special place in my heart. While this dance auction is a cherished tradition, I encourage everyone to save their most generous bids for the remarkable items we have later tonight."

Watching her effortlessly command the attention of every power player in the room, I felt that familiar burning resentment.

She was always putting on this holier-than-thou act, spouting empty platitudes. I couldn't stand her attitude - she obviously loved the attention just as much as anyone else, so why put up this pretentious act of being above it all? I silently fumed, cursing her name.

But Rachel had promised everything was arranged - the key players had been persuaded to keep their paddles down during Serena's auction. I hid my smirk behind my champagne flute, anticipating the coming humiliation.

Rachel raised her diamond-adorned wrist to adjust her microphone, announcing with excitement, "The bidding for the first dance with Serena Sinclair, CEO of StarRiver Group, begins now!"
###chapter 222
Rachel's POV

Not a single paddle moves. Perfect.

"No opening bids?" I touch my strand of pearls. Watching Serena maintain her composure. *Acting all calm, but I'll show everyone who you really are.*

I suppressed my excitement and continued, "Well, to keep our auction moving along for the Children's Hospital... Serena, dear-" I give her a sympathetic look.

Just as Serena starts to gather her gown to leave the stage, that unmistakable voice cuts through the silence: "Five hundred thousand."


Everyone turns toward Lucas Harrington. I stared at Lucas in shock, my heart feeling like it had been sucker-punched. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine he would swoop in at this critical moment to protect Serena, completely destroying my pride.

My carefully maintained smile slips for a moment. Since the engagement announcement between Thorne Industries and Harrington Holdings, Lucas has played the perfect corporate fiancé. Now he's choosing to challenge me in front of every board member and society elites?

I meet his gaze, but those grey eyes - show zero remorse. As if it is completely normal. The steely determination in his eyes told me nothing I said would stop his bidding now. My thoughts spiraled into chaos as I stood frozen on stage, painfully aware of the murmurs rippling through the crowd below, completely paralyzed with indecision.

"Six hundred thousand." Atticus's voice burst through the room.

Their voices rang out in turn, echoing through the hall.
Lucas: "Seven hundred thousand."
Atticus: "Eight hundred."
Lucas: "Nine hundred."
Atticus: "One million."
Lucas: "One point two."
Atticus: "One point five."

As Lucas reacheed for his paddle again, I couldn't help but interject: "Lucas." I said softly. "As Serena said, this is just the opening act. While your enthusiasm for children's benefit is admirable, there's plenty more to come." My voice came out almost like a plea, as I completely forgot I was center stage in front of everyone.

Instead of taking the hint, Lucas gives me that familiar cold stare and raises his paddle again.

My smile freezed. *I've practically groveled, and he won't even grant me this?*

Just as my carefully curated image threatened to crack, Serena's voice rany out: "Two million."



Atticus's POV

I watched the society columnists practically salivating - a Sinclair heiress bidding on her own charity auction dance? The Met Gala had nothing on this drama.

"Twenty million to St. Jude's Children's Hospital," she announced in confidence and a hint of tremble. "I'm bidding on my own dance card." Her determined showed in every syllable.

The whispers erupted louder than before.

Serena turned to Rachel Thorne, who was emotionless and emitted a tense air around her. "The bylaws don't prohibit self-bidding at charity auctions, do they, Rachel?" Serena asked Rachel Thorne directly, her tone perfectly balanced between politeness and challenge. 

I noticed Rachel's momentary confusion - clearly, she hadn't anticipated this move. Serena Sinclair had always been unpredictable, and even Rachel couldn't read her intentions now.

"I have immense respect for the Thorne Foundation's dedication to charitable causes," Serena continued smoothly. "I simply wish to contribute in my own way. I hope everyone can understand my intention." The elegant deflection wasn't lost on me - she was gracefully sidestepping both Lucas Harrington's and my potential bids.

"Of course," Rachel quickly agreed. 

I knew she was worried about Lucas Harrington driving up the price further. While money wasn't the issue, her pride was at stake. 

She extended her hand to Serena. "Since you've shown such generous intent, who are we to refuse? The first dance is yours. Thank you for your remarkable support of the Thorne Foundation's charitable initiatives."

Serena returned the handshake with perfect poise before gracefully exiting the stage to thunderous applause. Every eye in the room followed her. 

I tried to put Rachel on the spot and make her look bad, but Serena smoothed things over. I had to acknowledge that the rumors about Serena Sinclair were true - brilliant, beautiful, and formidable. 

She turned out to be more intriguing than I expected. Her performance tonight was masterful, simultaneously honoring Rachel's position, maintaining her own independence, and garnering universal acclaim.

The air seemed to crystallize when she passed Lucas Harrington, their unspoken tension visible to anyone paying attention. When she finally reached my side, I couldn't resist commenting, "Serena, you never cease to amaze."

She brushed past me without acknowledgment, leaving the ballroom. 

I rubbed my nose ruefully, knowing I'd earned her displeasure tonight. To be honest, I had my own agenda - my goal was to drive a wedge between Lucas and Rachel, and ultimately challenge Rachel's position. I'd been upfront about this when Serena and I first formed our alliance.
###chapter 223
Serena's POV

I needed to escape the suffocating atmosphere, so I slipped out into the private garden. The real reason wasn't just the endless small talk - my ankle was killing me. I'd twisted it earlier while navigating the steps during the red carpet walk. What had seemed like a minor nuisance then had become impossible to ignore after hours of socializing.

Finding a quiet spot near an illuminated fountain, I sank onto one of the limestone benches and carefully removed my heels. The spring air was crisp against my bare feet, and I could hear distant taxi horns mixing with the string quartet playing inside. 

Just as I was about to massage my throbbing ankle, a shadow fell across the garden lights. My stomach did that familiar flip - even before looking up, I knew it was Lucas.

I glanced up at Lucas Harrington, his tall frame blocking out the warm garden lighting. His tuxedo was impeccable as always, but there was tension in his jaw that his carefully neutral expression couldn't hide. I looked away, focusing instead on my ankle. That's when his hands - steady and warm despite the cool evening - reached down and lifted my foot.

"Back off, Lucas," I said, my tone irritated.

He ignored me with that trademark Harrington intensity, his fingers finding the tender spots around my ankle with uncomfortable accuracy. I fought back a grimace. 

Everyone knows he's engaged to Rachel, so why does he keep pursuing me? He's being completely selfish - making me look like the other woman while everyone judges me. Why should I have to deal with being labeled a homewrecker because of his actions?

"This might sting," he warned, his voice carrying soft drawl that only emerged when he was focused.

Before I could retort, "Jesus!" The exclamation escaped as he manipulated my ankle with the precision of someone obviously familiar with sports injuries. The sudden pain almost made me kick him square in his face.

"What the hell are you doing?" I snapped, my carefully maintained composure finally cracking.

"Stand up," he said calmly. He slipped my shoe back on with surprising gentleness.

I shot him a irritated glare, but something in his expression - familiar warm smile and damn handsome - made me comply. Rising cautiously, balancing on five-inch heels and a tender ankle, I felt myself sway slightly.

Lucas steadied me, his hand warm through the silk of my evening gown. It was barely a touch, but before I could step away, he pulled me against him.

I never imagined this would happen. At the Thorne charity gala, when he pulled me close, everything came rushing back - his familiar cologne, the feel of his strong and worm embrace - it all hit me at once, overwhelming my senses. That deep, irresistible feeling I thought I'd buried came flooding back, and I couldn't fight it.

The embrace was becoming more and more overwhelming. I pushed against his chest, my hands hitting the fine wool of his suit. "Let go, Lucas. I mean it!"

He buried his face in my neck. His arms formed an unyielding circle around me, protective and possessive in a way that made my pulse race.

"Can't breathe," I managed to gasp, genuinely struggling for air. My face felt hot, and I was acutely aware of how this would look if any of meida photographers happened to wander into the garden. But Lucas only held me tighter, as if I might disappear into the night the moment he loosened his grip.

My heart was racing, and I couldn't tell anymore if it was from anger, fear, or... something else entirely. Something that made me want to both push him away and pull him closers.





Lucas's POV

I held her like a drowning man clinging to a lifeline, deaf to everything around us. My arms tightened with each passing second. I could feel Serena's face burning hot, her breathing becoming shallow, but I couldn't make myself let go. The thought of releasing her only made my grip more desperate.

"For God's sake, Lucas, she can't breathe. Let her go before she passes out." Atticus's sardonic drawl carried across the garden.

Only when I felt Serena going limp did I finally release her. She doubled over coughing, gulping in the crisp winter air. Watching her struggle for breath should have snapped me back to reality, but the storm raging inside me wouldn't subside.

"It's freezing out here. Let's head back inside." As Atticus reached for her, I intercepted, grabbing her hand possessively. He just stood there with that insufferable Thorne family smirk, which only stoked my anger further.

Serena jerked away from my grip. My fingers twitched, instinctively reaching for her again. Seeing her by Atticus's side all evening had nearly driven me insane. I've been holding back my anger all night. When I held her moments ago, it hit me like a punch to the gut - she was slipping away, and Atticus. Like a persistent shadow, he showed up yet again, ruining what should have been a peaceful moment with Serena. He just can't seem to leave us alone.

"Back off, Lucas," she snapped, every syllable sharp as broken glass.

"Don't leave with him," I growled.

Her response cut clean through my suit: "You lost all right to make demands when you got engaged to Rachel. Remember your position - you're here as the Thorne Industries' golden boy with your society bride-to-be, and I'm just another guest at their charity gala. With my date."

"Just wait for me. Please." I hated how desperate I sounded.

"Waiting for you?" She laughed bitterly. "Like you're waiting for me while playing happy couples with Rachel? Give me a break."

I watched, my stomach churning, as she deliberately wrapped her arm through Atticus's, his victory smile making my blood boil.

"Welcome to the real world, Lucas. Not everything revolves around what a Harrington wants." She turned away, heels clicking on the marble.

Something in me snapped. I grabbed her arm, murmuring, "I'm calling you a car." Fighting to keep my voice steady, I make one final request.

Atticus stepped into our path, his frame blocking the entrance.

"Move," I snarled. Atticus's provocative behavior made me snap, destroying the last shred of self-control I had left. Now all I can think about is having someone kill him and dump his body somewhere.

He didn't budge. "I don't give a damn about your history with her or what trust fund baby drama this is. Tonight, she's my guest at my family's event, and what she wants is what happens. Back. Off."
###chapter 224
Serena's POV

I watched Lucas and Atticus square off like two apex predators. Lucas's grip on my wrist tightened.

"You call this protecting her?" Lucas's voice carried that fury edge that could cut through air tension. I caught the slight twitch in Atticus's otherwise perfectly maintained composure.

"If it was protection, she wouldn't be at this circus," Lucas continued, his usual restraint giving way to raw anger.

"This isn't about Atticus," I cut in, my voice sharp. "I'm here because I choose to be."

"Serena..." His tone carried a hint of surprise, clearly not expecting me to speak up for Atticus.

I lifted my chin, channeling every ounce of steel in my voice. "This is a business partnership with clear ROI. Nothing more. I'm here because it's good for StarRiver's market position. Now let go."

I tried to pull away, but his grip was unyielding. I feel a bit angry - no one can control me.

"We're leaving for Manhattan. Now." His tone was dominant - brooking no negotiation, dismissing any counter-offer.

"Move," he ordered Atticus, his grey eyes cold as a Manhattan winter.

Atticus stood his ground, though I could see his resolve wavering. This situation angers me even more - I refuse to be manipulated by weak or angry men.

"I don't need your damn oversight!" I snapped, my terminal confidence showing. "If I want out, I'll call my own car!"

He ignored me completely, shouldering past Atticus, who hesitated before stepping aside.

Something in me snapped. Without thinking, I bent down and bit his hand. I felt him tense, saw the muscle in his jaw work, but his grip remained venture-capital firm. I bit harder, tasting copper, refusing to yield until-

"Lucas..." A soft voice cut through the tension.

I released my grip, noting the blood on his cuff. Rachel stood there, her gown a perfect complement to her practiced society smile, though it couldn't hide the pain in her eyes. "The family council's looking for you. I didn't expect to find you here."

I watched Lucas's throat work beneath his tie, but he offered nothing.

I watched as Rachel's eyes welled with tears, yet her breeding held. "If you're busy, I can explain to your grandfather," she said, her voice trembling. "But could you... could you please come back afterward? There are other matters tonight..." Her request was so humble, so desperate.

Even I felt a pang of sympathy for her. She looked utterly miserable. But Lucas could be this cold-blooded.

So cold-blooded that he seemed completely unmoved by her grief. He merely tossed out a few icy words: "I know."

He held my hand to slip away. We had just passed Rachel when a sharp voice rang out. 

"Just where the hell do you think you're going?!"

The commanding tone made my blood run cold. I felt Lucas's hand tense around mine for a split second before he gripped it even tighter. I could see Howard Harrington being wheeled forward by the old butler, flanked by security in dark suits. His steely gaze locked first on Lucas, then dropped pointedly to our joined hands, his expression hardening.

"Damn it, Lucas, I've put up with enough tonight. Let her go. Now." Howard's voice carried that unmistakable authority that brooked no argument.

"I'm taking her home. I'll be back," Lucas stated firmly.

Howard's face reddened with fury. "Leaving a Thorne Foundation gala with Serena Sinclair? In front of the entire board? If she hadn't handled that auction situation earlier with such finesse, your little stunt tonight would've been all over media tomorrow! Lucas, I expected better from you."

I stood there, pulse racing, as Lucas shot back without hesitation: "Well, I guess expectations can't always be met."

That response hit like a thunderbolt. I watched Howard's complexion turn dangerously red, his breathing becoming labored. The butler stepped forward urgently. "Sir, your blood pressure. Dr. Morrison was very clear about the risk of another stroke. Please try to stay calm..."

I noticed Lucas's stance soften slightly, but his grip on my hand remained steady.

Butler turned to Lucas, his voice low and urgent: "Mr. Harrington, please. You know how fragile your grandfather's health. If something were to happen..."

"This won't take long," Lucas replied tersely.

Suddenly, Howard's voice rose sharply: "For God's sake, Lucas! Do you want to watch me die right here? Like you watched your parents' car go off that bridge? Is that what you want - to stand by while another family member dies?!"

Lucas was visibly struggling now, his color distressing. The weight of the moment crushed my chest as I made my decision, memories of my own mother's hospital room flashing through my mind. Lucas's tight grip on my hand slowly loosened. I pulled my hand free from his grip. I couldn't bear to be responsible for another family tragedy.

"I won't have a stroke on my conscience," I said coldly, even as my heart hammered against my ribs. I heard Lucas's knuckles crack as his fists clenched.

Without meeting his eyes, I turned to Atticus. "Would you mind calling my driver?"

When Atticus nodded, I knew I'd made the right call. I still wasn't sure why Lucas had been so desperate to get me away from the gala. But whatever the reason, I refused to be the cause of more family drama. There was no reason to stay.

As Atticus walked me toward the exit, I heard Howard's sharp command behind us: "Get back in there with Rachel. The entire board is waiting!"
###chapter 225
Serena's POV

I walked with Atticus toward the exit, trying not to show how relieved I was that my ankle felt better. Lucas might be infuriating sometimes, but I had to admit his impromptu physical therapy had worked - the sharp pain had dulled to a manageable ache.

"Look who's taking doctor's orders for once," Atticus said with that trademark smirk. He was referring to my surprisingly cooperative response to Lucas's *medical advice*, but it wasn't about following orders. I just knew when it was time to make a strategic retreat.

We'd made it halfway across the hall when one of the event coordinators intercepted us, tablet in hand. "Sir? Sorry to interrupt, but Mr. Thorne asking for you in the VIP lounge. Says it's urgent."

*Clarence Thorne.* I caught the slight tightening around Atticus's eyes.

"I can handle getting out of here," I said, keeping my voice casual. "Just have driver bring the car around."

He hesitated for a split second. "You sure?"

"Of course."

"I'll text driver to meet you out front," he said, already pulling out his phone. "Watch your step in those Louboutins."

"Always do."

As Atticus headed for the VIP section, I made my way to the entrance. But before I could reach the revolving doors, two security guards in tailored suits stepped forward.

"I apologize, Miss, but we have strict instructions. No guests are to leave until the conclusion of the evening's program."

I arched an eyebrow. I'd never encountered this kind of lockdown. Even for the Thornes, this was pushing it.

"All guests must remain until the formal closing," the guard continued smoothly. "House rules."

"Since when?" I kept my tone professionally neutral, though my patience was wearing thin.

"Tonight's announcements include market-sensitive information. Standard protocol requires all attendees remain present until the embargo lifts."

His corporate-speak didn't tell me whether this was legitimate or not. What it did tell me was that without Atticus's direct intervention, I was stuck here.

I retreated to the ballroom, where the charity auction was still going strong. Finding a quiet spot near a sculpture, I texted Atticus: "Security's got the place locked down. No early exits allowed."

Ten minutes and three ignored champagne trays later, he responded: "Give me 15."

"Copy that."

I settled in for the wait, maintaining my carefully cultivated expression of polite interest while watching the auction. 

On stage, the auctioneer is showcasing a medieval ruby ring, his polished accent emphasizing its provenance and investment potential. The bidding starts rapid-fire, paddles rising across the room.

"Three hundred thousand."

"Three twenty-five."

"Three fifty."

"Half a million."

"Six hundred."

"Six twenty-five."

The elite's finest are out in force tonight, their competitive spirit rising with each bid.

"Eight hundred thousand!" 

I don't need to look to recognize Lucas's voice cutting through the crowd.

"One million."

"One point two."

"One point three."

"One point five million," Lucas states with characteristic finality.

The room breaks into hushed murmurs. Even in Portland, where billion-dollar deals happen daily, no one wants to antagonize Lucas Harrington over a piece of jewelry. His reputation ensures that.

"One point five million going once!"

"Going twice!"

"Sold to Mr. Harrington! Please come forward to claim your winning piece."

I watch Lucas stride to the stage, his tuxedo impeccable as always. He accepts the ring with his usual grace, but before he can step away, the auctioneer clears his throat.

"Just a moment, Mr. Harrington." His eyes sparkle with rehearsed excitement. "I believe we have a special moment planned with Miss Thorne?"

Lucas's gaze finds Rachel in the crowd, her crimson gown catching the light. Her expression is pure anticipation.

I take another sip of champagne. *A proposal must be coming.* I thought with a wry smile.

"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Miss Rachel Thorne to the stage." The auctioneer smoothly covers Lucas's silence.

Rachel ascends the stage with practiced poise and her captivating smile. "Don't keep us in suspense, Lucas," she says, her voice carrying just the right note of affectionate teasing.

Unconsciously, my nails press slightly harder against the crystal stem of my glass. Anxiety creeps in as my heart plummets.

But Lucas remains still, silent.

The uncomfortable pause stretches. I catch snippets of whispers from nearby socialites. Rachel's media-trained smile begins to waver.

"Lucas?" Her voice carries a hint of concern now, reminding him of their audience and the headlines that would follow any public rejection.

He finally seems to snap back to the present, turning to face her as he holds out the ring.

"Rachel..."

Rachel's eyes shimmer with tears - the perfect photo op for tomorrow's social columns.

"I..." Lucas starts, then falls into another lengthy silence.

"Yes." Rachel steps forward to embrace him, her movements graceful despite their suddenness. "We've known each other since high school and Harvard. All those summers in Edinburgh, winter breaks in London... Being together just makes sense. You don't need to say anything else. This is exactly what everyone's been hoping for."

I have to admire her crisis management skills. She's reframed his hesitation as emotional overwhelm, turning an awkward moment into romantic nostalgia. 

Applause erupts as rose petals drift down from the ornate ceiling. It's strange - I was initially afraid of facing this situation, but now that I'm here, I feel surprisingly calm, just like any other day.

After their embrace, Lucas slides the ring onto Rachel's finger and addresses the crowd, "We'll be married on Valentine's Day at St. Patrick's Cathedral. You're all invited to celebrate with us."

The room explodes in congratulations, glasses raised in celebration.

Atticus appears suddenly at my elbow, blocking my view of the stage. "I'm sorry you had to witness that proposal, Serena."
###chapter 226
Serena's POV

I felt my eyes begin to sting, and a single tear slipped down my cheek. Somehow, I found myself smiling through it - a bittersweet mix of relief and heartache that felt uniquely fitting for the moment.

Atticus gently touched my elbow, smoothly guiding me toward the exit. The security team, despite their strict instructions about the gala's end time, merely nodded respectfully.

In the back of his Bentley, heading for airport, we sat in silence. I could feel Atticus watching me, probably noting how the vulnerability I'd shown in the ballroom had been replaced by my usual composure.

"Don't you want to know what went down with Rachel's grandfather?" His casual tone didn't quite mask his concern. 

"Please," I gave him a knowing look. "It's not exactly rocket science."

"Enlighten me," he said, his lips quirking into that familiar half-smile.

I ticked off the points on my fingers: "One, he tried to pump you for information about your grandfather's condition and the family trust."

His raised eyebrow confirmed it.

"Two, he not-so-subtly suggested what a perfect power couple we'd make, conveniently blocking any chance of a Sinclair-Harrington merger."

"Got it in one," he admitted.

"And three," I paused, this realization still stinging, "he made sure we stayed just long enough to catch the Lucas and Rachel show." The Thornes hadn't pulled strings to get me into the Gala just to let me skip the main event.

"Christ, Serena," Atticus shook his head. "Sometimes that brilliant mind of yours must be exhausting. What if you'd just... I don't know, gone with your gut for once? Walked right up to Lucas, consequences be damned?"

I let out a short laugh. "This isn't a movie or webnovel, Atticus." Better to keep things professional, maintain the peace. Sometimes winning meant walking away.

The calm was shattered by a sudden swerve that had us both grabbing for the handles.

"Brooks?" Atticus called to the driver.

"Three SUVs, sir. They've been tailing us since we leave."

We turned to look - three black Escalades with high beams blazing were closing in fast.

"Get us out of here," Atticus ordered, his voice sharp.

"Yes, sir."

The Bentley surged forward, throwing us back against the leather seats. The streets were eerily quiet at this hour. The sudden roar of high-performance engines shattered that silence, echoing between the steel and glass canyons.

I watched as Atticus struggled with his phone, his usually steady hands-now trembling over the screen. For a man who'd weathered many storms in his life, his obvious distress sent warning bells ringing in my head.

"Can you handle this?" he asked, his polish cracking under pressure.

I took his phone without hesitation, though our driver's evasive maneuvers made even that simple task a challenge. My fingers brushed his hand-it was burning hot.

"Who's the contact?" I asked, trying my best to keep my voice calm.

"Get Wilson," he replied tersely.

I was scrolling through his contacts when the driver executed a sudden defensive driving maneuver that sent the phone flying. It disappeared somewhere under the custom leather seats.

"Brace yourselves!" the driver barked. Through the bulletproof glass, I caught sight of what had triggered his reaction-a matte black Escalade had come barreling through the intersection.

I unclipped my seatbelt and dove for the phone, fighting against the G-forces as we took corners. Just as my fingers closed around the device, we hit another sudden brake. The impact with the console made my head feel like it had been split open with a sledgehammer.

"Serena!" Atticus's voice cut through my disorientation, his grip on my arm steadying. He sounded more like a genuinely concerned human being.

Fighting back the wave of dizziness, I managed to dial Wilson and hit speaker. Atticus's voice filled the cabin: "Wilson, we've got a situation. Need immediate extraction. Track my location. Now."

"Copy that, Mr. Thorne. Activating Protocol Echo," came the efficient response.

"Share our live location through Signal. Wilson's team will intercept within minutes." He turned to me and controlled his breathing. 

I nodded, wrestling with the phone while Atticus secured my seatbelt. I sent the location and confirmed with a quick, "Done."

When the driver reported we were being forced toward Lloyd District, I saw Atticus's expression darken. He tore a strip from his shirt and handed it to me. "For your head," he said quietly.

Only then did I notice the warm trickle of blood from where I'd hit the console. I felt the warm blood on my forehead, and an icy chill crept down my spine. Everything had happened in a blur - too fast to process. Only now did the horrifying truth sink in: this time was different from all the others. They weren't here to threaten or intimidate - they were here to kill us. A wave of primal fear surged through my body, bile rising in my throat. 

But I forced it down. I couldn't afford to fall apart. Not now. Not when survival was the only thing that mattered. I had to live through this! I pressed the impromptu bandage to my forehead, muttering a thanks.

"This is on me," he said, regret coloring his words. "They're targeting me. You shouldn't be caught in this crossfire."

I shook my head, recognizing the bitter irony. "Maybe they're primarily after you, but I was already on their radar."
###chapter 227
Serena's POV

I feel another violent jolt as our car lurches to the side.

None of us can speak anymore - we're all too focused on survival. Through the window, I can barely make out where we are. The Portland skyline has disappeared as we've been forced onto the mountain way. Everything beyond our headlights is pitch black.

Brooks has no choice but to keep pushing forward, not daring to slow down for even a second. The black SUV behind us is relentless - any decrease in speed would mean instant collision. And at these speeds, that would be fatal.

The silence in our car is suffocating. We can only pray that the Wilson's unit arrives in time. Otherwise...

Suddenly, my blood runs cold. I notice Atticus and Brooks's expressions mirror my horror.

A massive eighteen-wheeler appears out of nowhere, its high beams blazing directly into our eyes. Brooks is instantly blinded, his vision flooded with white light. He jerks the wheel, and our car slams into the concrete barrier. The truck roars past us, missing us by inches.

But we have no time for relief. The pursuing vehicles are closing in fast. Brooks barely starts to reverse when I hear it - the sickening crunch of metal on metal as the first SUV rams into us.

I grip the overhead handle, the seatbelt cutting into my chest as I struggle to breathe. The assault doesn't stop - three more vehicles take turns battering our car. The frame of our car is buckling around us. A few more hits like this and we'll be crushed.

"Take it down the embankment!" Atticus snarled.

Brooks's shock is evident in his voice: "Jesus Christ, sir - that drop by the Palisades - we don't know how steep it is or what's at the bottom..."

"Better odds than being crushed to death here!" Atticus snaps with grim certainty.

Brooks mutters "God help us" under his breath and complies. He floors the accelerator, and I watch the digital speedometer climb higher and higher...

Just before we crash through the barrier, I hear Atticus's voice close to my ear: "Serena, it's in God's hands now."

God's hands? The words echo in my mind. Yes, that's all we have left.

The Bentley bursts through the barrier and begins its deadly tumble down the rocky slope toward the bottom. My body feels like it's being torn apart by the violence of the roll. Safety glass explodes around us as we spin again and again, falling into the darkness with no end in sight...





Rachel's POV

I noticed my brother Garrett answer his phone. A subtle smile crossed his face as he bent down to whisper something to grandfather, who sat at our family's reserved table.

Grandfather maintained his cold expression, though I caught the slight glint in his eyes. His ring glinted as he gave a nearly imperceptible nod. Garrett responded with a curt "Done" into his phone before ending the call.

When he turned, our eyes met across the room. His expression confirmed what I already knew - our plan had worked. The black Bentley had gone off the mountain road, exactly as intended.

I scanned the crowded hall for Lucas. He'd excused himself right after we'd announced our engagement. Some socialites had swarmed us with congratulations then, preventing me from following. But he should have returned by now.

A wave of panic hit me. Forgetting my poise, I rushed toward the executive restroom. I had to find him. But the attendant confirmed he wasn't there. He wasn't anywhere. The worst-case scenario crossed my mind.

I hurried back through the hall, my heels clicking against the marble floor. Garrett, noticing my uncharacteristic behavior, smoothly guided me into one of the private donor lounges.

"Pull yourself together," he warned in a low voice. "The media is still here."

"Garrett, Lucas is gone," I fought to keep my voice steady.

My brother straightened his tie. "Are you certain?"

"He's not in the executive washroom. He's not anywhere in the wing." My words rushed out.

"The place is enormous, perhaps-"

"Garrett." I cut him off, my voice rised.

"Take a breath," he advised, already texting our private security team and calling the surveillance room.

The report came back quickly - Lucas had slipped out through the staff entrance twenty minutes ago. My stomach dropped. Was he headed to the airport? No, he couldn't find them!

"Are you absolutely certain about Atticus and Serena?" I forced myself to sound controlled.

"The car went off that mountain road at high speed. With those cliffs..." Garrett let the implication hang.

"I need confirmation!" My voice rose despite the thick walls. "We need proof! What if the -"

"Atticus's security team will handle the scene," Garrett cut in smoothly. "We've orchestrated everything perfectly. Even if by some miracle they survived, they won't be able to come after us. If our people are spotted at the scene now, they could turn the tables and pin the blame on us. We can't risk that exposure."

"I can't risk Serena surviving this!" All my breeding had evaporated.

"Lucas won't change anything," Garrett reminded me. "Think about it - with his position now, his family's banking interests... He can't afford a scandal with the Thornes. Not now." He adjusted his cufflinks. "And don't forget our insurance policy."

His words finally began to pierce my panic. Yes, even if Lucas made it to the scene, all he'd find would be wreckage on the rocks. The thought calmed me, though I knew it probably shouldn't.
###chapter 228
Lucas's POV

I bolted from the grand ballroom, my footsteps echoing across the floor. The valet had my car waiting. Every red light felt like an eternity as I kept hitting Serena's number. Straight to voicemail. Every. Single. Time.

PDX. She had to be heading to PDX airport. I pressed harder on the accelerator, weaving through the late-night traffic.

That's when I heard it - the unmistakable sound of metal crushing metal somewhere ahead. I cut off my latest attempt to reach her and accelerated toward the sound. Through the traffic, I spotted Atticus's black Bentley being pursued by several dark vehicles.

Even with the car's engine roaring, I couldn't close the gap. They were heading toward the cliffs, taking the winding roads at dangerous speeds. My hands gripped the steering wheel so tight my knuckles went white.

Another crash echoed through the night. Damn it - I couldn't see past the three cars between us. The sounds of impact kept coming, each one making my chest tighter.

When I finally got a clear view, my world stopped. Atticus's car smashed through the guardrail, plummeting into the darkness below.

"NO!" I was howling with heartbreaking anguish.

The pursuing vehicles - black Escalades, I realized now - peeled away, their tires screeching as they disappeared into the night. The silence that followed was deafening. No more crashes. No engines. No sirens yet. Nothing.

I slammed on the brakes, leaving my car askew across the lanes. I didn't even bother closing the door as I ran to the edge. The rocky slope was treacherous - my shoes slipped, and I went tumbling down after them.

My shoulder slammed into a boulder, sending shooting pain through my arm. Probably dislocated, but I couldn't care less. I stumbled to my feet, my vision swimming. The world spun, but I forced myself forward. My suit was shredded, my hands bloody from catching myself on rocks, but none of it mattered.

I lost my footing countless times on the treacherous slope before I finally reached the wreck. The Mercedes was barely recognizable. The darkness was absolute, but my phone's flashlight cut through it. For a moment, my finger hovered over the button. What would I see?

Fighting back tears, I switched it on. The beam revealed Atticus and Serena, pinned in the crushed cabin. Blood streaked their faces, and the deployed airbags obscured most of their bodies. Internal injuries could be...

"Serena."

I kept my voice soft, though everything in me wanted to scream. God, just let her open her eyes. She could hate me - should hate me - but please, just let her be alive.

"Serena..." My voice cracked. "Come on, sweetheart, give me something. Anything."

That's when Atticus stirred, his forehead creasing. His eyes fluttered against the light. Between the darkness and probable concussion, he shouldn't have been able to recognize me, but something - maybe my shaking voice - gave me away.

"Lucas?" The name came out as barely a whisper, nearly lost in the sound of distant traffic from the highway above.




Serena's POV

"Serena!" Atticus's voice cut through the haze.

I felt suspended in a surreal moment, as if watching myself from outside my own body. The luxury car interior - which had felt so familiar just moments ago - now seemed alien and distorted.

Reality slammed back with brutal force. Pain radiated through my body, and I forced my eyes open against the glare of emergency lights that had automatically activated. My watch had shattered, its face reflecting fractured beams across the crumpled dashboard.

"How are you holding up?" Atticus asked, his voice tight with strain.

I tried to speak, my throat raw. "I'm okay," I managed. "You?"

"I'm fine," Atticus replied, then added meaningfully, "Lucas is here." His eyes flickered toward approaching flashlight beams.

I glanced in that direction. I was stunned to see Lucas here. After everything we'd been through, I never expected he would be the one to come to our rescue. All the bitterness I'd harbored towards him seemed to melt away in that moment.

"I'm getting you both out." Lucas's voice carried that familiar authority and a hint of tremble.

Lucas placed his phone on a stable surface, its flashlight providing additional illumination as he assessed the mangled door. Despite his considerable strength, the crushed metal wouldn't yield. Even in my dazed state, I noticed his suit was already discarded, his shirt sleeves rolled up to expose muscled forearms.

"Cover your faces. I'm breaking the glass." His words were precise, measured. The laminated safety glass was already compromised, but not enough to allow escape.

Atticus and I ducked down. Through my blurred vision, I watched Lucas methodically clear the remaining glass. Blood began seeping through his white shirt sleeve, but his breathing remained steady, controlled. A bittersweet ache bloomed in my chest, tears threatening to spill. My past behavior collided with overwhelming gratitude, creating a storm of emotions I could barely contain.

"Your hand, Serena." His command snapped me back to reality. I struggled to move past the deployed airbag, my gown catching on twisted metal. When our hands met, they were slick with what could have been either of our blood.

"The seatbelt," I gasped, recognizing the leather was jammed in its mechanism.

Lucas immediately maneuvered into the car beside me, his presence filling the confined space. He worked to free the seatbelt, his watch scraping against metal as he maneuvered in the tight space.

"You smell that?" Atticus's voice took on a new urgency.

I inhaled carefully, my eyes meeting his across the crushed center console. "Gas!" we shouted simultaneously.

The implications were immediate - ruptured fuel tank, the vehicle crashed off the road, electrical systems still active. I saw the same rapid assessment cross Lucas's face as he intensified his efforts on the seatbelt. The mechanism finally gave way with a sharp crack that sent him back against the door frame, but he recovered instantly.

Lucas held me tightly as he tried to pull me out. I clenched my jaw, but my body trembled from the pain.

Something was pinning down my right leg. Every time Lucas tried to pull, the pain intensified, sending sharp waves through my body.

I could tell Lucas was being careful - he was afraid of causing more damage if he used too much force. The last thing either of us wanted was for my injuries to become worse.

"Where are you stuck?" Lucas asked, his voice low and deep.

We were pressed so close together that I could feel his labored breathing and his racing heartbeat against my chest. There was no hiding his anxiety - it was raw and unmasked in that moment.

"Right side," I managed to say through gritted teeth. "Lower leg."
###chapter 229
Serena's POV

My leg was trapped under the collapsed front seat where Brooks, our unconscious driver, was still strapped in. Lucas crouched down to examine my leg.

I watched as he roughly shook Brooks - the aggressive motion a complete contrast to his gentle treatment of me moments before.

"Wake up!" Lucas called out sharply.

The unconscious driver finally stirred, immediately switching to alert mode despite his obvious pain. "Mr. Thorne, sir?"

"I'm alright," Atticus responded.

I noticed Brooks didn't relax - his security training kicking in as he automatically reached for his seatbelt release, which was stuck. Lucas had no time to worry about the driver's situation.

I knew Brooks wasn't just a regular driver. The Thorne family's security team was top-tier - their drivers went through more intensive training than standard security personnel since they were the first line of defense during transport.

"You need to lift yourself up now - her leg is pinned under your seat," Lucas ordered tersely.

"Yes, sir," Brooks responded, his professionalism showing through the pain.

I watched as he took a controlled breath, assessed his injuries with practiced precision, and used all his strength to lift himself slightly. Lucas immediately crouched back beside me, straining to raise the heavy seat.

His voice was tight with effort. "Pull your foot out..."

I tried, but my leg had gone completely numb. A wave of panic hit me - was my leg even still there? The thought made me break into a cold sweat, mixing with the sharp pain from my other injuries, making everything worse.

"We need to move fast..." Lucas urged.

I knew he'd been working non-stop on rescue efforts all night, his strength nearly gone. And Brooks, injured from the crash, couldn't hold his position much longer. If he collapsed, my leg would be crushed again. Worse still, fuel was leaking from the engine - we had seconds before a potential explosion.

I tried to reach down to help lift my leg, but the deployed airbags had me pinned back.

"Focus, Serena," Atticus said firmly. I could tell he was fighting through his own injuries, forcing himself to stay alert. We all had to stay alert.

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. All I could hear was Lucas's labored breathing as he strained to hold up the seat. I forced myself to calm down, searching for any feeling in my leg.

Inch by inch... I finally felt it move slightly.

Gritting my teeth, I yanked my leg free. In that same moment, there was a heavy thud as the seat dropped back down, followed by Brooks's exhausted gasp.

My heart was pounding. A split second later, and my leg would have been crushed again beneath the weight of both the seat and Brooks. I shuddered to think what would have happened to my leg in that case.

When I thought we were safe, I saw something that made my heart race: Lucas's hands were pinned under the seat. In the darkness, I couldn't make out his expression.

"Lucas!" I snarled.

I couldn't tell if his hands were pinned because he didn't have enough strength to move them in time. My vision had become blurred with tears, making it even harder to see.

He endured the excruciating pain without making a sound. He summoned all his strength and, together with the driver still strapped in his seat, managed to lift the seat again. In the next moment, he pulled his hands free.

I'm sobbing uncontrollably, my heart pounding in my chest. I can't bear to think about how devastating it would be for Lucas if he lost his hands because of me.

He didn't even glance at his bloodied hands, let alone check his injuries. He immediately reached for me again. As he held me against his chest, I could smell his sweat mixed with the sharp metallic scent of blood.

Lucas used slightly more force to pull me completely free from the airbag. He climbed out through the window first, then reached back in to carefully lift me out, making sure I wouldn't get cut by the shattered glass.

With my arms around his neck, I was finally out of the car. He carried me a safe distance away and gently set me down on the ground, crouching to check me for injuries that might need urgent attention...

"Atticus... Atticus is still inside..." I reminded him.

I saw his hands tense as he was examining me.

"We should save him." I suggested.

I watched him swallow hard, hesitated for a moment and walked back toward the car. He crouched down and used his phone's flashlight to check underneath the vehicle, where thin wisps of smoke were already rising. He didn't hesitate for a second before turning back. 

"What about Atticus?"

"The car's about to catch fire," he said, lifting me from the ground and quickly moving us even further away. "If we stay any longer, we'll all die."

"Lucas!" I stared at him in disbelief, watching as he deliberately abandoned not one but two lives - Atticus and Brooks.

"I'm not that noble," he said coldly, carrying me away with increasing speed. "All I care about is that you and I survive. Everyone else doesn't matter."

"Put me down!" I demanded.

His arms only tightened around me.

"Lucas Harrington, I said put me down! If you won't save them, I will!" I snapped. I couldn't be this callous - I couldn't bring myself to be as ruthless as Lucas!

Atticus can't die - he's my only ally against Rachel. If he's gone, she'll be even more ruthless with me, and I'll be as good as dead.
###chapter 230
Serena's POV

"Let me go!" I screamed at Lucas, my voice echoing through the darkness. We stood on the rain-slicked hillside, the distant lights of downtown Portland twinkling below us like fallen stars.

"Damn it, Serena, you're not thinking straight-" He cut off with a sharp hiss as I sank my teeth into his shoulder. Even through his torn dress shirt, I bit hard enough to make him flinch, but his grip never loosened. I twisted in his arms like a wild thing, desperate to break free.

The steep road was bad enough in good weather. In our struggle, we both went down, and Lucas took the fall, making sure I landed on top of him instead of the rough land. The second his arms loosened, I scrambled up and bolted toward the smoking car, my heels long since abandoned somewhere in the chaos.

Each step sent lightning bolts of pain through my injured leg, but I forced myself forward.

"For God's sake, Serena!" 

Lucas caught me, his hands like steel bands around my arms. We were both already a mess of scrapes and blood. I glared into his storm-gray eyes, watching his jaw work as he fought to keep his legendary temper in check. "I will not," I gritted out, "stand here and watch someone die. Not happening."

"Even if it gets you killed?" His voice was rough with fear and fury.

"Even if we both go down. I'll never be able to live with myself if we don't try!"

I yanked free. My mind was made up-to hell with anyone trying to stop me. I took another step toward the wreck, only to feel his grip again.

"Jesus Christ, Lucas, don't make me hate you more than I already do!" I yelled.

"I'll do it," he said abruptly.

My heart stuttered. I didn't expect him to agree so quickly.

"I'll get Atticus out. You stay put," his voice dropped to that quiet tone that made board members tremble. "That's not a request, Serena."

He turned and ran toward the wreck, his tall frame cutting through the darkness and smoke. Watching him walk away, my irritation faded, replaced by waves of worry that hung over my heart like storm clouds. I bit my lip until I tasted blood.

I did what I always do when Lucas Harrington tries to give me orders. I ignored him and followed.

I followed Lucas toward a nightmare scene: Atticus and Brooks were trapped in what was left of the black sedan. Blood and car wreckage were everywhere.

Atticus managed to stay composed: "The belt's locked up tight, and this door's got me pinned on my right side. Can't move an inch."

I watched as Lucas and Atticus locked eyes. Lucas dove into the car, and I held my breath as he wrestled with the seatbelt until the buckle finally snapped under his strength.

The door panel was the next challenge. It had Atticus trapped like a vice, the whole frame crushed inward. If it wasn't for those airbags... God, I couldn't even think about it.

"Can you get him out?" I called from outside, my hands shaking.

Lucas's head snapped up. "What the hell are you doing here?!" His face was thunderous, but his hands kept working methodically. I knew he will have this attitude, but I had made up my mind to help together.

"Let me help," I stepped forward.

"Back off, Serena. Now!" The edge in his voice could cut steel.

"Lucas, please-"

"Get out of here, Sinclair." Atticus cut in, his voice strained but still trying for lightness. "Pretty sure my insurance doesn't cover stubborn witnesses."

I backed up two steps, my heart racing. I was intimidated by their sudden intensity. Fearing that approaching them would only escalate the situation, I backed away as they wanted.

Then I saw it - that first flicker under the chassis. My whole body went cold.

The flame was tiny at first, just a flicker beneath the crushed metal. My mind screamed denial even as I kicked off my shoes, ready to do... something, anything.

No. Please, no.

But that tiny flame exploded into an inferno before I could move. The heat hit us in a wave, and I saw the moment all three men felt it too. Flames started licking up the side of the car.
"Serena!"

Lucas was still working, his movements careful and precise as he fought with the crushed door. One wrong move could tear Atticus apart - but now they were running out of time.

"I can find a fire extinguisher!" The words tumbled out of my mouth.

"It's too late! Get back!"

"There has to be something-" My voice cracked. How could I just watch this happen?

"MOVE!" Lucas roared, his eyes meeting mine with steel-cold determination. "I swear to God, Serena, if you don't get clear right now, I'm done trying to save him."

Deep down I knew Lucas was just trying to protect me from danger. But he went to save Atticus because of what I said - if they both died in that fire, I couldn't live with that regret. I desperately wanted to help, but his words left me paralyzed with indecision. I was pacing anxiously, the internal struggle was torture.

"Fine, I'm backing off-just move!" I shot back quickly. I was lying through my teeth. No way was I going to stand by while that car became a death trap. If those flames spread any further, they'd all be dead.

I went around a corner and yanked off my gown without a second thought. But before I could make my move, Lucas emerged from the car. I jumped in surprise and was about to ask him what he was doing here.

He grabbed my arm, his grip leaving no room for discussion. He practically dragged me backward across the rough land.

"Lucas, damn it, let go... we can still help them... there's time!" I fought against him, my voice breaking. I couldn't just watch them burn alive, not when I could do something.

Lucas acted like he couldn't hear a word. He pulled me to what he deemed a safe distance, then gripped my shoulders, his eyes locking onto my tear-stained, bruised face. "I'll get him out. Don't you dare move from this spot!"

He sprinted back toward the blazing vehicle. Watching his silhouette against the flames, I flashed back to that disaster of an engagement party with Ian, when Lucas had charged through the chaos to reach me.

It was Lucas... it had always been Lucas.

Except now he was running away from me, straight into hell.

My hand hung in the air, catching nothing but the ghost of his shirt sleeve. The scream building in my throat-begging him not to go-died before it could escape...
###chapter 231
Lucas's POV

I was back at the burning car. The look on Atticus's face said it all - he thought I was crazy to risk my life like this.

Sure, we weren't exactly buddies. But I had to come back-for Serena.

"Man, are you trying to get yourself killed?" he coughed out.

I didn't answer. The fire was getting worse by the second, and the heat inside the car was becoming unbearable. All my focus was on trying to budge this damn door that had him pinned.

"If you die playing hero for her, she'll never forget it," he said.

Between ragged breaths, I shot back. "This isn't about being remembered. I just can't let her go through that pain." I paused, then got straight to the point, "Look, no time to check for injuries. I'm going to force this door open, or we're both done for."

"Got it." Short and simple. We both knew our options had run out.

Brooks, the driver, seemed his injuries weren't too serious, and he wasn't pinned by the wreckage. I managed to pry the car seat open a bit, and after some struggling, he was able to free himself. From what I could see, he only had severe scrapes on his head and hands.

"Help me pull this door from the other side!" I ordered him.

"On it!" Brooks scrambled around to Atticus's door.

The flames were getting vicious. I saw Brooks's jacket catch fire. He slapped out the sparks and yelled, "We've got maybe a minute before this whole thing goes up!"

"Get a good grip on that frame and pull when I say!" I shouted. "We do this together!"

"Ready!" Brooks grabbed the frame, bracing himself.

I got into position, lining up my kick.

"Three, two, one - NOW!" 

I watched Brooks strain against the metal as I slammed my foot into the door panel. The whole car shuddered, but that door wouldn't give - Atticus was still trapped.

"Keep pulling!" I yelled to Brooks. "Don't stop until I say!"

"You got it!"

I kept hammering that door with everything I had, kick after kick. The air was heavy with the stench of gasoline and burning fabric. Sweat trickled down my forehead, cutting through the blood stains. Between my pain and the suffocating heat, every part of me wanted to give up.

A dull explosion jolted me back to reality as the flames surged higher. 

Was this how it would end?


Serena's POV

I stood frozen, the searing flames forcing me to shield my eyes.

The burning sedan rocked violently, but no one came out. My heart pounded against my ribs. God, please. Why weren't they getting out... why...

This was my fault. I was the one who begged Lucas to go back for Atticus. I was the one who made him risk everything to save someone else. If this was how it ended, I'd rather go down with him...

I lurched forward, the gas tank blew. The blast threw me backwards onto the ground, the heat wave slamming into me like a wall.

"LUCAS!" The scream tore from my throat.

Through the thick black smoke billowing into the night sky, my whole body shook. This couldn't be happening. Not like this...

I tried to push myself up, but my legs gave out. I hit the ground again, my palms scraping against the rough pavement. I had to get to Lucas, had to find him... I started crawling forward, my chest so tight I could barely draw breath through the smoke and panic.

Then I saw them through the flames - dark figures bursting through the wall of fire, staggering toward me. Their clothes were burning, but they were moving. 

They were alive. Lucas was alive! The emotional rollercoaster left me breathless. Tears of joy streamed down my face as relief flooded through me - the pure happiness of having back what I thought I'd lost.

They made it about twenty feet before dropping and rolling, trying to smother the flames. Pure instinct took over - I threw myself on top of Lucas, using my body and what was left of my evening gown to beat out the fire that was eating away at his clothes.

When the last flame died, we lay there on the cold ground, gulping in the sharp winter air, the burning wreck still popping and crackling behind us.

Lucas struggled to his knees. He swayed but caught himself, then shrugged out of the remains of his charred suit jacket. Without a word, he wrapped it around my bare shoulders - I'd torn off my gown to help put out the flames, leaving me exposed in the freezing night air. His hands lingered for just a moment as he tucked the ruined jacket around me.

I couldn't take my eyes off his face. Though he'd made it out, the burns looked worse than the others. The right side of his face was already starting to blister. Seeing my tears, he managed a weak smile despite his exhaustion. The sight of him pushing himself like that made my heart ache even more. I couldn't hold back - I pulled him close, burying my face in his shoulder.


"I can't... I can't feel my legs..." Atticus's voice, barely a rasp in the darkness.
###chapter 232
Serena's POV

"Jesus Christ," Lucas muttered, whipping around to examine Atticus. His polish had given way to raw concern. "Internal bleeding?"

"No... it's not..." Atticus could barely form words between his labored breaths. I watched his knuckles turn white as he gripped the branch, his suit now streaked with blood and dirt.

Lucas's face darkened as he approached Atticus. I could see the sweat beading on Atticus's forehead, his breathing becoming more erratic by the second. Lucas reached out to check his temperature.

"It started right before impact," I said quietly, recognition hitting me like a punch to the gut. "It's drugs."

The signs were unmistakable. Once these episodes began, they spiraled out of control, each wave worse than the last. Fighting through my own pain - pretty sure I had at least one cracked rib - I moved toward Atticus to assess how bad things had gotten.

Lucas's arm shot out like a steel bar across my chest, pulling me roughly against him. His eyes never left Atticus, who was now doubled over, every muscle in his body visibly straining against whatever was tearing him apart from the inside.

"Lucas, let me go," I struggled against his grip, but he might as well have been carved from granite.

"Not happening, Serena," he growled into my ear, his voice carrying authority. "I don't give a damn if you never speak to me again, but I am not letting you handle whatever the hell is happening to him right now."

"Trust me," I shot back, still pushing against his arms, "I couldn't help him even if I wanted to."

"But you know someone who could," I added pointedly, feeling Lucas's body tense as my meaning sank in.

When I finally broke free from his grip, what I saw nearly stopped my heart. Blood was trickling from Atticus's nose, ears, and eyes - at first, I thought it was a trick of the shadows. I carefully held my hand near his face, feeling the warm, sticky liquid on my fingers. His stare sent chills down my spine as more blood seeped from his ears.

My stomach lurched as the pieces fell into place. The Thorne family's reach was longer and darker than I'd imagined. How much of that experimental compound had they forced into his system? The "car accident" was supposed to look like a tragic mishap, but they'd had a backup plan all along.

"Holy shit, what's happening to him?" Brooks, had backed away, his face pale in the moonlight.

Lucas's response was pure ice: "If we don't do something fast, he's not going to make it."

"Where the hell is his medical team?" I demanded, though I knew our phones were somewhere in the twisted metal behind us. 

I turned to Lucas desperately. "What are we going to do?"

His expression hardened. "Why are you looking at me like that?"

I bit my lip, considering and discarding options before turning to Brooks, studying his terrified face.

"You'd do anything for him, wouldn't you?" I asked.

"Mr. Thorne saved my family," Brooks answered without hesitation. "I'd take a bullet for him."

"That won't be necessary," I said, lowering my voice to whisper instructions in his ear. His eyes widened like I'd just suggested we rob the bank.

"Look," I pressed on, "either we do this, or he dies right here on this godforsaken wild. His medical team won't make it in time to save him, and we're running out of time."

The driver was visibly torn, wrestling with his decision.

"We'll head out now. Whatever comes next is in your hands," I said, stepping away to give them space.

I try to push myself up, my body betrays me, strength evaporating like morning dew. If it wasn't for pure adrenaline keeping me going through that nightmare, I would've blacked out hours ago.

I'm about to fall sideways, Lucas catches me despite his own injuries. I let myself sink into his embrace, feeling the solid warmth of his chest against my cheek. There's a metallic tang in the air - blood, though I can't tell if it's his or mine anymore.

"Easy there," he murmurs, his voice softened with concern. He lifts me as if I weigh nothing.

I'm not exactly unconscious, just bone-deep exhausted. Now the danger has passed, my body's shutting down hard. I wanted to walk on my own, and Lucas is hurt too. But I can't even keep my eyes open, let alone stand.

I drift in and out, cradled against his chest. Through the fog, I hear voices, radio chatter, and the thunderous approach of helicopter blades. Atticus's security team, finally showing up.

Everything goes dark.

When I surface again, I'm somewhere unfamiliar. Not my apartment, not Lucas's penthouse. I try to focus, but my head feels stuffed with cotton, like I've been under too long, like I've slept through an entire season.

"Welcome back," Lucas says, his voice in gentle tone.

I turn toward him, taking in his familiar features, now mapped with cuts and bruises. His usual polish is decidedly mussed, though somehow he still manages to look like a grace prince.

"Where..." my voice comes out like sandpaper on steel.

"Portland," he says, then adds with a slight smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes, "Maine, not Oregon. You're safe here."

I want to laugh at that. Safe in Thorne territory is relative, but I can barely lift my head, let alone argue politics.

"Let me help," he says, easing me up with the kind of careful precision. The room spins lazily as he arranges pillows behind me. That's when I notice the IV stand and medical equipment - someone's turned this luxury vacation home into a private hospital room.

"Water?" he offers, already reaching for a crystal tumbler.

"Yeah," I manage, my throat feeling like I've swallowed the Sahara.

Lucas pours filtered water with practiced ease. "Need help?"

"I got it," I insist, but when I try to lift my arm, it feels like it's made of lead. Even breathing seems like an Olympic event.

"Serena," he struggled to contain his excitement, his eyes twinkling with a gentle warmth, "you've been out for three days. The only thing keeping you going has been IV fluids and prayer. Let me help."

I stare at him, processing. "Three days?"

"Seventy-two hours and seventeen minutes," he confirms. "But you're awake now. That's what matters."

His voice stays steady, calibrated for maximum soothing effect. "Take it slow. Your body needs time to reboot. I'll have Walter bring up some homemade soup. His grandmother's recipe - the one thing from Connecticut he actually brags about."

With tender care, he held the cup to my lips, tilting it ever so gently. His cautious devotion touched me deeply, warming my heart.

"Lucas," I said softly, my voice still hoarse. Since regaining consciousness, a shadow has loomed over me. The numbness in my legs fills me with dread - I'm terrified of facing my worst fears, of what this might mean for my future.

"Hmm?"

"Did I keep all my limbs? Just checking."
###chapter 233
Serena's POV

It felt ridiculous asking, but his hovering had me worried. Lucas Harrington wasn't exactly known for playing nurse, even if he did have two kids.

A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth, and damn if it didn't make him look even more handsome, despite the butterfly stitches above his eyebrow. I quickly looked away.

"No amputations necessary," he said, his deep voice carrying that hint of dry humor. "Just a fractured tibia, some cuts and bruises, and enough blood loss to keep the trauma team busy for a while. But doctor says you'll make a full recovery."

My eyes drifted to his bandaged hands. "What about you?"

Though I wasn't seriously injured, I couldn't help but worry about his condition. While Lucas hadn't been in the car crash himself during my rescue, he had sustained several injuries. I noticed both his hands were wrapped in bandages, yet here he was, carefully helping me drink water.

"I'm fine," he responded in his characteristic understated manner, his deep voice carrying that quiet authority I'd grown familiar with.

I swallowed hard, feeling a wave of emotions threatening to overwhelm me. There were so many things I wanted to say, but I couldn't find the right words. My exhaustion didn't help-every part of my body felt heavy, drained of energy.

"Rest a bit more. I'll get you some soup," Lucas said, rising from his chair with a fluid grace that belied his injuries. He left the room with measured steps, his broad shoulders carrying a tension I hadn't noticed before.

Propped against the pillows, I took in the spacious room around me. I knew we were in Portland, but where exactly? Was this one of Lucas's private residences? If it was his place, would Rachel Thorne show up here? The thought made my stomach clench.

I pressed my lips together, my mind drifting to Atticus Thorne. How was he doing now? I didn't want him dead-not just because of the value of human life, but because Atticus could provide the protection I needed. In my ongoing conflict with Rachel, he was my strongest ally.

After letting my thoughts wander, I instinctively reached for my phone, only to remember it had been destroyed in the crash. The memory of flames licking at the wreckage flashed through my mind.

I let out a quiet sigh just as the door opened. Lucas returned with a bowl of soup, his movements careful and deliberate. He must have had it prepared, anticipating when I'd wake up. The realization stirred something in my chest, but I kept my expression neutral.

"The doctor recommended something light but with enough salt to help restore your strength," he explained, settling into the chair beside my bed. "It's a vegetable soup-simple, but it should help." With his bandaged hands, he carefully scooped up some soup, gently blew on it to cool it down, and brought it to my lips.

I glanced at the spoonful of clear broth with tender vegetables floating in it. The moment I tasted it, something shifted. The subtle seasoning awakened my appetite, and soon I was eagerly accepting each spoonful he offered. Before I knew it, the bowl was empty, and I found myself wanting more.

"Would you like another serving?" he asked, noticing my lingering gaze on the empty bowl.

"Yes," I admitted, feeling slightly embarrassed by my eagerness.

"The doctor advised smaller, frequent meals for now," he said, his tone gentle but firm. "Your system needs time to adjust."

I shot him a look-was he really going to tease me like this?

A hint of a smile played at the corners of his mouth as he reached out and smoothed my hair with his hand. "Be patient," he said softly. "You can have more in a little while."

I turned away, pretending to be annoyed, but feeling a warmth spread through my chest at his touch. He gathered the dishes and left the room, returning moments later empty-handed.

The space around me exuded understated luxury - walls adorned with abstract art, floor-to-ceiling windows offering a breathtaking view of the skyline, and designer furniture that spoke of refined taste rather than ostentatious wealth. Lucas was the only one present; the private physician he'd mentioned earlier was nowhere to be seen.

"Would you like me to call Stella to keep you company?" Lucas asked, his deep voice gentle. He continued, explaining, "The doctor says given your current condition, you'll need complete bed rest for at least three to five days. It'll take about two weeks before you can move around normally - by normally, I mean regaining full mobility except for your leg. The fracture itself will take at least three months to heal completely."

I didn't want Stella to see me in this vulnerable state. The thought of causing her any distress made my heart ache. "No, that's alright," I replied softly.

"Very well," he respected my decision without pressing further.

The room fell into a heavy silence. The awkwardness of the situation - being in his private quarters, dependent on his care - finally got to me. "I need to use the bathroom," I admitted reluctantly.

"I'll carry you," he stated matter-of-factly, moving toward me before I could protest.

But as he began to lift me, he noticed the IV line still attached to my arm. Glancing at the nearly empty bag of fluids hanging from the chrome stand, he gently laid me back down. "This is just a nutritional drip. Now that you've eaten, we can remove it. It might sting a bit," he warned.

"Okay," I nodded, trying to mask my discomfort.

His movements were practiced and precise as he removed the IV catheter, applying steady pressure to the site afterward. The duration of his touch seemed unnecessarily long.

"That's enough," I urged, growing increasingly uncomfortable for more reasons than one.

"It's a permanent catheter - we need to maintain pressure longer," he explained patiently.

"I really can't wait," I confessed, my dignity warring with physical necessity.

Finally understanding the urgency, he instructed me to keep pressure on the site myself before carefully lifting me into his arms. The master bathroom was a marvel of marble and glass, but I hardly noticed as he carefully set me down beside the custom-heated toilet seat. Before I could say anything, he'd already helped me out of the loose-fitting clothes I was wearing - his clothes, I realized belatedly.

"Go ahead," he said calmly, as if this wasn't the most mortifying moment of my life.

Gingerly settling myself, I glanced down at my clothing. I remembered I'd been on my period, but there was no pad, yet everything was clean.

Seeming to read my thoughts, he stated simply, "It ended yesterday."

My head snapped up to stare at him. So he had... taken care of that too? My face burned despite my usually unflappable demeanor in the boardroom. All my years of handling million-dollar negotiations hadn't prepared me for this level of intimacy.

"I wasn't sure about the best approach, so I used premium adult care products," he continued matter-of-factly. "The flow seemed moderate..."

"Could you please step out?" I interrupted, unable to handle any more detailed commentary about my bodily functions.

"Ah," he glanced at my flushed face. "Call me when you're done. The doctor emphasized that you absolutely cannot risk a fall in your weakened state. The consequences could be severe."

"Just go!" I pleaded, at my limit in more ways than one.

After I'd finished, he carried me back to the California king bed with its impossibly soft sheets. Wanting to feel somewhat more put together, I said, "I'd like to freshen up a bit, wash my face."

"We'll do it here."

After settling me against the cushioned headboard, he disappeared into the bathroom, returning with a crystal bowl of warm water and what appeared to be hand-pressed Egyptian cotton washcloths. He moved to begin washing my face himself.

"I can manage," I reached for the cloth, feeling stronger after having eaten.

He didn't argue, simply helping by wringing out the cloth as I wiped my face, hands, and neck.

"Would you like to clean up more thoroughly?" he inquired.

The suggestion made me realize how much I yearned for a proper shower. "Could I take a bath?" I asked hopefully.

"Yes," his immediate agreement surprised me.

"On one condition," he added, his expression serious. "I'll have to help you."
###chapter 234
Serena's POV

I stared at Lucas in disbelief as he calmly stated, "I've been the one taking care of you these past few days."

*And your point is?* I thought to myself.

He continued listing his caretaking duties with surprising directness. "Helping you wash your face, cleaning up, changing your..." 

"Can we please stop there?" I cut him off, unable to bear any more details.

"Of course," he replied with that impossibly handsome smile of his.

"Would you like to shower?" he asked, maintaining his professional demeanor.

"No, thank you." I declined immediately. There was a world of difference between knowing something happened and having it spelled out in detail.

Trying to distract myself from the tempting thought of a hot shower, I changed the subject. "Where exactly are we?"

"This is my private residence in Portland, about two hours from the Thorne estate," he explained. "Besides us, there's a small staff - two housekeepers, five security personnel, and a private physician."

"Has Rachel been here?" I asked. The question wasn't born of jealousy. Honestly, whatever relationship had developed between him and Rachel Thorne wasn't my primary concern. What worried me was my safety. If Rachel happened to discover my presence here, I doubted Lucas could truly protect me - just like that night when he knew about the danger but couldn't prevent it.

"She doesn't know about this place," he answered. "To be precise, none of the Thornes know about this private residence."

I studied his face as he added, "I wouldn't lie to you. I wouldn't dare."

I pressed my lips together before asking directly, "You knew there would be danger that night, didn't you?"

"No, I didn't," he responded. Seeing my frown, he continued, "I've been in Portland for a month, helping the Thornes with some corporate restructuring and assisting Rachel with their annual charity gala. As for whatever the family might have been planning behind closed doors, I was kept in the dark. They still don't trust me completely."

"Then why did you try so hard to keep me away from Portland?" I challenged, skepticism evident in my voice.

He began a detailed analysis: "It was speculation based on two critical situations facing the Thorne family. First, their strategy regarding Silas Thorne's branch of the family, which is crucial to their political ambitions. Second, maintaining Clarence Thorne's commercial empire, which represents generations of family power. The key players in both situations are Atticus and myself."

I listened silently as he elaborated on the family dynamics. He explained that if anything happened to Atticus, it would severely impact Silas's position, as Atticus's father lacked both the capability and interest in political advancement. Clarence's faction saw Atticus as their primary target in their move against Silas.

Lucas explained that Clarence chose to act now because of rumors about Silas's health issues. By targeting Atticus, they hoped to force Silas's hand, possibly even engineering a situation that could prove fatal for Atticus.

His expression grew more serious when discussing his own role as the other key player. The family's approach to him differed completely from their treatment of Atticus - while they wanted Atticus eliminated, they sought to bring Lucas into their fold. My existence, he said, was the only complication in their plan to secure his loyalty.

I watched him intently, noting the subtle changes in his expression but remaining silent.

"The charity gala presented them with an opportunity they couldn't resist," he concluded. "With both you and Atticus present, they could accomplish two objectives with a single action."

I noticed his throat tighten slightly as he recalled the violence of that night. He admitted that he wasn't clever enough to fully predict the family's intentions, that these were just his assumptions and post-event analysis. He couldn't foresee everything, couldn't prepare for every possible threat to my safety. Even the family's choice to stage a car accident was something he only realized at the last moment.

"That's why I tried to keep you away from Portland," he explained. "Without your presence, they might have only targeted Atticus. But with you there, they would definitely move against him. No one, especially a family as calculating as the Thornes, would pass up the chance to achieve two goals with one strike."

His words left me in contemplative silence, the weight of the situation settling over us both.



I'll help rewrite the scene from Serena's first-person perspective, adapting it to the Manhattan setting while maintaining the emotional depth and character dynamics.

I'd anticipated the risks of coming to Portland. That's precisely why I'd left the charity gala early with Atticus Thorne. Lucas had been right - we're not omniscient. There was no way to predict how the Thorne family would move against us. Leaving early had been a calculated decision, not mere caution.

My presence in Portland wasn't simply an act of defiance against Lucas. I'd made it clear earlier - I had no other options left. Once the Thornes had set their sights on me, retreat became impossible. My only path led forward, and I needed Atticus Thorne as my shield in this game of corporate chess.

Every move I made had to consider the delicate balance of my alliance with Atticus. In the ruthless world of Manhattan's elite, the moment you cease being valuable is the moment you become disposable. I'd learned that lesson all too well in the marble halls and penthouse boardrooms of the city.

I didn't bother explaining any of this to Lucas. Looking at his composed profile against the stormy Portland sky, I suddenly found myself unable to define our relationship. It wasn't just about our personal connection anymore - it was about the precarious balance of power and influence. Were we allies or adversaries? What was his true stance on the Thorne family drama? Perhaps he was simply watching from the sidelines, waiting to see whether Clarence or Silas Thorne would emerge victorious before making his final move.

Meanwhile, I'd already cast my lot with Silas Thorne, betting everything on his son Atticus. The weight of that decision pressed heavily on my shoulders.

My emotions were a tangled mess. I'd weathered many storms before: my mother Helen's early death, the cold manipulation from my father Lawrence and stepmother Angela, and Ian's betrayal. Back then, those were simply personal wounds - things I could endure or fight against alone. But now, for the first time, I felt truly lost, unable to glimpse even a shadow of what lay ahead.

"How's Atticus?" I asked abruptly, trying to ground myself in the present. The complexities of the situation threatened to overwhelm me, but I knew one thing with certainty - Atticus and I were in this together now.

"Alive," Lucas replied curtly, his tone carrying a weight of unspoken thoughts.

"May I borrow your phone to call him?" I asked politely, maintaining the formal courtesy that came naturally after years in Manhattan's social circles.

Lucas didn't immediately respond. His obvious hostility toward Atticus only added to my confusion about where Lucas and I stood. What should our relationship be? What positions should we take in this corporate war?

"I think I need to rest a bit longer," I said softly, not pushing the issue.

"Did you know about Atticus's... preferences?" Lucas asked suddenly, his voice carefully neutral.

"Yes." I answered honestly. When Atticus had first approached me in my office about our partnership, he'd handed me evidence of his own scandals - compromising photos with other men. It was his way of ensuring my absolute trust.

Perhaps that's why I trusted Atticus more than others. For someone in Manhattan's spotlight, such revelations would be catastrophic. If I ever leaked those photos, his career would be finished. By sharing this vulnerability, he'd demonstrated absolute sincerity and given me genuine security in our alliance.

"Keep it brief," Lucas said, finally extending his phone to me.

His sudden change of heart surprised me. Moments ago, he'd been clearly resistant, but now he acquiesced without further argument. Lucas's thoughts remained as impenetrable as ever, like the mirrored surfaces of the skyscrapers we called home. I'd learned to accept that there were parts of him I might never fully understand.

After handing me his phone, Lucas stood and walked toward the door.
###chapter 235
Serena's POV

Lucas handed me his phone and quietly left the hospital room, giving me the privacy I needed. I appreciated his thoughtfulness - it was these small gestures that made me increasingly aware of his consideration.

I dialed Atticus's number from memory, my fingers slightly trembling against the cool screen.

"Serena?" His voice carried that characteristic lilt of his, immediately recognizing me despite the unfamiliar number.

"Yes, it's me," I responded, adjusting myself against the plush hospital pillows.

"I knew you'd call once you woke up." There was a hint of amusement in his voice. "How are you being treated under Lucas Harrington's care?"

"Well enough. All limbs intact," I replied dryly, glancing down at my bandaged arm.

"Same here," he matched my tone, "Though I might be confined to bed rest for a couple of weeks."

"Sounds about right." We continued exchanging details about our respective injuries, the sterile hospital air hanging heavy between our words.

"Can you speak freely?" Atticus suddenly changed the subject, his voice dropping slightly.

"Yes," I answered without hesitation. The immediacy of my response surprised even me.

"So you do trust Harrington," he observed with a knowing undertone. The implication was clear - I felt comfortable enough to speak openly while in Lucas's territory.

I pressed my lips together, reflecting on my instinctive response. Indeed, I hadn't even considered the possibility of Lucas monitoring my calls.

"To be fair, I don't think Harrington would stoop to such tactics either," Atticus conceded, seeming unbothered by the whole thing.

"Get to the point," I prompted, steering us back to more pressing matters.

"That night we barely escaped, and the Thornes are furious. With you and Lucas spending so much time together now, Rachel's becoming increasingly unstable. You need to be careful - I'm concerned she might do something rash."

"More rash than that night?" I couldn't help the sarcasm that crept into my voice.

"That night was a calculated move by Silas and his family. What I'm talking about is Rachel potentially acting alone, driven by emotion rather than strategy."

"Mm." I hummed in acknowledgment. I'd already anticipated this possibility. After all, Lucas had abandoned Rachel at the gala to save me, and he'd barely left my side since. No woman would take that kind of rejection lightly.

"After this incident, my grandfather will be taking action against Silas," Atticus continued frankly. "What Silas did that night effectively destroyed any possibility of reconciliation between our families. I apologize that you nearly lost your life in the process. I'll be honest - I suspected Silas might try something against me, but from a strategic standpoint, I couldn't refuse your visit to Portland. Between us, my family has been waiting for Silas to show his true colors."

"I understand," I replied evenly. While emotionally jarring, my rational side recognized the reality of the situation. My relationship with Atticus needed to remain uncomplicated, free from unnecessary entanglements.

"Thank you," he said with unexpected gravity.

"For what?"

"You risked your life to save me that night, even though Lucas was the one who executed the plan."

"I couldn't have just left you there to die. Anyone would have done the same. Besides, our fates are linked now - if something had happened to you, I wouldn't be in a much better position," I explained pragmatically.

"Regardless, I was the beneficiary," he insisted. "I owe you one."

While I hadn't expected any repayment, I saw no reason to refuse an advantageous position.

"Tell me something..." he ventured, "do you trust me more now? After Lucas risked everything to save you, are you still keeping him at arm's length?"

"Are you testing me?" I raised an eyebrow, though he couldn't see it. I understood his real question - whether I would remain committed to our alliance. Lucas's position in all of this was ambiguous, neither friend nor foe. I couldn't figure him out, and I knew Atticus couldn't either. Lucas was too clever, maintaining a position of strategic ambiguity that protected him from becoming anyone's primary target.

"Not at all," he denied. "You're the most trustworthy person in my life right now. You saved my life - and while I may be driven by ambition, I never forget my debts."

I smiled faintly at his self-congratulatory tone.

"Yes, I trust you more," I admitted.

"Still the rational one," he chuckled. "Most women would have fallen head over heels for Lucas by now. Imagine if he knew that after risking his life to save you, he still hasn't earned your trust. It would break his heart, wouldn't it?"

I answered in slince.

"Lucas and I were actually classmates at Harvard," Atticus switched the converssation to ease the embarrassment, his voice carrying that characteristic blend of aristocratic polish and casual frankness, "When you strip away the family names and fortunes, we were just two students there. And in that level playing field..." He paused, letting out a small laugh. "Well, let's just say I was barely a blip on anyone's radar compared to him."

I frowned, adjusting the silk pillows behind me. This was the first I'd heard of their shared college years. The thought of Lucas in his younger days, before all the responsibilities of running Harrington International, sparked my curiosity.

Atticus continued, warming to his theme. "Lucas was practically legendary on campus. Top of his class in Economics, captain of the rowing team, and of course, that classic Harrington charm. The number of sorority girls who..." He trailed off meaningfully.

"Weren't you famously uninterested in sorority girls?" I interrupted, unable to hide my amusement.

"Doesn't mean I couldn't appreciate the competition," he replied with mock seriousness. "Or feel thoroughly overshadowed by it."

I couldn't help but laugh at his theatrical delivery, wincing slightly as the movement pulled at my stitches.

"And now," he added, his tone lighter, "thanks to you, I finally feel like I've got one up on the great Lucas Harrington. My ego is thoroughly restored."

"I can't believe you're this petty," I said, shaking my head even though he couldn't see me. "Is this how all you Ivy League boys think?"

Suddenly, his voice took on a more serious note. "You know, I could arrange to have you transferred. Get you out of there if you wanted."

The unexpected offer caught me off guard, and I found myself staring at the bouquets of white roses and hydrangeas that filled the room.

Noting my hesitation, he asked softly, "Or are you exactly where you want to be?"

"It's not that," I said, watching a nurse pass by in the hallway through the frosted glass door. "I'm just not cleared to be moved yet. The doctors are still monitoring my condition."

"I was mostly joking anyway," he admitted. "Even if I wanted to, I doubt I could find out which hospital you're in. Lucas has made sure of that. And truthfully? You're probably safest wherever he's arranged for you to be. Take the time to rest and recover properly."

His words stirred something in my chest - a mixture of gratitude and something else I wasn't quite ready to name.

The buzz of an incoming call interrupted my thoughts. "I should go," I said, glancing at my phone screen. "Rachel's calling Lucas."

"Before you do," Atticus added quickly, "tell Lucas to get you a new phone and restore your old number. You need to stay connected."

"I know, I will," I assured him before ending the call.

"Lucas!" I called out toward the door, my voice echoing slightly in the spacious room.

The door opened immediately, revealing Lucas standing there in his perfectly tailored suit, his presence filling the doorframe. I knew he hadn't been eavesdropping on my conversation with Atticus - that wasn't his style. Instead, he'd simply been keeping watch, ensuring my safety while giving me privacy.

"Rachel's trying to reach you," I said, watching as he pulled out his phone to check the missed call.
###chapter 236
Serena's POV

I handed Lucas my phone. He glanced at me briefly before taking it and leaving the room. When he returned a few minutes later, neither of us mentioned Rachel's call. We both chose to avoid discussing her entirely.

"Could you help me get a new phone and set up a new number?" I asked.

"Someone will deliver it shortly," he replied.

"Thank you."

"Would you like to rest a bit more?" he asked.

"Yes."

I lay back down as he left the room. The bedroom fell silent. Truth be told, I couldn't sleep - how could I after being bedridden for three days? I just needed some quiet time to think about my next moves.

I spent three more days in Lucas's private Manhattan penthouse. By then, I could finally get up, though I needed crutches to take a few tentative steps.

When I finally ventured out of the guest suite he'd arranged for me, I was struck by the sheer grandeur of his residence - a stunning five-story penthouse crowning one of the most exclusive buildings in Tribeca. The wraparound terrace offered breathtaking views of the Hudson River and the downtown skyline, with an infinity pool that seemed to merge with the horizon. The interior was a masterpiece of understated luxury - soaring ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and custom furnishings that spoke of refined taste rather than ostentatious wealth.

I settled into a lounger on the terrace, soaking in the winter sun while scrolling through my phone. A week had passed, but the Thorne Foundation Gala remained the talk of Manhattan's social circles. Charity galas always generated buzz, but this year's event had become a media sensation thanks to the announcement of Lucas and Rachel's engagement, not to mention the speculation about my complicated relationship with Atticus.

I scrolled through the media's fawning coverage of Lucas and Rachel, then the endless speculation about Atticus and me. The consensus seemed to be that we were secretly dating but hadn't made it official yet.

I opened the comments section on one of the society blogs. My brow furrowed when I noticed Nina's name trending. Nina with an older gentleman? I backed out of my own coverage and searched further, finding a less prominent article with photos of her leaving an upscale restaurant arm-in-arm with the man who had bid on her dance performance that night.

Nina... had she really sunk so low?

I felt little sympathy for her downfall. It was the natural consequence of her choices. Rachel wouldn't have invested so heavily in Nina without expecting something in return. The moment Nina accepted Rachel's patronage, she'd sealed her fate. The nightmare was just beginning for her.

I set my phone down on the mahogany dining table. A familiar presence loomed behind me, accompanied by that distinctive cologne I'd grown accustomed to over the past few days. Lucas had been staying in the adjacent suite, a fact that hadn't escaped Rachel, I'm sure. 

The irony wasn't lost on me. Here he was, recently engaged to Rachel Thorne, yet spending his days by my side instead of with her. I could only imagine how that reality was twisting inside Rachel's mind.

"Dinner's ready," Lucas said softly, his voice carrying that gentle tone he seemed to reserve just for me.

Our dynamic over the past few days had settled into something surprisingly comfortable-neither too distant nor too intimate. We operated like old friends, carefully maintaining appropriate boundaries. I followed him into the dining room, where the staff had set the table with the kind of understated elegance that marked old money homes in Manhattan.

His phone started ringing, an insistent melody that broke through our peaceful routine. It wasn't the first time today.

"You should answer that," I suggested, knowing full well it was Rachel. She had impeccable timing, always calling during meals. It wasn't coincidence-she was too smart for that. Rachel knew that if Lucas and I were sharing the same space, we'd likely be dining together. These calculated interruptions were her way of marking her territory.

I wanted to tell her it wasn't necessary. Whatever was happening between her and Lucas shouldn't affect me. But then again, Manhattan's elite circles were never that simple.

Lucas excused himself, moving toward the terrace doors. Even with his lowered voice, the tension in his shoulders spoke volumes. I focused on my plate, a beautifully arranged piece of herb-crusted salmon, trying not to think about their conversation. It was probably the usual check-ins between engaged couples, though something in his posture suggested otherwise.

When he returned, the silence stretched between us before he finally spoke. "I have an engagement downtown this evening. I won't be back for dinner."

"All right."

"I can have something prepared for you before I leave-"

"That won't be necessary," I cut him off, perhaps more sharply than intended. These past few days, he'd taken it upon himself to cook every meal, despite having a full kitchen staff at his disposal. "No offense, but your cooking isn't exactly five-star quality."

He held my gaze, something unreadable flickering in his eyes.

"I'd like to try something different," I added more gently, glancing around the elegant dining room. "Surely this place has other culinary talent?"

"Of course," he conceded, then added quietly, "I understand."

The silence that followed was heavy with unspoken words. I could sense his disappointment, and it stirred something uncomfortable in my chest. Yes, I was grateful for everything he'd done-saving my life wasn't a small matter. But our current situation was precarious at best. The lines between gratitude and something more dangerous were already starting to blur.

Later that afternoon, he left dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, clearly headed to some high-profile gathering. The penthouse felt different without his presence, larger and somehow emptier. I sat alone at the dining table, sampling dishes prepared by the resident chef. The food was excellent, technically perfect in every way. Yet something was missing.

That's the trouble with habits-they form before you notice, and dependency follows close behind.

As I methodically worked through my meal, my phone screen lit up with a message from Rachel. No words, just a photo: her and Lucas at what appeared to be a society event, her head resting on his shoulder, radiating the picture-perfect image of Manhattan's golden couple.

I set both my phone and fork down, appetite suddenly gone.

"Ms. Sinclair, is everything not to your liking?" the chef asked, concern evident in his voice.

"The food is wonderful," I assured him with a practiced smile. "I'm just not feeling well." It wasn't a lie, exactly. The twisting sensation in my stomach was real enough, even if its cause had nothing to do with the food.

"Should I call for Dr. Mitchell to check on you?"

"That won't be necessary." The medical team hadn't stayed at the penthouse since my vital signs stabilized. Only my limited mobility remained an issue.

"Perhaps-"

"Please, don't worry about me," I said, rising carefully with my cane. "Carry on with your evening."

I made my way toward the terrace, the Manhattan skyline glittering beyond the glass doors. It's fascinating how we can fool everyone around us while failing miserably at deceiving ourselves.

My phone rang, breaking through my melancholy. Looking at the caller ID, I took a deep breath and painted on a smile that would carry through my voice.
###chapter 237
Serena's POV

"Eleanor," I answered, my voice soft in the darkness.

"Are you still in Portland?" The familiar warmth in her voice brought memories of easier times flooding back.

"Yes, is everything alright?"

"I was hoping you could come over for dinner tomorrow. You won't believe it, but I've actually become quite good at cooking." She laughed, the sound tinged with pride. "I wanted you and Quinn to come try it and give me your honest opinion. Drew keeps saying everything's delicious, but I'm pretty sure he's just trying to flatter me. I need some real feedback."

The affection in her voice when she mentioned Drew made my heart ache with a bittersweet joy. Their happiness was a reminder of what love could be - uncomplicated and pure. I smiled, though she couldn't see it. "I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I won't be able to make it back anytime soon."

"Wait..." There was a pause, and I could practically see her sitting up straighter. "Are you really with Atticus Thorne? Are you staying at his place? Are you living together?" The excitement in her voice was unmistakable.

I knew this conversation was coming. She'd been texting me about the news reports, but I'd avoided responding. The situation was too complicated to explain in messages. But now, facing her direct questions, I couldn't dodge the truth any longer.

"Have you really given up on my brother... on Lucas?" she asked, her voice quieter now, more hesitant.

I couldn't help but tease, trying to lighten the moment. "Lucas abandoned you, and you're still taking his side?"

"It wasn't really abandonment," she protested. "Given his situation, choosing his aunt made sense. The Harringtons have always prioritized family ties. It's deeply ingrained in them - the influence of their upbringing isn't something that can be easily changed."

Eleanor's kindness never ceased to amaze me. She always tried to see the best in people, to understand their motivations. But right now, I needed her to focus on the present situation.

"You're deflecting," she continued, her voice gaining momentum. "What's really going on with you and Atticus? Is it real, or is it just circumstances? Are you trying to keep Rachel away?"

I sighed, running my fingers through my hair. "There's nothing between Atticus and me. It's just rumors, but neither of us is in a position to deny them right now. The situation is... complicated."

"I knew it! I knew you couldn't have moved on that quickly."

"Even if I were with Atticus, it wouldn't be 'moving on,'" I corrected her gently. "You can't move on from something that never truly began."

The conversation shifted as Eleanor began talking about her relationship with Drew. Her voice became shy, hesitant. "Serena... about Drew and me..."

I waited patiently, knowing she needed time to find the right words.

After a deep breath, she continued, "Do you think we're ready to... you know... take that next step?"

"You haven't yet?" The words slipped out before I could stop them.

"Drew might seem like a playboy, but he's surprisingly traditional about this. Sometimes I think maybe I should take the initiative? It feels like something's missing without that intimacy."

I considered my words carefully. "If you're sure about Drew and your feelings are genuine, there's nothing wrong with taking the initiative. The traditional idea that women should always wait for men to make the first move is outdated. What matters is that you both feel ready and comfortable."

"So you think I should... prepare?" The excitement in her voice was barely contained.

We talked for a while longer before finally hanging up. I found myself staring out the window at the few stars visible through Portland's light pollution, lost in thought. The night was deep, and sleep felt impossibly far away.

Glancing at my phone, I saw it was already 11 PM. I wondered if Lucas had returned yet, though something told me he wouldn't be coming back tonight.

Despite the pain in my leg, I got up, using my crutch for support as I headed to the kitchen for water. As I opened my bedroom door, I saw Lucas walking in from the main entrance. His cheeks were flushed, suggesting he'd been drinking.

He noticed me standing in the doorway with my crutch and smiled, that infuriatingly confident smile that used to make my heart skip a beat. "Were you waiting up for me?"

I scoffed, turning back toward my room. 

Lucas's arms encircled me from behind. The scent of whiskey hung heavy on his breath - he'd clearly had more than a few drinks tonight. His presence overwhelmed my senses, his warmth seeping through my thin silk blouse.

"Don't go." His voice was rough with emotion as he held me against his chest. His lips found the curve of my neck, drinking in my signature scent with desperate need. The sensation was intoxicating, and his embrace tightened as his mouth grew more insistent against my skin.

"Do you enjoy having multiple women in your arms?" I asked, my voice carrying an unusual chill. I felt his body tense at my words.

"Tell me, Lucas, who feels better in your arms - me or Rachel?" The sarcasm in my voice was sharp enough to cut. His entire body went rigid.

"I have to say, I really don't care for jasmine perfume," I added pointedly. The scent of Rachel's signature fragrance still clung to his clothes, unmistakable and damning.

His arms loosened their grip, and I easily slipped free of his embrace. I shut the bedroom door with perhaps more force than necessary, symbolically closing the door on whatever was left between us. Back in bed, I found myself painfully thirsty, but the thought of venturing out for water was unbearable. I tossed and turned, unable to escape the phantom scent of jasmine that seemed to have infected my entire room.

Finally, in frustration, I got up and headed to the en-suite bathroom. Since regaining my mobility, I'd insisted on maintaining my independence, including my nightly shower routine. The doctors had given their approval, provided I was careful to avoid infection and falls. I'd become expert at navigating around my injured right leg and the constellation of cuts and bruises that still marked my body.

The shower was a slow process - there were still many movements that caused discomfort. I let the warm water cascade over me, trying to wash away more than just the physical remnants of the day. As I stood under the spray, my mind wandered to the events that had brought me here. The betrayal still stung, but something else nagged at me - something about Lucas's behavior tonight that didn't quite fit with what I thought I knew.

After the shower, I changed into fresh sleepwear, soft cotton pants and a loose t-shirt that wouldn't aggravate my healing injuries. When I checked my phone, the glowing numbers showed 1:00 AM.

Returning to bed, I noticed something new on the nightstand - a thermal mug filled with water. I tested it with my finger, precisely the temperature I preferred. The gesture hit me harder than I expected.

I pressed my lips together, fighting back an unwanted surge of emotion. While I'd never explicitly told anyone about my midnight thirst, Lucas had somehow known. He had always possessed an uncanny ability to anticipate my needs, even now, even after everything.
###chapter 238
Serena's POV

I woke up later than usual the next morning. Not that I could help it-sleep had eluded me last night, my mind too preoccupied with everything that had happened.

Fortunately, I didn't have any pressing matters to attend to. I'd already handled most of my work commitments over the phone, so at least I didn't have to worry about my late start to the day.

As I stepped out of the guest bedroom, I found Lucas sitting on the leather sofa in the great room, his attention focused on his phone. Upon noticing me, he rose smoothly and headed toward the open kitchen. By the time I reached the dining area, he had already set breakfast in front of my usual spot. Though we hadn't been living under the same roof for long, a strange sort of rhythm had developed between us-or rather, he had developed an uncanny ability to anticipate my needs. I was merely the passive recipient of his attention.

We ate breakfast together, even though it was well past ten in the morning. He had waited for me all this time.

"Is it to your liking?" he asked, his deep voice breaking the comfortable silence.

I glanced up at him, my fork pausing midway to my mouth.

"I heard you barely touched your dinner last night," he continued, his grey eyes studying my face. "I arranged for a different chef today. If you don't enjoy the food, please let me know. There's no need to punish your body."

I pressed my lips together, a wave of guilt washing over me. I hadn't realized my lack of appetite last night had cost someone their position.

"It's good," I replied briefly, my voice soft.

Sometimes I wondered if Lucas did these things deliberately-using my conscience against me to achieve his goals. Now that I knew my actions had consequences for others, I wouldn't dare skip meals, regardless of my mood.

As we continued eating, a housekeeper approached Lucas with careful steps. "Mr. Harrington, sir, did you say you wanted us to dispose of the entire outfit you wore last night?"

The uncertainty in her voice was clear-the clothes in question probably cost more than she made in months. A mistake would be costly.

"Yes," Lucas replied without hesitation, not even looking up from his plate.

The housekeeper opened her mouth as if to say something more, then thought better of it. With a respectful "Very well, sir," she retreated from the room.

I watched her leave, then turned my attention back to Lucas. "You know, I could return to the city," I suggested quietly.

I didn't see how my presence here was making anything better. Being caught between him and Rachel only complicated matters further.

"I prefer having you where I can ensure your safety," he responded, his tone leaving no room for argument.

"And how long do you plan to keep me here?" I asked, unable to keep a hint of frustration from my voice.

"We'll see," he answered vaguely, his expression unreadable.

I bit my lip, swallowing the words that threatened to spill out. What was the point in arguing? This arrangement would end soon enough-next month at the latest, when he and Rachel would exchange their vows.


Drew's POV

I stared at my phone as Eleanor's name lit up the screen. Before I could even say hello, she asked, "Are you on your way?"

"Eleanor, I might be a bit late," I apologized, glancing at Spencer Sherwood's persistent messages. "Spencer won't let me leave. He's insisting I join him for drinks tonight. I've declined his invitations too many times lately, and now he's threatening to tag along if I don't stay. The last thing I want is him interrupting our evening together. Let me just get him properly drunk first, then I'll head over."

I could hear the slight disappointment in Eleanor's voice, though she tried to hide it. "That's okay. Take your time. I'll wait for you at home."

"I'll try to wrap this up as quickly as I can," I promised, my voice softening.

"No need to rush. The night is young," she replied with a hint of suggestion that didn't escape me. Truth be told, I had my own hopes for the evening ahead.

I shot an annoyed look at Spencer, who was pretending not to eavesdrop, and said to Eleanor, "See you tonight."

"See you tonight."

After hanging up, I couldn't help but smile. It's funny how happiness shows itself even in the smallest moments.

Spencer suddenly called out to Jace Gillard, who was typing away on his phone nearby. "I don't believe you actually have a girlfriend, Drew. Hey Jace, do you believe him? Unless you bring her out to meet us, I'm calling your bluff."

Before I could respond, Jace looked up and said simply, "I believe him."

I understood Spencer's game. He'd been trying to get me to bring Eleanor around for months. Though we'd been together for quite some time now, I'd never introduced her to my social circle. Sometimes I considered coming clean about our relationship, but whenever I brought it up with Eleanor, she'd gently discourage the idea.

I understood her hesitation. After everything that happened with the Harringtons, her need for privacy and security had only intensified. Besides me, only her closest friends, Serena Sinclair and Quinn Ashford, knew about us. She worried that if too many people found out, it might cause problems with the Harringtons. She knew Clara Harrington's vindictive nature well enough to know that time needed to pass before the woman's hatred would fade. Only then could we be together more openly. I had to respect her wishes.

As we headed downstairs, we ran into Clara Harrington and her daughter Maeve. The resemblance between Maeve and Eleanor was striking - they could almost pass for sisters. Everyone seemed surprised by the chance encounter, though given my mother Vivian's close friendship with Clara, perhaps it wasn't so unexpected.

"Drew, come here," my mother called out, waving me over.

I walked over, with Spencer and Jace trailing behind.

"Say hello to Clara," my mother prompted, giving me that familiar look that brooked no argument.

"Hello, Mrs. Harrington," I said politely, despite my personal feelings about her treatment of Eleanor. But for my mother's sake, I maintained the expected social niceties.

"This is Clara's daughter Maeve. She's two years younger than you," my mother said, her voice warm with obvious matchmaking intentions.

I studied Maeve briefly. Though she did look remarkably like Eleanor, there was something fundamentally different about her. "Hello," I said cordially.

"Hi," she responded shyly.

When the silence grew awkward, my mother jumped in: "You're usually so talkative, Drew. Don't tell me you're tongue-tied just because there's a pretty girl around?"

Before I could object, Clara interjected, "I'm afraid I've kept Maeve too sheltered. She's naturally quite reserved - perhaps I've been overprotective."

"Well, Drew has plenty of free time. He could show Maeve around, help her get more comfortable in social settings," my mother suggested, ignoring my glare.

"I'm actually quite busy," I protested.

"Busy doing what? Drinking with your friends?" my mother challenged, embarrassing me in front of everyone.

Unable to argue with her in public, I bit my tongue.

"We'd be so grateful if Drew could look after Maeve a bit," Clara added smoothly.

I wanted to refuse, but my mother's warning look forced out a reluctant "Sure."

I noticed Spencer and Jace exchange knowing glances - they clearly recognized this as the setup attempt it was.

The conversation that followed only made me more uncomfortable. They discussed Maeve's aspirations to enter the entertainment industry, with Clara asking Jace about potential roles for her daughter. My stomach churned as I remembered Eleanor's struggles in the industry, and how Clara had never shown an ounce of concern then. But now, for Maeve, she was pulling every string possible.

During dinner, they deliberately seated Maeve next to me. The whole situation felt suffocating. My thoughts kept drifting to Eleanor, counting the minutes until I could escape and see her. The forced small talk and obvious matchmaking attempts only strengthened my resolve to get through this quickly and get to where I really wanted to be - with Eleanor.
###chapter 239
Jace's POV

As the formal dinner party at the Yeager mansion wound down, Drew was eager to leave with Spencer and me, as he did every year. It was his birthday tradition: spend the afternoon dutifully dining with family and elders, then escape for his own celebration afterward.

Just as we were about to slip away from the mansion's grand foyer, Mrs. Yeager's voice cut through our escape plans. "Drew, darling, take Maeve with you tonight."

I watched Drew's expression instantly sour. "Take her where exactly?"

"Wherever you're going, she goes," Mrs. Yeager stated firmly, her tone leaving no room for argument.

"But we're just going to..." Drew started to protest.

"That's precisely why Maeve should go with you," Mrs. Yeager interrupted, her voice carrying that particular maternal steel that brooked no argument. "I'm entrusting her to your care."

"Why me?" Drew exploded, his carefully maintained composure finally cracking. "If anyone should be responsible for her, it's Jace. He's her uncle, after all."

I shot Drew a pointed look. Classic Drew, always trying to dodge responsibility by throwing someone else under the bus - even his best friend.

"I don't care which one of you takes responsibility," Mrs. Yeager declared. "I'm leaving her in your collective care. Mrs. Harrington and I have our bridge game to finish, and I expect you to look after Maeve properly. If anything happens to her, Drew, you'll answer to me." With that final threat hanging in the air, she turned and walked away, leaving us no chance to object.

The four of us stood in awkward silence in the foyer. I noticed Maeve staring at the marble floor, her shoulders tense with discomfort. She was wearing a modest evening dress, clearly chosen to impress, but now she seemed to wish she could disappear into it.

Just as Drew was beginning to resign himself to our new babysitting duty, I spoke up. "Drew, you and Spencer head over first. I'll drive Maeve home."

Drew shot me a knowing look. After years of friendship, we could read each other's intentions clearly - he knew I was planning to get Maeve out of the picture. His frown transformed into a grin, and he playfully punched my shoulder. "Don't keep us waiting too long, man."

"Wouldn't dream of it," I replied smoothly.

After Drew and Spencer departed, I turned to Maeve. "Shall we?"

"Yes, thank you," she murmured, following me to my car.

In the vehicle, I watched Maeve nervously fidget with her bracelet. The silence stretched for a few blocks before I decided to be direct. "Do you actually like Drew?"

She startled slightly, her cheeks flushing. "He seems... nice."

"Your mother brought you tonight hoping you'd get closer to Drew, didn't she? Perhaps even start dating?"

"Yes," she admitted quietly.

"Drew isn't right for you," I stated plainly.

She looked up at me, hurt evident in her expression. "You don't think I'm good enough for him?"

"That's not it at all," I clarified, keeping my eyes on the road. "Drew simply isn't interested in someone like you."

"What type does he prefer then?"

"It doesn't matter. The point is, Drew won't reciprocate your feelings. If you want to avoid getting hurt or ending up in an embarrassing situation, I suggest you tell your mother you're not interested in him. Let her drop this matchmaking idea."

I could see tears welling in her eyes through the rearview mirror. "But I don't want to disappoint her. She's just trying to help me..."

"Relationships aren't about pleasing other people," I said firmly.

"I just want to make her happy..."

"How would you like to be famous?" I asked, changing tack.

Her surprised expression told me I'd caught her interest.

"Give up on Drew, and I'll help launch your career," I offered.

I could practically see the wheels turning in her head as she considered my proposition.

"Think about it," I said, not wanting to pressure her.

As we pulled up to the Harrington estate, she gathered her courage and asked, "Uncle Jace, you're not just saying this, are you?"

"No, I'm not," I assured her firmly.

"Then I'll tell mother I didn't feel any connection with Drew."

"Good decision," I nodded. "I'll be in touch soon. Within six months, you'll be a recognizable name. A year at most."

"Thank you, Uncle Jace."

"Time to go in."

"Drive safely, Uncle Jace."

After dropping Maeve off, I headed toward the bar where Drew and Spencer were waiting. As I drove, I began making calls, setting the wheels in motion to secure opportunities for Maeve's career. 

I helped Drew stumble out of the private room at the club. Spencer was still passed out on the leather couch, but I didn't bother with him. It was our regular room anyway-he'd find his way out once he woke up.

The night air hit us as we emerged from the club's entrance, the bass still thrumming through the walls behind us. Drew could barely stand, his usual sharp wit dulled by too many drinks. I flagged down a taxi, but as I tried to help him in, he nearly collapsed.

"I'll drive you myself," I said, more out of concern than kindness. The last thing I needed was him passing out in some random taxi. Drew didn't protest-he probably couldn't have even if he wanted to. I guided him to my car, careful to keep him from falling face-first onto the pavement.

The drive to Eleanor's apartment complex was quiet except for Drew's occasional snoring. I kept glancing at him slumped in the passenger seat, wondering what had possessed him to drink so much. Then again, I knew exactly why-Eleanor had mentioned earlier that she was looking forward to seeing him tonight. Drew, being Drew, had probably tried to speed through the business dinner to get to her sooner.

When we arrived at the complex, I shook his shoulder gently. "Hey. Should I call Eleanor to come get you, or can you make it up yourself?"

Drew's eyes fluttered open, unfocused and glazed. Before he could answer, he lurched out of the car and emptied his stomach onto the curb. I stood there, amazed at how much someone his size could drink. The night air was cool against my face as I waited for him to finish, the sound of distant traffic providing an urban soundtrack to this mess of a situation.

"I'm fine... I can walk," he slurred, attempting to stand straight. "Not drunk at all..." He hiccupped, contradicting his own statement as he wobbled toward the building's entrance.

Watching him sway like a tree in a storm, I couldn't just leave him. I caught up and steadied him, guiding him through the lobby. The night security guard gave us a knowing look-he'd probably seen his fair share of similar scenes.

In the elevator, Drew started to doze off again, leaving me to ask, "Which floor?"

When he didn't respond, I sighed. "Look, maybe I should just take you back to your place. You're in no shape to see Eleanor. She'll end up having to take care of you all night."

"No..." He jerked awake at that suggestion, suddenly more alert. "Promised her... can't disappoint..." He hiccupped again, his words slurring together. "Twenty-third floor."

The elevator ride felt endless. Drew kept mumbling about promises and disappointment, while I stood there wondering how I'd ended up playing babysitter to a grown man. When we finally reached his floor, I half-carried him to the apartment number he managed to grunt out.

I'd planned to just prop him against the wall and leave, but he couldn't even stand on his own. With no other choice, I pressed the doorbell, already dreading what was coming.

The door opened, and there stood Eleanor. My breath caught involuntarily-she was wearing a form-fitting dress that seemed to dance between revelation and concealment. Her dark hair fell in soft waves around her shoulders, and her eyes, usually bright with mischief, darkened when they landed on me.

The joy that had initially lit up her face froze and shattered in an instant. Seeing me twice in one night was clearly not in her plans. The air between us grew thick with unspoken tension, memories of our earlier encounter at the club hanging heavy in the space between us.

I forced myself to look away from her, focusing instead on Drew's slumped form. "He wanted to see you so badly that he tried to drink Spencer under the table. Ended up drinking himself under it instead. I brought him here since he insisted."

Eleanor remained silent, her presence a magnetic force I was trying desperately to ignore.

"Let me just help him inside," I said, keeping my voice steady despite the way my heart was hammering against my ribs. "He can barely stand."

"Thank you," she replied, her voice carrying all the warmth of an arctic winter. She stepped aside to let us through.

I attempted to remove my shoes at the entrance while still supporting Drew, but it was an awkward dance of trying to maintain balance while being respectful of her home.

"Don't bother," Eleanor said, kneeling to help Drew into a pair of plush slippers that matched her own. The domestic intimacy of the matching set made something twist in my chest. "You'll be leaving right away anyway."
###chapter 240
Jace's POV

I deliberately kept my shoes on, making a conscious effort to avoid looking in Eleanor's direction. The delicate design of her slip dress demanded extra caution from me, though my peripheral vision betrayed occasional glimpses that I immediately suppressed.

Supporting Drew's stumbling form, I guided him through the apartment. "Which room should he sleep in?" I asked, keeping my voice neutral and professional.

"Mine," Eleanor pointed down the hallway. "This way."

I felt my throat tighten involuntarily but quickly regained my composure. The situation was already awkward enough without my discomfort becoming apparent. As I half-carried, half-dragged Drew's considerable weight toward Eleanor's room, I couldn't help but notice the subtle fragrance of lavender that seemed to permeate the space. It was so different from the expensive perfumes she used to wear at the Harrington residence.

Just as I managed to lower Drew onto Eleanor's bed, careful to maintain my balance-

"Urgh!"

Drew suddenly lurched forward, emptying the contents of his stomach all over my shirt and pants. Wave after wave of sick splattered across my clothing, the warm, acidic smell instantly making my own stomach turn. After what felt like an eternity, he finally stopped, rolled over, and immediately started snoring. In his drunken stupor, he mumbled, "I need to go to my girlfriend's... It's her birthday... Need to be there..."

The room fell into an uncomfortable silence, broken only by Drew's gentle snoring and the distant hum of the air conditioning.

I watched as Eleanor carefully climbed onto the bed to check on Drew, her movements cautious and measured. The scene before me felt surreal-Eleanor Yates, who once wouldn't even pour her own water, now tending to a drunk friend with such natural concern.

"I should go," I said, already turning toward the door. "He's your responsibility now." The words came out harsher than I intended, perhaps betraying my discomfort with the whole situation.

"Don't you want to clean up first?"

Her voice stopped me in my tracks, my fingers instinctively clenching at my sides. The mess on my clothes was becoming unbearable, the fabric sticking uncomfortably to my skin. My obsession with cleanliness was screaming at me to get out of these clothes immediately.

"Drew keeps some clothes here," she continued, her voice careful and measured. "You could take a shower, and I'll find something for you to change into."

I knew she was being considerate of my well-known germaphobia. The thought of traveling home in these soiled clothes was already making my skin crawl.

"Don't overthink it," she added quickly, perhaps noticing my hesitation. "It's just because Drew ruined your clothes... Of course, if you'd rather leave, that's fine too. Just make sure to lock the front door on your way out..."

"Thank you," I turned to face her, keeping my tone politely distant. "I appreciate it."

My response seemed to surprise her, and I realized she might have only been making a perfunctory offer. But before I could backtrack, she said, "I'll go run the water for you."

I watched as she moved between the bathroom and bedroom, gathering towels and clothes with an efficiency I wouldn't have expected from her a year ago. The Eleanor I knew from the Harrington household would have called for a maid at the slightest inconvenience. Now here she was, handling everything herself with a quiet competence that was somehow more elegant than all her previous affected sophistication.

The transformation fascinated me. Was it the change in environment that had shaped her into this more grounded person? Or was it Drew's influence? The thought of Drew's role in her life created an unexpected tightness in my chest that I chose not to examine too closely.



Eleanor's POV

I watched as Jace turned and walked away. When I caught his gaze for that brief moment, all I saw was his cold, retreating figure. 

A bitter smile crossed my lips. Jace probably never imagined I would become like this. Back at the Harrington residence, I was indeed spoiled and willful.

After cleaning up the floor, I went to get a warm washcloth for Drew, gently wiping his face and hands. I removed his shoes and jacket to make him more comfortable as he lay there. The sight of him so vulnerable tugged at something inside me - this man who had shown me nothing but kindness, even at my worst.

Once I finished taking care of Drew, I walked into the bathroom and caught my reflection in the mirror - I was still wearing that alluring slip dress. A wave of emotion rippled through me, but I quickly pushed it aside. What attraction could I possibly hold for Jace now? Even if I had stripped bare, it wouldn't have mattered. Why should I care anymore?

Still, I changed out of the dress. There was clearly no chance of things progressing with Drew tonight, not in his current state. I couldn't pretend I wasn't disappointed - all my romantic plans for the evening had quite literally been thrown up on. But because it was Drew, I found I could tolerate almost anything. His kindness made it impossible to truly be angry at anything he did.

After changing into sleepwear, I went to the kitchen to make some honey water for Drew and heat up the sweet dumplings we'd brought home earlier. Just as I finished preparing everything in the open kitchen, the bathroom door opened. Jace emerged wearing Drew's pajamas, his hair still damp from the shower.

Drew's clothes hung loose on Jace's frame - Drew had lost weight recently, and I'd bought these pajamas to fit his current size. Jace was actually slightly taller than Drew. Perhaps it was my imagination, but Jace seemed thinner than I remembered...

"Excuse me, is there a hair dryer?" Jace asked politely.

I snapped out of my thoughts, realizing I'd been staring too long. Someone like Jace, who took such meticulous care of himself and knew exactly how to climb the social ladder, would never neglect his health. If he had lost weight, it would only be in pursuit of his career goals. As long as he deemed the trade-off between his body and the wealth and status he craved worthwhile, who was I to judge?

"Yes, I'll get it for you." I set down what I was doing and walked from behind the counter to fetch the hair dryer from my bathroom.

As I handed it to him, our arms came into view side by side. My eyes flickered slightly as I glanced down at my sleepwear, suddenly aware that I was wearing the matching set I'd bought with Drew. I'd placed them in the bathroom earlier, planning for us to wear them together after... well. I'd put them on without thinking.

Once upon a time, I'd dreamed of living under the same roof as Jace, wearing matching clothes - all those things I'd wanted so desperately but could never have. Now that I'd completely given up on those dreams, here they were, manifesting in the most ironic way possible. The universe really did have a twisted sense of humor.

I handed Jace the hair dryer without comment. There was no need to explain - he wouldn't care anyway. To someone without feelings, what you wear means nothing. Besides, I'd made it clear earlier that these were Drew's pajamas. It was only natural for Drew and me to have matching sets.

Back at the counter, I continued preparing the sweet treats for Drew. I noticed Jace glance at me, his eyes lingering on my matching sleepwear. For a moment, I thought I saw a hint of color rise in his downcast eyes.

Jace returned to the bathroom to dry his hair. I placed the honey water and sweet dumplings on Drew's bedside table, but seeing him sleeping so deeply, I decided not to wake him. After a moment's consideration, I walked to the bathroom and knocked: "Jace, give me your clothes."

Jace opened the door, his hair half-dry. "What?"

Without further explanation, I walked in. His clothes lay on the counter, still covered in Drew's vomit. As I reached for them, he quickly moved to stop me. "What are you doing?"

I gave him a hard look. "I'm going to wash them. Unless you plan to go home wearing Drew's pajamas?"
###chapter 241
Jace's POV

I'll help you adapt this scene into English while maintaining the emotional depth and expanding it to meet the word count requirement. I'll convert this into the scene between Jace Gillard and Eleanor Yates, with Drew Yeager as the boyfriend.



Here's the expanded English version:

"I... I can wash them myself, don't trouble yourself," I stammered, my voice barely above a whisper. Eleanor's presence always made me inexplicably nervous, like a teenager facing his first crush. Even now, years later, that feeling hadn't changed.

She didn't look up at me, maintaining that professional distance she'd perfected over the years. "They'll go in the washing machine, then the dryer," she replied matter-of-factly, her tone carrying that subtle edge of impatience I'd grown familiar with.

I felt heat rising to my cheeks. Earlier, when I'd seen her expertly wiping the floor, I'd assumed she was planning to hand-wash my clothes. That's why I tried to stop her-I couldn't bear the thought of her going through such trouble for me, especially now. The awkwardness of our situation hung heavy in the air, like invisible smoke that made it hard to breathe.

"I don't want to waste time," she said, her voice carrying a hint of irritation that made my heart sink. How different it was from the way she used to speak to me, when her words were filled with warmth and possibility.

I reluctantly let go of the clothes, but regret hit me instantly when I saw her pull out my boxers from the pile. My face burned hotter than the shower I'd just stepped out of. The bathroom's fluorescent lights seemed to spotlight my embarrassment.

"Underwear should be washed separately," she stated clinically, as if discussing the weather forecast. "Can you wash it yourself? If not, it should go in the trash." The casual way she discussed something so personal made me wonder: had she truly moved on, to be able to speak about such intimate things with such detachment?

"Let's just throw it away," she continued, not waiting for my response. "It would be too much trouble for you to come back here just to pick up one pair of boxers." Without hesitation, she tossed my underwear into the nearby trash bin, her decision as final as the soft thud it made hitting the bottom.

I could only press my lips together, words failing me as they often did around her. The small bathroom suddenly felt suffocating, despite the lingering steam from my shower having mostly dissipated.

She gathered up my remaining clothes and headed for the door. As she passed by me in the confined space, her familiar scent washed over me-that elegant perfume I remembered so vividly from that night. The night she'd tried to seduce me, when she'd made herself vulnerable, only for me to push her away. Even though the fragrance had triggered my allergies back then, its power over me had been undeniable. Only my deeply-held principles had given me the strength to resist.

All these years, I'd tried desperately to forget the tears in her eyes, the devastation on her face when I rejected her. But that perfume-it brought everything rushing back with cruel clarity. Now she wore it again, but for someone else. For Drew. Had she finally moved past our history enough to reclaim this scent as her own? After all, for so long after that night, she'd stopped wearing it completely.

I felt my lips curve into what must have been a pathetic attempt at a smile, even as my vision blurred with unwanted tears. The bathroom mirror showed me a man I barely recognized, someone still haunted by the ghosts of his choices.

After drying my hair, I stepped out into the living room. The space felt vast and empty without her presence-she was probably in the bedroom with Drew, taking care of him in his drunken state. As his girlfriend, that was her place now, not here with me in this awkward limbo of what-ifs and might-have-beens.

I stood frozen in the center of the living room, feeling like an intruder in a space that held too many memories. The modern furniture and tasteful decor seemed to mock me with their permanence, while my presence here was temporary, unwanted. 

Should I sit down? How long should I wait? I didn't dare ask her these questions. My uncertainty kept me rooted to the spot, as still as the decorative plants that adorned the corners of the room.



Eleanor's POV

I picked up the empty mug that Drew had just used for his honey water and headed to the kitchen to wash it. After finishing, I noticed Jace still standing awkwardly in the same spot. "That room is the laundry room," I said, gesturing towards the door. "Your clothes should be ready in about an hour. Once they're dried, you can leave. I'm heading to bed."

I could sense Jace's discomfort at my presence, as if every moment I spent in his line of sight made him increasingly uneasy. The air between us felt thick with unspoken words and lingering regret.

"Alright," he nodded quickly, seeming almost relieved to have been given clear instructions. His eagerness to agree only confirmed my suspicion that he couldn't wait to leave. The tension in his shoulders spoke volumes about how much he wanted to escape this unexpected situation.

I retreated to my bedroom, closing the door behind me without looking back to see his expression. Sleep wasn't coming easily, especially knowing Drew was still feeling unwell from the drinking. His earlier bout of sickness meant I needed to keep checking on him.

"Water..." Drew mumbled, shifting uncomfortably on the bed.

"Do you want some water?" I moved closer, studying his pale face with concern.

"Water..." he repeated, his voice weak and slightly raspy.

"Just a moment." I hadn't expected him to still be so thirsty, which was why I hadn't prepared more honey water earlier.

Stepping out of the bedroom, I found the living room eerily empty. Jace was nowhere to be seen. Had he left already? I glanced around briefly but Drew's need for water took priority over my curiosity about Jace's whereabouts.

I quickly prepared another mug of warm honey water, then returned to help Drew drink it. His eyes were unfocused as he looked at me, taking several long moments before recognition dawned in his gaze.

"Eleanor, I'm sorry..." he murmured, apparently aware enough to feel guilty about how the evening had turned out. We were supposed to be celebrating his birthday together, but instead, I was playing nurse to his drunk self.

"I'm not going to scold you now," I said, trying to keep my voice stern despite the fondness creeping in. "But once you're sober, you're in for it!"

"I'll make it up to you..." he promised, his expression filled with genuine remorse.

"You better. But right now, you need to take care of yourself. Come on, eat the sweet rice balls I made for you."

"Not hungry..."

"Are you going to eat them or not?" I raised an eyebrow, using my best no-nonsense tone.

"Yes," Drew complied meekly.

I couldn't help but smile. Drew's naturally boyish features always made him look especially vulnerable when he was apologetic, and right now, with that slight pout and guilty expression, he was stirring my protective instincts. I reached out and gently pinched his cheek, feeling the soft warmth beneath my fingers.

After taking the bowl to wash it, I still didn't see Jace. Had he really left? His clothes couldn't possibly be dry yet.

Walking toward the laundry room, I found him leaning against the counter, his eyes fixed intently on the spinning dryer as if willing it to finish faster. The intensity of his gaze suggested he couldn't wait to escape this awkward situation.

I was about to turn away when he looked back, our eyes meeting in an unexpected moment of connection.

"I was just checking if you'd left," I explained quickly, already stepping back. "The clothes should be done soon. Keep waiting."

"Eleanor..." he called out softly, his voice barely above a whisper.

I paused, looking at him. "Yes?"

"You and Drew seem very happy together." He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes.

"Does that make you happy?" I asked, studying his expression carefully.

"No..." The word seemed to escape before he could stop it.

"I should thank you, actually," I said, my voice steady despite the emotion building in my chest. "If you hadn't rejected me, I might never have realized how wonderful Drew is. I might never have known that I could love someone this deeply, this completely."
###chapter 242
Jace's POV

I felt my throat tighten as I tried to swallow, fighting to maintain my composure. Every muscle in my body seemed to tense as I struggled to keep my emotions in check, afraid that if I let even a hint slip through, the carefully constructed walls would come crashing down.

"I suppose you're surprised about Drew and me?" Eleanor said, her eyes meeting mine with a gentle directness that made my chest ache. "You know, Drew has actually loved me for years. He kept it hidden all this time because he knew how I felt about you. He was afraid that if he confessed, he'd lose even our friendship. It wasn't until I hit rock bottom that he finally showed his true feelings. He risked everything to help me get back on my feet before he finally told me how he felt."

I stood there in silence, listening to her talk about her relationship with Drew. The fluorescent lights of the laundry room cast harsh shadows across her face, but they couldn't hide the soft smile that appeared whenever she mentioned his name.

"If it weren't for Drew, I wouldn't be the person I am today," she continued, her voice taking on a slight tremor. She explained how Drew had arrived just in time to save her from what could have been a catastrophic situation. The entertainment industry had shown her its darkest side, and she'd learned harsh lessons about human nature. The gratitude in her voice was unmistakable as she described how Drew had appeared precisely when she needed someone most.

"I'm truly grateful that after everything I've been through, I finally found the right person," Eleanor's lips curved into an unconscious smile. "Jace, I used to hate you so much. I hated your indifference, hated that you couldn't love me back, and yes, I even hated that you chose to walk away when I was at my lowest point."

She paused, drawing a deep breath before continuing, "But now I'm thankful for your coldness. Without it, I might have spent my entire life trapped in your shadow, missing out on what I have with Drew."

"Take your time," she said softly, then turned and walked away.

I didn't try to stop her. Perhaps this was the best ending for us both - no love, no hatred, just peaceful acceptance. Time would flow on, and we would likely never meet again.

I watched her retreating figure, feeling a small smile tug at my lips. Her happiness was what mattered now. My feelings were irrelevant.

After what seemed like an eternity, the washing machine finally stopped its cycle. I mechanically removed my clothes and changed out of Drew's borrowed sleepwear. I folded his clothes carefully, placing them in the laundry basket.

Once dressed, I made my way through the living room, intending to leave. Suddenly, a loud crash echoed from the bedroom - a heavy, alarming sound that made my heart jump.

Without thinking, I rushed toward the bedroom, my hand instinctively turning the unlocked doorknob. As the door swung open, I froze at the sight before me: Drew had Eleanor pinned to the floor in what appeared to be an intimate moment. I immediately turned away, my face burning.

The scene replayed in my mind as I stood there, back turned to the doorway. I had acted purely on instinct when I heard the crash, rushing in without consideration. Now, I found myself an unwitting witness to a private moment between them.

The air grew thick with awkward tension as I stammered out an apology. "I... I heard a crash. I thought..." My voice trailed off, the words feeling inadequate and foolish.

"It's okay," Drew's voice came from behind me, surprisingly calm. "Eleanor tripped over my guitar stand. I tried to catch her."

"I'm so clumsy," Eleanor added with a nervous laugh. I could hear them getting to their feet, the rustle of clothing as they adjusted themselves.

I kept my back turned, my mind racing with conflicting emotions. The protective instinct that had made me rush in now felt misplaced, almost intrusive. It was a stark reminder that I no longer had any right to be concerned for her safety - that role belonged to Drew now.

"I should go," I managed to say, my voice sounding strained even to my own ears. "I'm sorry for barging in."


Eleanor's POV

"Jace!" I called out suddenly, stopping him as he tried to make a quick exit from the room. My voice echoed slightly in the hallway of my apartment, carrying more emotion than I'd intended.

He paused mid-stride, his broad shoulders tensing visibly under his navy blazer. "I didn't mean to intrude on your evening..." His voice was soft, controlled, holding back something I couldn't quite read.

Breathing heavily, I pushed aside whatever complicated feelings were threatening to surface. "I need your help. Drew needs to use the bathroom." The words came out in a rush, driven by immediate necessity rather than the thousand other things I wanted to say.

The situation had spiraled quickly out of control. Just moments ago, Drew had attempted to stand up to go to the bathroom, and I'd tried to help him. But he was far more intoxicated than I'd realized. When I attempted to support his weight, he'd stumbled, completely losing his balance, and crashed right into me. We'd both gone down, with Drew's full weight landing on top of me. Now he was sprawled across my body, and I couldn't even manage to crawl out from under him.

Jace hesitated for just a moment before walking over to us. I watched as he carefully maneuvered his way around the coffee table, his movements deliberate and measured. With considerable effort, he managed to lift Drew's dead weight off me. Drew swayed dangerously on his feet, his eyes unfocused.

"Eleanor..." Drew's words were slurred as he tried to focus on my face. "Did I hurt you? Eleanor..."

"I'm fine," I gasped, still trying to catch my breath. My hip throbbing from where it had hit the hardwood floor. Mentally, I was cursing Drew's drinking - he'd obviously had way too much at the office party.

"Bathroom?" Jace asked simply, his arm firmly around Drew's waist to keep him upright.

Drew's head lolled slightly, his usual sharp wit completely dulled by alcohol. He seemed barely aware of his surroundings.

"Yes, please," I nodded, picking myself up from the floor with as much dignity as I could muster.

I followed them to the bathroom, watching as Jace carefully maneuvered Drew inside. Drew stood swaying in front of the toilet, fumbling unsuccessfully with his belt buckle, his fingers clumsy and uncoordinated.

"Did he manage?" I asked, stepping closer to the doorway.

"Stay outside," Jace said quickly, positioning himself to block my view. His voice was firm but not unkind.

"I can't... can't get it..." Drew's voice was frustrated, almost childlike in his current state.

Without thinking, I offered, "I can help him with-"

"I've got it," Jace cut me off sharply, then seemed to catch himself. His voice softened. "Just... wait outside for a moment, please."

I could hear Jace murmuring quiet instructions to Drew, the sound of a belt being unbuckled, fabric rustling. The whole situation felt surreal - my ex-fiancé helping my current boyfriend in such an intimate moment of vulnerability.

"There we go," Jace's voice carried through the door, followed by the sound of running water.

I stepped back from the doorway, my face burning as I realized how inappropriate my offer to help had been. In my concern for Drew, I hadn't thought through the implications. If Jace hadn't been there... I pushed the thought away.

Several long minutes passed before I heard the toilet flush and more water running. Jace had apparently taken it upon himself to help Drew clean up thoroughly - washing his face, hands, and even helping him rinse off a bit. I could hear the gentle splashing of water and Jace's patient instructions.

"Eleanor?" Jace called out. "Could you bring his sleepwear? He needs to change."

I quickly grabbed the spare set of pajamas I kept for Drew - simple cotton pants and a t-shirt - and handed them through the partially opened door, careful to keep my eyes averted.

Jace didn't comment on the well-worn nature of the clothes or ask why I had men's pajamas ready. He simply took them and proceeded to help Drew change. When they finally emerged, Drew was clean and dressed for bed, though still obviously drunk. Jace's forehead was beaded with sweat from the effort of managing my boyfriend's dead weight, his breathing slightly labored.

I picked up a glass of water from the kitchen counter and held it out to him. "Here, you should drink something."

He looked up at me, his familiar hazel eyes meeting mine for a moment before he accepted the glass with a quiet, "Thank you."

The atmosphere shifted immediately, becoming thick with unspoken words and shared history. The last time we'd been alone in this apartment, things had been very different between us.

"It's late," I said quickly, breaking the tension. "You should head home. I can take care of Drew from here. And... thank you for tonight. For everything."

"Of course," he replied softly. "Drew is a friend."

"Still, it's late," I repeated, my tone making it clear that it was time for him to leave.

I walked him to the front door, maintaining a careful distance. When he turned back at the threshold, looking like he wanted to say something more, I closed the door firmly but gently. Standing there in the darkness of my entryway, I could almost feel him still standing on the other side, separated by just a few inches of wood.

Finally, I heard his footsteps retreating down the hallway, and I let out a breath I hadn't realized I'd been holding.
###chapter 243
Eleanor's POV

I was preparing breakfast in my open-concept kitchen when Drew finally woke up. I watched as he pushed back the covers, his face a picture of confusion as he took in his surroundings, taking several moments to realize he was in my apartment. 

When his eyes found me, I offered him a smile. I knew my eyes crinkled at the corners when I smiled like that-it was the kind of smile that always seemed to melt his defenses.

"Finally awake?" I asked, keeping my voice light and teasing.

"Last night, I..." he trailed off, running a hand through his disheveled hair.

"You drank like there was no tomorrow," I finished for him, my tone matter-of-fact but gentle.

"I... it's all Spencer's fault, that devil," he growled, channeling all his frustration toward Spencer Sherwood.

I set two plates of breakfast on the table. "Enough of that. You spent all night cursing him already-his ears must be burning. Just don't drink like that again, okay?"

"Okay," he nodded obediently, like a chastised child.

As he started eating, he immediately launched into his usual exaggerated praise: "This is amazing, absolutely incredible, the best breakfast in the world..."

I gave him a pointed look. Asking Drew to judge my cooking was like asking a fish to critique air quality.

"How did I get here last night?" he asked suddenly, between mouthfuls of food.

My hands tightened imperceptibly around my utensils, but I kept my voice casual as I replied, "Jace brought you."

His eyes widened at this revelation, and I quickly explained, "He would have found out eventually anyway." Then, remembering something important, I added with a touch of worry, "Oh no, I forgot to tell Jace not to mention this to anyone. If your mother finds out..."

"Jace knows how to be discreet," Drew interrupted, his trust in his friend absolute. "He understands what should and shouldn't be said."

Just then, his phone rang. He hurried to the bedroom to answer it, and I heard him say "Mom" in a tone that told me everything I needed to know. From his expression, I could tell Vivian was furious on the other end.

I continued eating my breakfast at a leisurely pace, watching as he gestured to me before stepping out onto the balcony. Despite his attempts to keep his voice down, I could still hear him defending our relationship.

When he returned, we chatted briefly, and he even volunteered to wash the dishes. I thought we might actually get to enjoy a quiet morning together, but then his mother called again, threatening that if he didn't come home immediately, he'd "regret it for the rest of his life."

Watching him prepare to leave, I felt a familiar ache in my chest, but I managed a soft "okay." Before he left, he promised fervently that he'd return that evening, declaring his love for me with the passion that always made my heart flutter despite my better judgment.

"I love you too," I smiled as I watched him leave.

I spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon in the apartment, waiting for his return. But when the doorbell rang later that afternoon, it wasn't Drew standing outside-it was Vivian. My smile froze on my face as I took in her imperious presence.

She stood there in the hallway, her posture rigid and her eyes cold as winter frost. The silence between us stretched taut like a wire about to snap. Her expression made my stomach clench with apprehension.

We held each other's gaze for what felt like an eternity. Time seemed to stand still in the heavy silence.

"Eleanor Yates." Vivian finally spoke, her eyes scanning me from head to toe, searching for changes in my appearance since she'd last seen me. I could feel her cataloging every detail, every subtle difference from the woman I used to be.

"You came looking for me?" I asked, fighting to keep my voice steady.

"Who else would I be here for? Drew?" The sarcasm in her voice was unmistakable. Of course, her presence here meant she already knew about my relationship with Drew Yeager. Nothing stays secret for long in our circles.

"Come in," I invited her, gesturing toward the living room. "Don't bother with shoes. I don't keep extra slippers around."

She entered my home, her critical gaze sweeping across every corner. The apartment wasn't large or particularly luxurious, but I had made it cozy and inviting. I watched as she settled onto the sofa, her posture rigid and formal. I poured her a glass of water, noting the subtle surprise that flickered across her face. Perhaps she hadn't expected me to have learned to be so... domestic after everything that had happened to my family.

"Drew bought this place?" she asked with calculated indifference.

"Yes." I answered directly. There was no point in hiding it. For someone like her, discovering the owner of this apartment would have been child's play.

"How long have you and Drew been together?"

"Three, maybe four months."

"So... right after your family's situation changed, he swooped in." She did the mental calculation, her voice taking on an edge.

"More or less." I kept my response neutral.

"Drew certainly knows how to seize an opportunity, doesn't he?" The bitterness in her tone was unmistakable.

I pressed my lips together, choosing silence over defense. What could I say that wouldn't sound like justification?

"I won't approve of this relationship." Her words came sharp and clear, exactly as I had expected. Even without considering my current circumstances, my previous connection to Clara Harrington alone would have been enough reason for her disapproval.

"I know it might not carry much weight now, but what Drew and I have is real. Your unilateral rejection of our relationship will only make him resent you." I met her gaze steadily.

She studied me intently, and I could feel her reassessing me. Despite losing everything that once defined my social status, I maintained my composure, my eyes unwavering, accepting my new reality without shame.

"You grew up in our world, Eleanor. Between his momentary resentment and his future prospects, which do you think I value more?" Her question hung in the air between us, heavy with implication.

I bit my lip, all too familiar with our society's obsession with suitable marriages. The unwritten rules that governed our world hadn't changed just because my circumstances had.

"If not for your... unfortunate situation, I would have gladly blessed your union with Drew. I genuinely liked you, Eleanor. Not just for your former status, but for who you were. And I'll be honest with you - Clara is currently introducing her daughter Maeve to my son. I've met Maeve, and truthfully, she doesn't hold a candle to you in any aspect."

My expression flickered at this revelation. I was surprised that Clara would try to match Maeve with Drew. While Drew might act carefree and irreverent at times, his family's influence was undeniable. I understood Clara's strategy - she wanted to ensure Maeve would have a powerful male ally besides herself as she established her position in Manhattan society.

Every move, every calculation, all centered around Maeve's success.

I pressed my lips together again, forcing my features into a mask of indifference. But inside, my thoughts were churning.

I sat there, watching as Vivian said, "The difference in our social standings makes it impossible for me to let Drew choose you over Maeve," while reaching into her purse to pull out a bank card.

Looking at the card she held out, I couldn't help but laugh-a bitter, ironic laugh. How absurd that I would find myself in such a melodramatic situation, being paid off like some character in a soap opera.

"There's half a million in there. It's not a small sum for someone in your position," Vivian said.
###chapter 244
Eleanor's POV

She wasn't wrong. For most people, it would be enough to live on for years. Even with my current lifestyle, it would last quite a while.

"I'm not trying to insult you," she continued, her voice softening. "I just want to offer some compensation. I've known you since you were little, remember? You used to call me auntie. Having no daughter of my own, I truly cherished you back then." There was genuine regret in her voice as she reminisced about the past.

But my resolve was firm: "I won't take it, and I won't leave Drew." Even if someone held a knife to my throat, I wouldn't give him up. With Drew, my mind was made up. I knew he felt the same way about me.

"Aren't you afraid that Drew will end up with nothing, just like you?" Her eyes bore into mine.

"My relationship with Drew has nothing to do with money. Money is just an added bonus-one we can live without," I replied, emphasizing each word.

"You've experienced having nothing before, haven't you?"

I bit my lip, remembering those desperate days when I nearly sold myself to make ends meet. That kind of desperation could drive anyone mad.

Then she dropped a bombshell: "I'm not trying to frighten you or make up lies. Drew isn't his father's only son. Charles has another son, only ten years old, born to another woman."

I froze. Hadn't everyone said Charles and Vivian were childhood sweethearts with an unbreakable bond?

As if reading my thoughts, she said, "Public rumors aren't always reliable. This is why I want Drew to be with Maeve. Their union would secure Drew's position, ensuring his inheritance remains intact. If Drew chooses you, knowing Charles's temperament, he'll be cut off completely."

She continued: "I don't doubt that you could survive together in poverty, or question the authenticity of your feelings. But for Drew's future, I have to intervene. Don't think me cruel-I have my own reputation to maintain in society. If Drew's choices lead to my downfall and public humiliation, I'll use my death to make him regret it. Don't think I'm just threatening you-I always follow through on my words."

I stared at her, remembering what Clara had once told me: Vivian was a woman of steel beneath her gentle exterior. When pushed to the edge, she was capable of anything.

"Eleanor, I don't know how much of what I've said has gotten through to you, but please think carefully. Is it worth destroying Drew's future, possibly even stepping over my dead body, all for what you call love?"

My eyes burning with tears, I demanded, "Why must you force this choice? Have you ever truly loved someone?"

"Yes, I have. And what came of it?" she smiled, though tears seemed to glimmer in her eyes. "He still betrayed me. Tell me, how long can love stay fresh? When Charles and I were first in love, he would stay awake for days just to surprise me. Even that passionate love couldn't withstand time's erosion. I'm not dismissing what you and Drew have, but I want you to consider: if your love eventually fades into mundane routine, do you think Drew won't regret choosing you? Giving up everything for you?"

I bit my lip harder. I didn't have an answer. All I knew was that right now, I couldn't bear to leave Drew, and I was certain he wouldn't leave me either. Otherwise, Vivian would have confronted him directly instead of coming to me.

But she had a point. Years from now, would Drew truly never regret giving up everything for me? Would I forever carry the guilt of causing him to lose everything, even his family's support? I knew too well the pain of being abandoned by family-it was a wound that never truly healed.

Vivian rose to leave. "I'll come see you tomorrow," she said. "For now, I hope you'll keep this meeting from Drew. At least until you've had time to think everything through."

As a woman who had navigated the highest circles of Manhattan society for decades, Vivian carried herself with practiced grace and deliberate purpose. Just as she turned to leave, I found myself blurting out the words that shattered my own heart: "I'm going to leave Drew."

The moment those words left my lips, I lost all composure. Tears streamed down my face uncontrollably. Vivian turned back to look at me, and I could see the genuine sympathy in her eyes. But we both understood the cruel reality of our situation - some things simply couldn't be changed, no matter how much we wished they could be.

She returned to the couch and held out a plain white envelope. "Take it," she said softly.

I stared at the envelope, and she continued, "Accepting this doesn't diminish your love for Drew. If anything, your decision to walk away proves just how deeply you care for him. Please, take it - it will help ease my conscience, at least a little."

When she tried to press the envelope into my hands, my first instinct was to refuse. But her next words made me hesitate: "Otherwise, how will you convince Drew that this breakup is real?"

My fingers clenched involuntarily, but I managed to say, "I have a better way. One that will ensure he never wants to see me again."

"Then consider this my way of thanking you," she replied. "I know your situation, Eleanor. Having resources will never hurt, and if it makes you feel better, think of it as a loan. You can pay me back when you're able."

I looked up at her, and she added, "I'm not a saint, but I'm not heartless either. Eleanor, sometimes I wish you really were Clara's daughter. Things would be so different then."

I couldn't help but laugh - a broken sound that quickly dissolved into more tears. Yes, I too had prayed countless times that this was all just a nightmare, that I would wake up and still be Clara Harrington's daughter, still part of the Harrington family.

Before leaving, she said, "If you ever truly need help, you can come to me. I can offer that much without worrying about Clara's approval."

Watching her walk away, I thought about how Vivian wasn't really the cold, unbreakable person she pretended to be. Life had forced that armor onto her, made her build walls to protect herself.

After she left, I stared at the envelope in my hands, fresh tears falling. This morning, Drew had left with such excitement in his eyes. Who could have known that brief goodbye would be our last?

My phone lit up with a message from Drew: "I'll be home by 8 PM."

My vision blurred with tears, making it nearly impossible to read the words on the screen. I could only imagine how happy and excited he must have been while typing that message. How much pain would he feel when he discovered what I was about to do?

Wiping my eyes, I picked up my phone, forcing myself to ignore his message. With trembling fingers, I found the right contact and began typing. It took me a long time to compose that message, and even longer to find the courage to send it.

I knew that once I hit send, everything between Drew and me would be over. He would hate me for the rest of his life.

Finally, I pressed send.

As I closed my eyes, tears poured down my face like a broken dam. I finally understood that when misfortune strikes, it truly never comes alone. That brief happiness I'd experienced had been nothing more than a mirage.

I knew, with crushing certainty, that I would never be truly happy again. Never be loved again. The weight of this realization pressed down on my chest like a physical thing, making it hard to breathe through my tears.
###chapter 245
Eleanor's POV

Half an hour had passed.

When the doorbell rang, I had already forced myself to calm down. Or at least, I tried to convince myself I had. I'd wiped away my tears, washed my face, changed into fresh clothes, and even applied some light makeup. I reached for my perfume out of habit but decided against it at the last moment.

Opening the door, I found Jace Gillard standing there, still catching his breath. I hadn't sent him any alarming messages-just a simple text: "Need to talk to you at my place. Come as soon as you can. Let me know when you get this." 

He replied instantly: "On my way." And true to his word, here he was. I'm not sure why, but I knew with certainty he would come. Perhaps because he's always felt indebted to me somehow. I didn't want to dwell on that anymore.

"Come in," I said.

Jace studied my face with concern. "What happened? Have you been crying?"

And here I thought I'd hidden it well.

"Did you have a fight with Drew?" he asked worriedly. "Should I call him? I know Drew can be impulsive sometimes, but his heart's in the right place. Try not to take it too personally-"

"We didn't fight," I said, watching as he frantically pulled out his phone to call Drew.

"But I'm going to break up with him."

Jace froze. He stared at me as if he'd misheard.

"Did... something happen?" He tried to keep his voice steady, but I could hear the slight tremor. Not that I was particularly focused on his reactions right now.

"Drew's mother came to see me," I said plainly. There was no point in hiding it. If I was asking for his help, he deserved the truth.

Jace seemed to grasp something. "Have you talked to Drew about this?"

"If I had, would I be calling you here?" I shot him an irritated look, his excessive concern getting on my nerves.

"I think this is something you should discuss with Drew properly," he suggested earnestly, despite sensing my impatience.

"And what good would that do? Make Drew give up everything for me? Have him go through what I did, being ostracized by everyone he knows?"

"Drew's situation is different. He's a Yeager-his family would never truly abandon him."

"Did you know Drew has a half-brother?" I asked. Seeing him flinch slightly, I continued, "The Yeagers have a backup heir. They absolutely could cast Drew aside."

"But I don't think Drew would choose family wealth over you just because-"

"Vivian would threaten to kill herself," I said, struggling to keep my emotions in check. "She's never gotten over the fact that Drew has a half-brother out there. She won't allow any illegitimate child to claim the family fortune. If Drew turns against his family for me, it would mean Vivian has lost everything. Given her personality, she really might end her life in front of Drew."

Looking at the silent Jace, I asked my final question: "Can any relationship bear the weight of a life? Can there be any hope or happiness when it's built on such a foundation?"

I've truly accepted my fate. All my luck in life was used up before I turned twenty-five. I don't know what's left for me in the years ahead.

I knew Jace had already guessed my intentions. Just as expected, he spoke first: "So you called me here because you want to use me to break up with Drew? Is that it?"

"Yes," I admitted directly, wrapping my arms around myself as I stood by the window of my apartment, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the hardwood floors. "If I'm going to leave, I want to make it absolute. I don't want to give Drew any hope, and I don't want to leave myself any way back. Drew knows I once had feelings for you. If you help me put on this little performance, he'll believe I never truly loved him."

Jace didn't immediately agree. I could see him lost in thought, probably trying to find a better solution, one that wouldn't force us into such an irreversible position. The way he stood there, leaning against my kitchen counter, his expression distant, told me he was probably wondering if Drew's eventual inheritance would be enough to make Vivian accept me.

Watching him think so deeply, I couldn't help but ask with a bitter smile, "You don't want to help, do you?"

I'd anticipated his reluctance. After all, helping me would mean betraying the brotherhood between him and Drew. And Jace, well, he'd always been someone who put his own interests first.

He started trying to reason with me: "I just think maybe things haven't reached such an extreme point yet. Vivian's opposition to your relationship with Drew stems from her concern about him angering his father and losing his inheritance. But if Drew starts taking his responsibilities seriously now, if he proves himself capable, his father won't need to force him into a arranged marriage."

I let out a laugh that held no humor, turning to face him fully. "You've worked with the Harringtons for years. Do you really think it's just about inheritance? Isn't this about social class, something deeply rooted in Manhattan's elite circles? With my current status, what right do I have to marry into the Yeager family?"

He persisted, pushing away from the counter to step closer. "I don't see anything wrong with your status. If Drew loves you, that proves you're worthy of being with him. All this talk about social standing is just an excuse. Real love can overcome any barrier, even..."

I cut him off, my emotions rising to the surface: "But I'm still the person Clara hates most in this world. Will Clara ever let Drew and me be together? Especially now, when she's determined to set him up with Maeve! If she finds out about my relationship with Drew, I can't even imagine what measures she'll take against me!"

He continued trying to persuade me: "Regardless, I still think you shouldn't make such a hasty decision. Matters of the heart shouldn't be rushed. I suggest you talk to Drew openly, work things out together. There's always a solution..."

I couldn't hold back anymore, my voice cracking as I asked, "Jace, are you afraid I'll end up alone?"

I saw the pain flash across his face, but I pressed on, my words dripping with sarcasm: "Are you afraid that if no one loves me anymore, I'll come running back to you? Is that why you're so desperate to prevent me from breaking up with Drew?"

I felt tears burning behind my eyes, but I maintained my bitter smile, though I wasn't even sure why I was smiling anymore.

He tried to explain: "That's not it at all. I just think you and Drew have something special, and throwing it away because of external pressure isn't right. Making hasty decisions about love... you'll regret it."

I couldn't bear to hear any more of his noble sentiments: "That's my business. I didn't call you here for advice or to hear your philosophical views about love conquering all. I called you here because I need you to help me put on this show, to make Drew believe that you've always been the one I loved, that my feelings for him were just gratitude."

I'd already promised Vivian, made my choice. Maybe I would regret it, but I had no other options.

Seeing him about to speak again, I finally broke down, my voice barely above a whisper: "Jace, why is it so difficult to ask you for just one thing? I've never felt so powerless with anyone else. But with you, no matter what I do, no matter what I ask of you, you always refuse. Tell me, how much do you despise me? What is it about me that disgusts you so much?"
###chapter 246
Jace's POV

My throat constricted as I watched Eleanor, my clenched fists trembling slightly. The look of desperation in her eyes pierced through my heart like a thousand needles, leaving me speechless. The golden afternoon light streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows cast long shadows across her face, making her expression even more haunting.

"If there was anyone else who could help me, I wouldn't be asking you," she said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper. The elaborate crystal chandelier above cast dancing shadows on her face as she continued, "But right now, you're the only one who can convince Drew that I don't love him." She paused, a bitter smile playing at her corners of her lips. "It's pathetic, isn't it? Twenty-five years of life, and I've only truly loved two people. If only I had one more choice... just one more."

I fought to control the emotions surging through my body, every muscle tense with the effort. The words felt like lead in my mouth as I forced them out: "I'll help you."

She just looked at me, her gaze steady and unflinching. There was no gratitude in her eyes, no relief. Why should there be? I was only agreeing because she had backed me into a corner, leaving me no choice. The weight of her request hung heavy in the air between us, filling the spacious living room with unspoken tension.

"Thank you," she said softly. I knew this wasn't genuine appreciation-it was acknowledgment of my reluctant compliance despite my obvious discomfort.

The evening settled around us, the city lights beginning to twinkle outside the windows. At just before eight, the electronic door chime echoed through the apartment. I could hear the keypad beeping as someone entered the security code, each number a countdown to what was about to happen.

We remained seated on the plush leather sofa, waiting for Drew's arrival. Eleanor had warned me earlier that she would need to take some liberties, pushing boundaries to make this convincing. She'd asked me to endure it, no matter how uncomfortable it might become.

Now, she moved closer, her arm sliding around my neck. She deliberately decreased the space between us, creating an image of intimacy. My body instinctively stiffened, but I knew this was exactly the reaction she was counting on. The scent of her perfume-subtle notes of jasmine and vanilla-filled my senses, making it harder to maintain my composure.

I could feel her unwavering determination despite my obvious resistance. This was her selfishness showing through-when it came to the person she truly cared about, their feelings took precedence over everything else. She was more concerned with ensuring Drew would finally let her go than anything else.

As the sound of the door lock disengaging echoed through the apartment, her lips met mine. In that moment, my heart threatened to burst from my chest, my hands hanging uselessly at my sides, balled into tight fists. My mind went completely blank, barely registering that this entire performance was for someone else's benefit.

All my senses focused on the softness of her lips against mine, the contact sending electric currents through my entire body. I had lost count of how many times I'd dreamed of this moment, only to wake up with tears staining my pillow. The reality was both sweeter and more painful than any dream had been.

I remained frozen, afraid to move a muscle. I had no idea what kind of reaction she was hoping to elicit, and I feared that any response from me would be too much for her to handle. So I fought against every instinct, every desire, leaving all control in her hands. The weight of unspoken words and suppressed emotions filled the space between us, making the air thick with tension.

The sound of footsteps in the hallway grew closer, each step echoing like a drumbeat counting down to the inevitable moment when Drew would walk through that door. 

I could feel Eleanor's heartbeat racing where her chest pressed against mine, though her exterior remained calm and deliberate. This close, I could see the slight tremor in her hands, the only sign that this was affecting her as much as it was affecting me.




Eleanor's POV

The moment the door swung fully open, I saw Drew standing there. The smile on his face froze instantly, transforming into an expression I'll never forget. His eyes, usually bright with mischief, began to glisten with tears, but he didn't move. He didn't storm away, didn't demand answers, didn't even make a sound to interrupt us. He just stood there, watching as I deliberately kissed Jace Gillard.

Through my peripheral vision, I could see Drew's rigid silhouette in the doorway. I could imagine the devastation coursing through him. To be honest, part of me wished he would rush forward, push us apart, even slap me. But he did nothing - just stood there, suffering in silence, his breathing becoming increasingly labored with each passing second.

My eyes trembled slightly before I closed them, feeling hot tears escape down my cheeks. Instead of pulling away, I deepened the kiss with Jace. What had started as a butterfly-light touch transformed into something more intimate as I deliberately parted my lips, letting my tongue explore his mouth. I felt him shudder at the unexpected intensity, his whole body tensing with surprise and uncertainty.

The taste of coffee lingered on his lips - he must have been working late again, fueling himself with caffeine. My tongue carefully traced his, dancing in a slow, deliberate rhythm that made his breath catch. His heartbeat accelerated; I could feel it where my hand rested against his chest. The silk of his tie brushed against my wrist as I moved closer, eliminating what little space remained between us.

Jace remained frozen, clearly fighting every instinct to respond. His hands stayed firmly at his sides, though I could feel the tremors running through his body. The scent of his cologne - subtle and clean - filled my senses as I pressed closer, deepening the kiss further. The tension in his jaw betrayed his internal struggle, matching the war raging in my own heart.

I knew this was wrong. Every cell in my body screamed at the betrayal I was committing. But I couldn't stop. The forbidden nature of it all, the knowledge that Drew was watching, the way Jace's breath hitched when my fingers curled into his shirt - it was intoxicating and devastating all at once.

The crystal decanter on the side table caught the evening light, casting fractured rainbows across the room. They danced over Drew's face, highlighting the anguish etched into every line. 

Suddenly, rough hands grabbed my shoulders, yanking me backward. The violent movement sent my earrings jingling, the sound absurdly delicate in the charged atmosphere.

"WHAM!" 

The thunderous crash of flesh meeting flesh echoed through the room.

I watched, heart in my throat, as Drew's fist connected with Jace's face. The impact sent Jace stumbling backward, his hand automatically rising to touch his rapidly swelling cheek. But he didn't retaliate. He just stood there, meeting Drew's gaze steadily, accepting the punishment as if he believed he deserved it.

Drew's entire body trembled with barely contained rage. His knuckles were white where they clenched into fists, his expensive watch glinting as his arms shook. The setting sun streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows cast long shadows across his face, highlighting the tears he was fighting to hold back.

"She's my girlfriend, Jace!" 

Drew's voice cracked with emotion. "My girlfriend!" The words echoed off the modern art adorning the walls, bouncing back to hit us all like physical blows.
###chapter 247
Eleanor's POV

Jace stood there in silence. I had asked him not to speak, wanting to be the one to explain everything. The familiar scent of jasmine from my garden wafted through the half-open window, a cruel reminder of happier times.

"Drew, I'm sorry," I began, my voice trembling despite my best efforts to keep it steady. The words felt like shards of glass in my throat.

Drew turned to face me, his usually cheerful eyes now clouded with understanding as he noticed the tears threatening to spill from mine. The raw guilt in my expression must have told him everything before I could even continue.

"I've realized I still can't forget Jace," I forced myself to meet Drew's gaze, watching the pain bloom in his eyes. Each word felt like a betrayal, but I forced myself to continue. "Yesterday, when Jace drove me home, I... I couldn't control my feelings anymore. I asked him to come here today because I want to start over with him."

My tone remained deliberately cold, a stark contrast to the warm tears now freely streaming down my face. The afternoon sun caught them, turning each drop into a tiny prism of my shame.

"Hah..." Drew's laugh was hollow, a sound that pierced my heart more effectively than any accusation could have.

"Eleanor, am I really that inadequate?" His voice cracked, a sound I'd never heard from him before. "Am I truly so inferior to him? Tell me what I'm lacking, and I'll change. I'll become whoever you want me to be. Please, just tell me what I need to do."

I had never seen Drew like this. In my mind, he had always been the embodiment of confidence and humor, forever ready with a witty remark or a playful smirk. This broken man before me was a stranger wearing Drew's face, and knowing I was responsible for this transformation made everything worse.

Fighting against the growing knot in my chest, I continued, "Drew, no matter how much you change, you'll never be him. You've always known that I've loved him for years... so many years. I thought I could use you to forget him." I paused, swallowing hard. "I overestimated myself. Jace is someone I'll never be able to forget..."

"I don't mind," Drew stepped closer, his eyes filled with an intensity that made my heart ache. "You don't have to forget him. I don't need you to erase your past. I just want to be with you, to stand by your side forever, even after he chose to abandon you."

The setting sun cast an orange glow across his face, highlighting the desperation in his features. I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to hold together the pieces that felt like they were breaking apart.

"I can't keep lying to myself," I stated firmly, though each word felt like acid on my tongue.

"Lying to yourself..." He let out a bitter laugh that seemed to echo off the walls. "So all this time we've been together, it was just self-deception? Every smile, every laugh, every moment of happiness - it was all just an act? When you said you loved me, was that a lie too?"

Tears began rolling down his cheeks, and I knew this pain ran deeper than when he had watched me gravitate toward Jace all those months ago. The setting sun painted his tears golden, a beautiful sight I wished I'd never had to witness.

"I'm sorry," I offered no explanation. Those two words carried the weight of every deception, every false hope I'd given him.

"Has he agreed to be with you?" Drew's question cut through the heavy silence.

I pressed my lips together, the truth stuck in my throat. How could I tell him that I knew Jace and I would never be together? That Jace would never agree to this arrangement? If I lied now and said yes, Drew would soon discover the truth. I couldn't expect Jace to maintain such a charade indefinitely.





I stood there, words failing me completely. In that moment, Jace answered Drew's question for me.

"Yes, we're together now," he said calmly.

I watched as Drew turned to face Jace, his eyes filled with a pain and anger I had never seen before. The warmth that usually characterized his gaze had vanished entirely, replaced by something raw and wounded.

"Jace Gillard," Drew's voice trembled with emotion, "I've always considered you my closest friend. I thought that no matter what happened, the four of us-you, me, Lucas, and Spencer-nothing could ever come between us. I was wrong... I never knew I could hate someone I once called brother this much."

"I'm sorry," was all Jace could manage. Even he seemed at a loss for what else to say in the face of such betrayal.

"We're no longer friends. As far as I'm concerned, Drew Yeager never knew a Jace Gillard."

Before I could react, Drew's fist connected with Jace's face with devastating force. The impact nearly knocked Jace off his feet, causing him to stumble backward. He made no move to defend himself or retaliate.

I instinctively moved to intervene but stopped myself mid-motion. I knew I had no right to step between them, not when I was the cause of this destruction.

"That punch," Drew declared, each word deliberate and heavy, "marks the end of twenty years of friendship!"

He turned to leave, his usually confident stride now unsteady. At the doorway, he paused, one hand gripping the frame as if it were the only thing keeping him upright.

"Jace," his voice softened slightly, though the pain remained evident, "don't make Eleanor suffer anymore. If you truly love her, then love her properly. Be the man she deserves."

Tears blurred my vision as I watched his silhouette in the doorway. A thought crossed my mind: if only things were different, if only I were still who I used to be... But wishes couldn't change reality. There was no way to give Drew and me a better ending.

The door slammed shut with such force that the sound reverberated through my chest, as if physically sealing away a ###chapter of my life. In that moment, the truth hit me with crushing clarity-he had truly loved me. Only real love could hurt this deeply.

An oppressive silence filled the room. Neither Jace nor I spoke. My tears fell silently, one after another, like they would never end. The only sound was the soft ticking of the clock on the wall, marking each second of this endless night.

After what felt like hours, I glanced at the clock-it was past midnight. I turned to look at Jace, who had remained quietly by my side the entire time. The bruises from Drew's punch were beginning to darken on his face, creating an angry pattern across his features.

"Should we go to the hospital?" I asked softly.

He seemed startled by my question, as if only just remembering the injury. "No need. It'll fade in a few days," he replied, his voice equally quiet.

"Thank you," I said, not for the first time that night. As he opened his mouth to respond, I continued, "I don't know how I can ever repay you for this."
###chapter 248
Eleanor's POV

Looking at him in the dim light of my bedroom, my heart was heavy with guilt and complicated emotions. The night air felt thick with unspoken words between us. Outside my window, snow fell silently, each flake a reminder of how this evening had spiraled into something I never expected.

"I don't know how I can ever repay you," I said quietly, my voice rough with emotion. The words felt inadequate, barely scratching the surface of what I really wanted to express. The gentle hum of the heating system provided a backdrop to our tense conversation, making the silence between words even more pronounced.

"You don't need to," Jace replied curtly, his words clipped but his eyes telling a different story. He stood by my window, his silhouette outlined against the falling snow, hands tucked into his pockets in that characteristic way of his.

I couldn't stop myself from continuing, "But because of me, I've damaged your friendship with Drew." The words tumbled out, heavy with regret. I watched as his shoulders tensed slightly at the mention of Drew's name. Their friendship had always seemed unshakeable until I came along and complicated everything.

"It doesn't matter," he responded, still maintaining that frustrating brevity. But I knew better. I'd seen the pain in Drew's eyes earlier that evening, the betrayal written across his face when he discovered what had happened.

The guilt gnawed at me. Their relationship wouldn't be permanently destroyed - friendships like theirs were too strong for that - but knowing I'd caused even a temporary rift between them made everything worse. The weight of it all pressed down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.

"Right," I said bitterly, more to myself than to him. "What could I possibly offer you anyway?" My fingers twisted in the fabric of my sleeve, a nervous habit I'd never managed to break. "I have nothing. No connections, no influence, nothing of value to give you."

"Eleanor..." he said my name softly, almost like a warning.

I lifted my head, forcing myself to meet his gaze directly. The intensity in his grey eyes made my heart skip, but I pressed on. "Would you want my body?"

The words hung in the air between us. I watched as he visibly stiffened, his usual composed expression cracking for just a moment.

"Isn't that how it works in the entertainment industry?" I continued, trying to keep my voice steady despite the tremor I could feel building in my chest. "Trading favors for roles, for publicity? You're a powerful producer - I'm sure you've had plenty of similar offers." The words tasted bitter on my tongue, but I couldn't stop. "There's quite a list of actresses who became famous after working with you."

"I've never done that," he responded immediately, his voice sharp with anger.

I let out a hollow laugh. Who would ever admit to such things? Besides, I knew all too well that he found me repulsive. When I'd kissed him earlier, he hadn't responded at all. Not even the slightest reaction. He could be that indifferent to me.

"I'm just kidding," I said, meeting his eyes again. "You hate me so much - if you slept with me, I'd only be indebted to you even more. And you'd probably worry that I'd use it as an excuse to cling to you..."

Before I could finish, his face suddenly filled my vision. His lips crashed against mine, the kiss deep and demanding. I froze, my mind struggling to process what was happening. Why would Jace Gillard, of all people, kiss me like this? How could he...?

My fingers clenched involuntarily at my sides. This wasn't just a kiss - I could feel the urgency in his touch, the desperation in the way he pulled me closer. None of it made sense. My head spun with confusion and something else I couldn't quite name.

In the quiet of that snowy night, my hands moved to push him away but then faltered, falling back to my sides. Was this a transaction? A moment of regret? Or was I finally surrendering to whatever this was between us?

Outside, the snow continued its silent descent, beautiful and indifferent to the drama unfolding behind my window. My bedroom, once a sanctuary of solitude, now felt charged with electricity and unspoken emotions. The soft lighting cast shadows across his face as he pulled back slightly, his breathing as uneven as my own.
He pushed me onto the bed, his weight holding me down as he kissed me roughly. I could feel him unbuckling his belt. One hand tangled in my hair, the other fumbling with his pants.

His thick cock is between us, and a shiver of excitement runs through me when I think about something so massive fitting inside me.

"Scared?" he asks gently.

I don't answer. A mixture of fear and excitement, both unknown, fill my heart.

He groans and slides the head of his cock into me, tearing through my hymen with a sharp sting that has me hissing out a breath and biting my lower lip. His strong hands cup my sore ass, slowly lowering me onto his cock one thick inch at a time. His eyes never leave mine. He's watching me with an intensity that's as intimate as the feel of his cock inside me. 

He lets out a deep groan when tears fall down my cheeks at the delicious pain of him spreading me wider than I've ever been. My pussy is clenched so tightly around him, and I'm guessing it's only because of how unbelievably wet I am that he's able to get inside me at all.

"Fuck," he groans when he's buried inside me.

I run one hand down his arm, feeling his strong muscles dance beneath my fingers as he lifts me back up the length of his cock. Leaning closer, I run my tongue over his bottom lip.

He lets out a growl and presses me up against the wall as he starts to fuck me in a hard, relentless rhythm that threatens to destroy my sanity. I slide my tongue into his mouth, needing to feel as close to him as possible. His fingers dig into my sore ass, and the feel of my nipples scraping against his hard chest is quickly pushing me to the breaking point.

I whimper and kiss him harder, knowing I'm only seconds away. His cock is so fucking big and every thrust is hitting my clit, and right when I start to cum, I break our kiss and scream his name, completely delirious from pleasure overload. It courses through me, making my muscles tense and my toes curl as my pussy spasms against him.
###chapter 249
Eleanor's POV

I stirred slightly, turning over in a daze. The empty space beside me felt vast and cold. Opening my eyes, I stared at the vacant spot where the sheets had long since lost their warmth. A bitter smile crossed my lips. Wasn't this exactly what I had expected?

I forced myself to sit up, and as the duvet slipped away, I caught sight of the tender bruises marking my skin. If it weren't for these violet-tinged reminders, I might have convinced myself that last night was nothing but a figment of my imagination. That version of Jace-so different from his usual composed self-might have been just another creation of my desperate mind.

My entire body ached as I gathered the scattered clothes from the floor. Pieces of last night's passion lay strewn about like evidence of a crime scene: my blouse draped over the reading chair, his shirt crumpled by the dresser. I placed them aside without much thought and headed straight for the bathroom.

The hot water did little to ease my physical discomfort, but at least it helped clear my mind. Steam filled the bathroom as I stood under the shower, watching rivulets of water trace paths down my body. Each drop seemed to carry away a piece of last night's memory, yet somehow made them more vivid at the same time.

After drying my hair and changing into fresh sleepwear, I returned to tackle the bedroom. The morning light was harsh now, illuminating every detail I'd rather not see. As I began stripping the bed, my hands froze at the sight of small bloodstains on the sheets. The physical proof of my lost innocence stared back at me, a stark reminder that there was no going back from this moment.

I quickly bundled up the sheets, desperate to erase this evidence of vulnerability. Just as I turned to leave the room, something caught my eye-a note on the bedside table that I hadn't noticed before. My heart skipped a beat as I picked up the small piece of paper. In Jace's distinctive handwriting were five simple words: "Wait for me. - Jace"

The clock on the wall showed just past nine in the morning. My mind wandered back to last night. Now, in the cold light of day, I couldn't help but wonder about his early departure. Was he seeking space to collect his thoughts? Would he return with some final decision about us?

I stared at the note for a long moment. I dropped it into the trash can. 

Squaring my shoulders, I continued with my morning routine as if this were any other day. I made the bed with fresh sheets, their crisp corners and smooth surface erasing all evidence of last night's passion. 



Jace's POV

Seven in the morning, and I finally had to leave. My heart ached with every movement as I tried to extract myself from the warmth of Eleanor's embrace.

My assistant had been calling repeatedly to remind me about the mountain location shoot. Truth be told, I had been incredibly selfish yesterday, dropping everything just to see her. The entire production schedule was thrown into disarray because of my impulsive decision. We were supposed to depart before six this morning for the remote filming location.

But I couldn't bring myself to leave Eleanor's side.

Watching her sleep so peacefully in my arms, I felt an overwhelming desire to stay. I bent down and softly kissed her forehead, encouraged by how deeply she slept. Growing bolder, I couldn't resist the urge to kiss her lips.

The moment our lips touched, an electric current seemed to course through my entire body. I lost all self-control and deepened the kiss, savoring every second of contact.

"Mmm..." she let out a soft, protesting whimper.

I knew I was disturbing her sleep, and she showed slight signs of displeasure, her body offering weak resistance. But exhaustion had claimed her, leaving her without the strength to properly object. I understood that Eleanor wanted nothing more than to continue sleeping, but I found myself helpless against the allure of her soft lips. I wanted more, so much more, and indulged in the kiss for far longer than I should have.

Just like last night.

Again and again, I had surprised even myself with how carried away we'd gotten. So much so that Eleanor had asked me, with that mix of shyness and teasing in her voice, "Don't you think you might be overcompensating a little?"

The memory of her expression last night made me smile involuntarily as I continued kissing her. Only another insistent phone call finally forced me to reluctantly break away from our stolen moment.

I carefully extracted myself from the warm cocoon of blankets. Before leaving, I placed a handwritten note on the nightstand and, on impulse, picked up a small ribbon that had caught my eye.

When I emerged from the building, I could see my assistant practically jumping with anxiety next to the car. He rushed forward as soon as he spotted me. "Director, everyone's already at the location, and both lead actors are on their way."

"Mm-hmm," I responded casually, feeling too content to share his sense of urgency.

Once in the car, my assistant began rattling off the shooting schedule and today's scenes. I interrupted him: "You won't need to come to the location with me today. Get out before we leave the city. Just give me the schedule."

I handed him the ribbon I'd taken. "Find a ring that matches this size. Send me photos of the styles you find." I paused, then added, "And order flowers - 999 roses, the freshest they have. Based on today's shooting schedule, I'll be back quite late. Wait for my call."

"Of course," my assistant nodded quickly, making notes on his phone.

After dropping him off, I headed toward the filming location. 

The biting winter wind whipped across the film set as I directed the final scene of the day. Every second counted-this film was slated for international festivals, and we couldn't afford any delays. The pressure weighed heavily on my shoulders as I watched the actors move through their marks with practiced precision.

"Cut!" I called out, checking my watch. 10 PM. The crew had been working tirelessly since dawn, and exhaustion was evident on their faces. All around me, people were starting to gather for the late dinner the production had arranged. The savory aroma of hot food wafted through the air, but my stomach was too knotted with stress to feel hungry.

"Director Gillard, won't you join us for dinner?" Sarah, one of the production assistants, approached me with concern in her eyes. The harsh set lights cast long shadows across her face.

"I need to head back," I replied, already gathering my things. The medications in my pocket rattled-I hadn't eaten properly all day, surviving on coffee and antacids.

"Back to the city? But we have an early call time tomorrow-7 AM sharp." Sarah's brow furrowed. "The weather report's predicting snow, and the mountain roads are treacherous at night. We've arranged accommodations nearby. The inn's quite comfortable-"

"I appreciate the concern, but I need to return tonight." I cut her off, perhaps more curtly than intended. "I'll be back in time for tomorrow's shoot."

Sarah opened her mouth as if to protest further but thought better of it. I could read the worry in her expression, but she merely nodded and stepped back. The crew knew me well enough by now to recognize when my mind was made up.

I swallowed two more antacids, their chalky taste bitter on my tongue, before climbing into my car. The engine hummed to life, and I pulled away from the set, watching the bright production lights fade in my rearview mirror. The darkness of the mountain road swallowed me whole.

My phone rang, breaking the silence. I switched it to speaker mode.

"Is everything prepared?" I asked my assistant without preamble.

"Yes, everything's ready as requested," came the quick response. "But director, are you sure about driving back tonight? The weather-"

"Meet me at the entrance of my residential complex in ninety minutes," I interrupted. "Bring everything we discussed."

"Please be careful. The roads-"

"I know what I'm doing." I ended the call, focusing on the winding road ahead. The first few snowflakes were beginning to fall, dancing in my headlights like wayward stars.

My thoughts drifted to tomorrow's scenes, mentally reviewing the shot list, when a flash of light suddenly filled my rearview mirror. Before I could react, two blazing headlights appeared around the bend, heading straight for me. They were on the wrong side of the road.

Time seemed to slow. The other driver's horn blared, a desperate warning. I jerked the wheel hard to the right, trying to avoid collision. My tires lost traction on the snow-slicked road. The guardrail appeared in my headlights, then disappeared under my car.

For a moment, I was floating. The world spun in a dizzying kaleidoscope of snow and darkness. The crunch of metal filled my ears as my car tumbled down the steep embankment. 

Everything went black.
###chapter 250
Eleanor's POV

It's midnight, and I'm still waiting.

The city outside my window is buried under a thick blanket of snow, the kind that muffles all sound and makes the world feel suspended in time. I keep staring at my phone, though I already know the answer. Jace won't be coming home tonight.

I type out one last message: "Are you coming home?" but the words disappear into the digital void, met with the same silence that's been my only companion all evening.

The morning light creeps through my window, harsh and unforgiving against the fresh snow. I pick up my phone again, this time to call Maya. We haven't spoken in months, not since I moved into this apartment that Drew arranged for us. Maya chose not to stay here - perhaps sensing my discomfort with her presence, she found work elsewhere and kept her distance. I can't blame her for that.

Our relationship has always been complicated. She's technically my only family, but that word - family - feels hollow when I think about our past. Still, as I prepare to leave Manhattan behind, she's the one person I feel compelled to inform.

"Eleanor?" Her voice quivers with uncertainty when she answers, as if she can't quite believe I'm calling.

"Yes." I keep my voice level, controlled. "I wanted to let you know I'm leaving Manhattan."

The silence that follows is heavy with unspoken questions. Finally, she breaks it: "What happened? Is everything okay? Did something happen with Drew?"

"Drew and I broke up." The words come out flat, emotionless, though they burn in my throat.

"What? Why? What happened?"

"I don't need to explain myself to you." The coldness in my voice is automatic, a defense mechanism I've never quite managed to dismantle when it comes to Maya.

The line goes quiet again, and I can feel her hurt radiating through the silence. Part of me wishes I could be kinder, but years of complicated history stand between us like a wall of ice.

"Tom was sentenced to three years for second-degree assault and burglary," I continue, my tone still distant. "If you want to stay in Manhattan, that's your choice. But if you want to leave with me, send me your ID information, and I'll book your train ticket."

"I'm coming with you." Her response is immediate, without a moment's hesitation. She doesn't even ask where we're going, and something about that unconditional acceptance makes my throat tight.

I press my lips together, fighting back the unexpected surge of emotion. I'm not even sure if I want her to come with me, but I've made the offer, and now I have to follow through.

"The train leaves around three this afternoon," I say. "We'll need to leave early to get to the station. Pack quickly."

"I don't have much. I'll be ready."

After hanging up, I walk to the floor-to-ceiling windows of my apartment. The city sprawls before me, transformed by last night's snowfall into something almost unrecognizable. Twenty-five years I've lived here, and I've never seen Manhattan look quite like this.

I take a deep breath, my hand hovering over my phone as I consider messaging Serena and Quinn. But no - better to wait until I'm settled somewhere new. Right now, my resolve to leave is firm, and I don't want anything to shake it.

There's nothing left for me here in Manhattan. Nothing except my debt to Drew, which weighs heavily on my conscience. But leaving is the kindest thing I can do for him now. Time is the only thing that can heal what I've broken.

I press my forehead against the cold glass, watching my breath fog the window. Life goes on, even when your own world has stopped turning.




Serena's POV

Lucas and I shared breakfast in our temporary sanctuary in Portland. These past few days, he'd occasionally step out, though never for long. Each time he returned, the first thing he'd do was change his clothes-he was meticulous about not bringing any outside scents into our space. 

We were quietly enjoying our breakfast-fresh coffee and homemade waffles-when his phone suddenly rang. I watched as he glanced at the caller ID, his expression shifting subtly. "Grandfather," he said, his voice carrying a note of surprise.

I kept my eyes on my plate but remained acutely aware of his presence. I knew Lucas well enough by now-if it was a call I wasn't supposed to hear, like when Rachel Thorne would call, he would step away. The fact that he stayed told me I was welcome to be part of whatever this was.

"What?" The sharp intake of breath made me look up. I saw something I'd rarely witnessed-genuine fear flickering across Lucas's face.

Few things could shake Lucas Harrington's composure like this. I noticed his hand trembling slightly as he held the phone, and was that... moisture in his eyes? The sight made my heart clench.

"I understand," he said finally, his voice barely steady. After hanging up, he sat there in complete silence, seemingly frozen in place.

The silence stretched between us like a physical presence until I couldn't bear it anymore. "What happened?" I asked softly, dreading the answer that could affect him so deeply.

"Jace... Jace had an accident," he managed to say, his voice thick with emotion he was clearly struggling to control.

My heart stopped for a moment. From Lucas's reaction, this wasn't just any accident.

"It happened last night, around eleven. His car went off a cliff-almost vertical drop, nothing like your accident. They didn't get to him until five this morning." His voice cracked slightly. "He's in critical condition. They... they don't know if he'll make it."

I sat there, speechless, my mind racing with memories of my own accident, but this was different-so much worse. The way Lucas described it sent chills down my spine.

"I need to go back," he said abruptly, already starting to rise from his chair.

"I'll come with you-" I began, but he cut me off.

"You need to stay here. It's safer than Manhattan right now." His tone was gentle but firm.

I opened my mouth to argue but stopped myself. This wasn't the time for a debate. Not when his closest friend was fighting for his life.

"I'll return as soon as I can," he promised, his gray eyes meeting mine.

"It's fine. I'll be comfortable here," I assured him, meaning it. I didn't want my situation to keep him from being there for Jace. My chest tightened at the thought of Jace. I couldn't let my mind wander to the worst possibilities. As long as he was still in surgery, there was hope. Modern medicine worked miracles every day.

Lucas left without touching the rest of his breakfast. I lost my appetite too, pushing away my half-eaten waffle. Grabbing my phone and using my crutch for support, I made my way to the garden terrace. The news about Jace weighed heavily on my heart. I had manipulated him in the past, used him in my schemes, and never properly apologized...

I checked my phone for news about the accident but found nothing. The Harrington family must have kept it quiet to avoid media circus. Which made me wonder-did Eleanor know?

I agonized over whether to tell her. Eleanor was with Drew now, happy and in love. Drew and Jace were close friends-surely Drew would hear about this soon. If he chose to tell Eleanor, that should be his decision. If he decided to keep it from her, well, that was between them now. As much as it pained me, I had to respect their relationship.

My thoughts drifted back to Lucas. In all our time together, I'd never seen him so shaken. Jace wasn't just his friend-they'd grown up together, faced the world together. They were more like brothers than friends. The thought of losing him...
###chapter 251
Serena's POV

Another day passed by without any news.

I kept refreshing the news feeds, but there wasn't a single mention of Jace Gillard's accident. Unable to contain my anxiety any longer, I sent Lucas a message: "How's Jace doing?"

The wait for his response felt endless. The silence from his end was deafening.

A few minutes later, Rachel Thorne called. I hesitated before answering.

"Serena, Lucas is too busy to respond right now, so he asked me to call you," Rachel's voice sounded exhausted through the phone.

My heart sank at this information. So Rachel had gone with Lucas and stayed with him for the past twenty-four hours?

But this wasn't the time to dwell on such thoughts. "How is Jace's condition now?" I struggled to keep my voice steady. Jace's injuries were what mattered most right now.

"He came out of surgery yesterday afternoon but hasn't regained consciousness. The doctors say there's a high probability he might end up in a vegetative state, though there's still hope. Lucas has brought in a team of specialists from Europe who just arrived in Manhattan. They're examining him now, with Lucas present. They'll be discussing the treatment plan next."

"Is it that serious?" I pressed, anxiety creeping into my voice.

"Very serious," Rachel replied bluntly. "His heart stopped twice during surgery. They barely managed to bring him back. He's still unconscious, with dangerously low blood pressure. I don't know all the details, but from what I can see..." She paused. "It's hard to say what will happen. We'll have to wait for the specialist team's diagnosis. Don't worry, I'll keep you updated on any changes in Jace's condition."

"Thank you."

"You're welcome."

After these brief pleasantries, I ended the call. I never imagined Jace's condition would be this critical.

Over the next two days, Rachel kept her word, sending me regular updates about Jace's condition. I wasn't sure if she was being genuinely kind or if she was trying to keep me from bothering Lucas. It didn't matter though - having immediate updates about Jace's condition was all I needed. I had no other expectations from them.

That night, as I was preparing for bed, Lucas called. It was his first direct contact with me in three days. Perhaps because he knew Rachel was keeping me informed.

"I'm taking Jace abroad," he said. "The medical facilities here are limited for his condition. He's stable enough to travel now, and we're boarding the plane soon. He'll receive more specialized treatment there."

"What do you mean by stable?" I immediately focused on the key point.

"It means he's no longer in immediate danger, but he's still completely unconscious. There's a blood clot pressing against a blood vessel in his brain. It's not only keeping him unconscious but also threatening his life. No surgeon in the world is willing to operate on it right now. The only option is to transfer him abroad where we can use more advanced medical technology to stabilize his vital signs before attempting brain surgery."

"I understand." I nodded. This meant that although he wasn't in immediate danger, his life was still hanging by a thread.

Before hanging up, I asked, "Is Rachel going with you?" I wasn't asking out of jealousy - I just wanted to know if I could continue getting updates from her without having to disturb him.

"No, she's not," Lucas replied directly.

"Oh."

"Wait for me."

I didn't respond, just ended the call.

The next evening, Lucas sent me a text letting me know they had arrived safely.

On the third morning, as I scrolled through my phone during my usual morning routine, my heart clenched at the photos posted by Rachel Thorne. There she was, embracing the twins on a private aircraft, her smile radiating what seemed like calculated warmth. While Milo maintained his characteristic reserved demeanor, it was Stella's demeanor that truly caught my attention. Those beautiful gray eyes were filled with unmistakable distress, her usual composed expression replaced by barely concealed anxiety.

My grip tightened on my phone as I studied each detail of the image. Had Lucas really entrusted the children to Rachel without any consideration for my feelings? After everything we'd been through, didn't he think I deserved to be part of this decision? The children had become such an integral part of my life; the thought of them being whisked away without my knowledge felt like a physical ache in my chest.

Over the next few days, Lucas's messages were sparse, mostly brief updates about Jace Gillard's situation that led to little progress. Meanwhile, Rachel's social media presence exploded with an almost orchestrated showcase of domestic bliss. There were photos of Milo covered in bubbles during bath time, moments at the carousel where his small face lit up with joy, and hiking adventures in upstate New York. But it was Stella's subtle reactions in these pictures that spoke volumes to me.

In every photograph, I could see the slight tension in Stella's shoulders, the way she would edge away from Rachel's embraces, the forced smile that never quite reached her eyes. Stella had always been perceptive beyond her years, and I knew her well enough to recognize her silent protests. She was the kind of child who internalized her distress, much like her father, and seeing her quiet suffering was becoming unbearable.

The breaking point came with Rachel's latest post-a photo of Milo sitting on a hospital bed with a bandaged ankle. Stella stood beside him, her small hands clutched together so tightly her knuckles had turned white. Her eyes, usually bright with intelligence and warmth, were glossy with unshed tears. Rachel's caption read: "I'm so sorry, precious one. I should have been more careful with you."

Something inside me snapped. The sight of Stella's barely contained distress, her protective stance next to her injured brother, triggered every protective instinct I had developed for these children. I immediately messaged Rachel: "How are the children doing?"

Her response came quickly, perhaps too quickly: "Nothing serious. We were hiking today, and Milo twisted his ankle. The doctor says he'll be fine with a few days' rest."

"Tell me where they are. I'm coming to get them," I replied, thinking particularly of Stella. That child had always been sensitive to emotional undercurrents, and I feared the psychological impact of this forced separation.

"Lucas entrusted them to my care. Without his permission, I won't hand them over to anyone," came her cold response.

Looking back at the steady stream of photos she had been posting, I could now see the calculated nature of it all. Was this elaborate display meant specifically for me? And Milo's injury-could it have been more than just an accident? The thought made my blood run cold, especially when I looked again at Stella's worried face in the photograph.

I immediately called Lucas: "I need to bring the children to stay with me. Especially Stella-you must have seen how she's been lately. She needs me."

"I'll be back in two days," Lucas replied, his voice carrying that familiar tone of controlled tension.

"I want to get them now!" I insisted, my voice firm with conviction. "Do you really believe they're safe with Rachel? Have you looked at Stella's eyes in those photos? That child is crying out for help without saying a word."

"Stay calm. Rachel won't harm Milo or Stella," Lucas's steady voice came through the phone.

I couldn't accept his composure. "How can you be so sure about her?"

"At least not now," he replied deliberately, each word carrying absolute certainty.

My anger flared. "Milo got hurt because of her! Stella was terrified seeing it happen!"

"Children get minor bumps and bruises. It's normal," he maintained his calm tone.

I gripped the phone tightly, barely containing my fury.

Lucas continued, "Don't go anywhere without me. Rachel won't hurt the children, but she might try to hurt you."

I hung up abruptly.

When it came to the twins, I found it impossible to maintain my usual composure. But facing Lucas always left me feeling powerless to argue.

Two days later, at 3 AM, Lucas returned.

I've always been a light sleeper and heard movement outside, but I chose to stay in bed, simply turning over to continue sleeping.

Suddenly, I heard the bedroom door open softly. I pretended to be asleep, not wanting to engage.

Just then, I felt the mattress dip slightly beside me. Still annoyed and having been on edge for days, I turned around roughly - only to freeze at the sight of two small smiling faces looking back at me.

"Mommy!" Milo's sweet voice rang out as he threw himself at me, wrapping his little arms around my neck.

Stella followed behind him, her eyes sparkling as she whispered, "Mommy, we're home." She carefully moved closer, gently hugging my waist.

Holding these two warm little bodies, I felt my heart instantly melt.

"Mommy, did you miss us? We missed you so much," Milo said, clinging to my neck with a hint of reproach in his voice. "We didn't want to go to Portland with Aunt Rachel at all, but then Daddy said you were there too, so we couldn't wait to come see you!"

Stella nodded in agreement. "When brother said he wanted to see Mommy, I insisted on coming too." She looked up at me earnestly. "I needed to watch over him."

"Did your daddy bring you here at this hour?" I asked.

"Mm-hmm," Milo loosened his grip on my neck to look at me. "We were sleeping so soundly, but when Daddy said we could see Mommy now, I woke right up! Mommy, did we disturb your sleep?"

"Not at all," I smiled, stroking his soft cheek. Then remembering something, I asked, "How's your leg?"

"It's fine now! I just twisted it a bit the other day. The doctor fixed it up, and it stopped hurting yesterday," he explained quickly.

Stella chimed in, "I went to the hospital with brother." She declared proudly, "I held his hand the whole time, and he didn't cry once."

Only then did I realize it had truly been just a minor injury. Rachel had deliberately exaggerated to provoke my anger.

"Mommy," Milo yawned, "can we sleep with you? I'm so sleepy."

Stella looked at me with hopeful eyes.

"Of course," I agreed immediately. "Let Mommy help you get ready for bed."

"Thank you, Mommy. I love you so much," Milo said sweetly.

Stella quietly let me help her remove her jacket, whispering, "Mommy, I love you too."

We snuggled under the covers together, with the little ones on either side of me. Milo, curled up in my arms, murmured, "Mommy, I love sleeping next to you. You smell so nice."

Stella nuzzled against my arm, softly agreeing, "Mommy does smell nice."

"It's late, time to sleep."

"Goodnight, Mommy," the twins said in unison.

"Goodnight, Milo, Stella."

The room fell silent. Within a minute, Milo was snoring softly. Stella carefully tucked her brother's blanket around him before closing her own eyes. Watching them, I couldn't help but admire how quickly children could fall asleep. I gently adjusted their covers, making sure they were warm enough.

In the dim light, I studied their peaceful faces. Stella's protective nature toward her brother never ceased to amaze me. Though twins, she had always taken on the role of the watchful older sister. The way she checked on Milo before allowing herself to rest spoke volumes about her maturity and caring heart.

The moonlight filtering through the curtains cast a gentle glow across their faces, highlighting their resemblance to Lucas - the same defined features, though softened by childhood innocence. Stella especially had inherited her father's thoughtful expression, even in sleep.

The anger I had been holding onto for days began to dissipate as I lay there, surrounded by their gentle breathing. This moment felt precious - just the three of us, safe and together.

I lay awake, tossing and turning in bed, unable to find sleep. These past few days in this house had been painfully monotonous. Though I occasionally worked on my laptop, most of my time was spent in an endless cycle of restlessness. The pattern had become predictable: sleeping during the day left me wide awake at night, my mind racing with thoughts I couldn't silence.

Tonight, my thoughts kept circling back to my recent argument with Lucas. In the quiet darkness, everything seemed clearer. Now that I could think rationally, I understood that Rachel would never actually harm Milo or Stella. Given her current position, she needed to stay in their good graces. I had to admit - I'd overreacted that day.

Rachel's actions were calculated, designed to provoke exactly the response I'd given her. She knew I would get angry, and she used that to create distance between Lucas and me. I had to acknowledge the bitter truth: I'd fallen right into her trap.

Still, I couldn't completely dismiss the possibility that she was using the children to threaten me, however subtly.

I rolled over, facing the sleeping forms of Milo and Stella. I always kept a dim night light on when they slept with me - a habit I'd developed to make it easier to check on them and adjust their blankets during the night.

Looking at their peaceful sleeping faces stirred something deep within me. Only a mother could truly understand this indescribable feeling of joy and contentment that comes from watching your children sleep safely beside you. Stella looked particularly angelic in her sleep, so different from her usual composed, princess-like demeanor during the day. She had curled up next to me, her delicate fingers unconsciously clutching the edge of my sleep shirt.

I couldn't resist gently stroking their cheeks. In her sleep, Stella nuzzled against my hand, a slight smile gracing her lips. Milo continued his peaceful slumber, letting out tiny snores.

I'll protect you both, no matter what, I silently promised.

The next morning arrived with gentle sunlight filtering through the curtains. I'd grown accustomed to sleeping in until after 10 AM these days. Perhaps due to my late-night contemplation, the twins were still sound asleep. Milo maintained his adorably peaceful expression, while Stella hadn't moved from her position, her small hand still firmly gripping my shirt as if making sure I wouldn't disappear.

I carefully extracted myself from bed, gently loosening Stella's grip from my clothing, taking extra care not to disturb either of my sleeping angels. After freshening up, I made my way out of the room with my crutches, quietly closing the door behind me.

The living room was occupied only by the household staff, a sight that had become familiar over the past few days. It made me wonder if Lucas had even returned home. Then it occurred to me that he might still be sleeping.

"Would you like breakfast, Miss Sinclair?" one of the staff members approached me.

"I'll wait a bit," I replied. "Until Lucas and the children wake up. I'm not particularly hungry yet."

"Mr. Harrington is already awake," she quickly informed me.

This surprised me, as I hadn't seen him.

"He got up earlier, but when he saw that you and the children were still sleeping, he returned to his room," she explained. "He asked to be notified when you woke up. I can go tell him now."

I nodded, then reconsidered. "I'll go myself."

"Of course."

I felt somewhat guilty about our previous argument regarding the children. Besides, I wanted to ask about Jace's situation as soon as possible.

I made my way to Lucas's room. Just as I raised my hand to knock, the door opened on its own. Without giving it much thought, I stepped inside.

There stood Lucas in the middle of the room, completely unclothed, his hair still damp from what appeared to be a recent shower.

Sensing someone's presence, he turned around.

Our eyes met, and I felt my face flush crimson instantly.

I spun around to leave, my heart racing as fast as my thoughts.
###chapter 253
Serena's POV

I was about to leave his bedroom when I heard Lucas's voice behind me. "Serena." The way he said my name sent an involuntary shiver down my spine.

I stood frozen, biting my lower lip, deliberately keeping my back to him. The evening shadows were growing longer, casting strange shapes across the hardwood floor beneath my feet. I could hear the soft hum of the air conditioning and the distant sound of traffic below.

"Wait a moment," he said, his voice carrying that familiar commanding tone that always made my heart skip a beat. "I need your help with something."

"Put some clothes on first," I reminded him, trying to keep my voice steady. The memory of walking in on him fresh from the shower was still burning in my mind.

"It's not like you're at a disadvantage here," he replied, a hint of amusement in his voice.

I sighed inwardly. He was wrong - I was definitely at a disadvantage. Every moment spent alone with him tested my resolve in ways I wasn't ready to acknowledge.

After what felt like an eternity, he spoke again. "Alright, I'm decent."

I turned around slowly, steeling myself for whatever "decent" meant in Lucas Harrington's vocabulary. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, wearing a white robe that hung loosely on his broad shoulders. While he wasn't exactly exposed, the casual way the fabric draped across his body left little to imagination. The fading sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows cast a golden glow across his features, softening his usually sharp expression.

"What kind of help?" I asked, proud that my voice remained steady despite the way my pulse had quickened.

"My thigh," he explained, gesturing to his leg. "The wound from the accident hasn't completely healed. I think it might be slightly infected. Would you mind helping me apply some medication? It's in an awkward spot."

I frowned, concern momentarily overriding my discomfort. "The accident? You mean from when I..." My voice trailed off as the memories of that rainy night came flooding back - the screeching tires, the crash, and Lucas appearing out of nowhere to pull me from the wreckage.

"Yes, from when you had your accident," he confirmed softly. "It's been bothering me lately."

"This long and it still hasn't healed?" I moved closer, medical concern winning over my personal reservations. I noticed the first aid kit already laid out on the bedside table, making me wonder if he had planned this entire scenario. Knowing Lucas, he probably had.

"That's why it needs attention," he explained, shifting slightly on the bed. "I haven't been taking proper care of it."

I approached the bed where he sat, noticing how the expensive sheets were perfectly arranged despite his recent shower. Everything in his room spoke of precise organization, from the aligned books on the shelves to the perfectly positioned furniture - everything except for the man himself, who seemed deliberately disheveled in his loose robe.

When he adjusted his position and pulled the robe up to reveal the injury, I nearly lost my professional demeanor. The wound was high up on his inner thigh, and I could tell he wasn't wearing anything underneath the robe. I forced myself to focus on the task at hand, reaching for the antiseptic and healing cream.

Kneeling beside the bed, I began to clean the wound. He was right - it showed signs of infection, the skin around it slightly inflamed. "You should have taken better care of this," I chided softly, trying to ignore how intimate this position felt.

"It's not exactly easy to reach," he replied, his voice slightly strained. "And I've been... distracted lately."

Something in his tone made me look up, only to find his intense gray eyes fixed on my face. I quickly looked back down at my task, feeling heat rise to my cheeks.

"This might sting," I warned, applying the antiseptic. I heard his sharp intake of breath and felt his muscles tense under my fingers.

"Does it hurt?" I asked, though I knew it must.

"No," he lied, making me roll my eyes at his typical stubbornness.

I gentled my touch, carefully applying the medication. Without thinking, I leaned closer and blew softly on the wound to ease the sting, something I used to do for Stella when she got scrapes and bruises.

The atmosphere in the room suddenly shifted. The air grew thick with tension, and I became acutely aware of how close I was to him, how my breath against his skin had made his muscles tense in a way that had nothing to do with pain. The silence in the room was deafening, broken only by our slightly uneven breathing.

Through the soft fabric of his bathrobe, I caught a glimpse of his cock. My cheeks instantly flushed with warmth as I quickly stood up, trying to maintain my composure. "All done," I said, focusing on keeping my voice steady. "Be careful not to get it wet, and try not to let anything rub against it when you walk."

"Mm," Lucas responded, his voice thick with something he was clearly trying to suppress.

I busied myself with the first aid kit, pretending not to notice the strain in his voice or the tension hanging in the air. As I reorganized the bottles and bandages, I deliberately changed the subject. "How's Jace doing?"

Business talk always helped dissipate these intimate moments.

Lucas provided a detailed explanation, his professional demeanor returning. "After being transferred to the specialized medical facility abroad, my uncle's condition has stabilized. While he's out of immediate danger, he remains unconscious. The medical team analyzed the blood clot in his brain and recommended conservative treatment for now, hoping it might dissolve naturally. The risks of surgical intervention to remove it are too high to attempt without careful consideration."

"So unless the clot is removed or dissolves on its own, Jace won't wake up?" I pressed, concerned.

"That's the current understanding," he confirmed with a slight nod.

"And he's alone there?" My voice carried my worry.

Lucas shifted his weight, the movement causing his bathrobe to rustle softly. "The situation is relatively stable for now, and my presence wouldn't change much. My grandfather is staying with him, though. Being retired, he has the time to remain there for a while."

I nodded slowly. There wasn't much anyone could do except hope for Jace's recovery. The helplessness of the situation weighed heavily on both of us.

After organizing the medical supplies, I grabbed my crutch and made my way to his bathroom to wash my hands, which were sticky from the ointment I'd applied to his wound. As I stepped inside, I froze at the sight of black underwear lying on the counter. I inwardly cursed my choice-there were plenty of other bathrooms in the house, yet I'd chosen this one.

What caught my attention even more was that the garment appeared damp. Before I could process this observation, Lucas appeared behind me, swiftly grabbing the underwear and disposing of it in the nearby bin with practiced efficiency.

I caught his gaze in the mirror, noting his slightly labored breathing and the fresh blush creeping up his neck. The bathroom suddenly felt much smaller than it was.

Under my questioning look, he turned away, his voice rough. "It happens to every grown man. Not just me."

I kept my eyes down and focused on washing my hands, offering no response. He left quickly, the door closing softly behind him.

As I methodically cleaned each finger, my mind wandered to places it shouldn't. The warm water didn't help cool the heat rising in my cheeks as I recalled the intimate moment of tending to his injury, the way his muscles had tensed under my touch, the controlled breaths he'd taken...

After drying my hands, I emerged from the bathroom to find the bedroom empty. Movement from the adjacent dressing room caught my attention-a shadow moving behind the frosted glass doors.

I made my way there unhurriedly, my crutch making soft sounds against the hardwood floor. As I entered, I found Lucas in the process of dressing, wearing only black boxer briefs similar to the ones from earlier. The sight of his broad shoulders and defined back muscles made my breath catch.

He caught sight of me in the full-length mirror, surprise flickering across his features. "I'll be out in a moment," he said, his voice carrying a hint of roughness.

"Can you manage?" I asked, noting how he favored his injured side.

"Yes."

"Without aggravating the wound?"

"I'll be careful..." His Adam's apple bobbed visibly as he swallowed, and I watched as his fingers tightened on the shirt he held. The dressing room, despite its size, felt intimate and close.
###chapter 254
Lucas's POV

I stood before the bathroom mirror, my hands gripping the marble countertop as I tried to steady my racing thoughts. The steam from my recent shower still lingered in the air, creating a dreamy haze that matched my current state of mind. That's when I felt Serena's warm, delicate hands gently rest against my back, sending electric shivers down my spine.

The touch was innocent enough, but my body's reaction was anything but. Every muscle tensed as her fingers traced patterns across my skin. Did she have any idea what she was doing to me? After that night we shared, keeping my distance had been an exercise in iron will. Now here she was, testing every ounce of my self-control.

Perhaps this was her form of sweet torture. She knew I wouldn't dare cross that line, not after everything that had happened between us. Yet she seemed intent on pushing me to my limits, making me acutely aware of every point where her skin met mine.

Through the mirror's reflection, I watched as she stepped closer, her arms wrapping around my waist from behind. Her touch sent visible tremors through my abdomen - a betrayal of my body that I couldn't hide. The scent of her perfume, subtle and intoxicating, filled my senses. It took every ounce of willpower not to turn around and pull her into my arms.

"Lucas," she whispered, her breath warm against my back, "I'm sorry about before. I shouldn't have gotten so upset about Rachel. I know you were just trying to help."

My throat felt dry, and I tried to lighten the moment with humor, though my voice came out hoarse: "So, Miss Sinclair, is this your way of making amends? Physical compensation for my wounded feelings?"

It was meant as a joke - I never dared hope for more. I knew Serena well enough to understand that until things were completely resolved with Rachel, she would keep her distance. No matter how many sleepless nights that meant for me, I had accepted it as my reality.

"What if it is?" Her words were soft but clear, her face pressed against my back. I could feel her heartbeat through our shared contact, its rhythm matching my own accelerated pulse.

My entire body went rigid. Was this another one of our dangerous games? We'd played at the edges of this precipice before, but never so boldly. The weight of our history made every step treacherous.

I couldn't forget how my past actions had left her with deep emotional scars, how she had spent years hating me. The thought of losing her again, of doing anything to jeopardize the delicate trust we'd rebuilt, was unbearable. Better to endure this exquisite torture than risk pushing her away forever.

"Don't you want this?" she asked, interpreting my silence as rejection.

"I don't dare," I admitted honestly, my voice rough with suppressed emotion.

I felt her pause, surprised by my candor. Then her hands grew bolder, exploring the taut muscles of my torso with deliberate intent. Each touch was like a brand against my skin, marking me as hers even as I fought to maintain control.

"This time," she whispered, "I won't hate you for it."

I caught her wandering hands in mine, turning to face her at last. The sight of her - cheeks flushed, eyes bright with both uncertainty and determination - nearly undid me. "Serena, what are you really doing?"

Despite her bold actions, I could feel the tremor in her hands, see the vulnerability beneath her confident facade. She wasn't as composed as she was trying to appear, and that knowledge only made me more protective of her heart.

"You don't need to offer yourself like this," I said firmly, though it cost me dearly to say the words. "Not as an apology, not as gratitude for anything I've done. Everything I've done for you has been my choice, freely given. You owe me nothing - not for saving your life, not for any of it. Do you understand?"

I would wait forever if that's what she needed. My love for her wasn't conditional on physical intimacy, no matter how much I might desire it.

"What if," she said, meeting my gaze with unwavering intensity, "this is my choice too? Freely given?"

In that moment, her eyes held a clarity I'd never seen before. The walls between us - misunderstandings, hurt, and careful distance - seemed to dissolve. The air grew thick with possibility, and I found myself standing on the edge of everything I'd ever wanted, terrified to take that final step.

Her hands slid up to cup my face, and I couldn't help but lean into her touch. "I'm not offering this out of obligation," she continued, her voice stronger now. "I'm offering because I want to."

I was about to speak, but her sudden movement caught me off guard. Serena rose on her tiptoes, wrapping her arms around my neck. The subtle scent of her perfume filled my senses as she pressed her soft lips against mine. 

I held my breath, stunned by her boldness, hardly daring to move. I remained still as she kissed me, her tongue gently exploring, teasing with feather-light touches. For a man who had been restraining his feelings for so long, this was the sweetest torture imaginable.

I fought to control the surge of emotions within me as she slowly ended the lingering kiss. Her lips still glistened slightly, a sight that made my heart race. The dressing room suddenly felt too small, too intimate, the air between us charged with unspoken desires.

"Don't say anything right now," she whispered, her breath warm against my skin. "I might change my mind."

"I won't let you do anything you'll regret..." I tried to respond, but she cut me off.

"No." Her voice was firm, determined. "What's done is done. No regrets."

"Serena..." Her name had barely left my lips when she silenced me with another kiss.

Her body pressed against mine, the subtle movement sending sparks through my entire being. If I had maintained even a shred of rationality, I would have stopped this here. Given my current position in her life, I didn't want her to feel any regret or uncertainty about our relationship. But my carefully maintained self-control was crumbling rapidly under her touch. Like a sudden summer storm, the passion between us was fierce and unstoppable.

I pulled her closer, lifting her effortlessly onto the dressing room counter. The marble surface was cool beneath her as I leaned in, my body covering hers. Her fingers tangled in my hair as our kisses grew more urgent, more demanding. The world beyond this room ceased to exist; there was only Serena, the soft sounds she made, the way her body responded to my touch.

Through the haze of desire, I registered the faint sound of the door opening and closing quietly. Outside, a confused voice drifted through: "Miss Stella, weren't you going to call your father and Serena for dinner? Why did you come back out?"

"Shh," came Stella's serious little voice, a tone that always made me smile despite its gravity. "Daddy and Mommy are busy right now. I can eat by myself."

The housekeeper seemed perplexed. "But Miss Stella..."

"No one is allowed to disturb them," Stella declared with all the authority a child could muster. Then, her voice brightened with hope: "Maybe I'll finally get a little brother or sister soon."

The innocent comment should have made me pause, but Serena's fingers were tracing patterns on my back, her touch electric even through my shirt. She laughed softly against my neck, the sound both embarrassed and amused. "Stella is quite the strategist," she murmured.

"She takes after her father," I replied, pulling back slightly to look into Serena's eyes.

###chapter 255
Serena's POV

His shoulders were still rising and falling heavily and I couldn't stop my hands from reaching out and touching him. I placed my hand on his chest, staying in place between him and the door.

At first, he tensed beneath my touch and slowly melted slightly as he took a step forward and dipped his head, placing a powerful kiss on the side of my neck as he forcefully pulled me against him. The action stole my breath and I had to fight back a soft moan as he peppered my neck with aggressive kisses until he reached my mouth.

"Are you sure about this?" He asked in a deep voice against my lips, holding my head in place with his massive hands.

"Of course." I said, giving him a flirty smile as my mouth tried to close the space between us.

"Let us just see about that." He said in a low menacing tone as the corner of his mouth curled into the smallest smile.

"Spread your legs." He ordered.

The firmness in his voice danced across my skin and settled between my legs, forcing my body to move before my brain could command it to.

Reaching down beneath my dress, he ran his rough hand up my inner thigh until he reached my hot throbbing pussy. Pushing aside the thin fabric of my panties, he slid a finger inside me. Swallowing the moan that escaped from my mouth as he plunged his tongue between my lips in a deep kiss. 

He broke the contact with my lips, leaving me breathless and wanting more with one finger still inside me.

"Mhmm, you weren't lying." He said as he slid his finger deeper inside me, stalling once he had bottomed out and reached his knuckles.

"Now, don't make a fucking sound." He commanded.

"What?" I asked, unsure if I was even capable of such a task. Yes, I could be quiet but not make a sound at all.

His expression didn't change, but his hold on my neck did. He shifted his hand so it was across my throat with just enough pressure to be felt, using his thumb as leverage to tilt my head up.

"No." He growled against my ear before he placed several light kisses beneath my earlobe.

Sliding a second finger inside me with his words, he watched as I panted against the need to make a sound, taking my bottom lips between my teeth as he started moving his strong fingers in and out of my cunt.

"You are so wet for me." He whispered into my ear as he pleasured me with his hand, gathering wetness from my folds and using it to massage my clit beneath his middle finger.

I felt my knees start to buckle as he rolled my clit back and forth beneath his fingers but he instantly moved his arm around me, taking my weight just in case my legs gave out. I clutched at his back, taking in fistfuls of his shirt and digging my nails into his skin as I fought against my need to moan, my need to scream and respond to the perfect pressure and rhythm that he was using on my sensitive bundle of nerves.

I don't think I am going to be able to do this. I can't keep quiet anymore.

"Fuck, Serena." He groaned again against my flesh.

"More, please more. That feels good." I moaned.

He scooped my other leg up over his shoulder, positioning me so that I was practically sitting on his shoulder with my back pinned against the wall. His movements were carnal as he grabbed my thighs pulling me harshly against his face as he devoured my pussy.

"Cum for me, sweetheart. I want to taste you." He grunted and groaned against my skin, letting the vibration of his voice tease my sensitive flesh.

I moaned and thrashed, gripping the back of his head as he unhinged me. My thighs tightened as a second orgasm overwhelmed my senses as it completely consumed me. I threw my head back and moaned loudly, not caring if anyone was around to hear us. Lucas was too good with his tongue for me to think about anything except the mind numbing orgasm that ripped through every muscle in my body. His tongue was merciless and his strong grip on my thighs sent a flood of goosebumps up and down my body. He owned me at that moment and I was loving it.

His eyes were dark and predatory as he lowered me back down onto my feet, still devouring me with his eyes as if I were the only woman on earth.

"I love you so fucking much." He said breathlessly.

"I love you too," I said with a smile. I run my fingers down his sides and across his abs until my hands are on his zipper.

"Now fuck me, Luc. Claim me and make me yours forever."

He groans and kisses me hard as I unzip his pants and slide my hands into them, cupping his firm ass. Pulling back long enough for him to slide his pants off, he comes back to me and pulls my dress up my body and tosses it aside. I didn't bother with a bra either. I'm naked before him, loving the heat I see in his eyes and the way his cock is so hard and ready for me.

Laying his body on top of mine, I groan at how good it feels to have his skin against me. I wrap my arms and legs around him, groaning when he positions his thick head against my wet slit, careful to not enter me.

"Yes," I murmur against his lips before he has a chance to ask me again.

"I need you inside me, Luc. Please fuck me."

With a ragged groan, he slides his head into me, and I gasp at the sharp pain. My pussy clenches around him as my whole body tenses. He freezes above me, kissing me gently as he cups my face. He kisses a path down my neck, it instantly soothes me, and I feel my body begin to relax.

His teeth scrape along my collarbone, causing my body to break out in goosebumps. I use my legs to pull him closer, and he gives me what I want by sliding in some more. When I clench too tightly, he stops again, kissing his way to my tit. He sucks my nipple hard, making me arch my body up to him. I run my hands through his hair, holding him close to me as he scrapes his teeth over my sensitive skin before giving me a not-so-gentle bite. I gasp and buck my hips up, taking him in another inch.

"More," I whisper in a ragged voiced that I barely recognize as my own. "Give me all of it, Luc," I beg.

I feel him smile against my tit. He teases me with this tongue and teeth until I'm begging and whimpering for him to fuck me. When I don't think I can take one more second of his teasing, he slams into me with a groan, making me let out a sharp scream at the shock of it. I pull his face back up to mine. I want as much of him inside me as possible. He slides his tongue between my lips, fucking me harder as he kisses me slowly, gently. The contrast drives me crazy, and I'm not surprised when I feel the beginnings of another orgasm.

He's made me cum so many times now, but nothing compares to the feeling of cumming around that thick cock of his while he rams it into me in a fast, relentless rhythm. I feel like I'm being torn in two in the best possible way. The orgasm unravels me and all I can do is let the pleasure wash over me, embracing it even as it threatens to drown me.
###chapter 256
Serena's POV

When I opened my eyes, night had already fallen. I'd learned that giving in to passion could indeed be endless, consuming every moment until time lost all meaning.

I shifted slightly in bed, immediately sensing movement from the man beside me. To say I woke him wouldn't be accurate - he had been awake all along, waiting for me to stir from my slumber.

"Are you hungry?" Lucas asked, his voice carrying that characteristic deep resonance, now tinged with a hint of satisfaction. While he appeared energetic and refreshed, I felt completely drained, every muscle in my body protesting.

"What time is it?" I managed to ask.

"Ten in the evening."

"So late," I couldn't help but exclaim.

"Indeed." Lucas's response carried an unmistakable note of pleasure, making no attempt to hide his contentment.

"Where's Milo?" I asked about his son, concern creeping into my voice.

"He said he's old enough to sleep by himself now, so he's already tucked in bed." Lucas paused before adding with a slight smile, "He also mentioned that he thinks he'd make a good big brother."

I glanced at him, struggling to sit up. Lucas reached out to help me, and as the cotton sheets slid away, I caught sight of the marks scattered across my pale skin - too many to count, each one a testament to our passionate encounter.

I turned to look at Lucas, my gaze questioning.

He shifted slightly, appearing almost apologetic. "I was actually trying to hold back."

I couldn't help but think that if this was him showing restraint, I might not have survived without it.

"Do you want to get up?" he asked, clearly trying to change the subject.

"Yes."

"I'll get your clothes."

"Thank you."

As Lucas pushed back the covers to stand, I noticed he was still completely undressed despite having been awake for some time. As he moved to leave the bed... I quickly turned my face away.

"Miss Sinclair, there's nothing you haven't seen," he said, his voice carrying that irresistible charm.

I chose to ignore his comment.

"After all, in broad daylight we..."

"Could you please talk less?" I cut him off.

Lucas left the room laughing. Watching his retreating form, even his back radiating joy, my expression grew serious, thoughts turning dark and heavy.

After we dressed, we made our way to the dining room. The staff had prepared dinner, and we ate in silence until I finally spoke.

"Lucas, I want to return to Manhattan."

I saw his hands freeze mid-motion, still holding his cutlery. Perhaps he already understood that my surrender to passion was merely a prelude to departure.

"There isn't really any danger," I set down my fork, speaking with careful deliberation. "As long as you're with Rachel, I'll be safe."

"I won't be with her."

"You should marry her," I enunciated each word clearly.

Lucas's grip on his utensils tightened visibly. His voice turned cold. "So this is what you wanted to tell me after we shared such intimacy?"

"Let's call it even."

"Even?" He laughed, a harsh sound devoid of humor. I knew he had believed our encounter was born of mutual love, not a prelude to a final goodbye.

"What we had started as a brief affair, and that's how it should end," I said, meeting his gaze steadily.

"Serena, stop lying to yourself!" Lucas barely contained his anger. "You're not as indifferent to me as you pretend. Otherwise, today wouldn't have happened. You wouldn't have given yourself so completely, wouldn't have...enjoyed it so much."

His words hung in the air between us, heavy with accusation and hurt. I could see the pain in his eyes, the confusion warring with anger.

"I have physical needs too," I said with deliberate coldness, meeting his steel-gray eyes. "I want to end the shadows of the past. End everything completely."

He just laughed - a cold, bitter sound that cut through me like winter wind. The laugh didn't reach his eyes, which remained fixed on mine with an intensity that made my heart ache. But I couldn't falter now.

"We should never have been together," I continued, keeping my voice steady despite the trembling in my chest. "Meeting that first time was a mistake." I took a slow breath, steeling myself. "Lucas, as I've said before, the best thing for both of us is for you to return to Rachel, and for me to live my own life, doing what I choose to do."

"After all this time," he asked, his voice carrying a trace of hope that I had to crush, "you haven't wavered at all?"

"No." I made my voice sharp and final. "Being with you only fills me with anxiety. I never know when I might unknowingly provoke Rachel, never know when she might try to..." I swallowed hard. "When she might try to end me. The accusations, the attempts on my life, and now using Milo to threaten me..." My voice cracked slightly. "Lucas, I can't take it anymore."

"It's almost over," he said softly, his words carrying the weight of a promise.

I shook my head, pushing my barely-touched salad around the plate. "It's never over. Even if this current crisis ends... it's just the calm before the next storm. I don't know if I can survive what might come next. I can't predict the horrors waiting for us. I'm human, flesh and blood. I can't endure this constant assault on my life."

"Serena..." he started, but I cut him off.

Taking a deep breath, I decided to reveal the final truth: "If I truly wanted to be with you, I wouldn't keep trying to leave. When I make a decision, it's after careful consideration. And there's one more thing you need to know."

I forced myself to maintain eye contact as I continued: "That day, at your company's anniversary celebration, your grandfather took me aside to your family home. He told me everything - that Milo and Stella are my children, that you were the man I was with that night. Then he demanded I leave you."

"My grandfather..." he started, his jaw tightening.

"Let me finish," I interrupted, watching his lips press into a thin line. "Yes, I'm not someone who simply accepts orders. I wouldn't have agreed easily. But he made me an offer, and I accepted."

"What offer?" His voice was dangerously quiet.

"He said if you and Rachel had a successful marriage, I could take Milo and Stella with me." I watched his eyes turn sharp and predatory.

"So even though I was angry, even though I couldn't stand being manipulated like that, I agreed. For me, Milo and Stella are more important than anyone else. Losing you to keep them safe? I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'd give up my own life if it meant protecting them."

I watched the emotions warring across his face as I spoke softly: "This time, I'm not discussing this with you. I'm begging you. Please, be happy with Rachel. As parents, I'm willing to sacrifice everything for Milo and Stella. Can't you be selfless too? Just this once?"

His throat worked as he swallowed, his emotions finally settling into something resembling calm. "Is this really what you want?"

"Yes," I answered without hesitation. "It's what I want."

"Fine." His acceptance was sudden and sharp.

My heart constricted painfully, but I knew this was the best choice. For all of us.

"When are you leaving?" he asked.

"Tomorrow."

"I'll arrange your flight back."

"No need. Atticus will handle it." I said directly. Seeing his expression, I added, "Since we're ending things, I'd prefer to minimize our contact."

"...Alright."

"Thank you." I said sincerely.

I picked up my fork again, forcing myself to eat even though everything tasted like ash. I watched him stand and leave, knowing he'd barely touched his food either.

I made myself finish the meal. As a mother, I didn't have the luxury of neglecting my health. I needed to stay strong for Milo and Stella.

Later that night, I stood in the doorway of their bedroom, watching them sleep. Stella was curled on her side, one hand clutching her favorite stuffed rabbit, while Milo lay sprawled on his back, his dark hair tousled against the pillow. Looking at their innocent faces, peaceful in sleep, I knew I would never regret today's decision.

I thought back to the first time I'd learned they were mine - the shock, the joy, the overwhelming love that had threatened to bring me to my knees. I remembered every moment since then: Stella's shy smiles gradually becoming more frequent, Milo's enthusiastic hugs growing more confident. The way they both lit up when I entered a room, as if some part of them had always known I was their mother.

Walking quietly into their room, I adjusted Milo's blanket where it had slipped down. He stirred slightly but didn't wake. Next to him, Stella made a soft sound in her sleep, and I gently smoothed her hair back from her forehead. 

"Sleep well, my darlings," I whispered, barely audible. "Mama loves you more than anything in this world."
###chapter 257
Serena's POV

I prepared to say goodbye to Milo and Stella. My heart felt heavy, knowing this separation was necessary but painful. Until Lucas finalized his situation with Rachel, the children would need to stay with him. As much as it pained me, I couldn't be cruel enough to separate them from their father right now. More importantly, I knew they would be safer with Lucas, given the current circumstances.

"The car is ready," Lucas's voice came from behind me, his tone carefully neutral.

"Okay." I knelt down to Milo and Stella's level, gently touching their soft cheeks. Their eyes, so much like their father's, looked at me with a mixture of trust and uncertainty that made my heart ache. "You'll see Mommy again when you return to the city for school in a few days," I promised, trying to keep my voice steady.

"Yes, Mommy," they nodded obediently. 

Their simple acceptance broke my heart. I could tell they had expected me to stay after yesterday, to become a permanent part of their lives. But they were too mature for their age, asking no questions, simply accepting what the adults in their lives decided. Their quiet understanding hurt more than any tears or tantrums would have.

Lucas approached, holding out a small pill. Morning-after contraception. I had planned to stop at a pharmacy later, knowing it would still be effective within three days, but I accepted it without comment. These were the practical realities of adult relationships.

"I'll wait in the car," he said, turning away. The contrast between yesterday's intimacy and today's carefully maintained distance spoke volumes about our complicated situation.

After taking the pill with some water, I hugged Milo and Stella one final time. Each second of embrace felt precious, knowing it would need to sustain us until our next meeting. Through the car window, I watched them standing on the steps, their small figures growing more distant as Lucas's driver pulled away. Milo clutched his sister's hand, both their faces painted with confusion and longing that made my chest tight. I promised myself silently that soon, very soon, I would have them by my side permanently.

I turned forward, forcing myself to regain composure. Lucas sat beside me in complete silence, his profile rigid and unreadable. It wasn't until we started climbing higher instead of descending that I realized his villa sat halfway up the mountainside, surrounded by dense forest that provided natural privacy and security. The winding road took us higher still, through stands of winter-bare trees dusted with frost.

The early morning mist parted to reveal a clearing where two helicopters waited, their blades still. The sight surprised me, though I maintained my neutral expression. The car came to a stop, and we both stepped out into the crisp mountain air.

"The helicopter will take you to where Atticus is waiting," Lucas said, his voice professional and distant. Gone was any trace of last night's tenderness.

"Thank you," I replied, matching his tone.

He gave a slight nod, our eyes meeting briefly. Neither of us said goodbye. Some endings are better left unspoken.

As I climbed aboard the helicopter, Lucas remained by the car, a solitary figure in the morning light. I could feel his eyes on me even though I didn't look back. The rotors began to spin, whipping up small clouds of dust and fallen leaves. The ground fell away beneath us as we lifted into the pale winter sky.

I tried not to let my eyes betray me, but I could feel them growing red and swollen. Though I deliberately avoided looking at Lucas as he became smaller and smaller before disappearing entirely, tears threatened to spill. There was an inexplicable emptiness in my chest that made it hard to breathe, as if a vital part of me had been torn away.

The helicopter circled for over thirty minutes before finally descending onto a clearing in the outskirts of the city. Atticus's black sedan was already waiting there, along with several other vehicles-security measures had been heightened significantly since the incident.

As I struggled with my crutches, attempting to maneuver out of the helicopter, a steady hand appeared before me. Looking up, I found Atticus in his wheelchair, offering assistance. The accident had clearly taken its toll on him as well.

I accepted his help without hesitation, using his arm for support as I made my way into the black sedan. As we pulled away, the helicopter lifted off behind us, disappearing into the morning sky.

Only then did I fully understand why Lucas had been so confident about his villa's security. It was practically impenetrable-first, its location was nearly impossible to track from the air, and second, even if someone managed to find it, the mountainous terrain offered natural protection against intruders.

I found myself staring in the direction the helicopter had vanished, lost in thought.

"Missing him already?" Atticus's voice broke through my reverie.

"No," I replied, lowering my gaze.

I could feel Atticus studying my face. Despite my composed exterior, he could probably detect traces of my earlier tears.

"Why aren't you staying with Lucas? He seemed to be protecting you quite effectively," Atticus asked directly.

"You'll be disappointed to hear this," I met his gaze, "but I helped reunite Lucas and Rachel."

Atticus paused, then shrugged dismissively. "If that's what you think is right, so be it. We're business partners-your personal choices are your own. Besides, you were always clear about your intentions, so I hadn't set my expectations too high. Though I am curious what made you decide to truly part ways with Lucas..."

"That's personal," I cut him off.

"Fair enough," Atticus didn't push further.

The car wound through the city streets before stopping outside an elegant café.

"Are you sure about this?" Atticus asked.

"I wouldn't have asked you to bring me here otherwise."

"Want me to join you?"

"Despite your admirable resilience..." I glanced at his legs, my tone slightly teasing.

Atticus chuckled, "We're quite the pair, aren't we?"

As I reached for the door handle, I felt his hand catch mine.

"Take this," Atticus said.

I flinched slightly at the contact, still uncomfortable with physical proximity, even knowing his preferences.

If Atticus noticed my discomfort, he didn't show it. He placed a small black device, about the size of a thumb drive, in my palm. "If you sense any danger, press this button. My team will come immediately."

I met his steady gaze.

"I believe in repaying debts," his eyes were resolute. "You saved my life. Your safety is now my responsibility."

I accepted the device, tucking it into my purse. "Thank you."

"Take care."

Supporting myself with the crutch, I made my way alone into the café.
###chapter 258
Rachel's POV

I sat in the private room, taking measured sips of my latte. Four security personnel stood positioned at the corners of the room, with two more outside. Perhaps such an elaborate security arrangement was overkill for meeting Serena, but I'd learned never to underestimate her. After all, the most dangerous predators often appeared the most harmless.

The guard by the door spoke quietly into his earpiece, announcing her arrival. I nodded, maintaining my composure while my heart rate quickened ever so slightly. When she appeared in the doorway, leaning on a cane and completely alone, I couldn't quite hide my surprise. The last time I'd seen her, she'd been surrounded by her usual entourage. Now, here she was, vulnerable and seemingly defenseless. It had to be a trap.

"Sit," I said coolly, gesturing to the chair across from me. She didn't hesitate, lowering herself carefully into the seat. I noticed she favored her left side-the injury wasn't just for show.

"Would you like something to drink?" I asked, maintaining the pretense of civility.

"Water," she replied simply. Her voice betrayed nothing.

The silence that followed felt heavy with unspoken accusations. I set down my cup, the soft clink against the saucer unnaturally loud in the quiet room. "I must admit, Serena, I'm rather surprised you'd come to see me alone. I'm... flattered by your apparent trust."

The words tasted bitter in my mouth. When I'd received her request for a meeting, I'd spent hours trying to decode her true intentions. She wasn't stupid-she knew exactly what I'd done, how close I'd come to destroying her, not once but three times. Yet here she sat, seemingly at my mercy. The rational part of my mind screamed that this had to be some elaborate scheme, but curiosity had gotten the better of me. I wanted to see what game she was playing.

"Why did you ask to meet?" I asked directly. Two decades of navigating the Thorne family's complex social dynamics had taught me when to dispense with pleasantries.

"I'm here to discuss Lucas," she said, her gaze steady. "And to clarify our situation."

I felt my expression darken. Was she here to gloat? Everyone in our circles knew that Lucas's heart belonged to her, that his marriage to me had been nothing but a business arrangement. The whispers, the pitying glances-I'd endured them all, telling myself it didn't matter as long as I had the Harrington name.

"What exactly do you want to clarify?" My fingers tightened around my cup.

"As of today, Lucas and I are finished. Completely and permanently." Her words were clear, precise, like surgical cuts.

My heart stuttered, but years of experience kept my face neutral. Our previous encounters had taught me to be wary of anything that seemed too good to be true. Serena Sinclair didn't give up-not on anything, and certainly not on someone she loved.

"I'd appreciate it if you'd stop wasting your resources on monitoring me," she continued, her tone matter-of-fact. "Your attention would be better spent elsewhere."

I couldn't help but laugh, the sound sharp and brittle. Did she really expect me to believe she was walking away? Just like that? I hadn't survived this long by being naive. Twenty years of carefully cultivating my position, of learning to spot every subtle manipulation and hidden agenda-did she think I was that easily fooled?

Before I could voice my skepticism, she reached for her phone and slid it across the table. 

My hands trembled as I stared at the photos on my phone screen, feeling my blood turn to ice in my veins. As someone who had always prided myself on maintaining perfect composure, I found myself utterly failing to keep my emotions in check. Rage surged through me like wildfire, threatening to consume everything in its path.

"What exactly are you trying to prove?" I fixed my gaze on Serena Sinclair, my voice barely containing the fury building inside me. The audacity of this woman was breathtaking-mere minutes ago, she had been calmly discussing how Lucas and I had gone our separate ways, and now here she was, showing me intimate photos of them together? Was this her way of gloating? Of marking her territory?

The more I thought about it, the more my anger intensified. She knew perfectly well that despite my long-standing engagement to Lucas, our relationship had remained strictly formal. We hadn't shared even the most basic intimacies-not even holding hands properly. Every interaction had been measured, calculated, appropriate for public consumption. Yet here she was, flaunting these photos like some sort of trophy.

"Serena Sinclair," I spat out her name like it was poison, "don't think for a moment that I won't retaliate." My fingers gripped the phone so tightly I could hear the case creaking.

She met my gaze with infuriating calmness, her composure only feeding my rage. "These photos aren't meant to prove the depth of my relationship with Lucas," she said evenly. "And I'm certainly not showing off. Consider this a demonstration of boundaries-mine, specifically. Cross them, and I'm perfectly capable of making everything public."

I studied her with cold calculation, trying to see past the confident exterior to any hint of weakness. But there was none. The woman before me was different from the one I'd first met all those months ago. Gone was the uncertain heiress trying to find her footing in our world. In her place stood someone who had learned to wield power with the same ruthless precision I'd always prided myself on.

"Let me be perfectly clear," she continued, her voice carrying an edge I'd never heard before. "If you dare touch anyone I care about, I won't hesitate to burn everything to the ground-my reputation, yours, all of it. How do you think society would react to learning about this twisted triangle between us? How would your grandfather handle the scandal? The Thorne family name doesn't carry enough weight to survive that kind of publicity, does it?"

The realization hit me like a physical blow. This wasn't just about showing me photos-this was calculated retaliation. Because I had used kids to threaten her, she was now demonstrating that she could play the same game, and play it better.
###chapter 259
Serena's POV

"For someone like me, I'm just a nobody," I said deliberately, weighing each word as I spoke. The private room in the coffee shop suddenly felt smaller, more confining. "In the eyes of the Thornes and Harringtons, I'm worthless. If I'm destroyed, it wouldn't be much of a loss - after all, it wouldn't be the first time. But if you and Lucas were to fall..." I let the implication hang in the air. "Now that would be an incalculable loss, wouldn't it?"

Rachel Thorne's eyes flashed with contempt, a bitter smile playing across her lips. "Serena Sinclair, you're even cleverer than I expected. I wonder what Lucas would think if he knew how calculating you really are? The same Lucas who would sacrifice everything - even his life - to save you. How do you think he'd feel knowing it was all for nothing?"

I met her gaze unflinchingly. "You're right, it wasn't worth it. That's precisely why I'm making it clear to you now - Lucas and I are done. If I could use him to this extent, what makes you think I ever planned on reconciling with him?"

As I spoke these words, my mind was racing through the events of yesterday. None of it had been accidental - not the adult indiscretion, not the supposed act of gratitude. Everything had been meticulously orchestrated from the moment Rachel had threatened to use Milo against me. I'd been planning how to make her back off permanently.

I knew with absolute clarity that given the vast disparity in our social standing and influence, I could never control her directly. The only viable option was to find leverage. But obtaining compromising information on Rachel Thorne in such a short time frame was nearly impossible. Lucas was my only real weapon against her.

Rachel seemed to sense my strategy. She let out a cold laugh. "You really think, with the combined influence of our families, we couldn't suppress any news story? Look at Jace Gillard's accident - such a major incident, yet the public knows nothing. Surely you understand that our reach extends far beyond what you can imagine."

I went straight for the jugular: "What about Atticus Thorne?"

Her face darkened instantly, and I knew I'd hit my mark. "Oh, I'm well aware I'm no match for your family's influence. But Atticus? He's a different story. What do you think he'd do if I shared this information with him? He'd break off your engagement to Lucas in a heartbeat."

Rachel's expression contorted with rage. "I have to admire your cunning, Serena. You always know exactly what moves will benefit you most. But you're overplaying your hand! You should know very well why those previous 'accidents' happened, and who was behind them."

I watched her carefully, my heart rate accelerating though I maintained my composed exterior.

"Since I went to such lengths before, do you really think I'd pass up such a perfect opportunity when you've walked right into my trap?" Her smile sent chills down my spine. "From the moment you reached out to meet today, I never intended to let you leave here alive."

Fighting down my growing unease, I countered, "Aren't you concerned about my backup plans? If anything happens to me, everything I just showed you goes public immediately."

"But I have your phone now," she said smugly. "How exactly do you plan to get anything to Atticus? I can move much faster than he can track down your supposed backup files."

Maintaining an air of casual indifference, I reached into my bag, pretending to pull out a tissue while secretly pressing the signal button hidden inside. The corresponding device in Atticus's possession would now be flashing red. I knew I was playing with fire, but this was my only chance.

Suddenly, Rachel made a subtle gesture. The guard behind her pulled out a gun and aimed it at my head. An icy chill ran down my spine, but I forced myself to maintain my composure.

"Didn't expect I'd go this far, did you?" She laughed maniacally.

Despite my best efforts to hide it, I knew my fear was becoming visible. No one can truly remain unfazed when staring down the barrel of a gun. All I could do was pray that Atticus would receive my signal and arrive before the worst could happen.

"Will you regret dying by my hands, Serena?" Rachel's voice dripped with contempt. She twirled her wine glass, the deep red liquid catching the light. "You know, I've imagined this moment countless times. How many opportunities I've missed, and now here you are, walking right into my trap. Your arrogance has always been your downfall, Serena Sinclair."

I maintained my composure, though my fingers gripped the armrests of my chair tight enough to turn my knuckles white. "Do you really think Lucas will ever forgive you if you kill me?" My voice remained steady, masking the rapid calculations running through my mind as I assessed my options.

She let out a harsh laugh that echoed off the wood-paneled walls. "Forgive me? Does he forgive me now?" Rachel leaned forward, her perfectly manicured nails drumming against the tabletop. "He already hates me, Serena. What's one more reason? At least with you gone, he'll have nothing left to hope for."

The weight of the situation pressed down on me, I held her gaze, refusing to show fear. The silence between us grew thick with tension, broken only by the faint hum of the air conditioning.

Rachel's patience finally snapped. She rose from her chair, her tall frame casting a long shadow over me. Her dress whispered against the carpet as she moved, a sound that seemed unnaturally loud in the tense atmosphere. The triumph in her eyes was unmistakable as she savored what she believed to be her moment of victory.

She paused beside me, close enough that I could smell her expensive perfume. Looking down at me with cold satisfaction, she addressed the security guard standing by the door. "Make it clean."

"Yes, ma'am," the guard responded, his face impassive.

Rachel started walking toward the door. "I'll spare myself the unpleasant scene. You know, Serena, you should be grateful you've lived this long. Your time was borrowed from the moment you stepped into our world. Consider this an overdue correction."

I watched as she gestured for the guard to open the door, my mind racing through scenarios, remembering every detail of the room's layout, every possible weapon or escape route. The heavy door swung open with a soft creak.

In that instant, everything changed. The barrel of a black pistol appeared, pressed firmly against Rachel's forehead.
###chapter 260
Rachel's POV

The moment the door opened, I found myself staring down the barrel of a gun aimed directly at my forehead.

My eyes narrowed sharply as adrenaline surged through my body. The two security guards behind me reacted instantly, drawing their weapons and training them on the figures in the doorway.

The scene before me made my blood run cold-at least ten men in black suits formed a wall of dark fabric and gleaming metal, their weapons all pointed in our direction. Through the gap they maintained in their formation, I could see my cousin, Atticus Thorne, seated in his wheelchair at the far end of the corridor. His expression was utterly devoid of emotion, a coldness in his eyes that sent chills down my spine.

What alarmed me even more was the sight of my two guards who had been stationed outside-both unconscious on the marble floor.

I could feel the color draining from my face as I processed the situation.

"What exactly are you trying to accomplish here, cousin?" I demanded through gritted teeth.

"Whatever you're trying to accomplish, dear cousin," he replied, his voice as cold as winter frost.

"Is turning siblings against each other over a woman really worth it?" I attempted to reason with him.

"Are you certain it's this woman that's turning us against each other?" His tone dripped with sarcasm.

I drew in a deep breath, changing tactics. "If there are misunderstandings between us, we can have Grandfather Clarence and Grandfather Silas discuss them properly."

I deliberately invoked Silas Thorne and Clarence Thorne's names as leverage. But my cousin seemed to have anticipated this move.

"You've always loved playing games, cousin, but I'm tired of them. Will you release Serena or not?"

"And if I refuse?" I responded with steel in my voice.

"She dies, and you'll join her."

"You wouldn't dare!" Rage colored my words. "Are you really prepared to kill me in cold blood? Do you think my grandfather would let you live if I died?"

"He wouldn't let me live either way!" Atticus shot back with devastating accuracy.

My heart skipped a beat at his words.

He continued, his voice growing colder with each word: "Everyone knows who was behind the recent accident. If Lucas hadn't tried to save Serena, if she hadn't insisted on pulling me out too, I would be dead already. Perhaps it's time we settled that score as well." His voice sent ice through my veins.

"What proof do you have that I was behind the accident?" I challenged, fighting to keep my voice steady.

"None," he stated simply. "And I don't need any."

I pressed on, trying to maintain control of the situation: "Have you considered the consequences of your actions? How will you maintain your position in the family? How will your grandfather explain this? Forget about him-your actions will bring the full force of the law down on you! Your entire family will crumble."

"Now that you mention it..." I noticed my cousin's momentary hesitation.

A glimmer of triumph flashed in my eyes. Our family had always been ruthless when it came to protecting our interests, often at the expense of our conscience. We would abandon even our closest relatives if necessary, let alone someone who merely owed us their life.

But his next words froze the blood in my veins.

"I just realized something," he said, a dangerous edge to his voice. "If we continue this standoff, your grandfather or brother might order you to kill Serena immediately. Then I'd have to kill you in retaliation. After that, your grandfather and brother would have the police arrest me, and without me, my family would have no way to challenge yours. What a convenient solution for them, don't you think?"

The color drained from my face as an icy realization gripped my heart.

He was right-terrifyingly right. While not absolutely certain, there was a high probability of exactly that scenario playing out. If our standoff continued and my grandfather and brother learned of the situation, they might very well give such an order.

The men surrounding me might appear to be my protection, but ultimately, they answered to my grandfather. They would follow his commands without question.

"Your time to decide is running out, cousin," Atticus reminded me, his voice cutting through my thoughts.

I clenched my jaw in frustration. The thought of letting this opportunity slip through my fingers was maddening.

But to trade my life for Serena's? That was a step too far. Who was she to be worth such a sacrifice? What right did Serena Sinclair have to be considered equal to my life?

"What is it about Serena that makes everyone willing to throw their lives away for her?" The words burst from my lips, sharp and bitter. The question had been eating at me for days, watching how people gravitated toward her, protected her, sacrificed for her. "First you, and then Lucas Harrington-both of you ready to destroy everything!"

Atticus's steel-gray eyes met mine, his composure unwavering. The fading sunlight caught the edge of his profile, highlighting the resolution etched into his features. "I can't speak for Lucas," he replied, his voice steady and measured. "But Serena saved my life. It's ironic, really-if your family hadn't tried to have me killed, I might never have formed such a deep bond with her. So in a way, I should thank you for that."

His words struck like individual daggers, each one precisely aimed. I could see the ghost of a smile playing at the corners of his mouth as he added, "So, dear cousin, have you made your decision? Time isn't exactly on our side here."

The weight of the moment pressed down on me. I knew exactly what he meant-every second I hesitated could have devastating consequences. The choice before me was clear, yet the words stuck in my throat like thorns. My nails dug deeper into my palms as I wrestled with my pride, with the fury that threatened to consume me.

Finally, through clenched teeth, I turned to my security team and commanded, "Release her."

The sound of a door opening behind me was followed by slow, uneven footsteps. I turned to watch as Serena emerged from the adjacent room, leaning heavily on a crutch. Her face was pale but composed, her chin held high despite her obvious discomfort. She didn't spare me a single glance as she made her way toward Atticus, her steps deliberate and determined.

I felt my face contort with rage and helplessness as I watched them. Serena's strength, even in weakness, only fueled my anger. Her simple gray dress and disheveled hair couldn't mask the dignity she carried, and it made me want to scream. How dare she maintain such composure after everything?

Atticus placed a protective hand on her elbow, supporting her as they moved toward the door. His security team filed out after them, their footsteps echoing in the tense silence. I remained rooted to the spot, watching as my carefully laid plans crumbled before my eyes.

The room felt suddenly vast and empty, the afternoon light now harsh and unforgiving. The silence was broken by the distinct sound of a phone vibrating. One of my security guards cleared his throat.

"Who is it?" I demanded, not bothering to turn around.

"Mr. Garrett Thorne, ma'am."

My stomach clenched. "What does he want?"

"He asked if Miss Sinclair had been collected by Mr. Atticus."

"And?" The word came out sharp enough to cut.

"I confirmed that she had left with him. Mr. Thorne ended the call after that."

The implications of that brief exchange hit me like a physical blow. A cold realization crept up my spine as I pieced together what it meant. My brother had known-he had known all along that I would have to let her go. The thought made me feel sick.
###chapter 261
Serena's POV

Sitting in Atticus Thorne's car, I drew in a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves.

To be honest, I wasn't nearly as composed as I appeared. No one can truly remain calm when staring down the barrel of a gun. I had just been desperately fighting to contain my fear, to keep my exterior from betraying the trembling within.

I kept telling myself that Atticus was trustworthy. If I had misplaced my trust this time, well, I'd have to accept whatever fate had in store for me.

"I thought you were fearless," Atticus said, his teasing tone barely masking his reproach. "Going to meet Rachel alone? Did you think you were bulletproof or something?"

I turned to look at him. "Would you have stayed away?"

"If I hadn't given you that signal device, you'd be dead in there right now." His voice carried a weight that made my stomach clench.

Thank goodness for his foresight. Thank goodness he knew Rachel's nature so well-her ruthless determination to achieve her goals at any cost.

"Actually..." I confessed, "when I asked you to drive me, it was because I wanted your protection. Otherwise, I could have gone to see Rachel by myself."

Atticus froze for a moment, then his voice changed entirely. "So you're telling me you knew all along how I would react? You knew I would protect you when you went to see Rachel? Serena, you're too clever for your own good. You didn't say a word but predicted my every move. Weren't you afraid that you might not matter enough to me?"

"You always talk about repaying debts," I replied seriously.

"I could have been lying."

"But I won the bet, didn't I?"

He fell silent. We both knew any further argument was pointless.

"Serena, I'm gay. How could you trust me so completely?" Atticus still seemed bewildered.

"That's exactly why I trust you," I said softly. "Because relationships between men and women are the most fragile-they shatter at the slightest touch."

I could see Atticus wanted to say more. He was clearly still unhappy about my reckless behavior today. But something in my calm demeanor seemed to make him hold back his criticism.

I knew what he was thinking. I had indeed been pushed to my absolute limit-otherwise, I would never have risked my life to meet Rachel, never have truly and completely given up on Lucas.

The car pulled up to the private airport. Naturally, Atticus wouldn't be accompanying me-he was feeling unwell, and Portland was his territory. With the Thorne family's internal politics so tense right now, he needed to stay and handle his affairs. Getting me safely to the plane was more than enough.

After a brief goodbye, I boarded Atticus's private jet. A few hours later, I was back in Manhattan.

As soon as I deplaned, I was met by a reception committee. Four men in black suits stood before me, one of them saying respectfully, "Under Mr. Thorne's orders, we're here to escort Miss Sinclair home."

I frowned and called Atticus.

His voice was firm: "Don't think you're safe just because you're back in Manhattan. Let me tell you straight-given the current situation, you're not safe anywhere. That's why I've arranged these four security personnel to protect you 24/7. Don't refuse-I'm too busy to attend your funeral."

I hadn't planned to refuse anyway. I just wanted to say, "Thank you."

Atticus seemed to pause for a couple of seconds. "Just don't die. And build up your business empire-that's the best way to thank me."

"I'll do my best."

After hanging up, I followed the security team Atticus had sent to the waiting car. Looking out at the familiar Manhattan streets, I found myself lost in thought. How had I become entangled in so many complications? How long would it take to finally put all of this behind me?



Nina's POV

I sit in my spacious office at Sinclair Group, scrolling through my phone as news feeds flood with stories about Lucas Harrington and Rachel's upcoming wedding. Just three days until their grand ceremony. 

I've called Serena multiple times, but she hasn't picked up once. She's clearly avoiding me. I just wanted to throw her perfect little world in her face, show her how Lucas ultimately chose Rachel over her. What happened to all that dignity she pretends to have?

But honestly, it doesn't matter. I lean back in my chair, taking in the view of Manhattan's skyline through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Finally, I don't have to bow and scrape to anyone anymore. After all these years of playing second fiddle to Serena, I've never felt more satisfied.

The sharp ring of my phone cuts through my thoughts. Rachel Thorne's name flashes across the screen.

"Ms. Thorne," I answer, my voice automatically shifting to a sweetened tone that makes me hate myself a little more.

"There's a private dinner tomorrow evening in Portland. You'll attend." Rachel's cold voice leaves no room for discussion.

"I actually have a business engagement tomorrow that-" I try to explain, but she cuts me off sharply.

"Nina Sinclair, you'd do well to remember your place. You're in no position to negotiate with me." Her words slice through the air like ice.

I grip the phone tighter, saying nothing. My knuckles turn white from the pressure.

"Make sure you look presentable. I shouldn't have to tell you how to handle these things." The line goes dead before I can respond.

I slam the phone down on my desk, trembling with rage and humiliation. Every month, like clockwork, she summons me to these "private dinners" with powerful men. Forces me to do things that make my skin crawl. But I can't refuse - not if I want to maintain this facade of success. Even though each time leaves me retching in my bathroom at home, mascara running down my face as I try to scrub away the evening's memories.

This is all Serena's fault. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have been so desperate to prove myself, wouldn't have made that devil's bargain with Rachel. Now I'm trapped, playing the perfect socialite while dying inside.
###chapter 262
Serena's POV

I was lying on my couch, mindlessly scrolling through my phone on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Like millions of others across the country, I found myself waiting for the live stream of Lucas Harrington and Rachel Thorne's wedding. A union between two of the most prominent families had captured the nation's attention, and here I was, another spectator to their fairy tale.

The camera focused on Lucas, standing tall in his perfectly tailored black tuxedo, a white boutonnière pinned to his lapel. Even through the screen, his presence was commanding. I couldn't help but notice how the camera lingered on his face, capturing that characteristic intensity in his grey eyes that I knew all too well.

My phone buzzed with an incoming call from Atticus Thorne. I hesitated before answering, watching his name flash across my screen.

"Have you seen the news?" He cut straight to the point.

I deliberately played dumb. "Which news are you referring to?"

"The fact that you can still joke tells me you're holding up better than expected," he remarked.

"Why wouldn't I be fine? This was always going to happen," I countered, surprising myself with how steady my voice sounded. Nothing about this should affect me - I'd seen it coming from miles away.

"That's what I admire about you, Serena. You could watch the world burn and not bat an eye."

I cut through his psychological analysis. "Aren't you supposed to be at the ceremony?"

"I am."

"Then why are you calling me?"

"Can't help worrying about you."

"Don't waste your energy," I replied coolly.

Suddenly, Atticus's tone shifted to something more conspiratorial. "Serena, I can't shake this feeling that today's ceremony isn't going to go as smoothly as everyone expects. What do you think?"

"I think you're imagining things," I dismissed his suggestion. "This is a merger of the Harrington and Thorne dynasties. Who would dare disrupt that?"

"We'll see about that."

I ignored his cryptic response and returned my attention to the livestream. The cathedral was packed with guests, though the camera carefully avoided clear shots of the attendees - too many prominent faces in one room. Rachel appeared in a stunning ivory gown, her face partially hidden behind a delicate veil as she clutched a bouquet of white roses. She walked down the petal-strewn aisle on her father's arm while the organ played the traditional wedding march. The guests rose in unison, all eyes on the bride.

Lucas stood at the altar in his white tailcoat, waiting. When Rachel reached him, her father lifted her veil and kissed her forehead before placing her hand in Lucas's. I noticed the tears glistening in Rachel's eyes.

The priest began the ceremony: "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the presence of God to witness the union of Lucas Harrington and Rachel Thorne..."

Then came the crucial moment. The priest's voice rang out solemnly: "Lucas Harrington, do you take Rachel Thorne to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish until death do you part?"

The cathedral fell silent. Every eye and camera focused on Lucas's face. But instead of the immediate "I do" everyone expected, he remained silent. The seconds ticked by like hours. I saw Rachel discreetly squeeze his hand, trying to prompt him. Lucas turned to look at her, then back to the priest, and said, "I..."

I closed the livestream. There was no point in torturing myself further. I switched on the TV and started watching a movie, my mind wandering to thoughts of when I could have Milo and Stella back with me.

Before long, Atticus called again. "Exciting enough for you?"

"Nothing extraordinary," I replied dismissively.

"Your composure is remarkable. If Lucas knew how unbothered you are, he'd probably be devastated - assuming he's not too busy being arrested right now."

"What?" That stopped me cold. I quickly reopened the streaming app, but the feed was gone. When I searched for news about the wedding, every single mention had vanished, as if it had never existed.

"Done checking?" Atticus asked calmly.

"What happened?" I forced myself to keep my voice level, even as my heart started racing.

"Still nervous?" Atticus teased.

"I just want to know the truth," I replied honestly. "After all, whether Lucas and Rachel's wedding proceeds normally affects both my safety and my personal interests."

The truth was, I was being selfish. At this moment, my biggest concern was whether I could get Milo back if something went wrong with the wedding.

Atticus shrugged, finally stopping his playful taunting. "During the wedding ceremony, just as Lucas was about to answer the priest's question about whether he would take Rachel as his wife, federal agents arrived with an arrest warrant. They took him into custody on suspicion of corporate misconduct."

My fingers involuntarily tightened around my phone.

"Do you understand what this means?" Atticus asked.

"It means the wedding won't happen," I answered calmly.

Atticus let out a short laugh, his tone carrying a hint of reproach. "Serena, I can hardly watch this. Lucas has gone to such lengths for you, willing to sacrifice his reputation and future to stop this wedding, and you're just sitting there, completely unmoved?"

"What else can I do? What power do I have to change anything?" I challenged back. "I don't even understand how this is different from him simply refusing the Thornes directly. Either way, his reputation is ruined!"

"Aren't you usually the clever one?" Atticus asked, eyeing me skeptically.

I felt anger rising but chose to remain silent.

Atticus continued his explanation: "If Lucas had directly refused the Thornes' wedding arrangement, do you think they would have accepted that smoothly? Wouldn't they have threatened the Harringtons? You can't fight against people with that kind of influence head-on."

"But now he's still left with nothing," I said.

"But he can protect everyone else," Atticus emphasized each word.

I bit my lip as he continued: "Now that Lucas faces legal troubles, the Thornes absolutely won't let Rachel have any further association with him. This way, the broken engagement isn't because Lucas refused - it's because the Thornes withdrew. He even gave them a face-saving reason to call off the wedding without embarrassment."

"Aren't you worried about the Thornes retaliating behind the scenes?" I asked skeptically. "What if Rachel seeks revenge because she couldn't have Lucas? She's capable of anything."

"Maybe, but the Thorne family won't support that. They're public figures who care about their image. They won't kick someone who's already down, especially since the Harringtons no longer hold any value for them. They'll be too busy looking for their next strategic alliance. As for Rachel's personal vendetta - dealing with her alone isn't much of a threat."

I fell silent, unable to form a response. I couldn't even tell if Lucas had truly destroyed his career or if he had actually broken the law. Wasn't he supposed to marry Rachel? How did everything go so wrong?
###chapter 263
Serena's POV

"I've had people make inquiries," Atticus said. "Lucas is being held at the Portland detention center. Since the alleged misconduct occurred in Manhattan, the case will likely be tried here. They'll probably transfer him back to Manhattan within a few days. Do you want to see him now in Portland, or wait until he returns?"

"I need time to think," I said.

"Then I'll leave you to your thoughts." Atticus hung up.

I leaned back against the couch, staring at the ceiling, lost in thought. Suddenly, so many things seemed unclear.

The next day, news of Lucas's arrest at his wedding broke. The initial media blackout followed by sudden widespread coverage could only mean one thing - the Thornes had completely abandoned him.

Sure enough, within half an hour of the news breaking, the Thorne family released a statement. Citing their century-old tradition of integrity and uprightness, they declared they would never allow anyone with criminal allegations to tarnish their family name. They officially announced the nullification of Lucas and Rachel's engagement.

The public reaction was immediate and divided. Some criticized the Thornes for their cold-hearted abandonment in times of trouble. Others supported their decision, arguing that criminal allegations were different from other issues and deserved severe consequences. The majority sided with the Thornes - after all, they still held power, while the Harringtons had lost their voice entirely.

Five days later, Atticus messaged me to say Lucas had been transferred back to Manhattan, including the address of the detention center where he was being held.

I continued to sit there, my mind racing with possibilities. The carefully constructed plans I had made were now lying in ruins, and I couldn't help but wonder if this had been Lucas's intention all along - to make himself so toxic that the Thornes would have no choice but to break the engagement. But at what cost?

After some hesitation, I decided to go. The meeting with Lucas went smoothly-Atticus must have arranged everything in advance. We sat facing each other in the sterile room, surrounded by a suffocating silence. Looking at his haggard appearance, a twinge of sympathy stirred in my heart, but I found myself at a loss for words.

"Are the allegations true?" I finally broke the silence. I needed to know the truth.

"No," he answered simply.

My heart skipped a beat. "Was this to break off the engagement?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"It was the only way to ensure everyone could walk away unscathed."

"What about you?" I asked, struggling to keep my emotions in check.

"Does it matter to you?" He suddenly smiled. Despite his worn appearance and the stubble on his face, somehow, even in such a dejected state, his smile remained devastatingly handsome.

I didn't answer. There was no point anymore. I had learned about his case from Atticus-he was being charged with corporate malfeasance involving billions. With numbers that high, he could face life imprisonment.

"How is this any different from choosing to marry Rachel?" I finally spoke, each word laden with anger. "To me, you being imprisoned is no different from you marrying Rachel!"

"Are you afraid I'll die in here?" he asked again, seemingly unmoved by my anger.

"I'm not afraid, but I feel sorry for kids," I replied coolly. "He has such an irresponsible father. But don't worry. Next time, I'll be more careful in helping them find a better daddy."

"Planning your next move while I'm still breathing?" he said with a hint of teasing.

"I'm not joking."

"I won't die," he stated plainly. "Since the allegations are false, I won't be convicted. This is simply the cleanest way to make the Thornes withdraw from the engagement."

"And then what?" I challenged him. "What happens when the Thornes realize you played them?"

"By then, they won't have the power to retaliate."

I furrowed my brow, suddenly glimpsing something in his words.

"That's all you need to know," he cautioned, then added softly, "Serena, as long as I'm breathing, I won't let Milo and Stella call anyone else 'daddy.'"

"Take care of yourself first," I retorted. But seeing his confident demeanor, I felt somewhat reassured. Lucas wouldn't be foolish enough to throw everything away just to break off an engagement. He was far too intelligent for that. I had to trust he had a plan.

"I'm leaving," I said, having gotten the answers I came for. I stood up to go.

"Serena." His voice stopped me, deep and tinged with emotion.

I paused, looking at him. "What is it?"

"Take care of Milo during this time."

"I know."

"And take care of yourself."

"I've always been good at taking care of myself."

"Don't fall for anyone else," he added.

I rolled my eyes. Even at a time like this?

"When I get out, I'm going to pursue you properly."

"I won't wait forever," I replied.

I saw his eyes flicker, a brilliant light dancing in them for a moment.

I turned away, my back to him, feeling heat rise to my cheeks.

As I was leaving, I heard him say, "It's a promise."
###chapter 264
Serena's POV

I stepped out of the Detention Complex, taking a deep breath of the crisp autumn air. Though Lucas's words had given me some reassurance, I couldn't completely shake off the weight pressing down on my chest. Some emotions remained stuck in my throat, neither rising nor falling.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the concrete steps as I made my way toward my car. That's when I spotted a familiar figure-Rachel Thorne. She hadn't appeared in public since Lucas's arrest, and the Thorne family had claimed she was bedridden from the emotional shock. While she wasn't actually ill, the toll was evident in her ghastly pale complexion and the dark circles under her eyes.

I couldn't help but wonder why she had chosen to visit Lucas here in Manhattan when she hadn't bothered to see him in Portland. Was it her family's interference that had kept her away? Despite my curiosity, I had no desire to engage with her and attempted to walk past without acknowledgment.

"Serena," she called out, her voice sharp with hostility.

I paused, keeping my expression neutral. "Yes?"

"You came to see Lucas?" The question carried an accusatory edge.

"Is there a problem with that?"

"What right do you have to see him?" Her composure cracked, voice rising with each word. Several passersby turned to look, but she seemed beyond caring about the attention.

I maintained my calm demeanor, though my heart was racing. "Your engagement has been dissolved. Lucas is free to choose who he sees. I don't need your permission."

"How dare you show your face here after what you've done to him?" Rachel's hands were trembling now, her designer purse clutched so tightly her knuckles had turned white. "You're the reason he's in this situation!"

I pressed my lips together, her words striking deeper than I wanted to admit. The guilt I'd been trying to suppress threatened to surface. The evening traffic created a constant background hum, filling the momentary silence between us.

"Lucas deliberately committed those financial violations, didn't he?" Rachel's voice took on a hysterical edge. "He orchestrated everything just to force my family to break off the engagement! He chose potential imprisonment over marrying me!" Her carefully maintained facade was crumbling, revealing the raw pain beneath.

I took a slow breath, choosing my words carefully. "Whatever decisions Lucas made regarding your engagement are between you and him. If you want answers, you should ask him directly."

"You don't understand anything!" Rachel stepped closer, her perfume overwhelming in its intensity. "He was different before you came along. We had everything planned-our future, our life together. Then you appeared, and suddenly nothing I did was good enough anymore."

"Rachel-" I started, but she cut me off.

"You think you've won?" Her laugh was brittle, bordering on manic. "This isn't over, Serena. If anything happens to Lucas in there, I'll make sure you pay the price. The Thorne family has a long memory, and we don't forgive easily."

She turned on her heel and stormed off, leaving me standing alone on the sidewalk. I watched her retreating figure, understanding with perfect clarity the truth of the situation: Rachel's feelings for Lucas were genuine, but her family's priorities lay elsewhere. The moment Lucas became a liability rather than an asset, they had discarded both him and Rachel's happiness without hesitation.


Rachel's POV

I stood there, feeling the burning sensation in my eyes as tears threatened to fall, staring directly at Lucas. He was right in front of me, yet he seemed so distant, his face a mask of cold indifference.

"Is she worth all this, Lucas? Is Serena really worth it?" The words escaped my lips before I could stop them, my heart twisting like a knife in my chest.

"This has nothing to do with her," he replied coldly. "It's just... circumstances beyond my control."

"I know you're doing this for her." My voice was filled with certainty. I knew him too well-every subtle change in his expression, every nuance in his voice.

"I wouldn't gamble with my life so carelessly." He continued his denial.

"You'd throw away your life for Serena without a second thought!" The words burst from me, almost a scream.

He chose silence. That silence hurt more than any words could have.

I found myself laughing, a bitter laugh that dissolved into tears. I must have looked insane, but I couldn't control myself anymore.

"Lucas, did you know? I'm getting married again." As I said these words, I noticed his eyes flicker slightly. Finally, a crack in his emotionless facade.

"That's how it is in the Thorne family," I continued, my voice trembling. "We're all just pawns from the moment we're born. Me, my parents, my brother-all of us." The tears kept falling, but I felt numb to them now. "And I always thought I was the lucky one. In a family where we have no freedom, where we can't choose who we marry, I thought I was blessed because the man I was supposed to marry was the man I loved."

He maintained that cold, distant stare, offering no response.

I couldn't hold back anymore: "I thought it wouldn't matter if you didn't love me back. As long as we were married, as long as you were by my side, I could be content. But why... why did you do this to me? Lucas, what's wrong with me? How am I inferior to Serena? I knew you before she did, I've been by your side longer than she has, I love you more than she ever could. Why can't you love me? Why won't you even look at me properly?"

My voice grew more desperate with each word. From the moment they took him away, I'd wanted to see him, to demand answers. But my family kept me under close watch, refusing to let me leave. Only when I agreed to marry another man did my grandfather allow me this visit. That was the price I paid to see him.

"I'm sorry." Three words, delivered with the same icy detachment.

I looked at him with a bitter smile: "Lucas, you'd rather face death than marry me. Well, I can use the same determination to make you pay."

His expression suddenly turned even colder. "I strongly advise against that."

"You pushed me to this!"

"If you want to survive in the Thorne family, you'll stay out of this." His words carried a clear threat.

"And if I refuse?"

"You'll face consequences far worse than your current situation."

"You think you can threaten me?" I said with biting sarcasm. "Lucas, not marrying me was your biggest mistake. Once you rejected the Thorne family's protection, you became nothing. And all those people you're trying to protect? They'll suffer right along with you."

"Rachel, think very carefully about your next move." His face darkened dangerously.

I noticed it then-how he, who had always been indifferent to me, showed such reaction at the mere suggestion of harm to Serena. The realization cut through me like a blade.

"I'll make you regret this, deeply." I smiled cruelly, wiped my tears, and turned to leave.

I could feel his cold gaze following me as I walked away, could imagine his clenched fists. But I didn't care anymore. Since he chose to hurt me, I would make sure he experienced the same heartbreak.
###chapter 265
Serena's POV

I was driving back when my phone rang. Howard Harrington's name flashed on the screen, making my heart skip a beat. The last time he had summoned me to the Harrington mansion still haunted my memories.

"Serena Sinclair." His stern voice came through the speaker, each syllable weighted with authority.

"Mr. Harrington." I kept my voice respectful, steady, despite the anxiety bubbling beneath the surface.

"Come to the mansion. I'm waiting." The line went dead before I could respond.

I gripped the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles turning white. The decision to go wasn't really a choice - Milo and Stella were there, and I needed to bring them home. Besides, with everything Lucas had done, surely Howard wouldn't completely disregard his grandson's wishes by doing anything drastic. What's done was done; we could only move forward now.

The autumn evening cast long shadows across the mansion's manicured grounds as I pulled up to the entrance. Following the housekeeper through the familiar corridors, I couldn't shake the feeling that the entire place felt colder, emptier since Lucas's accident. The usual warmth that permeated these halls, largely due to the children's presence, seemed to have vanished, leaving behind an almost palpable tension.

Howard's study, with its dark wood paneling and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, had always intimidated me. Now, standing before his massive desk, that feeling only intensified.

"Mr. Harrington," I greeted him first, determined to maintain some control over the situation.

He studied me for what felt like an eternity, his weathered face unreadable. The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken accusations and regrets. I could see the conflict in his eyes - the struggle between his role as the family patriarch and his love for his grandson.

Finally, he released a heavy sigh that seemed to carry the weight of years. "In all these years," he began, his voice unusually quiet, "Lucas has never defied me. Not once. From the day his parents died, he's been the perfect grandson - responsible, obedient, everything I could have asked for."

I remained silent, understanding the pain behind his words. How do you respond when someone tells you that you're the reason their perfect world has crumbled?

"I knew he had feelings for you," Howard continued, his gaze boring into mine. "But I never imagined... never thought he would go this far." His voice cracked slightly on the last words, revealing a vulnerability I'd never seen in him before.

"I considered revenge, you know." The sudden shift in his tone made me tense. "Even now, with everything that's happened, I have enough influence to make your life very difficult." His eyes glittered dangerously. "But I couldn't bring myself to do it. Yet this anger, this disappointment - it sits here." He tapped his chest. "Making it impossible for me to accept you!"

I met his gaze steadily. "I'm sorry," I said softly, meaning it. Though many events had been beyond my control, from his perspective, I was the catalyst for everything that had gone wrong.

"Before Lucas went away, he asked me to entrust Milo and Stella to your care." Howard brushed aside my apology as if it were irrelevant. "You probably remember our original arrangement - Lucas would marry Rachel, and you would get custody of the children."

My breath caught in my throat. I could see where this was heading.

"Obviously, that marriage didn't happen." His voice turned cold. "When we made our deal, we never specified what would happen if the marriage fell through because of outside interference. But the fact remains - you were involved in its failure. Therefore, I have no intention of honoring our agreement about the children."

I felt my heart rate accelerate, but forced myself to remain outwardly calm. The thought of losing Milo and Stella, especially now when they needed stability more than ever, was unbearable.

"They need consistency right now," I said carefully, choosing my words with precision. "With Lucas temporarily away, uprooting them from their routine would be traumatic."

Howard's expression hardened. "Don't presume to tell me what's best for my great-grandchildren, Ms. Sinclair. They are Harringtons. They belong here, with their family."

"They are with family when they're with me," I countered, surprising myself with the firmness in my voice. "I'm not trying to take them away from you, Mr. Harrington. I'm trying to give them the stability they deserve while Lucas absent."

The mention of Lucas's condition seemed to age Howard instantly. He slumped slightly in his chair, the facade of the powerful patriarch cracking just enough to reveal the worried grandfather beneath.

"You really love them, don't you?" he asked quietly, studying my face with new intensity.

"More than I ever thought possible," I admitted, letting my guard down for the first time since entering the room. "They're not a bargaining chip to me, Mr. Harrington. They're children who need love and support, especially now."

"Without Lucas, our family only has Milo and Stella left." his voice was measured.

The meaning was clear - Howard intended to make Milo and Stella the heirs to replace Lucas, just as Lucas had once replaced his father. I opened my mouth but swallowed the words that threatened to emerge. At this moment, I found it impossible to voice my intention to take Milo and Stella away, even though this had been Lucas's arrangement.

"Could I still visit them regularly, like before?" I finally compromised.

Looking at Howard before me, I couldn't help but reflect on how few people remained by his side. Lucas's parents had passed away years ago, Jace Gillard was between life and death after a terrible accident, and Lucas was awaiting sentencing. Only Clara remained with him now, along with her daughter Maeve. Clara had secretly divorced Grant Yates, who had already left the Harrington family behind.

Who could have imagined that the once-illustrious Harrington family, such a grand dynasty, would suddenly become so fractured?

After I spoke, Howard remained silent for what felt like an eternity. A bitter disappointment welled up inside me. Truthfully, regardless of whether I had the capability, my conscience and moral compass wouldn't allow me to simply take Milo and Stella away. Yet they were my children - I couldn't pretend they didn't exist, nor could I bear the thought of not seeing them for extended periods.

"Take them," Howard suddenly said.
###chapter 266
Serena's POV

I froze, thinking I had misheard. When I looked up at him, I saw the weariness in his eyes, that resigned acceptance of life's cruel turns. Though Howard was in his seventies and confined to a wheelchair, he had always maintained an image of vitality and natural authority, elegant yet commanding. I never imagined I would see him defeated by life - I had always believed that even as time aged his body, his spirit would remain undiminished.

"Milo and Stella will live with you from now on," he repeated.

"And what about you?" I couldn't refuse, nor did I want to. I knew Howard wouldn't have made this decision without careful consideration.

"I... it's time for me to let go," I heard him say heavily. "I wanted too much, demanded too much. Everything in the Harrington family has developed according to my vision. I've been autocratic for so many years, yet it hasn't brought any good fortune. Perhaps I was wrong from the very beginning."

Watching this once-powerful patriarch speak such words, I understood he had truly surrendered to fate. He had given up the fight, broken by too many devastating blows.

He continued: "When Lucas's parents died, I was the one who insisted they travel abroad for that business deal. If it weren't for me, they wouldn't have met with that accident." I saw his aged eyes grow slightly red. "Later, when Jace had that terrible car accident, it was my stubborn refusal to accept his relationship with Eleanor that drove him away. If I had set aside my prejudices and convinced Clara, if I had allowed Eleanor to stay with the family despite our history, Jace would have remained with us, and perhaps many tragedies could have been avoided."

"Jace's accident couldn't have been your fault..." I tried to comfort him.

But he just shook his head, taking all the blame upon himself.

"And now there's Lucas. If I hadn't forced him to marry Rachel Thorne, if I had supported him instead, he wouldn't have taken such extreme measures to break off the engagement."

I didn't know how to console him. The Howard before me seemed truly crushed by life, aging decades in a single moment.

"I will be going abroad to stay with Jace during his treatment. Only Clara and Maeve will remain here. I'll hand over many company responsibilities to Clara, though she may not be capable of managing everything... her heart was never in the business." He spoke with detachment. Looking at the vast Harrington enterprise, he seemed no longer to care about its fate.

"If she can't keep it together, I'll sell the company. Without such a prominent name, without all the glory, perhaps returning to normalcy will mean fewer tragedies." Listening to his words, I felt he had truly let go of everything. When a person no longer harbors desires, wealth, reputation, and power indeed become meaningless.

"Take Milo and Stella with you," he said once more.

I looked at him intently. "If you miss them, call me anytime. Whether we're in Manhattan or abroad, I'll find a way to bring them to you."

He nodded slightly.

"Please take care of yourself."

Finally, I stood up, bowed slightly, and left Howard's study.

I descended the grand staircase. My heart clenched as I spotted Milo and Stella sitting quietly on the ivory sofa, their small frames dwarfed by the massive piece of furniture.

The moment I appeared, Milo's face lit up. He jumped to his feet, his dark curls bouncing as he ran toward me with the boundless energy only a six-year-old could possess. "Mommy!" His clear, bright voice rang through the hall, wrapping around my heart like a warm embrace.

Stella followed her twin brother more deliberately, her gray eyes-so like her father's-sparkled with a mix of hope and hesitation. "Mommy..." she said softly, the word carrying all the weight of her careful nature. These twins had become my world's center, a gift I never expected to receive.

I crouched down to their level, my eyes meeting theirs. "Do you understand that you'll be staying with me now?" I asked gently, watching their expressions carefully.

Milo's brow furrowed in that endearing way that reminded me so much of Lucas. "Daddy told us we'd live with you after he married our godmother. But Mommy, he didn't marry her, did he?" His innocent question carried the confusion of a child trying to understand adult complexities. "Did Daddy do something wrong? Why did those people take him away?"

Beside him, Stella remained quiet, but I felt her small hand slip into mine. She had always been the more intuitive of the twins, often sensing the emotional undercurrents that Milo missed. Her gesture wasn't seeking comfort-she was offering it, trying to support me in her own way.

My chest tightened. These children were barely seven, too young to be caught in this web of adult complications. They should be worried about playground games and favorite cartoons, not their father's arrest or family upheaval.

"Your daddy will be fine," I assured them, forcing strength into my voice. "Everything will work out."

"That's what Daddy said too!" Milo declared with unwavering faith. 

Stella nodded solemnly. "He told us he'd come back no matter what," she added, her voice carrying that peculiar mix of childish softness and mature understanding that always caught me off guard. "He made us promise to take care of you, Mommy."

I felt tears threatening to spill. These children, so young yet so perceptive, made me acutely aware of how much time we'd lost, how many moments I should have been there for.

"Don't cry, Mommy." Stella reached up with her delicate fingers to catch a tear I hadn't realized had escaped. Her touch was feather-light, careful, as if she was handling something precious. "Milo and I will stay with you."

"Yeah!" Milo puffed out his chest, trying to look bigger than his small frame allowed. "I'm the man of the house now. I'll protect you and Stella!" His declaration, made with such earnest determination, nearly broke my composure entirely.

"Thank you, sweetheart," I managed, drawing both children into a tight embrace. They smelled of lavender shampoo and that indefinable scent of childhood-clean and sweet and innocent.

As we prepared to leave, Walter appeared with their bags, already packed and waiting by the door. The children's favorite toys and books had been carefully included-Stella's sketch pad and colored pencils, Milo's toy cars and his beloved stuffed penguin.

Before we stepped out, I guided the children to turn around for one last look. On the second-floor terrace, Howard sat in his wheelchair, watching us. The morning light cast his face in shadow, but I could see how tightly his hands gripped the armrests.

"Say goodbye to Great-grandfather," I whispered to the twins.

They waved obediently. Stella, in her characteristic way, blew a kiss-her special farewell that never failed to bring a smile to the old man's face, even in his darkest moods. Today was no exception; I caught the slight softening of his stern expression.

Milo, not to be outdone, called out, "Bye, Great-grandpa! We'll come visit soon!" His voice echoed in the vast space, filled with the simple certainty of childhood promises.

From our distance, I couldn't make out the details of Howard's expression, couldn't tell if the glint in his eyes was from tears or just the morning light. But I saw him raise one hand in a slight wave, a gesture so small yet carrying the weight of generations of family history, pride, and pain.

As we turned to leave, Stella tugged at my sleeve. "Mommy," she whispered, "will Daddy's house be sad without us?"

The question caught me off guard with its profound simplicity. I looked down at her serious little face, seeing the worry etched there. "Houses aren't sad or happy by themselves, sweetheart," I explained softly. "They're just waiting for the people they love to come back."

"Like we're waiting for Daddy?" Milo asked, his hand finding mine.

"Exactly like that," I agreed, squeezing his small fingers gently. "And while we wait, we'll make our own home together."
###chapter 267
Serena's POV

The media couldn't get enough of the Harrington family saga these days. With Lucas Harrington's situation dominating headlines, I found myself constantly bombarded with news updates. Every morning brought fresh revelations about the family's troubles, spreading across news channels and social media like wildfire.

The foundation of the Harrington empire was being stripped bare for all to see. I watched helplessly as report after report detailed the deteriorating state of Harrington International Holdings' management issues and the mysterious disappearance of Jace Gillard. The negative press seemed endless.

Online forums buzzed with rumors about Jace's disappearance. Some claimed he'd abandoned ship after discovering the Harrington empire was crumbling, citing his status as an adopted member of the family as proof of his disloyalty. These speculations hurt to read, but the Harringtons maintained their silence, refusing to address any of the circulating rumors.

Two months later, everything changed. The Harrington family officially announced their intention to sell their business interests. The very speculation that had run rampant was becoming reality. The public seemed stunned by this development-how could the mighty Harringtons surrender so quickly? Without Lucas at the helm, had the family truly become rudderless?

The announcement of the sale triggered a frenzy in the business world. The Harringtons' influence touched virtually every major industry sector, and acquiring any piece of their empire meant instant market leadership. Their portfolio was too vast for any single buyer, leading to a fierce competition among potential investors. I found myself among them.

Truth be told, I hadn't initially planned to bid on any Harrington assets. But something kept pulling me back to the idea-I wanted to preserve something for Milo and Stella's future. Perhaps these small pieces could one day serve as the foundation for rebuilding.

Atticus Thorne became my partner in this venture. His keen interest in the Harrington businesses, combined with his financial backing, made him an ideal ally. We spent countless hours strategizing about which assets to target and how to structure our offers.

During one of our strategy sessions, Atticus dropped a bombshell: "Rachel Thorne is announcing her new engagement in a few days."

I frowned at this news. I'd heard from Atticus that his family had quickly arranged a new marriage for Rachel, but the timing seemed incredible. Lucas's trial hadn't even begun, and she was already preparing to marry someone else?

"Who's the groom?" I couldn't help asking. Atticus had been surprisingly tight-lipped about it before, though I knew he generally shared information freely with me, having little reason to keep secrets.

"Kennedy Rowan from Massachusetts," he replied deliberately.

My frown deepened. The match represented a significant step up in social circles, perfectly aligned with the Thorne family's ambitious nature. With Lucas out of the picture, they clearly aimed even higher.

"Doesn't this concern you?" I asked Atticus. His father Clarence had previously focused on building political connections through conventional means, but this marriage would catapult them into an entirely different sphere of influence. Once secured, it would give Clarence tremendous leverage over his brother Silas.

"Of course it does. Haven't you noticed how scarce my visits have become lately?" Atticus admitted frankly that since Rachel's engagement to the Rowan heir became known, their family dynamics had grown increasingly tense.

"Do you have a plan?" I pressed.

"There's some internal maneuvering happening, but it's better if I keep you in the dark about certain details," he replied.

I didn't push further. In these situations, knowing too much could be dangerous, and I had no desire to get caught in the Thorne family's web of intrigue.

"By the way," Atticus added, "Lucas's trial starts in two weeks. Has he found the evidence he needs? With charges this serious, anything less than definitive proof of innocence could mean life imprisonment, if not worse."

I bit my lip gently. Though my visits to Lucas had been limited, each time I saw him, he exuded an inexplicable confidence about his situation. I couldn't understand the source of his certainty, but I chose to trust in it.

"After two months of relative calm, it feels like we're heading into another storm," Atticus observed. "Though I suppose we should be grateful that Rachel is under such close family scrutiny right now. Given her temperament, she might otherwise have caused trouble for you. The family's terrified that any misstep could jeopardize her marriage to Kennedy Rowan."

I've always been wary of Rachel Thorne. The past two months have been suspiciously quiet, which only makes me more anxious. I can't shake the feeling that she's plotting something, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

After hanging up with Atticus Thorne, I felt slightly more at ease. At least until Rachel's wedding, I should be relatively safe. We didn't discuss it further - he's a busy man, after all, and the call ended quickly.

Sitting in my office, I glanced at the clock and made a decision. With the four security guards Atticus had assigned to me, I headed to the detention center. When I saw Lucas, my heart clenched - he'd visibly lost weight. Each day since his imprisonment, he seemed to grow thinner. Though he always greeted me with a smile during my visits, it couldn't mask how poorly he was doing.

"Don't look at me like that," he said with a resigned smile. "I know I'm not exactly looking my best."

He wore the standard-issue uniform, his head freshly shaved - a far cry from his usual polished appearance. I had to look away, not because of his appearance, but because seeing him so gaunt broke my heart. I knew about his chronic stomach condition. When properly managed, it rarely flared up, but without proper care, the pain could become unbearable. I couldn't help but wonder if he ever regretted his choice, knowing the physical toll it would take.

"Your grandfather is liquidating the family's assets," I informed him, watching his reaction carefully.

"I know," he replied, his voice steady. "Before I came here, I discussed it with him. When you're too visible, you become a target. Selling everything now is actually the best way to protect the family. If we truly have nothing left, no one will waste their time coming after us anymore."

"Don't you feel any regret?" I asked, studying his face through the visiting room window.
###chapter 268
Serena's POV

Lucas's eyes met mine, still holding that same quiet strength I'd always admired.

"Money, status, power - they're all temporary pleasures," Lucas says with surprising serenity, his voice carrying clearly through the phone receiver. "Once you've experienced them, that's enough." I can't help but think that even Howard, in his final moments of acceptance, hadn't achieved such tranquility. Perhaps it's easier for Lucas to be philosophical about it all - after all, he didn't build this empire with his own hands. Or did I misjudge him?

"How's your case progressing?" I ask, trying to keep my voice steady despite the anxiety churning in my stomach.

"Good news, actually," he replies, maintaining eye contact. "I received the court notification yesterday. The hearing is set for the 27th - just twelve days from now."

My heart skips a beat. "Lucas, don't lie to me." The words tumble out before I can stop them. Suddenly, I'm terrified of facing the reality of his situation. The uncertainty of his fate weighs heavily on my shoulders. What if this is truly the end?

"I wouldn't dare lie to you anymore," he says with a self-deprecating smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes. "I'm being honest."

"Don't worry," he adds, attempting to comfort me through the glass. "If something happens to me, you have my blessing to marry someone else."

The words leave me speechless, my hand tightening around the phone receiver.

"I'm kidding," he quickly adds, his voice softening. "You haven't even married me yet..."

Something breaks loose inside me, and before I can second-guess myself, I blurt out, "If you make it through this unharmed, I'll marry you."

Lucas freezes, clearly caught off guard by my sudden declaration. The happiness in his eyes is tinged with disbelief, as if this moment of joy is too precious to be real.

"I mean it," I emphasize, each word deliberate and clear. "I promise."

"Alright," he responds, his voice carrying a slight tremor of emotion that he tries to mask.

Attempting to lighten the suddenly intense atmosphere, I change the subject. "By the way, Rachel is marrying Kennedy Rowan."

"Is that so?" He raises an eyebrow, his response surprisingly measured.

"You don't seem surprised," I observe, studying his reaction.

"Not really. The Thorne family needs powerful allies right now. There are only a handful of families in their league, and Kennedy was bound to be one of Rachel's potential matches."

I can't help but press further. "Don't you feel any guilt towards Rachel?" After all, from beginning to end, Rachel's only crime was loving him too deeply. Despite her questionable actions behind the scenes, her feelings for Lucas had always been genuine.

"Some," he admits without hesitation, "but not much. She repeatedly tried to harm you - I couldn't overlook that."

"But she was good to you..." I begin, only to be cut off.

"You matter more to me than she does," he states firmly. His meaning is clear: he might forgive actions against himself, but never against me.

My heart flutters at his words, touched by his unwavering devotion.

"What's wrong? Do you want me to be kinder to her?" he asks, eyebrow raised. Despite his gaunt appearance, his expression remains commanding and slightly teasing.

"No," I reply honestly.

"No?" he prompts.

"I just wanted to confirm your feelings," I admit.

A small smile plays at his lips. "Serena, do you know how much joy your little moments of jealousy bring me?"

"I'm glad my discomfort entertains you," I say dryly, but the warmth in my eyes betrays me.

I didn't linger long with Lucas outside the detention center, but as I walked away, my heart grew heavier with each step. Twelve days. The number kept spinning in my mind. What would happen after twelve days? Would he really be released without charges? I found myself sinking deeper into anxiety and uncertainty.

Finally, those twelve days passed. Since it wasn't the weekend, I needed to take the twins to school first.

"Mom, is something bothering you?" Milo asked from the backseat, tilting his head up. Next to him, Stella watched me silently, her gray eyes-identical to Lucas's-flickering with concern.

"What makes you say that?" I forced a smile.

"Well, when I asked for yogurt at breakfast, you gave me regular milk instead. And when I mentioned needing my spring uniform for the school event today, you pulled out my winter one," Milo listed methodically.

"And," Stella added softly, "when you did my hair this morning, even the ribbon was crooked. You're usually so precise about everything." Her delicate fingers touched the askew ribbon in her hair, her eyes full of worry.

"I probably didn't sleep well last night," I offered as an excuse. In truth, I hadn't slept at all, leaving me exhausted today. More than that, though, the thought of Lucas's court hearing had me inexplicably anxious. I hadn't told the children any of this-I didn't want them worrying about adult matters.

"Mom, is it because of Dad's court hearing today?" Milo suddenly asked.

I froze. So much for trying to hide it from them. But how did they know?

"We watch the news too, you know," Milo said matter-of-factly, as if reading my confusion.

Stella quietly placed her hand on my arm. "Dad will be fine. I dreamed about him last night-he came home and brought us presents." Her voice was soft but filled with conviction. "My dreams always come true."

My heart melted at their words. These twins, one comforting me with his innocent optimism, the other supporting me with her quiet wisdom. They both resembled Lucas so much, yet each had their own unique personality.

At school, I got out to walk them to the entrance. Watching them wave goodbye side by side, my vision blurred unexpectedly. Stella turned back one last time, her look seemingly saying, "Stay strong, Mom." I wondered if after today, our family of four would finally be reunited. I'd never yearned so much for completeness before, but having these adorable twins made the hope for happiness feel especially intense.

Lucas, you really can't disappoint us today...

After dropping off the children, I drove to the courthouse. Four security guards in dark suits followed me-I'd grown accustomed to their constant presence. The reporters waiting outside the courthouse seemed startled by this entourage, initially hesitating to approach. However, after glancing around, they couldn't resist the pull of a hot story and began closing in.

The security team immediately formed a protective circle around me, keeping the reporters at a one-meter distance as they fired questions:

"Miss Sinclair, why are you here? What's your relationship with Lucas Harrington? Reporters have noticed his son Milo seems very close to you."

"What's the nature of your relationship with Garrett Thorne? Are you dating?"

"Do you have any comment on the Thorne family publicly breaking off Rachel Thorne's engagement to Lucas Harrington?"

I maintained my composure, though each question felt like a dart aimed at my carefully constructed walls. The morning's tender moments with the twins felt like a distant dream now, replaced by this circus of flashing cameras and shouted questions. But I wouldn't let them see any weakness-I'd learned that lesson well enough in recent years.

An older reporter pushed forward, his voice cutting through the chaos: "Miss Sinclair, sources say you've been caring for the Harrington twins. How do you respond to allegations that you're using the children to get close to their father?"
###chapter 269
Serena's POV

That question made my blood boil, but I kept my face neutral. 

I stopped walking, turning to face the press directly. The security team tensed, but I gave them a subtle signal to hold their positions. "The welfare of those children is not up for public discussion," I stated firmly, my voice carrying clearly despite its measured tone. "If you have questions about the court proceedings, I suggest you direct them to the appropriate legal representatives."

I paused briefly before adding, "As for why I'm here today... Lucas attended my hearing last time, so I'm returning the gesture."

I signaled my security team to escort me away. The reporters' calls behind me fell on deaf ears. My mind was entirely focused on Lucas's hearing today.

Entering the courtroom, I immediately spotted Spencer Sherwood and Drew Yeager. To my surprise, Maeve was sitting next to Drew! I furrowed my brow at this unexpected sight.

Spencer and Drew had clearly noticed me too. Spencer waved me over. After a moment's hesitation, I decided to join them. First, I had no reason to avoid Lucas's friends - I was certain they knew Lucas was doing this for me, so there was nothing to hide. Second, their seats were perfectly positioned directly opposite the defendant's bench.

After I sat down, everyone greeted me, including Maeve.

"Hello, Miss Sinclair. I'm Maeve," she said with a touch of shyness. Though not a major celebrity, she had been making regular appearances in the media lately and had established a name for herself in the entertainment industry.

"Hello," I responded with a slight nod, deliberately maintaining my distance. I didn't know Maeve well enough to judge her character, but because of her connection to Eleanor, I couldn't bring myself to warm up to her, even if she wasn't necessarily a bad person.

Maeve clearly sensed my reservedness and wisely didn't pursue further conversation.

"Where's Eleanor?" I asked Drew directly, shifting my attention away from Maeve.

I noticed Drew's expression change subtly. Frowning, I could clearly see the emotional ripple beneath his composed exterior. A woman's intuition told me something might have happened between Drew and Eleanor. Despite the physical distance Drew maintained from Maeve, I sensed an underlying connection between them.

"Why the sudden interest in Eleanor Yates?" Spencer interjected. "Hasn't she been out of the picture for quite a while? Right, you and Eleanor were close, and Quinn was too. I never understood what drew you both to her, given how sharp-tongued she could be."

I swallowed the words that had been on the tip of my tongue. It was now apparent that Spencer didn't know about Drew and Eleanor's relationship. This meant their involvement hadn't been made public.

"By the way, Maeve is Drew's girlfriend now," Spencer added teasingly.

I felt my world tilt. Wasn't Drew dating Eleanor? How did Maeve enter the picture? What was going on?

"We still have some time before the hearing starts," Drew said. "Let's step outside, and I'll explain everything."

"Alright," I agreed without hesitation.

Drew and I walked out of the courtroom and found a quiet corridor. He got straight to the point: "Eleanor and I broke up."

"Why?" Although I had suspected as much, I still couldn't understand.

"She never loved me, not really. She's always loved Jace. With me, it was just gratitude. I... I'm letting them be together." Drew smiled faintly. The once cheerful young man now seemed shrouded in melancholy.

"You're saying Eleanor loves Jace?" I still found it hard to believe. Eleanor wasn't the type to change hearts easily. If she had decided to be with Drew, she wouldn't have entertained any possibility with Jace. Besides, hadn't Jace been in a serious accident? Did Eleanor know? Was she by his side?

"As long as she's happy..." Drew said wistfully. "As for me... it doesn't matter."

"So now you're with Maeve?" I set aside my other questions, knowing Drew probably couldn't answer them. Only Eleanor could.

"Yes," Drew nodded. "My parents wanted to set us up, Maeve agreed, so I did too."

"Drew, relationships aren't games. Even if you've broken up with Eleanor, you should take time to heal instead of rushing into another relationship..."

"It's fine," Drew said dismissively. "If it's not Eleanor, it doesn't matter who it is."

I wanted to say more, but he cut me off.

"That's all there is to Eleanor and me. We never went public with our relationship, and I hope you'll continue to keep it private. Just... pretend Eleanor and I were never together."

"Alright," I nodded. I wouldn't have said anything anyway.

"If you see Quinn, please explain it to her too."

"Of course."

"I should head back in," Drew turned to leave.

Watching his dejected figure retreat, I realized he didn't seem capable of smiling anymore. It was as if his happiness had been permanently extinguished.

I pulled out my phone and dialed Eleanor's number. We hadn't spoken in ages. Before, I had avoided contact, afraid I might slip up Jace's situation, potentially affecting her relationship with Drew. Now, there was no need for such caution anymore.

I dialed Eleanor's number, only to be met with an automated voice: "We're sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the number and try again."

My mind raced with confusion - had Eleanor changed her number? No, what shocked me more was that she had completely disconnected her old one. Something felt terribly wrong about this.

Questions began swirling in my head: What secrets lay beneath the surface between Eleanor, Jace, and Drew? While I trusted Drew's account - despite our limited interactions, I knew he wasn't the type to lie - could there be some misunderstanding between him and Eleanor? And what was really going on between Eleanor and Jace? With Jace still in a coma and Eleanor's sudden disappearance, there were too many questions without answers.

"Serena." Quinn's voice pulled me back to reality, and I found myself standing in the marble-lined hallway outside the courtroom.

"Has Eleanor contacted you recently?" I asked suddenly.

Quinn paused, considering her response. "No, she hasn't. I've been swamped with work lately. I tried messaging her a few times, but she never responded. I meant to call her when things calmed down, but something always came up, and I kept forgetting. What's wrong? Did something happen to Eleanor?"

I could hear the tension mounting in her voice.

"Eleanor and Drew broke up," I said quietly.

"What? Eleanor never told me!" Quinn exclaimed, her professional composure momentarily slipping. "Why would they break up? They seemed so good together! Don't tell me Drew was seeing someone else? I always worried about him spending so much time with Spencer..."

"It wasn't Drew," I cut her off. "Eleanor said she's still in love with Jace."

"You can't be serious," Quinn's eyes widened in disbelief.

"That's why I'm convinced there must be some misunderstanding between the three of them. But with Eleanor gone and Jace in a coma..." I sighed, running a hand through my hair. "I'm worried about where she might have gone."

"Her phone's not working?"

"The number's been disconnected completely."

"Then she's probably..." Quinn trailed off, choosing her words carefully. "She's trying to cut ties with everything here. Including us."

I met her gaze, searching for answers.

"She doesn't want any connection to her old life anymore," Quinn said bluntly. "That includes both of us."

"What could have happened?" I pressed.

"I wish I knew," Quinn shook her head slowly, her expression troubled.

"Do you think she might..." I couldn't bring myself to finish the thought, but Quinn understood immediately.
###chapter 270
Serena's POV

"No," she said firmly. "Eleanor would never harm herself."

"Are you sure?"

Quinn's expression softened as she explained: "We've known each other since we were kids. Years ago, we read about a suicide case in the news, and she made me promise something. She told me very seriously that no matter how bad things got, she would never take her own life. She said if that thought ever crossed her mind, she would tell me first. She made me promise that if anything happened to her without warning, I should assume it was murder and seek justice for her."

"That was so long ago - would she still remember that promise?" I couldn't shake my concern.

"She knows I remember, so she won't forget either," Quinn said with conviction. "Besides, remember what she told us? We're her last lifeline. The fact that she hasn't reached out means she's still managing on her own."

I nodded slowly. Quinn had known Eleanor far longer than I had - she would understand her better.

"I'll try my best to track her down," Quinn assured me. "If I hear anything, you'll be the first to know."

"Thank you."

"The hearing's about to start. We should head in."

"I didn't expect to see you here," I remarked, suddenly realizing it was unusual for Quinn to attend Lucas's hearing.

"Professional interest," she replied with a slight smile. "I wanted to observe the proceedings."

Of course - I'd momentarily forgotten Quinn was an attorney herself. The memory of her commanding presence during her own recent court case flashed through my mind.

Together, we walked through the heavy wooden doors into the courtroom. Spencer Sherwood seemed to glance back at Quinn, but ultimately remained silent. She focused all her attention on the courtroom proceedings, deliberately avoiding looking in their direction.

As people gradually filed into the courtroom, my gaze fell on Lucas. My heart clenched at the sight of him - he had lost weight, his once-strong frame now appearing alarmingly fragile. His handsome features were drawn with exhaustion, dark circles shadowing his eyes. I struggled to maintain my composure, fighting back the surge of emotions threatening to overwhelm me.

Spencer couldn't contain his frustration any longer. "What has Lucas been through in there? Hasn't anyone from the Harrington family tried to help?"

Drew remained uncharacteristically quiet, his usual jovial demeanor replaced by obvious concern.

"The Thorne family is watching everything closely," I explained quietly. "It makes intervention... complicated." The words felt bitter in my mouth.

Spencer looked at me, then thought better of whatever he was going to say. After all, this was the path Lucas had chosen for himself. None of us could argue with that.

When Lucas walked to the defendant's stand, he was directly facing me. The moment he lifted his eyes, our gazes locked. I felt tears welling up, but he managed a slight smile - that familiar, gentle upturn of his lips that had always been his way of trying to comfort me, even in the darkest moments.

"I can't believe he can still smile at a time like this," Spencer muttered, shaking his head in disbelief.

Quinn turned to him sharply. "Keep quiet. We need to maintain decorum in the courtroom." Her tone made it clear she thought he was being too talkative.

Spencer rolled his eyes but finally fell silent.

Once all the preparations were complete, the court officer's voice rang out: "All rise! The United States District Court for the Southern District is now in session, the Honorable Judge Wilson presiding."

Everyone stood as the judge, wearing traditional black robes, entered and took his place at the bench. "Please be seated," he instructed. After everyone had settled, he briefly reviewed the court procedures, including maintaining silence and turning off all mobile devices.

"Court is now in session," the judge declared.

What happened next sent ripples of surprise through the courtroom. The prosecution's attorney was revealed to be Benjamin Kennedy, the eldest son of one of the most influential families in Massachusetts and the brother of Kennedy Rowan - who happened to be Rachel Thorne's fiancé. Benjamin Kennedy was renowned as one of the most formidable attorneys in the country, with an undefeated record. However, this marked his first appearance as a prosecutor, a fact that caused visible unrest in the courtroom.

My anxiety intensified. Having Benjamin Kennedy personally handle this case seemed fundamentally unfair to Lucas. The Kennedy family's involvement was likely influenced by their connection to Rachel Thorne. How could such an obvious conflict of interest be permitted?

Quinn must have sensed my rising panic. She leaned close and whispered, "Try to stay calm. The prosecutor's role is primarily to present the facts of the case. Generally, they don't determine the final verdict. There's a fundamental difference between the prosecutor and the plaintiff's attorney. The plaintiff's lawyer advocates for their client's interests, while the prosecutor typically focuses on establishing the truth."

But what if this particular prosecutor had no interest in revealing the truth?

"Let's see how it plays out," Quinn murmured in my ear. "If there's any obvious bias, we might be able to petition for a different prosecutor. This case has significant public attention - media pressure could work in our favor."

I nodded, knowing we had no choice but to wait and observe.

I glanced at Lucas again. He must have recognized Benjamin Kennedy - the man's face was regularly featured in various media outlets. Yet his expression remained perfectly composed, showing neither anxiety nor distress.

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to maintain composure. I had to admit, despite everything, he cut an impressive figure - tall, handsome, with that dangerous combination of refined elegance and sharp intelligence that made him such a formidable prosecutor.

I could feel the weight of dozens of eyes on us, the quiet rustle of reporters' notebooks, the barely contained energy of spectators hoping for drama.

Benjamin Kennedy stepped forward, his voice clear and authoritative as he began his opening statement: "Your Honor, on February 13th, the federal authorities received multiple complaints regarding the defendant Lucas Harrington's activities between 2018 and 2021. While operating his business interests in the United States, Mr. Harrington allegedly conspired with defendants Grayson Chen and Samuel Hunt to manipulate various markets through deceptive practices."

I watched Lucas's face carefully, but his expression remained impassive, his shoulders straight and proud. Even now, facing these accusations, he maintained that quiet dignity that had first drawn me to him.

Benjamin continued, his words measured and precise: "Through concentrated capital advantage and privileged information, the defendants engaged in a complex scheme of artificial trading patterns. This systematic deception led 83 investors to make uninformed decisions, resulting in losses totaling $12.5 billion. Furthermore, evidence suggests their involvement with an international criminal organization, Korsen, in illegal monetary transactions amounting to an additional $7.5 billion."

The gallery behind me erupted in whispers. I could feel the shock rippling through the courtroom, but I kept my gaze steady, focused on Lucas. He sat perfectly still, his profile sharp against the dark wood paneling of the courtroom.

Judge nodded deliberately. "The indictment is properly filed. Please submit the government's evidence to the court."

I watched as the court clerk, a young man in a crisp dark suit, carefully carried the evidence folders to the judge's bench. The fluorescent lights overhead buzzed faintly, the sound mixing with the nervous energy in the room.

"Your Honor," Benjamin announced, "the prosecution requests to call our first witness, a victim and key informant in this case."

At the judge's nod, I saw Finn Burton approach the witness stand. The middle-aged man's face was lined with bitterness, his expensive suit hanging loosely on his frame as if he'd lost weight recently. The moment his eyes landed on Lucas, his composure shattered.

"Harrington, you bastard!" he shouted, his face contorted with rage. "I'll kill you for what you did! You destroyed everything - my family, my life..."
###chapter 271
<###chapter>###chapter 270</###chapter> 

Serena's POV

Judge's gavel crashed down. "Order! This is a court of law, Mr. Burton. One more outburst and you will be held in contempt!"

I watched as Burton forced himself to calm down, his hands gripping the witness stand so tightly his knuckles turned white. The air in the courtroom felt electric, charged with tension and barely contained emotions.

Benjamin Kennedy approached the witness stand. "Please state your name for the record."

"Finn Burton," he replied, his voice trembling with suppressed anger.

"And what was your relationship with the defendant, Mr. Harrington?"

"We were business partners," Burton spat the words out. "Now? Now he's the man who destroyed my life. He convinced me to invest everything I had - my life savings, my children's college funds, even my mother's retirement money. Over $200 million, gone because I trusted him."

As the testimony continued, I observed Grayson Chen and Samuel Hunt being called to the stand. Both men, former executives in Harrington's overseas operations, admitted to participating in illegal activities. The total amount involved in their testimony was staggering - over $20 billion in fraudulent transactions.

When Dylan Anderson, Lucas's defense attorney, stood to begin his cross-examination, I could sense the shift in the courtroom's atmosphere. The gallery erupted in murmurs and whispers, a wave of tension rolling through the assembled crowd.

Judge's face darkened. "Silence!" he commanded, his voice cutting through the chaos. The courtroom fell instantly quiet, the only sound the nervous shuffling of papers.

Dylan maintained his composure as he presented his case with unwavering confidence.

"My client, Lucas Harrington, had no involvement in the alleged fraudulent activities," Dylan stated deliberately, emphasizing each word with precision. "He was unknowingly exploited by Grayson and Samuel, who used his name to conduct illegal operations."

The chief judge leaned forward, his expression stern. "The defense will need to provide evidence supporting your client's innocence."

I watched as Dylan methodically began presenting his evidence. "First, the two hundred million dollars in question were never in my client's accounts. If Mr. Harrington had been involved, he would have had access to these funds. Our investigation shows that while Mr. Harrington's accounts contain substantial assets, every dollar can be traced to legitimate business operations. I can provide comprehensive financial records from 2018 to 2021 demonstrating this."

He continued with unwavering confidence, "Furthermore, I have detailed account statements from both Grayson and Samuel. These records reveal multiple unexplained deposits between 2018 and 2021, totaling approximately sixty-eight million dollars."

My breath caught as Dylan produced his final piece of evidence. "Finally, I have an audio recording that will definitively clear my client of all suspicion. With the court's permission, I would like to play this recording."

The courtroom fell silent as the recording began to play. Two distinct voices emerged through the speakers - one deep and middle-aged, the other younger but authoritative. Their conversation clearly revealed a scheme to use Lucas Harrington's name for illegal activities, including threats and extortion.

When the recording ended, murmurs rippled through the courtroom. Some questioned the recording's authenticity, while others speculated about the speakers' identities.

Dylan approached the judge's bench with measured steps. "This evidence clearly shows that my client was merely an unwitting pawn. And I believe both the judge and the prosecution recognized one of those voices as belonging to Grayson, who is present in this courtroom today."

I shifted my gaze to Grayson, watching as the color drained from his face. His composure crumbled as he stammered, "That... that's not me! I've never recorded anything like that. I don't know where this came from - you're framing me!"

Just then, I saw Benjamin Kennedy, the prosecutor, rise smoothly to his feet. His voice carried authority as he addressed the court, systematically analyzing the defense's evidence.

"I've carefully examined the evidence presented by the defense," Kennedy began, his argument precise and measured. "Firstly, while Mr. Harrington's personal accounts appear legitimate, this doesn't preclude the possibility that he channeled funds through family members or third parties. We cannot definitively rule out his involvement based solely on his personal accounts."

His penetrating gaze swept across the courtroom as he continued, "Secondly, while the evidence against Grayson and Samuel certainly implicates them - as they've admitted - their testimony today serves as valid evidence precisely because of their involvement."

Kennedy's voice grew more assured: "Thirdly, regarding the audio recording we just heard, whether or not the voice belongs to Grayson is almost irrelevant. In today's technological landscape, voice imitation is readily achievable. Even if it is Grayson's voice, we must consider the possibility that he was coerced into making this recording."

He concluded with authority: "Based on these points, I move that none of the defense's evidence should be admitted as conclusive proof of Mr. Harrington's innocence."

From my position in the gallery, I had to acknowledge the effectiveness of Kennedy's methodical dismantling of the defense's case. The tension in the courtroom was palpable as his words sank in, and I could feel the atmosphere growing heavier with each passing moment.

My fists unconsciously tightened. I had anticipated this - Benjamin Kennedy wouldn't just act as a regular prosecutor in this case. He could have recused himself but chose not to, which meant he must have reached some agreement with the Thorne family.

Quinn noticed my tension and whispered in my ear, "Stay calm. The evidence Lucas provided isn't sufficient to prove his innocence yet. Kennedy is just doing his job by raising these questions. From my professional perspective, I would have raised similar concerns. He's not showing favoritism."

I bit my lip as she continued, "Besides, if Lucas is truly innocent, it's better to clear all suspicions in court to avoid future complications."

I nodded silently. I knew Quinn was right - my current irrationality stemmed purely from seeing Lucas at a disadvantage. And I honestly didn't know if I could accept an... unfavorable verdict.

All the emotions I'd been suppressing began to crumble at that moment. To be precise, my internal defenses had been slowly disappearing since the moment I learned about his detention. The strength, calmness, and composure I'd been showing were just a facade. During this period, Lucas consumed most of my thoughts - I just wanted him to be free. After this, we could start anew. I wanted to make up for my past debts to him, for all those times I pushed him away selfishly, thinking only of my own interests.

After a period of silence in the courtroom, just as the judge was about to speak, Dylan suddenly spoke up. Earlier, he had appeared speechless after Benjamin Kennedy's questioning, somewhat embarrassed. But now he suddenly seemed energized as he said, "I would like to address the prosecutor's concerns. Regarding the claim that my client's account statements alone are insufficient to prove that the unexplained income didn't end up in my client's possession, I now have a detailed report showing the complete flow of funds."

Dylan produced another document. I noticed everyone's surprised expressions. This meant that the shadowy figures trying to frame Lucas were real, and they had identified who they were!

"Beyond the profits in Grayson and Samuel's accounts, the remaining money was divided into twenty accounts, distributed among various individuals and companies. Here is a complete list for the court, Your Honor, and the prosecution to review," Dylan respectfully submitted the document.

The judge spoke sternly, "According to the Federal Rules of Evidence, we need to consider whether to accept new evidence that wasn't submitted to the court in advance. Does the prosecution have any objections?"
###chapter 272
Serena's POV

Benjamin Kennedy immediately stood up, "Your Honor, we object to the admission of this new evidence. According to Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, all evidence should be disclosed before trial unless the defense can prove just cause for the delay."

I watched the jury members diligently taking notes. In American courts, the final verdict rests with the jury, while the judge's role is to ensure the trial proceeds fairly and legally.

Dylan quickly responded, "Your Honor, we only obtained this crucial information last night. Given its significance to the case, I request the court's permission to submit it, and we're willing to give the prosecution ample time for review."

Suddenly, someone from the gallery called out, "Why not accept reasonable evidence? This is about someone's life!"

"Order!" The judge struck his gavel. "The gallery will maintain silence, or you will be removed from the courtroom." I watched as the court officers moved toward the person who had spoken.

Kennedy addressed the court: "Your Honor, I request that you allow the defense to present their evidence. As the prosecutor, I have a responsibility to ensure the truth comes to light. I ask that we continue with this trial."

Though his tone was outwardly respectful, I could detect an underlying assertiveness. It wasn't surprising, given that everyone knew the Kennedy family's significant influence in Massachusetts politics. Their connections reached the highest levels of government, making them a force that even judges had to consider carefully.

I noticed the judge's hesitation after Kennedy's request. I understood why-the Thorne family had specifically intervened earlier, insisting that if the verdict seemed to be turning against Lucas Harrington, the trial should be suspended for later deliberation. Now, the judge was clearly weighing the implications of disappointing either family. Moreover, with the Kennedy and Thorne families currently aligned, and Benjamin Kennedy himself requesting to continue, the judge could deflect any future criticism from the Thornes onto Kennedy.

As expected, the judge spoke: "Given the importance of this evidence, I suggest a fifteen-minute recess. During this time, the prosecution may conduct a preliminary review of this evidence. Afterward, we will decide whether to admit this new evidence. The jury will please exit the courtroom."

Hearing this decision, I couldn't help but feel relieved. Honestly, I hadn't expected Benjamin Kennedy to make such a request-he was clearly helping Lucas. Could it be that he truly valued justice over maintaining good relations with the Thornes?

I glanced back at Quinn Ashford. As an attorney, she had a deeper understanding of every move made in court. She gave me a reassuring look, seeming to confirm that Benjamin Kennedy was indeed being impartial and just.

When the trial resumed fifteen minutes later, I watched as Dylan handed the evidence back to the bench, the judge, and Benjamin Kennedy. Everyone in the courtroom studied the documents intently. I could see clear transaction records with detailed timestamps and transfer amounts, all following a logical sequence.

Benjamin Kennedy finished his review quickly and challenged: "Defense counsel, how can you prove these accounts have no connection to Lucas Harrington?"

I had to admit, Benjamin Kennedy always managed to cut straight to the heart of the matter.

"Because..." Dylan paused deliberately, holding another document, "these accounts all belong to the Thorne Group."

The courtroom erupted in shocked murmurs before falling into dead silence. I was as stunned as everyone else. What started as accusations against Lucas Harrington had suddenly implicated the Thorne Group. This twist was absolutely incredible.

"What evidence supports this claim?" I noticed Benjamin Kennedy maintained his composure.

Dylan proceeded to submit the additional evidence. My heart was racing. While I had always known Lucas was innocent, I never imagined the Thornes were behind it all.

Suddenly, I remembered Lucas's confident smile when I visited him, saying the Thornes couldn't touch him. Now I understood-had he been gathering evidence of their crimes during his time working with them? And I had doubted him all this time!

Watching Benjamin Kennedy, my biggest concern now was whether he would allow the trial to continue, given the Thornes' involvement. Previously, the case hadn't directly threatened the Thornes' interests, but now everything had changed. I noticed the judge repeatedly glancing at Benjamin Kennedy, seemingly waiting for his cue on whether to proceed.

The silence stretched for at least five minutes. Finally, Benjamin Kennedy appeared to complete his review of the evidence and addressed Dylan: "The defense's evidence suggests these accounts are linked to the Thorne Group. However, based on all the evidence we've gathered, the Thorne Group has never been involved in Lucas Harrington's case. This sudden shift in focus requires further examination."

Though he hadn't fully accepted the defense's evidence, I noticed Benjamin Kennedy showed no intention of halting the trial. This gave me some relief. Perhaps there was still hope for justice to prevail, regardless of the powerful families involved.

"There was another person's voice in the recording I just played for everyone," Dylan reminded. The tension in the courtroom was palpable.

"Regardless of whose voice that is, the recording itself is highly controversial and inadmissible as evidence in court." Benjamin Kennedy, the opposing counsel, immediately rose to object. His aggressive demeanor lived up to his reputation as one of the city's top litigators. The sharp lines of his tailored suit seemed to mirror his cutting words.

Dylan appeared unfazed, as if he had anticipated this challenge. "Your Honor, with your permission, I'd like to first establish the authenticity of this recording."

The judge turned to Kennedy, who gave a curt nod. Dylan proceeded to play a video clip. When the footage appeared on the courtroom screens, I, along with everyone else present, drew in a sharp breath. Though brief, the video was crystal clear, completely unobstructed, and most crucially, the audio perfectly matched the intimate conversation from the previous recording.

Kennedy remained relentless in his objection. "This still fails to provide sufficient proof. The audio could have been recreated after obtaining this video. It doesn't conclusively establish the recording's authenticity." I had to admire his quick thinking - he had indeed identified a critical weakness in the evidence.

Dylan turned to address the witness stand. "Mr. Burton, according to the records I've reviewed, you claim you were systematically ruined by my client in December 2020. Why have you waited until today to come forward and accuse them of wrongdoing?"

Arthur Burton took a deep breath, his shoulders squaring as if gathering courage. "I was under duress at the time. My son had earned a full merit scholarship to Harvard that year entirely on his own merit. He's always been independent, working his way up through sheer determination. Lucas Harrington threatened that if I spoke out against him, he would use his connections to have my son's scholarship revoked. Even though my son offered to take out student loans to continue his education, as a father, I couldn't bear the thought of him shouldering such a massive debt."

"What changed? Why are you willing to testify now?" Dylan pressed.

"Last month, my son voluntarily took a leave of absence from university. He decided to work and save money before continuing his education - it was entirely his choice. Now Harrington no longer has that leverage over me. When I think about how he deceived me, and how many others are still silent because he has leverage over them, I knew I had to speak up. This isn't just about seeking justice for myself; it's about preventing him from harming more people."

"Do you have any evidence of Mr. Harrington's threats?" Dylan asked. Burton's expression showed confidence.
###chapter 273
Serena's POV

"Listen to this voice message he sent me." Burton pulled out his phone, holding it like a trump card. I noticed his hands trembling slightly, likely from a mix of nervousness and anticipation.

Dylan took the phone and played the message. As the audio filled the courtroom, I furrowed my brow - while the content matched Burton's testimony exactly, something about the voice seemed off.

Dylan quickly highlighted this discrepancy: "I believe everyone has noticed an obvious issue with this voice message. The voice speaking to Mr. Burton has been altered by AI technology and sounds nothing like my client."

Burton immediately jumped up, his face flushed. "Of course it's been altered! Someone as careful as Harrington wouldn't leave such obvious evidence!"

As I listened, I couldn't help but think: this actually exposed a massive flaw in their case. Sometimes clever people can outsmart themselves, and whoever was behind this clearly thought using voice alteration would be above suspicion.

While I was pondering this, Dylan calmly announced, "I've had technical experts restore the original voice from this recording."

I held my breath as he played the audio again. When the restored voice emerged, my heart skipped a beat - it was an exact match to Grayson's voice from the earlier recording!

I glanced around the courtroom as murmurs of shock rippled through the gallery. The bailiffs had to signal for quiet to maintain order. The implications were staggering - this piece of evidence had just completely changed the direction of the case.

The judge leaned forward, his expression grave. "Counselor, are you prepared to authenticate this voice analysis?"

"Yes, Your Honor," Dylan responded, producing a thick folder. "I have here a detailed forensic audio analysis report prepared by Dr. Smith of the Central Forensics Laboratory. The report includes both spectrographic analysis and AI detection markers that conclusively prove the original voice belongs to Mr. Chen."

I watched as Benjamin Kennedy's typically composed demeanor showed the first crack of concern. He quickly rose to his feet. "Your Honor, we request time to have our own experts examine this evidence."
."
"Nobody is more surprised than me," Burton interjected, his voice shaking. "I received that message through an encrypted app. The sender's identity showed as Mr. Harrington's private number

Dylan seized on this detail. "Mr. Burton, did you ever have direct communication with Mr. Harrington before receiving this message?"

"No... all previous communications were through his assistant or legal team."

"So you had no way to verify if the number actually belonged to Mr. Harrington?"

Burton's face paled as the implications of his testimony began to sink in. I could see the precise moment when he realized he might have been manipulated into becoming a pawn in someone else's game.

The judge's gavel cracked through the tense atmosphere. "We'll take a thirty-minute recess. When we resume, I expect both counsels to be prepared to address the authenticity of all evidence presented thus far."

When court resumed, I noticed that Prosecutor Benjamin Kennedy raised no objections to the audio evidence, allowing me to breathe a small sigh of relief. 

The courtroom was eerily silent, with everyone holding their breath, afraid to miss even the smallest detail. The afternoon sun filtered through the tall windows, casting long shadows across the polished floor. I forced myself to remain still, though every fiber of my being wanted to jump up and scream out the truth.

Dylan stood with quiet confidence, his voice steady and clear as it carried through the hushed chamber. "Based on the evidence presented, we can reasonably reconstruct the truth," he began, adjusting his tie. "Grayson, behind my client's back and exploiting their reputation, engaged in illegal activities. The person threatening Grayson was none other than Garrett Thorne, the eldest son of the Thorne family."

I watched as Prosecutor Benjamin Kennedy immediately rose to his feet, his expression stern. "Your Honor, while the defense has provided substantial evidence that appears logically sound for case analysis, numerous questions remain unanswered." He paused, scanning the courtroom before continuing. "This does not conclusively prove Lucas Harrington's innocence. Everything could still be an elaborate performance orchestrated by Harrington himself. Furthermore, the defense has yet to provide concrete evidence linking these crimes to the Thorne family. These are merely speculations."

Dylan remained unruffled by the challenge. His calm demeanor reminded me of Lucas, and the thought sent a fresh wave of worry through me. "Your Honor," Dylan responded, "I'm about to present several pieces of evidence that, while not directly related to the case, serve as crucial circumstantial evidence for our logical inference."

After receiving the judge's permission, I watched intently as Dylan played two video clips that made my blood run cold.

The first video showed Rachel Thorne speaking to Nina in what appeared to be a private office. The crystal clarity of the footage made Rachel's cold expression even more chilling as she said, "Tonight's target is this person. Study his preferences and make sure to accommodate them." When Nina showed reluctance, Rachel's voice turned threatening: "Nina, don't forget who gave you your current success. You're in no position to negotiate terms with me."

The second video was even more shocking. It showed Garrett and Rachel Thorne in what they thought was a private conversation, discussing how to use these videos as leverage. I felt sick to my stomach as I heard Garrett's words: "Respectable people aren't useful for blackmail. We need people with peculiar tastes who maintain a facade of propriety. Those are the ones who fear public exposure the most."

The courtroom erupted in hushed whispers when the videos ended. I could hear the shock and disgust in the murmurs around me. An elderly woman behind me whispered to her companion, "How could they do such terrible things?" while a young law student furiously scribbled notes, his face pale with disbelief.

I glanced at Lucas, sitting stoically at the defense table. His broad shoulders were tense, but his expression remained impassive. I wished I could reach out and tell him everything would be okay, but the truth was, I wasn't sure myself. The stakes were impossibly high.

Dylan's voice cut through the murmurs: "While these videos may seem tangential to the current case, they demonstrate a crucial pattern. The Thorne family has consistently used people's dark secrets as leverage, turning blackmail into an art form. This isn't an isolated incident - it's their modus operandi."

I noticed that this time, Prosecutor Benjamin Kennedy remained seated, his expression thoughtful. The shift in his demeanor gave me a glimmer of hope. When Dylan announced he had one final piece of evidence to present, I felt my heart skip a beat. "And now," he declared, his voice ringing with conviction, "I will present the final, decisive evidence that will clear my client's name!"
###chapter 274
Serena's POV

I held my breath, joining everyone else in the courtroom as we watched Dylan prepare to play the third video. This piece of evidence would prove crucial to today's proceedings. The tension in the room was palpable - I could feel the weight of anticipation pressing down on my shoulders, making the already stiff wooden bench seem even more uncomfortable.

The video showed Garrett Thorne alone, talking on his phone. I listened intently to every word, my heart pounding so loudly I worried it might interfere with the audio: "I've heard rumors about an anonymous tip concerning Lucas Harrington's illegal business activities. I haven't traced the source yet, but it will definitely lead back to you. Listen carefully to what I'm about to say, and make sure you relay this to Samuel as well."

I watched as he continued, his expression calculated and cold: "When the time comes, you and Samuel should plead guilty immediately and insist that Lucas Harrington was the mastermind behind everything. We have enough evidence prepared to make it appear as if he orchestrated it all. He won't be able to defend himself. I've already arranged everything with the relevant parties in the court. Just follow my lead and don't slip up."

Then came the threatening promise, each word making my stomach turn: "Don't worry about the sentence, whether it's five or ten years. I can arrange for your early release. Once you're out, you'll be well compensated. Your families will be taken care of - I'll make sure they're looked after properly."

The final warning made my blood run cold: "One last reminder - you must never mention me or any member of my family. If you're unsure about how to answer any questions, just stay silent. After this is over, you'll be well rewarded for your cooperation."

The high-definition video was so clear that I could make out the phone number displayed on Garrett's screen - it belonged to Grayson, though it wasn't saved under any name, just a string of numbers. I noticed Lucas's lawyer, Dylan, watching the jury's reactions carefully as they viewed this damning evidence.

After presenting this powerful piece of evidence, Dylan wasn't finished. He produced several more recordings obtained through digital forensics - conversations between Grayson and other parties that perfectly aligned with Garrett's instructions, further proving their collusion.

My gaze never left Lucas throughout the proceedings. He maintained an impressive composure, his expression unchanged whether the evidence seemed to favor or condemn him. His calm demeanor in the face of such serious accusations was remarkable, though I could see the slight tension in his jawline that others might miss.

Suddenly, Benjamin Kennedy spoke up: "Your Honor, may I ask the defendant a few questions?"

After receiving the judge's permission, Kennedy approached Lucas. I noticed Dylan taking a small step back, his confidence in his client evident in this simple gesture.

"Mr. Harrington, there are several aspects of this case that require clarification," Kennedy began, his voice carrying across the hushed courtroom.

"Very well," Lucas replied, his voice deep and steady, his posture remaining impeccable despite the hours we'd spent in court.

When Kennedy posed his question, I felt my heart constrict: "Regarding this case, between 2018 and 2021, did you ever discover what Grayson and Samuel were doing behind your back? Or perhaps you knew and tacitly approved of their actions, given your close relationship with the Thorne family?"

I immediately recognized the trap - if Lucas admitted to knowing anything, he could be charged with complicity! But strangely, Dylan made no move to object to this clearly leading question. He remained calm, standing to the side. I understood why - in his twenty years of legal practice, he had never encountered a client with such detailed evidence and precise thinking as Lucas. Dylan knew Lucas wouldn't fall for any manipulation.



Lucas's POV

Facing Benjamin Kennedy's pointed questioning, I responded calmly, "I didn't know." After a brief pause, I added, "To be precise, I began to notice something about a month before my return to Manhattan, but by then, it was clear they were already starting to wind down their operations. The number of potential victims was decreasing."

Benjamin Kennedy immediately pressed further: "From what I understand, you returned at the beginning of this year. Why didn't you report this immediately? Were you covering for the Thornes because of your connection to them?"

I explained with measured composure: "No, that's not the case. At that time, I had no idea the Thornes were involved, and I received no benefits from this situation. I had no reason to cover anything up. However, since this directly affected my interests and reputation, I certainly couldn't remain passive. Based on what I knew about my subordinates, Grayson and Samuel, they neither had the courage nor the capability to orchestrate such an elaborate scheme and maintain silence after defrauding so many people. The only logical explanation was that a powerful entity was protecting them."

I noticed Benjamin Kennedy nodding, apparently accepting my reasoning. He didn't seem to think I was trying to distance myself artificially. I continued, "Therefore, I began a discreet investigation to avoid alerting anyone. Mr. Kennedy, you must understand that even the slightest hint of investigation would have allowed certain powerful figures to quickly obscure the truth. To avoid becoming a scapegoat, I had no choice but to keep my investigation secret initially."

"Your approach was sound," Benjamin Kennedy acknowledged.

With a trace of bitterness in my heart, I proceeded: "I began monitoring Grayson and Samuel's activities, observing their every move. I tracked down the list of victims, investigated their accounts, and eventually discovered that all evidence pointed to the Thorne family. Like you, I found it hard to believe. My connection with the Thornes runs deep - beyond my relationship with Rachel Thorne, my grandfather and Clarence Thorne were lifelong friends and veterans. I didn't want to believe they would not only employ illegal methods but also arrange for me to take the fall as their scapegoat."

Reflecting on this, I continued with disappointment evident in my voice: "Before all this, I truly believed the Thornes valued me, that our families' relationship would span generations."

"After discovering the Thorne connection, I became even more cautious in my investigation, careful not to arouse their suspicion. It took me over three months to truly gain their trust, allowing me to remain in Portland and assist with the Thorne Group's operations. This position gave me better access to investigate questionable transactions and install surveillance. However, due to their persistent wariness, I could only successfully monitor Garrett and Rachel Thorne. As for Clarence Thorne, the family patriarch, I admit my limitations in gathering evidence against him."

"Working within one's capabilities is the wisest strategy," Benjamin Kennedy affirmed.

"Yes," I nodded in agreement. "Fortunately, the evidence gathered from monitoring Rachel and Garrett Thorne helped uncover the entire case. The first recording that Attorney Yang presented - the conversation between Grayson and Garrett Thorne - was discovered by a cybersecurity expert who accessed Grayson's phone. This led us to focus on Garrett Thorne as a key target. We then identified my virtual IP messaging account, located the victim list, traced bank account notifications, and ultimately used my connection to the Thornes to obtain all the necessary video evidence."

Standing firmly in court, I declared: "I am the anonymous whistleblower in this case."

My statement caused an immediate stir in the courtroom. I heard surprised murmurs until the judge called out, "Order in the court!"

Benjamin Kennedy looked at me intently: "You're the anonymous whistleblower?"

"Yes, after gathering all the evidence, I reported it to the Attorney General's office."

"Why report yourself when you had clear evidence of your innocence?"

I explained: "Because only by reporting myself could I ensure they would lower their guard and allow the truth to surface. I feared that if I simply submitted my evidence, it would be buried. This was the only way - a public approach - to protect myself while ensuring the real perpetrators would face justice."

As I finished speaking, spontaneous applause erupted throughout the courtroom. Listening to the sustained applause, I knew that justice would finally prevail.
###chapter 275
Serena's POV

The entire courtroom erupted in applause. Enthusiastic, thunderous applause. It was a recognition of Lucas's brilliance.

I couldn't help but marvel at the audacity of the Thorne family. Operating so brazenly behind the scenes-it spoke volumes about their influence. If Lucas had simply handed over the evidence directly, he wouldn't have achieved his desired outcome. Worse, the Thorne family might have found ways to silence him permanently. By making himself the target, he had successfully outmaneuvered them.

I found myself once again in awe of Lucas's foresight.

"This was undoubtedly the most effective approach you could have taken," Kennedy said deliberately, instantly bringing the atmosphere back to a razor's edge. "But Mr. Harrington, are you aware that your independent investigation violates numerous legal statutes? Many of these violations carry serious penalties under federal law."

I watched as all eyes focused on him.

Kennedy continued, "Unauthorized surveillance of private devices, public disclosure of confidential information... all of these actions could subject you to legal consequences."

"Objection," Dylan Anderson, Lucas's attorney, interjected. "My client's actions were taken solely to protect his life and safety. Everything he did constitutes legitimate self-defense and cannot be grounds for legal penalties."

Kennedy didn't belabor his point. "I'm merely offering my perspective on this incident. Whether these actions constitute criminal behavior is for the judge and jury to decide. I have no further questions."

"Would the prosecution's attorney please return to his seat. Does the defense wish to make any additional statements?" the judge asked.

"Yes, Your Honor," Dylan nodded.

"Proceed."

I watched as Dylan approached Grayson Chen and Samuel Hunt. The physical evidence was now incontrovertible, but witness testimony hadn't yet been fully established.

"Mr. Chen, Mr. Hunt," Dylan began, "you've seen all the evidence provided by my client. The criminal activities between you and Garrett Thorne are beyond dispute. Now, standing before this federal court, I urge you to be forthcoming. If you demonstrate genuine remorse and cooperation, the court may consider leniency in your sentencing."

I noticed that Chen and Hunt had gone deathly pale. They clearly recognized the futility of maintaining their lies.

Dylan's threatening tone went unchallenged by the prosecution.

He asked gravely, "Did you use my client's identity to conduct illegal market manipulation and assist criminal organizations in laundering money?"

"Yes," both men admitted.

"Is your conduct consistent with the evidence my client has presented?"

"Yes."

"Was Garrett Thorne your collaborator and the mastermind behind these operations?"

"Yes."

I saw that they no longer dared to conceal anything.

"Very well," Dylan turned to face the judge. "Based on the evidence we've presented and the suspects' own confessions, my client has committed no criminal acts. We request that the court issue a verdict of not guilty. The defense rests."

"Defense counsel may return to his seat."

Dylan sat down.

The judge stood up. "Court will recess for thirty minutes while the jury deliberates to reach a final verdict."

With that announcement, the judge and jury departed. The courtroom erupted in murmurs and conversation.

My tense heart finally began to relax. Regardless of whether Lucas had crossed legal boundaries during his investigation, any potential infractions were relatively minor. Even if convicted, the sentence wouldn't be severe.

As long as Lucas didn't face execution or life imprisonment, I felt I could accept almost any outcome.

"I knew Lucas couldn't have done anything illegal," Spencer said, unable to contain himself. "Damn, he nearly gave me a heart attack! I knew he was brilliant, but today's performance was exceptional-he completely surpassed my expectations!"

From beginning to end, the dramatic revelations and stunning truth had been breathtaking. I silently agreed.

"Lucas really is incredible," Drew acknowledged, then joked at his own expense, "If I had even a third of his talent, my parents would be over the moon. They'd probably throw a parade down Main Street."

"That's debatable," Spencer quipped. "If Lucas weren't so exceptional, would he attract so much trouble? Would so many people be targeting him? So being too accomplished isn't necessarily a good thing. People like us-born at our peak and contentedly mediocre-that's the true path to happiness."

"I give that speech a perfect score," Drew said with a thumbs up.

I noticed Maeve listening quietly beside them, laughing softly, appearing sweet and well-mannered.

"So one should live with openness and clarity, without excessive demands, learning to let go," Spencer continued casually. "That's how to find true happiness in life!"

"Yes, we should certainly learn to let things go," Drew agreed wistfully.

"Once Lucas is acquitted, we should celebrate tonight-drinks, music, the works," Spencer couldn't stay serious for more than a second.

Before Drew could respond-

"Absolutely not," I interrupted. "Lucas's health is too fragile right now. He needs to go home and recover properly. No alcohol."

Both men turned to stare at me simultaneously, making me blush.

I hadn't said anything wrong.

"We understand completely," Spencer said with a knowing smile. "Absence makes the heart grow fonder. We wouldn't dream of interrupting your reunion!"

Spencer and Drew both broke into mischievous grins. I could only lower my head, ignoring their teasing.

"When Lucas is fully recovered, he can have whatever he wants," Serena said casually, trying to deflect.

"Oh sure, once you've taken care of all his needs, he can have anything," Spencer replied with a suggestive smirk.

Serena was speechless. She realized she couldn't say anything without it being twisted.

"But seriously," Spencer continued, changing the subject, "Lucas sacrificed his entire family business just to take down the Thornes. Don't you think that's a bit excessive? Harrington International has been built over generations. How could he give it all up so easily? Doesn't he have any regrets?"

"Howard must be devastated," Drew added with a sigh.

I sat silently beside them, unable to respond.

Everything Lucas had done was, in one way or another, connected to me.

"Enough. We're in a courtroom. Keep it down," Quinn snapped, sensing my discomfort.
###chapter 276
Serena's POV

She turned to Spencer and Drew with an irritated expression. "Show some respect."

Spencer shot Quinn a sideways glance. "We're in recess. You're not even the attorney on this case. Why should I listen to you?"

"Could you at least try to be civilized?" Quinn replied, barely containing her frustration.

"How am I being uncivilized? Am I shouting? Someone was physically removed from court earlier-was that me?" Spencer's temper was clearly rising.

The tension between them was palpable. No one would guess they were husband and wife rather than sworn enemies.

Quinn's face darkened noticeably.

Drew tugged at Spencer's sleeve. "Come on, she's right. Let's keep it down. This is still a courtroom. We should maintain some decorum."

Spencer stood up abruptly. "I'm leaving."

"Where are you going? The verdict hasn't even been announced yet," Drew called after him.

"To smoke," Spencer threw back over his shoulder, then added under his breath, "before I'm tempted to hit someone."

An awkward silence fell over the group after Spencer's departure.

Maeve couldn't help but lean toward Drew. "Aren't Spencer and Quinn married?" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Drew whispered back, "Their relationship is complicated. Think of it as a marriage of convenience without any real affection. But don't take Spencer's attitude toward Quinn at face value. He's just... trying to get attention."

Maeve looked surprised.

"Just keep that to yourself. Spencer has his pride. Don't call him out on it," Drew cautioned.

"Understood," Maeve nodded obediently.

I caught a glimpse of their intimate exchange and felt a twinge of discomfort. But then I reminded myself that Eleanor had been the one to end things with Drew, so it was only natural for him to move on with his life and find happiness elsewhere.

Still, I couldn't help wondering-where had Eleanor gone? What had really happened to her?

The bailiff entered the courtroom first.

"All rise!" he called out. "The Honorable Judge Wilson presiding."

The judge entered and took his seat at the bench.

"You may be seated," he said, and everyone in the courtroom sat down.

The judge spoke again. "In the case of The State versus Lucas Harrington, I understand the jury has reached a verdict."

The clerk addressed the jury. "Has the jury reached a verdict?"

The jury foreperson, a middle-aged woman in a navy blazer, stood. "We have, Your Honor."

The clerk continued, "Will the defendant and counsel please rise."

Lucas stood alongside his attorney, his face impassive. I watched him from my seat in the gallery, my heart pounding. Even though all signs pointed to a favorable outcome, I couldn't shake the anxiety gripping me.

The jury foreperson handed a slip of paper to the bailiff, who delivered it to the judge. Judge Wilson reviewed it briefly before handing it back to the clerk to read aloud.

I held my breath, my eyes not on the judge but on Lucas, who was looking directly at me. His gaze calmed me.

The clerk asked, "What say you?"

The foreperson held a piece of paper and read firmly: "On Count One, securities fraud, we the jury find the defendant, Lucas Harrington, not guilty. On Count Two, money laundering, we the jury find the defendant, Lucas Harrington, not guilty."

With each "not guilty," I felt a wave of relief wash over me.

The judge nodded. "The verdict is accepted and recorded. Mr. Harrington, you are free to go. This court is adjourned." He struck his gavel once.

As the words hung in the air, enthusiastic applause broke out across the courtroom.

It was genuine celebration, satisfaction at a just outcome.

I exhaled deeply, a profound sense of relief washing over me.

I realized then that my feelings for Lucas ran much deeper than I had been willing to admit to myself. In truth, he had already claimed my heart completely-I had simply been running from this reality.

After this ordeal, I would never push him away again.

"Court adjourned!"

The judges exited first, followed by the rest of the assembly filing out gradually.

Our group left through a separate exit. Outside, reporters swarmed but were kept at bay beyond the courthouse barriers.

I stood in a corridor, waiting for Lucas.

As I waited, my mind raced through everything that had led us to this moment. The lies, the betrayals, the revelations... and throughout it all, Lucas had remained steadfast. He had sacrificed everything-his company, his reputation, his family legacy-all to protect me and bring down those who had threatened us.

By all accounts, he should have emerged by now. Why wasn't he out yet?

Each second felt like an eternity of torment. My heart raced with anticipation, and I couldn't help but shift my weight from one foot to the other, trying to appear casual while feeling anything but.

Spencer couldn't resist teasing me from beside me. "You'll give yourself whiplash if you keep looking back and forth like that."

He was mocking my constant peering down the hallway. I felt a slight flush of embarrassment color my cheeks, but I didn't look away. I just wanted to see him as soon as possible-to confirm with my own eyes that he was okay.

After what felt like hours but was probably just a few more minutes, movement at the end of the corridor caught my attention. My heart leaped, and I unconsciously stepped forward, eyes straining to make out the approaching figure.

Someone emerged, and I tensed with anticipation. My breath caught, only to release in a disappointed sigh when I recognized Kennedy instead of Lucas.

Kennedy walked past us, his stride purposeful and confident. As he passed, he gave me a fleeting glance-so brief that no one else would have noticed it. 

I returned to my vigil, more tense than before.

"He'll be out soon," Spencer reassured me, though his own patience seemed to be wearing thin.

"What if something's wrong?" I finally voiced my fear. "What if he's not feeling well? You know he pushes himself too hard."

"Serena, If there were a problem, we'd know. Take a breath, okay?"

I nodded and tried to follow his advice, drawing in a deep breath and letting it out slowly. But my composure lasted only seconds before I was back to peering down the hallway.

Finally-finally-Lucas appeared, walking alongside Dylan. Relief flooded through me with such intensity that I felt momentarily lightheaded. Just seeing him, tall and composed as ever, his dark suit immaculate, his presence commanding even from a distance, made all the anxiety of waiting worthwhile.

"Lucas!" Spencer called out enthusiastically, waving. "Over here!"

Compared to Spencer's excitement, Lucas appeared much more reserved. He walked toward us with that measured pace I'd come to know so well-never rushing, never appearing too eager, always in control. But as he approached, his eyes sought me out, and the intensity in them sent a flutter through my chest.

I stared back at him, drinking in the sight. Now that we were finally face to face, all the things I'd planned to say seemed to evaporate from my mind. The connection between us filled the space where words should have been, speaking volumes in silence.

"You two are going to make the air sizzle with those looks," Spencer joked, breaking the moment. "Alright, alright, we won't intrude on your couple time. We'll head out. Come on, Drew."

Drew, always perceptive, nodded. "Lucas, we should catch up properly sometime soon."

"Yes," Lucas replied simply, his deep voice sending a familiar comfort through me.

"Brother," Maeve said, her voice tentative and soft as she addressed him. "Grandfather has gone abroad now. Mother and I are still at the house. If you have time, perhaps you could bring Serena over. Mother keeps talking about you, she's very concerned. She would have been here today, but she had to deal with some urgent business matters."

"Hmm," Lucas responded with a slight nod, the noncommittal sound revealing his emotional distance from his sister.

Though Lucas had always been somewhat cool toward Eleanor, I had always sensed that he cared for her in his own way. With Maeve, however, there seemed to be a genuine disconnection-as if she were merely a peripheral figure in his life rather than family.

Maeve didn't press further, sensing his indifference. She simply nodded and departed with Drew and the others.

Quinn also bid me a brief farewell before following them out.

Dylan quickly found an excuse to leave as well. "I'll wait by the car, sir."

It was just Lucas and me standing in the quiet corridor.

###chapter 277
Quinn's POV

I stepped out of the courthouse, clutching my leather briefcase like a shield. The spring air should have felt refreshing after hours in that stuffy courtroom, but I couldn't enjoy it. Not when I spotted the cluster of reporters waiting at the bottom of the steps like vultures.

My heart sank. I'd hoped to slip away unnoticed, but clearly that wasn't going to happen. Their heads turned in unison as they spotted me, and they surged forward, microphones extended like weapons.

"Ms. Ashford! Quinn Ashford!" they called out, voices overlapping.

I straightened my shoulders and lifted my chin, slipping on the cool, professional mask.

A particularly aggressive reporter with bleached blonde hair pushed to the front, shoving her microphone toward my face.

"Ms. Ashford, you were present for the entire Lucas Harrington case hearing. From your legal perspective, can you provide some analysis on today's proceedings?"

I stopped, knowing from experience that sometimes the quickest way through was to give them something-just enough to satisfy without revealing anything of substance.

"The judge's ruling speaks for itself," I replied, my voice steady and professional. "The final judgment is the authoritative answer to this case. There's really nothing more to analyze or explain. The judge's word is definitive."

I tried to move past them, but they closed ranks, blocking my path to the parking lot. The blonde reporter persisted, her expression shifting to something more predatory. My stomach tightened with dread.

"Ms. Ashford, it's been reported that Spencer Sherwood is frequently seen at nightclubs and has been photographed numerous times with various women. How do you feel about your husband's... recreational activities?"

The question hit me like a slap. My pulse quickened, but I forced my expression to remain neutral. The sting of her words burrowed beneath my skin.

"Everyone has their preferred lifestyle," I said, the words tasting bitter on my tongue. "If Spencer enjoys going out, that's his choice. As long as he's happy." My voice nearly cracked on the last word, but I held it together.

I had been asking myself the same questions for months. Was I really okay with it? Could I continue living like this? 

The reporter's eyes gleamed, sensing weakness. "You truly don't mind? You are married, after all. Don't you find his behavior... distasteful?"

I felt heat rising in my cheeks. The shame and anger I'd been suppressing threatened to break through my carefully maintained facade. These vultures didn't care about me or my marriage-they just wanted a headline.

"That's between my husband and me," I said, my voice sharper now. "I don't need to report our private matters to you."

"Are you avoiding the question, Ms. Ashford?" the reporter pressed, her smile widening. "Is it because you can't control Spencer Sherwood? Why haven't you considered divorce? Is it the Sherwood family fortune that's keeping you in this marriage?"

The accusation pierced deep, striking at my greatest insecurity. My hands trembled slightly, and I gripped my briefcase tighter to steady them. All those nights I'd lain awake, wondering if people saw me as nothing more than a gold-digger. I'd worked so hard to build my reputation as a competent attorney, and here they were, reducing me to a stereotype.

"Do you realize you're engaging in malicious defamation?" I managed, my legal training kicking in despite my emotional turmoil. "I can and will use legal means to protect my rights if you continue."

The reporter opened her mouth to fire back, but her words were cut off by a furious roar.

"Are you trying to get yourself killed? Harassing my wife?"

Spencer's voice cut through the crowd like a thunderclap. The circle of reporters parted as he stormed through, his face contorted with rage. Six feet of barely contained fury, his tailored suit couldn't disguise the tension coiled in his muscles.

My heart lurched at the sight of him. I hadn't expected him here. We hadn't spoken in days, not since our last fight.

Before I could process what was happening, Spencer grabbed the blonde reporter by her collar, sending her microphone clattering to the ground.

"My relationship with Quinn is none of your business," he snarled, his face inches from hers. "If you ever dare to smear her name again, I will end you."

The reporter's face paled, her earlier bravado vanishing. Security guards from the courthouse were already moving toward us, attracted by the commotion.

Spencer released her with a shove and turned to address the entire press corps, his voice carrying across the courthouse steps.

"For future reference, if you want to ask about my nightlife or take your pathetic photos, come to me. Anyone who harasses Quinn will regret it for the rest of their miserable career. That's a promise."

He grabbed my arm before I could protest, his grip firm but not painful. "Let's go."

"I have my own car," I objected, trying to pull away.

His eyes flashed dangerously. "Shut up," he hissed, low enough that only I could hear.

The raw command in his voice silenced me momentarily, allowing him to steer me toward the black sedan waiting at the curb. His driver opened the door, and Spencer practically pushed me inside before circling around to the driver's side.

"What are you doing?" I asked, alarmed as he dismissed the driver with a curt nod and slid behind the wheel himself.

He didn't answer, just jammed the key into the ignition and floored the accelerator. The powerful engine roared to life, and we shot into traffic, leaving the courthouse and the reporters far behind.

My heart hammered against my ribs as Spencer weaved through traffic at an alarming speed. His knuckles were white on the steering wheel, his jaw clenched so tight I could see a muscle twitching.

"Spencer, slow down," I pleaded, gripping the door handle. "You're going to get us killed."

He ignored me, pushing the car faster as we entered the highway. The speedometer crept past eighty, then ninety.

Fear coiled around my throat, strangling my voice. I'd seen Spencer angry before, but this was different. This wasn't just anger-it was something wilder, more desperate.

"Spencer, please," I tried again, my voice barely audible over the engine's roar. "Whatever's wrong, we can talk about it. Just slow down."

"Talk?" he spat, shooting me a scorching glance. "Now you want to talk? After you stood there letting them say those things about you-about us?"

I felt a flash of indignation cut through my fear. "What was I supposed to do? Create an even bigger scene? You're the one who made things worse! You can't just assault reporters, Spencer!"

"Why not?" he demanded, swerving around a slower car. "They deserved it! Saying you're with me for the money-"

"And what about the rest?" I shot back, my voice rising despite myself. "The nightclubs? The other women? They weren't lying about that, were they?"

His face darkened, but he didn't deny it. The silence between us swelled, filled only by the engine's growl and my rapidly accelerating heartbeat as the speedometer pushed past a hundred.

A car ahead of us braked suddenly, and Spencer swerved so sharply I was thrown against the door. Terror seized me, the reality of our mortality suddenly, vividly clear.

"Spencer, that's enough!" I screamed, tears finally breaking free. "Stop the car! You've made your point. Whatever you're angry about, whatever I've done, this isn't the way to handle it. For God's sake, is killing us both really worth making your point?"
###chapter 278
Quinn's POV

I felt my body slam against the passenger door as Spencer's car careened around another bend, the tires shrieking in protest. My fingernails dug crescents into the leather seat as I watched the speedometer climb higher. The skyline had long disappeared in the rearview mirror, replaced by the dark, empty stretch of coastal road.

"Spencer, slow down!" I screamed, but my voice was swallowed by the roar of the engine.

His face remained a stone mask, illuminated by the blue glow of the dashboard. The muscles in his jaw twitched as he pressed the accelerator harder.

Through the windshield, I could see where the road abruptly ended-a concrete barrier, and beyond it, the vast, hungry ocean. My heart hammered against my ribs like a wild animal trying to escape. 

The thought flashed through my mind: *Would anyone find us? Would they pull our bodies from the wreckage, still strapped in our seats? Would they wonder what drove us to such a desperate end?*

I closed my eyes.

The car lurched forward violently, then stopped with such force that my body snapped forward against the seatbelt. The smell of burning rubber filled my lungs. When I opened my eyes, the concrete barrier was mere feet away, the dark water beyond it glistening under the moonlight like an invitation.

My hands trembled uncontrollably as I fumbled with the seatbelt, desperate to escape. The click of the release was the sweetest sound I'd ever heard.

"I'm getting out," I said, reaching for the door handle. Nothing happened. I pulled again, harder this time.

"It's locked," Spencer said, his voice eerily calm. "Child safety locks."

I turned to face him, my fear transforming into rage. "What the hell is wrong with you? Are you trying to kill us both?"

"What's wrong with me?" His laugh was hollow, devoid of any joy. "That's rich coming from you, Quinn."

"Spencer, unlock the door. Now." I tried to keep my voice steady, but it cracked at the edges.

"Why didn't you say anything?" he demanded, slamming his palm against the steering wheel. "Those reporters were tearing you apart, and you just stood there!"

I could still see the flashing cameras, hear the barrage of accusations. "Spencer, what did you want me to do?" I asked, exasperation coloring my voice.

"Fight back! Defend yourself!" His eyes were wild, unrecognizable. "You're a lawyer, for God's sake! You're supposed to be good with words!"

I felt something inside me snap. "And what good would that do? You think they'd believe anything I said? You think they're interested in the truth? All they want is a headline, Spencer. Every word I say is just more ammunition."

The car felt too small suddenly, the air too thick.

"I don't need to waste my time on vultures. If they cross a line, I can handle it legally." My voice rose with each word. "Or at least I could have, until you decided to play the hero and punch that reporter! Now I have to clean up your mess too!"

Spencer's face contorted. "So this is my fault?"

"Yes!" I didn't hesitate. "It is your fault. Before you decided to throw punches, I was the one in the right. I could have stood on moral high ground. Now look at us! Your impulsive, childish behavior has put me on the defensive!"

I watched his expression darken, the hurt in his eyes quickly replaced by anger.

"Why can't you grow up, Spencer? Why can't you be like your brother? Why can't you just be an adult for once in your life?"

The words hung between us, sharp and dangerous. I knew I'd crossed a line by mentioning Marcus, but I was too angry to care.

"Let me out," I said coldly. "I'm done with this conversation."

Spencer's movement was so sudden it startled me. His hand shot out, grabbing my shoulder and pulling me toward him with such force that my neck snapped back. His other hand tangled in my hair, holding me in place.

"Spencer-" My protest was cut short as his mouth crashed against mine.

There was nothing tender in the kiss-only anger, desperation, and pain. His teeth caught my bottom lip, biting down hard enough that I tasted the metallic tang of blood. Tears sprang to my eyes, but I refused to make a sound. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of knowing he'd hurt me, physically or otherwise.

I didn't push him away, but I didn't respond either. I remained perfectly still, like stone beneath his assault.

When he finally pulled back, his breath came in ragged bursts, his chest heaving. A drop of my blood stained his lower lip.

"Does it hurt?" he asked, his voice eerily detached.

I said nothing, tasting copper on my tongue.

"Good," he whispered, his eyes fixed on mine. "Now you know how I feel."
###chapter 279
Quinn's POV

The silence stretched between us, broken only by the distant sound of waves crashing against the shore. My lip throbbed, a physical reminder of the damage we continued to inflict on each other.

Then, without warning, Spencer reached for the buttons of my suit. His fingers trembled as he unfastened them one by one, exposing the lace of my bra. 

"There's more pain coming your way," he growled low in my ear, his breath hot against my skin. Then his teeth sank into my earlobe, sharp and unyielding. 

I didn't flinch. I didn't pull away. What was the point? I knew Spencer too well-his stubbornness, his need to dominate. Fighting him was useless, a waste of energy I didn't have. So I endured, like always. Crazy endurance, that's what it was.

He leaned in, his lips tracing a path down my neck to my collarbone. I stared out the windshield, focusing on the darkness beyond. The car was parked in a secluded spot, the sound of waves a distant murmur, a world away from the chaos inside this confined space.

He slid his hand under my bra, cupping my breast. I felt my nipple harden under his touch, a physical response my mind couldn't control. The cool air hit my skin, making my nipples tighten, but I felt nothing-no thrill, no shame. Just numbness. He didn't care about my silence, my stillness. He never did.

The seat reclined with a jolt, and suddenly he was over me, his weight pinning me down. "Quinn," he said, his voice a harsh rasp, "does it hurt?"

I looked up at him, his face shadowed in the dim light, his eyes burning with something I couldn't name-anger, lust, maybe both. 

"No," I lied, flat and emotionless. "It doesn't hurt." It was true in a way. Physical pain I could handle. It was the rest-the humiliation, the emptiness-that cut deeper. But I was used to him by now, used to the way he took what he wanted. If he'd decided to fuck me in the middle of a crowded street, I'd have let him. That's what I'd become in his hands-cheap, compliant, a thing to be used.

His fingers moved lower, yanking my skirt up to my hips, then ripping my panties down my legs. I felt the fabric tear slightly, and then I was bare, my thighs trembling despite myself. He stared at me, at the soft, untouched flesh between my legs, and I saw the hunger in his eyes sharpen. My pussy was exposed, vulnerable, and I hated how it looked under his gaze-pink and delicate, a virgin's body he was about to ruin.

He unzipped his pants, and his cock sprang free, thick and hard, the tip already slick with pre-cum. It was intimidating, veined and pulsing, a weapon he wielded with no regard for me. I braced myself as he positioned himself, the head pressing against my entrance. I wasn't ready-dry, tight, resistant-but he didn't care.

"Relax," he muttered, more a command than a comfort, and then he thrust in.

The pain was immediate, a searing rip as he forced his way past my hymen. I bit my lip hard, tasting blood, swallowing the cry that tried to escape. He didn't stop, didn't slow, just kept pushing deeper, stretching me until I thought I'd tear apart. The car rocked with his movements, the windows fogging as his breaths came faster, harsher.

"Cry?" he asked, his voice cutting through the haze of pain. I hadn't even noticed the tears until he pointed them out, hot streaks sliding from the corners of my eyes. I blinked, surprised. I'd thought I was past crying, past feeling anything in front of him. But there they were, betraying me.

"I thought you wanted this," he sneered, his hips slamming into me harder. "Wanted my kid, right? So why the tears?"

"Joy," I said faintly, my voice a ghost of itself. "Overwhelmed with joy."

He laughed, a short, cruel sound. "Quinn, you're fucking disgusting."

Yeah, I thought, so are you. But here we were, two disgusting people tangled up in each other, bound by some twisted fate I couldn't escape. His thrusts grew erratic, brutal, and the pain peaked, a white-hot agony that made my whole body tense beneath him. I shrank into myself, my face pale, my hands gripping the seat until my knuckles whitened.

"Who am I?" he demanded, his voice a snarl.

I clenched my jaw, silent, resisting even as my body gave in.

"Don't make me hurt you more," he threatened, and I felt his teeth graze my ear again, ready to bite.

"Spencer," I choked out, my voice small, broken. "You're Spencer." The devil himself, tormenting me without mercy. I didn't know what I'd done to deserve this-marrying him, maybe, taking away his precious freedom. But he'd never been caged, not really. He did what he wanted, fucked who he wanted, and I let him. So why? Why this endless punishment?

"Good," he said, biting my ear hard enough to draw a whimper. "Remember that. You're mine, Quinn. Only mine."

I smiled coldly inside. His first, sure. But me? Just one of his countless women. What did he have to be mad about? What injustice did he see in me that made him hate me so much?

There was no pleasure in it, not for me. Maybe he felt something-men were different, after all. With all those women he'd had, maybe he could find joy in this. But I couldn't. The pain dulled eventually, my body adjusting, but my heart ached worse than ever. I'd rather feel the physical hurt than this hollow, gnawing despair.

When it was over, he came inside me with a groan, his cock pulsing as he filled me with his release. Then he pulled out, leaving me wet and sore, a mess of his making. He sat back, zipping up his pants, and then, with an almost mocking gentleness, he helped me dress-pulling my panties back up, smoothing my skirt, fixing my bra and suit. Like it mattered.


"Can I get out of the car?" I asked.

Spencer's hands tightened around the steering wheel.

"I value my life," I explained.

"Quinn Ashford, don't push me to my limits," Spencer said, enunciating each word. "Don't think that just because you've satisfied me, I'll indulge your every whim. You know I have so many women outside, and none of them dare to take advantage of my affection."

"I know my place," I replied firmly.

After a few minutes of standoff between us. The door locks suddenly clicked open. Spencer had given in.

"Thank you," I said.

I opened the door and stepped out.

The ground beneath my feet, my body - everything hurt a little. But I didn't hesitate for a second. The moment I closed the door, the luxury car shot forward. Not stopping for even a second.

And the way he sped away so frantically made me feel that my decision had been absolutely correct.

I didn't believe that Spencer would always be lucky enough to avoid accidents. What if there was that one time? What if it was this time?

I looked up at the sky. It looked like it was about to rain. The gloomy weather matched my mood perfectly.
###chapter 280
Serena's POV

The courthouse steps seemed endless as I stood there, my heart hammering against my ribs like it was trying to escape. People brushed past me, their faces blurring into meaningless shapes. The only face I searched for was his.

Lucas.

Our eyes locked and the world around us disappeared. He looked thinner, his tailored suit hanging slightly loose on his once-perfect frame. The dark circles beneath his eyes matched my own, I was sure. But those eyes-those piercing gray eyes that had haunted my dreams-they still held that same intensity that could make me forget my own name.

My breathing turned shallow as something primal and unstoppable rose within me. I didn't remember deciding to move. My body acted on its own, propelling me forward. People turned to stare, but I couldn't have cared less.

I never imagined that seeing him again like this-both of us free, standing face to face-would unleash such a torrent of emotions. My heart pounded against my ribs so violently I feared I might lose control completely. It had been so long since I'd allowed myself to feel this way.

After what happened with Ian Whitmore, I'd trained myself to view emotions with detachment. I didn't want to be hurt again. I didn't want to trust anyone again.

Yet here was Lucas Harrington-a man I'd known for less than a year-who had somehow managed to tear down every wall I'd built. I had fallen for him completely.

Truly, deeply fallen in love.

I stared at him now, feeling the heat rising to my cheeks as my vision blurred with tears. His face was thinner, shadows beneath his eyes testifying to the ordeal he'd endured, but those gray eyes still pierced straight through to my soul.

Before I could think, before I could stop myself, I rushed forward and threw myself into his arms.

"Hmm," he grunted softly.

My heart clenched. Was I hurting him? I hadn't used much force-I was afraid he might collapse if I did. I'd been so careful, so gentle, but he was still in pain. What had he endured during those months in prison? What hadn't he told me?

My chest ached with regret.

Why hadn't I trusted him? Why had I selfishly pushed him away? If I'd stayed by his side through all of this, at least he wouldn't have had to face it alone. The emotional burden might have been lighter.

Thinking of everything I'd done, all the ways I'd failed him, I tightened my arms around his waist, breathing in his scent. For Lucas, I was willing to compromise. For him, I would risk believing in love once more.

I felt his warmth, his solid presence. We held each other, neither willing to let go. It felt like home-a sensation I'd forgotten existed.

I don't know how long we stood there on those courthouse steps, locked in our embrace. Time seemed to stop, the rest of Manhattan fading into insignificance around us.

Eventually, Lucas suppressed a cough, the sound tight and controlled.

Reality came flooding back. I was being selfish again. I'd become so dependent on the feeling of being in his arms that I was afraid to let go, terrified that if I released him, he might disappear. This ordeal had taught me the true meaning of fear-and of gratitude for second chances.

Reluctantly, I pulled away from his embrace. I knew he needed to return home to rest properly. In his current state, he could barely stand without wavering.

As we separated, I raised my eyes to meet his gaze.

In that moment of eye contact, heat rushed to my face again. I realized I'd never been so impulsive with Lucas before. My sudden emotional outburst now left me feeling strangely shy, vulnerable in a way I wasn't accustomed to.

Lucas looks at me with his smile growing more obvious. "You've seen every inch of me, devoured every part. Why so shy now?"

My heart races, feeling a wave of embarrassment wash over me. How can he be so blunt? The memory of that night flashes through my mind-his skin against mine, the heat between us. I try to push the thoughts away, but my burning cheeks betray me.

"Who took advantage of whom?" I shoot back, trying to regain some control over this conversation. That night when I climbed into his bed to get photos to blackmail Rachel, I was the one who made the first move, but during everything that happened? I nearly didn't make it out alive. My body still remembers his touch, the way he took command once things started.

"It takes two to tango," Lucas says with a smirk. "Sex is a team sport."

Even with his pale lips, that smile is pure seduction. I silently marvel at this bewitching man lying in the hospital bed. I never realized before how... uninhibited he is. I feel my face growing redder by the second.

"Don't you want to leave?" I ask, trying to change the subject. I figure the reporters outside probably think Lucas has already snuck out the back. They've been waiting for hours with no sign of him.

"Let's go," Lucas says, reaching for my hand.

My fingers twitch slightly, and I hesitate. I'm not ready for this-for us-to be public knowledge. Everything is happening so fast, and I haven't had time to process what we are to each other now.

"What's wrong?" Lucas's brow furrows, his smile fading.

"There are probably still reporters," I whisper.

His expression hardens instantly. "So I nearly died for you, and you still can't let me be seen with you in public?"
I feel a wave of hesitation. I'm just not used to this yet. I hadn't thought about going public so quickly. I still feel like our relationship is in this undefined gray area.

"Serena, are you serious right now?" Lucas's voice drops low, each word deliberate and sharp. "My engagement is broken, I've given up control of my family's assets, and my body is half-broken because of you. Are you planning to abandon me now?"

I want to argue back. The engagement was something he wanted to end anyway. The assets he liquidated still left him with enough cash to last several lifetimes. And his body? A few weeks of recovery and he'll be back to his devastating good looks. What right does he have to play the victim?

"Well?" His eyes narrow when I don't respond. "You're actually hesitating? Serena, what more do I have to do before you truly accept me? Before you'll let me stand openly by your side?"

Lucas grows more agitated, his voice rising. 

"Do I need to cut my heart out and hand it to you-"

I can't listen to any more of this. Before he can finish, I rise on my tiptoes and press my lips against his, silencing his tirade.

"Mmph." Lucas's eyes widen in surprise.

I watch as the anger in his eyes melts away, replaced by something softer, warmer. I feel a smile forming against my lips. Lucas is so easily pacified.

I stayed nestled in Lucas's embrace, feeling his intent to deepen our kiss, but pulled away. A mischievous thought crossed my mind-I wanted to tease him a little, to see that rare flash of vulnerability in his usually controlled demeanor. The mighty Lucas Harrington, completely at my mercy. The thought made me suppress a smile.

"So you tease me and then refuse to follow through?" His voice carried an unmistakable edge of frustration.

"That's not it," I quickly denied, then teased after a pause, "I just thought you were talking too much."

"..." Lucas's expression darkened considerably.

I could read exactly what was going through his mind. With others, he was famously reserved, measured with his words. Only with me did he open up completely, pouring out his thoughts and feelings, practically baring his soul. And here I was, complaining he talked too much.

Just as I sensed his anger reaching its breaking point, I quickly interjected, "I was thinking about when we should get married."
###chapter 281
Serena's POV

I watched as all the fury drained from Lucas's face, replaced by utter astonishment-no, pure joy. He transitioned from disbelief at what he'd heard to obvious elation.

"Are you serious?" His voice trembled with barely contained excitement.

I couldn't bear the intensity of his gaze and glanced away. "I just... I just want to give Stella a complete family..."

"I do," Lucas responded with sudden solemnity.

"What?" I looked at him, confused.

"Weren't you just proposing to me?" His eyes sparkled with mischief. "I'm answering-I do."

"..." This man really knew how to turn situations to his advantage.

"Come on," he tightened his grip on my hand. "Let's go show the world who we are to each other."

I couldn't help but smile. He was so eager to have our relationship made public.

Hand in hand, we walked toward the courthouse exit. The reporters below had grown impatient waiting for us, sending people several times to check if we'd somehow slipped away. Logically, there wasn't another exit route, unless the court had provided us with some secret backdoor.

The journalists had been waiting with increasing frustration when we suddenly appeared, fingers intertwined. I could read their expressions of delight, practically saying, "Thank goodness you didn't leave!" Our appearance instantly energized the crowd of reporters, who quickly surrounded us, leaving no space to maneuver.

My four security guards had been waiting outside the courthouse all along. They were perceptive enough not to interfere with the intimate moment between Lucas and me, keeping their distance. Now, seeing me encircled by journalists, they moved to intervene, but I signaled with my eyes for them to stand down.

Today, I actually wanted to speak with the press.

"Mr. Harrington, you and Ms. Sinclair emerged holding hands-does this mean what we think it means?"

"Mr. Harrington, that was a masterful performance in court. How are you feeling right now?"

"Mr. Harrington, what exactly is your relationship with Ms. Sinclair? Are you a couple? And what about Rachel Thorne?"

The journalists' voices overlapped in a cacophony, making it nearly impossible to distinguish individual questions. But it didn't matter-today I had made a clear decision. In front of the world, I was ready to acknowledge this man.

"One question at a time, please," I said firmly, surprising the reporters with my willingness to engage. Normally, I'd rush past with a tight smile or no expression at all.

A hush fell over the crowd. Lucas's hand tightened around mine, his thumb tracing small circles against my skin.

"Ms. Sinclair," one particularly bold reporter called out, "are you two officially together?"

I felt a moment of hesitation-not because I was uncertain of my feelings, but because once spoken, these words would ripple through our worlds. The StarRiver business interests, the Harrington empire, two children whose lives would forever change... so many complications from one simple truth.

I looked up at Lucas, finding his steel-gray eyes fixed on me. Not pressuring, simply waiting. He would accept whatever I chose to say.

"Yes," I finally answered, my voice stronger than I expected. "Lucas and I are together."

The explosion of camera flashes nearly blinded me. Lucas's arm slid protectively around my waist.

"What about the rumors connecting Mr. Harrington to Rachel Thorne?" someone shouted.

Before I could respond, Lucas stepped forward slightly. "Those rumors are completely unfounded. Rachel is the godmother to my children and nothing more. Serena is the woman I love, the only woman I've loved for a very long time."

My heart skipped at his public declaration. He'd never been so explicit about his feelings, especially not to a crowd of strangers with recording devices.


Lucas's POV

I stood before the swarm of reporters, my heart pounding against my chest as camera flashes burst like lightning around us. The moment I'd planned for years had finally arrived. Serena stood beside me, her presence giving me the strength I needed. Four security guards formed a protective barrier around us, but they couldn't shield us from the hunger in the reporters' eyes.

"Mr. Harrington, can you explain your relationship with Ms. Sinclair?" a reporter shouted over the chaos.

I looked directly into the cameras, letting my mask fall away completely. "I fell in love with Serena ten years ago."

The crowd erupted, microphones thrust forward as questions flew at me from every direction. I remained calm, my gaze steady. This chaos was exactly what I wanted - the truth deserved to be heard by everyone.

A female reporter with sharp eyes pushed to the front. "What about your engagement to Rachel Thorne? The wedding was scheduled for today."

I felt a flicker of anger but controlled it. The time for hiding was over.

"Let me be clear," I said, my voice dropping an octave, each word measured and deliberate. "Milo and Stella are Serena Sinclair's children."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Camera shutters clicked frantically. From the corner of my eye, I saw Serena's slight intake of breath, but she remained composed beside me, her chin lifted slightly.

I continued, "I won't explain the details. What matters is that we genuinely love each other." I turned toward Serena, my eyes softening as they met hers. "As for Rachel, it was purely a political arrangement I couldn't refuse."

The crowd's murmurs grew louder. A male reporter with glasses pushed forward.

"Mr. Harrington, don't you think your behavior is... undignified? Taking a family to court and publicly humiliating your fiancée on your wedding day?"

I felt heat rising in my chest. My voice remained controlled, but ice crept into my tone.

"Is your moral compass broken?" I asked, staring him down. "The Thornes are criminals. You think I should protect criminals? Shield someone who set me up to take the fall? Am I supposed to be a fool or a patsy?"

The reporter faltered under my gaze. I drove my point home.

"The Thornes used me from the beginning. I simply used their manipulation to achieve my own goals and protect my life and property." I straightened my tie, a habit when I'm containing my emotions. "This isn't about revenge. It's about justice."

A young woman with curly hair called out, "But weren't you using Rachel's feelings for you? That seems cruel."

I nearly laughed. The naivety of the question was almost endearing.

"You think Rachel didn't know her family used me as a scapegoat?" My voice carried effortlessly across the crowd. "When I was overseas, Rachel managed everything. She knew exactly what was happening."

I saw understanding dawn on some faces, confusion on others. Let them piece it together.

An older reporter raised his hand. "Mr. Harrington, your arrest caused quite a stir. The timing seems-"

"Calculated?" I smiled thinly. "It was."

I turned to Serena, my expression softening. "Do you know why I arranged to be arrested on my wedding day with Rachel?"

Serena's lips curved into a knowing smile that made my heart skip. "You needed a legitimate reason to postpone the wedding without raising suspicion. Being arrested for fraud - charges that would later be dropped - created the perfect distraction while you finalized the evidence against the Thornes."

Her intelligence never failed to amaze me. The ease with which she followed my thinking, anticipated my moves...

"Damn it," I said, unable to hide my admiration. "Is it good or bad having a wife this smart?" 

A genuine laugh escaped her lips, and the sound warmed me more than the spring sunshine beating down on us.

The press conference continued, but the energy had shifted. What had begun as an ambush transformed into something else - the unveiling of a truth too long hidden.

As we concluded, I placed my hand lightly on the small of Serena's back, guiding her toward our waiting car. For the first time in public, I didn't have to hide my feelings for her.

"You okay?" I asked quietly as we walked away from the cameras.

"Better than okay," she whispered back. "Though I think you enjoyed that a little too much."

I smiled, not bothering to deny it. "Ten years, Serena. Ten years of waiting to tell the world you're mine."

The security team closed around us as we approached the car. The door opened, and I helped her inside before sliding in next to her. As the door closed, shutting out the shouted questions and camera flashes, I finally took her hand in mine.

"It's done," I said simply.

In her eyes, I saw the same relief I felt coursing through me. No more hiding. No more pretending. The truth was out there now, unavoidable and undeniable.
###chapter 282
Lucas's POV

As Serena and I settled into the back seat of the sedan, I couldn't help but notice the four bodyguards-one driving, another in the passenger seat, and two more following in a separate car. My face tightened with displeasure.

"Did Atticus arrange these for you?" I asked, my voice carrying an edge I couldn't quite conceal. Something about another man providing protection for my woman stirred an uncomfortable feeling in my chest-a mixture of jealousy and territorial instinct I rarely acknowledged.

"He's concerned for my safety," Serena replied without hesitation, her eyes meeting mine directly. "Who knows what Rachel might try next!"

Though irritation simmered beneath my surface, I swallowed it down. Her safety mattered more than my pride. The thought of Rachel's previous schemes made my jaw clench-Serena had legitimate reasons to be cautious.

"Atticus couldn't possibly be interested in me. What are you jealous of?" Serena said with a hint of exasperation in her voice.

I deliberately kept my tone light, masking the deeper emotions. "I'll collect on that debt later, gorgeous." What mattered most was that she understood my feelings, even when left unspoken.

Serena's lips curved into a teasing smile. "Is that a threat or a promise, Mr. Harrington?"

Then her expression shifted to something more serious. "Tell me, did you really just discover that the Thorne family has been using your name for their schemes?"

Facing her direct question, I decided there would be no more half-truths between us. She deserved complete honesty.

"No," I admitted plainly. "I'm a businessman too. I prioritize profit when necessary."

"So..." She waited for me to continue, her eyes searching mine.

"I discovered it quite some time ago," I confessed, recalling the internal struggle that had accompanied that knowledge. "I simply chose not to intervene."

"So as long as it posed no threat to you, you were content to let it continue?" she asked, her voice carefully neutral.

"Perhaps," I nodded, acknowledging a truth that might disappoint her, but I refused to pretend to be someone I wasn't-not with her.

Serena pressed her lips together thoughtfully.

"I'm not a good man, but I'm certainly not a bad one either," I explained, hoping she would understand my position. "I'm simply not noble enough to risk my assets or personal safety. Confronting the Thornes-if it failed, I'd be the one to pay the price, and it would endanger everyone close to me. I couldn't take that risk." I paused, watching her reaction. "Besides, fraud typically requires both a deceiver and someone willing to be deceived. Without that greed, no one would fall for the trap. It's merely a costly lesson."

"I'm not judging you," Serena said, and I felt relief wash over me. "In your position, I might have done the same. Before doing good deeds, you have to protect your family first. That's understandable."

Her understanding warmed something deep within me. "Thank you for understanding, dear wife," I said, the corner of my mouth lifting, deliberately using "wife" to close the distance between us.

"Was Benjamin Kennedy brought in specially by you?" Serena continued.

"Yes," I answered, holding nothing back from her now.

"Why would Kennedy help you? Is he truly as righteous and unyielding as rumors suggest?"

"Not exactly," I shook my head, wanting her to understand the complex dynamics at play. "I can't judge his character since our interactions have been limited. But in true partnerships, feelings are secondary-interests are fundamental."

"He has something to gain by going after the Thornes?" she asked perceptively.

"Of course," I explained. "On the surface, the Kennedy and Thorne families appear harmonious, but underneath, they're locked in constant conflict. Each wants to claim the other's territory, and each fears being dragged down by the other. Given the opportunity, they'll stomp on each other without hesitation. For them, eliminating rivals one by one is standard practice."

"Are family dynasties really that ruthless?" she asked, surprise evident in her voice.

"Did you think reaching the heights was easy?" I asked with a slight smile, realizing how sheltered she still was from certain realities.

"Is that why you liquidated the Harrington family assets? Because you understood all these schemes and didn't want to be entangled in dynasty politics anymore?" Serena questioned.

The question made my heart sink. She had guessed part of it, but not the complete truth.

"Not entirely," I replied, my eyes darkening slightly as I struggled with how to explain this complex decision.

Seeing Serena's worried expression, I knew I had to tell her everything.

"Kennedy made me do this," I said deliberately, each word measured. I looked directly into Serena's eyes, sensing the emotional turmoil within her. I knew this answer would worry her, but honesty was necessary.

Her expression immediately tensed. "Benjamin Kennedy? What's his objective?"

I understood her confusion. She had assumed I sold Harrington International Holdings merely to protect myself, following my grandfather Howard's example of withdrawing from worldly affairs and controversies. She hadn't anticipated the Kennedy family connection. 

"You can probably guess," I said softly, watching the emotions play across her face. I could see realization dawning-the very answer she dreaded most.

Her chest moved slightly, her eyes flashing with concern. I needed to tell her everything.

"Yes, Kennedy wants me to assist him, but Harrington International's profile is too prominent now. He needs me with a lower profile, working alongside him," I explained slowly, hoping she would comprehend my situation.

"Assist him with what?" Serena asked. "What ambitions does he harbor?"

Facing her question, I could only be forthright: "The Kennedy family situation resembles the Thornes'. While the Thorne family experienced internal branch conflicts, the Kennedy brothers are engaged in both open and hidden power struggles. Kennedy wants to use me to suppress his brothers and secure his position as the family heir."

"Isn't he already the heir?" Serena asked, puzzled.

I understood her confusion. Public rumors indeed portrayed Benjamin Kennedy as the heir apparent-the eldest son, highly respected within the Kennedy family, and undeniably capable. His inheritance seemed natural.

"Honestly, I'm not fully informed yet," I shrugged. "I'll learn more once I'm deeper inside." I hadn't completely grasped the Kennedy family's internal complexities, but I knew this path was unavoidable.

Concern sparkled in Serena's eyes. "Must you entangle yourself with them? Can't we simply withdraw completely and live our lives peacefully?"

Her words brought both warmth and pain to my heart. For her, I would sacrifice everything, but reality prevented us from simply living an ordinary life.

"I'll try to extricate myself as soon as possible," I promised, though I knew internally that since deciding to completely break with the Thorne family, I no longer had choices.

Without Kennedy's influence, my lawsuit would never have proceeded smoothly. If Kennedy hadn't intimidated the chief judge to continue the trial today, my case would have been suppressed, and the Thorne family would have quietly disposed of all compelling evidence. I needed an even stronger force to counter the Thornes.

To use this power meant negotiating with Benjamin Kennedy. He directly requested my help, and I agreed.

"Lucas, is it worth it?" Serena suddenly asked, her eyes already red-rimmed.

Looking at her tear-filled eyes, my heart clenched painfully. 

If I had accepted the engagement to Rachel Thorne, even though the Thorne family was using me, as long as this arrangement remained unquestioned, we could have coexisted peacefully. The alliance between Harrington and Thorne would have elevated both families. After Clarence Thorne removed Silas Thorne and controlled both political and commercial spheres, anything would have been possible. Among elite families, no one disturbs the others lightly. Once the Thorne family's internal conflicts resolved, everything would have proceeded smoothly.

Yet for her sake, I abandoned this clear path only to mire myself in another quagmire. 

"Absolutely," I met her gaze directly, using my finger-seemingly reduced to just bone-to gently wipe away her tears. I said sincerely: "For me, losing you means losing the entire world. Without you, what use would I have for anything else?"

Serena looked at me emotionally, and in that moment, I felt unwavering certainty. Whatever the future held, I would never regret my current choice.

Just then, her phone suddenly rang. I watched as she glanced at the caller ID, composed herself, and answered: "Atticus."
###chapter 283
Serena's POV

I watched the screen of my phone light up with a name I hadn't expected to see today. Swallowing hard, I glanced at Lucas beside me before answering.

"Atticus." I kept my voice neutral, conscious of Lucas's eyes on me.

"You sound happy. Life treating you well?" Atticus's tone was casual, almost playful.

"It's fine." I deliberately kept my response short, not wanting to give Lucas any reason for concern. 

"Well, I'm about to ruin that for you." His voice shifted, becoming serious in a way that made my stomach clench. I felt my brow furrow involuntarily, and Lucas immediately sat up straighter, his eyes sharpening as he observed my reaction.

"I have some bad news. Rachel is missing." Atticus's words were measured, deliberate.

"Missing?" My heart skipped a beat as dread washed over me.

"After Lucas's court case became public today, the Thorne family-including me and my grandfather-were all brought in for questioning by the prosecutors. The evidence against Garrett is substantial. He's being detained temporarily. When we finished our interviews and came out, we learned that Rachel disappeared the moment law enforcement went to find her. She's not in Portland."

"Could she have gone to Massachusetts?" I asked, thinking of Kennedy Rowan.

"No, she's here in Manhattan. We just confirmed she arrived in the city yesterday. I suspect she might have attended Lucas's court hearing."

"She wasn't there." I answered with absolute certainty, mentally scanning the faces I'd seen in the courtroom. The woman who had caused Lucas so much pain hadn't shown her face.

"I'm just giving you a heads-up. On another note, Clarence Thorne is in serious trouble. Our family reputation and business connections will take a significant hit. Our legal team is actively working on damage control, but the Thorne family will need to keep a low profile for the foreseeable future. I have to admit, Lucas played this masterfully. His strategic vision in this battle has been nothing short of impressive."

I could hear the genuine admiration in Atticus's voice, and a small flutter of pride rose in my chest.

"Ask him if he'd consider a partnership now that Harrington International is facing restructuring. I'd make it worth his while-I take care of those who've saved my life." Atticus promised.

"Wasn't I the one who saved your life?" I raised an eyebrow, internally mocking his pragmatism.

"Either way, don't worry," I continued before he could respond. "Lucas is busy." I made the decision for Lucas without hesitation.

After ending the call, I turned to Lucas. "That was Atticus. He says Rachel is here in Manhattan."

Lucas's eyes narrowed slightly. "So she wasn't arrested?"

"No."

"Did you see her today?" His voice was measured, controlled.

"No," I shook my head.

Suddenly, Lucas's expression transformed. The controlled mask slipped, revealing a flash of raw panic in his eyes. "Where are Milo and Stella?"

My blood ran cold as I immediately understood his concern. My hands began to tremble as fear gripped my heart. "At school," I managed to say, my voice shaking.

"We need to go to the school right now. Call them immediately and tell them no one is to take Milo or Stella out." His commanding tone betrayed the urgency of the situation.

My fingers trembled as I dialed the school office number, silently praying for Milo and Stella's safety. When no one answered, terror washed over me like an icy wave.

"Don't be afraid. Nothing will happen to them. I'm just being cautious," Lucas tried to reassure me, but my intuition was screaming that Rachel had already taken advantage of the distraction caused by Lucas's court case to take Milo and Stella.

"Give me your phone," Lucas said, maintaining his composure despite the situation.

I quickly handed it to him. He dialed a number. "Miles, contact the principal immediately. Tell him I'll be coming to pick up Milo shortly and instruct them that until I arrive, absolutely no one else is authorized to take Milo or Stella."

As we sat in the car rushing toward the children's school, the silence between us was suffocating. I stared out the window, my heart hammering wildly in my chest, images of Milo's bright smile and Stella's serious gray eyes flashing through my mind. The twins had become so important to me-their safety meaning everything.

The phone rang again.

I felt the atmosphere in the car instantly grow more tense, even our breathing becoming cautious. Lucas answered the call.

"Miles," he said.

I stared at Lucas's expression, trying to capture any information I could.

"Sir, the young master was picked up around ten o'clock this morning. The principal said it was his mother who came for him, claiming to be Rachel Thorne."
###chapter 284
Serena's POV

"What about Stella? Where is she now?"

"She's still at school."

"Protect her immediately and escort her home. If anything happens to her, you'll face my wrath."

I watched Lucas's face darken terribly. My heart sank, a foreboding feeling washing over me.

"Understood!" Lucas slammed down the phone.

I quickly asked, "Is he with Rachel?" I watched the murderous glint flickering in his eyes, already dreading the worst outcome.

Lucas's Adam's apple bobbed as he slowly nodded.

That moment felt like a thunderbolt striking on a clear day. I felt as though the sky had collapsed. An unprecedented fear and despair consumed me. I would rather everything be directed at me instead. I couldn't imagine what Rachel might do to Milo, if she actually did something... I dared not continue that train of thought.

"Don't be afraid." Lucas took my hand, and though his own fingers trembled, he still tried to comfort me. "Rachel won't hurt Milo. She'll only use him to threaten us, and since she hasn't called yet, it means Milo is definitely safe."

I couldn't accept this comfort. Fear and anxiety made it impossible for me to maintain my rationality.

"But what if?" I challenged Lucas, my voice filled with trembling desperation. "Someone as clever as her surely knows how to hurt us the most, doesn't she? She knows Milo is my weakness. She knows Milo matters most!"

Just thinking about the worst possible outcome made it impossible for me to calm down; the fear was nearly suffocating.

"She won't," Lucas stated with certainty. "Rachel knows you're what matters most."

My heart skipped a beat as I stared directly at Lucas, hardly believing what I'd heard.

"Trust me," he continued. "In Rachel's mind, you matter more than Milo. She's never been a parent; she doesn't understand how important children are to their parents. Coming from a family like the Thornes where affection is thin and relationships are based on interest, she doesn't comprehend deep emotional bonds. She'll think that even without Milo, we could have other children to replace him. Without Milo, we'd suffer temporarily, but if I lost you, I'd suffer for a lifetime! If she wants revenge against me, she'll absolutely use you, not Milo."

Lucas spoke quickly and urgently. I wasn't sure if he was trying to convince me or himself. But I had to try to believe him, for the child's sake and for my own.

I bit my lip hard, struggling to calm myself and trust what Lucas was saying. I took a deep breath, steadying my emotions.

"So what do we do now? Just wait for Rachel to contact us?" I asked, trying to keep the desperation out of my voice.

"Rachel is probably already being sought by authorities. She won't show herself easily or contact us right away. She's smart-she knows the longer we wait, the more our emotions will spiral out of control, making it easier for her to get what she wants. We can't sit and wait. Let's try to track down her hiding place and see if we can find her before she contacts us."

"Yes," I nodded, feeling a glimmer of hope. At least we were taking action rather than helplessly waiting.

After his analysis, Lucas wasted no time. He picked up my phone again and began making calls, issuing instructions.

"Get me the surveillance footage starting from nine this morning..."

"Track the current location of Rachel's car..."

"Find the latest IP address from Rachel's phone number..."

The car stopped in my building's garage. Throughout the journey, Lucas had been constantly on the phone, even filing a police report, emphasizing caution in apprehending Rachel since she had a hostage.

After doing everything possible, we went to my apartment together.

As soon as we arrived, the surveillance footage was transmitted. My heart raced as I quickly grabbed my laptop and opened the video. The footage began playing at four times the normal speed until, in the school entrance monitoring frame, I spotted Milo.

Lucas and I both stared tensely at the screen. I saw Milo being led out by a teacher. When he spotted Rachel, he showed clear reluctance, obviously not wanting to leave with her. My heart both ached and felt proud seeing the child's resistance. But Rachel swiftly picked Milo up, and when he struggled, she handed him directly to a black-suited bodyguard behind her.

The teacher, witnessing this, seemed to notice something amiss. But Rachel said something to her, and the teacher's doubts apparently vanished.

This happened around nine-thirty in the morning, before Lucas's case had begun and before anyone knew about the trouble with the Thorne family. Naturally, the teacher wouldn't be suspicious. Moreover, Rachel had attended the school sports day with Lucas previously. In the teacher's mind, even if Rachel and Lucas were no longer engaged, following media rumors, she would still believe Rachel was Milo's biological mother.

Handing a child to his birth mother seemed perfectly reasonable. More importantly, given Rachel's status and position at that time, the teacher wouldn't dare oppose her anyway.

I watched as Milo was constrained by the bodyguard and forced into the car. Seeing his small body clearly fighting but helpless, my entire heart constricted with pain. Tears welled in my eyes, but I couldn't break down. I couldn't collapse now. To find my child, I had to stay strong.

I wiped away the tears threatening to fall and looked at Lucas. His jaw was clenched so tight I could see the muscle jumping beneath his skin.

"Every second counts," he said, his voice low and controlled despite the fury in his eyes. "The first few hours are critical. I've contacted everyone I know in law enforcement."

Watching him take charge calmed me slightly.

"Did she leave any message?" I asked, scanning the footage again. "Any hint about where she might take him?"

Lucas shook his head. "Not yet. But she will. This is a power play for her. She wants us to know she's in control."
###chapter 285 Missing Milo
Lucas's POV
I stared at the security footage, my jaw clenched so tight I could feel a dull ache spreading through my temples. The smooth leather of the chair creaked beneath me as I leaned forward, eyes fixed on the screen.
"Rachel's driving her own sedan," I said, keeping my voice deliberately steady. Inside, a storm was building, but I couldn't afford to lose control. 
Beside me, Serena's face was pale, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. She was trying so hard to be strong, and seeing her struggle sent a fresh wave of pain through my chest. 
"The car," I continued, focusing on the facts rather than the fear. "Besides Rachel and Stella, there are three other people inside."
My fingers moved across the keyboard, capturing screenshots of the three faces. The one holding Milo was somewhat clear, but the other two were blurry shadows in the background.
I turned to Serena, trying to keep my voice calm. "Send these to Atticus. Ask him to get clear photos of these three from Rachel's security team."
Serena nodded, immediately pulling out her phone. Her hands trembled slightly, but her eyes were determined. "I'll call him right now."
While she contacted Atticus, I forwarded the images to my own team. Every second counted. I could feel time slipping through my fingers like sand, each grain potentially taking Milo further away from us.
"Atticus is sending the photos," Serena said, her voice breaking slightly. "He says he'll have them within minutes."
I reached out without thinking, covering her hand with mine. Her skin was cold. "We'll find him," I promised, hoping I sounded more confident than I felt. "I have people all over the city looking already."
Her eyes met mine, vulnerable yet trusting. "I know," she whispered. "I know you'll find him."
My phone rang, interrupting the moment. I answered immediately upon seeing Miles's number.
"Sir, we've located Rachel's car. It's in a parking structure by the abandoned warehouse district, only the driver got out. The footage clearly shows there was no one else inside. The driver matches one of the photos you sent me."
"Any further tracking?" I asked, my heart rate accelerating with this first real lead.
"The area is remote. Surveillance cameras are sparse out there. I went through the footage repeatedly and finally discovered he boarded a public bus. I checked the bus surveillance and saw him get off at the shopping center. He quickly disappeared into the crowd, and we lost sight of him." Miles detailed the tracking situation.
"What about the shopping center cameras?" I pressed, refusing to overlook any possibility.
"We have footage, but it's crowded. Even with more than ten people reviewing different segments, we haven't spotted them yet..."
"Send it to me," I ordered, already clearing space on my second monitor.
"One more thing, sir," Miles added. "You asked me to trace Rachel's phone's cell tower location. The last ping was at Milo's school. That's the last place she used her phone."
"Understood." My mind was already mapping potential routes and hideouts.
As soon as the call ended, I turned to the fresh set of images Serena had received from Atticus. High-resolution faces stared back at us. I committed each face to memory, then distributed them to my security team with explicit instructions.
"Miles," I called back. "Have someone check that mall in person. See if our suspect is still there."
Even as I coordinated the search, I knew we needed more help. My fingers hovered over Drew's contact for just a moment before I made the call.
"Drew, Milo's been taken by Rachel. I need your help." The words felt foreign in my mouth. 
The room around us had transformed into a command center. Computer screens cast a blue glow over our faces, security feeds flickered across multiple monitors, and our phones continuously buzzed with updates. 
Serena remained by my side, her breathing shallow but controlled. She was analyzing footage from the shopping center, meticulously scanning each frame for any sign of Milo or his captors, her eyes red-rimmed.
The doorbell's sharp ring cut through my thoughts. Fifteen minutes after my call, Spencer and Drew rushed in, their faces tight with concern. 
Forty minutes later, "Sir, we've searched the entire shopping center. There's no sign of that man. He must have left already," Miles reported, his voice hesitant.
"Left?" I repeated, the word tasting bitter on my tongue.
I leaned closer to the screen, rewinding the footage for what must have been the twentieth time. My eyes scanned every pixel, every shadow, every movement. Nothing escaped my attention. And yet, somehow, this man had vanished.
"I'll have the team search again, see if we missed something. I'll report back," Miles said.
"Hmm," I responded, barely registering his words as I continued to study the monitors.
The shopping center was sprawling-four levels of stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Thousands of people passed through its doors every day. And somewhere, hidden among them, was the man who had taken my son.
My son.
The thought of him alone and frightened made my chest constrict painfully. I forced myself to breathe steadily, to focus on the task at hand. Emotion clouded judgment, and right now, Milo needed my mind to be clear.
Suddenly, a thought struck me with such clarity that I nearly jerked upright in my chair.
"What if he disguised himself?" I said, more to myself than anyone else.
Spencer, who had been silently analyzing the footage beside me, nodded. "It's possible."
"Let's think this through," I said, forcing my racing thoughts into order.
I pushed back from the desk, my mind mapping out possibilities with cold precision. "Rachel came from Portland to Manhattan to kidnap Milo. Manhattan isn't Thorne territory-she couldn't have prepared extensively. That means her bodyguard couldn't have planted disguise clothes in the shopping center beforehand."
My eyes returned to the footage, zooming in on the man's figure. "From the video, he wasn't carrying any bag or package that could contain a change of clothes. The only possibility is that he purchased something to wear from one of the stores in the center."
I turned to Miles, my voice sharp with urgency. "Take his photo and have your people question every clothing retailer in the center. Ask if they saw him, what he bought, which direction he went when he left."
Then I looked at Spencer and the others. "You should focus on the smaller stores and market stalls. Places selling inexpensive, generic clothing would be ideal for a quick disguise."
The room burst into activity, everyone moving with renewed purpose. I returned to the monitors, methodically checking each camera feed with even greater attention.
Less than thirty minutes later, Drew called my name. "Lucas."
I turned, and he pointed to his screen. "Is this our guy?"
I moved to his side in three quick strides, my gaze locking onto the image. The height, the build, the way he carried himself-despite the changes to his appearance, I recognized him instantly.
"That's him," I confirmed, my voice hardening.
"He bought a dark gray outdated coat and a black hat," Drew explained. "Disguised himself as an elderly man."
Without another word, I returned to my computer, fingers flying across the keyboard as I tracked the man's movements through the shopping center's surveillance system. "Got him. He left through the third exit."
###chapter 286 Breakthrough Leads
Lucas's POV
I looked up from my computer screen just as Serena turned her head toward me. Her eyes-anxious and troubled at first-widened in shock before suddenly lighting up with hope. Without hesitation, she rushed to my side, her gaze fixed on the face I had managed to identify on my monitor.
Drew and Spencer followed closely behind her, their expressions transforming from disbelief to elation as they looked at my screen.
"Oh God, Luc, you're amazing," she whispered, her voice trembling with emotion. She threw her arms around me in a tight embrace, and seeing her like this-so vulnerable yet so strong-made my heart ache. Serena meant everything to me, and now I was carrying twice the burden of worry.
I gently stroked her hair, keeping my voice low and steady despite the turmoil inside me. "We'll find Milo. Everything will be okay."
I reached for my phone, punching in Miles's number. "Miles, I'm sending you images of our target in disguise. Pull footage from the security cameras at the third exit and follow his trail. Find out where he went and notify me immediately."
As I ended the call, I turned back to the team gathered in my living room. "We need to change our approach. Let's stop analyzing this segment and focus on Rachel's movements after she left Milo's school. We need to determine where they exited the vehicle. That might give us additional clues to their location."
"Once we pinpoint their location," I said, my voice low and measured, "we won't be at a disadvantage during the rescue operation." My mind was already racing through possibilities, assessing risks. "We might even catch Rachel completely off guard."



Serena's POV
The silence was suffocating. Every tick of the clock on the wall felt like a hammer against my skull. I couldn't stop fidgeting with the hem of my blouse, my eyes constantly darting between the other anxious faces in the room. Drew sat motionless on the edge of the sofa, his usual confident demeanor replaced by a grim expression. Spencer paced by the windows, occasionally parting the blinds to peer outside, as if expecting someone to arrive.
Lucas stood perfectly still near the fireplace, one hand gripping the mantel so tightly his knuckles had turned white. The hard lines of his face were set in stone, but I could see the storm raging behind his eyes.
When the phone rang, we all jumped. The sudden noise cut through the tension like a knife. Everyone's eyes flew to Lucas as he pulled his phone. I held my breath, my heartbeat thundering in my ears.
"Miles," Lucas answered, his voice controlled but strained.
I unconsciously bit my lower lip, hoping desperately it was Rachel calling. As terrible as she was, I'd accept any conditions, bear any humiliation, do whatever it took-if only she'd give Milo back to us. My precious little boy...
"Have you found their location?" Lucas asked, and my heart leapt into my throat. I watched him intently, noting how his hand trembled slightly as it gripped the phone.
I couldn't hear Miles's response, but I saw the almost imperceptible change in Lucas's expression-a flash of something that might have been hope.
"Where are they?" Lucas demanded, his voice dropping an octave lower.
As Lucas listened, I found myself holding my breath again, my fingernails digging painfully into my palms. Please let Milo be safe.
"Found him," Lucas said after a moment, making eye contact with me for the first time in hours. "Miles tracked him using the disguise photos. They followed security cameras and calculated his movements. He's in an abandoned warehouse in the South District. Miles says they're keeping their distance to avoid alerting anyone."
"Don't move," Lucas commanded into the phone. "I'm coming right now."
Before he could even end the call, I was on my feet. "I'm coming with you," I declared, my voice leaving no room for argument. This wasn't a request.
Lucas looked at me, gray eyes meeting mine, and nodded once. He turned to Drew and Spencer. "Stay here. If Stella wakes up, don't tell her anything yet. I'll call if we need backup."
The night had fully descended by the time we reached the building's entrance. Three black sedans waited at the curb, with at least ten security personnel in dark suits standing vigilantly beside them. I didn't waste time wondering when Lucas had arranged all this-my mind was consumed with thoughts of Milo.
We slid into the middle car, Lucas directing the driver with a quiet word. As we pulled away from the curb, silence filled the space between us. The city lights streaked past the windows, but inside our vehicle, the darkness felt complete.
I glanced at Lucas, noting his rigid posture and the way his jaw clenched rhythmically. Suddenly, he broke into a coughing fit, one hand flying to his chest. Even in the dim light, I could see how pale he'd become, his skin almost translucent.
My heart ached at the sight. He'd only been released from that hellish detention center days ago, and his body was still recovering from whatever they'd done to him there. If I hadn't been so consumed with worry for Milo, I might have reached out, might have asked if he was alright. 
The warehouse district loomed before us, abandoned and eerie in the darkness. Our convoy pulled to a stop a short distance from a dilapidated building. No lights shone from within, only the pale crescent moon providing any illumination to the scene.
Miles approached as soon as we stepped out of the car, his breath forming small clouds in the cold night air.
"Boss, the subject hasn't left the building. I've got people watching all exits, and no one has gone in or out since we located him."
"Has anyone brought anything inside? Food? Supplies?" Lucas asked, his eyes scanning the warehouse's façade.
"Nothing," Miles replied. "And the lights haven't been turned on at all."
Lucas's brow furrowed, and I recognized that look-he was processing information, sensing something wasn't right. "That's strange," he muttered, almost to himself.
Despite his weakened state, Lucas squared his shoulders. "I'm going in. Pick two of your best men to come with me."
Fear gripped me anew. Without thinking, I reached out and grabbed his hand. His fingers felt thinner than I remembered, frailer somehow. If I could, I would have held onto him tightly, preventing him from facing any danger. But our son needed him.
Reluctantly, I released his hand, my eyes meeting his in the moonlight. "Please make sure Stella is safe."
He looked down at me, his gaze softening for just a moment. "I will," he promised.
###chapter 287 Warehouse Confrontation
Lucas's POV
I gave Serena a reassuring glance, hoping to ease the worry etched across her beautiful face. My team of security personnel flanked us as we approached the abandoned warehouse. The night air felt heavy with tension, each breath a calculated move in this dangerous game.
"Stay close," I ordered.
My heart hammered against my chest, but I maintained a composed exterior. I didn't dare act too boldly, so I proceeded with careful precision, each step measured and deliberate.
I positioned myself against the cold metal door, pressing my ear to listen for any movement inside. Nothing. The silence was more unsettling than any noise could have been. I exchanged glances with my head security guard, a subtle nod conveying my command.
With practiced efficiency, he produced a pair of bolt cutters, working on the padlock with surprising delicacy for his size. The metal gave way with only the faintest click, a sound that seemed to echo in the tense silence surrounding us.
"Ready?" I mouthed to my team.
The door swung open, revealing a darkness so complete it seemed to swallow the meager light from outside. I couldn't make out anything beyond the threshold-it was as if the warehouse opened into a void.
"I'll go first," said one of my security guards, clicking on a small tactical flashlight.
I followed immediately behind him, unwilling to wait. The second guard took up the rear, ensuring our protection from all sides. The beam of light cut through the darkness, revealing a scene of abandonment and decay. Construction materials lay scattered across the concrete floor, covered in a thick layer of dust. The air was stale, carrying the scent of mold and neglect.
My eyes scanned every corner, every shadow. The light caught particles of dust dancing in its beam, but no sign of human presence. My chest tightened with growing suspicion.
"Is anyone really here?" I thought, the doubt creeping into my mind like poison. Had we been led into a trap? Was this all a wild goose chase while Milo was somewhere else entirely?
A faint sound-barely perceptible-caught my attention. The scrape of a shoe against concrete, perhaps. Then, a shadow moved at the edge of our light's reach.
"There!" I pointed, and one of my guards immediately gave chase, disappearing into the darkness beyond.
I stood alert, every muscle in my body tense and ready. Something felt wrong. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and I experienced that unmistakable sensation of being watched.
Instinct took over. I pivoted sharply to the side, just as a figure lunged from the shadows behind me. The movement was so fluid, so immediate, it surprised even me.
My guard reacted instantly, throwing himself between me and the attacker. The two men collided with brutal force, grappling in a deadly dance. I could hear their labored breathing, the impact of fists against flesh.
The other guard, hearing the commotion, abandoned his pursuit and rushed back, joining the fray with professional precision. 
I pulled out my phone, activating its flashlight to better see the scene unfolding before me. As the light illuminated the attacker's face, recognition hit me like a physical blow.
"It's him," I said, my voice a dangerous whisper. "The man from the video."
The realization crashed over me in waves. If this man was here, where was Rachel? Where was my son? I swept the flashlight around, illuminating every corner of the warehouse. Nothing but debris and shadows.
"She's not here," I said, the words bitter on my tongue. "Milo's not here either."
Anger surged through me, white-hot and overwhelming. Rachel knew me too well, knew exactly how I would respond to that video. She anticipated my every move, using my predictability against me. This had been a game to her all along, and I had played right into her hands.
My guards had subdued the attacker, forcing him to his knees before me. His face was bloodied, but his defiant expression remained intact.
"We've got him secured, sir," my guard reported, maintaining a tight grip on the man's arms.
I approached slowly, my footsteps echoing in the cavernous space. When I spoke, my voice was ice.
"Where is Rachel Thorne?"
The man spat blood onto the concrete floor. "I don't know."
Something snapped inside me. I struck him across the face, the impact sending a shock of pain through my knuckles. I barely felt it through the haze of my rage.
"I'll ask you one more time," I growled, leaning close. "Where has Rachel taken my son? I swear I can kill you right here, right now."
His eyes, though fearful, remained resolute. "In our line of work, you either live or die. I've made my peace with that. Go ahead and kill me if you want, but I will never betray my employer..."
I struck him again, harder this time. Blood sprayed from his lip, spattering the floor. My control was slipping away with each passing second.
I grabbed his throat, my fingers digging into his flesh. "Tell me where Rachel is!" I demanded, tightening my grip. "Where is my son?!"
He choked and gasped but managed to wheeze out his defiance. "I'd rather die."
Something primal took over then. My vision tunneled until all I could see was this man-this obstacle between me and my child. I squeezed harder, watching as his face turned red, then purple. Some distant part of me knew I was crossing a line, but I couldn't stop. In that moment, I was capable of anything.
My face contorted with fury. 
"Lucas!"
"Lucas, stop!"
###chapter 288
Serena's POV
I couldn't stop pacing outside the warehouse, my entire body thrumming with anxiety. The night air felt thick and oppressive against my skin, but I barely noticed it. 
"Come on, come on," I whispered to myself, rubbing my arms as I stared at the dilapidated building. Every second felt like an eternity. My entire heart was suspended in midair, unable to settle back into my chest.
The warehouse loomed before me, its windows broken and dark. What was happening inside? The silence was almost worse than hearing something-anything-that might tell me Lucas was okay.
Then I heard it. The unmistakable sounds of a fight-grunts, thuds, something shattering. My body moved before my mind could catch up, racing toward the entrance.
"Ms. Sinclair, you can't go in there!" Miles appeared from nowhere, blocking my path. His usually impassive face showed genuine concern. "It's not safe. Let me and my men check first."
I nodded reluctantly, watching as he disappeared with two security guards into the darkness. My fingers twisted together anxiously. One minute passed. Then two. When Miles didn't return, I couldn't bear it anymore.
The rational part of my brain screamed at me to stay put, but my heart wouldn't listen. The moment Miles was out of sight, I slipped through the heavy metal door and entered the warehouse.
The interior was pitch black and smelled of mildew and something metallic that made my stomach turn. I fumbled for my phone, switching on the flashlight to guide my way through the maze of abandoned crates and machinery.
That's when my light caught them-Lucas standing over a man, his hands wrapped around the stranger's throat. The man's face was turning purple, his legs kicking uselessly against the concrete floor.
"Oh my God," I whispered, my blood turning to ice. If I hadn't illuminated them with my phone's flashlight, I would never have known Lucas was in the process of killing someone.
"Lucas!" I screamed, my voice echoing through the cavernous space. "LUCAS HARRINGTON!"
He didn't even flinch. His focus remained laser-sharp on the struggling man, his hands tightening further. I'd never seen this side of him-this cold, merciless version that scared me to my core.
"Where is she?" Lucas growled, his voice so low and dangerous I barely recognized it. "Tell me where Rachel is or I swear to God, this is your last breath."
My mind raced. Murder was illegal-obviously-but more than that, I couldn't let Lucas throw everything away like this. 
When my voice failed to break through to him, I rushed forward, wrapping my arms around him from behind. My entire body trembled as I pressed myself against his back, feeling the tension in his muscles.
"Lucas, let him go," I begged, tears streaming down my face. My voice cracked with desperation. "Please, you have to stop. You have to let him go! I can't-I can't let you do this. If you kill him, what happens then? You'll go to prison. What about Milo? What about Stella? What about..." I choked on a sob. "What about me? What am I supposed to do if you're gone?"
For a terrifying moment, nothing changed. Then I felt a slight hesitation in his body, a momentary rigidity that told me my words had penetrated the darkness consuming him.
Slowly, painfully, his fingers unclenched. The man collapsed to the floor, gasping and coughing violently.
Lucas knelt beside him, grabbing his shirt collar. "Where is Rachel? What has she done with my son?"
The man merely wheezed, unable or unwilling to answer. Lucas's jaw tightened dangerously, but he stood up and stepped back toward me.
"Miles," he called, his voice eerily calm now. "Get what we need from him. But don't..." He glanced at me, something complicated passing across his features. "Don't let it end in death."
Miles nodded once, motioning for his men to take over.
Lucas turned to me fully then, his gray eyes finding mine in the dim light. I must have looked a wreck-mascara streaking down my cheeks, hair wild from running my hands through it countless times.
"I'm sorry," he said simply, the words so inadequate for what had just happened.
I shook my head, unable to form coherent thoughts. Instead, I reached for his hand, interlacing our fingers tightly. I tugged him toward the exit, desperate to leave this place.
The car waited outside, its interior a sanctuary from the horror of the warehouse. I slid in first, Lucas following silently. As the vehicle pulled away, I realized I was still shaking uncontrollably. Whether from fear, adrenaline, or worry about Milo, I couldn't tell.
Minutes stretched in silence. I stared at our still-joined hands, wondering how the same fingers that had nearly ended a life minutes ago could feel so reassuring against mine.
"She did this deliberately," Lucas finally said, breaking the oppressive quiet. "Rachel planned this."
I nodded slowly. "Yes." It wasn't a question. Rachel Thorne had orchestrated this entire nightmare as revenge. She'd taken Milo to hurt Lucas, to hurt me-knowing exactly what buttons to push.
"We should review the video again when we get back," Lucas suggested, his thumb absently stroking the back of my hand. "There might be something we missed."
I nodded again, no energy left for words. The car slowed as we approached the towering luxury apartment building. 
Lucas and I stepped into the penthouse. The familiar scent of home offered no comfort tonight. Spencer and Drew looked up from the living room, their faces tense with expectation. One glance at our expressions was enough - they didn't bother asking for details.
"Nothing?" Spencer whispered.
I shook my head, feeling the weight of failure pressing down on my shoulders. The crushing disappointment threatened to overwhelm me, but I couldn't allow that. 
Without a word, I made my way to my desk and sank into the chair, immediately pulling up the traffic camera footage. The blue glow of the screen illuminated my face as my fingers flew across the keyboard, searching desperately for any sign of Rachel in the sea of nighttime traffic.
"There are too many blind spots in the traffic surveillance," I muttered, more to myself than anyone else. "Trying to figure out where Rachel disappeared from these fragments is practically impossible."
But I couldn't give up. I wouldn't.
My mind raced with possibilities. "Rachel isn't that familiar with Manhattan's transportation system. She definitely wouldn't know where all the camera blind spots are. It can't be coincidence that she disappeared in one of those gaps. If I look carefully enough, I might find something..."
"Serena."
Lucas's deep voice pulled me from my thoughts. I turned to find him standing beside me, his tall frame casting a shadow across my desk. Despite his composed demeanor, I could see the exhaustion etched into his features - bloodshot eyes, tension in his jaw, the slight furrow of his brow that never seemed to fade these days.
He held out a bowl of soup. "Eat something."
"I'm not hungry," I replied, already turning back to the screen.
His hand touched my shoulder gently. "Eat a little. We don't know how long this will go on, but your health comes first."
###chapter 289
Serena's POV
I reluctantly accepted the bowl, our fingers brushing during the exchange. That's when I noticed the angry red swelling across his knuckles - the aftermath of the confrontation earlier.
"Lucas, you need to take care of your hand," I said, nodding toward the injury.
"It's nothing," he dismissed, his gaze returning to the monitors.
"You said it yourself - health comes first," I reminded him, using his own words against him. His lips curved slightly at that, the closest thing to a smile either of us had managed all day.
I took a spoonful of the warm soup. The liquid soothed my throat, which ached from holding back tears all day. I'd swallowed so much grief, so much fear, it felt like a physical presence lodged in my throat.
As I ate, I couldn't help studying Lucas. The penthouse lights cast shadows across his face, highlighting the sharp lines of his jaw, the determined set of his mouth. Even exhausted, he emanated a quiet strength that steadied me.
"Rachel likes playing these games," I said softly, setting the half-empty bowl aside. "She enjoys torturing us like this."
Lucas's gaze met mine, understanding reflected in his gray eyes. "We'll find her."
Spencer and Drew moved quietly around the penthouse, bringing coffee, making calls, checking other sources for information. 
I nodded and turned back to the screens, determined not to miss a single detail. 
Lucas pulled up a chair beside me, our shoulders touching each other as we both stared at the footage. In this moment, we were completely aligned. If either of us faltered, the other would crumble completely.
I stole another glance at his injured hand resting on the desk. Without thinking, I reached out and gently covered it with my own. His skin was warm despite everything. His fingers intertwined with mine, squeezing gently.

Lucas's POV
The silence in the living room was deafening. I watched as Serena sat at the dining table, her spoon moving mechanically between the bowl and her lips. Her eyes were vacant, staring at something far beyond the walls of my penthouse.
I unwrapped the makeshift bandage from my hand, wincing slightly as the fabric pulled at the dried blood. The gash across my palm was an angry red, swollen and throbbing. 
I had to stay strong, had to believe Milo was okay. My son was resilient, always had been. 
Drew approached from the bar area, his usually carefree face lined with concern. "Let's go have a smoke," he suggested, nodding toward the balcony.
I shook my head, focusing on wrapping fresh gauze around my hand.
"Being wound this tight isn't helping anyone," Drew persisted, his voice low enough not to disturb Serena. "Just one cigarette. It won't delay anything important."
When I didn't respond, he called over his shoulder, "Spencer, come join us for a smoke."
Spencer looked up from his laptop where he'd been monitoring police channels and nodded solemnly. I glanced at Serena, still lost in her mechanical eating ritual, and reluctantly followed my friends outside.
The night air hit my face, cool and indifferent to our suffering. The three of us stood at the railing, the city lights spread before us like stars fallen to earth. I lit my cigarette, feeling the familiar burn in my lungs but none of the usual relief. Drew and Spencer stood on either side of me, their presence a silent support that nearly broke my carefully maintained composure.
"You two should head home," I said finally, exhaling a plume of smoke that disappeared into the darkness. "It's getting late."
"What kind of bullshit is that?" Drew scoffed, flicking ash over the railing. "We're staying right here with you."
Spencer nodded in agreement. "We may not be able to do much, but we're here for whatever you need."
"Lucas," Drew said softly, "we're friends. You don't have to hold everything inside."
I looked at him, at Spencer, and felt a rush of gratitude that threatened to unravel me. I nodded, not trusting myself to speak, and took another drag from my cigarette instead.
When we returned to the living room, I found Serena had fallen asleep at the coffee table, her head pillowed on her arms next to her laptop. Her brow was furrowed even in sleep, her body trembling slightly. I quietly crossed the room, careful not to wake her, and gently draped a cashmere throw over her shoulders.
I stood there for a moment, watching her breathe, feeling a complicated tangle of emotions. As I adjusted the blanket, Serena suddenly jerked awake, her eyes flying open in terror.
"Milo!" she cried out, her voice raw with panic.
"Serena, it's Lucas," I said softly, kneeling beside her. "You were dreaming."
She looked at me with such distress that it physically hurt to meet her gaze. Her eyes filled with tears, and she shook her head desperately.
"No... Milo..." Her voice broke, and she covered her face with her hands, her shoulders shaking with sobs.
I waited, giving her a moment to gather herself. When she finally looked up, her face was pale with horror.
"Lucas," she whispered, "I saw Milo in my dream. He was falling off a cliff... Rachel pushed him... she was smiling as he fell..."
The image she described sent ice through my veins, but I forced myself to remain calm. Serena needed my strength now more than ever.
"That's not going to happen," I said firmly, my voice steadier than I felt. "I won't let anything happen to Milo. I'm going to bring him home safe."
"But what if-"
"No," I cut her off, unwilling to entertain worst-case scenarios. "Listen to me, Serena." I took her hands in mine, my injured palm protesting but I ignored it. "I promise you. I will protect Milo. I will protect you. You're not alone in this."
Her eyes searched mine, desperately seeking reassurance that I wasn't just offering empty words. I pulled her into my arms, holding her against my chest where she could feel the steady beat of my heart.
"Feel that?" I murmured against her hair. "As long as that's beating, I will move heaven and earth to keep both of you safe."
Slowly, I felt some of the tension leave her body as she pressed her ear against my chest. Her breathing gradually synchronized with mine, and the trembling subsided. For the first time in hours, I felt a flicker of hope.
Then my phone rang.
The sudden sound sliced through the quiet like a knife. Serena stiffened in my arms, her fingers digging into my shirt. Time seemed to stop as I reached for my phone, unknown number.

###chapter 290
Lucas's POV
The phone's shrill ring shattered the delicate silence between us. I felt Serena stiffen in my arms, her body suddenly alert like a cat sensing danger. My gut tightened. I knew who it was. Rachel.
My hand trembled slightly as I reached for the phone, though I fought to hide it from Serena. I didn't want her to see how deeply this was affecting me.
"Hello," I answered, my voice deliberately steady despite the thundering of my heart.
"You're so clever, Lucas. You must know it's me." Rachel's voice dripped with smug satisfaction. I could picture her face, that look of vindictive pleasure I'd come to know so well.
"Where's Milo?" I demanded, cutting straight to what mattered most. The weight of Serena's gaze burned into me as she watched, her fingers gripping my arm.
"Sleeping." Rachel's voice was casual, as if discussing the weather. "It's been quite a long day for him. Travel is exhausting for someone so young. He fell asleep almost immediately."
"What have you done to him?" My fingers tightened around the phone until my knuckles turned white. The thought of my son in Rachel's hands made me sick with fear.
"What could I possibly do to him?" she asked, feigning innocence. "I've treated him like my own son since he was born. I've given him everything, poured my heart into raising him. What do you think I would do, Lucas?"
I closed my eyes, trying to control my breathing. "What do you want?" I asked directly, knowing full well she was enjoying every second of my torment.
Her voice changed then, the facade cracking into raw emotion. "What could I possibly want now? I loved you, Lucas. I loved you with everything I had, and you calculated every move against me, against my family. How can you live with yourself? Does your conscience ever trouble you at all?"
"If your family hadn't set me up to take the fall, I wouldn't have gone to such lengths," I replied, feeling Serena's questioning eyes on me. "I was only protecting myself."
"Ha!" Rachel's laugh was brittle. "That might fool a judge, but it won't fool me. I've been by your side for years, Lucas. I know exactly who you are. Wasn't it enough that your security team roughed up my bodyguards today? What more do you want?"
My face hardened, rage building inside me like a gathering storm. In that moment, I wanted to kill her with my bare hands and felt nothing but relief. 
"You did all this because of her, didn't you?" Rachel spat. "You went to these extremes to avoid marrying me, all for Serena Sinclair! You knew that with my family's connections, this scandal would never see the light of day. Even if you took the blame, what real consequences would there be? Nothing would touch you. I hate you for this, Lucas. I hate everything about you!"
My control slipped. "Then take your revenge on me! Tell me where you are, and I'll come to you. Punish me, not my son!"
"This doesn't sound like the cool, calculated Lucas Harrington I know," she mocked. "Losing control so quickly?"
I gritted my teeth, fingers digging into my palm. "What. Do. You. Want?"
"What does someone who has lost everything want?" Rachel asked rhetorically. Her voice turned bitter. "Should I be grateful that I had plans to come to Manhattan before you could destroy my family completely? Otherwise, I'd probably be sitting in prison alongside my brother right now. After all, your evidence didn't provide me with any alibi, did it?"
"Fine, it's all my fault. Your family's downfall is my doing. If you want revenge, take it out on me. Tell me where you are right now, and I'll come immediately. Do whatever you want to me-just leave my son out of this!" I couldn't hide the fury in my voice anymore.
"But I don't want to see you right now, Lucas," she said softly. "Let's play a game instead."
My blood froze. I knew exactly what the Thorne family was capable of. I'd seen firsthand the methods they used to break people. And now she had my son.
"You're so smart, aren't you? Always trying to track me down." Rachel's voice took on a playful edge that terrified me more than her anger. "I'll give you twenty-four hours. It's now 1:02 AM. If you haven't found me by this time tomorrow, I'll send you something from Milo's body. And for every two hours after that, I'll send another piece. How does that sound?"
"Rachel!" I shouted, no longer caring how I appeared to Serena.
"Milo's being such a good boy," she continued, relishing my reaction. "No crying, no fussing. I wonder if he'll cry when I start taking things from him..."
"Enough," I growled, unable to bear another word.
"Everything I'm doing now, Lucas, is because you forced me to!" Her voice rose hysterically. "Now you can experience what it feels like to be tortured by someone you trusted!"
The call ended abruptly. I sat motionless, the phone still pressed to my ear, as if I couldn't believe it was over. 
My knuckles turned white as I gripped the phone, Rachel's voice still ringing in my ears. I could feel the veins in my forehead throbbing, my jaw clenched so tight it ached. The room around me-filled with screens, maps, and exhausted faces-seemed to fade into a dull haze as her threat echoed through my mind.
"What did Rachel say?" Spencer's voice cut through my thoughts, pulling me back to the reality.
I swallowed hard, my throat tight with fear I refused to show. "Rachel gave me twenty-four hours to find her," I managed, feeling my Adam's apple bob painfully against the constraint of my collar. "Otherwise... she'll hurt Milo."
"Twenty-four hours?!" Spencer's eyes widened in disbelief. "That's impossible!"
I took a deep breath, forcing my racing heart to slow. Panic wouldn't help Milo now. "Everyone stay on the video feeds," I instructed, my voice steadier than I felt. "Check every frame, every shadow, every reflection. I'll coordinate with the others."
As Serena pulled away from me and returned to scanning the endless hours of surveillance footage, I reached for my phone again. My fingers trembled slightly as I dialed, betraying the storm of emotions I fought to contain.
"Miles," I said when he answered. "I'm sending you a number. I need you to trace it to its base station location. Immediately."
After ending that call, I issued orders to every contact I had in Manhattan and beyond. "I don't care what it takes," I told them, each word weighted with deadly seriousness. "Turn this city upside down if you have to, but find her."
I returned to the monitors, forcing myself to methodically review the footage at eight times normal speed. My eyes burned from lack of sleep, but I couldn't afford to miss a single detail. Every few minutes, I glanced at Serena, her delicate profile illuminated by the harsh blue light of the computer screen. Even after two sleepless days, her determination never wavered, and something in my chest tightened at the sight of her unwavering strength.
Twelve hours into our deadline, we still had nothing. The burner phone Rachel had called from was routing through virtual numbers, making it nearly impossible to pinpoint her location. I rubbed my eyes, feeling as though someone had poured sand beneath my eyelids.
"Lucas," Drew's voice came from behind me, concern evident in his tone. "Get some sleep, man. You've been at this for over forty-eight hours straight. Your bloodshot eyes aren't helping anyone. Take a break, clear your head. You might see something you're missing."
I shook my head without looking away from the screen. Sleep was a luxury I couldn't afford, not when every second brought Milo closer to danger. My gaze drifted to Serena again, hunched over her keyboard, dark circles shadowing her eyes as she analyzed traffic patterns and possible escape routes.
How can someone so seemingly fragile possess such incredible strength?
By eight that evening, we had just five hours remaining before Rachel's deadline. The room had fallen into a heavy silence, broken only by the clicking of keyboards and occasional murmured updates. I watched as Serena finally stood after hours of immobility, her face suddenly draining of color as she swayed dangerously.
I was across the room in an instant, catching her against my chest before she could fall. "Serena," I said, my voice rough with worry, feeling her slight weight against me. She felt impossibly small in my arms.
She clutched my forearms for just a moment before steadying herself, her eyes focusing with remarkable speed. "I'm fine," she insisted, though the slight tremor in her voice betrayed her exhaustion. "Lucas, I've been analyzing Rachel's potential routes. I think I've identified some patterns in her movements, some blind spots we haven't checked yet."
My heart, which had been a dead weight in my chest for the past forty-three hours, stirred with the first flicker of hope. I held her gaze, seeing the determination burning through her fatigue.
"Show me," I said softly.
###chapter 291 The Search for Milo
Serena's POV
I returned to the computer with more determined steps than before, Lucas following close behind me. The screen displayed Manhattan's complex network of lines, with several areas marked with red circles. The tension in the air was palpable as my heart raced with a mixture of fear and determination.
Drew and Spencer joined us, crowding around the monitor. 
I pulled out my notepad covered with scribbled observations and took a deep breath. "Rachel's trip to Manhattan must have been planned in advance," I said, my voice steadier than I expected. "But she's under strict surveillance by the Thorne family. She couldn't make any obvious moves." I traced my finger along the highlighted routes. "All her actions had to be discreet because her family would never allow this. By doing this, she's burning all her bridges-she doesn't plan on going back alive."
Lucas's gray eyes darkened as he processed my words, his jaw clenched tight.
"Once she gave up everything," I continued, "it means the Thorne family can't forge their alliance with the Kennedy family anymore. I don't think Rachel is as complicated as we're making her out to be. She didn't have much time to prepare thoroughly."
Lucas nodded, his expression grave yet focused. Drew ran his hand through his hair, releasing a heavy sigh while Spencer's eyes narrowed with concentration.
"We've wasted too much time looking for her in surveillance blind spots," I said, feeling a surge of clarity. "Her need for secrecy means she had limited time, limited power. She wouldn't have access to Manhattan's transportation blind spot maps."
I pointed to my hand-drawn diagrams. "Without these resources, she couldn't guarantee she'd reasonably avoid detection." My finger traced the path I'd mapped out. "This is the route I found from surveillance records-from Lumi Nova School to where Rachel's car was last parked. I've marked all the blind spots along the way."
I looked up at their faces, newfound conviction building inside me. "There aren't many blind areas. With Rachel's intelligence and cunning, she wouldn't take unnecessary risks."
Spencer nodded firmly. "If it were me, I wouldn't risk it either."
"Which means," I pronounced each word deliberately, feeling the weight of my revelation, "all of us have been deceived by Rachel. She likely never left the car at all."
My statement changed the atmosphere instantly. Lucas's eyes flashed with tension, while Drew and Spencer looked stunned.
"The video Miles sent us only showed a driver getting out of the car," I explained, my mind racing ahead of my words. "It showed no one else inside. But was the car really empty? What if after the driver left-after deliberately drawing away our attention-that's when they emerged?"
Lucas immediately pulled out his phone, his voice commanding. "Miles, get the surveillance footage from where Rachel's car was parked, especially after the driver left."
The tension mounted again, stretching every second into what felt like hours. If my hunch was correct, Rachel's hideout was right there in the the abandoned warehouse district-she hadn't gone far at all.
Minutes ticked by painfully slowly. When Lucas finally received the video files from Miles, he played them at eight times normal speed, his eyes never leaving the screen.
One hour after the driver left, there was movement in the car. Lucas paused and switched to normal playback speed.
The video showed the car slightly rocking as someone sat up inside, cautiously looking around to confirm the area was deserted before speaking to others in the vehicle. Then Rachel and another bodyguard emerged.
They exited the car, opened the trunk, and lifted out the small, sleeping form of Milo.
At the sight of my little boy's helpless body, tears streamed uncontrollably down my face. I had thought I was strong enough, but seeing him-so small, so vulnerable-nearly shattered me. I bit my lip hard, trying to hold myself together, tasting blood as I fought to contain my breakdown.
"Damn it, how devious!" Drew cursed, his fist clenching in anger.
Lucas didn't waste a moment on emotions. He instructed Miles to send the geographical layout and to track which direction the group had headed after leaving the car.
Half an hour later, we had pinpointed Rachel's likely hideout-an abandoned factory within the warehouse district itself.
"Are we going?" I asked, my voice barely steady as I looked into Lucas's eyes, searching for any hint of hesitation.
Lucas nodded, his expression unreadable in the dim light of his penthouse. "Yes."
My heart hammered against my ribs, but I forced myself to appear calmer than I felt. "Let's eat something first." The words tumbled out as I tried to ground myself in practicality. We still had three and a half hours before our meeting with Rachel Thorne. The drive would only take an hour. We had time.
Within minutes, Drew had arranged for a feast to be delivered from Le Jardin. The spread before us seemed almost surreal-gourmet dishes laid out with precision in the dining room. Under normal circumstances, the aroma would have been mouthwatering, but tonight, it might as well have been cardboard.
"Is this our last supper?" I attempted a joke, but my voice cracked. Drew's eyes immediately reddened, catching me off guard. 
"Don't say stupid things like that," Drew admonished, his voice thick with emotion. I hadn't meant to upset him, but the weight of what we were facing pressed down on all of us.
Tears welled in my eyes before I could stop them. Lucas silently passed me a tissue, his fingers brushing mine in a touch that was both comforting and heart-wrenching. 
"Let's eat," Spencer suggested, clearly trying to ease the unbearable tension that had settled over the table.
We all went through the motions of dining, forks moving mechanically, food remaining largely untasted. The silence was punctuated only by the clink of silverware against fine china.
Drew suddenly spoke, his voice cutting through the quiet. "I used to hate Jace Gillard so much." All eyes turned to him. I watched as he struggled to maintain his composure. Drew had always been sensitive beneath his carefree facade.
"Who was he to just walk away from Eleanor when it suited him?" Drew continued, his voice growing unsteady. "Now, knowing he's in the ICU after that car accident, not even sure if he'll open his eyes again... I suddenly realize how petty all our grand loves and hatreds seem when faced with mortality."
A tear escaped and rolled down his cheek. "I think I could even accept him and Eleanor together, if it meant he'd just live." His words hung in the air as more tears followed.
Spencer reached over, squeezing Drew's shoulder in silent support. I felt my own tears threatening again, understanding all too well how quickly life's priorities could shift when faced with potential loss.
After we'd made our minimal attempts at eating, Drew and Spencer walked us to the door. The hallway felt endless, each step carrying us closer to whatever fate awaited.
"Don't forget you owe Spencer and me a proper dinner," Drew called out, a hint of his usual self peeking through the emotion.
Lucas turned, his face softening for the first time that evening. "I remember. I won't break my promise."
As we walked away, Drew's voice echoed down the corridor after us. "I'll be waiting for you!"
Lucas raised his hand in an "OK" gesture without looking back.
At 10:32 PM, we went to Rachel's stash.
"You should rest," Lucas said, his deep voice gentle in the quiet cabin. "It'll take us an hour and twenty-five minutes to get there."
I nestled against his chest, feeling the steady rhythm of his heartbeat beneath my ear. His arm wrapped around me, drawing me closer, and I breathed in his familiar scent-subtle cologne mingled with something uniquely him. My eyes burned with unshed tears as a thought ambushed me: Could this be the last time I would rest against him like this?
I closed my eyes, not to sleep-sleep seemed impossible-but to memorize every sensation. The warmth of his body, the strength of his arm around me, the rise and fall of his chest with each breath. If this was to be our last night together, I wanted to remember every moment, every touch, every heartbeat.
###chapter 292
Serena's POV
I rested my head against Lucas's chest, his heartbeat strong and steady beneath my ear. Despite my overwhelming exhaustion, sleep refused to claim me. Every time I closed my eyes, bloody images flashed before me-Milo looking so small, so helpless in Rachel's grasp. My body ached with fatigue, but my mind remained cruelly alert, replaying those terrifying moments over and over.
The silence between us was heavy with unspoken words. I couldn't bear to let my thoughts wander in that quiet, couldn't face the memories that lurked in the stillness.
"Lucas," I spoke suddenly, my voice sounding foreign even to my own ears.
"Hmm?" His response rumbled through his chest, vibrating against my cheek.
The question that had been haunting me rose to my lips before I could stop it. "Do you hate me?"
I felt his body tense slightly beneath mine. He paused for a moment, then answered with quiet certainty, "I've never hated you."
"Not even once?" I pressed, needing to understand. "I've pushed you away so many times. Over and over again. You never resented me for it?"
His hand moved to stroke my hair gently. "No. Every time you pushed me away, I was too busy figuring out how to bring you back. I never had time to hate you."
The simplicity of his answer made my throat tighten. How could anyone be so steadfast, so unwavering in their devotion? Especially someone like Lucas Harrington, who could have anyone he wanted with a mere glance.
"Serena," he said softly, his voice taking on a thoughtful tone. "Have I ever told you why I love you so much?"
"You said it was love at first sight," I replied, remembering his words from months ago.
"Yes, but did I tell you when that first sight was?"
I looked up at him, confusion clouding my thoughts. "What do you mean?"
He shook his head slightly. "We met long."
"We did?" I searched my memory, finding nothing.
"Yes. At your mother's funeral."
The words hit me like a physical blow. My mother's funeral. I was only six years old when Helen Sinclair passed away, leaving me alone with a father who would soon remarry and welcome a new daughter into his life-a daughter he would love far more than me.
"How?" I whispered, struggling to process this revelation.
Lucas shifted slightly, his arms tightening around me as if to shield me from the pain of the memory.
"I was there with my grandfather and parents. A business obligation, really. I was just a child myself." His voice took on a distant quality, lost in recollection. "But then I saw you. This tiny girl, kneeling in the great hall, not crying, not making a sound. You were so still, so silent that you seemed barely there at all."
I remembered that day in fragments-the suffocating black dress, the sea of strange adult faces, the overwhelming emptiness where my mother's love had been.
"You were so composed," Lucas continued. "But your eyes... your eyes held such profound sadness that I couldn't look away. I remember tugging on my grandfather's sleeve, asking if we could take you home with us."
A small, broken laugh escaped me at the thought of young Lucas trying to adopt me like a stray kitten.
"What did Howard say to that?"
"He patted my head and told me that you had your own family to take care of you." Lucas's voice hardened slightly. "I didn't understand then what kind of 'care' Lawrence Sinclair would provide."
I closed my eyes, feeling the sting of old wounds. 
"After that day," Lucas went on, "I would hear your name whenever I came back from boarding school. My friends would mention the brilliant Serena Sinclair, and something in me would stir, though I couldn't understand why."
"So when did you realize?" I asked, curiosity momentarily overshadowing my exhaustion.
"I think I knew I liked you when I was twelve," he admitted. "But you were only nine, so I kept it to myself. I was away at school most of the time anyway, and then university abroad. The visits home became less frequent, and Rachel was always there..."
My body tensed involuntarily at the mention of Rachel Thorne.
"So you did have feelings for Rachel?" The question slipped out before I could stop it, betraying an insecurity I hated to acknowledge.
Lucas shook his head firmly. "No. When I turned twenty and saw you again at that rooftop bar downtown, I knew with absolute certainty." His hand tilted my chin up, forcing me to meet his intense gaze. "Rachel was just what was expected-appropriate backgrounds, compatible families. But with you..." His voice dropped lower. "With you, it was something I couldn't control. It was like trying to stop a storm with your bare hands."
The raw emotion in his voice made my heart constrict. Here was a man who had waited for me, fought for me, never given up on me despite my best efforts to push him away.
"I didn't know," I whispered, thinking of all the time we'd wasted, all the pain we might have avoided if I'd known the depth of his feelings sooner.
"You weren't supposed to know," he replied, a hint of his characteristic confidence returning. "I wanted to earn your heart, Serena. Not claim it because of some childhood connection you didn't even remember."
I reached up to touch his face, tracing the strong line of his jaw. "I'm sorry," I whispered, my voice barely audible above the hum of the engine. "For all the misunderstandings I had about you before."
Lucas turned to me, his gray eyes softening in the dim light.
"It doesn't matter," he said, reaching over to take my hand. His touch was warm, steady, anchoring me when everything else felt like it was spinning out of control. "None of it matters now."
He pulled me into his embrace. "Being with you like this is enough," he continued, his deep voice rumbling in his chest against my ear. "I can feel your heart now, Serena. I can feel that it's real, what's between us. That's all I need."
His words sounded too much like a goodbye, and panic clawed at my throat. I reached up and pressed my hand against his lips, silencing him.
"Don't," I pleaded. "Don't talk like you're saying goodbye."
His eyes met mine, steady and resolute. I realized then that his words weren't just meant to distract me from our desperate situation. He was afraid this might be his last chance to tell me how he felt, to express the love he'd carried for years.
"I don't want you going in there with the mindset that you have to die," I said, my voice breaking despite my efforts to stay strong. "That's not how this ends, Lucas."
He gently removed my hand from his mouth, but kept it held tightly in his. "We need to face reality, Serena. I want us to have as few regrets as possible if-"
"No," I cut him off, shaking my head. "No matter what we do, there will be regrets. There always are."
"Rachel won't let Milo go easily," he said, his voice hardening at the mention of her name. "You know that."
Rachel Thorne. The woman who had been a thorn in my side from the beginning, who had tried to take everything from me.
"All I can promise is that as long as I'm alive, Milo will be too," Lucas continued.
###chapter 293
Serena's POV
His words hung in the air between us, heavy with implication. As long as I'm alive. The unspoken alternative made my blood run cold.
"If I die," he said, his voice steady despite the weight of his words, "and by some miracle Milo survives, I want you to take him and Stella and live a good life. That's all I ask."
I shook my head frantically, tears burning behind my eyes. This couldn't be happening. After everything we'd been through, after finally finding each other, I couldn't bear the thought of losing him now.
"We'll all make it," I insisted, though the words sounded hollow even to my own ears. "You, me, Milo, Stella. All of us together."
A sad smile touched his lips. "And if we don't?" he pressed. "If it comes down to it, promise me you'll take care of our children. Promise me you'll live your life. You can even remarry if you want."
He tried to inject a note of humor into his voice. "Just don't bring him to my grave. That would be too much."
His attempt at lightness broke something inside me. The tears I'd been fighting to hold back spilled over, hot tracks down my cheeks that I couldn't stop. 
"Okay," I finally whispered, the single word feeling like it was torn from my soul.
In the deepest part of my heart, I made my own choice. If it came down to it - if only Lucas or Milo could survive - I would choose our son. It was a thought so painful I could barely acknowledge it.
The car slowed as we approached our destination. We stopped about two hundred meters from the building, not wanting to alert Rachel to our presence, but not being overly cautious either.
It was exactly midnight. We had one hour until Rachel's deadline.
Driver turned off the engine, and the sudden silence was deafening. I could feel my heart pounding against my ribcage as Lucas helped me out of the vehicle. Two of his security emerged from a second vehicle, their expressions grim and professional. 
"Stay close to the car," Lucas instructed, his voice gentle. "If anything happens, Ethan will get you to safety immediately." 
He didn't wait for my response before turning toward the factory entrance. 
I watched him take a few steps away, and suddenly, I couldn't bear it. The thought of him walking into danger, of possibly never seeing him again, crashed over me like a tidal wave.
Before I could think twice, I was running after him. My heels sank slightly into the gravel as I closed the distance between us. When I reached him, I wrapped my arms around his waist from behind, pressing my cheek against his back, inhaling his familiar scent of sandalwood and something uniquely him.
"Lucas," I whispered, my voice trembling. "I don't think I've told you yet, but I love you."
I felt him stiffen slightly before relaxing into my embrace. "I know," he said quietly.
"I love you," I repeated, louder this time. "I love you, Lucas Harrington."
Slowly, he turned in my arms until we were face to face. His storm-gray eyes searched mine, and I couldn't stop the tears that welled up and spilled down my cheeks. I'd always prided myself on being strong. Growing up in the Sinclair family had taught me early that showing emotion was a weakness others would exploit. But these past few days had broken something inside me, shattered the walls I'd built around my heart.
"I'm so scared," I confessed, the words barely audible. "I've never felt so helpless. I can't lose you, not after everything we've been through."
The vulnerability in my voice surprised even me. I'd spent years crafting an image of unshakable confidence. But with Lucas, all those layers fell away, leaving me raw and exposed.
He reached up, his thumb gently wiping away a tear from my cheek. "Serena," he murmured, his voice low and intense. "Look at me."
I forced myself to meet his gaze, drowning in the depth of emotion I found there.
Before I could respond, Lucas leaned down and captured my lips with his. I closed my eyes, feeling more tears escape as I surrendered to his kiss. It was gentle at first, almost reverent, but quickly deepened into something more desperate-a kiss that held the weight of everything unsaid between us.
I wrapped my arms around his neck, pressing myself against him as if I could somehow keep him with me through sheer force of will. His arms tightened around my waist, lifting me slightly off the ground. For a moment, the world disappeared-there was no abandoned factory, no waiting danger, no family rivalries or corporate wars. Just Lucas and me, and this kiss that felt like both a promise and a goodbye.
When we finally broke apart, both breathing heavily. 
"Don't cry," he whispered, brushing another tear from my face. "Take care of yourself. Don't make me worry about you too."
He slowly disentangled himself from my embrace, his fingers lingering on mine until the last possible moment. Then he turned and walked away, his stride purposeful, not once looking back.
I reached out, trying to catch him, to hold onto him for just one more second, but my fingers grasped only empty air, the ghost of his touch already fading. Through my tears, his silhouette blurred as he approached the factory entrance, flanked by his security.
###chapter 294
Lucas's POV
The dim lights of the abandoned factory barely illuminated our path as I moved forward with two of my security personnel. My footsteps echoed against the concrete floor, my heart pounding with each step. My face remained impassive, but inside, I was burning with rage. 
As we rounded the corner, I saw her. Rachel Thorne. Sitting on a rusted metal chair, a victorious smile playing on her lips. Her eyes darted behind me, searching, and I could see the disappointment flash across her face when she realized Serena wasn't with me.
"Where is she?" Rachel asked, her voice laced with contempt.
"I came alone," I replied coldly. My eyes quickly scanned the room, assessing the situation. Three armed men positioned strategically around her. Two flanking her sides, weapons visible as a clear threat. And the third-my breath caught when I spotted him standing behind Rachel, guarding my son.
Milo sat on the floor, hands bound behind his back, mouth gagged with a cloth. His eyes widened when he saw me, and he immediately began to struggle against his restraints.
I clenched my fist, fighting back the urge to lunge forward and tear apart anyone who dared touch my child. Instead, I gave Milo a subtle, reassuring look. He understood, his struggles ceasing as his frightened eyes locked with mine.
Rachel noticed our exchange and let out a chuckle that sent chills down my spine.
"To be honest," she said, leaning forward in her chair, "I'd hate to kill little Milo. Such an adorable child-it would be such a waste."
"Rachel," I said, my voice steady despite the fury coursing through me, "this is between us. There's no need to involve innocent people, especially a child. Let him go, and I'm all yours."
Her eyes gleamed with malice. "You hurt me, Lucas. And for that, you need to pay tenfold! Why should I just punish you when I can punish everyone you care about? Milo, Stella, and your precious Serena!"
My expression darkened, a cold mask slipping over my features. "And you think you can actually accomplish that?"
Rachel stood up, her confidence radiating as she gestured around her. "Haven't I already?"
I needed to throw her off-balance. Make her doubt herself and her control over the situation. So I asked a question I knew would shake her to the core.
"Do you really think I can't let go of Milo if I have to?"
The smile faltered on her face. Just as I expected.
"I came here to give myself some hope-to avoid regrets," I continued, my voice chillingly detached. "But that doesn't guarantee a happy ending. For any of us."
My heart was breaking as I spoke these words, knowing my son could hear me. But I had to sound convincing. I had to make Rachel believe I might actually walk away.
"Lucas Harrington," she hissed, her composure cracking, "are you saying you'd abandon your own son?"
I shrugged, maintaining my icy demeanor. "When I have no other choice, I have to let go. You should know by now that I don't respond well to threats."
Rachel's face contorted with rage. "You think I won't do it? I'll kill him right now!"
"I believe you would," I replied evenly, locking eyes with her. "But if you do, you won't leave this place alive either."
"I never planned on surviving this," she spat back.
I allowed a knowing smile to cross my face. "That's where you're wrong. You can't bear the thought of dying before making me suffer tenfold, as you put it. That's what's really keeping you alive, isn't it?"
Her face paled, telling me I'd hit the mark. Her breathing became erratic as she struggled to maintain control of the situation-and herself.
I seized the moment to make my move. "So Rachel, I'll give you one last chance. Release Milo, and I'll stay here with you. We can die together."
Confusion flickered across her face. "You just said you could abandon Milo. Now you're offering to die with me? Which is it?"
"I'm doing this for Serena," I said coldly. "Just to give her some closure."
My words pushed her over the edge. Her eyes blazed with a jealous fury as she screamed, "So Serena means more to you than Milo? More than your own life?!"
I didn't hesitate. Not for a second. "Yes. To me, Serena matters most."
The truth flowed from my lips without restraint, and I watched as Rachel's composure shattered completely. Her carefully applied makeup cracked along with her sanity as she erupted into hysterics.
"Why? What makes her so special?" she screamed, her voice echoing against the metal walls. "What does she have that I don't? I've been by your side for years, Lucas! Years! I've sacrificed my dignity for you. What part of me isn't good enough compared to her?"
I remained perfectly still, my expression betraying nothing while my mind calculated every possible outcome of this dangerous situation. When I finally spoke, my voice was steady.
"Loving someone doesn't require reasons," I said, my tone measured yet firm. "When you can list reasons for loving someone, it isn't love at all."
Rachel's chest heaved with each ragged breath as I continued, "All I can tell you is that in this lifetime, it's Serena or no one for me."
A strange, maniacal laugh bubbled from Rachel's throat. She drew closer, the scent of her expensive perfume mingling with something sharper-desperation.
"You'll never have her," she hissed. "I'll make sure of that. If I can't have you, neither can she."
I looked directly into her eyes. "Your love is selfish, Rachel. It always has been."
"Yes!" she admitted, flinging her arms wide. "I am selfish! I always have been. Everything I've ever wanted, I've taken. And you're no exception!"
The warehouse felt suddenly smaller, the shadows deeper. Every nerve in my body tensed as I realized the full extent of her instability. 
"Then let Milo go," I said firmly, "and I'll die with you."
Rachel's eyes widened momentarily before narrowing with suspicion. She gave a cold, knowing smile that chilled me to the bone.
"You think I'm that easily fooled?" she said with a sneer. "You think a few sweet words will make me trust you and let your precious son go free?"
I stared back at her, my gaze hardening into ice. Every muscle in my body tensed as I fought the urge to grab her by the throat.
"I've been by your side for years, Lucas. I know what you care about and what you don't," she continued, circling me like a predator. "Don't think you can manipulate me that easily. It won't work."
Since gentle persuasion had failed, I decided to change tactics. My fingers curled into tight fists at my sides as I struggled to contain the fury and fear coursing through me.
"Then follow your self-important delusions. Make your choice," I said coldly.
I turned toward the exit, each step carefully measured. My heart hammered against my ribs as I moved away from her, praying my gamble would work. After taking just two steps, I paused deliberately.
"Once I leave this warehouse," I said without turning around, "it means I've given up on Milo. Whatever you choose to do after that, I don't care. But I will call the police immediately."
I heard her panicked intake of breath, followed by her shrill voice. "Lucas! If you dare walk out, Milo will die right before your eyes!"
Every fiber of my being screamed at me to turn back, but I forced myself to keep walking. My exterior remained calm and collected while my soul bled with each step.
"If I stay, the result will be the same," I replied, my voice devoid of emotion. "Better a quick end than prolonged suffering. Milo... I guess we weren't destined to be father and son in this lifetime."
"Lucas, how can you be so cruel?" Rachel screamed in disbelief. "Milo is your flesh and blood!"
I continued toward the door, each step feeling like walking on razor blades. "I can have many children," I said, my words cutting through the air like ice shards. "Serena and I can have many babies together. Eventually, I'll forget about Milo."
Every word I spoke was a knife twisting in my own heart, but I knew this psychological warfare was my only weapon against Rachel's madness.
The sudden crack of a gunshot froze my blood. My body involuntarily stiffened, terror washing over me like a tidal wave-had she hurt Milo? Had my gamble cost my son his life? Despite the crippling fear, I forced myself to continue walking, not allowing her to see how deeply she'd struck me.
As my hand reached for the warehouse door, her desperate voice called out:
"Fine! Come back, and I'll release Milo."
###chapter 295
Rachel's POV
I watched as Lucas hesitated, his confident stride faltering for just a moment. The warehouse's dim lighting cast deep shadows across his features, but couldn't hide the flicker of doubt in his eyes.
"Lucas Harrington, your son is only seven years old. Can you really bear to let him die at my hands?" I desperately tried to irritate him, tightening my grip on the gun.
The words hung heavy in the stale air between us. My heart raced with perverse excitement as I saw his footsteps pause. This momentary hesitation confirmed my suspicions-perhaps the mighty Lucas Harrington would actually abandon his own son.
Deep inside, I had already begun to believe he might truly forsake Milo. I understood Lucas's resolute nature all too well, just as I recognized his obsession with Serena Sinclair. His hesitation now validated everything I had suspected.
To be honest, I never truly comprehended the importance of family bonds. To me, relatives were merely strangers living under the same roof, individuals temporarily united by mutual benefit. My parents, grandfather, brother... what did they really mean to me? When crisis strikes, everyone only thinks about saving themselves.
Just like now-evidence pointed directly to my brother and me, so we were left holding the bag while my grandfather and parents schemed to escape unscathed. That's the reality of family.
So I genuinely believed that when pushed to the limit, Lucas would abandon Milo. Just as he himself had said, he could have many more children with Serena. Eventually, they would forget Milo ever existed.
Yet here I was, gaining nothing from this revenge, instead sacrificing myself in the process.
Lucas turned to face me, and I glared back fiercely.
"Compromising, are we?" I couldn't help but mock him.
Lucas didn't respond to my sarcasm. He simply walked back toward me, one deliberate step at a time.
"Release Milo," he said tersely.
"Fine," I nodded in agreement, but I wasn't about to relinquish my leverage so easily. "You come here first."
"Do you really think I would trust you?" Lucas countered.
My expression darkened, but I understood I needed to show some good faith to lure him completely into my trap. I turned to the bodyguard beside me and commanded, "Untie Milo."
"Yes, ma'am," the bodyguard immediately crouched down and began loosening Milo's restraints.
"Daddy!" Milo called out to his father the moment he was freed, his voice filled with fear and hope.
Lucas merely acknowledged him with a simple sound, showing little emotional reaction.
He turned to me and said, "Let Milo come to me, and I'll exchange places with him."
Hearing this, I couldn't help but smile-a sinister smile. My revenge plan wasn't complete; this was just the beginning.
"Don't be so hasty," I deliberately stalled.
I watched Lucas's expression darken, exactly the effect I wanted.
A new thought flashed through my mind, filling me with anticipation: "I suddenly wonder how Serena Sinclair would choose?"
This would be the most exquisite part. If I could drag Serena into this game too, force her to choose between Lucas and Milo-that would be true revenge. I wanted to see them struggle in agony, forced to face impossible choices. Only then would I feel a measure of comfort, only then could I soothe my heart wounded by Lucas's rejection.
"Rachel!" Lucas's voice turned to ice.
"What's wrong? Does mentioning Serena make you nervous?" I taunted, feeling cruel satisfaction as his face tensed. The hatred in my eyes must have been unmistakable. "I just realized-this whole mess started because of Serena. It wouldn't be fair to let her off so easily. She should witness your death."
"Rachel, don't push me..." Lucas growled through clenched teeth, his voice dangerous.
Then, footsteps echoed behind us.
Lucas whipped his head around sharply, his entire body going rigid as Serena Sinclair walked into the warehouse.
My heart raced with dark excitement. This was perfect-even better than I'd planned. She'd come on her own, saving me the trouble of forcing her here.

Serena's POV
I had barely stepped into the warehouse when Lucas's voice cut through the air like steel.
"Serena, get out!" he commanded, his tone filled with unprecedented urgency and anger.
I froze, knowing my appearance had disrupted whatever plan he had carefully constructed. 
Rachel Thorne immediately seized her advantage, her voice dripping with malice as she threatened: "If you leave, Milo dies immediately!"
"Serena!" Lucas called my name again, his voice heavy with warning.
I looked at Lucas's face, flushed with intense emotion, then at little Milo. The child tried to speak but bit his lip hard, forcing himself to remain silent. His brave expression made my heart shatter into a thousand pieces.
I swallowed back the tears threatening to spill and said to Lucas, "I can't leave. Not now." I couldn't abandon them.
I watched as Lucas's restraint caused veins to bulge at his temple. "Who told you to come in here?!" he demanded.
"I did!" Rachel answered triumphantly. "When you turned away earlier, I messaged her. I told her if she didn't come, both you and Milo would die. It seems she does care about you two, at least a little."
The truth was, I'd been waiting outside the entire time. I knew I shouldn't be here-I should have trusted Lucas completely, trusted that he could rescue Milo on his own. But I wasn't as composed or cool-headed as I wanted to be. When it came to the two people I cared about most, I couldn't just stand by and do nothing. So I had entered, falling right into Rachel's malicious trap.
Standing here now, I could clearly see the concern in Lucas's eyes, the fear in Milo's, and the smug satisfaction in Rachel's. If my presence could somehow save them, I was willing to pay that price.
I walked step by step until I stood before Lucas, whispering, "I'm sorry."
Lucas's Adam's apple bobbed wildly as he struggled to control his emotions. I knew he wasn't angry that I had interrupted his strategy but terrified about what choice I might make. He knew me so well-he must have guessed why Rachel had lured me here.
"Perfect, now everyone's present," Rachel said with a smile. "We can finally settle our debts once and for all." Her smile held such malice that a chill ran down my spine.
I forced myself to remain calm, looking directly at Rachel. "Our conflict has nothing to do with Milo. Let him go first." I had to ensure the child's safety above all else.
"I can release him, but I'll need someone in exchange," Rachel suddenly appeared nonchalant, but I knew this was just the beginning of her next scheme.
"Take me," Lucas said without hesitation.
Rachel smiled enigmatically and asked, "What if I choose Serena instead?"
###chapter 296
Serena's POV
My heart sank, but before I could respond, Lucas cut in with absolute finality: "You don't have that choice." His tone left no room for argument, completely denying me any chance to intervene.
Rachel's expression darkened slightly, clearly not expecting Lucas to be so forceful.
"Rachel, my patience has limits!" Lucas pressed further. "I'll count to three, and if you don't agree, I'm taking Serena and leaving immediately! I mean what I say! One, two..."
"Fine!" Rachel finally relented. She had never been able to force Lucas's hand, especially when he showed his ruthless side.
"Bring him over for the exchange," Rachel ordered.
I watched anxiously as the bodyguard restraining Milo walked him toward Lucas, my heart filled with tension and unease. Two of Rachel's bodyguards raised their guns toward us, while Lucas's security personnel responded in kind, creating a tense standoff.
The atmosphere was charged with imminent danger, and my heartbeat accelerated. I feared something would go wrong during this exchange. I couldn't allow Lucas or Milo to be harmed, even if it meant sacrificing myself. I kept my eyes fixed on everyone's movements, ready to react if necessary.
Rachel's threat hung in the air. "Lucas, if you try anything clever, who dies first is anyone's guess!"
I watched as Lucas's cold gaze swept over Rachel before turning toward Milo, who was being dragged closer by one of the guards. My heart ached seeing the little boy desperately trying to be brave, biting his lip to keep from crying as his eyes locked onto his father's face, pleading silently for rescue.
Finally, they brought Milo directly in front of Lucas. The guard restraining him suddenly shifted, releasing the boy while simultaneously aiming his gun at Lucas's head.
I lunged forward and pulled Milo into my arms. Only when I felt his small body against mine, his heart beating rapidly, did I truly believe he was alive and unharmed. Tears threatened to spill, but I forced them back. This wasn't over yet.
I didn't hold him long, though my heart screamed to never let go. Instead, I leaned close to his ear and whispered urgently, "Don't look back, don't worry about anything. Just run straight out that door and find Miles waiting outside."
Milo looked up at me, hesitation and fear clouding his eyes. I gave him my most reassuring look, trying to convey both my determination and my love. Understanding dawned in his expression, and he turned and ran toward the exit.
Rachel's face darkened, and she opened her mouth to stop him, but I quickly stood up. "Lucas and I are both still here. Isn't that enough?" I knew keeping Milo safe was the priority now.
Rachel watched coldly as Milo disappeared through the factory doors. I suspected she understood that the boy had only been bait to lure Lucas and me here. To her, killing Milo wasn't necessary-we were her true targets.
Only when Milo had completely vanished from sight did I allow myself a small breath of relief. At least he was safe now. That was one of my greatest wishes fulfilled.
I turned to face Rachel directly. "I'm the one you want revenge against, aren't I?"
Rachel's lips curled into a cold smile, and Lucas's expression instantly transformed to one of horror. "Serena!" he shouted, desperation edging his voice.
"Lucas, it's okay. I have no regrets," I said calmly, wanting him to understand my resolve. When I'd come here, I'd already prepared myself to trade my life for Milo's safety. Even if Rachel hadn't messaged me, I would have come anyway, willing to exchange myself for Lucas too.
"Don't say another word! You need to leave, leave right now!" Lucas was frantic now, his eyes filled with panic and fear unlike anything I'd seen from him before.
Facing his distress, I began sharing the story of my life: "For so long, I lived under this weight of sadness. After my mother died, things were never good for me. The Sinclair family treated me terribly. Nina constantly undermined me, ruined my reputation, and then there was Ian, that lying bastard."
I continued, carefully tracing the path of my past: "But now, everything has come full circle. Ian is dead, killed by Nina who claimed to love him so much. The Sinclairs aren't doing so well either. Under Nina's malicious management, the family business is failing more each day."
I revealed a secret then: "I never told you this, but I've been working behind the scenes. I've set things up so that at any moment, I could completely bankrupt the Sinclair family."
"Stop talking, Serena. Please, just leave now!" Lucas was practically begging, his voice breaking.
But I needed to finish, needed him to understand my heart. I looked deeply into his eyes, a small, peaceful smile forming on my lips: "As for Nina, a woman I hated with every fiber of my being, I spent so long thinking about how to destroy her, how to make her suffer the way I did. But that's not necessary anymore-you took care of that for me. Those videos you obtained of her despicable behavior, along with evidence of her collusion with the Thorne family, will ensure she faces legal consequences. Her future is already ruined."
"Everyone who needed to pay has paid. There's not much left for me to accomplish, except to honor my mother's dying wish that I live well."
A sense of release washed over me as I spoke these words, the lightness that comes from finally setting down a burden carried for too long.
"I never imagined that in my unlucky life, I would meet someone like you. That I would have Milo and Stella in my world. For me, that's already more than I ever deserved."
These words came straight from my heart. Meeting Lucas and our children had been the greatest blessing, the brightest light in my darkness.
"So, Lucas, my life has given me enough happiness already. I don't want to leave anything unfinished. I don't want the story of my life to have another empty ###chapter because I lost you."
I gazed deeply into Lucas's eyes, feeling genuinely fortunate for what I'd experienced. I was almost afraid to hope for more, fearful that too much happiness might invite jealousy from fate itself. I felt my eyes growing hot with unshed tears, but my decision was made.
Finally, I turned to Rachel, pronouncing each word with deliberate clarity: "You wanted someone to die with you, didn't you? You wanted revenge against Lucas? I'll die with you. My death will be the greatest revenge against him you could ever achieve."
###chapter 297
Serena's POV
"Are you two putting on some tragic love story for my benefit?" Rachel's voice dripped with venom as she glared at me, her nails digging into Lucas's arm. "It's truly touching. Really."
I met her gaze without flinching. "You have no reason to refuse my offer."
A cold laugh escaped her lips as she shook her head. "If you hadn't come into the picture, Lucas and I would never have reached this point. My family wouldn't have fallen so far!" The pain in her voice was real, raw beneath the hatred.
I took a deliberate step forward, watching how her bodyguards tensed. "Then let Lucas go. Take me instead. I'll die with you."
The words left my lips with a certainty. In that moment, I realized I meant every word. For Lucas Harrington, I would sacrifice everything. The man who had slowly, persistently broken through every wall I'd built around my heart.
Rachel's eyes widened, genuine shock flashing across her face before it was replaced by something darker. "No. That's not what I want."
"Why not?" I challenged, my voice steady despite the fear gnawing at my insides.
"Because," she said, tightening her grip on Lucas, "I want you to watch him die. I want you to live with that guilt for the rest of your miserable life."
I felt a chill run down my spine. I needed to change tactics.
"You overestimate my capacity for loyalty," I said coolly, watching her reaction. "It took me less than a year to get over Ian. Do you really think my faithfulness to any man runs that deep?"
The lie tasted bitter on my tongue. What Lucas and I shared was nothing like the shallow connection I'd had with Ian. Lucas had seen me at my worst, when my own family had turned against me. He'd stood by me when no one else would.
"Ian?" Rachel scoffed, her lip curling in disgust. "How dare you compare that weak man to Lucas Harrington! They're not even in the same league."
I'd struck a nerve.
"You know what?" Rachel continued, her voice growing more unhinged. "I originally planned to rig this place with explosives. We would all go out together in one glorious blaze."
"But I didn't have time," Rachel added, almost regretfully. "I was being watched too closely." She straightened, a smug smile playing at her lips. "Otherwise, none of you would stand a chance against me."
The bodyguards shifted uncomfortably. I could see sweat beading on their foreheads.
I took another step forward. "I'm the one you hate. I'm the one who ruined everything. Killing me would be your ultimate revenge against Lucas."
"Then why are you so eager to trade places with him?" she demanded, suspicion clouding her features.
I swallowed hard, deciding to give her the truth. "Because this situation began with me. I should be the one to face the consequences."
Her eyes narrowed, trying to find the lie in my words, but there was none.
I turned my attention to Lucas, my voice softening despite my best efforts to remain detached. "If I can't change anything in the end, Lucas, don't blame me."
His gray eyes-those eyes that had looked at me with such coldness when we first met, now filled with something so much deeper-held mine. "I don't blame you," he said quietly. "Just stay alive. That's enough for me."
My nose stung with unshed tears. Even now, facing death, his only concern was for me. The weight of his love pressed against my chest, making it hard to breathe.
"Enough!" Rachel shouted, her composure finally cracking. She pointed her gun at Lucas's temple, her hand trembling slightly. "I'm sick of this display!"
I couldn't look away from Lucas. The man who had helped me rebuild my life after Ian's betrayal. The man who had shown me what real love looked like.
And now I might lose him forever.
I felt a tear slide down my cheek, betraying the emotion I'd tried so hard to contain. "Please," I whispered, no longer caring about strategy or pride. "Take me instead."
For a moment, something flickered in Rachel's eyes-perhaps recognition of the genuine desperation in my voice. But then her face hardened once more.
"I said ENOUGH!"





Rachel's POV
I couldn't take it anymore. The way they looked at each other, as if the world around them had disappeared into nothing. Their eyes spoke volumes-filled with love, longing, and silent promises that cut through me like shards of glass. Every second I watched them felt like an eternity of torture.
"Enough!" I screamed, my voice bouncing off the concrete walls of the abandoned factory.
My outburst shattered their intimate moment. Lucas turned to face me, his gray eyes darkening with concern rather than fear. Even now, he looked at me with pity instead of love. That hurt worse than anything else.
For years, I had stood in his shadow. Rachel Thorne-always present, always loyal, always there when he needed someone. I had convinced myself that someday he would see me, truly see me. That one day, he would look at me the way he looked at Serena.
"I know what you're thinking," I spat at Serena, my voice trembling with rage and resentment. "You think you can use reverse psychology to make me let Lucas go? To choose death alongside you?" I let out a bitter laugh that sounded foreign even to my own ears. "I'm telling you, it's impossible!"
My fingers tightened around the small handgun I'd been gripping. My security team stood behind me, their weapons trained on both Lucas and Serena.
"No matter what happens..." My voice dropped to an almost feverish whisper. "I will never let Lucas go. Never. Yes, I will never let him go in this lifetime! Even if it means death, I will have him!"
The words hung in the stale air of the factory. I watched Lucas's expression shift subtly. A fleeting look of relief crossed his features-not for himself. He now understood my true intentions. My obsession was with Lucas alone.
He turned to Serena, who had begun to sob quietly. Her perfect face was streaked with tears, those same tears that somehow made her look even more stupid.
"Serena, don't cry," Lucas said, his voice low and tender. "This is the best outcome."
"Remember what I told you when I arrived? Take care of yourself. Take care of kids. Then, forget about me. Find a man you like and who likes you. Live well."
Each word was a knife in my heart. Even now, facing death, his thoughts were of her happiness, her future. 
"Are you finished?" I asked coldly, my voice barely concealing the storm of emotions inside me.
Lucas lowered his head slightly. "I'm finished."
"Then come with me." I moved to his side, my security guard pressing his gun firmly against Lucas's temple. 
As we began walking toward the back exit, memories flooded my mind. Sweet, painful memories of all the times I'd tried to make him notice me.
"Do you remember when I told you how much I love the ocean?" I asked, my voice taking on an almost dreamlike quality.
Lucas remained silent, his jaw tense.
"You probably don't remember," I continued, a bitter smile playing on my lips. "You only remember your promises to Serena. How could you possibly remember anything I ever said to you?"
We reached the back door, the cool night air hitting my face. It felt cleansing somehow, as if washing away years of pretense and unrequited longing.
"But it doesn't matter anymore," I said, more to myself than to him. "In the end, we'll be together forever, living in the ocean depths!"
I heard hurried footsteps behind us. Serena was following, desperately trying to reach Lucas one last time.
"Don't follow us!" I shrieked, my composure finally breaking completely. The thought of her intruding on our final moments together was unbearable.
I turned to face her, my vision blurred with tears of fury and desperation. "Stop interfering with Lucas and me! You don't deserve him, Serena! Get out of here! GET OUT!"
###chapter 298 The Last Goodbye
Serena's POV 
That final look in Lucas's eyes told me everything I wasn't ready to face.
Don't follow me. Stay back. Let me go.
I stood frozen, my vision blurring as tears spilled uncontrollably down my cheeks. My heart shattered into a million pieces as I watched him walk away with Rachel Thorne.
"This one look... is this all that's left for us?" I whispered, the words catching in my throat.
This couldn't be happening. After everything we'd been through, it couldn't end like this. Not with him sacrificing himself.
I watched helplessly as their silhouettes disappeared through the door at the far end of the factory. The moment they vanished from sight, something inside me snapped. I bolted forward, my heels echoing loudly on the concrete floor as I raced after them.
"Lucas!" I screamed, my voice bouncing off the walls of the empty building.
I reached the metal door they'd exited through and yanked on the handle. It didn't budge. I pulled harder, throwing my weight against it, but it remained firmly locked.
"No, no, no!" I pounded my fists against the cold metal, each impact sending pain shooting up my arms. I didn't care. Physical pain was nothing compared to the agony tearing through my chest.
There had to be another way out. I spun around, scanning the space frantically before racing toward the front entrance. My legs felt like they might give out beneath me, but I pushed forward, driven by pure desperation.
As I burst through the front doors into the cool night air, I spotted Miles and Milo waiting anxiously by the car. The sight of Milo's small figure made my heart clench even tighter. 
"Mommy," he called, his voice small and frightened.
I had to fight every maternal instinct screaming at me to gather him in my arms and never let go. Instead, I forced myself to approach calmly, crouching down to his level despite feeling like I might collapse at any moment.
"Sweetheart," I managed, my voice steadier than I thought possible. "Mommy needs to go find Daddy right now. You need to go with Miles, okay?"
Milo's face crumpled, his eyes widening with fear. "No!" He flung his small arms around my neck, clinging to me with surprising strength. "Don't leave me, Mommy. Please don't go!"
His desperation mirrored my own, and it took everything I had not to break down completely. I gently stroked his dark hair. "I'm going to find your daddy, and I will come back. I promise."
"No!" His grip tightened, his entire body trembling against mine. "Don't go, Mommy. Please don't leave me. Don't leave..."
His plea cut through my defenses like nothing else could. I had to physically pry his small fingers from around my neck, and the act felt like tearing away a piece of my own flesh.
I held his tear-streaked face between my hands, looking directly into those stormy gray eyes. "Milo, listen to me," I whispered, fighting to keep my voice from breaking. "Mommy will come back. I need you to be brave and go with Miles. Can you do that for me?"
His little body shook as he struggled to control his sobs, but there was a flicker of understanding in his eyes. He knew something terrible was happening. He could feel it.
I pressed a kiss to his forehead. "Be good," I murmured, then forced myself to turn away before I lost my resolve completely.
As I straightened up, I gestured to the two security guards waiting nearby. "Come with me," I instructed, my voice shifted. 
Within minutes, we were speeding down the coastal road in a black SUV, the tires eating up the asphalt as we raced against time. I sat forward in my seat, every muscle in my body tense with anticipation and dread.
"Do you see them yet?" I demanded, scanning the road ahead for any sign of Rachel's car.
"No vehicles visible, Ms. Sinclair," replied the guard in the passenger seat, his eyes never leaving the road.
"Is this the only route to the waterfront?" My mind raced through every possibility. 
"According to the GPS, yes. This is the only direct route."
"Drive faster," I ordered, my fingernails digging crescents into my palms. "Whatever the speed limit is, I don't care. Break it."
The engine roared as we accelerated, the landscape outside becoming a blur of darkness punctuated by the occasional streetlight. My heart thundered in my chest, matching pace with the engine's growl.
When we finally caught sight of a sedan parked at the edge of a deserted marina, my breath caught in my throat.
"There!" I pointed, leaning forward as far as my seatbelt would allow. "That has to be them."
The darkness made it impossible to make out clear figures, but movement near the water's edge sent a jolt of panic through me. We were still too far away.
"Hurry!" I urged, though the driver was already pushing the vehicle to its limits.
The moment the SUV screeched to a halt at the marina entrance, I was out the door before the engine even stopped rumbling. My ankle twisted as I landed awkwardly on the uneven ground, sending a sharp pain up my leg, but I barely registered it. I righted myself and sprinted toward the water, my heels sinking into the soft ground with every desperate step.
The sound of a boat engine starting in the distance made my blood run cold. I ran faster, ignoring the burning in my lungs and the stabbing pain in my ankle. The salt air whipped at my face, stinging my eyes already raw from tears.
When I finally reached the edge of the pier, my worst fears materialized before me. A sleek white yacht was already pulling away from the dock, its lights cutting through the darkness as it headed out to sea.
"Lucas!" I screamed his name until my voice gave out, but the only response was the steady purr of the yacht's engine as it carried him farther and farther away from me.
I stood there, alone on the edge of the pier, my body shaking from exertion and grief. The wind tousled my hair and tugged at my clothes as if trying to pull me into the dark waters below. 
I stood frozen at the edge of the darkened pier, my eyes fixed on the yacht that was disappearing into the night. The waves crashed against the dock, spraying cold mist across my face, but I barely felt it. 
"Lucas..." his name escaped my lips as a broken whisper.
My mind raced with horrifying possibilities. What was Rachel doing to him right now? The woman harbored years of twisted obsession and hatred. My heart pounded against my ribs so violently I thought it might break through.
Then it happened.
BOOM!
###chapter 299
Serena's POV
A deafening sound tore through the night. The sound wave hit me with such force I staggered backward. For one surreal moment, it seemed as though a small sun had suddenly risen from the ocean. The yacht erupted into a massive fireball, flames reaching toward the sky, illuminating the churning waves with an orange glow that seemed to mock my horror.
"NO!" The scream ripped from my throat, primal and raw.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This couldn't be real. Lucas couldn't be gone. Not like this.
Without hesitation, without thought, I lunged toward the water. If there was even the slightest chance he had been thrown from the yacht, if he was somehow still alive in those dark waters, I had to reach him. Logic and reason abandoned me completely-all that remained was desperate hope.
"Ms. Sinclair, stop!" Strong hands grabbed me from behind, yanking me back from the edge. I thrashed wildly against my bodyguard's grip.
"Let me go!" I commanded, my voice barely recognizable to my own ears.
"Ms. Sinclair, please. The water's too rough and it's pitch black. You'll only put yourself in danger," he reasoned, his grip unyielding.
"I don't care!" I screamed, clawing at his arms. "Let go of me!"
His voice became firmer. "Mr. Harrington specifically instructed us that in any dangerous situation, your safety comes first. Always."
I fought harder, my body trembling with adrenaline and grief. "I have to save Lucas! I have to try!"
The bodyguard's next words hit me like a physical blow. "Ms. Sinclair... with an explosion that size, there's no way Mr. Harrington could have survived."
"You're wrong!" I choked out, tears streaming down my face. "He's not dead! He can't be!"
But even as I protested, I watched the yacht burning, the flames consuming everything. The reality of what I was witnessing began to sink into my consciousness like poison. I had seen the size of that explosion. I knew what it meant.
"Ms. Sinclair," the bodyguard's voice softened slightly. "Milo and Stella are waiting for you."
Milo.
The mention of their name pierced through my hysteria. Our kids, in all the ways that mattered. The children who were probably sitting up in bed right now, waiting for me to come back.
My struggling ceased as a new, terrible reality dawned on me. They had just lost his father. And if I threw myself into the ocean in a futile rescue attempt, they would lose me too. 
"They're waiting for you," the bodyguard repeated, sensing my hesitation.
I stared at the burning wreckage, tears blurring my vision. The flames were growing smaller now as the yacht sank beneath the waves. I thought of Lucas's last words to me before he'd been taken: "Promise me you'll live, Serena. No matter what happens."
He had known. Somehow, he had anticipated this outcome. That's why he'd made me promise to live.
The responsibility of that promise weighed on me now, anchoring me to the pier when every fiber of my being wanted to dive into those dark waters.
I watched as the last of the flames died out, leaving nothing but darkness where the yacht had been. It felt as though the fire had consumed my heart as well, leaving nothing but an empty, aching void. How was I supposed to go on? How could I face each morning knowing Lucas was gone? How would I explain to Milo and Stella that their father would never come home?
"Ms. Sinclair," the bodyguard prompted again, "we should go back now. Your children needs you."
I wiped the tears from my face with trembling hands. Yes, They needed me. And I needed them-needed something to live for in this sudden, terrible emptiness.
I took one last look at the dark ocean that had become Lucas's grave. The waves continued their relentless rhythm, indifferent to the tragedy they had just witnessed. The night wind whipped around me, carrying the scent of smoke and salt.
"Goodbye, Lucas," I whispered into the darkness. "I'll keep my promise. I'll take care of kids. I'll live... somehow."
I turned away from the water, my body feeling impossibly heavy, as if gravity had suddenly increased. Each step felt like daggers piercing through the soles of my feet, but I forced myself to keep moving.
As I walked toward the waiting car, I didn't look back. I couldn't bear to see that empty horizon again. 
The night air was cold against my tear-stained face. The breeze carried the scent of salt and despair. 
After 50 minutes of driving, I spotted Milo's small silhouette, standing perfectly still under the moonlight. He hadn't cried. He'd just... waited.
"What if I had done it?" The terrible thought crashed through my mind like a violent wave. "What if I had followed Lucas into those depths? What would have happened to Milo and Stella then?"
Guilt and grief collided within me with such force that I felt physically ill. My vision darkened around the edges, and for a moment, I feared I might collapse into the abyss that had opened inside my heart.
I bit my lip hard enough to draw blood, the sharp pain anchoring me to reality. "I still have Milo and Stella," I reminded myself fiercely. "I am not alone. I cannot fall apart."
I forced my leaden feet forward until I reached Milo, then crouched down to meet his eyes. The child had been holding back tears, trying to be brave.
"Milo," I said, my voice cracking as I struggled to form the words. "Daddy... won't be coming back anymore."
He nodded solemnly, his small hand reaching up to touch my cheek, wiping away tears I hadn't even realized were falling.
"It's okay, Mommy," he whispered, his voice so small yet somehow so strong. "I'll take care of you now, just like Daddy did."
Something inside me shattered completely at those words. This child was trying to comfort me. I pulled him into my arms with such force that he let out a small gasp, but then his tiny arms wrapped around my neck, holding me just as tightly.
"I love you so much," I kissed his forehead. "You and Stella are my everything now."
Dawn was breaking over the skyline when Milo and I finally returned home. The soft golden light did nothing to warm the chill that had settled deep in my bones. I felt hollow, emptied of everything except the raw, throbbing pain of loss.
I pushed open the door to find Drew and Spencer slumped on the couch in the living room. They had waited all night, their faces lined with worry even in sleep. Stella was curled up on her bed, a blanket tucked around her small form.
At the sound of our entrance, both men jolted awake. Drew's eyes widened with desperate hope.
"Lucas!" he called out, jumping to his feet.
When he saw only Milo and me standing in the entryway, the hope in his eyes died, replaced by a dawning horror. Spencer rushed over to Milo, scooping him up.
"Are you okay, buddy?" he asked gently. Milo simply shook his head, his small face a mask of quiet grief.
"Where's Lucas?" Drew asked, his voice trembling. "Serena, where is he?"
###chapter 300
Serena's POV
I couldn't bear to look at them. "How is Stella?" I asked, deliberately changing the subject.
Drew's voice was strained. "She's fine. I told her you and Lucas took Milo to handle some business. She seemed to understand something was wrong, but she didn't ask questions."
A brief silence fell before Drew tentatively continued, "Lucas... he didn't come back with you?"
I could only manage a single, broken "No."
The room seemed to freeze. I watched as the reality of what I wasn't saying crashed over them. Drew's body began to shake visibly, and Spencer paled dramatically.
"But..." Drew's voice broke. "He promised... we were supposed to have dinner together, all of us. He promised..."
The pain was etched so clearly on his face that I had to look away. What could I possibly say? That the sea had taken Lucas? That I had watched, helpless, as the man we all loved disappeared beneath the waves? 
"You should go," I said, my voice hollow. "Please, just go. I'm exhausted..."
The dam finally broke. Drew let out a gut-wrenching sob, the sound of pure anguish filling the quiet apartment. Spencer couldn't contain his tears either. They streamed down his face as he clutched Milo closer, as if the child were a last connection to his lost friend.
I stood there, numb and drained, watching their grief unfold before me. In that moment, I felt a strange disconnect, as if I were observing the scene from outside my body. Their pain was raw and immediate; mine was a vast, endless ocean that threatened to drown me from within.
"I need to put Milo to bed," I finally said, taking my son from Spencer's arms. "And I need to be with Stella when she wakes up."
Drew looked up, his face contorted with grief. "Serena, what happened? How did he-"
"Not now," I cut him off, unable to relive those moments so soon. "Please, not now."
As they reluctantly prepared to leave, I cradled Milo close, feeling his exhausted body grow heavy against mine. Soon I would have to tell Stella that her father was never coming home. 
It's been a month since the explosion that took Lucas from me. A month of waking up gasping for air, reaching across empty sheets, and falling asleep to the muffled sounds of Milo's nightmares from the next room.
They never found his body. Or Rachel's. The blast was too powerful, they said. Nothing left but debris and ash scattered across the harbor. The authorities gave up searching after two weeks. Howard had conceded to reality shortly after. And I... I tried to convince myself that acceptance was the only path forward.
Yet some part of me clung to that absence of proof. No body meant no certainty. No certainty meant a sliver of hope that somehow, against all logic and reason, Lucas might have survived. That he might still be out there, finding his way back to us.
I knew better. The rational part of my brain understood the physics of explosions, the fragility of human bodies, the overwhelming evidence. But the heart is rarely rational, especially when it's been torn in two.
"You're sure you don't want anyone to accompany you?" Clara was asking Howard, her voice tight with concern as we stood in the private terminal of the airport.
I watched Howard's profile carefully. The once-imposing patriarch of the Harrington empire looked diminished in his wheelchair, his shoulders hunched beneath the weight of successive tragedies. His silver hair, once meticulously groomed, now hung limp around a face etched with lines of sorrow. In just a few months, he'd buried his son and now faced the prospect of losing his grandson too. Jace was scheduled for high-risk surgery next week, and Howard was traveling overseas to be by his side.
"No," Howard replied, his voice barely audible above the ambient hum of the terminal. "I prefer to travel alone."
Clara pressed her lips together, clearly dissatisfied. "Dad, let me come with you. If Jace doesn't-" She stopped herself, her eyes reddening at the edges. 
"That's precisely why I must go alone," Howard said firmly. "You stay in Manhattan with Maeve. Her career is just taking off, and she needs family around her."
Clara tried again. "Maeve is doing well in the industry now. I could join you for just a few weeks..."
Howard shook his head, more resolute this time. "Let me have my solitude. If anything happens to Jace, I'll call you immediately."
I could see the resignation in Clara's eyes as she stepped back, accepting her father's decision.
I stepped forward, Milo and Stella's small hands clasped tightly in mine. "Maybe Milo and Stella could go with you? Children have a way of brightening even the darkest days."
Howard turned to look at us, his weathered eyes softening as they landed on the twins. He gestured for them to approach, and they moved toward their great-grandfather with the cautious reverence.
He placed one gnarled hand on each of their heads, attempting a smile. "Milo, Stella," he said softly, "your daddy isn't with us anymore. You need to take care of your mother now, understand?"
Milo nodded solemnly, while Stella's lower lip trembled slightly. "We know, Great-grandpa," they replied in unison, their voices small but determined.
Howard looked up at me, his eyes pools of accumulated loss. "They should stay with you, Serena. Lucas always wanted you three to be together. At my age, I'm better off alone with my thoughts."
I wanted to argue, to insist that no one should face such potential heartbreak alone, but I recognized the finality in his tone. This wasn't just about convenience-Howard was preparing himself for the worst, arranging his life to accommodate one more devastating blow.
"It's time to go," he said quietly, signaling to his butler to wheel him toward the waiting jet.
We stood in a solemn line-Clara, Maeve, the twins, and me-watching as Howard was helped onto the plane. None of us spoke as the jet taxied down the runway and ascended into that mockingly perfect blue sky, becoming smaller and smaller until it disappeared completely.
I stared at the empty horizon, thinking about Jace and his surgery. If he didn't survive, I doubted Howard would either. Not physically perhaps, but the essential part of him that might never return from this trip.
Beside me, Clara dabbed at her eyes with an embroidered handkerchief. When she'd composed herself, she turned to me with a question that caught me off guard.
"Would you consider bringing Milo and Stella to live at the Harrington estate with us?" she asked, her voice raw with emotion. "It's just Maeve and me rattling around in that big house now."
I could hear the loneliness in her invitation, could see the genuine affection she had for the twins. The Harrington mansion had once bustled with activity-staff rushing about, family members coming and going, Lucas commanding the space with his quiet authority. Now it stood as a monument to absence, its grandeur hollowed out by grief.
Looking down at Milo and Stella, I gently shook my head. "I'm sorry," I said softly.
Clara nodded in understanding, no offense taken. "The mighty Harrington family," she murmured, more to herself than to me, "reduced to fragments."
###chapter 301
Serena's POV
I held Milo and Stella's small hand tightly as we approached the gray, imposing building. The detention center looked just as cold and unwelcoming as I remembered from my previous visits. 
"Are you okay, Mommy?" Stella looked up at me with those deep gray eyes that reminded me so painfully of Lucas.
I forced a smile, bending down to straighten her jacket collar. "I'm fine, sweetie. We won't be long, I promise."
I hadn't wanted to come. The prosecuting attorney had called multiple times, always with the same message: Nina wanted to see me, saying she would only cooperate with their investigation if I agreed to meet with her. I'd refused repeatedly, determined to keep my distance and protect the new life I was building with Milo.
But they kept calling. And the shadow of the past kept stretching longer.
"Let's finish this," I whispered, as we neared the entrance.
We were about twenty feet from the entrance when the glass doors swung open, and three all-too-familiar figures emerged. My stomach knotted instantly. Lawrence Sinclair-his face like a thundercloud. Behind him, Angela, her expression a practiced mask of concern that never reached her eyes. And trailing them both, my half-brother Oliver Sinclair, looking every bit as entitled and angry as always.
I froze, instinctively pulling Milo and Stella closer to my side. I could have turned around, avoided this confrontation entirely. But something in me refused to retreat.
Lawrence spotted me immediately, his expression darkening further.
"What are you doing here?" he demanded, striding toward me with Angela and Oliver following in his wake.
I straightened my shoulders but said nothing, focusing on keeping my expression neutral. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of seeing me react.
"What's the matter?" he sneered, gesturing toward the building behind him. "Come to enjoy Nina's downfall? To see the spectacle?"
The bitterness in his voice just confirmed everything I already knew about him.
"Nina deserves exactly what she's getting," he continued, his voice rising. "She actually joined forces with the Thorne family to steal control of Sinclair! My own daughter! After everything I did for her!"
Something inside me snapped. "And you think that makes you look good?" I asked coldly. "Your daughter is sitting in a detention center, facing serious charges, and you're out here celebrating her downfall. Father of the year, aren't you?"
Lawrence's face flushed red. "Nina and I severed our relationship long ago. Everyone knows we had a falling out. Her disgrace has nothing to do with me."
I couldn't help the cold laugh that escaped me.
His eyes narrowed dangerously. "I raised two ungrateful daughters-both of you determined to ruin me!"
"Are you sure it's just the two of us?" I challenged, meeting his gaze. "Maybe the problem isn't your daughters. Maybe it's you."
Oliver stepped forward then, his face contorted with rage. "You think I'm like you and Nina? Those pathetic, clingy daddy's girls?" He jabbed a finger toward me. "I'm his son. His only son! You're just daughters-cheap goods meant to be married off. You were never going to carry on the Sinclair name anyway! But me? I'm the Sinclair legacy. My children will bear our name. I am the roots of this family!"
I almost wanted to laugh at his outburst-the perfect distillation of everything wrong with the values my father had instilled in this family. But beneath my contempt, I felt a flicker of pity. Oliver was as much a product of Lawrence's toxic parenting as Nina and I were. The difference was that I'd escaped it.
"Fine," I said simply, too tired to argue further. "Have it your way."
I guided kids past them, heading toward the entrance.
"Serena!" Lawrence's voice stopped me in my tracks. I didn't turn around, but I paused, waiting.
"Go talk to Nina," he commanded, his tone leaving no room for discussion. "Convince her to hand over the Sinclair shares."
I stood frozen, disbelief and rage bubbling beneath my calm exterior. How dare he? After everything that had happened today, he had the audacity to ask me to do his dirty work?
The fury inside me rose like a tide. I might not have any sisterly affection for Nina, but as a human being with dignity, I couldn't accept his callous attitude. What right did he have to demand shares that Nina had sacrificed her self-respect to obtain? And what made him think I would ever help him take them?
"Mr. Sinclair," I said coolly, deliberately using the formal address.
I sensed rather than saw his face darken at my words. I turned slowly to face him, my posture straight and unyielding. "You just announced that Nina has severed all father-daughter ties with you. What gives you the right to demand she surrender her Sinclair shares?!"
Lawrence's eyes narrowed, his jaw clenching as he responded with misplaced conviction. "Those shares belong to me!"
A bitter laugh escaped my lips before I could stop it. "If they were truly yours, they wouldn't be in Nina's possession now, would they?" I took a step closer, my voice dropping to a contemptuous whisper. "At your age, you should know better than to be so shameless!"
The words hit their mark. Lawrence's face contorted with rage, his hand shooting up as he moved to strike me.
I didn't flinch. I'd seen this coming from a mile away. This was the real Lawrence Sinclair-a man who resorted to violence when his authority was challenged.
Before his hand could make contact, two small figures darted between us. Milo stood protectively in front of me, his small body a shield, while Stella grabbed my hand tightly.
"Don't you dare hit my mommy!" Milo shouted, his voice trembling with both fear and determination.
Stella's eyes flashed with a fierceness that belied her tender age. "We won't let you hurt her!"
My heart swelled with a love so powerful. I placed a gentle hand on Milo's shoulder, squeezing reassuringly. "It's okay, sweethearts," I said softly. "He won't hurt Mommy."
And I was right. Lawrence lowered his hand, his face a storm of thwarted rage. He knew better than to create a scene here, in public, with witnesses.
"My greatest regret in life," he snarled, "was raising two ungrateful daughters like you and Nina!"
I met his gaze evenly, unmoved by his declaration. "You'll have even greater regrets coming your way."
Taking Milo and Stella by the hands, I walked past Lawrence, my head held high. As we brushed by him, I paused just long enough to deliver a final warning: "You'll reap what you've sown, Lawrence. That day is coming."
###chapter 302
Serena's POV
I sat rigid in the cold metal chair. The guard had instructed me to wait.
When the door finally opened and Nina shuffled in, I felt nothing. No surge of satisfaction, no pity, not even anger. Just... nothing.
She looked awful. The Nina I knew-the one who sabotaged my engagement, and tried repeatedly to destroy everything I'd built-had always been impeccably put together. This woman before me was a ghost of that person. Her once perfectly styled hair hung limply around a gaunt face. The expensive clothes were gone, replaced by a standard-issue uniform that hung off her frame. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, which still managed to flash with defiance when they met mine.
She sank into the chair across from me, her hands fidgeting on the table between us.
"Why did you want to see me?" I asked, cutting straight to the point. My voice echoed slightly in the sparse room.
Nina's lips curved into something that might have been a smile on anyone else. On her, it looked like a wound.
"Aren't you happy to see me like this, Serena?" she asked, gesturing vaguely at herself. "Isn't this what you've always wanted? Your precious little sister brought low?"
"Yes," I admitted. "I am."
Her laugh was harsh, brittle. "At least you're honest. Always so perfect, so righteous."
"There's nothing righteous about this," I replied. "You earned every bit of this outcome."
Nina's face contorted, her composure cracking. "Why can't I ever beat you? Why?" Her voice rose with each word. "I did everything right! I took all families' love. I nearly destroyed your reputation. I even got your fiancé to leave you! I had the Whitmores and the Sinclairs in my pocket. I even made connections with the Thornes! And still-STILL-I end up here while you sit there in your perfect clothes with your perfect life!"
I let her rant, watching the wild gestures of her hands, the spittle that flew from her mouth as she worked herself into a frenzy.
"I spent my entire life learning how to destroy you," she continued, breathless now. "I studied you, obsessed over you, plotted against you. What do I have to show for it? What did I do wrong? Tell me! What makes you so much better than me?"
I leaned forward slightly, my voice quiet but cutting. "Evil begets evil, Nina. It's that simple."
"Evil?" she practically spat the word. "You're not innocent either! Look at all the people who tried to hurt you-Ian, me, the Thornes-they're all ruined! You destroyed them all!"
I shook my head. "I never set out to hurt anyone. The difference between us is intent. I defended myself. You attacked unprovoked."
She laughed again, the sound unhinged and desperate. "Lucky you, then. Lucky, perfect Serena. Everyone who crosses you ends up destroyed, and somehow you come out smelling like roses."
I sighed and reached for my purse. "If you called me here just to vent your frustrations, I'm leaving. I have actual responsibilities waiting."
"Wait!" The desperation in her voice made me pause. "I need your help."
Now that was unexpected. I raised an eyebrow, waiting.
"Help me with my case," she said, her voice smaller now. "I need a good lawyer."
The audacity was almost impressive. I stared at her, wondering if this was some elaborate joke.
"No," I said simply.
"Please," she pressed on. "I'll give you my StarRiver shares. All of them. Just help me find a good attorney. That woman who represented you last time-Quinn Ashford-I want her."
I shook my head. "I'm not going to help you."
"The shares-"
"I don't want them," I cut her off. "I don't want anything from the Sinclairs. Not a single thing."
"Give them to Lawrence then," she suggested, a hint of her old cunning returning.
I almost laughed at that. "You hate him as much as I do. Why would you give him anything?"
She shrugged, a bitter twist to her mouth. "I'd donate them to charity before I let him have them." Then her eyes narrowed. "Unless... you want revenge against him? Is that it? You can use my shares to destroy him."
"Nina," I said slowly, as if explaining something to a child, "I already control StarRiver. If I wanted to tank the company, I could do it with a few phone calls. Your shares mean nothing to me."
She stared at me, clearly not having anticipated this response.
"If you want my advice," I continued, "cooperate with the investigators. Confess. Show remorse. You might get a lighter sentence."
Her eyes welled with tears. "And then what? I get out in a few years and do what? Everyone will know what I did. I'll be a pariah."
"That's not my problem."
"You know what hurts the most?" she whispered. "I wasted my whole life on hating you. My biggest dream was to see you bowing at my feet, to have Lawrence and everyone at StarRiver acknowledging me as better than you."
I studied her face, seeing for the first time how young she looked beneath the bitterness. "There will always be someone better than you, Nina. That's just life."
"What good does knowing that do me now?" she asked, deflating.
"It's never too late to learn," I replied, standing up. I smoothed my blazer. "You made your choices. Now you face the consequences."
"That's it? You're just leaving?" There was panic in her voice. "After everything, you're just walking away?"
I nodded. "This is the last time I'll visit. Whatever comes next is your journey alone."
As I turned to leave, I heard her take a shuddering breath. "Serena-"
I glanced back, curious despite myself.
But she just shook her head, eyes downcast, whatever she wanted to say dying on her lips.
I walked through the heavy door, the guard locking it behind me with a definitive clang. Outside, the spring air hit my face, fresh and sweet. I took a deep breath, filling my lungs.
Milo and Stella was waiting by the car, their small face lighting up when they saw me. 
"Is the bad lady still in trouble?" Stella asked as I approached.
I knelt down to her level. "Yes, sweetheart. But we don't have to worry about her anymore."
###chapter 303
Serena's POV

In Sinclair's boardroom, I felt the weight of all eyes on me. Three years had transformed me into something I never thought possible - the absolute ruler of Sinclair Group.
To my right, Lawrence's face was twisted into an expression that hovered between disbelief and rage. He looked as though he might collapse from a stroke at any moment. The quarterly reports lay before him, untouched. The dramatic growth numbers meant nothing to him; what mattered was that I sat in the chair he once considered his birthright.
"Any questions about the financial projections for next quarter?" I asked, my voice cool and measured as I flipped through the presentation slides.
The board members shook their heads in unison. Even Lawrence remained silent.
I still couldn't believe how fate had twisted everything in my favor. Three years ago, Nina had been sentenced to seven years in prison, and to everyone's shock, she'd transferred all her shares to me without conditions. I hadn't helped her with her legal defense, but I hadn't refused the shares either. The moment those papers were signed, I held 51% of Sinclair Group, becoming the undisputed chairwoman.
Lawrence had nearly suffered a heart attack when he found out. In his desperate attempt to groom Oliver as his successor, he'd transferred 10% of his shares to his son, leaving himself with only 30%.
The irony wasn't lost on me. Sinclair Group was now merely a side project. My true focus lay with StarRiver Group, which had grown exponentially under my leadership alongside Atticus Thorne. The Sinclair was just a drop in the ocean compared to what I'd built elsewhere.
"If there are no further questions, we'll adjourn until next week," I said, gathering my documents and rising from my seat. No one spoke as I walked out, my heels clicking rhythmically against the marble floor.
Once a week. That's all the time Sinclair Group deserved from me now - just enough to hear the weekly performance reports and make sure my father couldn't sabotage what was rightfully mine.
The sleek black car glided through the busy streets. Miles sat beside me, reviewing my schedule on his tablet.
"Your day is quite packed, Ms. Sinclair," he said, his voice precise and efficient. "The StarRiver board meeting begins in thirty minutes and should conclude by 11:20. At 1:30, you have an interview with Financial Pulse magazine - their editor-in-chief will be conducting it in your office, scheduled for approximately forty minutes."
I nodded, mentally preparing for the questions they'd ask about my meteoric rise in the business world.
"At 3:08 precisely, you're expected at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Celestine at the Luxury Plaza. There will be a live broadcast," Miles continued, his finger sliding down the screen. "And at 6:00 PM, you have a business dinner with the new district director."
My life had become a series of meticulously scheduled events, each minute accounted for and optimized.
"I've cleared your entire schedule for tomorrow as requested," Miles added, looking up from his tablet. "Your flight to Washington leaves at 10 AM. You'll attend the international fashion show at 3:00 PM - Mr. Marlon Wright's debut as lead designer."
I felt a small smile touch my lips at the mention of my mentor.
"Mr. Kennedy has also expressed his wish for you to accompany him to the event," Miles said carefully, his tone shifting slightly.
I turned from the window to meet his eyes. "Lucas has been gone for three years now, Miles."
The moment the words left my mouth, I regretted them. Miles's expression softened with sympathy, and I hated it. I didn't need pity. I'd built an empire from the ashes of my life. I'd transformed grief into ambition and heartbreak into determination.
"I'm sorry, Ms. Sinclair. I didn't mean to-"
"It's fine," I cut him off, turning back to the window. "Send Kennedy a message that I'll be there."
I arrived at my office at StarRiver Group with minutes to spare before my first meeting.
###chapter 304
Serena's POV

I slipped into home at 10 PM, wincing at the soft click of the door. My shoulders relaxed as I stepped out of my heels, feeling the worm wood floor against my tired feet.
"I made it home as early as possible, but still missed their bedtime," I whispered to myself, setting my purse on the entryway table.
Walter had followed my instructions to the letter: the twins were to be in bed by 9 PM sharp, homework finished or not. Their wellbeing came first.
Two years ago, I had moved us from the Tribeca apartment to this villa after Walter joined our household. The twins needed space to grow, to play. Their happiness had become my obsession.
I made my way to the bathroom, eager to wash away the day's exhaustion. The warm water cascaded over my skin, but couldn't wash away the memories that haunted me. After changing into silk pajamas, I headed downstairs for a glass of water to soothe my throat, parched from too much champagne.
On the kitchen counter, I found two handwritten notes propped against matching thermos bottles. A smile tugged at my lips as I read Milo's familiar scrawl:
"Mom, cold water is bad for your tummy after drinking. I made you honey water in the blue thermos. Also warm milk in the silver one to help you sleep. Please don't take those pills again. Love you. - Milo"
Next to it was a delicate drawing of a woman sleeping peacefully under stars, with Stella's neat handwriting beneath:
"The honey has cinnamon too-it helps with headaches. I put lavender in your milk. Sweet dreams, Mommy. ♥ Stella"
My chest tightened with emotion. These children, barely ten years old, taking care of me when it should be the other way around. For three years, they had been my twin flames, warming my frozen heart with their innocent love.
"What would I have done without you both?" I whispered, running my fingers over their notes.
I took a sip of the honey-cinnamon water, feeling its sweetness coat my throat. The thoughtfulness of these children never ceased to amaze me. Milo, already displaying the protective instincts of his father. Stella, observant and nurturing, noticing details most adults would miss.
With the warm milk thermos in hand, I crept upstairs to check on them. I couldn't help myself.
Milo's room was first. The door was ajar, soft blue night-light casting shadows across his sleeping form. His dark hair fell across his forehead. I leaned down to press a gentle kiss to his forehead.
"Sweet dreams, my little protector," I whispered.
Across the hall, Stella's door was decorated with painted butterflies and stars. I pushed it open silently, finding her curled on her side, long lashes fanned against her cheeks. One arm was wrapped around her favorite stuffed rabbit, the other extended as if reaching for something. 
I tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, smiling at how she had arranged her nightstand: a glass of water, a book of poetry, and a framed photo of the four of us at the beach. Always the thoughtful one, my Stella.
"Sleep well, my little dreamer," I whispered, kissing her cheek.
As I returned to my own bedroom, the familiar ache settled in my chest. With each passing day, the twins grew more like Lucas-Milo with his father's stern brow and analytical mind, Stella with his perceptive gaze and hidden warmth. The resemblance was both a comfort and a torture.
Time was supposed to heal all wounds, wasn't it? Then why did my longing for Lucas only deepen with each passing month? Why did I lie awake at night, staring at the ceiling, replaying every moment we shared?
I sipped the warm milk, tasting the subtle lavender Stella had added, hoping it would quiet my mind. But as soon as the lights went out, the memories flooded back-Lucas's intense gray eyes, his rare smile that transformed his entire face, the way his voice dropped to a whisper when we were alone.
"Stop it, Serena," I scolded myself, pulling the covers higher. Sleep evaded me until exhaustion finally won, dragging me under just before dawn.
"Good morning, sunshine!" Stella's voice pulled me from a fitful sleep. She stood at my bedside, already dressed in her school uniform, her hair neatly braided and tied with blue ribbons that matched her eyes.
"Did you sleep better with my milk?" she asked, climbing onto the bed beside me. "I read that lavender helps sad people sleep."
I pulled her into a hug, breathing in the scent of her strawberry shampoo. "I did, sweetheart. Thank you for taking such good care of me."
"Stella, Mom needs to rest." Milo appeared in the doorway, his uniform pristine, backpack already slung over one shoulder. "She had a late night."
"It's okay, I'm up now," I said, sitting up and stretching. The morning was my refuge from midnight longings.
"You should have slept in," Milo said, his brow furrowed in concern.
"And miss seeing my two favorite people before school? Never." I swung my legs over the side of the bed, reaching for my robe.
Downstairs, Walter had prepared a breakfast feast: fresh fruit, yogurt, whole grain toast, and smoothies. The twins had already set the table, including my coffee cup-black, one sugar, just as I liked it.
"Mom, will you be home for dinner tonight?" Stella asked, carefully spreading jam on her toast in perfect little circles.
"I'm afraid not, sweetie. I need to fly to Washington for a meeting. I might be gone until tomorrow, possibly the day after."
"Oh." Stella's face fell momentarily before she forced a brave smile. "That's okay. I'll practice my piano pieces so I can play for you when you get back."
Milo was less expressive but no less disappointed. "Will you call before bedtime?"
"Absolutely. Video call, both of you, 8:30 sharp."
"Promise?" they asked in unison, that twin connection making me smile despite my guilt.
"Cross my heart," I said, making the gesture over my chest. "And I'll try my hardest to be back tomorrow night."
"Don't rush and tire yourself," Milo said seriously. "We want you healthy more than we want you home early."
My heart squeezed at his mature concern. "When did you get so wise, hm?"
"Aunt Clara called yesterday," Stella mentioned casually. "She asked if we could visit the Harrington estate this weekend. She says she misses us."
I tensed slightly but kept my expression neutral. "Did she now? And what did you tell her?"
"I said we'd have to ask you first," Milo answered, watching my reaction carefully. "We haven't been there in months, Mom."
"We'll discuss it when I return," I promised. "Perhaps we can arrange something for next weekend."
Stella brightened immediately. "Really? Can we stay overnight? Aunt said the cherry trees are blossoming in the garden."
"We'll see," I said.
After breakfast, I drived them to school, despite their protests that I should rest.
###chapter 305
Serena's POV
I couldn't remember the last time I'd visited Dr. Chapman. Six months? Maybe longer. The familiar scent of lavender and sandalwood welcomed me as I pushed open the door of the private clinic nestled in a quiet corner of city. The receptionist smiled in recognition as I approached.
"Ms. Sinclair! What a lovely surprise."
I managed a polite nod, my fingers clutching my handbag a little tighter than necessary. My reflection looked tired, despite the flawless makeup I'd applied that morning. Dark circles stubbornly peeked through the concealer beneath my eyes.
"Is he available?" I asked, not bothering with pleasantries. Sleep had evaded me for weeks now, and I was too exhausted for social niceties.
"Let me check," she said, reaching for the phone. A quick conversation later, she beamed at me. "You're in luck! He just had a cancellation."
Minutes later, I heard his warm, familiar voice.
"Serena." Dr. James Chapman greeted me with genuine enthusiasm, his kind eyes crinkling at the corners. "What brings you here after all this time?"
I met his gaze briefly before looking away. "Insomnia. It's bad."
James ushered me into his office with a gentle hand on my shoulder. The room hadn't changed: soft lighting, plush furniture in muted tones, tasteful abstract art on the walls. Everything designed to soothe troubled minds.
He guided me to the chaise lounge where I'd spent countless hours over the years, unraveling the tangled threads of my past. As I settled onto the soft leather, he draped a cashmere throw over my legs.
"Comfortable?" he asked, moving to the small kitchenette in the corner.
I nodded, sinking deeper into the cushions. The familiar scent of the room-books, leather, and a hint of cinnamon-brought a strange comfort.
James busied himself preparing tea, the soft clink of porcelain filling the silence between us. "Work stress too much lately?" he asked casually, his back to me.
"That's just it," I sighed, staring up at the ceiling. "There's hardly any pressure at all. StarRiver is running smoothly for once. The board is satisfied. Everything is... fine."
"And that's why you can't sleep?" He turned, eyebrow raised, holding two steaming cups of tea.
I accepted mine, watching the amber liquid swirl. "Exactly."
James settled into his leather chair across from me, studying my face with the practiced eye of someone who had known me for years. "You're thinking about Lucas again, aren't you?"
The sound of his name sent a physical ache through my chest. I took a sip of tea to hide my reaction, but James had already seen it. He always did.
"I can't sleep," I admitted quietly. "Every night, the same thing."
"Tell me about it," he encouraged.
I closed my eyes, allowing myself to feel the full weight of my grief. "I lie awake for hours. When I do manage to fall asleep, I dream of him, and then I wake up reaching for someone who isn't there." My voice cracked slightly. "It's been three years, James. Shouldn't it be getting easier?"
James leaned forward, his expression gentle but serious. "Serena, we need to address something important. Lucas is gone. You know that, right?"
I opened my eyes, meeting his concerned gaze. "I know he's dead." The words felt like glass in my throat. "I've never deluded myself into thinking he's still alive. I don't dare hope for that. The disappointment when reality hits would destroy me completely."
James nodded, rising to light one of his aromatherapy candles. The soft scent of jasmine filled the air. "But you still can't let him go."
"I can't," I whispered, closing my eyes again. "When everything is quiet, when I'm alone with my thoughts, he's all I see. Even now, with my eyes closed, I see his face so clearly." I could picture Lucas perfectly-his intense gray eyes, the way one corner of his mouth would lift slightly when he was amused, how his powerful presence would fill a room.
James returned to his seat. "How severely is this affecting your daily life?"
"Completely," I admitted. "I can't sleep, I barely eat, nothing interests me anymore. I go through the motions at work, but inside I'm..." I trailed off, not knowing how to describe the hollow feeling that had become my constant companion.
"Do you remember what I suggested last time you were here?" James asked.
I nodded reluctantly. "You said I should start dating again."
"And why haven't you?"
I stared into my teacup, avoiding his eyes. "It feels wrong."
"Wrong how?"
"Like I'm betraying him," I whispered.
James' voice softened. "Do you feel guilty? Like you're being unfaithful to Lucas?"
I nodded, feeling the sting of tears behind my eyelids.
"My dear, you still haven't fully accepted that Lucas is gone," James said gently. "He's no longer in this world. Whatever you do, he won't know about it, and he wouldn't mind even if he could know."
A tear escaped despite my efforts to contain it. "That's not it," I said. "I'm afraid..."
"Afraid of what?"
"Afraid of forgetting him," I admitted, the truth finally surfacing. "Afraid that if I let someone else in, his memory will fade. The sound of his voice, the feel of his touch..." My voice broke. "I can't lose those too."
James was quiet for a moment, respecting my grief. Then he asked, "What would Lucas want for you, Serena?"
The question hit me hard. I knew the answer, of course. Lucas had always wanted my happiness above all else.
"I'm tired," I said finally, avoiding the question. "I'd like to sleep for a while, if that's okay."
James nodded, understanding my need to retreat. "Of course. Rest as long as you need."
I turned onto my side, pulling the soft throw closer around me. The gentle scent of the candle and the comforting presence of someone watching over me worked their magic. For the first time in weeks, I slipped into a dreamless sleep.
When I woke, sunshine was streaming through the partially closed blinds. James was at his desk, working quietly on his laptop. He looked up when he heard me stir.
"Sleep well?" he asked.
I stretched, feeling slightly more rested than I had in a long time. "Not bad."
Glancing at the antique clock on the wall, I was surprised to see it was already past noon. I'd slept for nearly three hours. Standing up, I smoothed my wrinkled clothes and reached for my handbag.
"I should go," I said.
James walked me to the door. "Think about what I suggested, Serena. It's time."
"Mmm," I murmured noncommittally, not meeting his eyes.
Once inside my car, I checked my phone: five missed calls from Miles. I dialed his number.
"I'm heading to the airport," I told him without preamble. "Bring my luggage over."
"Right away, Ms. Sinclair," he replied efficiently. "Anything else you need?"
"No, that's all. Thank you."
After hanging up, I gazed out the car window. The city felt suffocating suddenly-too many memories, too many ghosts.
"Start dating again," I whispered to myself, repeating James's advice. The thought made my stomach clench with anxiety. How could I possibly open myself up to that kind of pain again? After Lucas, after everything we'd been through together, how could anyone else ever compare?
###chapter 306
Serena's POV
I stepped off the private jet at the Washington airport, the crisp air caressing my face as I descended the stairs.
Benjamin Kennedy was already waiting for me beside a sleek black sedan, his tall frame leaning casually against the car door. His eyes found mine immediately, that familiar intensity making something tighten in my chest. I pushed the feeling away, maintaining the cool facade.
"You're late," he said, opening the door for me with practiced ease.
"Only by ten minutes," I replied, sliding into the backseat without meeting his gaze.
He settled in beside me, closer than necessary, his cologne filling the small space between us. The driver pulled away from the curb, and I turned my attention to the window, watching the city blur past us.
"When are you planning to head back?" Kennedy asked, his deep voice breaking the silence.
I turned toward him, one eyebrow raised. "That depends on your schedule here. I said I'd leave after seeing the exhibition. Will you agree to that?"
His expression didn't change, but something flickered in his eyes. "No."
I suppressed an eye roll, the frustration bubbling beneath my controlled exterior. Why even ask then? My inner voice screamed in annoyance. 
"What about dinner tonight?" he continued, unbothered by my silence. "Will you be joining Marlon or me?"
"I already made plans with Marlon," I replied, scrolling through my phone to avoid his gaze. I knew what was coming next.
"I'll join you both."
I looked up then, meeting his stare directly. "Kennedy, have you forgotten that your wife is still recovering from childbirth? Shouldn't you be home taking care of her and your newborn baby?"
His jaw tightened, and I knew I'd hit a nerve. He needed the reminder. Kennedy didn't respond, and silence settled over us for the remainder of the drive.
The venue was already packed when we arrived, the cream of fashion world mingling with politicians and celebrities. 
"I need to go backstage to see Marlon before the show starts," I told Kennedy as we entered.
He nodded, still distant after our exchange in the car. "I'll find our seats."
A staff member with a headset and clipboard approached me. "Ms. Sinclair? If you'd like to see Mr. Wright before the show, I can take you backstage now."
"Thank you," I replied, following her through the crowd.
We weaved between groups of people, many of whom whispered as I passed. The backstage area was a controlled chaos of models, makeup artists, and designers rushing to make final adjustments. The familiar energy brought an unexpected wave of nostalgia. 
That's when I saw him.
A tall figure moved purposefully through the crowd, his broad shoulders and distinctive profile unmistakable even from behind. My heart stopped. My entire body froze mid-step, as though my soul had suddenly departed from my physical form.
Lucas Harrington.
Here.
In Washington.
The world around me blurred, sounds becoming distant and muffled as if I were underwater. I felt a tear slide down my cheek before I even realized I was crying.
My legs moved before my brain could process what was happening. I pushed past assistants and models, stumbling slightly in my haste, my composure completely shattered. Three years of carefully constructed walls crumbled in an instant at the mere sight of his silhouette.
"Excuse me," I mumbled as I brushed past someone, my eyes never leaving his retreating form.
I couldn't tear my eyes away from that retreating figure. My heart hammered against my ribs as I pushed through the crowded backstage area. The chaos of the fashion show faded into background noise. All I could see was him.
Or at least, I thought it was him.
"Serena!"
The voice behind me barely penetrated my consciousness. I kept moving, afraid that if I looked away for even a second, the apparition would vanish into thin air.
"Serena!" The voice grew more insistent. A hand gripped my arm, yanking me backward with enough force that I nearly lost my balance.
"Let go of me!" I shouted, whirling around to face my captor. My composure shattered in an instant.
Atticus Thorne stared back at me, his eyes wide with shock. His hand immediately released my arm as if burned.
"What's wrong with you?" he asked, genuine concern flashing across his features.
I spun back around, frantically scanning the crowd. But it was too late. The tall figure I'd been pursuing had disappeared among the sea of bodies.
My shoulders sagged slightly, though I fought to keep my posture rigid. Had I imagined it all? Was my mind playing cruel tricks on me again?
"What are you looking for?" Atticus asked, stepping beside me. "Who are you trying to find?"
I bit my lip, tasting the waxy residue of lipstick. Three years. Three long years since Lucas Harrington had supposedly died in that accident. Three years of rebuilding my life piece by painful piece. 
And one glimpse-maybe not even real-had reduced me to this trembling, desperate woman.
"Nothing," I replied, my voice unnaturally flat. "It's nothing."
Atticus studied my face with the intensity of someone who had known me long enough to spot the cracks in my armor. 
"You don't chase after 'nothing' like a woman possessed," Atticus observed quietly. "I've never seen you lose control like that."
I inhaled deeply, gathering the scattered remnants of my composure. "I thought I saw someone I knew. I was mistaken. End of story."
My tone brooked no further discussion. I straightened my dress and brushed an imaginary speck of dust, physical actions that helped me recenter myself.
"What are you doing here anyway?" I asked, shifting the focus to him.
Atticus smiled, that practiced politician's smile. "Marlon invited me too. I'm something of a fashion insider these days."
I raised an eyebrow skeptically. In all the time I'd known him, Atticus had been firmly entrenched in politics. The idea of him as any kind of fashion figure seemed absurd. "Since when?"
"I'm your business partner, aren't I? You're in fashion, which makes me half in fashion by association." His smile widened, clearly pleased with his own logic.
I sighed. "...You win this round."
My mind drifted back to the Rachel Thorne's family spectacular fall from grace three years ago. The entire dynasty had crumbled overnight when Lucas exposed their backroom dealings. Garrett Thorne and his parents had received lengthy prison sentences-thirty, twenty, and eighteen years respectively. The authorities never pursued Clarence legally, instead shipping him overseas to "retire" while confiscating the Thorne Group's assets.
The family business had fallen to Silas Thorne, who'd formed an unlikely alliance with me. Together, we'd saved what remained of their empire. After three years of careful rebuilding, the Thorne family had maintained their position as one of the four most powerful families in USA, with Atticus as their sole heir making waves in political circles.
So to hear him describe himself as a fashion insider was jarring, to say the least.
Atticus extended his hand, offering me an elegant bouquet. "These are for you."
###chapter 307
Serena's POV
I barely glanced at the flowers, my eyes returning to his face with clear disinterest.
"You don't like them?" he asked, disappointment evident in his voice.
"What I don't like is you," I replied bluntly. "And you know that."
Pain flashed across his features. "Serena, must you always break my heart like this?"
I suppressed the urge to roll my eyes. Atticus's pursuit of me had been one of the most confusing developments of the past year. In my memory, he had always preferred men. Yet here he was, pursuing me at every opportunity.
I'd initially suspected his motives were purely political-a gay man seeking a wife to appear "normal" for his conservative constituents. When I confronted him and firmly stated I wouldn't agree to a loveless, sexless marriage arrangement, he'd insisted his feelings for me were genuine. He claimed to be bisexual, attributing his previous exclusive interest in men to some vague "incident" in his past.
That explanation had only made me more suspicious of his intentions. The whole situation felt wrong, like a poorly written play where the actors were reciting lines that didn't match their characters.
"If you're worried about me breaking your heart," I said coolly, "then stop putting your heart in my path." I stepped around him, turning to a nearby staff member. "Excuse me, could you please take me to Mr. Wright?"
The young woman nodded immediately. "This way, Ms. Sinclair."
Atticus moved to follow, but I stopped him with a sharp glance. "Don't follow me. Marlon doesn't like dealing with outsiders."
He froze, looking down at the rejected roses in his hand. 
The assistant led me through the labyrinth of the venue to Marlon's private room. He was surrounded by his team, giving rapid-fire instructions while scrolling through his tablet.
"Serena!" he exclaimed when he spotted me, setting the device down. "Perfect timing. I've got exactly three minutes for you."
I smiled. Marlon Wright was one of the few people in this industry whose directness matched my own. "I won't waste them, then. I just wanted to confirm our dinner plans."
"Eight o'clock, my place. I'm cooking." He winked. "Now tell me what you really came for."
"That was genuinely it," I laughed. "I know how busy you are today."
He studied me for a moment, then nodded. "Eight sharp. Don't be late, and bring that wine I like."
I departed with a promise to be punctual, feeling lighter after the brief interaction with someone who didn't demand emotional labor from me.
As I exited his room, I nearly collided with Drew Yeager, with that permanent hint of amusement in his eyes.
"Let me guess, searching for Marlon?" he asked.
"Already found him," I replied. "What brings you backstage? Looking for him too?"
"No," he said, glancing toward one of the other rooms. "I'm here with Maeve."
"Maeve Harrington?" I clarified, though I already knew the answer.
He nodded, a subtle smile playing at his lips.
I had followed Maeve's career since she entered the entertainment industry. Her rapid rise wasn't surprising-not with the Harrington name backing her-but she did possess genuine talent that set her apart from other privileged newcomers.
I watched as Maeve finished adjusting her dress, her fingers deftly smoothing down invisible wrinkles before turning to me with a bright smile. Her makeup was flawless, highlighting her delicate features in a way that would surely captivate the audience during the upcoming fashion show.
"Serena! It's so good to see you," she exclaimed, approaching me with open arms. "I've missed you!"
Her enthusiasm washed over me like a wave I wasn't ready to receive. I returned her smile with a practiced one of my own, maintaining the polite distance I'd established since Eleanor disappeared from our lives. Three years had passed since I'd last seen Eleanor-wondering where she'd gone and why she'd never reached out to me or Quinn after vanishing so suddenly.
"You look great, Maeve," I said, my voice carrying just enough warmth to be polite. "The show's going to be amazing."
Maeve's eyes lit up. "Mom was just saying the other day that you should bring Milo and Stella over for dinner soon. It's been too long since we've all gotten together."
I nodded noncommittally. "When I get back to Manhattan, if I have time." The excuse sounded hollow even to my own ears, but Maeve didn't seem to notice.
"Are kids with you today?" she asked, eyes scanning the room as if expecting to spot my children hiding somewhere among the racks of designer clothes.
"No, they have school," I replied. "I couldn't pull them out for this."
"Oh, right! Of course." Maeve laughed lightly, touching her forehead. "I completely forgot about that."
I seized the opportunity to end our awkward conversation. "I should head out and find my seat. Don't want to distract you before your big moment."
"Of course! I should finish getting ready anyway. The coordinator's been giving me the evil eye for chatting," she said with a conspiratorial wink.
Just as I turned to leave, Drew appeared at my side.
"I'll escort the lovely lady out," he announced with a dramatic bow that made Maeve giggle. "We'll be cheering for you from the front row, Maeve."
Once we were safely in the corridor, away from the backstage chaos, I let out a breath. "Any word from Eleanor?" I asked Drew, the question escaping before I could stop myself.
Drew paused mid-step, his usually carefree expression faltering for just a moment. He shook his head. "Nothing. Haven't heard from her since... you know." He hesitated before adding, "You could ask Jace, maybe? They were close."
"Jace is back in the country?" I hadn't expected that news.
"Yeah, he had that brain surgery three years ago, remember? It was successful, thank God. He spent about six months recovering abroad, but he's been back for a while now." Drew's voice softened. "He and I actually patched things up. Lucas brought us together, and... well, you lose one brother, you really do lose one, you know?"
I nodded, understanding the sentiment all too well. "I'm glad you worked things out," I said sincerely. "And I was just curious about Eleanor. If she wanted to contact us, she wouldn't be hiding from us anymore."
The weight of those words settled between us as we entered the main exhibition hall. The space had been transformed into a runway venue, with rows of white chairs arranged on either side of a gleaming white pathway. Lights hung from above, currently dimmed in preparation for the show.
Drew squeezed my shoulder gently before we parted ways to find our assigned seats. Mine was dead center in the front row-courtesy of Marlon's obvious favoritism toward me. I couldn't help but smile at his transparent attempt to highlight my presence at the event.
Kennedy was already seated beside my place, having arrived with me earlier. What surprised me was finding Atticus Thorne on my other side, clutching an elaborate bouquet of white roses and peonies that looked absurdly out of place in his large hands.
I slid into my seat, purposely avoiding Atticus's eager gaze. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see him straighten up, the flowers rustling as he adjusted his grip.
"Please take these," he said, thrusting the bouquet toward me with an awkward movement that nearly knocked my program from my lap.
"No, thank you," I replied without looking at him, my tone leaving no room for negotiation.
"Come on, Serena," he persisted, lowering his voice. "Do you know how ridiculous I look carrying flowers around? People are staring."
I finally turned to face him, my expression deliberately neutral. "Then throw them away."
"I can't do that," he protested, genuine distress crossing his features. "I wrapped them myself. It took me forever."
"Then I suggest you continue holding them," I replied coldly, turning my attention back to the still-empty runway.
Atticus leaned closer, his cologne-too strong and too woody-invading my personal space. "Serena, I just wanted to-"
"Would you like to switch seats?" Kennedy's calm voice cut through Atticus's plea like a knife through butter.
"Yes," I answered immediately, already shifting to stand.
Kennedy and I exchanged places efficiently, leaving Atticus staring at Kennedy's impassive profile with undisguised frustration. I settled into my new seat, relief washing over me as Kennedy served as a human barrier between Atticus and myself.
From my new vantage point, I could see Atticus's jaw working, his grip on the flowers tightening until the delicate paper wrapping crinkled audibly. 
"Watch the show and be quiet," Kennedy told him, his voice low but carrying a steel edge that brooked no argument.
Atticus's brow furrowed in genuine confusion. "What did I ever do to you?" he muttered, but Kennedy merely crossed his legs and focused straight ahead, effectively ending the conversation.
The lights dimmed around me, casting the audience into darkness as the runway illuminated with a brilliant white glow. 
I shifted in my seat, smoothing down my navy blue dress. The fabric felt cool beneath my fingertips, grounding me to the present moment. 
The first model emerged, her steps precise and confident as she glided down the runway. Marlon Wright's designs were breathtaking - architectural silhouettes with unexpected fluidity, exactly what the StarRiver Group needed for our upcoming campaign. I made mental notes, focusing intently on each piece, refusing to let my attention wander to who might be watching me from across the room.
Marlon Wright, as a world-renowned designer, has never disappointed with his creations. The models were all world-class.
Maeve Harrington blending in among them wasn't particularly outstanding. But as she was a top celebrity from NewYork, her appearance at such an event naturally attracted many media reporters.
The moment Maeve stepped out, there was a slight stir in the crowd.
At that moment, Jace appeared and took a seat next to Drew.
###chapter 308
Jace's POV
I rushed through the entrance of the exhibition hall, slightly out of breath as I navigated through the sea of perfectly dressed attendees. The show had already begun-soft, pulsing music filled the air as models gracefully glided down the illuminated runway. My eyes quickly scanned the room until I spotted Drew's familiar silhouette.
Slipping into the empty seat beside him, I tried to catch my breath.
"Why so late?" Drew asked, his hand steadying my elbow as I settled in. His eyes searched my face with concern.
"Flight delay. Traffic was a nightmare," I exhaled, straightening my jacket. The simple explanation masked the chaos of my day-a delayed flight from Manhattan, a driver who seemed determined to hit every red light, and the constant stream of messages from my production team.
Drew leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Perfect timing. Maeve is about to walk."
I nodded, my attention immediately drawn to the runway.
"So, Maeve mentioned you're filming her movie next month?" Drew's questioned.
"Yeah," I responded, keeping my voice low. "We start shooting next month. Probably a one to two-month schedule, mostly in Manhattan."
"That's good," Drew nodded approvingly.
I rarely attended these fashion shows despite my work in the film industry. But when Marlon Wright had extended the invitation after I'd shot a commercial for him that had exceeded his expectations, I couldn't refuse. It wasn't in my nature to decline such gestures, even when my schedule barely allowed for it.
Drew shifted in his seat, his eyes scanning the front row. "I ran into Serena earlier, backstage. She's sitting in the front row, watching the show."
My gaze immediately found her, her posture perfect as she sat attentively in the front row, her eyes fixed on the models. Even from this distance, I could see the intensity of her focus.
It struck me then that in the three years since Lucas's death, Serena and I had barely crossed paths. The realization left a hollow feeling in my chest. His absence still felt like an open wound. I had been abroad, recovering from my own health issues, when I received the news of his passing. 
I had reached out to Serena once after coming back, but our conversation had been stilted, both of us carefully avoiding any mention of Lucas. The shared grief had created a strange distance between us, rather than bringing us closer.
"Serena was asking about Eleanor earlier," Drew said suddenly, pulling me from my memories.
My heart skipped. Eleanor Yates. A name I hadn't heard in conversation for so long.
"Has Eleanor contacted you?" Drew asked, his eyes studying my reaction.
"No," I said simply, hoping the single word would end the conversation.
Drew wasn't deterred. "And you haven't reached out to her either?"
I pressed my lips together, choosing my words carefully. "She must have her own life now."
Drew's face flushed with emotion. "Eleanor sacrificed everything for you back then-"
"Could you please keep it down?" someone behind us whispered sharply.
Drew swallowed whatever he had been about to say, his jaw tightening. I said nothing, grateful for the interruption. What could I say about Eleanor that wouldn't sound hollow or insufficient? That I still thought of her? That I wondered if she was happy? That I sometimes woke in the middle of the night, reaching for someone who wasn't there?



Serena's POV
The lights dimmed across the venue, leaving only the brilliant illumination of the runway. I shifted slightly in my front-row seat, smoothing the fabric of my dress as I prepared for the next collection. The murmur of conversations around me faded as music pulsed through the speakers.
Then he appeared.
A tall figure stepped onto the runway, moving with a confidence that instantly commanded the room. My breath caught in my throat. Something about the way he moved-the slight tilt of his head, the rhythm of his stride-sent a jolt of recognition through my body before my mind could process why.
"Oh my god, look at him," whispered the woman beside me, her voice tinged with admiration.
All around me, I could hear similar whispers of appreciation rippling through the audience. Women leaned forward in their seats, eyes fixed on the model as he made his way down the runway with practiced grace.
"Speaking from a man's perspective, I have to admit that guy's pretty damn good-looking." Atticus praised.
But I barely heard him. My eyes were locked on the model's profile, then his back as he turned. The broad shoulders. The way he held his head. The familiar stance that had haunted my dreams for years.
Lucas.
My hand began to tremble. I gripped the edge of my seat, my knuckles turning white as I fought the overwhelming urge to stand up, to shout his name across the crowded venue. My heart hammered against my ribcage so violently I was certain everyone could hear it.
"Serena?" Benjamin Kennedy gripped my arm, his voice low but firm. "It's not him."
I couldn't tear my eyes away. The model turned again, and for a moment-just a heartbeat-I could have sworn he looked directly at me. In that instant, I was transported back to that terrible day. The last time I'd seen Lucas. His figure disappearing with Rachel Thorne, their silhouettes growing smaller against the horizon until they vanished completely. The explosion that followed. The way my world had shattered into a million irreparable pieces.
My vision blurred with tears I refused to let fall.
"It can't be," I whispered, more to myself than to Kennedy. 
How many nights had I lain awake, imagining scenarios where Lucas had survived? How many times had I convinced myself to accept reality, only to have hope flare up again at the slightest provocation? 
And now this.
My entire body trembled. I couldn't breathe properly, couldn't focus on anything but the man who so eerily resembled the love I had lost.
"Serena." Kennedy's voice cut through my thoughts. "Calm down. I'll find out."
I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. I knew how dangerous hope could be. How it could build you up only to destroy you more thoroughly than before. The higher the hope, the harder the fall. And I had fallen so far already.
But I couldn't stop the wild beating of my heart, couldn't quell the frantic thoughts racing through my mind. 
Kennedy pulled out his phone, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. "Get me everything you can on the model who just walked. I want his complete file. And have someone watch him. Don't let him leave without us knowing."
He turned back to me. "We'll check first, then decide what to do."
I nodded again, trying to control my shaking hands. The rest of the show passed in a blur. I couldn't focus on the remaining models, couldn't appreciate the designs that normally would have captivated my attention.
Everything else-the music, the applause, the flashing cameras-faded into background noise.
Approximately half an hour later, Kennedy leaned over again. "The information's been sent to your phone. You should take a look."
My heart skipped a beat. The moment of truth had arrived, and suddenly I wasn't sure I was ready for it. My phone felt impossibly heavy in my hand, the notification blinking accusingly at me. 
I swallowed hard, my finger hovering over the screen. With a deep breath, I finally tapped the notification. The file opened, revealing a photograph of the model alongside his information. Same strong jawline. Same penetrating eyes. Same perfect features that had once been as familiar to me as my own.
But the name beneath the photograph wasn't Lucas Harrington.
Mateo García.
###chapter 309
Kennedy's POV
I watched Serena's face as she scrolled through Mateo García's profile on her phone. The subtle tightening around her eyes, the almost imperceptible downturn of her lips.
"He's American with Latin roots," I explained, keeping my voice steady. "Grew up in France. Twenty-six years old. Not a professional model, just does this occasionally. He's friends with Marlon. Comes from money but started his own e-commerce business."
Serena said nothing, her thumb swiping through the images with mechanical precision. Each photo seemed to drive a deeper wedge between her wishful thinking and reality. This man wasn't Lucas Harrington. He simply looked eerily similar.
"The world is full of coincidences," I offered awkwardly, knowing how hollow my words must sound. "Doppelgängers exist everywhere. Today you saw Mateo, tomorrow it could be someone else who looks like-"
I let the sentence die, suddenly aware I was only making things worse. Serena set her phone down on her lap, her movements deliberate. She seemed isolated in a bubble of disappointment.
I didn't push further. 
The show concluded to enthusiastic applause, but Serena remained fixed in her seat long after the final model left the runway. The crowd thinned around us, fashionable attendees streaming toward the exits, their excited chatter fading into the cavernous space of the venue.
Atticus and I flanked Serena like silent sentinels. Neither of us spoke. 
The cleaning crew started to move through the rows, collecting discarded programs and empty champagne flutes. One of them gave us a questioning look as they approached our section.
"We should go," I said finally, breaking the heavy silence.
Serena looked up, and I was startled by the clarity in her eyes. Whatever inner turmoil she'd been experiencing had been replaced by determination.
"You two go ahead," she said, rising from her seat. "I'm going backstage to wait for Marlon."
Atticus immediately stepped forward, his brow furrowed with concern. "Do you want me to come with you?"
"No," she replied, her voice soft but resolute. "I'll be fine."
She turned and walked toward the backstage entrance, her posture straight.
"Wait-" Atticus began, moving to follow her.
"Let's go," I said firmly, grabbing his arm.
Atticus wrenched away from my grip, his face contorted with sudden anger. "What the hell, Kennedy? I'm trying to support her, and you keep getting in my way. Do you have some kind of thing for me or something?!"
The absurdity of his suggestion would have made me laugh in any other circumstance. Instead, I felt my patience snap like a dry twig.
"Chase any woman you want, Atticus," I said, my voice dropping to a dangerous register. "But not Serena. Never Serena."
His eyes widened, then narrowed suspiciously. "Why not Serena? Don't forget, Kennedy, you're married with a kid. If anyone shouldn't have 'intentions' toward her, it's you."
I stared at him, not bothering to hide my contempt. "This is Washington," I warned, stepping closer. "If you want to leave here in one piece, I suggest you behave yourself."
Atticus's jaw dropped. "Are you threatening me?!"
"Yes," I replied without hesitation.
"Fuck!" he spat, realizing I was deadly serious.
I watched Serena's retreating figure until she disappeared behind the backstage door. Part of me wanted to follow, to protect her from whatever pain might come from confronting Mateo García. But I knew this was something she needed to do alone.
Some ghosts can only be exorcised in private.
Cursing under his breath, Atticus followed me as I made my way to the exit.





Serena's POV
I settled into the plush sofa in Marlon's dressing room, picking up a newspaper from the glass coffee table to pass the time. The headline blurred before my eyes-another corporate takeover that would normally interest me, but today my mind was elsewhere. 
The door suddenly swung open, and my heart lurched painfully against my ribs.
For a moment, I couldn't breathe. Standing in the doorway was the moderl - Mateo García. 
But when his eyes slid over me, there was nothing there. No recognition. No warmth. Just a stranger's casual glance that lasted two or three seconds before he prepared to leave.
"Are you looking for Marlon?" I asked, my voice betraying me with a slight tremor.
He paused, one hand still on the doorknob. "Do you know where he is?"
His voice was different-lighter, more crisp than Lucas's deep, resonant tone. The realization washed over me like a cold shower. This wasn't Lucas. Of course it wasn't. 
He raised an eyebrow at my silence, studying me with growing impatience.
I forced myself back to reality. "I don't know where he is," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "But his assistant mentioned he'd be back soon. If you need to see him, you could wait here for a moment."
He hesitated, then stepped into the room. He chose the armchair across from me and picked up another section of the newspaper, creating a barrier between us.
I couldn't help myself. My eyes kept drifting to his features, cataloguing the similarities and differences. The shape of his nose was identical, but his lips were slightly thinner. His hair was styled differently, but the same rich color. It was uncanny, unnerving, and I couldn't look away.
Suddenly, he lowered the newspaper, fixing me with a cold stare.
"I don't appreciate being stared at like that," he said flatly.
Heat rushed to my face. "I'm sorry," I fumbled, embarrassed to be caught. "It's just that you look remarkably like someone I know."
His mouth curved into a mocking smile. "That's quite a cliché pickup line, don't you think?"
The casual cruelty of his assumption stung more than it should have. I wasn't some desperate woman trying to flirt in a backroom. I was Serena Sinclair, for God's sake. I ran one of the largest companies in Manhattan. Men approached me, not the other way around.
But something in his dismissive attitude pricked me. Before I could respond, he abruptly folded the newspaper and stood up. "Actually, I think I'll wait elsewhere."
As he reached the door, he turned back, his eyes cold. "The way you look at me makes me uncomfortable."
The door closed behind him with a soft click, but it might as well have been a slam. I sat there, seething, with no outlet for my sudden anger. How dare he assume I was interested in him? Lucas was ten times more handsome than this arrogant copy. Lucas had warmth behind his eyes, even when he was being stern. Lucas would never be so needlessly cruel to a stranger.
I pressed my hands against my temples, frustrated with myself for allowing thoughts of him to resurface so easily after all this time. 
The door opened again, and I quickly composed my expression.
"What's wrong?" Marlon asked, his brow furrowed with concern as he entered. "You look upset."
I forced a smile. "Nothing. I'm just hungry."
He checked his watch and grimaced apologetically. "Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Let's go get something to eat."
"By the way, I've invited a friend to join us," Marlon mentioned casually as we walked through the exhibition hall. "You don't mind, do you?"
"Not at all," I replied, the words leaving my mouth before I could consider who this mysterious friend might be. 
As we approached the entrance, my heart stopped. There he stood, tall and imposing. 
I forced my gaze away, pretending to adjust my dress, desperately trying to slow my racing pulse.
"Mateo! Over here!" Marlon called out, waving enthusiastically.
###chapter 310
Serena's POV
My stomach twisted into knots. 
He approached us with measured steps, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. I noticed the flicker of annoyance in his eyes when they landed on me, a flash of emotion quickly masked by cool indifference. My lips pressed into a thin line as I steeled myself for the inevitable interaction.
"Serena Sinclair, internationally renowned designer Lumi Nova, and a successful businesswoman," Marlon introduced with flourish, oblivious to the tension crackling between us. "And this is Mateo, my friend, half-Washington."
I extended my hand, a peace offering in this silent war between us. "Hello."
"Pleasure," Lucas replied coldly, his hands remaining firmly in his pockets, rejecting my gesture.
I withdrew my hand, fighting to maintain my composure.
"Mateo's pretty casual," Marlon interjected, clearly sensing the awkwardness. "Serena, don't take it personally."
"I'm not," I replied with a forced smile that didn't reach my eyes. Inside, my heart constricted with a pain I refused to acknowledge.
As we headed to the waiting car, Marlon claimed the passenger seat, leaving Mateo and me to share the back. The universe had a cruel sense of humor today. Mateo pressed himself against the door, creating as much distance between us as the confined space allowed. I mirrored his actions, turning toward the window and presenting him with the back of my head. The city lights blurred as we drove, reflecting my jumbled emotions.
The silence in the backseat felt suffocating, weighted with unspoken words and buried memories. I focused on the passing scenery, pretending to find nightscape fascinating. Anything was better than acknowledging the man beside me, whose presence alone could shatter the carefully constructed composure.
When it happened, I had no time to react. The driver made a sharp turn, swerving to avoid an oncoming car that had drifted into our lane. The sudden movement sent me careening across the seat. My body acted on instinct, arms wrapping tightly around Mateo's waist as I crashed against his chest. 
"What happened?" Marlon asked, turning in his seat.
"I apologize, Mr. Wright," the driver explained, his voice tense. "A sedan cut us off. We nearly collided, so I had to make a sharp turn."
"Drive more carefully," Marlon instructed firmly.
"Yes, sir. I'll be more cautious."
As the car stabilized and my racing heart began to slow, I became acutely aware of my position-pressed against Mateo, my arms encircling his waist like a lover's embrace. Before I could move, his voice cut through me, cold and sharp.
"Had enough of the embrace?" he asked, each word dripping with disdain.
I jerked away as if burned, retreating to my corner of the seat. My heart hammered as I straightened up in the backseat, smoothing my dress with trembling fingers.
"That was just an accident," I explained, my voice unnaturally high. The words hung awkwardly between us.
Mateo's lips curled into a cold smile, his eyes shimmering with disbelief. The way he looked at me-like I was just another woman throwing herself at him-made my blood boil.
Who does he think he is? Does he really believe every woman is desperate to touch him?
I shifted as far away as the leather seat would allow, pressing myself against the door. The space between us now felt like both too much and not enough.
"For safety reasons, Miss Sinclair, you might want to fasten your seatbelt," Mateo said, his deep voice dripping with sarcasm.
I bit back a sharp retort and yanked the seatbelt across my body, clicking it into place with enough force to make my point. The tension in the car was suffocating, and I stared resolutely out the window, willing the ride to end.
When we finally arrived at the hot pot restaurant in Chinatown, I nearly sighed with relief. The private room Marlon had reserved was warm and inviting, with steam already rising from the central pot. Mateo deliberately chose a seat far from mine, which suited me perfectly.
I focused my attention on Marlon, laughing at his jokes and discussing the latest industry news.
"Serena," Marlon said, using the nickname he'd given me years ago, "Mateo is trying to expand his e-commerce platform to Manhattan. I was hoping you might be able to help him make some connections."
I took a sip of water, maintaining my professional smile. "Mr. García, if you need any assistance, please let me know. I'll do whatever I can to help." Though I don't think highly of Mateo, Marlon has been my mentor, so I certainly won't turn down his request.
Lucas didn't even look at me when he responded, "That won't be necessary. I can handle my own business affairs without troubling Miss Sinclair."
His dismissive tone stung more than it should have. Before I could respond, his phone rang, and he excused himself to take the call.
As soon as Lucas was out of earshot, Marlon leaned toward me with a grin. "You two would make a perfect match, you know."
I nearly choked on my water. "What?"
"I've seen you single for years now, and I thought I'd introduce you to a great guy... The moment I saw him, I knew he'd be perfect for you."
"Stop playing matchmaker," I said, shaking my head. "Mateo and I definitely don't click. Not even a little."
"But-"
"Seriously, Marlon," I insisted. "Not happening."
Mateo returned before Marlon could press further. "Sorry about that," he said, sliding back into his seat.
"Girlfriend?" Marlon asked casually.
"Yes," Lucas confirmed without hesitation.
I felt a strange twist in my stomach. Now Marlon would drop this ridiculous matchmaking scheme.
Mateo glanced between us, his expression shifting as though he'd just realized something. "I'm not interested in most women," he added coolly. "In fact, I find them quite off-putting, especially the type who throw themselves at me."
That was it. My composure shattered in an instant. The simmer of irritation that had been building all evening erupted into white-hot rage.
"Mr. García," I said, setting down my chopsticks with deliberate care. "Your attitude tonight has been incredibly presumptuous."
His eyes widened slightly-the first genuine reaction I'd seen from him.
"Let me make myself perfectly clear," I continued, my voice steady despite the storm inside me. "First, I have absolutely no interest in you. None whatsoever."
I leaned forward, holding his gaze. "Second, I have a son and a daughter. They're ten years old. And third, I, Serena Sinclair, have always been extremely selective about men. Those who are arrogant, self-important, and condescending?" I smiled sweetly. "I avoid them like the plague."
The shock on his face was oddly satisfying.
"So rest assured," I finished, gathering my purse, "even if you were the last man on earth, I wouldn't look twice at you."
I turned to Marlon, softening my expression. "The hot pot was delicious, but some people have completely ruined my appetite. I'm leaving now. I'll take you to dinner tomorrow, just the two of us."
Without waiting for a response, I stormed out of the restaurant, my blood boiling as I pulled my coat tighter around me. The bitter January wind slapped against my face, but it did nothing to cool the rage burning inside me. Never in my life had I encountered someone so insufferably arrogant, so completely full of himself. The nerve of that man! The absolute nerve!
My fingers trembled as I pulled out my phone, scrolling to find Kennedy's number. Two rings, and his familiar voice answered.
"Serena? Everything okay?"
###chapter 311
Serena's POV
"Kennedy," I breathed, trying to keep my voice steady. "Could you come pick me up? I'm outside Golden Dragon Hot Pot."
"What happened to your dinner? "
"It's over," I said, my jaw clenched. "Please, just come get me."
I hung up and stood on the sidewalk, watching my breath form little clouds in the frigid air. The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. The way he had looked at me across the table, those gray eyes filled with judgment, that infuriating half-smile playing on his lips when I'd challenged him. 
I paced back and forth, my heels clicking against the pavement. A few passersby glanced at me, but I barely noticed them. In my mind, I was replaying every condescending word he'd said, every dismissive gesture. Mateo García. The name alone now made my skin crawl.
Twenty minutes later, Kennedy's black sedan pulled up to the curb. He jumped out and rushed toward me, concern etched on his face.
"Jesus, Serena, you're shaking!" Before I could protest, he pulled me into his arms, his body warm against the winter chill.
"Let's get you in the car," he said, keeping an arm around me as he guided me to the passenger side.
Once inside, I sank into the heated leather seat, finally feeling the cold that had seeped into my bones while I'd been standing outside fuming.
Kennedy slid into the driver's seat and turned to me. "So what happened? How'd it end so quickly? Where's Marlon? He just let you wait out in the cold by yourself?"
I shook my head, still seething. "It wasn't Marlon. I met someone else. Someone who made my stomach turn. I couldn't eat another bite, so I left."
Kennedy's eyebrows shot up, and a smile played at the corners of his mouth. "In this day and age, someone actually managed to make Serena Sinclair throw down her napkin and walk out? This person must be quite something."
"You have no idea," I muttered, staring out the window at the glittering scene. "I've never met anyone more self-important and condescending in my entire life."
"I don't know," Kennedy said, pulling away from the curb. "I think they sound interesting."
I turned to him, incredulous. "Interesting? They're insufferable!"
Kennedy's smile widened. "Maybe. But they did something I haven't seen in years."
"What's that?" I asked, annoyed.
His eyes met mine, suddenly serious. "They made you feel something. Actually feel something, Serena. You've been walking around like a ghost for so long, I was starting to forget what you look like when you're truly alive."
The words hit me like a physical blow. I opened my mouth to argue, but nothing came out. Deep down, I knew he was right. 
I looked away, uncomfortable with the truth. "Whatever. I'm never going to see him again anyway, so it doesn't matter."
Kennedy shrugged, focusing on the road. "Where are you staying? Did you get a place yet?"
"Just a hotel for now," I said, grateful for the change of subject. I could see him about to say something-probably to offer his guest room again-but I quickly added, "I booked at the top place downtown. I'll be fine."
He seemed to accept this, driving in comfortable silence until we pulled up outside the grand entrance of my hotel. The doorman approached as Kennedy parked.
"I can take it from here," I said, reaching for the door handle.
Kennedy nodded. "I'll come by to pick you up tomorrow morning."
"Good."
"Goodnight, Serena."
"Goodnight, Kennedy."
He helped retrieve my luggage from the trunk, and I watched as he drove away, his taillights disappearing into the night traffic. I hurried into the warmth of the lobby, the opulent chandelier casting a golden glow over the marble floors.
At the reception desk, I put on my most pleasant smile. "Good evening. Reservation for Sinclair, Serena."
The concierge typed quickly, her movements efficient and professional. "Yes, Ms. Sinclair. We have you in one of our premier suites. May I see some identification?"
I handed over my ID, signed the necessary forms, and collected my room key card. 
I slid the key card into the door, relieved to finally have some privacy after the day's exhausting events. The hotel room was spacious and elegant, but all I could think about was washing away the chill that had seeped into my bones from the bitter winter.
Dropping my bag on the couch, I made a beeline for the bathroom. The thought of a hot shower was too tempting to resist, especially with the fear of catching a cold lurking in the back of my mind. I turned the water to near scalding, letting steam fill the bathroom as I stepped in, feeling the tension in my shoulders begin to dissolve under the hot water.
It wasn't until I turned off the shower that I realized my mistake. In my haste, I'd forgotten to grab the bathrobe from the closet. Sighing in frustration, I wrapped a towel around my body and used another to dry my dripping hair.
I pushed open the bathroom door, blinking through the steam, and froze. There, sprawled across the bed - my bed - was a man. Not just any man. Mateo García.
Our eyes met, his ones widening slightly in surprise. For a moment, neither of us moved. I felt like a deer caught in headlights, unable to process what I was seeing.
Then reality crashed down on me, and I couldn't stop the scream that tore from my throat. "AHHHH!"
In my panic, my grip on the towel loosened. Before I could catch it, it slipped, pooling around my feet and leaving me completely exposed. Mortification flooded through me as his eyes dropped, taking in every inch of my naked body.
I screamed even louder, desperately trying to cover myself with my hands.
"This isn't a deliberate show for me, is it?" Mateo drawled, his voice deep and infuriatingly calm despite the situation.
Heat rushed to my cheeks. How dare he suggest I would do something like that? 
"Y-you close your eyes! Close them right now!" I demanded, my voice shaking with a mixture of rage and embarrassment.
He raised an eyebrow, unmoving on the bed. "Why should I?"
His gaze remained steady, but there was something in his expression that made my humiliation worse - a complete lack of interest. As if my naked body meant nothing to him, was worth nothing more than a passing glance. Part of me wanted to slap him; another part was crushed by his indifference.
I lunged for the towel, clutching it against me, and backed toward the bathroom. Lucas still hadn't moved from the bed, his casual posture suggesting he owned the space, that I was the intruder rather than him.
"Get out of my room!" I hissed before retreating into the bathroom and slamming the door shut.
###chapter 312
Serena's POV
Alone again, I leaned against the sink, staring at my reflection in the mirror. My cheeks were flushed deep crimson, and my chest heaved with each rapid breath. My eyes, wide with shock and brimming with tears, stared back at me.
What was Mateo García doing in my room? In my bed? And why did it have to be him of all people who saw me like this? In his eyes, I must look exactly like the woman the gossip columns painted me to be - desperate, throwing myself at powerful men.
I gripped the edge of the sink, trying to steady myself. Mateo was nothing like the man I'd once believed I could trust. Nothing like Lucas. Lucas wasn't nearly as hateful and arrogant as him.
And yet... a single tear rolled down my cheek, surprising me. I couldn't remember the last time I'd cried for anyone but Lucas. Why was I crying now? Why was I allowing Mateo García to affect me this way?
One tear became many, and suddenly I was sobbing silently, years of pent-up pain and frustration pouring out. I pressed my hand against my mouth, trying to muffle the sounds. I would not let him hear me cry. I would not give him that satisfaction.
A loud bang on the door made me jump.
"How long are you planning to hide in there?" Mateo's voice was sharp with impatience. "Come out and explain yourself!"
The urge to throw something hard at the door was overwhelming. Who did he think he was?
"Open the door!" he demanded, pounding again.
"No!" I shouted back, finding my voice.
"Serena Sinclair!" he growled my name like it was an accusation.
"Go away!" I yelled, past caring about dignity.
His response came immediately, dripping with arrogance. "My room. Why should I leave?"
"This is MY room!" I screamed, all my usual poise and composure evaporating in the heat of my anger.
Years of etiquette and careful self-control vanished. In that moment, I wanted nothing more than to fling open the door and unleash every furious, undignified word that bubbled up inside me. I wanted to become the very thing I'd always refused to be - a screaming, raging woman who cared nothing for appearances. 
Mateo paused, and when he spoke again, his words were measured and deliberate. "This. Is. My. Room."
I froze, confusion momentarily overriding my anger.
"I just spoke with the front desk," he continued, his tone slightly more controlled. "They mixed up our rooms. My room is 1217. Your room is 1211. When you checked in, they gave you my key card by mistake. Understand?"
My mind raced to process this information. Surely a luxury hotel of this caliber couldn't make such a basic error? 
"If you understand, then come out now," Mateo demanded, interrupting my thoughts. "Stop squatting in my room."
That accusation rekindled my fury instantly. "I am NOT squatting!"
"Then why aren't you coming out?" he challenged.
My situation suddenly crystallized with horrifying clarity. I had disrobed in the bedroom, leaving all my clothes on the sofa outside the bathroom. And now I stood here, with nothing but a towel between me and him.
"I...I don't have my clothes," I admitted, my voice dropping to a mortified whisper.
More pounding on the door. "Open up!"
"I just told you I have no clothes on!" I shouted, exasperation making my voice crack.
"How am I supposed to hand you your clothes if you won't open the door?" he shouted back, equally frustrated.
I recognized the impossible logic of the situation. Carefully, I readjusted the towel, tucking it securely above my breasts and making sure it covered me to mid-thigh. With a deep breath, I unlocked the door and opened it the tiniest crack-just enough to peek through with one eye.
Mateo stood there, his gray eyes darkening as they narrowed at me. The hallway light outlined his tall frame, casting half his face in shadow. 
His lip curled into a mocking smile. "Why the theatrics? It's not like there's anything worth seeing."
My cheeks burned with humiliation and rage. "Just because it's not for your viewing pleasure doesn't mean you get a free show."
His expression hardened. "Free show? Please. You'd have to pay me to look."
"Mateo García!" I hissed, genuinely hurt by the venom in his words. 
He held up my neatly folded clothes. "Do you want these or not?"
"Yes," I practically whispered, hating how vulnerable I felt.
"Then open the door wider. I can't fit anything through this tiny crack."
I cringed at his crude reference to my clothes. My entire body shook with the effort of restraining myself from doing something reckless-like slapping him.
I tightened my grip on the edge of the door, my knuckles turning white with the strain of controlling my emotions. 
I took a deep breath, preparing to open the door just wide enough to snatch my clothes without compromising my dignity any further. 
Just as I started to turn the handle, the door suddenly burst inward. Mateo had apparently lost his patience and decided to force his way in at the exact moment I was opening it. The collision of opposing forces sent us both off balance.
"What the-" I didn't even finish my exclamation before Mateo tumbled forward, his tall frame completely losing equilibrium.
Time seemed to slow as he fell toward me, his gray eyes widening with surprise. I tried to step back, but there was nowhere to go. We crashed to the floor with a painful thud, his body landing directly on top of mine, his face buried in the crook of my neck. His weight pressed me hard against the cold tile floor, knocking the air from my lungs. I felt like my entire body was falling apart. Intense pain was coursing through every inch of me.
"Get off me!" I shrieked, a mixture of shock and fury coursing through me. What had I done in my past life to deserve this torment? 
"You-you asshole! How long are you fucking planning to lie on top of me? Get off!" I shouted, deliberately using the most offensive words I could think of. I wanted to hurt him, to make him feel as uncomfortable as he'd made me feel with his arrogant assumptions that I was throwing myself at him.
Mateo lifted his head, his jaw clenched tight. "Shut. Up." Each word emerged like a bullet.
But I wasn't about to be silenced. I squirmed beneath him, trying to free myself from his weight. He felt like a concrete wall pinning me down, immovable and hard.
"Stop moving," he growled, his voice dangerously low.
"Get off me, you creep!" I continued, pushing against his chest.
Something shifted in his expression then-his gray eyes darkened, and a dangerous spark ignited in them. "A creep, am I?" he asked softly, his voice sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.
My heart hammered in my chest, but I refused to back down. "Yes, you are! Now get off-"
Before I could finish, his mouth crashed down on mine, silencing my protests. My eyes flew open in shock, my body freezing beneath his. This couldn't be happening. Mateo García-the man who acted like I was beneath him-was kissing me!
Rage boiled up inside me, fierce and immediate. Without thinking, I bit down on his lower lip-hard. I tasted blood just before he jerked away.
"What the hell is wrong with you?" he shouted, touching his finger to his lip and staring at the blood in disbelief.
###chapter 313
Serena's POV
I wiped my mouth furiously with the back of my hand. "What's wrong with ME? What's wrong with YOU? Didn't you say you don't like women who throw themselves at you? Why the hell did you kiss me?" I continued rubbing my lips, making a show of my disgust. "That was revolting."
His eyes narrowed at my display, a muscle twitching in his jaw. I could see my words had struck a nerve, exactly as I'd intended. 
"Get off me. Now." My voice was ice cold.
After what felt like an eternity, he finally pushed himself up and stood, looking down at me with an expression I couldn't quite read-anger, certainly, but something else too. He reached for my scattered clothes and tossed them at me unceremoniously. They landed partly on my face, partly on the floor around me.
"Put these on and come out," he ordered, then turned and stalked away without a backward glance.
I stared at his retreating back, seething with indignation. My clothes lay scattered across the bathroom floor-my blouse, skirt, and even my undergarments. God, how had I ended up in this nightmare? Trapped in a hotel bathroom with the most insufferable man on the planet?
"Who does he think he is?" I muttered under my breath, gathering my dignity along with my clothes. I'd get dressed and leave, and then I'd never, ever have to see Mateo García again. I'd make sure our paths never crossed, even if I had to rearrange my entire life to make it happen.
I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart. The humiliation of this entire episode burned through me like acid. I loosened the already precarious towel wrapped around me, ready to quickly dress and escape this mortifying situation.
So focused was I on my plan for a quick exit that I completely forgot to close the door. And just as the towel fell away, exposing my bare skin to the cool bathroom air, I heard rapid footsteps returning.
I looked up in horror as Mateo burst back into the bathroom, his eyes landing directly on my naked body for the second time that day. Our eyes locked, and in that frozen moment, I felt the universe itself was playing a cruel joke on me.
But what happened next was worse than his intrusion.
"Serena, you change clothes without locking the door?!" he barked, his voice bouncing off the tiled walls. "Do you enjoy having men see you naked?!"
Blood rushed to my face, burning with humiliation and rage. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He had barged in on me, and somehow this was my fault? My fingers trembled as I clutched the towel against my chest, barely covering myself.
The fury bubbling inside me threatened to explode. I wanted to lunge at him, to scratch that arrogant face that looked down at me with such condescension. How dare he?
"You knew I was changing in here and you still burst in!" I shouted back, my voice shaking with rage. "What were your intentions, exactly? You're clearly interested in my body, aren't you? Stop pretending otherwise!"
His jaw tightened, the muscle there twitching with barely contained anger. "You're insane," he spat.
Then he did something that made my blood boil even hotter. He walked toward me-completely unfazed, as if I were nothing more than furniture. He bent down, picked up his fallen phone from beside my feet, and stormed out without another glance.
I stood there, trembling with fury, clutching the towel tightly. My mind raced with curses and insults I wished I'd thrown at him.
"Damn you," I whispered to the empty bathroom. My reflection in the mirror showed flushed cheeks and wild eyes. I quickly dressed myself, making absolutely certain every inch of skin was covered. No way would I give that jerk another opportunity to see my body.
When I finally emerged from the bathroom, Mateo lay sprawled on the king-sized bed, scrolling through his phone as if nothing had happened. He barely acknowledged me with a slight lift of his eyelids before returning to whatever was so fascinating on his screen.
I marched to the hotel phone by the nightstand, my movements stiff with controlled rage. I punched in the numbers for the front desk, determined to get answers.
"What is going on? Which room am I actually supposed to be in?!" I demanded when someone answered.
The polite voice on the other end replied, "Ms. Sinclair?"
"Yes," I confirmed, my tone clipped.
"We're outside room 1217 now. Would you mind if we come in to explain the situation?"
I hung up without answering and stormed to the door, yanking it open to find a small group of hotel staff huddled outside- five of them looking nervous and apologetic.
I stepped aside to let them enter, noticing how Mateo remained lounging on the bed, the picture of entitled indifference. He didn't even sit up, just continued playing with his phone like some bored aristocrat while chaos unfolded around him.
The hotel manager, a middle-aged man in an immaculate suit, stepped forward with a deep bow. "We sincerely apologize, Ms. Sinclair. The front desk clerk who checked you in today, Renata, is new-it's her first day. She mistakenly programmed your key card for room 1217 instead of your assigned room 1211. We are deeply sorry for this error."
All the staff members bowed deeply, a synchronized movement of contrition. Behind them stood a young woman-presumably Renata-looking absolutely terrified, her face pale and hands visibly shaking.
Another staff member, a young man with a name tag reading "Ethan," stepped forward. "I also must apologize, Ms. Sinclair. I should have double-checked the room assignment when I brought up your luggage. This mistake is partly my responsibility as well."
I stared at their bowed heads, the anger still coursing through me. But seeing their genuine remorse-especially the new employee who looked like she might faint from fear-made me pause. I took a deep breath, forcing the rage down into a more manageable simmer.
"Where is my actual room?" I asked, my voice calmer than I expected.
Ethan straightened immediately. "This way, Ms. Sinclair. I'll show you right away."
###chapter 314
Serena's POV
I turned away from them and began hastily gathering my belongings, shoving clothes and toiletries back into my suitcase without any care for organization. My movements were jerky, revealing the anger still simmering beneath my composed exterior.
Throughout this entire exchange, Mateo hadn't uttered a single word. He remained on the bed, pretending as if none of this concerned him, as if I didn't exist. His indifference was perhaps more infuriating than his earlier outburst.
After I'd stuffed everything into my luggage, Ethan rushed forward to take my bag. "Ms. Sinclair, please follow me," he said with an eager smile, clearly relieved I hadn't exploded at the staff.
Without a word, I followed Ethan to room 1211.
"Again, Ms. Sinclair, we sincerely apologize for the mix-up," the young man said, sliding the keycard into the door. "Please let us know if there's anything else we can do to make your stay more comfortable."
I forced a smile, though exhaustion was quickly overtaking my anger. "Thank you. I'm sure everything will be fine now."
Once alone, I dropped my carefully constructed facade. The door clicked shut behind me, and I leaned against it, closing my eyes. The weight of my luggage felt like nothing compared to the heaviness in my chest. After setting down my bags, I collapsed onto the bed, staring at the ceiling as the events of the past hour replayed in my mind.
"Don't think about it, Serena," I muttered to myself. "Don't think about him."
But Mateo García's face materialized in my thoughts anyway-his sharp eyes, that infuriating smirk when he realized I'd mistakenly entered his suite. How was I supposed to know that 1217 wasn't my room? 
Sighing heavily, I forced myself to get up. A good night's sleep was what I needed.
I rummaged through my suitcase for my silk pajamas and changed quickly. Just as I was preparing for my nightly routine, I reached for my favorite sleeping mask and froze. The realization hit me like a bucket of ice water.
"Damn it!" I hissed, clenching my fists. My overnight face mask was still in Mateo's room, sitting on his bathroom counter where I'd placed it before realizing my mistake.
I paced the room, contemplating my options. I could go get it myself, but the thought of facing Mateo again made my stomach twist.
"It's just a face mask," I told myself, though it was my favorite brand and nearly impossible to find in Washington. "Not worth another interaction with that man."
Decision made, I climbed into bed and turned off the lights. The sheets were cool against my skin as I tried to settle in. Sleep usually evaded me, requiring either melatonin or sleeping pills, but tonight I felt genuinely exhausted. Perhaps one good thing had come from this disaster of an evening.
I was drifting into that sweet space between consciousness and dreams when three sharp knocks on my door jolted me awake. For a moment, I considered ignoring it, but the knocking came again, more insistent this time.
"You've got to be kidding me," I growled, throwing back the covers and storming to the door. Whoever was disturbing me at this hour better have a damn good reason.
I yanked the door open, ready to unleash my fury-only to freeze in place. Mateo García stood before me, his hair wet and dripping onto the shoulders of his loosely tied bathrobe. Droplets of water clung to his chest where the robe parted, revealing more skin than I cared to see. The scent of soap wafted toward me, and I hated that I noticed it.
"What the hell are you doing here?" I demanded, crossing my arms over my chest. "It's the middle of the night, and you're dressed like... like that! What do you want?"
His eyes narrowed. "Ms. Sinclair, I'm bringing your face mask out of the kindness of my heart, and this is how you thank me?"
I snorted. "Kindness? From you? That's rich. What's your angle here, Mr. García?"
The muscle in his jaw twitched, and I could tell I'd struck a nerve. He extended his hand, holding my black cosmetics pouch.
"Do you want it or not?" he asked through gritted teeth. "Because I'm perfectly happy to throw it away."
I snatched the bag from his hand, our fingers brushing for the briefest moment.
"Thank you," I said coldly before slamming the door in his face, nearly catching his nose in the process.
My heart raced as I leaned against the door, clutching the cosmetics pouch. Sleep was now the furthest thing from my mind. I returned to bed, tossing and turning, mentally cursing Mateo García with every fiber of my being.
"Of all the hotels in Washington," I groaned into my pillow, "why did he have to be in this one? It's like we're mortal enemies from a past life or something."
The night passed with minimal sleep, and by morning, I felt like I was floating-and not in a good way. My limbs seemed disconnected from my body, and my head felt strangely light. A shiver ran through me despite the hotel room's adequate heating.
"Great," I muttered, catching sight of my pale reflection in the bathroom mirror. "Just what I need. A cold."
I went through the motions of my morning routine on autopilot, too tired to put much effort into my appearance. My phone rang just as I was contemplating whether I had time for coffee.
"Hello?" My voice sounded raspier than usual.
"I'm downstairs at your hotel," came Kennedy's smooth voice. "Would you like me to come up, or would you prefer to meet me in the lobby?"
I glanced at my unfinished makeup and disheveled state. "Wait for me at the entrance. I'll be down in a minute."
"No rush, Serena. Take your time," he said before hanging up.
###chapter 315
Serena's POV
I shivered in the backseat of Kennedy's car despite the heater being turned up to its maximum setting. The Washington winter had a way of seeping into my bones, making me feel like I'd never be warm again. I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to contain what little body heat I had left.
"Can we stop somewhere to buy a coat? It's freezing here," I said, my breath forming a small cloud in front of me despite the car's heating system working overtime.
Kennedy glanced at me through the rearview mirror, his eyes appraising me with that familiar mix of interest and condescension I'd grown accustomed to.
"I thought you didn't feel the cold, Serena," he remarked with a smirk playing at the corner of his lips.
I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. This was typical Kennedy-he'd do what I asked, but never without making me feel like my request was somehow a personal weakness. He was that kind of man-the type who would fulfill your requests but never anticipate your needs. The epitome of outdated masculinity wrapped in an expensive suit.
"Everyone feels cold in Washington in January," I replied, keeping my voice even. "Even you must own a winter coat."
He chuckled, seeming pleased that he'd gotten under my skin. "There's a shopping center just ahead. We can stop there."
I didn't respond, just stared out the window at the gray sky. Kennedy was a necessary alliance for now, nothing more. 
The car pulled up to a massive glass-fronted building. Kennedy handed his keys to the valet with barely a glance at the young man who rushed forward to assist us. I stepped out, the bitter wind instantly cutting through my thin blazer. Benjamin didn't offer his coat or even acknowledge my discomfort as we walked toward the entrance.
"I'll meet you inside," I told him, already walking toward the women's outerwear section. "This won't take long."
The warmth of the store enveloped me as soon as I stepped inside, but it wasn't enough to dispel the chill that had settled into my bones. I made my way quickly to the winter coat section, my eyes scanning the racks for something both warm and suitable. That's when I saw him.
Mateo García. Again.
My heart sank. What twisted fate kept throwing this man into my path? Just yesterday he'd looked at me with such disdain that I'd felt the judgment radiating off him in waves. All because I'd glanced at him a few times-was that such a crime?
Panic rose in my chest as his eyes met mine. I didn't want him thinking I was following him-the very thought was mortifying. Without thinking, I reached for Kennedy's arm and linked mine through it, pressing closer than I normally would have.
Kennedy's reaction was immediate-surprise followed by pleasure. A rare smile softened his usually stern features, and I could feel his posture straightening, as if my touch had somehow validated him. 
A mocking smile played at the corner of his lips as his gaze traveled from my face to my hand on Kennedy's arm. The judgment in his eyes was unmistakable, and it made my blood boil.
I tugged Kennedy past Mateo, chin raised, refusing to give him the satisfaction of seeing me uncomfortable.
"I need something warm," I told the sales assistant who approached us. 
The woman nodded. "We just received our new designer collection yesterday. I have three options that would be perfect for you."
She disappeared into the back and returned with three coats. They were all beautiful, but one in particular caught my eye-a deep navy puffer with subtle silver accents that would perfectly complement my complexion.
"This one has a matching men's version," the assistant said, looking hopefully at Kennedy. "Would you like to try it on as well, sir?"
"No, that won't be necessary," I cut in before Kennedy could answer. "Just the women's coat, please. I'll take it."
Kennedy stepped forward. "I'll take care of it." He pulled out his wallet and followed the assistant to the register.
I didn't protest. Kennedy had more money than he knew what to do with, and I wasn't above letting him spend some of it on me. It was the least he could do after dragging me to Washington in the dead of winter for his family's boring dinner.
While waiting for Benjamin to return, I slipped on the new coat, savoring its immediate warmth despite the store's heating. I examined my reflection in a nearby mirror, adjusting the collar and smoothing down the front. It fit perfectly, accentuating my waist while still looking sophisticated and warm.
The sound of a fitting room door opening caught my attention. I turned just as Mateo stepped out, and my heart nearly stopped.
He was wearing the men's version of my coat.
"You've got to be kidding me," I muttered under my breath. "Son of a bitch!"
Our eyes met in the mirror, and I could see the contempt in his gaze, as if he thought I'd deliberately chosen this coat to match his. The absurdity of the situation would have been comical if it wasn't so infuriating.
Without breaking eye contact, I yanked the coat off, my movements sharp with anger. To my satisfaction, Mateo did the same, shrugging out of his coat with equal irritation.
We stood there, locked in a silent standoff, neither willing to be the one to back down. Why should I change my choice because of him? I saw the coat first. I liked it. I wanted it. And I wasn't going to let some judgmental stranger dictate my wardrobe choices.
"Is everything okay?" Kennedy's voice broke through my anger as he returned with a shopping bag.
"It's fine," I said curtly, grabbing the coat from where I'd draped it over a nearby rack. "Let's go."
As we walked toward the exit, Kennedy glanced back at Mateo, recognition dawning on his face.
"Isn't that the model from yesterday? The one who looks like Lucas Harrington?"
"He looks nothing like Lucas," I snapped, more harshly than I intended. The suggestion that this arrogant, judgmental man resembled Lucas in any way set my teeth on edge. "If you ever meet both of them, you'll see they have absolutely nothing in common."
Kennedy's eyebrows rose at my vehemence. "You seem rather upset about him. Was he the one who bothered you last night?"
"Yes," I admitted as we stepped out into the cold again.
Kennedy studied my face with newfound interest. "I've never seen anyone get under your skin like this before, Serena. It's... unexpected."
I didn't respond. Back in the car, I remained agitated about our encounter. A strange feeling grew-why did this stranger's attitude affect me so deeply? Why did I react so strongly to him?
