###1: Chapter 1 Trial 
1 -1 Trial 
“This Court hereby sentences the defendant, Ye Ning, for the crime of fraud, to a term of ten years’ imprisonment, to be carried out immediately!” 
In the High People’s Court of A City, as the presiding judge announced the verdict of the jade stones fraud case that had shocked the entire city, many people in the courtroom turned their gaze toward the woman sitting in the defendant’s seat. 
She was a very frail and beautiful woman, with delicate features, pale and tender skin, and especially those eyes—clear and bright with a distinct contrast between the iris and the pupil, they were irresistibly captivating at a glance. 
It was just a pity that, due to the court’s judgment, her complexion at the moment was exceptionally pale, like a lifeless flower so bleak and empty it was startling. 
“Who is she anyway? 
Daring to deceive with jade stones worth hundreds of millions, does she not cherish her life?” 
“Not sure, I heard she’s an orphan, and it seems someone adopted her later on.” 
“An orphan?” 
As this was said, many in the courtroom showed a look of sympathy… 
At that time, at the very last row of the public gallery, a woman who had been sitting there for a long time with sunglasses on, when she saw Ye Ning being led out by the armed police, also stood up suddenly and followed them out. 
“Officer, may I have a few words with her?” 
“Who are you…?” 
“I am her sister, my name is Yang Xueshan,” said the woman standing before them as she took off her sunglasses. 
This was another very beautiful woman, with chestnut-colored, big wavy curled hair, dressed in the latest figure-hugging dress from a famous brand, and without her sunglasses, she stood there, by comparison with the detained Ye Ning, dazzling and radiant. 
Ye Ning looked at her blankly for a while before nodding towards the two armed police who were watching her: “Hmm…” 
– 
Two minutes later, in a small visitor’s room next to the courtroom – 
Ye Ning’s face was very pale, she sat there, and after biting her bloodless lips for a moment, asked, “Did he send you here?” 
He? 
The young master of the Ou Family, Ou Yuze? 
Yang Xueshan fidgeted with the valuable jade ring on her finger. 
Seeing the woman opposite her react to her jade ring by suddenly revealing a small pair of pupils within her larger ones, a trace of disgust flashed in Yang Xueshan’s eyes: “No, I came on my own!” 
That was pupula duplex! 
A myth that had been circulating in the Antique Circle for a very long time! 
It was also something she had envied, detested, and resented for a very long time… 
“Why?” 
Ye Ning hadn’t noticed this yet. 
Startled by the response, she became even paler: “Why didn’t he come? 
He promised he would come today and that he would get me out, why didn’t he come?” noveldrama
Why? 
Yang Xueshan couldn’t hold back any longer: “Ye Ning, don’t you understand yet? 
You have become a sacrificial pawn in the Ou Family’s fight for their wealth. 
The second branch of the Ou Family adopted you, and the young master of the second branch, Ou Yuze, sweet-talked you, all to use you!” 
“What are you saying?” 
“Don’t you know? 
The second branch needed someone with your eyes to compete with the third branch of the Ou Family. 
Haven’t you realized it? 
Ever since you arrived, the second branch’s business has been soaring, gaining the old man’s favor. 
Are you really naive or just pretending to be?” 
Every word was like a knife, and at that moment, the woman seemed to no longer be the sister who had relied on each other in the orphanage for ten years—she was more like a stranger. 
Every word she uttered was so venomous and malicious.

###2: Chapter 2 The Gunshot in the Courtroom 
2 -2 The Gunshot in the Courtroom 
Use her? 
Was everything a lie? 
Ye Ning was stunned! 
She staggered backward, her pale face like that of a corpse! 
How could this be possible? 
That man had always told her how much he loved her, even said he would marry her. 
Just two months ago, he ordered a wedding ring for her. 
It was at that time in that hotel that she gave herself to him completely. 
How could this be possible? 
Ye Ning’s thoughts began to blur, “No, I don’t believe what you’re saying is true. 
Even if you say they were using my eyes, why would they leave me to die now? 
Aren’t my eyes exactly what you want?” 
Yang Xueshan sneered, “Yes, indeed we wanted them, but now you’ve aroused Ou Mucen’s suspicions. 
Ye Ning, don’t blame Yu Ze for being heartless. 
If he can’t have something, he won’t let anyone else have it either!!” 
Ou Mucen was the third young master of the Ou Family, the last son of Old Master Ou, born when he was fifty to his new wife, now only twenty-four! 
Ye Ning finally shivered as she remembered the man she had seen at the Ou Family’s residence, who, no matter when, always gave off a chilling vibe. 
But even so, was it necessary to destroy her? 
Staggering, she thought of the test results. 
Her cold fingers touched her abdomen, clutching it as if grasping a lifesaving straw, “No, let me see Yu Ze, he won’t leave me behind, we’ve already been the closest, and I…” 
“The closest relationship?” 
Before she could finish her sentence, the woman standing before her sharply and loudly interrupted, “Are you talking about that night two months ago? 
Ye Ning, do you think the person who slept with you that night was Yu Ze? 
Let me tell you, it was just a gigolo I casually pulled from a nightclub for you!” 
!!!!!! 
This last sentence was like a sharp sword that slashed through all the remaining light, leaving Ye Ning standing there, her entire body plummeting into a cold abyss. 
Her mind was emptied of everything… 
A substitute? 
That’s right, over these years, although the man named Ou Yuze always whispered sweet nothings to her, he never made any intimate moves. 
Except for that night. 
That night, after he carried her into the hotel room, he first said he had to step out for a bit. 
When he came back, he mysteriously turned off the lights, and afterward, it was as if someone else had taken his place, never resting on her body throughout the night. noveldrama
It turns out, the man that night wasn’t him at all! 
The girl, completely drained of color, swayed where she stood. 
Suddenly, she laughed, little by little, like a puppet being pulled by strings. 
She mechanically looked at the woman in front of her and then forcefully smashed the chair from behind at her, “Yang Xueshan, I’ll kill you, you bitch!!” 
Bang!!! 
The armed guards at the door had been listening to the noises inside. 
Suddenly hearing the commotion, they immediately burst in. 
Seeing the scene, one guard reflexively drew his gun and pulled the trigger at the woman who was attacking. 
In an instant, a gunshot rang out, shocking the entire courthouse… 
– 
It was at this moment that a black Rolls-Royce with a license plate of eight ‘8’s passed by. 
Hearing the loud bang from the courtyard, the young man sitting in the back, who was watching a hotel video, raised his eyebrows and turned his head to look outside the window, “What was that sound?”
###3: Chapter 3: Euclidean Empire 
3 -3: Euclidean Empire 
“I don’t know… 
was it an explosion?” Secretary Gao, who was driving, glanced at the rearview mirror and saw that the young master’s expression was not so pleased, so he carefully ventured a response. 
An explosion? 
What nonsense is this? 
The expressionless young man, who had not found anything of note in that video, felt even worse: “Has the verdict for the Original Jade Stone fraud case come out yet?” 
“It has, but it’s strange, sir. 
The mastermind this time turned out to be the orphan girl adopted by the second household.” 
“The orphan girl?” 
The man sitting in the back, recalling the girl he had seen a few times at home, who was always meek and followed behind the woman of the second household, had a hint of a cold smile on his lips: “Do you believe it?” 
Secretary Gao hurriedly shook his head: “Of course not, but now the second household has pushed all the evidence onto this little girl, making her the scapegoat. 
Even if we wanted to give them trouble, it would be useless now.” 
Indeed, that was the case! 
The man, holding the closing document that had arrived in his hand, grew dark in the eyes: “We’ll let them off this time. 
Continue to keep an eye on them, and finding the true mastermind behind them is key!” 
“Yes, sir!” 
“Also, hurry up and find out who was responsible for what happened at the hotel that night, and who was that woman?!!” 
Secretary Gao: “…” 
Sir, it’s been two months, and you still haven’t recalled how you ended up in someone’s room that night. 
How do you expect me, an outsider, to investigate it?!! 
… noveldrama
=====Time Division Line====== 
Five years later, downtown, Ou Family Building- 
After the struggle of five years, the Ou Family’s shares began to be clearly distributed. 
The decades-old brand “Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry” naturally went to the second household, which has made rapid progress in the jewelry industry in recent years. 
And the third household? 
Without the inheritance of jade ware, they took over other projects, such as Ou Family Department Store, Ou Family Real Estate, Ou Family Hotel. 
While not as famous as “Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry,” the businesses have flourished under the management of the young master of the third household in the past five years and were in no way inferior to the second household. 
Moreover, he recently established his own jade brand “Yuzhirun,” ready to enter the jewelry market. 
“Ningning, are you really sure you want to interview with this company?” 
Qiao Feiyu parked her Xiaoxia in front of this iconic skyscraper, saw the “Yuzhirun” sign above, which was a very small lightbox, and couldn’t help but worry. 
A newly established brand, can it really make an impact? 
But the woman sitting behind her just glanced indifferently at the building, then gently set down the little boy she was holding: “Xiaobao, be good and listen to Auntie Qiao here. 
Mom will be back soon after going out for a bit, okay?” 
“Mom, are you going to work here?” 
The little boy, only about four years old, plump and cute like a delicate doll, asked like a little adult after hearing his mother’s words. 
Seeing this, the woman, whose mood had been somewhat tense, suddenly softened: “Yes, do you like it? 
If mom gets the job, I can buy you your favorite toys.” 
The little boy: “…” 
After a while, his little face, looking out the car window at the building so tall he couldn’t see the top even if he raised his little head, reluctantly admonished: “Then mom, be careful.”
###4: Chapter 4 I’m Here to Apply for the CEO’s Special Assistant 
4 -4 I’m Here to Apply for the CEO’s Special Assistant 
Cautious? 
Sitting in the front, Qiao Feiyu heard the little one’s words, her eyes twitching severely: “Ye Xiaobao, do you know this place is very dangerous? 
Telling your mom to be cautious?” 
Ye Xiaobao didn’t even glance at her, just watching mom getting out of the car. 
“Xiaobao?” 
“Auntie Qiao, I need to pee…” 
Qiao Feiyu was startled! 
To pee? 
At this time, where to pee? 
She looked at the building outside the car window and saw that the department store below was also open. 
She had no choice but to pull out the keys and open the car door: “You child, why do you always have so many issues? 
Just coming out and you need to pee, didn’t you go at home?” 
Gone once can’t go again? 
Stupid woman! 
The little child, with small and short legs, also got out of the car and saw his mom, who had gotten off before him, already entering that building, so he hurriedly sped up his pace. 
Qiao Feiyu, watching from behind, desperately shouted: “Ye Xiaobao? 
Ye Xiaobao wait for me, hey, you child, come back here! 
Don’t walk so fast…” 
—— 
Meanwhile, the woman who had already entered the building didn’t realize her son had followed her in. 
Seeing that the first four floors of the building were Ou Department Store, and only from the fifth floor were the offices, she started taking the elevator up. 
“Did you hear? 
I heard that for the president’s recruitment of a special assistant, many people didn’t get the position.” 
“Really? 
Why? 
Is it because the president has particularly high requirements this time?” 
“Not really, I heard it’s for the ‘Yuzhirun’ project, as you know, this is a sector the president only recently developed, so he probably needs someone with more expertise.” 
Someone with expertise? noveldrama
The woman standing in the elevator heard this and her heart, which was slightly nervous, relaxed a bit, and on her beautiful and fair face, her usual serene smile emerged. 
Soon, she reached the fifth floor. 
She stepped out of the elevator and opposite the elevator, there was a very regal-looking glass door, and through it, the large “Ou Group” sign clearly caught her eye. 
So, she adjusted the hair near her ears and walked over. 
“May I ask who you are…” 
“Hello, my name is An Ning, I’m here to apply for the position of the company president’s special assistant.” She went straight to the point, handing over her resume immediately. 
Special assistant to the president? 
The receptionist, upon hearing this, immediately drew several looks in her direction. 
This was a very young woman, about twenty-three or twenty-four years old, not very fashionably dressed, and her features were not particularly flamboyant, but her neat makeup and the mulberry-colored cotton linen long dress made her look elegant and gently sophisticated, like an orchid, drawing many people’s gaze upon her arrival. 
“Special assistant to the president? 
Was it the recruitment ad listed on XX recruitment website?” 
“Yes.” 
“I’m sorry, but there was a discrepancy when we posted that recruitment advertisement. 
What our president actually needs is someone with considerable experience in the jade industry.” 
“Is that so…” Upon hearing this, the woman standing there fell into a slight ponderation. 
Thinking she might give up knowing the difficulty, the receptionist prepared to dismiss her, but at that moment, the young woman with a perennial calm in her eyes spoke again, “It just so happens that I do have a bit of knowledge in that area, could you please notify your HR department?”
###5: Chapter 5 What Can a Twenty-three-year-old Woman Do? 
5 -5 What Can a Twenty-three-year-old Woman Do? 
“You?” 
The clerk couldn’t quite believe it; the woman seemed to be no more than twenty-three or twenty-four years old. 
How could she possibly understand jade? 
It was widely known that those proficient in the jade industry were at least middle-aged, and in recent days, all the interviewees had been around that age. 
And now this woman was claiming to know about it? 
The clerk subconsciously wanted to reject her, but after locking eyes with the woman, who said simply, “Isn’t there an interview process? 
Whether I’m qualified or not, we’ll know after trying.” 
At that, the clerk was at a loss for words. 
Indeed, whether one is suitable for the job must be determined through an interview. 
However, the main examiner for their position was none other than the biggest boss of this building. 
With that in mind, it wouldn’t hurt to let her lose hope. 
So, she actually picked up the internal phone at the reception desk, “Hello? 
President’s office? 
There’s another person here to interview for the president’s assistant…” 
—— 
Fifteenth floor— 
In the bright and clean office, with its grey and white furniture and the all-black crystal glass desk sitting in the light streaming through a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows, the space exuded simplicity and luxury, monochrome yet elegant. 
Xiaochen came in with the last resume which had been turned down, and seeing the man in the white boss chair still busy, he felt even worse: “Young Master, the last candidate was no good either. 
You see… 
could we maybe show them a stone of a lower grade? 
It’s just for an assistant; do they really need to meet the high standards of identification in this field?” 
“Do you think I am looking for something like you?” 
Xiaochen immediately clammed up! 
What’s wrong with him? 
He was competent, wasn’t he? 
Look how well he managed everything for him, up and down? 
Feeling aggrieved, Xiaochen nonetheless had to yield, taking what he had in hand and turning to leave. 
But just then, the outside assistant Xiaochen called him at the door, “Secretary Gao, there’s another person downstairs here for an interview, a twenty-three-year-old woman.” 
A twenty-three-year-old woman?! 
Secretary Gao instinctively turned his head to look at the man in the office: “President…” 
“Gao Ziyang, do you really not want to work anymore? 
If you don’t want to, I wouldn’t mind having a twenty-three-year-old woman as my secretary!” The man inside said this without even raising his head. 
Secretary Gao was on the verge of tears, “President, I was wrong. 
I’ll send her away right now…” 
What did this have to do with him? 
He hadn’t asked for the woman to come for an interview; he hadn’t even heard there was such a young woman involved. 
Had he known, would she have even made it through Oushi Building’s doors? 
Seething with frustration, he saw Xiaochen at the secretary desk of the President’s office and immediately snapped, “Where’s the woman?” 
Xiaochen quickly stood up, “I’ve asked her to wait in the reception room.” 
“Tell her to leave!” 
“Ah? 
Why?” 
“Why so many questions? 
Just tell her to leave. 
Here, do we need a reason to send someone away?” 
Xiaochen: “…” 
At that moment, from the reception room in the corridor, the young woman who had been waiting inside for quite some time stood up and walked out, having seen that no one had come to interview her. 
Seeing this scene, she paused and frowned slightly, “Indeed, you don’t need a reason, but at least, you should know how to respect others.” 
Her tone was neither cold nor heated, showing no signs of annoyance, but her words were enough to infuriate everyone present.noveldrama
###6: Chapter 6 Ye Xiaobao Disappeared! 
6 -6 Ye Xiaobao Disappeared! 
Who is she? 
By what right does she dare to teach him a lesson? 
Secretary Gao turned and looked back, intending to sternly reprimand her, but when he clearly saw the woman standing in the corridor, he suddenly froze. 
She was a striking woman, dressed in a lotus-root pink cotton and linen long dress, tall and fair, with a delicate and elegant countenance. 
Her ear-length hair perfectly framed her palm-sized face, making it appear exquisitely dainty. 
With dignified features and an elegant disposition, she did not wear expensive clothes, yet she exuded the cultured air of someone from a scholarly family. 
So, this woman was the one here for the interview? 
Secretary Gao stood there, observing her for a while and finally decided to give her a chance. 
“Alright, don’t say I didn’t give you a chance. 
If you can recognize what this is, I’ll let you interview,” he said, taking the ring that Xiaochen was wearing on her finger, which had been reportedly gifted by her boyfriend. 
This thing? 
Upon seeing it, the woman’s calm gaze swept over the item in his hand, and after a moment, her eyebrows furrowed tightly, “Is this also from your Ou’s enterprise? 
Is this what you make?” 
This thing? 
What’s wrong with it? 
Xiaochen, feeling that something was amiss, immediately came over, “What’s wrong with it? 
My boyfriend spent several thousand on it for me, you…” 
“It’s just a very ordinary piece of Xiu Jade scrap from East Street, it would be a stretch to sell it for two hundred.” 
Pfft! 
Secretary Gao couldn’t hold back and burst out laughing on the spot… 
Indeed, it was scrap material; they just didn’t want to damage the young lady’s pride by pointing it out. 
It seemed that this woman really did know a bit, or she wouldn’t have recognized it at a glance. noveldrama
Then why not give it a try? 
Secretary Gao pondered for a moment, considering the person he had yet to find, and with Yuzhirun about to make a major investment, he finally bit the bullet and decided to take her to meet the CEO. 
At this point, he was ready to try a desperate remedy. 
But at that moment, the woman’s phone, which was on her person, suddenly rang… 
“Hello?” 
“Ningning, where are you? 
It’s terrible, Xiaobao is missing! 
What do we do?!!” It was Qiao Feiyu, who started crying as soon as the call connected. 
Ye Xiaobao is missing? 
How could that be? 
Upon hearing this news, her expression instantly changed, and, without caring that she was in the middle of an interview, she hurriedly said to the man in front of her, “I’m sorry, I have an urgent matter to handle. 
I’ll come back to you later.” 
“But I…” 
“…” 
Secretary Gao hadn’t even finished speaking when the woman, as if faced with an incredibly important matter, rushed out the door in a flustered state. 
Secretary Gao stood there, completely stunned… 
What’s going on? 
Wasn’t she just aggressively demanding an interview opportunity from him? 
How did she suddenly run off? 
“Secretary Gao? 
The CEO is asking you to prepare the car, he’s going to meet a client.” 
“Oh, okay!” 
Just then, the CEO’s assistant came out to call him, asking him to prepare the car for the CEO who was going to meet a client, so he stuffed the resume in his hand into Xiaochen’s arms: “Get me this person’s full information on my phone.” 
Afterward, he took the keys and went downstairs. 
As long as he had her contact information, he wasn’t worried about her running away! 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, having finished his work, also picked up his briefcase and left the office.
###7: Chapter 7 Suddenly Someone Called Him Daddy!!! 
7 -7 Suddenly Someone Called Him Daddy!!! 
Today’s appointment was with a jade merchant, and this merchant was rumored to have been a supplier to Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry, a Burmese, so he wanted to see just what kind of goods he had supplied to Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry. 
Stepping out of the office, he glanced at his watch and saw that there was less than half an hour left before the appointed time, so he hastened his steps. 
However, to his surprise, when he entered the elevator and reached the ground floor, as the doors opened, he found a crowd of people blocking the way. 
“What’s going on?” 
“Is someone kidnapping a child?” 
Kidnapping a child? 
He stood there, taken aback for a moment! 
In his Ou Family skyscraper, someone was kidnapping a child? 
Ridiculous! 
“Look, that cleaning lady over there, she insists that the two men are traffickers, claiming the child in the bathroom isn’t theirs, and she’s been holding onto them without letting go.” The man, a merchant from the building, failed to recognize that the person emerging from the elevator was the owner of the skyscraper. 
Traffickers? noveldrama
Still unconvinced, he checked the time and saw it was indeed getting late, so he furrowed his brows and planned to push through the people blocking the elevator doors to leave. 
But just as he stepped out of the elevator, the onlooking crowd started to scuffle: “Look, lady, are you annoying or what? 
I already told you, this kid is mine. 
Let go already.” 
“Yeah, lady, you see this child hasn’t spoken a word, which proves we’re not bad people. 
Let go quickly!” 
“…” 
For a moment, the atmosphere among the crowd seemed to turn against the two men, and the cleaning lady who had been grabbing them started to hesitate over whether she should let go. 
Just then, from within the crowd, a milky childish voice suddenly spoke up: “Daddy, where are you going?” 
The voice was sweet and crisp, carrying the distinctive cuteness of a child’s voice, soft and sticky. 
Once he spoke up, the surrounding crowd immediately fell silent, and their gazes followed the direction the child was looking. 
Ou Mucen was also drawn by the sudden piping voice, and turned his head instinctively to look over, and in a flash, he was stunned! 
What’s going on? 
Why were they all staring at him? 
But in that moment of bewilderment, the little one being held by the man stretched out his tiny arms towards him: “Daddy, don’t you want baby anymore? 
Baby will be good and obedient from now on…” 
Thud! 
Two giant teardrops rolled down like a faucet turned full on, falling without the slightest effort! 
Ou Family’s Third Young Master was frozen… 
What? 
What on earth was this scene? 
The surrounding crowd, including the two men and the cleaning lady, were all stupefied! 
Another daddy? 
Then who was the real father? 
Their eyes began to dart back and forth, scrutinizing the faces of the two men involved. 
Then, after a minute, they made an astonishing discovery!! 
This young man standing at the elevator entrance, who looked exceedingly noble and extraordinary, his brows and eyes really did bear a resemblance to the child… 
The cleaning lady was the first to come to her senses: “So he’s the real father!” 
She rushed over, snatched the child from the man’s arms without a word, turned and headed to the elevator, shoving the child into the arms of the still dazed Ou CEO: “Sir, you too, with such a small child, a little punishment for a mistake is enough, isn’t it? 
How could you let him run around like this? 
You know, we almost had an incident.”
###8: Chapter 8: Stupid! 
8 -8: Stupid! 
Ou Mucen: “…” 
He wanted to say something, but suddenly felt a slip in his arms. 
Looking down, he saw that Little Baozi was about to fall and had to quickly catch him. 
As a result, the little rascal, realizing he had been caught, lifted his chubby face again: “Thank you, Daddy…” 
“…” 
Shit! 
Ou Mucen’s face darkened to the extreme! 
However, to the onlookers, this scene only confirmed their suspicions. noveldrama
Being called Daddy and looking so intimately similar, if not him, who else could it be? 
At that moment, everyone’s gaze shifted towards those two men! 
The men hadn’t expected that, just when they were about to succeed, a twist like this would happen. 
Seeing that everyone turned their attention to them, they finally snapped out of it and dashed towards the exit. 
“They’re traffickers! 
They really are traffickers, catch them!” 
“Catch them…” 
“…” 
In just the blink of an eye, only the two figures—one large, one small—were left at the elevator door. 
At this time, the small figure, still held up like a toy doll, was in that same position in the big person’s grip. 
So, those two men really were traffickers planning to kidnap this little one? 
Ou Mucen’s face turned ashen, and he lowered his head to look at Little Baozi in his hand with an icy gaze… 
Cough cough cough cough cough… 
Little Baozi, feeling that murderous look from above, finally cleared his throat and spoke up: “Uncle, I’m sorry for using you just now, I had no choice.” 
Haha, now he’s calling him Uncle? 
He even knows the term “using”? 
Ou Mucen didn’t respond, but noticing that Little Baozi wasn’t even as tall as his leg and had a strong babyish appearance, he softened a bit considering the truly dangerous situation just before: “What happened? 
Where are your parents? 
In such a huge place, they just let you run around?” 
Parents? 
The tiny figure, held in his hand, thought of his mother whom he had been searching for a while without luck and felt dejected: “I can’t find her, she’s gone…” 
It’s all because of this place, why build it so big for no reason? 
Does the owner have too much money to burn? 
But Ou Mucen, the CEO holding him, obviously could not accept such an answer. 
Gone? 
What does that mean? 
Did he get lost or does he not even know who he is? 
Looking at Little Baozi, who could be at most four years old, Ou Mucen was running out of patience. 
Thinking of the client who was waiting for him, he took out his phone and made a call: “Secretary Gao, come to the lobby on the first floor by the elevator. 
There’s something I need you to take care of.” 
Hearing him make a call, Little Baozi seemed to realize that he was going to be handed over to someone else and quickly lifted his little head: “I know my mom’s phone number, Uncle, can you call my mom for me, please?” 
“You know the phone number?” 
“I do!” 
Little Baozi couldn’t stand it when people looked at him as if he were a freak, especially in moments when his intelligence shone through. 
Really, what’s wrong with knowing mom’s phone number? 
Shouldn’t a four-year-old remember their mother’s contact information? 
Idiot! 
Thankfully, although Uncle Bingshan was also surprised, he eventually handed his phone to him. 
Little Baozi’s chubby hand took the phone and promptly, he entered a string of numbers and dialed out.
###9: Chapter 9 She’s Going Crazy 
9 -9 She’s Going Crazy 
“Hello, the number you have dialed is turned off, please try again later!” 
Nani? 
Why did Ye Dabao’s phone turn off? 
What’s going on? 
Little Baozi’s chubby little face crumpled, “Uncle, my mother’s phone is off…” 
Ou Mucen: “…” 
After a long while, with an expressionless face, he took out his own phone, grabbed his collar, and carried him out… 
Damn it, why would he believe what such a small Baozi said? 
Was his mind still scrambled by what happened earlier and not yet clear? 
When the tall and imposing man carried Little Baozi out, his face was utterly dark. 
If it weren’t for the fact that this upscale area was sparsely populated, it might have become a “disaster area.” 
The temper of the third young master of the Ou family was famously explosive! 
—— 
Inside the bustling East District department store of the Ou family property, Ye Ning and Qiao Feiyu searched for their son like headless flies. 
Ye Xiaobao, how could he just disappear? 
Ye Ning had turned frighteningly pale, especially after such a long and fruitless search, her spirit was even worse, wandering through the crowd distraught and spiritless. 
The usually calm person was now so helpless that she started crying. 
“Ningning, it’s all my fault, I shouldn’t have let Xiaobao come here to use the restroom. 
Ningning, hit me, I owe you an apology.” Seeing her like this, Qiao Feiyu felt so guilty that he slapped himself several times, almost wishing he could kneel down and beg for her forgiveness. 
Indeed it was her fault; if she hadn’t been distracted by the cosmetic seller in the department store while following Xiaobao in, she would have known he had finished in the restroom. 
She wouldn’t have been clueless about him wandering off. 
She raised her hand, about to strike herself again! 
Seeing this, Ye Ning couldn’t bear to watch. 
She turned around, intercepted her, and began to force herself to calm down, “Don’t panic, we shouldn’t panic. 
Xiaobao… 
Xiaobao remembers my phone number, yes, he will call me…” 
Finally, she remembered this very important detail and immediately took her phone out. 
But what made her wish she could slap herself was the realization that her phone was out of battery!! 
“See, I told you to buy a better phone, look at this, it’s out of battery again in just half a day. 
What do we do now?” Qiao Feiyu was also jumping with frustration upon seeing this. 
The phone is out of battery, and the child is missing. 
What do they do now? 
Just as the two of them stood there, frenzied as headless flies, suddenly, two people who had returned from shopping in the VIP high-end area happened to walk past: “It’s really unexpected, even in a big department store like the Ou family’s, there could still be human traffickers.” 
“Isn’t that the truth? 
If it weren’t for the child’s father showing up in time, things would have been finished.” 
“Exactly, seeing how brazen the traffickers have become, the Ou family department store needs to heighten their vigilance…” 
“…” 
Ou family department store? 
Human traffickers? 
The moment these words were uttered, Ye Ning and Qiao Feiyu both reacted in an instant, grabbing the two passersby! 
“What are you doing?” noveldrama
“Sorry, sorry, we just wanted to ask about the human traffickers and the matter with the child you just mentioned, what exactly happened?” Ye Ning asked, clutching at them like a lifeline, both anxious and desperate to know.
###10: Chapter 10 Oh My God, The Third Young Master Picked Up a Child! 
10 -10 Oh My God, The Third Young Master Picked Up a Child! 
Upon hearing this, the two women finally calmed down a bit, “So that’s what happened. 
Yeah, just now, over in the VIP area, two men were insisting that a child was theirs, and then a cleaning lady resolutely refused to let go, saying it doesn’t look like him. 
And then the child’s real father showed up, and sure enough, it wasn’t their child.” 
The child’s father? 
As soon as they heard these few words, they felt a sinking feeling in the pit of their stomachs! 
Their Ye Xiaobao didn’t have a father… 
But Qiao Feiyu still didn’t give up hope. 
After hearing what the two shoppers said, she asked if there were any photos from the time to take a look at. 
Luckily, these shoppers had taken photos of the commotion when it happened. 
Of course, part of the reason was that the child’s real father was just too handsome, and they couldn’t help themselves. 
And so, these two women who had been frantically searching the mall like madwomen for two entire hours finally got to see the child on the shoppers’ phone, and of course, the man who took the child away. 
But to their great surprise, the child in the phone was indeed their little Baozi, four years old, growing up to be incredibly delicate and cute. 
But the man holding Baozi… 
“Ningning, why do I feel like I’ve seen this guy somewhere before?” 
Ye Ning didn’t reply, but her gaze suddenly shifted to the enormous LED advertising board hanging inside the mall! 
It was the most valuable and eye-catching billboard in the mall—and also the real owner of the European brand flagship of the building! 
Dressed in a black suit, tall and straight, stunningly handsome as though carved from jade, even if it was just a photograph, his exquisite features and the elegant and noble aura he exuded made Ye Ning sense that high and lofty king-like demeanor, prideful and indifferent, looking down upon the world. 
It was over, things had escalated now… 
—— 
Ou Mucen directly took the child to the meeting place with the client because Secretary Gao had said that he was responsible for finding the child’s mother and had no time to look after the child for the time being. 
So, he asked the CEO to bring the child along, considering that the meeting place was also a newly developed business area of the Ou Corporation. 
Once they got there, someone would take care of the child. noveldrama
Thus, after Ou Mucen arrived, with a phone call he had someone take the child to the office in the development area, and then he went to meet the client. 
At this, Ye Xiaobao was very upset! 
Could he not just go home properly? 
Being taken around in circles, the car journey so long, how was he supposed to know where this place was? 
Ye Dabao, come and find me… 
“Little friend, are you really a child picked up by the third young master?” 
It’s you who’s picked up, your whole family is picked up! 
Ye Xiaobao was quite unhappy, jumping down from the sofa. 
Seeing the environment was very unfamiliar, he climbed up to the window sill to take a look outside, “Grandpa, where is this? 
How come I’ve never seen it before?” 
Grandpa?!! 
The manager in charge of looking after the child in the development area, who had just turned forty, nearly fell to the ground when he heard this. 
Grandpa? 
Was he that old? 
He was only forty this year!! 
Reluctantly walking over and seeing Little Baozi looking out at the area, which happened to be the newly opened flagship jewelry store of the Ou brand, he replied in an indifferent tone, “This is the newly developed commercial area of the Ou Corporation. 
What, do you want to go down and play a bit?” 
Baozi shook his head! 
Nonsense, with so many people around, why would he want to go down and play?
###11: Chapter 11: The First Time The Third Young Master Ou was Crushed by IQ 
11 -11: The First Time The Third Young Master Ou was Crushed by IQ 
What he needed to do now was to figure out their location, then wait for Ye Dabao to turn on her phone so he could call her and tell her he was here. 
As he was peering out the window, Ou Mucen, who had finally finished with his client, entered and saw the manager standing there, not even reacting as the child stuck half his body out the window. 
His face immediately darkened, “Do you want him to fall to his death?” 
The manager shuddered! 
“Pre… 
President…” 
Ye Xiaobao also heard Uncle Bingshan’s voice from behind, so his little body quickly scrambled down from the windowsill, “Uncle, have you found Little Baozi’s mother?” 
Little Baozi? 
So this kid is called Little Baozi? 
The man, who hadn’t spoken much to him since bringing him back, looked down at the little bundle coming towards him, not tall enough to reach his leg, worried about stepping on him. 
He lifted the child by the back of the collar and plonked him back onto the table, “What exactly is your mother’s name?” 
“Ningning…” 
“What Ningning am I asking about?” 
What Ningning? 
Ye Ning? 
Or An Ning? 
The plump Little Baozi sitting on the table, recalling how Uncle Lin called his mother and the name on her ID card, felt confused for the first time, “I… 
I don’t know, do you need a full name to find someone?” 
“What do you think?” 
Little Baozi blinked his two big, grape-like eyes, and after a while, his chubby little face looked up at the man who always seemed to be in a bad mood, “Then perhaps, you could post a ‘Lost Child Found’ notice?” 
Ou Mucen: “…” 
Is this really a four-year-old child? 
He even knows about lost child notices, excellent! 
The man narrowed his eyes, his slender and beautiful fingers tapping on the table where Baozi was sitting. 
After a moment, he picked up the phone and made a call, “No need to search further, just take him to the police station.” 
Ye Xiaobao: “…” 
Suddenly, he stood up on the table, with the same manner and the same disgruntled gaze, glaring at this strange uncle who didn’t keep his word, “Why are you sending me to the police station? 
I’m not an orphan!” 
Do only orphans get sent to the police station? 
The man gave him a cold glance, not at all prepared to yield because he was a child, “Didn’t you say you were a lost child? 
Lost children are a matter for the police.” 
Ye Xiaobao wilted… 
No, he didn’t want to go to the police station. 
He hadn’t done anything wrong, this bad uncle. 
After all, he was just a four-year-old child. 
Scared by these words, his little face turned red around the eyes, and a tear, with a plop, fell down, “Bad uncle, I don’t want you anymore. noveldrama
I want to find Ye Dabao, Dabao…” 
His crying was heart-wrenching! 
Ou Mucen was dumbstruck! 
Wasn’t he just arguing back joyfully? 
How could he suddenly burst into tears like this? 
Where had his earlier defiance gone? 
Ou Mucen, the youngest of the Ous, probably hadn’t realized himself that he hadn’t treated this Little Baozi as a child at all. 
As an unmarried man, he had spent his 28 years of life dealing with various kinds of data and people in the business world, but when had he ever interacted with children? 
Moreover, Ye Xiaobao had been an extraordinarily intelligent presence from the moment he appeared in front of him, like a little adult. 
So, when Secretary Gao finally found the child’s mother outside and brought her here, as soon as she pushed the door open, this was the scene she saw…
###12: Chapter 12 The Mother of the Child Finally Arrived 
12 -12 The Mother of the Child Finally Arrived noveldrama
Little Baozi, sitting on the desk, was crying a river, tears and snot all over the place, and the man next to him? 
He seemed completely out of his depth, trying to console the child with words that sounded uglier than curses, which only made Little Baozi cry harder. 
In his frenzy, he attempted to hold Little Baozi. 
And then, a scene even more infuriating and convulsive ensued! 
The small, chubby Baozi was abruptly grabbed by the chest, like lifting some , and raised up with one hand: “I warn you, if you keep crying, I will throw you down from here!” 
Indeed, children are a horrifying creature! 
Secretary Gao was stunned, fearing that Mr. 
President might actually toss Baozi out, so he stood at the spot and shouted instantly, “Third Young Master!! 
The child’s mother has been found!!” 
Found? 
In the office, the tumultuous voices finally fell silent, including the devastating cries of Baozi! 
Ye Dabao had actually managed to find this place? 
It was truly a miracle! 
Little Baozi hiccupped, and at last, he decided to turn his head to see if their Ye Dabao had really come. 
But with that slight movement, the tyrannical uncle who was still holding him put him down on the desk and turned around to coldly gaze at the door: “Let her in!” 
His voice was icy, and the tone carried a tang of gunpowder that could be detected from a great distance! 
Secretary Gao stood there, and upon hearing this, his legs went weak instantly: “Miss An, you should go in yourself, your child is inside, and our president… 
is also inside.” 
He truly didn’t dare to enter, terrified even by the atmosphere he perceived. 
The woman following behind also heard the voice inside, and instantly, her palms tensed again, and after a long pause, she nodded her head. 
The president of the Ou Corporation, the third young master of the Ou Family, in A City, that was a household legend, a personage of enormous stature. 
It was heard that the old Mr. 
Ou started from scratch in the jade stone business. 
In his early years, he had a son and a daughter with his first wife. 
The daughter, being the elder, had married off early, leaving the son to marry early as well and to help manage the Ou family enterprise alongside the old Mr. 
Ou. 
Just when everyone thought that this second son would undoubtedly inherit all of the old Mr. 
Ou’s fortune, suddenly, after many years of widowhood and past fifty years of age, the old Mr. 
Ou brought a woman home and declared her his new wife, changing the heavens of the Ou Family in an instant. 
First, the second son questioned the woman’s motives, and then, old Ye’s daughter came to persuade with every argument, claiming the woman was only after his money and didn’t truly care for him. 
They bickered endlessly, but in the end, the old Mr. 
Ou did not pay any heed and forcefully wed the woman into the family. 
She proved her worth by bearing him another son a year later, and this son was the Third Young Master of the Ou Family—Ou Mucen! 
And it was this Ou Mucen who later became the greatest threat to the second son, leading to the escalation of conflicts within the entire Ou Corporation. 
Just how favored was Ou Mucen? 
Others in A City might not know, but the woman standing at the door was absolutely clear on it. 
Back in those days, in that household, everyone had to bow to this young master in reverence as they did to the old Mr. 
Ou. 
Every word from the young master was like an imperial edict, and the servants of the Ou Family, including the company employees, all had to drop whatever they were doing to run his errands. 
Otherwise, they would be instantly dismissed from the Ou Corporation and would never find a second job again.
###13: Chapter 13: Has he seen her there before? 
13 -13: Has he seen her there before? 
It was precisely because of this reason that everyone in the Ou Family was particularly fearful of this wastrel heir. 
No one dared to cross this second-generation rich kid. 
The woman stood there, took several deep breaths to compose herself, and then slowly pushed open the door to the office. 
After that, she finally saw the man whom she hadn’t seen in many years! 
Five years had passed, and the passage of time had made him even more mature and steady. 
His tall figure casually leaned against the large office desk. 
The well-tailored black suit outlined his broad shoulders and lean waist, with his legs lazily crossed. 
Just by looking at him from here, he was handsomely ethereal, as if sculpted. 
At 28, a man is at the prime of his life. 
“Mr. 
Ou, hello, my name is An Ning. 
I… 
am the mother of this child.” She tried her best to avoid looking into his eyes, to not reveal anything under his strong presence. 
However, to her surprise, after she finished speaking, the man standing in the office was silent for quite some time. 
His eyes, devoid of any warmth, continued to scan her coldly. 
She was also a woman one wouldn’t easily forget after seeing her—her unfamiliar features, her plain and overly modest attire which made her unremarkable at first glance. 
Yet for some reason? 
When he saw her eyes, he felt as if he had encountered them before, somewhere in the back of his mind. 
Those eyes were clear and bright, like a spring in the desert. 
A glance would reveal the glassy-colored pupils, cool and bright, incredibly luminous. 
Had he seen this woman somewhere before? 
He slightly furrowed his brows and finally spoke, “You’re the child’s mother?” 
The woman hurriedly nodded, “Yes, I am his mother. 
I am very grateful to Mr. 
Ou for saving my child. 
Thank you, I am truly very thankful.” 
To express her gratitude, she stood there and gave him a very sincere bow. 
Saving her child was a great kindness to her. 
No matter their previous grievances, at that moment, her gratitude was heartfelt. 
But strangely, when he saw her bow, there was silence again. 
When she looked up, she noticed his gaze had stopped on her right wrist, the one she had just brushed her hair with. 
What was he looking at? noveldrama
Feeling a jolt of alarm, she immediately used her bag to discreetly shield her hand, turning her wrist in a different direction to cover it. 
It was a blue enchantress, tattooed to cover a scar. 
She didn’t want him to notice anything. 
With her hand hidden, she looked up and saw her child across from her. 
Without paying any more attention to the man, she hurried over, “Xiaobao, are you all right? 
Come down here to mommy.” 
Ye Xiaobao was also unsettled by the strange atmosphere, and upon hearing his mother’s call, the small boy began to climb down from the office desk, moving in her direction. 
But just at that moment, the weird uncle who had been silent in front of him suddenly spoke up, “How old are you?” 
What? 
The woman, who had just reached her son’s side, was startled by the question, “What?” 
“I’m asking how old are you this year?” 
How old? 
Once again, the woman was confused but still answered truthfully, “23!”
###14: Chapter 14 This Spoiled Second Generation! 
14 -14 This Spoiled Second Generation! 
23! 
Just as expected! 
A disdainful sneer spread in the office, and finally, the man who had been leaning there motionless, stood up and sat down in the boss chair behind the desk, “So you’re saying when you had this child, you were only about 19, 19 years old, haha, Miss An, you really are not typically frivolous!” 
What does that mean? 
The woman’s complexion immediately changed, “What are you saying? 
Frivolous?” 
What does frivolous mean? 
Why does he say that her having a child at 19 is being frivolous? 
Could it be that he has discovered something? 
The woman stood there, her heart suddenly clenched! 
“What do you mean by that, Mr. 
Ou? 
What do you mean by ‘frivolous’?” 
“Can’t you understand? 
Because you haven’t met the qualifications to be a mother, that’s why I called you frivolous, don’t you get it?” 
“…” 
It took quite a few seconds, but the woman standing there finally digested his words. 
Not qualified to be a mother? 
So, the reason he had been asking about her age just now wasn’t because he knew about her past, but because, after what happened to Xiaobao today, he thought it was a mother’s extreme irresponsibility that caused it, and after learning her age, he had completely decided it was because she was too young when she gave birth to him? 
My God!!! 
Ye Ning felt for the first time what it meant to be maddened with rage! 
It turns out that after so many years, the way this second-generation heir of the Ou family confuses right and wrong had not changed at all! 
Ye Ning finally felt a surge of anger rise from her chest, whether he agreed or not, she reached out and directly took her son into her arms, “Mr. 
Ou, I am grateful that you saved my child, and I am very sorry that he disturbed you for an afternoon, but you have no right to criticize whether I am fit to be a mother.” 
That’s right, he, a single man who had never married or had children, what right did he have to judge whether she was qualified to be a mother? 
However, what infuriated her was that this man just sneered at her correction, “I’m not criticizing, that’s the fact. 
As a child’s mother, you didn’t even take proper care of his basic safety, what else could this be if not negligence?” 
“You—” 
“Moreover, it has been over three hours since the incident, you’ve been out of contact with your child for that long. 
If this was abroad, you would already be facing the risk of losing your custodial rights.” 
“…” 
Ye Ning trembled with rage but found herself speechless. 
This utterly despicable second-generation heir, why, after five years, when so many people and things had changed, had his spitefulness and ruthlessness remained the same? 
With such groundless accusations, didn’t he feel any pang of conscience? 
Standing there, she forced herself to calm down for a very, very long time, and finally, she cooled down, “Yes, Mr. 
Ou, what you said is not wrong; the child getting lost is my fault for not taking care of him, I am to blame. 
But Mr. 
Ou, as Ou Family Department Store, known as a star-level department store in the city, you also failed to ensure basic security measures, don’t you think you bear responsibility too?” noveldrama
“What did you say?” 
“Am I wrong? 
In this world, which child hasn’t gotten lost from their parents? 
Today you blame me because my child faced danger, claiming it’s because I gave birth too young and didn’t fulfill a mother’s duty. 
Then what if tomorrow, another child encounters the same danger? 
What excuse will you find then? 
When something happens at Ou Family, do you just find someone else to blame?” 
!!!!!!
###15: Chapter 15: Don’t Bully Mommy 
15 -15: Don’t Bully Mommy 
A sentence fell, and the office became utterly silent! 
It was the silence of death, as if a storm was about to burst forth. 
At this moment, the atmosphere in the office was so terrifying that it made breathing difficult. 
Ye Xiaobao was scared and desperately burrowed into his mother’s embrace… 
Mommy, this uncle is so scary! 
Ye Ning too was startled by the sudden drop in temperature in the air, and glanced at the man sitting across from her. 
She saw him sitting there, his entire persona seemingly enveloped in an aura of intense darkness. 
Her face turned white for a moment, and she turned to leave. 
“Someone, make a phone call to Director Li for me. 
Tell him there’s a child here at Ou’s Department Store who was nearly abducted, and ask him to come and handle this.” 
“…” 
Ye Ning stood there, instantly turning back around! 
Director Li? 
The police station? 
What exactly does he want to do? 
Ye Ning was on the verge of collapsing, clutching her child tightly as she rushed over and stood in front of his desk: “What exactly do you want? 
Is this fun for you? 
Isn’t it just about saving my child? 
Tell me, how much money do you want?” 
She was truly desperate, asking a filthy rich second-generation heir how much money he wanted! 
Ou Mucen sat there, watching coldly. 
He said nothing and made no move, yet the expression that screamed he wanted to slap him twice with a shoe told her— 
This was no game to him! noveldrama
Ye Ning felt like she was going insane! 
Just as she was about to bite her tongue and humble herself with a few soft words to him, at that moment, the child she had been holding struggled out of her arms. 
“Xiaobao…” 
“Uncle, that’s enough! 
My mommy is a woman, and you keep bullying her. 
What kind of man does that make you? 
What kind of capability is this? 
If you’re capable, come at me, let’s settle this matter between men, man to man!” 
“…” 
For a good three seconds, the office suddenly erupted with the sound of someone violently coughing: “Cough cough cough cough cough…” 
Damn! 
It’s like being worse than dead, isn’t it? 
Little Baozi, watching from the side, was still not satisfied: “Don’t think you can avoid my question by pretending to cough. 
I’m telling you, if you’re a man, let’s sit down and talk properly; don’t take it out on a woman. 
It would make me lose respect for you!” 
Cough cough cough cough… 
Oh great, the coughing got worse! 
Ye Ning looked on worriedly, realizing that in such a place, with such a character, she didn’t want to be involved in a fatality. 
So, she quickly looked around and saw a water dispenser not far away, hurried over, and brought him a cup of water: “Mr. 
Ou, are you okay? 
Here, drink some water first, you’ll feel better.” 
In just a few seconds, the woman’s voice and demeanor had completely changed, no longer the sharp anger confronting him head-on, but now one of concern and care. 
After she finished speaking, the man who had been coughing severely in his seat miraculously felt the discomfort in his throat slowly ease. 
“Uncle, are you okay? 
Doctor Uncle said that smoking is harmful to health. 
You shouldn’t smoke anymore in the future.” At the critical moment, Little Baozi also came over. 
Seeing him still coughing, he stretched out his chubby little hand, stood on tiptoe, and patted his back. 
Ou Mucen was stunned! 
The scene was strange no matter how one looked at it—as if… 
a family of three? 
He must be seeing things!
###16: Chapter 16 Has Yang Xueshan Already Become Ou Yuze’s Woman? 
16 -16 Has Yang Xueshan Already Become Ou Yuze’s Woman? 
Just as the three of them remained there in a rather ambiguous scene, someone suddenly came in from the outside, “Third Young Master, it’s bad, downstairs at our newly opened jewelry store, someone is causing a scene…” 
At this point, upon seeing such an unusual scene in the office, his mouth hung open, and the second half of his sentence got stuck in his throat. 
Good Lord, what on earth were they doing? 
Could it be that during the half-hour he was gone, this mother and son had already won over his BOSS, and the atmosphere had become as cordial as if they were family? 
Wasn’t this just too horrifying? 
Secretary Gao felt as if he had seen a ghost! 
Fortunately, Ye Ning had quick reflexes. 
As soon as she saw him enter, she immediately put down the water glass in her hand and pulled over the child who had been patting the man’s back, “Mr. 
Gao, Mr. 
Ou was coughing severely just now, so I… 
poured him a glass of water to drink.” 
Is that what happened? 
Secretary Gao looked over at his own master, but unexpectedly, just as his gaze shifted, two icy cold stares were hurled his way, “All flustered, what has happened?” 
Secretary Gao shuddered, finally remembering the purpose of his visit! 
“Here’s the thing, when I was doing a routine inspection of our new store downstairs, I heard someone claiming that the jewelry they bought from Yuzhirun was fake, and that person is the popular celebrity Yao Peipei, who has bought jewelry worth millions and has brought a bunch of reporters over.” 
“…” 
The jewelry store downstairs, which was Mucen’s first VIP flagship store heavily invested in after entering the jewelry business, specialized in jade and marked Yuzhirun’s first step in this industry. 
Therefore, this jewelry store was regarded highly not only by the executives of the Ou Family’s third branch but also by Mucen himself. 
But now, someone was actually stirring up trouble? 
And it was a popular film and television star? 
In just one second, the warmth of his body had entirely dissipated, and this drop in temperature was different from the chill he felt when he was agitated by Ye Ning and her son earlier. 
This time, it was a palpable, suffocating murderous aura. 
“Have you thoroughly checked out what Yao Peipei’s background is?” 
“Yes, I have. 
She’s from Starlight Entertainment Company, and the hidden shareholder behind Starlight is Yang Xueshan, Third Young Master, you are aware of her. 
She is Yu Ze’s woman,” Secretary Gao said, his face turning quite unsightly. 
So, there was no need to guess who was behind this disturbance—it was another ploy by the Ou Family’s second branch! 
Long and beautiful fingers tapped lightly on the office desk. 
The man who hadn’t moved at all in his seat let a trace of chilling amusement emerge from his eyes, “No rush, let her play for a while. 
Go call NGTC and ask them to send two people over.” 
“Right away, Third Young Master!” noveldrama
Secretary Gao promptly left to carry out the task upon hearing this. 
Yang Xueshan? 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, who was still holding the child, had her pupils shrink abruptly when she heard this name; instantly, they transformed into two chilly daggers that fiercely sliced through the air in front of her. 
Yang Xueshan, so she is now Yu Ze’s woman? 
She remembered the day five years ago in the courthouse when that woman stood in front of her with such a virtuous fa?ade, explaining why she had become a discard, why she was used by others, and why that man did not love her? 
It turned out she had her sights on that man all along! 
This was her best friend, her closest confidante! 
Ha…
###17: Chapter 17 Are you worried about your uncle, Mom? 
17 -17 Are you worried about your uncle, Mom? 
A cold sneer spread across her lips, and her fingers began to tighten inch by inch until her sharp nails dug deep into her flesh. 
Only then did she realize that someone in the office was speaking. 
“Eh? 
Miss An, why haven’t you left yet?” 
“…” 
Ye Ning was momentarily stunned! 
Leave? 
She lifted her eyes to the desk and noticed that the man who had been sitting in the chair had, unbeknownst to her, already left the place. 
So, did this mean he was not going to hold her accountable? 
Ye Ning finally sighed in relief, and bringing her son with her, she remembered what the man had said earlier and couldn’t help but gossip, “Mr. 
Gao, are you going to invite someone from the NGTC over?” 
Secretary Gao nodded, “Yes, the NGTC is the national authority for gemstone certification. 
Yuzhirun is just starting out and we haven’t been able to hire professional-grade appraisers yet. 
At a time like this, it’s better to have them come over.” 
So that was it! 
Ye Ning also agreed with this approach. 
Indeed, when there’s a commotion about fakes in a jewelry store, the best thing to do is to have an appraiser there on the spot. 
But Ou Mucen was pretty impressive; his company hadn’t hired an appraiser yet, but he had brought in the NGTC. 
The NGTC, huh? 
Are they someone just anyone can ask for help? 
It’s a national organization that works for the government; if you don’t have the right connections, who would give you such regard? noveldrama
So Ye Ning just gave a slight nod, took her child by the hand, and left the place. 
“Xiaobao, are you hungry?” 
Ye Xiaobao’s big eyes immediately lit up, “Mommy, are you going to treat me to something to eat?” 
Ye Ning looked down at him and smiled, “Of course I can. 
Look, there’s KFC right over there. 
How about I take you there to eat?” 
KFC? 
Ye Xiaobao glanced at the KFC next to the jewelry store that was making a fuss downstairs, just outside the window, and his little face immediately turned sour, “Mommy, are you worried about uncle?” 
“What are you talking about?” 
“Isn’t it? 
You always told me that KFC is junk food and eating too much of it isn’t good for your health. 
But now, seeing it next to the jewelry store, you’re taking me there.” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
Suddenly, her face reddened, and with a slap to the little head, she opened her mouth to chastise, “What nonsense are you spouting? 
At such a young age, all you think about is all kinds of nonsense. 
If you don’t want to eat, then forget it. 
Let’s go, we’re going home!” 
Ye Xiaobao immediately clung to his mother’s leg, “Eat eat eat, it doesn’t matter what Mommy takes Xiaobao to eat, Xiaobao will like it.” 
That was the sycophantic Ye Xiaobao! 
Really, why make an enemy of food? 
Let Ye Dabao do whatever he wants, as long as he doesn’t interfere with his eating. 
But Ye Xiaobao hadn’t expected that once he successfully kept this woman from leaving, she would actually take out her phone and dial a number, “Hello? 
Xiaoyu, this is Ye Ning. 
Come to Century Lotus Plaza in the development zone, I’ll treat you to coffee…” 
Ye Xiaobao: “…” 
Ye Dabao, you’ve done enough. 
Even though I’m easy to take care of, drinking coffee isn’t good for the growth of children!! 
—— 
Meanwhile, inside Yuzhirun Jewelry Store, the commotion caused by the celebrity scandal had already made quite a fuss in this newly developed plaza, drawing reporters, onlookers, and various gossip enthusiasts to the scene. 
There was no helping it. 
Although Yuzhirun was a new brand, the company behind it was the well-known Ou family in this city. 
Naturally, any issue with its products attracted nationwide attention and those media reporters were definitely going to seize this opportunity to gain maximum exposure.
###18: Chapter 18: Today is Really Lively 
18 -18: Today is Really Lively 
Secretary Gao led the NGTC gem appraisers into the jewelry store, where the crowd had already become so dense that it was water-tight. 
Even more media reporters had gathered around the jade display case, and they were furiously snapping photos of something at the moment. 
“Miss Yao Peipei, may I ask if the jewelry you’re wearing was purchased here today?” 
“Of course, I came here specifically because of the Ouyang family’s promotion. 
They announced that their new brand Yuzhirun would launch many new products on their opening day with attractive prices and fresh styles. 
That’s the reason I came, but what a disappointment I’ve had!” 
“…” 
The woman standing amid the media, dressed in an extremely cool strappy off-the-shoulder outfit, her finely featured face framed by voluminous golden waves and concealed behind a pair of sunglasses, simply stood there, her long legs and tempting curves already eliciting screams from the onlookers. 
This was none other than the hottest film and television star of the moment, Yao Peipei. 
Secretary Gao looked at the scene with a flash of anger in his eyes, turned to two NGTC appraisers beside him, and said, “Go take a look; President Ouyang is watching from the surveillance room above this jewelry store.” 
“Understood, rest assured, the items purchased by you three young masters have been professionally appraised by us at the NGTC. 
We know exactly what their quality is like,” replied the two appraisers, immediately moving to action. 
“Make way, make way, the jewelry appraisers are here, step aside!” 
“…” 
The appraisers are coming? 
Is the young master Ouyang finally responding to this incident? 
Seeing these two appraisers appear, the crowd in the store immediately started bustling, and the media raised their cameras, taking rapid snaps of the two as they approached. 
However, when they saw the badges the two were wearing, everyone was stunned! 
NGTC? 
Isn’t that the National Gemstone Testing Center, the authoritative national institution? 
The Ouyang family actually invited them over this time?!! 
For a moment, everyone’s gaze was fixed on the two appraisers, and they stood frozen, including the woman who had been interviewed by them just before. 
The NGTC is not just any institution; it represents the highest national authority. 
The items they appraise are generally considered to be the most authentic. noveldrama
Whether real or fake, once they have come to a conclusion, it is beyond doubt. 
The shop quieted down, and even the woman named Yao Peipei stopped her flirtatious posturing and focused on the two appraisers approaching. 
NGTC gem appraisers? 
How did they get involved? 
For a moment, her complexion subtly shifted… 
In the café, Qiao Feiyu, who was observing the scene with a pair of binoculars, laughed, “Ningning, that little star seems scared, doesn’t she?” 
Really? 
Ye Ning, who was fixing a milk tea for her son, glanced down at the bustling jewelry store below when she heard this. 
Indeed, her expression was somewhat unnatural. 
However, when Ye Ning’s gaze drifted to something outside, suddenly, all seemed to calm down, and her expression returned to naturalness, even more composed and bewitching than before. 
Could it be… 
that there’s something over there? 
Ye Ning subconsciously followed the direction the woman had been looking and noticed a very luxuriously decorated fashion store. 
Inside, a young woman in a light yellow tulip-printed miniskirt was leisurely sitting on the red sofa wearing sunglasses, casually flipping through a magazine.
###19: Chapter 19 The Game is Just Beginning… 
19 -19 The Game is Just Beginning… 
Wearing sunglasses inside the store while reading a magazine? 
So the truth lies here! 
Ye Ning recalled the woman who even wore sunglasses when she came to see her at the courthouse, and she smiled coldly, retracting her gaze, “Just wait, it’s not so easy for a little star to step over.” 
“Huh?” Qiao Feiyu didn’t quite understand. 
At this moment, down in the jewelry store, preparations for the confrontation had already begun… 
“Miss Yao Peipei, please take out the jewelry and the receipt you bought from our store. 
These two are appraisers from the NGTC, and they will now authenticate your items to see if the Ou Family’s jewelry is fake or not?” 
Secretary Gao had a bad temper and got straight to the point upon arriving, directly asking the woman surrounded by the media to take out her jewelry. 
The woman was staring at the two appraisers when she heard this. 
She moved her gaze slightly and, after a moment, her provocative red lips curled into a slight smile, “Alright, I’m quite pleased with the speed of the Ou Family’s response this time. 
Come on, the jewelry is all here.” 
Secretary Gao gave her a cold stare! 
A mere little star dared to cause trouble on the turf of their Third Young Master? 
Had she not heard of the methods of their Third Young Master? 
Very well! 
Let’s see how you cry later. 
Secretary Gao took out the set of jewelry, took it over, and immediately opened it in front of everyone on that counter… 
It was indeed a set of extremely beautiful and dazzling jewelry. 
The gemstones were all emerald green and dripping with color, with K-gold inlaid with small diamonds on the side. 
The style of the jewelry was droplet-shaped, simple yet luxurious, elegant but not lacking in grandeur! 
Indeed, it was reflective of the Third Young Master’s style. 
Even without the decades-old brand reputation of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry, this jade adorned jewel, whether it was the craftsmanship, the design, or the exuded quality, was not inferior to the original. 
Many people were amazed… 
“It’s really beautiful!” 
“Yeah, I think the pieces from the old brand Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry are not any better than this. 
It seems the Third Young Master really is an impressive figure.” 
“Isn’t that the truth? 
However, it would be a pity if it turns out to be fake…” 
“…” 
Many people in the store began to discuss. 
Seeing this, Secretary Gao quickly called over the two appraisers, laid the jewelry out on the counter, and let them start their work. 
He himself then made an “OK” sign to the camera above the jewelry store after spotting it. 
That was a surveillance camera installed in the jewelry store office, and at that moment, in front of the monitor displaying that camera’s feed, stood a tall and lean man, indifferently smoking a cigarette. 
“Third Master, we just discovered that Yang Xueshan is in a clothing store across the street,” the assistant said as he entered. 
“Is that so?” 
The man, who had been feeling a bit bored sitting there, suddenly found the news interesting. 
He took the mobile phone from the assistant’s hand, and when he saw the photo it contained—a photo of a woman in the clothing store—and indeed it was the woman the assistant referred to, the cold, sinister smile in his eyes deepened. 
Don’t rush, enjoy the game slowly… 
—— noveldrama
Downstairs in the jewelry store, the tense and highly anticipated authentication process was unfolding in an orderly manner. 
Since the main character of this incident was the Ou Group, many media outlets were broadcasting live, including the authentication process.
###20: Chapter 20: Is It Really Fake? 
20 -20: Is It Really Fake? 
“Ladies and gentlemen, now we are live from the newly opened Yuzhirun Jewelry store, which has been the subject of intense public attention this morning due to the allegations of fraud,” the host began. 
“Here, we can already see the professional appraisers from NGTC beginning their authentication.” 
“Ladies and gentlemen, the appraisers are from the authoritative NGTC, personally invited by Yuzhirun Jewelry, which shows just how seriously they are taking this matter.” 
“Ladies and gentlemen, the results will be revealed shortly…” 
“…” 
Extensive media coverage and online buzz had turned this place into the focal point of the city’s attention; even the official television station had made their way here. 
And so, at this moment, everyone’s eyes were glued to this jewelry store. 
It was then, amid the bustling crowd inside the shop, that the ongoing authentication process came to an end. 
The sound of the precise instrument emitted a “beep” and stopped, and in an instant, all other sounds went silent! 
It was indeed a moment of eager anticipation! 
In the coffee shop, Qiao Feiyu, who was watching intently with binoculars, turned to her companion. 
“Ningning, quick, the results are about to come out. 
What do you think, is the jewelry real or fake?” 
Real or fake? 
Ye Ning, who was busy preparing a milk tea for her son, hadn’t once glanced in that direction. 
“Let’s wait and see. 
The real drama is about to start,” she said without concern. 
“What did you say?” 
Qiao Feiyu hadn’t fully understood. 
“Real drama? 
What drama?” 
It was at this moment that a wave of commotion suddenly erupted from inside the jewelry store. noveldrama
Many people started to become restless. 
Some were indignant, others were beating their chests and stamping their feet. 
It seemed as if something utterly unexpected had occurred. 
So, was the jewelry fake?!! 
Qiao Feiyu was shocked and put down her binoculars. 
She looked at the woman across from her, her expression one of sheer astonishment. 
“Is it really fake?” 
Hmph! 
The young woman, after finishing the milk tea, responded with a cold laugh. 
“Of course it’s fake. 
Someone had their eye on it, it wasn’t meant to pass as real,” Ye Ning stated indifferently. 
“What did you say?” 
“Nothing much, Feiyu,” Ye Ning replied, “could you watch Xiaobao for me? 
I need to go to the restroom.” 
Qiao Feiyu: “…” 
No, what’s up with this woman? 
Mid-conversation and she wants to leave—what’s real and what’s fake? 
And wasn’t Yuzhirun the place she wanted to apply for a job today? 
Now that they’re embroiled in scandal, assuming they fall from grace, how will she still work there? 
Qiao Feiyu felt the woman’s reaction was way too unusual… 
Picking up her binoculars and looking back at the store, Qiao Feiyu saw that with the release of the authentication results, the women left inside the shop became even more triumphant. 
“Mr. 
Gao, I’m truly sorry. 
I came to your Ou’s Jewelry store out of respect for its reputation, but now you’ve sold me a fake. 
How am I supposed to explain this to my friends in the circle? 
They came to your store to buy jewelry today, all on my account.” 
“You—” 
Secretary Gao felt close to madness with how quickly things had turned for the worse. 
Seeing many media still snapping photos of their jewelry store, as well as the authentication certificates in the hands of the two appraisers, he snatched them in a panic. 
“There must be some misunderstanding. 
Everybody, please calm down. 
Listen to me, Yuzhirun may be a new brand, but we would never sell fakes to you.”
###21: Chapter 21: What the hell? 
Who is that woman? 
21 -21: What the hell? 
Who is that woman? 
“Well, Mr. 
Gao, this is the result certified by the most authoritative national jewelry appraisal institution that you specially invited. 
Could there be any falsehood in this? 
In my opinion, you should make a call to your Third Young Master Ou, and let him give everyone an explanation, otherwise, for such a large company of his, selling fake goods is going to damage its reputation.” 
The woman, having got a bargain, had no intention of letting go of this newly opened jewelry store, pressing them with every word she said. 
As a result, with her instigation, the other people in the store started to echo her: “Right, we can’t let the Ou Family get away with this just because they are a large company in A City. 
We need the person in charge to give an explanation.” 
“Third Young Master Ou, come out and give an explanation!” 
“Ou Mucen, come out!” 
“…” 
In the end, the indignant shouting of this group of people was so loud that it almost burst the jewelry store apart. 
Secretary Gao was beginning to get anxious and quickly glanced at the surveillance camera overhead. 
His face was as worried as could be: “Third Young Master…” 
Meanwhile, in the jewelry store office, the man sitting in front of the surveillance monitor also saw this scene. 
As soon as the result came out and he saw the surging crowd that was almost tearing his store apart, he suddenly narrowed his eyes, and a killing aura finally emerged from the depths of his gaze. 
“Call Yang Fan, and have him bring me the whereabouts of this woman within ten minutes!” 
Whereabouts? 
When the assistant heard this, his eyes lit up: “Does the Third Young Master mean… 
let us track where she goes after she leaves the jewelry store?” 
The man was expressionless: “No need to dig that meticulously, just create some stuff that is favorable for us.” 
Create… 
It was as if a cold draft had suddenly swept through the room. 
With a whoosh, the assistant stood there and shivered with cold. 
The Third Young Master of the Ou Family really was a devil! 
Turning around, the assistant immediately left… 
The man who was still sitting in front of the monitor, after she left, felt a bit stiff from sitting too long, so he stood up, intending to stretch his sturdy body. 
But at that very moment, a burst of blue suddenly appeared in the video. 
What was that? 
He was stunned for a moment, and even the cigarette he had just taken out stopped in its tracks… 
—— 
Downstairs in the jewelry store, it had already turned into complete chaos. 
The established outcome of the appraisal caused mayhem, as well as Yuzhirun’s continuous silence on how to handle the situation. 
At this point, the jewelry store was so out of control that it was almost tearing the entire place down. 
Secretary Gao’s face turned pale with anxiety, wondering why the Third Young Master still hadn’t dealt with the matter. 
But he was squeezed so tight that he couldn’t even make his way out, let alone find his BOSS. 
In a state of desperation, he prepared to call the police to maintain order here, but Yao Peipei, who had been stirring up the crowd through the media, saw him about to call the police and raised her voice sarcastically! 
“Mr. noveldrama
Gao, I know the Ou Family’s business empire is vast, and you probably don’t care about such a newly opened small shop, but after all, this shop still represents the Ou Family. 
It’s not good for you to delay giving an answer. 
I only spent a million today, but what if tomorrow someone with an even more prominent status comes in? 
Wouldn’t that drag the entire Ou Family into this?” 
Her words, surprisingly, were spoken with a tone of concern for the Ou Family!
###22: Chapter 22: The Glorious Return 
22 -22: The Glorious Return 
Secretary Gao, upon hearing this, was furious, “Miss Yao Peipei, the results of this matter have not yet come out. 
You accuse the Ou Family of deceiving customers, and then you say the Ou Family bullies others with their power. noveldrama
You will have to take responsibility for these accusations.” 
Take responsibility? 
Upon hearing this, Yao Peipei burst into an extremely exaggerated laughter, “Mr. 
Gao, have you been confused by anger? 
What I said was the truth. 
Everyone saw the appraisal report just now. 
Can it still be fake? 
This appraiser was specially invited by your Ou Family, and it has nothing to do with me.” 
“You—” 
“Also, if Yuzhirun Jewelry really does not want to take this responsibility and honor the ‘tenfold compensation for a fake’ agreement, that’s fine. 
Consider this a warning from Yao Peipei to the people of this city. 
Next time, when they decide where to shop, they won’t consider the Ou Family’s Yuzhirun!” 
With this last sentence, her true intentions were completely exposed! 
Indeed, her purpose in coming here was to ensure that the Ou Family’s nascent jewelry venture was stillborn. 
She wanted to make sure that in this city, the Ou Family would only be associated with Longfeng and not Yuzhirun! 
Secretary Gao was so angry that his whole body trembled! 
Shaking, he took out his cell phone, intending to have this lunatic thrown out, but at that moment, a cold, clear voice emerged from the crowd, “Is Miss Yao so anxious because she’s worried that the third young master of the Ou Family can’t even afford to make this compensation?” 
The tone was cool, the voice without any warmth! 
As soon as these words were spoken, the crowd that was so dense that one could hardly move immediately turned to look behind themselves, including Secretary Gao. 
It was a woman! 
A very young woman wearing the NGTC uniform! 
What’s happening? 
Another NGTC staff member? 
Everyone was surprised, even the two appraisers who were already here. 
Their jaws dropped in astonishment as they stared at the woman who had suddenly appeared. 
What’s happening? 
Did the company send someone else? 
Why didn’t they know? 
Looking closely, they saw that the woman had a very delicate and beautiful appearance, but perhaps because of the dark blue uniform she was wearing? 
At that moment, she did not exude the gentleness and tenderness expected of a woman. 
Instead, after she appeared, they felt an aura of coldness and hardness, as sharp and icy as Cold Pool. 
Who was this woman, exactly? 
Not far away, the woman in the yellow clothes who had been watching the scene also froze for a moment, “Who is she?” 
The clothing store assistant immediately shook her head, pale as a ghost, “I don’t know. 
When they left NGTC, there were only two people. 
I was watching the whole time, this woman just popped up from nowhere; I really have no idea!” 
“You don’t know?” 
At her words, the woman sitting on the sofa suddenly looked sharp and formidable, “I’ve spent so much money supporting you, and now you’re telling me you don’t know?!!” 
“I’m sorry, President Yang, I will find out right away, I’ll look into it immediately!” The assistant practically tumbled and scrambled out the door. 
This woman was very frightening. 
If you crossed her, you could forget about making it in this city ever again! 
Meanwhile, back in the jewelry store, Yao Peipei, the protagonist of the disturbance, was also dumbfounded by the sudden arrival of this NGTC appraiser, “And who are you? 
Why is there another appraiser here?” 
The woman in blue smiled coldly, “It’s naturally because their skills were not up to par, which is why I was sent here. 
How about it? 
Miss Yao, shall we appraise it again?”
###23: Chapter 23 What is a true master! 
23 -23 What is a true master! 
This statement was bold, and as soon as it was made, not only did the two appraisers’ faces turn red on the spot, but even Yao Peipei was surprised and her eyes widened: “What did you say? 
Appraise it again?” 
The woman in blue nodded emotionlessly: “Yes, don’t you want compensation from Yuzhirun? 
Just appraise it again, and don’t worry, a mere ten million, if it’s really Yuzhirun selling fake goods, the third young master of the Ou Family won’t short you a penny!” 
With that comment, the room exploded in chatter once more! 
Indeed, the words were well spoken. 
The third young master of the Ou Family, who controlled 50% of the Ou’s enterprises, was akin to the Crown Prince of that wealthy family. 
Could someone like him really not afford to pay ten million? 
Secretary Gao, upon seeing this person who had appeared seemingly from heaven to save him, was almost in tears: “Miss An…” 
The woman in blue nodded at him: “Mr. 
Gao, you should tell Miss Yao that the reason the third young master has not offered compensation is that the truth of the matter has not yet come to light, and it’s not because Yuzhirun is trying to escape responsibility.” 
Secretary Gao was so excited… 
Suddenly, he slammed the jewelry set, along with the orders he had just snatched, down hard on the counter from before: “Come, appraise it again!” 
His words had an air of authority, and after he spoke, everyone went quiet! 
Yao Peipei saw this, and although she was a hundred times reluctant, she had no choice but to stand there, secretly glancing in the direction of the store’s exit, trying to find some signal. 
However, to her disappointment, at this moment, the blue vase that had always been placed there had no reaction whatsoever. 
How… 
could there be no reaction? 
The woman in blue saw all her little movements, step by step walking over, she saw that Yao didn’t even notice when she approached, and couldn’t help but a trace of mockery appeared on her lips: “Miss Yao? 
Are you frightened?” 
“Who’s frightened?” Her sharp response was immediately triggered. 
The woman in blue saw this, smiled, and reached out. 
She moved the hair that had fallen onto Yao’s shoulders and nape to the back, her eyes shining bright like those of a siren: “Since that’s the case, let’s begin.” 
“What… 
what exactly do you want?” 
Yao Peipei was scared by this eerie gaze, involuntarily stepping back, ready to reject the appraisal. noveldrama
But just then, the woman standing in front of her already reached out her hand: “Silicate film!” 
What? 
Silicate film? 
Everyone, including the two appraisers, was baffled by this professional chemical term. 
Not until Secretary Gao figured out where the woman’s hand was reaching – behind the toolbox in front of the two appraisers – did he suddenly yell at them: “Didn’t you hear her asking for the silicate film? 
Give it to her quickly!” 
Ah! 
So it was the silicate film? 
It was at this moment that the two appraisers finally caught on, reluctantly taking out a carefully sealed packet of film from the toolbox they brought along. 
To tell the truth, both of them were still quite unhappy at heart because this woman had just questioned their competence; and even more importantly, this woman was wearing their National Gemstone Testing Center uniform, which made them feel even more indignant. 
The National Gemstone Testing Center represented high-tech appraisal work. 
When did such a young girl join them?
###24: Chapter 24 She saw something terrible 
24 -24 She saw something terrible noveldrama
It seemed certain that she would have to inquire thoroughly when she got back! 
Meanwhile, the woman in blue who had obtained the silicone film, upon seeing the glances of the onlookers, including the camera lenses all aimed in her direction, allowed a slight curl to grace her serene lips. 
In the next second, 
. 
She donned a pair of white gloves and used tweezers to lift the thin film out of the container bottle. 
“What…what are you trying to do?” Yang Xueshan, unaware of the truth, inevitably paled at the sight and instinctively resisted. 
“Don’t move. 
If you get hurt because you moved, I won’t be responsible, oh!” Afterward, under the watchful eyes of all, she pasted it onto the fair neck of the woman across from her. 
Everyone was stunned… 
What kind of appraisal method was this? 
Appraising jewelry, yet instead of working on the jade ware, she was doing this to a person—what in the world was she up to? 
Secretary Gao was also at a loss. 
After seeing the woman apply the film, smoothing it continuously with her hands, he couldn’t help but ask, “Ms. 
An, can this really work?” 
“Mr. 
Gao, do you believe in me?” 
She truly stood like a ghost, there, with a faint smile spilling out from beneath her blue hat. 
Yet, for some reason? 
After Secretary Gao saw her eyes, it was as if he was gazing into two bottomless abysses. 
No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t glimpse the secrets hidden within. 
So, he could only nod helplessly, indicating his trust in her. 
How could he not trust her? 
The situation was urgent, Young Master Three had yet to appear, and he could only clutch at straws, hoping for a dead horse to be revived. 
However, what he didn’t know was that, just across from the jewelry store, the woman in the dress shop, upon seeing this scene, suddenly dropped everything in her hands with a clatter! 
“Boss Yang? 
Boss Yang, what’s wrong with you?” The shock was apparent in the voice of the dress shop attendant who witnessed the scene. 
What had gotten into Boss Yang? 
Why was she suddenly so frantic? 
Could something have happened? 
As she went to pick up the items, ready to inquire, the woman, as if having seen something utterly terrifying, snatched up her purse and fled the dress shop as if flying. 
What was going on? 
The staff member was dumbfounded! 
—- 
Inside the jewelry store, Yao Peipei did not dare to move after the thin film had been applied to her. 
Feeling the layer of film with its slightly cool liquid already adhering to her neck, she looked down and realized that it resembled a piece of a cut face mask paper, but compared to a face mask, there was an additional chemical smell in the air. 
A chemical smell? 
Yao Peipei suddenly felt a foreboding sense of unease and was about to tear it off, but the woman, without warning, pressed down on the film, turned her head to the two appraisers beside her, and spoke lightly, “Alum!” 
Alum? 
Hearing this professional chemical term, the onlooking crowd, including the reporters who were focusing their cameras here, all emitted sounds of astonishment. 
Even such professional substances were being used; what exactly did the woman in blue intend to do? 
Could the alum have anything to do with the authenticity of the jewelry she was appraising? 
But the reality was that when a small piece of alum was lightly rubbed by the woman in blue onto the previously applied film, something eerie happened—the previously colorless and transparent film began to show a faint green color.
###25: Chapter 25 This Woman, Interesting! 
25 -25 This Woman, Interesting! 
And when the woman dissolved the alum on top with a layer of glycerin, an even more astonishing spectacle occurred!! 
The film, to everyone’s amazement, turned completely green, and after it was peeled off the woman’s neck and laid flat on the counter, it formed into fine granules in less than ten seconds. 
These granules, with the color of smoky emerald and crystal-clear transparency, were identical to the jade on the set of jewelry. 
Good heavens, this is utterly inconceivable! 
Seeing this, the crowd was thoroughly astounded by this extraction method they had never seen before, and even the man who was engrossed in his office couldn’t help but pause for a moment… 
Not bad, not bad! 
This woman is interesting! 
“Young Master, I’ve already confirmed with the NGTC, and they said they only sent two staff members over, not a third one, so now, Young Master, do we want to… 
take out the videotape first?” 
“No need to hurry, let’s wait and see!” 
“Alright, also, Young Master, Yang Xueshan from across the street, she just left!” 
She left? 
The man who was fixated on the screen paused slightly upon hearing this… noveldrama
She left? 
Did she know that he had already obtained the evidence? 
Good, but did she think she could sacrifice a pawn to save her carriage to protect the second house of the Ou Family? 
It won’t be that easy! 
The man, whose face no longer wore the cold chill from earlier, let a slight curl emerge at the corner of his attractive lips as he gazed intently at the screen. 
Not bad! 
This woman is quite interesting! 
– 
“Ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, jade processing requires cutting and polishing before it can be worn. 
However, no matter how smooth the polishing, once someone wears the jewelry, some mineral residue will always remain on their skin, especially with water-bearing silicates like jadeite, which are even more noticeable. 
Therefore, if Miss Yang Xueshan had ever tried on this set of jewelry when she purchased it, then the mineral residue left on her neck now must be identical to that on the jewelry set.” 
The blue-dressed woman, having fully extracted the crystalline substance at the jewelry store downstairs, smirked coldly at the astonished crowd around her and the woman in front of her whose complexion had completely changed. 
She handed the crystals over to the two appraisers with a flick of her wrist. 
The two appraisers, already stunned by the spectacle they had just witnessed, eagerly accepted the crystals without any reluctance and immediately went back to reassess them. 
This was indeed the best method of proof. 
Since Yuzhirun refused to acknowledge the fake jewelry identified by the two NGTC staff members and Yao Peipei insisted that the jewelry was from Yuzhirun and was fake. 
Therefore, the best approach was to prove whether the jewelry that had been tried on her neck was actually the same as this set of fake jewelry. 
If it was the same, then Yuzhirun would have nothing to say. 
But if not, the following events could become very interesting… 
So at this moment, everyone’s gaze turned back to the appraiser, while the blue-dressed woman, upon seeing Yao Peipei’s panicked and hateful gaze after witnessing the scene, let a trace of laughter shine through her eyes… 
Trying to pull off a bait-and-switch right before me? 
Yang Xueshan, you’re still too green!
###26: Chapter 26 The Stupid Woman 
26 -26 The Stupid Woman 
Five minutes later, the much-anticipated identification results were out once again! 
“Oh my God, they’re different!” 
“Really different, this one is much harder than the one just now, and the density is also much higher, this is completely different material altogether.” 
“Damn, so does that mean the real faker is this female celebrity?” 
“…” 
In just a few seconds, the jewelry store turned into a complete chaos once again for no other reason than the identification results being entirely different from the previous ones. 
So the truth of the matter was… 
Secretary Gao was the first to burst out, pointing at the woman and bellowing, “Yao Peipei, it turns out you’re the real ‘thief crying thief.’ You stole our real jewelry and then made a scene here with the fake ones, what exactly is your purpose?” noveldrama
“…” 
With a great shout, the woman could barely stand, “No, I didn’t, I didn’t…” 
But who would listen to her at this time? 
The evidence was irrefutable, so what further need was there for her denial? 
Therefore, at that moment, not just inside the jewelry store but even outside, everything exploded once again. 
They were angry, shouting, all focusing their scornful gaze on the woman still surrounded by the media in the middle: “We thought it was O’s Jewelry that sold the fake products, but it turns out that after all this fuss, it was this woman staging her own show.” 
“Exactly, nowadays celebrities would do anything just for fame, even stoop to such despicable acts.” 
“…” 
“What do you know, actors have always been like this, they would do anything for their own interests. 
But I must say she has guts, daring to come and direct this play on O’s Young Master’s territory.” 
“That you don’t understand. 
O’s is so big that if she really succeeded, she could have gotten ten million in compensation—fake for real, right? 
This way, she could get the chance for publicity and gain profit. 
Why not do it?” 
“That’s true…” 
“…” 
In just a short few minutes, the people surrounding the jewelry store became extremely angry due to the sudden reversal of the situation. 
They cursed with the ugliest and most offensive words, their eyes wishing they could tear the woman in the middle to pieces right there. 
They can’t be blamed, for this woman leveraged their sense of justice and enthusiasm to sensationalize the incident, which then became the focus of the entire city. 
But the result, the result turned out to be a fabrication, she was the real jewel thief! 
The woman in blue stood there, coldly watching the scene unfold, noting how the woman, now the target of public ire, glanced outside even more eagerly. 
So she too looked towards that place… 
It was the clothing store she had noticed before, but, alas, now the woman inside had disappeared, leaving nothing but an empty store, not even a proper salesperson in sight. 
See, that’s the standard tactic of that despicable couple, a useless exposed pawn is always coldly discarded by them! 
At that thought, the blue-dressed woman suddenly regretted making her move too early because she thought if she had dug a bit deeper when taking action, maybe this foolish little celebrity would have spilled something. 
What a pity! 
As she was reflecting, the woman who had been exposed and abandoned as a scapegoat started biting back in desperation, “I’ve been framed, I didn’t steal Yuzhirun’s jewelry, it was that woman, she deliberately framed me!”
###27: Chapter 27: At the critical moment, he appeared like a deity. 
27: Chapter 27: At the critical moment, he appeared like a deity. 
A sentence was spoken, and many people in the jewelry store stopped in their tracks! 
Framing? 
Was she saying that the blue-clad woman from the NGTC had framed her? 
The crowd began to lose even their most basic patience, “She’s from the National Gemstone Testing Center, how could she possibly frame you? 
Yao Peipei, if you’re going to make excuses, at least find a plausible reason.” 
“Exactly! 
If you did it, just admit it. 
Got the guts to do it but not the guts to own up? 
Is that the nature of you celebrities?” 
“I think so too…” 
“You all—” 
In just a few sentences, their utter disdain for her became crystal clear. 
Yao Peipei was both shocked and frightened, but how could she possibly give in at this moment? 
She was a big star, a celebrity so popular in this city that she was practically royalty. 
So she continued to shriek defiantly, “I’m not making excuses—it was her. 
Jewelry appraisals, as anyone with knowledge understands, can only be done through gemstones. 
When have any of you seen this strange method of appraisal? 
Have you ever heard or seen jewelry being worn and then having its mineral content extracted in such a manner?” 
“…” 
No one answered her; the response she received was only the increasingly contemptuous gaze of the people around her. 
Indeed, they had never seen this method, nor had they ever heard of it—had they not witnessed it with their own eyes today, they wouldn’t have known that such an appraisal technique even existed within the realm of jewelry appraisal. 
But does the fact that they haven’t seen it mean it doesn’t exist? 
The scene they just witnessed, the chemical reaction and the appearance of crystals, they didn’t understand. 
But that didn’t mean they were idiots or illiterate—chemistry can achieve the impossible, can’t it? 
“It seems quite normal that Miss Yao would do what she did today. 
Your Starlight Company can’t even provide the most basic education for an artist. 
How could you not end up doing such underhanded things?” noveldrama
Just as everyone was staring in dumbfounded silence at the woman, from outside the jewelry store came a deep, clear voice. 
Upon hearing it, the crowd immediately turned their heads to look in that direction, realizing in the meantime that a number of well-trained men in black had already appeared and were clearing the area. 
“Isn’t that the usual entourage of the third young master of the Ou Family?” 
“Oh my God! 
Has the third young master of the Ou Family really arrived?” 
“Wow…” 
Seeing the group dressed in full black suits, the crowd thought of the city’s legendary Crown Prince, rumored to go nowhere without a squad of men in black to clear the way. 
Instantly, all eyes were glued in that direction. 
Sure enough, it wasn’t long before a figure in a dark blue casual shirt and black slim-fit suit trousers, exuding an air of sharpness, appeared on the cleared path. 
His features were strikingly handsome with a prominent nose, thin lips, and a pair of deep, ocean-like eyes that hid sharpness and keenness. 
Once he appeared, his tall, straight posture radiated nobility and an intrinsic sense of authority. 
This was indeed the real Crown Prince of the Ou Family! 
Yao Peipei almost collapsed on the spot when she saw him! 
Ou Mucen!! 
The third son of the Ou Family, the most beloved youngest child of the old master, and the most formidable enemy of the second branch of the Ou Family. 
He had actually arrived at this moment… 
“Young Master Ou, are you implying that Yao Peipei’s actions are due to Starlight Company not educating her properly?” The media, realizing that the true owner of the jewelry store had arrived, immediately began their interviews. 
Starlight Company?
###28: Chapter 28 He blocked the place where she was trying to escape… 
28 -28 He blocked the place where she was trying to escape… 
The man walking inside saw the woman in blue who had just finished an intense fight amid the crowd. 
As he entered and she attempted to slip away through the seam of people, he casually approached and blocked that very gap with his foot, “Is it because Starlight Company didn’t train you well? 
I don’t know about that, but I do wonder, it can’t be too simple for a female artist to suddenly create a disturbance at my Ou Mucen’s newly invested project without any reason.” 
Having said that, he noticed the person he had cornered hadn’t realized it yet and was still looking down trying to find the gap between people. 
His eyes twitched, he reached out, hooked her collar, and lifted her up. noveldrama
“Miss An, don’t you think so?” 
“Ah…?” 
Ye Ning was searching for an escape when suddenly someone grabbed her collar, making her stiffen instantly, and she looked up at him as if seeing a ghost, “You… 
what did you say?” 
The rare panic and shock in this moment… 
her reaction pleased him immensely. 
Ou Mucen’s emotionless eyes scanned over her, and after a moment, he repeated with a bit more patience, “I said… 
that woman making a scene here, could there be another purpose behind it?” 
Another purpose? 
Of course, there was! 
Ye Ning, staring into those cool, inscrutable dark eyes, blurted out, “Of course, she just wants to kill you!” 
“…” 
No one spoke. 
In an instant, the jewelry store fell dead silent! 
Secretary Gao started sweating bullets… 
This was bad, how could Miss An be so blunt? 
Saying in front of so many people that someone wanted to kill the third young master of the Ou Family, wouldn’t that make her suspicious? 
It was well known that the two sons of the Ou Family were at odds, and Muyuan, of the second branch, had spent countless schemes over the years trying to eliminate his younger brother, Mucen, using many people for this purpose. 
As a result, the Third Young Master of the Ou Family had developed an overly suspicious nature, suspecting anyone who misspoke even a single word as a plant from the second branch. 
So, now with this woman nonchalantly dropping such a statement, wasn’t she practically pushing herself onto a path to her own demise? 
Secretary Gao looked at the man opposite him, who was staring at the woman like a wolf, and broke out in a cold sweat… 
Ye Ning also felt the suffocating threat, but she thought the danger stemmed from impersonating someone from the NGTC without his consent, not something else. 
So, even though she was a bit panicked, she wasn’t scared! 
She hadn’t done anything wrong, so why should she be afraid? 
She kept looking up at him, her neck growing weary until, finally, she noticed something in his gaze slowly relax, “Is that so? 
I think so too!” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
Just as she was about to say something, he let go of her. 
Then, as she looked up, she saw a hint of an ambiguous smile on his perfect, thin lips, “Bring Miss An a chair.” 
“Yes, Third Master!” 
“…” 
Wait, what was he doing? 
Bringing her a chair? 
Did he actually intend for her to sit comfortably here and watch him handle the situation? 
Ye Ning felt somewhat angry. 
As he headed towards the media, she glared at his back fiercely, intending to leave. 
But then, the person carrying over the chair stopped her, “Miss An, please take a seat!”
###29: Chapter 29: He is the Truly Frightening One 
29 -29: He is the Truly Frightening One 
“You…” 
“Miss An, don’t worry. 
The third young master won’t be away for long. 
We will also take good care of your friend and child.” 
Damn it! 
He even had Ye Xiaobao and Qiao Feiyu all sorted out. 
What the hell did this bastard want to do? 
Hadn’t she saved his jewelry store? 
Was this how he repaid her kindness with enmity? 
Ye Ning was so angry she felt like her head would explode… 
Meanwhile, the man on this side, having reached the midst of the media reporters, naturally had his assistant bring out a tape: “Actually, to understand what happened this time, you just need to look at this. noveldrama
As they say, there’s no proof without evidence. 
We should still look at the evidence.” 
After speaking, he handed the tape over to his assistant! 
Everyone watched, speechless, especially Yao Peipei, who became even more perplexed upon seeing that tape. 
Yes, she had indeed switched the jewelry, and she also admitted that the two sets of jewelry were not the same, but what did this have to do with a videotape? 
Perhaps Yao Peipei didn’t realize that she had angered a very frightening man today, and what this man loved to do the most was, when necessary, turn all fabrication into fact. 
So at that moment, everyone saw that after the tape was taken, images suddenly appeared on the display monitor hanging on the wall of the jewelry store, which was originally used to play promotional advertisements. 
It was a surveillance video, not very clear, but it was evident it was taken from the kind of street surveillance camera. 
It was in such a video that they saw the most recent footage of a woman. 
This woman wore an extremely skimpy camisole, with an extremely provocative super short miniskirt below, her hair styled in blonde wavy curls, and she sported sunglasses from a well-known brand, walking towards a car not far away. 
Wasn’t this Yao Peipei? 
Oh my God, she was actually carrying a shopping bag from Yuzhirun! 
People began to whisper among themselves, and even Ye Ning, who was forced to sit there, looked at the scene with astonishment. 
Was this a follow shot? 
No, no, this must have been captured by one of those street cameras. 
But why did it just happen to capture her? 
Ye Ning showed confusion… 
Yet, she saw the scene change. 
The angle of the surveillance camera smoothly transitioned to capture her driving to a secluded suburban area, which was a well-known industrial zone of A City. 
As people took a closer look, they noticed that the Audi drove up to the entrance of a very large factory, and the sign above the doorway was none other than—Longfeng Processing Base! 
Holy shit! 
This was the real purpose of the tape! 
The jewelry store was once again in an uproar… 
“So she was working for Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry?” 
“My God, isn’t that… 
isn’t that again the Ou Family’s second young master and them… 
they…” 
“…” 
The rest of the sentence went unfinished, but many understood all too well—the second young master of the Ou Family had always been at odds with the third, like fire and water. 
Now, for him to frame the third young master’s new store, there was nothing more natural than that. 
Inside the store, many were choked by the dramatically reversed outcome. 
There were those who were angry, those who scoffed, those who despised… 
All these reactions appeared in the store at that time, even Ye Ning was shockingly looking at that scene.
###30: Chapter 30 The Scandal that Shocked the City noveldrama
30 -30 The Scandal that Shocked the City 
This ending, even she was surprised! 
Apart from that Yao Peipei, everyone else was still staring dumbfounded at the video. 
How could this happen? 
She had never been to the Longfeng Jewelry Processing Base, she didn’t dare to, and she wasn’t allowed to, so why did the surveillance video capture her movements? 
That’s impossible, yes, absolutely impossible, it must be this man framing her! 
She finally snapped out of it and began to shriek, “This is fake, I’ve never been there, all this is fabricated by him, he’s setting me up! 
I’ve never been to the Longfeng Jewelry Factory.” 
Heh… 
She really had some nerve, even at this point, she still thought she wasn’t in deep enough trouble! 
And so, at that moment, when everyone saw Mr. 
Gao’s secretary make a call, a swarm of police officers came not long after, saw the video tape and the set of fake jewelry, and without bothering with anything else, they handcuffed the woman. 
Seeing this, Yao Peipei started to struggle violently, “It wasn’t me, I never went there, why are you arresting me? 
I only swapped the jewelry, why are you arresting me? 
Don’t arrest me, I’ve already said, it wasn’t me who wanted to switch the jewelry, someone told me to swap it.” 
“Who?” 
“Xiao Han from our company!” 
“…” 
Xiao Han? 
That was the director of Starlight Company, but now, this woman could be seen in the video driving to the Longfeng Jewelry Factory, so was this supposed to tell them that Starlight Company, which was thriving in the entertainment circle, was actually owned by the Ou Family’s second branch? 
In the jewelry store, everything erupted into chaos especially with the media reporters there, who made their living by digging up news, and now faced with such an explosive scandal, how could they let it go? 
Thus on that day, the whole of A City was plastered with reports of this affair—”Power Struggle in the Ou Family Reaches New Heights, Second Son Ou Muyuan Buys Popular Star Yao Peipei to Stir Trouble at Yuzhirun Jewelry” 
“Popular Star Becomes a Prisoner Overnight, Reason—Bribed by the Ou Family’s Second Son to Frame the Third Young Master of the Ou Family!” 
“Hidden Battles of the Wealthy!” 
… 
In short, wherever you opened your eyes to the media, everywhere was covered with such news, causing a citywide uproar. 
When the old master of the Ou Family was dining at Blue Mountain Villa and saw these reports, he slammed his bowl and food onto the floor in anger, “Rebellious, I am still here, does he think I am dead? 
Call that bastard back immediately!!” 
“Yes, Master!” 
With that fierce roar, the butler didn’t dare linger and ran off to find the second young master. 
Bai Tingfang stood outside the door, seeing the old master get so angry, a flash of rage crossed her charming face, “Xiaoxia, go call the third young master back too, tell him the old master wants him back.” 
“Yes, Madam!” 
It was time for a change of weather in Blue Mountain Villa… 
—- 
An hour later, an office on the ninth floor of the mall- 
Ye Ning sat there quietly, looking across at the man equally seated in a chair. 
An hour had passed since the commotion downstairs dispersed and she was invited up to this office, waited for half an hour for him, and then after he entered, she watched him type away at his laptop for another half hour. 
What exactly did he want to do? 
Not a single word, no glance in her direction, if he was really that busy, could he let her leave? 
She didn’t fancy bothering him, she had things to do too, alright?
###31: Chapter 31 Mr. 
Ou, Detaining by Force is Illegal 
31: Chapter 31 Mr. 
Ou, Detaining by Force is Illegal 
Ye Ning finally lost her patience and stood up abruptly from the chair, “Mr. 
Ou, what on earth do you want? 
Keeping me here against my will like this, that’s considered illegal detention!” 
Illegal detention? 
Upon hearing these words, the man who had been typing on the keyboard for a long time finally looked up at her expressionlessly, “I’m not stopping you. 
The door is open; if you don’t leave, how is that my problem?” 
F*ck! 
Ye Ning was furious, “That’s because you’ve kidnapped my son and my friend! 
I’m here because of that, Ou Mucen, don’t you go too far!” 
Ou Mucen let out a cold laugh, “Miss An, watch your words. 
I kindly invited your son and friend to a meal, and you’re accusing me of kidnapping?” 
“Isn’t that what it is? 
Just for a meal, did you have to take them to the middle of the sea?” 
“That’s Nanhu Island, the best resort hotel under Ou Corporation. 
You should feel honored for your son and friend!” 
“You—” 
Ye Ning felt like she was going to explode with anger! 
This weirdo, this scion, this lunatic! 
Why hadn’t she realized before that he was such a freak, so unlike a normal person? 
If she had known earlier, she wouldn’t have come to him even if she were beaten to death. 
Standing there, she held her head, trying to stay calm for a long, long time, before finally settling down, “Fine, tell me, what exactly do you want to know?” 
Ye Ning had thought it through; if this scion detained her, it was nothing but a desire to know her true background, and her exceptional talent and skill in antique appraisal. 
Of course, he probably wanted to know the reasons behind her helping him as well. 
Sure enough, upon hearing her say that, the man who had been busy stopped his typing, then looked at her with a particularly sharp gaze, like two searchlights, aiming to probe into the deepest parts of her heart. 
“That move of yours, where did you learn it?” 
“My master!” 
“And who is your master?” 
“Lin Yebai!” 
“…” 
There was silence. 
The man was suddenly stunned… 
Of course he would be shocked, because Lin Yebai was a big name in the Antique Circle, known for his expertise in appraising treasures. 
Any antiques that came his way nearly always failed to escape his discerning eyes. 
Thus, in A City, Lin Yebai was also known as ‘Lin the Pointer.’ noveldrama
Which meant that he could usually pinpoint the authenticity of antiques with just one touch. 
Of course, that might be an exaggeration, but the name Lin Yebai was definitely influential. 
Ye Ning knew it, and once she mentioned it, she was sure this man would take her seriously. 
True to her prediction, after a brief moment of astonishment, Ou Mucen accepted the reality, “If Lin Yebai is indeed your master, then why come to apply for a job here with me? 
Isn’t it better at his place?” 
He already knew she was the one who had come to apply? 
Ye Ning was somewhat surprised! 
But her confusion cleared quickly when she remembered that high-level secretary. 
He was Ou’s secretary, and by now, he must have certainly informed him. 
So she smiled faintly, “My master is great, but he doesn’t run a company. 
Usually, he just deals with some antiques, a carefree individual. 
He doesn’t need anyone to work for him. 
And as you can see, I have a son to support. 
I must find a job with a salary.” 
“Isn’t there the father of the child?” Almost subconsciously, the man sitting in front of the computer blurted out, then felt inexplicably uncomfortable after speaking.
###32: Chapter 32: The child’s father is dead! 
32 -32: The child’s father is dead! 
Ye Ning didn’t pay attention to his expression, but when she heard the word “Dad,” a stabbing pain shot through the bottom of her heart, and her face immediately turned ice cold, “Dead!” 
Dead? 
Ou Mucen was stunned by these two words for a moment! 
Dead? 
She said, the child’s father is dead? 
He found it a bit hard to believe what he heard; she was only twenty-three, and her husband was already dead? 
This was quite unexpected to him. 
Ye Ning had been watching him all along, and she saw that after she said those two words, this man, in an uncharacteristic manner, stopped doing his job and just stared blankly at her. 
This made the coldness at the corner of her lips even more intense, “So, Mr. 
Ou, you know now? 
My child, to me, that’s life itself.” 
Ou Mucen: “…” 
After a long while, his gaze finally unnaturally withdrew from the face opposite to him, which had suddenly become particularly icy and sharp, “Sorry, I didn’t know the child’s father…” 
“It’s fine, anyway my child has always only been mine alone!” Ye Ning interrupted him very coldly. 
Indeed, her child had belonged only to her from the moment he took root in her belly. 
She neither knew nor wanted to know who his father was. 
All she knew now was that from the second he was born, he was hers, Ye Ning’s. 
The atmosphere quietened down again, but unlike the previous pervading tension, this time, because of a question that wasn’t supposed to be asked, the man opposite was clearly not as imposing as before. 
“So that’s to say, you showed up in my jewelry store today to catch my attention? 
To get into the Ou enterprise?” 
“What?” Ye Ning was taken aback. 
To attract his attention? 
Of course not, her actions today were merely to foil that woman’s plan. 
However, since he put it that way, it did align with her intentions—not that she had any desire to reveal her true purpose to him. 
So she nodded, “Yes, previously when I went to your company for a job interview, you were unwilling to even see me, so after I saw the turmoil at the jewelry store, I thought of this method.” 
“And you aren’t afraid I’ll throw you out? noveldrama
For impersonating an NGTC employee?” 
“You won’t!” Ye Ning smiled, “Because you don’t have any evidence to prove that woman faked it!” 
“…” 
His pupils narrowed slightly, and the air in the office once again plummeted to freezing point! 
She had actually seen through the fact that the videotape was fake? 
Very well! 
There weren’t many who dared to speak so candidly to him. 
He fixed his gaze on the open resume on the laptop, and seeing that the verified information was basically not entirely certain, a smile of profound secrecy curled up at the edge of his lips, “Probation period of three months, you can report to the HR department to complete the paperwork tomorrow morning!” 
“What?” 
“What’s wrong? 
Don’t want the job?” His face was about to turn in a second! 
Ye Ning’s eyes blinked, finally realizing what had just happened, and in her ecstasy, she stood up from the chair and pressed down on the offer letter he was about to take back, “Want to, definitely want to. 
It’s just that happiness came too quickly just now; I didn’t have time to react, right?” 
Ou Mucen: “…” 
It was a while before he finally relaxed his finger, letting go of the paper, “Don’t get too happy too soon. 
Yuzhirun is my newly invested brand. 
Everything is still not on the right track. 
If you perform well, that’s good; if not, you’re still out on your ear.”
###33: Chapter 33 Damn! 
This despicable person! 
33 -33 Damn! 
This despicable person! 
Ye Ning smiled, “Third Young Master, rest assured, I will make your Yuzhirun the biggest jewelry brand in this city!” 
“…” 
If Ou Mucen had been paying attention, he would have noticed that, in this statement, the woman used a most special word. 
One “let”—as his assistant, according to the hierarchy of positions and status, she should have said “help” at this time, not “let.” Help implies that Ou Mucen is still the principal, and she is the secondary, serving an assisting role. 
But “let” signifies that now she is the principal; she has come to make his Yuzhirun the biggest jewelry brand, and that is her real purpose for approaching him. 
– 
“Third Young Master, Xiaoxia is downstairs looking for you. 
The lady ordered him to come to take you back home,” Secretary Gao suddenly pushed the door open and quickly said upon seeing Ou Mucen sitting there. 
Xiaoxia? 
Ye Ning, standing in front of the desk, recalled the servant who often followed Bai Tingfang around in that house where she lived five years ago, then she quietly stepped aside with the employment letter in her hand. 
Bai Tingfang personally sending someone here to fetch this third young master of the Ou Family indicates that today’s events must have already spread to Blue Mountain Villa. 
The third branch’s new jewelry investment being sabotaged by the second branch on its first day of business, and in a deadly manner at that. 
Heh, it seems today’s Blue Mountain Villa must be quite bustling! 
Lost in her thoughts while standing there, she suddenly heard someone calling her. 
Looking up, she realized that the man who had been sitting at the office desk had already left while she had been dazed. 
“Miss An, we have picked up your child and friend; they are waiting downstairs,” someone spoke. 
Damn! 
Ye Ning inwardly cursed the scion and then promptly made her way outside. 
This scumbag had already picked them up earlier; the reason he hadn’t told her was to wear down her edge while she was anxious and discomposed, so he could then ask what he wanted to know. 
This guy is truly despicable! 
She dashed down the stairs and sure enough, there in the shopping mall’s ground floor lobby, Qiao Feiyu, full from eating and drinking, was showing Ye Xiaobao the photos he had just taken on the island on his phone while keeping his legs crossed. 
“Xiaobao, Xiaobao, look how pretty this yacht is? 
I knew the pictures would turn out super beautiful,” he exclaimed. 
“…” 
Ye Xiaobao was utterly speechless, lifting his small face and looking around. 
Seeing his mother hadn’t arrived yet, he furrowed his little brows even tighter, “It better be nothing’s happened to my mom, otherwise, I definitely won’t let that weird uncle off the hook.”

###34: Chapter 34 The Infuriatingly Stupid Best Friend 
34 -34 The Infuriatingly Stupid Best Friend 
“Ah?” 
Qiao Dani didn’t catch on, “Your mother? 
Why would there be anything wrong with your mother? 
And what does that strange uncle have to do with it?” 
Ye Xiaobao: “…” 
Forget it, there’s no point in telling her, she wouldn’t understand even if I did. 
So he jumped down from the chair, his little arms and legs flailing, and started heading toward the elevator to go up and look for his mother. 
It was at this moment that the elevator door “dinged” and opened, and a figure walked out. 
“Xiaobao…” 
“Mommy!!” 
Seeing Little Baozi standing at the elevator entrance, Ye Ning rushed out and hugged him tightly, with such force it was as if she didn’t hold him close, her precious child would disappear once again. 
“Xiaobao, I’m sorry, it’s all Mommy’s fault. 
I shouldn’t have left you there alone, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” She kept apologizing to him and kissing his little face, as if only by doing this could she alleviate her guilt and self-blame. 
Ye Xiaobao, being held by her, initially wanted to ask if that uncle had bullied her? 
But seeing her so agitated, he changed his mind, “Mommy, you didn’t leave me behind. 
It was Auntie Qiao who left you behind. noveldrama
She heard the coffee shop was having a promotion, said there was a prize to go eat on an island, and she didn’t want you anymore.” 
Ye Ning’s expression instantly froze: “Is that so?” 
Ye Xiaobao nodded vigorously: “Yeah, if you don’t believe me, ask Auntie Qiao.” After saying this, he turned his head to look behind him. 
Just at that moment, Qiao Feiyu also saw Ye Ning and came over. 
Hearing this, the foolishly straightforward girl didn’t hesitate to nod, “Indeed, Ningning, you have no idea how lucky we were today, super big prize! 
I was going to wait for you, but they said it was limited time at the coffee shop, so I took Xiaobao and left first.” 
Limited time my ass! 
Ye Ning was nearly driven to the brink of fury by her simple-minded best friend, but no matter what, they were all safe now, and that was her greatest comfort. 
So she let that go, picked up Little Baozi from the ground, and with a beaming smile, pulled out the offer letter from her person: “Feiyu, look, I got the job.” 
The moment Qiao Feiyu saw it, she screamed with joy, “Oh my God, Ye Ning, you are amazing! 
You actually got the job, how did you manage that?” 
How did she manage that? 
Ye Ning, thinking about everything that had happened that day, couldn’t help but smile wryly, “It took a lot of effort. 
Look, you went to such a nice place to eat, and I didn’t even have the time to join you.” 
“So, you’ve been not answering your phone because you were busy with this?” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
Not answering her phone, that was because the key to the locker, where she stored her clothes and purse at the shopping mall, was stolen, damn it! 
Ye Ning’s forehead throbbed just thinking about it, but regardless, she eventually got her wish and joined Oushi Corporation. 
If that meant swallowing a bit of anger, so be it. 
So without dwelling on that topic, she lifted her son up, “Anyway, it’s good news that I got in. 
When you go back, tell your brother as well, so he won’t worry.” 
Qiao Feiyu immediately nodded, “Okie dokie, don’t worry, I’ll definitely tell him.” 
Qiao Feiyu’s brother is Lin Yebai, the man Ye Ning referred to as her master in front of that man earlier. 
PS: Please vote for a **recommendation and leave a comment, thank you…
###35: Chapter 35 She Had No Choice 
35 -35 She Had No Choice 
But in fact, Lin Yebai was not her master, but her friend, a very, very good friend to her. 
If it hadn’t been for him, she might not have been in this world anymore. 
Therefore, she of course wanted to share such good news with him right away. 
After leaving the mall, because Qiao Feiyu had to attend school the next day, the two chatted briefly before she headed home first. 
Following her departure, Ye Ning, too, took Ye Xiaobao with her and boarded the bus back to the suburbs. 
The little Charade was Qiao Feiyu’s, and she lived in the north of the city. 
It didn’t seem right for Ye Ning to use the car herself, but fortunately, the bus route was convenient and did not require many transfers. 
So, after the mother and son got on the bus, they found a seat by the window, and Ye Ning scooped the four-year-old lad onto her lap while she comfortably leaned back into her seat. 
“Mommy, does that mean you’re going to work tomorrow?” 
Ye Ning nodded her head, “Yes, Mommy has finally found a job. 
Are you happy, baby?” 
Ye Xiaobao nodded, “Happy, but can Mommy still pick me up every day?” 
“…” 
That one question sent Ye Ning into deep thought… 
Indeed, this was an issue. 
She and Xiaobao lived in the rural outskirts, and the bus ride to the city center was nearly an hour. 
How could she send Xiaobao to kindergarten so early in the morning when the kindergarten wasn’t even open yet? 
And when she finished work, it would be quite late, probably after the kindergarten had closed. 
Ye Ning frowned deeply, “Then Xiaobao, would it be okay if Aunt Chunhua from downstairs took you instead? 
Once Mommy has settled down at that company, we’ll find a new house in the city center. 
Then I can take you to a kindergarten in the city, okay?” 
Just as expected! 
The four-year-old child, though reluctant, looked at his visibly exhausted mother and sensibly nodded his head, “Okay, but Mommy, be careful at work.” 
Ye Ning smiled, “Don’t worry, sweetie. 
Mommy will work hard!” 
Ye Ning could actually see the little one’s disappointment and unhappiness, his small face drooping, the sparkle gone from his dark eyes. 
But what could she do? 
She had no choice at the moment. 
For revenge, to make those who had wronged her years ago pay, she had to grit her teeth and harden her heart. 
Only then could she reclaim what was hers, and ensure they could live openly and proudly in this world. 
She had no choice! 
Seeing her little one slouched against her, her eyes suddenly began to well up with tears. 
Reaching out, she pulled his tiny body closer, burying her head deeply into the nape of his slender neck. 
The warm breeze blew in from the window, carrying the scent of early summer. 
At this moment, the mother and son huddled together seemed just like the trees sprouting new branches on either side of the road, the harsh winter had passed, and although the new branches weren’t yet strong, autumn would still arrive. 
When it did, it would be time for harvest. 
Baby, trust Mommy, everything will get better… 
—- 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen had already arrived at Blue Mountain Villa. 
Blue Mountain Villa, a renowned private estate in Qianshui Bay at A City, was well known. 
The most luxurious residential area was right by the sea in the city center—the beautiful environment and fresh air were favored by many wealthy people.noveldrama
###36: Chapter 36 He is His Young Uncle 
36 -36 He is His Young Uncle 
Blue Mountain Villa was one of the first private estates in this residential area to be purchased and set up by an individual. 
When Ou Mucen returned here, the villa was already enveloped in a cloud of gloom, and from afar, he could smell the scent of gunpowder. 
Thus, he didn’t hurry to leave the car, instead, he took out a cigarette, lit it, and gradually rolled down the car window. 
He actually did not often come back to this estate for a couple of reasons: one was because it was too far from the company, a waste of time back and forth, and another was he did not want to see certain people he preferred to avoid in this house. 
For example, as soon as he rolled down the window, he saw a scheming mother and son standing outside the main hall in the courtyard. 
“What are they doing?” 
Xiaoxia, who was about to get out of the car as well, saw them and heard the vague shouting of the master from inside the hall. 
She understood, “They must be eavesdropping on the commotion inside. 
Third Young Master, the old master is scolding the Second Master in there.” 
The Second Master naturally referred to the villa’s second son, Ou Muyuan. 
Idiot! 
The man taking a drag from his cigarette sneered coldly at what he heard, finally stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray, and then opened the door to get out of the car. 
Inside the villa, due to the old master’s thunderous fury, the servants were nearly scared out of their wits, afraid that the wave of rage would inadvertently hurt the innocent. 
They found excuses to go do chores elsewhere, so when Ou Mucen walked in, no one noticed him. 
It was only when he reached the garden outside the main hall that he suddenly heard a loud roar from inside, “The evidence and testimony are all here, yet you still won’t admit it, you damn thing! 
Are you waiting for me to beat you to death?” 
A loud “smack”! 
It was as if something shattered in the air, and the few people outside, including Ou Mucen who was just walking in, stopped dead in their tracks. 
It was certainly an awkward scene, but not for Ou Mucen. 
He hadn’t done anything wrong; what was there for him to feel awkward about? 
The only reason he stopped was to see how these two would react at this moment. 
“Mu…Mucen, you’re back? 
How come you’re home so early today?” The first to speak was the woman, heavily made up but could not hide the panic on her face, regardless of how thick her makeup was. 
Ou Mucen was expressionless, “I came back to watch the excitement. 
Aren’t you also watching?” 
At those words, the man standing next to the woman, who bore a slight resemblance to his second brother, immediately changed his expression, “Ou Mucen, that’s enough! 
Who let you talk to my mom like that? 
She is your sister-in-law!” 
Ou Mucen sneered, “Then who allowed you to talk to me like that? 
I am your uncle!” 
Ou Yuze was suddenly at a loss for words! 
That’s right, he was indeed his uncle, a real blood-related uncle. 
But he was the same age as him, nearly the same height and build—why should he be the one called uncle? noveldrama
Did he not know how much he detested that title? 
They were all members of the Ou Family, yet simply because he was the son of that old man, and he was his grandson, the treatment was worlds apart—why was that? 
His bones creaked, and within moments, those eyes were bloodshot! 
Standing next to him, Mei Liping sensed trouble brewing and quickly grabbed her son, “Mucen, Yu Ze is still young and doesn’t understand these things. 
You, as his uncle, should be more magnanimous and not bear grudges against him.”
###37: Chapter 37: Play with him? 
Too inexperienced! 
37 -37: Play with him? 
Too inexperienced! 
Too young? 
Ou Mucen, who had been standing there without moving much, felt a wave of nausea wash over him when he heard this… 
Everyone knew that the son born to the second branch of the Ou Family was a few months older than the third young master of the Ou Family, but now, to protect her own son, she actually had the nerve to claim that he was too young to understand, without feeling disgusted with herself? 
However, since she was asking him for help, he should at least give her a chance. 
So he reeled in his intimidating aura, waved his hand for Xiaoxia, who was following behind, to light another cigarette for him and said, “I can let him off, but you must show some sincerity, right?” 
Sincerity? 
Mei Liping didn’t quite understand at first: “What do you mean…?” 
Ou Mucen sneered coldly, “I’ve suffered quite a bit today—my reputation damaged, relationships to mend, and some face lost. 
Second sister-in-law, if we start counting, I think the old man wouldn’t let you stay in this family anymore.” 
“Ou Mucen, don’t be too arrogant!” As soon as the words fell, Ou Yuze exploded with anger once more! 
Arrogant? 
Ou Mucen stared at him, his eyes cold and sharp, as though he could see right through him: “Is it our first day meeting? 
When have I, Ou Mucen, never been arrogant? 
Don’t like it? 
Fine, let’s pretend I never said anything.” 
With that, he lifted his foot to head towards the direction of the hall. 
Seeing this, Mei Liping finally panicked, pushing her son hard back and hurried over to block him: “Mucen Mucen, don’t listen to his nonsense. 
He doesn’t know anything. 
You tell me, what do you want, second sister-in-law can decide!” noveldrama
“Are you sure?” 
“Sure!” 
“Fine, give me the jade procurement channels of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry, and I’ll let you off.” He was like a wolf that had successfully trapped its prey— at this moment, the man gazed at the mother and son, his eyes gleaming like rolling waves. 
So, this was his true ive? 
Ou Yuze was trembling with rage! 
Procurement channels? 
Indeed, he had orchestrated such a plot just to acquire the most crucial element of the Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry business. 
Everyone knew that for a jewelry store, the procurement channel is extremely important. 
With jade being difficult to distinguish between real and fake, and with varying levels of quality within the real stones. 
Therefore, to run a successful jewelry store, this procurement channel is of utmost importance, and Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry’s channels were always a secret. 
Whoever manages it only gets to know, and even if it was Ou Mucen, the old master wouldn’t provide them to him privately. 
But now, he dared to demand the procurement channels from the second branch outright—didn’t he fear the old master finding out? 
Ou Yuze was starting to lose his grip on rationality: “Ou Mucen, you’ve gone to such lengths, framing and scheming, all to get our procurement channels. 
Are you not afraid that I will go to grandfather and expose you?” 
Expose? 
Ou Mucen laughed coldly: “Go ahead and try, see whether he believes you or me.” 
With a single sentence, Ou Yuze stood there, completely deflated… 
This was a fact. 
The old Mr. 
Ou had always doted on his youngest son. 
Not to mention the video of the little star with the genuine jewelry at the Longfeng Jewelry Processing Base, the second branch had no evidence to prove the video was fake. 
Simply the fact that the little star caused trouble at Yuzhirun, and that the true shareholder of the little star’s company was Ou Yuze’s girlfriend, Yang Xueshan, had already cost them any chance of gaining the old master’s trust. 
So, no matter what Ou Mucen said or demanded at this time, he would stand on his side.
###38: Chapter 38 Ou Yuze, I’ve Discovered Something Terrible! 
38 -38 Ou Yuze, I’ve Discovered Something Terrible! 
Ou Yuze’s face finally turned ashen. 
He wanted to say more, but upon hearing the continued roars from the hall and the intermittent sounds of things being shattered, he clenched his fists and finally fell silent. 
Alright, this time, he would hold back! 
Mei Liping was also very angry, but at this moment, their second branch truly had no other choice. 
Biting her teeth fiercely and glaring at the man, she eventually nodded in agreement, “This is a big deal; I promise you, I’ll discuss it with your second brother when I get back.” 
“Alright…” With a faint acknowledgment, the man no longer looked at her and stepped toward the direction of the hall. 
– 
“Dad, what are you doing? 
I can smell your gunpowder all the way out here.” 
“Oh, Mucen is back, huh? 
I’m just teaching your brother a lesson, this worthless thing. 
He’s getting more and more cunning, and to think he would do such a thing, I won’t let him off easily today!” 
“Enough, Dad. 
No matter what, he’s still my brother. 
Don’t be too harsh. 
A few harsh words should be enough. 
I believe the second brother didn’t really mean to kill me, did you, second brother?” 
“…” 
Nobody spoke again, and for a moment, the noise in the hall quieted down. 
However, the mother and son standing outside could both imagine the expression on the face of the man inside their family at that moment. 
Pathetic, forced to put on a thankful smile after being offered charity! 
“Ou Mucen, I will make you kneel and beg me!” With a fierce punch, the wooden decoration beside him was smashed into pieces. 
Mei Liping, frightened, quickly intervened, “What are you doing? 
Isn’t it chaotic enough? 
There are Bai Tingfang’s people everywhere here. 
If you keep acting recklessly, our sacrifices will have been in vain.” 
Ou Yuze burst out in anger, “But are we just going to let him be arrogant like this? 
He has already started investing in jewelry. noveldrama
If Yuzhirun flourishes under his management, then our Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry won’t be able to compete with him.” 
“Don’t worry, managing a jewelry business is not that easy. 
Do you think just because he has our supply chain, he can run Yuzhirun successfully? 
I’m telling you, without a professional appraiser, even if he has the raw jade, it’s useless!” 
That’s right! 
Ou Yuze finally understood… 
Yes, he had forgotten that Original Jade Stone requires a keen eye to assess. 
The man doesn’t know anything. 
Even if they gave him the best supply chain, it doesn’t guarantee that he could manage Yuzhirun well. 
So, the raging fire in his heart slowly calmed down, “Okay, I’ll make the arrangements.” 
Mei Liping nodded, “Hmm, by the way, where is that woman? 
Hasn’t she come looking for you yet?” 
Ou Yuze’s brows immediately furrowed, “Are you talking about Yang Xueshan?” 
“Who else but her? 
It wouldn’t have turned out like this today if it weren’t for her!” Mei Liping’s voice was very sharp, and her tone extremely aggressive, making it clear that she really disliked this woman named Yang Xueshan. 
Ou Yuze frowned! 
He had forgotten all about her; that woman was still waiting to tell him something extremely important. 
So he took out his phone and dialed a number, “Yang Xueshan, what on earth do you still want to tell me?” 
“Yuze? 
Is that you, Yuze? 
No, I really didn’t mean to slip away. 
Listen to me, I really left because I discovered something very frightening, Yuze.”
###39: Chapter 39 It must be Ye Ning! 
Ye Ning is out!! 
39 -39 It must be Ye Ning! 
Ye Ning is out!! 
On the phone, it was indeed that woman, but the moment she spoke, he was startled to hear her voice trembling. 
What was she doing? 
Afraid? 
Someone as arrogant and overbearing as her, could she actually feel fear? 
Ou Yuze finally paused, his tone softening slightly, “What’s so terrifying?” 
Yang Xueshan was still shivering on the other end: “The appraisal, the appraisal matter, Yu Ze, do you know? 
Just now in that jewelry store, I saw the same appraisal method used by that woman years ago.” 
Woman? 
Which woman? 
So much time had passed that Ou Yuze hadn’t realized it yet, not until the woman on the phone spelled out a name word by word: “Ye Ning!! 
It’s Ye Ning!! 
That method, it’s the one Ye Ning used!!” 
Ye Ning? 
Ou Yuze was indeed petrified! 
How long had it been since he heard that name? 
So long that he had forgotten there was such a name in this world. 
But, she was out? 
How could that be? 
Wasn’t she sentenced to ten years? 
Only five years had passed, how could she possibly be out already? 
In an instant, his heart also skipped a beat: “What nonsense are you spouting? 
She’s still in prison right now, how could she possibly be out? 
Stop making excuses for yourself, you’re going to have to answer to me for today’s matter.” 
After saying that, he was ready to hang up the call. 
Yang Xueshan became frantic when she heard this: “Yu Ze, Yu Ze you have to believe me, that appraisal method, apart from seeing that woman use it, I’ve never seen it again, it’s her own invention, believe me, if you really don’t believe me, then you can go to the prison to check…” 
The rest of her words were cut off, for the man had fiercely hung up the phone! 
Was she serious? 
To shirk her own responsibility, she was claiming that Ye Ning had come out of prison; did she think he was a three-year-old child? 
Or was she herself braindead? noveldrama
After hanging up ruthlessly, the man’s entire expression was livid. 
Mei Liping saw this from the side, and her face immediately turned ugly, “Was that call from that woman? 
What did she say? 
Is she saying that this matter has nothing to do with her again?” 
Ou Yuze didn’t answer but turned and walked away! 
It was not just a lack of connection; she had the audacity to act as if he didn’t matter at all. 
Ye Ning, is it? 
Fine, he would let her truly understand what happens to people who cause trouble and then refuse to take responsibility. 
When Ou Yuze went out, his face was fearsome. 
The assistant had been waiting for him outside, and when he finally came out, he immediately approached: “Young Master, Miss Yang has been waiting outside the estate for a long time, do you want to see her?” 
See her? 
The man, whose expression was already twisted, scoffed right then and there: “No need, take her to Royal, someone will handle her there properly.” 
“Yes, Young Master!” 
Having received this directive, the assistant was about to carry it out, but just as he turned, the young master suddenly called out to him: “Chen Shen, have you made any calls to Ningzhou Prison recently?” 
The assistant stopped again immediately: “Ningzhou Prison? 
No.” 
Ningzhou Prison was where Miss Ye Ning was incarcerated; for so many years, the place was like a taboo here, never even mentioned, so why did the young master suddenly bring it up now? 
The assistant was somewhat puzzled. 
But the man standing in front of him, merely glared at him and then suddenly erupted: “Then aren’t you going to make a call to ask? 
Do I still need to teach you how to handle such matters?”
###40: Chapter 40: People with Pupula Duplex always seek revenge! 
40 -40: People with Pupula Duplex always seek revenge! 
Assistant: “…” 
It was not that he needed to be taught, but rather that the young master’s anger was inexplicably ignited. 
After all these years, he had never even inquired about the matter; why suddenly ask him to call and check on it? 
Wasn’t that strange? 
The assistant was quite baffled by the request but, as the boss, even if he was dissatisfied, he still had to comply. 
So, he actually took out his mobile phone and dialed a number… noveldrama
Five minutes later, having already gotten into the car, Ou Yuze finally received a response from his assistant, “Young Master, I just inquired, and Miss Ye has been behaving well in prison, no troubles at all. 
You can rest assured. 
The assistant thought his boss was worried about his foster daughter causing trouble in jail. 
The man, who had been sitting in the car without much movement, upon hearing this news, finally relaxed the tense expression on his face. 
The lighter he had been tightly clutching in his palm loosened up and with a click, it finally sparked a flame! 
“Young Master, where would you like to go now?” 
“Royal!” 
The two words, devoid of any warmth, were tossed out. 
At this moment, the murderous look in the man’s eyes was terrifying enough to make someone shiver all over. 
Royal, wasn’t that the place he had just asked him to take Miss Yang? 
A cold sweat broke out on the assistant’s back… 
— 
On the outskirts of A City– 
Ye Ning, however, was unaware that someone was investigating her. 
After taking the bus back with Ye Xiaobao, she arrived at the rented house and went first to greet Aunt Chunhua, asking her for a favor. 
As she expected, the landlady was a very warmhearted person. 
Hearing that she had been asked to pick up and drop off Xiaobao, she, being someone who already adored children, immediately agreed. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning gave her some money and went upstairs reassured. 
By the time she went upstairs, it had already gotten dark. 
Seeing this, she began to prepare the meal, planning to make dinner, but Xiaobao, who had been playing outside all day, was already asleep on the couch, not even noticing her entry. 
This little rascal! 
Ye Ning saw the tiny child cuddling with a pillow on there, like a little kitten, and couldn’t help but laugh. 
She went over and picked up the tiny bundle, “Darling, shall we go to bed?” 
“Okay…” 
The sleep-flushed Little Tuanzi, snuggled in her arms, lacked his usual precocious demeanor. 
Right now, he was more like a soft Little Baozi. 
Holding him, she could even smell the milky scent on him. 
Indeed, he was still so young, just four years old. 
If it were not because she was a single mother without anyone to protect them, how could such a tiny child act like a little man, to protect her? 
Her adorable little treasure! 
Ye Ning watched him and, after giving his plump little face a strong kiss, carried him to bed, then washed him up a bit. 
Afterward, she had a quick bite and then went to sleep as well. 
Today, she was truly exhausted; so many things had happened that it wore her out, but thankfully, she ultimately achieved her goal. 
The Ou family! 
She had finally managed to gain entry, and once inside, she would soon see those people at the Blue Mountain Villa. 
Just wait, she would take back everything they had taken from her, bit by bit. 
And the pain and persecution they had inflicted on her, she would make them repay a thousandfold. 
Those with Pupula Duplex never forgive an offense lightly!
###41: Chapter 41 The new special assistant is actually sitting in the president’s office!! 
41 -41 The new special assistant is actually sitting in the president’s office!! 
The next morning, Ye Ning, having to work downtown, got up early and sent Xiaobao down to the landlord. 
Then, she boarded the bus heading to the city center. 
Qiao Feiyu had actually called the night before, mentioning that his brother would send over a car for her to use for commuting, but Ye Ning had declined. 
The job she had applied for was as an executive assistant at Ou Group. 
The salary wasn’t that high, and she’d even told that man yesterday the reason she applied at his company was because she was struggling to support her child. 
If he were to find out she had a car, wouldn’t he become suspicious? 
So, Ye Ning decided, from now on she would take the bus! 
Luckily, it wasn’t too much trouble getting to the city center by bus, just a couple of transfers, and 45 minutes later, she was once again standing in front of that towering skyscraper. 
Ou Group! 
Getting off the bus, she stood in front of the plaza, took a deep breath upon seeing the “Ou Group” sign shining atop the towering building, and stepped forward into the skyscraper. 
“Hello, my name is An Ning, and I am starting work at your company today.” 
“An Ning?” 
The receptionist heard the name and flipped through the records she had. 
For the president’s office? 
She looked up at her in surprise. 
The woman standing before her had neat, ear-length hair and was dressed in a pure white English-style casual shirt with a grayish skirt underneath. 
Her attire wasn’t flashy, but standing there, her fair, snowy skin and delicate features did not pale in comparison to the gold-collared workers here. 
So, she was the new special assistant recruited for the president’s office? 
The clerk sent a look of envy, “You should go to the fifteenth floor. 
The people from the president’s office have already called, they said when you arrive, just go straight up.” 
Go straight up? 
Ye Ning was startled! 
Hadn’t that man told her to go to the HR department to complete the onboarding process first? 
Why was she going straight up now? 
Ye Ning was somewhat confused, but since the clerk had said so, she went to the elevator and headed for the fifteenth floor. 
The fifteenth floor, that was the core area of the skyscraper, the place that controlled the operations of the entire building. 
It wasn’t a place just anyone could access freely. 
Ye Ning stepped into the elevator, thinking about going up to that place and meeting the man she had just seen yesterday. 
She couldn’t help but feel a bit nervous. 
What kind of work would that scion assign her, now that she had just arrived? 
When she was at Blue Mountain Villa, he was not easy to serve, and in all those years, she’d never seen a servant meet his standards. 
Now that she was here to be his special assistant, would she be able to satisfy him? 
Lost in thought, the elevator suddenly dinged, arriving at the floor… 
“Did you hear? 
The new special assistant hired today is coming to work.” 
“Really? noveldrama
Who is that person? 
I heard that Secretary Gao has interviewed many candidates these past days, but none were suitable. 
What are the credentials of this one, to get hired just like that?” 
“I don’t know, but I heard the president personally interviewed them. 
And, haven’t you noticed? 
This morning, there was an additional desk in the president’s office. 
I think that’s for the new special assistant!” 
“Oh my goodness!” 
As Ye Ning stepped out of the elevator, she overheard some people talking…
###42: Chapter 42 Spending Days and Nights Together 
42 -42 Spending Days and Nights Together 
What were they gossiping about? 
Ye Ning was too far away to hear clearly, so she didn’t pay much attention and walked straight over with her bag, “Hello, my name is An Ning, I’m the new arrival…” 
At that sentence, the silence at the front desk of the President’s office was immediate! 
An Ning? 
The newcomer? 
The women who had been talking about her all turned their gazes towards Ye Ning, their expressions strangely awkward. 
Ye Ning frowned slightly and was about to ask whom she should look for when suddenly, a head popped out from behind the glass door, “Are you An Ning?” 
It was the girl from yesterday who had been teased about her fake ring. 
Seeing her, Ye Ning quickly nodded and smiled, “Yes, I’m An Ning.” 
“Come in, the President will be here shortly. 
You should come in and sort these things out first, he needs to have a meeting when he returns.” 
The girl wasn’t very friendly, clearly because of the incident with the ring from yesterday. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning quickly moved away from the group that was still sizing her up and headed towards the girl. 
Once inside, she realized that the office was exceptionally large, with crystal-clear floor-to-ceiling windows and a floor laid with grey carpet, very clean and tidy. 
The desks, placed irregularly, added to the style rather than giving a sense of disorder. 
Clearly, this is where those women who had been discussing her outside were seated. 
Ye Ning felt a sense of relief thinking the girl might have arranged for her to sit here, but to her surprise, Xiaochen led her past it and pushed open a door labeled “President’s Office.” 
“Miss Chen, what is this…?” 
“What? 
You don’t want to go in? 
You have only fifteen minutes. 
Let me tell you, if you’re not ready in fifteen minutes, wait to be kicked out of this building by Third Young Master!” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
No, why was she being directed to the President’s office? 
Wasn’t she the newcomer? 
Shouldn’t she be seated with the others outside? 
Ye Ning was feeling pretty awful, following inside, she saw a vast office with only a super luxurious and broad desk and another small and seemingly shabby desk by the door to the right. 
Her expression grew even worse! 
Did that mean, from now on, she’d be facing this notoriously difficult to please rich heir up close every day? 
Oh, no! 
This wasn’t what she wanted… 
What Ye Ning didn’t know was that the secretary, Gao, had made this arrangement purely because she was responsible for Yuzhirun, and Yuzhirun, as a new project heavily invested in by the Oushi President, meant that he thought it would be more convenient to deal with matters in the same office as the President. 
“Third Young Master, the meetings later are mainly regarding the incident that broke out at the jewelry store yesterday. 
Although we eventually proved our innocence, yesterday’s events caused Oushi shares to plummet, and quite a few shareholders are unhappy.” 
The secretary, Gao, who had just parked the car, reminded the man behind him who was still busy reading emails on his phone. noveldrama
Unhappy? 
As soon as he uttered the comment, the man behind, who was already expressionless, grew visibly more sullen, “Unhappy about what? 
Wanting to cancel the project again?” 
The secretary Gao kept silent! 
Cancellation was quite normal, wasn’t it? 
The project wasn’t looked at favorably to begin with. 
However, the man behind only made that remark, a cold glint appearing on his lips as he pushed open the car door and got out. 
Seeing this, Gao hurriedly got out of the car and followed, “Oh, and Third Young Master, Miss An started her job today.”
###43: Chapter 43 Who let you in? 
43 -43 Who let you in? 
No one paid attention to him, and the man whose eyes never left his phone screen seemed as if he didn’t exist at all, as he stepped into the elevator. 
Upon seeing this, Secretary Gao felt a tightness in his chest… noveldrama
Should he tell him that he had arranged for the new woman to go to his office? 
Two minutes later, on the fifteenth floor, President’s office- 
“Good morning, Third Master!” 
“Good morning, Third Master!” 
“…” 
Secretary Gao pulled Xiaochen to the side, “Has that new girl named An Ning arrived?” 
Xiaochen pointed towards the President’s office, “Yes, there she is. 
Following your orders, I am having her familiarize herself with Yuzhirun’s materials.” 
Secretary Gao turned to look in that direction and saw that the President, who had entered before him, was pushing open the office door. 
Suddenly, he shivered inexplicably and grabbed Xiaochen’s arm, “Thirsty? 
Let’s go for some coffee.” 
Xiaochen protested, “I am not thirsty. 
Hey, so early in the morning, why drink coffee?” 
“If I say you’re thirsty, you’re thirsty, hurry up!” 
“…” 
Meanwhile, inside the President’s office, Ou Mucen, who finally entered with his briefcase, was taken aback when he saw an extra desk in his workspace, and even more so when he noticed a woman squatting beneath it, “What are you doing here?” 
Ye Ning, who was squatting on the ground picking up the papers she had accidentally dropped, suddenly heard someone talking to her and looked up! 
This was a man whose presence was immediately commanding. 
He wore a dark blue pinstripe suit, a pristine white shirt underneath without a tie; the shirt’s collar turned out and casually draped over the suit, which far from looking incongruous, added to his air of elegance, indolence, and nobility. 
He was the master of this office! 
Ye Ning quickly realized who he was, grabbed the items in her hand, and stood up, “Third Young Master, you’re here?” 
Third Young Master? 
That was what people called him back at Blue Mountain Villa. 
Ou Mucen’s eyes narrowed slightly as he stared at the woman who had appeared in his office so early in the morning without his permission, his expression darkening considerably, “Who let you in?” 
Who let her in? 
Ye Ning remembered Xiaochen, who had led her here upon her arrival and pointed outside, “It was… 
It was Xiaochen who brought me here, saying this was my desk.” 
Xiaochen? 
As soon as this name was mentioned, the atmosphere around him became even more terrifying. 
Xiaochen was just an assistant; how could she have the authority to arrange this? 
The man, whose very aura was becoming increasingly fearsome, suddenly remembered the odd behavior of the secretary who had been following him earlier. 
Immediately, he tossed his notebook onto the desk and dialed out with his phone, “Tell Gao Ziyang to come see me!” 
“Third Master, Secretary Gao just said he had something to attend to and left!” 
“…” 
Something to attend to? 
Very well, let him have something to attend to forever! 
All the murderous intent of hell seemed to surface on his steel-blue handsome face, “Tell him, he doesn’t need to come back ever again!” 
My God! 
There was a shocked exclamation from the phone, “Third Master…” 
“…” 
No one spoke anymore, and the only sound in the phone was a beeping busy tone… 
It was done; Secretary Gao had really messed up! 
Ye Ning was also watching from inside with a pounding heart. 
This man’s reaction was so extreme, it seemed that arranging her to this office wasn’t his idea, which meant? 
She actually didn’t have to work here?
###44: Chapter 44 Aren’t you hurrying to catch up? 
44 -44 Aren’t you hurrying to catch up? 
She thought as much, with his level of obsession with cleanliness—so extreme that while at Blue Mountain Villa, no one was even allowed to breathe within three meters of where he stood—how could he possibly share an office with her? 
Ye Ning exhaled in relief, noticing the man across the room had hung up the phone, so she swiftly tidied up the items in her hands, planning to skedaddle the moment he asked her to scram. 
However, just as she was filled with hope, ready to leave, someone suddenly knocked and entered, “President, the shareholders are already waiting in the meeting room. 
Do you want to go now?” 
A meeting? 
The man, who had been standing there without so much as a drink of water, remembered the matter and immediately, his handsome visage grew even darker, “What about the materials you were supposed to prepare? 
Are they ready?” 
The person nodded, “Xiaochen said it’s all ready, in the hands of the new assistant.” 
With that comment, the gaze of the two people in the office turned towards Ye Ning, who stood by the small table. 
Ye Ning froze, sensing the two sharp stares fixed on her like knives. 
She hurriedly searched the table and picked up the documents Xiaochen had asked her to sort out, “Yes, they’re here with me. 
I was just about to hand them to you. 
Third Young Master!” 
“This is for me?” 
“Huh?” 
“An Ning, that’s meant for the shareholders in the meeting room. 
As an assistant, you’re giving them to the Third Young Master?” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
Fuck, how was she supposed to know? 
No one had told her; she was brought to this office by some inexplicable woman early in the morning and asked to sort these out. 
How could she know these were meant for the shareholders in the meeting room? 
Ye Ning felt like she was going to lose her mind. 
Seeing the man across from her glaring at her fiercely before leaving with a ghastly pale face, carrying the notebook, she seriously considered making a beeline for the exit. 
A bunch of lunatics! 
And the person who had come in was somewhat kind, seeing her still standing there in a daze, he quickly reminded her, “What are you still doing standing there? 
Hurry up with whatever you have in your hands and follow them!” 
“Ah? 
Oh, oh, oh…” 
Jolted by this reminder, Ye Ning snapped out of her stupor and hurriedly followed, clutching the stack of documents. 
The Third Young Master of the Ou Family was known throughout Blue Mountain to be the most difficult to serve, with his erratic personality and mood swings. noveldrama
No one knew what he truly liked or needed. 
The only certainty was that you absolutely shouldn’t cross him, otherwise, you’d end up in a world of hurt. 
Ye Ning was well aware of this and thus, determined to grit her teeth and endure, no matter what she encountered after leaving with the documents. 
Running along, she saw the silhouette of the man who had entered the meeting room just ahead. 
Hurrying after him, she pushed the door and came in… 
“Third Young Master, good morning!” 
“Third Young Master, is today’s shareholders meeting about yesterday’s Yuzhirun incident?” 
“Third Young Master, our Ou Family’s stock market took quite a hit because of that incident yesterday.” 
“…” 
When Ye Ning entered carrying the stack of papers, she almost lost feeling in her legs from fright! 
My goodness, this meeting room is huge! 
And all the seats are filled. 
Could all these people be Ou Family shareholders? 
As Ye Ning walked in, many of those seated around the conference table looked up at her, sending a wave of nervousness through her, and her eyes involuntarily glanced towards the man she had followed in.
###45: Chapter 45: The Third Young Master’s New Mistress… 
45 -45: The Third Young Master’s New Mistress… 
By his side was a chair. 
Was that meant for her to sit? 
She remembered seeing on TV how, during a corporate meeting, the assistant would sit beside the president. 
With that in mind, she pursed her lips and mustered her courage to approach him, “Young Master Third…” 
“Distribute the documents in your hands to them!” 
He actually acknowledged her presence instead of ignoring her, sparing her embarrassment! 
He even spoke to her! 
Invigorated by this, Ye Ning responded and began distributing the stack of materials she was holding around the meeting table, handing them out one by one. 
In the Ou Family’s president’s office, there were actually quite a few young and beautiful staff members responsible for various affairs, probably five or six of them. 
So, when Ye Ning handed out the documents, these people didn’t even pay attention to who she was, thinking she was just one of the female staff. 
Once she finished, Ye Ning returned to her spot. 
She had been intending to ask if she should leave, 
but when she looked down and saw the man sitting in front of her had already opened his laptop and was rapidly typing away, her courage failed her. 
She didn’t dare to interrupt him. 
After glancing at the chair behind her again, she took a seat there once more, emboldened. 
Now was the time for the meeting, and it didn’t seem right for her to leave. 
“Everyone, please take a look at the financial statement of Yuzhirun since its inception, along with the future expansion plans in the materials you now have in hand. 
If you have any questions, ask me after you’re done looking them over.” 
As if he hadn’t heard the shareholders’ complaints when they had come in, he had Ye Ning distribute the documents and then immediately launched into his subject. 
At the end of his statement, tension immediately filled the meeting room! 
Yuzhirun was a new investment project of the Ou Family. 
When it was first proposed, it did not receive much approval from the shareholders because everyone knew that the Ou Family had another established brand under their control, Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry. 
If the Ou Family already had such a prestigious brand, why establish a new one? 
Was this a mere spat with money? noveldrama
The shareholders started to get restless, particularly when they thought about the stock market plummeting the day before, which made their expressions even grimmer, “Young Master Third, do we really continue with the Yuzhirun brand?” 
“Why not continue?” 
“As everyone knows, Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry of the Ou Family is already a well-known established brand. 
Suddenly introducing Yuzhirun would not only be suppressed by Dragon-Phoenix but also lead outsiders to speculate conflicts between you and the Second House of the Ou Family. 
This is very bad for the Ou Family.” 
Conflicts? 
The man who had been typing on the keyboard upon hearing this finally lifted his head coldly, “Do we need to speculate about our discord? 
Isn’t it already public knowledge?” 
The shareholders: “…” 
Ye Ning quickly turned her head to look elsewhere, as if afraid that people could see the uncontrollable expression on her face… 
Indeed, no one could match his harshness and venomous tongue! 
Another moment of silence ensued. 
The shareholders in the meeting room fell quiet, but from their faces, it was still evident that they were quite dissatisfied, very much opposed to this matter. 
Ye Ning, seeing this, couldn’t help but worry; if these shareholders didn’t agree, then the future of Yuzhirun looked bleak. 
However, what surprised her was that after gauging the mood in the room, the man simply cast a cold glance over them…
###46: Chapter 46 She did something bad? 
He is staring at her like this!! 
46 -46 She did something bad? 
He is staring at her like this!! 
“Yuzhirun project, I’m determined to go ahead with it, and I will invest in your shares according to the proportion. 
As for the losses, don’t worry. 
If it really comes to that, it’ll all be on me, Ou Mucen!” noveldrama
The last statement was like a shot of adrenaline. 
Talk about dominance! 
The people in the conference room immediately became restless again. 
They looked at the paper in their hands with faces bursting with excitement, a complete 180 from their demeanor just before. 
This is the opportunism of businessmen! 
Ye Ning couldn’t help but flash a hint of mockery in her eyes when she saw this. 
With their last bit of worry gone, the crowd’s attitude took a complete 120-degree turn, “Mr. 
Mucen, we didn’t mean that. 
We were just saying that Yuzhirun is a bit young…” 
“If there are no ions, then let’s continue the meeting!” Without any sentimentality, he cut them off and opened the project proposal that had already been prepared on the laptop. 
When Ye Ning saw this, she almost wanted to laugh, but when she glanced at the flushed faces of those around the conference table, she dared not be too brazen. 
So, out of boredom, her gaze naturally fell on the opened proposal on the laptop in front of her. 
Her seat was exactly behind his, at an angle from which she could see very clearly. 
1. 
Product Design; 
2. 
Sourcing Channels; 
… 
Just as she was getting into it, she felt something wasn’t right above her head. 
With a slight move, she realized that while she was looking at the laptop, its owner had also turned his head to look at her, and at that moment, his gaze was as icy as it gets. 
What’s wrong? 
Did she do something mistaken? 
Why was his look so unpleasant and dissatisfied? 
Ye Ning’s heart skipped a beat. 
She quickly withdrew her gaze and hurriedly checked her own hands to see if there was anything left undistributed, or if she had forgotten something else. 
However, much to her chagrin, apart from a few scraps of paper left over from what had already been handed out, she had nothing more. 
Moreover, when she had come in this time, Xiaochen had only instructed her to sort out the materials, so why was he staring at her with that look? 
She hadn’t done anything wrong, had she? 
“I say, Miss Assistant, is this your first time attending a meeting with Mr. 
Mucen? 
Do you need him to remind you to even take notes?” 
“…” 
Ah! 
Notes!! 
Ye Ning finally understood and immediately prepared to take action, but… where were her pen and paper? 
Ye Ning was frantic once more, realizing that in her rush to get here, she hadn’t brought a pen, let alone a notebook. 
Dammit! 
Who knew being an assistant required taking notes? 
Although she could write on the blank spaces on the back of those extra materials in her hand, without a pen, she couldn’t take notes. 
Ye Ning was truly sweating bullets. 
Everyone in the meeting room was staring at her, and in her anxiousness, she suddenly spotted a small blue next to the man’s notebook in front of her. 
A pen! 
“Mr. 
Mucen, I… 
my pen has run out of ink, I’ll borrow yours,” she said, standing up without waiting for his approval, and grabbed the pen as if it was hers he keep. 
The people in the meeting room were agape! 
Who the heck is this assistant? 
She even dares to just take Mr. 
Mucen’s stuff—doesn’t she know her BOSS has a serious case of germophobia and doesn’t allow anyone to touch his things?
###47: Chapter 47 Is she a pig? 
47 -47 Is she a pig? 
Moreover, as an assistant, if she couldn’t even prepare the basic necessities for a meeting like pens and paper, then what right did she have to stay in Oushi? 
To remain in this CEO office? 
Poor little assistant! 
For a moment, those people stared at the petite figure, who was now furiously scribbling down notes, and they even began to feel sorry for her. 
But the fact was, when that woman took the pen from the table, the man sitting there did have a flash of iciness in his eyes for an instant. 
However, as she sat down and started writing rapidly on the few scraps of paper propped on her lap, his eyes narrowed and the dark cloud on his face slowly dissipated. 
“Let’s continue the meeting, we were discussing the supply channels…” 
“…” 
The meeting lasted a full one and a half hours, with of course, all discussions centered around the new brand, Yuzhirun. noveldrama
Ye Ning sat there, writing for the whole one and a half hours. 
Actually, she didn’t really understand how to take notes. 
She had just arrived, never having engaged in the assistant profession, and had no idea how to go about taking notes? 
So, during that one and a half hours, all she did was record the meeting content in her own way. 
Fortunately, she was clever as could be. 
Although the meeting minutes she took were not quite standard, she managed to capture all the important points. 
After the meeting, when the shareholders had left, Ye Ning gathered up the densely written pages she had in her hand, “Third Young Master, your pen…” 
Snap! 
No one answered her. 
The only response was the sound of the notebook being forcefully closed. 
At that, Ye Ning felt an involuntary shiver in her heart! 
He couldn’t be… 
about to send her away, could he? 
After all, she couldn’t even manage the basics, not to mention she had touched his belongings. 
“Third Young Master, I’m sorry, I…” 
“Get the meeting minutes to my office in half an hour! 
And if you can’t, you can roll out of Oushi!” He finally spoke. 
His words were indeed harsh, and his tone exuded impatience. 
But after he finished speaking, Ye Ning stood there, stunned! 
What? 
What did she just hear? 
He just wanted her meeting minutes? 
What about the pen? 
She had been so frightened by him just a moment ago that she hadn’t reacted right away. 
So… his intention was, not to hold her accountable for using his pen? 
But to see if she had the capability to do well as an assistant? 
Ye Ning stood there, stunned for a good while, until she finally came to. 
Once she did, she was of course thrilled. 
Seeing that the Taoist Priest silhouette had already left the conference room, she hurriedly clutched the papers filled with writing and chased after him. 
“Third Young Master, don’t worry, I will definitely organize them well to hand over to you.” 
“…” 
“But, Third Young Master, where should I sit? 
My desk is still inside your office…” 
“…” 
Ye Ning was getting a little forgetful of her place and blurted out such a question. 
The result was, right after she said that—click! 
The figure that had been walking in front suddenly stopped, and then, Ye Ning saw, the aura around him seemed as if dark clouds were descending, becoming instantly heavy. 
“How about I give up my spot to you?” 
“…” 
Ye Ning was petrified! 
Quickly covering her mouth, she didn’t dare look at him any longer, clutching what she had and running off as if she was flying. 
Too scary! 
How could she be stupid enough to ask him that question? 
Had she forgotten that before the meeting began, he had been thunderous just over this matter? 
So stupid!
###48: Chapter 48 She Was Sold Again 
48 -48 She Was Sold Again 
Ye Ning entered with several sheets of paper in hand and to her surprise came face to face with Secretary Gao. 
Secretary Gao, seeing her hurried entrance, also turned pale, “Miss An, why are you in such a panic? 
Did Third Young Master chase you out?” 
Ye Ning immediately stopped, “No, he just asked me to organize the meeting notes. 
Oh, Secretary Gao, I thought you went out. 
Are you done with your errands?” 
Secretary Gao: “…” 
It was a sorrowful topic indeed, and Secretary Gao felt powerless. 
He glanced at the items she was holding and casually pointed towards a computer station at the back, “You can start organizing on that computer over there. 
I’ll find you a place later.” 
“Okay!” Ye Ning was more than willing and quickly went over with those papers. 
And what about Secretary Gao? 
After he watched her go, he gnashed his teeth and then went to the doorway to wait for that cold-hearted tyrant… 
As expected, three seconds later, the rhythmic sound of footsteps approached. noveldrama
Secretary Gao, upon seeing him, immediately put on a smile and respectfully bowed, “Third Young Master…” 
Click-clack, click-clack… 
No one paid him any attention. 
The man entering with a tablet acted as if he hadn’t seen him at all and strode in, his steps inducing fear and trepidation. 
Seeing this, Secretary Gao’s heart quivered, and he followed behind like a fawning dog, starting to explain, “Third Young Master, the reason I arranged for Miss An to sit in your office is because of a particular concern. 
Consider this, Miss An is the special assistant in charge of Yuzhirun, so she must handle many confidential documents, such as supply channels, new jewelry designs, and so on. 
If she were to sit outside, there’s a risk of confidential information being leaked if someone were to see by accident…” 
The last sentence was key! 
Ye Ning, who had just sat down at the computer station, suddenly felt a sense of foreboding upon hearing this. 
Could it be? 
She had just considered Secretary Gao her lifesaver, and now he had turned around and betrayed her? 
What happened to trust? 
Ye Ning felt completely uneasy! 
She had been sitting there for roughly ten minutes when the door to the CEO’s office opposite her opened, “An Ning, come in quickly. 
Third Young Master has agreed to let you work inside.” 
It was Secretary Gao! 
At that moment, his smile was as bright as a flower, as if he had achieved something incredibly spectacular. 
Ye Ning really wanted to throw her shoe at his face. 
She reluctantly gathered the half-organized papers she held and went over, “Secretary Gao, actually, it’s fine for me to sit outside.” 
Secretary Gao immediately glared, “How can that be okay? 
You are the CEO’s special assistant. 
Do you know what ‘special assistant’ means? 
It means you’re a special aide, your status is different from everyone else here.” 
Ye Ning pursed her lips! 
What about you then? 
You’re still a secretary, the CEO’s personal secretary. 
Why aren’t you sharing an office with him? 
What Ye Ning didn’t know was that the reason the secretary had arranged things this way was entirely because, after many years of torment from that capricious heir, he wanted a break, which is why he pushed Ye Ning forward. 
But actually? 
The person inside had agreed because of the very last thing he said—secrets! 
He looked at the email displaying in the notebook from Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry regarding new supply channels, and his eyes revealed a mysterious flicker…
###49: Chapter 49: Did She Expose Something? 
49 -49: Did She Expose Something? 
Ye Ning was holding those few pieces of paper when she came in, and the man seated behind that spacious office desk was staring blankly at the laptop screen. 
When she saw this, she immediately lowered her footsteps, intending to quietly return to her own desk. 
She had only just irritated him, and at this time, she thought it best not to disturb him if possible. 
But just as she was about to reach her desk, the man’s indifferent voice came from behind, “Your master is Lin Yebai, do you know about Yixiantian?” 
Yixiantian? 
Ye Ning turned around, looking at the man with some surprise… 
She certainly knew of Yixiantian; it was a famous teahouse in A City, located in the old western district, a century-old establishment passed down through generations with excellent business. 
However, Yixiantian’s fame was not solely because of its tea; it was known for another reason that was not publicly recognized—that it was the only private antique auction venue in this city. 
As everyone knows, because antiques are very valuable, in order not to be deceived, most people choose regular auction companies to sell their items to protect their interests. 
Private auction venues are not their choice. 
Yet Yixiantian was truly a magical existence in A City, where many people preferred to sell their treasures rather than go to regular auction companies. 
They brought their valuables here as if coming to an underground market, without worrying about problems with their items. 
After paying a commission, they just waited for Yixiantian to sell their items. 
This blind trust was truly baffling. 
So, in A City, as long as someone was involved in antiques, they basically knew about Yixiantian. 
But why was he suddenly asking about Yixiantian? 
He wasn’t into antiques! 
Ye Ning was puzzled, “Of course I know about Yixiantian; it’s a famous antique auction venue in A City. 
Does the Third Young Master want to go there for an auction? 
As far as I know, although the antiques there are not bad, using them for processing our Yuzhirun products would be very unwise.” 
What she said was the truth and meant as a kind reminder. 
Antiques were meant for collection—who would be foolish enough to buy something at such a high price only to process it into a piece of jewelry to sell? 
Only if they had a problem with their brain. 
But upon hearing her words, the man’s eyes merely stared at her and narrowed slightly, revealing a hint of an ambiguous glow… 
She indeed knew the place! 
“It seems you do indeed have a very good understanding of this field,” 
Ye Ning immediately humbly lowered her head, “Not really, Third Young Master is mistaken; I only followed my master there a few times, that’s how I know.” noveldrama
“Is that so? 
Then do you know when they typically start their auction?” 
“Usually it’s on the first or fifteenth of each month, one session in the morning and one in the afternoon,” Ye Ning replied reflexively, not noticing the man’s expression as she instinctively answered his question. 
The first? 
The fifteenth? 
Only after she finished speaking did she suddenly see the man sitting opposite her glance at the electronic calendar on his desk. 
In that instant, a very unpleasant feeling rose in her heart. 
“Third Young Master…” 
“The first, the fifteenth, and today happens to be the fifteenth. 
Pack up and come with me to that place!” With a snap, he closed the laptop, decisively to the point of being alarming!
###50: Chapter 50 The first day at work and she’s already going out with the CEO… 
50 -50 The first day at work and she’s already going out with the CEO… 
Ye Ning was stunned… 
Had she missed something just now? 
Had she failed to observe something? 
Why would he suddenly want to go to Sant Road? 
Ye Ning couldn’t keep up with the pace, watching as the man had already packed his things and grabbed his briefcase. 
Finally, she hesitantly asked, “Should I… 
go too?” 
The man immediately looked at her expressionlessly, “What? 
You don’t want to go?” 
Ye Ning was taken aback! 
Of course, she didn’t want to go. 
There was an auction there today where many rare antiques would appear. 
If the goods were too good, she wouldn’t be able to control her eyes, and that would be troublesome. 
However, seeing his clearly displeased expression, as if he was ready to kick her out immediately if she didn’t go, she had no choice but to quickly shake her head, “No, no, it’s just that I can’t believe I get to go out with Mr. 
Third on my first day of work.” 
“…” 
That was some good flattery, albeit a bit exaggerated, but indeed a reaction expected from a new employee. 
Ou Mucen finally said nothing more, glaring at her with disgust, and left first with his briefcase. 
Did he really think he wanted to bring her along? 
If it wasn’t for the fact that she knew about that place… 
Seeing this, Ye Ning didn’t dare to delay any longer, quickly putting down what she was holding onto the desk, and promptly retrieved her handbag from the drawer. 
Should she find some glasses? 
When Ye Ning came out, she was preoccupied with this problem, but until she went downstairs to the parking lot, she didn’t have the chance to find those glasses, so reluctantly, she had no choice but to get in the car. 
At the parking lot, a black Bentley sedan was already running in the CEO’s reserved parking spot. 
She glanced over and saw the man who had come down before her, sitting in the driver’s seat, head bowed doing something. noveldrama
Hastily, she approached, “Mr. 
Third…” 
Ou Mucen was setting up the navigation. 
Hearing the woman’s voice outside, he lightly pressed on the car keys with his slender fingers, and immediately, the door locks were opened. 
“What road is Sant Road?” 
“Ah?” 
Ye Ning had just settled into the luxurious car and wasn’t quite used to it yet. 
“I think it’s… 
Sant Road?” 
“…” 
No one spoke again. 
In the now-closed car, only the sounds of fingers touching the screen could be heard. 
After a short while, a mechanical female voice came from the navigation system, “Navigation starting, 15 kilometers to destination, journey approximately 20 minutes…” 
It takes as long as 20 minutes… 
Sitting in the back, Ye Ning heard this voice and couldn’t help but grip the handbag on her lap a little tighter. 
In fact, she was a person with a strong adaptability. 
She had been that way in the orphanage as a child, and later on, when she was adopted by the woman from Blue Mountain Villa, she adapted quickly. 
Even those five dreadful years, she had adjusted to them as well. 
But today, for some reason, she felt nervous and uncomfortable around this man, as if he could see right through her at any moment, uncovering her secret, making her extremely uneasy. 
Could it be… 
because of what happened yesterday, that his brutal methods had intimidated her? 
She thought about the small celebrity who had been toyed with by him yesterday, and how her every move from the beginning hadn’t escaped his eyes. 
Finally, she turned her head to look out of the car window…
###51: Chapter 51: Taking the Rich Second Generation to the Vegetable Market? 
51 -51: Taking the Rich Second Generation to the Vegetable Market? 
Before long, the navigation was set, and Ye Ning only felt a slight motion beneath her before the car slowly moved out of the parking lot. 
From the city center to the old city district, it was indeed quite a distance. 
A City, being a centuries-old historic town, had seen many important government institutions and major commercial areas move to the newly expanded urban district since the economic reforms. 
The old district had become a neglected, disused area. 
Still, that didn’t stop it from remaining a bustling hustle and bustle. 
Driving from the city center, the further in you went, the more congested the roads became, especially when approaching the “One Line Sky” area, where traffic was so heavy it was practically at a standstill. 
Ye Ning, observing from inside the car, couldn’t help but say, “Third Master, why don’t we find a place to park the car around here? 
We’re not far from One Line Sky, it’s only about a five-minute walk.” 
Walk there? 
She was asking him to walk? 
Already somewhat irritated by the traffic jam, Ou Mucen’s mood worsened when he heard the woman behind him, “What kind of messy place is this? 
Isn’t One Line Sky very famous? 
How can it be located in such an area?” 
Ye Ning immediately felt embarrassed, “Third Master, you may not know, but Sant Road used to be the most bustling street in the old city, akin to the current area of Ou’s Department Store. 
However, over the years as the city expanded, many businesses moved out, and an old market was established here…” 
An old market? 
Was she actually saying there was a market here? 
The man driving the car caught sight of several elderly men and women carrying baskets of vegetables walking by and immediately frowned deeply before slamming on the brakes! 
Ye Ning, who was looking out the window for a parking spot, was jolted forward against the seat in front due to the sudden braking, “Ugh…” 
What was he doing? 
Stopping the car suddenly on the road, didn’t he know it was very dangerous? 
Ye Ning, seeing stars after the impact, barely managed to steady herself. 
Looking out the window with displeasure, she said, “Third Master, we can’t just stop the car anywhere here, this place…” 
“Get out of the car!” 
“What?” 
“Can’t understand? 
Or should I say it again?” Ou Mucen’s tone was extremely menacing, likely because his mood at that moment was really foul. 
Ye Ning didn’t dare to speak further, obediently opened the car door and stepped out. 
She didn’t dare to ask where he was going? noveldrama
What she was supposed to do, wait for him? 
Or was that it? 
So she just stood there by the roadside. 
Forget it, let him do whatever he wants. 
After all, he is the privileged heir; he has the final say in everything. 
If worst comes to worst and he leaves her behind to return to the company, she could just take the bus back. 
So after standing on the sidewalk, she watched the black Bentley U-turn and leave, then walked into a nearby convenience store. 
“Miss, what would you like to buy?” 
“Water, please, thank you!” 
Ye Ning was indeed thirsty. 
Since she arrived at the company in the morning, she had been running around nonstop without a break to sit down, let alone drink any water. 
Picking up a bottle of water, she twisted off the cap and took a sip before running outside again to look in the direction where the Bentley had disappeared. 
It was over, still no one around. 
It seemed that the privileged heir had truly left her behind! 
Well, who was he really? 
He was someone who grew up with a golden key in his mouth, leading a life of luxury. 
When had he ever been to such a dirty and smelly place? 
Seen such a dense and unbearable crowd?
###52: Chapter 52. 
Is he crazy? 
Is he?! 
52: Chapter 52. 
Is he crazy? 
Is he?! 
Ye Ning sighed, took another sip from her water bottle, and decided to look for a bus to head back. 
But just as she turned around, her phone, which was in her purse, suddenly rang. 
She took it out to look… 
Huh? 
Secretary Gao? 
Ye Ning paused for a moment and picked up the phone, “Hello, Secretary Gao?” 
“An Ning, where are you? 
Hurry to Left Bank Coffee on Sant Road and find Young Master Mu!” 
“…” 
What? 
Go find him? 
Why? 
Didn’t he leave? 
Ye Ning stood there, dazed for quite a while, not coming to her senses. 
So, he didn’t drive back? 
Instead, he just went to park, and after parking somewhere — or maybe he never planned to look for her in the first place — remotely instructed Secretary Gao to notify her to come find him? 
Ye Ning felt like she was losing her mind! 
No, why is he making things so complicated? 
If he had just come over here after parking, wouldn’t that have been the end of it? 
Why did she have to go find him? 
And what’s with having Secretary Gao call her? 
Was he so high and mighty that he couldn’t even be bothered to call her himself? 
This despicable scion! 
Ye Ning was about to explode with anger. 
After hanging up, she looked along the roadside but didn’t see any Left Bank Coffee. 
Reluctantly, she returned to the convenience store where she had bought the water earlier, “Excuse me, do you know if there’s a Left Bank Coffee shop around here?” 
“Yes, there is. 
Just turn around the corner there, by that big building. 
You see…” 
Ye Ning followed the direction pointed out, and suddenly, she was practically out of breath… 
How could there be someone like this in the world? 
Just for parking a car, did he have to go so far? 
Were there really no parking spots nearby? 
Ye Ning’s mood was terribly sour. 
She thought about just ignoring him, but after struggling with the decision, she didn’t dare. noveldrama
In the end, she had to toughen up, carrying her bottle of water, and head towards the big building. 
Yes, he was her boss now. 
Even if there were mountains of knives and seas of fire ahead, she had to go. 
So, fifteen minutes later, sure enough, she saw the black Bentley with a license plate of five “9’s” in the parking lot in front of that building. 
Left Bank Coffee! 
Ye Ning walked over and looked at the building that was essentially no longer part of the Sant Road area. 
She stepped towards the coffee shop at the main entrance of the building. 
“Excuse me, is there a Mr. 
Ou here?” 
“Mr. 
Ou? 
Yes, he’s over there.” 
As soon as she entered and mentioned “Mr. 
Ou,” the café staff immediately pointed to the hall where there was a man sitting by the window. 
Ye Ning took a look and was once again furious! 
What kind of people were these? 
She was out there working hard to find him, and he was sitting here leisurely drinking coffee and reading a magazine. 
Didn’t his conscience hurt at all? 
Ye Ning finally got a bit angry. 
She walked over, didn’t greet him, and just stood in front of him and said, “Young Master Mu, why did you park your car here? 
It’s very far from One Line Sky.” 
Ou Mucen had been sitting there for a while now. 
Hearing her voice, at last, he raised his gaze from the magazine. 
His eyes were chilling and slightly unnerving, “You’re five minutes late!” 
“What?” 
“Remember, this is the first time. 
If there is a second time, you don’t have to come anymore!” Like a robot without any warmth, after he coldly uttered these few words, he snapped the magazine shut and stood up to leave! 
Ye Ning’s mouth gaped open, and once again, she was struck by lightning… 
Is he insane? 
Is he? 
Really, is he?!!
###53: Chapter 53: The Woman That Suddenly Appeared! 
53 -53: The Woman That Suddenly Appeared! 
Ye Ning felt she was reaching her breaking point because she encountered so many bizarre incidents today. 
She had mentally prepared herself that serving the affluent young master wouldn’t be easy, but the absurdity of the situation still left her stunned! 
Watching the man walk away, she had no choice but to quickly follow him out, “Third Young Master, I wasn’t late, and Secretary Gao didn’t specify how quickly I needed to come, did she? 
Besides, I had to find my way here.” 
“…” 
No one paid attention to her. 
The figure striding ahead seemed to be completely oblivious to her existence. 
Once they stepped out of the café, Ye Ning saw a very young and beautiful girl already waiting for him outside. 
“Third Young Master, I can hardly believe you’d come here. 
Let’s go, please ensure the Third Young Master arrives at First Heaven within ten minutes!” the girl said and led the man standing at the café entrance to a very compact car parked by the door. 
Ye Ning was somewhat stunned! 
What was going on? 
Why did someone else have to take him to First Heaven? 
Could it be that he had made arrangements before she came to find him? 
She remembered the phone call made by Secretary Gao, and also the moment in the café when the man said she was five minutes late. 
Finally, she realized. 
It turned out, he really was waiting for her… 
“What are you still standing there for? 
Aren’t you coming” 
“Ah… 
Oh, right, coming at once!” Ye Ning’s mood suddenly improved, and she hurriedly jogged over, pulling open the rear car door to get in. 
Once inside, she realized the man was also sitting in the back… 
And it seemed that the moment she got in, his eyebrows instinctively furrowed. 
Was she not supposed to sit here? 
Ye Ning suddenly felt nervous again, but when she glanced at the front passenger seat, she suddenly thought it might not be her fault. 
He was the BOSS, and she was the employee. 
Wasn’t she supposed to sit in the back? 
It was he who, despite having a perfectly good front passenger seat, chose to sit in the back. 
If he was uncomfortable now, what did it have to do with her? 
Thinking this, Ye Ning felt much less nervous. 
The woman in front started the car upon seeing her enter, “Why has the Third Young Master suddenly decided to visit First Heaven today? 
Are you interested in antiques lately?” 
The tone was quite familiar! 
And she seemed very relaxed, without any sign of nervousness upon seeing him. 
Could it be that they knew each other? 
Ye Ning recalled how the woman greeted him before getting in the car, so she subconsciously leaned towards the window, thinking she, an outsider, should try not to disturb the two. noveldrama
However, to her surprise, after the woman asked her question, the man seated beside Ye Ning remained utterly silent. 
Instead, in the quiet cabin, the glow from a phone screen kept appearing beside her. 
What was he doing? 
Ye Ning glanced in his direction instinctively, and at a glimpse, she saw his phone on silent gaming mode… 
Cough cough cough cough cough… 
With her eye twitching violently, Ye Ning remembered his earlier disregard for her, and now seeing his even more blatantly rude behaviour, she finally turned her head slightly, “No, our president is just casually visiting First Heaven to take a look…”
###54: Chapter 54: Third Young Master, do you have your ID card with you? 
54 -54: Third Young Master, do you have your ID card with you? 
As a phrase fell, the atmosphere in the car seemed to change… 
Their CEO? 
The woman driving glanced back through the rearview mirror and saw the girl sitting in the back, her ear-length short hair, and on her plain face, although not exceedingly beautiful, the delicate and fair skin, along with a pair of bright eyes, made her look exceptionally ethereal and lovely, like an elegant orchid. 
Who is this girl? 
Why hadn’t she seen her before? 
Her eyes narrowed slightly, “You are…?” 
Ye Ning hurriedly smiled, “I am the new assistant recruited by President Ou, my name is An Ning.” 
A new assistant? 
The woman skeptically peered through the rearview mirror again at the man behind her, noting his rather indifferent expression at the time and his eyes not straying to the girl at all,, then suddenly, she breathed a sigh of relief! 
“So the Third Young Master of the Ou Family has recruited an assistant again, huh? 
Speaking of which, your office already has a lot of assistants, Third Young Master, how come you are still recruiting?” 
This woman really didn’t know how to play along; Ye Ning had just smoothed over her embarrassment, and yet she again recklessly shifted the topic back to the man behind them. 
You expect him to pay attention to you? 
Dream on! 
Ye Ning didn’t look over, she stealthily glanced at the man next to her, engrossed in what he was doing, and then turned her head to look out the window… 
Indeed, after the woman finished speaking, two whole minutes of silence filled the car, as if she didn’t exist at all. 
The woman, belatedly catching on, finally came to her senses and awkwardly withdrew her gaze, daring not to make another sound… 
Seeing this from the back, Ye Ning’s lips curled into a self-satisfied smirk and continued to look outside. 
Oddly enough, when they had been on their way here, it had been incredibly congested, but once they got into this car, she didn’t know what route was taken? 
It was smooth sailing all along, and soon, they could see the ancient outline of the teahouse up ahead. 
It was just as they were about to arrive that the man who had been occupied in the back finally looked at his wristwatch, realizing that, with this delay, it was almost noon. 
He furrowed his brows slightly, “What time does it start this afternoon?” 
“What?” 
“Eh?” 
Both women almost simultaneously looked at the man inside the car. noveldrama
However, as soon as Ye Ning saw the woman in the front responding, she promptly played it smart and turned her head back outside… 
She was an outsider, so of course, this was not the time to disturb them. 
Thus, the woman in the front, holding the steering wheel and finally being spoken to by the man behind her, instantly became very happy, “Three Young Master, are you talking about the One-Line Sky auction? 
I’m not very sure, as I usually don’t spend much time here, but I can ask for you right away.” 
“I wasn’t asking you!” 
“…” 
The air once again fell into a silence as still as death, as though it suddenly froze. 
Ye Ning sat there, stunned for quite a while, before realizing that he had been speaking to her, and she quickly turned her head, “It starts at half-past twelve in the afternoon and ends at half-past four.” 
“Can I go in directly?” 
“Yes, but you will need to show your ID…” 
At this point, Ye Ning paused, then cautiously asked, “Third Young Master, did you… bring your ID?” 
She really did not dare ask this question, who was this man? 
That was the Third Young Master of the Ou Family, a well-known figure throughout A City, okay? 
To ask him for his ID? 
Was she looking for trouble?
###55: Chapter 55: Isn’t The Third Young Master of the Ou Family Influential Enough? 
55 -55: Isn’t The Third Young Master of the Ou Family Influential Enough? 
Sure enough, as soon as the words were spoken, the atmosphere in the car turned tense, chilly, and even breathing became somewhat unnatural. 
“What does that mean? 
We need ID cards just to attend a mere auction? 
Who does Apex think it is? 
Third Young Master, don’t bother with it, I’ll take you in when the time comes!” The woman was also very dissatisfied, and with one sentence she had Ou Mucen leaving everything to her. noveldrama
Ye Ning puckered her lips and looked out the window… 
It wasn’t even her request, seriously, why was the anger directed at her? 
However, since she had said she’d handle it, that was even better; it saved Ye Ning the trouble, providing her with some relief. 
Thus, in the following time, nobody spoke again until the car arrived at the bustling district and stopped in front of the dark cyan building. 
Ye Ning pushed open the car door and got out, then she sighed as she looked at the familiar structure. 
Five years, and she had finally returned here; it still featured blue bricks and black tiles, as well as the same decorations and furnishings. 
If there had to be any difference, it would be the people — there were far fewer now than back then. 
Indeed, five years ago, Apex on Sant Road was in its heyday in the old city district, with shops aplenty and a never-ending stream of people. 
As a century-old brand, naturally, it would attract a large crowd. 
But now, with the reconstruction of the old city district and the nearby transformation into a vegetable market, few people came here unless they were truly here for the auction transactions. 
If it was just for regular tea and dining, the numbers were much, much less. 
Ye Ning walked over and saw the white diamond-shaped sign hanging at the entrance of the teahouse, now in its busy period. 
Her eyes narrowed slightly, and she stood silently, waiting for the two people behind her to catch up. 
The diamond-shaped white sign generally meant that the auction was about to begin admitting attendees. 
It would usually hang for about ten minutes; after which, it would be replaced with a black sign, and no matter how important you were, you wouldn’t be allowed entry. 
After a wait, footsteps approached from behind… 
“Third Young Master, wait here for me for a moment; I will be right back,” the woman said as she came over and then went straight toward the entrance. 
Ye Ning saw her, so she obediently stood there waiting. 
Ou Mucen also stood there, surveying the surroundings. 
Noticing the antiquated appearance of the teahouse, resembling the old residential houses, he frowned and asked, “Who exactly is the owner of Apex?” 
Ye Ning shook her head: “I’m not too clear, but from what my master said, he was a Tomb Raider Colonel, specialized in tomb raiding.” 
“Tomb raiding?” 
“Yes! 
That’s also why the security for coming here to auction is so strict; many of the items here have unclear origins. 
Right, Third Young Master, you’re not here today to actually bid on these items, are you?” 
Ye Ning was right, Apex was somewhat like an underground bank, only the underground bank laundered money, while Apex dealt in antiques. 
But similarly, many of those antiques also had illegal origins. 
Ou Mucen didn’t answer the question; instead, his gaze fell upon the woman at the entrance who seemed unable to resolve the issue even after such a long time. 
A glint of grim determination flashed through his eyes, and he promptly took out a glittering golden card: “Take this over to them!” 
Ye Ning looked down and was momentarily stunned! 
Was he really going to use his identity as the third heir of the Ou Family to get in?
###56: Chapter 56 The Young Master of the Second House of the Ou Family has also arrived… 
56 -56 The Young Master of the Second House of the Ou Family has also arrived… 
The card from the third young master of the Ou Family proved to be more effective than anything else. 
When Ye Ning carried it over, the two men barely glanced at it before immediately becoming very enthusiastic: “So it’s the third young master of the Ou Family who has arrived, what a rare guest, please follow me this way.” 
Finishing their words, they were about to lead the three inside! 
Ye Ning naturally went in smoothly, but when it was that woman’s turn to follow, the man standing at the door suddenly delivered a chilling sentence: “Miss Du, there’s no need for you to come in. 
Go about your business.” 
Upon hearing this, the woman’s face instantly turned red: “But…” 
There were no buts, for the man had said only that much before indifferently turning around and walking inside. 
Ye Ning stood there watching, feeling quite heartbroken for the woman… 
It was said that the third young master of the Ou Family was the man every unmarried woman in A City wanted to marry—he had all the capital to charm a woman: looks, money, power, status! 
He was the man every woman dreamt of having. 
Yet, who knew how cold, how heartless, how arrogant the real Ou Mucen was? 
He was practically a devil. 
Ye Ning watched the woman leave in a daze and quickly hastened her pace to catch up: “Third master, you let her leave; how will we get back later?” 
The man in front immediately let out a cold snort: “Don’t you have legs?” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
I do, but I’m afraid you don’t. 
Otherwise, for the short distance we just covered, we could have simply walked, so why bother taking the car? 
However, Ye Ning didn’t dare to say that. 
Instead, upon approaching the familiar venue ahead, she reached into her bag, took out a bottle of eye drops, and applied it to her eyes. 
Indeed, once the dark red curtains were lifted, a fragrance she hadn’t smelled for a long time assailed her nostrils, and with that scent, her pupils started to show flickers of coolness. 
“Third master, since your visit was so sudden, we didn’t prepare a proper seat for you. 
How about I arrange a seat in the front rows for you?” 
“Alright…” 
Ou Mucen glanced lightly around the venue, noting that the interior still had the layout of a tea house. 
Currently, it was filled with people all around, and in front of these tea tables, a rectangular mahogany stage stood prominently. 
He nodded and followed the man to his seat. 
Ye Ning followed suit. 
As she passed by, seeing all the people seated around, and given that the man who led them in had specially arranged seats for them in the front, she couldn’t help but feel even more perplexed. 
What exactly was he here for? 
Was he really here to bid on antiques? 
No, that seemed unlikely. 
Yuzhirun’s main focus was on jewelry; in other words, antique curios were basically of no consequence unless there was Original Jade Stone, which could actually be useful. 
However, at Yixiantian, only the Huo Family auctioned Original Jade Stone, and after the Huo Family signed a supply agreement with Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry years ago, they hadn’t appeared here since. 
So why was he here? noveldrama
Ye Ning was becoming more and more confused until suddenly, she heard a very soft voice: “Did the old master of the Huo Family come today?” 
“Yes, he is in the private room upstairs.” 
“Good, go tell the second son of the second room of the Ou Family that his uncle is also here. 
Tell him not to go to that private room to find Old Master Huo, to avoid being discovered by him.” 
Upon hearing just one sentence, Ye Ning stood there, feeling as if her mind had buzzed, and then she remained completely still!
###57: Chapter 57 Meeting an Enemy 
57 -57 Meeting an Enemy 
The second young master of the Ou family? 
And his uncle…? 
It was as if a sealed memory had suddenly been unlocked, and in this instant, those painful scenes that tormented her to the point of sleepless nights, all flooded her mind like a dam bursting. 
The second young master of the Ou family, Ou Yuze, was the reason that she, Ye Ning, had fallen into hell overnight. 
He said he loved her and had his mother adopt her from the orphanage because he liked her, but what was the result? 
That was nothing but a ruse because Yang Xueshan, that bitch, had told him the secret of her heterochromia, and he had plotted all this on purpose. 
Ridiculous, he was only 19 years old at the time. 
How could someone at 19 come up with such a vicious plan? 
Ye Ning stood there, feeling as though blades were scraping inch by inch through her body. 
She quickly turned around and saw a figure leaving the venue, so without hesitation, she followed suit. 
If Ou Yuze was here today, then Ou Mucen’s purpose for coming here was also clear; he was here to find out the true supply channels of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry. 
Indeed, Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry had prospered for many years, which was inseparable from its supply source. 
Only with good supplies could they make fine jewelry, and thus attract more customers. 
However, Yuzhirun had been investing for so long, and Ou Mucen had not planned in this area. noveldrama
Why did he suddenly think of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry’s supplies? 
This was not his style. 
Confused, Ye Ning saw the person she was following leave the event and quickly head to the VIP lounge of this tea house. 
It was in that small lounge where she glimpsed through the glass crack and saw the man sitting inside! 
Five years had passed, and she finally saw him again! 
His facial features were still the same, and the posture was familiar, but compared to five years ago, the face that once captivated her now disgusted her. 
Had she been blinded back then? 
How could she have fallen for such a man? 
“Mr. 
Ou, our manager asked me to let you know that your uncle is also at our event today, and to be careful,” said a voice. 
Uncle? 
Upon hearing this, Ou Yuze, who was sitting on the sofa smoking, suddenly looked a bit unsettled, “Ou Mucen? 
Why would he come here? 
Has he discovered something?” 
“Probably not. 
We only sent him the email about the supply channel this morning, so I think he’s here to verify whether the business we provided is our real supply channel,” replied the other voice. 
It was a woman’s voice, and very familiar! 
Ye Ning’s fingers instantly clenched into fists, and her gaze into the room turned ice cold! 
Inside was an incredibly beautiful woman with chestnut, wavy hair cascading flirtatiously over her shoulders. 
Her features were delicate, showing she had spent a lot of time getting ready to go out. 
It was just a pity that there was a bruise at the corner of her red lips, as if she had been struck. 
The bruise looked particularly jarring on her refined face. 
That was Yang Xueshan, her good sister from the orphanage—Yang Xueshan! 
It just so happened that she ran into these two today…
###58: Chapter 58: She was just a dog! 
58 -58: She was just a dog! 
Ye Ning’s eyes narrowed slightly, and her cold gaze was as sharp as blades, causing a chilling terror as she fixed her attention on the two people inside. 
“How did he find this place?” 
“I… 
I don’t know. 
Do we still have to meet with Mr. 
Huo today, Yu Ze?” 
Mr. 
Huo was the one whom they had specially arranged to meet today because of the decision made yesterday. 
As the second branch of the Ou family had discussed, the goods could be provided to Yuzhirun by the Huo Family, but the specifics of the delivery still needed further discussion. 
That’s why he had arranged to meet him today! 
But now, the man had found this place so quickly; could he still meet with Mr. 
Huo? 
With a sudden movement, he stood up, viciously throwing the cigarette butt on the floor, “Meet? 
Do you want him to catch even more of our flaws? 
You worthless, good-for-nothing wretch! 
If it weren’t for you, how could things have gotten to this point?” 
In less than a few sentences, this man, spewing venomous insults, violently knocked down the woman standing in front of him, pushing her onto the couch before storming out with a loud bang. 
Ye Ning, standing outside, withdrew her gaze, pretending to be a patron coming from another VIP lounge, and walked to the other side. 
Positioning herself correctly, she saw the man with an ashen face storm out of the lounge. 
He glanced at her standing there and left in a huff without recognition. 
After five years, Ou Yuze, have you really forgotten the woman standing before you? 
Ye Ning watched the rapidly disappearing figure emotionlessly then suddenly, a spine-chilling smile crept across her cold lips… 
“Yu Ze! noveldrama
Yu Ze, wait for me, Yu Ze…” 
As the man left, another figure rushed out of the lounge in a flurry, still with a delicate face and dressed in expensive attire. 
However, this time, her expression was like that of a dog! 
A dog that had been abandoned! 
But, even if she was reduced to a dog, the man who had already left didn’t linger; his figure disappeared in the blink of an eye. 
Ye Ning, standing there, watched her sway a bit before clenching her fists tightly. 
“Miss Yang…” 
“Ou Mucen! 
Ou Mucen!!” 
“…” 
“Miss Yang?” The person who followed was probably frightened by the woman’s fierce expression; they only dared to say a few words and then fell silent. 
Ou Mucen? 
It seems she really hates him, calling out his name twice through gritted teeth, her eyes still bloodshot. 
Ye Ning stood quietly in the background, wanting to see what she would do next. 
Unexpectedly, the woman stood there for a while, then suddenly opened her bag and took out an item, “Go, give this to Mr. 
Huo, tell him that the supplies for Yuzhirun will be matched according to this from now on!” 
The man looked at the ratio table in his hands, and his face eventually paled, “Miss Yang, isn’t this a bit inappropriate? 
Do the second master, the second lady, and the young master know about this?” 
“If I didn’t know, could I give it to you? 
Now, go!” She snapped back at him with sharp curses 
The man hurriedly took the paper and swiftly walked away… 
Ps: Seeking comments, seeking votes, your support is my biggest motivation…
###59: Chapter 59 She Was Never a Good Person to Begin With 
59 -59 She Was Never a Good Person to Begin With 
The rivalry between the second and third branches of the Ou family is widely known, but to go to such lengths, aren’t they afraid of failing miserably, with Ou Mucen’s means, leaving them with nothing but ashes? 
When that person left, even their legs were trembling. 
Ye Ning stood there for a while, then suddenly, in her eyes, a ghostly and sinister smile spread. 
Was she courting death? 
That was perfect, she was worried about not having an opportunity to make her move. 
This way, wasn’t she being handed just what she needed? 
She smiled, with a cryptic grin that no one could understand, and turned back to where she had just come from. noveldrama
Ye Ning had not intended to be a good person since she returned; her purpose here was for revenge. 
Since the opportunity had come, she would definitely seize it. 
As for others, they had no relation to her whatsoever. 
Having returned to the auction, the bidding had already started, so she bent over and went to the table where the man was sitting in the third row, “Third Master, I apologize, I just went to the restroom.” 
She was at least fifteen minutes late, of course, she needed an explanation—this person had warned her before that she must not be late again, or she would no longer be an employee of the Ou family. 
Fortunately, after she explained, the man just turned his head and glared at her unhappily. 
Afterward, he looked impassively back to the front: “I heard that Original Jade Stone was auctioned at ‘Skyline’ before?” 
Original Jade Stone? 
Ye Ning’s fingers gripping the list on the table immediately tensed… 
Of course, there was Original Jade Stone; it came from the Huo Family, the current supplier for Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry. 
He really had come here to investigate, to confirm whether the Huo Family was truly the supplier for Longfeng? 
Ye Ning pressed her lips together, holding the paper for a long time before finally nodding lightly: “Yes, his surname is Huo, but he hasn’t been seen for many years. 
Since he auctioned the last piece of Original Jade Stone here nine years ago, he hasn’t come back. 
No one knows what he’s been up to.” 
“Nine years ago?” 
“Yes, nine years ago. 
I was actually very young back then, and I only know about it from what my master said. 
I’m not very clear on the specifics,” said Ye Ning, deliberately smiling as she spoke, her bright and clear eyes seemingly the epitome of innocence. 
Nine years ago, she was 14, the same year she was adopted by the second branch of the Ou family. 
Who would have thought that time could pass in the blink of an eye…nine years had already gone by… 
At last, Ou Mucen finally turned to look at her, his gaze indifferent but sharp and cold within—like twin beams that could penetrate deep into her heart, just one glance was enough to make one’s insides tremble. 
Ye Ning’s pupils contracted for a moment, but in the end, she lowered her gaze: “Did Third Master come here in search of Original Jade Stone? 
There hasn’t been an auction for a long time. 
If you like, I could ask my master to introduce a few suppliers to you.” 
“Your master?” 
“Yes, Lin Yebai. 
He knows a few jade merchants, and if you’d like, he could invite them to bring some samples for you to look at.” 
“…” 
Once again, silence fell. 
Following her words, the man’s expression of impatience had become very obvious, as if everything she said was pointless. 
Indeed, it was pointless. 
In A City, which jade stone supplier could possibly have more authentic or superior stock than the Huo Family’s?
###60: Chapter 60: Harbouring Ulterior Motives 
60 -60: Harbouring Ulterior Motives 
Ou Mucen’s expression did indeed become rather unsightly, his eyes narrowed slightly. 
He had originally planned to leave, but after glancing at the items on the auction table in front of him, suddenly, his interest was piqued again, “The item on auction above, which one is the best?” 
Ye Ning was startled, “Huh?” 
Ou Mucen looked coldly towards her, “Didn’t you say you are Lin Yebai’s apprentice? 
Then can you tell which one is most valuable?” 
That was easy to answer! 
Ye Ning had no idea what was on the man’s mind. 
Upon hearing his request to pick out the best item from the auction table, she glanced over and pointed to a jade clasp the size of a thumb placed at the very edge, “That one!” 
Ou Mucen frowned slightly, “Are you sure?” 
Ye Ning smiled, “Sure. 
If you don’t believe me, you can look at the auction price later. 
It will definitely be the highest.” 
Ou Mucen fell silent… 
That indeed was the item with the highest starting bid in the entire venue, but the price list had always been in his hands—she had never seen it, yet she had confidently made such a statement. 
It seemed that her ability to appraise and identify treasures was truly not simple. 
Ou Mucen’s face finally softened a bit. 
He stood up from his chair, and without saying another word, turned and left the place. 
Ye Ning sat there watching, dumbfounded. 
What’s going on? 
He’s leaving just like that? 
The auction isn’t over yet; how could he just leave? 
She had been planning to create an opportunity for him to meet Mr. 
Huo. 
How could this man leave so quickly? 
Ye Ning grabbed her bag and chased after him for quite a while, finally catching up to him near the entrance, “Young Master, why did you leave just like that? 
Aren’t you bidding on the items anymore?” 
Ou Mucen ignored her and walked towards the door. 
Seeing his car already parked there, he quickened his steps toward it. 
Ye Ning, watching from behind, was agape… 
Good heavens, when did his car get parked at this entrance? 
Wasn’t it parked by that building earlier? 
Could it be that while they were entering, he’d already had someone bring his car over? 
Damn! 
Awesome! 
“Young Master, are we going back to the company?” 
“No, to Lido. 
Make a phone call to Secretary Gao, tell her the meeting with Mr. 
Huo set for this morning is in half an hour.” 
“Yes, Young Master!” 
The person who got out of the car to open the door for him was not Secretary Gao, but the men in black who looked like those who had appeared at the jewelry store that day. 
Upon hearing the president’s order to go to the Lido Hotel, they immediately came over to open the car door for him. 
Ye Ning stood behind and heard this, slightly taken aback. 
Before long, a radiant smile spread across her pretty face. 
Mr. 
Huo… 
Ou Mucen got into the car, yet he did not notice the triumphant smile of the woman behind him. 
Once seated, he naturally took out his phone and opened the email with the detailed information about the Huo Family sent by Secretary Gao not long before. 
Caught up in thought, the driver who came in hesitated before speaking up, “Young Master, is Miss An also going to Lido with us?” 
Miss An? 
Ou Mucen, reminded by the question, finally remembered there was such a person, and he immediately looked up with a dark expression towards the outside, “What are you still standing there for? 
Don’t you plan to go back?” 
Ye Ning had been lost in thought standing there when she suddenly heard this. 
She quickly responded, “No… 
no, I just saw that you, Young Master, still have things to do. 
I was thinking of taking the bus back myself so as not to hold you up!”noveldrama
###61: Chapter 61 How terrifying can a man with deep schemes be? 
61 -61 How terrifying can a man with deep schemes be? 
Public transit? 
Not a bad idea! 
In a second, the man had rolled the car window back up, “Let’s go…” 
Driver: “…” 
Outside, Ye Ning was staring dumbfounded at the retreating car as it started to drive away. 
Damn it! 
Could he actually just drive off like that after what she said? 
Didn’t he have a shred of conscience? 
On her first day of work, she had accompanied him to this godforsaken place, ugh! 
Who in their right mind would abandon a luxury car to take public transit, jerk!! 
Ye Ning picked up a small stone from the ground and threw it at the car… 
Inside the Bentley, Xiaoliu, the driver gripping the steering wheel, saw this through the rearview mirror and couldn’t help but laugh, “Third Young Master, Miss An doesn’t seem too keen on taking the bus.” 
“Hm?” 
“She’s throwing pebbles at us!” 
“…” 
After a while, the man seated in the back twitched the corner of his eye and continued to look down at the iPad in his hands, “Did you get any news about the movements of the second household that I asked you to watch?” 
Xiaoliu immediately straightened his face, “Yes, this morning, we received news from people over at Blue Mountain Villa that Ou Yuze took Yang Xueshan out, and our people followed them, which led them directly to Yuzhirun.” 
Really Yuzhirun? 
The man looking at the iPad tensed his eyes slightly and a trace of mockery curled up at the corner of his lips, “So it means that they actually gave me a real supply channel this time.” 
The supply channels of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry had been unknown for many years, and precisely for this reason, he had hardly believed that they would actually reveal their supply channels to him since Mei Liping agreed to give him such information yesterday. 
And this was his primary reason for coming to Yuzhirun today! 
Unexpectedly, this time, they played no tricks, which indeed surprised him. 
“So… 
are you planning to use their Original Jade Stones?” 
Xiaoliu was also somewhat astonished and, noticing that the BOSS seated behind him kept his gaze on the tablet without showing much emotion, boldly asked. 
Upon this question, the man leaning back leisurely chuckled, “Why not use them? 
What’s the problem in doing so?” 
Xiaoliu grew worried, “But, their products, who knows if there are any issues with them?” 
The concern was valid, considering that the second branch of the Ou family was notoriously underhanded and deceitful. 
Plus, since the supply channels were handed over involuntarily this time, how could one ensure they weren’t up to no good? 
Moreover, Phoenix Pearl had a less than auspicious opening day yesterday, and further complications would be really troublesome. 
Xiaoliu was genuinely worried… 
But what about the man seated behind? 
His gaze, that is, once he had opened the internal webpage and had seen the design draft for next season’s main featured items, his eyes flitted momentarily, and suddenly, an alarming, heart-stoppingly beautiful curve traced his perfect, thin lips, “You’re not wrong. 
So, here’s what you’ll do, call the marketing department and tell them to add a line for me in the advertisements.” noveldrama
“What line?” 
“Say that this time, the new products for Yuzhirun are all supplied by my brother, Ou Mucen. 
He sympathized with his little brother’s fledgling brand and generously offered me the best supply channels.” 
“…” 
!!! 
How sinister, how frightening! 
It was as if a chilling wind had suddenly surged through the car; Xiaoliu looked down and saw the hairs on his arm stand on end.
###62: Chapter 62 An Ning, Do You Know Royal? 
62 -62 An Ning, Do You Know Royal? 
“When the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind, the second house of the Ou family may have harbored the intention to give away the supply channels, perhaps plotting against Yuzhirun all along. noveldrama
But this way, if they were to make a move, there would be only one path left for them—death!” 
Xiaoliu sat there, swallowing hard several times before he could suppress the chilling fear that crept up from the depths of his heart. 
Indeed, his boss was no longer someone that could be merely described by the word ‘terrifying.’ 
In the future, he must never offend him, absolutely… 
— 
By the time Ye Ning returned to the company, it was almost five o’clock. 
Thinking of Xiaobao at home, she tidied up her desk before preparing to leave work. 
“Xiaochen, if there’s nothing else, then I’ll be heading off.” After arranging everything, she stepped out of her office and out of politeness, specifically addressed the girl at the front desk named Xiaochen. 
Xiaochen was on the phone, seemingly busy with something urgent, and when she heard that Ye Ning was about to leave, she paused for a moment before turning to look at her, “An Ning, do you know Royal?” 
Royal? 
Wasn’t that the biggest nightclub in A City? 
Ye Ning nodded, “I know, what’s up?” 
Xiaochen quickly nodded her head, “There’s a client waiting at Royal for a car, Secretary Gao asked me to deliver one over. 
Could you drop it off on your way? 
I still have a lot of things to take care of here.” 
She lived in the west, and Royal was in the east—how was that on the way? 
However, seeing that Xiaochen was indeed very busy, and considering that today was her first day on the job and the girl had helped her out, Ye Ning ultimately nodded and agreed, taking the car keys and heading downstairs. 
Ou Group had many clients, and after arriving in A City, it was common for the company to provide cars for temporary use, if needed. 
Thus having retrieved the car keys, Ye Ning didn’t think much of it and went down to the parking lot. 
After retrieving the blue Chevrolet, she drove towards Royal. 
Xiaobao’s kindergarten usually finished at five, and she had asked the landlady to pick him up yesterday, so after delivering the car there, she would catch a bus back, hoping to see the little guy by around six-thirty. 
Thinking of that little bundle, a smile finally broke through the weariness on her face. 
Half an hour later, in the east of the city—Royal— 
This was the most luxurious leisure club in A City. 
It was said to be owned by a person with very strong connections. 
The facilities and services were top-notch. 
Because of this, at Ou Group, this was generally the appointed place for entertaining guests. 
Ye Ning arrived at the club, parked the car, and walked over with the car keys, “Excuse me, is there a Mr. 
Gao in room 202?” 
Mr. 
Gao? 
The two security guards at the door heard the room number and glanced at each other, “Are you talking about Mr. 
Gao from Ou Group?” 
Ye Ning quickly nodded, “Yes, that’s him. 
Is he here?” 
Since Secretary Gao often brought clients here, it was normal for these people to recognize him. 
However, to Ye Ning’s surprise, they told her that Secretary Gao hadn’t come and had only reserved a room. 
The person currently in the room was a Mr. 
Hu. 
A Mr. 
Hu? 
Had Secretary Gao not accompanied the client this time and simply let him have fun on his own?
###63: Chapter 63 Today’s arrangement by Ouyi was very good! 
63 -63 Today’s arrangement by Ouyi was very good! 
Ye Ning’s eyebrows knitted slightly! 
She didn’t like places like this, where the crowd was a mixed bag, illuminated by red lights and green wines, exuding an atmosphere of disarray. 
It was not suitable for someone like her to be here. 
However, if she didn’t deliver the car keys, she would fail to carry out Xiaochen’s orders. 
She might anger Xiaochen, and offending her on her very first day at work wouldn’t be wise. 
Ye Ning stood there pondering for a while, and ultimately, she took the car keys and went inside. 
Room 202… 
Upon entering, she smelled the strong scent of alcohol in the air and heard all sorts of deafening noises. 
She felt uncomfortable deep down, but managed to pass through the lobby to the VIP corridor. 
She quickly started searching room by room. 
Luckily, room 202 wasn’t hard to find—it was the second room inside the corridor. 
Seeing this, she took a deep breath, grabbed the doorknob, and then pushed open the frosted glass door… 
“Mr. 
Hu…” 
“Come on, Mr. 
Hu, let’s have another drink. 
Look, I’ve stripped down to just this.” 
“So if I finish this drink, you’ll take off everything?” 
“Sure, I’ll strip as long as Mr. 
Hu likes…” 
“…” 
Ye Ning never expected to walk into such an explosive scene when she pushed the door open! 
In the room filled with thick smoke and alcohol, a man was surrounded by four or five scantily clad women on a dark red sofa. 
The music was so loud it could almost deafen a person. 
What kind of people are these?!! 
Ye Ning felt nauseous. 
Seeing that nobody reacted to her entrance, she reluctantly knocked on the door with force and called out, “Mr. 
Hu—” 
Mr. noveldrama
Hu? 
The crisp voice that came in at the doorway, clear like a spring, finally reached the man who was enjoying himself with those women. 
He pushed aside the woman in front of him and looked towards the door. 
Wow, this one is different! 
The man looked at the woman standing by the door—a white casual blouse on top, paired with a particularly elegant and light grey skirt underneath, her skin was pale white, a delicate face devoid of makeup. 
Standing there, she seemed like a university student who had just stepped out of campus, radiating an innocent charm and cleanliness. 
His eyes instantly lit up. 
“Nice, I like this one,” he said, wobbling towards Ye Ning with his glass in hand. 
Seeing him come closer, Ye Ning’s expression changed slightly. 
She reached into her bag, took out the set of car keys and quickly extended them to him, “Mr. 
Hu, I am an employee of the Ou Group. 
I’m here to deliver your car.” 
The Ou Group? 
The man, who had already consumed a fair amount of alcohol, paused at the mention of that name… 
The Ou Group, right, he had come here to do business with the Ou Group, and the evening’s arrangements were made by them. 
So, did that mean this woman was specially sent by Secretary Gao of the Ou Group? 
Remembering the knowing smile of the Ou Group president’s secretary who had brought him here tonight, he finally smiled contentedly…
###64: Chapter 64: Where Did An Ning Go? 
64 -64: Where Did An Ning Go? 
“Ou family’s? 
Good, very good. 
I like this arrangement. noveldrama
Rest assured, as long as you make me comfortable tonight, I will give you the Ou family’s order tomorrow, and I will not short you even a single penny.” 
After saying that, the man looked at the delicate white hand being offered, let out a lecherous laugh, and suddenly, with a yank, he pulled Ye Ning, who was standing in front of him, towards him. 
“What are you doing? 
I’m not from here, stop messing around!” Ye Ning panicked upon seeing this, forcefully pushed his hand away, and started to struggle violently. 
But she was just a woman, how could she break free from a man so much larger and stronger than her? 
Suffering intense pain in her wrists, the brute grabbed her and dragged her inside, then viciously pushed her onto a dark red sofa, “Good, I like this fiery spirit, hahahaha…” 
“What are you trying to do? 
You beast, let go of me, somebody help!” 
“Why are you calling for help? 
Don’t pretend to be innocent with me here. 
Didn’t the Ou family send you here to accompany me today?” he barked with a ferocious laugh, then grabbed the collar of her dress and tore it with a few “rip” sounds, popping all the buttons off. 
Upon seeing this, Ye Ning began to tremble all over. 
The fear, along with the revolting scent wafting over her, brought back the horrors of the past five years, those nightmarish five years! 
“Beast!!” 
A flash of blood-red fury in her eyes, she suddenly raised her knee and fiercely kicked at the man’s crotch! 
“Ah——” 
Immediately after, following this kick, a pig-like scream echoed in the private room, and the man fell off of Ye Ning, clutching at his groin. 
This animal! 
Witnessing this, the still shocked Ye Ning finally heaved a sigh of relief. 
Trembling, she got up from the sofa, grabbed her torn garment, and staggered, ready to flee from this hellish place. 
She was also very frightened; she had never encountered such a situation before, and even with her strong mental fortitude, she felt panicked and scared after such an experience. 
But just when she thought she was going to escape, the man recovered from the intense pain and, upon seeing her trying to run away, angrily grabbed something from the ground and hurled it at her. 
Thud—— 
In an instant, Ye Ning felt a severe pain in her back, her legs gave way, and she collapsed forward once more! 
“Bitch, you dare to run?” 
“…” 
Her vision becoming blurry, Ye Ning lay there, hearing only the buzzing in her head and the faintly audible sinister laughter… 
—— 
Around six o’clock, Secretary Gao finally picked up the president from the Lido Hotel. 
Once in the car, he asked habitually, “Third Young Master, are we heading to Yuhu Apartment or Blue Mountain Villa?” 
Yuhu Apartment was his private residence, while Blue Mountain Villa was associated with the grand Ou family. 
Ou Mucen pinched the brow that was starting to throb, and after a while, he replied indifferently, “Yuhu, I guess. 
The old man should have no issues today.” 
Secretary Gao chuckled, “That’s for sure. 
Since even you let the second branch off the hook, the old man certainly doesn’t want to get worked up again. 
But about the meeting with Mr. 
Huo today, does the Third Young Master think there’s a problem with him?” 
A problem, huh? 
Ou Mucen glanced at the jade sample he had brought back, and suddenly, a hint of a smile formed on his handsome, thin lips, “Tell An Ning to come to the company earlier tomorrow.”
###65: Chapter 65: Who told you to do this?!! 
65 -65: Who told you to do this?!! 
An Ning? 
Secretary Gao heard the name and nodded, “Okay, I’ll call her later. 
Oh, Hu Xiong from Yuandong Company is here. 
He said he just auctioned a piece of land and wants our Ou Group to take on the construction.” 
Yuandong Company? 
The man sitting behind recalled the plump and leering lech; a hint of disgust flashed in his eyes, “Where did he manage to get the land from this time? 
Is the price high?” 
“I’ve taken a look, and it’s quite good. 
Plus, it’s not far from A City. 
It’s a profit not to be missed.” 
“Hmm, you handle it. 
He has that taste, and you know it better than I do.” After saying this, the man lowered his head to start dealing with a day’s worth of backlog in his notebook. 
He had been busy all day, and his email inbox was already full of emails needing attention. 
If he didn’t catch up now, who knew how late he would be working. 
Seeing he was getting busy, Secretary Gao didn’t disturb him any further… 
Of course, he knew of Hu Xiong, a man of debauchery by nature, with exceptionally heavy taste. 
The moment he arrived, Secretary Gao had sent him off to the city’s largest and most luxurious Royal Leisure Club. 
He believed the services there would surely satisfy him. 
Right, the car! 
He suddenly remembered, and naturally called Xiaochen, “Xiaochen, the car I asked you to send to Royal, have you sent it yet?” 
“Sent it, I had An Ning deliver it. 
She should be there by now, right?” 
An Ning? 
Secretary Gao was taken aback upon hearing this, “Why did you let An Ning deliver it? 
She’s new, does she know the place?” 
Xiaochen was quite calm, “I asked her, and she said she knew, so I let her deliver it. 
Besides…” 
“What’s the matter?” 
Xiaochen didn’t finish speaking on the phone when a voice, sounding rather displeased, came through from behind. 
On hearing this, Xiaochen quickly hung up the phone and turned around, “That Hu Xiong asked for the car; I was on my way to pick you up at the time, so I had Xiaochen arrange it. 
But she just told me that she sent An Ning.” 
“An Ning?” As soon as these words came out, Ou Mucen, who was busy on his laptop, stopped moving his fingers. 
An Ning? 
Why would they arrange for her to go? 
He remembered the woman who had followed him all morning, and that vile creature from Yuandong who couldn’t take his eyes off any woman. 
Suddenly, his heart skipped a beat, “Who told you to make such arrangements? 
Turn around, to Royal!” 
The voice was extremely stern; within a second, the atmosphere in the car dropped to freezing point! 
Cold sweat broke out on Xiaochen immediately… 
Truthfully, he also had a foreboding feeling. noveldrama
Miss An wasn’t the kind of beauty that stood out at a glance, but her natural elegance without makeup, and her unpretentious demeanor, were absolutely a refreshing change from the vulgar bombast that frequented the Royal. 
So, when Xiaochen explained the details to her, he already had a bad feeling about it. 
God, please let nothing happen! 
The car sped along the road, accelerating to 160 km/h towards the East District. 
Ten minutes later, at the Royal Leisure Club— 
The security guards at the entrance saw the black Bentley with the license plate of five “9”s darting towards them and immediately came to greet them, “Mr. 
Gao…” 
Those cars, anyone here knew them; they belonged to Ou Group. 
Even if it wasn’t always the president himself who used them, they were certainly driven by his secretary. 
Thus, seeing it, they came over immediately…
###66: Chapter 66 This beast! 
66 -66 This beast! 
But what they hadn’t expected was that the person who quickly stepped out of that car was actually a tall and straight figure radiating a cold and arrogant nobility. 
As soon as this figure alighted, he merely glanced over in their direction and immediately, the security guards felt as if a basin of cold water had been poured over them, sending a chill down their spines. 
My God! 
It’s the third young master of the Ou Family! 
Why has he come? 
He doesn’t usually like to visit places like this, does he? 
Seeing the terrifying coldness on the man’s face, they all shivered and hurried over, “Third young master, you’ve come? 
What brings you to our humble establishment today? 
Please, come inside!” 
The severity of the Ou Family’s third young master was notorious; offending him meant you wouldn’t even know how you’d die. 
But even though they were so respectful, he didn’t so much as glance at them and, after narrowing his eyes slightly at the bustling, neon-lit establishment, he strode forward. 
“Third young master…” 
“Where is room 202?” 
“It’s… 
this way…” The security guard suddenly had a very bad feeling. 
Room 202, wasn’t that the room previously reserved by the Ou family? 
Ever since that Mr. 
Hu arrived, they had sent their best girls over to him, but why had the third young master come so imposingly? 
What could have happened? 
Could it be… 
something went wrong inside? 
That’s right, the woman who went in not long ago, she hasn’t come out yet, has she? 
The security guard began to sweat profusely, rushing over and as they approached the corridor of room 202, even though they hadn’t entered yet, they could already faintly hear various screams from inside. 
There were the sinister laughs of men and the sharp, encourging shouts from women, “Strip her, strip her bare, Hu boss, she’s all yours. 
“Right, we’ve never seen this face here before, she might be fresh meat.” 
“Hahahaha… 
so exciting, Hu boss, hurry, I just want to see you take her publicly.” 
Hiss— 
Because the door wasn’t very tightly shut, they could hear everything from outside the doorway, loud and clear. 
Secretary Gao was the first to go pale, and seeing the man in front of them nearly turn the air solid with his lethal aura, he shivered and suddenly sprinted forward, kicking the door open before him, “Hu Xiong, stop your fucking nonsense!!” 
With a loud noise, at last, the commotion inside the private room came to a halt. 
But it was precisely this pause that allowed them to witness the most unsightly and least desired scene… 
They saw that the private room was in complete disarray, with everything from the two coffee tables smashed to pieces on the floor, and there were even traces of blood, indicating a recent violent struggle. 
And among these scattered items, they noticed a white shirt ripped in half and thrown aside, stained with blood, and its owner was currently being pinned down by a repulsive beast on a dark red sofa. noveldrama
Aside from her gray skirt, which he had already torn halfway off, the rest of her was obscured beneath his corpulent body. 
Of course, there was also a slender arm, flailing in vain from the outside.
###67: Chapter 67: Drag him out and finish him off! 
67 -67: Drag him out and finish him off! 
This beast!! 
Secretary Gao almost ordered the security to act immediately, but just at that moment, a shadow passed by him. 
Afterwards, everyone watched in fear as he stood, expressionless, in front of that ugly man and suddenly grabbed a chair from beside the coffee table and smashed it down on his head with great force! 
“Third Young Master…” 
Crack!! 
After uttering just that, the man’s head, like a watermelon, burst with blood-red liquid spurting out instantly, and the man rolled off the woman. 
That was an astoundingly ruthless act, as if the head wasn’t a head at all, merely a thing, and what he needed to do at that moment was to smash that thing into pieces and rescue the woman underneath it. 
This was too terrifying! 
In the private room, everyone was stunned, including Secretary Gao who was so shocked he had forgotten what he was supposed to do. 
My God, that’s a human being. 
Could such smashing kill him? 
But the reality was, he didn’t treat the head as anything of consequence. 
After the chair came crashing down, he saw the beast finally roll away, threw the chair aside, and, stepping over the blood on the floor, came to the front of the sofa, “An Ning?” 
“…” 
No one responded to him. 
The woman, after such a huge scare, lay there without even the most basic reaction. 
Her clothes were torn, revealing wounds on her snow-white skin, her hair was a mess, her mouth was swollen, and her eyes, like a deer completely petrified with fear, trembled incessantly! 
This beast! noveldrama
Ou Mucen stood there, recalling how that morning she had kept singing out of tune with him, irritating him, and those eyes which seemed to have been indifferent and calm from the moment she saw him, stirring no waves no matter how he probed. 
This woman was supposed to be very meticulous and strong-willed, yet now she was tormented to the point where she couldn’t even focus! 
Ou Mucen’s pupils contracted fiercely, and the next second, he enunciated, “Drag him out, finish him!” 
Ah! 
Finish him!! 
Hu Xiong, clutching his gushing head, was wailing in pain when he suddenly heard this. 
He forgot about the injury to his head and crawled over like a dog, “Third Young Master, spare my life, please, I truly didn’t know she was your woman, Third Young Master…” 
His woman? 
That was better left unsaid. 
The man already bent over surged with even more murderous intent in his eyes. 
He took off his suit jacket to cover her, then turned and viciously kicked the man lying behind him. 
“What are you waiting for?!” 
“Yes, Third Young Master!” 
The two security guards at the door finally came to their senses. 
Upon hearing the order, they immediately rushed over to drag the man, who was wailing like a pig, out of the room. 
In Royal, it was too common for someone to die, regardless of their status. 
As long as he wanted someone dead, they would surely carry it out cleanly. 
Once Hu Xiong was dragged away, the room quieted down. 
Secretary Gao, pale-faced, came over immediately, “Third Young Master, this is all my fault, I didn’t arrange things properly. 
When I get back, whatever punishment you give me, I’ll accept. 
But for now, let’s take her to the hospital, shall we?”
###68: Chapter 68: He Saved Her, Yet She Slapped Him in Return! 
68 -68: He Saved Her, Yet She Slapped Him in Return! noveldrama
It was at this moment that the man standing in the private room’s killing aura slightly lessened. 
Upon glancing at the woman still lying on the sofa and seeing that, at the last moment, other than her shirt being torn, there were no further severe injuries, his heart also relaxed a bit, and he bent down to prepare to carry her out. 
In fact, in Ou Mucen’s dictionary, there were no words such as “concern” or “sympathy.” Growing up pampered and privileged, this young master of the Ou Family had long since developed an attitude that overlooked everyone else. 
Indifference and cold detachment were his true nature. 
But now, for some reason? 
After witnessing this scene, not only had he taken the life of that man on the spot, but he also seemed to care whether she was violated or not. 
Could it be… because she was still useful to him? 
The man furrowed his brow, leaned over to pick her up, and prepared to take her out. 
But just at that moment, the woman’s eyes suddenly fluttered, as if something had snapped back into her body, and her gaze fell upon his face: “Ou Mucen—” 
Hmm? 
Ou Mucen had never before heard anyone call him by his full name with such a tone. 
Hearing it now, his steps unconsciously halted, “What…?” 
Before he could finish speaking, suddenly, a sharp “slap—” rang out, and his face was struck to one side, caught completely off guard. 
My heavens! 
Was she… was she slapping the Third Young Master’s face? 
Just then, Secretary Gao had driven the car around and, after waiting for a long time without seeing the two come out, came back to check, only to witness such a shocking scene. 
She must be insane, truly insane – does she realize what she’s doing? 
Secretary Gao’s entire complexion changed, and seeing his BOSS smacked, his handsome face darkened as if a violent storm had burst forth in an instant. 
Immediately, he rushed over and grabbed the woman down: “An Ning, what are you doing? 
Do you know who just saved you?” 
Ye Ning staggered several steps when pulled, but the eyes of her newly awakened self were still full of furious, blood-red rage: “Then why don’t you ask him? 
Who caused me to encounter all this?” 
“I…” 
“If it wasn’t for him, for your Ou Family, would I have encountered this today? 
There’s not a single good person among the Ou Family members!!” Ye Ning finally awakened, her sudden lucidity matched only by a raging fury that stripped away even the most basic calm. 
One couldn’t blame her; the incident that had just transpired nearly crushed her! 
She was already battered and worn, struggling just to get on her feet, to find the courage and hope to carry on. 
But if such an event happened again, the devastation would be too great for her to bear. 
What would she do then? 
What about her child? 
Thus, truly, there was not a single good person in the Ou Family! 
Her words shocked Secretary Gao to the core. 
His face turned deathly pale, and he tremulously glanced at his BOSS opposite him, whose expression was so terrifying it could have killed a man. 
Hurriedly, he grabbed the woman’s arm: “You’re truly insane. 
The Third Young Master saved you, and even if you don’t know how to be grateful, you still hit him. 
Alright, now get out of here!” 
He said, while forcefully dragging her out.
###69: Chapter 69 You’re the First Person to Dare Slap Me in the Face! 
69 -69 You’re the First Person to Dare Slap Me in the Face! 
Ye Ning, already injured, found herself nearly losing balance when he dragged her, “Let go of me, I don’t need your help, all of you are up to no good, do you think I want to stay here?” 
“…” 
Her attitude was incredibly harsh, showing absolutely no sign of reflection. 
Secretary Gao was furious, ready to throw her out on the spot, but just then, the man who had been standing there with a stern face and had not spoken suddenly waved his hand, signaling him to stop. 
“Third Young Master…” 
“Get out!” 
With these succinct two words, carrying the man’s immense danger and overwhelming presence, the commotion by the door of the private room immediately ceased. 
Seeing this, Secretary Gao shivered and, not daring to say another word, turned and left first… 
Such a terrifying expression from the BOSS was rare even for him, and to think she dared to slap their CEO, ha, she truly has a death wish. 
Just wait, she won’t end well. 
As Secretary Gao left, he was filled with schadenfreude. 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, after he left, felt a chill in her heart when she saw the man with the frozen face walking towards her step by step, and with a “thud,” she backed up against the door panel behind her. 
It was a terrifying sight. 
She hadn’t felt it while they were fighting, but now, as the surroundings fell silent, she realized that he didn’t even have to say a word; the immense danger surrounding her was suffocating. 
Yes, he was the second-generation heir of the Ou Family, someone who wouldn’t blink an eye at taking a life, and yet, she had just slapped him. 
Ye Ning’s fingers slowly clenched… 
“You are the first person who dares to slap me!” The first thing he said as he approached was this. 
Ye Ning felt her breath tighten and, instinctively, she shrank back further. 
But there was only the door panel behind her, she had nowhere left to retreat, and so after a hard shiver, those wide eyes stared at him with both vigilance and panic, like prey firmly caught in a wolf’s gaze. 
Fortunately, when he saw that she had no way to back off, he stopped walking forward, but his staring gaze became even more terrifying, high and cold with a deadly seriousness, as if the next moment, he might snap her neck. 
This man, too frightening! 
“Do you know the consequences of offending me, Ou Mucen?” 
“…” 
Ye Ning stared at him, and after what felt like an eternity, she finally managed to squeeze out a sentence from her voiceless throat, “But… 
are you not at fault? 
If it weren’t for the Ou Corporation today, I wouldn’t have encountered this, and if… 
if something really happened to me, what then?” 
The last sentence was uttered with a tone of grievance! 
Yes, today’s incident wouldn’t have happened if not for the Ou Corporation arranging for her to this wretched place to deliver car keys. 
Wasn’t it his responsibility? 
Ye Ning’s nose started to sour, and at the same time, those eyes staring at him began to turn red… noveldrama
Half of it was from being wronged, and the other half from fear! 
Ou Mucen kept watching her coldly with an impassive expression and an especially stiff and stern posture. 
However, when he saw her eyes, right after she spoke those words, he quickly turned his head and something seemed to stir behind her lowered eyelids, and his eyes narrowed slightly…
###70: Chapter 70: You’re too stupid! 
70 -70: You’re too stupid! 
“Regarding today’s incident, the company indeed made improper arrangements, which caused you harm. 
The company will compensate you, but…” 
But… 
Ye Ning’s heart suddenly felt tightly gripped! 
But what? 
But she had hit him…? 
Ye Ning’s eyes immediately turned back towards him… 
Still, he towered over her with the posture of an absolute ruler, watching her. 
Probably because of the slap, his complexion was really ugly. 
Even after she had spoken, his overwhelming presence and the breath so cold it seemed to make breathing difficult, continued to give her the chills. 
So, what exactly did he want? 
“…If you had half a brain, things wouldn’t have turned out like this!” 
“What?” 
“Isn’t that so? 
The company hired you to deliver a car, not to accompany him. 
What are you doing in here? 
Such a big nightclub, with so many security guards at the door, are you so stupid that you don’t even know how to find someone to bring the keys in?” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
Suddenly, she felt a bit dazed. 
Her mind, as she looked at the still grim-faced man before her, went blank. 
So, what he meant now was, he wasn’t dwelling on the slap from before, but berating her for being too stupid? 
Stupid enough to deliver the car keys herself and walk straight into the wolf’s den? 
Ye Ning’s mouth opened slightly… 
Ou Mucen’s expression was still very grim, but seeing the woman standing in front of him silenced by his scolding, the tense lines of his face finally relaxed a little. 
This foolish woman! 
She had no sense and still had the audacity to blame others? noveldrama
His gaze sharply swept over her small and thin figure, looking mismatched in his suit, then he turned and walked away. 
Ye Ning stood there dazedly for a long while, feeling the emptiness around her before she came to her senses. 
Then she tightly clutched the suit she wore and followed out. 
“Young Master…” 
“Take her to the hospital for treatment, and buy her two sets of clothes, send her home.” With a few simple sentences, the man who finally came out saw Secretary Gao waiting there and opened the door to the driver’s seat of the black Bentley beside him. 
Secretary Gao was startled, “Then what about you, young master?” 
Ou Mucen looked up coldly from the car: “What do you think?” 
“…” 
After a while, Secretary Gao shivered violently and obsequiously bowed in front of him: “Don’t worry, young master. 
I will handle this properly, take care…” 
… 
No one responded to him anymore. 
All that was left for him was the retreating sound of the car’s exhaust… 
Secretary Gao wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and finally, as the Bentley disappeared from his view, he turned around and looked towards the entrance of the nightclub, waiting for the other woman to come out. 
That detestable woman! 
Fortunately, he didn’t have to wait long. 
The woman who had just made a scene like a lunatic in the private room came out, wearing the man’s oversized suit. 
When she saw him at the door, she paused. 
Secretary Gao? 
“What are you still standing there for? 
Hurry up and come here!” Secretary Gao also saw her, and seeing that she wasn’t moving, he immediately urged her impatiently. 
Ye Ning frowned and scanned her surroundings. 
Noticing that the man who had left before her was no longer there, she then set her gaze on him: “Come over for what?”
###71: Chapter 71 Why Doesn’t This Woman Know What’s Good for Her? 
71 -71 Why Doesn’t This Woman Know What’s Good for Her? 
“Where else could I go? 
I’m taking you to the hospital, madam. 
Could you please hurry up? 
I need to get off work too,” 
Secretary Gao was not in a good mood, because every time he thought of this woman, how the young master had saved her, only for her to slap him in return, his impression of her had never been good since; at this moment, he just wanted to be done with the matter. 
However, what made him even angrier was that this woman seemed ungrateful. 
Upon hearing his offer to take her to the hospital, she immediately refused, “No need, it’s just a superficial wound, it’s not that much of a hassle.” 
After saying that, she passed by him and went to the side of the road to hail a taxi. 
It was already past six o’clock, nearly seven, and she really needed to hurry back. 
Otherwise, Xiaobao would be extremely anxious not seeing her come home this late. 
Thinking of the little figure waiting at home for her return, Ye Ning’s heart was filled with restlessness and frustration. 
Secretary Gao’s mouth fell open, but not because of anxiety; rather, he was stunned that this woman had actually refused him!! 
Damn! 
What was going on? 
Has this woman lost her mind? 
Refusing to let him take her to the hospital? 
Was she out of her mind? 
Finding it hard to hold back, Secretary Gao walked over and blurted out, “Miss An, what do you mean by this? 
I’m offering to take you to the hospital for a checkup and you refuse. 
What do you want?” 
Ye Ning turned her head and glanced at him indifferently, “What do I want? 
Didn’t I tell you? noveldrama
I’m fine, I can handle this on my own.” 
“But you have so many injuries, and your clothes…” 
“Secretary Gao, I need to go home now. 
My child is waiting for me, do you understand?” Ye Ning also became somewhat angry, her voice rising sharply with the words. 
That’s right, she wasn’t concerned about her injuries, but about her child at home. 
Did he not understand that? 
As her words fell, the man finally stopped making a fuss… 
A child? 
That’s right, he had almost forgotten she had a child. 
It was said her husband had died, and she was raising the child alone. 
So, her rush to get back home made sense. 
Secretary Gao finally fell silent, while his eyes lingered on the woman standing at the roadside continually flagging down taxis, caught in a dilemma. 
Forget it, after all, she was just a woman, and moreover, a single mother. 
Today’s incident wasn’t really her fault; if someone was to blame, it was Xiaochen for not making proper arrangements. 
For a woman to raise a child alone was already quite difficult. 
With this in mind, Secretary Gao’s tone softened considerably, “Fine, since it’s like this, then I’ll just take you home first.” 
“No, I don’t need you to take me!” Unexpectedly, the woman flatly refused him again, and this time, her refusal was even more decisive and swift than when she had refused his offer to take her to the hospital. 
Secretary Gao was dumbfounded once more, “An Ning, don’t be ungrateful. 
I’m doing this for your own good. 
It’s dangerous for a woman to be dressed like this and out so late at night. 
Do you have any idea how risky this is? 
This isn’t some remote place; this is a big city where anything could happen. 
If not for your own sake, you should at least consider your child.” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
He was right. 
At this time of night, for her as a woman to dress like this and be hailing cars here, it was indeed very dangerous. 
More importantly, if she went home like this, Xiaobao would certainly be very worried as well.
###72: Chapter 72 Xiaobao’s mom, you have guests at home… 
72 -72 Xiaobao’s mom, you have guests at home… 
Ye Ning eventually agreed to Secretary Gao’s proposal and got into his car. 
Actually, her previous refusal was not for any other reason but because she had too many secrets. 
She didn’t want anyone to know, nor could anyone find out. 
That’s why she resisted Secretary Gao’s offer to drive her home, to learn where she lived and understand her surroundings. 
But later, after he said what he did, her concern for the child ultimately prevailed, and she got into his car. 
It was just a rented place, so probably nothing much could be discovered. 
After they both got into the car, Secretary Gao first stopped at a mall for her to buy a new set of clothes to change into, while he went to a nearby pharmacy to buy some medicine. 
Then they drove off towards the suburban area Ye Ning had mentioned. 
“Why do you live so far away? 
That’s the suburbs.” Once in the car, upon hearing the place she named, Secretary Gao showed a very surprised expression, just as she had expected. 
Ye Ning turned to look out the window and said the words she had prepared in advance, “I have no choice. 
The rent is cheaper in the suburbs, and I’m currently raising a child on my own. 
The pressure is immense.” 
Secretary Gao frowned but remained silent… 
Indeed, it was a problem. 
For a woman without a husband, raising a child was truly difficult. 
Any initial dissatisfaction in Secretary Gao’s heart had completely disappeared, and he didn’t say anything more. 
He just floored the gas pedal and sped toward the remote suburban area, all to get her home quicker and to see that child. 
That child, chubby and pink, he actually liked him quite a bit. 
Twenty minutes later, Ye Ning saw the outline of the village from the car window and immediately pointed to an intersection ahead, “Okay, you can drop me off here.” 
Secretary Gao took a careful look: “There? 
It’s so dark. 
I’ll drive you further in.” 
“No need. 
This is a village. 
The roads inside are very narrow, and your car simply can’t fit. 
It’s fine, once I get here, a five-minute walk is all it takes to reach home.” 
“Really?” 
“Really!” Ye Ning sensed his concern and felt a bit guilty, so her tone became much softer. 
Seeing this, Secretary Gao had no choice but to stop the car there. 
However, upon noticing that the road had not a single streetlight, he turned on the car’s headlights to light up the slender figure as she walked down the alley. 
Only after she was out of sight, did he turn off the lights and drove away. 
Living so far away, and in such cramped conditions, should he apply to Third Young Master for her? 
Maybe get her a single occupancy dorm? 
At least that would be safer! 
As Secretary Gao drove back, this thought suddenly popped into his head… 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning had come out of that alley shortly after he left, and turned around to walk toward the main road where the car had been parked. 
The place she lived was actually just a little away from this road. 
She had said what she did deliberately to prevent him from finding out. 
However, when she groped her way in the dark to the residential building where she lived, she found a white sedan parked on the open ground in front of the building. 
On closer inspection, she discovered it was an Audi with the license plate “ZS799.” 
An Audi? 
“Xiaobao’s mom, you’re finally back? 
You have a visitor at your home today.” As she looked, the coarse voice of the landlady suddenly came from behind her. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning turned around to ask, “Really? noveldrama
Where is he now?”
###73: Chapter 73: Is He Xiaobao’s Dad? 
73 -73: Is He Xiaobao’s Dad? 
The auntie looked at her with a beaming smile, “Of course, I’m going to your place. 
Today, Xiaobao was picked up by him. 
He was so happy… 
Oh, right, Xiaobao’s mom, that gentleman couldn’t possibly be Xiaobao’s dad, could he?” 
“No, no, Auntie, don’t misunderstand, that’s just Xiaobao’s uncle, he just lives nearby.” Ye Ning quickly interrupted her, with an expression as awkward as it could possibly be. 
How could he possibly be Xiaobao’s dad? noveldrama
Although she didn’t know who Xiaobao’s dad was, it definitely couldn’t be him. 
Upon hearing it wasn’t so, the landlord seemed a bit deflated… 
Such a handsome and dashing young man, and he isn’t Xiaobao’s dad? 
That’s really too bad. 
Ye Ning gave an awkward smile, not daring to say much more. 
After expressing her thanks, she hurriedly went upstairs, heading toward her fourth-floor apartment. 
When she reached the fourth floor, sure enough, the usually quiet room was not only emitting the sound of a television but also, faintly, the sizzle of cooking came through. 
Accompanied by such sounds, from inside the corridor, which wasn’t very good at soundproofing, an enticing aroma wafted out, hitting the nostrils of the hungry Ye Ning, who really couldn’t help swallowing hard. 
It seemed, he had indeed come! 
Ye Ning’s lips carried a trace of a smile as she took out her keys and opened the door, “Xiaobao, mommy is back!” 
“Mommy, you’re finally back? 
Uncle Lin has been waiting for you for a long time.” 
As the door opened, the narrow living room indeed contained Little Baozi, still dressed in kindergarten uniform, sitting on the sofa watching TV. 
Seeing his mom return, he immediately leapt down from the sofa, with his little arms and legs, and threw himself into his mom’s embrace. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning’s heart softened instantly. 
She bent down and picked up the small bundle in her arms, “Is that so? 
Mommy came back a bit late today. 
I’m sorry I didn’t come to pick you up.” 
Ye Xiaobao hugged his mom’s neck, his bright and dark eyes clear and shining like stars in the sky, “It’s okay, mommy. 
Working is very hard, and today Uncle Lin picked me up. 
He even took me to the supermarket.” 
“Really? 
Then it seems Xiaobao is very happy today.” Ye Ning looked at her son’s face, glowing with excitement, and knew that he was in a very good mood today. 
Uncle Lin, of course, he would be happy to see him—he was someone who even indulged him more than she did. 
Since Xiaobao was small, he rarely ever refused him. 
How could he not be happy with such a person? 
While the mother and son were chatting in the living room, the kitchen’s sliding door was suddenly pulled open. 
Ye Ning, holding her son, looked over to see a tall man, wearing a light gray crew neck sweater and scholarly gold-rimmed glasses, holding a dish as he came out, “You’re back? 
Just in time, we can have dinner now.” 
The voice was calm, but the cultured and gentle tone immediately brought a spring-like warmth to the living room. 
Seeing him, Ye Ning quickly let go of her child and stood up, “Yebai, how can I possibly trouble you to cook?” 
Lin Yebai smiled, “I have to eat anyway, might as well do it together.” Having said that, he went back into the kitchen to bring out more dishes. 
Seeing that, Ye Ning quickly put down her bag and followed him to help… 
Yebai’s cooking skills were actually very good, something Ye Ning knew from the time she lived with him.
###74: Chapter 74 What’s wrong with your mouth? 
74 -74 What’s wrong with your mouth? 
So, there wasn’t much surprise to see him cooking at her place at this time, just a bit of embarrassment for having him come all this way and having to lift a finger himself. 
The dishes were served, and Ye Xiaobao had already obediently washed his little hands and was sitting at the table waiting. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning couldn’t help but smile, “He has never been this well-behaved during meals before, it seems he really misses the food you make.” 
“Is that so? 
Then move back in and continue living with me!” 
“…” 
It was said casually and without much thought. 
After that, there was a second of pause at the dinner table! 
Move back in with him? noveldrama
How could that be possible? 
In the past five years, she had troubled him too much because of this child. 
Now that she had finally moved out, how could she go back and disturb him again? 
Ye Ning avoided his direct gaze and ladled a bowl of soup for him, “You’ll get used to it eventually. 
When he’s a bit older, it’ll get easier. 
By the way, Lin Big Brother, what brought you here today?” 
Lin Yebai saw her divert her gaze, his own pausing slightly before shifting elsewhere. 
His expression remained light and indifferent. 
But now, as she avoided him, her beautiful and fair face bowed down, a trace of exhaustion seemed to seep through, and her lips, for some reason, appeared to be bruised and swollen. 
What happened? 
Could something have gone wrong on her first day at work? 
Thinking of the man known for being cold-blooded and ruthless, his fingers holding the chopsticks turned bluish: “What happened to your mouth?” 
Ye Ning was startled and immediately touched the injured area, “It’s nothing. 
I was moving something today and accidentally hit myself.” 
“You just happened to hit your mouth?” 
“Yes, because… it was a cup!” Ye Ning’s excuse wasn’t well thought out, mainly because she had never expected him to come over suddenly. 
After the excuse, silence fell over the dinner table for a while. 
Ye Xiaobao, seeing the two suddenly silent, blinked his grape-like eyes: “Mom, you’re lying, right? 
You obviously bumped yourself, you got hurt like this before!” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
Suddenly, she feigned an awkward expression and looked towards the man beside her: “Lin Big Brother, you… 
don’t listen to him, he’s talking nonsense.” 
Lin Yebai quietly looked at her, not saying a word… 
As for how it happened, he didn’t need her to explain anything; he could already see for himself. 
Because he himself had once caused someone to look like that, even more severely than her. 
However, since she didn’t want to talk about it, he would let her be. 
It looked like he would have to investigate what was going on… 
“Be more careful at work in the future. 
I came today because I heard from Xiaoyu yesterday that you were hired by the Ou Family, so I came to check on you. 
How was it? 
How did you feel about working there today?” 
Working? 
Ye Ning didn’t notice the fleeting chill in his eyes when he asked about her going to the Ou Family. 
As soon as she heard his question, she put down her chopsticks: “It was fine, but there was a rather unexpected gain today.” 
“What gain?” 
“The second branch of the Ou Family seems to have handed over the supply chain for Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry to Ou Mucen, and, I also heard that Yang Xueshan, discontent, intends to sabotage the supply.” Ye Ning held nothing back from him, and as soon as she opened her mouth, she revealed all the information she had learned. 
This was trust!
###75: Chapter 75: He has never seen such a terrifying her! 
75 -75: He has never seen such a terrifying her! 
The man, who had been eating carelessly, also felt it, and his fingers paused for a moment before he eventually set his chopsticks down… 
Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry actually gave the supply channel to Ou Mucen? 
This was indeed astonishing news. 
Back in the day, obtaining this supply channel had cost the girl in front of him and the second branch of the Ou Family a great deal of effort. 
It was this channel that doubled the sales of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry and turned the fortunes of the second branch around completely. 
Who would have thought they would relinquish it just like that? 
A mocking smile crossed Lin Yebai’s lips, “It seems Ou Mucen is much more fearsome than we imagined. 
With just this farce, he made the second branch hand over something so important. 
Aning, you must be careful with this man.” 
Ye Ning nodded, “I know, I will be careful. 
However, I think what Yang Xueshan said about tampering with the supply is a good opportunity.” 
“What opportunity?” 
“Murder by a borrowed knife!” 
Murder by a borrowed knife? 
Lin Yebai looked up at her; a hint of confusion flickered through his deep, gentle eyes… 
What does she want to do? 
Why does she look so terrifying at this moment? 
“With Ou Mucen’s intelligence, he probably already suspects that the second branch won’t let things go and will take precautions. 
But Yang Xueshan, now blinded by hatred and anger, is eager to take revenge on Ou Mucen. 
I guess she will definitely tamper with the first batch of Original Jade Stone provided by the Huo Family.” 
“And then?” 
“Then…” 
The woman sitting there suddenly let out a chilling laugh, “Then I will let this batch of Original Jade Stone enter Ou Mucen’s factory as she wishes. 
Once the finished product is on the market and Yuzhirun is hit by the scandal of counterfeits, that’s when I can tell him that it was all that wretched woman’s doing!” 
The truly bone-chilling expression, the dark red eyes, the somewhat ferocious look, even the fingers holding the chopsticks were emitting a creaking noise, the whole demeanor was utterly spine-chilling. 
Lin Yebai felt a constriction in his heart and couldn’t help but turn his head to look elsewhere… noveldrama
She was actually a woman as delicate as an orchid, with a tranquil and elegant demeanor, a gentle personality, and an inherently kind heart. 
But hatred had now filled her eyes with nothing but cold murderous intent, like layers of ice on a winter night, sharp and piercing, even a single glance was enough to send shivers down one’s spine. 
It took a while for the discomfort in Lin Yebai’s heart to subside as he looked away. 
Then his eyes moved forward, and he saw Xiaobao sitting on a children’s chair, holding a bowl, completely engrossed in the television, oblivious to everything around him. 
Lin Yebai sighed with relief. 
“This plan is good, but in the end, you might get caught up in it yourself.” 
“Hmm?” 
“You yourself said that Ou Mucen is an extremely clever man. 
If the plan really succeeds, do you think he wouldn’t suspect you? 
You are now his assistant, specifically hired back for your appraisal skills, which he became aware of in yesterday’s drama. 
If Yang Xueshan tampers with this batch of jade and you fail to detect it, do you think you can avoid being implicated at the end of it all?” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
After sitting frozen for a long while, she reluctantly squeezed out a response, “Even if that’s the case, my goal will have been achieved by then, it won’t matter if he finds out.” 
Lin Yebai gave a bitter smile, “Aning, you’ve also spent time at Blue Mountain Villa; do you think the second branch of the Ou Family will collapse that easily?”
###76: Chapter 76: Consider It a Loan from Me! 
76 -76: Consider It a Loan from Me! 
“At most, they’ll just discard Yang Xueshan like a useless pawn. 
When that happens, Ou Muyuan and his son will still be living carefree. 
If you expose yourself then, what will you have left to get your revenge with?” 
“I…” 
“Aning, I know you’re eager for revenge, but you can’t act recklessly. 
To put it bluntly, Yang Xueshan is just a chess piece to Ou Yuze. 
Did you see what happened yesterday? 
As soon as that little star got into trouble, all of her shares in Starlight Company were seized by Ou Yuze, leaving her penniless. 
This shows that in the eyes of the Ou Family’s second branch, she is nothing more than a clown. 
If you really follow through with your plan, I’m afraid they might just use this woman as a scapegoat and get away with it all.” 
Lin Yebai truly hit the nail on the head. 
With his words, not only did he voice the current psychological state of the woman before him, he also analyzed the aftermath of a successful action. 
Indeed, that was the case. 
Despite being perceived by the media as the woman of the young master of the second branch of the Ou Family for the past five years, the true nature of her status and position in Blue Mountain Villa was something only she knew best. 
Therefore, if her plans were to succeed, when Ou Mucen followed up, Ou Yuze would definitely use her as a scapegoat, while his branch could cleanly disassociate themselves from the incident. 
Ye Ning sat quietly for a good while, eventually falling silent… 
Seeing her silence, Lin Yebai inwardly let out a sigh of relief! 
He knew that she was actually a very intelligent girl, or else she wouldn’t have come up with such a flawless plan. 
It’s just that she was too hasty, forgetting what a nest of vipers the Ou Family at Blue Mountain Villa was. 
She had also forgotten how cold-blooded and ruthless a man named Ou Yuze was. 
Therefore, it was essential for him to remind her now, to cool down and not to do anything foolish. 
After a prolonged silence, the sound of cutlery meeting dishes finally echoed again, “Lin Big Brother makes sense. 
I was too impatient.” 
Lin Yebai smiled, “That’s not exactly it. 
It’s just that when you’re in the midst of the game, it’s hard to see everything clearly. 
If the second branch of the Ou Family could be toppled so easily, Ou Mucen wouldn’t have had to wait until now.” 
Ye Ning nodded, “You’re right, I was negligent.” 
Her rare display of humility in that moment made her seem just like a child who had done something wrong and was humbly accepting her lesson. 
Lin Yebai was satisfied and gave her a few more reminders about needing to be cautious of Ou Mucen while at work. 
By the time the conversation was over, the wall clock was already pointing to 9:30. 
“It’s getting late. noveldrama
I need to get back. 
As for the house, I’ve already found someone to look for one near the city center. 
The paperwork should be done in a couple of days, then I’ll come to pick you and Xiaobao up.” 
It was suddenly pronounced when he was about to leave. 
The moment Ye Ning heard this, she was stunned, “But… 
Why so sudden? 
Lin Big Brother, I really…” 
Lin Yebai glanced at her lightly, “It’s just too far from the city here. 
It’s not convenient for you to be running back and forth with Xiaobao all the time. 
Living in the city will be better.” 
As he spoke, he paused, perhaps realizing that if he just made this arrangement, this girl with a strong sense of pride might not accept it. 
So he added, “Just consider it a loan from me. 
You can pay me back when you get your salary.” 
Ye Ning: “…”
###77: Chapter 77: Mama, does Uncle Lin like you? 
77 -77: Mama, does Uncle Lin like you? 
After a while, she finally lowered her head and said, “Lin Brother, I really appreciate you. 
These past years, if it hadn’t been for you, I don’t even know if I would’ve been alive in this world.” 
Lin Yebai smiled, his eyes dark like ink jade behind the thin glasses, seemed like a gentle breeze over a river in March. 
Just one glance warmed up everything around… 
“What nonsense are you talking about? 
You helped me before too. 
Isn’t it only right that I help you now?” 
“…” 
Ye Ning looked downward… 
She had indeed helped him before, yet, the help he was providing her now was surely many times greater than what she had offered him in the past, wasn’t it? 
After Lin Yebai had left, Ye Ning also tidied up the house and took Ye Xiaobao, who had played in her room until he was disheveled with sleepiness, to wash up. 
“Mommy, does Uncle Lin like you?” While washing the little guy’s hair, he suddenly asked such a question. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s face turned red instantly: “What nonsense are you talking? 
How could Uncle Lin like Mommy?” 
Ye Xiaobao opened his innocent big eyes wide: “But I saw Uncle Lin always likes to stare at Mommy. 
Look, just now at dinner, he was staring at your lips. 
If he didn’t like Mommy, why would he stare at a woman’s lips?” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
This was indeed a very embarrassing and heart-pounding question. 
If a man didn’t care very much for a woman, how could he notice such details? 
Ye Ning started to feel overwhelmed by her son’s shrewdness. 
So, she crouched down there, thought for a moment, then carefully asked with a blushing face, “Does Xiaobao like Uncle Lin?” 
Ye Xiaobao, with his head full of white bubbles, turned back to look at his mother: “Does Mommy like him?” 
Ye Ning was choked up again! 
Why did he always counter-ask whenever she posed a question? 
Who was the mother here, and who was the son? noveldrama
“If Mommy likes him, then Xiaobao likes him too. 
But, I think Mommy probably doesn’t like Uncle Lin.” 
“Why?” 
“Because Mommy doesn’t blush. 
When a woman likes a man, she blushes. 
Look, that day, when you saw Uncle Bingkuai, how badly you blushed!” 
“…” 
What on earth was this little rascal learning all this messy stuff from? 
And, who was Uncle Bingkuai? 
Ye Ning’s brain got stuck for a moment, and it wasn’t until she had taken care of him and lifted his fragrant self out of the bathroom and tossed him onto the bed that she suddenly realized who he was talking about!! 
This mischievous kid, had he gone crazy? 
To think he actually believed she and that man… 
Ye Ning couldn’t suppress her irritation any longer: “Ye Xiaobao, let me tell you, that was not blushing!! 
That was from being angry!!” 
Ye Xiaobao, finally feeling comfortable after his bath, had closed his eyelids with a flutter, and in his drowsy state, he heard his mother’s shrill voice. 
His tender and cute little mouth smacked together: “Mommy, good night…” 
Ye Ning: “…” 
What sort of son was she raising? 
—— 
Ou Mucen was woken up very early the next day by a phone call from his mother Bai Tingfang… 
“Baozi, did you secure the supply channels of their second house yet?” 
As soon as the call connected, this address unexpectedly came through, causing the man who had just awakened from sleep to suddenly recall another little one with tiny arms and legs, and immediately he felt goosebumps all over. 
“Mom, can you stop calling me that? 
How old am I now?” 
Bai Tingfang laughed from the other end, “Why? 
You’re too old to be my son now? 
Baozi sounds so nice; that’s the name I gave you when you were little.”
###78: Chapter 78: Mucen, Shall We Meet the Mayor’s Daughter Tonight? 
78 -78: Mucen, Shall We Meet the Mayor’s Daughter Tonight? 
Ou Mucen: “…” 
He gazed helplessly at the ceiling for a while before finally putting down his phone, turning on speaker mode, and climbing out of bed. 
“Who told you I took their stock channels?” 
“Your second brother came to pay respects to the old man this morning and mentioned it himself. 
He also said it was to compensate you, so I gave you a call to ask about it,” Bai Tingfang hastily explained over the phone upon sensing her son’s displeasure. 
There was no helping it; she knew her son well. 
Ever since he was young, the last thing he liked was people keeping tabs on his movements or planting spies around him. 
If he ever found out about such things, it wouldn’t go well for anyone involved, not even if it was his own mother. 
Hearing that it was Ou Muyuan who went to the old man that morning, the man on the phone did indeed look less upset than before. 
“Hmm, I got it; I just signed the contract yesterday.” 
“Really? 
That’s wonderful! 
Listen, Xiaocen, you must seize this opportunity well this time; you can’t let them get the upper hand again…” 
She prattled on and on… 
Ou Mucen wasn’t really listening; instead, he carelessly set the phone on the washbasin and began tending to his own business in the mirror. 
“By the way, Xiaocen, your father has invited the mayor over to our house tonight. 
Could you come back for a bit?” 
Ou Mucen, who was shaving, paused: “The mayor? 
What’s he inviting him for?” 
Bai Tingfang: “It’s probably some investment issues. 
I don’t really understand it myself, but what I do know is that he’s bringing his daughter along.” 
His daughter? 
The overbearing mayor’s precious daughter? 
The man, who was washing his face, immediately felt a wave of repulsion at the news: “I’m not available; I’ve got an appointment tonight.” 
“What appointment could you possibly have? 
Let me tell you, Mucen, that kid from the second house was so thrilled to hear that the mayor’s daughter was coming that he didn’t even go to work today, and here you are telling me you have an appointment tonight? 
You…” 
The line went silent, and the crisp “beep beep” of the dial tone almost made her explode with rage. 
Ah! 
What kind of son was she raising? 
Always at odds with her—it’s not like asking him to meet a girl was tantamount to taking his life, was it? 
Does he not realize that’s the mayor’s daughter? 
If the sly kid from the second house ends up marrying her, it would be really disadvantageous for their branch of the family! 
Bai Tingfang hung up the phone, fuming… 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, after hanging up, didn’t spare another thought for the matter. 
He checked the watch on his wrist, saw it was nearly time, grabbed his briefcase, and left the house. 
The mayor’s daughter? 
If he wanted to, Ou Mucen could have any woman he desired. 
Let Ou Yuze have her if he’s interested. 
Half an hour later, at the Ou Empire Building— 
Secretary Gao had just arrived at the company when she saw the president, briefcase in hand, also appearing at the elevator door, leaving her somewhat astonished. 
The president hadn’t been at the company all of yesterday and probably had been busy until late. 
Why had he come so early today? 
Secretary Gao was inexplicably a bit anxious: “Young Master Mucen, good morning!” 
“Notify Yuzhirun Management Department, meeting in ten minutes!” 
“…” 
Secretary Gao stood there, watching as he walked away without giving her a second glance, and quickly picked up the phone on the desk to make the call. 
They had just received the jade samples from the Huo Family yesterday, so it was natural they would hold a meeting about the jewelry section today. noveldrama
But just as she picked up the phone, the man who had reached his office and pushed the door open, turned back around looking quite displeased: “Where’s An Ning?”
###79: Chapter 79 Is An Ning Not Coming to Work Anymore? 
79 -79 Is An Ning Not Coming to Work Anymore? 
An Ning? 
Secretary Gao was taken aback for a moment! 
An Ning, he didn’t know, he had also just arrived, had she not come yet? 
Secretary Gao looked towards Xiaochen on the side, “Xiaochen, has An Ning arrived?” 
Xiaochen’s face turned pale immediately, “No… 
I’ve been waiting for her all day, but I haven’t seen her…” 
His voice carried a hint of sobbing, and his expression was filled with as much panic as panic could be! 
Secretary Gao saw this, and his heart sank… 
That’s right, he had forgotten, An Ning had an incident last night at the Royal, and she was nearly ruined by that scumbag; was it even possible that she would come to the office today? 
And to make matters worse, she had slapped the president last night! 
It was over, he estimated this was hopeless. 
Secretary Gao turned around and looked very cautiously at the BOSS who was still there waiting; in just this short period, the man’s complexion had turned iron blue, cooling the entire office’s temperature. 
He hastily glared at the woman beside him, “Then why haven’t you called her yet?” 
“I… 
I called, but couldn’t get through…” 
Damn!! 
Did he really want to strangle her or what? 
What was the use of keeping such a good-for-nothing around? 
He grabbed the keys from the desk, ready to personally pick her up, “Third Young Master, don’t worry, I was the one who took An Ning home last night, I know where she lives, I’ll bring her back right now.” 
Having said that, he was ready to leave! 
In fact, Secretary Gao understood the president’s reaction very well. 
It was not easy to recruit an executive assistant responsible for Yuzhirun. 
Besides being sharp and capable, the most important thing was the ability to appraise jewelry, and this was something they hadn’t found after such a long search. 
So, An Ning’s arrival, regardless of her work ability, solely based on her skill of recognizing the authenticity of jade at a glance, made her the irreplaceable choice for this position. 
Taking the keys, he hurried out, intending to drive to the suburbs from last night and bring that woman back no matter what. 
But just as he reached the elevator door, the elevator suddenly ‘dinged,’ opening by itself… 
“Secretary Gao, good morning. 
I’m sorry, the bus I took this morning got stuck in serious traffic, and I’ve just arrived… 
I… 
I’m late…” 
“…” 
Secretary Gao stood there stunned for a full five seconds before clenching the car keys in his hand, and with a smile at the woman, who was sweating profusely in the elevator, he said, “No worries, I’ll help you talk to the Third Young Master later, so he won’t penalize you.” 
“Really? noveldrama
Thank you so much!” Ye Ning was sweating heavily, still clutching the breakfast she hadn’t had time to eat. 
This morning, she really hadn’t expected the traffic to be so bad. 
Heaven knows how anxious and frantic she felt on her way here, watching the minutes tick by on her wristwatch, fearing that if she were late this time, she might really get fired. 
Thank goodness Secretary Gao would help her. 
Ye Ning let out a long sigh of relief. 
Stepping out of the elevator, she quickly followed him and lowered her head as they entered the office. 
When she came to work yesterday, her work desk was arranged in the president’s office, and she had gone out with the president on the first day, already causing much displeasure among many colleagues. 
Now that she was late again, she dared not meet those glares any longer; it was better to quickly get in and attend to her own tasks. 
So, as she made her way, she did not look at the gazes of her colleagues; instead, she followed Secretary Gao straight into the president’s office. 
“Third Young Master, An Ning is here!” 
“…”
###80: Chapter 80 Who allowed her to get so close to him? 
80 -80 Who allowed her to get so close to him? 
Ye Ning also hurriedly followed and greeted the man in the office, “Third Young Master, good morning, sorry, I… 
got stuck in traffic on the bus today, and I’m late. 
I apologize, next time, I will definitely come earlier.” 
She was truly afraid of the man in front of her, for he had already warned her yesterday that if she were late again, he would have her thrown out of the Ou Corporation! 
But to her surprise, this time after she said those words, she didn’t hear a response for a long time. 
Sneaking a glance up, she realized that the man seated behind the desk was not looking at her at all and was continuously typing something on his laptop. 
The morning sunlight was just right, streaming in through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the office and casting strands of gold on him. 
He appeared noble and aloof, like the most perfect piece of art, his exquisite features scattered in the dazzling light, so captivating that one could not look away. 
“In ten minutes, the Yuzhirun meeting will convene, take this sample on the desk, have a good look at it, and prepare an analysis report for them.” 
“Ah? 
Oh, okay…” 
Ye Ning snapped back to her senses, and her cheeks flushed with a rush of heat. 
She hurriedly withdrew her gaze, noticing that there was indeed an original jade stone to the right of his desk, so she quickly went over and picked it up. 
This was a fine piece indeed! 
As soon as she approached, she felt a chill in her pupils and had to lower her gaze and turned to look elsewhere. 
“Third Young Master, is this a new sample we received?” 
“Hmm, what do you think?” 
“It’s very good, it’s premium material, suitable for bracelets and even complete sets of jewelry, but it requires a large area to work with.” Ye Ning, holding the stone, returned to her own seat and began to pretend to examine it with a magnifying glass. 
This was indeed a fine piece; it seemed he had obtained it from the Huo Family yesterday. 
However, since that woman Yang Xueshan said she would tamper with this batch of goods, could the Huo Family ensure that the entire batch was of this quality? 
Ye Ning was entering her data into her notebook while pondering this question… 
Ou Mucen was dealing with his work when he heard her mention the area required for set jewelry and paused, subconsciously opening the company’s internal webpage and entering the newly released drafts page of the design department. 
“Area? 
How do you calculate that?” 
Ye Ning turned around and saw that he was not looking at her but staring at his laptop, and she was somewhat at a loss, “What did you say?” 
Ou Mucen frowned, “The area for the jewelry you mentioned, the company’s new line is preparing for a grand relaunch, adopting a style that is both luxurious and grand. noveldrama
The sets require a significant amount of material. 
I’m not sure if the area you talked about is sufficient?” 
Ou Mucen wasn’t very knowledgeable about jade. 
He invested in this project because he saw the enormous profits it could bring, which is why he established Yuzhirun. 
However, when it came to estimating the area of jade needed for jewelry, he truly didn’t understand. 
As a result, upon hearing this, Ye Ning blurted out, “In that case, let me have a look.” 
Having said that, she naturally came over. 
Ou Mucen looked up, startled for a moment! 
What is she doing? 
Who allowed her to come over? 
Inadvertently, it seemed that she had already forgotten that he was her boss and was now approaching him with light steps, moving past the wide expanse of his desk to his side.
###Chapter 81: Chapter 81: Dead Woman, Where Are You Touching?
"This design is not bad, elegant and luxurious, nobly extravagant, but this pendant here would be better if it were a little smaller..." 
Emerald-like fingers reached out, the beige collar carrying the unique scent of the girl’s lemon fragrance, which was as refreshing as a sudden burst of sunlight in the mountains. Ou Mucen turned his head and all he could see was her white and tight skin. 
At 23, it was the time when a woman’s beauty was in full bloom. Her ear-length hair casually tucked behind her ear, revealing a full forehead, her skin smooth and delicate. From his angle, she looked like a ripe peach, and he actually... 
Felt a touch of thirst! 
This woman, what on earth was she doing? Did she know where she was? 
"This jade piece doesn’t have to be so big either, making it teardrop-shaped would do!" 
Ye Ning still didn’t realize that in someone else’s eyes, she had become a delicacy waiting to be savored. Accustomed to her carefree ways, she had completely forgotten where she was at this moment, and who was sitting beside her? 
Ye Ning truly had forgotten. She had lost track of where she was, and also forgotten the identity of the person in the room with her. 
Not until all the sounds in the air suddenly quieted down did she sense something amiss. Turning her head, she saw the man sitting in the chair had become stiff, his squinting eyes frightening! 
Only then did she suddenly wake up, and in the next instant, she immediately withdrew her finger, "I’m... I’m sorry, Third Master, I... I forgot it was you." 
As she spoke, she turned to leave the desk at once. 
But just at that moment, a coffee cup next to the notebook, precisely at the spot where she turned, went unnoticed. With a "clang," the sleeve of her clothing brushed it, knocking it from the desk, and it landed right on the man sitting in front of it! 
"Ah—" 
"Damned woman, did you do that on purpose?" 
Ou Mucen almost instantly sprang from his chair, for the coffee was freshly made when he arrived, and it had hit precisely the most sensitive part of a man. 
Ye Ning was utterly dumbfounded!
Damn! 
This was really a big mess now! 
"No, I didn’t mean it, I’m so sorry..." Watching the man who had jumped up from the coffee splash, she reflexively pulled out a large stack of tissues from the desk, then reached toward that area to wipe it! 
As a result... noveldrama
The already agitated man suddenly became rigid as someone pressed a sensitive spot, his expression turned fierce, "What are you doing?!!" 
Ye Ning: "I was... I was..." 
Oh my god! 
What was she really doing? 
She quickly threw the tissues in her hand away and almost crawled out from the desk in disarray, "I’m so sorry, I just... just now I was worried it would scald you, so..." 
Ye Ning wished she could find a hole to crawl into, her heart pounding as if it was about to leap out of her throat. 
She was no longer an inexperienced girl, she’d had a child, and even though that night five years ago was a scar she never wanted to revisit in her life, she knew about the male body.
###Chapter 82: Chapter 82: Third Young Master, I’ll go buy you a pair of pants right away!
Because five years ago, it was that thing that took her innocence and also made her give birth to Xiaobao! 
Ye Ning wanted to flee through the door... 
But at that moment, Secretary Gao knocked and entered from outside, "Third Young Master Ou, it’s time for the meeting..." 
He had only said that much when he suddenly felt the weird atmosphere in the office and took a closer look, "Oh my god, Third Young Master, your pants..." 
Before he could finish his sentence, a thick folder from behind the desk had already been thrown at him: "Get out!!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Secretary Gao was quick to react, probably used to such occurrences, dodged the deadly strike with a tilt of his head and "whooshed" out of there. 
Of course, he also closed the door behind him. 
"Third Young Master, please hurry, they’re all waiting in the conference room." 
"..." 
Ye Ning suddenly felt a shiver because she realized the temperature in the office had dropped so low that even her breath felt like it was freezing. 
What to do? What to do? 
He was about to attend a meeting, but his pants were now in such a state because of her; how could he go out like that? 
Ye Ning shrank back near the door, trembling as she stole a glance at the man opposite her. Seeing his expression look as if he was about to commit murder, she shivered violently and her mind began to race. 
Right, she could buy him another pair. There was a shopping mall right downstairs from the building. She could just go down and buy a pair for him. 
With that thought, she felt as if she had grasped a lifeline and hurried to her own desk, reaching out to take her bag: "Third Young Master, don’t worry, I’ll go buy them right now, quickly, very quickly, I’ll be right back..." 
After speaking, she didn’t dare to look at him or wait for his consent, pulling open the door and rushing out. 
If she had dirtied his pants, she certainly had to compensate for it. Since that was the case, going down now to buy him a pair was the best thing to do. 
Bursting out of the office, she ran into Secretary Gao. Seeing her rushing like that piqued his interest, "An Ning, where are you going?" 
Ye Ning was frantic, "I’m going out for a bit, I’ll be back soon, you go to the conference room and tell them to wait..." 
Alright! 
Secretary Gao, who was a crafty one, saw her carrying that little bag and, thinking back to the scene he had just witnessed in the office, he understood... 
Having someone else run errands for him felt great, but where was this woman going to buy? It couldn’t be the mall downstairs, could it? 
Oh no! 
Please don’t! 
Secretary Gao’s expression changed as he rushed out, trying to stop the woman he had just seen, "An Ning, the President’s clothes are all custom made, you have to go... to Platinum Apartments on Fort Road to get them, otherwise, he won’t wear them!" noveldrama
The last few words were so low that only he could hear them because as soon as he rushed out, the elevator doors had already closed. 
This was really a mess now! 
Secretary Gao felt as if all his previous delight had been for nothing... 
And what about Ye Ning? 
After getting into the elevator, she immediately pressed the button for the fourth floor. 
She knew very well who Ou Mucen was—he was the Third Young Master of the Ou Family, the President of the Ou Corporation; therefore, his wardrobe couldn’t be subpar. She decided to head straight to the fourth floor, since it was the highest-end department store within the Ou Corporation. 
Thus, after reaching the fourth floor, she came out of the elevator and immediately went to the men’s wear section to start looking for what she needed.
###Chapter 83: Chapter 83: That... Third Young Master, what shoe size do you wear?
Today, he was wearing a dark blue casual suit with thin stripes, paired with a black shirt underneath. With such a color combination, the best choice for the pants would be black or some other dark color. 
She walked all the way until she finally stopped in front of a men’s clothing store that could be considered an international top brand. 
"Hello, miss, how much are these pants?" 
"This pair is originally priced at 7,800, but since you’re our store’s first customer of the day, I can offer you a membership price, making it 6,800 after the discount." The sales associate’s smile was incredibly sweet, and upon seeing a customer so early in the morning, she immediately took down the pair of pants Ye Ning wanted. 
Ye Ning was shocked... 
6,800! My goodness, why are they so expensive? That’s enough to cover a month’s living expenses for her and Xiaobao. 
She clutched her purse and her face suddenly became a bit embarrassed, "It’s a bit pricey. Do you have anything more affordable?" 
"Miss, generally speaking, our brand’s prices are fairly consistent. However, you should know that this brand is often worn by some of the prominent figures in A City. Our designs are unique, and many people recognize them at a glance." 
Is that so? 
Ye Ning thought of the man in the office! 
Right, when it comes to being well-known, who in this city could surpass his fame? That being the case, she really only had one option. Otherwise, if she bought a cheap pair of pants, he might not even wear them. 
So she bit the bullet and finally took out the money she had intended to use to pay for the skirt Secretary Gao had helped her buy the night before: "Alright then, I’ll take that pair in dark coffee color." 
The sales associate smiled, "Sure, what’s the size you need?"
Size? 
She was doomed; she had no idea! 
Ye Ning had never bought anything for a man before, so how would she know his size? But if the pants didn’t fit, if they were too big or too small, wouldn’t that be even more troublesome? noveldrama
Ye Ning stood there struggling for a long time before she finally took out her phone and dialed a number... 
Upstairs, the man who had just changed into a new outfit from his office was about to head to the meeting room when he suddenly heard the phone on his desk ring. He reached out and picked up the receiver, "Hello..." 
"Um... Mucen, could I ask what size you wear? The pants here come in sizes..." 
"..." 
It was that woman. He hadn’t expected her to actually go buy him pants! 
Ou Mucen stood there, a cold laugh escaping his lips, "Buy them all and have me try them!" After saying that, he hung up the phone with a "click." 
Is she a pig? How could the pants not have sizes? 
Also, who was it that let her leave the office just now? Since she enjoyed going to the mall during work hours so much, well, he’d let her thoroughly enjoy the pleasure of shopping. 
After hanging up, he walked out of the office with his laptop in hand. 
Outside, Secretary Gao was anxiously waiting for the woman downstairs to come back when he suddenly heard the door to the CEO’s office open behind him. He turned around, and his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets! 
What? 
The CEO had already changed his clothes? What was he up to? Where did he get those clothes? 
Secretary Gao was puzzled until he realized that the clothes the man was wearing looked exactly like the outfit he had fetched from Platinum Apartments last month when he had been too busy with work to go home and had asked Gao to gather some necessities. It was then that he finally understood.
###Chapter 84: Chapter 84: Doesn’t he feel guilty for playing her like this?
Damn! 
So the president already had a backup plan! 
Then why didn’t he say anything just now? Seeing that woman in such a hurry, doesn’t his conscience bother him? 
Secretary Gao thought that the reason the president’s pants were dirty was that he accidentally spilled coffee on himself, but she had no idea that it was entirely caused by some woman, which is why she rushed downstairs to buy him a pair of pants. 
After hanging up the phone, Ye Ning eventually picked out a pair of pants herself, paid for them, and hastily went upstairs with them. 
"Eh? Xiaochen, where is the Young Master?" 
"The Young Master, oh, he’s gone to a meeting, and yes, he said that you should hurry over after you get up here." Xiaochen was much nicer to her today because of what had happened yesterday. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning froze... 
A meeting? 
Weren’t his pants dirty? How come he’s still going to a meeting? Could it be that he no longer cares about his appearance? She remembered that when he was at Blue Mountain Villa, he was someone who had very high standards for his own appearance. 
Ye Ning grew puzzled, holding the bag in her hand as she entered the office. Seeing that there was indeed no one inside, just the jade sample on the table, she casually placed the bag next to his chair and, holding the sample, also went to the meeting.
Upon reaching the door of the meeting room, indeed, she saw through the glass on the door the back of his head, clean and tidy, and at that moment, he was holding a pen to his temple with one hand, as if deep in thought. 
"Young Master, this proposal you’ve mentioned is indeed great for Yuzhirun, but can the quality of the new material meet our needs?" 
"Right, if we’re going to focus solely on A-grade products, the requirements for the raw materials will be extremely high." 
"Does the Young Master have a sample?" 
"Yes, yes, the sample is right here." Hearing that the people inside were talking about the sample, Ye Ning hurriedly pushed the door and entered with the Original Jade Stone in her arms. 
As soon as she entered, all the eyes in the meeting room fixed on her... 
Who is this woman? Why did she burst in without knocking? Doesn’t she know a meeting is in session? And a meeting chaired by the Young Master at that! 
Ye Ning felt somewhat embarrassed, as this was her first time meeting these Yuzhirun management staff, so not recognizing them was normal. 
Thus, after she walked in, she didn’t pay attention to the others, instead fixing her gaze on the man seated in front of her. 
However, when she saw clearly, suddenly, her expression froze... 
Eh? noveldrama
His clothes? 
"What are you standing there for, not showing them the sample?" 
"Oh, right!" While still suspiciously eyeing his outfit, Ye Ning placed the sample she had brought on the table for them to see. 
What’s going on? Why is he wearing a completely different set of clothes now? Could it be that he went and bought them himself while she was away? 
No, that can’t be right; in such a short time, it wouldn’t be possible for him to go out and buy them. So, did someone bring them to him? 
That’s not right either; he lives in Platinum Apartments on Fort Road, which is at least a 20-minute drive from here. How could that be faster than her going down to buy them for him? 
So it seems the only remaining possibility is that he already had spare clothes in his office. 
Ah! 
This bastard, actually toying with her. Does he have any idea how much she spent on those pants for him just now? It was the equivalent of a month’s living expenses for her and Xiaobao. How could he do this? 
Ye Ning’s mood soured on the spot, her expression turning stiff and rigid.
###Chapter 85: Chapter 85: Fine, as you say, big brother!
"Third Young Master, how is this stone material any different from the ones we provided before? They seem pretty much the same to us." 
"..." 
Pretty much the same? 
The man still sitting there didn’t even notice the change in the woman’s mood behind him. Hearing these people say there was no difference, his face immediately darkened, "An Ning, tell them, where exactly is this item different?" 
"..." 
No one spoke, the response he got were still those two very hateful stares. 
Ou Mucen paused for a moment, finally sensing something was off, and turned his head slightly. 
What kind of look was that? 
Was it about to devour him? 
He looked at the woman who was staring him down, as if ready to tear him apart, with a gaze that was anything but pleased, "What are you doing?" 
Ye Ning lowered her head but still remained silent... 
What do you think I want to do? It’s 6800, for God’s sake!!! 
But it seemed like this man had completely forgotten about it as if it had never happened. Seeing her just staring at him with those round eyes and not doing the task he had ordered, his eyes immediately turned stormy, "Can’t do it? If you can’t, then get out!" 
Ye Ning: "..."
Taking a deep breath, she finally managed to suppress the discontent in her heart for the moment and then went over to the sample, "This is called ’water head’ material, a soft jade stone, commonly known as jadeite. Although it’s not as noble as the ’ice’ type, it’s more than adequate for making A-grade products..." 
Fine, Ou the Great, you’re tough, you’re the boss, this place is yours, you call the shots! noveldrama
Wretched capitalist! 
So, during the following time, Ye Ning stopped worrying about the issue with his clothes. She explained the sample in detail to those people as he had instructed, and after the meeting, she followed them to the Yuzhirun Factory. 
As the President’s assistant responsible for this area, she naturally had to familiarize herself with this project. 
However, by the time she returned from her visit, it was nearly the end of lunch break. As she got back, she suddenly remembered the new trousers, so she hurried back to the office. 
Fortunately, when she arrived at the office, the white paper bag was still there, albeit having been moved from the chair where she had left it to the foot of the sofa in the office. 
Had he come back already? Seen it? 
Seeing this scene, she was startled, not for any other reason but because, after seeing what he had changed into, she no longer wanted him to see the trousers she had bought. 
She actually knew about the young master of the Ou Family, with a family wealth of billions, and his status and power were among the top in A City. 
So, the kind she had bought was something he would never wear. She had only impulsively decided to buy a replacement because she was in such a hurry. 
Taking the bag back, she frowned and thought that since it was now the end of work as well, she might as well take it down to return it. But at that moment, Xiaochen came in, "An Ning, going for lunch? Let’s go together!" 
Xiaochen, since yesterday’s incident, had completely changed his attitude towards her, probably feeling embarrassed and guilty. 
Seeing him, Ye Ning quickly stuffed the paper bag back into her drawer, "Sure, where should we eat?" 
"Let’s go to the company cafeteria, you’re new here and haven’t been there yet. It’s convenient, I’ll take you there today." 
"Great, let’s go right away!" 
Ye Ning tidied up a bit and then immediately left the office.
###Chapter 86: Chapter 86: Who Would Know? Is She the Foster Daughter from Five Years Ago?
Coming out of the office, Ye Ning remembered that the girl had been at the front desk all along, so she casually asked, "Xiaochen, did the Third Young Master Ou return to his office after the meeting?" 
"I don’t think so. He went to see a client right after the meeting. I even delivered the car keys to Secretary Gao." 
"Really?" Ye Ning was relieved all at once. 
So he hadn’t gone in! 
But if he hadn’t gone in, how had her bag ended up next to the sofa? Could it have been the cleaning lady? 
With a hint of doubt, Ye Ning followed the woman beside her down the stairs. 
When they reached the sixth floor and stepped out of the elevator, just after rounding the corner, the entire restaurant floor reserved by the Ou Family appeared before them. noveldrama
"Have you guys heard? The young miss from the Bai Family has returned from studying abroad." 
"Really? Which branch will she go to this time?" 
The moment they arrived, Ye Ning heard people discussing something... 
The young miss from the Bai Family? 
Wasn’t that the family the sister of Ou Mucen had married into? 
Ye Ning had spent time at Blue Mountain Villa and knew a bit about the Ou Family’s personnel relationships, so when she heard the "Bai" surname, she paid extra attention. 
"Miss Bai is the Ou patriarch’s granddaughter. She can go anywhere in the Ou corporation, right?" 
"Not necessarily. Her mother and the second branch of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry are full-blooded siblings. If she’s here, she’ll definitely go help Dragon-Phoenix. Why would she come to our Yuzhirun?" 
"..." 
The voices from the ongoing discussion seemed to lower gradually as more people arrived. 
Ye Ning, catching a glimpse, casually asked the girl beside her, "Is this Miss Bai really that impressive? They seem quite eager for her to join us." 
Xiaochen nodded, "She must be. She’s a famous jewelry designer overseas and has designed jewelry for many celebrities. I heard she’s come back at the invitation of Elder Ou to help with the family business, but I’m not sure if she will go to Longfeng or come to our Yuzhirun." 
Ye Ning, upon hearing this, couldn’t help but be surprised! 
She had seen the young miss from the Bai Family. After Miss Ou Mufeng got married and often came back to visit her father, she would occasionally bring her daughter along. 
That would be the young miss from the Bai Family! 
The young miss from the Bai Family wasn’t much older than her, also in her same year. Yet, she hadn’t expected that in five years, that same young miss would become a renowned jewelry designer overseas. 
Whereas she had become a person shunned from the limelight, a fallen prisoner. 
"So which branch do you think she will choose? As a jewelry designer, we really need someone like her at Yuzhirun." 
Xiaochen chuckled, "An Ning, stop dreaming. Bai Wei is the second branch’s own niece. Do you think she would come to our Yuzhirun?" 
Ye Ning paused... 
That made sense too. The second branch had always been at odds with the third. How could Mufeng’s daughter come to help Yuzhirun? 
Then again, that Third Young Master Ou probably wouldn’t care for her at all! 
Ye Ning thought of that privileged young master who didn’t give a damn about anyone and shook her head, smiling... 
They had come to eat because Xiaochen liked Western food, so they were looking for a spot to sit down in the Western dining area of the restaurant. But just then, at the entrance they had just passed, a commotion suddenly erupted! 
"Eh? Isn’t that Manager Yang from Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry? And, who is she with?" 
"..." 
Manager Yang? 
Ye Ning had just sat down when she heard this name. Looking up, she turned towards that direction. 
To her surprise, there she saw someone she could never have expected!
###Chapter 87: Chapter 87: The First Meeting After Five Years
A head of dense, golden waves cascaded casually over her shoulders, oozing charm and allure. Her features were quite exquisite, with thick lashes, captivating eyes, and full sensual lips—it was clear that she spent a considerable amount of time getting ready before heading out. 
"Yang Xueshan? What is she doing here?" 
Xiaochen also spotted the woman, and upon her arrival, her high-end designer attire immediately drew the attention of many. Xiaochen couldn’t help but frown. 
The Ou Family Restaurant was meant for employees, and it was uncommon for higher-ups in the company, especially women associated with the second young master of the Ou Family like herself, to come here. 
Yet today, she had come. What was this all about? 
Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, the woman casually scanned the restaurant with the girl following her. Her gaze naturally fell on the area where Ye Ning and her companions were sitting. "Weiwei, shall we have Western food instead? That place over there seems decent." 
"Sure!" 
It was then that the person following her fully came into their view. 
Weiwei? Could it be...? 
"Oh my gosh, could she be the young Miss of the Bai Family? To think she has arrived so soon?" 
Xiaochen’s mouth hung open in disbelief as she looked at the girl who had just stepped forward. 
The news of the young Miss Bai’s arrival had only spread through the company that morning, and Xiaochen thought it would be a couple of days before she arrived. She didn’t expect her to come so soon. 
So, running into them here today, could it be that Miss Bai had just gotten off the plane? Since there weren’t any decent places to dine nearby, had Yang Xueshan brought her here for a meal? 
As the two approached, those dining on Western cuisine nearby all stood up, and Xiaochen quickly tugged at Ye Ning, who was beside her. "An Ning, get up quickly!" 
Ye Ning, who had been looking at the girl she hadn’t seen in five years, was suddenly pulled to her attention by the person next to her. She looked over with a puzzled expression. "Hmm?" 
"Hurry up and stand, they’re coming over!" 
So what if they’re coming over, why stand? 
Ye Ning didn’t understand, but since everyone else had stood up, she followed suit. 
"Manager Yang..." 
"Manager Yang, you’re dining here as well?" 
"Hello, Manager Yang!" 
Upon standing, indeed, there were voices all around greeting the woman. noveldrama
Xiaochen was no exception. "Manager Yang, is this Miss Bai? We heard she was coming this morning, but I didn’t expect her to arrive so quickly." 
Xiaochen worked in the president’s office and usually ran errands for work coordination between the president’s office and Longfeng. 
Therefore, seeing the woman who had approached, she casually made an extra comment. 
Hearing this, Yang Xueshan, who was about to lead Bai Wei towards a table inside, paused. "You are... from the third young master’s presidential office?" 
Xiaochen immediately bowed her head. "Yes, I work at the front desk of the presidential office. This is An Ning, our third young master’s newly hired assistant." 
As she spoke, she unexpectedly pushed Ye Ning forward. 
Ye Ning quietly watched the two and remained silent... 
Ye Ning knew that the Empire Building of the Ou Family was the shared territory of the two sons of the old Mr. Ou. 
Therefore, the building’s layout was divided in two. The tower they were in belonged to the third young master, Ou Mucen, whereas the adjacent one focusing on office spaces belonged to Longfeng. 
When it was mentioned that Ye Ning was a newly hired assistant of Ou Mucen, the woman standing before them indeed turned her gaze toward Ye Ning...
###Chapter 88: Chapter 88: Who Are You Really?
It was a face that wasn’t particularly outstanding, with ear-length short hair, and features that only seemed delicately pretty at first glance, making her appear unremarkable when she stood there. 
But it was those eyes, after she looked over, she too quietly gazed back, and with that look, she unexpectedly felt a sudden "thump" in her heart! 
They were very stunning eyes, amber-colored, like glazing under the light, bright and captivating at a glance. 
Yet, within such star-like brilliance, she saw a trace of coldness—like a chill suddenly rising from the depths of a dark, serene pool. Once she saw it, she immediately focused her eyes and involuntarily shuddered! 
Those eyes... 
"Little uncle really has strange tastes now, hasn’t he? To even recruit someone of such appearance." 
Just as Yang Xueshan was looking at this woman, feeling unexplainably cold all over, the young miss of the Bai family, Bai Wei, who stood by her side, suddenly started to speak with a sneer after seeing Ye Ning. 
Xiaochen hurriedly explained, "An Ning is not just any assistant; she’s in charge of our Yuzhirun." 
"Yuzhirun?" 
"Yes, because she understands jade. You may not be aware that just a few days ago, there was a minor celebrity fraud case at our jewelry store. It was all thanks to her that we were able to expose the celebrity’s trickery. That’s why the third young master recruited her." 
Xiaochen was indeed "forthright"—in just a few words, he blurted out the whole affair. 
Ye Ning’s expression immediately worsened! 
Was she stupid? After the incident, as she had to work at Yuzhirun to avoid unnecessary trouble, even Ou Mucen had his secretary find those media reporters and delete all the videos and photos of her appearing at the jewelry store that day. 
Yet now, she spilled the beans without reserve. Was her brain really made of pig’s stuff? 
"So, it was you that day!" Upon hearing this, Yang Xueshan, who was standing opposite her, indeed turned ashen in an instant. 
No wonder she had felt a sense of familiarity in her eyes; she was actually the person she had seen in the store that day. 
Recalling the unique identification technique she had observed that day, she clenched her fists tightly, took a step forward, and interrogated, "Who exactly are you?" 
Who exactly are you? 
Ye Ning, looking at Yang Xueshan’s face filled with tension and wariness, couldn’t help but feel somewhat amused, "Manager Yang, my name is An Ning, as Xiaochen just explained. I’m a new assistant the third young master has brought in, and I haven’t even passed my probation period yet." 
"Assistant?" 
Yang Xueshan scrutinized her from head to toe, "If you’re just an assistant, then why did I see you wearing the NGTC uniform at the jewelry store that day? Also, I have never heard about the third young master recruiting an assistant to be in charge of Yuzhirun." 
What she said... 
Ye Ning looked at this woman and truly lost interest in engaging with her. 
First, she said she saw her at the jewelry store that day, yet that day, Longfeng asserted that they weren’t on-site, so wasn’t she contradicting herself? noveldrama
Second, Ou Mucen was a leader who controlled half of the Empire; since when did it become her place to know and comment about recruiting an assistant? 
With an air of mockery, Ye Ning couldn’t help but laugh, "Manager Yang, that I wouldn’t know. I’m just a newcomer. Previously, it was all ordered by the third young master. If you want to know more, you might want to ask the third young master himself."
###Chapter 89: Chapter 89 Do I Need a Reason to Splash You?
"You—" 
As soon as she said this, sure enough, the woman was instantly choked up! 
Ask Sanye? 
What does she think she is, a green onion or garlic? Daring to ask Sanye? 
Inside the Western restaurant, the atmosphere suddenly quieted down, and with such an atmosphere, the Ou Family employees dining around started sensing something was amiss, so they began to gather around. noveldrama
The newcomers, the assistants, they didn’t recognize, but this manager Yang, they did—she was the manager from Longfeng. 
But what kind of status did she have to dare to meddle in Sanye’s people’s affairs? 
In an instant, many people looked at this woman with disdain! 
Just as the standoff was happening, next to Yang Xueshan, which was the Bai Family’s young miss, seeing the woman who had brought her becoming deflated in Ye Ning’s mouth, suddenly stepped forward, "So, the incident that day, it was really you who did it?" 
"What?" 
"The jewelry store, that little celebrity, was it you who exposed her?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
It seemed like she couldn’t deny it now, could she? Anyway, Xiaochen had just spoken about it. 
So she nodded, "Yes, it was me!" 
"Very well!" 
Right after she said the word, the woman who suddenly approached without any warning, grabbed the glass of juice that was just ordered from the table and splashed it onto her face! 
My God! 
What is she doing? 
!!! 
The surrounding crowd, which had gathered around, all exclaimed, and their expressions, looking at this sudden scene, became utterly shocked. 
Even Yang Xueshan was taken aback! 
What was she doing? 
Could it be that she wasn’t afraid that her little maternal uncle would trouble her? This woman, after all, was the assistant he had recently recruited, wasn’t she? 
Ye Ning was also stunned, feeling the sudden cold downpour on her head, she was so shocked that she couldn’t react at all. 
This vile creature, what in the world was she doing? Resorting to physical attacks when she couldn’t win with words? 
Ye Ning’s chest began to heave... 
Similarly, Xiaochen standing beside her, upon seeing this scene, also quickly realized something was wrong and, regaining his senses, immediately stared angrily at the Bai Family’s young miss, "Miss Bai, what are you doing? Why would you splash An Ning without any reason? She hasn’t offended you!" 
Bai Wei threw the glass in her hand: "Do I need a reason to splash someone? This company is my grandfather’s, I can splash whomever I want, you believe that? If I’m not in a good mood tomorrow, I could even make you pack up and leave!" 
"You—" Xiaochen trembled with anger but then realized that she was powerless to retaliate. 
Indeed, this young miss from the Bai Family was highly favored by the Elder Mr. Ou of the Ou Family; the Ou family had many boys, the second household had also given birth to a son, and the wife the old master had later married bore him another boy. 
Therefore, after this young miss married off and had a daughter, she became very dear to his heart. 
Ye Ning stood there thinking of all this, and finally, she took a deep breath, suppressed the violent rage boiling in her chest, and wiped off the droplets from her face, "Alright, Xiaochen, it’s time for us to go back." 
"But..." 
"But what? It’s almost time for work, do you want to be late?" After saying that, Ye Ning grabbed her hand, ready to leave this place. 
However, just as the two had barely walked past the table, the woman behind them sharply threw another sentence at them, "An Ning, right? I advise you, if you know what’s good for you, you’d better hurry up and roll out of our Ou Family, or else, I’ll make your death a very ugly
###Chapter 90: Chapter 90 What Are You Doing?
Ye Ning, stop right there! 
Was she threatening her? noveldrama
Well, that’s too bad, for Ye Ning fears no threats. 
She wiped off the dirt on her face, snickered coldly, and finally turned around slowly, "Miss Bai, I was personally recruited by your uncle. If you want me out of the Ou Corporation, sure, just call your uncle and have him inform me, and I’ll roll out immediately!" 
"You—" 
As soon as those words fell, the woman standing behind her with such arrogance indeed had her pupils shrink sharply, and her face turned incredibly sinister! 
Ask her to notify her uncle? 
Had she gone mad? What was she? It wasn’t her place to personally notify anyone, right? 
More importantly, if she did that, she feared she wouldn’t be able to get rid of her. Instead, she would be the one who might suffer consequences. 
Because, this younger uncle of hers was not like her blood uncle. In her blood uncle’s house, she was a treasure, but in front of this uncle, perhaps, she was nothing at all. 
Bai Wei was so angry her face turned ashen, but at that moment, she really couldn’t say anything. 
Ye Ning saw this and sneered coldly, then she left with Xiaochen... 
Why the Bai Family’s young miss would suddenly treat her this way, she understood very clearly. The jewelry store incident — because of her intervention, the second branch of the Ou Family was not only severely scolded by Old Master Ou, but they were also forced to give up their supply channel, which was no small loss for them. 
Therefore, at the restaurant just now, Yang Xueshan dared not speak out against her. But Bai Wei was different; she was the most beloved granddaughter of the Old Master of the Ou Family, and naturally, she would take it upon herself to give Ye Ning a lesson. 
"An Ning, are you alright? I’m sorry, so sorry, it’s all my fault for running my mouth when I shouldn’t have." 
In the elevator, Xiaochen finally realized her mistake and hurriedly began to apologize to Ye Ning. 
Ye Ning was not in the mood to keep talking to her, so she replied indifferently with a "It’s fine", and then she didn’t say anything more. 
Seeing this, Xiaochen knew that she was probably also upset, so she sheepishly did not dare to say anything further. 
Not until the two of them returned to the president’s office did she notice that her hair and clothes were all stained with wet juice. So she quickly took out a set of uniform she had placed here, "An Ning, change into this, it’s new, I have never worn it." 
Ye Ning glanced at it, and eventually, she took the uniform from her hand. 
This was the president’s office, and now that she was covered in spills, she obviously needed to change, or else it would be inappropriate if others saw her this way. 
She took the set of uniform to the restroom, changed out of her dirty clothes, and also casually washed her hair. Only then did she come out and return to her own office. 
Huh? 
He’s back? 
As she opened the door, Ye Ning discovered that the person who had been absent from the office all morning had actually come back at this time, and suddenly, her heart involuntarily skipped a beat. 
"Third Master..." 
Ou Mucen had just returned from seeing a client and had only recently sat down. 
When he suddenly heard a voice at the door, he looked up to see a woman standing in front of him wearing the company staff uniform, her hair still damp, and behaving nervously. 
He paused, "What are you doing?" 
If he remembered correctly, the clothes she had on this morning were not this uniform, and moreover, what was with her soaking wet hair? 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning grew even more nervous, "Nothing much, I just got a bit dusty when I went to the factory this morning."
###Chapter 91: Chapter 91: Third Young Master, Miss Bai Has Returned...
Gray? 
He glanced at her somewhat ill-fitting clothes and said nothing more, his gaze cooling as he withdrew it and resumed his work. 
His factory had always upheld cleanliness as its standard—when had the dust become so thick that it warranted someone to wash their clothes and hair? 
His eyes narrowed slightly... 
Ye Ning, however, had no idea what the person across from her was thinking at that moment. Seeing that he didn’t pursue the matter further, she breathed a sigh of relief, hurriedly returning to her own desk to begin her work. 
This was not a matter of glory; she did not want him to know. 
Fortunately, after she had returned to her place, he didn’t look at her again, focusing solely on his work—his eyelids didn’t even lift again. 
So at that moment, the office that had become completely quiet was like a secluded corner cut off from the world. Apart from the tapping of keys and the quiet whirring of the air conditioning’s ventilation, the room was so silent that even dropping a needle on the floor could be heard. 
Ye Ning initially felt uneasy, but as she immersed herself in work, she gradually forgot her surroundings and her usual tension in facing this man, becoming engrossed in her work. 
It wasn’t until two hours later that a telephone suddenly rang in the office— 
"Hello?" 
"Third Young Master, the Original Jade Stone from the Huo Family has arrived. Do you want to come and have a look?" 
Original Jade Stone? 
He thought of the advertisement he’d had the marketing department create yesterday, his eyes flickering slightly, "Is there a problem?" 
The person on the other end of the phone hastily shook his head, "No, it’s just new stock, we just want to be extra cautious!" noveldrama
New stock? He thought, indeed, it warranted extra caution. 
Thus he glanced at the small head, buried in who knows what writing, at the desk across from him, and hung up the phone. 
"An Ning..." 
"Yes?" 
"Go to the factory. The large batch of jade stone samples that arrived this morning needs to be checked. Have a look," he said indifferently, his face devoid of emotion. 
Ye Ning was startled for a moment before nodding blankly after a while. 
That’s right, she had forgotten about this. Yesterday, at the "One Line Sky," she had heard that woman planning to tamper with the supplies—if it weren’t for Lin Yebai stopping her, she would have wanted to add fuel to the fire. 
It seemed she needed to go and see right away, to check if there were any issues. 
After agreeing, she truly left immediately. 
Her departure made the office even quieter. Ou Mucen saw this and took a sip of water from the cup on his desk, then dialed an external number: "What happened today?" 
The secretary, Gao, answered the phone outside. Hearing the question, his mind began to race, "Third Young Master, there’s nothing major. It seems that the young Miss from the Bai Family has returned." 
The young Miss of the Bai Family? 
The man who heard this slightly furrowed his brows, "When did she return?" 
"It seems it was at noon. Oh, and I heard Ou Yuze personally drove to the airport to pick her up." 
Ou Yuze? 
Upon hearing this name, the man’s complexion visibly darkened. 
He certainly knew of the young Miss of the Bai Family; she was a little girl spoiled by his father to the point of lawlessness. Relying on her status as his granddaughter, she was willful, capricious, and imperious in Blue Mountain Villa, a true little demon. 
But it was he who never took her seriously; otherwise, the Ou Family might very well be under her rule by
###Chapter 92: Chapter 92: Third Young Master, Miss Bai Family Spilled Water on Your Assistant
However, he didn’t like the girl, but those people from the second branch of the family treasured her dearly. After all, her mother and the second branch were blood siblings. 
Ou Mucen understood, and a cold smile curled on his thin lips as he hung up the phone. 
But Secretary Gao, outside, after bringing up this issue and thinking of some matters, came back in after hanging up: "Third Young Master, do you think Miss Bai from the Bai Family suddenly coming here could be to help their Longfeng?" 
Ou Mucen was expressionless: "Don’t know!" 
Secretary Gao choked! 
How could he not know? He was the president of the Ou Family, a person with such intelligence. 
Seeing that his BOSS had absolutely no interest in addressing this matter, Secretary Gao became a bit anxious: "Third Young Master, your niece is a famous jewelry designer abroad. If she comes back to help Longfeng, our Yuzhirun will be under great pressure." 
"Is she very famous?" 
Secretary Gao was stunned: "Yes, don’t you know? She’s internationally renowned and often designs jewelry for some international stars." 
"Is that so?" 
The man, who hadn’t even paused in his work, glanced up at him faintly: "Then why haven’t I heard of her?" noveldrama
Secretary Gao: "..." 
Suddenly, he figured it out... 
Indeed, a jewelry designer who even the president of the Ou Family hadn’t heard of, could she be considered a celebrity? 
Secretary Gao also started to smile, thinking of Miss Bai’s rumored arrogance, he blurted out: "She doesn’t think so, though. She’s made quite the entrance this time, even teaching your people a lesson!" 
"What?" 
"An Ning, don’t you know? At lunchtime, she was in the downstairs restaurant and happened upon An Ning. When she learned that it was An Ning who had exposed the little star’s scam, she splashed a glass of juice on her face right there and there. Now, she’s all over the top stories on the company’s BBS!" 
"..." 
In an instant, the man seated there felt a drop in the temperature in his eyes! 
So, that woman’s wet hair and the completely ill-fitting clothes she was wearing were because of this? 
He narrowed his eyes slightly and quickly accessed the company’s internal webpage on his notebook, then found the forum. 
Indeed, the moment he clicked in, he saw a very clear and large photo, which captured the moment Bai Wei threw the juice toward Ye Ning! 
Thus, from his view, he saw clearly the clenching wrath on the face of the person hurling the liquid, as well as the dumbfounded and unprepared expression of the person being splashed! 
"How about that? I’m Miss Bai of the Bai Family. I’ll splash whoever I want to. Got a problem with that?"
"..." 
"An Ning, is it? I warn you, if you’ve got no business here, get out of the Ou Family fast, or I will make your end a miserable one!" 
... 
One has to admit, the gossip enthusiasts of today are really impressive. Such a post not only had pictures and text but also came with a video, which recorded everything that happened and published it online. 
At this moment, the man with a dark aura alternating across his face sat there, noticing that the comments had already exceeded ten thousand, and to his surprise, most of them read— 
Miss Bai of the Bai Family makes a sudden return, ripping into her uncle Ou Mucen’s upstart new assistant!! 
Upstart... assistant? 
Secretary Gao stood opposite, suddenly feeling a sharp drop in the temperature around them, and finally, he came to his senses: "Third... Third Young Master..."
###Chapter 93: Chapter 93: Is it bad to give a man a pair of pants for his birthday gift?
"Isn’t Blue Mountain Villa holding a banquet tonight?" 
"Yeah... right..." 
"Good, give Miss Bai a call and tell her that her uncle misses her very much and insists that she comes over tonight." 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
Shit, that murderous vibe... 
Secretary Gao felt a chill at the back of his head and quickly left the office. 
Of course, Miss Bai, relying on the old man’s favoritism, was arrogant and lawless at Ou Corporation. But did she really think she could provoke just anyone? That would be a daydream! 
When Secretary Gao returned to his desk, he couldn’t help feeling a little schadenfreude... 
Meanwhile, at the factory, Ye Ning was unaware that the incident that had happened at the restaurant at noon had been discovered. After checking a batch of goods, she returned. 
This time Yang Xueshan didn’t lay a hand on her, which was quite surprising to her. However, when she saw the new season’s advertisement in the factory, she understood. 
It turns out that man, just as Lin Yebai had said, had calculated everything and even prepared the measures. 
The president’s brother of Ou Corporation? 
Heh, that move was really ruthless! 
She stared at the string of advertisement slogans and a sense of serendipity arose in her heart. Quickly bowing her head, she organized the data she had verified on this batch of jade and took it straight back to the tower. 
When she got back to the office, the man inside was no longer there; he probably had left because it was off work. So she took out the pants she had placed in the drawer and planned to return them after work. 
However, at that moment, her phone rang. 
"Hello? Ningning, this is Xiaoyu. Are you off work yet?" 
It was her friend Qiao Feiyu on the phone. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning immediately smiled: "I’m about to. What’s up, you have time to call me today? Are you done with classes?" 
Qiao Feiyu pouted: "No, don’t you remember, Ningning? It’s my brother’s birthday today, and look at you, I knew you would forget..." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Brother Lin’s birthday? 
She seemed... to have really forgotten! 
She quickly covered up with a laugh: "No, no, not at all, I’ve just started work. I’ll go to your brother’s place in a bit." 
"Really? Then how about this, I’ll pick Xiaobao up from school and bring him to Tang Garden. You’re far away and don’t have a car. After work, you can just take the bus home, how about that?" 
"..." 
Ye Ning sat there stunned for a moment! 
Like that? 
That’s fine, anyhow, what she said was true, she didn’t have a car, and going from here to Tang Garden couldn’t be better. 
So, after reminding her to be safe on the road, Ye Ning hung up the phone. 
Lin Yebai’s birthday is today? She really forgot, almost couldn’t recall such a matter. 
Annoyed with herself, she slapped her head and quickly picked up her bag.
But, it’s his birthday today, should she get him a present? 
Recalling the man who had been helping her all these years, she finally opened her bag. 
Unfortunately, when she opened her wallet, she only saw the bank card that had been emptied out that morning, along with a hundred or so RMB. 
Now, what should she get him? 
She agonized over the pants by her feet that she planned to return... noveldrama
"An Ning? An Ning, call for you from Secretary Gao!" As she sat there struggling, Xiaochen suddenly called out to her from outside. 
Secretary Gao? 
It’s after hours; what does he want with her? 
Upon hearing the name, Ye Ning immediately put down what she was holding and went outside to answer the phone.
###Chapter 94: Chapter 94 An Ning, Go to Blue Mountain Villa
Once outside, Xiaochen was indeed waiting for her with a phone in hand, "Who were you just on the phone with? Secretary Gao said she’s tried calling several times without getting through." 
A phone call? 
Ye Ning remembered the call she had just received from Qiao Feiyu and hurried over, "No, I just made a call home. Is Secretary Gao looking for me?"
As she spoke, she took the phone from Xiaochen. 
Everyone was off work at this time; a call now must mean there was an issue. 
Xiaochen nodded, "Mhm, there must be something." 
Upon hearing that, Ye Ning quickly put the phone to her ear, "Hello, Secretary Gao..." 
"An Ning, I’ve finally found you. You haven’t left yet, have you?" As expected, it was Secretary Gao on the line. Hearing it was her, his voice immediately rose significantly, sounding as if he was very happy she had picked up his call. 
Ye Ning, getting a bad feeling, hesitated for a long while before nodding, "I was just about to leave. Did you need me for something?" 
"Of course, don’t leave yet. Deliver the young master’s notebook to Blue Mountain Villa first." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Blue Mountain Villa? 
Standing there, holding the phone, she paused for a moment. It was as if a floodgate of memories had been opened in her mind, and all the painful, unhappy recollections of the years spent in that villa flooded back. 
No, she didn’t want to go to that place. Not in this lifetime, never again did she want to set foot in that cursed location! 
Ye Ning held the phone, her fingers turning progressively whiter, "Secretary Gao, I need to go home to pick up my child. I already troubled someone yesterday; today I must get back early." 
"But..." 
"Secretary Gao, please understand the difficulties of a single mother." After saying this, she didn’t wait for his agreement and hung up the phone with a "snap." 
Yes, although she had come to this company for revenge, it didn’t mean that she could do anything for them. If it was outside of her plan, she was fully entitled to refuse. 
After hanging up the phone, the girls at the front desk looked at her in astonishment, probably shocked that she dared to hang up on Secretary Gao’s phone call. 
Ye Ning smiled at them but didn’t bother to explain. She turned around and went back to the office to collect her belongings. Then, she left the building and ended her workday. 
Tang Garden was on East Street; she would probably need to take the subway from here. 
As she stepped out of the building, Ye Ning checked the map on her phone. To get to East Street, she would need to make several transfers; it would take about an hour. Worried that Qiao Feiyu would be waiting, she took out her phone and dialed her number. 
"Hello, Xiaoyu, it’s Ye Ning. I’ve finished work. Have you picked up Xiaobao?" 
"No, the kindergarten teacher said that Xiaobao had an activity today and went to perform with his classmates." 
An activity? 
Ye Ning was stunned! 
Xiaobao was only four years old and had been in that kindergarten for less than half a year. What kind of activity could such a small child have? noveldrama
Ye Ning was puzzled, "I haven’t heard about this. He didn’t tell me when school ended yesterday either." 
Qiao Feiyu was also downcast, "Exactly, that’s what I thought. But the teacher said that the Education Bureau had personally asked the kindergartens in each district to prepare performances, and they had specifically selected children. They even said Xiaobao is lively and cute, and being chosen was a great opportunity." 
What a bunch of nonsense!
###Chapter 95: Chapter 95: Ye Xiaobao was sent to Blue Mountain Villa...
Ye Ning felt a surge of anger as she hurried down the steps. She didn’t even want to take the bus anymore and decided to hail a taxi to go back to her place and figure out what exactly was happening. 
"Did you find out where they went? When can they come back?" 
"I’m asking right now, just wait..." 
As Qiao Feiyu spoke, the voice on the phone faded, probably because she was asking someone. 
So, Ye Ning stood by the roadside and waited. But after more than a minute, there was still a lot of indistinct chatter on the other end, and no clear answer had been given, causing her to lose patience. 
Qiao Feiyu rarely picked up Ye Xiaobao from kindergarten; she probably wasn’t very familiar with it. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning, anxious and unable to wait any longer, hung up the phone and directly called Xiaobao’s teacher, "Hello, Miss Huang? This is Ye Xiaobao’s mother. I want to know, is my son not at the kindergarten right now?" noveldrama
"Yes, yes, yes, Xiaobao’s mom, sorry, I’ve been so busy, I haven’t had the chance to call you yet. It’s like this, our kindergarten received a notice from the Education Bureau a while ago. The city leaders are coming for an inspection, and several kindergartens in our district arranged for some children to perform for them as representatives. Xiaobao was also selected, and it’s happening today." 
"And then what?" 
Ye Ning didn’t care to hear about these formalities; she was concerned about her son’s whereabouts. 
"Well, originally, the reception event was scheduled for noon today, but those leaders were delayed, so it shifted to the evening. Don’t worry, Xiaobao’s mom. Once the performance is over, we’ll definitely bring the children back personally." 
The kindergarten teacher, probably sensing Ye Ning’s displeasure, quickly assured her that they would return the children. 
But what about Ye Ning? 
As soon as she heard that to welcome these so-called leaders, such young children had to wait until evening to be brought back, she was utterly disappointed with the kindergarten! 
What kind of kindergarten is this? To please these so-called leaders and use such young children as tools! 
Ye Ning coldly interrupted, "No need, Miss Huang. Tell me, where did my son go to perform? I’ll pick him up myself." 
"Xiaobao’s mom, we..." 
"Miss Huang, my child is only four years old, and I really can’t rest easy. Please, just tell me!" 
"..." 
After a long silence, the teacher on the phone finally gave her a location, "At Blue Mountain Villa in Qianshui Bay..." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Blue Mountain Villa?! 
Ye Ning was stunned! 
Why Blue Mountain Villa? Why would children from a perfectly good kindergarten go to that godforsaken place? 
Her mind began to panic, standing there amidst the traffic coming and going as if something in her brain had exploded. She lost even her most basic reflexes. 
Blue Mountain Villa was a place she now didn’t even want to set eyes on. In her heart, it was like a poisonous snake—ugly, disgusting, venomous, and extremely dangerous. 
It was for this reason that even when she returned here with a new identity, she stayed well away from that place. Especially for her child, she kept him away from the hustle and bustle of this urban area, just to keep him from having any contact with that tiger’s den. 
And now, this damnable kindergarten had sent him straight there! 
Ye Ning’s whole body started to tremble...
###Chapter 96: Chapter 96 Who is Worthy of Their Third Young Master?
The teacher kept saying on the phone, "Xiaobao’s mom, don’t be upset. The kids were originally supposed to perform at the city hall, but then the city leaders went to Qianshui Bay, so the Education Bureau had us send the children there, Xiaobao’s mom..." 
!!!!!! 
There was no sound anymore, and the woman who was trembling slightly on this end of the line, after abruptly hanging up the phone, bolted back towards the skyscraper she’d just exited. 
To go to Qianshui Bay, those officials would undoubtedly settle into the largest financial dynasty home, the Ou Family, to enjoy themselves. 
So, that was the reason Xiaobao ended up there. 
Once inside the building, she immediately dialed a number, "Secretary Gao, this is An Ning. Have you arranged to have the notebook delivered like you mentioned before?" 
"Not yet, didn’t you prefer not to go?" 
Ye Ning hurriedly explained, "I made a call back just now and asked a friend to help pick up the child. It’s better if I deliver the Third Young Master’s notebook myself." 
Secretary Gao was delighted at that news, "That’s great, I’m busy outside and can’t spare the time. You can use the Third Young Master’s car to go; he didn’t drive it back, so when you deliver the notebook, you can bring his car along too." 
He finished speaking and told her where the car keys were. 
Ye Ning couldn’t have asked for more and hung up the phone. She then dashed back to the office, grabbed the notebook and car keys, and took off. 
Xiaobao, please be safe, Mommy is coming... 
-- 
Meanwhile, inside the Blue Mountain Villa, the entire place had already become bustling with festivity due to the city leaders’ visit, cups and laughter intertwining everywhere. 
Actually, the host of the Ou Family hadn’t expected so many guests for today’s banquet. When the old Mr. Ou received a call from the mayor yesterday, he was told that the mayor would come but wasn’t informed about bringing guests. noveldrama
It was only when the time came and the security at the gate told him that a fleet of luxury cars had arrived, did he realize his Blue Mountain Villa was being used as a local business representative exhibit for those dignitaries. 
So he had to prepare again... 
"Remember to call back both the second house and the Third Young Master, especially your Third Young Master; drag him back if you have to." 
As the old Mr. Ou was changing his clothes, thinking of his two sons, he immediately charged the butler. 
The butler laughed at those orders, "Don’t worry, sir. The second master and Young Master Yu Ze have been here quite a while, and Young Master Yu Ze is already greeting guests. As for the Third Young Master, the lady has sent Xiaoxia to the company to block him. By now, he should already be in the car." 
That’s best! 
Hearing this, the old Mr. Ou finally nodded his head in satisfaction. 
"Looking at the guests who’ve come this time, quite a few have brought their daughters with them. It seems they have intentions towards our Ou Family." 
"That’s certain. Who else has the status and position of the master in our Ou Family here? Only, I wonder which young master the master would prefer they favor tonight?" 
The young masters of the Ou Family, whether it’s the grandson of the second house or the youngest son of the old master, are the men all the women in A City clamor to marry. 
But if he had to choose one to be picked tonight... 
The old man looked at himself in the mirror, seeing that he still looked vibrant after changing into new clothes, "I heard the mayor’s daughter is quite good, both in upbringing and in looks. Our Third Young Master isn’t getting any younger either; it’s time he found someone to keep him in line."
The butler understood... 
Indeed, only someone like the mayor’s daughter was a suitable match for their Third Young Master.
###Chapter 97: Chapter 97: The "Selection of Concubines" Event of Young Master Ou
Having changed into proper attire and descended from the upstairs, indeed, in the resplendently golden hall below, the guests who had arrived were already waiting there. They were dressed in elaborate finery, their faces brimming with smiles, clearly reveling in the top-tier banquet they were attending. 
The Ou Family’s Blue Mountain Villa was already the most luxurious and upscale private residence in A City. Its scale and opulence even exceeded that of many five-star hotels of the time. 
Therefore, many people took it as an honor to be able to attend a banquet at the Villa. 
The patriarch watched all of this with great satisfaction, especially when he saw that his youngest son, who usually held himself above such socializing, had also made an appearance at the banquet hall. Seeing him besieged by a bevy of girls with burning gazes, his happiness grew even stronger. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to your visit. Thanks to the city leaders for not despising my humble wine at Blue Mountain Villa, Ou is grateful to everyone," he said. 
The old fox didn’t earn his stripes for nothing. Although he had hurriedly prepared this banquet, his address was delivered with great elegance. 
As soon as he finished speaking, the hall erupted with thunderous applause, and those leaders were even more eager to raise their glasses and head in his direction. 
Bai Tingfang, watching from below, hurriedly reminded her son, "Xiaocen, did you see? Your father prepared all this for you. Take a look and decide which one you like." 
As she spoke, her eyes swept over the young women who were continuously glancing their way. 
Ou Mucen stood there already feeling out of place, and upon hearing this, his expression grew even more unsightly! 
So, was this actually a matchmaking event prepared specifically for him? 
"Mom, I’m going to change my clothes," he said. 
"..." noveldrama
This brat, at this hour, change what clothes? Didn’t he see that the son of the second branch, that guy named Ou Yuze, had already taken the initiative to chat with those girls? 
Bai Tingfang was about to grab hold of her son, but before she could turn around, the wives of those political dignitaries had already surrounded her, "Mrs. Ou, it’s been a long time." 
Bai Tingfang looked around and reluctantly turned back, "Mrs. Lin, it has been a long time indeed." 
"Isn’t it? I still remember the last time we met was over the New Year, and by the way, the Third Young Master, he is..." 
"No problem at all, he’s just going out to change his clothes. He’ll be right back!" she quickly interjected. 
"That’s good, that’s good..." 
In the Ou Family, many people knew that the true power lay with the youngest son. Not only was he the apple of the patriarch’s eye, but he also wielded real power. Though he was more than twenty years younger than his older brother, the shares and assets he controlled were not less in any measure. 
More importantly, he wasn’t just some prodigal son, only knowing how to indulge in pleasure. His savvy and strategies were such that even his father might not surpass him. 
Hence, at this banquet, the political dignitaries who brought their daughters were mostly eyeing this Third Young Master. As for the son of the second branch, it was only the girls from average families who approached him. 
"Husband, do you see? They are all just eyeing your brother. Our son, they don’t even give him a glance," Mei Liping fumed, her face turning green with envy. 
Ou Muyuan saw all this and shot a glare at his son, who was still holding a wine glass and lingering with a woman named Yang Xueshan, "Yu Ze, come here!"
###Chapter 98: Chapter 98 Conspiracy
Ou Yuze was also in a bad mood. He had always held a high position in the Ou Family, but for some reason, every time that little cousin returned, he would instantly fall from the sky to the ground. Everyone’s attention would be on that person and no longer on him. 
Was he really that much worse? 
Ou Yuze darkened his expression and said,"What’s going on?" 
"Why are you always standing here? Didn’t you realize this is the marriage-introduction banquet your grandfather arranged for you and your uncle? I’m telling you, the girls here today are all daughters of influential figures in this city. You’d better seize the opportunity. Otherwise, if your uncle beats you to it, it’ll be troublesome." 
As soon as Ou Muyuan saw him, he began to lecture. 
Upon hearing this, Ou Yuze grew even more upset: "Dad, is this marriage-introduction banquet really arranged for me? Haven’t you seen all those women flocking to Ou Mucen? I’m telling you, as long as he is here, in the Ou Family, there will only be him, not your son!" 
"You—" 
"All right, all right, no more arguing. It’s just the mayor’s daughter, isn’t it? We’ll just find a way to make Ou Mucen embarrass himself in front of her." 
With one sentence, both father and son turned their gaze to the woman beside them. 
"Mom, what do you mean...?" 
"I heard that tonight, to welcome these political elites, there will be some performances prepared, one of which involves the children from the city’s kindergarten. Yu Ze, you go there, find a child, and no matter what method you use, make sure that during the public performance, he must call Ou Mucen... Daddy!" 
Ou Yuze: "... 
Ou Muyuan’s mouth gaped open, his face filled with excitement as he looked at his wife. 
Yes, only by revealing that he had an illegitimate child would it affect his reputation, whether true or false. And those who wanted to marry him would naturally not give him a second glance anymore. 
Ou Yuze finally smiled, set down his glass, and left the hall. 
-- 
Twenty minutes later, Ye Ning finally drove to Blue Mountain Villa. 
Upon her arrival, she saw the familiar villa from her car and the landscape that hadn’t changed much around it, and her heart suddenly skipped a beat. Her fingers gripping the steering wheel turned faintly pale. 
It was indeed the place she never wanted to see again; whether the place itself or that house, she did not want to lay eyes on any of it. 
Yet today, for her child, she had no choice but to step inside once more. 
Sitting in the car, she took several deep breaths before parking the car and picking up the notebook she had brought. 
"Hello, I’m the Third Young Master’s assistant; he asked me to deliver this laptop." 
"The Third Young Master’s assistant?" 
The security guard in the guardhouse at the gate wasn’t the same one as last year. Seeing Ye Ning approach, he surveyed her from head to toe. 
This girl’s clothes were indeed from the young master’s company, and so was the car she drove. 
So, he opened the gate and came out, "Give it to me; I’ll deliver it to the Third Young Master." 
In Blue Mountain Villa, if one was neither a host nor a familiar visitor, they could not enter, even if it was someone from the company—without the host’s permission, the security would not let them in. 
Remembering this rule, Ye Ning’s hands carrying the notebook immediately shrank back, "There are some documents I need to discuss personally with the Third Young Master. He’s aware of this." 
Security guard: "... 
Staring at her for a long time, he finally stepped aside, "Then hurry up, you can’t stay here without an invitation." noveldrama
"Understood, I know!"
###Chapter 99: Chapter 99 Intelligence is Crushed Like This 1
Ye Ning finally came in, carrying a notebook. 
Upon entering, the first thing she saw was the classic music fountain at the entrance of the villa. It was just like it had been five years ago. When the music started, dozens of beads of water surged out, some high, some low, some in straight lines, some spinning, changing with the frequency of the music. It looked very beautiful. 
Ye Ning tightened her grip on her finger and quickly passed by this place, heading inside. 
Usually at Blue Mountain Villa, when the music fountain started, it meant that very important guests had arrived at the villa, and the event was quite elaborate. Otherwise, the fountain was seldom activated. 
As she walked on, she hadn’t yet reached the main building when she could already see many people in the garden outside, holding wine glasses and chatting. They were in groups of three or two, seemingly enjoying this rare opulent moment. 
Seeing this, she approached with her notebook and asked, "Excuse me, is this where the city leaders are being received?" 
"Who are you?" 
"Oh, sorry, I’m a teacher from the kindergarten. I received a call to deliver a CD for the children’s performance," Ye Ning said, quickly tearing off the Ou Group LOGO hanging from her uniform. 
She couldn’t go to find Ou Mucen now. She needed to find Xiaobao first. Only after finding him could she hurry to take him away from here. 
Luckily, the villa waiter carrying the tray knew about this and pointed towards a villa, saying, "They should be over there. Those programs are arranged by external staff, nothing to do with our villa. You can go check there." 
Ye Ning quickly thanked him and headed towards that villa with her notebook. 
If the layout of the place was still the same, that villa should be where the Ou family’s eldest daughter lived before she got married. After her marriage, the villa became vacant, inhabited only when they returned. 
It seemed the waiter was right. That villa was the only one likely to be vacant at this time. 
Thinking this, she hurried her steps. But just as she was about to reach the villa, she saw a figure also hurrying towards it. As soon as she caught sight of the man’s face and stature, she stopped in her tracks! 
It was a man she wished to crush to ashes in her dreams! 
He was dressed in a perfectly tailored beige suit that made him look very gentlemanly. The snow-white shirt underneath, adorned with a delicate dark-red bow tie, made his handsome face stand out, indicating he was from a wealthy family. 
But who knew what kind of ugly disguise hid beneath that smooth exterior? Who knew how revolting a person he was? noveldrama
Ou Yuze!! 
Ye Ning sneered, her icy gaze wishing to freeze the man instantly. 
Why was he here during the banquet? 
Thinking about her son, who might be inside, a wave of anxiety suddenly rose within her. 
- 
Meanwhile, Ou Yuze, who was walking ahead, was completely unaware of the additional pair of eyes behind him. Reaching the villa and hearing what seemed like children’s voices inside, he let a cold smile curl his lips and stepped up. 
"Yo, if it isn’t Young Master Ou. What brings you here?" 
"I heard at the banquet hall that there was a performance today, and moreover, it was a group of children, so I brought some things over to see them."
###Chapter 100: Chapter 100: How Intelligence Gets Crushed 2
The man with a beaming smile seemed harmless enough, especially after he lifted the basket full of fruit platters and pastries he had brought. The kindergarten teacher guarding the door immediately trusted him completely. 
Yes, it was so late already, and those children in the hall had long been tired and thirsty. His arrival at this time was indeed like sending charcoal in snowy weather. 
So, the teacher quickly stood up and took him inside. 
Inside the hall, sure enough, some of the children who had been selected to perform from several kindergartens in the city were all there. But perhaps because it was too late, the children no longer had any spark of energy and were just sitting there, chatting with their little friends. 
When the teacher saw this, she hurried over, "Kids, this is Uncle Ou. Seeing that you are all tired and thirsty, he especially brought some tasty treats for you. Do you like them?" noveldrama
"We like them!" 
As soon as these words were spoken, the children’s eyes finally lit up, seeing the large basket in the young uncle’s hand. Instantly, like a group of little swallows that had been hungry and thirsty for a long time, they all ran towards him. 
The kindergarten teacher, seeing this, felt somewhat embarrassed. 
But the young man surrounded by children, upon seeing them rushing towards him, his eagle-like eyes began to search among these small figures for the most suitable candidate. 
These children should all be from the senior class of the kindergarten, about five or six years old. Only one, the little boy who saw the food in his hand and seemed to have no reaction, was still sitting in his chair. 
Why isn’t he moving? Is it because he’s too small? 
He noticed that the boy was a full head shorter than all the others. Instantly, his heart leapt with joy. "Why isn’t he coming over to eat? Is he too small? Starving?" 
The kindergarten teacher quickly glanced over, "Yes, his name is Ye Xiaobao. He’s only four years old, the youngest of the group. He just arrived; I heard one of the children in their kindergarten suddenly fell ill, and he was brought in as a last-minute replacement. It’s okay; I’ll go and soothe him." 
As she spoke, she quickly went over to the chair. 
This little boy actually looked very pretty and cute, with his chubby cheeks and eyes as dark and sparkling as stars in the sky, resembling a porcelain doll in every aspect. 
But, why was his reaction so slow? Could it really be because he’s too young? Missing his mom? 
The kindergarten teacher approached, and seeing him sitting motionless, she felt a pang of sympathy. "Xiaobao, why aren’t you going to get something to eat? Are you missing mommy? Don’t worry, as soon as the performance is over, the teacher will take you back home." 
Her tone treated him as if he were an infant who hadn’t yet been weaned. 
Ye Xiaobao furrowed his brows as he looked at her, his taut little face clearly reflecting his unhappy mood at the moment. 
Indeed, he was upset, but not because he missed his mom; he was worried about her. What would she do when she got home and found out he had come to this godforsaken place? She had no car, had never been here before; would she be frantic? 
"Xiaobao? You’re Xiaobao, right?" 
Sitting there with a troubled heart, another person approached him, and this person was the one who had just brought food for the other children. 
Ye Xiaobao blinked his beautiful eyes, and after hesitating for a moment, he nodded, "Mhm, I’m Ye Xiaobao."
###Chapter 101: Chapter 101: This is How IQ Gets Crushed! 3
"Xiaobao, why aren’t you eating? Aren’t you hungry?" 
"Not hungry!" noveldrama
Ye Xiaobao didn’t like to talk to strangers, especially when they were unfamiliar. 
Ou Yuze could tell, so his expression quickly became impatient. He took out his phone, found a picture, and placed it in front of Xiaobao. "Xiaobao, how about we play a game? As long as you spot this person during the performance and call out ’Daddy’ to him, I’ll take you home right away." 
Ye Xiaobao blinked and took a while before he looked at the phone. 
It was a photo of a very handsome, young uncle who was much better looking than the man in front of him. 
More importantly, the uncle’s cool, aloof demeanor was very familiar to him. 
Now this man wanted him to call him ’Daddy,’ what did that mean?
Ye Xiaobao looked back at the man squatting in front of him. "Uncle, who is he?" 
"He is..." 
Ou Yuze had no clue that the little Baozi in front of him already knew the person in the photo on his phone. Hesitating for a moment, he then said, "He’s my uncle." 
"Your uncle? Then why does he look as young as you and even more handsome?" 
Ye Xiaobao was brutally honest, implying he was young and even suggesting he was more attractive. 
Ou Yuze’s face turned sour instantly. He put away his phone, and his tone wasn’t as nice as before. "Will you call him or not?" 
"But I already have a daddy..." 
"You can name any condition you want, just complete this game during the performance." 
Like this... 
Ye Xiaobao thought of the coveted limited edition fighter model he had longed for and finally agreed. 
Tyrannical uncle, so your terrible temper is because you have no good people around you, huh. 
Ye Xiaobao watched the bad uncle leave, then got off the chair and started walking out with his tiny arms and short legs. 
"Eh? Xiaobao, where are you going?" 
"Teacher, I’m going to pee." The plump little figure ran swiftly and soon disappeared into the hall. 
-- 
Outside, Ye Ning finally waited for that scumbag to leave, then she hurriedly went inside. "Teacher, do you have a child here named Ye Xiaobao?" 
Ye Xiaobao? 
The teacher immediately looked up. "You are...?" 
"I’m his mother, I’ve come to pick him up." 
"..." 
After a moment of stun, the teacher blankly started to search among the children. "He seems to have gone to the bathroom." 
The bathroom? 
Ye Ning immediately rushed to the first-floor restroom of the villa. 
But what chilled her to the bone was that the restroom was empty, no one was there. 
Where is he? 
Where did he go? 
She started to panic, and her complexion turned particularly pale. Just as she was about to check the other restrooms, her phone rang... 
"Hello?" 
"An Ning, where did you deliver the notebook? Why hasn’t the Third Young Master received it yet?" 
It was Secretary Gao, hurrying her! 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning, who was already frustrated, became even more flustered. "I’ve already arrived, I’ll deliver it right away..." 
"Alright, make it quick, the Third Young Master is in..." Before Secretary Gao could tell her the location of the president’s residence, the line had been cut off. 
What’s going on? Doesn’t she need to know where he is? Why would she hang up on him so quickly? Does she know that Blue Mountain Villa is very complicated, and the Third Young Master’s living quarters are even more so? 
Secretary Gao was completely flabbergasted!
###Chapter 102: Chapter 102 She Burst into His Room...1
But what he didn’t know was that Ye Ning, who had just hung up the phone, had taken the laptop and headed straight out of the villa here, going in the direction of the Orchid Garden. 
It turns out that within Blue Mountain Villa, besides the main hall and the large garden, there are four separate small gardens where the hosts live, named after plum, orchid, chrysanthemum, and bamboo. 
"Plum" is the very villa Ye Ning just came from, where the eldest daughter of the Ou Family lived before she left home. 
"Bamboo", of course, belongs to the old master, who has always loved bamboo; the small courtyard is full of the swaying shadows of bamboo. 
As for "Orchid" and "Chrysanthemum"! 
Well, needless to say, within the entire Blue Mountain Villa, "Orchid" has the best scenery, the largest area, and the most luxurious villa. Naturally, it had to be given to the old master’s youngest son, who was so cherished that he was nearly spoiled rotten—that was his darling boy. noveldrama
For this reason, Muyuan, the second son who had already started his own family and whose son had reached adulthood, hated his younger brother even more. 
Why should Ou Mucen, by himself, live in such a large garden and house, while his family of three had to squeeze into Chrysanthemum Garden? 
Ye Ning arrived following a familiar path, her mind already somewhat in disarray out of concern for her son, not once recalling her new identity, not remembering she should not be familiar with this place. 
Coming all the way here, she saw the tranquil and graceful garden ahead, bathed in the night, and naturally quickened her pace until she stood before it.
Password: 545653 
She quickly typed in the password for the intricately carved gate of the garden and entered with the laptop in hand. 
There were many rules in Orchid Garden, as the person living there had a mania for cleanliness. Upon entering, one must not only remove their shoes and wear the special shoe covers provided but also pass through a disinfection booth to sanitize before entering. 
This insane second-generation heir! 
While disinfecting, Ye Ning hadn’t come to her senses and was in her mind cursing the craziness of the heir while also thinking about how to find her son. 
After disinfection, she finally entered and saw no one in the hall, so she went upstairs out of habit. 
"Young Master, are you upstairs?" she called out while looking at the grey and white door on the second floor. 
No one answered. The half-open room, from which only soft music could be heard, offered no response to her calls. 
With the music playing, it seemed he must be inside. 
Hearing this, she hastened her pace, climbing the stairs with the laptop. 
Reaching the room’s door, she pushed it open. Indeed, in the astoundingly spacious room where all the lights were on, there was a CD player smoothly emitting music that was comfortable and soothing... 
Scarborough Fair 
Are you going to Scarborough Market? 
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme, 
... 
It was actually Sarah Brightman’s "Scarborough Fair"! 
Ye Ning couldn’t help but stand there mesmerized by the music... 
It was just at this moment that, in the room, the bathroom door, unnoticed until now for its lack of movement, suddenly had a cessation of water sounds, and not long after, the door was unlocked and opened from the inside. 
"Why are you here?" 
"..." 
The man who walked out, his hair still dripping, stood there as the drops fell along his narrow eyes and brows, twisted by his collarbones, and unwillingly slid down. It was a dangerously seductive charm that suffocated the soul.
###Chapter 103: Chapter 141: He Comes at Me with a Kiss Like a Tidal Wave!
"Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen?" 
Screech— 
The sedan, speeding along, suddenly and without warning, came to a halt, and accompanying this abrupt stop, the car’s tires screeched sharply against the tarred road. 
Ye Ning was standing there when suddenly, jolted by the stop, she lost her balance and fell forward: "Ah—" 
That’s it, my face is ruined! 
Despair washed over Ye Ning as she thought she was doomed, but then, out of the blue, a pair of strong wrists reached out from the side, with just a pull, diverted her head and upper body that were about to crash into the dashboard away. 
After that, she felt herself falling into a scalding yet soft place, and opening her eyes, she looked up to find herself facing a face looming overhead. 
It was a face of unparalleled beauty, with a noble aura akin to that of a Deity, elegant and graceful, and features as exquisite as a sculpture. Under the cascading light from above, it shimmered like the stars in the night sky, the proud lips, the flawless eyes, as if he were God’s most outstanding creation, suddenly appearing above her head without any forewarning. 
Apart from his eyes, his eyes seemed somewhat off at the moment!
Ye Ning didn’t dare to move, her mouth agape, she stared blankly at the man who had pulled her over, losing even the most basic reaction: "Ou... Ou Mucen..." 
"..." 
No one answered her. The man who held her in his arms had eyes completely overtaken by a dark red hue, staring at her as if he had found a prey he had long yearned for. Seeing her slight struggle, suddenly, his eyes narrowed, and he forcefully brought her small head closer and kissed her little mouth fiercely without hesitation! 
Oh my God!! 
Ye Ning was thunderstruck!! noveldrama
What was that feeling? 
It was as if suddenly, a thunderbolt exploded inside her head, her gaze locked on the handsome face that had massively zoomed in, and for a moment, all her thoughts turned blank, and her eyes opened to their utmost extent in an instant. 
What is he doing? 
What in the world is he doing? 
Ye Ning was utterly dumbfounded, even forgetting the most basic resistance, forgotten completely. 
Crazy, this must be madness!! 
Overwhelmed by such craziness, Ye Ning began to struggle to breathe and started to wrestle: "Ou Mucen, let me go..." 
But at this moment, how could this man, completely consumed by desire and having lost his reason, let her go? 
In his frenzied plundering, he smelled the faint scent of lime, and in a trance, he returned to that night five years ago, to that moment on that night. 
"Today... you’re not going to escape..." 
"..." 
Ye Ning continued to struggle, feeling his hand start to intrude ruthlessly under her thin T-shirt, her whole body trembling: "Ou Mucen, you bastard, let me go... let go."
###Chapter 104: Chapter 103 She burst into his room...2
It truly was a life-threatening moment. 
Ye Ning shifted her gaze slightly away, but when she saw his body, she found it even harder to breathe. 
His strong and naked body was fully exposed, his skin a bronze color. He had just come out of the bathroom, still dripping with water that hadn’t dried yet, and under the light, his bronzed and sexy abdominal muscles were emitting a breathtaking glow! 
And below, he had wrapped a bath towel around himself, 
but perhaps because this was his room, the towel was tied very loosely, hanging as if merely placed atop him. From her angle, she could see the curve between the man’s thigh and groin that made one’s face flush with heartbeat... 
"Have you seen enough?" 
Ou Mucen grew annoyed when he saw this woman staring at him, and snatched another towel to wrap around himself. 
Damn it! 
How could she be here? Who allowed her to come? 
Ye Ning wished she could find a hole to crawl into. It was at this moment that she finally came to her senses. 
Cupping her head and turning around, her face was as red as a drop of blood, "I... I came to deliver the notebook, Secretary Gao asked me to come." 
"And who allowed you in?" 
"Gao... Secretary Gao, he asked me to come." 
Right, just blame it all on Secretary Gao, only he could save her now. 
My goodness, how did she get here! noveldrama
Ye Ning wanted to slap herself! 
Fortunately, after hearing that it was his own secretary who had her come, the man behind her lost some of his murderous aura. He stretched out his hand to take the notebook from her and then went over there: "Get out!" 
Sure thing! 
Ye Ning wished for nothing more, holding her face that felt hot enough to catch fire, she quickly pulled open the door. 
However, just as she was about to leave, footsteps suddenly came from downstairs: "You said the young master has been upstairs all this time?" 
"Yes, Madam. The young master hasn’t come down since he returned here." 
"This is too much. How can this child be so thoughtless? Doesn’t he know that everything today was prepared for him?" 
After speaking, only the sound of high heels "clacking" could be heard as she ascended the stairs. 
My God! 
It’s Bai Tingfang!!! 
Ye Ning was stunned when she saw this, quickly turning around, she realized that the man who had just opened the notebook inside was also full of surprise. 
"Mucen..." 
"Aren’t you coming over quickly? I warn you, if you are found, I’ll strangle you in a minute!" 
He carelessly pointed to the bathroom he had just exited, his gaze truly murderous. 
It wasn’t his fault; what woman had ever come up to Ou Family’s Third Young Master’s room? 
No, his entire villa rarely had women visit, except for the house cleaner. 
But now, this woman had appeared, and under such circumstances, could he explain himself?!! 
Ye Ning understood the situation as well, so she shivered a little, didn’t dare to talk back, closed the door quickly, and hurriedly ran into the bathroom. 
Right, this moment called for hiding. She must not let Bai Tingfang discover her. That woman was very strict with her son. If she saw her here, she might dig up her ancestors eighteen generations deep. 
So once in the bathroom, she dared not breathe too loudly, and just pricked up her ears to listen to the noises outside. 
"Xiaocen, what exactly are you doing? Does changing clothes take this long?" 
Just after she had hidden well into the bathroom, the sound of high heels pushed the door open, with a heavy tone indicating the person was quite displeased.
###Chapter 105: Chapter 104 She burst into his room...3
Ou Mucen rose from his chair and, without looking at his mother, went straight to blow-dry his hair, "Mom, with so many people downstairs, why must it be me who goes? Aren’t Dad and my second brother there good enough?" 
"You!!" 
Bai Tingfang felt she was about to die of frustration with her son, "Are you really foolish or pretending to be? Can’t you tell that this was all arranged by your father? Look how pleased he is with the mayor’s daughter." noveldrama
"..." 
So it turned out that today’s banquet at Blue Mountain Villa was a matchmaking event set up for him. 
Ye Ning, who remained in the bathroom, thought of the bustling banquet hall she had seen earlier and couldn’t help but twitch the corners of her mouth. 
The third young master of the Ou Family, also faced with a forced marriage? 
Ou Mucen hadn’t expected his mother to bring this up, and as soon as she finished speaking, a stifled chuckle seemed to travel over from the bathroom. Instantly, he felt embarrassed, "If he’s pleased, let him marry her, what’s that got to do with me?" 
"You little brat, what kind of talk is that? What do you mean ’let your father marry’? Are you trying to kill me?" 
"I’m not trying to anger you, I just don’t understand why you think the mayor’s daughter is worthy of your son?" 
As the words fell, the room went completely silent. 
Damn! 
Those words were powerful and arrogant! 
Yes, that’s the scion of the Ou Family for you; haughty and arrogant, too high and mighty for anyone. Is he someone that just anyone could match with? 
Ye Ning couldn’t help herself in the bathroom and let out a "Pfft." 
At the sound, Bai Tingfang, who had been about to leave, stopped in her tracks, "Who’s that? Who’s laughing?" 
Ou Mucen’s expression changed slightly, and he shot a fierce glare at the bathroom, quickly denying, "Nobody, what did you hear?" 
"Laughter, didn’t you just hear it?" 
"No, you must have drunk too much, Mom, you’re having hallucinations. Look, your face is all red." While speaking, he tried to usher his mother out. 
But Bai Tingfang suddenly started sniffing the air intently, "No, there’s a different fragrance in your room, not your LK scent, it smells like lime, yes, lime!" 
Before she could finish her sentence, she had already pushed past her son and started searching all over the room, "Ou Mucen, I’m telling you, if I find out you’re skipping the banquet because you’re hiding a woman in here, I will beat you to death!" 
Ou Mucen: "..."
He watched her rummaging through his room like a thief, and for the first time, the fearless third young master of the Ou Family felt an insane irritation. 
"Mom, I told you there’s no woman!" 
"Ghost believes that, your room never smells this light and exquisite. If this isn’t a girl’s scent, then I’ll eat my words!" After speaking, Bai Tingfang, her face ashen, flung open the walk-in closet. 
Seeing her determination, Ou Mucen knew she wouldn’t spare the bathroom either. So while she was busy overturning the walk-in closet, he decisively opened the bathroom and dragged out the woman who had already been too frightened to stand steadily! 
"Three..." 
"You listen to me clearly, if she finds out today, you’re to get the hell out of the Ou Corporation immediately!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
But what does this have to do with her? She was just here to deliver a computer..., 
But there was no time to explain, as the noises from the walk-in closet had ceased. So she hurried to the door, ready to take this opportunity to leave.
###Chapter 106: Chapter 105: The Perilous Hiding Place
But how fast the actions of Madam Ou were! Ye Ning hadn’t even made it two steps before the high heel was already out, and the man standing behind her, upon seeing it, grabbed her by the collar and stuffed her under the bed! 
Damn! 
Ye Ning felt so roughly handled that she was nearly in tears from the pain. 
But this man? 
Far from being understanding, after he stuffed her under the bed, he menacingly threatened right into her ear, "If you get caught, you are dead meat!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Bai Tingfang had already come out, saw her son standing beside the bed and, of course, headed directly towards the bathroom: "You little rascal, don’t let me catch you!" 
Ou Mucen casually lit a cigarette, his expression the epitome of calm: "As you please..." 
After saying that, he went over to his desk and continued with his laptop. 
Seeing this, Bai Tingfang had no choice but to keep searching, from the bathroom to the compartments, then from the compartments to the balcony. 
My goodness, she truly didn’t overlook even a single trash can! 
Ye Ning, hiding under the bed and witnessing this scene, was absolutely astounded! 
She was a human, not an ; even if she had to hide, she couldn’t possibly hide in a trash can. 
That’s not right! 
She suddenly realized a problem—if this mom could rummage through a trash can, then... under the bed... 
"Nothing? Impossible, how could there be nothing? I clearly smelled that scent, right, I haven’t checked under the bed yet." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
After being in a daze for a full three seconds, Ou Mucen, who had been sitting at his desk, finally snapped back to reality. Then, with the speed of an arrow, he rushed over from the desk, yanking out the woman he had just stuffed under the bed. 
"Xiaocen, what are you doing?" 
"Nothing... I’m not doing anything," the man finally started to panic. Seeing his mother about to come in from the balcony, and with no escape, he ended up tossing her onto his bed. 
Done for, afraid of his mother finding out, he lay down as well! 
So, at this moment, Ye Ning, just dragged out from under the bed, saw the world whirl around before her eyes went dark once more; and this time, to make things worse, it felt like something was pressing down on her back, pinning her firmly to the bed. 
Was he trying to suffocate her? 
Feeling extremely uncomfortable, she began trying to push off whatever it was with her small hands. noveldrama
Mother of mine, she was being suffocated! 
But what she hadn’t expected was that, with her pull, which should have been inconsequential, the man pinning her down suddenly shuddered violently and began swearing through gritted teeth from above: "I’m going to kill you!" 
Bai Tingfang immediately entered: "Son, what did you say?" 
The man with a fierce expression instantly regained his composure: "Nothing, I was just having a WeChat with Secretary Gao, he messed something up." 
Oh! 
It was Secretary Gao. 
Bai Tingfang dismissed her doubts and her gaze fell onto his bed: "Why have you gone to bed? The party isn’t over yet." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
He really was going to kill her, would she let go or not?!! 
"Alright, alright, I’ll come down in a minute, you go ahead." 
"Will you really come down?" 
"I will, I will, I’ll be right there!" Ou Mucen truly wished he could send his mother away this instant, because he realized that he... was at his breaking point!!
###Chapter 107: Chapter 106: How Does It Feel?
Fortunately, once Bai Tingfang heard her son was finally willing to go down, she didn’t make any more fuss and, after casting a suspicious glance at the excessively high pile of blankets on her son, she left the room. 
No sooner had she left than the room exploded into chaos! 
The first thing was the furious man who, after throwing the book he was holding, stretched out his hand and flung off the blankets covering him. 
At that moment, Ye Ning, who had been suffocating underneath, finally found liberation. After a burst of brightness before her eyes, she gulped down fresh air greedily. 
Being alive felt so good! 
However, her enjoyment didn’t last even ten seconds before she suddenly sensed something was amiss. It was as if everything around her had frozen in time, and the whole room was filled with a terrifying silence. 
What had happened? 
She finally slowly lifted her head and looked ahead, only to see a man with his upper body bare reclining in front of her. 
This man was incredibly handsome, with features as if sculpted, every line an impeccable curve. However, his eyes... 
Ye Ning suddenly shuddered! 
" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Suddenly, it was like something exploded in her brain. After a loud buzzing, she quickly looked at her hands that were clasped over her chest!! 
It was a sight she would never forget! 
She had not noticed when she was thrown in that it wasn’t just blankets pressing down on her. Only now did she realize that it wasn’t blankets at all, but a pair of man’s feet. 
Those feet, bent at an angle, were pressing her into the blankets, but she, struggling for breath, desperately wrestled beneath them. As a result of her struggle... 
"Ah—" noveldrama
Ye Ning swore it was the loudest scream she had ever made in her life. 
It was like she had received a huge shock, that scream almost abnormal. 
My god, what on earth had she just done? 
Ye Ning wished she could slap herself twice, quickly released the scorching in her hand, and attempted to make a run for it. 
But at that moment, Ou Mucen, after hearing her loud scream, worried that his mother who had just gone downstairs and probably hadn’t yet left the yard would discover them, threw a pillow at her. Without further ado, he covered her face and pressed her down again, "Do you want to die, screaming so loudly!" 
Ye Ning: "Mmm mmm..." 
She didn’t want to die, she just wanted to get away from here! 
Ou Mucen, not even looking at her and seeing that she dared to struggle, was driven almost mad, pressing her down even more forcefully. 
So at that moment, with one trying to escape and the other trying to restrain, the whole bed was shaking violently—the noise was truly... 
"Xiaoxia, did you hear any noise?" 
Xiaoxia immediately turned and looked back toward the yard they had just left... 
Young master, how am I supposed to answer Madam now? Should I say there was a noise? Or that there wasn’t? 
"Madam, this..." 
"There definitely was. No, I must go back and check again." Having said this, the woman who had just come out of that courtyard immediately turned back. 
Anxious Xiaoxia... 
Could only wail from behind, "Third Young Master, Madam is coming back..." 
"..."
###Chapter 108: Chapter 107: Try Moving Again?
Bai Tingfang returned to her son’s room once again and, by then, the commotion inside had basically subsided. When she pushed the door open, what she saw was still her son lying on the bed. 
The difference was that, when she had left earlier, he had been lying under the covers with his feet arched and half-leaning against the headboard reading a book, but now, he had shifted to lying prone under the covers, with his whole body turned away, and was crawling there, writing something. 
"Xiaocen, you..." 
"Huh? Mom, why did you come back again? Didn’t I say I would be there? I’ll be done with this bit in just a moment." 
The man who was lying under the covers was surprised to see his room door opened again. 
Bai Tingfang frowned, wanting to say something, but upon seeing that the room’s floor and furnishings were still spotless, she could only retract her gaze with a snort of discontent, "It’s nothing, I just came to hurry you along. Since it’s like this, then be quick about it." 
Ou Mucen nodded, "Understood, right away!" 
He had never been so obedient, and if not for today’s incident, he probably never would have been this docile in his life. 
Bai Tingfang was satisfied and finally left again. 
Xiaoxia followed behind and quickly closed the door after her; of course, she did not forget to glance at the foot of the bed when closing the door. 
Those were several round and delicate toes, which at that moment, were pointing upwards. 
The young master was indeed capable, lying prone yet with toes pointed upwards. 
Xiaoxia revealed a meaningful smile and walked away... 
Once she was gone, indeed, the room started to move again, only this time, the noise was much less, but essentially, the tone and the physical movements were still extremely passionate and unbearable to watch. 
"Ou Mucen, you scumbag... get up quickly..." 
That was the muffled, stifled low curse coming from under the covers, carrying a woman’s shame and exasperation, and utter intolerance. 
She couldn’t take it anymore? 
Ou Mucen lay there, feeling the soft body wriggling beneath him, and the heat in him rose once more, his complexion turning even paler, "Try moving again?" 
At that command, the woman lying on top of her dared not move any longer, and even her hands stopped flailing around and obediently rested at her sides. 
He was no gentleman; although a person like her could not catch his eye, he was still a normal man, and at this moment, pressing down on a fully matured woman’s body, he truly couldn’t guarantee anything. 
Besides, considering how he felt underneath him right now, the woman’s figure wasn’t bad at all. 
My God! 
How did things end up like this today? 
Her face was so red it seemed as though blood might drip from it; she tightly closed her eyes and didn’t dare to speak further, just waiting for him to get up from on top of her so she could quickly leave. 
But she lay there for a long time, not feeling him disentangling the towel that had gotten caught in the clothes zipper during their struggle; so she started to grow anxious, "Are you done yet? I... I can’t take this anymore." 
Couldn’t take it anymore?noveldrama
What couldn’t she take any longer? 
The man who was bending over in the dimness under the covers to untangle the towel, upon hearing these suggestive words, directed his gaze, which already bore the wish to strangle her, onto her once again.
###Chapter 109: Chapter 108 What is it?
That was also a sight that made his breathing heavier! 
It must have been during their scuffle just now that he unintentionally tore off the buttons of her clothes. Now, upon glancing over, from the neckline to the second button, it was all undone, exposing a large expanse of snow-white skin covered only by a black bra, and not a modest amount either. 
His eyes darkened, and unnaturally, his throat became even drier. 
"Are you done yet? If you’re not, let me do it," Ye Ning still hadn’t noticed any of this; she was still eager to get free. 
She really had never encountered such an embarrassing moment before. Although she had already given birth to a child, she was really unfamiliar with men. That night, the man who took her innocence didn’t leave her with any impression. 
Fortunately, at this moment, the man seemed to have lost his patience. So, with a casual yank, he actually pulled down the entire bath towel off himself! 
"You shut your eyes for me and only lift the blanket when I say it’s okay. Do you understand?" noveldrama
Ye Ning’s face blushed to the point where it seemed it might drip blood... 
Of course, she wouldn’t look. Even if he paid her, she wouldn’t. 
Ye Ning covered her eyes firmly, and at the same time, she buried herself deep into the blankets. 
There was a faint scent of shower gel, which seemed to be coming from the towel. 
She immediately recoiled as if shocked and kicked the towel aside with the zipper open. 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, after getting off the bed, had also immediately headed for the walk-in wardrobe to rinse and grab a bath towel before diving into the bathroom. 
Damn it! 
He guessed he would need about ten minutes in the shower... 
Ye Ning had no idea what the man outside was doing. Hearing the sound of water, she wanted to come out and see, but she was afraid of seeing something she shouldn’t, so she could only hide under the covers. 
Only after ten minutes, when the man’s internal restlessness had finally subsided, did she hear a "click," followed by his cold voice, "Aren’t you going to scram? Do I need to carry you out?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
After a long moment, she hesitantly lifted the blanket off herself and began to look around the room. 
So he had gone to take another shower! 
It made sense, someone with his cleanliness wouldn’t want to go without a shower after coming into such close contact with her, right? 
Understanding this, Ye Ning didn’t think too much of it and began to get out of the blankets to leave. 
But just as she got off the bed, she saw something being thrown at her from the opposite side. She caught it with her hands, only to realise it was another towel. 
And it was wet!! 
"Young Master..." 
"Have you no shame? Is this how a woman acts when her husband has just died?" 
What? 
Ye Ning was utterly confused by these harsh and malicious words. 
What did he mean by no shame? What had she done? 
It wasn’t until the cold towel suddenly touched the large expanse of skin on her chest that she looked down and screamed in alarm, clutching her chest: "Ah—"
Oh my God! 
How could this have happened? 
When did she lose her buttons? Why didn’t this bastard tell her? 
Once again, out of shyness and anger, Ye Ning "whooshed" back under the blankets and cried out, "Where’s my button? You find it for me, quick?"
###Chapter 110: Chapter 109 Is he a beast?
A button? 
She still had the nerve to ask him for a button? 
The man was already furious beyond words and didn’t even glance at her as he went to change his clothes in the dressing room, "I warn you, if you don’t leave here within five minutes, I’ll throw you out of this building!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
This jerk, does he really have to be like this? Does he think she doesn’t want to leave? She was also desperate to get out of here, wasn’t she? 
But, these damn clothes!! 
She glared fiercely at the man, and once she saw him enter the dressing room, she didn’t make another sound, only faintly hearing the noise of closet doors being opened.
It seemed she really had to find a way out, otherwise, knowing his character, she was aware he meant what he said and would do it. 
So, she looked down at the burst open front of her blouse, hesitated for a long moment, and then decisively got out of bed and ran to the bathroom over there. 
Without a mouthful of thread or a needle, the only solution was to do something with what she was wearing. Fortunately, she was wearing a two-piece suit from the company today, which gave her some options. 
Ou Mucen was also changing his clothes. It wasn’t much effort; his clothes were already set out. The garments displayed in the dressing room looked like an array of goods in a fashion store, requiring no fuss from him, just a selection. 
However, he had just put on a dark green shirt when he seemed to hear a sound from outside, like the tearing of fabric. 
Fabric? 
Remembering the woman who had disrupted his entire evening, and then thinking about the curtains and duvet covers in his room, his face changed color suddenly, and he quickly came back out, "An Ning, what are you doing?" noveldrama
Ye Ning had just managed to fix her clothing in the bathroom. Hearing someone calling from outside, she opened the door and came out, "What’s the matter? I’m fixing my clothes." 
Clothes? 
The man emerging from the dressing room had a gloomy gaze that immediately fell on her. 
Indeed, she was fixing her clothes, but why did she bind a piece of white cloth across her chest like that? It was nonsensical and even more ridiculous was that she had also neatly removed the buttons from her blazer. At a glance, what invaded his view was nothing but that snowy expanse. 
So what on earth was she trying to do? 
Was she thinking that, since her husband was dead, and today coincidentally was the grand banquet for political and social elites at Blue Mountain Villa, she would go out looking like that to hook someone? 
The man standing there narrowed his eyes instantly, a surge of anger inexplicably rising up. 
"Do all widows behave like this?" 
"What?" 
"Isn’t it true? Because you’ve lost a husband and an income, you want to climb the social ladder at any cost? Just like Miss An Ning here, lacking in charm, you try to make do by resorting to manipulation on your person, isn’t that right?" 
After speaking, he didn’t forget to point at her. 
Ye Ning was stunned! 
Was this even human? Was he a beast? Otherwise, how could he spew such bloodthirsty, venomous words? 
Finally, Ye Ning exploded with anger that had been simmering for too long. She yelled at him, "Ou Mucen, you bastard, did your mother never teach you how to behave when you were born? How can you speak like that?" 
"What did you say?!!"
###Chapter 111: Chapter 110: She Must Have Had a Grudge Against Him in a Past Life!
"What did you say? Say it again?" 
"I could say it a hundred times, ten thousand times, it’s the same. You are the most ill-mannered rich kid I’ve ever seen. So what if I, a widow, want to hook up with someone again? Have I bothered you? Does this concern you, Third Young Master of the Ou Family?!!" 
Ye Ning really went all out, half because she was indeed driven mad by him, and the other half because of the deep-seated grievances she held against him. 
Yes, this second-generation heir had already made a terrible impression on her when she was still at Blue Mountain Villa. And to make matters worse, within less than two days of her return, her life had become even more miserable than the previous two years, hadn’t it? 
After the scolding, the air seemed to freeze, as if a violent storm was about to hit, the whole room spun into a blur, indistinguishable as the blackest night that was about to arrive. 
Very good! 
This was the first time someone had dared to speak to him this way! 
The man didn’t move any closer but just stood there with his hands in his pockets, looking down from above with an impassive face, like a demon that had crawled out of hell, ready to devour her clean in the next second. 
"Manners, is it?" 
"..." 
"Alright, then I’ll show you what being truly ill-mannered means!" After speaking, the man pressed something unknown, and suddenly, a shrill alarm ring out from the villa. It happened so fast that Ye Ning barely had time to turn around before a cacophony of shocked voices started approaching from outside the window. 
"It’s Orchid Garden, where the Third Young Master lives. Everyone, hurry over and see." 
"Is there a burglar, or is there a fire?" 
"I don’t know, let’s go and find out..." 
"..." 
Once again dumbfounded, Ye Ning turned to look at the man, only to see him raise his hands and throw something out the window. He looked at her with a devilish smile, turned around, and vanished at the doorway like the most elegant of gentlemen. 
Ah! 
This damn bastard!! 
Ye Ning felt like going insane. She dashed forward, trying to stop him, but the man was so quick, and in just a few seconds, she ran out to see him already at the staircase. 
Then, she heard a crowd gathering at the entrance,"Third Young Master, what happened? We heard the alarm just now." 
"Did the villa host a lot of people today?" 
"Yes, a lot!" 
"Hmm, no wonder I thought there was something off about my villa. Search carefully, don’t let anyone steal my stuff." He tossed off the remark indifferently and then left. 
Ye Ning felt darkness closing in from the anger upstairs! 
This beast, this scum, she definitely... definitely would not let him off... 
Ah! 
Ou Mucen, I’m going to kill you!! 
Ye Ning slammed the door shut, feeling an unprecedented sense of despair. 
-- 
Meanwhile, the man left his garden and went straight to the banquet hall. Along the way, he didn’t look back even once. 
Upon reaching the banquet hall, it was evident that people were waiting for him. Seeing him approach, they hurriedly brought over their wine glasses: "Yo, Third Young Master, you finally arrived, the party is about to begin." noveldrama
There was still a party? 
He glanced at the hall in front of him, decked out like a stage, and immediately frowned: "Who arranged this?"
###Chapter 112: Chapter 111 Uncle, You Finally Came...
The person coming over to make a toast hurriedly explained, "It was arranged by the municipal government. It was originally supposed to be held at that unit over there, but somehow it ended up at your place, and we all moved here. Third Young Master, you’re not angry, are you?" 
Ou Mucen narrowed his eyes slightly and was about to speak, but at that moment, a young man wearing an off-white suit and sporting a dark red bow tie approached him from the right: "Little Uncle, you just came down?" 
It was Ou Yuze! 
Ou Mucen turned his head and looked at him indifferently: "Hmm, how is it? Did you and your parents manage to entertain all the guests today?" 
Ou Yuze’s smile was full of warmth: "We’ve taken care of everyone, but the mayor’s daughter has been asking about you, Little Uncle. Now that you’re here, you should go and keep her company." 
With that, his gaze shifted toward the front of the venue, which was already filled with people. 
Following the direction of his glance, Ou Mucen saw that, indeed, in the very front row, a young girl dressed in a pale yellow dress and wearing a sparkling headpiece had stood up and was eagerly looking over in this direction. 
"See, Little Uncle? She’s been waiting for you to come over, and Grandpa is also over there; he’s saved a seat for you." 
The young man holding the wine glass didn’t reveal what he was truly thinking; his gaze rested on the scene in front of him, but where was the real focus of his attention? Nobody knew. 
In the end, Ou Mucen went over, not because of the mayor’s daughter, but because at that moment, he saw that the old man was indeed looking in his direction. 
Forget it, it’s just the length of a few performances, he thought. He would sit through them and that would be it. noveldrama
As he approached, he indeed received a warm welcome, especially from the mayor’s daughter, who was close to clinging onto him as soon as he arrived. 
"Third Young Master, this is our Qianqian. She’s 23 this year, just graduated from university." 
23? 
Just graduated from university? 
In his mind, he involuntarily thought of another woman who was also 23. 
See, this is the difference. Others are just graduating from university at 23, while that dead woman, on the other hand, is already a widow with a child in tow. 
Thinking of the woman from earlier, his mood grew even worse. 
Indeed, his mood had been bad all along, ever since he left Orchid Garden, it had never improved. 
"Okay, okay, the show is about to start, let’s watch the performance," Bai Tingfang noticed his son’s tense face and hurriedly changed the subject. 
Seeing this, the mayor’s wife had no choice but to give up. 
It was at this time that the long-prepared performance on the stage finally began. Soon after a chorus of children’s voices drifted from behind, the audience saw a group of children running onto the stage. 
"My goodness, there are children too?" 
"Right? Why is there a performance by kids? It’s so late, where did they come from?" 
"..." 
Seeing the group of children, many in the audience started to murmur, and even Ou Mucen furrowed his brows. 
Who in the world made this arrangement? 
Has their brain been flooded with water? 
While watching, the children had begun their performance. At this moment, the whole hall was filled with their innocent voices. Those cheerful kids seemed to forget their fatigue and hunger, continuing to perform energetically. 
Yes, children are the most pure and innocent beings in this world. 
And yet, those sitting below didn’t take them seriously at all, they were nothing but privileged elites. 
Ou Mucen looked on with a touch of disdain and took out his phone: "Have you found the thief?"
###Chapter 113: Chapter 112: There’s Something Wrong with the Boy on Stage!
"No, but I saw something jump down from the third young master’s window ledge. Young master, I’m about to go see what it was." 
Jumped down from the window ledge... 
He looked at the ceiling above his head and the height of his villa came to mind; immediate disgust painted his face even grimmer. 
Jumped down? 
Good, that damned woman, better off dead if she fell! 
Lost in thought, Bai Tingfang noticed his distraction and turned to him, "Mucen, what are you thinking about?" 
"Nothing, I’m watching the program." 
Ou Mucen snapped back to reality and hurriedly turned his attention to the stage. 
By then, the group of kids had reached the climax of their dance, drawing his gaze naturally to the one playing the little duck. 
That must be the smallest child among them because the little duck was the smallest in the dance. 
"Look, that little duck is quite adorable." 
"Right, looks to be about four years old. Wonder which family’s child is raised so cute." 
"Not sure, I heard they brought him from a kindergarten." 
"..." 
The audience was charmed by the little duck and began to chat amongst themselves. 
Four years old? 
The man sitting in his seat, also watching the child, felt a sudden tug in his heart upon hearing this. For some reason, his gaze wandered to that little face. 
And with that look, he was truly surprised! 
-- 
"Little friend, which kindergarten are you from? How old are you?" noveldrama
Ye Xiaobao had finally finished performing, just like the bad uncle had said, a woman in a white dress came up to interview him immediately afterward. 
How old? 
Ye Xiaobao pulled at the little duck hat on his head that was making him very uncomfortable, "Four years old!" 
"Wow, you really are four years old. So how come you are here performing today?" 
This was the crucial question... 
Ye Xiaobao remembered the answer the bad uncle had taught him, thus with eyes as clear as dark grapes, he looked down at the crowd. 
Huh? Uncle Bingshan is indeed sitting there, and he looks even more handsome tonight than the other day! 
With an innocent smile, he said, "I’m performing for daddy, I want to give it to him as a present." 
Daddy? 
When these childish words fell in the hall, whispers arose immediately. 
Wasn’t this performance prepared for the city leaders? How did it become a gift this child prepared for his daddy? 
Everyone looked puzzled at the tiny child, including Ou Mucen seated in the front row. 
Daddy? 
Wasn’t his father long gone? He had just had a big argument with his mother about this very topic. 
Ou Mucen caught a sense of something amiss, just as the child looked elsewhere, prompting him to follow the gaze. 
"Cousin, do you think tonight’s plan will succeed?" It was Bai Wei, who at the moment was nervously watching the little boy on the stage. 
Could she not be nervous? He was her lifeline. If she couldn’t bring that man down tonight, he would surely kill her. 
Luckily, the man in the white suit sitting beside her offered her reassurance, "Just wait, the big scene is coming up!" 
After saying that, he gestured with a fighter jet model he had just received toward the little boy who was looking at him. 
These things are damn expensive, costing tens of thousands, and to top it off, he had spent a lot of manpower searching the whole city!
###Chapter 114: Chapter 113: Do They Really Think He’s Mentally Challenged?
The little boy was a very clever child, and at the sight of the model, his laughter grew even louder... 
"Your dad? Did your dad come today?" 
"He did." 
"Where is he?" 
"He’s right..." 
The boy’s dark and shiny eyes looked down, and in that moment, the hall was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. 
It wasn’t their fault, this banquet had gathered all the prominent figures of A City, and if this child really was the son of one of the attendees, that really would become the center of attention. 
Ou Mucen’s brows furrowed slightly, and he began to feel a sense of unease. 
Dad? 
He glanced at the mayor’s daughter sitting next to him and her parents who were beside her, about to stand up and take the child who was now looking at him off the stage, when suddenly, the little brat started to speak in a milky voice, "Over there, he is my daddy!" 
What? 
The whole room was stunned when this was said, and they turned their astonished gazes to the front, their expressions no less shocked than witnessing a volcanic eruption. 
In fact, the impact of this news was just that powerful. He was the distinguished third young master of the Ou Family, how could he suddenly become someone’s daddy? He wasn’t even married yet, where did such a big child come from? 
For a moment, the entire banquet hall was in an uproar, and everyone was staring at the scene with disbelieving faces. 
The mayor’s daughter and her parents also changed color, quickly standing up from their chairs, furious and ready to leave the place, leaving Bai Tingfang and the old master hopping mad. 
But only Ou Mucen, after seeing the little scoundrel drop such a bomb on stage and then look up at him with innocent laughter, curled his lips into a smirk, stood up, and walked over, "Having fun?"
Ye Xiaobao was very honest, "Fun, so are you happy, Uncle?" noveldrama
Uncle? 
How did he suddenly start calling him Uncle again? 
The crowd, already confused by this situation, suddenly heard the child call the third young master of the Ou Family ’uncle’, and they were a bit slow to react, even those waiting to see how the drama unfolds were caught off guard. 
What’s going on? Is there a problem? Why does it seem like the child recognizes that man? 
Ou Yuze stood up anxiously. 
But the two people engaged in conversation, one tall, one short, were completely oblivious to him and to everyone around them, continuing their chat. 
Really, just like old acquaintances! 
"Uncle is quite happy. Tell Uncle, who asked you to do this?" 
Ye Xiaobao smiled, "That uncle over there, look, he’s wearing a white suit with a bow tie; he said it’s your birthday today and told me to call you daddy, which would surely make you happy. He even bought me a fighter jet model for it, look..." 
Xiaobao was really especially good, fearful that Uncle Bingshan in front of him wouldn’t believe him, he even pointed over there with his little finger. 
So the whole room was in shock again, their faces a mix of disbelief, anger... at that moment, adjectives could no longer express the expressions on their faces. 
The only thing visible was the figure striding over with a cane in hand, furious beyond measure... 
"Grandpa..." 
"Beast!" 
With a smack— 
he knocked the figure who was about to explain sprawling to the ground!
###Chapter 115: Chapter 114: Whose Child is This After All?
Slapping a man, how raging must one’s anger be to knock a grown man to the ground? 
The onlookers were shocked by this scene, especially those who had been sitting next to the man who was now sprawled on the floor; they covered their mouths with their hands, looking at the scene with horror. 
My God! 
How could this...? 
"Dad, this... this..." 
"You don’t need to tell me anything. Today, I just want to ask this little beast what exactly he is up to?" 
Ou Muyuan was certainly known for his temper in the Blue Mountain Villa, and he was no fool. In such a situation, someone prompting an unacquainted child to call his son "Dad" meant something he understood better than anyone. 
Therefore, at this time, the fury in him was truly frightening to anyone who saw it. 
Ou Muyuan dared not say anything more as his son, who had been slapped to the ground, was so terrified that he was close to fainting. 
Ou Yuze was not faring much better. He had thought that he was about to succeed, but at the last moment, a dramatic turnaround had occurred, and suddenly he found himself in this terrible situation. 
Ou Mucen! Ou Mucen!! 
He looked up and saw that, at this time, the man who had just been ensnared by his trap was not even glancing in this direction. Instead, he was still speaking to the child, and in an instant, a thought flashed through his mind. 
"It’s not like that, Grandfather. I don’t know that child at all, how could I possibly have him call my uncle-in-law ’Dad’? Do I have a death wish? It’s my uncle who knows him." 
"Exactly, exactly, you see, the third brother is right there talking to the child." 
At this critical moment, Mei Liping also chimed in. 
When the crowd heard this, they immediately turned their heads and realized that indeed, the child was currently talking to the youngest master of the Ou Family. 
Could it be? This child actually knows the third young master, not the grand young master? 
The crowd began to feel bewildered, thinking of the rumored discord between the two young masters. In an instant, the people in the hall fell silent, including Ou Muyuan himself. 
Even he was no exception!
As the atmosphere in the hall reached a boiling point, the man who had been playing with the child finally turned around. 
But as he turned, he also lifted the child into his arms. 
"I do indeed know him. Not only do I know him, but I also know his name, his age, and who is in his family!" 
"..." 
It seemed as though he was talking about the most normal thing in the world. At this moment, the man who brought the child over, with his calm voice and unchanging tone, seemed surprisingly serene. 
Ou Muyuan was astounded, "You know who he is?" 
Ou Mucen nodded, "He is the child of one of my company’s employees. I’ve seen him before, so naturally, I know him." 
So that was it! 
Upon hearing this, everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief, including the Mayor’s family. 
However, Ou Muyuan and his family were stunned, especially Ou Yuze. Hearing that the child was indeed the son of an employee in his company, his expression was as if his mind had stopped working, fixated on the child without another reaction. 
So, this child actually knew his uncle all along. Was it possible that by agreeing to him and letting him buy models, he was actually plotting against him? noveldrama
A four-year-old child was plotting against him?!!!
###Chapter 116: Chapter 115 Xiaobao, If Your Mom Is Gone...
"You little bastard, how dare you deceive me?" 
"Who are you calling a little bastard? Say it again, I dare you!" 
In a second, the man who had not been angered even after being framed suddenly turned a shade of iron blue, as if he would cripple the other if he dared to say another word about the child. 
Ou Yuze didn’t dare speak again. Sitting on the ground, his face a mix of green and white, as if he had swallowed a dead fly, he looked exceptionally splendid. 
The onlookers, sensing what had transpired, stared at the young master with disdain on their faces, "It looks like the rumors about the Ou Family are true. Tonight’s drama sure is exciting!" 
"Indeed, who would have thought this young master would be such a fool. Lucky for the Ou Corporation that he’s not the one in charge, otherwise it would have been finished." 
"Don’t worry, the old man would never hand over the family assets to such an idiot. Haven’t you seen the Third Young Master here?" 
"Right, the Third Young Master is the real heir!" 
"..." 
When the crowd dispersed, they were all talking about the incident as if they had just watched a supremely thrilling play. 
In fact, the play was indeed thrilling enough that the media headlines in A City tomorrow morning would be dedicated to tonight’s news, with the Ou Family becoming the laughing stock once again. 
The elder Ou thought of this, growing even more furious, and after hitting Ou Yuze several times with his cane, he was about to kick him out on the spot! 
Mei Liping panicked upon hearing this, quickly pulling Ou Muyuan to kneel before the old man, pleading with him until he finally abandoned the thought. 
Ou Mucen didn’t listen to the rest. He wasn’t interested in these matters to begin with, especially with his mother there. As long as she was around, the second branch of the Ou Family would never be well off. 
So, while everyone in the hall was busy watching the excitement, he picked up Baozi and left. noveldrama
"Uncle, where are we going? Are you taking me back?" 
Going back? 
How could he go back with his mother there? 
The man, hurrying outside with a serious expression, finally understood why that woman had appeared at the Ou estate tonight. It turned out she had come for her son. 
Recalling the message he had just received, his expression grew even uglier, "I’m asking you, if your mother was... crippled, or gone, what would you do?" 
My mother, crippled... or gone? 
What did that mean? 
Ye Xiaobao was startled by the sudden, horrifying question, "Uncle, what do you mean? My mom is fine, how could she be crippled? Gone?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
After a moment, he turned his head away awkwardly and squeezed out, "I mean... hypothetically!!" 
Hypothetically? 
Ye Xiaobao looked up suspiciously at him. 
Why such a ’hypothetically’ when everything is fine? Even if his mind was dark, he shouldn’t curse someone’s mother to death, right? 
Ye Xiaobao’s chubby little face suddenly became unhappy, "Uncle, are you bullying my mom again? Did you cripple her this time?" 
Ou Mucen immediately looked guilty and turned his attention forward, "No!" 
"No? Then why are you asking me this?" 
"I was just asking..." 
"Uncle, that’s not a normal question to ask. I’m telling you, uncle, I’m already a child from a single-parent family. If my mom is crippled or gone, then I’ll be an orphan, and you’ll have to take care of me." 
Ou Mucen: "..."
###Chapter 117: Chapter 116: Ou Mucen, you bastard, I quit!
Just as Ou Mucen stood there unsure of how to respond, a figure suddenly appeared in front of them, limping toward them. Upon seeing the child Ou Mucen was holding by the hand, the figure froze for a second and then suddenly shouted, "Xiaobao! Xiaobao, is that you?" 
Could it be his mother? 
Ye Xiaobao opened his mouth wide in surprise, "How could my mom be here?" 
Ou Mucen was also taken aback! 
She’s still alive? 
"Xiaobao? Xiaobao, are you alright? Mommy’s here to pick you up." 
Ye Ning, who was hurrying over toward them, hadn’t noticed the expressions on the faces of the two people she approached. Seeing that the little person was indeed her son, she ignored the pain in her foot and rushed over. 
That damned bastard, her leg... 
Getting closer and seeing it was indeed her son, she immediately threw the bag in her hand and squatted down to embrace him, "My baby, it’s so good you’re okay. You had mommy worried to death." 
Ye Xiaobao blinked his beautiful eyes and after a while, he reached out his small hands and hugged his mother as well, "Don’t worry, Mommy, I’m fine. How did you get here?" 
"I heard from Aunt Qiao, she went to the kindergarten to pick you up and said you weren’t there, you were performing somewhere, and then mommy came looking for you." 
"But how did you know I was here?" 
"I called and asked, and then just happened to..." She trailed off as she finally remembered this place and then the incident that had occurred earlier. Suddenly, her eyes lifted fiercely to stare at the man standing to the side of the mother and son. 
"Ou Mucen you bastard, do you realize I almost died because of you today?" noveldrama
By now, Ou Mucen’s expression had completely calmed down. In fact, even after seeing the mother and son reunited, he stood there, leisurely lighting a cigarette. 
Hearing the accusation that his actions had almost killed her, he merely glanced at her feet with indifference, "You’re not dead yet, are you?" 
"What did you say?" 
"I mean, if you don’t want to die even quicker, you should roll out of here fast. Otherwise, when they come to catch you, I won’t be able to help." 
"Ou Mucen!!!" 
Ye Ning was about to explode with anger. What kind of person was he? An animal? How could he be so inhumane? 
Ye Xiaobao was also angry now, seeing that this bad uncle was indeed bullying his mother again. Remembering the question he had just been asked, everything became clear to him, "Oh, I get it now. So, you are truly bullying my mom again. Uncle, you’re really getting out of hand. Why are you always picking on my mom? Do you actually want to take care of me?" 
What? 
The man, who was smoking, nearly choked on his cigarette in surprise. 
Confused by what she heard, Ye Ning asked, "Xiaobao, what do you mean? What’s this about him wanting to take care of you?" 
Ye Xiaobao said indignantly, "Just before you came, he asked me what I would do if you ended up disabled or gone. I said if you were gone and I became an orphan, he would have to take care of me. And now you’ve actually been bullied by him into this state. Isn’t that him signaling he wants to take care of me?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Suddenly, she rummaged through her bag, pulled out a set of keys, and threw them at the man, "Master Ou, here’s your car keys back. From today on, I, An Ning, quit. Do whatever you please, I won’t serve you anymore." 
Having said that, she took her son’s hand and turned away, limping off!
###Chapter 118: Chapter 117: He Suddenly Lifted Her Up!
Isn’t this too much? Is this person even human? Even if someone is cold and heartless, shouldn’t there be a limit? 
When Ye Ning left with her son, her heart turned ice cold. If, five years ago, the feeling this man gave her was that of an aloof and arrogant rich man’s heir, 
then now, he had completely overturned her values. He had become a jerk without a trace of humanity. 
Ye Ning limped along with her son, moving quickly despite the pain in her foot and their slow pace. At that moment, she didn’t even stop for a second but hurried towards the exit. 
The goal was to leave this suffocating place as quickly as possible. 
However, after only a few yards, the thick fluid from her high heels made it impossible for her to walk any further. With no other choice, she stopped to take a tissue from her bag to pad the inside of her shoe, hoping it would make walking easier. 
But just then, her son, whom she was holding by the hand, suddenly looked back, "Bad uncle, what are you doing?" 
Bad uncle? 
She turned around in surprise, only to find that, somehow, the man who had just thrown his keys at them was now right behind them. 
"Hold your mom’s shoes!" 
"Ah?" 
"And carry the bag as well!" 
"..." 
Ye Xiaobao stood there, blinking his big, dark, and clear eyes, and then he suddenly smiled. 
He quickly squatted down, picked up the blood-stained shoe of his mother, and also took the bag lying on the ground in his hands, "Uncle, all done!" 
Ou Mucen flicked the cigarette butt from his hand and walked over without even looking at what expression the woman had, and stood directly in front of her. noveldrama
Ye Ning hadn’t yet grasped what was happening; her intelligence was always outmatched by her son’s. Seeing him approach, she instinctively stepped back on tiptoe. 
"What do you want to do?" 
"What do you think I want to do? With you looking like this, my woman, what else can I do?" 
His words were sharp. Even at this moment, he derived pleasure from insulting her. 
Once again, Ye Ning was infuriated. She lifted her foot to leave, but right at that moment, the man in front of her suddenly bent down. Then, after a disorienting whirl, she smelled a familiar faint hint of mint and opened her eyes... 
My God! 
What on earth is he doing? 
"Ou Mucen, what are you trying to do? Why are you picking me up? Put me down!" 
"Do you think I want to hold you? I’m doing this simply because I don’t want you to die here." 
As if completely ignoring her resistance, he held her in his arms, his gaze cold and fixed straight ahead, and he strode towards the doorway. 
Ye Ning’s mind went blank! 
What on earth was this man thinking? He had just been chillingly cruel, and now he was carrying her out. What was his intention? 
Also, did he realize where they were? He, a lordly heir of the Ou Family, was walking through the estate holding a woman. Did he understand the consequences? 
Ye Ning felt like she was going crazy... 
Especially when she once again caught the distinctive scent of his pheromones. 
But Little Baozi following beside them was extremely happy, seeing that the bad uncle had finally agreed to carry his mother out. His chubby little face was all smiles, "Uncle, don’t worry, my mom will go to your company to work tomorrow."
###Chapter 119: Chapter 118 I Will Personally Send Him to Hell
"Really?" 
"Yeah, she was just venting at you, women, you know, always say the opposite of what they feel. You have no idea, she was so happy when she found out that it was your company that hired her, she even took me for a big meal." 
This silly child!! 
Ye Ning felt she was both angry and anxious, as if she was about to cough up blood: "Ye Xiaobao!!! Shut your mouth!" 
"..." 
Ye Xiaobao closed his mouth, but those big, watery eyes looked at his mother with such grievance. 
Really, why was Ye Dabao venting her anger on him? He was trying to help her. She thought he didn’t know that she was determined to work at this awful uncle’s company, Ye Dabao, you big fool. 
Ye Ning glared at him furiously as well... 
Was he really her biological son? How could he betray his own mother like this? 
Her face flushed red as she looked up, only to see that the face above her did not look back at her. Instead, it maintained its usual indifference, an expressionless gaze fixed ahead, which made her heart finally take a long, relieved breath. noveldrama
That rascal, just wait until I get you home! 
The three of them stopped talking and walked straight out. 
Strangely enough, Ye Ning had been worried about people from the estate seeing them as this man carried her, which could cause unnecessary misunderstandings. 
But as they walked, she realized that there was no one around. Looking carefully, she then understood that he had taken the back door of the manor. 
So he could be scared too... 
A self-mocking smile flickered across Ye Ning’s lips. 
"Don’t get me wrong, this is my house, I can leave however I want. I took this route because of you. Tonight, your son was used to harm me, and he’s now the center of attention. If people see that you are his mother, you and your son will quickly become the biggest news in this city tomorrow. So, I advise you, if you don’t want to become too famous, it’s best to keep your identity, and that of your child, a secret after you get back." 
Just as Ye Ning was in self-mockery, the man carrying her spoke these cold words. 
As he finished speaking, she stiffened, and then her face turned pale with shock! 
What was he talking about? 
Her child, the center of attention? 
My goodness, why is this happening? Who would do such a thing? 
She started to panic, forgetting that she was still in his arms, her hand gripping his chest tightly: "What exactly is going on? Why would Xiaobao be used to harm you? Who would do such a thing?" 
Ou Mucen looked down at her, especially... at the hands gripping his chest. 
They were hands that had turned pale to the point where even the blue veins were visible, a clear display of her current emotional agitation, as well as her panic and fear.
In the end, she was just a poor woman innocently caught up in this whole affair. 
The man still holding her looked away, his heart ultimately softening a bit: "It was my nephew; he wanted Xiaobao to call me ’Dad’ in front of everyone during the performance today." 
Nephew? 
Was he talking about... Ou Yuze? 
Ou Yuze!! 
So, it was that beast again!! 
In an instant, the thin woman held in the man’s arms had blood-red eyes, and her hands began to tremble at the mention of that name. 
Yes, the party today, while she was in this man’s room earlier, she had overheard his mother talking about an arranged meeting prepared for him and the mayor’s daughter. 
That also meant that any scandal involving this man at this event would inevitably cast a shadow over the image of the mayor’s daughter and everyone else present,
###Chapter 120: Chapter 119: Who on Earth Is She?
And nothing was more explosive than the scandal of an illegitimate child. 
Ye Ning finally understood and thought back to the figure she had seen entering the villa. A bloodthirsty coldness surged from her eyes, "I will personally send him to hell!" 
"What did you say?" 
Ou Mucen was taken aback by the completely different voice and lowered his head, only to find that in this brief time, her demeanor had completely changed. 
Those were a pair of entirely unfamiliar eyes, slightly narrowed, the focal point uncertain, but the light that shot from them was like two cold, gleaming blades, piercing straight into the heart, making one extremely uncomfortable. 
Was she so murderous just because her child had been used? 
Ou Mucen frowned and was about to say something, when Little Baozi, who had been following all along, suddenly spoke up, "Uncle, there’s someone ahead." 
Someone ahead? 
In an instant, Ye Ning’s mind became clear again. She did indeed see a figure approaching and quickly struggled out of the man’s embrace, "Ou Mucen, that’s enough. From here, we can go back on our own." 
Ou Mucen also saw the person, so he didn’t insist any longer, taking the keys he had been given and handing them over, "Take my car to go back, you won’t be able to hail a cab to Qianshui Bay, nor catch a bus." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
However, Ye Xiaobao eagerly took the keys from Uncle’s hand, "Uncle, thank you, I knew you’re actually a good person." 
A good person? 
The man standing in the dim light looked down at Little Baozi at his feet, who was not as tall as his leg, twitched the corner of his mouth, and finally reached out to pet the little head, "Do you know what to do when you get back?" 
Ye Xiaobao’s round little head nodded at once, "Take Mom to see the doctor, and then go home, but Uncle, you also need to be careful, you don’t have any good people around you, you need to take care of yourself too." 
The last sentence hit home! noveldrama
Ou Mucen’s hand petting his little head stiffened, looking down to see the little tyke who barely reached half his leg height looking up at him with big, bright, and shining eyes full of unconcealed concern and worry. 
Suddenly, he didn’t know why, but something flickered in his heart, and a feeling he had never experienced before welled up from within... 
That feeling, it was comforting! 
More comforting than anything he had ever done! 
Eventually, Ou Mucen watched the mother and son leave before he returned to his own Orchid Garden. 
Once at Orchid Garden, he went upstairs and took a close look at his window, only to realize that the woman had indeed jumped from his window. However, she had found a crevice outside his window that even he wasn’t aware of, a crevice that allowed her to evade detection and make her escape successfully. 
"Young Master, only the servants in our estate know about this cleaning channel; it’s usually secured with a movable door. How did that thief come to know of it?" 
"..." 
Ou Mucen did not answer, but held the lock that had been opened in his hand and fell into deep thought... 
--- 
It was very late by the time Ye Ning got home. After a night of ordeal, she was truly exhausted. Coupled with the injury to her foot, once back, she essentially collapsed onto the sofa.
###Chapter 121: Chapter 120: Lin Yebai is Here......
Fortunately, Xiaobao was very understanding. Seeing how exhausted his mother was, he took a bath by himself, brought her a glass of water, and asked her to take her medicine. 
Ye Ning was deeply moved. She hugged her son and then told him to go to bed and rest, while she took her medicine, washed up, and went to bed herself. 
A deep sleep through the night... 
The next morning, Ye Ning was woken up by the ringing of her cellphone. In a daze, she picked it up and saw that it was a call from the kindergarten. 
"Hello? Is this Xiaobao’s mom? This is Teacher Huang from the kindergarten." 
"Yes, it is!"
Having received this call, Ye Ning pretty much knew what it was about, so her tone was neither warm nor cold. 
As expected, as soon as Teacher Huang heard her, she immediately asked why Xiaobao wasn’t brought to the kindergarten today and if it was because of yesterday’s incident. If that was the case, she wanted to apologize. 
Apologize? 
If apologies were useful, what would we need the police for? 
Ye Ning, recalling the words of the man from last night, grew even colder: "No need, there’s been some things lately, and Xiaobao won’t be going to the kindergarten for the time being. I’ll contact you when I have time." 
After saying that, she hung up the phone. 
Indeed, she couldn’t send Xiaobao to that kindergarten anymore. Ou Mucen was right; what kind of place was Blue Mountain Villa? Any small incident there could garner national attention. If Xiaobao had become a pawn in a covert struggle between the young masters of that villa last night, he would definitely be watched as well. 
So, what he said was not wrong at all—she couldn’t stay at that kindergarten. 
Not just the kindergarten, she couldn’t stay here, either. 
With this thought, she finally lost all desire to sleep. She got up from the bed, planning to wash up and then take her son out to look for another house. However, she was not expecting that when she opened the door, there was already someone sitting in the living room. 
"Brother Lin, why have you come? This early in the morning..." 
"Early? It’s almost nine o’clock." 
Lin Yebai was sitting there, holding Hundun in his arms. He pointed to the clock on the wall as soon as he saw her finally come out. 
Ye Ning was shocked! 
How was it already nine o’clock? She had slept so late? 
She felt a bit embarrassed. Hearing the sound of water in the bathroom, she walked over to find that the little guy had already woken up. noveldrama
"Mom, you’re finally up? I’ve already been to the supermarket with Uncle Lin to buy Hundun." 
"Oh, is that so..." Ye Ning said, somewhat embarrassed as she ran her fingers through her tousled hair and quickly hobbled into the bathroom to freshen up. 
It turned out Lin Yebai had come early. Seeing that she was asleep, he woke Xiaobao, who let him in, and then took Xiaobao to the supermarket to buy breakfast. 
Ye Ning, looking at her disheveled reflection in the mirror, felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her. 
Quickly getting herself together, she changed her clothes in the room and then came out, only to find that the man who excelled in cooking had already prepared and served the Hundun. 
"Brother Lin, I feel so bad, always inconveniencing you like this." 
Lin Yebai smiled and handed her the chopsticks, his gaze naturally falling on her foot wrapped in gauze: "Xiaobao mentioned that you went to Blue Mountain Villa yesterday? Are you alright?"
###Chapter 122: Chapter 121 The Unbearable Weight
Ye Ning glared at her son immediately upon hearing that, "Nothing serious, nothing serious, just went to pick him up and bring him home." 
"Then how did you hurt your foot?" 
Foot? 
Ye Ning bent down, and seeing what he was looking at, namely her right foot that was wrapped in gauze, she suddenly felt a bit guilty and retracted it a little, "It’s nothing, I just twisted it a bit when I was walking too hurriedly last night, it’s really nothing."
"Really?" 
"Really, Yebai, you don’t need to worry, it’s nothing." Ye Ning tried to keep a smile on her face as she said this, all to prevent him from suspecting anything. 
Actually, she didn’t want to hide it from him, but she felt that he had already helped her and her son enough, and she didn’t want to trouble him or make him worry anymore. 
Fortunately, after she said this, he didn’t ask any further, withdrawing his gaze. He also picked up his chopsticks, "I also just heard about it last night after Xiaoyu came home. I was going to come and get you, but then I thought about it being the Blue Mountain Villa and I was worried it might affect you negatively, so I didn’t go." 
Ye Ning quickly nodded, "Right, you can’t go to that place. Ou Mucen is very suspicious, I said you were my master and he’s still not entirely convinced. It’s better for you not to appear in front of him in the future." 
"Hmm..." 
The man eating Hundun nodded, but in his mind, he recalled how he had waited under the streetlight last night for a full two hours, until he finally saw the mother and son exiting from the back door, only to get into a black Bentley. 
It’s said that the Ou Family’s third young master is a man with severe mysophobia, unable to be touched by anyone or to allow anyone to use his things. 
So, does that mean his car can be used by others just like that? 
Finishing the bowl of Hundun in front of him and seeing it was getting late, he stood up, "You rest at home today. I’ll take Xiaobao to sign up at the new kindergarten and bring him back to you in the afternoon." noveldrama
Ah? 
Ye Ning’s mouth fell open, her face a picture of astonishment as she looked at him, "Yebai, you..." 
Lin Yebai just smiled, "After hearing Xiaoyu’s account yesterday, I felt Xiaobao’s kindergarten was really unsafe. Since you were planning to move to the city anyway, I went ahead and contacted the kindergarten we had inquired about before. They’ve agreed to let us register today, so don’t worry." 
His voice was as calm and unchanged as when he normally spoke to her, gentle and slightly deep. 
But Ye Ning knew that what he was saying meant he had resolved all the issues she was currently facing. How could she possibly be deserving of this? 
"Yebai, I..." 
"Alright, you just rest well at home. With your foot injured, you shouldn’t be walking around too much, or it won’t heal quickly." 
Seeing her standing in front of him as if she wanted to say something but didn’t know where to start, Lin Yebai simply cut her off with his nonchalant comment and then walked out the door, holding Xiaobao’s hand. 
Ye Ning watched, only to be left with no choice but to stay at home. 
In fact, she owed Lin Yebai too much. His support over the past five years could even be described as a "heavenly grace." 
Therefore, she never knew how to react to him properly, especially since she faintly sensed his feelings for her. But as an unwed mother with a child, and him being such an outstanding man, it was something she didn’t dare to contemplate. 
This was also the reason why, at times, she really didn’t want him to keep helping her.
###Chapter 123: Chapter 122 She’s Coming on to Me Again......
After they left, Ye Ning, whose leg was indeed aching a bit, returned to her room to rest. When she turned on her phone, as expected, the front-page headline was about last night’s incident at Blue Mountain Villa, and her heart immediately clenched.
Ou Yuze, you beast! 
Fortunately, as she scrolled through, she found that any photos or reports involving the child were brief and the images were pixelated. She let out a long sigh of relief. 
It seemed that man had already handled it. 
She put down her phone and, thinking of the car still parked downstairs, finally went to her wardrobe to find some clothes to change into before heading downstairs. 
The car was his, so naturally, she had to return it, not to mention that it wasn’t an ordinary car. Leaving it parked here would attract unwanted attention and trouble for her. 
After descending the stairs, she directly opened the car door and got in. "Hello, is this Secretary Gao? This is An Ning. I drove the Third Master’s car back yesterday. I’m going to return it soon. Can you come down to pick up the keys when I arrive?" 
"Sure, just give me a call when you’re here." 
The person on the phone didn’t show any sign of surprise and agreed upon receiving her call. 
Ye Ning was relieved at this and started the car, heading towards the downtown area of B City... noveldrama
In fact, after yesterday’s incident, she had calmly thought it over and really decided not to work there anymore. The reason, apart from that person being particularly annoying and making her want to stay away at every moment, 
was more importantly, Ye Xiaobao had now entered their field of vision. That was a very dangerous place; the slightest carelessness could lead to fatal trouble. As her child, if they suspected Xiaobao and conducted a thorough investigation, there was a high likelihood of him being discovered, putting him in danger. 
So, she had decided to resign! 
With this thought in mind, she stopped at a convenience store to buy a pen and a notebook, where she wrote her resignation letter. Then, she got back into the car. 
Well, it was convenient to bring it along and drop it off on the way. 
However, just as she had finished writing and was about to start the car, Secretary Gao suddenly called again, "An Ning, where are you now?" 
Ye Ning looked around, "I’m about to get on the ring road, what’s up? Is there something wrong?" 
"Yeah, can you swing by Blue Mountain Villa and pick up the Third Master on the way? He just called, and since you’re on the way, you might as well get him." 
"..." 
Ye Ning held the phone and didn’t recover for at least three seconds... 
Wait, who told him she was on the way? Blue Mountain Villa was in the east of the city, and she lived in the west. How was that on the way? Was he brainless? 
And, with such a large Blue Mountain Villa, didn’t he have any cars? Or drivers? Why did she have to pick him up? 
Ye Ning felt this request was simply unbearable. Clutching the phone, she bluntly replied, "Secretary Gao, I’m already on the ring road, it’s not on the way. I’d have to turn around to go to Blue Mountain Villa." 
"Then turn around. The Third Master said he wants to drive your car to B City. When you get to the company, I will bring it over; there’s not enough time now." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Sitting in the driver’s seat, she was completely blocked for five seconds before she slammed the phone down angrily. 
Damn it! 
She wanted to curse out loud. What kind of situation was this? Had she known, she wouldn’t have bothered to bring the car back herself. Couldn’t that rotten secretary come to get it? After all, that bastard already knew about her injured foot. 
Ye Ning was filled with regret!
###Chapter 124: Chapter 123 Grandpa Ou, I’m here to pick you up!
In the end, Ye Ning still helplessly drove the car towards Qianshui Bay. Worried that Lin Yebai might come back with Xiaobao earlier, she called him first. 
"Hello, Brother Lin, this is Ye Ning. The Ou Corporation just called for the car, so I went ahead and delivered it to the company. If you’re back, you can get the keys from the landlord downstairs, okay?" 
Hearing this, Lin Yebai’s brow furrowed immediately, "Didn’t you hurt your foot? How could they still have you deliver the car? Why don’t I deliver it when I get back?" 
Ye Ning felt like shaking her head, "No need, no need, it’s probably urgent. It’s fine, I injured my ankle, not my toes, so stepping on the brakes isn’t a problem, and besides, it’s not that far." 
Ye Ning was afraid he’d drive over to help her and quickly declined his kindness. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Yebai didn’t say anything more, but after hanging up the phone, he turned to the child beside him, "Xiaobao, was it that uncle who let you guys drive the car back yesterday?" 
Ye Xiaobao nodded, "Of course, the uncle saw that my mom’s foot was injured, so he gave her the car keys. But you don’t have to worry, he gave my mom the keys just because he was grateful." 
"Grateful?" 
"Yeah, didn’t I tell you? I saved him last night. Otherwise, why would he give my mom the car keys? He’s got a bad temper." 
Ye Xiaobao was indeed a very intelligent child. Knowing this was a very sensitive issue, he decisively chose to reveal only a hint about what had happened between Ye Ning and Ou Mucen at Blue Mountain Villa last night before he was sure of his mother’s thoughts. 
Moreover, he had found the perfect excuse for the car. 
Lin Yebai, unaware of the truth, laughed upon hearing this, "Is that so? Then it seems we owe Xiaobao a lot for last night." 
"That’s for sure. Who do you think I am?" 
"Yes, yes, our Xiaobao is the most capable..." 
"..." 
---- 
While the two of them were off handling nursery school procedures, Ye Ning had finally returned to the familiar scenery and to the place she had sworn just last night she would never visit again. 
Ah, it was really cursed. How had she gotten so hung up on this place in the past two days? Did this place have a grudge against her or what? 
She drove the car over, but seeing no one come out at the entrance to the villa, she could only park angrily, take out her mobile phone... 
This damned bastard, what time was it and he was still at home? Didn’t he usually go to the office early? Why was he still here so late today? Making her come to pick him up? 
She furiously dialed the numbers and called out, "Hello, Secretary Gao, I’ve arrived!" 
Secretary Gao on the other end replied, "Okay, I’ll call him." 
And then he hung up! 
A minute later, Ye Ning received a text message: "Third Young Master asks you to wait five minutes!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Wait another five minutes? 
How could he still not be ready after such a long time? What kind of person was this? 
Her mood soured even more... 
After hanging up, she wanted to get out and stretch her legs, as they had become a bit numb from driving for so long, but after looking at the place, she dismissed the idea. 
Forget it, she couldn’t just wander around here, so out of boredom, she wound down the window and started playing with her phone, hoping the bastard would come out quickly while she occupied herself. 
However, as she sat there for quite a while playing with her phone, not only did she not wait for that bastard, she saw two other people come out instead.noveldrama
###Chapter 125: Chapter 124: Encountered Someone Who Shouldn’t Have Been Encountered
"Alright, Aunt, don’t worry too much. Rest assured, I will talk to my mother when I get back, and then she can plead with Grandfather. I believe that, for the sake of my mother being his only daughter, he will let Cousin off the hook this time. Don’t worry, okay?"
"..." 
It was Bai Wei, along with Ou Yuze’s mother, Mei Liping! 
She hadn’t expected to encounter these two first thing in the morning. 
Ye Ning’s fingers clenched tightly... 
Last night’s incident, she hadn’t actually witnessed it firsthand. It was that man who had later narrated the details to her, and after she returned, she had asked Xiaobao, gaining a general understanding of what had happened. noveldrama
However, as for the outcome, she was in the dark. Hearing what Bai Wei was currently discussing, it seemed the young master of the Ou Family who had shot himself in the foot the previous evening wasn’t in a promising position? 
She pricked up her ears, listening to the noises outside. 
"That’s reassuring. Nothing else matters as much as your cousin’s right to inherit. Under any circumstance, he cannot lose that. If he does, not only will our second branch lose everything, but your mother and the Bai Family would also be at a great disadvantage." 
"Don’t worry, I understand. I will talk to my mother and ask her to persuade Grandfather. But, who was that kid last night? Have you had someone look into it? The fact that he knows Ou Mucen must mean there’s more to the story!" 
Mei Liping nodded, "I feel the same. His office has always hired young and beautiful girls; when did they ever employ a woman with a child? And for that child to be so familiar with him, do you think that’s possible?" 
"So, you mean to say...?" 
"We must find this child’s parents, even if it means searching high and low. Only by finding them can we truly discover who this child is and what the relationship with him really is!" 
The last sentence, coming from the woman named Mei Liping, bore a face that had already twisted somewhat fiercely, looking very terrifying. 
Ye Ning’s hands turned white, and at the same time, fine cold sweat began to form on her back. 
Just as she had suspected, her child had barely appeared before their eyes and had already caused trouble. It was fortunate that she had started to prepare to leave today. Otherwise, if they managed to find her based on that kindergarten, the trouble would have been immense. 
As she listened with trepidation, Bai Wei suddenly caught sight of the black Bentley parked nearby, her expression suddenly changed, "Uncle’s car? Why is it here?" 
With that one sentence, Mei Liping was also startled and quickly glanced over here. Both women, through the windshield, saw Ye Ning sitting in the driver’s seat. 
Ye Ning froze for a second! 
After that second, she decisively pressed the lock button for the window. 
She had no desire to encounter them now, whether it was Bai Wei, whom she had already met, or Mei Liping, whom she hadn’t truly met since returning. 
But that woman was extremely fast; just as Ye Ning made a move, the woman rushed over, "So it’s you, what are you doing here? When did you come?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
After a while, she finally turned her head from inside and looked at the woman blocking her window, "Miss Bai, your question is rather strange. Since I am your uncle’s assistant, what do you think I am doing here, driving his car?" 
"You—" 
Mei Liping also approached, and upon seeing that the car was occupied by a very young woman with short hair, her gaze sharpened immediately, "Who is she?"
###Chapter 126: Chapter 125: Are You a Pig?
Bai Wei’s face turned ashen, "It’s the little assistant that my younger uncle just hired." 
An assistant? 
After hearing that, Mei Liping’s gaze immediately fell upon the very unfamiliar face inside the car. 
It indeed was a face that wasn’t too outstanding, at most, it could be considered delicate. But on that countenance, she did not see the customary flattery and caution employees of the Ou Family usually had when they saw a member of the family. 
Moreover, in her eyes, she saw a type of coldness, a sharpness flickering like a dagger drawn from its sheathe. 
What was that? 
Why did she feel something terrifying? noveldrama
She suddenly forgot what she wanted to say... 
Similarly, Ye Ning in the car was also looking at her. It had been five years, and this was the first time she had laid eyes on her since her return. If she remembered correctly, from the age of 14 until she went to prison at 18, she had called her "Mother" for a full four years. 
Mother, huh! 
A word Ye Ning never called anyone since she was born had actually been used on her for four years. 
Ye Ning looked at the woman standing outside her car window and suddenly smiled, "Hello, Mrs. Ou the Second, I’m the Third Young Master’s assistant. My name is An Ning, pleased to meet you." 
Her smile was extremely beautiful, and her voice, even more pleasant to hear. 
But, if you looked into her eyes, saw her pupils, you would certainly shiver. 
Because that was a killing intent! 
Mei Liping indeed took a step back, wanting to say something, but just then, from behind them, a tall, upright figure emerged from the ornate door that had just opened. Seeing the two women standing by his car, his eyes flashed coldly, and he approached. 
"What are you doing?" 
Bai Wei was shocked, "No... we’re not doing anything, young uncle, we didn’t do anything." 
Mei Liping also snapped back to her senses and saw that the man who had come out was the owner of the car. Embarrassed, she hurriedly explained, "Don’t misunderstand, little brother. We just saw your car parked here, so we came to take a look." 
"Take a look at what? My car can’t be parked here?" Who knew that the man would be so unyielding! 
Mei Liping’s face reddened all of a sudden, wanting to keep explaining, but the man in front of her had already called the security guard over, "Is this your first day on the job here? Don’t you know that no noise or filth should come within three meters of this young master’s car? Do you want to be fired?" 
The security guard, upon hearing this, was so frightened that he could hardly stand straight, "I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Third Young Master. It’s my fault. I will pay attention next time. I won’t let anyone near the Third Young Master’s car, nor will I allow anyone to contaminate any of the Third Young Master’s possessions, Third Young Master..." 
"Get out!!" 
The last word dropped, and not only did the people outside the car turn pale with fright, but even Ye Ning inside the car shuddered. 
This man, indeed, was a tyrant! 
His entrance scattered all ghosts and demons. 
Ye Ning saw the two women quickly vanish from sight in disgrace, so she hurriedly opened the car door and got out from the driver’s seat, "Third Young Master, it’s really nothing. They just found it strange to see your car still here at this time." 
Hmph! 
The man whose mood had been disturbed early in the morning scoffed coldly, "Is it strange for a scion of the Ou Family to leave the house at this hour?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Did she... say something wrong?
###Chapter 127: Chapter 126 He’s Not That Bad Really
Ye Ning didn’t realize that the man had already known about the incident that happened in the company restaurant yesterday. When he saw Bai Wei and Mei Liping appearing here, naturally, he understood that they were looking for trouble with her. 
What a pity, this foolish woman was still making excuses for them! 
Ou Mucen’s face darkened as he approached, taking in her standing there in a simple, solid-colored crew neck T-shirt and comfortable casual jeans, with her clean and neat short hair enhancing the impression of a college student just entering society. The disdain in his eyes grew even thicker, "Drive..." 
Ye Ning was taken aback, "Huh? Should I drive?" 
"Or do you expect me to do it?" 
Ou Mucen, carrying a laptop, casually opened the rear car door, his mind completely forgetting about last night’s events. 
In urgency, Ye Ning said, "But Third Young Master, aren’t you supposed to go to B City today?" 
"Is there a problem?" 
"No, it’s just... I’m not going to B City. The car’s just been brought over for me to deliver by Secretary Gao," Ye Ning tried her best to soften her tone to avoid provoking the tyrant. 
Yes, this man wasn’t easy to serve. 
Fortunately, after she finished speaking, the man, who had already opened the back door, finally looked her way. Following that, his gaze fell on her foot still wrapped in a bandage. 
"Who asked you to come?" noveldrama
Ye Ning was startled! 
Who asked her to come? Of course, it was Secretary Gao. Hadn’t she just said so? 
Ye Ning felt a wave of trepidation as she watched the man walking towards her, his face growing even more disagreeable, "I called Secretary Gao, planning to return your car. Then he told me to drop it off here on the way." 
"Meddlesome!" 
With that remark, the man snatched the keys from her hand and got into the car. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning quickly moved aside, planning to hail a cab after he left. 
However, standing there, she saw that the car had started. The man inside then looked up disdainfully at her and said, "Why are you still standing there? Should I carry you in?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
No, she needed to go home. Why should she get in his car? It wasn’t even on the way. 
She hurried over, "Third Young Master, I need to go home. I can walk out and catch a ride myself." 
Ou Mucen impatiently glared at her, "There are no taxis here, no buses either. Even the nearest transit point is three kilometers away. If you want to walk back, be my guest." 
Hearing this, Ye Ning finally understood and hastily opened the car door, getting in with an agility she had never possessed before. 
That’s right, she had forgotten. He had already mentioned last night that there were no convenient transportation options here, otherwise he wouldn’t have left his car for her to drive home. 
So, by inviting her into the car now, he was probably intending to drop her off at the nearest transit point before heading to B City himself. 
Understanding this, Ye Ning’s previous dissatisfaction with him subsided significantly. 
It seemed he wasn’t all that bad after all. 
Once in the car, neither of them spoke. He drove on while she sat in the back, thinking that it was only a matter of minutes before she would arrive. She chose not to interrupt, worrying she might disturb him, especially since he began taking calls through Bluetooth. And so, the car was silent except for the sound of his phone conversations.
###Chapter 128: Chapter 127: She must have owed him in her former life!
On the way, it took less than five minutes to drive past, and when Ye Ning saw a crossroads passing by, she eagerly looked ahead, wanting to remind him to let her out here. 
However, this man was still on the phone, and it seemed like he was discussing something important—she even overheard something about amounts of money. 
Seeing this, she didn’t dare to interrupt. She could only watch helplessly as the car sped past the crossroads and quickly headed towards the next intersection. 
"Mr. Jin, I’ve told you many times, if you want to work with me, Ou Mucen, you don’t need all that empty talk. Okay, I’m sending you the data now. Call me back once you’ve received it." 
Having said that, he pressed down on the Bluetooth headset in his ear and looked in the rearview mirror. 
Ye Ning was momentarily stunned but quickly reacted. She took the laptop he had brought in earlier from the seat next to her and handed it to him: "Here you go..." 
"Turn it on, go to my email, find an email from Jinhao Trading Co., Ltd., and send them the data table I prepared last night." He spoke sharply and decisively, issuing commands while driving, just as decisive as ever. 
Hearing this, Ye Ning had no choice but to turn on his laptop. But as soon as she reached the login screen, there was a prompt for a password. Helplessly, she cautiously looked ahead: "Mr. Mucen, it’s asking for a password." 
"123456!" 
Ye Ning: "..."
Was she sure she hadn’t misheard? Could it be any simpler? Despite being a CEO, his password was set so rudimentary and weak. 
Upon entering 123456, indeed, the laptop opened straight away, and she hurriedly found his email and clicked on it. But to her surprise, as soon as she clicked, new emails started flooding in like snowflakes, taking about half a minute to stop. 
No wonder she always saw him clattering away something at the computer. It turns out, being a CEO truly wasn’t for ordinary people. 
She stared at the inbox showing hundreds of unread emails and quickly found the company he mentioned, then opened and replied: "Mr. Mucen, is it the spreadsheet on the desktop?" 
"Mhm!" As he spoke, his phone rang again. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning silently carried out the task while he took the call. 
Luckily, she had been trained by Lin Yebai in preparation for her job at the company, so she managed quite adeptly. 
However, just when she finally sent off the email and closed the laptop, she suddenly realized that the car seemed to have gotten onto the highway. noveldrama
What the hell!!! 
She was stunned, and in a flash, after tossing the laptop aside, she pressed herself against the car window: "Ou Mucen, stop the car, look where you’ve gone?!!" 
At that moment, Ou Mucen had just finished a call. Hearing the exclamation from behind, he focused his eyes ahead... 
Not just on the highway, but we’ve already left A City, haven’t we? 
"Ou Mucen, tell me, where exactly are we going? I need to get home." 
"Why are you panicking? I’m not going to eat you. Even if it’s a regular workday, your salary will be counted." 
With such a nonchalant comment, he didn’t seem to take the matter to heart. 
Ye Ning in the back heard this and was furious enough to spit blood! 
What kind of person was this? 
Talking about a normal workday and salary being counted, why doesn’t he just drop dead? 
Ye Ning was about to explode with anger...
###Chapter 129: Chapter 128: Is Lin Yebai Really Just Your Master?
Meanwhile, Lin Yebai, after enrolling Xiaobao in the new kindergarten, returned to the place he and his mother were renting, only to discover that Ye Ning had not come back yet. So, he made a phone call. 
"Hello? Aning, haven’t you come back yet?" 
Ye Ning immediately tensed up, "Not... not yet, Brother Lin, there’s some issues at the company, so I got busy." 
"Busy?" 
Upon hearing this, Lin Yebai’s expression suddenly turned ugly, "You’re injured like this, and they’re still making you work? Is Ou Mucen even human? Stop what you’re doing, I’m coming to pick you up right now." 
Having said that, he was about to leave to get the car. 
Sitting in the car, Ye Ning heard the movement and was scared, her face turning pale, "No need, Brother Lin. I just need to finish this task at hand because I am the only one who knows how to do it, and it just so happens to be urgent. Don’t worry, as soon as I’m done, I’ll head back." 
When Ye Ning spoke, perhaps due to her urgency, her voice was much louder and she completely failed to notice the movements of the other person in the car. 
It wasn’t until she had finished her call that she felt the atmosphere in the car suddenly quiet down, and the man who had been on the phone the entire time was no longer making calls. The silence in the car was now overly oppressive. 
"Brother Lin? Lin Yebai..." 
"What?" 
"Your master really does care a lot about you. Not only teaching you how to appraise treasures, but also caring so much for your life, even offering you help. What now? Is he even trying to restrict your personal freedom?" 
Personal freedom? 
Sitting behind, Ye Ning heard the sarcastic remark from the man in front and felt truly uncomfortable, "What nonsense are you talking about? What do you mean by restricting personal freedom?" 
Ou Mucen sneered, "Isn’t it true? I clearly heard him tracking you and he’s even coming to pick you up. What do you think, should I leave you here now? Maybe send him a location so he can come here to pick you up?" 
What? 
Leave her here? And then have Lin Yebai come to pick her up? He must be crazy! 
Ye Ning finally got angry, straightening up from the back seat to confront him, and she glared at him, pronouncing every word, "Ou Mucen, you’re going too far. I wasn’t planning on going to work today, but because of the mess at your house yesterday, my child is too scared to go to kindergarten. It was my master who took pity on us and came over to help find a new kindergarten for my child. Instead of being sympathetic, you speak so disgustingly. Don’t you have any conscience at all?" 
Ye Ning really let loose, after all, it wasn’t the first time she had argued with him. If he wanted to leave her here, then let it be. 
However, unexpectedly, after she lashed back with these words, the man who had been mocking her in the front seat merely glanced at her coldly in the rearview mirror and said nothing more. 
The man is a complete lunatic! 
Seeing that he was silent, Ye Ning lost interest in speaking further. She glanced at her watch and realized it was already past 12 o’clock, which made her feel even worse. noveldrama
The drive from A City to B City usually takes about two hours. Secretary Gao said that his visit to B City was to sign a contract with a client, so, considering the time, it shouldn’t take too long. Perhaps, he could return by the afternoon. 
With this in mind, she took out her phone and sent a message to Lin Yebai on WeChat, "Brother Lin, I should be able to return in the afternoon. Please take care of Xiaobao for me."
###Chapter 130: Chapter 129 His breath has been filling her mouth and nose...
An hour later, B City— 
"Mr. Ou, Mr. Ou, we’re here!" 
No sooner had the car exited the highway than Ye Ning, sitting inside, saw a gray Bugatti Veyron parked at the tollgate exit. Seeing their car approach, a man immediately got out of the Bugatti Veyron and waved vigorously in their direction. 
Upon seeing this, Ou Mucen steered the car toward them. 
Upon their arrival, the man hurried over, "Mr. Ou, I apologize for the inconvenience of making you come all this way. Our President Xiao has been awaiting you. Mr. Ou, please, this way." 
In the business world, if there is a genuine interest in conducting business, the hospitality is always meticulous. 
For instance, now that Ou Mucen had driven here, as a matter of local courtesy, he no longer needed to drive his own car. Instead, he would be chauffeured by the other party, and someone would naturally take good care of his vehicle. 
Ye Ning had no experience with the corporate world and was unaware of this custom. But seeing the man in front turn off the ignition and get out of his car, she followed suit and exited the vehicle. 
"Mr. Ou, who might this be...?" 
"My assistant!" 
With those three simple, indifferent words, he blocked any further inquiries the man might have had. 
Consequently, Ye Ning, standing behind the man, only noticed he gave her bandaged foot a doubtful glance before going ahead to open the front passenger-side door, "Mr. Ou, please get in the car!" 
As the president, he, of course, deserved the best seat. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning moved toward the rear seats, ready to open the car door to get in. 
However, at that moment, the man walking ahead of her did not head towards the front passenger seat that had been opened for him. Instead, he directly opened the rear car door on his side and got in. 
"Haven’t your President Xiao taught you that the front passenger seat is the most dangerous position?" 
"..." 
The man’s face changed as soon as he heard this, "Mr. Ou, I’m sorry, I..." 
"All right, get in the car!" 
Without uttering another word, his expression was so cold that it genuinely sent shivers down one’s spine. 
Ye Ning also stood there stunned for a moment. 
She knew the front passenger seat was unsafe, but when had he become so security conscious? After all, she had seen him sitting in the front passenger seat beside Secretary Gao several times. 
Now, she would have to share a car ride with him again. 
Ye Ning got into the car with a downturned expression... 
After boarding the vehicle, the middle-aged man also got in. Seeing that the golden backer seated in the rear could not even spare him a glance and was just fiddling with his phone, the man felt even more awkward, "Mr. Ou, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize that at all. I was just thinking that it’d be more comfortable for you to sit in the front when President Xiao joins us later." noveldrama
Wow, someone else is coming too? 
As Ye Ning sat there and heard this, she instantly felt that the man’s decision to sit in the rear was the right one. 
Indeed, she’d rather be with him than sit next to a strange man. Annoying he may be, he was at least familiar. 
So the displeasure she had felt just moments ago dissipated... 
Once the car started moving towards the city center, Ye Ning, seated inside, noticed the man beside her constantly looking down at his phone, occupied with his business, and she did not disturb him. 
However, as time passed, the familiar scent of mint from him filled her senses, and she began to feel somewhat uncomfortable. 
"Mr. Ou, you’re not planning to return today, right? Tonight, President Xiao has already made meticulous arrangements for you," the middle-aged man suddenly said, interrupting the silence.
###Chapter 131: Chapter 130 She Intrudes into the Place Where She Should Not
Not going back? 
How can that be? 
Ye Ning thought of her own child and immediately, without waiting for the person next to her to answer, she spoke up first, "No, we have to go back today, and we need to leave early." 
The man heard this and was stunned, "Leave early? But Mr. Ou..." 
Ou Mucen was also drawn by the sudden voice next to him and glanced sideward, seeing that in just the time it took to say that sentence, the woman who had been sitting there obediently was now rigid with urgency, and abruptly, he glanced at her with some annoyance, "We’ll discuss it when the time comes." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning became even more anxious, "Mr. Ou, you..." 
"Alright, if you don’t want to go back too late, then get all of these organized for me!" After saying that, he threw his phone, which he had been fiddling with all along, over to her. 
Ye Ning quickly caught the phone! 
Organize? 
What did he want her to organize? 
She held the phone still warm from his touch and her face suddenly felt hot again; she quickly looked down, only to see a complete set of company internal systems displayed on the screen, and at that moment, with the pop-up on the page, she finally realized what he meant. 
My goodness, is he even human? 
Not a single moment of free time, even when out on business; does he really think he’s a machine? 
She glanced at the man who, after throwing the phone to her, immediately leaned back in exhaustion and closed his eyes, and finally, she stopped worrying about the previous problem and started to help him organize. 
This was a phone with a very large screen, which made it very convenient to operate, likely custom-made. 
However, because the phone was large and she, as a woman, had fingers that weren’t long enough, it became inconvenient for her to operate, so soon after getting hold of the phone, before she could organize much, the screen suddenly popped up a chat box when she accidentally touched somewhere. 
"Wow, Mr. Ou is online yay!" 
"Really? My god, did the sun rise from the west today?" 
"No, I saw that the fingerprint command he entered was wrong." 
"..." 
My god, what now?!! 
Ye Ning had never seen this kind of chat software, and as soon as she opened it, dialogues began to pop up incessantly, with vibration alerts sounding nonstop, scaring her into frantically tapping on the screen. 
As a result, her tapping did not shut it down; instead, she sent out an emoji... 
Mucen: Bitches be pretentious! 
Young Master Xia: ..... 
Store Manager: ..... 
Doctor Zhan: ..... 
Langya Pavilion’s Number One Beauty: Mr. Ou, you... 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Suddenly, she bit her teeth and, pressing the power button on the side, she turned the phone off with force!! 
Turning it off should do the trick, right! 
Having turned off the phone, her "thumping" heart finally calmed down. She glanced at the man still leaning there and, seeing that he hadn’t noticed anything and was just closing his eyes as if he really had fallen asleep, she let out a long sigh of relief. 
"Sir, how much longer will it be until we arrive?" noveldrama
"Almost there. Ms. An, are you feeling uncomfortable after sitting for so long?" 
Ye Ning shook her head, "No, our CEO’s phone has run out of battery, and we’re looking to charge it as soon as possible; as you know, our CEO has many calls to take every day." 
The middle-aged man nodded immediately, "That’s true, that’s true. We’ll be there very soon, Ms. An, don’t worry, we’re almost there." 
With that, he stepped on the accelerator and sped up again.
###Chapter 132: Chapter 131: Blame Her for Looking Innocent
Ten minutes later, the car finally arrived at its destination— 
"Mr. Ou, my apologies for not being able to pick you up personally." As soon as the car stopped, an immediate greeting came from a middle-aged man in a black suit. 
Ye Ning, inside the car, hurriedly tidied up her things and followed suit, stepping out as well. 
But upon exiting the car, what appeared before her eyes was a luxury villa with exceptionally beautiful scenery, and at that moment, they were standing right at the entrance of this villa resort. 
"Is this villa a new development of yours?" 
"Yes, we just invested in it this year. Mr. Ou, what do you think?" 
This middle-aged man seemed quite familiar with Ou Mucen, and after exchanging greetings, he immediately led him toward the hotel lobby. 
Ye Ning saw this from behind and followed, carrying her laptop bag and her own small handbag, into the lobby as well. 
Villas like this, privately developed, didn’t have many people around, but those who did come were all either rich or noble. 
Ye Ning understood this principle, so after entering, upon seeing the people coming and going, she very sensibly maintained a distance from the two men in front, carrying her belongings on her back. 
Her current attire was very down-to-earth, and if she caused the esteemed young master to lose face, it was uncertain how he might lose his temper. 
However, no sooner had she pulled away than the person walking ahead suddenly turned back and looked at her: "What are you dawdling for?" 
Ye Ning was taken aback: "I... I’m not doing anything?" 
"..." 
No one responded, and all she received was that person’s two icy stares. noveldrama
Realizing what was happening, Ye Ning quickly sped up her pace to catch up. It was at this moment that she overheard some whispers from behind: "That girl is actually brought here by the third young master of the Ou family?" 
"Indeed, who would’ve guessed? At first, I thought she was a college student who came to work here." 
"Same here, you can’t judge a book by its cover, but she’s really lucky to have caught the attention of the president of the Ou Group. I wonder what’s her secret?" 
"Innocence, obviously. Haven’t you seen how youthful..." 
"..." 
The two in front had already entered the elevator, oblivious, but Ye Ning, trailing behind, heard every bit of this gossip clearly. Hearing them say she was a college student who had climbed her way up to the Ou Group’s Crown Prince, she just sneered. 
It seemed that envy was the same among women everywhere. 
After taking the elevator up, Ye Ning didn’t dare to stray too far from the man, fearing he would get angry again. 
In fact, she had carefully analyzed it in the elevator just now: he insisted she stay with him, because the phone was with her, and so was the laptop—he naturally required her to be by his side at all times. 
Fortunately, all the way up to the top-floor restaurant, he did not give her any cold looks. Instead, he was engrossed in conversation with the man named Xiao Shan who had brought them up, paying no attention to her. 
So she followed them to the restaurant and sat down, and as the two men chatted, she took out her phone and played with it. 
"Brother Lin, is Xiaobao doing fine today?" 
Lin Yebai: "Quite well, he can go tomorrow. I’m currently helping you move." 
What? 
Moving!! 
She was completely shocked at that moment, and once she recovered, she immediately tapped out a response: "Brother Lin, how could this be? I’ve already troubled you so much. How can I let you help me with such a big matter? Don’t move it, just wait till I get back."
###Chapter 133: Chapter 132 What Do You Think Euclid’s Assistant Is For?
Because she was so hurried, the rapid tapping of the keyboard on the knockoff phone filled the air; it wasn’t until after the message was sent that she realized no one at the dining table seemed to be speaking anymore. 
What happened? 
She quickly put her phone away, lifted her head to look over the table, and then noticed that the dishes had already been served, and at this moment, the man who had stopped talking seemed to have a somewhat cold aura about him. 
Could it be that he was angry again? 
Ye Ning thought back to the rather loud keypad sound of her phone and hurriedly tossed it into her bag. 
"Miss An, I noticed earlier that your foot was injured, so I specially ordered a few nutritious dishes for you, to make sure you’re well-nourished. You young people, working so hard right after graduating — it’s important to take care of your health." 
"..." 
Unexpectedly, after the dishes were served, the man sitting opposite Ye Ning, Mr. Xiao, actually went out of his way to show concern for her. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s face immediately became flushed, "Not at all, not at all, my job isn’t that tough, thank you, Mr. Xiao." 
But what was this man trying to do, to curry favor? Or for some other reason? After he spoke, upon seeing Ye Ning not touching the food, he even stood up and personally scooped a particularly large abalone from the pot into her bowl. 
Ye Ning was startled by the sight and was just about to take her bowl to accept it when suddenly, an icy presence wafted over from the side. She felt a shiver and hastily retracted her bowl. 
"That, Mr. Xiao, my foot, the doctor said that it’s not appropriate for me to have too much nourishment right now." 
The man, holding the abalone, suddenly froze! 
Not suitable for nourishment? 
He had never heard of such a thing — how could it be that one couldn’t replenish their strength after an injury? 
He looked at her, puzzled, "Shouldn’t you replenish more when you’re injured? Why can’t you do so now?" 
Ye Ning smiled awkwardly, "I don’t know either, the doctor said so, maybe because I’m still taking medication and it’s not suitable." 
Shit! 
Was it easy for her? To avoid eating that abalone, she had resorted to telling the most outrageous lie she ever told in her 23 years. 
The middle-aged man finally backed off sheepishly, "Then what should we do? I specially ordered two additional nourishing dishes because Miss An was injured, but now it turns out Miss An can’t eat them." 
"What does it matter? Aren’t there still vegetables?" As the two were being polite, the man who had been quietly sitting at the table suddenly spoke up with an expressionless face. noveldrama
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning glared at him fiercely. 
You beast, why don’t you eat the vegetables yourself? 
Thankfully, the middle-aged man was kind, and upon hearing him mention vegetables, he immediately spoke up, "How can that be acceptable? She may not need nourishment, but she’s still injured. Let me have the kitchen prepare some less rich dishes for you instead." 
Ye Ning immediately smiled uncomfortably, "How could I impose that, Mr. Xiao?" 
"It’s no trouble at all. You were brought here by Mr. Ou; taking good care of you is only right." And with that, he had the waiter place a new order. 
Although Ye Ning felt somewhat guilty, she didn’t stop him. 
That’s fine; if his actions meant she couldn’t eat abalone, then having something else delicious made instead was just as well. Besides, it wasn’t a complete waste considering she came here with an injury because of him. 
But just as her pleasant mood had begun, it was not even two seconds before the man sitting opposite suddenly asked in an expressionless tone, "Where’s my phone?"
Phone? 
At the mention of it, Ye Ning’s heart skipped a beat! 
It was done for. She had turned off his phone just now, and it wasn’t turned back on yet. 
What should she do? If he found out she had turned off his phone, would he strangle her?
###Chapter 134: Chapter 133 She Doesn’t Like Others Mentioning Her Arrangements
Her mind began to race, but she quickly grabbed her bag and said, "It’s with me, I was handling documents for you in the car just now when the phone suddenly... ran out of battery!" 
That’s right, it ran out of battery!! 
Ye Ning suddenly realized she was simply a genius! 
However, the man sitting opposite her exploded as soon as he heard the phone was out of battery, "Ran out of battery and you didn’t charge it? Don’t you know how many calls I get a day? How much is each call worth?" 
Ye Ning quickly nodded, "Okay, I’ll charge it right away, right away." 
This is a tyrant indeed, as expected, the moment he isn’t pleased, he starts to fly into a rage. 
But, compared to him finding out I turned off the phone, this ’crime’ is much lighter. 
Ye Ning almost flew to grab the phone and charger, then stood up and left to find a place to charge it. 
The middle-aged man watching was somewhat confused, "President Ou, isn’t she... injured?" noveldrama
"So she can’t work because she’s injured? Then why did I bring her along?" 
The middle-aged man was speechless! 
It’s not that she couldn’t work, but wasn’t this little assistant brought along for pleasure? Pure as water, even with an injured foot, she was brought out, who would think she was actually a real assistant. 
The middle-aged man became somewhat embarrassed, "That’s not what I meant, just that I see the young lady is having a hard time. But we all know President Ou has high demands for his subordinates, it’s to be expected, certainly." 
Ou Mucen gave him a cold look and said no more... 
---- 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, after having grabbed her phone and found an electrical outlet at the restaurant’s service desk, plugged it in and turned it on. 
After turning it on, she wanted to check if there were any notifications from that messaging app, but upon activating the screen, she was asked for a password. Helpless, she had no choice but to give up. 
Nevermind, leave it to fate. 
After the phone was charged, she didn’t want to go back to that dining table, so she glanced over there and thought of the WeChat message Lin Yebai had sent earlier, and then she took out her phone and dialed his number. 
"Lin Yebai, it’s Ye Ning..." 
"Have you come back?" 
Ye Ning quickly shook her head, "No, I just wanted to ask about the moving, you should wait for me to come back and do it, I have a lot of stuff, and..." 
"I’ve almost finished setting it up. I hired a moving company. Don’t worry, I haven’t messed up your things, Xiaobao and I are now at your new house. When do you get off work? I’ll come pick you up." 
"..." 
Suddenly, Ye Ning stood there, really not knowing what to say. 
Indeed, sometimes she was grateful and needed his help, but like this, doing such things as moving her home without even notifying her, frankly, she felt a bit uncomfortable. 
Because she had her own life, her own plans, and he did all this without even asking her, making her feel like a child being arranged, without freedom, and this feeling was precisely what she disliked the most. 
Without saying anything more, she told him she would call him after work and then hung up the phone. 
It seems she really had to go back early, otherwise, she really didn’t know what her home would have been turned into. And Xiaobao, she didn’t know how Xiaobao was faring either.
###Chapter 135: Chapter 134 She Decided to Go Home by Herself
With this thought, she glanced at her watch then turned toward the service worker behind her, "Miss, I’d like to ask, what’s the most convenient way to get back to A City from here?" 
"To A City? Of course, it would be the high-speed train, but it’s so late now that you probably won’t be able to buy a ticket. The long-distance coach is a better option at this point." 
The long-distance coach? 
Ye Ning’s eyes lit up at the mention. 
Yes, the long-distance coach. Mucen always did as he pleased; who knew whether he would return today? 
Moreover, it seemed that President Xiao was ready to entertain him with great fanfare. Given these circumstances, she’d better find her own way back. 
So she spent the next while at the service desk, asking the worker in detail how to get to the long-distance bus station and then how to take the coach, meticulously writing down the information with pen and paper. 
Having noted down everything just in time, her phone, which was charging on the counter, rang. Quickly grabbing it, she answered while walking toward the dining area, "Hello, this is Ou..." 
"Brother Mucen, I heard you came to B City, is that right? Where are you now? I’m also in B City. I want to come and find you." 
"..." 
Determinedly, Ye Ning hurriedly stepped toward the dining table and handed over the phone, "Young Master, your call." 
Ou Mucen was in conversation with the man across from him. Hearing this, he took the phone from her hand without even looking, "Hello?" 
"Who are you? Why are you answering Brother Mucen’s phone? Who gave you permission to do that?" As soon as the phone reached his ear, an angry woman’s voice came from the other end. 
The mayor’s daughter, Chen Kexin? 
As soon as Ou Mucen heard this, his expression immediately darkened, "Who told you my number?" 
Chen Kexin was taken aback on hearing his voice, and instantly, her tone changed, "Brother Mucen, it’s you, it was the lady who told me. Brother Mucen, I just wanted to ask where you are, I happen to be in B City today too, I want to come to you." 
"No need!" With that, he was about to end the call. 
Chen Kexin on the other end of the phone became anxious as soon as she heard this, "Brother Mucen, I mean no harm, I just want to bring you the local specialties the lady asked me to buy here, so you can take them back to her. I won’t disturb you." noveldrama
"..." 
There was no sound. The man simply hung up the phone and threw it on the table. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning’s heart skipped a beat. 
Who was this person that could make him look so grim? Surely it wasn’t because she had answered a phone call she shouldn’t have? 
The domineering tone of that woman on the phone left her feeling unsettled... 
The middle-aged man opposite also sensed something was off and cautiously asked, "President Ou, is that... a friend coming to see you?" 
Ou Mucen lifted his glass from the table and took a sip, "No, didn’t you mention something about a show? Where should we go next?" 
A show? 
The man’s eyes sparkled, "Yes, yes, yes, I’ll take you to a great place, I guarantee you’ll be singing its praises once you’ve been." No sooner had he finished speaking than he had already stood up. 
Ye Ning realized there was trouble. 
See? She knew he wouldn’t go back that easily. What time was it already, and he still had a show to attend? 
Ye Ning gave up all hope. Watching the middle-aged man walk away, and Mucen, too, stood up to leave, she quickly followed a few steps behind.
###Chapter 136: Chapter 135: Ou Mucen, I’ve Resigned
"Ou Mucen, since you have other plans, I’ll head back first. You can carry these things yourself." After saying that, she handed over the laptop she was carrying. 
She was no longer an employee of the Ou Group, and there was no need to please him anymore. Naturally, he should carry the computer himself. 
Ou Mucen, who was walking toward the elevator, stopped and looked down at the laptop presented before him, showing no reaction, "What? Did your master come to pick you up?" 
Master? 
Ye Ning frowned, "What are you talking about? How could he possibly come all this way? I’ll take the bus back myself." 
"The bus?" 
"Yes, I’ve already asked the staff here, and they said it’s not far from here to the bus station by taxi, so I can just go there to catch the bus. You don’t need to worry." noveldrama
Ye Ning’s composure was still quite good. This man had turned her entire day into a mess, yet she could still stand in his shoes and tell him not to worry about her. 
But the fact is, a devil is a devil, and the word "worry" doesn’t exist in his eyes. 
Let alone feeling guilty. 
After giving her a cold glance, he said, "You’re overthinking it. I’m asking you, as an assistant, who allowed you to go back while the president’s work is not yet finished?" 
"What?" 
"Do you know the consequences of sneaking off? At the least, a deduction of a quarter’s bonus and this month’s salary. As for the worst, you could be thrown out of the company immediately!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
She was stunned for a full three seconds before exploding, "Ou Mucen, have you gotten amnesia? I’ve resigned already. I told you last night, I’m not working here anymore. That resignation letter is in your car right now!" 
"Is that so?" 
That man, upon hearing this, just casually glanced at his fingers, "And what of it? Until I, Ou Mucen, have not signed it, you’re still a legal employee of the Ou Group. If you breach the contract on your own, you’ll have to compensate." 
"What are you talking about? Compensate?" Ye Ning felt a rush of blood to her head, almost causing her vision to black out. 
Ou Mucen looked at her coldly, "Ms. An, didn’t you read the contract carefully before joining? Breaching the Ou Group’s employment contract requires compensation, especially for a position like yours, having signed a confidentiality agreement as the president’s assistant. Let’s see, you should compensate around fifty to sixty thousand." 
"..." 
Standing there like a statue, Ye Ning was rooted to the spot for a good ten seconds before she took off her slippers and, like a madwoman, hurled them at his retreating figure, "Ou Mucen! You bastard!!" 
Beast, scum, brute! 
Why doesn’t he just drop dead? 
-- 
In the lobby downstairs, the middle-aged man had been waiting for quite a while. When he saw only the president of the Ou Group coming out of the elevator, he was startled, "President Ou, where’s your assistant?" 
Ou Mucen stared at him emotionlessly, "The contract?" 
The contract? 
The man was a bit slow to react, "The contract is in my bag, I..." 
"Bring it here, find a quiet place and let’s get it signed." 
Huh? 
Signed... signed? 
Happiness came so rapidly that the middle-aged man hadn’t yet come to terms with it. 
Yes, that contract, it was of vital importance to the fate of his entire factory. Before signing, he had heard that the president of the Ou Group wasn’t an easy man to get a signature from, and he had gone to great lengths to ensure he could entertain him properly. 
But suddenly, within just half a day, he was now saying that he would sign it himself. 
The middle-aged man was overjoyed...
###Chapter 137: Chapter 136 The Mayor’s Daughter Arrives...
Ye Ning ultimately decided to stay at the villa, not because she was afraid of compensation issues, but because she felt that if she insisted on leaving at this time, with that bastard’s attitude just now, he would definitely not let her off easily. 
So, she couldn’t anger him, or else once he returned to the company and investigated that contract she was supposed to sign with a false name, things would become troublesome. 
Having decided to stay at the villa, someone took her to a leisure center and simply told her to wait there, saying that Ou Mucen would be back soon. 
Weren’t they supposed to go somewhere else? Why wait here? 
Ye Ning was a bit puzzled, but seeing that the leisure center had everything, she went to an outdoor café, ordered a coffee, and began to drink it slowly. 
"Have you guys heard? That big star Ou Ruola came, and she brought a very important guest." 
"Really? Wow, we’re in for a treat today then. Who’s the important guest?" 
"I don’t know, but it’s said to be a high-society debutante!" 
Ye Ning had just sat down when a few women nearby started gossiping, their actions exaggerated as they spoke. 
A big star? 
Ye Ning had just returned here and didn’t recognize the person they were talking about, but she still looked in the direction they were pointing and saw that the outdoor swimming pool not far from her was indeed very lively. 
It seemed that this villa was really nice; even big stars and high-society debutantes came here to play. It must be one of B City’s more upscale places. 
She lowered her head to continue her coffee when she noticed an unread message on her phone, so she opened it. 
"An Ning, where are you?" 
"..." 
It was Secretary Gao! 
He was actually sending her messages?!! 
Still furious, Ye Ning immediately started typing furiously in response: "I’m in B City. You asked me to deliver the car, and then that bastard dragged me to B City. Look at the mess you’ve caused!" 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
It wasn’t his fault, okay? He couldn’t stop what the president wanted to do. 
Besides, she’s supposed to be an assistant now, right? What’s the problem with following to B City? 
Secretary Gao felt aggrieved: "Miss An, let it go. You were just brought to B City, have you ever considered how I feel, being taken to Africa in an unguarded moment?" 
Ye Ning was at a loss for words! 
Secretary Gao continued: "Where are you? The president called me just now, asking you to send a file from his laptop to Xiao Shan." 
Damn! 
Couldn’t he call her himself? Did he have to send messages through his secretary, would he die from making a call to her? 
Ye Ning picked up the laptop beside her, feeling extremely irritable: "Why didn’t he call me himself? Isn’t he tired of beating around the bush?" 
Secretary Gao awkwardly laughed: "I haven’t saved your phone number in his phone yet, so he doesn’t know your number." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Forget it, no use talking to this oddball. Really, like boss, like underling. It seemed she really had to keep her distance from them in the future, or they would drag down her IQ too. 
She opened the laptop. Since she had already used it in the car, she easily accessed the screen and found the email. 
"Xiao Corporation..." noveldrama
"Hey, look, look, Ou Ruola is here, you guys hurry up and look." 
Just as she was leaning over the table searching for the company’s email, suddenly, the crowd stirred up, making even the outdoor café where she was chaotic.
###Chapter 138: Chapter 137: He’s also a magnet for hate
What’s going on here? 
Ye Ning saw the commotion and quickly hugged her notebook, which was on the table, to prevent it from being damaged by the crowd that kept streaming past her side. 
After all the people had passed by, she sat there and only then realized that right at the café where she had just come from, there were two young and beautiful women wearing sunglasses and sporting fashionable curly hair, walking towards her side surrounded by a large group of people. noveldrama
"Ou Ruola! Ou Ruola! I love you!!" 
"Ou Ruola..." 
"..." 
Ou Ruola? 
So she was the big star those people had been talking about. 
With her notebook clutched to her chest, Ye Ning saw the two women approaching and prepared to leave the place. 
She was not someone who enjoyed joining the crowd, let alone when it was so crowded and noisy. 
However, just as she was about to leave, she overheard someone speaking, "Have you notified the Ou Family’s third young master yet? No matter what, we must get him here, it’s the young mistress’s orders." 
The Ou Family’s third young master? 
And a young mistress too? 
Ye Ning instantly looked towards the speaker, only to realize that this person didn’t seem like a vacationer here at all; he was dressed in a black suit, wearing an earpiece, and appeared to be someone brought by the two women. 
So who exactly were these two women? 
Her eyes squinted slightly, and simultaneously, her gaze locked tightly onto the two individuals. 
Hearing that the ’Crown Prince’ must be brought over no matter what, the person standing next to the man in black nodded right away, "Don’t worry, we’ve already called the General Manager Xiao here, he’ll figure out a way to bring him over." 
"Good, remember, that’s his spot. If you handle this well, the young mistress won’t let you down." After saying that, Ye Ning only saw something being handed to him. 
What was that? 
Ye Ning’s heart skipped a beat, wanting to get a closer look, but at that moment, the person quickly ran off to the party venue that had been set up. 
So there Ye Ning stood, watching helplessly as he did something at the very front row and quickly disappeared.
This matter seemed far from simple; she had to find that bastard as soon as possible. 
She glanced at the woman who was heading towards that spot in the crowd, and without a moment’s hesitation, she turned and left. 
"Secretary Gao, where is the third young master?" 
"..." 
On the phone, Secretary Gao remained silent for a long time before replying weakly, "An Ning, as an assistant, it’s understandable that the president doesn’t have your number, but how can you not have your superior’s number?" 
Ye Ning hastily explained, "I haven’t called him, so I definitely didn’t save his number. Besides, I’ve only been here for three days, I..." 
"Alright, alright, let me make a call and ask. Once I find out, I will tell you, and I’ll send you his number as well." 
"Okay!" Ye Ning picked up on his displeasure and quickly agreed. 
After hanging up, Ye Ning felt the ache in her feet from being on the move all day and sat down on a flowerbed behind her. 
It seems Xiaobao was right; not a single person around this Ou Family scion was good news. She had been at the Ou Corporation for merely three days, and schemes against him were happening almost every day. 
It seems like his life isn’t easy either...
###Chapter 139: Chapter 138 Why does she want to save him?
Secretary Gao’s call came quickly enough, telling her that Ou Mucen was currently at the golf course, instructing her to go find him. 
The golf course? 
Ye Ning glanced at the map of the villa in her hands, noting that the so-called golf course was almost a kilometer away from here; she suddenly gasped in dismay. 
Does he have a problem? 
Why go so far for nothing? Doesn’t he know her foot hurts? 
She was fuming, initially contemplating not going, but then realized if something happened to him, she probably wouldn’t end up reaping any benefits. So, after a sigh, she could only drag her tired legs in the direction of the golf course. 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen was utterly unaware of what had transpired. After signing the contract, he checked his watch, noting that it was nearly 5 p.m., hence he got up, ready to leave. 
"Is Mr. Ou planning to leave now?" asked the middle-aged man sitting opposite him, hastily standing up. 
Ou Mucen nodded, slipping the signed contract into the folder, "There’s a bit of business at the company I need to take care of." 
This late and still work at the company? 
The middle-aged man followed him, "There’s no rush in this moment, is there? It’s almost 5 p.m. now. If you drive back, it will take at least two hours. Let’s go have dinner first, and then head back. Besides, you might handle it, but your assistant might not be able to withstand it. I noticed she didn’t eat much at noon and she’s injured as well. If she has to go back hungry, I fear she might not hold up." 
At these last words, Ou Mucen’s pace in packing up visibly slowed down. 
The middle-aged man was highly perceptive, and seeing Mucen’s hesitation, immediately signaled to his followers, quickly agreeing to accompany him. 
"Mr. Ou, it won’t be a long delay, just a meal. Oh, let’s go to the open-air swimming pool, shall we? The villa is hosting a gourmet salon today, which would be a great chance for Mr. Ou to try some delicacies and even provide us with some feedback." 
A gourmet salon? 
Ou Mucen looked toward the area indicated, and sure enough, even from this distance, he could hear the noise, so he agreed without further ado, "Hmm, bring my assistant over too." 
"Of course, Mr. Ou, I’ll arrange that immediately," the middle-aged man finally smiled. 
—— 
Fifteen minutes later, Ye Ning finally arrived at the golf course, but before she could enter the lounge, someone approached her from behind, "Excuse me, are you Miss An, Mr. Ou’s assistant?" 
Ye Ning turned around, "Yes, that’s me, who are you...?" 
"That’s fantastic, General Xiao sent me to pick you up; Mr. Ou is already waiting for you at the open-air swimming pool." noveldrama
"What did you say? The open-air swimming pool?" 
Ye Ning felt like vomiting up a mouthful of old blood! 
This damned bastard to be conned, after she had exerted so much effort with an injured leg to find him, and there he was, having delivered himself there already. 
What is this called? 
Karma? 
She remembered the threatening words he had said to her in the hallway not long ago and suddenly felt a deep satisfaction in her heart. She plopped down onto a flowerbed, determined not to move anymore. 
Good riddance, you beast, scumbag, who let him bully her like that? 
Ye Ning decided not to bother with the matter any further... 
"Miss An..." 
"Let me ask you, what kind of party are they throwing at that open-air swimming pool today? Who are the hosts?"
###Chapter 140: Chapter 139: Why Does She Want to Stop Him?
"Oh, that one? That’s owned by the big star Ou Ruola herself, nothing to do with our villa. I heard it was specially organized to entertain her good friends." 
Good friends? 
Ye Ning recalled the two women she had seen at the open-air cafe not long ago, feeling somewhat puzzled, "Good friends? The event seemed quite grand, they must be significant figures, right?" 
The person immediately laughed, "Of course, they are! I’ve heard that it’s the daughter of A City’s mayor. Quite a significant background indeed." 
What? 
The mayor’s daughter of A City? 
Upon hearing about this figure, Ye Ning momentarily froze in her expression again. 
The mayor’s daughter, had she heard about this person somewhere? 
She furrowed her brows, sitting there deep in thought for a long while, and finally, she remembered the person that Bai Tingfang mentioned last night while talking about his son in that scoundrel’s room. 
So, it turned out that this mayor’s daughter was the woman his son was set up with for a blind date. 
Thus, her real purpose for coming here was actually for Ou Mucen? 
She remembered the conversation she had overheard from the two men in black at the open-air cafe, as well as their sneaky actions, and finally, everything clicked into place. 
So, the mayor’s daughter came here to find her future husband, but what about that future husband’s attitude toward her? 
From last night’s conversation between him and Bai Tingfang, it was clear he didn’t really care much about her. Therefore, her coming here today must have had a purpose, and naturally, getting the uncooked rice to become cooked would be best. 
Ye Ning shuddered at the thought of the black-clothed man with earphones handing something over to another person to be slipped into a drink, "Well... go back and tell your boss Xiao, just say I won’t be going, I’ll wait here for our Mr. Ou."
"But..." 
"No buts, and right, give me that little electric scooter of yours, I’ll go back to your hotel later on my own." After speaking, Ye Ning already snatched away the villa’s simple shuttle vehicle from his hands. 
Are you kidding me? 
The would-be-couple had both families’ blessing; setting up a scenario where uncooked rice gets cooked is pretty common, isn’t it? 
Her brain wasn’t flooded; why should she interfere? 
Ye Ning pushed the electric scooter into the resting room and then found a comfortable place to take a nap inside. 
She was indeed very tired, having not rested since she came out in the morning, and her foot was still injured. Now that she had the chance, she might as well rest. 
Thus, as soon as she closed her eyes, she truly fell into a deep sleep, only to be awakened by the incessant ringing of her cellphone. 
"Hello..." 
"Where the hell have you been?" 
It was an almost roaring angry shout! noveldrama
Ye Ning jolted awake, immediately losing all drowsiness, "I... I’m at the golf course, Third Young Master, are you finished on your end?" 
"What did you say?" 
"I mean..." 
Ye Ning suddenly realized she made a grave slip of the tongue, so she hurriedly got up from the sofa with her phone, rushing outside, "No, I mean... are you done with your business?" 
Ou Mucen’s voice on the phone seemed off, but upon hearing this, he forcefully kept his rage at bay, "Who told you to go there? Get your ass over here now, I’m at the hotel entrance." 
"Okay, okay, on my way!" 
The freshly awakened Ye Ning had no clue what was going on. Hearing the order to head to the hotel entrance, she stepped on the electric scooter outside and hurried towards the hotel.
###Chapter 141: Chapter 140: He Looks So Scary!
Hotel entrance? 
Wasn’t he drugged by the mayor’s daughter? Then how could he be at the hotel entrance? Could it be that they’re done rolling in the sheets already? 
Ye Ning glanced at her watch and saw that she had been asleep for only half an hour, which she found unbelievable. 
She had hurried over from the golf course, and sure enough, just as she reached the entrance of the hotel she had entered before, she saw the black Bentley. Its tail lights were still on. 
It seemed he really was waiting for her. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning quickly abandoned the electric scooter, slung the laptop over her shoulder, and hurried over: "Third Young Master... " 
She had only called out when her eyes suddenly caught the person in the driver’s seat sitting ramrod straight, eyes tightly closed, his entire body rigid. She paused for a moment, taken aback. 
What happened to him? He hasn’t had an accident, has he? 
Worried, she hastened to knock on the car window: "Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen?" 
After knocking twice, fortunately, the person inside opened his eyes and, glancing over, upon seeing her, a flash of anger passed through his eyes before he opened the car door. 
Upon seeing this, Ye Ning quickly pulled open the door and climbed in: "Third Young Master, are you alright?" 
... 
No one answered. The only response she got was the car’s chillingly cold air conditioning and the sound of the engine starting. 
What was wrong with this person? 
Ye Ning watched as the car sped out of the villa with frightening speed, not daring to ask any more questions; she just sat there in the frighteningly cold car, watching him speed along the road. 
What was he doing, turning the air conditioning so low? She was about to turn into an ice block! 
Ye Ning hugged her T-shirt tightly as she could no longer bear it, and after about twenty minutes of driving, she cautiously whispered from behind, "Third Young Master, it’s a bit cold, could you please turn up the air conditioning?" 
"Shut your mouth!" 
With that one sentence, the man in front finally spoke, but his words were even colder than the air in the car. After he said that, Ye Ning immediately clammed up again. 
Alright, she would remain quiet, not saying anything more. 
She turned to look out the window, hoping to distract herself from the chilly drafts inside the car by looking at the scenery, but to her complete surprise, just as she turned her head, she felt a sudden jolt under her feet. Then, she saw the shadow of another car flying towards them from the window!
"Ah—Ou Mucen, be careful!!!" She screamed in fright. 
Ou Mucen’s eyes were already bloodshot, his ears ringing, and when he heard the scream, his pupils constricted. Seeing the approaching shadow, he abruptly swerved, managing to pull the car back into control. 
Damn it! 
Ye Ning behind him also sensed something was wrong and quickly looked into the rear-view mirror. She saw the man’s forehead was beet red, covered in a layer of fine sweat beads. Her face changed, and she grabbed the seat to stand up, "Ou Mucen, what’s wrong with you? Are you feeling unwell?" 
Ou Mucen felt like he was about to explode, particularly in the lower abdomen where he could hear the wild howling of desire! noveldrama
Suddenly hearing a woman’s voice from behind, he looked up, his eyes red as if aflame, staring at the woman in the rear-view mirror...
###Chapter 142: Chapter 142 Get out!!
But by this time, the man, completely befuddled by the drug, how could he possibly let go of her? 
Fuck! 
Ye Ning was startled, shuddering violently before she, looking at the bastard who was still frantically plundering her lips, finally let the rage in her eyes ignite and bit down hard on the lips that were fiercely pressing onto hers. 
"Mmm—" 
The intense pain finally made the man, who didn’t even know what he was doing, stop his movements. 
But when his consciousness slowly started to clear, and he opened his eyes to see the scene before him, to see their bloodied lips tightly pressed together, and then felt her in his hands, Ye Ning saw a moment of constriction in those beautiful pupils staring back at her. 
It’s over! noveldrama
Almost instantly, his hand retracted from her clothes as if electrocuted, and he threw her away from him. 
"Who told you to come over? Speak, who was it?!" 
It was a roar akin to that of a wild beast, filled with his anger, embarrassment, and shock. Once released, it buzzed throughout the car. 
Ye Ning felt like her waist was about to break! 
She was already pulled over by his hasty tug when the car had to stop suddenly, and now being thrown by him, naturally, she hit the armrest box. How could it not hurt? 
Hearing him still furious at this point, Ye Ning, who had been molested for no reason, finally became enraged herself, "Who else could it be? You dragged me over like a mad dog, and you still have the face to ask who it was?" 
"What did you say? Say it again?" 
"I’ll say it a million times over; Ou Mucen, you’re a bastard, a hooligan, a beast. I’m going to the police to accuse you of rape!!" Ye Ning was truly furious, violated by this lunatic for no reason, and to top it off, he had the audacity to question her, to push her away. Did he really think he was the Emperor? That he could do whatever he wanted? 
After retorting, there was silence in the car, but the atmosphere became completely suffocating. 
"Get out—" 
"What did you say?" 
"I said get out!!!" 
The man who had been silent for a few seconds finally exploded, opening the car door. He had no intention of negotiating and directly threw her bag out of the window! 
Ye Ning was stunned, staring at her bag that had been thrown out. She stared at him for a full five seconds before her eyes reddened with fury, and her fists clenched tight, "Fine, I’ll leave, I’m leaving right now!" 
Having said that, she pushed the car door and got out without hesitation. 
Yes, she might be lowly, but that did not mean she could be insulted and trampled upon by anyone. Today, he had her thrown out; from now on, she would never acknowledge this man again. 
After getting out of the car, she hadn’t even picked up her bag from the ground when the car sped away like an arrow released from a bow. 
She watched it go and sneered coldly, then composed herself and picked up her bag, looking around at the surroundings of the highway. 
By now, the twilight sky had darkened... 
PS: Is nobody watching? Say something in the comments, I need some motivation...
###Chapter 143: Chapter 143 She Lied...
Lin Yebai was still calling Ye Ning, but what unsettled him was that her phone was turned off! 
By this time, it had become completely dark outside. 
"Uncle Lin, could something have happened to my mom?" Ye Xiaobao also sensed that something was amiss and came over to ask with concern. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Yebai quickly put away his phone, "No, nothing will happen. Uncle is here, and I will go pick up your mom right away. You just stay at home and be good. Shall I ask Aunt Xiaoyu to keep you company?" 
Ye Xiaobao nodded, "Okay, be careful, Uncle." 
Ye Xiaobao had a lot of trust in Uncle Lin. The man had been a big help to him and his mother ever since he was young, so when he said he would pick up his mom, Xiaobao naturally believed him. 
But the question was, was he really going to the company to pick up his mom? 
When Ye Xiaobao left, he saw him take out his phone and open a software application... 
—— 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning was stranded on the highway and couldn’t flag down a car. 
The place where she was dropped off was on the main thoroughfare of the highway, and there, it was too dangerous for people to stop their cars to give her a lift, especially as night was falling, the drivers, seeing a woman standing there alone, would think it was a scam. 
So, it was quite normal that she couldn’t get a ride. 
Seeing that she wasn’t able to flag down a car, she had no choice but to walk back in the direction she came from. 
Fortunately, the place where she was dropped off was not far onto the highway, so after walking for a bit over an hour, she came off the highway and found a nearby small town. 
Once in town, thinking of her child waiting at home and Lin Yebai who had been urging her to return, she quickly found a phone and dialed out as soon as she could. 
"Hello? Is this Big Brother Lin? This is Aning." 
"Aning? Where exactly are you? Why was your phone off?" 
The man on the other end immediately began with anxious questions as soon as the call connected, his tone carrying a hint of irritation. 
Being a smart woman, Ye Ning knew he must have gone to the company looking for her, so she didn’t hide anything and explained, "I’m sorry, Big Brother Lin, today... I actually went on a business trip with Ou Mucen. I’m now in B City." 
"And then? Aren’t you planning to come back tonight?" 
The person on the call didn’t seem surprised by her explanation, but instead just asked indifferently if she planned to return. 
Ye Ning paused for a moment, and after looking around at the unfamiliar surroundings, she said apologetically, "He’s not finished negotiating, so I probably won’t return tonight, Big Brother Lin, I’m really sorry, I..." 
"It’s fine, just focus on your work. I will take care of Xiaobao." With that, the phone on the other end was abruptly hung up. 
Ye Ning stood there for a long time before finally hanging up the phone as well... 
Big Brother Lin is angry, right? He had never hung up on her before. 
Ye Ning felt uneasy and somewhat frustrated, but what she didn’t know was that at that very moment when she was making the call, the man had just reached the highway toll booth on his way to B City. 
So she really was with Ou Mucen! noveldrama
With a stomp on the brake, the white Audi that had been speeding down the asphalt aggressively came to a sudden stop... 
After hanging up the phone, Ye Ning saw that night had fully fallen, looked around, and noticed a hotel not far away. Carrying her bag and limping, she made her way toward it.
###Chapter 144: Chapter 144: Miss An, there’s a man looking for you!
Since things had come to this, the only option was to find a place to stay for the night and figure out a way to get back when daylight came. 
"Excuse me, do you still have rooms available?" 
"Yes, would you like a single or a double room?" 
"A single room will do!" 
Ye Ning handed over her ID and money. After receiving the key card, she could barely hold on any longer and collapsed onto a chair at the hotel’s front desk. 
Seeing this, the innkeeper grew concerned, "My goodness, miss, your foot injury seems quite severe; look, it’s bleeding again. Let me go get some medicine for you." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s eyes suddenly filled with tears, and she almost started crying, "Thank you so much." noveldrama
She indeed needed medicine. Her foot had been hurting ever since she got off the highway, the wound had reopened. 
Fortunately, the innkeeper was a caring person. After seeing the state of her foot, not only did he buy the medicine for her, but he also helped her change the dressing and bandages before finally assisting her to the room she had booked. 
"Young lady, where are you headed? Why did you come here all by yourself?" 
Upon entering the room, the innkeeper naturally asked this question out of concern for her. 
Hearing this, Ye Ning didn’t conceal anything, "I’m heading back to A City. My car broke down. Do you know how to get back?" 
"For that, you’ll need to take a bus from here to B City’s bus station. Then, from there, you can catch a coach back to A City. Otherwise, there’s no direct transportation from here." 
"..." 
Sitting there, Ye Ning struggled for a full five seconds before managing to suppress the murderous urge rising in her chest. 
That bastard, she would definitely not let him off the hook! 
After the innkeeper left her in her room, Ye Ning quickly freshened up and lay down on the bed fully clothed, planning to get through the night and then take a bus to B City first thing in the morning and catch the coach home. 
But as she lay on the bed, half-asleep, she thought she heard someone talking outside, "Sir, I’ve told you many times, it’s very late now. If you’re looking for that young lady, you’ll disrupt her rest." 
"..." 
Then, no one else seemed to speak, but there were disordered footsteps entering. Since the inn wasn’t very well-built and had poor sound insulation, Ye Ning could hear some noises from inside. 
She heard the footsteps enter and couldn’t tell what they said to the landlady, but afterward, there was the sound of high heels moving along the corridor towards her room. 
Possibly, there was some matter? 
She thought this to herself and decided not to worry about it, instead hugging the thin blanket, ready to continue sleeping, 
But right then, there was a knock on her door, "Ms. Ye? Ms. Ye, are you asleep?" 
Was it the innkeeper’s wife? 
Ye Ning opened her eyes and switched on the bedside lamp, "I was about to sleep. Is there something you need?" 
"Well, there’s someone here looking for you. Would you like to come out and meet him?" 
Someone was looking for her? 
Ye Ning, still groggy from sleep, wasn’t entirely able to grasp the situation. 
In this place, she had just arrived; who would be looking for her? 
She pondered a moment, then suddenly remembered the phone call she had hung up on not long before. Instantly, a feeling of astonishment mixed with disbelief surged up from the bottom of her heart. 
Lin Yebai? 
Could it be him? He had actually come looking for her?
###Chapter 145: Chapter 145: God, how could it be this bastard?
She was a bit startled and quickly got out of bed, shuffling over in her slippers to open the door, "Where is he?" 
The owner hastily pointed outside, "He’s at the front desk. He wanted to come find you, but I told him it was too late and you might be asleep, so he’s been waiting there. Then I came to call you." 
The owner of the hotel was truly kind. Even though Ye Ning was just a guest, the owner went out of her way to ensure her safety, which was indeed rare.
Ye Ning looked at her gratefully and followed her toward the front desk. 
Lin Yebai—to seek her out at this time, who else could it be but him? After all, in this place, he was the only one who would care about her so much. 
But if it really was him, how did he find her? She hadn’t told him where she was staying, had she? noveldrama
Could it be... he had always known her whereabouts? 
A flash of discomfort suddenly struck Ye Ning’s heart! 
With a frown furrowing her brow, she made her way to the front desk. Indeed, before she even arrived, she caught sight of a figure sitting there, with his legs spread apart, leaning forward, hands propped on his thighs in a very dominant and imposing posture. 
Yet, it was clear that the posture stemmed from extreme fatigue. 
This person was... 
"Miss An, this gentleman is looking for you," the owner said just as she noticed the figure and pointed towards him. 
Ye Ning stood there and was taken aback! 
My God, how could it be him?!! 
Similarly, the man sitting there heard the voice and turned his head. Seeing the woman brought out by the owner of the hotel, he indeed recognized her as the one he was looking for. He swept a cold glance at her from beneath his sopping wet hair and stood up from the chair. 
"Sir, is she the one you’re looking for?" 
"Cancel her room; here is her room fee," he said without any superfluous words, taking a wallet out of his pocket, extracting several soaked RMB notes, and handing them to the owner of the hotel. 
The owner was stunned and turned to look at the girl who had followed her, seeing that she too was gaping at the young man. She didn’t know what to do, "Miss An, this..." 
Ye Ning opened her mouth, finally coming to her senses, "It’s alright, ma’am. He is my company’s boss. I’ll talk to him." After saying that, she walked over to him. 
This truly was a huge surprise. She had thought the person coming for her was Lin Yebai, but she had never expected that it would be this jerk who had abandoned her on the highway not long ago. 
So, was his conscience pricking him now? Was he worried something might happen to her, and so he had come back to find her? 
Ye Ning walked over and saw him standing there, drenched from head to toe, looking like he had just been fished out of water, utterly disheveled. His eyes conveyed a deep fatigue and a pale complexion. Ultimately, she lowered her tone. 
"Why did you come back? And what happened to you?" 
That’s right, what was with his drenched appearance? Had there been a downpour on the road? 
But he had a car, and even if it rained heavily, he wouldn’t get soaked, right? 
Ye Ning was somewhat baffled! 
But what about this man? 
She wished she hadn’t asked. The question seemed to make his already dreadful complexion even more ghastly, "It’s none of your business. What you need to do now is cancel the room, get in the car and come back with me."
###Chapter 146: Chapter 146: He is Childish Like a Kid
Still so domineering! 
Is this the attitude of someone who has done something wrong and is coming to apologize? 
Ye Ning also got angry. After she yanked the room card toward herself, she glared at him fiercely, "Why should I check out? I finally found a place to rest my feet. I’m exhausted, and I want to get a good sleep. I’ll leave tomorrow." 
"Say that again?" 
"I’ll say it a hundred times if necessary. It’s so late now, and you still want me to go back with you. You might not care about your life, but I do. If you want to leave, then go ahead. I’m not leaving." After she finished speaking, she took her room card and turned to walk back. 
Ou Mucen stood there and when he saw this, he was so angry that he stretched out his hand and grabbed her, "Are you going to check out or not?" 
Ye Ning was very stubborn, "I won’t! I’d rather die than check out!" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Suddenly, it seemed like a surge of blood rushed to his head, causing a ringing in his ears, and his vision darkened. noveldrama
"Ou Mucen——" When Ye Ning saw this, she shouted urgently and quickly supported his collapsing body. 
God, why is his body so cold? 
Ye Ning looked at him in surprise, "Ou Mucen, you..." 
"Let go!" 
Ou Mucen steadied himself and, upon seeing it was that woman supporting him, his fury soared and he pushed her away. 
An ungrateful woman. He had come to pick her up, and she still refused to go with him? 
Fine, very well! 
From now on, even if she died, it would have nothing to do with him. 
Ou Mucen shook his somewhat groggy head, didn’t even glance at her, turned around, and left the hotel without looking back. 
Ye Ning stood watching from behind, frozen in place... 
What on earth is wrong with this guy? Just now, she clearly saw his very poor complexion and his condition. 
Ye Ning started to worry a little. Although he didn’t leave a good impression in her heart, the fact that he had suddenly come back to find her, especially in such a poor mental state, extinguished the previous anger in her heart. 
So, seeing him leave, she came back to her senses, and she heard the sound of a sedan’s engine starting outside. She hurriedly rushed out from the hotel and stood in front of the departing black Bentley sedan. 
"Have you lost your mind? Move out of the way!" 
"You’re the one who’s lost it. Look at yourself, and look at the time. Are you sure you won’t get into an accident driving tonight?" 
"What did you say?" 
"I’m saying..." 
Ye Ning stood in front of the car, took a deep breath, and finally, word by word, "Let’s leave tomorrow morning. We can leave together in the morning." 
This was the first time she had spoken to him so earnestly. 
The man in the car heard this and his eyes slightly paused, frozen in place... 
So, was she showing concern for him? 
Seeing that he remained silent, Ye Ning quickly moved from the front of the car to his window, "Think about it, it’s so dark out, and you’re not in good shape. My foot hurts terribly. Wouldn’t it be better if we rested for the night and left tomorrow? Besides, you can’t work now anyway, you’d just be going back to sleep, so what difference does it make where you sleep? Right?" 
Ye Ning really felt she was too kind. Not long ago, this bastard had abandoned her on the highway, but now, for his safety, for his life, she was coaxing him as if he were Ye Xiaobao. 
In this world, was there any other woman who could be as magnanimous as her? 
Ye Ning looked at him full of hope.
###Chapter 147: Chapter 147: What Are You Doing in My Room?
But what infuriated her once again was this jerk, even though she spelled it out for him, he merely gave a cold stare at the small hotel behind her, then, not without irony, "Is that a place fit for people to stay?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Suddenly, she really wanted to slap herself! 
She was really asking for it, why the hell did she bother with him? Let him die for all she cared, he had nothing to do with her, did he? 
Ye Ning turned around and left, and on her way back, she didn’t spare this bastard another glance. 
When she arrived at the hotel, the landlady was also looking out the door. Seeing her return alone, she hurriedly asked, "Young lady, is your boss still planning to leave?" 
Ye Ning’s face turned cold: "Don’t worry about her, rest assured, I won’t check out, I’m going back to my room now." 
"Okay, good, I’ll bring you a pot of boiling water!" 
The landlady felt relieved upon hearing this and took a pot of boiling water from the service desk to her. 
Ye Ning didn’t delay and took it back to her room. 
She wasn’t so bad-tempered, but after her kindness was taken for donkey’s liver and lungs, she couldn’t accept it. What’s more, that bastard wasn’t a good person to begin with, having bullied her several times already. 
So, when she returned to her room, she didn’t think about anything else. After drinking a cup of water, she took off her shoes and got back into bed. 
Truth be told, her feet were really hurting... 
But unexpectedly, after she lay down, she didn’t know why, but she just couldn’t fall asleep. She tossed and turned as if there was some unease in her heart, preventing her from sleeping. 
That bastard, he didn’t really drive off, did he? 
She remembered how he suddenly lurched towards her before getting into the car, then recalled his completely drenched body. Annoyed, she felt even less like sleeping. 
It was right then, suddenly, her room door "click"ed, and someone pushed it open from outside. 
Oh my God! 
Who was that? noveldrama
Startled by the noise, she immediately sat up in bed: "Who’s there?" 
Nobody responded to her, but she was met by the tall silhouette slowly walking in through the dim light—straight, tall, elegant, and noble—except for that cool, damp smell in the air. 
What’s going on? 
Ye Ning sat there, suddenly stunned. 
At that moment, that person seemed to stumble on something, bending over suddenly, "Shit!!" 
That voice... 
Ye Ning recognized it instantly and turned on the light: "Ou Mucen, are you okay?" 
Indeed, the person who had just entered was none other than the jerk who refused to come in earlier, even saying this place wasn’t fit for people to stay! 
Seeing the light finally on, the man who had stubbed his knee, Mucen, immediately glared fiercely at the woman on the bed: "Are you sick or what? Why would you sleep with the lights off?" 
Ye Ning opened her mouth... 
Isn’t that what people do when they sleep, turn off the lights? 
Besides, wasn’t the light switch right behind the door? Couldn’t he have turned it on himself? 
Ye Ning was close to being stupefied by his unreasonableness. Seeing him still bending over, she hurried down from the bed, bustling over: "Then you should have called out to me when you came in, and I would have turned the light on for you." 
At those words, the man squatting there immediately shot her a livid glance: "Are you deaf? Do I still need to call you?" 
Ye Ning: "..."
###Chapter 148: Chapter 148 Something happened...
Forget it, no point in arguing with him, especially considering the state he bumped into. 
So she walked over and supported him, and the two started heading into the room... 
The room was indeed small since it was a hotel. There was hardly any furniture except for the bed, and even the side shoe cabinet Mucen had bumped into earlier was just for show. 
No wonder he had bumped into it. 
Ye Ning helped him over, initially wanting him to sit on a chair, but considering his obsession with cleanliness, she could only let him sit on her own bed, "Why did you come back in? Didn’t you say this place wasn’t fit for people to live?" 
"..." 
Ou Mucen took a glance at the facilities in the room, his expression as gloomy as it could be, "Do you think this is a place fit for people?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Resigned, she poured him a glass of water, "Fine, it isn’t fit for people. But Third Young Master, there’s no other place available here." 
As things had progressed to this point, Ye Ning had actually gotten a sense of his temperament. That was, when he was angry, you mustn’t go against him. Otherwise, it would only make him more irritable and nasty. 
Sure enough, hearing her agree with his opinion made his face look less unpleasant. noveldrama
"We’re leaving first thing tomorrow!" 
"..." 
Ye Ning looked up at him, and even though his entire demeanor showed his disgust and intolerance of the surrounding environment, at this moment, he didn’t make any more demands. After saying that, he just sat there stiffly. 
Suddenly, something softened inside her. Holding the glass of water, she offered, "Then do you want to take a shower? You’re all wet!" 
Ou Mucen gave her a cold look and didn’t take the water, "Mind your own business, sleep!" 
Ye Ning was choked up! 
This man really was... 
Forget it, she wasn’t going to serve him anymore. How he acted was up to him! 
So Ye Ning stopped bothering with him and truly lay down on the only chair in the room, fully clothed. 
In fact, it was a subtle feeling. She was clearer than anyone about who this man was—a pampered child of fortune, clothed in silk and brocade, a high and mighty figure in A City. It was completely normal for someone like him to think of such a place as a dump, not worth mentioning. 
Yet tonight, he had come here. Maybe it was because he himself felt he couldn’t hold up any longer. Or maybe it was because of the things she had said. 
But no matter what, he was here now, and her heart was at ease. Before this, she hadn’t even realized that the restlessness which had kept her from sleeping was actually because of him. 
Lying on that chair, she soon fell into a deep sleep, as if finally breathing a sigh of relief. She slept remarkably soundly. 
She was once again woken up by the noise, this time by the sound of running water, pouring down like a waterfall. Startled, she immediately woke up! 
"Ou Mucen?" 
As she opened her eyes, she first looked towards the bed and discovered that it was empty; the constant sound of splashing water came from the bathroom, though, there seemed to be no sign of movement inside. 
What’s going on? 
She felt that something was not right, so she immediately got up from the chair and walked towards the bathroom, "Ou Mucen? Mucen, are you in there?" 
No one answered; the only response was the incessant sound of water. 
This is bad, what if something has happened to him? 
Remembering how he had looked when he came to find her at the hotel, she quickly kicked the bathroom door open...
###Chapter 149: Chapter 149 He’s got a fever!
Indeed, as soon as she kicked the door open, she saw the faucet at the washbasin running, and next to that washbasin, there was someone. However, he wasn’t in any trouble, he was just standing there! 
His hands were propped on the washstand as he stood there with his head lowered. 
Ye Ning felt a bit embarrassed, "Ou Mucen, I..." 
Before she could finish, the man suddenly swayed where he stood. She was startled and hurried over to support him, "Ou Mucen, are you alright?" 
"Help me... back to the room!" He tried to keep his voice calm, but in truth, when this woman rushed over, his entire weight had already shifted onto her. 
It was then that Ye Ning finally felt the burning temperature of his body and the gasping breaths through his nose and mouth, as if he were trying to light a brazier. 
Could he be sick? 
She supported him, leading him out of the bathroom, and nearly as soon as they reached the bed, he collapsed onto it, almost crushing her beneath him. 
"Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen, how are you feeling?" Once again feeling his scorching body heat, Ye Ning started to panic. She got up from beside him and reached out to touch his forehead. 
As expected, it was very hot! 
She came to a realization and quickly stood up from the bed. 
She should have thought of it earlier—when he arrived, he was already not himself, drenched all over. As he was leaving, he staggered, nearly falling onto her. And at that moment, when she touched him, his body was terribly cold. 
Ye Ning glanced at the man who had quickly lost consciousness on the bed, then hurriedly slipped into her slippers and dashed out the door, "Manager, is there a doctor here? My boss is sick with a high fever." 
The innkeeper immediately stood up at the news, "A doctor? No, what time is it now? The clinic is already closed. You should go buy some medicine." 
"Is the pharmacy still open?" 
"Yes, it’s open until midnight. You still have twenty minutes if you go now. Hurry up." The innkeeper’s wife also became anxious, pulling out a flashlight and handing it to her. 
Seeing that, Ye Ning didn’t waste any more time. She took the flashlight and rushed to find the pharmacy. 
Caring for a sick person was not unfamiliar to her; Xiaobao had been often ill since birth due to her not taking care during pregnancy. Back then, she frequently took care of him, even staying up all night to do so. 
Thus, upon hearing that the pharmacy was still open, she felt somewhat less panicked. She hurried on her way, ignoring the pain of her own injury, and made it to the pharmacy. 
Really, how could such a grown man carelessly get soaked in the rain? She was abandoned on the highway and hadn’t given up hope, so why would he act like a lunatic and do something so foolish? 
Ye Ning was full of complaints by the time she found the pharmacy. 
Fortunately, it indeed hadn’t closed, so she bought a box of cold medicine and antibiotics, along with a thermometer, before heading back. 
Back at the inn, the innkeeper’s wife had not gone to bed. Seeing Ye Ning return, she quickly brought over a kettle of hot water, "I thought there was something wrong with your boss earlier—he was all wet. He must have caught a chill. Change his clothes for him, have him drink more water, and getting the cold out should do the trick." 
Ye Ning: "..." noveldrama
That’s right, that jerk, why didn’t he change his clothes? Soaking wet and still wearing them, serves him right to be sick to death! 
Ye Ning carried the kettle of hot water back, her mood worse than just bad.
###Chapter 150: Chapter 150 Miss An, he will catch a cold
But when she pushed open the door and saw the person lying inside, his entire handsome face flushed with fever, she couldn’t think of anything else. Her face turned red as she peeled off his clothes and replaced them with a bathrobe from the room. 
Of course, she would never dare to change his pants! 
Are you kidding? He was an unmarried man, and she was a single mother. There were boundaries between men and women, how could she do such a thing for him? 
After changing his clothes, she took out the medicine and helped him sit up from the bed, "Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen, wake up and take your medicine." 
Ou Mucen was so feverish that he was groggy, not even aware of what he was doing. Propped up by her, he just gave her a dazed look and obediently swallowed the pill she gave him. 
Ye Ning was surprised! 
This bastard, actually so compliant? That really was rare. 
She remembered how she had constantly been bullied by him lately, felt a bit of vindictive satisfaction, and after forcefully giving him a couple more sips of water, she finally put him back down and tucked him in. 
By the time she had finished everything, it was already late. She glanced at the person lying on the bed and didn’t dare to sleep, worried that his fever might return. So, she simply took the clothes he had taken off and went to wash them in the bathroom. 
He only had that one set of clothes, if she didn’t wash them tonight, what would he wear tomorrow? 
Who knows, such a clean freak as he might explode the first thing tomorrow when he sees he’s wearing a bathrobe from this place. noveldrama
With that in mind, she hurriedly began washing the clothes in the sink... 
In the middle of the night, because of the medicine, the man whose breathing finally stabilized was a relief for Ye Ning, and she curled up in the chair, eventually falling asleep. 
—— 
The next morning, Ye Ning didn’t wake up very early. Due to staying up the previous night, her sleep was quite deep until the bright morning sunlight shone through the window, hitting her face, making her eyelids flutter before she slowly opened her eyes. 
Goodness, what time was it? 
Seeing the sun hanging high outside the window, her brain snapped awake all at once! 
She hurriedly climbed out of the chair and looked towards the bed, intending to check on how the man who had had a fever all night was doing. To her surprise, when she looked over, she discovered that there was nobody on the bed. 
Huh? 
Where was that bastard? 
She stood up, "Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen, are you awake?" 
"..." 
There was no one. No one was in the room, neither in the bathroom nor anywhere else. The man seemed to have already left. 
Dammit! 
He didn’t really leave, did he? 
Ye Ning, seeing nothing in the room that belonged to him, felt a surge of anger rise from the bottom of her heart. 
She picked up the room phone to call out, and upon hearing the voice inside, she immediately asked, "Boss, I’m the guest in Room 102, did the gentleman who stayed with me last night leave?" 
"No, he said he was going out to get some gas. Are you awake?" 
Getting gas? 
Ye Ning’s anger subsided upon hearing this. 
So he went to get gas... 
That meant he must have recovered quite well to be able to drive and get gas himself. 
Ye Ning’s mood finally improved again. She went into the bathroom to quickly freshen up, sorted out the things in the room, and came out to see, indeed, the black Bentley had returned outside the hotel.
###Chapter 151: Chapter 151: The Call Lin Yebai Made Was Answered by Him!
"Are you okay now?" Seeing the car return, Ye Ning quickly walked over and stood in front of his window to ask. 
He did indeed look more spirited than last night, and he had changed his clothes, wearing the shirt she had washed for him the previous night. She had washed it and, worried it wouldn’t dry, had even used a hairdryer on it for quite a while before hanging it up. 
However, Ye Ning had been standing in front of his car window for a long time, and the glass didn’t slide down; upon closer inspection, she realized that he was on the phone inside. 
Seeing this, she stopped asking, went back to the inn, checked out, and paid for the room before asking, "Boss, where around here can you get breakfast?" 
"For breakfast, there’s a market not far ahead where they sell it, but it’s all street food. I’m not sure if your boss has the habit of eating such things?" 
The innkeeper was a shrewd person. After witnessing last night’s events, he could tell that this girl’s boss was no ordinary man; ordinary stuff hardly caught his eye.
Ye Ning smiled awkwardly... 
Indeed, but if he didn’t want to eat, she needed to. She couldn’t stand being hungry, and her stomach wasn’t strong. 
So, after getting into the car, and seeing that the man making the phone call in front had just put down his phone, she asked from behind him, "Ou Mucen, do you want to have breakfast?" 
"No!" 
His refusal was indeed swift and decisive! 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning disdainfully glanced at the back of his head, "Then stop for a moment when we pass by the market. I want to eat. I’ll go buy something and come back." 
Ou Mucen glanced at her emotionlessly through the rearview mirror and didn’t say anything. He started the car and headed towards the market. 
Seeing that, Ye Ning felt relieved. Thus, while the car was moving, she took her phone out of her bag, preparing to make a call back home to inquire about the situation there. 
But, as soon as she turned on her phone and opened the call log, she discovered that there was an answered call - and it was Lin Yebai’s!! 
"My phone..." 
"Your phone has been ringing nonstop since six in the morning. It was so incessant that I couldn’t stand it and had to answer," he said indifferently, as if knowing what she was about to say. 
As soon as Ye Ning heard this, she was on the verge of anger, "How could you just answer my phone? Do you know that’s impolite?" 
Politeness? 
The man driving in front sneered, "Take a look at how many missed calls are on your phone. Early in the morning, it bombarded me in a harassing manner. You call that polite?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
She quickly scrolled through her phone and saw indeed, there were over a dozen missed calls in her log! 
Really, this Brother Lin... 
Ye Ning’s face finally began to show some embarrassment, "Then... when you answered his call, what did he say?" 
Ou Mucen’s expression was blank, "Nothing much. Just asked when you’re returning." 
That simple? 
Ye Ning was somewhat incredulous of his words, but in fact, the call Ou Mucen received that morning really only involved that one question as soon as he heard his voice. 
Moreover, the caller had been rather polite! 
Right, how could he not be polite? He’s her BOSS. His call to her had been answered by him, so as a smart man, he must have also realized that he had seen the dozen or so missed calls he made. noveldrama
Remembering the rushed sound of the phone being hung up, a trace of scorn curled on Ou Mucen’s lips.
###Chapter 152: Chapter 152 Pride Leads to Suffering
Ye Ning hadn’t seen his expression, and the moment she heard that Lin Yebai’s phone call was answered by this man, she’d already felt uneasy. It wasn’t for any particular reason other than not knowing how to explain it to him once she got back. 
"Lin Brother, he wouldn’t get angry, would he?" 
She gripped her own mobile phone, intending to send him a message explaining the situation, but after much thought, she realized that her explanation might only lead to more misunderstandings. So it seemed better not to explain at all. noveldrama
As Ye Ning thought this over, she ultimately decided to let it be. Just then, they reached the market, and she asked the man to stop the car and got out to buy breakfast. 
"Are you really not going to eat?" she asked again with a hint of hopelessness when she got out of the car. 
But the man in the car, after seeing the messy and crowded environment around, was already in a bad mood, "If you’re going to buy, do it quickly. I don’t have time to dawdle with you here!" 
Ye Ning heard him and didn’t bother with a response, heading straight to buy breakfast. 
If he didn’t want to eat, that was his problem. In any case, it wasn’t she who was hungry. A person like him deserved to starve or fall sick! 
"Boss, how much are these pancakes?" 
"Two yuan each, and there’s soy milk as well, one and a half yuan per cup." 
Things in small cities were cheap yet authentic. Ye Ning, enticed by the inviting aroma, promptly bought her breakfast and was ready to leave when she saw, out of the corner of her eye, an auntie selling fresh milk. After a moment’s hesitation, she decided to buy a bottle before heading back. 
Upon returning to the car, the man inside seemed to have grown impatient. Seeing her carrying bags of food, he spoke with a stern face, "Don’t make a mess in my car." 
Ye Ning placed the soy milk and the cow’s milk on the armrest between the seats, unabashedly defying him, "Or what? You want to wait here until I’ve finished eating before getting back in?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
After a moment, he slammed the accelerator, and the car shot off at a speed of 100 miles per hour... 
Since when had this woman dared to speak to him like this? Had she forgotten who she was? 
Driving on the freeway, both occupants settled into silence, and upon noticing the speed had stabilized, Ye Ning opened the pancake she’d bought and started to eat in the car. 
And it was really delicious. The tantalizing aroma seemed to seduce the taste buds and soon filled the entire car with its scent. Especially considering the Bentley’s exceptional sealing, the fragrance didn’t dissipate but instead lingered and wafted throughout the cab... 
The aroma drifted to a point that even the man who was driving couldn’t help but glance at the cursed woman behind him several times through the rearview mirror! 
Ye Ning didn’t look up. She kept eating and browsing web pages on her phone. 
After all, she wasn’t driving or busy with anything else. Enjoying her breakfast while surfing the web was a perfect moment for her. 
Before she was halfway through her breakfast, the man in front suddenly snapped, "Throw it out!" 
"Huh?" 
Ye Ning looked up, clearly not catching on immediately, "Throw it out? What do you mean, ’throw it out’?" 
Ou Mucen’s face was dark as thunder, "The thing in your hand. Otherwise, get out of my car!" 
Here we go again!! 
Ye Ning looked at the pancake in her hand, wanting to say something, but then she caught sight of his gloomy face in the rearview mirror and understood. 
"I haven’t finished eating yet. Why do you want me to throw it away? Ou Mucen, let me tell you, skipping breakfast is bad for your stomach. Especially for someone like you who just had a fever last night, it’s even worse. Here, have some — I bought soy milk and cow’s milk. Which one do you want?"
###Chapter 153: Chapter 153 Xiaobao is Sent to the Hospital
She really wasn’t afraid of him anymore. When he asked her to throw things away, not only did she refuse to throw them away, but she also started lecturing him. 
Ou Mucen’s face darkened even more: "I won’t eat it!" 
Ye Ning stopped looking at him and took the bottle of milk: "Don’t worry, this milk is clean. It’s fresh milk sold by others, and it’s nothing else, just some hydration. You’ve just recovered from an illness, you might not want to eat, but you still need to replenish fluids. I’ll leave it here for you." 
After saying that, she opened the bottle of milk and placed it in the storage compartment next to him. 
She knew that his refusal to eat was due to a couple of reasons. One was his concern about the cleanliness of the food, and the other was that he had a fever last night and probably really didn’t have an appetite. 
Luckily, after she had said this, the man driving in front didn’t say anything else. 
So she lowered her head and quickly finished the flatbread she held, then opened her WeChat... 
Qiao Feiyu: "Ningning, where the hell were you last night? My brother was looking for you!" 
Qiao Feiyu: "Ye Ning, you’re done for. You didn’t come home last night, and my brother looked terrible." 
Qiao Feiyu: "Ancestor, when the hell are you coming back? The murderous vibe here is almost freezing me." 
Qiao Feiyu: "..." 
All the messages were from Qiao Feiyu, rushing her and telling her about her brother’s reaction to her not returning home. 
Ye Ning saw this and suddenly felt irritable. She quickly typed a few times and sent a few words: "Xiaoyu, was your brother looking for me all night last night?" 
After the WeChat message was sent, within five seconds, the phone suddenly rang. She looked and saw that it was indeed Qiao Feiyu calling. 
"Hello?" 
"Holy shit! Ye Ning, you dead woman, you finally deigned to reply to me? Where the hell did you die off to last night?" 
As soon as the phone connected, a roar like that of a lioness came through. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning had to quickly lower the volume before hiding behind and speaking in a lower voice: "What are you doing? Why are you so loud? You’re about to make me deaf." 
Qiao Feiyu still wouldn’t let it go on the other end: "What’s wrong with me shouting twice? You want to know what’s wrong? Let me tell you, last night my brother almost ran off to B City looking for you." 
"What did you say? B City?" 
"Yeah, last night Xiaobao accidentally fell while moving things in the new house and was sent to the hospital. My brother was so anxious, that’s why he thought of looking for you." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Suddenly, she leaned out from behind with her phone and urgently said to the man in front: "Ou Mucen, can you drive faster? My son has been taken to the hospital!" 
Ou Mucen paused for a moment! 
Taken to the hospital? 
In just a second, he floored the gas pedal to 160, racing ahead like a bolt of lightning. noveldrama
Meanwhile, Ye Ning was still on the phone with her best friend, inquiring about her son’s condition. When she heard that the little boy had fallen from a stool while trying to tidy up the messy house, she instantly burst into tears: "Why didn’t you wait for me to come back before moving? Why?" 
She felt a bit irrational, especially after feeling like she had been treated like a pawn, arranged and manipulated, during the past day and night. 
She was grateful for his care, but couldn’t some matters be discussed with her?
###Chapter 154: Chapter 154: What’s the Matter? I’ll Arrange It!
Ye Ning hung up the phone with a vengeance, her body trembling slightly. 
Ou Mucen had remained silent throughout, but he could hear the commotion behind him, including the conversation. 
When he heard that the child had been in an accident because someone had moved her without authorization yesterday, his eyes narrowed slightly and his expression turned cold. "Which hospital?" 
"What?" 
"Ask clearly, which hospital is it, I’ll make the arrangements!" His words were simple and calm. 
Yet, for some reason, sitting in the back, Ye Ning felt a surge of hope upon hearing this and immediately redialed on her phone. 
"Hello? Xiaoyu, which hospital are you at?" 
"The First People’s Hospital, Aning, don’t worry, my brother has already made arrangements here..." 
Ye Ning hung up and looked up at the man in front of her. "At The First People’s Hospital. He fell from a stool." 
Ou Mucen in front nodded, then he took out his Bluetooth headset and dialed the hospital director’s number. "Hello, this is Ou Mucen..." 
Ye Ning, in fact, didn’t quite understand why she trusted this man so much at this moment. Perhaps it was because she was too panicked, desperately seeking any help, or perhaps it was because she knew his status and believed that he could save Xiaobao. 
Two minutes later, he hung up the phone and indeed gave her good news, "They’re arranging it now. I heard it’s a head injury, but not serious. Don’t worry so much." 
That’s good! That’s so good! 
Ye Ning’s tears once again burst forth, but this time, it was tears of joy. 
Indeed, in this world, nobody else mattered to her. Only this child was her utmost concern; her life. 
After the phone call with the hospital, they remained silent in the car, with Ou Mucen driving intently at the front and Ye Ning anxiously fretting in the back. 
She didn’t even notice when the man in the front drank the milk she had opened. 
Xiaobao, it’s all Mommy’s fault. Mommy shouldn’t have left you alone. 
— 
An hour later, the car finally entered A City and arrived in front of the hospital. 
Seeing the hospital, Ye Ning couldn’t wait to open the car door. "Ou Mucen, thank you for today." 
Ou Mucen didn’t reply but after she got out, he parked the car properly, took the car keys, and got out. 
Ye Ning was surprised when she saw this. "What are you doing..." 
"Taking you to see the director!" 
Oh, oh, oh...
She had forgotten about that! 
When Ye Ning was reminded, she finally remembered, and she hurriedly followed him toward the outpatient hall of the hospital. noveldrama
Upon reaching the hall, Qiao Feiyu was already there waiting. She was shocked to see her arrive with the A City’s wealthy Crown Prince. "Aning, how come you’re with him?" 
Ye Ning quickly explained, "The third young master knows the director of this place. On the way here, he already had the people here take care of Xiaobao. How is Xiaobao now?" 
So that was it! 
Qiao Feiyu finally understood and nodded hurriedly, "It’s nothing serious. After cleaning the wound last night, it’s already much better." 
There was a wound... 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s eyes reddened again, ignoring the people behind her, she went straight into the hall, entered the elevator, and headed toward the wards.
###Chapter 155: Chapter 155 She Has No Right to Blame Him
Qiao Feiyu, seeing this at the doorway, felt embarrassed and smiled apologetically at the man standing before her, then quickly turned and followed after him. 
Damn! 
The rumored Crown Prince of the Ou family really was so handsome it made your head spin and your heart feel like it was about to burst out. 
—— 
Once they arrived at the ward, indeed, Ye Ning immediately spotted the tiny figure sitting on the hospital bed, dressed in patient garb, with a bandage on his head, looking pitifully adorable. 
"Xiaobao, Mommy’s back, I’m so sorry!" As soon as she saw this scene, Ye Ning’s heart clenched, and she hurried over, throwing herself by the bed and hugging the small child tightly. 
Ye Xiaobao was chatting with Uncle Lin when all of a sudden he saw his mom return and was pleased. Held in his mother’s arms, he tilted his little head back and asked, "Mommy, are you back?" 
Ye Ning nodded, "I’m back, I’m so sorry, it’s all Mommy’s fault. If Mommy hadn’t been away, you wouldn’t have gotten hurt." 
With those words, Lin Yebai, standing by the side, felt even more remorse. 
"Aning, blame me for this. If I hadn’t decided to help you move, Xiaobao wouldn’t have had the accident." 
"No, it’s not Uncle Lin’s fault, it was me. I asked him to move because I didn’t want Mommy to move with her foot injury, so I told Uncle Lin about it." 
The child, only four years old, fearful that his mommy and uncle might argue because of him, hastily took all the responsibility upon himself. 
As Ye Ning held him, it didn’t take long for her to smile at the man in front of her, "No, Big Brother Lin, I should be grateful for everything you’ve done for me. You’ve arranged everything as if we were family, how could I blame you? It was I who shouldn’t have gone to B City yesterday. I was very wrong to do so." 
As Ye Ning spoke, her eyes began to redden once again. 
Indeed, Lin Yebai was not to blame for this incident. Had it not been for her trip to B City, none of this would have happened. Even with the move, she would have been present. 
Therefore, she really shouldn’t blame him, because he truly was the best person to her in this world. 
Hearing her say this, Lin Yebai’s heart finally sighed in relief. After chatting for a few more moments, he took the prescription and prepared to get the medicine. 
But, just as he reached the doorway, someone suddenly came from outside... 
"Third Young Master, the child you asked about is in this ward. Rest assured, we’ve conducted a thorough examination on him and haven’t found any serious issues. Now, all that is needed is proper care of the wound." 
"Hmm..." noveldrama
With just a simple acknowledgment, a sharp and tall silhouette appeared in the doorway, led by two doctors. 
Standing inside the ward, Ye Ning saw this and her heart skipped a beat, as a wave of anxiety surged from within. 
Ou Mucen? 
What the hell is he doing here? 
"Big Brother Lin..." 
"Mr. Ou?" 
Lin Yebai recognized the man as well; it was a figure often seen across various media platforms, dignified, graceful, and reserved. His appearance instantly drew the attention of many people in the hallway. 
Ou Mucen, who was being led inside by the two doctors, suddenly heard his name called and looked intently, stopping in his tracks. 
Lin Yebai? 
Ou Mucen also recognized the man opposite him. 
Ou Mucen had actually known of Lin Yebai before Ye Ning started working at the Ou Corporation. He was a man who had long been the subject of conversation, a top figure in the Antique Circle said to possess countless treasures and rumored to be the most influential person in controlling the entire Antique Circle.
###Chapter 156: Chapter 156: She’s Actually Explaining to Him?
I never would have thought he looked like this in real life.
"So Mr. Lin is here too. It seems you’re quite caring toward your disciple," Ou Mucen said coolly. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Yebai chuckled, "Well, it’s only natural to be concerned about my disciple. But bothering Mr. Ou for help, that’s improper; I apologize, An Ning is not sensible, thank you for your trouble, Mr. Ou." 
As he finished his statement, the tone shifted and he directly started blaming Ye Ning who was standing by the bedside. 
Ye Ning had been completely dumbfounded, but suddenly the topic had turned to her, and she panicked even more, "Brother Lin, you’ve got it wrong. It was on the way here that the Third Young Master heard about Xiaobao’s injury from me and then helped me find the hospital director to take care of Xiaobao." 
Her tone was urgent, and her voice was tinged with nervousness! 
Was she explaining? 
The man standing at the doorway narrowed his eyes slightly and immediately, his handsome face darkened, "I’m her employer, and because I took her on a business trip, her son had an accident. It’s my responsibility to take care of the issue. Both of you, take the child to the VIP ward." 
"Yes, Third Young Master!" 
It was just a few sentences’ worth of time, and the two doctors who had followed him moved Xiaobao from his current bed to another one. 
Ye Ning was taken aback, and wanted to say something, but at that moment, the other man at the doorway, Lin Yebai, had already spoken harshly, "Mr. Ou, what is this? The child has only a minor injury; there’s no need for hospitalization!" 
"Whether he needs to be hospitalized or not is not for you to decide, nor for me. If you really care about your disciple, then listen to the doctor properly." After saying that, a flicker of scorn crossed his lips, and he turned and left. 
Lin Yebai’s face immediately turned ashen! 
Ye Ning was also infuriated... 
Was this bastard doing this on purpose? Knowing her relationship with the man in the hospital room and still talking and behaving this way, wasn’t he making it even harder for her? 
Ye Ning looked at the man in front of her, whose face had become quite awful to look at after that bastard left, and quickly tried to explain, "Brother Lin, I..." 
"Alright, Aning, you take good care of Xiaobao. I’m a bit tired and will go rest now." 
Before she could finish her sentence, the man, who looked terrible, merely said this indifferently, grabbed his clothes and car keys, and also left the place. noveldrama
Ye Ning panicked, hastily followed out, wanting to make things clear, but at this time, the two doctors had already wheeled out the child behind her. Seeing her standing there, they hastily called out, "Family member, please come with us to handle the procedures." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
In the end, she could only stamp her foot and fiercely cursed that bastard in her heart, then followed the two doctors, pushing the child to the VIP ward area. 
-- 
However, what she didn’t know was that after her child had been moved to the VIP ward, in the hospital director’s office, Director Ji Chengzhi, upon seeing that man come in and lie down on his sofa immediately, seriously said, "Third Young Master, the child actually can be discharged now!" 
With one sentence, the temperature in the office dropped. 
"Your hospital can actually have its shares withdrawn as well!" 
"..." 
Within two seconds, Ji Chengzhi had written the hospital discharge form, "Three days, that should be enough, right?"
###Chapter 157: Chapter 157
No one paid attention to him anymore. The man lay there, his eyes half-closed, his face weary, seemingly not wanting to move at all. 
When Ji Chengzhi saw this, he sensed something was off and stood up from his chair to approach him, "Sick?" 
The man lying there didn’t make a sound, his eyes still closed. 
Seeing this, Ji Chengzhi was quite surprised, but in the end, he still prepared some medicine for him, "It’s truly miraculous. The third young master of the Ou Family actually gets sick? What happened? Weren’t you fine yesterday?" 
"Who told my mom about my whereabouts?" 
Suddenly, he came out with this sentence. 
Whereabouts? 
Ji Chengzhi was taken aback, "Definitely not something I did. What, has that Mrs. Ou from your family been pushing women at you again?" noveldrama
It was clear that Ji Chengzhi was smart. With that comment, he immediately guessed what had happened. 
Indeed, his mother, desperate for him to produce a grandson for her right away, would not let such a good opportunity pass without some noise, right? 
Once Ji Chengzhi understood, his smile turned ambiguous, "Since you fell for it, how did you spend last night? It couldn’t have been with that single mother..." 
"Shut up! Do you believe I can shut down your hospital right now?" 
"..." 
With that, Ji Chengzhi kept quiet. 
Alright, he has the money, he’s the boss, if he doesn’t want to talk then fine... 
Ji Chengzhi bowed his head to open up his game account and saw that everyone except for his office guest in the Langya Pavilion was online, so he slowly sent out a message, "Do you guys know why the third young master’s mood drastically changed yesterday?" 
Eldest young master, "Why?" 
Shopkeeper Zhan, "Did he take the wrong medicine?" 
Langya Pavilion’s number one beauty, "What exactly happened?" 
After smirking to himself, Ji Chengzhi then rapidly typed a few words to send, "Last night, he spent the whole evening alone with a woman..." 
Eldest young master: ... 
Shopkeeper Zhan: ... 
Langya Pavilion’s number one beauty: ... 
Three seconds later, the eldest young master, "I finally understand now. His mother called me yesterday to ask about his whereabouts because of this!" 
This time, it was Ji Chengzhi who was caught off guard! 
His mother called him? 
So, when that person asked who had disclosed his whereabouts earlier, was it this jerk who had betrayed him after he showed up online for just a few seconds yesterday? 
As Ji Chengzhi thought about the fact that the game account could indeed be used to locate someone, he began to feel sorry for the guy, "Take care, young master Qu." 
Eldest young master: ... 
Suddenly, he had a very bad hunch in the game and quickly typed, "I’ll be going abroad for half a month." And then he completely disappeared without a trace. 
Right, at this time, if he still lingered here, then as the young master of the Qu family, he would certainly be doomed. 
Ji Chengzhi turned off his phone, ready to attend a surgical conference, but at that moment, the phone on his desk suddenly rang. 
"Hello?" 
"Director, the family member of Ye Xiaobao, who has just been transferred to the VIP ward, has asked to see you," said the voice of the front desk nurse. 
Ji Chengzhi paused for a moment... 
Ye Xiaobao’s family member? 
Oh, right, it was the single mother that he had personally arranged to be in the VIP ward area. 
Realizing this, Ji Chengzhi nodded, "Okay, tell her to wait for me in the doctor’s duty room, I’ll be there shortly." 
"Yes, Director!" 
The nurse hung up the phone and quickly made the arrangements. 
Meanwhile, Ji Chengzhi, after glancing at the man who had fallen asleep on the sofa after drinking his medicine, also turned and left.
###Chapter 158: Chapter 158 Did Miss An Never Intend to Save Him Yesterday?
That woman was looking for him, and of course, he couldn’t meet her in his office; otherwise, it would be inconvenient if this man heard him asking questions that shouldn’t be asked. 
Ji Chengzhi walked with brisk steps, quickly reaching the doctor’s duty room in the VIP ward area, not far from his own office. 
Upon arriving at the duty room, indeed, he immediately saw a short-haired woman standing inside, wearing a white T-shirt and light blue jeans, staring at a human vascular diagram posted on the conference room wall. 
This woman was so young. Had he not seen her with his own eyes, he would hardly believe she was the mother of a four-year-old child. 
Ji Chengzhi entered the room, "Are you the one looking for me?" 
Ye Ning, who was idly examining the human body diagram, hurriedly turned around upon hearing the voice behind her, "Yes, hello, Director, I am An Ning, the mother of Ye Xiaobao from VIP room number 5." 
An Ning... 
Ji Chengzhi recalled the man still in his office, who had written those two characters flamboyantly in the family member column while forcing him to issue a hospital admittance form, and he smiled at the woman with delicate features, "Mmm, I know you. You’re the patient that President Ou personally entrusted to me today." 
Ye Ning quickly nodded, "Yes, I’m really sorry to trouble you. I just wanted to ask about my child—does he really need to keep staying in the hospital?" 
Ji Chengzhi was taken aback, "What? Miss An, you don’t want your child to be hospitalized?" 
"No, no, that’s not what I mean. I just want to know—how serious is my child’s injury?" Ye Ning hurriedly clarified, afraid that the Director would misunderstand. 
Indeed, her reason for coming here was to inquire about Xiaobao’s injury. If it wasn’t serious, then she would naturally prefer to be discharged from the hospital. It wasn’t just a waste of money, but the second reason was that she didn’t like her child staying in the hospital. 
However, this overly young Director, after listening to her words, didn’t even stop to think before saying, "A child’s head injury can be major or minor. If you’re not careful, it could even be a concussion, which can affect his development and potentially leave him mentally impaired for life. So, Miss An, the reason I arranged for your child’s hospitalization was to observe him for a few days—it’s also a form of protection for your child. What do you think?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
It seemed he had a point—it was a head injury, after all, not some other part of the body. 
Ye Ning, who didn’t understand medicine, was frightened enough not to dare to ask any more questions. 
Ji Chengzhi noticed her gaze shift and suddenly said, "It seems you and Mr. Ou are quite familiar. For all these years, I’ve never seen him personally come to arrange a hospital stay for someone." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning felt a bit embarrassed, "Director, please don’t misunderstand. In fact, Mr. Ou and I have a boss-subordinate relationship; I’m his assistant. He helped me because, on the way back, he heard that my child was injured and contacted you for me." noveldrama
"I see, then does that mean you were together before this?" 
"Yes, we went on a business trip to B City together yesterday." 
"Did you know that someone drugged him yesterday?" Ji Chengzhi really didn’t give anyone a chance to prepare! 
Ye Ning’s face turned red all of a sudden because she remembered what happened on the expressway yesterday, what that man suddenly did to her. 
"I..." 
"He had a high fever—it was probably from using cold water to soak himself to counteract the drugs. Didn’t you think of saving him yesterday, Miss An?" 
Ye Ning: "..."
###Chapter 159: Chapter 159 She Was Still Too Naive
So when he came to find her at the hotel yesterday, drenched, the truth was that he had taken a cold bath to counteract the effects of the drug in his system? That’s why he was like that? 
Ye Ning suddenly started to feel a bit guilty, because yesterday, she really hadn’t saved him. 
She was aware that the mayor’s daughter intended to drug him, but instead of preventing it, she thought that since the two were fiancés, a roll in the hay was quite normal. 
But it turned out that the bastard would rather take a cold bath than lay a finger on the mayor’s daughter. 
Ye Ning felt indescribably complicated inside...
"And how is he now?" 
"Now?" Ji Chengzhi gave her a thoughtful look: "He still has a bit of a fever, but it shouldn’t be a big problem. Was it Miss An who took care of him yesterday?" 
Ye Ning nodded: "The place we temporarily rested at was a very simple small town with no hospital, so I just bought some medicine for him to take." 
Bought medicine, that was enough, or else who knows how he might’ve died? 
Ji Chengzhi glanced at his wristwatch and saw it was about time to leave the meeting, so he left her with one last admonishment: "You should stay for a few days, regardless of how serious it is, mainly for observation, understand?" 
Ye Ning quickly nodded: "Yes, Director, I understand!" 
Ye Ning couldn’t possibly understand that the overly young director before her was actually a close friend of her boss, one of the famous Four Profligates of A City. Had she known, she’d probably have taken her child and left the hospital immediately. 
Fortunately, when she was in the ward until nearly dusk, Lin Yebai came again, this time bringing a thermos and some soup. 
Upon seeing him, Ye Ning quickly stood up: "Big Brother Lin, you’re here?" 
She was a bit surprised and also a bit nervous! 
The surprise was because she hadn’t expected him to come see her and her son after the conflict she’d had with that bastard at noon, and even more so because he had brought food. 
The nervousness was because he suddenly appeared, and she hesitated whether to explain herself, as after all, she didn’t want to have a falling-out with this man who had taken care of her for five years. 
But what about this man? 
After looking at her, he just placed the items in his hands on the table as usual, then looked at her and smiled faintly: "Hmm, I went home and took a nap; how is Xiaobao?" noveldrama
Ye Ning hurriedly replied: "The director said there’s nothing serious, just that he hit his head. They’re worried about a concussion, so he needs to stay a few days for observation. Big Brother Lin, I really didn’t want him to be hospitalized." 
As she said the last sentence, her voice noticeably dropped. 
Lin Yebai saw and came over to look at the child who was sleeping in the bed at that time... 
Whether it was a concussion or not could have been seen in the CT scan at that time; it seems she was still too na?ve. 
Lin Yebai watched the child for a while and then nodded: "Listen to the doctor, a concussion is no trivial matter. Observing for a while is good. You’ve been tired all day, you should rest too. Let Xiaoyu take you back first. The new place you’ve moved into is just right for you to sort things out." 
In this manner... 
Hearing this arrangement, Ye Ning, of course, felt it was very good. Her foot injury had yet to heal, and she had been wearing the same clothes for two days now, which certainly needed changing. 
So she nodded, took the set of keys he handed her: "Alright, I’ll go back and sort things out first, and I’ll come over later to take your place."
###Chapter 160: Chapter 160: Ou Mucen, why didn’t you simply sleep with her then?
"It’s fine, you should go back and rest first." 
Lin Yebai’s temperament was really quite good, even though he had been so agitated that morning, when he awoke, it was as though nothing had happened. 
He remained as gentle as jade, modest and elegant... 
Seeing this, Ye Ning finally felt relieved, so after staying in the hospital for a day, she took her bag and keys, and left the hospital. 
—— 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, who had slept through the afternoon in Ji Chengzhi’s office, finally had his fever subside and woke up at dusk. 
"How are you feeling? A bit more comfortable? Do you want me to take you back?" 
Ou Mucen shook his head, glanced outside at the sky and then at his watch, and got up from the couch: "Did anyone call me?" 
"Of course, you are such a big CEO, how could no one call you? But I transferred all calls to your secretary, he will compile a call record and send it to your email later, don’t worry about it." 
Sure enough, Jicheng was a good brother, arranging everything perfectly.noveldrama
Ou Mucen felt reassured, stood up from the couch, and was ready to leave, to return to his own apartment. 
Sensing his intention to leave, Ji Chengzhi quickly handed him some medicine: "Take these when you get back. What they gave you was not any ordinary drug, this will help you recover." 
While saying this, he suddenly thought of a problem and raised his head: "But what I don’t understand is, with such a handy ’antidote’ at your side at the time, why did you go soak in cold water? Look at what soaking in cold water did to you, it’s harmful to your health!" 
At this remark, the man standing in front of him clouded over with a dark expression: "I can make things even more harmful to your health!" 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
What kind of people are these? He was telling the truth, so why such a murderous aura? Wasn’t the "antidote" quite good? Could it be that he thought it didn’t befit him, because she was a single mother? 
Yet, why then did he have him arrange a 3-day VIP hospital room for her son? That’s very expensive, young master! 
Director Ji was about to go mad... 
But once Ou Mucen left the office, he didn’t bother with the matter anymore, and as soon as he left the hospital, he drove back to Platinum Apartments. 
"Third Young Master, are all these things to be thrown away?" 
Back in the apartment, following his usual habit, he cleaned himself thoroughly and changed out of his dirty clothes, which were then to be discarded—as someone with severe mysophobia, he really couldn’t stand to keep the things he brought back after sleeping elsewhere. 
However, this time, he glanced at the dark green shirt in the cleaning lady’s hands and, thinking of the shirt he had seen drying on the windowsill that morning, abruptly pointed at it: "Take this one to dry cleaning, the rest can be thrown out." 
"Alright, Young Master!" The cleaning lady took the shirt, wrapped it carefully, and then carried it along with the trash out of the apartment. 
As soon as the cleaning lady left, the apartment fell into complete silence. He went to the living room area, turned on the music, poured himself a glass of red wine, and took it to the desk. 
He had spent the entire day in Ji Chengzhi’s office, and now it was time to start working. 
But just as he was about to turn on the computer, his phone rang... 
"Hello?" 
"Xiaocen, are you alright?" 
It was actually his mother who had the nerve to call him!
###Chapter 161: Chapter 161 Bai Tingfang Already Knows About the Existence of That Assistant
Ou Mucen’s originally calm heart suddenly turned cold,"What do you think?" 
When Bai Tingfang heard this, she immediately chuckled sheepishly,"Don’t be mad, son. I just wanted to ask you about something, you know, about yesterday. I really had no idea Kexin would do such a thing. Had I known, I certainly wouldn’t have told her where you were." 
Humph! 
Ou Mucen, furious to the extreme, became oddly calm,"Are you saying you didn’t teach her to do that?" 
"What are you talking about? Son, why must you doubt your mother like this? Although your mom wants you to get married and have children soon, she would never scheme against my own son. By saying such things, son, you’re truly breaking your mother’s heart." 
Rambling on and on, she said a whole bunch! 
Ou Mucen, with a headache from listening, pulled the phone away, conceding,"Alright, alright, no need to say more. I don’t blame you, okay?" 
That’s the kind of mother he had. Every time she made a mistake, she’d pester him relentlessly. What could he do? He surely couldn’t hold a grudge against his own mother, could he? 
Ou Mucen felt extraordinarily miserable. Just as he was about to hang up, Bai Tingfang, having successfully obtained her son’s forgiveness, suddenly blurted out,"I heard from Kexin that you came back from Murong Villa yesterday with your secretary. You didn’t come home last night... did something happen between you and her...?" 
She didn’t finish her sentence, but her implication was very clear. noveldrama
What else could have happened between a drugged man and a young secretary? 
Bai Tingfang’s tone was far from pleasant! 
Ou Mucen, hearing this, immediately darkened,"Mother, what nonsensical thoughts are you harboring? She’s just my secretary. Stop conjuring up all this mess at home." 
Bai Tingfang snorted coldly,"I hope it’s as you say. You, Ou Mucen, cannot just bring any woman home. Your secretary, she has a child and no husband in sight. Who knows what her intentions are, working for you? Better fire her soon, or don’t blame me for not being nice to her!" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Sitting there, holding the phone, he calmed down for a long, long time before speaking slowly and deliberately into the receiver,"Bai Tingfang, I’ve been polite to you because you’re my mother. But if you cross my bottom line, don’t blame me for not being polite either!" 
After speaking, he coldly ended the call. 
Indeed, he respected her and treated her courteously because she was his mother, but if she overstepped the bounds of a mother’s role and did things she shouldn’t, he truly couldn’t guarantee that he wouldn’t turn against her. 
Assistant? 
She even knew about that and was aware she was a single mother with a child. It seemed he had been too lenient with her recently, allowing her to forget her place. 
The man putting down the phone had eyes that grew utterly cold... 
—— 
Ye Ning spent all night tidying up the things she had moved in. 
There was no denying that the house was indeed nice. A one-bedroom apartment, not very large, but with a great layout. Most importantly, it was located in the city center and was close to Xiaobao’s school. 
After organizing everything, Ye Ning prepared to eat. 
Qiao Feiyu, coming out of the kitchen, saw that she wasn’t unhappy upon seeing the house and tried to sweeten the deal,"Ningning, you like this house, don’t you?"
###Chapter 162: Chapter 162: Aning, Quit Your Job!
Ye Ning nodded. "It’s really nice, it’s just that it’s too much trouble for your brother." 
Qiao Feiyu smiled. "It’s no trouble at all, as long as you’re not angry, my brother is happy. Actually, I have to admit, when my brother suddenly decided to help you move yesterday, I also felt it wasn’t right. You weren’t here, yet he was moving your stuff. That’s, well, a bit too much, isn’t it?" 
Ye Ning smiled, then said nothing... 
She didn’t really want to discuss the issue right now because she knew he liked to arrange everything for her concerning her affairs, but she couldn’t deny that he truly cared for her. 
Taking the bowl, she served the soup for both of them, then said, "Your brother is just looking out for me, I should be grateful. Right, after we eat, I have to go to the hospital, so I’ll leave the house in your care." 
Qiao Feiyu immediately smiled. "No problem, leave it to me. Are you going to stay in the hospital all night?" 
"Of course, Xiaobao is there." 
"What about work tomorrow? What will you do?" 
Work? 
Upon hearing this question, Ye Ning’s spoon, which was halfway to her mouth, stopped in its tracks. 
Work? 
She probably would not go. The resignation letter was already written, wasn’t it? It was lying in that person’s car. 
So she shook her head. "I’m not going to work. Xiaobao is in the hospital right now; everything else can wait until he’s discharged." 
Not going to work? 
Qiao Feiyu was startled. How could this be? That job had taken her a lot of effort to secure, and it wasn’t just about the salary. She had more important reasons for that job. 
Beginning to panic, Qiao Feiyu put down her chopsticks in a rush and said, "Ningning, don’t be rash. It wasn’t easy to get this job, and besides, you haven’t taken your revenge yet. If you don’t go to work there, how will you deal with that despicable couple?" 
Ye Ning bowed her head. "There will always be a way; you don’t need to worry." 
She didn’t want to say too much to the girl. For one thing, it wouldn’t be any help to her, and secondly, she didn’t want to accidentally spoil her plans by saying too much. 
Fearing more questions, she simply put down her chopsticks, grabbed the thermos flask that was ready on the table, and left the house. 
What to do next? 
She hadn’t really thought about it; the matter had come up quite suddenly, and she hadn’t even expected to resign. 
So, if you were to ask her what she was going to do next, she truly hadn’t decided yet. Maybe, she should consider another path? 
All the way to the hospital, Ye Ning thought about it, carrying the thermos flask. 
Once at the hospital, she hadn’t planned to talk about this, but unexpectedly, the man who had looked after Xiaobao for her there suddenly spoke up. "Aning, why not resign tomorrow? I think it’s best you don’t stay around Ou Mucen anymore." 
Ye Ning was startled. "Why?"
Lin Yebai looked indifferently at the teacup in his hand. "Xiaobao has already been seen by Ou Yuze. With his vengeful nature, he will surely investigate Xiaobao’s identity. Once he discovers that Xiaobao is your child and that you are working as an assistant to Ou Mucen, he will not let you off." 
Ye Ning was taken aback! noveldrama
Was that the reason? 
However, standing there, she thought it over and realized that this was indeed one of her original reasons for wanting to resign, so she nodded. "Okay, then Brother Lin, what advice do you have for me next?"
###Chapter 163: Chapter 163: Returning to the Euclidean Space Again
"Bringing down the second branch of the Ou family is not the only path that relies on Ou Mucen. Come back to Tang Garden with me. After Ou Yuze’s supply channels were taken over by Ou Mucen, they started looking for a new supplier. I’ll arrange for you to work at that company." 
A new supplier? 
Ye Ning opened her mouth slightly in surprise... 
He truly lived up to his reputation as the boss of this game, even mastering this so quickly. 
So she nodded, not ing, "Okay, I’ll follow your arrangement. Tomorrow, I’ll go to the Ou Corporation and take care of the resignation procedures." 
"Good!" 
The man sitting in front of the hospital bed, having heard this satisfactory response, finally began to eat. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning went over to check on the child lying in the hospital bed and saw that he had fallen into a deep sleep. She brought over a basin of water and cleaned his small face with a clean towel. 
Of course, she had to go through with the resignation procedures, even though she had only been at that company for two days, but there were some things she hadn’t brought back from the office. 
Moreover, yesterday in B City, that bastard had said their labor contracts at the Ou Corporation were different. If she left unilaterally, she would have to pay a penalty. 
Thinking of these things, Ye Ning suddenly felt a bit irritated! 
A sleepless night— 
The next morning, Lin Yebai arrived very early, probably because he knew she was going to the company to take care of her resignation. 
Seeing him, Ye Ning gave a few instructions, preparing to leave, but then the man standing in the sickroom suddenly said, "Aning, when you resign, you don’t need to tell Ou Mucen. You can go directly to the HR department." 
Ye Ning was taken aback for a moment, "Why? Don’t I need his signature to resign?" 
She hadn’t worked at a large company before and was a bit unfamiliar with these processes. 
Lin Yebai nodded, "No need. You’re still on probation. Within a month, if either side feels it’s not suitable, they can terminate the contract automatically. And to do this, you don’t need to go through him. You can put in the request directly with the HR department." 
Is there such a good thing? noveldrama
Ye Ning, who had been somewhat nervous, felt a sudden relief upon hearing this. She agreed and quickly left the place. 
Of course, she would rather not have to see that bastard. If she did, he might pull some trick on her. Lin Yebai’s idea was better. 
Ye Ning left the hospital feeling much lighter. After driving Lin Yebai’s car back home to quickly tidy up and change into clean clothes, she headed to the Ou Corporation building in the city center. 
By the time she arrived at the building, it was nine o’clock. The entrance, past office hours, was not as crowded, but with the department store below starting its business day, a steady stream of people began to head her way. 
Seeing this, she parked the car and swiftly entered the building. 
"Xiao’an, you’re here?" 
Unexpectedly, upon entry, she saw Xiaochen from the same office. 
Seeing her, Ye Ning had to greet her as well, "Yeah, I’m here. Good morning." 
Xiaochen immediately cut her off, "What good morning? It’s already nine o’clock. But, didn’t Secretary Gao say you injured your foot and took leave? Why have you come to the office today?" 
That... 
Ye Ning glanced at the documents Xiaochen was holding and after a pause, casually replied, "I came to get some things. By the way, what are you off to do?" 
"I’m going to the Jade Factory to get some documents. You don’t know, our Yuzhirun’s first batch of samples had all sorts of problems, and right now, the third young master is throwing a tantrum in the conference room."
###Chapter 164: The 164th increase. Clear it up, whose place is this?
Not bringing it up would have been fine, but once mentioned, the girl’s entire face fell. noveldrama
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning was stunned! 
The first batch of samples all had defects? How could that be? She had personally inspected those jade stones, and there were no issues. Why would there be problems? 
Ye Ning began to feel doubtful. As she followed the girl into the elevator, she started to inquire and learned that after the Jade Factory had received that batch of materials, they produced samples according to the design drawings. However, it turned out that the A-grade raw materials all developed cracks during processing, leaving not a single intact sample. 
"Xiao’an, do you think, could there be a problem with the raw materials?" 
A problem with the raw materials? 
Of course not, her eyes were as accurate as any high-end detection instrument in the world. How could she have made a mistake? 
But if it wasn’t a problem with the raw materials, then what could have caused all those samples to crack? 
Ye Ning’s frown deepened as she made her way to the fifteenth floor, and along the way, she completely forgot that her original intention was to go to the Human Resources Department on the ninth floor. 
Upon reaching the fifteenth floor, as soon as she stepped out of the elevator, she heard the sound of something being smashed and a man’s angry cursing from the conference room down the hall. The murderous intent was so intense that even the nearby offices could feel it, rendering everyone inside too scared to make a sound. 
"Xiao’an..." 
"Do you have those samples on you? And the data analysis, can I take a look at it?" 
"Yes, yes, here you go!" 
Xiaochen, upon hearing that she needed these two items, quickly handed over the stuff she had just brought from the factory. 
The newly hired assistant’s specialty happened to be jade, so naturally, she did not hesitate to provide what was asked of her. 
However, she saw that after taking these two items, Ye Ning quickly entered the CEO’s office and then stayed inside, with no one knowing what she was doing. She did not come out for a very long time. 
Xiaochen returned to her desk and had just sat down for a short while when the secretary from the tension-filled conference room hurried out, "Where are the things brought from the factory?" 
Xiaochen hurriedly pulled out another set, "Here, but Xiao’an also came by just now. After hearing about the situation, she took some and is currently in the office." 
Xiao’an? 
An Ning? 
The secretary hesitated for a moment and then suddenly didn’t want the items anymore, rushing back to the conference room instead. 
Xiaochen, standing at the reception desk, felt puzzled. What was the secretary doing? Why ask her to bring over the items if she was going to refuse them?
Meanwhile, inside the office, Ye Ning, having received the samples, quickly discerned that the problem did not stem from the materials. It was very likely that something had compromised their structure, making them so fragile. 
In this world, what else could damage a piece of jade? 
She lowered her head, took a pair of small scissors from the pen holder, and began to scrape away at it bit by bit. 
"Have you figured out something?" 
She was fully engrossed in examining the piece of jade when suddenly, a voice from above startled her. Caught off guard, the sharp scissors slipped, and she quickly covered her finger, exclaiming, "What are you doing? You come back so suddenly and don’t say anything, can’t you make a little noise?" 
The man standing in front of her instantly grew even more furious! 
Was this her place? Or his? 
He had to come back and tell her?
###Chapter 165: Chapter 165: Bumped into His Back!
Ou Mucen was on the verge of losing his temper, but when he saw the faint red on her bandaged finger, he turned around and went to the liquor cabinet in the office to find a band-aid. It was only then that he stood in front of her again with a dark expression on his face. 
"Who told you about this?" 
What? 
Ye Ning took the band-aid, "No one told me. When I came to the company, I just happened to run into Xiaochen, and she told me." 
She came to the company on her own initiative today? 
Ou Mucen looked at her expressionlessly, indicating that he didn’t quite believe what this woman was saying. 
Indeed, her son was still in the hospital, and her foot wasn’t fully healed yet; how could she come to the company so eagerly? She even told him yesterday that she was quitting! 
Ou Mucen stared at her without saying a word... 
As Ye Ning was applying the band-aid to her injured finger, she suddenly felt the oppressive gaze of the man in front of her and finally couldn’t take it any longer. She pushed the jade sample towards him. 
"All right, you don’t need to stare at me like that anymore. I should have already helped you find the reason." 
"What?" noveldrama
"It’s not the jade’s problem, it’s something else. Let’s go check out the factory first," she said, standing up from her seat. 
Ou Mucen paused for a moment, probably not expecting her to bring up this issue. 
Something else? 
He glanced at the jade that she had peeled out of the gold ornament and then at the woman standing in front of him. Finally, he picked up his car keys from his desk and stepped out of the office door. 
Seeing this from behind, Ye Ning also picked up her cell phone and the sample reports and analysis, and followed him out. 
Going to the factory would definitely take some time; they wouldn’t be back soon. 
With this thought, she reached for her phone on her way out and opened her WeChat: "Big Brother Lin, Ou’s new jewelry samples have a problem, and I want to check it out to see if the second house is up to mischief." 
She quickly typed out this string of words and, subconsciously, she lied a little, possibly because she was afraid the other side would disagree. 
After sending the message, she quickly got a reply. She immediately looked towards the screen. 
Lin Yebai: "What’s the problem? Ou Yuze wouldn’t be so foolish, would he? To meddle with the first batch of samples?" 
"I don’t know yet, that’s why I want to go and check. If it’s true, then it’s really a godsend!" 
"Be careful, don’t be reckless." 
"I know, as for Xiaobao, I’ll have to trouble Big Brother Lin for now..." 
She hadn’t typed out the "OK" when suddenly she felt a dark shadow looming in front of her. She hadn’t even reacted when she ran into him: "Mmph—" 
"Do you know what kind of person I hate the most?" 
"Ah?" 
"Indecisive, passive, lazy—if you don’t want to work, then get out right now!" His tone was extremely unpleasant. 
Ye Ning didn’t dare retort, hastily putting her phone away and keeping it on her person before holding her sore forehead and stepping into the elevator first. 
"How am I indecisive? I was asking my master for your sake." 
"What did you say?" 
Ye Ning turned her head away, "Nothing!" 
What a joke; she couldn’t let him hear that. She had just been so focused on sending a message that she ran into him. If he heard what she’d said, wouldn’t he just throw her out of the elevator?
###Chapter 166: Chapter 166: She Seems to Really Enjoy Disagreeing with Him Now
So, for a while, neither of them spoke, and Ye Ning, not wanting to provoke him again, silently set her phone to silent mode. It wasn’t until they got into the car that Ye Ning suddenly remembered she needed a tool, and she said to the man in front, "I need to buy a carving knife." 
"A carving knife?" 
"Yes, the kind you find in markets. Go to South Street; there are plenty of them there." While speaking, Ye Ning pointed in a direction. noveldrama
Ou Mucen glanced over at her from the front, initially intending to say that there were plenty of carving knife factories around, so why bother buying one? 
But then, recalling her bizarre appraisal technique last time at his jewelry store, he changed direction, heading for South Street. 
When it came to jade, she surely knew more than he did, otherwise, he wouldn’t have hired her. 
Once they arrived at South Street, sure enough, the whole street was lined with shops selling those tools, and Ye Ning got out of the car. 
She was about to go straight in, but then she thought of something and turned back to him, "Do you want to come in with me?" 
A look of impatience immediately crossed Ou Mucen’s face, "What would I go in for?" 
"To pay, Third Young Master; I came out with empty hands." With that, Ye Ning spread out her hands in front of him. 
Ou Mucen saw that, indeed... 
His last bit of good mood had been completely worn away. 
He carelessly took a few RMB notes out of his wallet and tossed them to her with a hint of sarcasm, "People like you, do you never bring money with you when you go out?" 
Ye Ning replied, "That depends on the situation, doesn’t it?" 
"What situation?" 
"For instance, when I’m spending money on myself!" Ye Ning gave him a look and went into the store with the money. 
Is he an idiot? This isn’t for buying her own stuff. A set costs over a thousand; is she crazy to use her own money! 
When Ye Ning went in, she didn’t even glance at the man behind her. 
Of course, she wouldn’t look because she knew that at this moment, his face would definitely be sour. 
That’s right, with someone as fickle as him, it would be strange if he had a good temper. 
At the nearest shop, she bought a set of Jade Carving Knives, which, as expected, were about the price she had thought. 
And so she bought them and returned. 
Back in the car, the man inside still seemed to be in a bad mood, so she stuffed the change back at him, "Don’t be so stingy, this tool can help you solve problems." 
Stingy? 
Ou Mucen, sitting in the front, quiet with rage, "What do I have to be stingy about? If the job’s not done well, this money will be deducted from your salary." 
What the hell! This bastard! 
Ye Ning was on the verge of exploding. 
What kind of person was this? She was helping him with his work, and if it wasn’t done well, she had to pay for it? 
Such a scumbag! 
But after thinking it over, since she wasn’t going to work there much longer, she held back the anger in her heart and decided not to quarrel with him over it. 
On the road again, the two in the car didn’t speak for a short while, until Ye Ning began to disassemble the hand-carved knives. Seeing what she was doing through the rearview mirror, he couldn’t help asking, "What are you doing?" 
Ye Ning, looking down at the knife in her hands, "I’m taking apart the blades to fit them to your machine table." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Was she insane? Those were hand-carved knives, and he had a machine table; she wanted to mount that onto this? 
Ou Mucen felt that this woman had completely lost her mind, "Do you even understand jade carving?" 
Ye Ning nodded, "Of course, do you want me to do the carving for you? I guarantee, you won’t find a second piece as beautiful as this in all of A City!"
###Chapter 167: Chapter 167 He subconsciously reached out to protect her from danger
Ye Ning was indeed becoming bolder with this man. Before, seeing him would always make her inexplicably nervous, flustered. 
But not anymore. Now, after being irritated, she would start to talk back in a teasing manner. 
Ou Mucen watched the woman in the rearview mirror, who was increasingly disregarding him, and his eyes narrowed slightly. Finally, he started the car and left the place. 
It seemed that he had been too lenient with her for too long! 
After purchasing the carving tools, Ou Mucen, because he was eager to resolve the issue, drove very quickly. In just over ten minutes, they arrived at the factory. 
"Mr. Ou has arrived!" 
Upon reaching the factory, the management staff who saw that it was the president’s car immediately ran out of the workshop. 
Seeing this, Ou Mucen parked the car and opened the door, "I’ll arrange for a few jade workers with better skills for you." 
He was a clever man. Although he didn’t understand jade, after what she said in the car, he roughly understood what she meant. 
But he had just gotten out of the car when the woman, who also brought the carving tools, hurriedly followed him: "No need, I’ll do it myself." 
"You’ll do it?" 
"Yeah, only if I do it myself will I know where the problem lies." After saying that, she took the tools and went into the factory. noveldrama
Ou Mucen furrowed his brows as he watched her from behind, and having no choice, followed her in... 
"Mr. Ou, Assistant An, what is she..." 
"Don’t mind her, go about your business." 
Ou Mucen said indifferently, dismissing the gathered factory managers who wanted to help. 
Once the management left, the factory, which had been forced to stop work due to a sample mishap, became very quiet. Ou Mucen walked over and saw that the only running engraving machine was being approached by the woman who had come in before him, so he followed suit. 
"Master, may I use your machine for a moment?" 
"Of course!" The master seated at the machine saw that it was the president’s assistant and promptly vacated his seat. 
So, Ye Ning sat down at the machine with the carving tools in hand. 
She wasn’t a very skilled machinist, but she was familiar with carving, especially using manual engraving tools. 
After removing the machine’s engraving tools, indeed, they were very high-quality, extremely hard. She frowned, set them aside, and began to mount her own tools one by one. 
Ou Mucen was standing right by her side! 
At this time, he didn’t stop her anymore because he knew that if she could deftly find this solution, it meant she was confident in her approach. 
Therefore, at that moment, he chose to observe. 
Once the engraving tools were fitted, as expected, when the batch of jade was brought over, she started the machine, and the improved blades moved across the jade, leaving much shallower traces and exerting less pressure than before. 
So, were the cracks caused by the unsuitability of his factory tools? 
Ou Mucen, upon seeing this, finally looked less displeased. 
Right at that moment, the girl who had been testing with her head down also finished a sample piece. Immediately, she held it up excitedly for him to see, "Look, the problem is right here, it’s your blades that are no good!" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Just as he was about to say something, suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of something on the machine. After a "click" sound, a small shot out towards her. Without a second thought, he reached out and blocked it.
###Chapter 168: Chapter 168 He’s Injured...
"Ouch..." 
So at that moment, Ye Ning, sitting there, only heard a muffled groan from a man, then turned around in shock to see beads of blood dripping down from the back of the large hand that had been shielding her eyes. 
My God! 
What had happened? 
She was terrified, and it wasn’t until the factory workers behind her began shouting and running over that she snapped out of it, dropping the jade stone in her hand and grabbing the large hand that was starting to retract: "Ou Mucen, are you okay?" 
Ou Mucen was also a bit dazed, probably not expecting it to be that serious. Seeing the fresh blood continuously dripping from the wound on his hand, he reflexively struggled a bit: "Let go!" 
Being a man, even if the injury were more severe, he would not be so delicate. 
But at that moment, the woman seemed completely deaf to what he was saying. Seeing the bleeding area, where a broken blade had stabbed into, she suddenly turned pale: "I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Ou Mucen, I didn’t mean to, I’ll take you to the hospital right now, is that okay?" 
Her expression was panicked and anxious, and seeing that the people in the factory had brought the emergency medical kit, she quickly grabbed some gauze and started to wrap his wound. 
Ou Mucen watched her the entire time. Seeing how panicked she became upon seeing his injury, losing even the most basic composure, suddenly, he stopped struggling and obediently let her dress his wound. 
Once the wound was tended, Ye Ning looked at him again: "Shall we go to the hospital?" 
Ou Mucen glanced down at his hand, now wrapped like a rice dumpling, and frowned: "Is it that serious?" 
Ye Ning nodded urgently: "It’s very serious, you need to get that broken blade out, or else your hand..." 
She didn’t continue her sentence, because at that moment, she felt truly guilty toward this man. 
If he hadn’t blocked the blade for her, it might have injured her instead, and the direction it was heading was precisely her left eye. If her eye had been damaged... 
Ye Ning suddenly could not bear to think any further! 
Fortunately, hearing that the blade needed to be removed, he did not refuse, and after addressing the immediate issue, the two headed to the hospital. 
"Hey, Secretary Gao!" 
"Yes, Third Young Master..." 
"Call Yang Cheng immediately and tell him there’s a problem with the carving machine. Have him replace all the carving machines." 
Replace all the blades? 
Secretary Gao on the other end of the phone paused: "Then... what should they be replaced with?" 
Replaced with what? 
The man sitting in the back glanced at the woman driving the car: "Replaced with what?" 
Ye Ning, who was driving, suddenly heard a comment from behind and didn’t realize it was addressed to her. 
"Ah? Are you asking me?" 
"Do you see anyone else in this car?"
Ye Ning: "..." 
Forget it, considering his injury, she wouldn’t hold it against him. 
"The jade provided by the Huo Family this time is all soft A-grade jadeite. Tell him to inquire with the previous factory to see what model is similar in strength to a manually operated carving blade?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." noveldrama
Secretary Gao chuckled upon hearing this on the phone: "Third Young Master, why don’t you just let An Ning talk to me, since it’s not convenient for you while driving." 
"..."
###Chapter 169: Chapter 169 She Aroused His Suspicion
Clutching the phone, the man whose face had suddenly turned sour, had hung up within just a few seconds. 
Ye Ning, driving the car, did not notice this. Instead, she saw that they were approaching the downtown area and thought of her son who was still in the hospital. Quite naturally, she steered the wheel toward the road leading to The First People’s Hospital. 
However, no sooner had she changed lanes, the man behind her spoke up, "Where are you going?" noveldrama
Ye Ning hastily pointed ahead: "To The First People’s Hospital." 
"Who told you to go to that hospital?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
If not to that hospital, then where? Wasn’t he very familiar with the head of that hospital? Going there would have been better for him. 
Ye Ning didn’t understand; being the heir of the Ou Family, an incident like this, if known by the family, would be such a hassle and blown out of proportion. 
And The First People’s Hospital happened to belong to the one with the biggest mouth, Ji Chengzhi! 
Ou Mucen, with a tight frown, looked out the window and saw a hospital not far ahead. He casually pointed and said, "Go there!" 
Ye Ning looked closely and saw that he was pointing to a second-tier hospital in the city. It wasn’t as well-known as The First People’s Hospital, but it was still a legitimate hospital. So, she had to redirect and head in that direction. 
"Why didn’t you go to The First People’s Hospital? Don’t you know the head of that hospital?" When they arrived at the hospital, Ye Ning couldn’t help but ask. 
At her words, Ou Mucen looked at her with a mocking expression, "You want to see your son, don’t you?" 
"What?" 
"Isn’t that so? Your son is in The First People’s Hospital. By asking me to go there, couldn’t you take the opportunity to visit him during working hours?" 
"..." 
Staring at him, Ye Ning was dumbfounded for several seconds before she proceeded to register him... 
What kind of person was this? In his eyes, was there no good person left? Did everyone who approached him have ulterior motives, a hidden agenda? Was he suffering from some kind of persecution complex due to being calculated against too often? 
Ye Ning went to the window to register him: "Nurse, I’d like to inquire if there are any good surgeons available?" 
"Yes, there are. Would you like to make an appointment with a specialist?" 
"Great!" 
Ye Ning wrote down his name and then handed it over. 
At that moment, Ou Mucen had just finished sending a message and saw her registering him at the payment window, so he instinctively looked over. 
Just then, he overheard a couple of sentences there. 
"Write down the date of birth as well." 
"Birthdate needs to be included in the registration?" 
"Of course, it’s the hospital’s policy!" 
"All right, here you go!" 
The little piece of paper handed in was returned, and afterward, Ou Mucen, standing there, watched as the woman at the window, which meant Ye Ning, casually wrote down a series of numbers and handed it back in. 
Ou Mucen was taken aback! 
How did she know his date of birth? 
He stood there, gazing at her silhouette, his eyes suddenly turning a shade darker... 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, unaware that she had inadvertently revealed information, took the registration slip and turned to walk towards him, "It’s all set. It’s on the third floor, with a specialist." 
Knowing his fussiness and that ordinary doctors seldom met his standards, she deliberately registered him for a specialist. 
Ou Mucen glanced at the medical card in her hand without commenting and headed towards the elevator. 
His birthdate, as listed in official documents, was actually not real. Public figures like him would certainly not disclose their true information on online media platforms.
###Chapter 170: Chapter 170: Such a Big Man is Not as Good as Xiaobao!
So, if she wants to know what she wrote, all she has to do is swipe this card. 
Ou Mucen saw the elevator reach the third floor, the doors opened, and right in front of him was the surgical department. He casually took the medical card from her hand, "I can go by myself." 
Ye Ning was stunned for a moment! 
He was going by himself? Could he manage it? A young master who has always been waited on, did he really know the procedure? 
Ye Ning didn’t feel at ease, so she followed. 
As expected, after grabbing the medical card, he arrived at the surgical department and started swiping it at the self-service machine next to the nurse’s front desk, "Hello, Mr. Ou Mucen, welcome to XX Hospital, you don’t have a prescription yet..." 
Hey! 
This man! 
Ye Ning saw and hurried over to take the card from his hand, "You only swipe this machine when it’s time to pay, you haven’t even seen the doctor yet, how can you swipe it?" 
While speaking, she took his card and went towards the expert consultation room. 
Ou Mucen didn’t leave, he was still looking at the screen, because at that moment, the information he wanted to know had already appeared. 
And that number was precisely his actual birth date... 
"Ou Mucen? Okay, it’s your turn, come quickly!" 
Just as he was looking, Ye Ning, who had already queued for him, called him out again. 
Ou Mucen stared at her, his gaze dark and deep, like the night sky engulfed in darkness, nothing clear, but the sense of danger was palpable to anyone. 
Such gaze frightened Ye Ning. Standing in front of him, she hesitated for a long time before finally asking, "What’s wrong with you?" 
His gaze was so threatening, he couldn’t be blaming her for hurting him, could he? 
Ye Ning began to feel uneasy... 
However, just when she stood there at a loss, his gaze suddenly became calm and, looking in the direction she indicated, he walked over with an expressionless face, "That room?" 
Ye Ning paused, then reacted and followed him, "It’s just ahead. I already briefly spoke with the doctor about your condition. He said you might need a minor surgery, are you... okay with that?" 
"Surgery?" 
"Yes, he needs to take it out!"
Ye Ning was really afraid he would get angry. He was a man with a bad temper and disliked hospitals the most. If he knew that surgery was involved, who knew what he might think? 
Sure enough, as soon as she finished speaking, he stopped. 
"Which doctor?" 
"An expert!" Ye Ning quickly replied. 
Then the man just stood there and let out a cold laugh, "I think you mean a quack, right? All this for a little issue that needs surgery?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
She stood there, watching him cautiously for a long time before finally saying, "Then perhaps... we should go to City No. 1 Hospital? Your friend is the director there, he..." noveldrama
Before she could finish, a chill gaze swept over her from above, she saw it and immediately shut her mouth. 
Was this man being childish? Xiaobao wasn’t afraid of injections or medicine, so why did it seem like a disaster when it came to him? Was he still the Ou Mucen who dominated the business world, the Crown Prince? 
Ye Ning turned her head to look elsewhere! 
Fortunately, after she mentioned going to City No. 1 Hospital, he finally pushed open the door of the consultation room and entered. 
"Ou Mucen, you’re Ou Mucen, right?" 
The doctor, an old man, saw them enter and asked him from behind his presbyopic glasses. 
That’s nonsense!
###Chapter 171: Chapter 171 She’s just an old maid...
Ye Ning saw the person next to her had already turned pale and quickly answered for him, "Yes, yes, Doctor, this is the patient I was just telling you about." 
"Then come over here and sit, what are you still standing there for? Come over here, open up the gauze, and let me have a look." 
The old doctor didn’t seem to recognize the famous people in this city. Seeing the young man stand there with a cold face, he peered at him through his bifocals and beckoned him over for a check-up. 
Upon seeing this, Ye Ning couldn’t care less about niceties and briskly grabbed the man’s arm, pulling him over! 
"Let go!" 
"Don’t be afraid, he’s just going to take a look at you. It might not be serious; maybe you’ll just need to use tweezers to take it out." Ye Ning was like an anxious old mother, worried this man might get scared by the old doctor in the consultation room. 
But as a result, the old doctor, rather than ignoring her, became suddenly stern upon hearing her, his beard nearly puffing up as he glared at her, "Young lady, if you don’t know, don’t talk nonsense. For foreign s embedded in the hand that exceed 3 millimeters, an incision is necessary!" 
Ye Ning: "..."
It took quite a while before she managed to drag the man in front of him! 
What kind of doctor was this, not seeing she was trying to soothe him? 
Alas! 
The damn old man! 
Fortunately, after being dragged over, the man stopped resisting and simply sat in the chair, expressionlessly watching the old doctor. 
Thus, Ye Ning stood there and watched as the old doctor unwrapped the gauze on his hand, examining it for a while before, without warning, he picked up a bundle of cotton with tweezers from the disinfectant beside him and wiped it across his wound. 
In an instant, Ye Ning only heard the man sitting next to her furrow his brows tightly and his hand reflexively shrank back! 
How painful that must be!! 
Ye Ning became anxious in no time, "Be gentle, Doctor, he has never suffered this much!" 
With that one sentence, the atmosphere in the consultation room suddenly quieted down. 
Ye Ning didn’t realize, until she felt two gazes staring straight at her, that she suddenly snapped out of it and quickly explained, "I mean...you’re a young master, and you surely haven’t suffered like this since you were a child, right?" 
Ou Mucen stared at her coldly, his deep and black eyes that had not a hint of light in them were terrifying to behold! 
Damn, had he started to suspect something? 
In a flash, Ye Ning’s palms were all sweaty. She wanted to explain further, but just at that moment, the man’s pupils suddenly constricted, and a muffled grunt came out of his mouth, "Hmm—" 
"It hurts, right? There’s no helping it, you need to bear with it a little. This is where the finger nerves are the most concentrated, and I can’t give you anesthesia or it might damage the nerves. Bear with it, it’ll be over quickly!" 
"..." 
Ye Ning was stunned! 
No anesthesia? How painful that must be to have such a big cut and to directly extract something from inside... noveldrama
Ye Ning lowered her head and saw the old doctor casually continue as the man sitting beside her already started to sweat profusely. Suddenly, she didn’t know what came over her, but she blurted out, "How can you not use anesthesia? I’ve seen other doctors use it. Are you simply unable to do so?" 
"What did you say?" 
"Isn’t that so? This..." 
"Out!!" 
Just as Ye Ning and the old doctor were about to start arguing, the man who had been sitting in the chair without making much noise suddenly clenched his teeth and sternly shouted this one word.
###Chapter 172: Chapter 172: It was the first time he had suffered so much, all because of her!
As soon as she opened her mouth, the tense atmosphere of the consultation room suddenly quieted down. 
Ye Ning was startled for a moment! 
Was he telling her to leave? 
She bit her lip, and it took her a while to come to her senses. Then, she looked at the doctor, who was staring at her with anger, and at the man beside her, whose forehead was covered in cold sweat and who radiated an aura of irritability. She quickly turned around and left the consultation room... 
Oh my God! 
Was she possessed? What was she doing? How did she start arguing with the doctor? 
She slapped her cheeks several times with force, and after running to the hall and taking several deep breaths in front of the air conditioner, she finally calmed herself down... 
This was too horrifying! 
Once she had calmed down, she returned to the doorway of the consultation room. This time, however, she did not enter, standing outside instead, while she took out her phone to call Lin Yebai. 
"Hello? Brother Lin!" 
"Aning? You’re back?" 
Ye Ning quickly looked back, "No, I’m at XX Hospital. Ou Mucen hurt his hand trying to save me!" 
"What did you say?" Lin Yebai was shocked to hear this on the other end, "He got hurt saving you?" 
Ye Ning nodded her head and gave a brief explanation of what had happened. Of course, she hid the fact that she had known there was something wrong with the jade sample from early on. 
Learning that Ou Mucen had been injured while blocking a blade, Lin Yebai furrowed his brows tightly, "You’re too rash. The difference in the stress that a handcrafted knife and a machine blade can take is huge. How could you take such a risk? If he hadn’t shielded you, you could have lost your eyesight." 
Ye Ning quickly admitted her fault, "Yes, so now I’m here with him at the hospital to remove the blade. Brother Lin, once he’s better, I’ll come right back." 
Lin Yebai gave a noncommittal "Hmm" on the phone, then did not say anything more before hanging up. 
Of course, he wouldn’t say anything. After all, that man had been injured because of her. It was only right for her to be with him in the hospital now, taking care of him. 
But Ye Ning, hearing that he wasn’t angry or insisting on her returning, sighed in relief after hanging up the phone. Just then, the consultation room outside started calling the next number, so she hurried over. 
Indeed, as soon as she reached the door, it opened. 
The moment it did, she saw a man whose face was somewhat pale and whose forehead was covered in cold sweat, walking out with one hand that had just been re-bandaged. 
Upon seeing him, Ye Ning quickly approached, "Is it out already?" 
Ou Mucen didn’t say a word, just staring with a stern face, tilting his head back and squinting at the ceiling. 
Ye Ning didn’t quite understand until she noticed sweat beads still rolling down his temples; that’s when she quickly supported him, "Ou Mucen, are you alright?" 
"I’m going to the restroom for a bit, take this and handle it." He finally spoke, sounding a bit tired and hoarse, and it seemed he had really suffered a lot in the consultation room.
Ye Ning hurriedly took the paper from his hand. 
"Alright, I’ll get your medicine. As soon as I have it, I’ll come find you here." 
"Hmm." 
With just that "Hmm," he headed toward the restroom. 
Ye Ning watched him go, then took the two papers to pay for the medication and pick it up. 
In fact, even up to now after everything that happened, she still found it hard to believe. 
Who was this man? He was none other than the third young master of the Ou Family!noveldrama
###Chapter 173: Chapter 173: Damn! Who has provoked him again?
Who is this man? That’s the third young master of the Ou Family. 
The third young master of the Ou Family, he is a notorious rich second-generation in A City. He is arrogant and looks down on people, seeing no one but himself. It’s even less likely for him to lend a hand to save someone. 
So at this moment, Ye Ning still felt somewhat horrified and thought she must be dreaming. 
However, she couldn’t deny that after this incident, her impression of him wasn’t as bad as before. 
After getting the prescription and paying for it, and then collecting the medicine, she wanted to find him on the third floor, but as she turned around, she found that he came out of the elevator while on the phone. 
"Who’s come over?" 
"Miss Fina from London, the designer you asked me to contact. She has arrived today, and she insists... that you personally pick her up, third young master!" 
The last part, Secretary Gao said almost on tenterhooks over the phone. 
It’s not his fault. If anyone was to blame, it was because the designer he was asked to contact was too prominent. Fina, the internationally renowned jewelry designer. How could he not personally receive such a distinguished guest he had invited? 
"Third young master, according to the information I’ve received, your niece indeed went to Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry, and not only that, but she also brought her teacher along. It looks like this time, we really need to seize the opportunity." 
"So what?" 
"Heh, third young master, I’m really willing to do this favor for you, but, Miss Fina, the grand designer, won’t give me the time of day. I... can’t help." 
By the end of it, Secretary Gao was even teasing his BOSS. 
So standing there with the medicine, Ye Ning only saw the man’s expression darken before he immediately hung up the phone! 
Damn it!
Who’s annoyed him again?!! Doesn’t he know she’s serving him right now?!! 
Ye Ning felt like cursing... 
As she walked over and handed over the medicine, he didn’t even look at her and headed straight for the exit, "Come with me to the airport!" 
Huh? Ah!! 
To the airport? 
Why? She still needed to take care of Xiaobao! 
Ye Ning hurriedly chased after him, "What are you going to do at the airport? Weren’t you going to the company? I’ll take you there instead." 
"When I tell you to go, just go. Why all the nonsense?" 
"But I need to take care of my child. You know, my son is staying at the hospital, and I haven’t been there all day today. It’s my master who’s been looking after him." 
Ye Ning stood on the steps, looking at the man who had already reached his car, and mustered the courage to say this. 
Indeed, it wasn’t that she was unwilling to go to the airport, but she really needed to return to take care of Xiaobao. She had troubled Lin Yebai enough for one day. If he were heading to the company, she would be glad to drive him; it wasn’t far, and she could come back right away. 
Fortunately, after hearing this, he looked up at her, frowning, and after a moment, reached out his hand, "Give me the keys..." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning quickly handed over the keys, "Or should I call Secretary Gao for you? To have him drive you there?" 
"You don’t need to worry about it, you can leave now!" 
He was indeed decisive. Taking the keys from her, he began to shoo her away. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning had no choice but to step aside, watching him take the keys, open the car door, and climb into the driver’s seat. 
In truth, she wasn’t reluctant to go; he’d been injured because of her, so how could she be unwilling to help him? But she really needed to go back now. Lin Yebai also had his matters to attend to, and she had imposed on him for so long; she felt embarrassed to do so any further.noveldrama
###Chapter 174: Chapter 174 She Ultimately Couldn’t Bear It
So she stood there, watching him start the car, before she prepared to leave. 
However, just as she was about to walk away, she suddenly received a call from Lin Yebai. He said on the phone that Qiao Feiyu was off today and had already arrived at the hospital to take care of Xiaobao. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning, without a second thought, ran toward the black Bentley that had just pulled out and was now waiting for the traffic light at the intersection. 
He had injured his hand for her, and she certainly didn’t want to see anything happen to him. 
"Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen?" 
The sound insulation of the Bentley was very good, and besides, he always preferred not to open the windows while driving, keeping himself tightly enclosed inside. 
Therefore, at that moment, Ye Ning went over to the driver’s side and knocked on his window. 
Hearing someone knocking at the window, Ou Mucen, who was setting the navigation system, rolled the window down and asked, "What are you doing here?" 
What an attitude! 
Isn’t there a hint of surprise? noveldrama
Ye Ning was somewhat taken aback by his signature impatience, "Nothing, I just came to ask. My master just called and said his sister went to take care of Xiaobao. Do you still want me to drive you to the airport?" 
Ou Mucen paused for a moment! 
She specially ran over here just for this? 
Sitting there, he looked at the woman who ran to his car, gasping for air, and after a while, he finally unbuckled his seatbelt and moved to sit in the back seat. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning breathed a sigh of relief, opened the door and got in; she immediately started the car, "Which airport? Liuhua? Or Changhong?" 
A City has two airports, one in the north and one in the south. She needed to clarify this; otherwise, if she took the wrong route, it would be more than a hundred kilometers there and back. 
After asking the question, the man in the back tossed a sentence over indifferently, "Liuhua, for the specifics, look at my phone." 
After he spoke, there was a "thud," and something was thrown into the armrest box. 
Ye Ning looked down to see that it was his mobile phone! 
Hey! 
This man! 
Seeing this, Ye Ning almost tossed the phone back at him. 
Didn’t he have a shred of humanity? She was helping him by driving, and now he wanted her to check this too? Didn’t he know that she was driving? 
Looking up with resentment to the rearview mirror, she was about to rebuke him, but then, seeing the man in the mirror already leaning back in his seat with his eyes closed, she remembered that he had just had shards of a blade removed at the hospital, and she swallowed the words she was going to say. 
Forget it, endure whatever debt is owed to him! 
Without disturbing him any further, she drove straight onto the highway. 
-- 
An hour later, near Liuhua Airport- 
Ye Ning was just about to pick up the phone to check the exact location when suddenly, someone made a call to the phone... 
"Hello?" 
"President Ou, have you arrived yet? I’ve been waiting for you for a long time. When are you coming over?" It was an extremely coquettish and whiny voice. 
Upon hearing it, Ye Ning almost instantly got goosebumps all over her body. 
Who was this person anyway? Could it be that this man was coming to the airport today to pick someone up? And that someone was this woman? 
Holding the phone, Ye Ning glanced at the man in the backseat through the rearview mirror. Seeing that he was still sleeping, she had no choice but to respond with his mobile phone, "Sorry, I’ll be there soon. May I ask where you are?" 
"Who are you? How come President Ou’s phone is with you?"
###Chapter 175: Chapter 175: Who Is He Going to Pick Up?
Why did these women always say the same thing when they heard she was answering his call? 
Ye Ning patiently explained, "I am Mr. Ou’s assistant, and I’ve come to pick you up today." 
"Where is he, then? Didn’t he come?" 
"He did come, he’s just sitting in the back..." 
"Let him take the call!" The woman on the phone commanded her to hand the phone to its owner with an imperative tone. noveldrama
Ye Ning’s brow finally furrowed tightly, just as she was about to explain further, a cold voice suddenly came from behind, "Hang up, head directly to T Station’s B12 exit." 
Ye Ning looked up and realized that, at some point, the man behind her had woken up. 
So she really did hang up the phone, not caring how the woman on the other end reacted to the sound of his voice, yelling and shouting, because with one press of a finger, she hung up the phone. 
After hanging up, she saw the person in the rearview mirror and couldn’t help but ask, "Third Young Master Ou, who was that? Were you supposed to pick someone up today?" 
"A designer named Fina, have you heard of her?" 
He didn’t hide anything, perhaps because she was specifically recruited by him to manage the Yuzhirun project. 
Fina? 
Ye Ning truly was surprised to hear this name, "Yes, I’ve Heard of her. She’s a big shot; I heard that even the British Royal Family’s jewelry is designed by her." 
"Is that so? You seem to know quite a lot!" 
Ye Ning immediately offered a sheepish smile, "I did this kind of work following my mentor, so naturally, I know a bit about these things. However, Fina’s specialty is Western jewelry. Can she really handle our jade and jadeite too?" 
Ou Mucen looked out indifferently, "A good jewelry designer won’t reduce their design capability due to a change in materials, unless they simply aren’t qualified to be a designer." 
Ye Ning was taken aback! 
His words were harsh, but she couldn’t deny that what he said was indeed a fact. 
A top designer who couldn’t handle the materials of jewelry wouldn’t deserve the title "top-tier." 
She didn’t ask any further, drove the car over, and arrived at the B12 exit of T Station where, sure enough, a tall, blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty was being waved over eagerly by a young girl in a fashionable miniskirt, "Ou Mucen! Ou Mucen, we’re over here!" 
There was another person? 
Ye Ning, noticing the young girl waving her hands energetically, drove over. 
Fina was Canadian, certainly the blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty in the back, but who was this young girl in a miniskirt? Judging by her tone, calling out the man’s name directly, she seemed quite familiar with him. 
"Oh my dear Mr. Ou, you’ve finally arrived. Do you have any idea how long I’ve been waiting for you here?" 
As soon as the car stopped there, the young girl with the chestnut-colored large wavy curls immediately walked toward them and, seeing Ou Mucen sitting in the back, she promptly opened his car door. 
Upon seeing her, Ou Mucen instinctively dodged, "Why have you come back too?" 
The girl immediately leaned on the car window and smiled at him, "Can’t I come back? I was the one who found her for you. What’s wrong with coming to have a meal with you? Oh, my God, what happened to your hand? Let me see." 
Her tone was exaggerated and familiar, and her actions were all the more ambiguous and intimate...
###Chapter 176: Chapter 176: Attracting Bees and Butterflies Everywhere
Ye Ning: "..."
Forget it, she might as well get out of the car and help that blonde beauty with her luggage. 
So, she unbuckled her seatbelt, pushed the door open, and walked over to the blonde beauty who was still standing there, left to wait: "Hello, I am Mr. Ou’s assistant. I am very welcome to you." 
(Hi, I’m Mr. Ou’s assistant, very pleased to welcome you!) 
The blonde beauty, who was feeling somewhat awkward from being left there, suddenly saw a delicate-looking girl get out of the Bentley and greet her. She instantly became very happy: "Thank you. I’m Vanna!" 
"My name is An Ning, and you can call me Xiao’an!" 
With her fluent English, complemented by her soft voice, gentle as a spring breeze, the two of them were surprisingly hitting it off quite well outside. 
The young girl who had been leaning against the car window and blocking the man inside from exiting finally noticed this scene, immediately, her gaze turned somewhat cold: "Is this your new assistant?" 
Ou Mucen also noticed this scene, and he had yet to realize that she was capable of speaking such fluent English. 
"Yes, why?" 
"She seems pretty good, clever, knows how to read the room, articulate, and quite capable. It’s just that her looks are a bit lacking." noveldrama
"Move aside!" 
The man, already very impatient with her blocking the door, said curtly and pushed her out of the way to get out of the car. 
Upon seeing this, the girl’s delicate little face immediately became pinched: "Ou Mucen, you hurt me!" 
That voice was truly... 
Ye Ning felt goosebumps on her skin and turned around to see the man previously blocked in the car finally come out. She quickly smiled at the blonde beauty before her: "I apologize, our Mr. Ou has come over. You two can talk, I’ll go handle the luggage." 
After speaking, she picked up two suitcases from the ground. 
Just then, Ou Mucen came over and, seeing this scene, naturally said, "Call security over, let them take it." 
Security? 
Ye Ning noticed indeed there were airport security staff nearby moving luggage for guests, so she nodded and dragged them over. 
These two suitcases, indeed quite large, who knows what was in them. 
After calling security over, Ye Ning was about to have them put the two suitcases in the trunk, but at that moment, the girl who had been clinging to Ou Mucen came over. Seeing Ye Ning moving things, she just stood there with her arms folded, and asked coolly, "So you’re Mucen’s new assistant?" 
Ye Ning glanced at her and nodded: "That’s right, my name is An Ning." 
An Ning? 
The girl savored the name: "I see you’re quite capable. Have you been doing this for a long time?" 
"Not really, less than a month." 
"Less than a month, and you dare to take calls for him?" 
Take calls? 
Ye Ning didn’t react immediately! 
What’s wrong with taking calls? Shouldn’t she? He was asleep at the time. 
Ye Ning felt this woman’s question was a little incomprehensible: "As an assistant to the CEO, it’s perfectly normal to take a phone call when the CEO is asleep, isn’t it?" 
Indeed, she was his assistant, what was wrong with her taking calls for him? She had even managed work using his phone for him. 
What kind of people are these? 
Ye Ning didn’t want to deal with her any longer and continued to direct the moving of luggage, but at this moment, the woman came up with another line: "I’m not asking whether you should take the call or not, but how you were able to take it?" 
"Huh?" 
"His phone has a password, don’t you know?"
###Chapter 177: Chapter 177: What Is This Woman’s Identity?
The phone has a password? 
Ye Ning was startled again! 
Right, his phone indeed had a password, but she didn’t need a password to answer the call. What on earth was she talking about? 
Ye Ning was getting impatient, "Mr. Ou’s phone does have a password, but I don’t need it to answer calls for him. Does your question have anything to do with me taking his calls?" 
"Of course, it does. His phone is custom-made, and even when answering calls, an invisible password would lock the phone, preventing others from answering it. If you don’t know the password, how could you possibly answer his phone?"
Is that so? 
Ye Ning was truly stopped in her tracks by this statement. 
Did she enter a password when she answered the phone just now? 
She really couldn’t remember; there might have been, or there might not have been. But she could not deny that she indeed knew the password to his phone. 
123456, easy to remember! 
But what did that have to do with her? 
Finally, Ye Ning put down what she was holding and, standing there like the other woman, stared coldly at her, "Yes, I do know his password, but what business is that of yours? Is there a problem with a personal assistant knowing the president’s phone password?" 
"You—" 
Just a few simple words immediately rendered the woman speechless. 
Correct, she knew that man’s phone password, but how did that concern her? With what right was she questioning this matter? Did she have the authority? 
Ye Ning, seeing the woman whose face had turned green in an instant from being shut down by her, sneered, ignored her, and turned to close the trunk before walking towards the two people who were still talking. 
"Third Young Master, everything is packed away. Shall we head back?" 
"Hmm..." 
Ou Mucen gave a faint nod before inviting the blonde to come towards the car. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning also promptly took the car keys and went to the driver’s seat. 
His hand was hurt; naturally, she had to drive the car. Otherwise, she would not have brought him to the airport. 
But what she didn’t expect was that just as she had slipped into the car, the woman who had just been cowed by her swiftly ran over to the blonde who was about to open the back door, "Fina, you should sit in the front. It’s your first time in A City, and you can enjoy the view from the front seat." 
Implicit in her words was the suggestion that the guest should sit in the co-driver’s seat next to Ye Ning, while she herself would sit in the back with the man who had not yet entered. 
From inside the car, Ye Ning shook her head... 
Indeed, no matter where this man went, he always attracted women. First, it was that mayor’s daughter, and now there was this kind of woman. Didn’t he ever get tired? 
Ye Ning stopped paying attention to these things, inserted the key, and started the car, then began to set the navigation for the trip back. 
"A City Ou Corporation Tower, approximately 120 kilometers, about one hour..." 
"Not to Ou Corporation Tower, go to Nanhu Island!" 
"Huh?" 
Ye Ning opened her mouth wide, surprised at the man who had gotten into the car and sat beside her. 
Why was he sitting here? Wasn’t he supposed to go to the back? There was a delicate beauty waiting for him there, wasn’t there? 
But what about the person who came in? 
He didn’t even look at her, fastened his seatbelt, then took out his phone and began to busy himself with it. noveldrama
Seeing this, Ye Ning withdrew her gaze and looked through the rearview mirror to see the woman who had entered the back. At that moment, with a completely green face, Ye Ning couldn’t express how good she felt inside.
###Chapter 178: Chapter 178: What the hell! When did he become someone’s brother-in-law?
What a masochist! 
After hearing about the trip to Nanhu Island, Ye Ning changed direction, and then, the four of them finally began their journey back. 
Ye Ning knew about Nanhu Island; it was A City’s famous scenic island and developed by the Ous. The last time, that bastard forced her into submission by taking Xiaobao and Qiao Feiyu there. 
So, that’s why he asked her to take them there, to eat? 
"Die, the Nanhu Island that Mr. Ou mentioned just now, what place is that?" 
"That place, huh?" noveldrama
From the back seat, Fina, who had just heard about this destination, also asked. 
However, the woman still seething from her own rejected anger did not seem too keen on replying, "That’s our A City’s scenic island, the best hotel in the city is there." 
"Oh, really? That’s wonderful, Die, your brother-in-law is really not bad. It seems like you were right to introduce me to him." 
"..." 
Brother-in-law?
Ye Ning, surprised by the term, glanced at the rearview mirror. 
This woman is actually calling him brother-in-law? Ridiculous! How could an unmarried man become someone’s brother-in-law? 
Similarly, Ou Mucen, who had just turned on his phone, also heard this, and upon hearing the woman introduce him as her brother-in-law, his handsome face suddenly turned ugly. 
"Chen Die, what kind of nonsense have you been telling your friends outside? Who allowed you to talk about our relationship like that?" 
The woman in the back deflated her mouth, "Did I say anything wrong? You and my sister did have a relationship. It was only after my sister was gone that you became single. Who in A City doesn’t know about it?" 
"What nonsense are you talking about? Who had a relationship with your sister?" 
"I’m not talking nonsense. Even the media reporters caught it on camera, so how is that nonsense?" 
Ou Mucen’s forehead throbbed with veins! 
Seeing that things were going south, Ye Ning quickly intervened, "Alright, alright, Miss Chen is just young, Mr. Ou, give her a break!" 
"Mind your own business. It’s not your place to speak up here, you little assistant." 
Unexpectedly, instead of cooling down, her attempted mediation resulted only in the woman lashing out at her with a cursor. 
Ye Ning’s face also fell upon hearing this, and she was just about to retaliate when the man beside her suddenly demanded, "Stop the car!" 
Huh? 
Stop the car? 
Ye Ning, confused, looked at him, "Now?" 
"Yes! Kick her out!" 
"..." 
The air froze for a good ten seconds, and only then did the sound of someone trying to suppress tears and sobbing become audible in the car. 
Ye Ning heard it, glanced in the rearview mirror, and after a long moment, she didn’t stop the car but continued to drive forward. 
So this girl was the second young miss of the Chen Family... 
Ye Ning remembered an incident that had occurred years ago. 
The Chen family’s daughter was actually the bride-to-be handpicked by Ou’s elder for his son, belonging to one of A City’s four big families, the Chen Family. 
And this Chen family daughter was precisely Ou Mucen’s classmate, reportedly from high school all the way to university. 
So when the news came out, many people felt they were a good match, and some even said that the two of them were already in love. For a time, the couple dominated the entertainment headlines. 
But the truth was, Ye Ning had seen that Chen family’s daughter come to Orchid Garden looking for him, but this man? 
He never let her enter his villa. 
There were also several instances where Ye Ning watched her leave with tearful eyes. 
Until one day, she was in a car accident. 
Ye Ning gripped the steering wheel tighter...
###Chapter 179: Chapter 179: She Doesn’t Want to Be a Third Wheel
After Ou Mucen threatened to throw her overboard, the second young miss of the Chen Family, who sat in the back, dared not make any more trouble. She obediently sat all the way until the several people finally arrived at Nanhu Wharf. 
"Third Young Master, when you go to Nanhu Island, do you want me to inform Secretary Gao to pick you up?" 
Upon arriving at the wharf, Ye Ning saw the boat in front and knew they wouldn’t need a car. So naturally, she asked the person beside her. 
Ou Mucen was looking at his phone at the moment. Hearing her question, he didn’t lift his head, "Why should we inform Secretary Gao? Aren’t you here?" 
"But I..." 
"Come over together. When we get back, send them to the hotel. I’m going back to the company!" Having said that, he opened the door and got out of the car. 
Ye Ning watched and sat there, really choking back something for a long, long time... 
Is this what people call shooting oneself in the foot? She kindly offered to take him to the airport, and now, tied up like this, she had to follow him for everything. 
Ye Ning got out of the car feeling gloomy, and seeing the two women who had already left the car and were waiting, she had no choice but to go to the wharf to arrange for the boat. 
"Hello, is Ou Corporation’s speedboat available?" 
"Yes, yes, yes. How many of you are there?" 
"Four of us, a fast one!" 
Ye Ning was eager to get this group sorted out and then take them back to the hotel so she could be free. 
Fortunately, as soon as the staff heard it was the boss’s company, they immediately brought out the best speedboat. Afterward, Ye Ning stood there, watching as they each boarded the boat. 
"Ann, do you want to sit with me?" 
After getting on the speedboat, Fina, who had already become quite friendly in conversation, immediately invited her to sit by her side. 
Ye Ning looked and saw that the spot in front was already taken by Chen Die, who was currently snuggled up tightly against the man beside her. 
Thereupon, she nodded gently and took a seat next to her, while Chen Die, seeing this scene, felt even more triumphant. 
"Third Young Master, I was wrong just now. Don’t be angry; I won’t act up like that again." As soon as she sat down, Ye Ning heard her cautiously explaining to the man beside her from behind. 
Third Young Master? 
The title was much more respectful now, unlike the exaggerated familiarity at the beginning. 
Ye Ning looked toward the blonde beauty beside her and saw that her safety belt was not fastened. She took the initiative to fasten it for her: "Miss Fina, is this your first time on a speedboat? Don’t worry, we will arrive very soon." 
Fina was indeed a bit nervous. She wasn’t afraid of water, but she had never been on such a transport, so it was inevitable to feel a bit anxious. 
However, having seen this girl take care of her all along and comfort her, she wasn’t as scared anymore. Instead, she slightly curved her bright blue eyes and looked at her happily, "Ann, you are a really good friend. It’s my luck to have met you!" 
These Westerners sure do express their feelings quickly! 
Ye Ning held her hand, smiled, and looked forward... noveldrama
In fact, she was the one who got seasick! 
!!! 
The speedboat arrived at Nanhu Island after ten minutes. Once ashore, the hotel manager had been waiting with the sightseeing car. Seeing everyone arrive, he hurried over to greet them, "Mr. Ou, the restaurant has been prepared; I will take you and everyone there right away." 
Ou Mucen nodded and led the two women behind him onto the sightseeing car. 
Fina boarded as well, but when she turned around, she didn’t see the girl who had looked after her all the way. She immediately looked back, "Ann, why aren’t you coming up?"
###Chapter 180: Chapter 180: He Doesn’t Seem To Be That Inhumane!
Ye Ning felt a bit unwell, "I need to go to the restroom, you guys go ahead." 
After waving her hand, she didn’t wait to see their reaction and covered her mouth as she hurried toward the restroom. 
When Chen Die saw this from the car, she immediately made a sarcastic remark, "If you can’t handle it, then why come at all? Why make yourself suffer?" 
Fina heard this and got a little upset, "Die, how can you say that? It’s for us that An came over." 
"Na—" Chen Die was called out and her face turned red with embarrassment. 
As the atmosphere in the car suddenly tensed up, Ou Mucen, who had finally finished his call, saw the scene and spoke up with a dark tone, "What’s the noise about? Chen Die, don’t forget that she’s your friend." 
"But..." noveldrama
"All right, what are you still doing standing here? Why aren’t you heading to the hotel?" 
"Yes, President Ou!" 
The manager, eager for the CEO to say this, quickly agreed and then led them to the hotel first. 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, after entering the restroom, rested herself for a good ten minutes before the nausea in her stomach subsided a bit. 
Seasickness is indeed uncomfortable! 
After calming down, she checked the time, realizing she had been delayed for quite a while. She washed her face and then came out. 
"Assistant An, you’ve finally come out. Are you feeling better? Here’s some medicated oil, it’s specially for people who get seasick like you." 
Unexpectedly, as soon as she exited the restroom, she saw the manager waiting outside with a sightseeing car and he even passed her a bottle of water and gave her a tube of medicated oil. 
Ye Ning was surprised, taking the items from his hand, she was shocked, "Why did you come to pick me up? I could have walked over by myself." 
The manager smiled, "President Ou asked me to come get you. Come on, they’ve already arrived at the hotel." 
After he spoke, he opened the door of the sightseeing car. 
Ye Ning saw this and was stunned for a while... 
Did Mucen ask him to come? 
She remembered rushing to the restroom earlier and indeed saw the man with the cellphone look at her as he got on the car. Suddenly, warmth spread inexplicably through her heart. 
It seems he isn’t as heartless as I thought! 
-- 
Riding the sightseeing car to the hotel, the first three who arrived had already seated themselves in the luxurious island hotel, a sight that was breathtakingly beautiful. At that moment, they were happily chatting while enjoying the view outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. 
"Mucen, let’s have a get-together tonight. It’s been so long since we last gathered. Call Jicheng and Young Master Zhan over tonight." 
"I don’t have time!" 
"There’s always time to be found. Besides, it’s not during the day, it’s at night. Are you still that busy in the evening?" 
It was hard to tell when the woman had changed into a striking red long dress, but there she was sitting next to the man, as coquettish as one could be, even her speaking was laced with coquetry. 
Although she still dared not sit too close to him, the sight was still an eyesore. 
Ye Ning walked over and, seeing this, didn’t disturb them. Instead, she sat down next to the blond-haired, blue-eyed beauty opposite them.
This woman really has some nerve to still be clinging on like this. 
As she sat down, the blonde beauty noticed her arrival and was overjoyed, "An, you’re back? Are you alright?" 
Ye Ning quickly nodded, "I’m fine, haven’t they served the food yet? What would you like to eat?" 
Fina had been left hanging there for a while, and upon finally being asked, she eagerly answered, "I heard their king crab here is delicious. I want to have that."
###Chapter 181: Chapter 181: You could cook yourself for her to eat!
Ha-ha, this Canadian beauty is really cute... 
Ye Ning motioned to the waitress when she heard this, ready to order the King crab for her, but at this moment, the red-dressed woman across from them, who had been fawning over Ou Mucen, suddenly stared at Ye Ning and declared, "I want the imported Australian lobster!" 
What? 
The imported Australian lobster? 
Ye Ning looked at the waitress, only to notice that upon hearing this, the waitress’s face immediately showed a look of difficulty, "The Australian lobster is reserved by our guest, and there’s only one." 
Only one?
Ye Ning frowned, "In that case, forget about it and choose something else." 
Her tone was crisp and decisive, and her attitude left no room for negotiation. After speaking, she directly picked up the menu on the table and flipped it open. noveldrama
Chen Die, watching from across the table, was dumbfounded on the spot! 
The man beside her twitched at the corner of his eyes after witnessing the scene! 
Was this their idea of post-work entertainment? 
After about five seconds of stunned silence, just as Ye Ning was about to finish selecting her dishes, the woman across from her finally exploded, "Who are you to tell me to eat something else? Do you own this hotel? 
Ye Ning lifted her head, her brows twisted even tighter, "Naturally, I don’t own it! However, as a friend of our CEO, shouldn’t you consider the CEO’s business interests? If you eat the lobster that a guest has reserved, how can the CEO explain it to the guest?" 
"I..." 
With just one simple sentence, she had completely silenced the unreasonable woman. 
The lobster was reserved by a guest, after all, and there was only one in the entire hotel, imported from Australia. If she ate it, what would the guest eat? 
Utterly unreasonable! 
What Ye Ning hadn’t expected, though, was that after being rebuffed by her, the woman, irritated, turned to the man beside her and started to act sweetly, "Mucen, I want to eat that lobster, it’s been so long since I’ve been back, Mucen..." 
Smack!! 
It was just too much to take in. Caught off guard, Ye Ning’s hand shook, and the entire menu fell from her grasp! 
As the menu hit the floor, sharp glances from across the table immediately swept over, and Ye Ning, feeling awkward, quickly picked it back up, "My apologies, I didn’t hold it firmly. So, Mr. Ou, shall we cook the lobster for her?" 
"You can cook yourself for her!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
The atmosphere began to plunge into freezing point, and in this moment, at the dining table, none of the three women, including Chen Die, dared to speak another word. 
Fortunately, it wasn’t long before someone called for the man, and after glancing at his phone, he stood up and left. 
As soon as he left, the tension at the dining table finally eased. Fina, who had been mostly quiet so far, quickly tried to smooth things over, "Okay, Die, let’s just eat the King crab. The King crab is also delicious." 
Chen Die’s face flushed and paled in turns, her expression as colorful as if she were in a dye workshop—truly a spectacle to behold. 
Indeed, being slapped in the face a second time, and so bluntly, would be more than anyone could bear. 
Ignoring the two hateful glares sweeping her way, Ye Ning picked up the menu again and after ordering two King crabs with the waitress, sat there and began to chat with the blonde beauty. 
"Miss Fina, are you here to work at Ou Corporation this time?"
###Chapter 182: Chapter 182: Did You Resign Today?
Fina nodded, "I heard you specialize in jade. I’ve grown a bit tired of Western jewelry over the years, so I wanted to give it a try." 
So that was the case! 
Ye Ning understood her intention, and she felt quite pleased about it. 
Although she was preparing to resign, she still hoped that Ou Mucen’s jewelry business would rise quickly. Only then could she strike from both sides in the company Lin Yebai had arranged for her and completely crush the Longfeng of the Ou Family’s second house. 
As they were chatting, Ye Ning’s phone suddenly beeped with a message. She looked down and realized it was from the man who had just left. 
"Miss Chen, Miss Fina, I’m sorry, our boss has a meeting and has returned to the office. After you finish eating here, I will send you back." 
"What? Mucen left? How is that possible? Are you trying to fool me?" 
Fool you? 
Is it necessary? 
Ye Ning sneered, "Don’t believe it? Then call him." 
Chen Die instantly turned red with embarrassment, "You—" 
Call him? 
Only if she wanted to die! 
Seeing her reaction, Ye Ning no longer paid her any attention, and after giving her a cold glance, stood up with the blonde beauty, "Miss Fina, let me take you to the hotel then. Don’t worry, you’re a highly-paid designer hired by our company. The boss will certainly not neglect you, and I’ve been informed of all the arrangements."
Fina hurriedly nodded, "Okay..." 
She then looked at her friend, "What about Die..." 
Ye Ning glanced at her dismissively, "Miss Fina, don’t worry. The boss said her home is nearby, she will manage on her own." With that, she walked away with Fina. 
Chen Die was left sitting there, it took her a few seconds to react before she stood up and started cursing at the departing figures, "An Ning, you bitch! I won’t let you off!" 
Humph! 
Not letting her off? 
She had to make her move early. Otherwise, Ye Ning’s list of enemies was long and growing. By the time her turn came, it might be too late. 
Ye Ning, accompanied by her guest, headed straight on her return journey... noveldrama
An hour later, she had finally arranged everything and was driving the Bentley back to the city. 
Arriving at the city hospital, she had assumed Qiao Feiyu would be taking care of the child, but to her surprise, when she reached the ward, she saw Lin Yebai still there. 
"Yebai? I thought Xiaoyu would be here?" 
"Mm, she just left. She has classes tonight." 
Lin Yebai seemed calm enough, and when he saw her return, he even brought her a glass of water. 
But at the mention of Qiao Feiyu leaving, Ye Ning’s heart skipped a beat, and suddenly she became very nervous. 
Previously, she had agreed to send that person to the airport because she thought Qiao Feiyu was here. With Qiao Feiyu, since their relationship was that of sisters and best friends, conversations were much easier. 
But this man was different. To her, he was a mentor, a friend, and almost like an elder. Such a relationship not only filled her with gratitude, but it also made her somewhat reverential. 
Taking the glass of water, she didn’t dare to go see the child first, instead, she hurriedly began explaining, "I’m sorry, Yebai, I had to go to the airport this afternoon to pick someone up for him. He’s injured, you know that, I am really sorry." 
Lin Yebai gave her a nonchalant look, "It’s alright, I didn’t have much to do anyway. But, have you settled your affairs?" 
"Ah?" 
"I mean the matter of resigning!" 
Resigning?! 
Hearing this, Ye Ning’s heart jolted again! 
Great, she had forgotten to even mention it today!
###Chapter 183: Chapter 183: Mom, Actually Uncle Bingkuai Is Pretty Good Too
"Brother Lin, today... nothing yet, don’t worry, I’ll go find him tomorrow." 
"Why not just make a phone call, as a newcomer resigning doesn’t need to be so troublesome, and for the new company over there, I’ve already contacted them for you, you can start work tomorrow." 
With just a simple sentence, this man, whose complexion hadn’t changed a bit, made the decision for her. 
Ye Ning’s mouth gaped open slightly... 
Start the new job tomorrow? 
That quick! 
She stood there, looking at him, and for a moment, she didn’t know what to say. 
If she remembered correctly, she recalled that when she first went to the Ou Corporation, he had also said that it was the fastest and most effective method to topple the second branch of the Ou family, because only Ou Mucen had that kind of strength. 
But now, he was so eager to have her leave Ou Corporation, leave Ou Mucen, and go to the new company he had arranged for her. Was this really for the sake of allowing her to take revenge more effectively? 
After he left, Ye Ning sat beside her son’s bed for a long, long time, her mind in turmoil. 
Until the small child on the sickbed woke up, saw his mother sitting by the bed, and reached out his chubby little hand, grabbing his mother’s arm: "Mommy, don’t be angry, Uncle Lin is just thinking of your best interests." 
Ye Ning turned her head and saw that he was awake, and bent down happily: "Baby, you’re awake? Mommy’s not angry, how could Mommy be angry?" 
Ye Xiaobao pursed his lips, crawled out of bed: "Really not angry? I saw Mommy’s face could hang two buckets of water." 
"Is that so? You saw?" 
"Of course I did, but if it were me, I’d be angry too, Mommy isn’t Xiaobao, you’re an adult, you don’t need others to arrange everything for you, right?" noveldrama
The child, merely four years old, had such a clear understanding, sitting beside his mother with his large, shiny black eyes that seemed like a vast ocean, exceptionally beautiful. 
Ye Ning looked into those eyes and for some reason, another pair came to her mind, larger but just as deep and profound, and she paused for a moment. 
What the hell! 
Why did she think of that bastard’s eyes? 
She broke out in a cold sweat and dared not look at her own son anymore; she got up and went to the bathroom: "Baby, what do you want to eat tonight? Mommy will go buy it for you." 
Ye Xiaobao climbed down from the bed, saw his mother’s bag there, and fiddled with the car keys beside it: "Mommy, were you with Uncle Bingkuai today?" 
What does ’being together’ mean? 
In the bathroom, having just splashed her face with cold water, Ye Ning immediately felt awkward at her son’s words: "Mommy was at work. When you’re at work, of course, you’ll see him." 
"No wonder Uncle Lin kept looking at his phone in the ward today."
"What?" 
"Mommy, why don’t you just not work at Uncle Bingkuai’s place? Otherwise, Uncle Lin might really get angry." The last part came with a particularly serious tone from the little child. 
Ye Ning came out of the bathroom, saw Little Baozi’s wrinkled little face, and couldn’t help but chuckle: "You also think we shouldn’t make Uncle Lin angry?" 
Ye Xiaobao nodded: "Yeah, but, if you resign, won’t Uncle Bingkuai get angry?" 
Uncle Bingkuai? 
Ye Ning thought of the man who seemed to find her displeasing no matter what, and shook her head decisively: "No, Mommy’s not a pivotal figure, how could he get angry?"
###Chapter 184: Chapter 184: He Started Investigating Her!
"But didn’t he carry you that day?" 
"What?" 
"That day, you know, when we were at his house, Mom, you hurt your foot, and he carried you out. Ye Dabao, I’m telling you, I’ve been so bored these past few days, I’ve read a lot of his news. It says that he’s a man with serious mysophobia. And, you know, I’ve been looking for so long, I haven’t found any photos of him carrying other women..." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Suddenly, she felt her face heat up as she knocked her son on the head with a flick: "What are you babbling about? You’re too young to ignore your kindergarten books, why are you reading this? Come on, let’s go eat." 
Having said that, she stopped wasting words on the little brat, took his hand, and they went downstairs to eat together. 
What kind of son is this... 
---- 
At this moment, in the Ou Corporation building, Ou Mucen, who had rushed back to the company to attend two meetings in a row, had finally returned to his office. 
Secretary Gao followed close behind. He had been in such a hurry earlier that he hadn’t had the chance to ask, but now that there was a moment of respite, he hurried over to look at the hand wrapped with thick bandages: "Third Young Master, are you alright? I heard from the factory people at noon that you injured your hand, is it serious?" 
Ou Mucen glanced at his hand and shook his head: "It’s nothing!" 
"That’s good to hear. Which hospital did you go to for the dressing? I called Dr. Ji, and he said he didn’t see you there." 
Dr. Ji? 
Ji Chengzhi? 
The man who had just sat down behind his office desk, upon hearing this name, his expression immediately turned grim: "You told him I hurt my hand?" 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
This...
Can he say he didn’t? 
Ahem, ahem, ahem! noveldrama
Secretary Gao stood there, wrestling with what to say for a long time, before carefully squeezing out a sentence: "Well, Third Young Master, Dr. Ji probably won’t talk too much." 
Ji Chengzhi won’t talk too much? 
Unless pigs could climb trees! 
Ou Mucen reached out and threw the cigarette box he had just picked up onto the table. He was about to command this bumbling fool to get out immediately, but suddenly, he thought of the hospital and a matter sprang to mind. 
"Right, I asked you to check on that woman’s background, did you find anything?" 
"That woman?" 
Secretary Gao did not react right away. 
It wasn’t until his boss’s gaze pierced him like an icy blade that he came to his senses: "Oh, you mean An Ning, I looked into it. The address on her ID card is indeed real, however, what’s strange is that it seems she only came to A City a few months ago." 
"A few months?" 
"Yes, she appeared in A City about four months ago, and as per your instructions, I also checked on Lin Yebai, and found that he has indeed been living in A City for the past few years, without any apprentices around." 
Lin Yebai has been living in A City all this time? 
The man sitting behind the desk remembered what the woman had said during the interview, sitting right in front of him. 
She mentioned that because her child was getting older and had to attend kindergarten, leading to more expenses, she had no choice but to leave her master. That means, before her child started kindergarten, she had actually been with her master all along. 
Then why was there no sign of her around Lin Yebai, who was in A City? 
He thought of how she inadvertently revealed her considerable understanding of his situation twice at the hospital at noon. 
At last, a chilling glint flashed through his deep, inscrutable eyes: "Send someone to check the address on her ID card, and remember, don’t get discovered."
###Chapter 185: Chapter 185: Third Young Master, This is the Resignation Letter from An Ning
Secretary Gao nodded hurriedly, "Okay!" 
Actually, Secretary Gao didn’t quite understand why the president had been suspecting that woman all along? 
Even though she knew about jade and those incredible appraisal techniques, ever since she appeared, she had stood with Yuzhirun against the second house of the Ou Family in the jewelry store. This indicated that she was already their enemy. So why still doubt her? Investigate her? 
Lin Yebai, he had no grudges against the Ou Corporation either! 
When Secretary Gao left, he was truly puzzled. 
What he hadn’t expected was that just as he’d arranged for someone to investigate that woman, the security guard downstairs suddenly brought up a set of keys and an envelope, "Secretary Gao, this is what Assistant An gave me downstairs just now, she asked me to hand it over to the president." 
Assistant An? 
That woman? 
Secretary Gao was startled by the items that the security guard handed over. 
He recognized the car keys, indeed they were to Yebai’s black Bentley. This morning the two had gone to the factory together, later heading to the airport. Upon returning, Yebai came back alone, while she had taken that guest back to the hotel, and thus the car remained with her. 
But what about this envelope? 
He took it, opened it and saw... 
Damn! 
A resignation letter!! 
Secretary Gao was stunned. He stared at the envelope for several seconds, unable to recover. 
What the hell? He had just arranged for someone to check up on her, and now she was suddenly submitting her resignation. Did she have ears that could catch the wind? Could she hear him speaking? 
Secretary Gao found the situation too horrifying, so he grabbed the resignation letter and the set of keys and hurried back to the president’s office, "Yebai, something’s wrong, An Ning wants to resign." 
"..." 
The man in the office was already working on his laptop, replying through voice recognition due to inconvenience with his hands. Suddenly seeing someone enter without knocking, his handsome face immediately darkened. 
"Don’t you know how to knock? What’s the panic about?" 
Secretary Gao hurriedly explained, "No, Yebai, I just received the car keys and this from An Ning downstairs. She had the security guard bring them up." 
Having said that, he hastily handed over the items he was holding. noveldrama
Ou Mucen looked at him angrily for a while before taking the items from his hand. 
A resignation letter? 
His gaze fell on the flamboyant handwritten characters on the snow-white envelope, and, just as Secretary Gao had guessed, his pupils shrunk. 
See, he was surprised too; he found it unbelievable as well, didn’t he? 
Secretary Gao observed the BOSS’s reaction, and seeing that he remained silent after receiving the letter, he hurriedly said, "Yebai, we were just talking about investigating her, and immediately she sends over her resignation letter. Do you think she has..." 
"Eyes in the back of her head?" 
"..." 
After a long moment, Secretary Gao somewhat embarrassedly scratched his own head, "Of course she doesn’t have eyes in the back, but I was thinking, what if she installed some kind of listening device in your office?" 
A listening device? 
Ou Mucen’s veins throbbed, and suddenly, he threw the letter at him, "A listening device? Do you think this is a movie? A listening device? Why don’t you just say she’s not human?" 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
Not human? Then what was she? 
Secretary Gao’s face stung from being hit by the envelope, but he didn’t dare to dodge. He waited until the BOSS across from him had calmed down a bit before daring to pick up the letter again, "Then Yebai, what about this letter..."
###Chapter 186: Chapter 186: She Really Thinks He Can’t Deal With Her?
"Throw it away!" 
"..." 
Huh? 
Throw it away? 
Secretary Gao was a bit slow to react... 
What did ’throw it away’ mean? Did he not want her to resign? Or did he not take her seriously at all? Did her resignation have nothing to do with him whatsoever? 
Secretary Gao couldn’t quite grasp the meaning behind the BOSS’s words, but if he knew that this BOSS had already discussed the matter of the letter with its owner while on a business trip to B City, he would have understood. 
The meaning of "throwing it away" was actually— 
Resignation? 
Sure, but she didn’t call the shots! 
That damned woman, daring to deliver the letter to his office. Did she really think he couldn’t handle her? 
—— 
Ye Ning stayed in the hospital that night, which was also Xiaobao’s last night in the hospital. 
When she woke up, it was already bright outside. She got up from the bed, planning to freshen up before going to the dean’s office to ask what time the check-up would finish. Then, when could she be discharged? 
But as soon as she had sorted herself out, Lin Yebai arrived in the corridor with Qiao Feiyu... 
"Uncle Lin, Aunt Xiaoqiao..." 
"Xiaobao, how are you feeling today? Does your head still hurt?" 
Ye Xiaobao, who had just woken up from his sleep, sat up excitedly on the bed when he saw Uncle Lin and Xiaoqiao. 
Seeing this, Lin Yebai came over, patted his little head, signaled Feiyu to take him to brush his teeth and wash his face, and then he placed the breakfast he brought on the table: "Aning, I’ll take you to that company. It’s all set, Xiaoyu will be here to handle things." 
Ye Ning was taken aback for a moment, "So early? And what about Xiaobao? He’s getting discharged today." 
"No worries, here the discharges are generally arranged for the afternoon, plus Xiaoyu is here, so you don’t have to be concerned," Lin Yebai said as he started to pack her bag. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning felt helpless and could only go to the bathroom to reapply a light makeup before following him out the door. 
Coming down from the hospital, she saw the white Audi parked at the entrance and, after thinking for a bit, she asked, "Is the company far, Big Brother Lin?" 
Lin Yebai looked back at her and replied, "Not very far. Don’t worry, this car will be yours to drive in the future. The round trip will take about half an hour or so; it’s very convenient." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
He was really good to her, even better than she took care of herself. 
Ye Ning opened the car door and got in. She saw the city that had just been awakened by the morning glow, with golden sunlight slowly spreading over it. 
The sun happened to fall on the tallest skyscraper in the city, so as she looked over, she saw several huge red characters on the building’s tempered glass walls, shining brilliantly in the dazzling golden light. It was as if they were proclaiming to the city the presence of a sovereign ruler. noveldrama
Oushi Empire! 
She carefully chewed over these words, thinking about the letter she had sent to the building via the security guards the evening before. Suddenly, she felt a stir in her heart, and she bowed her head to rummage through her bag. 
Driving in front, Lin Yebai saw this in the rearview mirror and asked, "What’s the matter? What are you looking for?" 
Ye Ning frowned, "I can’t seem to find my phone. I was charging it last night and didn’t put it in the bag. When you helped me pack earlier, did you put it in there for me?"
###Chapter 187: Chapter 187: Has Assistant An Been Fired?
Cell phone? 
Lin Yebai thought for a moment, realizing he hadn’t indeed taken it, and couldn’t help feeling somewhat apologetic, "It seems not, I’m sorry. Do you need to go back and get it? If so, I’ll turn around and we can head back." 
Go back? 
Ye Ning glanced at the car nearly out of the city center and frowned, "Forget it, didn’t you say it’s not far? Let’s hurry over. After the interview, we can come back. Xiaobao is still waiting to be discharged from the hospital." 
"Alright!" 
Seeing her response, Lin Yebai didn’t turn around. Instead, he continued driving towards the company he had mentioned. 
-- 
Meanwhile, in the building they had just driven past, a new day had begun, with Yuzhirun employees arriving one after another at the entrance. 
"Xiaochen, good morning!" 
"Good morning, Qianqian..." 
"Did you hear that our company, Yuzhirun, has recruited a famous designer from abroad?" 
"Yes, An Ning went to pick them up yesterday, and they should be coming to the office today." 
Early in the morning, as Xiaochen arrived at the office, she ran into her colleague Qianqian, who was particularly keen on gossip and asked her about the rumor from yesterday. 
Yuzhirun’s hire of a branded designer wasn’t a secret anymore, so Xiaochen had no intention of hiding it. 
However, what she didn’t expect was that as soon as she spoke, her colleague’s face turned somewhat ugly, "Why is it An Ning again? Don’t we have anyone else in this office?" 
Xiaochen: "..." 
Just then, another colleague came up from behind. Seeing the two of them, the colleague approached with an air of secrecy, "Let me tell you a secret." 
"What secret?" 
"An Ning, she’s been fired by the company!!" 
What? 
As soon as this was said, Xiaochen and Qianqian in front were both shocked. 
Fired?
Why? When did this happen? Why didn’t they know about it? 
Didn’t she just come to work here yesterday? 
Xiaochen was skeptical about this news, glared at her colleague, and blurted out, "Stop talking nonsense here, how could An Ning be fired? I haven’t received any notice at the front desk." noveldrama
"That’s because you haven’t received it yet. Let me tell you, it’s all over the company now. They say that yesterday, when she went to pick up a client, she offended the Chen Family’s second young lady, a close friend of the third young master, so she was fired today." 
The colleague even spoke with confidence and detail! 
Finally feeling a bit panicked, Xiaochen hurriedly turned around and without paying any more attention to them, she went straight into the elevator and up to the 15th floor. 
Once there, Secretary Gao had already arrived, so she immediately asked, "Secretary Gao, they are saying that An Ning has been fired, is that true?" 
Fired? 
Secretary Gao, who was preparing the documents for the president’s upcoming meeting, looked up at her with displeasure, "Who’s been spreading such nonsense to you?" 
Xiaochen quickly explained, "It’s Qianqian and the others. They even said it was because when she picked up the designer yesterday, she offended the Chen Family’s second young lady, and then the third young master fired her!" 
What a mess? 
Secretary Gao glared at her harshly, "Nonsense, get on with your work. She’ll be here for her shift soon." 
After saying that, he took the stack of documents and headed to the conference room! 
Seeing his reaction, although Xiaochen thought his attitude was unpleasant, she still felt a sense of relief and then went on with her work. 
An Ning, she really didn’t want her to be fired. That girl, she was quite nice.
###Chapter 188: Chapter 188: Are you looking for my mom? She’s not here!
But what she didn’t know was that just as she returned to the front desk, Secretary Gao, who had left before her, hurriedly checked his phone after reaching the meeting room. 
What’s going on? 
Why hasn’t a single WeChat message I sent this morning been replied to? Could it be that the confidential documents he sent weren’t frightening enough to that woman? Just leaking one of those documents could lead to criminal charges! noveldrama
Secretary Gao flipped through his phone, looking at the photos he’d taken of those top-secret Yuzhirun documents, feeling quite depressed. 
Could it be... this material still isn’t enough to scare her? 
After some thought, he went back to the office, took pictures of the company’s latest product cost sheet, and sent it out, "An Ning, sorry, this report was also discovered to have been leaked!"
After sending it, he wiped the cold sweat from his forehead! 
Third Master, I’ve really done my best... 
Half an hour later, Ou Mucen finally arrived at the company. Secretary Gao wanted to talk to him about this matter, but after Ou saw the sample of the new carving knife that had been produced yesterday, he plunged into the meeting room. Secretary Gao temporarily put the matter aside. 
It was not until two hours later, after the meeting finally ended, that Secretary Gao followed Mucen out of the meeting room. Seeing there was still no reply on WeChat, he cautiously approached, "Third Master, An Ning... seems to have remained silent." 
"What?" 
Ou Mucen hadn’t yet disengaged from his preoccupations; without lifting his head upon hearing this, he responded. 
Out of options, Secretary Gao handed over his phone, "Didn’t you say yesterday, An Ning, to let me tell her what the consequences would be for a CEO’s assistant who signed a confidentiality agreement and left without permission?" 
"And then?" 
"Then I sent her those Yuzhirun confidential files. But she completely ignored me." Secretary Gao felt somewhat wronged. 
Ou Mucen, recalling the situation, finally realized! 
So, that woman really didn’t come in today? 
His gaze suddenly turned dark. He took Secretary Gao’s phone, flipped through it, and upon seeing the things he had sent on WeChat, his forehead veins bulged with anger, "Are you an idiot? Why did you send these things to her?" 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
Did... did I send the wrong thing? 
Then how was he supposed to let her know the consequences if not by sending this? What else should he have sent? 
Secretary Gao felt like crying! 
"Third Master..." 
"Get her on the phone; I’ll talk to her!" 
Ou Mucen was in a particularly foul mood. 
Useless, unable to handle such a simple task, what else could he do? 
Feeling the killing intent, Secretary Gao quickly grabbed his phone, found the number, and dialed. 
It really wasn’t his fault. How was he to know what he meant? With just a phrase like "let her know the consequences of someone with knowledge of top secrets resigning privately," he went all out. How was he to know what Mucen intended? 
Secretary Gao’s heart was almost tortured to death! 
Luckily, the call connected after a short while, and someone picked up. Secretary Gao exploded like a firecracker, "An Ning, what on earth is going on with you? You disappear after dropping a resignation letter, don’t respond to WeChat, have your wings grown strong, you think you can fly away now?" 
"..." 
After being shouted at like this, the phone was silent for a long time. 
Secretary Gao felt triumphant! 
See, he needed to yell at that damn woman; make her listen. 
But before his satisfaction lasted three seconds, a milky, soft voice came from the other end, "Are you looking for my mommy? My mommy isn’t here."
###Chapter 189: Chapter 189: Uncle Bingshan, Won’t You Come to See Me?
Uncle? Mom?!! 
Secretary Gao was stunned. 
Holy shit! 
This is... this is... 
Ou Mucen had been sitting there, and when he saw him all of a sudden go dumb, not speaking, his expression also became very weird. Out of impatience, he stretched out his hand and took his phone: "Hello?" 
"My mom forgot to bring her phone today, are you trying to reach her?" 
"..." 
It’s actually a child? 
When Ou Mucen heard the childlike voice on the phone, he was also stunned in shock. 
Mom? 
Is that Little Baozi? 
He recalled the little boy he had met twice before and finally reacted: "Are you Xiaobao?" 
Ye Xiaobao, on the other end of the line, also found the voice very familiar, and upon being asked if it was him, he immediately nodded his little head while holding the phone: "Yeah, I’m Xiaobao, who is this? Uncle Bingshan?" 
Uncle Bingshan? 
Ou Mucen’s brow twisted at this new nickname: "Mm, where’s your mom?" 
"My mom went for a job interview!" 
"Job interview?" 
"Yeah, my mom said it’s inconvenient to work at your company, so Uncle Lin found her another job, and she left early this morning. She forgot her phone when she left." 
This kid was really straightforward; if he wanted to know where his mom went, he told everything he knew without hesitation. 
But whether he spoke the truth or lies, who the hell knows! 
So there stood Secretary Gao, watching as the boss’s handsome face gradually grew grimmer until finally, as if a storm was about to break, the atmosphere in the entire office dropped, and he shivered... 
Crap, that murderous vibe is way too strong; what on earth did that damn kid say to him? 
Secretary Gao began thinking of making a getaway! 
"Did your mom mention which company she went to interview with?" 
Ye Xiaobao shook his head: "I don’t know that, Uncle, I’m just a kid; how would I know about that? By the way, Uncle, won’t you come to see me? I’m supposed to be discharged from the hospital today. Given our relationship, won’t you come and see me?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Sitting there, stiff for a long time, he finally threw out a sentence: "Okay, I’ll come to see you. What do you want to eat?" 
"Then would you buy me some bread? Mom and Uncle Lin haven’t come back yet, and Aunt Xiaoqiao has gone to class. I don’t know when they’ll be back to catch lunchtime?" 
A four-year-old child, speaking on the phone, still with his sweet and soft baby voice uttering every word, showed no blame, no grievance, as if being left alone was the most normal thing in the world. 
But as Ou Mucen sat there, for some reason, he suddenly felt an anger rising from deep within, accompanied by a sharp pang of heartache. He hung up the phone with a "slam" and said nothing more, immediately standing up from his chair. 
"Third Master..." 
"I’m stepping out for a bit, push all appointments to the afternoon!" 
He left the office with a cold face, giving no explanations to the secretary standing before him, then grabbing his car keys and suit jacket as he headed out the door. 
Secretary Gao was left standing in the office, for a long time, unable to react. 
What is the president up to? noveldrama
---- 
Twenty minutes later, in the VIP ward of City No. 1 People’s Hospital, Ye Xiaobao, who was bored sitting in front of the window dismantling his fighter jet model, finally heard the sound of the door being pushed open. 
Who’s that coming? 
His face brightened as he looked back, thinking it could be his mom or Uncle Lin, or maybe Aunt Xiaoqiao, who promised she’d come over after her class.
###Chapter 190: Chapter 190: Uncle, why are you so unlikeable?
But, he didn’t expect to see another very tall figure, "Uncle Bingshan, you really came?" 
Ye Xiaobao was a bit incredulous, climbing up from the floor. His pair of jet-black, shiny eyes were filled with surprise. 
He was actually just joking before. Uncle Bingshan had such a bad temper and was always so impatient with him, how could he have expected him to really come back? 
But, as a child, he soon replaced his initial shock with excitement upon seeing the cool uncle standing there holding a big cake. Instantly, he ran over. 
"Uncle, did you buy me something delicious?" 
Ou Mucen had been sizing up the hospital room and realized that, since his arrival, there wasn’t a single adult present besides this little guy. His handsome face had already turned to ice. 
"So, not a single one of them is here?" 
"They’re not, I’m not lying to you!" 
Little Baozi saw the cake in his hand. Feeling a bit hungry, he reached out his little hand towards it. 
But what about Ou Mucen? 
Seeing the barefooted Little Baozi who had run up to him, his eyes turned icy. Without a second thought, he picked him up and tossed him back onto the bed, "Who allowed you to get out of bed?" 
Little Baozi felt wronged, "Uncle, I’m already better, I was supposed to be discharged from the hospital today." 
Discharged? 
He hadn’t reacted until he heard that. Upon hearing it, the expression of Uncle Bingshan standing before his bed soured even more, "So, your mom doesn’t care about your discharge? She’s still out with some other man?" 
What kind of talk was this? 
Why did Uncle’s words sound so unpleasant? 
Ye Xiaobao was somewhat displeased, "Uncle, my mom hasn’t neglected me. Didn’t I tell you? My mom will be back soon." 
"How soon is ’soon’? One hour? Two hours? Tell me, how many hours have you been waiting for her?" 
Ou Mucen really didn’t seem to have any intention of being accommodating, as if at that moment, he had forgotten that this was a four-year-old child, treating him as if he were an adult. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Xiaobao fell silent, his brows furrowing into a "川" character—just like Uncle’s. 
No wonder Mom didn’t like him. It turns out he wasn’t cute at all! 
"Uncle, has anyone told you? You’re really unlikable?" 
"What did you say?" 
"My mom, well, I didn’t understand why she didn’t want to work at your company anymore. But now that I’ve heard you speak, I get it. Uncle, you really don’t know how to make people like you!" 
"..." 
Standing there, Ou Mucen stared at Little Baozi for a long time, finally, with a somber expression, he asked another question, "The company your mom is interviewing with today, did she find it herself?" 
Ye Xiaobao shook his head, "Not exactly. Uncle Lin helped find it, but it seemed like Mom didn’t really want to go." noveldrama
"..." 
Ye Xiaobao, once again sold out his own mom... 
Not very willing to go? 
Ou Mucen glanced over the round chubby face, his expression finally softening a bit, "Why?" 
Ye Xiaobao glanced at him disdainfully, "Isn’t it obvious? Here, your company is the biggest, and the salary is the highest. My mom would be silly to give up a good place for a worse one." 
Ou Mucen choked! 
Is this really a child? Why did he feel that the way he spoke and his intelligence simply crushed his unbearably stupid mother?
###Chapter 191: Chapter 191: They look like father and son no matter how you look at them!
"If that’s the case, then why does your mom still want to work at that crappy company?" 
"Isn’t that because of you? Uncle, I’ve told you many times, don’t always bully my mom. You make her so upset she doesn’t even want to see you anymore. Who’s going to work for you then? Women need to be coaxed. If you keep this up, it’ll hurt me too!" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
What kind of child is this? 
After a while, with a darkened face, he withdrew his gaze from the little rascal: "Alright, I’m leaving now. You stay here and behave, wait for your mom and the others to come back." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Xiaobao immediately felt a bit disappointed: "Uncle, you’re leaving just like that?" 
Ou Mucen nodded: "Yeah, I’m very busy. But don’t worry, when I have time, I’ll come to see you again." 
Maybe it was because he saw the disappointment on that little face, but for the first time, this man, who had never comforted anyone, felt a softness in his heart. 
Ye Xiaobao pouted, still not very happy, but in the end, he watched as the uncle walked towards the door of the ward, his large eyes quietly following the retreating figure. 
As Ou Mucen walked away, he heard the ward suddenly quiet down behind him, and he could feel those two eyes still following him, tugging at something inside him. For some reason, he found it suddenly hard to take the next step. 
"When exactly is your mom coming back?" 
"I don’t know!" 
"Then do you want to go eat with me?" 
The child sitting on the bed, who had been looking eagerly at him, suddenly lit up at the words: "Really? Yeah, yeah, I want to go eat with Uncle." 
Before he even finished speaking, his short little arms and legs had already scurried off the bed. 
Ou Mucen saw this and stood at the door waiting for him. He watched as the child skillfully changed out of his hospital gown, put on his little shoes, and then rushed over to affectionately take hold of his large hand: "Uncle, I’m ready, let’s go together." 
Ye Xiaobao was indeed a very self-sufficient child, far stronger in this respect than a certain someone. 
Ou Mucen, expressionless, felt the chubby little hand take his own and simply walked out the door with him. 
Ye Xiaobao was so happy, his entire little face bloomed with joy... 
Those reports that said Uncle Bingshan had a severe case of germophobia and couldn’t be touched or spoken to directly, and even needed people to breathe three meters away from him, didn’t seem true. Look at how the little hand was holding his and he showed no reaction at all. 
Ye Xiaobao was over the moon! 
After leaving the ward and reaching the nurses’ station, Ou Mucen, worried that Ye Ning might come back and not find her child, went over to give them a heads-up. 
"Third Young Master..." 
"If the child’s family comes by, tell them he went to eat with me." 
"Alright, Third Young Master!" 
The nurses at the VIP ward area knew the hospital director’s good friend, so they agreed immediately upon hearing what he said. 
After giving notice, Ou Mucen left with the little baozi in tow... 
"What do you feel like eating?" 
"What does Uncle want to eat?" noveldrama
"I’m not picky!" 
"Then I’ll be not picky too!" 
"..." 
This truly was an eye-catching sight, a tall and stunningly handsome young man, hand in hand with an equally charming little baozi. Even though their facial features were not much alike, the resemblance in their demeanor and the look in their eyes made them seem like father and son, no matter the angle one looked from!
###Chapter 192: Chapter 192: When Necessary, It’s Still Best to Call for Dad!
A pair of father and son so perfect it’s enough to drive anyone crazy with envy! 
The people who followed them downstairs were dazzled, sneakily taking out their phones to snap pictures. They began to discuss, "Oh my gosh, look at that dad and BABY, they’re both so handsome and gorgeous." 
"Yeah, how can there be such good genes in this world?" 
"And who knows what kind of woman? What stroke of luck to have such a charming husband and such a handsome and adorable son." 
"It’s really defying the heavens!" 
"..." 
As they walked, the gazes that gathered around them never stopped. 
Ou Mucen was fine with it, used to being the center of attention. But Xiaobao, whom he held by the hand, was not accustomed to such a scene. Seeing all these people looking over at him and taking photos with their phones, he lifted his little head to look up at Uncle Bingshan, "Uncle, aren’t you going to explain to them?" 
"Explain what?" 
"Explain that I’m not your son. Otherwise, if we appear on the news, it could affect your marriage prospects." 
"..." 
Marriage prospects? 
Where on earth did he learn all this nonsense? 
Ou Mucen’s eyes twitched fiercely for a while before he finally looked down at Little Baozi who wasn’t even as tall as his own legs, "Is this what your mom teaches you at home?"noveldrama
Ye Xiaobao was taken aback, "No, why would you say that, Uncle?" 
"Then why else would a four-year-old kid know about these things? Shouldn’t a little brat like you be watching cartoons or something?" 
As if you watch cartoons! 
Childish! 
The miffed Little Baozi being led by the hand puffed up his cheeks in displeasure, "Uncle, even though I’m only four years old, don’t treat me like a child, okay? I am a man, and a man is supposed to protect women. What’s the use of watching cartoons all the time?" 
Ou Mucen choked! 
He had never anticipated that a man who was invincible in the business world could be so utterly speechless by a four-year-old Little Baozi, to the point where he couldn’t get a single word out. If this got out, truly, no one would believe it. 
In the end, Ou Mucen ended up carrying the troublesome kid out. He really couldn’t stand his chatter for another second. 
Once he put him in the car, he didn’t even ask what the kid wanted to eat. He just drove straight to a nearby Western restaurant. 
Kids should like Western food, right? 
He remembered his little nephew from his aunt’s side, who always insisted on eating pizza whenever he came to Blue Mountain Villa. 
At the Western restaurant, the waitstaff, believing they were father and son, kindly arranged a comfortable spot for them, "Sir, does your baby need a high chair brought over?" 
Baby? 
Ou Mucen glanced at Little Baozi, who was seated by him, and with a bit of awkwardness, finally explained, "He’s not my child." 
"How can he not be? Daddy, how can you say that? Are you not wanting me as your son just because I didn’t listen?" 
Unexpectedly, after his explanation, the little brat that he had seated in the chair immediately started calling him daddy, and even put on an extremely hurt expression. 
Ou Mucen’s hand holding the menu stiffened, and his eyes narrowed, glaring at the little rascal. 
But the little rascal? 
After the waitress who took their order walked away, Xiaobao waved his plump little arm towards his back, "Uncle, look, they have a special today, the family set meal is discounted. If I call you daddy, you can save a lot of money."
###Chapter 193: Chapter 193 Ye Xiaobao is a Genius
By the end of his speech, those bright and watery black eyes didn’t forget to give him a vigorous blink, the meaning quite simple... 
Praise me! Admire me! Worship me! 
In this world, there was simply no other genius like Ye Xiaobao! 
Ou Mucen really was... 
Feeling the urge to give him a thrashing! 
Was he short on cash? Did he need this discount? He was the third young master of the Ou Family, a proud holder of 50% of the Empire’s shares; would he be lacking this? 
But in the end, not only did he tacitly approve of his actions, he also rarely offered a word of praise after putting down the menu, "Mm, you’re really clever." 
Ye Xiaobao smiled, "Of course, I’m born by my mother!" 
Your mom? 
Mucen was choked up again... 
Don’t even mention your mom; among all the women in the world he had met, she was the only one that was the most foolish. 
Once the orders were taken, the waiter went off to prepare, and seeing this, Ou Mucen took out his phone and busied himself with his own affairs. 
His visit to see the boy had been a sudden decision and when he arrived at the hospital ward, he hadn’t planned on taking him out for a meal. It was only after seeing the child alone in the ward, looking so pitiful, that he took him out. 
Therefore, now that he had some downtime, of course, he had to deal with work matters. 
"Secretary Gao, how’s the meeting at noon?"
"It’s all arranged; they’re waiting for you in the conference room right now. When will you be back, Young Master Mucen?" 
"Something came up, cancel it!" 
His long and beautiful fingers rapidly typed a few characters on his phone screen, and the person on the other side immediately began sweating profusely. 
Cancel? noveldrama
Why didn’t you say that earlier? 
Secretary Gao glanced at the people who had been waiting in the conference room and replied helplessly, "Alright, then Young Master Mucen, what about the client you have an appointment with later?" 
The client? 
Ou Mucen, sitting there, his gaze shifted slightly, "Which client?" 
Secretary Gao quickly replied, "It’s the European agent who previously mentioned wanting to check out Yuzhirun’s new product. Didn’t you already agree to meet with them personally?" 
The European agent... 
The man sitting in the dining chair finally remembered the matter and immediately looked at the child across from him, who had started eating, and found himself in a dilemma. 
The European agent was the first step in Yuzhirun’s expansion into the international market; of course, he needed to meet them. But what about this child? If he waited for him to finish eating and then took him back to the hospital, it would likely be too late. 
He thought of the appointed time and glanced at the watch on his wrist, finally asking, "Xiaobao, has your mother returned yet?" 
Mother? 
Ye Xiaobao, who was stuffing his face with pizza, looked up at the uncle, "I don’t know. My mom didn’t bring her phone today; I don’t know if she’s back." 
As the words fell, Ou Mucen frowned. 
Indeed, he had forgotten that foolish woman didn’t have her phone with her. 
Should he call that Mr. Lin to come and pick up the child? 
Ou Mucen thought about the man he had met once and suddenly, he didn’t know why, but he dismissed the idea. It was as if he was very reluctant to let that man take the child. 
If that was the case... 
His slender, clean fingers tapped lightly on the dining table twice, and after a moment, he spoke, "Little Baozi, Uncle has a bit of an urgent matter. After you finish eating, come with Uncle to take care of the business, and then Uncle will take you back to the hospital, how’s that?" 
Could he continue to accompany him? 
Little Baozi, who was eating pizza, blinked his large eyes and without a moment’s hesitation, nodded in agreement, "Okay, should I eat faster then?"
###Chapter 194: Chapter 194: Has Something Happened to Xiaobao?
"Hmm!" 
Ou Mucen, seeing that he had agreed, also breathed a sigh of relief. He picked up his phone and replied, telling Secretary Gao to make the arrangements, and then asked the waiter to come over for the check. 
"Uncle, there’s still so much left. Can we pack it up and take it home?" 
"No!" 
Ou Mucen’s response was crisp and decisive! 
Packing up the leftovers? 
When had he, the Crown Prince of the Ou Corporation, ever done such a thing? 
But Little Baozi, seeing that he was unwilling, became insistent and refused to leave: "But it’s such a waste, Uncle. You didn’t eat any of it. I’ll pack it up, and if you get hungry later, you can eat it on the road. Look, you haven’t eaten anything." 
Ye Xiaobao tried hard to persuade this spendthrift uncle who didn’t take wasting food seriously. 
Really, why are rich people like this? They have no concept of thrift and frugality at all. These pizzas—Ye Dabao would not let him eat them often for fear of him getting a sore throat. If he could pack them and take them home, wouldn’t he be able to have a good meal again at night? 
Ye Xiaobao was determined not to leave without packing up the pizzas. 
Ou Mucen’s forehead throbbed with visible veins. In the end, he reluctantly agreed to his nephew’s wishes. 
"Sir, actually, it’s a very good habit for your child to do this. It’s better not to waste things." 
"..." 
Ou Mucen felt like exploding! 
After finally packing everything up, the two of them, one big and one small, left the restaurant just as Secretary Gao’s call came through, informing him that the European agent was already waiting at Bishui Pavilion in Qianshui Bay. 
Qianshui Bay? 
Why go to Qianshui Bay? 
Upon hearing that it was the place next to his own home, Ou Mucen was displeased: "Who made this arrangement? Why choose that place?" 
Secretary Gao hastily explained: "It was the guest who made the reservation himself. He said he just arrived in A City and booked the hotel online. It was this place—I couldn’t help it." 
Ou Mucen frowned and eventually said nothing more. 
Leading the child to the car, he fastened his seatbelt securely: "When we get to the hotel, don’t wander around. Uncle will be finished in a moment." 
"Okay, Uncle, don’t worry, Xiaobao will be very good!" Ye Xiaobao smiled sweetly at him. 
Of course, he would be good; he didn’t want to stay in that boring hospital ward. Now that he had this uncle, he would be obedient, no matter what he was asked to do. 
Ye Xiaobao happily leaned against the backseat of the car. 
But as the scenery outside gradually left the city center further and further behind, he suddenly began to think of his mother and worry. 
"Uncle, can I call my mom?" 
Ou Mucen was steering the wheel and glanced in the rearview mirror upon hearing the request: "Do you want her to come pick you up?" 
Ye Xiaobao shook his head: "No, my mom forgot her phone. But it’s been so long, and she hasn’t called me. I’m a little worried about her." 
Worried? 
Such a little child, how could he be worried about her? 
Ou Mucen wanted to say this, but as he straightened the car and looked into the rearview mirror again, seeing that child’s face, still childish but full of a concern inappropriate for his age, he frowned and pulled out his own phone: "Hmm, tell me the number." 
Ye Xiaobao’s eyes lit up instantly as he quickly rattled off Uncle Lin’s number, his gaze fixed on the phone in his uncle’s hand. noveldrama
As the call went through and was swiftly answered on the other end, Ou Mucen passed the phone to him... 
"Hello, who is this?" 
"Uncle Lin, it’s Xiaobao. Where are you all now? When will you come back?" 
Xiaobao? 
Lin Yebai, still in that factory, was surprised to hear the voice and took a moment to check the phone again. 
Heavens! 
A strange number!!
###Chapter 195: Chapter 195: Mom, Uncle Bingshan Invited Me to Dinner
It was a strange number. Could something have happened? 
Lin Yebai’s complexion changed instantly as he picked up his phone and asked right away, "Xiaobao? Whose phone are you using? Where are you?" 
Ye Xiaobao, upon hearing this, didn’t answer his question. Instead, she asked, "Uncle Lin, when will you and Mom come back? Are you still at that company?" 
Lin Yebai nodded, "Yes, when your mother came for the job interview today, she just happened to meet a client bringing new merchandise, so I asked your mom to take a closer look. Xiaobao, where exactly are you? Why are you using someone else’s phone to call Uncle? Where’s your mom’s phone?" 
"Uncle Lin, Aunt Xiaoqiao went to teach a class, and I was so hungry. Uncle Bingshan came to see me, so I asked him to take me out to eat," Xiaobao said. 
"..." 
Uncle Bingshan? 
Who is Uncle Bingshan?
Lin Yebai had never heard the child mention this person before. The last time there was trouble at Blue Mountain Villa, he came back and asked the child about it, and the child pointed at the news photos opened on his phone. 
So, at this moment, when Xiaobao mentioned the four words "Uncle Bingshan," he was truly a bit stunned, but he vaguely sensed something was amiss. 
As he held the phone, ready to ask again for clarity, Ye Ning, on the other end, had already seen him taking the call. She quickly left the pile of jade and walked over, "Is that a call from Xiaobao?" 
Lin Yebai’s expression suddenly changed, but it was already too late to hang up the call... 
"Aning, he..." 
"Let me talk to him. I have been out for so long, I should have called him much earlier." Ye Ning, unaware of the situation on the phone and thinking the child was just being fussy on the other end, took the phone from his hand with a sense of guilt. 
"Hello? Xiaobao, it’s Mom!" 
"Mom, you finally answered my call! Where are you, mom? When will you be back?" Xiaobao immediately cried out loudly upon hearing his mother’s voice. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning felt even worse and quickly walked to a quieter area with the phone, trying to comfort him: "I’m sorry, Xiaobao. Mom will be back soon. Be good in the hospital room, and when Mom comes back, I’ll buy you something delicious, okay?" 
"I’ve already had dinner. Uncle Bingshan took me for pizza!" Xiaobao replied. 
"What did you say?" Ye Ning doubted her hearing, "Uncle Bingshan?" 
Ye Xiaobao nodded on the other end, "Yes, Uncle Bingshan. He came to see me today. Mom, Uncle Bingshan is so nice. He ordered a lot of tasty food, and I even got takeout, waiting for Mom to come back so we can eat together." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Wait, how could there be an Uncle Bingshan? When did that man go to the hospital? 
And how did Xiaobao end up going to have a meal with him? What about Xiaoqiao? 
Ye Ning started to feel disoriented, she didn’t care about anything else and promptly got her bag together in the resting room: "Xiaobao, where are you now?" 
Xiaobao answered cheerfully from the other end, "I’m in Uncle’s car. He said he’s taking me to do some errands. Mom, there’s no one in the hospital room. Xiaobao doesn’t want to go back." noveldrama
Ye Ning lost her last ounce of composure. Looking at the strange number that was still in the call, which was indeed the number she had once called, she couldn’t care about anything else. She hung up the phone, approached the man at the entrance of the resting room: "Big Brother Lin, I can’t stay here anymore. I must go back, right away."
###Chapter 196: Chapter 196: Want to Try Rebelling?
Lin Yebai had long suspected that something was amiss. Upon hearing these words, he no longer insisted and went inside to take his bag, nodding in agreement. 
"Has something happened? When I was on the phone just now, I heard Xiaobao say that Xiaoqiao went to class..." 
"It’s nothing. Ou Mucen went to the hospital." 
Ye Ning, with her mind in turmoil, really didn’t want to talk about it but, considering his care for her and her son, she still mentioned the person in question. 
Ou Mucen? 
As soon as that name came out, Lin Yebai, who had just started the car, immediately changed his expression, "Ou Mucen went to the hospital? What’s he doing there? Why would he be at the hospital at this time? So, Xiaobao is with him right now, correct?" 
He asked a barrage of questions as if they were coming out of a machine gun, completely overturning his usual composed and tranquil demeanor. 
Ye Ning frowned, feeling even more irritated... 
How would she know these things? Wasn’t she with him? If she knew, she wouldn’t be rushing back in such a hurry. 
Ye Ning turned her head to look out the window. This time, she did not answer him but responded with silence. 
Yes, why would that man suddenly go to the hospital? Given his temperament, it’s not possible. Moreover, he took Xiaobao out to eat, which is even more like a wild fantasy. What on earth happened to that man today? 
Ye Ning felt that this situation really sounded like something out of a thriller movie. How could she have heard about such a thing? 
—— 
However, over there, Ye Xiaobao, after successfully speaking to his mother on the phone and hanging up, showed a delighted face, "Uncle, my mom said she’s coming back. By the time you finish your business and return, my mom will probably have already arrived at the hospital." 
Ou Mucen was driving upfront and, upon hearing this, he simply gave a faint "hmm" in acknowledgment. 
Not urging her to come back meant she never intended to come back early, did it? 
The eyes of the man driving narrowed slightly, a trace of coldness passing across his lips... 
The Bentley was powerful and swift. In just about twenty minutes, Ou Mucen saw the beach, the palm trees, and there, on a prime location, stood a luxurious hotel. 
Qianshui Bay International Hotel! 
Ye Xiaobao saw the name of this grand hotel through the rear window and immediately got excited, scrambling up from his seat, "Uncle, are we going to this hotel?" 
Ou Mucen nodded and drove the car over to park, then got out of the car. 
"Uncle is going to meet a client soon. You’re not allowed to run around, or Uncle will leave you here," Ou Mucen warned him while unfastening his seatbelt, fearing that the little Baozi would wander off and something might happen. 
Ye Xiaobao looked at his uncle’s stern face and couldn’t help but smile, "Uncle, children need to be coaxed. By frightening him this way, you’ll probably make him more rebellious!" 
"Why?" 
"Because children like to contradict adults. The more you forbid them from doing something, the more they want to do it!" 
The chubby Little Baozi was very serious when he said this, as if he were the parent and this uncle was the one who needed to be taught. noveldrama
Contradict? 
Ou Mucen stared at him and gave a cold laugh, "You want to try?" 
Ye Xiaobao fell silent, obediently allowing himself to be carried down from the car and then carried into the grand hotel. 
This uncle has too much of a murderous aura. Forget it, it’s better for him to be well-behaved!
###Chapter 197: Chapter 197: Bumped into the Wrong Person!
Upon arriving at the hotel, the manager, who had been waiting there for some time, came over to greet the two as soon as he saw them. Ou Mucen saw this and casually handed over the child he was holding: "Take good care of him, or you no longer need to work here." 
"Yes, Third Young Master!" 
The manager respectfully took Little Baozi and was filled with shock and surprise in his heart, but he dared not ask a single question. 
It wasn’t until the esteemed guest entered the elevator and went upstairs that he dared to look at the chubby Little Baozi in his hands: "Little friend, what’s your name?" 
"Xiaobao!" 
"Xiaobao? Xiaobao is a good name. Who are your parents? How come you’re here today with the Third Young Master?" noveldrama
"Uncle, where are you taking me to play? Is there something good to eat? I haven’t eaten anything yet." 
The answer was completely unrelated to the question. Having answered, this Little Baozi then wriggled out of his grip and headed in the direction of the best beachside restaurant in the hotel. 
The manager, seeing this, was immediately panicked: "Hey, little ancestor, there are people eating over there. You can’t go." 
He chased after him, shouting all the way, almost at the expense of his own life. 
Yet Little Baozi ran so fast, managing to scurry in under two minutes—his little arms and short legs like those of a bunny—to the beautiful area surrounded by coconut palms and permeated with the scent of the sea breeze. 
This open-air restaurant was indeed the most beautiful spot in the hotel and a favorite place for many people in this city. 
However, today was a bit special. The entire open-air restaurant only had two people sitting at a table under the largest coconut tree, making it look rather deserted. 
Could business really be this bad here? 
Ye Xiaobao was still a child and didn’t understand these things. He approached and, seeing the dining chairs were exceptionally comfortable loungers, he climbed onto one without a second thought: "Uncle, I want to be like them. I want a coconut and a scoop of ice cream." 
Since the manager had chased him here, sweat was already dripping from his forehead. Seeing Little Baozi sitting in the chair like a lord and asking for food only made him wish he were dead: "Little friend, you want to eat this? Very well, let’s go back. Uncle will take you somewhere else to eat, okay?" 
"Why can’t we eat here? It’s very nice here, cool and with a view of the sea." 
"Yes, this place is nice, but it’s already been reserved by someone else. I’m not allowed to stay." 
"Reserved by someone else? Why is it reserved by someone else? Isn’t this your hotel’s property?" 
"That’s... um..." 
The hotel manager was so panicked he felt he was about to kneel before this little tyrant. How was he supposed to explain to this child what a private event meant? He was so young; even if he explained, would he understand? 
The hotel manager was on the verge of going crazy! 
It was at this time that the two people sitting there heard the noise and turned around. The woman in the yellow dress, facing away from them, was obviously not pleased and turned her head sharply: "What’s going on here? Who let you in? Don’t you know Miss Bai has reserved this place for today?" 
Her voice was high and shrill, her tone even more sharp and angry. After she spoke, the two people, one big and one small, immediately dared not move. 
"Miss Bai, I’m really sorry, it’s this child. He... he saw how beautiful it is here and came over. I will take him away immediately."
###Chapter 198: Chapter 198: This Child is the One from the Banquet
"How could you possibly be so incompetent? Do you really want me to call the owner of this hotel right now, make him fire you?" 
"Yes, yes, Miss Bai is right, I’m truly sorry!" 
The hotel manager was scared out of his wits, hurriedly picked up the child from the chair, and was about to take him away from there. 
But at that moment, another woman at the dining table looked over their way. When she saw the child’s face, her hand holding the wine glass paused mid-air. 
Why did this child look so familiar to her? 
Her gaze shifted slightly as she remembered something and immediately spoke up, "Wait! Bring that child over to me for a closer look." 
Bring him over? 
The girl across from her in the yellow dress was puzzled, "Xueshan, what are you doing? Everything’s fine, why do you need to look at this child?" 
The woman holding the wine glass smiled, "It’s nothing, I just feel like this child looks very familiar. Weiwei, do you remember the photo of the child we took that night at the villa? I think he looks quite similar." noveldrama
The girl in the yellow dress was stunned!
The child she photographed? 
Is she talking about... the child that appeared that night at the Blue Mountain Villa banquet, the one that caused her cousin so much trouble that he hadn’t been able to lift his head since?!! 
Bai Wei finally remembered, and immediately, she also turned her head to look at the child being brought over. 
Indeed, although she hadn’t gotten a close look at him that night, his delicate features, as well as his particular height and build, were exactly the same as the child who had appeared that night. 
Wow! 
So this child is the little bastard that made a mess of my cousin that day? 
Bai Wei recognized him and immediately stood up from her chair in a rage, "Well, well, well, if it isn’t this little brat. To think I’d find you without even looking, if I don’t kill you today, my last name isn’t Bai." 
Having said that, she actually reached out to snatch the child from the manager’s arms. 
The manager was shocked, "Miss Bai, what are you doing? This child, he was brought here by Young Master Mucen!" 
Young Master Mucen? 
Ou Mucen was also here? 
At that revelation, the woman who had been furiously approaching stopped in her tracks, and likewise, another woman who had been sitting there waiting for the show also changed her expression. 
Ou Mucen was actually here, then they really couldn’t touch this child; otherwise, if anything happened, neither of them could bear the responsibility. 
But how could they just let it go? Just because of this little bastard, the second branch of the Ou Family had been unable to raise their heads high, and Ou Yuze had been neglected to the point that he hadn’t yet returned to take charge at Longfeng. How could they not hate? How could they let it rest? 
The woman holding the wine glass thought of all this, her fingers tightening even more, while the malice in her eyes grew stronger! 
Last time, they played a double act with this child, causing a huge downfall for the second branch of the Ou Family. Today he brought the child here again, so, could it really be that the child had nothing to do with him? 
She looked at the child, "Manager, Miss Bai was just joking with you, she’s Young Master Mucen’s niece. How could she possibly harm one of his people? She just wants the child to stay here and play with us." 
Upon hearing this, the manager was torn, "But Young Master Mucen..." 
"Enough, stop with the ’Young Master Mucen.’ We’re all one family after all. Isn’t it natural to help our uncle look after a child?" 
PS: Thanks to some friends for their rewards, hoping to see more votes and comments, love you all...
###Chapter 199: Chapter 199: Do they think they can get information out of Ye Xiaobao’s mouth? Are they foolish?
"Stop with the ’but’s; we’re all family here, and taking care of the child is our duty. Put the kid down and go tell the third young master of the Ou Family." 
After speaking, the woman gestured to Bai Wei, who immediately went over and took the child from the manager’s arms. 
The manager was troubled, but since it had come to this, he couldn’t refuse, so he reluctantly let go and quickly went to find the third young master of the Ou Family. 
Bai Wei, seeing that, put down the child as well, and then the two women, with a predatory stare, looked as if they were two fierce wolves, eying their prey intently as they watched the child. 
Speak, who exactly are you? What is your relationship with Ou Mucen? Tell me, and I won’t torment you!" Bai Wei was the first to speak, her tone so vicious it was as if she wanted to tear the child apart. 
Ye Xiaobao was pressed into the chair, his small face tense, his big, bright black eyes unblinkingly staring at this older girl, looking completely terrified. 
Yang Xueshan saw this, her brows furrowed, and she pulled her away: "He’s still a child, Weiwei, go sit over there. I’ll handle this." 
Bai Wei huffed and reluctantly walked away! 
Once Bai Wei had left, Yang Xueshan, in an effort to pacify the child, personally took the ice cream she was eating from the table and offered it: "Come on, little friend, can you tell sister your name?" 
Ye Xiaobao glanced at the ice cream in her hand and indeed spoke with a milky voice: "Xiaobao..." 
Xiaobao? 
What a terribly bland name! 
Hearing this, Bai Wei let out another disdainful snort of laughter. noveldrama
A flicker of disgust crossed Yang Xueshan’s eyes as well, but she wasn’t Bai Wei. As a woman who had emerged from the shadows of schemes, her emotions weren’t so easily read on her face. 
Taking a spoonful from the ice cream, she smiled warmly at the child, "Come on, tell sister, who are your mommy and daddy? Then I’ll give you a bite of this ice cream." 
I’ll give you ten ice creams if you tell me who you two bad ladies are. 
The delicate and adorable Little Baozi looked at the spoonful of ice cream in her hand and sadly shook his head, "Sister, I can’t eat ice cream. Mommy said I have a bad stomach, and I get diarrhea if I eat it." 
Yang Xueshan: "..." 
Upon hearing that, Bai Wei’s brows shot up in indignation as she stormed over and threw away the ice cream from her hand: "I told you not to coddle him, what’s the point in spoiling a little bastard like that?" 
This woman, so fierce! 
The Little Baozi sitting in the chair pouted, and soon his eyes, as dark as black grapes, turned red: "Sister is being mean to me, I want to find Uncle, Uncle..." 
Crying, with his small arms and short legs, he tried to climb down from the chair to find Ou Mucen. 
Yang Xueshan, panicked, quickly scooped the child back up and complained to the woman beside her: "Weiwei, he’s just a child, what does he know? You need to be patient and not scare him all the time." 
"But he won’t even eat your ice cream!" 
"That’s because his stomach is upset. Didn’t you hear what he said? His mother told him he has a bad stomach and can’t eat ice cream." Yang Xueshan was quick to defend the child without an ounce of suspicion. 
In fact, this four-year-old Little Baozi, with his innocent, cute, dazed, and pure look, wouldn’t be suspected by anyone.
###Chapter 200: Chapter 200 Dare you touch my person?
Bai Wei finally calmed down again, sitting in the chair with a pale face, her gaze firmly fixed on Little Baozi. 
Little Baozi was still pouting, but when that sister who had been speaking up for him took an unopened coconut from the table and placed it in front of him to hold and drink, his little face finally brightened up. 
"Sister, it’s so yummy!" 
"It’s yummy, isn’t it? Then tell sister, how do you know that uncle? Does your mom have a relationship with that uncle?" 
The question was malicious. If Ye Xiaobao admitted it, then, in their eyes, his mother would definitely be thought to have an unspeakable relationship with Ou Mucen, and he would certainly be deemed his illegitimate child! 
In this way, the second branch of the Ou Family, including Ou Yuze, would be thoroughly vindicated. 
Indeed, what else could overturn the situation at that banquet more in their favor? 
Ye Xiaobao held the coconut, quietly looked at this woman, and after a while, said in a babyish voice, "Of course my mom has a relationship with that uncle." 
What? 
Yang Xueshan’s eyes immediately lit up, "What kind of relationship? Tell sister quickly!" noveldrama
Bai Wei also leaned in, and the way the two of them were staring at him, as if they were wolves, made him afraid to even breathe out loud.
Ye Xiaobao ignored the tension, lowered his little head, and took another big gulp, "He’s the boss, my mom works at that uncle’s company. Sister, it’s delicious, I want more." 
Yang Xueshan: "..." 
Bai Wei: "..." 
Suddenly, she jumped up from her chair and slapped the coconut out of the child’s hands, swearing at him, "You little bastard, hurry up and tell me, what exactly is your relationship with Ou Mucen? And, who exactly is your mother? Otherwise, I’ll throw you into the sea to feed the fish!" 
After shouting, she actually grabbed his small collar and lifted him up from the chair. 
Ye Xiaobao’s face turned pale. After all, he was just a four-year-old child, and no matter how smart he was, he would be scared in such a situation. 
His eyes turned red, and big tears really started to fall, "Bad woman, uncle won’t let you go!" 
Uncle? 
Still daring to mention uncle? 
The woman who had completely lost her sanity, became even more enraged when she heard that, and grabbing his collar with force, she really intended to throw the child out. 
Yang Xueshan was completely stunned, having forgotten what she should say! 
In the nick of time, at the entrance of the open-air restaurant, a tall figure strode over. Seeing the scene, he exploded with a shout towards this side, "Bai Wei, you try throwing him, I’ll make sure you leave here standing only to be carried out lying down!" 
With that roar, the arm that was about to throw the child abruptly stopped in mid-air. 
Ye Xiaobao, earlier terrorized by the insane woman and unable to speak, immediately looked over upon hearing his uncle’s voice, tears streaked on his little face as he stretched out his arms and burst into tears, "Uncle..." 
It was a heart-wrenching sight, the four-year-old child was only so tall, but now, he was held aloft like a frog, arms flailing, legs kicking, like a toy being played with, without the slightest shred of humanity. 
Ou Mucen walked over and, seeing this scene, felt a fierce twinge in his heart. Suddenly, he raised his hand and slapped the woman fiercely!
###Chapter 201: Chapter 201 - The Cost of Provoking Him!
"You’re nothing but a beast!" 
A slap came down, immediately silencing all the noise in the open-air restaurant. 
It was indeed a terrifying atmosphere! 
As if everything had frozen in place, in this seaside open-air restaurant, one could hear nothing at this moment, except the immense pressure of the silence surrounding them, suffocatingly quiet, and the man’s aura of destruction that could annihilate anything. 
It was too frightening! 
Yang Xueshan’s first thought was to escape, but at this time, it was not something she could simply do if she wanted to. So, she could only stand there, looking on as the man slapped the Bai Family’s young mistress fiercely to the side, blood spurting out. 
"Third Young Master, this..." The hotel manager who had come along was a bit worried. 
Yet before he could finish his sentence, the man who had just finished slapping spoke up again, "Send her to the Bai Family, let her mother have a good look at the kind of creature she has raised!" 
"..." 
As soon as he said this, Bai Wei, who had been stunned by the slap, finally regained her wits. 
Send her to her family’s home? 
No, absolutely not, if her mother found out she had offended him at such a crucial moment, she would never let her off, she would beat her to death. 
Bai Wei, with half her face swollen from the slap, began to tremble all over, quickly raising her head, she began to plead, "Little Uncle, I know I was wrong, please spare me this time, Uncle." 
"Spare you?"
The thoroughly enraged man glanced at the child still shivering in his arms and with an icy face full of coldness asked, "Did you spare this child just now? How old is he?" 
"I..." 
"Bai Wei, this is my final warning. If you push my limits again, I will ensure the Bai Family and the Ou Family are completely unrelated. I mean what I say!" 
His last words, like blades shot out from hell, sentence by sentence spilled from the man’s mouth, Bai Wei looked into those terrifying eyes and suddenly, overwhelming fear spread from the bottom of her heart. 
To sever ties between the Bai Family and the Ou Family? noveldrama
He certainly could do it. In A City, there was nothing that Ou Mucen could not accomplish if he wished! 
Bai Wei swayed, and finally, like a dead dog, she completely collapsed... 
—— 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, after teaching that woman a lesson, immediately left with the child in his arms, not even going to the restaurant, but taking him straight to the car. 
He didn’t know what kind of feeling it was, but when he heard from the manager that the child encountered Bai Wei in the open-air restaurant, the anxiety he felt at that moment was something he had never experienced in the business world. 
Later on, when he went to the restaurant and saw that insane scene, his rage intensified! 
To hit someone with his own hands, and a woman no less, this must be his first time, right? 
Bringing the small child to the car, he was just about to place him in the back seat when, just as he was letting go, the tiny arm reflexively tightened a little more. 
Without speaking, but fully feeling the lingering terror, Ou Mucen’s complexion turned even more ashen. He clenched his fingers, struggling to suppress the killing intent in the bottom of his heart, and then he picked up the child, heading straight to the driver’s seat.
###Chapter 202: Chapter 202: Big Brother Lin, Let Me Be Alone...
After all, he was just a child, and lying against his chest was no issue. 
So after bringing him in, he sat the child face-to-face on his lap and then buckled the small bundle into the seat belt, "Don’t be scared, Uncle is here." 
He had never comforted anyone before, but now, having fastened the seat belt, he clumsily patted the child on the back. 
Ye Xiaobao lay against his chest without looking up, but after hearing these words, the little head nodded, "Thank you, Uncle. Can we not tell Mommy, please?"
"Why?" 
"Mommy will worry if she hears, and I don’t want Mommy to worry." 
The child’s voice was soft and lacked the vivacity and liveliness from before. 
Yet, at this time, he was still thinking about his mom, the woman who was also rushing towards him in a hurry. 
Ou Mucen suddenly felt his chest tighten and turned to look out the window. After a long moment, he nodded, "Okay, how about Uncle takes you to see a doctor now? Let’s get a check-up to see if there is anything wrong with you. Then we can see Mommy." 
"Okay!" 
The child lying on Uncle’s body had his small arms and legs resting on him, soft and tender, just like a little puppy, incredibly cute. 
Hearing Uncle say he would check his injuries without letting Mommy find out, the little head nodded immediately, agreeing. noveldrama
Ou Mucen breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this, then started the car and drove away from the place. 
Bai Family! 
Dare they lay a hand on his people? 
It seemed he had been too kind to them! 
Seeing the child in his arms fall asleep so quickly, he took out his phone and dialed a number... 
"Third Master..." 
"Call a board meeting for tomorrow morning and say, I am going to divest from Ou’s Department Store." 
"..." 
What? 
A divestment from Ou’s Department Store? 
Secretary Gao on the other end of the phone could scarcely believe his own ears! 
Out of the blue, why divest from Ou’s Department Store? Isn’t it profitable? 
True, compared to the other industries of Ou’s, it isn’t that profitable, and the majority of its shares were held by the Bai Family, but that wasn’t a reason to divest, was it? Small profits are still profits, right? 
Secretary Gao suspected his BOSS had taken the wrong medicine! 
But the fact was, after saying that, he hung up the phone and then there were no more calls. 
Alright, divest from Ou’s Department Store... 
—— 
When Ye Ning returned to A City, it was already past four in the afternoon. Lin Yebai said it was close, but in reality, it was just the office that was near; the factory was quite far away. 
As soon as she returned to A City, she couldn’t wait to get out of the car. Seeing this from behind, Lin Yebai also opened the door and stepped out, "Aning, has Xiaobao been brought back already?" 
Ye Ning frowned and shook her head, "I don’t know, I’ll go up to check first." Saying this, she quickly entered the hospital. 
Lin Yebai followed her in after seeing this. 
However, what they didn’t expect was that when the two arrived at the hospital, the ward was still empty. Not only was there no one there, but her cell phone was also gone. It was clear that when they left, Xiaobao had taken it away. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning, agitated and anxious, raised her foot to step out. 
Lin Yebai hurried after her, "Where are you going?" 
Without turning, Ye Ning replied, "I’m going to find Ou Mucen. Brother Lin, if you have matters to attend to, go ahead. I’ll go look for Xiaobao."
###Chapter 203: Chapter 203: Finally Willing to Come Back?
Looking for Ou Mucen? 
Lin Yebai followed behind her, almost wanting to go with her. 
Ou Mucen, that man was so dangerous, how could he let her go find him alone? What if something happened? 
But as he followed her to the door, he saw the woman, who had already made her way to the nurse’s station, asking the nurse for a phone: "Nurse, may I borrow your phone to make a call? I don’t have my cell phone with me." 
"You are...?" 
"I’m a family member from room number 5, my child has been taken away." 
A family member from room number 5? 
The nurse flipped through the registry on the desk, and suddenly, her eyes lit up: "You must be Ye Xiaobao’s mother, right? Well, your child was taken away by the Third Young Master Ou. When he left, he specifically asked me to let you know when you came back, so you wouldn’t worry." 
He even specifically... asked the nurse to tell her? 
The woman, sweating with anxiety, stood there, stunned for a moment! 
He had always been a domineering and authoritative person who did whatever he wanted without considering other people’s feelings, but now, he had actually asked this nurse to specifically tell her. 
Ye Ning found it a bit hard to believe! 
But she couldn’t deny that the tight grip of anxiety in her chest, along with her worries, felt much better now. 
It seemed that his motive for finding the child wasn’t malicious. 
So after quickly thanking the nurse, she went downstairs. 
Behind her, Lin Yebai stood quietly, watching her at the nurse’s station. Seeing her relief and the faint surprise hidden on her face after hearing from the nurse that the man had left instructions about her child being taken, he did not follow her anymore. 
In truth, he wasn’t foolish. This incident had been messed up due to his arrangements, which had already upset her severely, but she hadn’t lost her temper with him and was still speaking to him in a calm tone. This indicated that probably because of the years he had helped her, she didn’t want to bear grudges or blame him. 
But even he felt that this time, it was indeed a bit too much! 
No longer following her, he returned to the hospital room and sat in the chair by the windowsill. He poured a glass of water, lit a cigarette, and began to watch the bustling city outside, quietly waiting. 
Waiting for her and her son to return... 
--- 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, after leaving the hospital, quickly hailed a taxi and got in. noveldrama
"Master, may I use your phone to make a call? I don’t have my cell phone with me." 
"Sure!" 
The taxi driver handed her the phone, and Ye Ning hurriedly took it and began dialing the phone number. 
She was a bit confused. Xiaobao had called her just before two o’clock, but now it was almost five, and Xiaobao still hadn’t returned to the hospital room. Where had they been for these three hours? 
As the president of the Ou Corporation, he was so busy every day, and now with a child, where could he have gone? 
Ye Ning was getting anxious! 
Fortunately, not long after the call was connected, a very familiar, magnetic male voice came through: "Hello..." 
Upon hearing the voice, Ye Ning immediately gripped the phone tight: "Ou Mucen, where have you taken Xiaobao? I’m back now." 
Finally decided to come back? 
The person on the other end of the phone, upon hearing her words, glanced at the little boy seriously assembling a model beside him...
###Chapter 204: Chapter 204: His Mouth is Really Venomous!
"You finally deigned to come back? I thought you weren’t going to return tonight." 
What did he say? 
Upon hearing the mocking and sarcastic voice on the phone, Ye Ning hurriedly explained, "No, I had something to do today. I’m Xiaobao’s mother, how could I possibly not come back?" 
Xiaobao’s mother? 
Does she even remember that she’s this child’s mother? 
It wouldn’t have been an issue if he hadn’t brought it up, but as soon as he did, the already ill-tempered man’s face turned even darker, "Is that so? I thought the kid was an orphan." 
"What did you say?" Ye Ning frowned deeply, "You’re calling him an orphan?" 
The man at the other end did not soften his words one bit, "Isn’t that the case? Alone in the hospital with no one to look after him, has anyone even remembered to check if he’s hungry? Does he need to eat? Even for drinking water, he has to boil it himself. Tell me, how is he any different from an orphan?" 
"You..." 
Ye Ning finally got a little angry. How could this person be so vicious in his speech? 
But after calming down, she realized she couldn’t rebut his accusations. 
Indeed, Xiaobao, left alone at the hospital today, was just like an orphan with no one to look after him, no one to remember whether he needed to eat. No one considered how such a small child would fare alone in that hospital room. 
The image of the small figure who would gaze out the window every day, eagerly looking down, suddenly brought a sharp pain to Ye Ning’s heart, and her eyes reddened. 
"Alright, Ou Mucen, I admit I was wrong. Now tell me, where exactly are you now?" Her voice had noticeably lowered by the end of the sentence. 
Ou Mucen sat there, his eyes not straying from the screen before him, but as he heard the plea on the phone, his fingers stopped tapping the keyboard for a moment. 
Just then, Little Baozi, who had been playfully wiggling his little bottom, also noticed the commotion and lifted his round head, "Uncle, is it Mommy calling?" 
Ou Mucen looked up, paused for a moment, then nodded, "Mhm!" 
"Wow, really? Then I’ll tell Mommy where we are so she can come to pick me up right away." After speaking, he scrambled up with his little arms and legs, and ran joyfully towards the phone. 
So, as Ye Ning waited in the taxi for a while, she finally heard her son’s voice, "Mommy, we’re at Platinum Apartments, where Uncle lives. Hurry and come get me!" 
Platinum Apartments? 
Where was that? 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning quickly turned to the taxi driver, "Sir, do you know where Platinum Apartments is?" 
The driver looked back, "Of course, Platinum Apartments are the most upscale apartments in A City." 
Good, knowing this meant she could find them. noveldrama
After getting the details of the exact address from her son on the phone, Ye Ning finally hung up, and handed the phone back to the taxi driver. 
Platinum Apartments? 
Why had that man taken Xiaobao to his apartment? Wasn’t he only supposed to take him out for a meal? After eating, couldn’t he have brought him back to the hospital? Why did he take him to his apartment? Wasn’t he supposed to be busy? Didn’t he have to go to the company today? 
Could it be because he had said earlier that he felt uneasy about Xiaobao being alone and uncared for in the hospital, that he had decided to keep him by his side? 
As the thought settled, Ye Ning, who was hastily making her way to the apartment, felt a sudden leap in her heart, and a touch of gratitude
###Chapter 205: Chapter 205: The First Time She Came to His Apartment
Five minutes later, at Platinum Apartments— 
It was indeed a large, high-end property. As Ye Ning stepped out of the taxi, she was instantly struck by the palpable sense of class distinction. 
Yes, the people living here must all be capitalists like that man, and her? 
She was just an ordinary citizen, which naturally made the class distinction all the more apparent. 
After exiting the taxi, she checked the apartment number she had noted down. She initially wanted to go straight in to pick up her child, but then she thought that since that man had taken care of her child for the whole day and even treated him to a meal, she stopped by the supermarket next to the neighborhood and bought an imported fruit basket. 
Imported, he wouldn’t look down on that, would he? 
With the fruit basket in hand, she finally entered and found her way to Mingcui Pavilion where Xiaobao had told her he was. 
"Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Ou in apartment 1101, may I come in?" 
"Mr. Ou?" 
The security guard sitting behind the security door sized her up and asked, "Are you here to clean their house? Wasn’t it already cleaned at noon today?" 
To clean? 
Did she look that bad? 
She looked down at herself, feeling a flare of frustration, "No, I have something to discuss with him, just help me open the door, that’s all." 
"That’s not possible, we can’t let you in unless you have the fingerprints of the owner or the owner has notified us in advance." 
"You..." 
Ye Ning had never imagined that the apartment complex had such stringent requirements, and she found herself angrily stamping her feet on the spot. 
Fortunately, at this moment, another person sitting next to the security guard noticed Ye Ning’s outfit and pondered, "Mr. Ou is the company’s CEO; it’s possible that an employee has come to see him. Here’s what we can do: press the call button to his apartment on the intercom and ask if he’s aware of this matter." noveldrama
"Okay!" It was only then that the security guard dialed the intercom system for them. 
Standing there, Ye Ning saw that once the intercom connected, a cold male voice said, "Let her in!" and finally, the door was opened. 
What kind of place was this? Was the entrance designed to be this paranoid, as if everyone was a thief? 
Carrying the fruit basket, Ye Ning soon took the elevator to the 11th floor and, using the apartment number, found the apartment. 
This was her first time at his apartment. She had been to Blue Mountain Villa and Orchid Garden before, but she had never been to his apartment. Now standing here, she didn’t know if it was because she felt guilty for having done something wrong or for some other reason, but she felt somewhat nervous. 
"Ding-dong—" 
"Uncle, it’s Mom! I’ll open the door!" 
The doorbell rang, and soon after, she heard the voice of a child inside running to the door. In a moment, the ivory-colored door was opened from the inside. 
"Mom, you’re finally here, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!" 
As the door opened, there he was, the little figure she had missed the entire day. Seeing her at the door, he flew towards her like a little swallow, full of joy. 
Ye Ning, seeing him, quickly put down the fruit basket and crouched down to hug him: "I’m sorry, baby, Mom is late, it’s all Mom’s fault, I shouldn’t have gone out today when you were discharged from the hospital." 
"It’s okay, the uncle visited me at the hospital today and took me out for lots of yummy food, and he also took me out to play. Look, Mom, we bought so many things."
###Chapter 206: Chapter 206: Play with him? She’s still too green!
The little child, upon seeing his mother arrive, had already forgotten everything in his excitement and hurriedly pulled her inside. 
Thus, Ye Ning could only awkwardly carry the fruit basket inside, and afterward, it was in this spotlessly clean and understatedly luxurious apartment that she saw the man sitting at the desk. At that moment, he didn’t even lift an eyelid, just kept typing away on the notebook. 
Should she go over and greet him? 
Ye Ning, recalling the quarrel that had taken place over the phone before coming, instantly felt even more nervous. Letting go of her son’s little hand, she plucked up the courage to approach him, "Third Young Master, about today, I really want to thank you." 
"..." 
No one paid attention to her, the only responses she got were the "click-clack" sounds of the keys being struck by slender fingers and, furthermore, the sound of the air conditioning blowing through the apartment. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning felt even more awkward inside and wanted to say something more, but the frozen atmosphere and the fact that he hadn’t even glanced at her made it quite difficult for her to speak. 
So, after standing there for a while and rubbing her sweat-soaked palms, she went over to her son. 
"Xiaobao, did Uncle buy this for you?" 
"Yes, Uncle bought it when he took me out. Isn’t it pretty?" 
"Pretty, did you thank Uncle?" 
"I did..." 
An utterly pointless conversation that made Ye Ning feel awkward. 
Of course, it also made her feel hollow inside! 
Today, she had gone job hunting. Just last night, she had submitted her resignation letter, and early this morning, she had gone to her new company. It would have been fine if he hadn’t found out, but now that he had caught her in the act, which boss would tolerate such "betrayal"? 
Ye Ning felt she couldn’t stay any longer and wanted to leave with her son. noveldrama
"That said, Third Young Master, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be taking Xiaobao with me now. He was discharged from the hospital today, and I still have to manage the paperwork for him there." 
Discharged? 
The man who had been sitting at the desk all this time waiting for this woman to offer an explanation finally narrowed his eyes after hearing that and pushed his notebook aside, "Discharged? Do you think the hospital operates just for you?" 
"What?" Ye Ning did not understand, "What do you mean ’operates just for me’? What are you trying to say?" 
What am I trying to say? 
Ou Mucen leaned back in his chair, staring coldly at her, "You’re asking me what I mean? Should I make a call to the hospital director to have him specifically arrange your son’s discharge for this time?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Standing there, flushed and embarrassed for quite a while, she finally managed to squeeze out, "I’m sorry, I was wrong about today. I went out early in the morning and didn’t stay at the hospital..." 
"You don’t have to apologize to me, this matter has nothing to do with me!" 
Ou Mucen interrupted her with evident impatience, rising from his chair. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning felt even less sure of what to say. She walked over and followed behind him, "It’s not that – I’m apologizing because my child caused trouble for you today, and I’m truly sorry about that." 
Is that it? 
Ou Mucen, hearing this, felt his rage building, turned around, and towered over this woman, "Oh really? If you feel so sorry, then you can repay me." 
"Repay?" 
"Yes, it was two thousand for taking your son to dinner, fifteen thousand for the trip to the beach with him, and fifty thousand for that model. As for my time as the CEO of Ou Corporation, I’ll begrudgingly charge you fifty thousand for an hour, how about that? Shall we get a calculator to add it up?"
###Chapter 207: Chapter 207 This Child Definitely Isn’t Her Biological Child
"..." 
Ye Ning’s mouth hung open for at least five seconds, completely dumbfounded. 
What was he talking about? 
Hourly charges? He was still talking about hourly charges with her? Half a million per hour? 
Why doesn’t he just shoot for the sky? 
Ye Ning finally felt a surge of anger, just about to retort, but at that moment, Little Baozi, who was fiddling with the model over there, heard Uncle’s words and, realizing Uncle was bullying Mommy again, threw his arms down, got up, and walked towards the two. 
"Uncle, how can you be like this? I’ve told you many times, you can’t bully a girl. Doing this will only make her more disobedient!" 
"What did you say?" 
"Oh Mommy, didn’t you understand? Uncle is bullying you because you prefer that lousy company over his, and he’s annoyed about it." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Ou Mucen, who was standing there ready to give that woman a good lesson, had his face turn pitch black after being called out: "Shut up!" 
Ye Xiaobao, tugging at his pant leg, laughed: "Uncle, don’t be mad. My mommy didn’t really want to go. You should let her explain properly, and after she’s done, continue working at your company." 
"Ye Xiaobao!!" 
"Oh no, my model is about to collapse, you two chat slowly..." In a flash, the little rascal scuttled back to his own territory. 
Ye Ning was so infuriated she was steaming, really wanting to grab him and give him a few smacks on the bottom. 
What kind of child was this? Was he born just to set her up? 
She stood there, both embarrassed and vexed, really wishing she could immediately take the little rascal and leave this place... 
Likewise, Ou Mucen wasn’t having any easier of a time. As the CEO of Empire Company, a powerhouse in the business world where he usually called the shots, today, he was caught off guard by a little brat, and his face was hanging by a thread. noveldrama
However, he was a man after all, and moreover, a man used to giving orders. 
So, seeing this woman baited by her own son and standing in front of him, looking as if she dearly wished to burrow into a hole, he actually became calm again. Afterwards, he didn’t say anything and, with a snort, went straight back to his desk and sat down. 
Now that the truth was out, well, he really wanted to hear what kind of explanation this damn woman would come up with. 
The laptop opened, he re-entered the page, and the figure in jeans and a T-shirt really came over... 
"Ou Mucen, about this matter, I actually already told you. In B City, I mentioned wanting to resign." 
"..." 
Without picking up on her cue, he appeared as if he couldn’t see her at all once he was back at his desk, never taking his eyes off the laptop screen. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning swallowed and had no choice but to pluck up her courage and continue: "But I definitely hadn’t decided on my next step before resigning. The company today was... My master just happened to have a friend who needed help, so I went." 
Just happened to have a friend who needed help? 
As soon as she said this, the man in front of the computer finally looked up with a cold gaze: "What friend? Someone else in the jade business?" 
"Yes!" Ye Ning nodded eagerly: "A raw material supplier. I didn’t know beforehand." 
"So, it was your master who arranged this?" 
"..." 
The more she heard it, the stranger it sounded. 
Ye Ning began to rub her palms together...
###Chapter 208: Chapter 208 She’s Going Bankrupt!!!
Ye Ning rubbed her palms together, about to say something, when the man across from her suddenly began to curse, "Do you even have a brain? Is everything about your master? Are you still not weaned? Or is it that you and your master have an unusual relationship? If that’s the case, then why venture out at all? Why not just stick with him?" 
"What?"
Ye Ning was stunned by this sudden barrage of scolding! 
What was wrong with him? Had she not just told him that this was arranged by Brother Lin? Was there really a need for such a violent temper, as if he were about to tear her apart? 
Ye Ning also felt a surge of anger, "What nonsense are you talking about? He’s just my master, I didn’t say anything else!" 
Ou Mucen sneered, "Have you ever seen anyone else’s master like this? You’re only his disciple, not his private property. Do you need his approval for everything you want to do?" 
Ye Ning was at a loss for words! 
The comments were harsh, but she couldn’t deny that every word he said reflected exactly how Lin Yebai was treating her at the moment. 
Ye Ning suddenly didn’t want to explain anymore. She smoothed her bangs and calmly looked at the man, "Say whatever you want, it’s fine. Anyway, I still have to thank you for today, for taking care of Xiaobao, and I’m also very sorry about quitting my job to work at another company." 
Ou Mucen snorted coldly and remained silent! 
Seeing this, Ye Ning knew that continuing the conversation was pointless. She turned to walk over to her son, "Xiaobao, we’re leaving." 
Ye Xiaobao looked up, "Are you done talking?" 
"We’re done. Let’s go home now." Ye Ning pulled him up from the ground and began gathering his things. 
Ye Xiaobao glanced at the uncle across from him, whose expression had not softened much. He frowned and asked, "Mom, why does uncle still look so upset?" 
"Never mind him. Let’s go home!" noveldrama
"How can that be? I called him today to go to the hospital. Then he took care of me, brought me out to eat and play, and even bought me clothes. Mom, you can’t treat uncle like this." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
It wasn’t that she wanted to treat him a certain way—she had explained, but he wouldn’t listen, right? And he had said such unpleasant things. 
Ye Ning didn’t intend to entertain her son’s words, crouching down to put shoes on him... 
Wait a minute! 
Did he just mention clothes? 
Only then did she belatedly realize the significance of that word, and immediately, her gaze fell on her hands. 
Indeed, these little shoes, she’d never seen them either?! 
"These are..." 
"Uncle bought them for me too. He took me to the beach to play, and when my clothes got dirty, uncle took me to buy new clothes and shoes. Mom, do they look pretty?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Pretty my foot! You profligate child, do you have any idea how much this outfit costs? 
Earlier, that bastard Ou Mucen had the nerve to charge her for meals, company, and model toys, and now a whole set of clothes, which immediately made her throw the little shoes to the ground. 
VIVU Barbie! 
Damn it! 
Wasn’t that the highest-end children’s fashion brand in the whole A City? She remembered when she first arrived here, Brother Lin gave some children’s clothes to Xiaobao, including a small vest from this brand, worth twenty thousand. 
And now, it was a whole set, the latest summer model too... 
Ye Ning felt like going mad, "Why did you let him buy you clothes? Don’t you have clothes to wear?!!" 
She lowered her voice, but the frustration in her tone could be felt throughout the room. 
Ye Xiaobao looked innocent, "Uncle bought them. He said I couldn’t come into his house looking all dirty."
###Chapter 209: Chapter 209: She Simply Couldn’t Escape the Palm of His Hand
"Mommy, uncle didn’t not want to take Xiaobao to the hospital, he was just worried that Xiaobao would be alone in the hospital with no one to care for him, so he brought him to his house. Mommy, don’t worry, uncle won’t really ask you for money, he was just playing with you." 
The child, only four years old, seeing the anxious look on his mother’s face as she crouched before him, hastily added another sentence. 
Ye Ning’s cheeks flushed red! 
Of course, she knew that the man would never actually ask her for money. The reason she had lashed out at her son was because she had already troubled him a lot today, and now with buying such expensive clothes, how was she going to repay this kindness to him? 
She had even resigned from her job at his company now. 
Ye Ning crouched on the ground, struggled for a long time, and finally, she stood up again and returned to the man, "I’m sorry, I may have spoken too harshly earlier, my mood today was actually quite bad, indeed, just as you said, I also don’t like to be controlled by others, but he is my master, he has shown me kindness, there are some things, I don’t want to make him angry." 
She actually admitted to the criticism he had made of her? 
The man who was tapping on a notebook, his gaze flickered slightly as his fingers paused. 
"And then what?" 
"Then..." Ye Ning, who mustered a lot of courage, got stuck again after being asked this! 
Then, she of course felt that if she could return to Ou’s, that would be the best, because after visiting that new company today, things weren’t as good as Lin Yebai had said. She came here to get closer to Longfeng, and that new company was simply one of the several candidate firms for Longfeng. She really felt it was unnecessary. 
So, Ou’s was still her best choice at heart! noveldrama
But should she say it now? She had only handed in her resignation letter yesterday, and then made such a move today. If she spoke up now, wouldn’t he mock and ridicule her? 
He was always so caustic, with such a sharp tongue... 
Ye Ning struggled for a very long time, and at last, looking at him, she forced out, "Then, after comparing, I still feel that your company is better. If I say... I want to come back, would you agree?" 
Come back? 
The man who heard these words sat in his chair, his expression unreadable, and his deep, black eyes showed no hint of emotion. His entire demeanor was chilling. 
So, he didn’t agree? 
Ye Ning felt like she couldn’t bear it anymore. She was someone with strong pride, and speaking such words had already taken great courage. 
Seeing him sitting there without moving or speaking, she started to have second thoughts, "If you don’t agree..." 
"Do you know what happens to employees who dare to get fired from Ou’s?"
"What happens?" 
Ou Mucen gave a cold smile, "You will find yourself unable to get a job anywhere in A City!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Standing there, she stared at the man for a full five seconds, finally exhaling the breath that had been held in her throat. 
How relieved she was that she hadn’t worked at that company today, and how relieved she was that she had been honest with him. 
"You..." 
"You can come back, but you’ll have to pay the price for your actions." 
"What price?" 
"Your salary halved, bonuses halved, vacation days halved, and... your contract period extended!" 
"..." 
Staring at this devil-like man, Ye Ning took more than ten deep breaths, managing to suppress the urge to take off her shoe and throw it at his face.
###Chapter 210: Chapter 210: They’ve all been reduced, how is she supposed to support her child?!!
She knew it, the wicked capitalist, the privileged second-generation heir, he wasn’t going to let her off easily. Sure enough, now her blood was about to be squeezed dry by him. Salary cut in half? Bonus cut in half? 
!!! 
Bastard, with all those reductions, what was she going to use to support her child?!!! 
"Why are you glaring at me? If you don’t like it, you can get lost. No one is begging you to stay." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
She took a long deep breath before finally forcing a smile back on her face and hurriedly waved her hands at him, "Not at all, not at all, I should thank Third Young Master Ou for giving me another chance. Well then, I will take Xiaobao and leave now, and I’ll be on time for work tomorrow." 
Ou Mucen glanced at her with a face full of disdainful ridicule. 
Try to play him? 
As if she didn’t weigh her own worth. 
Ye Ning, pretending not to see, went over and saw Xiaobao piecing together a model. She thus asked him where his changed clothes were. 
Ye Xiaobao pointed at the bathroom: "They’re in there. Uncle helped me change and then threw them inside." 
This guy actually helped the kid change clothes? noveldrama
Ye Ning turned back in surprise, only to see that bastard, having successfully exploited her, had gone about his business as if nothing had happened, his entire expression as if he couldn’t hear the conversation on this side at all. 
This was indeed a most baffling thing. 
Ye Ning got up from the floor and headed for the bathroom. 
Third Young Master Ou of the Ou Family had been waited on hand and foot since he was young, she knew that. To be frank, for such a young master to be able to take care of himself was already quite an accomplishment. And he could even help a child change clothes? 
Ye Ning found it hard to believe, but when she got to the bathroom and saw the two pieces of clothing thrown carelessly into the sink, almost like rags, she sort of understood. 
These clothes were definitely not changed by him but by Xiaobao himself. Only Xiaobao would undress in such a style. 
As she fished the clothes out of the sink, she originally intended to put them in a bag to take home and wash, but as she lifted them out and smelled the sweaty odor from the water, she frowned slightly. 
"Heh, Third Young Master, do you have soap at your place?" 
Soap? 
What the devil is "soap"? 
Ou Mucen looked up from the pile of data on his computer: "What are you trying to do?" 
Ye Ning hurriedly explained with her wet hands, "Xiaobao’s clothes have been soaking in there and they stink. I thought I’d wash them before taking them back. You don’t mind, do you?" 
Washing clothes? 
That’s nothing. 
He understood her and so he pointed towards the cabinet where the cleaning lady kept her cleaning tools: "See if there’s any there. I don’t keep such things." 
Such things... 
The young master really is a young master; he doesn’t even know what soap is! 
Ye Ning went to the cabinet, opened the door, and began to search. Fortunately, she found a bottle of laundry detergent that the cleaning lady probably used for cleaning rags. 
She brought it over and put the two tiny pieces of clothing in the sink, readying to wash them. 
But just as she was about to start, she caught a glimpse from the corner of her eye of a piece of clothing on a chair in front of the bathtub. The clothing, an off-white color, had workmanship and texture that were both first-rate. 
It seemed that these clothes were also taken off by him. 
Should she take the opportunity to wash them as well?
Her thoughts drifted to the last time she washed his wet clothes for him at the hotel. Her gaze shifted and she finally went over, picked up the shirt, and then placed it in the sink with the other clothes.
###Chapter 211: Chapter 211: A Family of Three...
This was a wonderful atmosphere, even though they were two parallel lines that had never intersected, yet today, because of a child, because of a sudden accident, their lives intersected, and what’s more, they ended up under the same roof. 
It was a very strange feeling. 
Ou Mucen was holding a cup of water, sitting there, looking at the company’s stock market, when suddenly he smelled the scent of laundry detergent in the air, and he paused, lifting his eyes to look in that direction. 
That was his bathroom, which due to his severe obsession with cleanliness, had only been entered by himself over the years. 
But now, behind the frosted glass, he could see a blurred figure, a white shirt, light blue pants, standing there, it was unclear what she was doing? After the soft sounds of scrubbing came from inside, the pleasant smell of laundry detergent, with a hint of lemon, wafted out. 
And outside was the pinkish Little Tuanzi! 
At that moment, his tiny body was lying on the clean floor, focusing on assembling his model. 
What was this scene? A woman washing clothes in the bathroom, a child playing with toys in the living room, and he was at his desk, dealing with work; it all looked just like the scene of a family of three often shown on television. 
"Pfft—" 
The moment this thought jumped into his mind, the water he’d just sipped entered his mouth and made him choke, and he spat it all back out. 
Little Baozi, lying on the floor playing with his model, suddenly heard Uncle’s choking sound, and his little head popped up, "Uncle, what’s wrong?" 
The man seated at the desk immediately put the cup back down, pretending nothing had happened, "Nothing serious, just choked a little." 
"Oh—" Little Baozi eyed the faint blush on his face with suspicion before looking away. 
Does choking on water make your face turn red? 
Little Baozi continued playing with his model, and at that moment in the bathroom, his mother called him, "Xiaobao, ask Uncle if he has a clothes hanger?" 
Clothes hanger? 
Little Baozi climbed up from the ground and went to his mother’s side, "Why do we need a clothes hanger? Is Mom going to hang my clothes at Uncle’s place to dry?" 
Ye Ning was wringing out the water, and when she saw her son coming over, she naturally smiled, "No, Mom washed one of Uncle’s shirts along with the laundry, so we’ll take yours with us and hang his to dry." noveldrama
Wow, she actually helped Uncle wash his clothes! 
Little Baozi became excited and hopped over. Standing in front of Uncle with his chubby little arms, he leaned on his desk, "Uncle, do you have a clothes hanger? My mom washed your clothes for you." 
"What?" Ou Mucen was momentarily stunned, "She washed my clothes?" 
Ye Xiaobao nodded with a smile, "Yep, she washed them very clean, and they smell nice. Uncle, hurry and bring the clothes hanger, I’ll take it to Mom to hang." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Who allowed her to wash his clothes? Didn’t she know that his clothes were high-end personalized tailoring and basically ruined if hand-washed? 
Yet, damned as it was, in the end, he actually let Little Baozi get a clothes hanger from his wardrobe for his mother, and then, he just sat there, watching Little Baozi enter the bathroom.
"Mom, I brought the clothes hanger." 
"Good, my darling is so sweet. Mom will hang Uncle’s clothes, and can you pack up your two items for Mom?"
###Chapter 212: Chapter 212: Mrs. Ou Suddenly Arrived!
"Okay!"
Little Baozi was also very well-behaved. Hearing what his mom said, after she left with the clothes, he stayed inside and diligently helped his mom with the chores. noveldrama
Ou Mucen had been sitting there, watching all along, when suddenly he saw the woman come out of the bathroom. His gaze, which had lingered a beat too long, immediately fell upon the cream-colored piece of clothing in her hands, cleaned and fresh. 
"Um, when I was helping Xiaobao wash, I saw your clothes there and cleaned them too. Where do you usually hang clothes to dry here?" 
"..." 
The man sitting there stared at the garment in her hands, and upon realizing it was pretty much ruined, his face became expressionless, "I don’t know, I never hang clothes." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
That’s right, this man was a pampered young master accustomed to having everything done for him. How would he know about things like washing or hanging clothes to dry? 
So she started searching around the apartment herself and, fortunately, even though the apartment was luxurious, it still had the necessary facilities for daily life. Finally, Ye Ning found the balcony where clothes could be hung, spread out the freshly washed cream-colored shirt, propped it up on a hanger, and hung it up. 
It looked a bit wrinkled. Should I not have wrung it out? 
Ye Ning stood there, looking at the shirt which even when spread out was still wrinkled, her eyebrows furrowing in concern. 
As she was looking, a loud "bang" suddenly came from the direction of the bathroom. She startled and immediately turned to look, only to see the man who had been sitting at the desk also glance in her direction before suddenly rising and striding towards the bathroom, "What happened?" 
"Xiaobao—" 
She saw, and in her urgency, she threw the basin aside, caring for nothing else, and ran over quickly. 
It was only in the bathroom did she see that the child had accidentally knocked over the whole basin of water she had placed on the washstand. She had been using it to clean the clothes because the sink was too small, so she used the basin instead. 
But somehow, the child had managed to spill the entire basin, which wouldn’t have been a big deal, except he also soaked himself from head to toe! 
Now what should she do? His clothes had just been washed, hadn’t they? 
Ye Ning looked at her son standing in the bathroom, drenched like a drowned rat, and for a moment, she was at a complete loss. 
Ou Mucen, on seeing this scene, casually took a large towel from the cabinet above the bathroom and wrapped up the shivering child before carrying him out. 
"What are you still standing there for? Aren’t you going downstairs to buy him a dry set of clothes?" 
Ah? 
Oh, Oh!! 
Right, clothes! 
Reminded at last, Ye Ning immediately grabbed her purse and hurried downstairs. 
Although it wasn’t winter at the moment, Xiaobao was a child, and getting doused with that basin of cold water obviously meant he needed a change of clothes right away. What if he got sick? 
Ye Ning ran quickly, taking the elevator at top speed to go buy clothes for her son. Meanwhile, outside, the night had settled into a scene of myriad lights flickering... 
Twenty minutes later, Ye Ning finally found suitable children’s clothing and was ready to head back to the apartment. But as she arrived at the security station below the building, she saw a young girl in a light blue dress, accompanying a very elegant and distinguished lady, standing there. 
"Mrs. Ou? What brings you here? Are you here to see Mr. Ou?" 
"Yes, is he in?"
###Chapter 213: Chapter 213 She is the Cleaner in President Ou’s Apartment
"He’s there, President Ou has been in the apartment all day today." 
"..." 
Clearly recognizing the woman who had stepped in, the two security guards who had stopped Ye Ning at the door greeted her with warm enthusiasm. 
Ye Ning began to sweat on her forehead because she too recognized who this woman was. 
Bai Tingfang! noveldrama
The current matriarch of the Ou family, the mother of the man upstairs. 
My God, why did she suddenly come here?!! 
Ye Ning felt a tingling on her scalp, thinking about her son still upstairs, and about Ou Mucen downstairs, who was completely unaware, she was so anxious that she stamped her feet, but unfortunately, she had left in such a hurry that she even forgot her phone. 
It’s over! 
Now the trouble is really big. 
As anxious as ants on a hot pot, the security guard who was greeting the woman suddenly spotted Ye Ning and pointed towards her: "There, she’s the cleaner President Ou hired, she’s been cleaning upstairs all day today." 
A cleaner? 
Hearing this, Bai Tingfang looked over her shoulder and upon seeing a young girl in a white T-shirt and blue jeans standing behind her, her brows furrowed instantly: "She’s a cleaner?" 
The guard nodded: "Yes, she went up around 5:30 this afternoon, by that time we had confirmed it with President Ou." 
Actually, when Ye Ning had come here, the security had confirmed with Ou Mucen upstairs whether she was an employee of his. But for some reason, whether it was because they had been sitting too long or something else, they mistook Ye Ning for the cleaner who cleaned his room. 
Do I really look like a cleaner? 
Ye Ning watched as the woman’s sharp gaze swept from the top of her head all the way down and, just like the guard, her expression turned to one of disdain and disgust. Ye Ning couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable. 
"How come the quality of domestic service companies is declining more and more? They even recruit these little girls fresh out of school to be cleaners?" 
"Exactly, Mrs. If you feel reassured, I’ll find a reliable one for the young master tomorrow. That way, we can be more at ease with the cleaning." 
The young girl who had been following closely beside Bai Tingfang, who knows who she was, immediately offered consolation with a smile after seeing how angry Bai Tingfang was. 
Upon hearing this, Bai Tingfang, with a darkened face, finally softened a bit and then she entered with the young girl. 
Ye Ning stood right behind them! 
Of course, she too needed to go in. Xiaobao was still in that apartment. Who knew what those two women would do once they went up there? 
Besides, Ou Mucen was also unaware of this matter. If his mother suddenly saw a child in his apartment, how would he explain? How would he tell this woman about Xiaobao’s identity? 
Ye Ning struggled for a long time, and finally decided to go in with them. 
"What are you coming in for?" 
"I’m sorry, Mrs. Ou, my work upstairs isn’t finished yet. I just came down to buy some tools." Saying this, Ye Ning gestured with the tightly tied plastic bag in her hand. 
Bai Tingfang, seeing this, flashed a look of disgust on her face again! 
The young girl wasn’t much better, covering her nose the moment she saw Ye Ning. 
"Madam, please bear with it. Once we get upstairs, I’ll have her clean up her things and get out." 
"Hmm!" Bai Tingfang glanced disdainfully and stepped back several steps. 
Ye Ning saw in the mirror of the elevator, the corner of her mouth coldly twitched, and a hint of scornful disdain surfaced on her face...
###Chapter 214: Chapter 214: Ou Mucen, Your Mom is Here!!
She really thinks she’s so noble, completely forgetting what her status was back then? How did she climb to her current position? If we’re really comparing, I, Ye Ning, am much purer than she is. 
Ye Ning coldly withdrew her gaze, no longer looking at the two women. 
Soon, they reached the 11th floor. To alert the person inside, Ye Ning strode over to the apartment and pressed the doorbell forcefully, "Third Young Master, your mother is here!" 
She called out loudly, afraid the people inside wouldn’t hear her! 
As a result, the two women who followed her out looked even more displeased, "What are you yelling for? Isn’t there a doorbell? You have no manners at all, clearly someone from the countryside." 
What’s wrong with coming from the countryside? 
People from the countryside are much more honest than you city folk. 
Ye Ning stepped aside, looking sincerely at the two women, "No, Mrs. Ou, I was just so happy to see you come that I couldn’t help but share the good news with Young Master Ou." 
The young girl sneered immediately, "Do we need you to announce our arrival? How superfluous!" 
After saying that, she went to knock on the door. 
Ye Ning saw this and did not stop her, just stood to the side and quietly watched. 
The soundproofing of the apartment door wasn’t that great, and she believed that after shouting so loudly at the door a moment ago, the person inside must have heard her. Whether what followed was good or bad luck would depend entirely on the man’s reaction inside. 
As expected, the young girl knocked on the door, and soon after, the door was opened from the inside... 
"Mom, why are you here?" 
"What, you’re not happy to see me?" 
Bai Tingfang stood at the door and, upon seeing it was her dear son who answered, pushed the door open and went straight in. 
The young girl followed her in as well. 
Only Ye Ning, upon seeing the man pushed aside at the door, began to frantically gesture, "Where’s Xiaobao? Quick, send him out!" 
Ou Mucen was actually taken aback. When she was yelling at the door, he was in the middle of taking Little Baozi to the bathroom. 
Wrapped in his bathrobe, it was too long and too big for a four-year-old child who couldn’t go to the toilet alone, so he carried him there. 
But just as they got to the bathroom, she started yelling from outside! 
Send him out? 
How could he send him out? They had already entered, so what difference would it make whether he sent him out or not? 
Ou Mucen glared at her with a cold face, indicating his mood was very foul, "Are you a pig? Don’t you know to call me from downstairs?" 
Huh?
Call? 
Ye Ning quickly explained, "I wanted to, but I was in such a rush going out that I forgot to bring my phone." 
You forgot your phone? 
Well then, just wait to see how you die! 
The man, feeling extremely irritable, turned around and walked away. noveldrama
Ye Ning panicked when she saw this. Not caring about the man’s status, she reached out and grabbed him, "Ou Mucen, please, send Xiaobao out to me. He can’t be discovered by your mother, or else we’re finished." 
That’s right! Under such circumstances, in such a place, if Bai Tingfang found out Ye Xiaobao was here and learned about his mother, she would definitely not let her off the hook. Women like Bai Tingfang are incredibly harsh on women of uncertain origin who target her son, especially since Ye Ning was a single mother.
###Chapter 215: Chapter 215: You Reap What You Sow
And what she worried about was, if this woman saw Xiaobao and started investigating, and if she discovered that she was the daughter once adopted by Mei Liping, then the situation would really become troublesome. It wasn’t just that all her efforts would have been in vain, but even their lives, hers and her son’s, would be in danger. 
So, no matter what, she must not let Bai Tingfang know about Xiaobao. 
But what about this man? 
After glaring fiercely at the hand she was holding, he gritted his teeth and said, "Let go!" 
Ye Ning immediately shook her head, "I won’t let go! Not unless you get my son out first!" 
What? 
She actually dared to threaten him?!! 
The man’s noble and cold face turned completely as dark as coal, "What if I don’t agree?" 
Ye Ning’s eyes widened, "Why wouldn’t you agree? What good does it do you to keep the child with you?"
No good at all, but he pleased to do so, was that any of her business? 
Ou Mucen turned and walked away! 
Seeing this, Ye Ning panicked. Just as she was about to pull him back and discuss it further, Bai Tingfang, who hadn’t seen her son come into the room yet, came over again. "Mucen, what are you doing? Why aren’t you coming in? Don’t you welcome your mom?" noveldrama
At that sentence, Ye Ning immediately let go! 
Dammit! 
This bastard! 
"Nothing, Mom, what would you like to drink?" Ou Mucen elegantly entered, noticing his mother and cousin already sitting on the sofa. He then went straight to the fridge and grabbed drinks for the two. 
Ye Ning, watching from the side, was hopping mad, but there was nothing she could do about it. 
What exactly did this bastard want to do? Didn’t he realize the trouble her and her son’s presence could cause him here? Did he even have a brain? 
What Ye Ning didn’t know was that Ou Mucen was so calm because he had long known the purpose of his mother’s visit. After slapping Bai Wei at the open-air restaurant during the day and then having Secretary Gao announce the news of selling Ou Department Store, the Bai Family would definitely rush to the Ou Family immediately. And his mother, upon learning of this, would of course come to find him right away. 
So, it didn’t matter whether the child hid or not, because Bai Tingfang already knew of his existence. 
Only, he was a bit hesitant about whether he should let his mother know that this child was this woman’s son. 
"What are you standing there for? Why don’t you come in and finish up the cleaning? What’s with all this mess? Have cleaning companies gotten this bad? Who do they even hire?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Cleaning worker? 
Did she take her for a cleaning worker? 
Ye Ning was also startled for a moment, having forgotten in her dispute with that bastard that she had such an identity. 
That’s right, she was a "cleaning worker" now, so she could rightfully go inside and take her son. Why was she still counting on this bastard? 
Finally, Ye Ning’s eyes brightened, and without caring about how astonished and odd the man’s gaze on her was, she walked past him with the plastic bag in her hand, "I’m sorry Madame Ou, I will clean up immediately, right away!!" 
As she spoke, she went straight to the utility room to grab cleaning tools. 
Ou Mucen’s mouth opened slightly, his eye corners beginning to twitch violently... 
"Mucen, have you been in the apartment all day today?" 
"Hmm?" 
Ou Mucen’s gaze was still twitching as he fixedly stared at that figure, who started to search around his apartment like a thief under the guise of cleaning...
###Chapter 216: Chapter 216: Mucen, Where’s the Child?
Is she foolish? 
Such a big child, and he can still hide him? 
"Mucen? What are you thinking about? Mom is talking to you." 
"Huh? Mom, what did you say?" 
"I’m asking if you stayed in the apartment all day today?" 
"No, I wasn’t here in the morning, I came back in the afternoon." 
"So what were you doing this morning?" 
"..." 
Just as Ou Mucen was about to answer, unexpectedly, a small figure emerged from behind the glass door of the restroom. Upon seeing this, he didn’t know why, but he suddenly "coughed" and said, "The cleaner, go clean the restroom!" 
Ye Ning was about to go to his bedroom when she suddenly heard this. Turning her head back... 
Xiaobao!!! 
Immediately, she threw her broom and dashed over there, "Yes, Third Young Master, I’ll be right there!" 
With one quick step, she pushed the little head that was about to pop out back into the restroom. 
Bai Tingfang didn’t know the secret of the apartment. Seeing the cleaner throw away her broom, her face instantly grew even uglier, "Where did you find such people? Why are they so terrible?" 
Ou Mucen calmly took a sip of water and walked over, "I hired them randomly..." 
"How can you hire randomly? This is your apartment. Can just anyone clean your apartment? Don’t let her come tomorrow! Mom will find you someone else." 
Ou Mucen did not respond... 
However, the young girl sitting next to Bai Tingfang, Ou Mucen’s distant relative’s daughter, looked around and reminded her, "Lady, why haven’t I seen that child?" 
A child? 
Yes, the child! 
Reminded in this way, Bai Tingfang finally remembered and immediately questioned, "I’m asking you, where is the child you were with?" 
"What child?" 
"Don’t play dumb with me. Ou Mufeng has already gone to Blue Mountain Villa. For a child, you hit her daughter and even planned to sell off Ou’s Department Store. Mucen, what exactly are you doing? Who exactly is that child to you? Do you know, by doing this, your father is very angry now?" 
"..." 
A child? 
For a child, he hit the Bai Family’s young miss? And sold off the Bai Family’s major shares in Ou’s Department Store? 
In the restroom, Ye Ning, who had just changed the clothes of the son, was preparing to take the chance to leave when she heard these words, and suddenly, she crouched there immobilized. 
What on earth is going on? Could it be... other serious matters happened during her absence? 
Her eyes stared straight at the child standing in front of her... noveldrama
"Third Young Master, you might as well explain things clearly to the lady. When we came out, the master was throwing a fit at the villa. If you explain, the lady can help you." 
It was the voice of that girl, persuading the man outside. 
Hearing this, Ye Ning finally pushed the glass door open a crack and started to look outside. 
Outside, the atmosphere was indeed tenser than before, but this tension largely stemmed from the women sitting on the sofa, while the man holding the water glass in the living room appeared unchanged. 
"What, they found us this quickly?" 
"What else did you expect?" 
Bai Tingfang glared at her son, "Ou Mufeng is not Ou Muyuan. What she’s best at is egging your father on!" 
"So what?" 
"So now you must hand over that child. We’ll bring him with us to confront your father!"
###Chapter 217: Chapter 217 Is His Mother Sick or What?
Confrontation? 
Ou Mucen stood there as if he had just heard a huge joke, "Why should I confront her? Am I so full that I have nothing else to do?" 
"But if you don’t confront her, your dad will definitely not let you off." 
"Then we’ll just have to try and see. In the end, will it be me, Ou Mucen who dies, or her, Ou Mufeng?" 
"You—" 
Bai Tingfang was truly about to be infuriated to death by this son of hers! 
Indeed, from childhood to adulthood, he had always been the apple of his father’s eye, and she knew he was very capable. However, he was now being too harsh on the Bai Family, she feared that with Ou Mufeng’s tactics and constant whispering in the old man’s ear, it might really be disadvantageous for him in the future. 
However, her son didn’t take it seriously at all. After saying that, he went to his desk and began to immerse himself in his work. 
Seeing this, Bai Tingfang knew that continuing to speak would be futile, so she stood up from the sofa. She came to his side, "Fine, if you won’t go back, then tell your mother, who is that child, really?" noveldrama
The third young master of the Ou Family, who hardly had any friends, spent his time either working at the company or staying in his apartment playing games, when had he ever cared so much about a child? 
Bai Tingfang was very puzzled. 
But upon hearing her question, her son just sat there, slightly lifting his eyelids to glance at her dismissively and said, "A friend’s child, don’t think too much of it." 
"A friend’s child?" 
Bai Tingfang’s eyes widened, "Which friend? Ji Chengzhi? Or the young master of the Zhan Family who owns the railway company?" 
She really knew him well... 
Ou Mucen was beginning to lose his patience, "Alright, Mom, you don’t have to worry about these things. I know my limits. It’s already very late, you should go back and have dinner with Dad. I’ll have someone send you back." 
After speaking, he picked up the phone on the desk, ready to call someone. 
Ye Ning, hiding in the restroom, saw this and immediately breathed a sigh of relief... 
She was finally leaving. If she didn’t, Ye Ning felt she would suffocate in that restroom! 
But her happiness didn’t last three seconds before the woman spoke up unhappily, "Your dad went out for drinks with friends tonight. There’s no one at home to have dinner with me. How about, Mom stays here and eats with you?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Ye Ning, also stunned! 
What was she thinking? Eating here? What to eat? It was clear that this apartment was a place that had never been cooked in, and she wanted to eat here? Was she out of her mind? 
Ou Mucen too thought his mother had water in her brain, so as soon as he snapped back to reality, he flatly refused, "Eat what here at my place? I don’t even cook!" 
Bai Tingfang immediately smiled, "If you won’t do it, I’ll do it for you, don’t worry. Siyu is very good at cooking. In a moment, I’ll have her go downstairs to buy some groceries and rice, and then we can have dinner."
Siyu was the young girl who had come with her. 
Hearing the lady’s words, she immediately stood up, ready to go out for groceries. 
But Ou Mucen gave both of them a cold look and still refused without any courtesy, "If you don’t want to be banned from entering next time, then don’t mess with those random things in my apartment." 
"But..." 
"Alright, Siyu, aren’t you going to take the lady back quickly?" 
The girl hesitated for a long while before finally coming over to Bai Tingfang’s side, "Madam, since it’s like this, let’s go back. The young master likes cleanliness. If we make this place smoky and messy, he definitely won’t like it."
###Chapter 218: Chapter 218 He’s Apologizing to Her
Bai Tingfang stamped her foot and finally, she left the place, reluctantly heading back. 
With the departure of the two, the apartment finally quieted down. Ye Ning, who had been hiding in the restroom, couldn’t stay in there any longer, and came out with her son in tow, "What kind of mother are you? How can you be so troublesome? You even wanted to cook here?!!" 
As soon as he heard this, Ou Mucen, who already had little patience left from the disruption, felt even more uneasy. "What’s wrong with my mom wanting to cook here? Do you have a problem with that?" 
Ye Ning choked! 
She had stepped over the line. 
She hurriedly explained, "No, that’s not what I meant. I just feel... feel that you’re incredibly, incredibly fortunate to have a mom who cares about you so much, Mucen. It really moves me." 
Her tone was servile and her voice exaggerated; it was clear she was buttering him up. 
Ou Mucen felt extreme disgust and turned away, not looking at her anymore and went back to his laptop. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning didn’t dare to disturb him anymore and hurriedly packed up her things, ready to leave. 
However, just as she was about to leave, she suddenly remembered the conversation she had overheard in the restroom. Her eyes sparked with curiosity, and she turned back, "About what your mom said regarding the child, what exactly was that about? Was it Xiaobao? Did something else happen while I was not here?" 
As her words fell, the man sitting at the desk, whose fingers had been tapping on the keyboard, stopped. 
Of course, something had happened, and it was no trivial matter. 
But how could he start to tell her that, while he was in charge of her child, he had nearly let the woman kill him? Or should he say that it had nothing to do with him and only happened because she was not at the hospital and he took her child out, leading to all this? 
In an instant, the man who had never shown any sign of distress amidst the fierce battle of the business world began to struggle... 
"Mom, it’s not Uncle’s fault. It was Xiaobao who ran to the open-air restaurant and met those two bad women," Baozi suddenly spoke up at the crucial moment, offering an explanation. noveldrama
Hearing this, Ye Ning looked immediately at her son, "Bad women? What bad women?" 
Xiaobao lifted his little head proudly, "The woman who was with the bad uncle last time at the estate. She wanted Xiaobao to reveal who my mom is, and to tell her about Uncle’s relationship with my mom. When Xiaobao refused, she was going to punish Xiaobao, but then Uncle arrived. Mom, it really isn’t Uncle’s fault." 
In the end, the child, fearing that his mother would blame Uncle, specifically spoke out in defense of him. 
Listening to this, Ou Mucen looked at the child and finally felt a strong sense of shame. Standing up from the chair, he took steps towards the mother and son.
"It’s Bai Wei. Today I had arranged to meet a client there, and after lunch, it was too late to take him back to the hospital, so I brought him along. I didn’t expect she would be there today. I’m sorry!" 
"..." 
He was not someone accustomed to explaining himself, nor did he easily apologize to others. His prestigious status and high position meant he didn’t deign to or need to explain and apologize to people. 
But now, because of this child, he had explained and even apologized to her...
###Chapter 219: Chapter 219: Exposed!
Ye Ning stared at him blankly, momentarily unable to collect her thoughts. 
It wasn’t until Little Baozi tugged at her clothes that she snapped out of it, hastily waving her hands, "It’s nothing, it’s nothing. If it weren’t for you today, I don’t know what would have happened to Xiaobao in the hospital. I should be the one saying thank you." 
She actually didn’t blame him? 
Ou Mucen’s handsome features looked at her, partly profound, partly inquisitive. 
Being gazed at with such intensity, Ye Ning struggled to hold his stare. Hastily grabbing her son’s hand, she didn’t dare to ask what impact the Bai Family’s sudden appearance would have on him or what kind of disadvantage it could bring to him. Lowering her head, she quickly said, "Then, we’ll be leaving first." 
After speaking, without waiting for his agreement, she took her son’s hand and headed towards the exit. 
However, Xiaobao, pulled by her, turned his little head back to look at the uncle still standing there, "Uncle, can I still come here to keep you company later on?" noveldrama
Company? 
He was actually talking about keeping him company? 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning became even more embarrassed, "Xiaobao, what are you talking about? Why would Uncle need your company?" 
"Why wouldn’t he need my company? I’ve been with him all afternoon today. He’s all alone in the apartment, it’s so desolate. If I’m here with him, then he won’t feel lonely, right Uncle?" 
How could this child say such things? 
And how could this man possibly be lonely or desolate? He chose to live here because he couldn’t stand the noise and scheming of his own home and decided to move here. 
And doesn’t this little rascal understand that the only reason he spent the whole afternoon here with this man was precisely because the uncle was keeping him company? 
Ye Ning was so mortified she wanted to crawl into a hole, "I’m sorry, Third Young Master, he’s still young and doesn’t quite understand..." 
"He’s not wrong. It is indeed quite bleak here," Mucen said. 
"Ah?" 
"Come over on the weekend, and by the way, you can clean up my place a bit." After saying that, he casually glanced at the broom still lying on the floor, then turned and walked to his bedroom without another look at her. 
Ye Ning was flabbergasted! 
What was this about? Agreeing to let her child come over and then asking her to come and clean for free? 
Damn! 
She was just his assistant. Since when did her job include cleaning his apartment too?!! 
Ye Ning felt an urge to wallop her son... 
---- 
Leaving the apartment building, Ye Ning took her son straight out of the complex, preparing to hail a taxi on the roadside. 
But what she hadn’t expected was that the very moment she and Xiaobao emerged from the apartment, two figures stepped out from the shadows of the garden. Upon seeing the mother and son, the slightly taller and fuller-figured one’s eyes glinted with extreme anger and ferocity. 
"Madam, didn’t I say there was something off about that cleaner? Look, that child, he’s hers!" 
"What cleaner? To slap Bai Wei for the sake of a child, do you think that woman is just a cleaner?" 
The woman who had witnessed the scene was shaking with rage, and the look in her eyes was as if she couldn’t wait to tear the other woman apart right then and there. 
Their vantage point had been very clear, so they had seen perfectly well that the child was the same one who had appeared at the Blue Mountain Villa before!
###Chapter 220: Chapter 220 Mom, just admit it, you want to be by Uncle’s side!
Does that mean the child’s origin, which they could never figure out, is actually this woman’s?!! 
The woman was furious, quickly pulled out her phone, and with a face ashen with rage, she threw out a sentence, "Check someone for me immediately, Birkin Apartment, the woman who appeared in the young master’s room today!" 
"..." 
Word by word, that powerful murderous aura, even her young daughter beside her couldn’t help but shiver at the sight. 
The fate of those who offend the matron of the Ou Family is quite miserable. It looks like that mother and son are in more danger than luck... 
---- 
Ye Ning was unaware of all this; after leaving Earl Apartment, she directly took her son back to the hospital in a taxi. 
At the hospital, she found Lin Yebai was still there, waiting for them, so she immediately went over with her son, "Lin Yebai, you haven’t left yet?" 
Lin Yebai had been waiting for several hours. Seeing them finally return, he stood up from his chair, "Not yet, it’s not like I have anything else to do. How is it? Xiaobao is alright, isn’t he?" 
"He’s fine!"
On the way here, Ye Ning had already thoroughly asked her son about what had happened, but now that this man was asking, she didn’t want to worry him and chose not to tell him. 
Relieved to hear that all was well, Lin Yebai walked over and picked up the child standing before him, "Xiaobao, Uncle Lin was wrong today. I shouldn’t have left you alone at the hospital." 
Ye Xiaobao, with his bright and large eyes, looked at him and shook his head, "It’s okay. Uncle took Mommy to look for a new job, Xiaobao won’t be angry." 
"That’s good!" Lin Yebai patted his round little head and put him down. 
After confirming that the mother and son were fine, he left before long. 
Ye Ning wanted to talk to him about going back to work for the Ou Family, but when the words reached her lips, she couldn’t find the right excuse and hesitated for a moment before choosing to stay silent for the time being. 
Returning to the Ou Family so suddenly, he would probably be unhappy, especially since resigning was his suggestion. 
Ye Ning felt a little irritable! 
"Mommy, are you worried that Uncle Lin would be displeased if you go back to work for his company?" 
Ye Ning looked up at her son, who had peeled off his clothes, "Hmm, what do you think Mommy should do?" noveldrama
After being intellectually crushed countless times, Ye Ning had already gotten used to consulting her son on some matters. 
But upon hearing her question, Little Baozi’s small brows furrowed deeply, "I think it’s better for Mommy to be direct with Uncle Lin. Although Uncle Lin might be a bit angry on the spot, if Mommy insists, he will definitely compromise." 
"Really?" 
"Yeah, Mommy, Uncle Lin just cares about us, but he can’t decide what you want to do, right?" 
The last sentence was impressive, if she didn’t know this was her own son, Ye Ning would not believe that a child could say such a thing. 
Yes, Lin Yebai could only offer concern, the real decision maker was still her, Ye Ning. 
Ye Ning, who was successfully enlightened, felt much better. However, when she looked at Baozi again, suddenly, she felt a bit uncomfortable, "It seems like you really want me to work for the Ou Family, tell me, do you have a guilty conscience?" 
Ye Xiaobao looked innocent, "What could I be guilty of? It’s clearly you who want to go back." 
"What did you say?" 
"Oh Mommy, just admit it. That Uncle isn’t bad, apart from having a foul temper, a poisonous tongue, and some bad habits, I think he’s quite good!"
###Chapter 221: Chapter 221: She’s Actually Worried About Him
"Ye Xiaobao!!" 
Ye Ning felt like she was about to be driven insane by her son. Just after meeting that man three times, he had already become his underling. What kind of love potion or bewitching drug had he given him to make him speak so favorably on his behalf? 
Ye Ning began to think it was necessary to reduce their encounters. 
After taking a bath, mother and son finally went to bed. Just before falling asleep, Ye Ning hugged the little bundle and asked, "Baby, you said that uncle slapped that bad woman to save you today, didn’t you?" 
Ye Xiaobao’s fluffy little head burrowed into her embrace: "Mhm, she even bled, and then uncle had someone drag her away." 
Lying there, Ye Ning suddenly felt a surge of complexity in her heart... 
The relationship between the Bai Family and the Ou Family was really not just average; with Ou Mufeng as their only daughter, once she got married, the old master of the Ou Family was exceptionally good to the Bai Family members. 
Especially after Bai Wei was born, it became even more so, almost as if she grew up by his side. 
But now, for the sake of this child, not only did he make Bai Wei bleed, but he also sold off the shares of the Ou’s department store held by the Bai Family. By doing so, would the old master of the Ou Family really let him off? Would he be all right? 
Ye Ning found herself starting to worry, and this anxiety prevented her from getting a good night’s sleep. 
The next morning, Lin Yebai indeed arrived very early. Seeing Ye Ning with dark circles under her eyes, he was somewhat surprised, "What happened? Didn’t you sleep well last night?" 
Ye Ning quickly lowered her head to hide her expression: "I’m just not used to the bed, it’s okay, I’ll be fine after resting back home." 
Seeing that, Lin Yebai didn’t say anything more. As soon as it was past eight o’clock, he went to handle the discharge procedures. 
Ye Ning saw him going to take care of the discharge procedures and began to pack up their belongings to prepare to go home. However, what she did not expect was that when Lin Yebai went to settle the bill downstairs, he discovered that the bill had already been taken care of. 
"This is..." 
"Mr. Lin, this bill was charged under our Third Young Master’s account. The Third Young Master is a shareholder of this hospital. According to regulations, he is eligible for a full exemption, so Mr. Lin doesn’t need to pay any fees." 
As if seeing through his confusion, the billing clerk explained the reason with a smile. 
Upon hearing this, the man holding the bill clenched his hand, and the slip of paper was crumpled tightly in his palm. 
Ye Ning was still waiting upstairs. Seeing that he had not returned for a long time, she decided to go down and check: "Xiaobao, wait here for Mommy, I’m going to see if Uncle Lin is done." 
Ye Xiaobao nodded obediently: "Okay!" noveldrama
Pleased by his response, Ye Ning left the ward and headed for the billing hall on the first floor to find Lin Yebai. However, just as she reached the nurse’s station, she saw the hospital director hurrying over. 
"Director Ji?" 
... 
Ji Chengzhi stopped and after a moment, he finally remembered who the woman calling him was.
"Oh, it’s you. You’re being discharged today?" 
"Yes, discharging today!" 
"Perfect, come to my office to get some medicine for Mucen. When you go to work later, can you deliver it to him?" After saying this, he walked briskly in the direction of his office. 
Ye Ning was somewhat bewildered, but after seeing him leave, she still followed: "Director, why does Third Young Master need medicine? Is he sick?"
###Chapter 222: Chapter 222: Miss An, if you want your child to be safe, it’s best to stay away from Mucen!
Ji Chengzhi shook his head, "No, just some anti-allergy medication. His obsession with cleanliness has become rather pathological, he needs treatment!" 
So that was it! 
Upon understanding, Ye Ning accepted the medicine bottle he handed to her from the drawer gladly. 
As she took it and was about to leave, the young dean behind her added another sentence, "By the way, I heard yesterday that guy spanked his niece for a child. His sister is making a scene right now. That child, could it be yours?" 
Ye Ning was startled upon hearing this! noveldrama
How could he know these things? Could it be that his relationship with that man was far from ordinary? 
Ye Ning didn’t know that the man before her was one of the few friends Ou Mucen played with back in the day. Back then, she was too distant from that man. He was like the sun high above, while she was like the humble dust on the ground. 
When she heard the dean suddenly bring this up, she was stunned for a good while before she reacted, "You’re the third young master’s friend?" 
Ji Chengzhi nodded, "Yes, we’ve been playing together since we were kids." 
So it was true! 
Finally understanding, Ye Ning hesitated for a moment before admitting, "Yes, I went out yesterday, and then my child, not knowing any better, phoned him to come over, which led to this incident." 
Phoned him to come over? 
Ji Chengzhi, leaning on his own desk, found this statement as unbelievable as a fanciful tale, "Are you saying that your child called Mucen, and then he just came over?" 
Ye Ning nodded, "My child said so, indeed." 
Ji Chengzhi was dumbfounded! 
This was too miraculous. Who on earth was that child? And he was so obedient? 
Ji Chengzhi stared at this woman, and for the first time, he began to look her over carefully... 
Frankly speaking, she really wasn’t a woman of striking appearance, at most she could be considered pretty and charming. Compared with the high-profile ladies and film stars in their circles, she really wasn’t on the same level. 
But there was something very special about this woman, and that was her elegance, a kind of subtlety completely out of place in this bustling world, like a chrysanthemum or orchid. It was as if a stream had suddenly appeared among the splendid flowers, attracting attention with its mere presence. 
But what of it? No matter how attractive she may be, she was already a mother to a child. 
Ji Chengzhi’s narrow eyes slightly squinted, "Miss An, I don’t know what your relationship is with Mucen, but I advise you, if you want your child to be safe, it’s best to keep a distance from him." 
Ye Ning was taken aback, "Dean, what do you mean by that?" 
Ji Chengzhi gave a cold smile, "Don’t you understand, Miss An? Mucen’s world is far more complicated and dangerous than you imagine. Don’t think that just because he spanked his niece for your child yesterday, you can gloat. I’m telling you, neither the Bai family nor the Ou family will let you and your son off the hook!" 
Ye Ning’s complexion changed! 
What was he saying? What did he mean by not gloating over the fact that he had helped her child by spanking his niece? Was he warning her or humiliating her? 
Ye Ning’s eyes began to turn cold, "Dean Ji, are you perhaps overthinking things?" 
"What do you mean?" 
"Isn’t that the case? I’m just a new assistant at the Ou company. Why would Dean Ji think so highly of me? To think I could climb up the ladder as high as the President of Ou? Aren’t you giving me too much credit?" 
"I—" 
Ji Chengzhi was suddenly rendered speechless by her
###Chapter 223: Chapter 223: Ou Mucen, I’ve Seen Ou Yuze’s People in Ningzhou
He did indeed mean just that, however, he hadn’t expected her to see through it so quickly. 
Ji Chengzhi’s face showed he was having difficulty saving face, "When I say this, I’m reminding you, it’s for your own good." 
"Well, thank you for that, but I can handle my own affairs and don’t need Dean Ji’s concern." Having said that, Ye Ning didn’t even take the medicine, she turned around and left the place.
Ji Chengzhi was left standing there, both angry and infuriated for a long time, before he finally picked up the phone and dialed a number. 
"Hello?" 
"Where on earth do you find these women? Why are they so ungrateful?" 
As soon as the other party picked up the call, he started complaining discontentedly. 
A woman? 
What woman? 
The person on the other end frowned slightly upon hearing this outburst like a shrew, "What are you talking about? Don’t you know I’m very busy right now?" 
Busy? 
It would have been better not to mention it, but as soon as he did, the man holding the phone on this end became even more irritated, "You make it sound like I have all the time in the world. I’m asking you, did your mom see something?" 
"What do you mean?" 
"What do I mean? She called me last night, asking if I knew about your little assistant? And that child!!!" 
"..." 
The line went silent, as if all sound had suddenly stopped. 
Hearing that, Ji Chengzhi couldn’t help being more sarcastic, "There’s a problem, isn’t there? Just now, I kindly advised that woman to stay away from you, but she didn’t listen and even scolded me for meddling. Why am I so foolish?" 
"..." 
Continued silence! 
However, this time, there was a sound of porcelain clashing from the phone, and upon hearing it, he quieted down as well. 
"What did you say to her?" 
What did I say? 
Ji Chengzhi blurted out, "Of course, I told her to stop clinging to you..." 
"You’re sick!" 
With those harsh words, the person was about to hang up the phone. 
Ji Chengzhi hurriedly said on this end, "What do you mean, Ou Mucen? I’m doing this for your good, aren’t you aware of your mother’s nature? If she learns about the existence of this mother and child, do you think they’ll have a good outcome?" 
"So what?" 
"So you should break it off with her as soon as possible!" 
"..." 
That last sentence, Ji Chengzhi swore, he had spoken out of urgency, but by the time he realized what he had said, it was already too late. 
"That... Mucen, what I mean is..." 
"Have you been too idle lately?" 
"No! Absolutely not!" Ji Chengzhi’s head shook like a rattle-drum. 
He was joking, how could he be idle? He was so busy every day that he didn’t even have time to get his medication, not to mention the last time he went to Ningzhou for the academic conference, it was his assistant who went on his behalf. 
That’s right, Ningzhou! 
Ji Chengzhi suddenly recalled something, "That’s right, Mucen, the last time my assistant went to Ningzhou, he said he saw Ou Yuze’s assistant Xiaohe there." 
"Ningzhou?" 
"Yes, a remote city in the northwest. We went there for the academic meeting only because there was an old Chinese medicine practitioner, otherwise, we wouldn’t have visited such a backward place." 
Worried that he might not know the place, Ji Chengzhi explained it in more detail. 
Ningzhou... 
Upon hearing this name, the man on the other end of the line began to fall into contemplation. 
Ningzhou, had he heard of it somewhere? 
Right at that moment, Secretary Gao opened the door, saw the president sitting there in deep thought, and approached him with a call, "Third Young Master..." 
Ou Mucen looked up and seeing it was him, suddenly, his eyes brightened, "Do you know about Ningzhou?"noveldrama
###Chapter 224: Chapter 224: Do you still remember the adopted daughter from back then?
Ningzhou? 
Secretary Gao was also stumped by this rarely heard place name, but, as a secretary, his most basic skill was his memory. 
So, after a brief moment of thought, he quickly came up with an answer, "Yes, I know it. It’s a second- or third-tier city in the northwest, not very developed. What’s wrong with Young Master Ou? Why the sudden interest? Is the Ou Family planning to invest there?" 
Ou Mucen shook his head, "Just now, Ji Chengzhi told me that Ou Yuze has been spotted there." 
Ou Yuze? 
Secretary Gao’s eyes finally flickered, "I remember now, the foster daughter of the Ou Family’s second branch was sentenced to prison there!" 
"Foster daughter?" 
"Yes, has Young Master Ou forgotten? Five years ago, Longfeng was suspected of a high-profile Original Jade Stone fraud case. Upon investigation, it was found to be perpetrated by that foster daughter. At that time, the lawyers even sent you an email." 
Secretary Gao said this, fearing his master wouldn’t remember, so he added another sentence. 
Foster daughter? Original Jade Stone? 
Ou Mucen finally remembered, and the events from that time began to emerge in his mind. 
Yes, he had just happened to be passing by in a car when the court’s judgment was announced, and then there was a loud bang inside. At first, the secretary thought it was an explosion, only later did he learn from the news that the foster daughter had tried to commit suicide out of fear of her crimes upon hearing her sentence, and it was only because armed police had wrestled the gun away from her that she had not lost her life. 
So, she is now in Ningzhou... 
Ou Mucen sat there, recalling the faint figure he remembered from the Blue Mountain Villa all those years. 
Frankly speaking, he still couldn’t remember what she looked like because the countless schemes and traps from that branch of the family had left him with nothing but disgust and resentment towards that brother and sister-in-law. 
Thus, he wouldn’t bother to look at anyone from that side of the family, nor did he care to. 
He just remembered a frail and weak figure who always appeared behind Mei Liping, with her head bowed and eyes downcast as if she listened to every word Mei had to say, so inconspicuous she could be entirely ignored. 
If there had to be a deeply ingrained memory, it was when the Chen Family’s young miss came to see him, was ruthlessly rejected outside, and left in tears, only to run into her, who, by some chance, also happened to be there. However, it was the look she gave when she lifted her head. 
The night was dark, and he couldn’t see her expression clearly, but standing by the window, he could vaguely sense the dissatisfaction, anger, and disgust in her eyes. 
Heh, a mere foster daughter daring to feel anger and disgust towards him! 
He opened the email that Secretary Gao had found from five years ago and then, on the computer, he saw the court judgment. 
And the photo on that judgment! 
"Young Master Ou, actually, there were many doubtful points about this case. The foster daughter was only nineteen years old when she was sentenced. How could a nineteen-year-old girl, without any extraordinary abilities, possibly commit a fraud involving that highly priced Original Jade Stone?" 
... noveldrama
No one paid attention to him. The only response was from the man who was continuously staring at the screen at the desk. 
What was Young Master Ou doing? 
Secretary Gao was confused, walked over, and saw that he was intently gazing at the photo on the judgment. A flicker of confusion crossed his eyes, "Young Master Ou, what’s wrong? Why are you staring at her photo?"
###Chapter 225: Chapter 225 Go to Ningzhou to see this Ye Ning
Yes, the photograph of this adopted daughter reveals that she is very beautiful, with outstanding features and a dignified, elegant demeanor. What’s key is that she’s bare-faced, without any added Photoshop enhancements. One can only imagine how breath-taking and dazzling she would be in person. 
But, no matter how beautiful, you can’t just stare at her photo like that. She’s a convict now. 
Secretary Gao didn’t quite understand the president’s behavior! 
"Third Young Master..." noveldrama
"Get out!" 
"Ah?" 
"Didn’t you hear me tell you to get out?" Suddenly, this man became angry. 
Upon hearing this, Secretary Gao had no choice but to rush out... 
What’s with the president? Why is he losing his temper so early in the morning? Is there something wrong again? 
Secretary Gao left with a belly full of complaints, but what he didn’t know was that after he left and closed the door of the office, the man sitting at the desk suddenly took a ruler from the pen holder and covered up the bottom half of the woman’s face on the computer screen. 
Afterward, his other hand blocked off the forehead portion as well. 
At that moment, the only thing left visible in the photo were her eyes. And those eyes, glazed over—dark from a distance, yet upon closer inspection one would find her pupils akin to an oasis in the desert, brimming and fluid, sparkling and translucent, strikingly similar to a pair he had been frequently seeing lately! 
Ou Mucen was momentarily frozen, his eyes revealing rare astonishment. 
How is this possible? 
Sitting there, he remained in shock for quite some time before regaining his composure. He then let go and quickly picked up the phone on the desk, "Hello, make a call to Ningzhou Prison and inquire about the current situation of that adopted daughter." 
The adopted daughter? 
Secretary Gao nodded on the other end, "Okay, what’s her name?" 
He had left so quickly earlier that he forgot to check what her name was. 
Similarly, the man on this end had to glance at the screen again upon hearing the question, "Ye Ning..." 
Ye Ning, so her name is Ye Ning. After all these years, he had never known her name. 
Secretary Gao was highly efficient. It wasn’t long before he came in to report the findings, "Third Young Master, I just asked. Ningzhou Prison says that Ye Ning has been serving her sentence and performing exceptionally well." 
"Is that so?" 
Upon hearing this, the man who had been sitting still frowned but showed no surprise. Instead, he seemed puzzled.
She’s still serving her sentence? 
He sat there in thought, fiddling with the pen in his hand idly. 
Secretary Gao didn’t know what he was pondering and was afraid to ask for fear of angering him, so he could only wait carefully until the man finally spoke again after another five minutes, "What about that matter I asked you to investigate about An Ning? How’s it going?" 
An Ning? 
Why had the president’s thoughts jumped so abruptly? He was just discussing the adopted daughter from the secondary branch, and now all of a sudden it’s about his assistant? 
Secretary Gao was a bit confused, "Not yet, but we’ve sent someone to the address on her ID card, and they’re currently inquiring." 
Ou Mucen furrowed his brow, "Hold off on that for now. You go to Ningzhou personally, and first, take a look at this Ye Ning." 
Ah? Go to Ningzhou first? 
Secretary Gao was becoming even more perplexed, "What does Third Young Master mean by...?"
###Chapter 226: Chapter 226 He Finally Started to Doubt!
"Go get a sample of her blood, and remember, don’t let anyone notice, especially Ou Yuze’s people." 
"..." 
Blood? 
Secretary Gao was a bit stunned by what BOSS had said! 
Out of the blue, why get a sample of her blood? What was Third Young Master planning to do? 
However, since he had said it, Gao didn’t dare to ask any questions, so he nodded and agreed before going out to make arrangements. noveldrama
And what about the man still sitting in the office? 
After Gao left, the man, while looking at the verdict on the computer, took out a pack of cigarettes, lit one up, and then began to open the next page. It was on that page that he saw a line of information. 
Nanfu Orphanage? 
He stared at the page and took a deep drag from the cigarette in his hand. As he exhaled the smoke, he leaned back in his chair, and without much thought, picked up the phone on the desk, "Hello, is this the Civil Affairs Bureau? This is Ou Mucen calling!" 
"Hello, hello, Third Young Master Ou, how may I assist you?" 
"I need you to help me check if, ten years ago, there was an orphan named Ye Ning at Nanfu Orphanage who was adopted by our Ou Family. I would like to obtain all her information, including her blood sample." 
He paused here. 
Upon hearing this, a suffocating pressure immediately made the person on the other end break into a cold sweat, which rolled down their forehead. 
"Third Young Master..." 
"Also, I don’t want anyone to know about this!" 
"Yes, yes, Third Young Master, I definitely won’t let this slip," the head of the Civil Affairs Bureau practically kowtowed over the phone. 
Are you kidding? This was Third Young Master Ou. If he blabbered about the matter, would he even value his life? 
The head of the Civil Affairs Bureau immediately personally attended to this matter. However, while doing so, they were still a bit puzzled. 
The Third Young Master of the Ou Family, why, out of the blue, would he inquire about this daughter who was once adopted by his brother? Could it be... he was still suspicious about the case from five years ago? 
—— 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, completely unaware that her identity had sparked someone’s suspicion, had taken Ye Xiaobao from the hospital. After settling back into the new apartment Lin Yebai had rented for her and arranging for the child, that very night, she told Lin Yebai that she still wished to work at Ou Corporation. 
Lin Yebai wasn’t surprised. In fact, he had anticipated this when she went to find Ye Xiaobao, so he simply cautioned her to be careful and said nothing more. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning heaved a sigh of relief and assured him she would be wary. After chatting for a bit longer, Lin Yebai left. 
"Keep this car. It’ll be convenient for going to work and for picking up and dropping off the child," Lin Yebai said, leaving his Audi with her as he was leaving. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning was, of course, immensely grateful, but also felt very guilty, "Lin, I’ve been such a bother to you, I really don’t know how to express my thanks." 
Lin Yebai shook his head, "It’s all voluntary on my part, it has nothing to do with you. But, I’ve heard some unsettling news, Ou Yuze’s people have gone to Ningzhou, and I have no clue what they’re up to. If you’re still at Ou Corporation, you must be careful!" 
Ou Yuze sent people to Ningzhou? 
Heavens! 
Ye Ning turned pale at the words, "Why would he go to Ningzhou? I haven’t even had direct contact with him since I came back?"
###Chapter 227: Chapter 227 He Actually Doesn’t Like It When She’s Filled with Hatred
Lin Yebai hurriedly reassured her, "Don’t panic, he probably didn’t find out, because the people in the prison told me that after that person arrived, he just took some things and visited her briefly, then left." 
A visit? 
That’s right, she is still his sister in name, after all. 
Ye Ning stood there, cold laughter escaped her: "I thought they had completely forgotten about me by now, but it turns out they still remember me. No, they must remember my eyes, right? As long as they are sure I’m in prison, they can rest easy." 
Lin Yebai stood there, his brow slightly furrowed. 
To be honest, he did not like this side of her, a bit ferocious, somewhat sharp, as if she had become a completely different person. 
Not saying anything else, he gave her a few more reminders, then left... 
In fact, she didn’t need to worry at all; the arrangements in Ningzhou were made by Lin Yebai himself. Even if that person died, the secret would not be exposed. 
So, on this matter, he was still quite confident. The only thing he was not sure about was another man, the one who took Xiaobao away for the whole day yesterday. 
"Hello? This is Lin Yebai, the matter I asked you to check yesterday, did you find anything out?" 
"I found out, Mr. Lin. After Ou Mucen took away your godson from the hospital, he first went to a café to eat, and then to the Qianshui Bay Hotel." 
"Qianshui Bay Hotel?" 
The man holding the phone sat in a taxi, pausing when he heard the place: "What was he doing there?" noveldrama
The person on the phone shook their head, "That I don’t know, but nothing happened there, and then he left the hotel with the child and returned to the apartment." 
The person on the phone didn’t realize how formidable the power of the Ou family was; not to mention the incident that occurred at the Qianshui Bay Hotel yesterday, not even the staff of the hotel would know anything about it anymore. 
This was the ability of Ou Mucen! 
Sitting in the car, Lin Yebai sighed with relief upon hearing this, but then, as he processed what the person had said next, his expression turned very unsightly, and the fingers clutching the phone began to whiten slightly. 
The apartment? 
So, did she go to his apartment to pick up the child yesterday? 
She actually... went to his apartment? 
And stayed for such a long time? 
The fingers of the man in the car, holding the phone, whitened slightly... 
---- 
The next day, Ye Ning got up very early because she had to take Ye Xiaobao to a new preschool. She deliberately rose early, and after making breakfast, which both mother and son ate, they held hands and went downstairs together. 
"Mom, I’ll tell you, the new preschool is so pretty, much nicer than the old one." 
"Really? Then Mommy will have to take a good look when we get there." 
The moment he got in the car, the little tyke began excitedly telling Ye Ning about it, his face full of excitement, as if he couldn’t wait to go to the preschool right then and there. 
Ye Ning felt very reassured, previously, she had thought that the child might have a hard time adjusting to suddenly changing preschools, but now it seemed that such worry was completely unnecessary. 
After taking the child to the preschool, it really was, as he said, the environment of the preschool was excellent, and the teachers and principal, perhaps because Lin Yebai had already spoken to them, were extremely warm and caring when they saw them arrive.
###Chapter 228: Chapter 228: Call her early in the morning to pick him up
Ye Ning felt at ease after seeing that, so after taking the child to kindergarten, she returned to the car and began to prepare for her journey to work. 
However, just as she started the car, her cell phone rang with an incoming call... 
Second-generation rich heir?! 
God! 
Her heart nearly skipped a beat at the sight of the caller ID, almost causing her to toss the phone onto the ground. 
What kind of trick was this bastard pulling, calling her so early in the morning? Was there another issue? 
Ye Ning, who had been tormented by this person at the company recently, reflexively resisted answering the call as soon as she saw the caller ID. 
But the phone kept ringing, as if it wouldn’t give up until she answered. Reluctantly, she finally picked it up and pressed the answer button, "Third Young Master, hehe, good morning..." 
"Do you even realize it’s me? Why did it take you so long to answer?" The voice on the phone was already unpleasant right from the start. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning quickly explained, "No, no, I just didn’t hear it. How could I dare not answer the Third Young Master’s call? Do you need me for something?" 
"What are you doing?" 
"Driving!" 
"Driving? Whose car?" 
Whose car? What business is it of yours? noveldrama
Ye Ning really wanted to retort, but remembering that today was her first day back at the Ou family’s company, she didn’t dare to be too presumptuous, so she answered honestly, "My master’s car. He knew I had a hard time commuting to work, so he let me use his car." 
There was silence on the phone, an eerie pause that was unsettling! 
Ye Ning swallowed nervously. 
She hadn’t said something wrong again, had she? The atmosphere was so oppressively tense... 
Just as she thought he was about to hang up, suddenly, that cold voice threw a sentence at her, "Be at Blue Mountain Villa to pick me up within twenty minutes." 
What? 
Ye Ning didn’t quite understand, "Third Young Master, this..." 
"Beep beep beep beep..." 
The line was dead; there was nothing but a busy tone from the phone. 
What was he doing? Was he out of his mind? Why, out of the blue, did he ask her to pick him up at Blue Mountain Villa? What about Secretary Gao? Wasn’t he always the one to pick him up? Why was it her turn today? 
Ye Ning was frantic, truly having a near-uncontrollable urge to beat up that bastard. 
It wasn’t that she didn’t want to go; as his assistant, it was reasonable for her to pick him up. But she had just seen his mother yesterday in the guise of a "cleaner," and now she was supposed to pick up her son from his doorstep? What if they ran into each other? 
No, she couldn’t go; she had to find Secretary Gao! 
She struggled for a moment in the car and ultimately decided to flip open her phone to look for Secretary Gao’s number and dialed it. 
Almost a minute later, Secretary Gao answered, "Hello, An Ning, I’m on the high-speed train, and the signal isn’t great. Can I call you back when I get off the train?" 
Damn it! 
Why was Secretary Gao on a high-speed train? 
Holding her phone, Ye Ning finally realized why that bastard had called her this early and why he asked her to pick him up. 
It was all because Secretary Gao was out... 
Well, since he wasn’t around, it might as well be her who went to pick him up. Upon arriving, she just needed to make sure not to go inside. 
With this thought, Ye Ning had no choice but to start the car resignedly and head towards Blue Mountain Villa at Qianshui Bay. 
After changing residences, the distance from where she was to Qianshui Bay had shortened significantly. In just over twenty minutes, she once again caught sight of the upscale seaside villa community, and Blue Mountain Villa soon appeared before her eyes.
###Chapter 229: Chapter 229 Turbulent Undercurrents
Front gate! 
She remembered the location he had mentioned on the phone, so after she arrived at the estate, she parked her car by the road at the front gate and then took out her mobile phone to dial the "spoiled heir’s" number. 
"Hello, Third Young Master, I’ve arrived." 
"Come in." 
Huh? 
Go in? 
Ye Ning began to doubt her own ears, "Are you asking me to come in?" 
Ou Mucen responded indifferently with a "Mhm" from the other end of the line, "I’ve already notified the security guard at the entrance, you can come straight in." After saying that, he hung up the phone without waiting for her response. 
Left sitting in her car, Ye Ning stared at her phone in her hand, dumbfounded once again. 
What on earth was he up to? 
Did he not realize the situation she was in? Was he trying to play her to death by doing this? Was he still holding a grudge against her for quitting her job with him two days ago to work for another company? 
As these thoughts crossed Ye Ning’s mind, she felt increasingly uncomfortable. Thinking about his ruthless mother and then herself, finally, she gritted her teeth, deciding to leave and not bother about it anymore. 
However, just as she was about to leave, the carved gates suddenly opened, "Hey, are you the Third Young Master’s assistant? The Third Young Master has asked for you to come in!" 
It turned out to be a security guard from the estate. 
Upon seeing this, Ye Ning could only stop the car again, "Yes, that’s me." 
"Well, you better hurry up. When Secretary Gao used to come, she would have been inside by now. Why are you dawdling?" The security guard said while urging her on. 
Secretary Gao used to come and pick him up and had to go in as well? noveldrama
Ye Ning was stunned for a moment and looked at the security guard... 
"What are you still looking at? Aren’t you going in? How can a new assistant be so poor at their job?" 
"Ah... okay, I’ll go in now!" 
Ye Ning finally agreed and then drove the car into the parking lot, pulled out the keys, and got out of the car. 
If Secretary Gao always did this when she came to pick him up, then apparently, this was something his secretary had to do when coming to fetch him; maybe he had something inside that he needed his secretary to bring out for him. 
Or maybe, she was asked to come over today because his mother was not present, since the night before last, when she asked him not to let his mother find out about their mother-son relationship, he complied. 
Thinking this way, Ye Ning felt somewhat less uncomfortable. She got out of the car and went straight over, "Sorry, I’m new here and not very familiar with things, thank you for your help." 
The security guard looked at her with disdain, "You don’t need to tell me you’re new, if it were Secretary Gao, she’d have already gone in and fetched the Third Young Master by now." 
Ye Ning quickly apologized with a smile, expressing her thanks, and then the guard reluctantly led her inside. 
After leading her inside, the guard didn’t tell Ye Ning where to go and returned to his post. 
So there Ye Ning stood, looking around the familiar courtyard, her gaze directed toward the four directions that were devoid of any human presence, and she walked straight toward Orchid Garden. 
She had been to Orchid Garden before, and going there directly now, she believed he wouldn’t suspect anything. 
But what she didn’t know was that as soon as she set foot on that path, the guard who had just led her in picked up his phone, "Third Young Master, the assistant has headed toward your garden." 
His garden? 
The person on the phone sounded displeased once he heard this, "Who told her to go to Orchid Garden? Tell her, I’m in Bamboo Garden!" 
Bamboo Garden? 
Wasn’t that where the old master and madam lived? 
The guard understood and promptly nodded, "Alright, should I take her there?" 
"No need, let her come by herself!" 
Indeed, let her come by herself, because if she belonged to this estate, she would definitely be able to find it.
###Chapter 230: Chapter 230: The Outcome of the Matter is Somewhat Unexpected
The security guard understood and after making an internal call, the person was waiting on the side of Orchid Garden. 
Ye Ning still didn’t know about this and as she followed the path to the back of Orchid Garden, she naturally went to ring the doorbell upon seeing that familiar courtyard. 
But just at that moment, a servant who was pruning a bonsai in the garden looked over at her, "Are you looking for the Third Young Master? He’s not here!" 
Not here? noveldrama
Ye Ning turned around in surprise, "Then where is he?" 
"In Bamboo Garden, having breakfast with the old master," the servant casually replied before bending down to her task again. 
Ye Ning was stunned for a moment before she finally snapped back to reality... 
Bamboo Garden? 
He was actually having breakfast in Bamboo Garden? Wasn’t that where his parents lived? Why would he be there? 
Instantly, her heart which had just calmed down surged like a tide, and her hands began to tremble slightly. 
She didn’t understand what he meant, but one thing was clear to her: if she went over now and ran into his mother in Bamboo Garden, her identity would certainly be revealed, and then her fate was beyond words. 
Why was he doing this? 
Could it be that he truly wanted to push her to a dead end? 
As the thought settled, her heart suddenly felt as if it was being pricked from the inside, experiencing a great discomfort. 
"Why are you still not leaving? The Third Young Master isn’t here." 
"..." 
She looked up at the servant urging her on, and suddenly as if she’d lost all interest, turned around and walked back the way she had come. 
The servant was taken aback, "Where are you going?" 
There was a shortcut from here to Bamboo Garden. By not taking the shortcut and going back, what did she mean? 
The servant who had been assigned to watch her saw her walk away without turning back and finally got anxious. She put down her shears and chased after her, "Where are you going? Aren’t you supposed to meet the Third Young Master?" 
Ye Ning stopped, faced the servant blocking her path and was just about to tell her she wasn’t going to meet him, that he could do whatever he wanted when suddenly her phone rang. 
A rich and willful heir? 
As she saw the caller ID, she grew even angrier, and without thinking, she answered, "What exactly do you want?" 
"What?" 
"Isn’t that so? You knew your mother had already seen me, yet you told me to go to where your mother lives to find you. Do you really wish for your mother to see me? Or are you eager to tell her right away using this method? That I was the cleaner from that day, and also the mother of the child she’s looking for?" 
Once she started, it was like lighting the fuse inside her, and she passionately accused him over the phone, carrying her complete anger as well as her grievance. 
And at that moment, it seemed she’d forgotten that he was merely her boss, and she was just his newly hired assistant of less than a month! 
There was no sound from the phone, apparently, the person on the other end had not expected things to turn out this way either. 
Intentionally? 
Indeed, he had asked her to come today on purpose, but not for the reason she was suggesting; rather, it was for something else. 
The man who had hung up the phone looked a little grim as he saw his parents, who were sitting with him for breakfast, smiling. His gaze shifted emotionlessly to his mother sitting to his left. 
"Mom, I heard you’ve been investigating that child?"
###Chapter 231: Chapter 231: Remember, Don’t Touch Her or Her Child Again!
Tingfang, who was happily chatting with her husband, changed color instantly upon hearing these words, "Mucen, Mommy..." 
"You don’t need to investigate any further. That child, shall I tell you who he really is?" 
"What?" 
Tingfang was so startled by these words that the spoon she was using to eat porridge hung suspended in mid-air. 
He was going to tell her, but why? Hadn’t he refused to say anything before? Why had he suddenly decided to come forward and tell her? 
Tingfang had a bad premonition! 
Similarly, due to the matters concerning the Bai Family, even Ou’s old master, who still had issues with this son, was surprised to hear this, "Are you saying, you’re going to tell us who that child really is?" 
Ou Mucen nodded expressionlessly, "Yes, his name is Ye Xiaobao, he’s the child of my newly hired assistant." 
"Assistant?" 
"Yes, she’s the woman I mentioned before with a natural talent for jade appraisal. That child is hers!" 
"..." 
As this statement was made, not only was Ou’s old master stunned, but even Tingfang widened her eyes, looking incredulously at her own son, "Your assistant’s child? Didn’t you say the child’s parents were your friends?" 
Ou Mucen scoffed coldly, "If I hadn’t said ’friends’, would you have given up investigating his identity, Mom?" 
Tingfang was at a loss for words! 
No, she wouldn’t have, even if they were friends, she was already investigating. However, she hadn’t expected that before she could find out the identity of that woman, he himself would reveal who she was. 
So, that means the woman in his apartment the day before wasn’t his cleaner all along but his assistant? 
Tingfang realized the truth and immediately, her face turned very ugly, "So you’re saying, the woman in your apartment that day wasn’t really a cleaner?" 
Ou Mucen swept her with an expressionless glance, "No one told you she was a cleaner!" 
"You—" 
"Also, this matter ends here. I don’t want you to cause any trouble for her or her son; otherwise, don’t blame me for turning against you!" Having finished speaking, he didn’t look at her again, stood up, took his coat, and left. 
Tingfang, sitting across from him, experienced a flushed and then pale face, barely stopping herself from jumping up. 
"Master, you see, what kind of son is this, he even dares to threaten me, to threaten me over an unrelated mother and child?!" 
"Since you know they are unrelated, why are you interfering with them?" 
Ou’s old master blocked her with an unsparing retort. noveldrama
Tingfang fell silent upon hearing this... 
Indeed, what had the mother and son done to her child? Why should she trouble them? Even if Mucen had hit Bai Wei because of that child, it was also because that child had helped him back at the estate. 
Once Ou’s old master understood the situation, the anger he had before dissipated completely. He instructed the butler, who was standing by, to summon Ou Mufeng, who was still waiting at the estate for his explanation, before he himself got up and walked towards the Bamboo Garden. 
Tingfang watched from the side. Although she had no words to say outwardly, inside her heart was even more uncomfortable, as both her son and husband had spoken up for the unrelated mother and son, warning her, blocking her. 
"Xiaoxia..." 
"Yes, Madam!" 
"Do you know about the assistant my son just mentioned?" 
Xiaoxia hurriedly nodded, "I haven’t met her, but I know of her. I’ve heard she has some skill in gem appraisal."
###Chapter 232: Chapter 232: Five Years Later, She Still Hasn’t Learned Her Lesson
The woman, faced with a vista of frost, lifted her head, "Really? Then who exactly is she?" 
Xiaoxia shook her head, "That I don’t know. You’re aware, ma’am, we are not allowed to inquire into the young master’s company affairs." 
Not allowed to inquire?
Then, she would personally make a trip to the company. She wanted to see for herself the woman who once played a cleaner in front of her, what kind of face she was putting on while sitting in her son’s office! 
Seated at the dining table, her hand clenched, and the chopsticks immediately emitted a "creak" within her grasp. 
—— 
When Ou Mucen emerged from the estate, the woman and her car were nowhere to be seen. His gaze turned sharp, and he quickly made a phone call. 
"Hello, the number you have dialed is powered off!" 
Powered off? 
Very well! 
He hung up the phone, and his handsome face suddenly resembled storm clouds on the verge of bursting forth, sending shivers down the spine with just a glance. 
He redialed to have the butler bring his grandfather’s car keys, and eventually, he took his car and headed to the company. 
It seems this woman was taking him less and less seriously, daring to stand him up, to power off her phone? 
He glanced at the time on the car’s navigation system, then pressed down on the phone’s Bluetooth... 
"Good morning, Third Master!" 
"Has Assistant An arrived at the company?" 
"No, is Assistant An coming back today?" 
"..." noveldrama
There was no more conversation, the response for the company reception on the other end was just the sound of a man viciously ripping off his headset and a pair of eyes that immediately turned jet black without a glimmer of light! 
Was she trying to revolt?!! 
—— 
Ye Ning, indeed, did not go to work at Ou Corporation. At the moment, she was back in the city center. 
However, she didn’t go home either. Instead, she settled in a random café, ordered a cup of coffee, and began to stare out at the busy street, lost in thought. 
It was a wake-up call like a sudden shout before an impending blow! 
If she had been hesitant about joining the Ou family business before, now, after the trip to the estate and witnessing that man’s arrangement for her firsthand, it seemed as if she was now fully awake. 
Awakened from a muddled confusion. 
Indeed, there was not a single good person in the Ou family. Why had she held any hope for him? After so many years, hadn’t she learned her lesson, hadn’t she become a bit wiser? 
She held the coffee cup, her somewhat cold fingers faintly turning white. 
"Miss, would you like a refill?" 
"No need!" 
Her rejection was mechanical and ice-cold, her complexion pale and expressionless. 
The server sensed an inexplicable chill and walked away with the coffee pot. 
After the server left, she continued to watch the increasingly noisy street for a while before finally pulling out her phone and making a call, "Hello, do you have contact information for Miss Bai Wei? I’m her client." 
"Yes, just a moment, please!" 
The person on the phone was very polite. After hearing her request for Bai Wei’s number, a string of digits was quickly provided. 
Upon hearing it, she picked up a pen, noted it down, then hung up and logged into her WeChat. 
"Please send a message to Yang Xueshan for me using this number." 
"Sure, go ahead." 
"Xueshan: Insider tip, Ou Mucen’s new product has successfully completed trial production, and they’re about to start bulk manufacturing. This is a great opportunity; you must seize it!" She quickly compiled and sent this message to the receiver.
###Chapter 233: Chapter 233: An Ning, Sanshao is asking if you came to work?
The speed was so fast, it seemed as if she were intentionally not giving herself a chance to hesitate. 
She sent the WeChat message, and before long, the other party replied. She glanced down and immediately saw a screenshot. 
(Yang Xueshan: OK! Wait for my good news! Watch us completely take him down this time!) 
... 
She paused with her fingertips, and after a long while, she picked up the cup of coffee on the desk and drank it all in one gulp, "Waiter, the bill!" 
- 
Half an hour later, Ou’s Corporation Building- 
As soon as Ye Ning stepped into the building, before she even made it to the elevator, she saw Xiaochen coming down with a blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty, who was gesturing animatedly as they descended. 
Fina? 
Ye Ning stopped and waited there for them! 
"Oh my God! An, you’re coming to work?" The blonde who had descended from the elevator cried out excitedly upon seeing the girl waiting for her at the lobby entrance. 
Xiaochen was also very surprised and came over, grabbing her hand, "An Ning, you’re really coming to work? I thought Sanshao was teasing me?" 
Sanshao? 
Ye Ning paused, "He told you I was coming?" 
Xiaochen scratched her hair, "Not exactly, but this morning when he hadn’t arrived yet, he suddenly called and asked if you were at work? And after I said no, he just hung up." 
"..." 
He called the company to ask if she was at work? 
She stood there, silent for a long time. 
If this had been before, she might have been happy, grateful, and felt that he cared about her. 
But now, she wouldn’t! 
Did he ask that question because he was worried she wouldn’t come? Was he concerned that if she left, his mother would never see her again? 
She thought back to a recent incident at the estate, and despite the chill, she couldn’t help but smile, "Really? Well, you can go back and tell him that I came. Oh, and where are you taking Fina?" 
"To the factory, of course. Sanshao said she’s starting work today and should get accustomed to it." 
"Fine, I’ll take her!" 
She took off her bag and directly walked off with the blonde beauty. 
It was like the heavens were helping her, sending such a beauty at this time to act as her cover, making it even less likely for her to be exposed. 
Xiaochen had no idea what the girl was thinking. Hearing that she would take the beauty to the factory for her, she was naturally even happier, quickly agreed, and then headed upstairs with her bag. 
Once on the fifteenth floor, the atmosphere was still heavy and grim. After asking her colleagues, she learned that the president was still reprimanding people in the conference room. 
"Really, what’s with Sanshao today? Why is he so irate?" 
"No idea. Earlier, it was said that Yuzhirun wasn’t on the right track, and it was bothering him. But now that the new samples are out and about to go into mass production, why is he still so angry?" noveldrama
"I don’t know..." 
In the office, everyone was treading on eggshells, quietly discussing the matter amongst themselves. 
Xiaochen entered from outside, saw the scene, and blurted out, "Isn’t it obvious? It’s because Secretary Gao isn’t here. Think about it, many things were handled by Secretary Gao in the past. Now that he’s gone, all those things have to be done by Sanshao himself." 
"That’s true!" 
"But you guys don’t need to worry. With Secretary Gao absent, An Ning has returned, and soon we won’t have to live in such distress." Xiaochen said, and picked up her stuff to go to her desk with a relieved expression.
###Chapter 234: Chapter 234 Risking It All!
Everyone’s expression changed at the sight! 
An Ning? 
That woman had returned? 
Just as the new topic was about to be discussed, the conference room door, which had been subjected to almost two hours of relentless scolding, opened. Everyone immediately shut their mouths and hastily returned to their workstations. 
"Third Young Master, can we now formally begin with the goods from Yuzhirun?" 
It was Yang Cheng, the person in charge at Yuzhirun, who eagerly followed out as soon as the meeting concluded. 
He was the only person today who hadn’t been scolded in the meeting room. 
Ou Mucen exuded a hostile aura, and his eyes carried a bone-chilling coldness that made people tremble even at a glance, "How much?" 
"Two hundred million!" 
The cost of jade is naturally the largest in all investments because it is a high-end product—the better the material, the more expensive the price. That’s standard. 
But this man, upon hearing the amount, merely pondered for a moment before taking the purchase contract in his hand. 
"Keep a close watch on it. There must not be any more incidents! If anything goes wrong again, it won’t just be you—Yuzhirun won’t appear in the Ou Group ever again!" 
"Yes, Third Young Master!" 
Yang Cheng, ecstatic, took the purchase order and swiftly departed. 
Of course, he knew the significance of this capital to Yuzhirun because this money had been put up privately by this young man in power, against the consent of all shareholders. 
Therefore, for Yuzhirun, this money meant they could only succeed, not fail this time! 
Xiaochen at the front desk had also witnessed this scene. Seeing the president emerge from the meeting room with a grim expression, she worried he might question why she was still there and quickly stood up from her chair before he could approach. 
"Third Young Master, Designer Fina has been taken to the factory by An Ning." 
What? 
An Ning? 
The man, preparing to walk inside, paused at these words, "An Ning? She’s back?" 
Xiaochen hurriedly nodded, "Yes, I encountered her when I was taking Fina downstairs. She saw Fina and took her to the factory on her own initiative." 
Xiaochen wasn’t sure if this would irk the BOSS—after all, with Secretary Gao absent, Assistant An’s return could be quite helpful. 
However, to her surprise, upon hearing about Assistant An’s return, the boss, who seemed ready to explode, didn’t get angry. Instead, he just curled the corners of his lips into a chilling smirk, which sent a shiver down one’s spine, and then walked past her. 
What was that expression? 
Why did it look so terrifying? 
Xiaochen felt a tingling on her scalp... 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, still in the factory and unaware of what had happened, took Fina on a tour around the workshop before bringing her to the sampling room, "Fina, this is the sample room. You can look at our current samples and see if there’s anything that could be improved?" 
Fina nodded repeatedly, "Quite good. The equipment and technology of Yuzhirun are almost on par with several of the larger jewelry companies I’ve seen." 
Ye Ning smiled, her gaze drifting to a piece of jade resting on the table. 
It was part of a trial batch sent by the Huo Family last time. Truth be told, it was of excellent quality—an upper-grade material. However, it was hard to say for this time. 
A cold smile crept across her lips, and she deftly slipped the piece of jade into her document bag.noveldrama
###Chapter 235: Chapter 235: She Struggles
After familiarizing Fina with the factory and handing her over to the design department, Ye Ning drove back to the company alone. 
By the time she returned to the company, it was almost 12 o’clock. Seeing this, she didn’t go anywhere else and made a call to the reception on the 15th floor, "Xiaochen, have you finished work? Let’s go to the employee cafeteria to eat together?" 
As soon as Xiaochen heard it was her, she immediately nodded happily, "Sure, sure, wait for me. We’ll meet on the sixth floor." 
After that, she hung up the phone. 
Ye Ning heard and turned off her phone as well, entered the elevator, went up to the sixth floor, and waited for her at the entrance of the restaurant there. 
Soon enough, the girl came down and, upon seeing her, happily ran over, "How was it, how was it? How did the designer’s visit to our factory go? It went smoothly, right?" 
Ye Ning nodded, "Fina is a nice girl, don’t worry, everything’s fine." 
Upon hearing this, Xiaochen finally breathed a sigh of relief, and then the two of them entered the cafeteria. 
After the incident in the cafeteria last time, many people there actually recognized Ye Ning. What surprised her, however, was that they didn’t look at her with pointing fingers but instead greeted her when they saw her. 
"Yo, is that Assistant An? Haven’t seen you in a long time." 
"Exactly, Assistant An, have you been on leave recently?" 
"..." 
Feeling pleasantly surprised and a bit embarrassed, Ye Ning managed a smile and greeted them back before she pulled Xiaochen to sit down at a table, "What’s going on? Why are these people suddenly so friendly to me?" 
Xiaochen laughed, "You don’t know? Miss Bai Wei explained what happened that day when she spilled a drink on you right here in the cafeteria and apologized to you in front of everyone, saying that she was being unreasonable. It’s just a pity that you happened to be not around those days." 
Ah? 
Bai Wei apologized to her? 
Ye Ning doubted she had heard correctly! 
How could Bai Wei possibly apologize to her? She’s the daughter of the Bai Family, spoiled and arrogant since childhood; how could she admit being unreasonable in front of so many people? 
"As for the reason, I don’t know, but I heard from Secretary Gao that after that incident, the internal forum was abuzz, and it even alerted the Third Young Master!" 
"..." 
The Third Young Master? He knew about it, too? 
So, the one who made Bai Wei apologize was actually him? 
Sitting there, Ye Ning’s grip on her cup involuntarily tightened! 
Xiaochen, oblivious to her thoughts and seeing that the food they ordered had arrived, passed the chopsticks and bowl to her and started eating, "Oh right, An Ning, Yuzhirun’s bulk orders are about to enter production, and it’s going to be busy during this period. Do you have any plans? Are you going to stay in the company dormitory?" 
Company dormitory? 
Why stay in the company dormitory? 
Ye Ning didn’t quite understand, "Why should we stay in the company dormitory?" noveldrama
Xiaochen didn’t even look up, "Because of overtime. Don’t you know? Last time Yuzhirun shipped out, half of the president’s office staff stayed working until late at night, including Secretary Gao. Now with a two hundred million order, isn’t it going to be even busier?" 
A two hundred million order? 
Was she talking about two hundred million?!! 
Ye Ning’s chopsticks reaching for the food halted mid-air, "Who told you it’s two hundred million?" 
Yuzhirun’s investment, in fact, was something she had been following up on from the very beginning when she joined, but since she injured her foot and had been absent from work for a long time, she truly didn’t know about this order quantity.
###Chapter 236: Chapter 236: The Two Finally Meet
Two hundred million, wasn’t that the total amount of capital initially proposed for investment into Yuzhirun during the shareholder meeting? 
Ye Ning’s hands had gone slightly pale... 
"What I saw, this morning Manager Yang came to get the third young master’s signature for the subscription form, and I also heard Manager Yang say that this is the third young master’s private stock, and he definitely won’t let the third young master down. An Ning, it looks like this time we really have to give it our all!" 
"..." 
Sitting there with her chopsticks, Ye Ning remained silent for a very long time. 
It wasn’t just about going all out, it was a do-or-die battle. Win, and Yuzhirun would turn its fortunes around; but if lost, the Ou family would no longer have this brand, and besides, a loss of two hundred million in capital would be enough to affect an heir’s approval rating among the shareholders. 
Suddenly, Ye Ning lost all interest in eating. She put down her chopsticks, looked at the girl still wolfing down her food, and said in a hurry, "I’m full. I have something to take care of, going upstairs first." 
Then, she left. 
Xiaochen sat there dumbfounded, taking a long time to react. noveldrama
Full? 
She had hardly touched anything, how could she be full? 
—— 
Returning to her office after hours, Ye Ning saw the still and quiet space before her; no one was present, nor were there any sounds of modern office equipment being used. 
Walking over, she saw the brightly lit office space where, after pulling up the blinds, the cheerful light from outside poured in through the tall windows onto the light coffee-colored floor, shimmering like golden chiffon, which made her feel somewhat dazed! 
Counting the time, she had been here for nearly half a month already. From initially making the decision to successfully entering this company, she had planned to execute her plan within three months. 
She intended to exploit the discord between him and Longfeng to meddle and achieve her goal of revenge against that family. 
But now, the timeline had accelerated significantly. In less than a month, she could achieve it. Shouldn’t she be happier? 
She walked to her desk, turned on the computer, and saw the internal operations process chart clearly displaying the message, "Goods have been shipped." 
Alright then! 
After all, she had come for this purpose, and he was already willing to trade himself in as well. 
With that thought, she suppressed the last bit of struggle in her heart, took a sip of water, and began to work calmly. 
When Ou Mucen returned from outside, she had already been working in the office for two hours. As he entered and saw the woman sitting at the small desk, diligently working, his footsteps halted at the doorway. 
Hearing the sound, Ye Ning quickly looked up at him, seeing him standing there with a completely cold expression, his eyes like swirling vortexes of darkness, impenetrable and seemingly foretelling the arrival of the darkest night! 
The danger and chill were all too apparent! 
Such a terrifying aura... 
Seeing this, Ye Ning’s fingers trembled involuntarily, and she stood up uncontrollably, "Third young master, you’re back!" 
Ou Mucen said nothing, just stood there with his hands in his pockets, not moving an inch, peering down at her, staring coldly. 
Ye Ning felt she couldn’t stand it any longer. Although she had made her choice, and was also angry and disappointed with him for what he had intentionally arranged at Blue Mountain Villa, 
yet when he actually stood before her, she found, to her despair, that she always felt a sense of fear towards him.
###Chapter 237: Chapter 237: An Ning, have I been too lenient with you?
That feeling was as if he still was the noble young master high above in the mansion, and she was just an insignificant adopted daughter. 
Seeing him staring at her as if he wanted to devour her, she hurriedly explained, "Today... I drove away because my car ran out of fuel. By the time I refueled and returned, the security told me you had already left." 
Refuel? 
The man, devoid of emotion, upon hearing this, his scorn and coldness deepened in his eyes, "An Ning, do you think I’ve been too lenient with you recently? So much so that you’ve forgotten who you are?" 
"What?" Ye Ning didn’t understand. 
What did he mean by that? She just mentioned refueling; why would he accuse her of forgetting her place due to leniency? 
Moreover, has he ever been lenient toward her? 
Ye Ning’s frown deepened, "Mucen, if you don’t believe me, you can ask around to see if I really went to get gas." 
Is that necessary? 
Ou Mucen simply didn’t deign to discuss the matter with her anymore. The gas station was at the intersection on the way back to town. If she really ran out of fuel, would she be foolish enough to go there and then turn back? noveldrama
Insane! 
Without another look at her, he returned to his desk with a steel-grey face, pulled out more than a dozen documents from the pile, and threw them on the desk: "Go get these things done, within an hour, and then go to the airport to pick up people." 
Ye Ning was stunned for a moment and took some time to react before she quickly came over. 
"This is..." 
"Do I need to teach you how?" 
After only saying two words, the man who had already opened his computer and appeared to be in a bad mood, looked up and interrupted her coldly. 
Ye Ning dared not ask any further, took the pile of documents, and hurriedly left. 
Luckily, Xiaochen was outside. Having worked here for so long, she knew that everything Ye Ning took out needed to be done by Secretary Gao before and immediately started giving instructions: "This belongs to the advertising department, this is public relations, and this one is for the sales division... An Ning, you’ve got your work cut out for you..." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Saying nothing, she quickly went downstairs with the documents! 
It turned out he wanted her to do the work that Secretary Gao used to do; it made sense, with Secretary Gao not around, these tasks naturally fell to her. 
So the entire afternoon, she was incessantly busy, either supervising the president’s office work with various departments or picking up people at the airport, then arranging various schedules and meeting with clients, so busy she didn’t even have time for a sip of water. 
It wasn’t until six o’clock that she finally returned to the company. 
Back at the office, she initially intended to leave for the day—it was already six o’clock, and she needed to pick up Xiaobao—but unexpectedly, when she opened the door, she saw that the man, who usually wasn’t in the office at this time, was still inside. 
"Mucen, haven’t you left work yet?" 
Ou Mucen, in front of the computer, glanced toward her upon her return. 
She was wearing a lotus-root pink dress that day, with a design that wasn’t overly complicated, simple and elegant. But her complexion and hair seemed a bit disheveled and tired, perhaps from the busy afternoon, and there were thin beads of sweat on her forehead. 
However, it didn’t affect the brilliance of her star-like eyes. 
Ou Mucen’s gaze returned to the photo on the laptop screen... 
That was the civil affairs bureau director’s recent message to him, containing all the detailed information he had requested, including some preserved photos.
###Chapter 238: Chapter 238: She’s scheming against him, he’s investigating her!
Indeed, she was a very beautiful girl. Opportunities for taking photos were scarce in the orphanage, but on some more formal occasions, there would still be a snapshot for keepsake. 
According to the records in these documents, the girl was sent to the orphanage at the age of six, so the first photo was taken when she was six. It had very simple colors, but that did not affect the visibility of her features. 
After that came photos of her going to school, graduating, entering middle school, and four photos of her being adopted. The last one overlapped completely with the memory of the timid little girl he had first encountered in the manor. 
She was a very beautiful girl, both in features and in demeanor, she stood out remarkably. 
He looked up at the woman standing in front of him and, after a long stare into those eyes that closely resembled those in the photos, he asked her, "The charity has sent some projects for the company to support recently, including a nursing home, a school, and a welfare institution. Which do you think is best?" 
A charity? 
Ye Ning was a bit slow to react, "Is the company going to engage in charity work?" 
Ou Mucen nodded, "Mhm, I haven’t looked into it much. The information I’ve got is what they’ve told me. You’ve always lived in those circles before, haven’t you? You should know more than I do." 
His point made sense; when it came to familiarity with those social circles, she indeed knew more than he did. 
Ye Ning didn’t know what he was looking at, but as soon as he asked the question, without even thinking, she gave her answer, "Then let it be the welfare institution. I think those orphans may need it more." 
"Is that so?" 
"Yes, the nursing home is generally a place where people are sent by their children. They have a solid economic foundation, so there’s no need to worry. As for the schools, over the years, our city’s educational institutions have matured considerably and can be put off for support for now. But the welfare institutions, those are filled with orphans or abandoned children; they need much more help." 
Ye Ning spoke the truth. This world desperately needed help with the orphanage because the conditions there were too poor. There were many children, but food and clothing were sorely lacking. 
In the past, she would often wake up in the middle of the night due to hunger or cold. 
Ou Mucen didn’t respond, his gaze just fell back onto the documents on the screen... 
These documents, they were about the very orphanage she mentioned! 
He looked at the photo again, including those eyes. 
The photo really didn’t seem like it was of the same person standing before him. One could almost say that apart from the eyes, everything else was completely different, and even the expression in the eyes had significantly changed. 
The naive girl in the photo had an innocent, bewildered, and pure look in her eyes. 
But the eyes of the woman standing before him now were no longer as clear. They were more like a pearl covered in dust, filled with world-weariness, numbness, and an indifference as stagnant as dead water. noveldrama
Could this really be the same person? 
If it truly was, then this wasn’t a simple matter! 
Ou Mucen fiddled with a pen in his hand, absent-mindedly tapping it on the desk... 
Ye Ning didn’t know what he was thinking. Seeing that he didn’t respond, and remembering she still hadn’t picked up her child, she went to gather her things, "Third Young Master, if there’s nothing else, I’ll finish for the day. I need to go pick up the child." 
"Mhm, come in early tomorrow. The factory is starting mass production tomorrow..." 
Ou Mucen said casually without looking up.
###Chapter 239: Chapter 239: Should I Tell Lin Yebai About This?
As the special assistant specifically responsible for overseeing this project during the mass production at the factory, it was certainly her duty to fully follow up on the matter. Otherwise, why would he hire Ye Ning to work here? 
However, upon hearing these words, Ye Ning felt an unexplained jolt in her heart, and her hand clutching her bag tightened significantly. 
Tomorrow? 
According to her plan for tomorrow, she was not supposed to come, as she needed the evidence of her absence when the situation exploded. 
But now that he had reminded her like this, she had no choice but to agree to him. 
"Okay, I understand!" 
She agreed with an uneasy glance and, not daring to linger any longer, turned and left the place. 
She felt a bit panicked and somewhat distraught, not understanding why... 
After leaving the company, she went downstairs and immediately drove to the kindergarten to pick up her child, and by this time, it was already past six o’clock. 
About ten minutes later, at A City Jinghua Kindergarten- 
"Xiaobao’s mom, you’re finally here. If you didn’t come soon, Xiaobao would have been the only child left." 
Ye Ning had just reached the kindergarten classroom door when she saw her child sitting there obediently waiting for her and the teacher sitting beside him. 
Upon seeing them, Ye Ning instantly felt very guilty and apologetic, "I’m sorry, teacher, I got held back by some busywork at the company and left work late." 
The teacher quickly waved her hand, "You misunderstood, Xiaobao’s mom. It’s nothing. We usually have teachers on duty until seven. It’s just that we were worried about Xiaobao feeling uncomfortable staying here by himself since he is new to the kindergarten and you were late picking him up." 
It didn’t occur to her that the teacher wasn’t blaming Ye Ning for her own sake, but rather for the child’s. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning felt even more remorseful, and after expressing her gratitude and promising to pick up her child on time from now on, she finally left the kindergarten with her son. noveldrama
As they walked out with her child, she immediately looked at the Little Baozi she was holding by the hand, "Xiaobao, do you like the teachers at this kindergarten a lot?" 
Ye Xiaobao nodded, "Mhm, they’re much better than those at the last kindergarten." 
"Really?" 
"Of course it’s true. Just now, when you hadn’t arrived, Teacher Pan was afraid I would be hungry, so she gave me something to eat."
The child, only four years old, wasn’t very keen on lying to Ye Ning, although sometimes, to avoid worrying his mom, he would choose to keep things from her. However, when something genuinely made him happy, his expression was a dead giveaway. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning naturally felt ecstatic. She thought about the person who had helped them find this kindergarten, felt a surge of gratitude, and decided to invite him to dinner, "Xiaobao, how about we invite Uncle Lin to dinner, eh? He’s the one who helped you find such a great kindergarten." 
Xiaobao nodded vigorously, "Yeah! I’ll call Uncle Lin." 
The chubby Little Baozi, upon hearing what his mother said, got into the car and took out his mom’s phone to call Uncle Lin himself. 
After all, he was just too familiar with this uncle. 
When the call connected, a gentle and familiar voice came through from the other end, "Aning..." 
"Uncle Lin, it’s not mom, it’s me. Are you free tonight? My mom said she wants to invite you over for dinner," Ye Xiaobao immediately exclaimed with joy upon hearing Uncle Lin’s voice over the phone. 
Dinner? 
There was a noticeable pause on the other end of the line upon hearing this proactive invitation. 
After all these years, it was the first time she had taken the initiative...
###Chapter 240: Chapter 240 He Cut Off All Her Retreats!
Holding the phone and clutching a golf club, the refined gentleman stood there hesitating for a long time before he ultimately refused, "Really? That’s truly regrettable. Uncle isn’t home today." 
Not at home? 
Ye Xiaobao, who was on the phone, was stunned for a moment, "Where did Uncle go?" 
Lin Yebai chuckled from the other end, "Uncle is in another city, and won’t be back until tomorrow morning. Tell your mom to say we’ll eat after Uncle returns." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Xiaobao could only purse his lips, "Alright, then you take care of yourself, Uncle. We’ll wait for you to come back." 
"Okay!" 
"..." 
Ye Ning had been driving all this time. Seeing Baozi with his little face falling after ending the call, she couldn’t help but find it a bit amusing, "What’s wrong? Is your Uncle Lin not there?" 
Xiaobao nodded, "Yeah, he said he’s not here and has gone to another city. He won’t be back until tomorrow morning." 
"Is that so? Well, in that case, we’ll invite him for a meal tomorrow then." 
"Okay!" 
Ye Ning didn’t think too much about it. This man, who had helped her a lot, was indeed a very busy person. It was normal for him to be often away on business trips, given the vast antique industry he owned. 
So, at this moment, Ye Ning harbored no suspicion at all. 
However, what she didn’t know was that the man who had just spoken to her son on the phone hadn’t left the city at all. Instead, he had gone on a vacation to a suburban villa with a group of friends. 
"Mr. Lin, we found out that the Jade Factory at Qilian Mountain really did sell one ton of B-grade material," one of his assistants reported. 
"One ton?" 
He took the documents his assistant handed him, flipped through them casually, and finally, his gaze settled on the figure," Did you find out if the buyer was Yang Xueshan?" 
The assistant nodded, "Yes, it’s her. Mr. Lin, why would Yang Xueshan buy so much B-grade material for no good reason? Isn’t she the lady of the young master at Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry? Is she intending to make Dragon-Phoenix produce inferior goods?" 
"..." 
The man resting in the chair didn’t answer. After confirming that the person who had made the move was indeed that woman named Yang Xueshan, a satisfied smile finally crossed his lips. 
She had finally made her move. Not a bad plan! 
But... 
He thought of the changes that girl had gone through since joining the Ou’s, and the recent closeness between her and that man, narrowing his eyes as he stood up from the chair. 
"Remember to call my apprentice tomorrow morning and tell her I’m ill," he instructed. 
"Ah?" 
The assistant was slow to catch on, "Ill? What does it mean, sir...?" 
The man who had stood back up expressed no emotion, "It means you invite her to take care of me. Didn’t you understand?" 
When the bowstring is drawn, of course you have to cut off all her escape routes, to ensure that the arrow fires without fail! 
The assistant finally understood! noveldrama
Makes sense. It was no secret that Mr. Lin had intentions towards his apprentice. Since that was the case, calling her over, he surely wanted to spend time alone with her, uninterrupted. 
After the assistant agreed, he immediately went to take care of it. 
But at that moment, the man ready to step inside with the golf club stopped him once more, "Also, after you make the call tomorrow morning, block her mobile signal. Don’t turn it back on until I say so!" 
The assistant laughed, "Understood. Don’t worry, sir, I will handle it well!" 
Afterwards, he left the place...
###Chapter 241: Chapter 241: Xiaobao, do you know what Mommy is doing?
Since Lin Yebai didn’t come for the meal, Ye Ning took Ye Xiaobao home, and they didn’t prepare such a lavish dinner. After frying up two simple dishes, Ye Ning started to clean the house. 
"Mommy, when you went to work today, was Uncle very happy?" 
Xiaobao played with the model his uncle had bought for him last time, and as he saw his mom doing chores, he sat there, looking up and asking. noveldrama
Happy? 
Ye Ning turned her head and glanced at him, "Why would you think he was very happy?" 
Ye Xiaobao blinked his watery big eyes, "Because that day he asked where you went. Then I said you went to the new company, and he was really angry," 
"Really angry?" 
"Yeah, like he wanted to eat mommy," Ye Xiaobao had a rich vocabulary, having even used that expression. 
Ye Ning stiffened for a moment, then stopped looking at him, and went about her own work... 
He really did want to "eat" her, otherwise, this morning, he wouldn’t have lured her to his home and presented her like a "gift" to his mother. 
Ye Ning started to wash their clothes with her head down. 
But Little Baozi in the living room, seeing that his mom didn’t respond, began to speak again, "Mommy, Uncle really isn’t bad, it’s just that he has a bad temper. You just need to bear with it a bit more." 
"..." 
Why is he still speaking up for him? What kind of love potion has he been fed? 
Ye Ning felt a bit irritated, and turning around with a dark expression, she snapped at the little brat, "Xiaobao, why do you always take his side? Are you very close to him? Is it because he treated you to food, and bought you toys, that you’ve been completely bought over? You don’t even want Mommy anymore?" 
Her speech was very fast, and her voice full of thin anger and impatience! 
Seeing this, Ye Xiaobao didn’t dare to speak and just stared with a pair of slightly shocked eyes, dumbfounded at his mother. 
What’s wrong with Mommy? Why did she suddenly get so angry? Did he say something wrong? 
But these were things he had said before, and she had never been so fierce. 
Ye Xiaobao felt a little wronged... 
Ye Ning saw the expression on his face and felt a bit guilty, but she didn’t explain and just continued washing their clothes with an annoyed look on her face. 
Was it wrong to dislike her son putting a good label on that man? 
After washing the clothes, and seeing the child, who had been playing outside and had the sense to go to his room to sleep, Ye Ning went in and looked at the small lump already asleep on the child’s bed. 
She knew that due to his growing environment, her son was more wary of strangers and had a harder time warming up to them than other children. 
Yet, this man had only appeared three times before her son and had already successfully gained his trust, affection, and repeatedly spoken up for her. 
This was hard for her to accept, and it made her feel uneasy, and even... jealous! 
Xiaobao, do you know who he is? 
And do you know? He is just a pawn in Mommy’s plan for revenge? 
In the end, Ye Ning fell asleep messily on her son’s bed until she was woken up by him the next morning, "Mommy, Mommy, it’s time to get up, it’s already 7:30." 
7:30 already? 
Ye Ning opened her eyes, her reflex was to get up immediately to take the child to kindergarten and to go to work. 
But as she sat up, she remembered what day it was today, and all of a sudden, she lay back down, "Today, Mommy doesn’t have to work. We can go to kindergarten a bit later."
###Chapter 242: Chapter 242: Hostage!
Not working today? 
Why not? 
Ye Xiaobao didn’t quite understand and was about to ask her mother what was going on when her mother’s cell phone suddenly rang. 
"Mom, somebody is calling you!" 
"All right, my good baby, can you bring the phone to Mommy?" Ye Ning rolled over and took the phone from Little Baozi’s hand. 
It’s actually Lin Yebai? 
Ye Ning held the phone, saw the caller ID, and was startled for a moment. 
Could it be that Big Brother Lin is calling so early in the morning because there is some matter? 
She remembered she had not mentioned her plans for the day to him. Suddenly, she felt a pang of guilt, "Hello, Big Brother Lin..." 
"An Ning, Mr. Lin is ill, could you come over when you have time?" noveldrama
Ah?
Lin Yebai is sick? 
Ye Ning, hearing this voice on the phone, was caught off guard for a moment. 
How could Big Brother Lin be sick? Wasn’t he fine just yesterday? He said he wasn’t around, that he was outside. How could he have suddenly fallen ill? 
Rushing out of bed, she headed to the bathroom, "What happened? How did he get sick? Where are you guys right now?" 
"We just got back to A City this morning. He started feeling unwell already in C City yesterday, but Mr. Lin asked us not to tell you. However, after we returned this morning, his condition worsened. I had no choice but to call you. You know, he doesn’t like going to the hospital." 
"..." 
What? 
He’s an adult, why does he not go to the hospital whenever he gets sick? 
Ye Ning was on the verge of going crazy. She hurriedly hung up the phone, not daring to delay any further, and quickly got both her son and herself ready before heading downstairs with him. 
"Mom, is Uncle Lin sick?" 
"Yes, Mommy needs to check on him. Be good at kindergarten today, okay? After Mommy takes Uncle Lin to the hospital, I will come to pick you up." After putting her son in the car, Ye Ning went to the driver’s seat to start the vehicle. 
Ye Ning’s concern for this man was truly heartfelt. It was not just about taking him to the hospital—she would willingly care for him around the clock without sleep if necessary. 
Because to her, this man was as important as a family member! 
However, what she didn’t know was that as she was going downstairs, the signal bars on her phone, which was in her bag, suddenly disappeared, and the normally prominent "China Telecom" on the display changed to "Searching for service..." 
Driving quickly, it took only about ten minutes for Ye Ning to see the kindergarten. 
After stopping there, she first dropped off her son, then got back into the car, preparing to head to Tang Garden on East Street to see the sick man. 
But just as she was driving out from the kindergarten’s corner and was about to enter the main road, she saw a man wearing a black suit and sunglasses at the U-turn corner. 
And that man, seeing her car approaching, unexpectedly started walking towards her without any hesitation! 
Oh my God! 
What is he doing? Does he have a death wish? 
Ye Ning, shocked by this scene, quickly slammed on the brakes in alarm, "What are you doing? Do you have a death wish?" 
"Are you An Ning?" 
"What?" 
"Our madam wants to see you!" 
"..." 
Madam? 
Ye Ning looked at the man in sunglasses who had come directly to her car window, completely dumbfounded. 
Madam? Who is the madam? Why does she want to see her?
###Chapter 243: Chapter 243: Has She Already Been Exposed?
She was a bit confused and stared at him with wide, vigilant eyes. After a while, she finally asked, "Who is your lady? Why does she want to see me?" 
The man in sunglasses was expressionless, "You’ll know when you get there. My car is just up ahead. Miss An, it’s in your best interest to follow us, otherwise, we can’t guarantee the safety of your child in that kindergarten!" 
"You—" 
Ye Ning’s face turned ashen with fear. noveldrama
Her child? 
They actually knew where Xiaobao was? 
It seemed that they had been watching her for some time, but who exactly were they? Could it be the people from the Ou Family’s second house? Had she been exposed? 
Her face went deathly pale in an instant! 
However, once she calmed down, she felt it was unlikely because if she had really been exposed, that family wouldn’t have just arranged for her to meet the lady so simply. 
Besides, Mei Liping in the Ou Family, she was not the lady of the house but merely the wife of the second son! 
With this realization, Ye Ning felt slightly more composed and then looked at the man standing in front of her car window, "Then where is your lady?" 
"Just follow my car," he said, then waved his hand, and a silver-grey Mercedes appeared from around the corner and pulled up. Ye Ning watched as he got into the car and drove away. 
Ye Ning hurriedly opened her purse to take out her phone to call for help from Lin Yebai, but to her surprise, she found that her phone had no signal at all. 
Damn it! 
Why does this damn phone always let her down at the most crucial moment? 
She angrily stuffed the phone back into her bag, trying to think of another solution, but the car ahead, seeing that she hadn’t followed, had already started honking to signal her. 
She had no other option but to bite the bullet and follow. 
If something really happened to her, she believed that with Lin Yebai’s capabilities, he wouldn’t be unable to find her. 
Thinking this, she felt somewhat more at ease and finally started her car, following the silver-grey Mercedes. 
Twenty minutes later, on a bustling and noisy seaside street in A City, Ye Ning saw the silver-grey car pull up in front of a high-end western restaurant. 
A western restaurant? 
Their lady wanted to meet her in a western restaurant? 
Ye Ning looked at the establishment, which was one of the more upscale venues on this street, both in terms of decor and size, and drove her car towards it. 
As she approached, the door of the silver-grey Mercedes opened, and then the man with sunglasses who had stopped her earlier got out and started walking towards her. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning knew she had no choice, so she too got out of her car and followed him into the western restaurant. 
"Sir, how many are in your party?" 
"I’m here to meet someone!" 
The man in sunglasses waved his hand at the waiter, who immediately backed off. Then, Ye Ning followed him straight inside. 
It was a very upscale restaurant, evident from its authentic European decor style and the quiet and elegant ambiance that flowed all around. One could tell that this was not a place the average person could afford to dine in. 
Following the man inside, Ye Ning noticed that there weren’t many people in the restaurant at this time of day, yet the pianist and the staff were fully prepared, which made her furrow her
###Chapter 244: Chapter 244: Don’t think you can act recklessly just because my son protects you.
Who is this person, to make a Western restaurant that barely serves breakfast put on such a grand display? 
Following inside, she soon saw a figure at one of the best window-side locations in the restaurant, wearing a deep blue grenadine blouse crafted with exquisite workmanship, radiating grace and luxury. 
Her hair was chestnut-colored, without any exaggerated perms or dyes, but instead fastened with a pearl hair clip, meticulously coiled up. Such a hairstyle made it so, when she looked from this angle, along with the pair of black pearl earrings she wore, she felt as if she were seeing a governmental official’s wife from the Republic of China era. 
Who was this woman? 
"Mrs. Ou, your coffee is here. Do you need anything else?" 
"No need!" 
Just as she was lost in confusion, a waiter came over with a cup of coffee. Upon hearing him, she suddenly had a realization. 
Mrs. Ou? 
Bai Tingfang? Could it really be her? 
How did she come to know who she was? Had someone told her? Could it be... her son? 
She remembered the incident from yesterday morning, and suddenly, her fingers clutching her purse turned slightly pale... 
"Why are you still standing? Do you need me to invite you over to sit?" Similarly, Bai Tingfang, seated on the sofa, also sensed the arrival of the person behind her and let out a cold laugh before uttering this phrase. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning pursed her lips and, finally carrying her purse, approached, "Mrs. Ou..." 
Bai Tingfang stared at her with a look of disgust, "Could it be that you did not expect us to meet again so soon? Assistant An!" 
Assistant An... 
She indeed knew who she was! 
Ye Ning understood and stood there, not denying it further, but instead looked directly into her eyes and asked, "Yes, indeed I did not expect that, but Mrs. Ou, how did you come to know my identity?" 
Bai Tingfang let out a cold laugh, "Is it so hard to find out your identity? Let me tell you, there’s nothing that Bai Tingfang wants to know that she can’t find out!" 
Ye Ning’s fingers digging into her palm pressed even deeper.
Indeed, who would dare not reveal what she wanted to know? Even her own son could deliver Ye Ning herself to her doorstep because of her command; what couldn’t she accomplish? 
Ye Ning turned her head to look elsewhere, "Then, what is it that Mrs. Ou wishes to speak to me about this time?" 
"Speak about what?" 
Bai Tingfang was infuriated by her nonchalant attitude. With a slap, she placed the coffee cup in her hand down and glared at her with piercing eyes, "I am here to warn you. Don’t think that just because Mucen is protecting you and your son from me, you can do whatever you please within the Ou family. Let me tell you, this is not the place for you to run rampant!" 
The last sentence was delivered with such force that even her spit sprayed out! 
Ye Ning was taken aback... 
What was she talking about? The man who yesterday personally wanted to hand her over to this woman, was he not allowing her mother to harm their mother and son? 
Ye Ning was somewhat surprised, "He told you not to touch us?" 
Bai Tingfang became even angrier, "What? Do you really think I dare not touch you?" noveldrama
"No, not at all..." 
Ye Ning quickly refuted, then suddenly asked another unrelated question, "Mrs. Ou, how exactly did you find out about me? Did your son tell you?" 
"Do I need him to tell me? Let me tell you, I had already found out who you were. If it weren’t for my son’s intervention, do you think you would still have the chance to stand before me?" 
Ye Ning: "..."
###Chapter 245: Chapter 245 She Finally Knew He Didn’t Betray Her
What did she mean by that? 
Ye Ning’s mind suddenly lurched, and her usually clear thoughts began to blur... 
Was she saying that she had found out who she was long ago? 
So that meant, the person who truly revealed her identity wasn’t that man, but herself upon her own investigation? Also, did it mean that his intention yesterday morning for having her go to the Bamboo Garden wasn’t to hand her over to her, right? 
Ye Ning’s face eventually turned paler by the moment! 
"I’m telling you, it was because he confessed your identity to me ahead of time. Otherwise, you and your child would have already vanished from this city today," Bai Tingfang continued to warn fiercely, oblivious to the unease in the woman before her.
Indeed, in her eyes, a woman who had lost her husband and was left with a burden was already the biggest cancer in the world. Such a woman needed a good warning from her. What if she set her sights on her son next? 
However, the woman standing opposite her, from the moment she denied it, had her mind elsewhere. Her fingers clenched tighter and tighter, her lips growing increasingly pale. 
It turned out he hadn’t betrayed her. It was all a misunderstanding! 
And what about her using him? 
Had it already started? 
She looked down, as if recalling something, then glanced at her wristwatch. Upon seeing it was almost nine o’clock, her lips quivered and she immediately turned and ran out swiftly. 
In the restaurant, Bai Tingfang was still speaking when she suddenly saw the woman leave without a word. She jumped angrily to her feet, shouting, "You bitch! You dare to run? Someone catch her for me!" 
At her shriek, the sunglasses-wearing man who was waiting realized the situation and hurriedly chased after her. 
But the woman was too fast. When he reached the door, she was already in the white Audi, which then took off like a shot. 
Seeing this, the man in sunglasses stopped his pursuit. 
"Madam, rest assured, now that we have found her, she won’t escape. Besides, we know where her child is." 
"..." noveldrama
It was at that moment that Bai Tingfang, who had also come chasing out of the restaurant, finally stopped fuming. 
However, as she ceased her actions, on the other side, people who learned that the girl had not gone to Tang Garden as planned, but was instead driving crazily towards the Ou Corporation factory downtown, the nostalgic charm of the garden was shattered. The man who had been sitting on the rattan chair waiting for the girl crushed the teacup in his hand into pieces! 
"Sir..." 
"Stop her immediately! Use whatever means necessary!!! She must return here today!!!" 
"Yes, sir!" 
The arrow was already on the string; how could she think of giving up just because she wanted to? Had she forgotten the purpose of her return? Had she forgotten what she was doing lurking around that man? 
Opening his hand, the man examined the palm filled with bloodstained ceramic shards and began to cough violently as if seriously ill... 
---- 
Ye Ning was still speeding towards the factory. She wanted to call the factory to get them to stop, but she realized her phone had no signal.
###Chapter 246: Chapter 246: Stop Her from Returning to the Ou Corporation at All Costs!
She had no choice but to press the accelerator to the max, starting to rush toward the factory at breakneck speed. 
However, things quickly took a turn when she entered the downtown area and was about to make a right turn toward the factory. Suddenly, she saw a large truck appear in front of her. The way the truck emerged was uncanny, forcing her to violently turn the steering wheel and narrowly avoiding a collision. 
What was wrong with that driver? Why didn’t they even honk before coming out? 
Her hands were shaking a bit. She didn’t know if it was because she had been scared just now or because she was so anxious. 
Yet, that wasn’t even the most frustrating part. After she swerved to avoid the truck, she realized that she had missed the turn in her panic, and if she had to turn around now, it would be at least two kilometers further ahead. 
Shit! 
Seeing this, she cursed fiercely in frustration and had no choice but to drive two kilometers further to make a U-turn. 
"Beep beep—" 
But then, as if cursed again, just as she reached that point and was about to turn back, a sedan, as if gone mad, shot into the junction, completely disregarding the traffic rules, from the same spot she was going to use to make her U-turn. 
Startled by the sight, she had to quickly react and miss the turning spot again. 
What on earth was happening today? Why did she keep encountering such lunatics one after another? 
She was beginning to lose patience. She wanted to see if there was another place to turn ahead, but just at that moment, her glance unintentionally swept the rearview mirror, and she caught sight of three cars following closely behind her. 
Who were they? 
What did they want? 
She started to grow suspicious, and a thought began to stir in her heart. She deliberately pressed down on the gas pedal. 
Sure enough, as soon as she increased her speed, the three cars behind also accelerated to keep up, following her like clingy pests. 
So that was it... 
The heart in her chest began to beat violently, and in her mind, an answer was screaming to come out... 
No! 
Brother Lin, as she saw him, wasn’t that kind of person. 
It couldn’t be... 
She fixed her eyes on the tarmac road stretching further away from the downtown area, and it felt as if something in her heart had been torn, causing her exceptional discomfort. 
However, no matter how much she didn’t want to admit it, at the next and last U-turn back to the downtown area on this road, one of the three cars behind her did the same thing again. It shot out from her left side as before. 
Seeing this, she suddenly closed her eyes tight, and her hands forcefully turned the steering wheel to the left. 
And so, at that moment, at that last turnoff near the highway entrance back to the downtown area, just a loud "bang" was heard. Everyone driving by saw the white Audi crash into the red Toyota that had suddenly emerged at its side, the situation so dire that everyone was left staring in shock. 
"Is the driver of that Toyota an idiot? How can they jet out like that? Do they even know how to drive?" 
"Exactly, did they even get a driver’s license? Who drives like that?" 
"Do they think this is a queue and that they can just cut in?" noveldrama
"Crazy!" 
"..." 
The two cars that had been following closely behind were also stunned. They wanted to check on the situation but then remembered their boss’s instructions: they couldn’t let the woman in the white Audi realize who they were. 
PS: I update at eight, but let’s see what time it comes out!
###Chapter 247: Chapter 247 She Must Rush Over to Stop It Immediately
So they stopped there, watched for a while, and then immediately turned around and drove away! 
This incident was serious; they had to hurry to inform the boss. 
At the scene of the accident, the drivers failed to notice the two suspicious vehicles. Concerned about rescuing those involved, many of them quickly got out of their cars and went to help. 
"Let’s call the police first, this accident is so severe!" 
"Right, and an ambulance too, see if the people are okay?" 
When they reached the two cars, the people saw the female driver sitting in the driver’s seat of the white Audi, unconscious on the airbag. They immediately smashed the car door and rescued her from the vehicle. 
Fortunately, after being rescued, the female driver, who seemed not to have any serious injuries, slowly woke up. 
"Miss, are you all right? How do you feel?" 
"..." 
Ye Ning opened her eyes and saw the people standing in front of her. After a while, she struggled to get up from the ground: "Can any of you spare some time? Could you give me a lift to the city?" 
To the city? noveldrama
In such a situation, she still wanted to go to the city? 
The drivers, upon hearing her request, decisively refused: "Miss, you’ve just been in a car crash. You should wait for the doctor to check you first. We’ve already called." 
"No need, no need, I’m fine. I need to go to the city now. It’s really, really urgent. Thank you for your help." 
She was almost pleading. 
Yes, she had to go to the city now, or it would be too late. 
Luckily, among the group, there was a driver who just happened to be going to the city. Seeing her in good spirits and apparently not seriously hurt, he agreed to take her. Thus, after her car was wrecked, Ye Ning finally got a ride to the city. 
"Driver, please hurry, the address is this location." As soon as she got in the car, she started urging him impatiently. 
The driver was a good person; seeing her so anxious, he immediately floored the accelerator to 120 mph, speeding toward the location she had provided. 
Meanwhile, at Yuzhirun Factory? 
Just after eight o’clock in the morning, the Huo Family’s cargo had already arrived. By the time Ou Mucen came over, Yang Cheng had instructed the factory workers to unload the jade stones and start preparing for cutting. 
"Manager Yang, don’t we need to wait for Assistant An to come and inspect the raw stones before cutting?" 
While unloading, the factory manager responsible for production asked this question with safety in mind. 
However, Yang Cheng waved his hand dismissively after hearing this: "I can’t get through to her phone, and she has already inspected the prototype of this batch of cargo before, hasn’t she? There’s no problem." 
With that... 
Finally, without further delay, the factory manager led the workers to move the raw stones to the cutting line. 
Just then, Ou Mucen arrived, parked his car, got out, and upon seeing the large cargo truck inside the factory, he immediately strode in: "Has the cargo arrived?" 
Yang Cheng hurriedly came forward: "Third Young Master, yes, it arrived just after eight o’clock. We’ve just finished unloading and are preparing to cut." 
"Where’s An Ning? Did she come over?" 
"Not yet. Isn’t Assistant An at the headquarters?" Yang Cheng was slightly alarmed by the president’s question. 
Right, Assistant An always went to the company. If she was coming to the factory, wouldn’t he know about it?
###Chapter 248: Chapter 248 She Will Never Know The Consequences If She Didn’t Come Today
Yang Cheng was a bit confused about the meaning of the president’s words! noveldrama
But when his boss heard that the woman hadn’t come over at all, and remembered not seeing her when he had just arrived in the office, his face instantly darkened. 
"Call her, tell her to come over immediately!" 
"..." 
Call her? 
But he had already called her many times before, and the calls just couldn’t get through. 
Yang Cheng really wanted to say this, but after seeing the president’s face, he said nothing and picked up the phone to dial... 
"Hello, the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable!" 
As expected, after redialing, the same message came through. 
Seeing no other way out, Yang Cheng, sweating coldly, looked at his BOSS carefully, "President Ou, Assistant An’s phone... seems to be unreachable." 
Unreachable? 
Why? 
His gaze instantly became gloomy, staring at Yang Cheng for a while before he finally picked up his own phone to dial out. 
The result was disappointing, the same as his subordinate; he heard the voice saying the call couldn’t be connected. 
So, was the woman not going to come today? 
He remembered the blood sample that Secretary Gao had finally brought back last night, and the two sets of blood test results that Ji Chengzhi had given him early this morning; finally, his cold eyes narrowed even further. 
So, was she playing games with him? 
Fine, he’d play along with her! 
After hanging up the phone, he stared emotionlessly at the pile of jade stones that were ready to be cut, "Send all these jade stones to the production line, start manufacturing!" 
Yang Cheng: "..." 
Standing there, he was dazed for a while before snapping back to reality and hurriedly arranged for production to start. 
My God! 
The killing intent that the president had just now was so terrifying, there was a feeling that he could crush someone to pieces at any minute. It was too frightening. 
Not daring to look at that man again, he immediately took the factory manager and prepared to feed the batch of jade stones into the cutting machine. 
However, what he didn’t know was that just as he was about to start, the young BOSS standing behind them had eyes that, when staring at the batch of jade stones, seemed to whirl into darkness, devoid of light; his entire pupils were terrifyingly gloomy! 
Two billion was just play money to Ou Mucen; he could afford the game! 
As massive amounts of jade stones were poured in and the machine was about to start, at that moment, a figure rushed in from outside, "Wait... wait..." 
The voice was shrill and high-pitched. 
Was it a woman? 
Yang Cheng, who was directing, immediately ordered the workers about to start to stop, then everyone turned their heads towards the entrance of the factory, and suddenly, they saw a figure in lotus pink rushing in. 
"It’s Assistant An, President Ou!" Recognizing her, Yang Cheng immediately exclaimed with surprise. 
Ou Mucen saw her too, but he didn’t speak; instead, his gaze, devoid of any warmth, coldly fixed on her as he watched her run until she finally reached him. 
"I’m sorry, Third Master, I was stuck in traffic and am late!" 
Ye Ning finally arrived, and seeing the man standing in front of the machine, she immediately started explaining to him. 
She couldn’t say too much; otherwise, with his intelligence, he would definitely notice something.
###Chapter 249: Chapter 249: Third Young Master, These Goods Are Not Right
However, what made her very nervous was that even after she had finished explaining, the man still had no reaction. He just stared at her expressionlessly, his gaze making her hair stand on end and cold sweat break out. 
Ye Ning couldn’t take it anymore and hurriedly turned her head to look elsewhere. She saw that a large pile of jade raw materials had already been moved to the cutting machine. They were getting ready to cut, so she quickly stopped looking at him and went over there instead. 
"Manager Yang, those pieces of jade material, I haven’t looked at them yet. How could you start cutting them already?" 
Manager Yang: "..." 
Wasn’t it because you, the assistant, hadn’t arrived? How could the blame be pinned on him now? 
Manager Yang felt a bit wronged: "Assistant An, we waited for you all morning. You didn’t show up and we couldn’t get through on the phone, so we decided to start cutting." 
The phone couldn’t get through? 
Ye Ning remembered her phone that hardly ever had a signal and finally said nothing more. She went over and made the people come down from the machine, then approached the pile of raw stones. 
Yang Cheng saw this and looked over at the BOSS who had been standing there without moving: "President Ou, what do you think..." 
"Let her check!" 
The man who had been staring at the woman with an expressionless face finally spoke, but his tone and voice were as cold as could be. 
Seeing this, Yang Cheng didn’t dare to ask any more questions. He waved his hand to signal the people to stop working. Everyone in the factory stayed where they were, quietly waiting for Assistant An, who was late, to check the pieces of jade. noveldrama
Really, wasn’t this superfluous? The previous samples had been fine, so what could possibly be wrong with the bulk of the goods now? 
Many people felt that what she was doing was a bit redundant!
But what no one expected was that after the young girl in the lotus-colored linen dress went over, in just about four or five minutes, they saw her stand up with a piece of jade: "Something’s wrong with this batch, everyone stop cutting for now!" 
Wrong? 
How was it wrong? 
Her sudden outburst surprised everyone, and for several seconds, the factory was in chaos. 
It was no wonder. This was merchandise worth two hundred million. To suddenly declare the goods incorrect would startle anyone, let alone the employees of this factory. 
Yang Cheng was the first to be startled, his face changing color. He dashed over without thinking and blurted out: "Assistant An, what do you mean it’s wrong? Didn’t you check the goods before?" 
Ye Ning looked at him: "I checked the sample goods, not this one." 
"But isn’t this the bulk shipment of that batch of samples? Shouldn’t they all be the same?" 
"Of course they’re not the same. Jade isn’t just any ordinary item. It’s common for the bulk to not match the samples," Ye Ning tried to keep her tone and expression as calm as possible. Only by doing so could she avoid revealing too many flaws. 
But what she didn’t know was that from the moment she appeared in the factory, a pair of eyes had never left her, and now, seeing her casually glance and declare the goods wrong. 
The sarcasm in those pitch-black, lightless eyes grew even colder. 
Hearing that it was common for the bulk to differ from the samples, Yang Cheng, who didn’t understand the jade market very well, looked at him immediately: "Young Master, Assistant An says the goods are wrong, so what do we do now?"
###Chapter 250: Chapter 250 She Suddenly Got a Nosebleed
"..." 
The goods had a problem, of course they needed to be returned, but by returning them, wouldn’t all previous efforts be wasted? 
He lifted his gaze and looked at her quietly; his pupils were dark, yet his expression remained wavelessly calm. 
"Are you really sure there’s a problem with the goods?" 
"..." 
Ye Ning suddenly felt her heart skip a beat. She clenched the jade stone in her hand tightly and dared not look into his eyes. "There is, Mucen. Its quality is different from the last time." 
"Why would it be different? Could the Huo Family really dare to send fake goods to me?" 
Ye Ning was at a loss for words! 
She had come in such a hurry that she hadn’t considered what excuse she would use to cover this up if the issue got stopped. 
Indeed, it was the Huo Family’s first major transaction with Ou Corporation. Why would they send fake goods? 
Sweat began to form in her palms, and at the same time, her mind started to race... 
However, as she pondered, her head suddenly began to buzz, and at the same time, she heard someone exclaim, "Oh my god, Assistant An, why are you having a nosebleed?" 
Was she having a nosebleed? 
She was stunned for a moment before finally looking down at the jade stone she was holding. 
Sure enough, the stone that had been covered only in dust now had drops of crimson liquid on it. 
Why would she have a nosebleed out of nowhere? 
She was a bit slow to react. Looking up to see the man standing opposite her also seemed surprised, she paused and then remembered to take a pack of tissues from her bag to cover her nose. 
"It’s nothing, it’s nothing. I must be overheated. Don’t worry about me." 
It was summer, so it was normal to be overheated! 
Therefore, she didn’t think too much about it. After covering her nose, she prepared to head to the washroom inside the factory to deal with it. 
But as soon as she left the crowd, her vision suddenly spun, and she had to support herself against the nearby wall. 
Why was she feeling so dizzy? 
And she felt like vomiting! noveldrama
She began to feel uneasy standing there. After taking a while to recover, she continued inwardly. 
Similarly, from behind, Ou Mucen’s gaze never left her. When he saw her stumble, his eyes paused. 
What was she doing? 
Was she faking it, trying to use this method to avoid his question? 
But a nosebleed seemed impossible to fake... 
His eyes shifted to the jade stone that she had been holding and now had handed to a worker, his expression growing complex. 
Yang Cheng, oblivious to what he was thinking, asked after Ye Ning had left, "So Mucen, what do we do now? Return the goods?" 
"Yes! Call the Huo Family, and have them give me an explanation," he said coldly before turning and heading to the factory office. 
In fact, even if she hadn’t come, he would have called the Huo Family nonetheless because Ou Mucen was not someone who could be easily fooled in business. 
Back in the office, he booted his computer, ready to access the internal website, when he overheard the clerks in the outside office discussing, "What’s wrong with Assistant An? She’s vomiting so badly in the washroom." 
"Vomiting? Is she ill?" 
"I don’t know. Does anyone have stomach medicine? I’ll take some to her." 
"..." 
Vomiting? 
Hadn’t she just had a nosebleed? Why had she started vomiting now? 
As he listened to this, recalling the sudden stream of red from her nose, he frowned slightly. The webpage he had just opened was promptly closed by him again.
###Chapter 251: Chapter 251: Bring Her to My Car
"Yang Cheng!" 
"Third Young Master, Manager Yang is not in the office. He’s outside, I’ll call him in right away." 
The clerks who were hurriedly looking for medicine outside suddenly heard the voice of the president from the office and quickly stopped their discussion. One of them came in. 
Ou Mucen’s pupils were deep black, his expression showed no signs of fluctuation, but when he saw her come in, he asked indifferently, "What were you discussing just now? Who had an accident?" 
The clerk quickly answered, "It’s Assistant An. She had a nosebleed just now, didn’t she? Manager Yang was worried and asked me to check on her in the restroom. When I went there, I found her vomiting." 
Vomiting? 
Why would she vomit? 
The man, whose eyes had been emotionless, finally showed a ripple of concern, "What exactly happened? Why would she suddenly start vomiting?" 
The clerk shook her head, "We don’t know, we’re not sure if she’s sick? We were just looking for some medicine for her." 
"What medicine?" 
"Well... Probably medicine for the stomach, or maybe cold medicine. You know, Third Young Master, we’re not near the city center, there’s no hospital around. These medicines are what we keep in case someone has a headache or a fever." 
The clerk explained nervously, rambling on as if afraid the young president would get angry. 
However, the man’s face had already turned grim upon hearing that she was just grabbing any random medicine, and with a "snap", he closed his laptop and stood up from the chair, "Take her to my car." 
"Ah?" 
"Can’t understand?" 
"No, no, no... I’ll go right away!" The clerk felt like slapping herself. 
Retarded? 
How could the message be unclear? Assistant An is the president’s assistant. Since they came together, it’s natural for the president to take her to see a doctor if she’s sick. 
The clerk berated herself harshly and hurried out of the office, dashing to the restroom, where Ye Ning, who had been vomiting all this time, was close to collapsing. 
"Assistant An? Assistant An, how are you feeling?" 
"I’m... I’m fine..." Ye Ning leaned there, still desperately holding on. 
The clerk’s face changed upon seeing her, "You’re saying you’re fine? Look at how pale your face is. Come on, I’ll take you out. President Ou asked me to bring you to his car." 
Who? 
President Ou? 
Ye Ning was leaning against the wall, her mind fuzzy, but upon hearing these words, she immediately opened her eyes wide, "You said to take me... where?" 
The clerk blinked, "President Ou. He heard us talking about you when he was in the office and then asked me to bring you to him. He’s probably going to take you to see a doctor." noveldrama
After saying that, she moved to support her! 
But as soon as Ye Ning heard she was to be taken to that man’s car, she instantly stepped back! 
Taken to his car? 
No, she couldn’t go. She hadn’t thought of an excuse for what happened today. Besides, she had already dealt with the matter here. She had another much more important thing to do. 
She needed to visit Tang Garden, to ask that man why he did what he did. Why would he know about the issue that she hadn’t told him about? And why intervene in such a way that she had no way out? 
But before she could take the first step, the clerk had already grabbed her arm and was supporting her by the shoulder...
###Chapter 252: Chapter 252: Ou Mucen, I... feel unwell...
"Hey, why are you still refusing? Look at the state you’re in. Do you not care about your life?" 
"I..." 
"Alright, I’ll tell you, although Mr. Ou doesn’t like you, you’re sick now, he won’t do anything to you." 
The newly hired executive assistant at Yuzhirun had not been working for a month before she caused Mr. Ou to get injured in the factory, which everyone had seen, so the clerk understood her reluctance to get into Mr. Ou’s car at this time. 
But, reluctance aside, you still need to get treated, right? 
Besides, Mr. Ou isn’t without humanity. He couldn’t possibly hold a grudge to that extent, could he? 
Without further discussion, the clerk helped the new assistant out of the factory building and went outside to ask the security guard to open the door of Mr. Ou’s car. She then stuffed the girl she was supporting into the car, "Assistant An, you wait here, okay? Mr. Ou will be out soon." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
She wanted to say something, but at that moment, a wave of dizzying vertigo hit her brain, accompanied by a bout of nausea. She dared not speak. 
Sitting in the car, after waiting for a few minutes, indeed, a tall and distinguished figure emerged from the factory. Seeing that she was already inside the car, the person came over, took the car keys directly from the security guard, and got in. 
A very light scent of mint wafted in, which strangely eased the persistent nausea and stifling feeling in Ye Ning’s stomach a bit. 
"What did you eat?" noveldrama
"Hmm?" 
Ye Ning, not understanding, leaned there with her unusually pale face, marred by discomfort, and opened her eyes to look ahead. 
What had she eaten? 
No, she hadn’t eaten anything in the morning. If she had, perhaps she wouldn’t be feeling so unwell now. With nothing to vomit, even the bile came up, leaving a bitter taste in her mouth. 
Ye Ning closed her eyes again, simply too weak to answer his question. 
Ou Mucen in the front could see her condition through the rearview mirror. His brows knitted together, and he stopped asking, instead inserting the car key into the ignition. Soon, he started the car and left the factory. 
He had planned to speed towards the hospital upon leaving, but he hadn’t gone far from the factory, not even reaching the main road, when the woman in the back weakly called out, "Ou Mucen, you... you stop for a moment, I... I feel so unwell..." 
Unwell? 
Ou Mucen glanced at the rearview mirror and saw the woman slumping over to one side, seemingly unable to sit steadily. His expression changed slightly, and he promptly pressed the brake. 
What on earth was happening to her? Why was it getting so serious so suddenly? 
He stopped the car and turned around, intending to check on her, but found that as soon as he stopped the car, she reached for the door next to her seat. By the time he turned the engine off, she was already getting out. 
"Ugh—" 
She had gone to throw up again! 
Ou Mucen frowned, finally also opening his door and stepping out. He took some tissues and a bottle of water and stood behind her, "What’s wrong with you? Why did you get so severely ill all of a sudden?" 
Ye Ning didn’t speak, continuing to vomit... 
She didn’t know what was wrong. She only knew that she felt so unwell she thought she might die. 
Indeed, as she knelt there retching, her body suddenly went limp, and she collapsed onto the ground. 
Frightened, Ou Mucen beside her threw the water bottle aside and rushed to catch her, "What’s happened to you? What exactly is going on?"
###Chapter 253: Chapter 253: Her Condition Is Somewhat Serious
However, in just a few short seconds, the woman collapsed there, losing all consciousness. Her eyes shut tight, her lips alarmingly pale and blue, no matter how he called out to her, there was no response whatsoever. 
What on earth happened to her? 
Ou Mucen, witnessing this scene, finally panicked for a moment, casting aside all other concerns, he picked her up from the ground and rushed back to his car. 
"Hey, Chengzhi, are you at the hospital? I have a patient here who needs to be rushed to you immediately." After laying her down in the car, he immediately contacted his good friend, the director of The First People’s Hospital, Ji Chengzhi. noveldrama
Fortunately, Ji Chengzhi was at the hospital at that time, so after restarting the car, he immediately sped towards the downtown area with her. 
Fifteen minutes later, The First People’s Hospital- 
Ji Chengzhi, who had been waiting in the outpatient hall after receiving the call, finally saw the man rushing in with a woman in his arms. He was stunned, "What happened? Why is she unconscious?" 
If he knew, would he still come to find him? 
Ou Mucen, holding the woman in his arms, his face full of agitation, said, "I don’t know, she suddenly became like this..." 
Ji Chengzhi, "..." 
Suddenly became like this? 
She really was a wonder! 
So without saying much more, he motioned with a gesture, signaling a nurse to quickly bring over a stretcher, and together they placed the woman he was holding in his arms onto it before pushing her swiftly towards the emergency room. 
Ou Mucen followed behind, and seeing her wheeled into the examination room, where she was quickly connected to all sorts of medical equipment on her body, her head, and over her heart, he strangely began to feel nervous. 
"Director, her pulse is below 40, very low!" 
"Director, her blood pressure has already dropped below 50mmHg..." 
"Director, the patient has bleeding in her eyes; we preliminarily suspect it’s due to a severe impact!" 
"Director..." 
"..." 
The emergency room in the hospital was always like a battlefield; they didn’t speak idle words. Every phrase was about the patient’s condition. 
Standing there, Ou Mucen listened to what the medical staff were saying; his throat felt dry, and his mind was in disarray, as if he had forgotten where he was, the normally composed and calm man was starting to panic. 
Severe impact? 
When was she struck with such force? What in the world happened?
He looked at the unconscious woman lying on the bed being examined by various machines, and in his state of agitation, he took out a cigarette from his pocket, preparing to light it. 
However, at that moment, Ji Chengzhi, having almost received the results, came out, "You can’t smoke in here!" 
Ou Mucen stiffened for a moment, and reluctantly put the cigarette back. 
Seeing this, Ji Chengzhi then took the folder and stood there, questioning him, "Did she have an accident today?" 
An accident? 
Ou Mucen furrowed his brows, "No, what’s wrong with her?" 
Ji Chengzhi continued writing on the folder, "Did she have any vomiting? Dizziness? Or nosebleeds or anything like that?" 
This time Ou Mucen nodded, "Yes, she was like that when she arrived." 
"Then that’s it, she suffered from a severe head injury, which led to this. I now suspect there’s bleeding inside the skull; take her for a CT scan." 
"..." 
What? 
A CT scan? 
Ou Mucen stood there, staring at him for a full three seconds before reacting, "Is it serious? Does she need that scan?"
###Chapter 254: Chapter 254 He Rarely Cares About Someone So Much
Ji Chengzhi shrugged his shoulders, "Who knows? You’re also aware of the seriousness of a concussion, it can be trivial, meaning there wouldn’t be any issues at all, but on the severe side, it might cost her life. However, why did you bring her in so late? If you had brought her in earlier, she might be in much better shape." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
How was he supposed to know she had been hit? When he saw her this morning, as she rushed to the factory, how could he have known she’d been in an accident? 
Moreover, he hadn’t seen her since they left work yesterday; who could know what had happened to her? 
Ou Mucen frowned as he stared at the woman inside, feeling increasingly upset, "Alright, let’s talk about this later. Take her for a CT scan first, saving her is urgent!" 
Ji Chengzhi nodded and went in to take the woman to the CT room. 
Once the people in the examination room left, the hallway quieted down. Ou Mucen stood there, feeling the restlessness at the pit of his stomach, and finally, he went over to the trash bin, lit the cigarette in his hand, and began to smoke. 
A concussion? 
She had managed to get a concussion in just one night? That was quite the feat. 
But, judging from her reaction earlier, she seemed to have no idea she had injured her brain, or else why would she go to his factory? And why would she not know why she was in such pain? 
The man smoking his cigarette started to furrow his brow tightly, and as he gazed through the thin veil of smoke at the scenery outside the window, after a long while, he took out his phone and dialed a number... 
"Yang Cheng..." 
"Yes, Third Master!" 
"I want to ask, how did Assistant An get to the factory this morning?" 
Assistant An? 
On the other end of the phone, Yang Cheng thought for a moment after hearing the question, "It seems she didn’t come in her own car. Wait a moment, I’ll go ask security." 
After that, footstep sounds could be heard through the phone.
Ou Mucen, hearing this, didn’t hang up the call. He stood there, smoking and waiting. 
About a minute later, Yang Cheng’s voice came through the phone again, "Third Master, I’ve got the information. The security guard said that Assistant An arrived this morning in a private car, a Mazda, silver in color." 
"Did he remember the license plate number?" 
"I’m not sure about that, but Third Master, if you want to know the license plate number, our factory’s entrance is equipped with a surveillance system. We can just review the footage." 
"Alright, find this person immediately, and bring him to me!" After saying that, he hung up the phone. 
If his memory served him correctly, that woman had a car; the day he had asked her to pick him up from Blue Mountain Villa, she had told him that her master had given her a car to use as a means of transport. 
So if she had a car to drive, why would she take someone else’s private car? 
The man who had just finished his cigarette, crushing the butt fiercely into the nearby trash can, then walked towards the hospital chief’s office. 
Half an hour later, outside the office,Ji Chengzhi finally returned... 
"You’re still here? I thought you had left already?" 
Upon opening the door and seeing the man still sitting in his office, Ji Chengzhi was a bit surprised. 
Ou Mucen had just finished a cigarette and, seeing that he had finally returned, immediately fixed his glare on him, "How is it? Is the situation not too bad?" 
Tsk, tsk, tsk! noveldrama
This impatient look was quite uncommon for the esteemed Third Master Ou!
###Chapter 255: Chapter 255: The Man Who Would Rather Die Than Lose Face
Ji Chengzhi went to the coffee machine and poured himself a cup of coffee, "How should I put it, the situation isn’t too bad, although there really is some bleeding in the brain, no surgery is needed, medication will do, but, she has to stay in the hospital for the next few days." 
Ou Mucen let out a sigh of relief... 
Staying in the hospital isn’t an issue, as long as it’s not serious, it’s fine. 
He set down the magazine he was holding, stood up from the sofa, and Ji Chengzhi stopped in his tracks, "Where are you going?" 
Ou Mucen lazily glanced at him and walked towards the door, "Just going out for a walk..." 
Going out for a walk? 
What’s there to see in this hospital? Besides, at this time, does the big CEO Ou have time to "walk around"? noveldrama
Ji Chengzhi squinted his eyes, staring deeply at the man who had gone out and headed towards the VIP ward area... 
Pretentious! 
The VIP ward area of City First People’s Hospital is usually for highly distinguished families or prominent figures, thus, compared to the common wards downstairs, this area offers much more privacy. 
As Ou Mucen made his way over, he noticed the surroundings were not so noisy, and anyone coming to visit had to register before entering, his gaze shifted, and he approached the nurse’s station. 
"Third Young Master Ou..." 
"The woman who was just brought in with a concussion, which room is she in?" 
"Room 19!" 
"Alright, from now on, any visitor must have my permission," he quickly registered his name on the ward card, effectively locking down the visiting rights to that room. 
"Yes, Third Young Master Ou!" 
The nurse, aware of his identity and seeing his actions, naturally had no ions, secured the visiting card, and placed it in the critical care area. 
The person of the Third Young Master Ous simply cannot be casually visited by just anyone; who knows what status they hold, or what their intentions may be? 
Having locked down the visiting rights, Ou Mucen then proceeded forward, heading straight for room 19. 
"Dr. Ma, there shouldn’t be any issues with this patient, right? Why hasn’t she woken up yet?" 
When he reached the door of the room, Ou Mucen overheard the nurse, who still hadn’t left, querying the attending doctor. 
She hasn’t woken up yet? 
He frowned slightly and stepped into the room. 
Inside the room, the doctor and nurse responsible for bringing her in were checking various data on the patient in bed; suddenly hearing footsteps, they turned around, "Third Young Master Ou..." 
"How is she?" Ou Mucen was expressionless as his eyes didn’t look at them but went straight to the woman who had been changed into a hospital gown and lay on the bed. 
She was really thin, something he hadn’t noticed before. Now, dressed in the oversized hospital gown, she seemed like a malnourished child lying there, with only her hospital gown in sight, not her body. 
The doctor, seeing his question, hurriedly answered, "She’s already on medication, but it won’t be so quick for her to wake up. Her brain is still dizzy, she needs the medication to stabilize before she can come around." 
Medication? 
Ou Mucen frowned and glanced at the IV drip hanging from her arm, and was silent for a long time. 
Seeing this, the doctor didn’t dare say more, hurriedly recorded the data, and prepared to leave. 
There was no helping it; this Third Young Master Ou was not an ordinary person. It was said that he was the biggest shareholder of their hospital...
###Chapter 256: Chapter 256: Bizarre Car Accident
He had also heard that his temper was not so good and it was best to minimize contact with him. 
However, just as he reached the doorway, the man who had been standing there frowning at the medicine bottle spoke again, "These next few days, there probably won’t be anyone to take care of her. Go and arrange for someone, find a more competent caregiver to carefully look after her." 
"Yes, Third Young Master!" 
"Furthermore, I don’t want anyone disturbing her!" 
His last sentence carried a considerably sharp tone! 
Upon hearing this, neither the doctor nor the nurse dared say anything more. With a nod, they quickly left the room. 
Indeed, for a man of his status, if it were known that he personally brought this female patient in, surely many busybodies would come over to gossip. 
Thus, his warning was not without reason! 
As soon as the nurse and doctor left, the hospital room fell completely silent. Ou Mucen stood there with his hands in his pockets, wearing a dark green shirt, his frame tall and straight, his handsome profile, and a pair of eyes that no one could decipher, quietly watching the woman lying on the hospital bed... 
Concussion! 
A car accident? 
He remembered the man he had seen half an hour ago in the dean’s office. 
The man was very flustered at the time, it seemed he hadn’t expected that the female driver he had helped take to the city ended up in the hospital due to severe injuries, yet, she was fine at that time. 
"Sir, I swear, when she asked me to take her to the city, she really was alright." The man, standing before him, almost knelt down to him. 
Ou Mucen didn’t speak, his eyes fixed on the few photos on the man’s phone, photos that he had just taken at the accident scene. 
It was indeed a very bizarre car accident, so bizarre that he even thought he had seen a lunatic. 
"Are you saying that at the time of the accident, this Toyota sedan rushed out from inside a white Audi?" 
"Yes, yes, we were all stunned. I mean, who drives like that? The white Audi was making a U-turn, and there was no more road alongside, but the Toyota sedan just sprang out from inside, isn’t that suicidal?"
The man standing before him, upon being questioned about the accident, immediately began describing the scene vividly. 
Ou Mucen finally glanced at it briefly, flicked his fingers a few times, and those photos were then transmitted to another phone... 
"When you rescued this female driver from the car, what was her reaction?" 
"Her? When she was rescued, she was in a semi-conscious state, but after we called out to her a few times, she woke up and then immediately begged us to take her to the city. She said she had urgent matters to handle, and then I brought her here. Sir, believe me, I really was just helping her." 
By the end, the middle-aged man started to plead earnestly again. 
Ou Mucen gave him a cold glance, said nothing further, and had someone take him away directly. 
A bizarre car accident? 
It did surprise him somewhat. He thought that her absence was because she chose not to show up, but he hadn’t expected that it would actually be due to such a strange accident? noveldrama
So does that mean she didn’t go to the factory not because she chose not to, but because she was stopped by someone? 
He thought about the two completely different blood sample reports he received yesterday, his gaze looking down at the woman on the hospital bed grew even more profound...
###Chapter 257: Chapter 257: Third Young Master, what are you going to do to her?
Her face was very pale, because she was in a coma, she no longer displayed her usual quick-wittedness in talking back to him. Instead, she seemed much more obedient at this time. noveldrama
Yet, it was this very obedience that made him, standing by the edge of her bed, think of another face -- a face he had seen countless times in the past few days. 
How could there be such a huge difference? How was this possible? 
He stared at this face and, for reasons unknown, suddenly bent over like he was compelled by some ghostly force, and then his fingers brushed back the strands of hair that fell across her forehead. 
Those websites said that if someone had plastic surgery, the incisions would be made from behind the face, so was she... 
"Third Master, what are you doing?" 
His movement came to an abrupt halt! 
In an instant, the man who was bent over froze as if he had been struck by an acupoint technique. 
Secretary Gao walked in and saw this, his expression as if he had seen a ghost. 
Holy shit! 
President, what are you doing? He had only been away for three days; had their relationship already progressed so suddenly? 
"Third Master..." 
"Since when have you become so unversed in the protocols? Don’t you know to knock before entering?" 
As if shocked by electricity, the man who finally came back to his senses, with a slightly flushed face, harshly dropped this line and withdrew his hand. 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
What kind of people were these? The door wasn’t even closed; did it make any difference whether he knocked or not? 
However, since the president had said as much, he could only symbolically knock again before entering with the documents in his hand: "Third Master, I’ve found the license plate you asked me to check. It belongs to a vehicle of Tianyu Company." 
"Tianyu Company?" 
"Yes, a trading company. But you might be a bit surprised by the legal representative." 
"Who?" 
"Lin Yebai!" 
"..." 
Surprised?
No, he wasn’t surprised at all. That car accident, one could tell at first glance it was man-made. If he remembered correctly, on the road where the accident occurred, there were three intersections where one could have turned back to the city, but she didn’t turn back until she reached the last one, facing the highway overpass, and it was then that the unthinkable accident happened. What did that indicate? 
It indicated that someone had intentionally tried to prevent her from returning. So, who was the most likely person to do this? 
Of course, the first suspect was her closely associated master -- Lin Yebai. 
It seemed, this matter was getting more intriguing by the minute. 
He flipped through the materials he had brought, and at last, after seeing the name "Lin Yebai" written on the photocopy, he handed back the documents: "After the accident, was he seen at the scene?" 
"He wasn’t, but I reckon that the police won’t be able to find out this information, because I only managed to learn that the car belonged to Lin Yebai through many connections." 
Secretary Gao was also surprised when he uncovered this information, as he knew that Lin Yebai was this woman’s master. If he was her master, why would he have someone hit her? It made no sense. 
Ou Mucen was also somewhat taken aback, but he wasn’t surprised that the car belonged to Lin Yebai. What surprised him was, if the two really had conspired together, why would such an accident take place in the end. 
Clearly, this bizarre car accident was a result of a conflict in opinions between the two of them. 
So, was she trying to save his company, while that man had arranged all this to stop her?
###Chapter 258: Chapter 258: He Wonders What She Is Going to Do?
The man standing there, recalling what the middle-aged driver had said to him in the office, finally frowned slightly before saying, "Burn it. Let’s pretend we know nothing about this." 
What? 
Burn it? 
Secretary Gao did not quite understand, "Do you mean... we are not going to look into this matter anymore?" 
Is there still a need to investigate? The truth has come to light, what else is there to investigate? 
If we must talk about investigating, then it would be to investigate what exactly they are trying to do, sparing no effort to come by his side, seizing an opportunity to severely harm him, Ou Mucen. But at the critical moment, they came back, stopping it all. Doesn’t that seem very suspicious? 
Ou Mucen stared expressionless at the woman lying in the hospital bed: "No need to investigate anymore. From today on, you help me with another matter." 
"What matter?" 
"Look into the jade raw stone exorbitant fraud case from five years ago!" 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
The exorbitant fraud case? 
Isn’t that the adopted daughter he just met in Ningzhou, who is still serving her sentence? What’s gotten into the president? Why is he suddenly so interested in this adopted daughter? 
First, he had him go to Ningzhou in person, devising ways to obtain her blood sample, and now he’s asking him to investigate a case from five years ago. What is he trying to do? 
Secretary Gao was very confused... 
However, after his master said just that, he left the hospital room. Seeing this, Secretary Gao could only follow helplessly. noveldrama
The exorbitant fraud case from five years ago! 
To tell the truth, he hadn’t really believed back then, that an under 19-year-old girl could have done such a thing... 
——
When Lin Yebai got the news, it was already an hour later. Hearing that the job hadn’t been done and the person had even been hit, he flew into a rage, grabbed the teacup on the desk, and hurled it fiercely: "Who told you to hit her? A bunch of incompetents!" 
The teacup smashed over, and no one dared to dodge, so immediately, there were "patter, patter" sounds continuously dripping in the living room. 
Assistant Xiaojin was frightened and didn’t dare to dissuade him until the master stood up from the chair, preparing to go out. Only then did he muster the courage to approach, "Sir, you absolutely cannot show up at this time. If you do, everything will be exposed!" 
"Move aside!" 
"Sir, please think this through. If you go there now, and Miss An sees you, with her intelligence, she will definitely know that everything is arranged by you. What will she think then? Sir, have you thought about it?" 
The last sentence finally stopped the man who was about to step out of the living room. 
Yes, if that girl finds out about this, and everything was done by him, has he considered the consequences? 
No, he had not. Not because he didn’t want to, but because he dared not! 
That girl, although saved by him, he had tried his best to help her over the years, but she was not an , nor was she his private property, she was a person. If she knew how dominantly and arrogantly he was controlling her, she wouldn’t like it. 
But does she really know nothing at all? 
Maybe not. That girl has always been clever. They bungled this job so badly, how could she not see through it? Otherwise, she wouldn’t have used such an extreme method to crash that car there. 
Thinking this, his face growing paler, his lips trembled and he snapped harshly, "Keep a close watch on those few, I’ll deal with them when I get back!"
###Chapter 259: Chapter 259: He Can’t Possibly Let Him Find Her
Lin Yebai searched the downtown area for a full two hours but couldn’t find Ye Ning. 
The situation was actually quite simple; after he arrived at the car accident scene, he found the traffic police and the nearby people and learned that she had been taken back to the city by a middle-aged driver in a Mazda. 
Afterward, he went to that factory. 
Of course, he knew that she was in a hurry to have that driver take her to the city, and he knew where she was going and what for. 
But when he got to the factory, the people there told him that Assistant An had already left, along with the president. 
Left with the president? 
He sat in his car, stunned for a moment! 
Why did she leave with him? Had he discovered her already? 
No, that couldn’t be. This affair, she orchestrated so secretly that the man would have been unable to find out, and even if she were late, it would just be a delay; he couldn’t have discovered anything else. 
So, his heart finally began to ease slightly, "You all didn’t have any problems today, did you?" 
The security guard shook his head, "No issues at all. Who are you? Are you looking for Assistant An for something?" 
"Nothing, I’m her friend. I heard she works here and just came by to see how she’s doing. She’s okay, right?" 
"She’s fine, Assistant An is doing well, don’t worry." The security guard’s smile was sincere, and it was impossible to tell if he was lying. 
Upon seeing this, Lin Yebai finally drove away from there... 
Her skills? 
With such a severe collision, could she really be okay? 
He looked ahead, his hands gripping the steering wheel turning pale, never relaxing. 
It was a truly horrible feeling; even though he had not heard any news of her being in an accident now, that car crash still produced a tremendous shock in his heart. 
He had never imagined that when he pushed her to the limit, she would resist in such a way!noveldrama
So, was her leaving with that man back to the company also because she didn’t want to see him? 
He sat in the car, and in an instant, it felt as though a thorn had grown inside him, ceaselessly stirring, leaving his heart unsettled, terribly agitated, and even, with a tinge of regret. 
---- 
Ye Ning was in a coma for a whole day before waking up, and by the time she did, it was already evening. 
Upon opening her eyes and seeing the stark white ceiling above, and the simple yet gentle hanging light, she was momentarily taken aback. Her newly awakened mind took a long time to understand where exactly she was. 
Not until someone beside her noticed she’d woken up and approached, "You’re awake? Do you feel any discomfort anywhere?" 
She turned her head and then saw a middle-aged nurse dressed in light green scrubs. 
"You are...?" 
"I’m a caretaker here. You’ve been unconscious for a full day. The doctor said it’s best you don’t move, or you might experience nausea and dizziness again," the caretaker spoke gently, likely a result of many years in this work environment. 
Hearing this, Ye Ning remembered what happened before she lost consciousness. She blinked and sipped the water the caretaker handed her, then continued to ask, "So, this is a hospital?" 
"Yes, the First People’s Hospital. You have a concussion!" 
A concussion? 
Ye Ning was stunned for a moment! 
She actually had a concussion? How come she didn’t realize it? 
But soon, as she recalled her symptoms before the accident and the crash itself, she understood. 
So that was the symptom of a concussion; no wonder she felt so unwell all of a sudden.
###Chapter 260: Chapter 260: Ou Mucen, did you pick up my son?
So she stopped asking that question, and after glancing around, she suddenly asked, "What time is it now?" 
The caregiver hurriedly checked the watch on her wrist, "It’s past eight o’clock." 
My God! 
Past eight? Then her child... 
Ye Ning thought of Xiaobao, who had been sent to the kindergarten in the morning, and suddenly became so anxious that she tried to sit up in bed. But as soon as she moved, just like the caregiver had said, she felt dizzy, as if the world was spinning, and she fell back heavily onto the bed. 
"Don’t move, didn’t I tell you that you can’t move? Doing this will make your condition worse," the caregiver said anxiously, rushing over to hold her down, determined not to let her get out of bed. 
But Ye Ning was in a panic; she had been unconscious in the hospital for a whole day, so what about her child? What about Xiaobao? He was still at the kindergarten. 
Ye Ning was both anxious and uncomfortable, working herself into a sweat! 
Lying in bed, not knowing what to do, there came from outside the ward the sound of "click-clack, click-clack", very rhythmic footsteps... 
Upon hearing this, the caregiver immediately let go of her arms and stood at the side of the bed, waiting for the person from outside to come in. 
Indeed, when the footsteps reached the door, the person stopped. So Ye Ning also looked towards the door direction, and before long, she heard the ward door being twisted open from the outside with a "click", and a tall and straight figure appeared there. 
"What are you doing?" 
"Third Young Master, you’re here. Miss An wants to get up, we don’t know what she’s trying to do?" 
Seeing the man finally appearing at the door, the caregiver in the ward breathed a sigh of relief and quickly informed him about Ye Ning’s request to get out of bed. 
As soon as the words were spoken, the man at the door’s good-looking brows instantly darkened: "Why are you getting up? Don’t you know that you can’t get out of bed yet?" 
Ye Ning had moved just a moment ago, and her head was still dizzy. Seeing him standing at the door, there was only a blurred double image. 
"Ou Mucen, where’s Xiaobao? Did you go to pick him up for me?" noveldrama
"..." 
She asked him to pick up her son? 
The man at the door was for a moment a bit taken aback. 
Were they that familiar? She was asking him to pick up her son, as if he were her servant! 
But, devilishly, after hearing her words, Mucen, who should have been enraged, didn’t get angry this time, and, in fact, he even seemed to be in a good mood: "No, your master has already picked him up." 
Master? 
Ye Ning was stunned! 
Lin Yebai? 
He had taken Xiaobao away? 
Yes, he would have, considering the severity of the incident today. He must have guessed that she knew it was his doing and would worry that she wouldn’t return to Tang Garden, so he surely must have picked up Xiaobao first and taken him home. That was the only way she would go over there herself. 
At that thought, Ye Ning’s eyes finally closed tightly... 
Ou Mucen remained standing there, looking at her. Seeing that the woman lying in the hospital bed didn’t speak after he said those words, and after turning pale, her eyes closed forcefully. 
Her expression seemed to be pained! 
What was she thinking about? 
Was she thinking about her current situation with that man? 
He withdrew his gaze, walked over to the small table in the ward, and seeing a plate of fresh fruit on it, he picked up one and began to peel it with the fruit knife.
###Chapter 261: Chapter 261: Do you want me to keep you company here all night?
"So, does my master know I’m hospitalized?"
She spoke up again while he was halfway through peeling, still lying on the hospital bed behind him. 
Master? 
Of course, he would not let him know! 
He bowed his head to look at the apple, his slender fingers with distinct joints continued without stopping, "I haven’t mentioned it yet, it’s your matter to decide. If you want him to know, I can notify him right now." 
"No, no need!" 
Ye Ning, lying on the bed, almost without thinking, immediately refused the suggestion. 
She didn’t want him to know that she was hospitalized now. She needed to calm down, her mind was really in chaos, she hadn’t yet figured out how to meet him, nor had she figured out how to ask about this matter. 
Having heard this, Ou Mucen didn’t look at her expression. He continued peeling the apple, intending to cut it into small slices and put it on the plate, but after looking, he realized he didn’t know how to cut it. 
This was the consequence of always having everything handed to him! 
While Ye Ning was still thinking about this on the bed, she suddenly realized that the man in the ward had been standing next to the small table for a long time. She turned her head and looked over, "What are you doing?" 
Ou Mucen’s knife slipped, and half of the apple was gone! 
"Nothing, just pouring some water to drink, would you like some?" With a toss of his hand, he threw both the fruit and the knife into the trash can beside him. 
Ye Ning’s concussion hadn’t healed yet, and her vision wasn’t very clear, so at this moment she couldn’t see clearly what he was doing. Hearing him ask if she wanted water, she refused, "No, I’m not thirsty. The nursing aide gave me a drink when you came." 
So that saved pouring the water... noveldrama
After staying in the ward for a while, Ou Mucen saw that it was getting late and prepared to leave, "I’ll be going now. Rest well, and if you need anything, you can call the nursing aide from before." 
Ye Ning was still immersed in her thoughts when she suddenly heard him say he was leaving. Like a reflex, she blurted out, "That’s it?" 
The man getting ready to leave heard this and then casually glanced at her from the foot of her bed, "Do you expect me to accompany you the whole night?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Suddenly, she covered her face with the blanket, burying her whole person inside! 
What had she just said? 
How could she say such a thing? And to suggest him to stay with her all night! That jerk, doesn’t he understand a slip of the tongue?!! 
Not daring to look at him anymore, she hid under the blanket until his footsteps receded out of the room; only then did she let herself out from near suffocation under the covers. 
Once she emerged, the nursing aide came in and saw her face all red, she was very surprised, "Miss An, what’s the matter with you? Why is your face so red all of a sudden?" 
Hurriedly waving her hand, Ye Ning said, "It’s nothing, it’s nothing. Oh, right, when I came here, I brought a bag with me. Is it still here?" 
"Yes, it’s kept in the cupboard right there, I’ll get it for you!" 
The nursing aide went to the cupboard and brought her bag over. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning took the bag from her, opened it, and pulled out her cell phone. 
Face-to-face, perhaps not yet, but a phone call had to be made. Otherwise, with the child at his place, and her not going over till so late, he would definitely become restless. He might even go to the Ou Corporation to look for her again. 
So she lay there, found the number, and dialed it... 
The call connected, and quickly, someone picked up on the other end, "Aning..."
###Chapter 262: Chapter 262: In this world, only he knows whose child this is!
"Brother Lin, is Xiaobao with you?" Ye Ning tried to keep her voice calm, and to act as if nothing had happened. 
When Lin Yebai heard this, he got so excited that he stood up: "Yes, I’ve picked him up. Aning, where are you? I called you many times, but you didn’t answer, and there was no one at the apartment? Are you still at the company?" 
He was indeed very eager, as if he couldn’t wait to be by her side immediately. 
He called many times? 
Ye Ning remembered that her phone had no signal earlier, so she naturally responded, "My phone had no signal, I didn’t hear your calls. Brother Lin, I’m still at the factory. We have a big shipment coming up and it’s really busy here." 
The factory? 
Was she still at the factory? 
Like a reflex, Lin Yebai went to grab his keys from the desk, ready to leave. 
However, over the phone, after the girl finished speaking, she quickly added another sentence: "Brother Lin, I might stay here tonight. There’s a problem with a product, and we need to work overtime." 
"What? You’re going to stay there?" 
"Yes, after overtime, it’ll probably be around midnight, so I won’t be going back. Besides, Xiaobao is with you, don’t worry. There are staff dormitories here, it’s very safe." Ye Ning added this specifically to reassure him. 
Hearing this, the man who had walked to the door of Tang Garden finally stopped in his tracks. 
She was going to stay there? To work overtime for that man’s factory? 
Why didn’t he believe her words? 
But what could he do if he didn’t believe her? Since she had said those words, it meant she didn’t want to come back. So where was her real destination? 
Could it be that she was with that man? 
Standing there, holding his phone and staring at the twinkling stars above him, it took him a very long time before he weakly put the phone down... 
What was this feeling? 
Betrayal? noveldrama
Actually, not really. She hadn’t done anything wrong, so how could it be betrayal? If anything, his actions today had contributed to the gap between them. 
But wasn’t her purpose in coming back to take revenge? He had simply helped her after learning of her plans, what was wrong with that? 
Could it be that she had truly developed feelings for that man? 
No, that couldn’t be possible. That man was her enemy’s man! 
He clenched his phone tightly, feeling a sort of unease he had never experienced before... 
Just then, behind him, a small figure came out holding a fruit plate. Seeing uncle standing there, the little figure called out in a child’s voice, "Uncle Lin, are you going out?" 
It was Xiaobao! 
Lin Yebai turned around and saw the child standing in the light, holding a plate, looking carved out of pink jade, and suddenly, his eyes fell on the child’s delicate but very exquisite features. 
He really looked like her, his facial features resembled his mother’s original appearance, but his eyebrows and temperament were exactly like his father’s. 
Handsome, aloof, noble... 
Even the way he held himself was exactly the same. 
That’s right, he had forgotten, there was this connection between them... 
Finally, Lin Yebai’s pupils shrank sharply, and he crouched down in front of the child: "Xiaobao, can you tell uncle about the time you went to that uncle’s apartment?"
###Chapter 263: Chapter 263: Xiaobao, is your mom close to that uncle?
Apartment? 
That uncle’s apartment? 
The four-year-old child hadn’t yet understood what the uncle in front of him meant. 
"Uncle Lin, which uncle are you talking about? When did I go to an apartment?" 
"Apartment..." 
Lin Yebai suddenly realized that the child might not know what an ’apartment’ was, so he switched the way he spoke, "It’s like the last time when you were in the hospital, and uncle and mom couldn’t rush back in time, then your mom’s boss took you out to eat and brought you to his home." 
Oh! 
So it was that! 
Ye Xiaobao understood, but why was Uncle Lin asking about this? Was he now suspecting that Mom and Uncle Bingshan had some connections? 
Ye Xiaobao began to hesitate. Uncle Lin liked Mom, he knew that. If he told this uncle about what happened that day at Uncle Bingshan’s house with Mom, would he get very angry? 
Forget it, it’s better not to mention it, he didn’t want to see Mom and Uncle Lin unhappy. 
So he pursed his small lips, pretending to think for a while, "I remember now, that day the uncle took me to his house, because I accidentally fell into the water, and he brought me to his house." 
"Fell into water?" 
"Yeah, when that uncle took me out, I went to play and accidentally fell into the water, then the uncle might have been afraid my mom would scold me, so he brought me home, and he let me go once my clothes were dry." 
The four-year-old child, with his baby voice and his small face, was also filled with innocence and cuteness. From any angle, it was clear he wasn’t lying. 
Moreover, the words he spoke at this time were very childlike. 
Afraid that his mom would scold him, so he brought him home to change clothes? 
This sounded ridiculous and laughable, but for a child, it was quite normal. 
Lin Yebai didn’t know whether to believe it or not. Bending down, he picked him up and held him in his arms, "After your mom arrived, did she scold that uncle?" 
"She didn’t scold, but instead that uncle scolded Mom." 
"He scolded your mom?" 
"Yeah, Uncle Lin, let me tell you, that Uncle Bingshan is really bad, he always bullies Mom, and he has a really bad temper. Even when he’s in the wrong, he still blames others. Mom even said to see him less in the future." 
"Is that so?" noveldrama
"Of course, and Uncle Lin, it’s better to let Mom come back and work here with you in the future. I don’t want to see her getting bullied by him all the time!" 
The little child, whom he held in his arms at that moment, with bright, clear eyes and a chubby innocent face, it was hard for anyone to doubt or question him anymore. 
Lin Yebai suddenly felt very awkward and somewhat ashamed as he bowed his head and carried him inside, "Alright, Uncle Lin will persuade your mom, let’s have her come back, okay?" 
"Okay, so when is Mom coming back tonight?" 
"She said she wouldn’t come back, she has to work late. How about we go see her tomorrow?" 
"Okay..." 
"..." 
---- 
Ye Ning slept very soundly that night, not because of her sleep habits, but after she made that call, the nurse had given her a tranquilizer injection, just so that her brain could rest well and recover faster. 
So she slept from that time on until almost ten o’clock in the morning, when she slowly woke up. 
"You’re awake?" 
The moment she opened her eyes, she saw Secretary Gao standing in front of her bed.
###Chapter 264: Chapter 264: The Sparrow Stalks Behind
Why is he here? 
Ye Ning was somewhat startled and wanted to sit up from the hospital bed, but as soon as she moved, he came over and stopped her, "Alright, you better not move. Get well soon so you can return to the company sooner. Everyone there is overwhelmed." 
Secretary Gao really isn’t courteous when he speaks! 
Seeing this, Ye Ning could only continue to lie down, "Why would you come here? The company is so busy." 
Secretary Gao felt helpless, "What can I do? Our CEO asked me to come and see you, so I had to come. An Ning, let me tell you, you are the first person I’ve seen the CEO care so much about since I joined the company. What kind of ’love potion’ have you given him? Why is he so good to you?" 
Ye Ning’s face turned red all at once, "What are you talking about? What ’love potion’? I’ve had a work-related injury, can’t a boss be concerned about that? Be careful or I’ll sue him for employee abuse!" 
Work-related injury? 
Does she have no shame? Can she really call that injury work-related? 
Secretary Gao felt like splashing her face with the truth, but seeing her lying on the hospital bed, he held back, "Alright, alright, it’s a work-related injury. So, do you feel any better now?" 
"Not better!" Ye Ning said irritably. 
Seeing this, Secretary Gao laughed, "Still angry? Alright, I was just joking with you. But this car accident of yours is also quite strange. How could there be a car coming out from behind like that? It’s clear someone wanted to kill you! Do you have a grudge against someone?" 
As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Ning, lying on the bed, jolted! noveldrama
"Me? Have any enemies? Maybe that driver couldn’t drive properly?" 
"Really? If that’s the case, then the driving school that issued his license is in trouble. To teach such an idiot driver and still give him a license." Secretary Gao said these words with a semblance of a smile, then turned around and poured her a glass of water. 
Ye Ning watched his retreating figure, thought of another matter, and hesitated before asking, "Then... how is the jade from the factory doing?" 
The jade? 
Secretary Gao brought the water over, "I’ve already notified the Huo Family about the jade. They said it might be a wrong delivery." 
"Is that so?" Ye Ning took the glass of water, her gaze pondering as she lowered her head.
In fact, she wasn’t very clear about how that jade came to be. When she had plotted this conspiracy, she only knew that Yang Xueshan, that woman, would definitely be able to carry out this affair. But as for how the fake jade actually appeared, she truly didn’t know. 
So now, with Secretary Gao’s response like this, was he saying... the Huo Family had admitted to this matter? 
This was somewhat unbelievable! 
She took a sip of water, warm and normally comforting, but for some reason, after drinking it, she found it tasteless and uncomfortable, just like her mood at the moment. 
Anxious and hung up on various things! 
Secretary Gao didn’t stay long before he left. After he left, the hospital room became quiet again. Ye Ning hadn’t slept for the entire night before, and the doctor hadn’t given her a sedative, so for a long period of time, she was half-lying on the bed lost in her thoughts. 
Thinking about the Huo Family’s affair and considering the problems she would have to face next... 
What she did not know was that while she was lost in her thoughts, in the CEO’s office on the fifteenth floor of the Ou Shi Building, the boss of the Huo Family, standing in the vast office, facing the man sitting opposite him like a king, was almost crying! 
"Third Young Master, believe me, I really didn’t intend to provide you with fake goods. I swear, the goods that came out of my factory were a hundred percent real."
###Chapter 265: Chapter 265: She Really Treats Him Like a Servant
"Really? Then why did the goods in my factory turn out to be counterfeit?" 
The man, who had been expressionless all along, instilled fear with even a glance. His dark eyes and emotionless face were like the impending, darkest night, hiding danger and bloodlust within them. 
The legs of the Huo Family boss were shaking; had he not been holding onto the table, he likely would have collapsed to the ground. 
"Young Master, I beg you to give me some time. I will definitely get to the bottom of this. Even if I were to scheme against anyone, I would never dare to scheme against you, Young Master!" That last plea was sincerely desperate. 
The man seated at the office desk noted that at last, the cold stare he had been fixing on him had retracted. 
He casually opened a pack of cigarettes, took one out, lit it up, and blew out a perfect smoke ring. Only then did he look at him again, devoid of expression, "Fine, since you want a chance, I’ll give you one. But remember, if you can’t give me a response regarding this matter, I will ensure the Huo Family is ruined and completely wiped from this industry!" 
"Yes, yes, yes... I will find out what happened, thank you so much, Young Master, for giving me this chance!" 
The Huo Family boss left the office utterly grateful and in tears. 
The moment the Huo Family boss left, Secretary Gao returned. Seeing his boss inside, he entered, "Young Master, does the Huo Family still deny that there was a problem with their goods?" 
"Hmm!" 
The man at the office desk responded indifferently with a "Hmm."
Secretary Gao, puzzled, said, "If that is the case, then why did you ask me to tell An Ning that the Huo Family had already admitted it? Does this matter have something to do with her?" 
Suspicion? 
Was there any need to suspect? He intended to investigate; he was just a bit curious as to how she managed to do it, that’s all. 
The man held the cigarette between two fingers but did not answer the question. Instead, he asked, "How is she recovering?" 
Secretary Gao promptly answered, "Not bad, she should be able to leave the hospital tomorrow." 
"Hmm, don’t spread word of this matter around..." 
Just as he was about to delegate a few more tasks, suddenly, the mobile phone on his desk rang. He picked it up and saw a string of numbers without a name... 
Why is she calling? 
Seeing the string of numbers, his brows furrowed, and then with an impatient look, he answered the call, "..." 
"Hello? Ou Mucen, where are you right now? My master has gone to the factory looking for me, can you help me out?" 
Before he could even speak, the woman’s voice on the phone rushed through, carrying a hint of urgency and a touch of frenzy. 
The factory? 
Why would her master go to the factory looking for her? 
Could it be... she didn’t want to tell him about her hospitalization yesterday, and the excuse she used was that she was working overtime at his factory? 
The astoundingly clever man immediately understood her meaning and couldn’t help but be ironic, "Are you sick? What does your master going to the factory to look for you have to do with me? Am I your servant? Here to run your errands?" noveldrama
"No, no, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is, could you... maybe make a call to Manager Yang? Just tell him to inform my master that I am not at the factory anymore, that I’ve gone out to meet clients with you." 
That last request, by the end, her voice was as slight as a mosquito’s.
###Chapter 266: Chapter 266: He Wished He Could Crush Her to Death!
Not bad at all, bossing him around was one thing, but she even took him out as a human shield. The Ou Family, he still didn’t know, had produced such a character. 
The man seated in the office chair, seething with rage, actually laughed, "Or should I personally make a trip to the factory?"
"Ah? Ah... no need, no need! I..." 
"I think it would be better if I personally visited. Otherwise, what if it delays Miss An’s matters?" noveldrama
"..." 
There was no sound from the phone anymore, only the sound of labored breathing coming through faintly, which, after about three seconds, ended with the line going dead... 
Damn woman! 
She even dared to order him around? Had she forgotten who she was? Daring to have him clean up her mess. 
As soon as the call ended, he immediately revealed his true colors, tossing his phone away, his face darkening as if someone owed him billions. 
Secretary Gao watched with heart-pounding trepidation... 
Good Lord, what in the world happened? A single phone call immediately brought storm clouds here. Why doesn’t that woman just drop dead? 
Forget it, better for him to leave now, to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. 
So, he tiptoed, looking for a chance to slip away, but right then, from the icy atmosphere behind him, came an abrupt and stiff question, "Where are you going?" 
Secretary Gao immediately froze: "I... I..." 
"I," he stuttered for ages, but a smooth sentence did not emerge. 
The man sitting behind the desk saw this and his face grew even uglier, "All useless! Make a call to Yang Cheng, tell him that during the factory’s mass production period, no one is allowed within one kilometer of the area!" 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
One kilometer? 
Why? It’s just a factory producing products, is such tight security really necessary? 
Secretary Gao was bewildered for a moment, "Young Master, our jewelry factory’s security system is already very strict, do we really need to extend the defense perimeter to one kilometer out?" 
The man, in an extremely foul mood, immediately hurled a pen, "Are you the president, or am I the president? Who has the final say, you or me?" 
You have the final say, you are the boss, you are capricious!! 
Secretary Gao ran faster than a rabbit... 
—— 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, after making the call that was rejected and being thoroughly scolded, gripped her phone, lying there for a long while before finally deciding to get up by herself and go to the factory nearby to meet Lin Yebai. 
Indeed, that man was right. What right did she have to ask for his help? 
He was the lofty third young master of the Ou Family, and she was just an insignificant woman. The fact that he had taken her to this hospital after her injury, and had not further pursued the matter, was already a great kindness to her. 
Thinking this, she took advantage of the caregiver’s absence to really sneak out of bed quietly. 
Thankfully, after a day and night of treatment, the dizziness and vertigo were much better than the day before. Although she felt a bit faint and weak when getting up, she no longer felt like collapsing immediately. 
After getting up, she found her clothes, changed, and while no one was paying attention, she stealthily slipped out of the ward and went straight downstairs. 
She had to see Lin Yebai. If that man wouldn’t help her, she had no choice but to meet him, otherwise, if it was discovered at the factory that she was not really there, he would get angry for being deceived. 
And she didn’t want him to get angry, nor did she want their relationship to worsen any further.
###Chapter 267: Chapter 267: She Went to See Him Despite Being Sick
Descending from the hospital wing, her clouded mind kept pondering what exactly she should say when they met. 
She truly was grateful to him. She had been an orphan since the age of six when her parents met with an accident, and from the moment she was sent to the orphanage, she hadn’t experienced the warmth of a family again. 
Even later, when Mei Liping went to the orphanage to adopt her, she knew they didn’t truly want to adopt her for who she was, they were just interested in her eyes, which could bring about the rise of the second branch of the Ou Family. 
It was he who, in the darkest and most desperate five years of her life, gave her hope and helped her stand again, taking care of her like she was family, and protecting her. She would never forget the kindness he and his mother had shown her. 
So, even this time, with his excessive actions, she still didn’t want to fall out with him; she yearned so much for the warmth of having a family. 
After leaving the hospital, she hailed a taxi and got in, then took out her phone and dialed: "Hello, Brother Lin, have you arrived at the factory yet?" 
"Not yet, but I’ll be there soon. Have you come out yet?" Lin Yebai’s voice was calm on the other end of the phone. 
Hearing this, Ye Ning fought the dizziness in the car: "I’m at the entrance but it’s not convenient to meet outside the factory. How about this, there’s a coffee shop nearby called Rhine Mansion, I’ll wait for you there? 
"Okay!" 
Lin Yebai agreed. 
Upon seeing this, Ye Ning finally took a deep breath, and then, following a bout of nausea, she leaned weakly against the back of the seat. 
The taxi driver, seeing this, expressed concern: "Miss, are you alright? You look very pale." 
Ye Ning half-closed her eyes, shaking her head in discomfort: "I’m fine, please just drive..." 
Yes, even if something was wrong, she would persevere, just needing to get over this obstacle. 
After hearing this, the driver didn’t ask further and sped on, quickly arriving near the factory she mentioned. 
"Strange, why can’t we go through here? Miss, I need to take a detour." As soon as the car arrived near the factory, the driver had intended to drive straight there, but found that the road that was originally open had been blocked by that factory, forcing him to turn around and go the other way. 
Ye Ning, sitting in the car, didn’t pay attention to this. She was suffering significant dizziness, as a concussion patient shouldn’t be in a car or using other forms of transportation, as it could worsen the condition. 
Therefore, in her dizzy state, she didn’t hear what he was saying until he finally reached the destination and stopped the car, and only then did she muster the strength to get out. 
"Miss, are you sure you’re okay?" 
"I’m fine!" 
Before getting out of the car, the driver, noticing her increasingly pale complexion, asked again, not reassured. 
But Ye Ning just shook her head, paid the fare, and then entered the coffee shop. 
Fortunately, Lin Yebai hadn’t arrived at the coffee shop yet, so she quickly went to the restroom to vomit the nausea she’d been suppressing, which made her feel a bit more comfortable. Then she faced the mirror and put on a light makeup. 
With makeup, he wouldn’t notice. 
After tidying herself up, the person she was due to meet had already come in, so as soon as she stepped out, she saw the refined man in a dark gray crewneck sweater, inquiring with the server about her. 
"Excuse me, do you have a Miss An Ning who came in here?"noveldrama
###Chapter 268: Chapter 268: Who is she to him, after all?
"An Ning..." 
"Brother Lin, I’m here." 
She stood there, interrupting the waiter’s speech, with a light smile as she called out, her voice gentle and cheery, just like every time they had met before. 
Lin Yebai paused for a moment, then turned his head and saw the girl standing not far away. She was wearing a pinkish-lotus-colored cotton-linen dress, slender and tall, her skin fair and clear, her features delicate. Even her smile at that moment seemed like a warm spring breeze, bright and comforting, showing no sign of anger at all. 
So, she wasn’t blaming him? 
Seeing such a smile, Lin Yebai suddenly felt a huge relief in his heart and hurried over. He stood in front of her, "Aning, are you okay? I looked for you all day yesterday." 
The moment he spoke, his concern and urgency were undisguised. 
Ye Ning shook her head as she looked at him, "I’m fine. I’m really sorry, my phone had no signal all day yesterday, and then I was busy with the factory. I left my bag in the office and didn’t hear it ringing. My apologies." 
"It’s okay, it’s okay, as long as you’re fine!" 
Lin Yebai quickly assured her he was fine, but in truth, he was more anxious and uncertain than she was. 
Yes, someone who has done wrong always feels uneasy. 
After greeting each other, the two found a place to sit in the café. Ye Ning ordered a lemon water, while Lin Yebai ordered his usual favorite, Blue Mountain coffee. 
"Aning, I came here specifically to explain what happened yesterday." 
Unexpectedly, after the coffee was served, Ye Ning sitting across him heard him say just that. 
Explanation? 
He came here to explain to her? 
Ye Ning’s fingers paused as they held the straw...
"I know you’ve realized that the car that blocked you yesterday was sent by me. Yes, I admit it was my doing. But Aning, I was just trying to help you. You’re too soft-hearted, and if you can’t be ruthless at critical moments, your revenge will never be accomplished." noveldrama
"..." 
Sitting there, Ye Ning held the straw and for a long, long time, she couldn’t utter a single word. 
What kind of feeling was this? 
The feeling that she’s a child and he’s the parent, who in the end, regardless of the child’s decisions, takes control? No, worse than that. It was as though she was no longer herself, but merely a kite or an in his hands, and what he did with her, what he arranged for her, all seemed so taken for granted. 
So she didn’t speak but mechanically stirred her straw for a long time before finally asking, "How did you know I was going to take action?" 
"That’s simple. A third-rate jade factory suddenly bought several tons of jade—it’s not hard to guess." 
"So you went to investigate it?" 
"Yes, it was Yang Xueshan who bought it. I naturally thought of you. I didn’t want to interfere at first; I was just worried that you might be afraid since it was your first time, so I decided to give you a hand." 
Lin Yebai didn’t feel he had done anything wrong in this matter. If there was any mistake, it was that he hadn’t discussed it with her beforehand. But then, she also hadn’t told him about it from the start. 
Besides, he still wanted to ask her why she had suddenly changed her mind. 
Lin Yebai took a sip of his coffee and saw that the girl sitting opposite him hadn’t said much. Her eyes were fixed on something outside the window...
###Chapter 269: Chapter 269: Mucen, Your Patient Has Gone Missing...
"Aning, how did you suddenly change your mind yesterday?" 
"Nothing much, I just realized that Ou Mucen didn’t seem to trust that batch of jade stones and felt it wasn’t the right time, so I changed my mind," Ye Ning replied indifferently. 
She suddenly felt scared because everything she had planned, which she had thought was unnoticed, was as clear as day to him; he knew everything, while she had always been kept in the dark. 
Just like a pawn on his chessboard! 
This feeling was truly terrifying! 
A chill crept up her spine, and the fingertips that held her cup turned ice cold... 
However, on hearing her explanation, Lin Yebai felt the worry that had been hanging over him finally subside. 
So that was the reason! 
He was relieved then. As long as she hadn’t given up because she couldn’t bear to hurt that man, then everything was fine. 
Having received a satisfactory answer and because he had other matters to attend to, he planned to take his leave, "In that case, we’ll find another suitable opportunity next time. Ou Mucen is indeed very suspicious. Don’t worry, I’ll find the right moment for you." 
"Mm," Ye Ning nodded without much expression. 
Seeing that, Lin Yebai said nothing more, and after telling her that Ye Xiaobao had been sent to the kindergarten and had a rather good night, he took his car keys and left. 
Ye Ning sat there, blankly staring at his retreating figure for a long time, then suddenly yelled at a waiter behind her, "Please bring me a cup of water, hot water, scalding hot water..." 
So cold! 
It felt like her whole body was chilled to the core, just like that year when she stayed in that dark, sunless room, truly freezing to death... 
— 
Ou Mucen received a call from Ji Chengzhi in the afternoon, informing him that the woman had disappeared. 
Disappeared? 
What did that mean? Was she dead? Or had she run away? 
He was known for his bad temper, and generally, no good words came out of his mouth when he received such news. 
Ji Chengzhi, aware of his temper over the phone, patiently explained, "She must have sneaked out. The nurse went to get medicine around 11 o’clock in the morning and found her gone." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
o’clock in the morning?
Wasn’t that the time when she called him? Could it be that the fool really thought he hadn’t helped her and decided to sneak off to meet her master at the factory? 
His pupils sharply contracted as he threw the phone in a fit of anger! noveldrama
This foolish woman! Why doesn’t she just go die? 
Ji Chengzhi, oblivious to the situation on Mucen’s end, heard a "clang" from the phone, followed by what seemed like only the buzzing of static. He hurriedly called out, "Mucen, you need to find her quickly. She’s still in recovery, bedridden. If she runs around, takes a ride or something, it could seriously worsen her concussion. If she faints on the way and encounters danger..." 
"..." 
No sound came through; the phone seemed as if it had broken, with nothing but a persistent buzzing noise. 
What’s he doing? 
Did he smash the phone again? 
Ji Chengzhi, who knew that man with the dreadful temper all too well, noticed the nurse beside him becoming anxious as he suddenly fell silent, "Director, what did the Third Young Master say? Will he help find Miss An?" 
Putting down his phone, Ji Chengzhi looked at her with a smile, "Don’t worry, he’ll find her soon enough."
###Chapter 270: Chapter 270: Uncle, Can You Come to Pick Us Up?
Nurse: "..." 
The director’s laughter seemed so crafty. Why was there this nagging feeling of disbelief? 
But the fact was, ten minutes after Ji Chengzhi made the call, Secretary Gao, who was at the factory, received a call from the president saying An Ning had gone over to the factory, and he should look for her and bring her back to the hospital. 
An Ning was hospitalized, wasn’t she? How did she suddenly end up here? 
Upon hearing this, Secretary Gao was startled and, without caring for the work at hand, rushed to search for her. 
However, after making a round near the factory, he discovered that there was no sign of her at all; not to mention her, women were rare in this suburban area. 
Secretary Gao stood at the intersection, helplessly calling the president, "Young Master, I haven’t seen An Ning here. Are you sure she came?" 
At that moment, Ou Mucen, who was outside meeting a client, suddenly received the call and his face immediately darkened, "You’re asking me? Whom should I ask?" 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
No, sir, wasn’t it you who asked me to search for her around here? If she’s not here, whom else should I ask? 
Secretary Gao was on the verge of going crazy, but since the person on the phone had already spoken this way, he dared not ask further and could only reply, "I’ll keep looking then." 
And then he prepared to hang up and continue the search. 
But then, the man on the phone suddenly threw another question, "Didn’t you call her phone?" 
Secretary Gao quickly replied, "I did, but her phone is turned off..." 
Turned off? 
Turned off again? 
The man sitting in a high-end restaurant meeting with a client, hearing this, felt like crushing the woman’s lousy phone to pieces in minutes! 
Was she so poor? Carrying that piece of junk all day. Would she die spending a bit more for a better one? 
In a matter of seconds, the atmosphere in the restaurant plummeted to freezing! 
The client, unaware of what had happened but noticing the change after he took a call, sensed it wasn’t anything good and cautiously asked after he hung up, "If Young Master has urgent matters, then... shall we continue another time?" 
"No need, continue!" 
The man who had thrown his phone on the table picked up the contract again without any expression. 
Seeing this, the client had no choice but to carry on as well. 
Is the Ou Corporation’s CEO really okay? Why did it feel like he couldn’t even breathe? 
While he sat there with his heart pounding, his phone, which had just been tossed aside, rang again. The client reflexively picked up the phone and presented it respectfully, "Young Master, your call..." 
Are you kidding me? 
Ou Mucen, the temperamental one, could make or break the deal depending on how well he was served. 
Fortunately, though the man had thrown the phone earlier, he didn’t refuse to answer once it rang again. Taking it from his hand, he put it to his ear, "Hello?" noveldrama
"Hello, Uncle. I’m Xiaobao!" 
It wasn’t Secretary Gao, but a child!
The man, poised to sign the contract with a pen in hand, froze completely, "Xiaobao? How is it you?" 
"Yes, it’s me. Uncle, can you come and pick us up?" 
"What?" 
"My mom can’t move at the subway station. She’s just sitting there without moving..."
###Chapter 271: Chapter 271: He Starts Off with a Barrage of Angry Scolding
The child was only four years old, and by the time he got to the part where his mom stopped moving, his voice was choked with sobs. The little nasal whimpers came in quivers, just like a lamb, heart-wrenchingly pitiful to hear. 
Ou Mucen stood up from the chair abruptly, grabbed the car keys on the table, and without a word of explanation, he turned and left the place, "Xiaobao, don’t panic. First, tell Uncle where you are now?" 
"We’re at the West Station entrance." 
"So the phone you’re holding, is it someone else’s?" 
"Mhm, a sister lent it to me. After I finish, I’ll give it back to her..." 
Hearing this voice, the child on the other end of the phone gradually calmed down. Afterwards, he clearly informed Ou Mucen of their exact location and their current situation.
Ou Mucen instructed him to stay put and then hurried downstairs to get his car, speeding towards the location the boy had described. 
He really should have thought of this sooner. If this woman wasn’t willing to let the guy with the surname Lin know she was hospitalized, then she would definitely foresee that always having him pick up the child would raise suspicion. noveldrama
Therefore, the first thing she thought of after meeting with him was to get the child by her side. Only in this way could they avoid further trouble. 
The handsome man with a stern expression thought of this and finally tightened his grip on the steering wheel, pressing down on the accelerator even more. The whole car nearly took flight, speeding forward like a bolt of lightning. 
Then, ten minutes later, at West Station metro stop — still about seven or eight stations away from the hospital — Ou Mucen saw a crowd of people discussing among themselves as soon as he got out of the car. Without giving it much thought, he went straight to the elevator and down toward the tunnel. 
"Are the mother and child still there? Should we call the police?" 
"There’s no need, that kid just borrowed someone’s phone to make a call. Someone will probably be here soon." 
"Really? I feel like his mom looks really pale, and I’m worried something might happen." 
"Me too..." 
As the entrance of the tunnel loomed closer, more and more people gathered, and the volume of their discussions also increased. 
Ou Mucen, walking inward, scowled tighter upon hearing this and quickened his pace. When he arrived inside the tunnel, indeed, not far from where the elevator to the subway was, he saw the woman slumped powerlessly in the corner and the child next to her, wiping sweat from her brow. 
"Mom, are you still feeling sick? Let’s wait a bit longer, Uncle will be here soon..." 
The child was just four years old and stood only so tall next to her. Yet now, he acted like a little adult, with a backpack on, tirelessly wiping her sweat and holding his water bottle to her lips for her to drink. 
This damned woman! 
Go ahead and court death on your own, but why drag such a small child through this with you? 
Seeing this scene, a wave of indescribable anger surged within Ou Mucen. The next second, he strode meteorically toward them, "Aren’t dead yet, huh? What’s the matter? Just can’t walk? Go on, then, you’re so capable, aren’t you? Keep going, walk on out of here!" 
Each sentence, each word, was filled with venom, with sharp cruelty; and his tone, unprecedentedly angry, harsh!
###Chapter 272: Chapter 272 Why Is She So Reckless?
He truly hated her to the extreme, and if he could, he really would crush her to death right there. 
Why couldn’t she be more considerate? 
Ye Xiaobao was frightened, staring blankly at this uncle who had suddenly appeared; he had even forgotten what he was supposed to say. 
Ye Ning also lifted her head, her entire face as if fished out of water, from hair to cheek, all covered with large beads of sweat; her complexion was deathly pale, resembling a corpse. 
Yet, in her blurry vision, upon seeing this familiar silhouette, her mouth slightly opened in shock, "You... how did you come?" 
How did he come? 
He came to "collect her body"!! 
The man, enraged to his limits, forcibly suppressed the madness screaming within him to crush her, walked over without a glance at her corpse-like face, flung everything in her hands onto the ground, and then picked her up. noveldrama
Upon seeing this, Ye Ning was startled, "Ou Mucen, you... you..." 
She said "you" several times, only to find that under her immense trepidation, she couldn’t even utter a complete sentence. 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, who didn’t even want to look at her by this point, turned his head to check on Little Baozi standing behind him; his expression softened a bit, "Xiaobao, hold onto your things, and follow uncle." 
Ye Xiaobao immediately nodded, "Okay, uncle!" 
It was Ye Xiaobao who reacted quickly, promptly realizing that this tyrannical uncle’s sudden rage was due to his mother’s disobedience; hence, after the initial shock, his mood quickly calmed down, 
Then he put on his little backpack, grabbed his water bottle, and followed his uncle’s steps. 
See, he wasn’t wrong; this uncle might have a bad temper and a poisonous tongue, but he was genuinely a good person. 
The trio quickly emerged from the subway, and because Ou Mucen was wearing sunglasses, not many recognized who he was. However, people did notice that someone had finally come to help the mother and son, and they too breathed a sigh of relief. 
So once the three of them got out, they headed for the car Ou Mucen had parked outside. Ou Mucen opened the car door and shoved the woman he was carrying into the backseat. 
Of course, don’t expect the action to be gentle; he was already doing well not to strangle her. 
After placing her properly in the backseat, Ou Mucen then opened the passenger door and lifted Little Baozi in as well, "Sit still, don’t move around, got it?" 
His tone was completely different from the sharpness he had shown towards the woman at the back just moments earlier. 
Ye Ning lay in the back, feeling as though she was tumbling in churning waters, dizzy, nauseous, chilly... all sorts of discomfort tortured her relentlessly. 
Therefore, at this moment, she had no energy to pay attention to the noises in front. However, one thing was undeniable: ever since she had been picked up and placed in the car, the string that had been tensed in her heart—the fear that her child might encounter something bad if she lost consciousness—suddenly relaxed. 
Afterward, her head tilted to the side, and she passed out completely! 
Perhaps, that was trust... 
— 
By the time Ou Mucen finally brought the woman he had found back to the hospital, Ji Chengzhi was sitting in his office with a smirk, waiting for him. Seeing that he had brought both mother and child back, Ji Chengzhi then hung up the pre-prepared medicine and IV fluids for her.
###Chapter 273: Chapter 273 Mouth so poisonous!
"Don’t worry, she won’t have any issues, I will help you cure her." 
"..." 
Ou Mucen stared at him coldly without a hint of gratitude, "Even if you kill her while treating her, it has nothing to do with me." 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
So vicious! 
No wonder he’s still a bachelor after all these years! 
Not wanting to waste words with him, after he had set up the IV, he saw Little Baozi standing at the edge of the bed, nervously watching his mother, and went to pat his little head: "Xiaobao was very brave today, taking care of Mommy." 
Actually, Ye Xiaobao had been very nervous all this time. He didn’t know what had happened to his mom or why she was suddenly in the hospital. 
Seeing that the hospital director uncle was talking to him, he opened his bright and dark eyes wide and blinked at him: "Uncle, is my mommy really going to die?" 
Ji Chengzhi quickly spit: "Don’t listen to what that bad uncle says, your mommy is fine." 
"Really?" noveldrama
"Of course it’s true. When has Uncle Ji ever lied to you? Are you hungry? Shall this uncle take you to eat?" 
What Ji Chengzhi meant was that although the child was much more sensible than his peers, he was still just a child after all. Having suffered such a shock, he would undoubtedly be upset. The best solution for now was to take him out to relax and ease his mood. 
However, what about the child? 
After glancing at his mom in the bed, he shook his head, took off his little backpack, pulled up a chair, and sat beside his mom’s bed: "I’m not hungry, I want to stay here with Mommy." 
His voice was soft, and his plump little face had an anxious look about it. Once he sat down, his tiny figure, seen from behind, resembled a pitiful kitten, making anyone who saw it feel an inexplicable pang of sadness. 
Ji Chengzhi didn’t know what to say. He turned his head and looked at the man standing opposite, who was also staring blankly at the small figure. Unable to help himself, he patted the man’s shoulder: "Console him, after all, he’s only four." 
The implication was that this was not something a four-year-old child should have to bear. 
Ou Mucen frowned and, after a while, when Ji Chengzhi had left, finally approached: "Xiaobao, come out with uncle." 
Ye Xiaobao immediately turned around: "Where to?" 
Ou Mucen turned and walked towards the door: "You’ll know once you come out..." 
He wasn’t very good at comforting children, but for some reason, he always seemed to know what methods worked best with this one. 
Sure enough, upon leaving the ward, after just a brief pause, the little footsteps followed him from behind. 
"Uncle, what’s up?" 
"I have a task for you," 
Upon hearing the voice, without turning back, he instinctively reached backwards, and the plump little hand was captured in his broad palm. 
A task? 
The small child, led by him, had no choice but to walk forward: "What task?" 
"The thing is, uncle still has to go to the company and get busy. Then you need to take good care of mommy in the hospital, and when uncle gets off work, he will come back to find you at the hospital. Can you do that?" 
"..." 
Ye Xiaobao, taken by the hand, looked up at the uncle with his round face for a long time. Then he blinked his shiny black eyes: "So uncle means that you won’t neglect mommy, right?" 
The man, who had been walking ahead, opened his mouth to say: "Of course
###Chapter 274: Chapter 274 Uncle, my mom only lets me call you
Ye Xiaobao finally brightened up, "Really? That’s great, Uncle, don’t worry, Xiaobao will definitely complete the task well." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
What had he just said? 
-- 
The pair, one tall and one small, left the hospital. Ou Mucen took him directly to the restaurant. Once there, he had intended to order some main dishes for him, but remembering that he had said he liked roasted chicken wings the last time, he ended up ordering those instead, and then watched him eat heartily across the table. 
"Didn’t you have lunch? You’re so hungry?" 
"I did, but we have lunch at 11 at the nursery, and then a snack at three in the afternoon. The teacher said children should eat less and more often, it’s easier to digest." 
Little Baozi, with both hands clutching a chicken wing and his mouth full of delicious food, explained to him in his milky voice. 
Ou Mucen, upon seeing this, twitched at the corner of his eyes and then pulled out a tissue and handed it over: "Eat slowly, no one is going to snatch it from you." 
Little Baozi smiled, took the tissue, and buried his head in his food, feasting once again. 
After watching him, Ou Mucen didn’t continue to disturb him. As Little Baozi ate, he started busying himself with his phone until the little one nearly finished eating. When Little Baozi lifted his head and saw that his uncle had been busy on the phone the whole time, he asked in a sticky-sweet voice, "Uncle, did something happen to my mom?" 
What? 
Ou Mucen, preoccupied with his phone, looked up at the little guy upon hearing this. 
Something happened? 
Had his mom not told him? 
Ou Mucen’s fingers paused, and his gaze, fixed on the child, furrowed slightly, "What did your mom tell you?" 
Ye Xiaobao shook his head: "Nothing, she just said she was sick." 
Sick? 
Since she said it was an illness, then it must be an illness. Indeed, for a child who’s only four years old, what’s the point in knowing so much? He’s still so young. 
Ou Mucen’s gaze retracted back to his work, "Right, she’s just sick. You don’t need to worry; she’ll get better soon." 
"Really? Then why didn’t she let Uncle Lin know?" 
"Uncle Lin?" 
Ou Mucen lifted his head again: "Did she tell you not to let Uncle Lin know?" 
"Yes!" 
Ye Xiaobao nodded: "At the subway station, when she was so ill, I wanted to borrow that sister’s phone to call Uncle Lin, but she wouldn’t allow it. Then I said I’d call you, and she didn’t say anything." 
"..." 
The man on the phone paused his fingers once again! 
So, even at that moment, she was unwilling to call the man she called her master? 
But she agreed to him? 
He was stunned for a moment, feeling as if the pressure in his heart had somewhat eased. 
"What did she say?" 
"She didn’t say much, just that she couldn’t disturb Uncle Lin, said he was busy. But Uncle, you’re busy too, and you’re her boss, how could she dare to bother you?" 
"..." 
Sitting there, Ou Mucen stared at Little Baozi for a long time, unable to answer this question. 
Right, his relationship with her was far more distant than that of the man and her. Yet at that critical moment, she preferred to choose him instead of seeking out the man. noveldrama
Could it be because she felt she could trust him more than the other man? 
He thought back to the phone call at noon, the one that had come through so abruptly, asking for his help to intercept the man’s call. Finally, with a slight lift in his eyes and a hint of a curve at the corners of his mouth, something resembling a smile spread across his
###Chapter 275: Chapter 275: The Power to Troll One’s Mother for 100 Years
"That’s because your mom didn’t have any money, so she thought of finding me," 
"Why?" 
"Does staying in the hospital cost nothing?" 
Ye Xiaobao: "..." 
At this reply, he found himself at a loss for words! 
That was true, though; he was her boss—If she didn’t ask him for the money, who was she supposed to ask? After all, she worked in his company, didn’t she? Could she not offset it with her salary? 
Ye Xiaobao reluctantly accepted this answer. 
After sitting for another ten minutes or so, Ye Xiaobao had finally eaten almost enough. Ou Mucen saw this and waved to signal the waiter to come over and bring the bill. 
"Remember not to run around after we go back to the hospital. Stay properly in the ward, okay?" After paying the bill, Ou Mucen saw Little Baozi still sitting on the chair and reached out to lift him down. 
The child was round and plump. He didn’t know what that woman fed him, but once he held him in his arms, he felt like a little weight, emanating the milky scent of a child. 
Ye Xiaobao nodded, got down from Uncle’s embrace, and without noticing that his little hands were still dirty, he reached out and grabbed Uncle’s broad palm, "When will Uncle come then?" 
"I’ll come over after work. If you get hungry, there is a nurse in the ward; you can ask her to order something for you to eat."noveldrama
Ou Mucen didn’t notice the dirt in his palm; he only felt that the chubby little hand enveloped in his palm was soft and small. With a gentle squeeze, something tender stirred within him, filling his heart with comfort. 
It was indeed a very peculiar sensation... 
In the end, Ye Xiaobao didn’t ask for anything more and obediently followed Uncle back to the hospital. He stayed in the ward all afternoon. 
Ye Ning woke up at almost five o’clock in the afternoon. Upon awakening and seeing the familiar ward and the small figure sitting cross-legged on the floor playing with something, her heart, which had been hanging, finally settled. 
"Xiaobao..." 
"Mom, you’re awake?" 
Hearing this, Ye Xiaobao turned around, saw that his mom had woken up, immediately threw away the paper airplane, and dashed over from the windowsill. 
Ye Ning slightly tilted her head up to find a comfortable position, then stretched out her arms to embrace her son who was throwing himself at her, "Have you been naughty? Mommy was sleeping just now. You didn’t bother anyone, did you?" 
Ye Xiaobao immediately snuggled in her arms and laughed, "No, the director was really nice, gave me toys to play with. And Uncle Bingshan took me out to have a meal." 
What? 
That man took him out for a meal again? 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning immediately became anxious, "Why did you let Uncle take you out for a meal again? He’s very busy, you can’t keep bothering him." 
Indeed, what kind of person was that man? He was the lofty Crown Prince. How could she and her son keep bothering him? It was already very good of him to bring her to the hospital. 
Ye Ning felt both anxious and embarrassed, and she wished she could scold her son. 
But Little Baozi, seeing her so agitated, looked entirely innocent, "I didn’t bother him. He said he had a task for me, and then he took me to have a meal." 
"A task?" 
Ye Ning was taken aback for a moment, "What task?" 
Ye Xiaobao blinked, "To take care of you. Uncle said if I take good care of you and don’t run around, he will give me a reward." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Lying there, she stared at her son for a long time and then with a flushed face, she hesitantly asked, "You’re saying, he told you to take care of me?"
###Chapter 276: Chapter 276: Mom, don’t worry, Uncle Ou will definitely come...
"Yeah, actually Uncle is also silly, you are my mom, how could I not take care of you? But since he made it a mission for me, I have to take even better care of you. Mom, do you want some water?" 
"..." 
Staring at the little rascal, she fiercely poked his smiling face that looked like a little fox’s: "Did you tell him something again? Did you sell your mom out again?" 
"No, no!" 
Little Baozi, with a face full of innocence, was shaking his little head like a rattle drum: "Mom, how could I betray you? You are my biological mom." 
So what if I’m your biological mom? 
These days, it’s the biological mom who gets sold out. 
Ye Ning was lying on the hospital bed, recalling the scene of the little rascal borrowing someone else’s phone to make a call. 
It was unbelievable; she hadn’t told him that man’s phone number. How had the little rascal known it? If she had known he would call him, she would have never agreed to let him borrow a phone from someone else. 
Call 120, yeah! Why call that bastard?!! 
Ye Ning’s head was aching slightly. After finally drinking some water and calming her mood a bit, she turned to Baozi and asked, "By the way, did you make a call to Uncle Lin at that time?" 
She really couldn’t remember much about the situation in the subway. At that time, she was feeling too awful, her ears were buzzing, and her stomach was churning nauseatingly. 
Thus, she actually didn’t know what the child had done. 
Fortunately, upon hearing her ask this, the child immediately shook his head: "No, mom, you can rest assured, I didn’t call Uncle Lin." 
That’s good, that’s good! 
Ye Ning finally breathed a sigh of relief after hearing this... 
It’s good that he didn’t, good, she didn’t have to worry about being exposed. noveldrama
But if the little rascal didn’t call Lin Yebai, why did he think to call that man? Could it be that man was more important in his heart than his Uncle Lin? 
Ye Ning finally realized this and immediately raised her head again: "Then why did you call that uncle? You didn’t even call Uncle Lin, but you called him?"
"I definitely called him. We’re so familiar with him and he’s been so nice to us. If I don’t call him, who should I call?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Were she and her son really that familiar with him? Why didn’t she know about it? 
And, had he been nice to them? Why hadn’t she noticed? Hey, this little rascal, he couldn’t have been bribed just by that last meal and a few model toys, and still being his lackey, could he? 
This little rascal! 
Ye Ning felt like going crazy! 
While mother and son were talking in the room, it was almost the end of Jicheng’s shift, and he came in to do his rounds. Seeing both mother and son in the room, he came over and patted Ye Xiaobao’s thick-headed little noggin: "Yo, Xiaobao, not bad today, you’ve been with your mom all day." 
Ye Xiaobao immediately smiled: "Of course, Uncle Ou promised Xiaobao a reward." 
"Is that so? What reward?" 
"I don’t know that, we’ll see when he comes later." 
"..." 
Coming later... again? 
Ye Ning, lying in the hospital bed, was shocked by her son’s words: "Xiaobao, what are you talking about? Uncle Ou is a very busy man, how could he possibly come?" 
Ye Xiaobao was very serious: "He really will come, don’t worry, mom..." 
Omg! 
What on earth did I say? How did this little troublemaker twist my words like this?
###Chapter 277: Chapter 277: Little White-Eyed Wolf!
Ji Chengzhi burst into laughter upon hearing her, turned around, and saw Little Baozi standing there looking innocent and bewildered after having annoyed his mother. Overwhelmed with affection for him, Ji Chengzhi couldn’t help squatting down in front of him. 
"That’s right, uncle also thinks that Uncle Ou is a man of his word. If he says he’ll come, he will definitely come." 
"Director Ji, you..." 
"Xiaobao, do you like treats? Come, let’s go to Director Uncle’s office; he has some yummy snacks for you." noveldrama
"Okay, Uncle!" 
Without another word, Little Baozi agreed and reached out his chubby little hand. He didn’t care about his mom still lying in the hospital bed as he followed the director uncle away. 
Ye Ning was so angry she felt like she could spit blood! 
This ungrateful little wolf! Undutiful child!! 
---- 
After leaving the ward, Ji Chengzhi really did take Little Baozi to his office. 
He indeed had treats there; today his aunt had come to the hospital for a medical check-up and had brought along some treats she made. His aunt’s culinary skills were famous, and her treats were coveted by many. 
So, seeing how cute the child was, he wanted to let him try some as well. 
Bringing him in, Ji Chengzhi took the treats out of the fridge, "Eat up, there’s plenty. Help yourself to whatever you want." 
While talking, he took out his phone and logged into WeChat. 
Ye Xiaobao was indeed at that age where children loved to eat, and upon seeing all the tasty options, his round eyes scanned the choices and lit up. 
After Ji Chengzhi took out the treats, he stopped paying attention to him as he began messaging on WeChat, "Today my aunt made some treats, who wants some?" 
With one message, the entire Langya Pavillion, which had already moved from the gaming world to a WeChat group, was stirred up! 
Exhibit Master: "Damn! What’s the special occasion today?" 
Mr. Xia: "Did you have a successful blind date?" 
Langya Pavillion’s number-one beauty: "Osmanthus cake!! Osmanthus cake!!" 
Store Manager Ji kicked out fiercely! 
"You want some?" 
Exhibit Master: "Bootlicker^_^^_^^_^..." 
Mr. Xia: "I’m in!" 
Number-one beauty: "If they don’t want it, give it all to me!" 
Store Manager Ji: "..." 
The only one with no reaction whatsoever was Third Master... 
Seeing this, Ji Chengzhi tagged him specifically, "Third Master, I’ve also made a portion of your chestnut cake. Don’t miss out; you know my aunt doesn’t make these often." 
Exhibit Master: "Exactly!" 
Mr. Xia: "It only happens a few times a year, so sad..." 
Number-one beauty: "I wish I were her daughter..." 
Get lost!! 
This time the response was unanimous! 
However, the person who had been tagged still hadn’t shown up, so Ji Chengzhi half-jokingly added another message to the group chat, "If you don’t come, I could bring it to the ward. You’ll be coming by later anyway." 
Exhibit Master immediately appeared, reactively responding, "Ward? What’s happening?" 
Mr. Xia was also energized, "" 
Number-one beauty: "Oh my god!! Is Third Master sick?!!" 
In a matter of seconds, chaos erupted in the group chat! 
Realizing the situation was going awry, Ji Chengzhi immediately tried to explain, but just then, in the group, the person they had all been waiting for made an appearance, "Are you sick of living?" 
"..." 
With that cold and chilling remark, everyone in the group chat instantly straightened up, and the culprit Ji Chengzhi himself posted a big emoticon of crying and clutching at someone’s legs as he "knelt" in front of him. 
Store Manager Ji: "My lord, I was wrong. I shouldn’t have spread rumors..." 
Third Master: "......" 
Exhibit Master: "..." 
Mr. Xia: "...Beat him up!!" 
And with that command, a group thrashing ensued!
###Chapter 278: Chapter 278: Astoundingly Similar
Third Young Master saw that, and finally sent an expressionless emoji... 
Indeed, even his emojis were just as cold as him. 
Staring at his phone, Ji Chengzhi felt unusually annoyed. He turned off his phone, planning to tidy up, but when he turned around, he found that the child sitting next to the coffee table was holding a plate of chestnut cake in front of him. 
Chestnut cake? 
He’s eating chestnut cake? 
Ji Chengzhi’s hands and feet went cold with panic. That was specifically prepared for that bastard, how could Little Baozi eat it? 
Just as he was about to coax him into eating something else, another scene unfolded which left him incredibly astonished. 
He saw the child take the pastry in his hand but didn’t rush to eat it. Instead, he used his little hands to pick out the red beans one by one and throw them away! 
Red beans? 
Throw away? 
Ji Chengzhi was frozen in shock! 
Why... would he pick them out? Didn’t they taste good? 
Ji Chengzhi heard the clunk in his own heart: "Xiaobao, do you not like red beans? Are you picking them out?" 
Ye Xiaobao nodded: "I never eat beans!" 
After speaking, he dug out another bean with a look of disgust and placed it on the coffee table. 
What? 
Seeing this, Ji Chengzhi finally fell completely silent. It was not for nothing, for this was not the first time he had seen such a scene. 
This scene, it was one that man had every time he ate this thing, only he was more elegant and nonchalant than Little Baozi! 
And the reason was the same as the child’s: "Never eat beans!" 
Holy crap! 
Not eating beans, are they poisonous or something? 
Ji Chengzhi felt like he had been struck by lightning. Walking over, he noticed that after Little Baozi had been picking at the chestnut cake for so long, there were hardly any beans left. So he crouched down in front of him: "Xiaobao, have you eaten this before?" 
"No!" Ye Xiaobao was very honest. 
Indeed, he had not. However, he thought it must taste very good because it smelled so nice, it was just that these beans were too bothersome. 
He picked out another bean and threw it aside. 
Ji Chengzhi, squatting beside him and feeling a stir inside, subconsciously grabbed a jar of honey condensed milk, ready to spread it on for him to eat. 
Ou Mucen didn’t like sweets. He never ate them growing up, and once Aunt Ji knew this, she never added sugar to his chestnut cake, just some red beans for scent, softly sweetening it. 
While the chestnuts themselves were sweet, once mixed with the cake flour, the taste was almost there, quite faint overall. 
Ji Chengzhi carefully spread the condensed milk on the pastry and handed it over: "Here Xiaobao, eat this!" 
Ye Xiaobao was seriously picking out beans and took the offered food without a second thought, opening his mouth to accept it. 
However, what shocked Ji Chengzhi yet again was that as soon as the piece of chestnut cake reached the child’s mouth, he only saw him shudder once. The bite of cake he had taken, he spat out: "What’s this? Why is it so sweet?!" noveldrama
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
There he was, holding that condensed milk brush, squatted there, and for a long, long time, he couldn’t come back to his senses... 
Shit! 
What in the world was going on? 
A coincidence? 
This was cursed! I can overlook your dislike for beans, but now you won’t even eat sweets? Could this still be considered a coincidence? This is absolutely inconceivable! 
Ji Chengzhi was starting to feel unsettled, his eyes began to quietly scrutinize the child. 
This was indeed a very beautiful child, with delicate features, and skin like milk......
###Chapter 279: Chapter 279 This idea is crazy!
This indeed was a very pretty child, with delicate features, skin like milk, and round cheeks, a pair of big, black eyes that fluttered like the wings of a butterfly—utterly adorable. 
At a glance, the shape of his face really didn’t resemble that person much, but once you took a closer look at his brows and eyes, you would find something strikingly similar to that person. It was his impatience when he slightly furrowed his brows and the natural air of nobility and solemnity that flowed from his dark pupils, something not just any child could imitate. 
Oh my God! 
Could this be real? 
Ji Chengzhi’s mind suddenly burst with a crazy idea, and with that thought, his hand almost shook, nearly dropping the milk bottle brush and the bottle of milk onto the floor. 
This was too absurd, how could it be possible? 
His mind churned like tumultuous waves in an instant... 
However, Ye Xiaobao had no idea what this uncle was thinking about. After picking out the beans, he took a bite with his little mouth. 
Wow! 
Sweet and delicious, melting upon entry, truly tasty, and importantly, it wasn’t too sweet. 
Little Baozi became excited and quickly stuffed the pastries into his mouth, almost finishing off the whole plate. 
While he was happily eating, the director uncle who had been staring at him dumbfoundedly, suddenly spoke up, "Xiaobao, shall we go wash your hands? It’s not clean like this." 
Wash hands? 
Ye Xiaobao looked at his hands indeed smeared with red bean paste and nodded his head, following the uncle to stand up and went to wash his hands in the washroom of his office.
Once in the washroom, he washed his chubby white hands clean, and the uncle brought over a very clean towel to dry them. Then he led him back to the office and fetched a few cotton swabs soaked in disinfectant. 
"Uncle, what are you going to do?" 
"Nothing much, just checking on Xiaobao. Kids your age who often eat without paying attention to hygiene are prone to getting sick, so uncle is just taking some preventive measures," he said. Then, the small finger in his palm was suddenly pricked by something, and immediately, Ye Xiaobao felt a pain on his fingertip, followed by a bead of blood emerging. 
"Uncle..." 
"Don’t worry, it’s just a bit of blood. When you go back, just tell your mom and say that this is an extra health check gift package from uncle." 
The man who successfully obtained the blood sample smiled like a sly fox. 
Ye Xiaobao didn’t doubt it anymore. After all, he was young, and the fact that the director uncle even told him to inform his mom made him even less likely to think otherwise. 
So, after happily nodding his head, he held his finger and went back to the coffee table. 
"Uncle, what about these delicious treats..." 
"Take them all, uncle is giving them to you!" Ji Chengzhi looked at the only chestnut cake left on the coffee table, waved his hand dismissively, completely forgetting about the person to whom the chestnut cake was really intended, and generously gave it to Little Baozi. 
A joke, right? 
That was Little Baozi after all. Since there was a ’little’ one, why shouldn’t the ’big’ one make way for the little one? 
Store Manager Ji suddenly felt very excited... 
---- 
After eight o’clock- noveldrama
The hospital entered nightfall, and amidst this bustling city, it gradually quieted down. The VIP ward area on the third floor of the inpatient department was even quieter due to management reasons.
###Chapter 280: Chapter 280: Her Heart Suddenly Skipped a Beat...
When Ye Ning awoke, the entire ward was quiet, the room was filled with the faint scent of medicinal herbs, the lighting soft, the atmosphere serene. Had it not been for the IV bottle hanging above her head, which she saw as soon as she opened her eyes, she might have thought she was at home. 
The VIP ward was indeed very nice! noveldrama
"Awake?" 
Just as she was staring absent-mindedly at the ceiling, someone spoke in the quiet ward with a simple two-word question, their voice clear and uncommonly elegant. 
Ye Ning’s brain jolted, and she immediately looked towards the source of the voice... 
A dark blue casual shirt, the collar casually unbuttoned, revealing the prominent Adam’s apple on his fair neck, his figure tall and slender. At this moment, with his legs crossed while sitting in that chair, and looking down at the laptop on his lap, the lines of his back were especially straight and imposing. 
My goodness! 
He really came? 
Ye Ning’s mouth fell slightly agape, and for a moment, she forgot what she wanted to say. 
Ou Mucen had actually been focusing on an email on his laptop, one that was giving him a bit of a headache. After asking that question, the woman in the hospital room didn’t make a sound, and he suddenly furrowed his brows slightly, looking over at her, "What, did you sleep yourself stupid?" 
Ye Ning quickly shook her head, "No... no, I was just... what time is it now?" 
She was a bit nervous, and somewhat flattered. She truly hadn’t expected him to come—who was he? He was the highly esteemed third young master of the Ou Family. How could he possibly come to visit a woman whose status and position were not even worth a toe of his? 
Ye Ning could hear her own heart "thumping" wildly inside her chest... 
Ou Mucen, however, didn’t seem to notice this. Hearing her ask for the time, he simply lifted his wrist to check, "It’s a little after eight; you’ve slept for four hours. Chengzhi gave you the medication. Don’t worry, there’s nothing wrong with your brain!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
What kind of comment was that? Sleeping a bit longer didn’t equate to suspecting she had brain problems. 
Ye Ning looked away and lay there, calming herself for a long while until she felt her heart wasn’t beating as fiercely, before she struggled to sit up from the hospital bed. 
Huh? Where’s Xiaobao? Where did he go? Why isn’t he here? 
Noticing the absence of the little figure in the ward, she became suspicious, "Where’s Xiaobao? Where did he go? Why don’t I see him?" 
Ou Mucen glanced at her indifferently, "He’s asleep; I took him to Chengzhi’s office." 
Chengzhi? 
The director’s office? 
That made sense, after all, there was only one bed in her ward. If she was sleeping, Xiaobao would certainly have no place to rest. 
As Ye Ning realized this, she suddenly felt her heart skip a beat while looking at the man before her. 
"Third Master, this time... I’ve really troubled you. If it weren’t for you, something bad might have happened to my son and me today." 
You know you did something wrong? 
The man, who was typing on the keyboard, kept his gaze fixed on the screen without moving an inch, but the corners of his lips curved up into a satisfied smirk, "Didn’t you go to meet your master? What, he doesn’t care about you?"

###Chapter 281: Chapter 281: It’s Already Good That He Can Come to Take Care of Her
Ye Ning: "..." 
He actually knew she had gone to see Lin Yebai? 
That’s not right. Before she went to see Lin Yebai, she had called him for help, but he didn’t agree, so it was normal for him to know she went to see Lin Yebai. 
But what did he mean by that? He knew she went to see Lin Yebai precisely because she didn’t want him to know she was hospitalized, and now he was making such sarcastic remarks? 
Ye Ning was a bit displeased, "Are you pretending to be ignorant? I went to see my master so that he wouldn’t find out. How could I possibly go looking for him when I can’t even walk?" 
Was that so? 
The man still busy at the table thought back about what the child had told him at the restaurant, which seemed to be for the same reason; she wouldn’t let him call that Uncle Lin, but instead called him. 
After a moment’s pause, the fingers that had been busy finally stopped. 
"Do you want something to eat?" 
"Huh?" 
Ye Ning, who was waiting for his response, was suddenly thrown off by such an abrupt question. 
Do you want something to eat? 
Of course, she did. Today she had only had a glass of lemon water at the coffee shop and hadn’t eaten anything else. noveldrama
But right now, she wasn’t hungry; she needed to use the restroom. She was about to burst. 
So, she nodded nonchalantly and then proceeded to throw back the bedsheet, preparing to get out of bed... 
"What are you doing?" 
"I..." 
Ye Ning froze on the spot, trying to say something, but at that moment, the man seated in the chair gave another indifferent remark, "You’d better not get out of bed, or you won’t be leaving the hospital tomorrow!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
No, she didn’t want to be unable to leave the hospital tomorrow, but she had to go to the restroom; she couldn’t just die on the bed, right? 
Therefore, after struggling at the edge of the bed for a moment, she still got off the bed: "I’m just going to the restroom..." 
The man sitting beside the small table saw this, frowned slightly but didn’t say anything else. 
He was not accustomed to taking care of people, and coming here was already the most "out of character" act he, as a high and mighty young master, had ever done. 
Hence, when he saw her saying she needed to go to the restroom, he did not think of doing anything. Frowning, he watched as she unsteadily made her way to the restroom. Once she was out of sight, his gaze returned to his work. 
But, no sooner had he returned to his work than two minutes passed when suddenly, from inside the restroom, there was a loud "snap" as if something had fallen to the floor. 
Dammit! 
She couldn’t have fallen to the floor again, could she? 
Sitting there and remembering the ghastly way the woman had just entered, his expression changed in an instant. Without thinking, he put his laptop on the table and quickly headed toward the restroom. 
"What happened to you?" 
... 
Inside the restroom, the person who had barely had time to respond watched as the door was kicked open with a "bang." 
So there was Ye Ning, who had just been bending down to pick up the laundry basket that she had accidentally knocked over, suddenly looking up to see the man who had barged in so fiercely! 
"What are you doing?" 
"I... I..." Ye Ning initially wanted to explain that she had simply accidentally knocked the basket containing the patient clothes onto the floor and was about to pick it up. 
But she’d only gotten two words out when the man who had barged in grabbed her by the arm without explanation, yanked her up from the floor, and pulled her into his embrace...
###Chapter 282: Chapter 282 Heartbeat
"You really want to die, don’t you? If you want to die, don’t linger here, just get lost!" 
After lifting her up, the man, out of habit, started cursing again. 
In fact, it was true that a concussion patient should not be walking around while supposed to be resting in bed, as it wouldn’t help the condition at all. 
But at this moment, Ye Ning couldn’t hear what he was saying because, as soon as he lifted her up, she felt the world spinning. The thick scent of the man enveloped her completely. 
It was such a heart-stopping sensation! 
Although she had already given birth to a child, such close contact with a man was rare for her. 
In the past, Ou Yuze pretended to love her to use her, but even that pretense had only gone as far as holding hands with her, without even a kiss or a hug. 
So, when it came to intimate contact with other men, besides that man who demanded her in the darkness one night, there really hadn’t been anyone else. 
But now, this man was holding her again. Counting up, since her return, he had already held her so many times, from the first time he carried her out when she injured her foot in his house to later on the highway when he was drugged and suddenly, in the grip of the drug’s effects, he violently kissed her! 
Thinking about this, Ye Ning’s heart beat even faster... 
Thump, thump, thump, thump— 
Like the sound of a drum,. 
This is too frightening! 
Ye Ning didn’t dare move at all and simultaneously, her mind felt as if something inside had exploded, completely in disarray. 
Ou Mucen, however, still hadn’t noticed this as he carried the woman quickly towards the outside ward. 
This damned woman! 
Why can’t she be more careful? One trouble wasn’t enough, and there had to be a second one; he really wanted to strangle her.
Just a few steps out of the washroom, he reached the hospital bed and pushed the emergency button: "Hello, patient in room 9 has fallen, call the doctor over to check." 
"..." 
The patient in room 9 has fallen? 
My god, isn’t that the patient personally being treated by Director Ji? This won’t do, I have to notify the director immediately. 
Thus, after the nurse station received the message, it immediately notified the director. 
Meanwhile, in the room, Ou Mucen finally brought the woman to her hospital bed and planned to put her down, but as he bent over, he suddenly saw a little face so red it looked like it might bleed. At that moment, the little face was deeply buried, as if wishing to hide itself completely and never appear again. 
What is she doing? 
He hadn’t figured it out yet, seeing those beautifully curved eyelids, hanging low at the moment, the long and full eyelashes trembling gently like the wings of a startled butterfly, he was still puzzled. 
Not until he smelled a fragrance from the woman—in his nose, the familiar scent of lime—he suddenly realized just how close they were. 
Damn! 
How had he ended up holding her again? 
Finally awake to the situation, he reflexively loosened his grip! 
He had wanted to just throw her out, but unexpectedly, when he let go, the completely unprepared woman was startled and in her panic, she reached out and yanked him, pulling his still unbent body, clothes and all, down on top of her.noveldrama
###Chapter 283: Chapter 283: She’s at a loss, he’s tingling like electricity
"Bang!" 
A muffled sound and both people simultaneously fell onto the hospital bed. 
Ou Mucen wanted to curse, but when he opened his eyes, he found himself looking into a pair of very clear eyes, amber-colored like colored glaze; so clear he could even see the startled pupils within them. 
However, that wasn’t the most shocking part. The most shocking part was that he realized something soft was pressed against his lips, like cotton candy. As soon as it made contact, a familiar, distinctive sweet fragrance of a woman surged into his mouth and teeth, causing him to pause for a moment as a tingling sensation raced through his body. 
Damn it! 
He was actually reacting to her? 
The man’s eyes darkened a shade... 
Similarly, Ye Ning, who was beneath him, felt as if her mind had been cleaved in two. Staring up at the man pressing down on her lips, her mind went completely blank! 
She had just tugged at him slightly - how did it become like this? 
Her eyes, wide and startled, looked up at him, her face both red and hot, her heart pounding so wildly it felt as though it was about to leap out of her chest. 
His eyes were beautiful, deep like an ocean, and his eyelashes were incredibly long. Just one look, and she felt as though she was about to drown in them. And the worst thing was, her lips were filled with his distinct masculine scent, making her feel dizzy. 
This was no good; this man was too dangerous. She couldn’t be so close to him! 
She remembered the time in the car when he embraced her and kissed her forcefully, and suddenly, she reached out to push him away. 
But to her surprise, as soon as her hand touched him, the man’s scorching body temperature seeped through the thin fabric of his clothes and branded her skin, causing an electric shock to surge through her, making her hands begin to tremble uncontrollably. 
This was too terrifying! 
What exactly had he done to her that she was so out of sorts? 
Ye Ning was completely panicked, about to push him away at all costs, but at that moment, the door to the hospital room was suddenly "click" pushed open from the outside. 
"What’s happening now...?" 
The word "happening" hadn’t even finished when the person who came in, seeing the scene in the room, abruptly stopped talking! 
Holy cow! noveldrama
What’s the situation here? 
Were the two of them actually... actually... 
Ou Mucen was quick to react. Seeing the new arrival, he immediately jumped up off the woman like he’d been electrocuted and moved to the other side, "What are you doing here?" 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
No, what was he doing here? He should ask him that; wasn’t it him who called the nurse’s station, saying the patient in this room was having another incident? And that’s why he rushed over in a hurry. 
Instead of seeing an incident with the patient, he caught sight of a scene not suitable for children. 
What were they up to? 
Ji Chengzhi, looking at the two who had separated instantly but were now both red-faced and very unnatural, suddenly got excited, "No... nothing, wrong room, that’s all. You guys carry on..." 
Having said that, the scoundrel actually wanted to leave. 
Ye Ning, sitting on the edge of the bed, heard this and her face turned even redder, wishing she could just crawl into a hole and hide.
Ou Mucen wasn’t faring much better, but as a man, even though he was feeling embarrassed now, his friend’s comments still angered him, and he reached for his collar, "What are you babbling about? What do you mean ’carry on’? It’s not what you think." 
"Right, right, right, my mistake. Third Young Master, I swear to heaven, I’ll never think that way again."
###Chapter 284: Chapter 284: Mucen, Chenxi Is Back...
"You—" 
"Third Young Master, the night is long; you should take it easy, she’s still a patient after all." 
"Ji Chengzhi!!!" 
When the man let out that growl at the end, Ye Ning, who was sitting on the edge of the bed, only heard the sound of the hospital door being slammed shut, and then the two of them left the room. 
She was left alone, sitting there dazedly. After a while, she grabbed the blanket from the bed, wrapped it around her face, and started screaming wildly in the room. 
Ahhhhhhhh!!! 
What should I do, what should I do? I’ve made a complete fool of myself this time! noveldrama
She collapsed face down, covering herself with the blanket, never wanting to get up again... 
— 
Fifteen minutes later, in the director’s office on the fourth floor— 
Ji Chengzhi, seeing the man sitting on the sofa still looking as if someone owed him billions, couldn’t help but go to the coffee machine nearby and personally brew him a cup of plain coffee. 
"Alright, stop being angry, I didn’t do it on purpose. But on the other hand, that woman is actually quite good, strong and independent, patient and enduring. Although she has a child with her, she doesn’t have any hidden agendas towards you. I think in that respect, she’s much better than those scandalous girlfriends of yours who were only after your money, your looks, many times over." 
Ji Chengzhi was telling the truth. He’d heard that the woman’s husband had "died" before the child was born, and the child was already four years old now. It was not hard to imagine how much hardship and suffering she must have endured in those four years. 
So, if his guess was correct, then Ji Chengzhi would definitely support his brother getting together with that woman with both hands up. 
But the man who had been sitting there, smoking, upon hearing these words, his already unhappy face grew even darker: "Are you sick? How can you say such preposterous things?" 
Ji Chengzhi was choked up! 
Preposterous? 
Indeed, somewhat. He was the Crown Prince of the Oushi Empire, after all, and the woman? 
She was a "widow" with a child in tow. Geez, if it turns out in the end they don’t have anything to do with each other, this would indeed seem like a flight of fancy. 
So he didn’t continue on this topic anymore, but instead sat down with the cup of coffee: "I heard Sister Chenxi is coming back, and she’s going to throw a party when she does. Are you going to go?" 
Chenxi? 
His coffee-holding fingers paused there for a moment, his gaze lingering on a certain spot on the phone screen. 
Finally coming back? 
She left here determinedly five years ago, leaving his side to pursue her dreams, huh? Five years gone by and she’s finally willing to return? 
He stared at that spot for a long time, finally curling a mocking, cold smile on his lips: "What, has she achieved her dreams? Coming back in triumph?" 
Ji Chengzhi’s smile was embarrassed: "That seems to be the case. She’s now a world-famous piano performer. I heard she’s coming back specifically because of her international concert tour." 
So that’s it! 
Upon hearing this, the man with the coffee’s gaze turned even colder: "Then do me a favor and send her my heartfelt congratulations. May her every performance be victorious and sold out!" 
Having said that, he downed his coffee in one gulp and stood up to leave. 
Ji Chengzhi sat across from him, stunned for a while, unable to recover. 
Does it need to be this cold? 
After all, that woman was the only one who shared happy times with him during his university days...
###Chapter 285: Chapter 285: Your Son Kept Me Awake All Night Last Night
The next day. 
Ye Ning hadn’t slept well the night before due to the incident, and she woke up early. 
Upon waking, she had intended to go upstairs to find her son, but to her surprise, just as she opened the door to her ward, the attendant came in with Ye Xiaobao, dressed neatly and with a small backpack on his back. 
"Xiaobao, you..." 
"Miss An, you’re awake, just in time. I was about to tell you that Third Young Master called and said that in ten minutes, his secretary would be at the hospital entrance to pick up Xiaobao and take him to kindergarten." 
What? 
The secretary is taking Xiaobao to kindergarten? Secretary Gao? 
Ye Ning was somewhat taken aback... noveldrama
The reason she hadn’t been able to sleep peacefully last night was that she was constantly pondering in her mind, after such an incident, whether she should be kicked out of the Oh Corporation tomorrow? 
After all, that man disliked her so much, never showing her a good face whenever they met. 
And this time, she had committed an even greater taboo—without his consent, she had forced physical contact with him, even to the extent of touching his lips. For someone so high and mighty, with a bad temper and severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, that was tantamount to a capital offense! 
Ye Ning still felt frightened recalling the way he looked like he could eat someone alive when he left last night. 
Yet, unexpectedly, this morning he actually had Secretary Gao send her child! 
Did that mean he had forgiven her? 
Ye Ning’s heart finally settled, and seeing her son dressed so neatly, she nodded her head in agreement, allowing the attendant to take him away. 
After the attendant took the child away, it wasn’t long before the doctors in this ward area began their morning routine checks. 
"Miss An, good morning, how do you feel today?" 
When Jicheng arrived here and saw the woman sitting by the bed, he actually greeted her cheerfully. 
Upon seeing him, Ye Ning’s face became unnatural, "Good morning, Director Ji, I’m feeling much better now." 
"That’s good to hear, let me take a look." And with that, he came over. 
"Hmm!" 
After last night’s incident, Ye Ning, feeling embarrassed, didn’t say much. She obediently extended her arm for him to check carefully with his instruments. 
Of course, she avoided looking at him, keeping her gaze away. 
Jicheng, standing beside her and seeing her like this, felt even better, "Miss An, although you are better than yesterday, I still recommend you stay another day." 
Stay another day? 
Ye Ning was slightly displeased, "Didn’t you say I could get out of bed now? Why do I need to stay?" 
"For consolidation. You can get out of bed now, but you’re not completely better. Another day on IV will do you good." 
"..." 
Sitting there, looking dejected for a while, she finally agreed. 
Seeing her consent, Jicheng began briskly writing in the check-up record, "Don’t worry about the cost, your superior will take care of it." 
"What?" 
"Also, if he comes today, remind him not to leave the child in my office again. Bring him back home; it kept me up all night!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
This man, really... What is he talking about? 
What does he mean if he comes today? 
And wasn’t Xiaobao supposed to sleep with the attendant last night? How did he end up sleeping in this man’s office again? 
What is he talking about? 
PS: Please vote, please comment...
###Chapter 286: Chapter 286 She Dares to Use Him?!!
Ou Family Building, fifteenth floor. 
Just as Ou Mucen left the meeting, he received a call from the Huo Family— 
"Third Young Master, I’ve figured out the reason. My merchandise was swapped out with fakes by someone. The He family, the ones on our street who specialize in producing inferior goods." 
"..." 
Swapped out? 
Ou Mucen was somewhat surprised upon hearing this news. 
Clutching the phone, he pondered in his chair for a while before asking, "Then, have you found out who did the swapping?" 
The boss of the Huo Family immediately answered, "Yes, it was Yang Xueshan! The girlfriend of the young master of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry." 
So it was her again! 
Ou Mucen finally understood, and suddenly, an eerie killing intent appeared on his handsome face, "Good, leave this matter to you to handle. If within one day, you can make Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry meekly admit to this, I won’t hold you accountable!" 
"Yes, yes, I’ll get on it right away!" 
The boss of the Huo Family hurriedly agreed over the phone. 
Are you kidding? 
This was the Third Young Master of the Ou Family. Compared to the Ou’s Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry, if he wanted to save himself, he definitely had to cling to the Third Young Master now. Two hundred million worth of jade materials, this wasn’t a trivial matter. 
So, after hanging up the call, he immediately went in person with his people to find that woman with the surname Yang. 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, after finishing his conversation, was staring blankly at the stack of documents on his desk. 
Yang Xueshan... 
Actually, he didn’t need that boss of the Huo Family to find out, he was already a hundred percent certain it was this woman playing tricks. He thought she had infiltrated his side to seek revenge for reporting Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry’s sky-high fraud, which resulted in her being sentenced to ten years in prison. He believed that was why she did it. 
It was not until the Huo Family boss told him that this incident was orchestrated by Yang Xueshan that he suddenly realized all his previous conjectures about her intentions were wrong. 
If she hadn’t intervened that day, following the previous course of events, the fake jade raw stones switched out by Yang Xueshan would have been processed entirely by Yuzhirun and then released to the market. 
By that time, once the counterfeit scandal broke out, Yuzhirun would be in grave danger. Once he, in his fury, traced it back to Yang Xueshan, Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry would also be destroyed along with it. 
Thus, the true goal of that woman was Longfeng, and he was merely a pawn in her hands, a sword to be used against the Ou Family’s Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry. 
He was being used as a pawn?! 
That damned woman! 
Suddenly, a blaze of fury ignited in his chest, and with a wave of his hand, he sent everything on the desk flying! 
Secretary Gao just happened to be passing by outside and, hearing the loud crash from the CEO’s office, his face changed colors as he quickly pushed the door open, "Third Young Master, what’s happened?" 
"That woman I asked you to investigate? Have you found anything yet?"
A storm of shouting rained down! 
Secretary Gao’s legs went weak... 
Woman? 
Which woman? And what exactly was he supposed to investigate? 
Overwhelmed by the sudden outburst, Secretary Gao was quite startled and momentarily couldn’t grasp the situation. 
It wasn’t until the tyrant reached for another folder to throw that he finally snapped out of it, "Third Young Master, are you referring to that foster daughter? I’ve found some leads." 
"Speak!" noveldrama
"It’s about the reason we could never find why Longfeng rose again. I think I know what it is now, it’s that foster daughter!"
###Chapter 287: Chapter 287: The Secret She Carries
Adopted daughter? 
The man, who was in the midst of his rage, finally paused, "What do you mean?" 
Secretary Gao hastily took out his phone, scrolling through to find a few photos, "Young Master, do you remember the jewelry that massively boosted sales when Longfeng had Ou Yuze take over? During that period, Ou Yuze frequently visited various auction houses, and every time he went, he brought along that adopted daughter." 
"..." 
Ou Mucen stared at the phone for a long while before finally reaching out to take it. 
Indeed, those old photos, sent after being taken with a camera, were recognizable at a glance as being from auction houses. 
And the people in the photos were clear, his impeccably dressed nephew, and a little girl following behind him. 
"The staff at these auction houses remember that little girl because every time the young master of the Ou Family bid on something, he actually consulted the little girl behind him, and nearly every time, he chose correctly. So, they have a deep impression of her." 
Indeed, it would leave a deep impression. The girl was only 15 or 16 at the time, having such high talent for identifying jade and stones at such a young age was indeed incredible. 
Ou Mucen observed those photos for a while and remembered the first time he brought that woman to the Skywalk. 
Indeed, that day she had also helped him buy the best antique in the entire venue. 
So, was this the real reason why she was formally adopted by the second household of the Ou Family? 
Then, if that’s the case, why did they still send her to prison? Someone with such a high talent would be better off staying with the Longfeng, wouldn’t they? Why lock her up in such a place? 
Could there be some secret about her? 
Ou Mucen’s brows furrowed slightly, his gaze upon the little girl in the photos on the phone getting darker, "Didn’t you previously receive an invitation to a charity auction hosted by the city government?" noveldrama
"Yes!" 
"What’s in it?" 
"I heard it’s a relic donated by a family from the Late Qing, a Prestigious Family. But you know, Young Master, it’s hard to say whether it’s real or fake." 
"It doesn’t matter, arrange it for me, I’ll go!" 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
Standing there, he stared at his boss who had already stood up for a full three seconds, not processing the change.
Isn’t it true that he never used to attend these auctions under the guise of charity, where it’s unclear what exactly is being sold? Why has he suddenly changed his mind today? 
Secretary Gao was utterly baffled! 
But just then, his boss had already tidied up the desk quickly, grabbed his car keys and phone, and left. 
Seeing this, Secretary Gao had no choice but to follow him out and make the arrangements. 
--- 
About half an hour later, Ye Ning, who had just finished her IV drip in the hospital room, received a phone call... 
"Hello?" 
"How did the doctor describe your condition today?" 
As soon as the call connected, the familiar voice of the man on the other end came straight through, emotionless, yet the abrupt tone still made Ye Ning’s fingers tighten involuntarily. 
"Dean Ji said I’m much better than yesterday, and that I could walk around more." 
"Good, then come downstairs, I’m waiting for you at the hospital entrance!" Having said that, he hung up.
###Chapter 288: Chapter 288: Come Down, Taking You to a Place
Ye Ning was stunned for a moment, and for a long time, she couldn’t come back to her senses... 
Let her go down? 
Why? Was there something wrong? 
She didn’t quite understand, but since he had asked her to go down, she didn’t delay. Getting up from the hospital bed, she shuffled along in a pair of slippers, just like that in her patient’s attire, and went downstairs. 
As a patient, even the director of the hospital had instructed her not to go far, so she definitely wouldn’t change out of her patient’s uniform, planning to return after meeting that person. 
However, when she exited the hospital and arrived at the main entrance, seeing the white Cayenne parked by the road and the man sitting inside waiting for her, his expression darkened instantly when he saw her ghostly appearance: "Why did you come out without changing your clothes?" 
Ye Ning was startled, "You didn’t ask me to change clothes, did you? Didn’t you just ask me to come down and meet you?" 
Ou Mucen: "..."
He just stared at her, a vein throbbing on his forehead. Finally, he suppressed the rage in his heart and opened the lock of the passenger seat in front: "Get in the car!" 
Ah? noveldrama
Get in the car? Where to? 
Ye Ning was increasingly confused about what he wanted to do, but since he had told her to get in the car, she obediently went to pull the back door. 
However, the back door didn’t open, and instead, the man sitting in the driver’s seat, seeing her pulling at the back door, became displeased again: "Sit in the front!" 
Ah? 
Sit in the front? 
Why sit in the front? 
Ye Ning was somewhat bewildered, and of course, a bit nervous as well. 
After the awkward incident that occurred between them last night, she really didn’t want to be this close to him, otherwise, the atmosphere would become even more awkward. 
But the man in the car coldly uttered that sentence and then fell silent; he made no move to open the lock for the doors. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning sighed in resignation and went over to the passenger side. She opened the door, and then entered wearing that hospital attire and flat slippers. 
"Where are we going?" 
Once in the car, she buckled her seatbelt. Seeing the man beside her staring straight ahead in silence, she asked boldly out of nervousness. 
Hearing this, the man who was restarting the car, gave her a cold glance. Then, from his dashboard, he tossed over an invitation: "Take a look at this, you’ll need it when we enter." 
Enter? 
Ye Ning took the invitation with suspicion and saw it was for a charity auction held by the city government. Finally, she understood. 
"Are you taking me to attend this auction?" 
"I heard the items being auctioned off this time are donations from a Prestigious Family of the Late Qing, all good stuff. So, I am taking you to see if there’s anything that could represent our brand, Yuzhirun. If we come across it, it would be an opportunity." 
Indeed it was! 
Ye Ning understood, and therefore, after closing the invitation, she readily nodded her head: "Okay, I got it!" 
She was speaking the truth this time. Regarding this man, after the incident with the fake jade, she truly had the intent to make amends. There was no enmity between them, and after she joined his company, he had helped her many times, including with her child. 
But what about her? 
For her own purposes, she almost made him pay a huge price. 
So, this time, she truly wanted to help him! 
The car left the hospital, and Ye Ning thought he would take her straight to the auction. However, midway, he led her to a high-end women’s lifestyle store that she wouldn’t even dare to think about.
###Chapter 289: Chapter 289 She saw a girl named Chenxi
"Third Young Master..." 
"Don’t worry, this will all be deducted from your salary!" 
Ye Ning’s heart instantly fell to the ground and shattered into two halves.
This bastard, since he plans to deduct it from her salary, then why bring her to such a high-end place? It’s so expensive, how can she afford it? 
Ye Ning didn’t want to get out of the car, but at that moment, the salespeople from the lifestyle store, seeing the white Cayenne that had pulled up at their doorstep, were already coming out with great enthusiasm: "Miss, welcome, please come inside!" noveldrama
As they spoke, they actually took the initiative to open Ye Ning’s car door and then pulled and dragged her out. 
Ye Ning wanted to stamp her feet in frustration and kept looking back at the man sitting in the car, hoping he would "save" her. 
But this goddamn bastard, after parking the car, seemed as if he couldn’t see what was happening around him at all and was busy working on his phone. 
The bastard! 
Ye Ning had no choice but to be pulled inside by the group of salespeople. 
Pulled inside she was, and truly, the life store’s décor and style were among the best the city had to offer, and the clothes hanging there gave off a high-end and luxurious feel as soon as one walked in. 
My god, these must be incredibly expensive, right? 
Ye Ning looked at the clothes and didn’t dare to keep looking, as if afraid that purchasing them would mean she’d have to sell herself into servitude there. 
In fact, just as she walked in, she saw a young girl with black hair in a white dress, holding a piece of clothing she was trying on to take to the cashier. 
"Miss Chenxi, this piece really suits you perfectly. You are our VIP customer, so we will give you a 15 percent discount. The final price comes to 63,000." 
"Okay, wrap it up..." 
With just that indifferent remark, the girl referred to as Miss Chenxi handed over her card. 
63,000? 
And that’s the discounted price? 
Ye Ning’s vision began to blur, and she turned to flee the place, but at that moment, the two salespeople who had pulled her in had already selected several outfits for her: "Miss, we’ve picked out these clothes for you based on your figure and temperament. Come on, let’s go try them on." 
"This..." 
"It’s fine, go ahead and try. You’ll only know whether the clothes look good if you try them on." Without further ado, they pushed both the clothes and Ye Ning into the fitting room. 
One couldn’t blame their enthusiasm, considering the way she was dressed in a patient’s outfit and slippers. 
However, the white Cayenne that had brought her was not a car just anyone could afford, especially with such a rarely seen license plate number from A City. 
Ye Ning was pushed into the fitting room, and feeling helpless, she began to try on the clothes. 
Her figure was actually quite good; 160 cm tall with very proportionate measurements, so, when she put on those clothes, well, let’s say that when she emerged from the fitting room, people in the lifestyle shop were all drawn to her. 
Even the young girl in a white dress who had already completed her purchase was no exception. 
"So beautiful! Miss, these clothes look as though they were made just for you!" 
"Right? Miss, how old are you? This style of dress isn’t something just anyone can pull off." 
"Exactly..." 
Seeing this girl who, after coming out of the fitting room, had completely transformed from the one in the patient’s outfit, everyone’s eyes were filled with amazement and disbelief.
###Chapter 290: Chapter 290: Looking Down on Others with Dog’s Eyes!
Is this girl still in school? 
How can she wear this dress with such an ethereal aura?
The girl in the white dress, watching this girl emerge from the fitting room, also cast an appreciative glance. 
This girl really does have an amazing aura! 
Ye Ning was also looking at herself in the mirror, and to be honest, the dress was indeed nice. However, she had already seen the price tag inside: over eighty thousand yuan. It was far beyond what she could afford. 
So, when she saw everyone looking at her, she nitpicked to find fault, forcing out a comment, "Really? I don’t think this dress suits me very well. I’m not that young anymore; it’s no longer appropriate for me." 
"How can that be? You look so young, you should wear this. Look, you put it on and see how great your aura is." noveldrama
"No no, it’s still a bit unsuitable!" 
After Ye Ning spoke, she returned to the fitting room. 
The two sales assistants who had been enthusiastically recommending the dress started to get upset, especially the younger one. Upon seeing Ye Ning sneak a peek at the price tag, her attitude worsened, "Driving a Cayenne and can’t afford a dress costing over eighty thousand yuan?" 
"Impossible, right? How could someone who drives that kind of car not afford it? Maybe it’s really not suitable for her." 
"But she obviously looked so good in it..." 
"..." 
In the store, the assistants continued to whisper about the lost sale. 
A Cayenne? 
The girl in the white dress, who was picking out shoes, heard the gossip and her gaze shifted outside. 
Indeed, there was a white Cayenne parked on the open space outside the store, with a very auspicious license plate of six "9"s, and it was a brand-new model recently released. 
The car obviously cost a fortune, how could she not afford a dress? 
The girl in the white dress was also puzzled... 
As she was reflecting on this, Ye Ning came out of the fitting room with a bunch of clothes. Seeing the sales assistants frowning at her, she approached them, "I’m sorry for the trouble, having tried on so many clothes." 
"Miss, are you afraid your husband won’t buy it for you? Let me tell you, a woman still needs to dress up to keep a man’s heart." 
Husband? 
Ye Ning quickly gestured with her hands, "No no no, you’ve misunderstood, that’s not my husband." 
"Not your husband?" 
"Right, he’s just my boss. We had to rush out for an errand, and that’s why we came to buy clothes." 
Ye Ning was backed into a corner and had to explain the situation, hoping to shut them up. 
However, as soon as the sales assistants heard this, their attitudes changed completely. 
"So she’s just someone working for someone else!" 
"Yeah, we thought we had caught a wealthy client." 
"Wasting my energy..." 
"..." 
In just a few seconds, their words became as unsavory as could be. 
Ye Ning’s face flushed with anger. She was about to retaliate when suddenly, a voice filled the store, "So what if she’s working for someone? She’s not stealing or robbing anyone. Do you need to look down on her for that? How much is that dress? I’ll buy it for her!" 
It was the girl in the white dress! 
Upon seeing Miss Chenxi, the sales assistants panicked, "Miss Chenxi, we didn’t mean that. We just thought this miss looked beautiful in the dress, so..." 
Ye Ning was also stunned, seeing this stranger offering to buy the dress for her left her flabbergasted...
###Chapter 291: Chapter 291: Ou Mucen Comes In...
"No, no, no, how could I possibly let you do that? I don’t even know you, why would I let you buy me clothes?" 
"Don’t worry about it, it’s just a dress, I can afford to give it as a gift." With those words, she took out her card and handed it over again. 
Ye Ning started to panic! 
Of course, she would not want this girl to buy her clothes. Even though she was poor, she wasn’t at the point of accepting charity. 
She wanted to stop her from paying, but at that moment, the door of the boutique was suddenly pushed open: "What are you doing? Why is buying a dress taking so long?" 
It was the voice of a very angry man! 
Upon hearing it, Ye Ning immediately turned around, her gaze falling on a commanding figure with a straight, proud bearing, an astonishingly handsome face framed by an aura of signature cold sternness... 
My God! 
How had he come in? Wasn’t he waiting for her in the car? noveldrama
Ye Ning suddenly became nervous, "I just tried on two pieces, and they didn’t fit well, so..." 
"Mucen? Is that you?!!" 
"..." 
Ye Ning’s words were cut off halfway by another voice in the store, a voice filled with shock, ecstasy, disbelief... and as it rang out, all other sounds in the store fell quiet. 
Mucen? 
She was calling this man "Mucen," a nickname that conveyed intimacy? 
Ye Ning also closed her mouth, her eyes staring blankly at the girl in the white dress and the man who had just entered. 
But she saw the man freeze for a moment upon seeing the girl, showing a bit of surprise and disbelief. After just a few seconds, however, his expression returned to one of icy indifference: "What are you doing here?" 
The girl in the white dress suddenly looked uncomfortable, "I’ve just returned and was casually browsing around. I didn’t expect to run into you." 
Here was a man whose mere presence brought a powerful atmosphere, and with his sudden appearance, nearly everyone in the shop was nervous and inexplicably fearful. 
However, Ye Ning noted that the girl in the white dress, upon seeing the man, showed no fear at all; aside from a brief moment of discomfort, her expression was one of thrilled delight at the reunion. 
The young master of the prestigious Ou Family, and she wasn’t scared of him in the slightest—what exactly was their relationship? 
Ye Ning suddenly felt a pang of jealousy... 
"Mucen, why have you come back here? Did you come for me?" 
"..." 
No one paid attention to her, responding only with two cold glances cast abruptly in Ye Ning’s direction: "Why are you still standing here?" 
"Huh?" 
Ye Ning had not caught on. 
Why was she still standing here? 
What? 
Was she bothering them? Was she being a third wheel? 
Her face flushed with embarrassment, she was about to hastily leave the place when the girl in the white dress suddenly looked over at her: "So she’s your employee. Well, in that case, little sister, I should definitely give you the dress." 
What? 
Ye Ning was dumbfounded! 
The man standing opposite her also looked extremely displeased: "What are you talking about?" 
The girl in the white dress immediately explained with a smile: "Here’s what happened: she tried on a dress here, costing over eighty thousand yuan. Perhaps she didn’t have enough money, so she didn’t buy it. I thought it looked nice on her and was thinking of getting it for her as a gift." 
The girl in the white dress was sincere. Since this young lady was an employee of her boyfriend’s company, it wasn’t a big deal for her to buy her a dress; after all, she was helping her boyfriend’s business, wasn’t she?
###Chapter 292: Chapter 292: He took out money and slapped it on her face!
But she hadn’t anticipated that once these words left her mouth, the atmosphere in the store would plummet to freezing point! 
It was as if heavy, oppressive clouds had suddenly descended, the immense darkness suffocating everyone within, filling the shop with the terrifying sense of an impending storm. 
"Are you already so destitute?" 
"No, I’m not..." Ye Ning kept backing away, her eyes wide with terror as she looked at the man who was advancing towards her step by step, on the verge of tears. 
She didn’t ask him to buy her a dress; she insisted on buying it herself—how was this her fault? 
Yet today, Ou Mucen acted uncharacteristically explosive; his raging fury resembled that of a demon climbing out of hell. Hearing that she had actually asked the girl in the white dress to buy clothes, his uncontrollable anger erupted and he suddenly pulled out a stack of banknotes and threw them viciously at her face! 
"Is this enough? I can give you more! Have you sunk so low? Isn’t one of me enough for you? Do you really need to beg like a pauper for someone else’s charity? How cheap can you be?" 
Every sentence was malicious, every word brutal! 
At this moment, after the colorful banknotes were flung at the woman’s face, everyone in the shop was stunned, including the girl in the white dress who instantly covered her mouth, staring at the man in shock. 
How could this happen? 
Did she say something wrong? Why would he suddenly lose his temper like this? 
Moreover, the sales clerks were dumbfounded, staring at the man in horror, not daring to make a sound. 
But all their reactions paled in comparison to the other protagonist at the center of this storm—Ye Ning! 
Shock? Dismay? Disbelief? 
No, none of those. From the moment the banknotes hit her face, as she stood there, feeling the sting on her skin, her chest began to heave. 
Cheap? 
Beggar? 
Yes, she was a beggar, she was fallen, but it was not his place to lecture her! noveldrama
She fixed her gaze on him firmly, unafraid and defiant, her eyes tinged with blood, filled with an icy anger and disappointment that chilled to the bone, along with a deep resentment towards him. 
Ou Mucen’s hand paused suddenly, his rage stuck in his throat... 
"Cheap? You’re right, I am cheap. I’m shameless and degraded. President Ou, I suggest you fire me soon, to save your company’s reputation." 
"Young lady..." 
"Shut up! If you don’t speak, no one will take you for a mute!" 
Ye Ning glared fiercely at the woman, brushed off the banknotes that didn’t fall from her clothes, lifted her head, and with one last cold glance at the man in front of her, turned and left decisively, standing tall. 
Yes, she was cheap. If she weren’t cheap, she wouldn’t have come back to intervene in a plan about to succeed, risking her life. 
If she weren’t cheap, she wouldn’t keep softening her heart time and again despite knowing her purpose for being here, deceiving herself with excuses that the timing was not right. 
Ye Ning, how can you be so cheap? 
She swiftly got into a taxi she had hailed, and once seated in the back, she couldn’t hold back anymore. Finally, the tears began to fall, and with a "pop", they dropped, only to be stubbornly wiped away...
###Chapter 293: Chapter 293: Shen, are you still blaming me for walking away back then?
But just as it fell, she stubbornly wiped it away... 
Afterward, she opened the window, desperately letting the outside wind blow in, hitting her eyes, causing them pain, reminding them never to release that liquid again. 
Ye Ning, you brought this upon yourself! noveldrama
And in the lifestyle store behind her, after she left, the atmosphere did not ease but instead darkened and solidified even more. 
"Mucen, it’s just a dress, you... there’s no need to get so angry at her..." 
La Chenxi had never seen him so frightening before. Although he was always cold and aloof, he had never lost his temper in front of her, let alone such raging outbursts. 
La Chenxi swallowed hard and walked over, wanting to pat him on the shoulder. 
She remembered that in the past, whenever he was angry, a pat on his shoulder followed by a talk would always calm him down. 
But this time, just as she reached out, the man, exuding an icy chill, quickly avoided her: "Why are you here today?" 
Today? 
La Chenxi’s hand immediately froze mid-air: "I was just... just casually walking by today..." 
"Casually walking by?" The emotionless man coldly stared at her. 
His gaze was terrifying, void of any expression, yet like the whirling depth of night, with alternating darkness and light, it felt like staring into the blackest part of the night before dawn, making one shudder even at a glance. 
La Chenxi’s eyes narrowed, finally feeling overwhelmed, and lowered her head...
She wasn’t here just to casually walk by; from here to the city hall was only a ten-minute walk, and having heard that he would be at the auction today, she wanted to buy a nice dress and then go see him. 
La Chenxi bit her lip, finally admitting, "I’m sorry, Mucen, I just wanted to see you." 
See him? 
The man, in a terrible mood, sneered upon hearing this: "See me? What’s so good about seeing me? You can see me in the newspapers and news every day. If you’re worried that your concert here will lack an audience, rest assured, on account of our days at the same school, I’ll book the whole venue for you." 
"Mucen—" 
La Chenxi, who had mustered a lot of courage to say those words, turned pale at his response: "Are you still blaming me? For leaving all those years ago without saying anything?" 
"..." 
Ridiculous! 
Would he, Ou Mucen, bother to remember such a trivial matter for so long? 
The man, with frost and malice in his eyes, couldn’t muster the interest to look at her: "La Chenxi, you’re giving yourself too much credit. Have you ever seen me, Ou Mucen, lacking women?" 
His words completely shut the woman in front of him up! 
Would Ou Mucen lack women? 
Of course not. He is the distinguished third young master of the Ou Family, a favored son of heaven. How could such a man ever lack women? 
La Chenxi staggered, and ultimately, she watched the man walk away. 
The assistant who had been following her in the store saw this and hurriedly came over to comfort her: "Miss Chenxi, don’t be sad. The third young master probably thought the staff member truly annoyed you into buying clothes, that’s why he got angry. Maybe you should explain it to him?" 
Explain?
###Chapter 294: Chapter 294: Only She Knows, Why Was He So Furious?
No, she wouldn’t explain! 
She had realized earlier that the man flew into a rage simply because the girl had accepted La Chenxi’s favor. 
She understood him too well. Five years ago, her leaving without a word had become the topic he was most reluctant to mention and the person he least wanted to see in his eyes. 
But that girl, after meeting her, not only did she not keep her distance, but she also accepted her gifts and even became quite familiar with her. This was his taboo, as if she had stepped on his bottom line. 
That’s why he lashed out so excessively in his anger. 
He cursed the girl as a beggar, as lowly, and even threw money in her face, but in reality, it was all due to his frustration and disappointment in her. 
And such disappointment, if it weren’t for caring too much, would be completely unnecessary! 
The girl in the white dress standing in the store became pale when she thought of this, and her fingers curled up... 
"Xiaodu..." 
"Yes!"
"You go and check for me, what’s the name of the girl just now? What position does she hold at Osy?" 
"Miss means...?" 
"Nothing much, just to arrange a time to meet up, after all, this incident was triggered by me." She said this calmly with a pale face and left the store at once. noveldrama
The person capable of stirring his emotions to such irrationality was someone she certainly wanted to get to know well... 
—— 
Ye Ning sprinted back to her own hospital room. 
After returning to the room, she lay down with her head covered on the bed and remained there for a full hour. 
When Ji Chengzhi came with the prescription list, she was still lying in bed. Seeing this, he walked over to the edge of her bed, "How come? Still sleeping? I didn’t give you any sedative today." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning finally lifted the covers... 
Director Ji? 
Why has he come at this time? He wasn’t in the habit of coming in the afternoon before, was he? 
Ye Ning sat up from the bed: "Dr. Ji, is something the matter?" 
Ji Chengzhi smiled, "Nothing much, just here to deliver your prescription list and to inform you about the results of today’s blood tests, there’s basically nothing to worry about." 
After speaking, he handed over the items in his hand. 
Ye Ning quickly took them, she didn’t dare to look at the young director for fear that he might pick up on something off. 
But what she didn’t know was that the young director standing before her had been watching her ever since she uncovered the blanket, and when he saw her red eyes and the faint red marks on her face, a sigh escaped from the depths of his heart. 
That bastard, he didn’t bully her again, did he! 
"How are you feeling today?" 
"Much better!" 
"Is that so, then let’s schedule your discharge for tomorrow morning. I’ll prescribe some medicine for you to take home. Just rest up well at home." 
"Okay!" 
Of course Ye Ning felt better; she really didn’t want to stay in this place for another moment. Right now, she just wanted to leave as quickly as possible, to get away from everything related to that man. 
Seeing that she agreed, Ji Chengzhi left the hospital room, but as soon as he did, he promptly took out his phone: "She’s back, but what did you do to her? Red eyes, and there are also injuries on her face?" 
"..." 
After sending the message, there was strangely no response from the one who had just suggested he come check on her!
###Chapter 295: Chapter 295: Mr. Lin, You Can Actually Take Miss An Out For a Walk
What’s going on? 
Ji Chengzhi furrowed his brows and had no choice but to put his phone away again. 
This was just how he was; every time you tasked him with something, it was supposed to be a simple phone call or a WeChat message, but once it was done and you asked him what it was all about, whether he’d respond or not was entirely up to his mood. 
Ji Chengzhi didn’t bother with it anymore and went about his business. 
Meanwhile, after taking the prescription downstairs, Ye Ning stood there, glanced at the clock hanging in the hall, and pondered for a moment before suddenly pulling out her phone and dialing a number... 
"Aning..." 
"Brother Lin, I might be late getting home again tonight, could you please pick up Xiaobao for me?" 
Ye Ning tried to keep her voice even and moved to a less crowded spot to avoid letting people inside catch on. 
Fortunately, the person on the phone, after meeting her at the cafe that day, was no longer suspicious of her, and when he heard she had to work late again, he promptly agreed, "Okay, I’ll go pick him up shortly." noveldrama
"Mm, thank you, Brother Lin." 
"No need to be so polite. By the way, it’s the weekend tomorrow, and you’ll have a day off, why don’t you come over too?" 
Tomorrow? 
Ye Ning stood there, looking at the bustling hall behind her, and after a long while, finally nodded. 
It would be nice to sit down and have a chat. It had been a long time since they had sat down and talked properly since she came back here. 
Lin Yebai, hearing her agreement over the phone, was extremely pleased, and immediately gave instructions to the servant behind him, "Miss Ye will be coming over tomorrow, tidy up her room for her, and Mama Zhang, go buy some of her favorite dishes; she should be here in the morning." 
Miss Ye was Ye Ning’s identity at Tang Garden, nominally the cousin of a distant relative of Lin Yebai’s. 
The servants in the garden were thrilled to hear the news! 
Miss Ye was finally coming over? 
That was wonderful news. Due to the car accident, the mood in the garden had been grim these past few days, with everyone barely daring to breathe. Now that Miss Ye was coming, they could all sigh in relief. 
So Mama Zhang and the other servants quickly got to work. 
Assistant Xiaojin also heard the news and glanced at the time. It was almost time to pick up the children from kindergarten, so he drove over, "Sir, will Master Xiaobao also be staying here tonight?" 
Lin Yebai nodded, "Aning said she would be busy until very late tonight, so let’s not send the child over." 
"Alright!" 
Xiaojin, seeing his usually stern master finally smiling, felt his mood lift and couldn’t help but suggest, "Sir, since such an opportunity is rare, why don’t you take Miss An out? We received an invitation to the International Jewelry Appraisal Congress a few days ago, asking you to be a judge, and it coincides with this time." 
The International Jewelry Appraisal Congress? 
Japan? 
Lin Yebai’s brush paused mid-character on the rice paper... 
This suggestion was quite intriguing! 
—— 
When Secretary Gao went to the kindergarten, the child was already gone, so he asked a teacher there who said that the child’s mother had called, asking a Mr. Lin to pick the child up. 
Mr. Lin? 
Wasn’t that Lin Yebai? 
Secretary Gao was puzzled and quickly pulled out his phone to make a call, "Young Master, Xiaobao has already been picked up."
###Chapter 296: Chapter 296: You little rascal, I’ve secured you an opportunity to participate in an exhibition in Japan
"What?" The person on the other end of the phone seemed to be busy with something, with the faint noise of papers rustling and the sound of a keyboard being tapped. 
Secretary Gao, hearing this, had to explain further, "The teacher said, an Ning asked Lin Yebai to pick her up." 
"..." 
Then there was no more sound over the phone! 
Not the sound of talking, but even the noises of papers flipping, keyboards tapping and so on were gone. All that remained was the "zzzz" of the current on the line. 
Damn it! 
How could this silence... why did it give him the sensation that a thunderstorm was pressing down on him, leaving him gasping for breath? 
Secretary Gao swallowed with difficulty and wanted to explain further, but at that moment, there was a "snap" from the phone, and the call was disconnected... 
Beep beep beep beep... 
It’s over, his tyrant boss is angry again! 
But why should he be angry? That damn kid, wasn’t he always despised by him? And that woman—he always found her annoying, thinking she did nothing but trouble him. Now that they finally won’t bother him anymore, he should be happy, right? What’s there to be angry about?
Secretary Gao was truly puzzled! 
But what he didn’t know was that just when he had hung up the phone, in the president’s office on the fifteenth floor of the Ou Corporation building, a man enveloped in an icy aura of anger had just thrown an invitation that had been newly delivered onto his desk into the waste bin. 
"Third young master, the old chairman is on the line..." 
The old chairman? 
Why was that old man calling him? 
The man, already upset, had no interest in taking the call and said "Don’t answer," and hung up the phone. 
If there’s nothing important, just rest at home. Why bother me? 
His mood was very bad. After hanging up, he was about to get up to pour himself a glass of water when his mobile phone on the desk rang again. He picked it up and saw it wasn’t the old man from their family, then who else could it be? 
Wasn’t he annoyed enough? 
He scowled deeply, nearly turning off the phone altogether! noveldrama
"Hello..." 
"You little brat, why didn’t you answer my call? Are you asking for a beating?" As soon as the call was connected, sure enough, an angry voice came from the receiver. 
The man, already in a bad mood, quickly held the phone away from his ear, "If you shout any louder, do you believe I’ll hang up right now?" 
"You dare!!!" 
Old Mr. Ou was about to explode with anger at his own son. 
What kind of son was this? Talking to him with such a tone, who was actually the son here? 
But indeed, after being threatened like that, the voice on the phone really did get quieter: "You little rascal, how dare you threaten your old man? I called you to tell you about an invitation. Have you received it?" 
"What invitation?" The man in the dark wasn’t even remembering the thing he had just thrown in the trash bin. 
Hearing this on the phone, the old man had to patiently explain, "It’s an invitation to an international jewelry appraisal convention in Japan. Haven’t you always said I don’t support your Yuzhirun? Fine, this time, I’ve secured an opportunity for you. You can take Yuzhirun’s products to the exhibition, and if you succeed there, you little brat, your Yuzhirun will take off." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
International Jewelry Appraisal Convention? 
He blinked, finally remembering such a thing, and immediately dug through the trash bin to retrieve that item.
###Chapter 297: Chapter 297 She Doesn’t Need His Charity
Indeed, that’s the invitation to the international jewelry appraisal conference. 
"Dad, is this appraisal conference very famous?" 
"Nonsense! It’s held only once every three years and is the exhibition that everyone in the jewelry industry around the world is dying to attend. When the time comes, all the big shots will be there, along with business and political figures. You tell me, is that famous or not?" 
It’s famous; indeed, it’s very famous! 
The young man, who had just entered the industry, finally relaxed a bit after hearing his dad’s words over the phone: "Alright, then I’ll go and make the arrangements." 
Ou Mucen’s grandfather was satisfied: "Good that you understand. Remember, this is a very important opportunity for you. Whether Yuzhirun can succeed or not depends on you. Also, when you go this time, remember to go with the La family’s daughter." 
The La family’s daughter? 
Why? noveldrama
The man who hadn’t hung up the phone immediately looked upset: "Why do I have to go with her?" 
The old man glared: "Her dad is a diplomat in Japan, now you tell me whether you should take her or not?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
—— 
Ye Ning didn’t worry too much that night after making sure Xiaobao was well taken care of. After eating dinner upon returning to her hospital room, she spent her last night in the hospital on that small hospital bed. 
After one night passed, the next morning, Ji Chengzhi lived up to his promise, indeed issuing her discharge papers as soon as he started work, and then she went to settle her hospital bills. 
"Excuse me, may I ask how much it is?" 
"You don’t need to pay for this, your bill has already been put under Third Young Master’s account, it will be settled automatically." 
"..." 
When she was settling the bill, she actually wanted to pay herself, but the cashier, just as Ji Chengzhi had told her that day, said the fees had already been settled by that man. 
Settled? 
She remembered the insults that man had hurled at her in the life hall the day before, and suddenly, a trace of mockery flashed across her lips... 
Because she was a beggar? Too poor to buy a dress, too poor to afford medical bills, so he was giving her alms? 
She handed over her bank card coldly: "No need, you print out the bill and see how much it is, just take the exact amount." 
"But..." 
"Don’t worry, I’ll explain it clearly to your director." She left no room for negotiation, her attitude very firm. 
Seeing this, the cashier finally took her bank card and processed the payment. 
Is this woman crazy? 
Someone was paying her medical bills, and she didn’t want it. She was truly foolish. 
As the cashier took the payment, she looked at Ye Ning more than once with an eye that said ’what an idiot’, but Ye Ning pretended not to notice. Once the cashier finished collecting the money, Ye Ning picked up her simple luggage and left. 
"Aning, have you come? We’re waiting for you to have breakfast over here." 
Just as she left the hospital, Lin Yebai called her on the phone, urging her to hurry. 
Upon seeing that, Ye Ning casually hailed a taxi and got in: "I’m already in the car, I’ll be there quickly. You guys can start eating, no need to wait for me." 
"It’s okay, we just got up not long ago. Be careful on the way." 
The man on the phone still had the same gentle voice as always, and his tone conveyed his uniquely gentle and elegant manner. Hearing this, Ye Ning didn’t know why, but she felt something warm well up inside her, and her mood wasn’t as bad as before. 
That’s right, things weren’t that terrible after all. Once it’s all over, everything will naturally get back to usual.
###Chapter 298: Chapter 298: Aning, let’s go to Japan together tomorrow!
When she arrived at Tang Garden by taxi, the people in the garden were indeed waiting for her. Seeing her arrival, the servants came over to take her luggage, while Lin Yebai, holding the immaculately dressed Little Baozi, stood under the grape trellis looking at her. 
"Mommy, did you finally arrive? I’m starving to death!" Upon seeing his mother enter, Little Baozi immediately rushed over and threw himself into her arms. 
Ye Ning, upon seeing him, quickly bent down and picked him up, "Oh, my darling, are you starving? Well, then you should eat quickly." 
"But I couldn’t, how could I eat before Mommy got here?" 
Little Baozi, basking in the sunshine, looked plump and pink in her arms, which made Ye Ning couldn’t help but plant a kiss on his chubby little face. 
"Xiaobao, you didn’t say anything to Uncle Lin, did you?" 
Ye Xiaobao quickly shook his head, "No, Mommy, don’t worry, I’m not a traitor!" 
Pfft! 
This little rascal even knows the word traitor. 
Ye Ning was both amused and exasperated, but since her son had said so, she was reassured. So, holding him, they went to the round table under the grape trellis, which was already laden with a sumptuous breakfast. 
"Wow, today’s breakfast is really extravagant, Brother Lin, did you make a big fortune recently?" 
"Why do you say that?" 
"It’s simple, you always just cobbled something together for breakfast at home. Suddenly, it’s so lavish; if that’s not making money, then what is?" Ye Ning sat down, smiling, looking very happy. 
Lin Yebai, seeing her, quickly revealed a faint smile behind his glasses. "Yeah, you’re right. So, I’ve decided to go out and relax. How about it? Will you join me?" 
"Relax?" 
Ye Ning picked up a small steamed bun with her chopsticks and was about to eat when she stopped upon hearing this, "Where are you going to relax?" 
"Japan. There’s also a bit of business to attend to. There’s an appraisal event there, and they’ve invited me to be a judge. I thought I’d take the opportunity to have some fun." 
"..." 
Appraisal event? 
Ye Ning bowed her head and continued eating her breakfast... 
That’s what it was. After all, for someone at his level, such events were nothing new. He was the renowned Lin Yebai, whose hands and eyes had identified countless authentic and fake gems. Who else would they invite if not him? 
So she bit into her dumpling and laughed, "I won’t go. They invited you, not me. They definitely wouldn’t be pleased if I came along." 
"Why wouldn’t they be pleased?" 
"Because they would have to pay!" Ye Ning said cleverly, her clear eyes brimming with youthful vivacity and playfulness. 
Lin Yebai was momentarily distracted, unable to tear his gaze away... 
It had been a long time since she had smiled at him like that. 
Lin Yebai stared for a while before he finally averted his eyes. 
"The person I’m taking doesn’t need to pay. I’ve already booked your ticket. Have Xiaojin accompany you to buy some suitable clothes this afternoon, and we’ll take the eight o’clock flight tomorrow morning." 
"Ah?" noveldrama
The pastry in Ye Ning’s spoon dropped back into the bowl. 
Ye Xiaobao, sitting beside her, also lifted his round little face in surprise. 
What’s going on? Was Uncle Lin making decisions on his own again? 
The four-year-old, seeing the smile disappear from his mother’s face, furrowed his little brow in concern, "Uncle Lin, my mommy has to work, you know?" 
"No problem, she can just take a leave," Lin Yebai said nonchalantly.
###Chapter 299: Chapter 299: She is His Canary
Ye Xiaobao was a bit displeased and wanted to say something more, but at that moment, someone next to him handed over a meatball, "Alright, eat up quickly, it’s getting cold." 
It was Mom! 
Ye Xiaobao immediately looked at her, "Mom..." 
"Be good, eat up. Once you’ve finished, come with Mom to pack the luggage. Don’t worry, even though Mom and Uncle aren’t taking you with us, we’ll still buy you lots of tasty treats and even your favorite Transformers model. Uncle will definitely get it for you." 
In just a span of ten or so seconds, the young woman sitting in the dining chair regained her usual smile. 
Seeing this, Ye Xiaobao stopped talking and sulkily ate his food. 
Lin Yebai thought he was really angry about not being taken to Japan and tried to please him by serving him a small steamed bun, "Don’t worry, Xiaobao, you’re Uncle’s godson. How could Uncle possibly forget about you?" 
Ye Xiaobao: "..." noveldrama
He said nothing more and just bowed his head to sullenly eat! 
And so, after Ye Ning had her breakfast, she set out with Xiaojin, and afterward, she shopped for clothes, shoes, cosmetics, got her hair done...in various upscale malls around the city. 
Of course, these items weren’t actually picked out by her but had been arranged beforehand, waiting for her to come and simply try them on to see if they fit. 
With such arrangements, there was no time wasted throughout the day, and by the time Ye Ning had finished her shopping and made herself look pretty, she returned to Tang Garden just in time for dinner. 
"How about it? Are you satisfied with what you bought today?" 
Lin Yebai had been at home keeping Xiaobao company. Seeing her return, he stepped forward to take the items she was carrying. 
Ye Ning smiled, "Quite. It’s just... it cost you money again!" 
"What are you talking about? Between you and me, do we need to be so formal?" Lin Yebai sat down next to the dining table and called for the servants in the garden to start serving the dishes. 
Ye Ning saw this, washed her hands, and sat down too... 
She truly didn’t need to be formal with him. Over the years, had she not spent his money, used his things? 
Ye Ning looked at her son, "Xiaobao, were you well-behaved while with Uncle Lin today?" 
"Yes, Uncle Lin took me to the children’s amusement park." 
"Is that so? Then hurry up and eat. Afterward, go take a bath; otherwise, you’ll be going to sleep soon." Ye Ning gave him an instruction and began serving food into her son’s bowl.
Ye Xiaobao didn’t resist and obediently finished his meal at the table, after which she had Aunt Zhang take him upstairs to bathe. 
With the child gone, the dining table quieted down. At first, Ye Ning didn’t notice anything, but as she ate, she felt two gazes on her and looked up, "Brother Lin, why... are you always looking at me? Aren’t you going to eat?" 
Lin Yebai was somewhat lost in thought and, realizing she suddenly looked up at him, quickly averted his gaze in panic. 
"No, I was just thinking about showing you some of the sights we’re going to see in Japan after you finish your meal to see if you like them." 
Sights in Japan? 
Ye Ning smiled, "Brother Lin, I’ve never been to Japan. You make the plans. I trust you." 
"Okay, that works. I’ll give you your passport, ID card, and plane ticket now." With that, he went to the desk, took her documents and a plane ticket, and handed them to her. 
Ye Ning paused...
###Chapter 300: Chapter 300: Ou Mucen is here too?
Was he really going to give her her real ID and passport? 
After all this time, was he finally going to give it to her? 
For a moment, Ye Ning reached out to take her belongings, but as her hand moved, memories of the past tumbled through her mind, along with the image of this man’s eyes quietly observing her. Her intention firmly suppressed, she withdrew her hand. 
"Better not, my current identity still can’t be exposed, and it might be dangerous to keep these with me. You hold on to them for me." 
"In that case..." 
As expected, just by saying that, she saw a glimmer of relief in his eyes. Without hesitation, he stuffed her documents and the plane ticket back into his briefcase. 
Ye Ning saw this, her gaze fell slightly, and she said nothing more, continuing with her meal. 
Perhaps because she had still entrusted him with her documents, the topics they discussed thereafter were inconsequential. When they finished eating, Ye Ning went straight upstairs. 
"Mom, are you really going to Japan? You just got out of the hospital, won’t it be too much to travel so far?" 
Upon reaching upstairs, as expected, the little one who hadn’t slept yet immediately asked with concern. 
Ye Ning sat down and pulled the chubby Little Tuanzi into her arms, "No, Uncle Lin will be there, he’ll take care of Mommy." 
"But he didn’t even ask you and just decided you should go to Japan. Aren’t you angry, Mom?" 
Angry? 
Ye Ning looked at her nails done just that afternoon and after a long pause, a hint of helplessness finally flickered at the corner of her eyes, "Ye Xiaobao, remember, Uncle Lin does everything for our sake. He takes care of you and Mommy, and that is our blessing, understand?" 
Ye Xiaobao nodded, only half understanding, "Oh!" 
Blessing? 
What exactly is a blessing? 
Ye Xiaobao still didn’t quite understand... 
—— 
Because of the 8 a.m. flight, the next morning Ye Ning got up at six. After a quick wash, she got into Lin Yebai’s car, and they were driven to the airport by Xiaojin. 
"Sir, last night there was a call from Japan, asking whether we will be staying in Osaka or Tokyo?" 
"..." 
Osaka and Tokyo aren’t too far apart, just over five hundred kilometers. Osaka is much quieter than Tokyo, and the scenery is also more beautiful. 
Lin Yebai flipped through a list in his hands upon hearing this, "Are the organizers covering everything this time?" 
"Yes, it’s all-inclusive for exhibitors and jurors. However, it seems that in Osaka they’ve arranged accommodations for more important guests, reportedly all high-end villas near hot springs, while in Tokyo, it’s just hotels." 
Important guests? 
Lin Yebai looked at the list of exhibitors faxed from Japan last night and scanned through it until his eyes suddenly stopped on one name. 
Yuzhirun? 
Yuzhirun actually qualified to attend such an international jewelry conference? 
His pupils narrowed instantly, and his fingers gripping the list began to turn white. 
Xiaojin, still unaware of this, after handing over the list and seeing that his boss hadn’t said a word, asked again, "So sir, where will we stay? In Osaka?" noveldrama
PS: Sorry for the late update today, normal posting times are around 12:00 noon and 8:00 in the evening, muah muah muah muah
###Chapter 301: Chapter 301: His... Wife?
Given his status and the purpose of his trip with Miss An, Xiaojin would not even consider it; he would assume that the gentleman would definitely choose Osaka. 
Osaka has such great options – villas, hot springs, and all sorts of famous Japanese PAs. He believed that given the gentleman’s feelings for Miss An, he would surely want to make her stay more comfortable and to provide her with the best possible hospitality. 
However, what he didn’t expect was for the gentleman, after reviewing the list for quite a while, to drop two cold words: "Tokyo!" 
Tokyo? 
Xiaojin looked towards the rearview mirror in surprise... 
No way, why would the gentleman choose Tokyo? With Osaka’s environment being so nice, and since he brought Miss An over, why would he choose to stay at a hotel in Tokyo? 
Xiaojin didn’t quite understand! 
But if he had seen the people on that list, perhaps he would have known. A brand that emerged out of nowhere appearing at such a globally watched jewelry appraisal event – could his status possibly still be of one staying at the Tokyo Hotel? 
Lin Yebai did not explain much; after deciding on the place, he had Xiaojin drive the two of them to the hotel. 
Upon arriving at the hotel, the Japanese organizers, having received the news, personally escorted them to the presidential suite that had been prepared in advance: "Mr. Lin, how did you think to stay here? Actually, we’ve already arranged a better place for you in Osaka." 
Indeed, even the organizers didn’t quite understand. 
Lin Yebai smiled, looking towards the woman organizing her luggage near the cabinet, smiled again: "Tokyo is every woman’s paradise, naturally, I have to stay in Tokyo." 
The organizers took one look and understood... 
"It seems Mr. Lin is a man of sentiment. Alright, later I’ll have the hotel staff bring some shopping guides. You can take those and bring your lady around. At around seven in the evening, we’ll have a feast in the banquet hall downstairs to welcome and cleanse the dust off you, Mr. Lin, please be sure to come." 
The organizers were extremely respectful of Lin Yebai, and upon hearing that his intent for staying here was to allow the lady in the room to enjoy shopping, they promptly accommodated him. 
The lady? 
Lin Yebai’s thoughts were not on the arrangements, but on the word "the lady" that was spoken. 
The lady?
Something in his heart skipped a beat, and his mood became cheerful. 
And what about Ye Ning behind him? noveldrama
She was still packing their luggage. She had never been to Japan and didn’t know Japanese, so she didn’t understand at all what the two had just been talking about. 
Therefore, after seeing that the man had finally left, she dragged his suitcase over to him: "Brother Lin, which room are you going to stay in? I’ve taken this one, Xiaojin that one, which one do you want?" 
The presidential suite has many rooms. There were only three of them, so she certainly had to ask. 
Yet, the man standing by the sofa didn’t answer her question, but suddenly took her hand: "No need to tidy up now, you must be hungry after sitting on the plane for so long. Let’s go down and eat something." 
Eat something? 
Ye Ning, looking at him holding her hand, felt slightly uneasy. Her gaze lowered, and she withdrew her hand under the pretense of carrying luggage: "Okay, I’ll first take your luggage to the room, and then we’ll call Xiaojin."
###Chapter 302: Chapter 302: Stunning
After speaking, she didn’t wait for his agreement and dragged the suitcase over: "Xiaojin? Xiaojin? We’re going down to eat." 
"Okay, coming right out!" 
"..." 
Lin Yebai’s face stiffened for a moment, and a hint of disappointment surfaced from the bottom of his heart. 
In the past, he remembered that a simple pull or touch would not have left her so indifferent. noveldrama
Lin Yebai stood at the door and eventually saw Ye Ning and Xiaojin come out together. Then the three of them left the room and went downstairs. 
"What are we going to eat?" 
"Anything is fine, I’m not picky," Ye Ning was easygoing about this matter. 
Hearing this, Lin Yebai decided to use this opportunity to take her out to eat and then to look around, perhaps to buy her a dress for the upcoming banquet and the appraisal event tomorrow. Due to the rush decision this time, she hadn’t prepared dresses for the banquet and the appraisal event. 
Xiaojin understood his master’s intention and went to arrange the car. After giving the car keys to him, he tactfully went back. 
With Xiaojin gone, Lin Yebai felt much better. He took the oblivious Ye Ning out of the hotel. They grabbed a quick bite to eat, and then he directly took her to a high-end place specializing in custom-made dresses. 
"Aning, I want to take you to the jewelry appraisal event this time." 
"Ah?" 
Ye Ning was surprised: "Me?" 
Lin Yebai nodded, "Yes, it’s a rare opportunity. Haven’t you always wanted to see jewelry from all around the world? Tomorrow’s the event, and I have already spoken to the organizers. You can enter as my... assistant." 
He hid the fact that the organizers had misunderstood her identity. 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Is this true? 
If that was the case, she would definitely go. She hurriedly agreed, and she also readily consented to his suggestion of dressing formally for the occasion. 
Seeing her believe him, Lin Yebai breathed a sigh of relief, and then he took her to buy a dress. 
It was a large store, filled with various dresses, all, of course, of exquisite styles and quality, and finely made. 
Once they arrived, Lin Yebai didn’t interfere much. Seeing this, Ye Ning went over to the racks, picked for a while, and chose a light yellow strapless, cheongsam-style dress. The dress was beautiful, made of satin, with some small pearls hand-sewn onto it. 
Lin Yebai thought it looked good as well, so he let her go in to try it... 
"Miss, does the size fit?" 
"..." 
Halfway through trying it on, the store clerk, seeing that she hadn’t come out for a long time, started to urge her from outside. 
Ye Ning covered her chest, her face flushed with shy embarrassment. 
It couldn’t be more fitting — her figure was naturally excellent, with a 84D bust, a 62cm waist, and 86cm hips... 
My God! 
She absolutely couldn’t go out like this. She had never exposed herself so much in her life! 
She stealthily cracked open the fitting room door and motioned to the clerk: "Do you have any more conservative dresses here?" 
Conservative? 
The clerk was Japanese and didn’t understand English very well. Hearing her ask for something more conservative, he mistook her request and opened the fitting room door wider. 
As a result, a collective gasp rose from the store, and all eyes inside turned towards her. 
Including the man and woman who had just walked through the door!
###Chapter 303: Chapter 303: How Did He Get Here?
Indeed, it was a breathtaking figure that left one gasping for air! 
The first thing that caught the eye was the light yellow strapless gown. The exquisite design and superior fabric outlined her fair and delicate figure without leaving anything to the imagination. Her hair was newly styled, a faint chestnut color setting off her snowy skin. As she made her appearance, the ethereal quality of a sprite descended to the mortal realm was fully displayed before everyone. 
Where on earth did this woman come from? 
The man who had entered through the door slightly opened his mouth as if he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. 
Lin Yebai was also looking in that direction, witnessing her dressed up like this for the first time. When he saw her suddenly pulled to stand there, her fair and glossy skin, her graceful and enticing figure seemed like a ripe, juicy peach that couldn’t be covered up. Instantly, his eyes darkened and his Adam’s apple moved! 
"Gululu..." 
That was a very soft sound of swallowing, almost inaudible unless you listened closely. 
However, as a man, he was particularly sensitive to such a sound, especially in this dead silence. 
Soon after Lin Yebai’s throat moved, the man at the door, who had been staring at the woman, immediately furrowed his brows and looked over in his direction. 
Lin Yebai? 
Could it actually be him? 
His gaze suddenly darkened, so deep and black it was spine-chilling. 
The female companion next to him also saw the scene and was shocked to see that the girl appearing from inside was the same girl she had met at the lifestyle store a few days ago: "Miss An, how could it be you?" 
Miss An? 
Ye Ning, who had been panicking and covering her chest, suddenly heard someone call her by that name and immediately looked up. 
La Chenxi? How could she be here, too? 
No, and the man with her... 
Suddenly, Ye Ning’s expression froze. Her eyes opened wide in absolute shock as she stared at the man who had unexpectedly appeared there.
It was a figure brimming with coldness. The lighting in the store, already dim to set the mood, seemed to fade even further behind his tall frame. Ye Ning found herself in a daze, the lights growing dim in front of her eyes. 
Oh my God! 
How did he come to be here as well? 
And even accompanied by this La Chenxi. 
She was somewhat unable to collect her thoughts. 
On the other hand, Yebai, hearing someone suddenly call out to her, glanced sideways and saw the two people at the entrance. He slightly changed expression, took off his suit jacket, and walked over to her: "Aning, come here!" 
He called out very gently. The suit jacket was passed over very quickly. In the blink of an eye, the beautiful curves that the girl had just been showing off to everyone were all wrapped up in his spacious suit jacket. 
The man at the door saw this, and his pupils constricted. Danger, chilliness, and a hint of murderous intent swirled in his eyes. 
She actually touched and wore clothes that had been tainted by another man’s presence? 
She really must not want to live! 
Ye Ning was also taken aback: "Brother Lin, this..." 
"If you don’t like it, go and change. We’ll go somewhere else afterwards to take a look," Lin Yebai said, like the most elegant gentleman, as he pushed the girl wrapped up in his suit jacket back into the fitting room and gently closed the door for her. 
With the door closed, the people in the shop, no longer having anything interesting to watch, naturally stopped staring their way and went about their business.noveldrama
###Chapter 304: Chapter 304 Ou Mucen, that’s enough!
Lin Yebai noticed, and then he turned around with a calm smile that was neither cold nor warm, and walked toward the man at the door. "What a coincidence, Mr. Ou, we meet again." 
Mr. Ou? 
He actually knew him? 
Standing beside La Chenxi, who was surprised to see the young man wearing glasses, handsome and elegant, asked, "Mucen, do you know him?" 
Know him? 
The man who had been standing at the door with a stern face for quite some time looked at the person who came to stand in front of him and finally, coldly threw out a sentence, "Mr. Lin really is capable of anything, huh? In just one day, you’ve managed to lure my assistant here." 
The smell of gunpowder was slowly rising, and from one listen, it was not the start of anything good! 
Ye Ning, hiding in the fitting room, pricked up her ears to listen, and when she heard this, her fingers tightened and cold sweat emerged from her palms. 
These two, they couldn’t be about to start arguing again, could they? 
She remembered the last time they had a big fight at the hospital and suddenly felt her entire heart hanging in suspense. 
Yes, although she hated that man very much, she didn’t want them to argue in public either. 
Lin Yebai had not expected his words to be so unpleasant. For a moment, he felt he was losing face, "Why would Mr. Ou speak like this? An Ning is my apprentice, and I want to take her wherever I want. That’s my freedom. Can you even call that luring?" 
"How can it not be called luring? Mr. Lin suddenly appears here, and I suppose it’s for that appraisal meeting, right? Since that’s the case, as my assistant who has signed a high-level confidentiality agreement, am I not entitled to suspect that you brought her here to extract secrets from my company?" 
"What are you saying?" 
"Moreover, the products I’m exhibiting this time were all handled by her. As a judge of the exhibition, bringing her here without my consent, don’t you think that’s suspicious?" 
"You—" 
This man’s mouth was indeed lethal, and with just a few words, he had even the usually good-tempered Lin Yebai at a loss for words. 
What kind of talk is that? 
Spouting malicious lies, framing others? 
Ye Ning couldn’t listen any longer inside the fitting room. Bursting out, she strode towards the entrance, "Ou Mucen, enough is enough! If you have a problem with me, just say it directly. Don’t pin those unfounded charges onto my master’s head!" 
Unfounded charges? 
She finally came out? And she was speaking up for her master? 
The man’s eyes instantly darkened, and, filled with rage, the corners of his lips curved into an ironic smile, "Oh? You want to protect your master?" 
Ye Ning’s face was filled with anger, "So what if I do? Let me tell you, Ou Mucen, we have no relationship anymore. From now on, I’m not your employee, and you’re no longer my boss. If you want compensation for the breach of contract, I’ll give you double. So please, from now on, stay away from me!" 
That’s right, from the moment he threw money in her face and cruelly insulted her, calling her lowly, like a beggar, she was no longer his employee. noveldrama
Ye Ning might be eager for revenge and without money, but she had not sunk so low as to let anyone trample on her dignity! 
However, Ou Mucen, who had been staring at her the whole time, when he heard that she not only wanted to "quit the company like throwing away a squid," but also told him to stay away, his gaze froze completely, "Say that again?" 
Word by word, his voice sounded as if it came from a demon crawling out of hell, so terrifying that even a glance caused fear and trembling.
###Chapter 305: Chapter 305: Ou Mucen, I Have Nothing to Do with You!
Ye Ning’s face turned white, and for a moment, she felt the urge to step back. 
The man was terrifying, and although she had found the courage to say so much just before, when she saw the murderous look in his eyes, she couldn’t help but feel fear. It was like a natural reaction. 
But as she was about to step back, her eyes caught sight of the woman standing behind him. 
That woman, at this moment, had a very calm expression, her eyes watching them as if she were enjoying a play, filled with a sense of amusement. Suddenly, Ye Ning’s lifted foot halted in its tracks. 
Right, she had forgotten, they were a couple! 
The fear in her eyes vanished instantaneously, replaced with a coldness colder than frost: "Say it a hundred times, it’s still the same, Ou Mucen, I have nothing to do with you!" 
Each word was spoken with an icy cold voice, her tone as unfamiliar as if they were strangers who had never met. 
Ou Mucen was stunned for a moment. The raging fury within him came to a jarring halt! 
No relation at all? 
She was saying she had no relation with him? 
His fingers curled inside his pockets as his dark eyes, filled with surging emotions, stared at her. Then, his pupils became so dark that one couldn’t see the fingers before them.
It was a more terrifying malevolence than before. 
Lin Yebai sensed something was off and quickly pulled the woman standing before him back: "Mr. Ou, you’ve heard it. My apprentice is no longer an employee of your company. Please don’t harass her in the future." 
With that, he took the woman’s hand and quickly left the store. noveldrama
The remaining people in the store warily watched the man still standing at the entrance, as if the next second he would completely decimate the place. 
La Chenxi didn’t dare make a sound. She was a smart girl and had already confirmed from that scene that the girl was the one who now occupied a place in his heart. 
His anger, the venomous words, his threats against her all stemmed from his fury, jealousy, and inability to tolerate seeing her with another man. 
But sadly, he seemed not to understand what he was doing; therefore, she wouldn’t point it out. She enjoyed watching the two of them argue and quite liked hearing what the girl had just said... 
In the future, she would have nothing to do with Ou Mucen! 
Since it was such a good turn of events, why prevent it? 
She quietly stood behind him, neither advising nor intervening, as sensible as if she were just one of his followers. 
The other people in the store were somewhat frightened because since those two left, this man standing at the doorway had been enveloped by a terrifying atmosphere. His overwhelming presence was suffocating. 
It wasn’t until ten minutes had passed that the man finally moved. The girl in white who had followed him came over softly: "Mucen, let’s go back first. Dad should be waiting for us." 
Their visit was largely due to her dad’s request, so meeting him was expected. 
But to her surprise, after saying this, the man who had stood motionless for so long didn’t say anything and just turned and walked out.
###Chapter 306: Chapter 306 What are you going to do, sir?
What was he going to do? 
La Chenxi saw him and quickly followed, "Mucen, where are you going? The car is over there!" 
Nobody responded to her, leaving her with only a silhouette that, upon emergence, immediately got into a taxi; the entire movement was done in one swift, fluid motion. 
What was this person trying to do? 
La Chenxi stood on the roadside, stamping her foot in frustration, but she was utterly out of ideas! 
He had never lost his composure like this before. Could it be that that woman really had such a significant impact on him? 
She looked at the disappearing figure, and finally, the fingers of the hand holding her purse slowly turned pale... 
—— 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, after being brought back to the hotel by Lin Yebai, had entered her own room; after stating she was tired, she was ready to go to bed and rest. 
Lin Yebai kept watching her. Although she seemed to look normal, the restlessness in her eyes was very apparent. His eyes darkened, and without a word, he gently closed the door for her and left. 
"Sir, didn’t you say you were taking the young lady to buy a dress? Why didn’t you buy one?" 
After coming out, Xiaojin, who had stayed in the suite the whole time without leaving, immediately made him a cup of coffee. 
Lin Yebai sat down on the sofa, looking at the list on the coffee table, and suddenly, his pupils narrowed, "Xiaojin, make a call to the organizers, ask what Yuzhirun has brought for the exhibition this time." 
Yuzhirun? 
Ou Mucen?!! 
Xiaojin was shocked by the news, "Sir, he’s here too?" 
Lin Yebai nodded, "It’s probably due to La Shiwen. Go see what he’s brought." 
The girl he hadn’t met earlier was called Miss Li by the shop staff, and he quickly recalled an embassy diplomat in Japan with the surname Li. 
Thus, on the way here, the question that he hadn’t figured out now had an answer: Yuzhirun’s attendance here was all thanks to La Shiwen. noveldrama
Understanding this, Xiaojin immediately made a call, and within a few minutes, they received a response. 
"Sir, they say it’s a pair of bracelets!" 
"Bracelets?" 
"Yes!" Xiaojin answered honestly. 
A pair of bracelets, at such an international exhibition, wouldn’t usually attract much attention; they could even be described as quite ordinary. 
Therefore, at this moment, Xiaojin somewhat looked down on such items. 
However, the man sitting on the sofa, upon hearing that it was a pair of Jade Bracelets, suddenly showed a trace of seriousness between his brows. 
In such a setting, with such an opportunity, would that man really be so foolish as to bring just two ordinary Jade Bracelets? 
He remembered everything that had happened in the store earlier, and his gaze started to become more and more sinister, while at the same time, the aura surrounding him grew colder! 
"Xiaojin, I have something to do, I’m going out for a bit." 
"..." 
Now? 
Xiaojin looked at the time, "Sir, the banquet is about to start. Where are you going?" 
Lin Yebai stood up from the sofa, not planning to stay, "When it’s time, take Aning downstairs first, I’ll be back soon." 
After speaking, he took his coat and left. 
Xiaojin, seeing this, could only sit down helplessly on the sofa, waiting for the woman in the room to wake up. 
An hour later, it was finally time for the banquet in the hotel. 
"Hello, Mr. Lin, the banquet has already started downstairs. When will you be coming down?"
###Chapter 307: Chapter 307: When Did She Become Mrs. Lin?
"Hello, Mr. Lin, the banquet downstairs has already started. May I ask when you’ll be coming down?" 
"Alright, I’ll be right down!" 
Xiaojin received the call and hurried to Ye Ning’s room to get her. 
Ye Ning had actually gone to bed late as well. When she first got into bed, she tossed and turned for a long while because she was upset, and didn’t fall asleep until it was almost time for the banquet, dozing off only briefly. 
When she heard that the banquet had already begun, she sat up from the bed, "Where’s Brother Lin?" 
"He went out to handle some matters. He asked us to go ahead first," Xiaojin replied as she saw Ye Ning getting up in a daze, and brought over the cocktail dress that had been delivered not long ago. 
The banquet downstairs was not just any ordinary banquet. If she dressed too simply, it would seem a bit shabby. 
Ye Ning understood this as well, so she got out of bed and went to the bathroom to get ready. 
Fifteen minutes later, the two of them finally left the room... 
"Xiaojin, Brother Lin hasn’t returned yet. Wouldn’t it be awkward for us to go over like this?" 
"No, don’t you remember this morning when we came back? It was the manager of the event who brought me in. He has already seen us," Xiaojin didn’t mention the organizer’s mistake about her identity but simply explained and led her downstairs. noveldrama
Ye Ning, after hearing this, felt her heart, which was jumping all over the place, finally settle down. 
It was indeed her first time attending such a grand event; it was natural for her to be a bit nervous. 
As they descended the stairs and arrived at the banquet hall mentioned over the phone, they realized that the luxurious and brightly lit grand hall was already filled with people, most of whom had arrived. The men were dressed in sharp and tidy suits, and the women had adorned themselves in various elegant and noble attires, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of a high-society party buzzing with excitement. 
"Miss An, let’s go over there. The manager is there," Xiaojin, who stood by her side, quickly directed her toward the guest check-in upon seeing the convivial scene in the banquet hall. 
Ye Ning nodded and proceeded... 
Afterward, the manager greeted them warmly, "Ah, Mr. Jin and Mrs. Lin have arrived. Please, this way!" 
He was actually speaking Japanese. 
Ye Ning frowned slightly, somewhat unable to understand, but seeing how warm his attitude was, she politely nodded her head in response. 
However, the surrounding guests, upon hearing the manager address her as Mrs. Lin, immediately turned their gazes toward her. 
Mrs. Lin? 
Was she the wife of the sole judge invited from the Chinese side to this event? She had come as well? 
Suddenly, many eyes were fixated on her. 
Ye Ning felt somewhat uncomfortable. Being a person who didn’t like high-profile attention, she definitely couldn’t handle the scrutiny of so many pairs of eyes suddenly focused on her. 
So she pulled Xiaojin over and asked, "Xiaojin, what’s going on here? Why is everyone staring at me?" 
Xiaojin hadn’t expected that the manager would still be calling her Mrs. Lin upon their arrival. A bit panicked and confused, she was just about to explain when a guest came over with a wine glass in hand, "So you are Mrs. Lin. It’s a pleasure to meet you." 
Mrs. Lin? 
This guest wasn’t Japanese; he spoke in fluent English. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning was completely baffled! 
What’s going on? Since when had she become Mrs. Lin? What exactly was happening?
###Chapter 308: Chapter 308: The Chairman of Ou Group Has Arrived...
Her face suddenly turned unsightly as she quickly waved her hands in denial, "No, no, no, you’ve got it wrong, I’m not Mrs. Lin..." 
"Mrs. Lin, it’s okay, this is a jewelry appreciation event, and those messy reporters won’t come here." 
"Right, Mrs. Lin, you don’t have to worry!" 
"Mrs. Lin, you’re really beautiful..." 
"..." 
One by one, the calls had Ye Ning nearly going mad! noveldrama
Just as she was about to assertively clarify the situation, just then, at the entrance of the banquet hall, a figure rushed in. Seeing the manager standing behind them, he hurried over. 
"Manager, the chairman of Ou Group and Diplomat Mr. Li have arrived..." 
"..." 
What? 
The chairman of Ou Group? 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s fingers tightened around her glass, and suddenly, the explanation she was prepared to give got stuck in her throat. 
The manager behind her was also somewhat surprised... 
Ou Group was no ordinary entity. Although they were showcasing a new brand, the substantial financial power of their parent company was not something to be taken lightly. Moreover, this time, the embassy’s diplomats had also come. 
Therefore, he quickly set down his glass and hurried to greet them at the entrance of the banquet hall.
Indeed, within minutes, at the far end of the luxurious red carpet, two figures appeared. The man on the left was middle-aged, wearing a brown suit and a pair of rimmed glasses, his hair meticulously combed, visibly a personage from officialdom. 
And the one on the right, as soon as he appeared, the hall immediately became abuzz. They reacted as if they had seen a superstar drawing everyone’s attention; upon his arrival, all eyes instantly focused on him. 
He truly was a man with an aura of his own, his shiny black leather shoes gleamed, and black trousers enclosed his long and straight legs. His upper attire wasn’t as formal, a comfortable and casual dark blue shirt tucked into the waistband. The belt, custom-made for his personal use, shone with a sharp metallic glare. Tall and calm, he seemed like a sovereign who had suddenly descended, his casual stance dominating the space around him and his stunningly gorgeous features leaving people breathless with admiration. The noise and motion in the hall came to a halt. 
This man was dazzling! 
Clutching the glass in the back of the crowd, Ye Ning saw him appear, and for no reason, her throat tightened with the sudden desire to leave immediately. 
But at that moment, she couldn’t leave at all, so she could only stand in the backdrop, listening to the manager greet him, "I’ve heard that the man in charge of Ou Group is an extraordinary figure. I never expected President Ou to be so young." 
"Oh, it’s all thanks to your support that Ou has come this far," he replied with the fluent officialese, indistinguishable between sincerity and pretense. 
Then the manager exchanged a few more pleasantries with him before his gaze naturally fell upon the diplomat. 
"Mr. Li, I didn’t expect you to come in person, what an honor." 
"Oh, this jewelry appreciation event is also to promote our commercial and trade friendship. Isn’t it normal for me to come?" 
"Exactly, exactly, Mr. Li, shall I introduce you to some of the judges for tomorrow?" 
Speaking thus, the manager led the two men towards where Ye Ning was standing.
###Chapter 309: Chapter 309: He Really Acted Like a Stranger, as if He Didn’t Know Her
Ye Ning stood at a location that was actually designated for important guests at the banquet today, and these important guests, of course, included the five judges who were hired from different places. 
Ye Ning understood, so she tensed up and subconsciously lowered her head to move aside with the crowd. 
Although she couldn’t leave now, with her petite frame, she could hide in this crowd without being noticed by him. 
However, she forgot about her newly acquired "identity"! 
Having just ducked inside, not even ten seconds passed when from within the throng of people surrounding him, suddenly someone asked, "Eh? Where did Mrs. Lin go? Where did Mrs. Lin go?" 
Mrs. Lin? 
Ye Ning, standing amid the crowd, choked, and she stood there, holding her glass of wine as if she had been struck by a freeze spell, unable to move. 
Damn it! 
How could she have forgotten about this? 
The uniform steps moved aside, and in an instant, she saw only a brightening in front of her eyes. Then, as everyone automatically dispersed, she stood there, seeing the few people now standing right in front of her, and at this moment, all their gazes turned toward her. 
"Mr. La, Mr. Ou, this is Mrs. Yebai, the wife of Mr. Lin Yebai I mentioned. He was held up by some matters and hasn’t arrived yet, so his wife will be taking his place at the banquet for now." 
"..." 
For some reason, the lively banquet hall suddenly quieted down. Apart from the manager’s introduction, there was virtually no sound to be heard. 
Mrs. Lin? 
The weather in Japan at this time wasn’t cold, being the middle of summer, where could it be cold? 
But for some reason, standing here, everyone suddenly felt a drop in temperature all around, and Ye Ning’s exposed skin felt goosebumps rising. 
Was the air conditioning broken? 
Everyone began looking around suspiciously. 
Ye Ning also felt that coldness, especially when she saw his eyes lock onto hers after hearing she was Mrs. Lin, that chill on her body grew even stronger. 
Those were eyes deep and dark, devoid of any light, with incredibly attractive eyelids. However, the gaze within was as if entering a whirlpool, revealing no emotion, no anger or joy. He just stood there expressionless, staring at her. 
Ye Ning’s throat felt dry, and her mind was a bit foggy. This sudden situation left her somewhat unprepared. 
Mrs. Lin? 
The devil knows why she ended up with this identity? 
So she gripped her glass a little tighter, ready to explain when the middle-aged man beside him, the diplomat La Shiwen, suddenly came over, "So you are Mrs. Yebai, a pleasure to meet you." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Just as she was about to deny it, she noticed a cold, mocking smile slide across the lips of the man standing behind him. Then, those eyes watching her suddenly retracted, and afterward, just like a stranger, he turned to the manager who had been speaking beside him. noveldrama
"Mr. Ou, is this your first visit? Let me introduce you to a few guests over there." 
"Uh..." 
His voice was faint, as if nothing had happened, and after responding, he put his hands in his pockets, turned, and left the area with the manager. 
Ye Ning watched, stunned for a moment, feeling an inexplicable sense of loss welling up inside her...
###Chapter 310: Chapter 310: Sudden Indifference
Damn it, why does she feel this way? 
Isn’t she eager to have nothing to do with him, to not know him at all? 
Ye Ning started to feel a bit agitated, hurriedly grabbing her wine glass, she couldn’t be bothered to greet these people and decided to head back. 
But at this moment, Lin Yebai returned, and upon seeing her walking toward the door, he paused for a second. As he came in from the door, he stopped her: "Aning, where are you going? Aren’t you going to eat anything?" 
Ye Ning, in her rush, was suddenly confronted with someone blocking her path and had no choice but to stop: "Brother Lin, you’re back?" 
"Yeah, what’s wrong with you? You look a bit off." 
Does she look off? 
Ye Ning touched her face, a hint of evasion in her eyes. 
"Maybe... I didn’t rest well, I was just thinking of going back." 
Didn’t rest well? 
Lin Yebai glanced behind her and saw his assistant standing not far away, signaling to him with his eyes. After a moment’s thought, he came up and took her hand: "Wait for me a moment, I’ll go and greet them, and then I’ll accompany you back." 
Huh? 
He would accompany her back? But what about the guests here? As one of the judges and the main guest that the organizers were entertaining today, wouldn’t the guests be unhappy if he left? 
Ye Ning wanted to refuse, but at this point, he was already leading her back inside. 
She was not familiar with this place, and he certainly didn’t want her to wander around aimlessly. What if something happened? 
Leading her all the way over, because of their affectionate behavior, they attracted a lot of attention along the way. But when those eyes saw who it was, they all passed knowing smiles. 
"Mr. Lin has finally come back." 
"Yeah, as soon as he returns, he’s holding hands with his wife. It seems they are very affectionate." noveldrama
"I think so too..." 
"..." 
Such were the conversations they encountered along the way. 
Ye Ning’s brows knitted slightly; she wanted to take her hand back, but by now, this man had already pulled her into the center of the banquet. 
"Mr. Ou, I heard that your company’s investment in Yuzhirun is a new brand; are you confident about this exhibition?" 
"Confident?" 
In the banquet center, there was a small living room where several global jewelry tycoons, already with the prospect of collaboration after the manager’s introduction, were sitting and chatting in a harmonious atmosphere. 
Confident? 
Ou Mucen, who was casually flipping through a magazine on the long sofa, upon hearing this, his eyes slightly lifted, and he spoke languidly: "To come here, one must sign a guarantee of tens of millions. Mr. Smith, do you think I have so much money that I have nowhere to spend it?" 
The guest was taken aback and was at a loss for words for quite some time.
Suddenly hearing the noise from the banquet hall, he looked up: "Is that Mr. Lin from your Chinese side who has returned?" 
"Seems like it, the one he is holding hands with, that’s the girl from just now." 
"Mrs. Lin?" 
"Right!" 
In just a few words, the attention of these people was turned this way. 
The man sitting on the sofa, when he first heard these words, his fingers paused for a moment. But soon, as though some thought struck him, his expression returned to calm. 
Even colder, one might say! 
Mr. Smith was somewhat puzzled: "Mr. Ou, aren’t you going to greet Mr. Lin? I heard he’s from the same country as you."
###Chapter 311: Chapter 311 He just sat there watching everyone call her Mrs. Lin
The man with no expression didn’t even lift his eyelids, "No need..." 
Mr. Smith: "..." 
—— 
Back at the outside banquet hall, Ye Ning, who was brought back here by Lin Yebai, was instantly surrounded by the people in the hall. 
Because of Lin Yebai, all these guests who came to the exhibition wanted to cozy up to her, so instead of being able to leave early to rest, she was firmly trapped by these people. 
"Mr. Lin, you’re finally here, your wife has been waiting here for you for so long." 
"Yes, Mr. Lin, how could you bear to leave your beautiful wife here alone?" 
"..." 
Seeing the finally arrived Chinese judge coming here, these people really swarmed over, competing to cozy up to them. 
Indeed, Lin Yebai was the most important of the five judges; they wanted their jewelry to win tomorrow—whom else would they cozy up to if not him? 
Ye Ning stood in the crowd, her face looking extremely unsightly; if it weren’t for the hand holding hers, gripping her tightly, she would have exploded on the spot. 
What Mrs. Lin? Did they even understand the situation? 
Lin Yebai also sensed her anger and hurriedly held her hand to explain, "Aning, it must have been the manager who misunderstood when we arrived, don’t worry, I’ll explain to him in a moment." 
Why wait to explain to him later? noveldrama
Can’t it be done now? 
Ye Ning was starting to lose patience, just about to ask him to explain immediately, but at that moment, someone suddenly said from behind in the banquet hall, "The president of the organizing committee is here!" 
With those words, the crowd finally quieted down, and then, Ye Ning saw these people who had crowded around them disperse. 
At last, she could breathe a sigh of relief! 
Ye Ning, seeing this scene, finally covered her chest and took a deep breath. She was just about to see who this president was when her gaze slightly lifted and she suddenly saw a familiar figure, sitting on the white sofa in the small lounge not far from her, his back to her, also looking towards the direction of the arriving guests. 
Good heavens! 
Why was he sitting there? 
Seeing him, her heart inexplicably skipped a beat, a nameless panic bubbling up from the bottom of her heart. 
It was an impeccably neat and clean back of the head; he was fastidious about cleanliness, and quite severely so. That’s why his hairstyle was always short and neat. 
But even so, it didn’t detract from his charisma in the least. On the contrary, the unadorned short hair made his whole demeanor seem refreshingly comfortable, and his collar was very neat, just like him, compulsively without a single wrinkle. 
Ye Ning suddenly clenched her fingers, regretting coming back with Lin Yebai. 
—— 
As soon as the president of the organizing committee appeared, the grand hall, which had been waiting for a long time, finally commenced... 
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that you could travel great distances to attend our jewelry appreciation event. As the organizer of this exhibition, I am honored to have such an opportunity. Now, please allow me to introduce myself." 
The international jewelry exhibition was no ordinary event; it gathered the top jewelry companies from around the world, and the selected pieces were the only internationally recognized brands.
###Chapter 312: Chapter 312: The Suddenly Appearing Blood Jade Necklace
Therefore, the lucky president who inherited the Japanese corporation was also highly valued. 
After a long and lavish speech that nearly extolled his own company to the heavens, he finally began introducing the important guests of the exhibition, and as one of the five judges for this banquet, their presence was, of course, inevitable. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you all know, there are five famous categories in the global jewelry industry, namely gemstones, precious metals, jade, semi-precious stones, and synthetic gems. So, for the sake of fairness, we have invited top experts from each category to serve as judges. Now, let me introduce them to you." 
Having said that, he began to introduce the judges one by one. 
Lin Yebai was naturally in charge of jade, which was no surprise at all. 
However, Ye Ning had not expected that when the president called him up, as he mentioned jade, the category with the longest history among the five types of jewelry, he would have someone bring over a brocade box. 
"Mr. Lin, I have long heard that you are a renowned expert in this field. I have a piece of jewelry here that has long puzzled everyone as to its nature. Could I possibly trouble Mr. Lin to take a look?" 
"..." 
They were actually pulling this kind of stunt? 
The crowd standing below watched this scene unfold and began to murmur among themselves, their eyes fixated on the brocade box. noveldrama
Ye Ning was also surprised, but upon seeing the brocade box, she became very curious. 
She was aware of Lin Yebai’s abilities. Although they were not as sharp as her own eyes, for an ordinary person, his level of skill was indeed quite impressive. 
But then, the warm and gentle man under the magnesium lights just smiled faintly upon hearing the request. He took the brocade box from the president’s hands, slowly opened it, and... 
What was that? 
In an instant, the entire banquet hall fell so silent that one could hear a pin drop! 
Ou Mucen was also looking in that direction, having little interest in such items himself. What made him curious was what the president was trying to sell with this charade. 
The brocade box was opened quickly, and then everyone saw a necklace made of K-gold being taken out; the necklace itself was nothing special. What was special was the pendant hanging from it. 
A pendant shaped like a maple leaf! 
"What is that? Agate?" 
"It looks a bit like it, red in color, but agate doesn’t seem to have such a luster." 
"Then what is it?" 
"..." 
As soon as the necklace was presented, discussions sprang up all around. However, much to Ou Mucen’s disappointment, it seemed they were not too familiar with it, as puzzled looks appeared on everyone’s faces. 
Except for that woman, the one standing at the very front. Upon seeing the pendant, she suddenly took a step back, and then, covering her eyes, she bowed her head. 
What was she doing? 
The man with an expressionless face narrowed his eyes slightly. 
And at that moment, the man on the stage with glasses also began to speak while holding the necklace: "This should be Blood Jade, shouldn’t it? And it seems to be quite old!" 
My goodness! 
Blood Jade? 
Once these words were spoken, the entire banquet hall boiled with excitement! 
Blood Jade, that was one of the rarest stones in the jade category, a very rare variety. Generally, only the finest white jade made into jewelry, worn for many years, buried as part of a tomb, then excavated, introduced into the market, and worn again, could develop into this kind of jade. 
PS: What do you think is the purpose behind the sudden appearance of this
###Chapter 313: Chapter 313: A Gift for Your Wife as a Meeting Present
It can be said that, among ten thousand pieces of jadeite jewelry, you might not necessarily find a single piece of Blood Jade. 
Therefore, at this moment, when the man wearing glasses made this statement, it is no wonder that the hall erupted into a buzz of excitement. 
Ou Mucen was also somewhat surprised. He did not understand jade, but he had heard of Blood Jade, cultivation over a thousand years, nurtured by blood. Unexpectedly, the club president had such a fine piece in his possession. 
Why was he taking it out now? 
Could it be that no one had identified it for him? 
Ou Mucen’s hands were in his pockets, his eyes sharp as an eagle’s, coldly staring at the two men on stage... 
Upon hearing it was Blood Jade, the club president was also stunned, looking at the necklace for a good while before finally taking it back into his own hands: "I really didn’t expect this, this little Jade Pendant actually turned out to be Blood Jade." 
Lin Yebai nodded: "Yes, it is indeed a fine item. Club President, you should take good care of it." 
"Take good care of it?" 
The club president held the necklace for a long time before smiling at him: "As for this Jade Pendant, it’s also a matter of fate. It was given to me as collateral by someone who borrowed a bit of money from me. I didn’t think much of it because I never intended to ask for it back. Unexpectedly, this item turned out to be such a treasure." 
"..." 
As these words fell, the banquet hall was again abuzz with discussion! 
To receive such a fine item for just lending some money, it seemed that the club president was indeed a kind-hearted person. 
As a result, many eyes in the room looked enviously at the blood-red Jade Pendant, Lin Yebai included. 
But just then, another unexpected event occurred. The club president, after examining the Jade Pendant in his hands for a moment, suddenly handed it over to Lin Yebai: "Mr. Lin, since you were the one to recognize this pendant, it shows that it also has a fate with you. How about this, I will gift it to you today, how does that sound?" 
What? 
This fine item, he was actually willing to give it away just like that to this Chinese judge? 
As everyone witnessed this scene, they were all stunned, and even Ou Mucen, who was silently observing, revealed a trace of surprise in his eyes... 
If this pendant truly was Blood Jade, it would be worth at least several million. Yet now the club president casually mentioned giving it away to that man, which was quite unexpected. 
"Club President, this... how could this be?" Lin Yebai was also taken aback, looking at the pendant coming his way, he dared not accept it for a moment. 
But the club president looked at him and then actively placed it in his palm: "I’ve heard that fine jade actually needs to find its owner. You see, it has been with me for so many years and since I did not recognize it, I’ve never worn it. It’s like a pearl covered in dust, isn’t that a waste?" 
"But still..." 
"Alright Mr. Lin, don’t be polite now. This jade, since it was given to me by someone else, me giving it to you is also fate. Moreover, as a connoisseur of jade, you will not let it gather dust again. So, I heard that your wife also came today, consider it a meeting gift from me to your wife." noveldrama
"..." 
With this final statement, the entire hall truly exploded into chaos! 
The club president was being too generous, wasn’t he? 
A Blood Jade, so valuable, handed over just like that—what exactly was the relationship between him and this Chinese judge? Why was he so extravagant upon his arrival? Could it be that they knew each other beforehand?
###Chapter 314: Chapter 314 He Finally Became As Terrifying As a Ghost
Ou Mucen’s brow finally furrowed, and at the same time, his expression began to sour. 
If he truly knew the man, then, considering the grudge between him and that man, he guessed tomorrow’s exhibit wouldn’t go smoothly. 
However, what surprised him was that La Shiwen, who stood beside him, denied it, "As far as I know, the organizer doesn’t know this Lin Yebai. It seemed they got to him through many connections." 
They don’t know each other? 
Ou Mucen’s gaze deepened as he stared ahead! 
They don’t know each other but are so generous? noveldrama
It was weird, on the stage ahead, Lin Yebai, who had been persistently pushed, finally accepted the president’s gift. After that, everyone saw him holding the Jade Pendant as he came down from the stage, making his way to the front of the crowd where a young girl with short hair stood. 
She was a refreshingly clean-cut girl, her chestnut short hair slightly fluffy in the most fashionable pear flower curl, revealing a full forehead. Her features were delicate, and although not as exquisite as the other women in the hall, her lightly made-up face made her stand out in this setting, appearing even more eye-catching. 
Lin Yebai walked over, and before so many people, he approached her like the most elegant gentleman, "Aning..." 
"Huh?" 
Ye Ning was a bit stunned; things were happening too fast, and she still couldn’t quite recover. 
Not until she suddenly saw him take her hand, pulling her out from the crowd, then before everyone, holding the necklace, he leaned in towards her, did she suddenly stiffen, her hands instinctively resting against his chest, "Brother Lin, what are you doing?" 
"Aning, just... do me a favor, okay?" he whispered gently near her ear, his voice not loud, but the tone was filled with a plea. 
Ye Ning’s fingers instantly stiffened! 
Was he asking her? 
She opened her mouth slightly, and in an instant, she felt as if something exploded in her mind, leaving it extremely chaotic. 
It was at that moment, the shadow of the man looming over her suddenly enlarged, and the next second, she smelled a strong, masculine scent before her, and those hands enveloped her petite shoulders and neck into his embrace. 
"Aning, this Jade Pendant really suits you!" 
Another hot breath from a man fell near her ear, Ye Ning looked down and realized, a cool sensation on her neck, a very beautiful and unique Jade Pendant now hung over her chest.
Indeed, it was a very beautiful Jade Pendant, especially against the girl’s fair skin, it looked even better. 
Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the two, their faces revealing astonishment, envy, and even jealousy at the "couple’s" affection for each other. At this moment, all these emotions were evident on their faces. 
La Shiwen was also watching with great interest; he hadn’t expected such a scene at the banquet. 
As he was engrossed, he suddenly heard a crisp sound of something breaking near his ear. When he turned his head, he realized that the man who had been quietly standing beside him had somehow managed to break the stem of the wine glass he was holding right in the palm of his hand. 
"Mucen..." 
Ps: Recommending a dearest friend Lin Yebai’s favorite text: "The Emperor’s Deep Love: Wife Spoiling Tactics!"
###Chapter 315: Chapter 315: His biggest characteristic is that if you provoke him, he’ll kill you all!
"Mucen, you..." 
"Hold this for me!" 
The man, whose eyes had finally turned thoroughly ghostlike in terror, shoved the broken goblet with a few traces of crimson on it onto the other man’s body and stepped forward. 
"Mr. President, don’t you think this is rather inconsiderate of our respective positions?" 
"What?" 
The man’s distinctively clear and deep voice spread through the air, and the entire banquet fell silent all at once. 
Including the couple who had been putting on a necklace in a highly intimate manner, when they heard this, they turned their heads and immediately, all their actions froze. 
Oh my God! 
How could she forget that he was also there? 
Without thinking, she pushed the man who was still very close to her. 
The club president also came down, and seeing the president of the Ou Group, recommended by the emissary La Shiwen, coming out of the crowd, his complexion changed slightly, "Why would Mr. Ou say that?" 
The more bloodthirsty Ou Mucen was, the more elegantly he smiled, "Because of fairness, Mr. President. You invited five judges this time, and yet you show such favoritism towards the judge responsible for the jadeite, giving such a lavish gift right from the start— it really arouses suspicion." 
"Mr. Ou, how can you say that?" 
The president, provoked by his words, finally became anxious, "I gave Mr. Lin a gift because I saw it suited him well, what’s there to suspect about that?" 
Suited him well? 
If he hadn’t mentioned it, it would have been better, but as soon as he did, even the corners of the man’s eyes conveyed irony, and his smile grew deeper! 
"Mr. President, you’ve misunderstood me. I’m not blaming you for giving Mr. Lin the gift. I only think that it’s inappropriate to do so at this time. It might lead us exhibitors to misunderstand. If you felt such an affinity, you could have waited until the end of the exhibition to give it, unless..." 
"Unless what?" 
"Unless, Mr. President, there is another purpose behind giving this necklace!" 
Casually spoken, the expression, just like discussing the most ordinary matter, was so calm there wasn’t a ripple to be seen. 
The president’s complexion finally turned pale. Looking around and seeing the guests’ attitudes changing, casting dissatisfied and questioning glances at him, he suddenly turned his gaze to the couple not far away. 
Ou Mucen, watching in his eyes, didn’t expose them but just saw a flash of furious embarrassment on the man’s face, and the mockery and derision in his smiling eyes intensified. 
Trying to play this game in front of him was still too green! 
"Mr. Ou, I don’t know what you’re talking about. It’s just a necklace I gave, how could there be any ulterior motives?" noveldrama
"Really? Then since that’s the case, Mr. President, why are you clueless about the Jade Pendant, while Mr. Lin can expertly handle even its ancient style clasp on touch?" 
"..." 
Ancient style clasp? 
As soon as this was said, the banquet hall erupted once again, and everyone turned to look at the girl’s neck, only to realize that the fine chain indeed had an ancient style clasp, something long vanished from the markets. 
Oh my God! 
How could this be? 
Ye Ning was also shocked by this remark. Reaching out, she touched the back of her neck and saw that the fastening there was indeed an intricate one that she had only seen once or twice before, and her fingers suddenly stiffened there.
###Chapter 316: Chapter 316 Her Struggle
She widened her eyes at the man standing beside her, her expression, truly as shocked as could be. 
Feeling unable to withstand such a gaze from her, Lin Yebai became annoyed and, in a burst of anger, he turned his head to fiercely glare at the man who had exposed him, "Ou Mucen, what exactly do you want to do?" 
What to do? 
Seeing his reaction, Ou Mucen coldly laughed, "I don’t want to do anything. I only want everyone to rest assured. Our club president, in fact, isn’t that close to Mr. Lin. That Jade Pendant wasn’t a generous gift from him to Mr. Lin, but rather a play-act put on in conspiracy with Mr. Lin to win over a woman’s heart. President, am I right in saying so?" 
"I——" 
As the last word came out, the banquet hall exploded into chaos, and the club president’s face turned an extreme shade of red. 
Acting? 
Was he saying that the Jade Pendant was just part of an act the president was in on? So, that means the Jade Pendant was actually the property of this judge? 
In an instant, the banquet hall erupted with jeers and roars like a pot boiling over! 
Lin Yebai’s entire body trembled! 
Indeed, the Jade Pendant was his, and he had orchestrated everything that evening. 
His purpose was to strike back at this man, who had been persistently hovering around Ye Ning, by using such a method to tell him that he was the one most qualified to possess that woman. 
And their relationship was already far from ordinary!
But unexpectedly, with just one link of a chain, he saw through it all. This man was truly detestable! 
The usually gentle and composed Lin Yebai had a sharp murderous intent flaring in his eyes, and his fingers, holding the brocade box, were so tense that veins bulged, "Yes, the Jade Pendant is mine. So what?" 
"..." 
A wave of uproar burst forth! 
My God! Did Mr. Lin actually admit it? 
Ye Ning looked at him, trembling slightly upon hearing his words, "Brother Lin, why? Why would you do such a thing?" 
Why? 
Lin Yebai’s complexion paled for a moment, finally remembering her presence, then a flash of panic crossed his face before he urgently grabbed her, "Aning, listen to my explanation, things aren’t as you think." 
"Indeed, they are not as such. Mr. Lin, I think you need to clarify to everyone present here exactly who Miss An is to you and what your relationship with her is," Ou Mucen said emotionlessly, not missing the chance to further press the issue. noveldrama
"..." 
Before Ye Ning could even respond to the question, the man opposite, who had already succeeded but didn’t want to let go, emotionlessly threw out another sentence. 
As the words fell, the hall once again plunged into a storm of public opinion. 
Indeed, even a fool could hear the implication of his words: the relationship between him and Lin Yebai was not that of husband and wife; she was not Mrs. Lin. 
As expected, those who crossed Ou Mucen were not faced with the worst, only with something more severe. 
Ye Ning looked blankly at the man in front of her, his face pale with anger, his body quivering, who now had no means of retaliation, and suddenly, her heart began to feel pity. 
Yes, when she had just learned that everything was of his own contrivance, she was extremely angry and her heart was also very upset and disgusted. 
It was as if she couldn’t wait to leave him, leave this place, and return to her own home. 
But now, seeing him like this, seeing him so disgracefully suppressed by that man in front of everyone, devastated, she suddenly couldn’t bear it!
###Chapter 317: Chapter 317 If I help you again, I’ll be hit by a car!
He was Lin Yebai, the one who had saved her life and taken care of her for a whole five years. How could she stand by and watch his reputation being dragged through the mud, him utterly disgraced? 
Ye Ning bit her lip tightly, her fingers also deeply curled into her own palm!
"Mr. Ou, you’ve misunderstood, I’ve known about this for a while. My master did this to give me a surprise, and I really like this surprise," she said. 
"What did you say? Say that again!" 
In an instant, the man who had just been strategic and nonchalant across from her froze, as if someone had hit his pressure point, all expression congealed in place. 
She knew already? 
And she liked the surprise? Did she even know what she was saying? 
Ye Ning did not dare to look at him, because she knew just how terrifying hell could be, and that’s how terrifying he looked right now. 
She gripped her palm so tightly that her sharp fingernails were almost piercing her flesh, and yet she was completely unaware: "No matter how many times I say it, it’s the same. Mr. Ou, I really appreciate your concern for us, but from now on, please don’t trouble yourself with these matters." 
"..." 
It was as though every molecule in the air had solidified—absolute silence reigned in the hall, so quiet that one could hear a pin drop, and the oppressive darkness in the air made it difficult even to breathe. 
This was indeed an aura more terrifying than death itself! 
Ye Ning bowed her head, feeling as if something were stuck in her chest, causing discomfort. Her slightly bent fingers subconsciously twisted the hem of her dress. 
It was at this moment that the man standing opposite her finally spoke, "Fine, from now on, An Ning, you remember, if I, Ou Mucen, help you again, I’ll walk out and get hit by a car!" noveldrama
Ye Ning: "..." 
She quickly looked up, her blood-drained little face eager to see the man she had been afraid to look at until now. 
But in the span of a single sentence, he had already turned around. When she looked up, all she saw was his indifferent gaze, like that of a complete stranger, and nothing but his decisively retreating figure. 
Ou Mucen! 
Ye Ning’s lips trembled fiercely, and in that instant, boundless panic flooded her heart like a swelling tide, so sudden and swift that she couldn’t adjust to it before her legs uncontrollably started moving. 
"Aning, where are you going?" 
Just as she was about to chase after him, someone behind her grabbed her. He held on so tightly and with such fear that she could feel his hands trembling. 
Ye Ning turned around and saw him, her bloodless lips quivered, and in the end, she stopped. 
"Nowhere in particular, I just feel... a bit stifled here and want to go back." 
"Want to go back? Okay, I’ll take you back right away!" he said, relieved to hear she wasn’t going after the other man, and without further ado, he led her out of the banquet hall. 
Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the banquet hall had completely calmed down after the girl’s revelation... 
"So, you’re saying that girl is not Mr. Lin’s wife, but his disciple?" 
"Eh, it’s pretty much the same. To arrange such a big surprise for his disciple, isn’t that like confessing to her?"
###Chapter 318: Chapter 318 When did she have someone else in her heart?
"That’s true, it seems that Mr. Lin really is a romantic person." 
"Yeah, but what’s with the president of the Ou Group? The way he looked just now was quite off." 
"..." 
The president of the Ou Group? 
Who knows? 
—— 
Yeah, who knows? 
Secretary Gao didn’t know what had happened either. After watching the president return to his room as soon as he came back and never coming out again, he was quite puzzled. 
What’s wrong with the president? 
Why does he look so awful? 
Turning his head, he saw Miss Lai who had brought him back. He asked, "Miss Lai, did something happen at the banquet where the third young master and your father went?" 
La Chenxi smiled, "Nothing happened, it’s probably because he discussed some business matters. You know, he has a bad temper. It’s normal for him to feel uncomfortable if he encounters things he doesn’t like." 
This woman seemed to be in a good mood, giving a light and casual explanation when asked. 
Hearing this, Secretary Gao felt relieved. 
Indeed, his president does have a bad temper, so if he encountered something displeasing at the banquet, it would be normal. 
Therefore, he didn’t bother him anymore and went off to prepare the materials for the exhibition the next day. 
Meanwhile, the woman, after seeing him leave, looked at the tightly closed door with a bright smile, then went downstairs to prepare food for him. 
So the little assistant had such a relationship with the man named Lin she saw during the day. Since that was the case, what was there for her to worry about? noveldrama
She opened the refrigerator and took out his favorite dried scallops... 
- 
Ye Ning also returned to the presidential suite. 
After returning, the first thing she did was to take off the Jade Pendant from her neck and return it to the man following behind her, "Brother Lin, I’m giving this back to you." 
Lin Yebai’s complexion stiffened for a moment, neither accepting it nor refusing it. 
She’s a smart girl. He didn’t believe that after what had just happened, she would fail to understand his intention. 
Lin Yebai’s lips were somewhat pale, "You don’t like it?" 
Ye Ning shook her head, "No, it’s just that I feel such an expensive thing is not suitable for me." 
Suitable? 
What does ’not suitable’ mean? 
Is it the Jade Pendant that’s not suitable, or is he the one who’s not suitable? 
Lin Yebai’s gaze darkened, thinking back on the scene that had unfolded in the banquet hall, and the fact that she had almost chased after him, he finally took a step forward, "What exactly is unsuitable? Or is it that you’re unwilling?"
"What?" 
"I mean, what are you trying to say with your words? Ye Ning, after all these years, I don’t believe you do not know my feelings. It’s just a Jade Pendant, do you need to reject it?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
His words were quite direct. Although he had not said the most crucial words, Ye Ning felt a bit panicked upon hearing them. 
"Brother Lin, that’s not what I meant. I just feel it’s not suitable for me to accept it." 
"Why is it not suitable?" 
"Because... because...," 
Ye Ning’s throat was a bit dry, and her mind was also in disarray; she didn’t know how to answer this question. 
Because she had always regarded him as part of her family, as a brother, because she had never considered having different feelings for him. 
Ye Ning, with her head bowed, struggled for a long, long time, finally squeezing out the words, "I am an unmarried mother with a child, and because I have also been to jail, I am shunned by society, I’m like a mouse, having to live in the shadows. Brother Lin, I don’t deserve you!"
###Chapter 319: Chapter 319: You Can’t Push Her Too Hard
Unworthy? 
The man who had been waiting for her response, upon hearing these words, finally felt his heart sink completely. 
"Ye Ning, all these years, have I ever disdained you?" 
"What?" 
"You say you’re a single mother, you’ve been to jail, you live in the shadows, all of these, which part did I not personally take care of for you? If I really disdained you, do you think you could have stayed by my side for so many years?" noveldrama
"..." 
The words became blunter! 
The meaning was also getting clearer; without disdain, there is no unworthiness, and everything she said now was just her excuse. 
Ye Ning finally looked down, her face, which had been forcibly composed, began to stiffen, "Brother Lin, isn’t it better for us... just like this?" 
"How so?" 
"Like siblings, like family, isn’t that good?" Ye Ning raised her head, her eyes full of hope while she stared at the man. 
Indeed, was it good to be like siblings, like family? How much she cherished such a relationship! She was an orphan, without the warmth of a family since childhood. Didn’t he know how important and precious his care and protection were to her? 
But the man was very determined, even with a hint of mockery after hearing her words, "Being family with me, and being a spouse to Ou Mucen, is that it?" 
"What did you say?" 
Ye Ning’s face finally changed, "Brother Lin, why would you say that?"
Lin Yebai: "..." 
He was about to ruthlessly pierce through the true secret hidden in the depths of her heart, but at this moment, Xiaojin pushed the door and came in from outside, "Sir, so you were here, I’ve got something to look for you about." 
Only then did Lin Yebai stop the words still trapped in his throat. 
Now that Xiaojin had arrived, Ye Ning wanted even less to stay in the living room, so as soon as Lin Yebai moved away from in front of her, she turned and went to her room, slamming the door shut with a "bang". 
This was the first time she had been so angry at him! 
Xiaojin stood there seeing this, and finally couldn’t hold back, he approached the equally ashen-faced sir, "Sir, you’re pressing her too hard, this way, you’ll only drive her further away." 
Xiaojin hadn’t actually come to look for him about something; he had hurried over to stop him after hearing something amiss from outside. 
Yes, if Xiaojin hadn’t appeared just now, Lin Yebai might have exposed the man truly hidden in the depths of her heart, and perhaps, there would have been no turning back for them. 
"Sir, Miss Aning came for revenge. Ou Mucen belongs to the Ou Family. No matter how much she likes him, she won’t let herself step into that situation." 
"So your point is..." 
"My point is, don’t push too hard, lest she actually ends up with that man. You must understand, they already have a child together." 
Xiaojin also knew about the incident from back then. 
Because at that time, it was he who had witnessed it and informed Lin Yebai. 
Lin Yebai finally calmed down slowly! 
Indeed, he had been too impulsive just now, especially after hearing her mention family, the word "spouse" that he had blurted out in anger was precisely because he thought of that child. 
He lit a cigarette and slowly paced to the floor-to-ceiling windows of this luxurious living room, "How’s that matter I asked you to take care of coming along?" 
Xiaojin quickly answered, "It’s all set up. But, sir, how did you know that jewelry company belonged to Ou Yuze?"
###Chapter 320: Chapter 320: He Wants the Entire Ou Family!
The man who was blowing smoke rings towards the enchanting night view outside the window, had reverted to his usual gentle and refined demeanor. 
Ou Yuze? 
"He is an ambitious man. After being suppressed by his younger uncle for so many years, do you think he would be content?" 
"So, sir, did you go out of your way to have his private company participate in this jewelry exhibition to deal with Ou Mucen?" 
"No!" 
The man smoking elegantly shook his finger, "No, he doesn’t yet qualify to deal with Ou Mucen." 
"Then what does sir mean?" 
"He is just a chess piece in my hand, what I want is the entire Ou Family!" 
As his words fell, the cigarette butt that he had just finished was also fiercely extinguished in the ashtray. 
Indeed, since those beasts treated that girl so cruelly back in the day, and tonight, that man almost saw his reputation ruined and completely destroyed, he would personally take action from now on to bring about their total destruction. 
Xiaojin was watching on the side, terrified! 
The entire Ou Family? 
He flipped through the information of the jewelry company in his hand, then thinking back to the pair of Jade Bracelets, finally, a chilling sensation emerged from his back... 
-- 
Ye Ning tossed and turned in bed for a long time without falling asleep, her mind alternating between the words Lin Yebai had said to her and the image of that cold, resolute departing figure. 
He said that if he helped her again, he would get hit by a car and die! 
How much hate did it take to say such cruel words? 
Ye Ning turned over like a pancake on the bed for more than two hours until she couldn’t stand it anymore. She got up, turned on the computer in her bedroom, and only felt at ease after booking a ticket home. 
After she had arrived in Japan, fearing that it might be inconvenient to go out sometimes, Lin Yebai had given her passport and ID card to her. 
With the ticket booked, she finally fell asleep, and because she had been tossing and turning for so long at night, by the time she woke up in the morning, it was already almost nine o’clock. 
"Miss An, Mr. Lin and his assistant have already gone to the exhibition. He asked me to tell you that if you want to go, I can take you there." 
Upon waking up, she saw a hotel server in the suite. 
Go to the exhibition? 
No, she lost all interest. Right now, she needed to get to the airport, as her boarding time was fast approaching. 
So she declined, returned to her room, quickly washed up, got dressed, packed her luggage, and left. 
"Hello, I’m Miss An from Presidential Suite No. 1. When Mr. Lin returns, could you tell him that I’ve already gone back?" 
Before leaving the hotel, she gave it some thought; not wanting to worry him, she still left a verbal message for him at the front desk. 
After what had happened the night before, she didn’t even want to contact him by phone anymore. Right now, she just wanted to be alone. 
After leaving the message, she took a taxi to the airport. At the same time, the exhibition event was about to start. 
"Third Young Master, you’re here..." 
Ou Mucen hadn’t arrived very early, as he had slept poorly the night before. noveldrama
Therefore, he had Secretary Gao go ahead in the morning, while he rested a bit longer before coming over. 
Upon arrival, seeing the secretary standing at the entrance of the exhibition, he frowned, "Is everything ready?" 
"It’s ready, the exhibits have been set up, and most of the other exhibitors have also arrived," replied Secretary Gao, taking the president’s coat and leading him into the expansive exhibition center. 
One had to admit, this exhibition’s scale was indeed very large.
###Chapter 321: Chapter 321: Young Master, Something Has Happened!
Apart from the highly elegant and luxurious venue, even the display racks used by the exhibitors to showcase their products were equipped with the world’s top anti-theft devices. 
Ou Mucen walked over and, seeing this scene, finally understood why his old man had insisted on him being here.
As he entered, the exhibitors who had already arrived greeted him. He simply nodded slightly in response before heading over to the Yuzhirun booth. noveldrama
It was a decent spot. It seemed that La Shiwen was doing quite well here. 
"Third Young Master, this is our Jade Bracelet. It was launched by the organizer earlier this morning." 
To avoid the various theft issues encountered in the past, the organizers had required the exhibitors to submit their exhibits yesterday. The items were then placed in high-precision anti-theft display cabinets, secured with the exhibitor’s fingerprint as the password. 
After hearing about it, Ou Mucen casually glanced inside the cabinet. 
It truly was the Jade Bracelet he had brought over, made of superb quality jade, a brilliant green—and what was more important... 
Suddenly, his expression stiffened! 
Secretary Gao, standing by, was puzzled, "Third Young Master, what’s wrong?" 
"Take this bracelet out for me to see!" Almost impatiently, he stretched his finger to the fingerprint lock. 
Secretary Gao didn’t know what had happened, but seeing the change in his expression, didn’t dare delay. So, once the lock was opened with his fingerprint, he immediately took out the Jade Bracelet. 
"Third Young Master, what’s the matter?" 
"..." 
No one answered him, only watching as the man in front of the bracelet took it into his hands and brought it close to his eyes, scrutinizing it under the light. 
What was he looking for? He didn’t understand this stuff, did he? 
Secretary Gao was somewhat baffled. However, when he turned around and saw people from the judging panel across the room looking over, he began to feel nervous, "Third Young Master, there are rules for the exhibition. Once the items are placed in the display cabinets, they can’t be taken out, Third Young Master..." 
"This is fake!" 
"What did you say?" 
Secretary Gao was so startled he was rendered speechless, "Fake? Why? What we gave them yesterday was real!" 
Exactly, the Jade Bracelet they handed over to the organizers yesterday was undoubtedly real. How could it have become fake? 
Secretary Gao couldn’t understand it at all! 
Similarly, Ou Mucen hadn’t expected such an incident either. Holding the bracelet in his hand, a heavy frost of anger swept through his eyes. 
Dare to swap his item? 
It looked like he had underestimated the exhibition! 
He put the Jade Bracelet back in the box, turned around, and coldly swept his gaze around the room. Finally, it landed on the club president who was mingling with the exhibitors, "Go get him for me. Tell him I want to see him." 
"Yes, Third Young Master!" 
Upon hearing this, Secretary Gao immediately went to fetch the club president of the organizers. 
At this moment, the group of judges also entered, surrounded by a throng of media reporters at the entrance. 
Noticing signs that the showcase at the Ou family’s booth had been opened, Xiaojin, who was following Lin Yebai, suddenly turned pale, "Sir, it looks like he’s discovered something?" 
Lin Yebai also noticed the commotion upon entering and saw the man had already found something amiss with his item before the exhibition had even started, darkening his expression instantly.
###Chapter 322: Chapter 322: Who Will Take the Deer
Why was this man always outside of his control? 
His eyes flashed with a cold and murderous intent, "How did things go yesterday?" 
Xiaojin replied hastily, "Very cleanly! Sir, you can rest assured!" 
"Then there’s no need to bother with him. Without evidence, his complaints to Takazawa Hideyoshi will only make the organizers think he’s causing trouble for no reason and cancel his participation." 
"So, what are you implying, sir...?" 
"Wait and see!" As he said this, he suddenly remembered something and added, "Also, tell the other four judges to ensure the exhibition opens on time." 
"Yes, sir!" 
Xiaojin quickly went to do as instructed. 
This indeed was the man’s impending doom. So what if he discovered the truth of the matter? Without evidence to prove his items were swapped, his status as a newly started brand would only cause others to think he didn’t have any exhibit-worthy items and was using a lame excuse. 
Thus, they didn’t need to worry about this problem at all. As long as they ensured the exhibition was ready to open, he would naturally fall flat on his face. 
The man who finally took his seat at the judges’ panel thought of all this, and his handsome and elegant face once again showed his genial and gentle smile... 
Ou Mucen, this time I want to see who will be the victor? 
—— 
Secretary Takazawa returned quickly, just as Lin Yebai anticipated. The organizer, Takazawa Hideyoshi, didn’t acknowledge that Yuzhirun’s exhibit was swapped. Instead, he questioned whether the pieces they provided were authentic in the first place. 
Secretary Takazawa was furious after hearing this, and if it weren’t for the president waiting for him at the venue, he would have started arguing on the spot. 
After coming back from Takazawa Hideyoshi, he saw the president still standing there, lost in thought while looking at the Jade Bracelet, so he approached him with a pale face. 
"Third Young Master, they won’t admit it and even said that if we really insist, we can check their surveillance footage. But if we don’t find any evidence, they will cancel our participation and confiscate the deposit in full." 
"..." 
This was a fact. As an exhibitor, if you challenge the organizer and fail to find evidence in the surveillance footage, you will be deemed as making groundless accusations and have your participation cancelled. 
Moreover, Yuzhirun is a newly established brand; their qualification to attend has already stirred much controversy. 
Ou Mucen’s eyes were filled with icy rage as he looked at the fake Jade Bracelet in front of him and the exhibition about to start behind him. Finally, he took out his phone. 
"Mr. Takazawa, I heard you won’t let me see the surveillance footage?" 
"Ou... Mr. Ou, what are you saying? This..." 
"I might not need to see the surveillance footage, but remember this, Mr. Takazawa, if I find evidence that my items were indeed swapped, your Takazawa Corporation will cease to exist in Japan!" noveldrama
"You—" 
On the other end of the phone, Takazawa Hideyoshi, hearing this threat, finally turned green with anger. 
His corporation not appearing in Japan anymore? 
Did he mean to destroy his company?
What bluster! 
Takazawa Hideyoshi’s hands trembled with rage, but as he sought to retaliate against the person on the phone, he realized he didn’t have the courage to do so. 
Indeed, Yuzhirun wasn’t to be feared, but the Ou Corporation was certainly not something to provoke.
###Chapter 323: Chapter 323: Has He Met with an Accident?
That’s a company that could rank globally. If he really got angry, it’s not only his Takazawa Corporation that would disappear from Japan, he wouldn’t let the rest of the world off the hook either. 
Takazawa Hideyoshi’s face gradually turned pale, and through clenched teeth, he asked angrily, "Then what exactly do you want?" 
"Postpone!" 
Postpone? 
What a joke! The opening was about to happen, and he’s talking about postponing it?!! 
Takazawa Hideyoshi was incensed once more, "Ou Mucen, this is a global exhibition, not child’s play. How can you simply say postpone and expect a postponement?" 
"That’s your problem. You should be grateful that I still want to participate in this exhibition. Otherwise, Takazawa Hideyoshi, I could right now make a mess for you and this exhibition!" With that, he didn’t wait for an answer, he just slammed the phone down. 
Indeed, it was only because Ou Mucen was still interested in this event that it wasn’t already a disaster. Otherwise, there would be no need for a delay – he would’ve just thrown it into chaos! 
Did they think they could mess with him and live to tell the tale? 
After hanging up, he didn’t even bother to lock the display case, just turned on his heel and strode out. 
Secretary Gao watched from behind, unsure what the president intended, but seeing him leave, he quickly followed suit. 
Thereafter, everyone in the venue, seeing the two of them leave without locking the display case, was filled with astonishment... 
What’s the head of Ou Corporation up to now? Why is he leaving when it’s all about to start? 
And, what about his display case? 
Leaving it open and unlocked? Isn’t he afraid someone will steal what’s inside? 
Everyone was puzzled! 
Lin Yebai also watched, somewhat perplexed, but down in his heart, a bad premonition was growing, especially after seeing the neglected display case. noveldrama
What on earth was he thinking? 
—— 
When Ye Ning arrived at the airport, it was almost eleven o’clock. Seeing that there was still a good half hour before her flight, she found a seat in the departure hall and began to wait while idly playing with her broken phone. 
As she turned on the screen, she didn’t go anywhere else, just straight to Weibo, hoping to catch up on domestic news. But at that moment, a message suddenly popped up on her Weibo homepage. 
"International media is in an uproar as today’s highly-anticipated global jewelry exhibition is suddenly postponed by the organizers for four hours!" 
What? 
The jewelry exhibition delayed for four hours? 
Seeing the message in English, she was somewhat surprised, so she clicked through and began to read the article carefully. 
It turned out that there were security concerns with the exhibition, and the organizers needed relevant departments to conduct another inspection before it could proceed. 
Such a significant issue, could the organizers really make such a blunder? 
Ye Ning found it hard to believe. She scrolled down on her phone and quickly caught sight of the photos beneath the news article. 
Indeed, the several photos were of a chaotic scene, whether jewelers or judges, all seemed disordered. It was evident that the issue had come up suddenly. 
She began reading the comments below... 
****** 
On floor 1005#: According to the latest information received, someone revealed that it’s not really a security issue, but rather that a vendor’s jewelry was switched out with a fake. 
On floor 1020#: @floor 1005 Is what you’re saying true? Vendor’s jewelry switched out? 
On floor 2000#: Which vendor?!!
@floor 1005: I don’t know that, but I heard it was a pair of Jade Bracelets... 
...
###Chapter 324: Chapter 324: Does He Want to Kill Ou Mucen?
Ye Ning thought that once the incident broke out, most of the comments below would be cursing the organizer because such a blunder was unforgivable. 
But she hadn’t expected that when she scrolled to over a thousand floor levels, she would see such a message... 
Jewelry swapped? 
A pair of Jade Bracelets? 
As she read these words, her fingers immediately froze in place. 
The Jade Bracelet, wasn’t that the exhibit that Yuzhirun brought to the exhibition? 
She remembered the man she saw at the dress shop yesterday, and in order to find out the reason he came here, after returning to the presidential suite and Lin Yebai left, she took that opportunity to find the list of exhibitors in the living room. 
Yes, that man brought a pair of Jade Bracelets this time. 
So the items that were swapped, could they be his? 
Suddenly feeling a sense of urgency and disregarding the risk of being exposed, she immediately sent a private message to the original poster, "Excuse me, do you know which exhibitor’s merchandise got swapped?" 
"Not quite sure, but a friend of mine at the scene said that there’s only one exhibitor called Yuzhirun that has Jade Bracelets." 
The private message was quickly returned! 
Upon seeing this, Ye Ning’s entire being descended into chaos... 
Yuzhirun! 
It really was Yuzhirun! 
But why Yuzhirun? They’re a new brand and pose no threat to anyone, so why were their items specifically swapped? 
Sitting there, she suddenly thought of the events from last night, and also, after returning to the suite, the man interrogating her, and when he uttered "Ou Mucen" those eyes filled with ferocity and murderous intent. 
Finally, she shook violently, and her entire face turned deathly pale. 
It can’t be, Brother Lin isn’t that kind of person, he wouldn’t stoop so low. 
But then, another thought struck her, recalling how recently he had used three cars to desperately prevent her from going back to the factory, her heart sank again. 
Indeed, if he could commit such craziness, then what’s to stop him from seizing such an opportune moment now? 
She closed her eyes firmly, and finally, clutched the phone tightly in her palm. 
-- 
Ou Mucen spent nearly an hour, and eventually in the restored video footage found that a water delivery staff had entered and left Takazawa’s office, and he began rushing to that company. 
"Third Young Master, it’s been an hour, how’s it on your end?" 
While driving, the secretary who stayed at the venue called again, and without a second thought, he took off his headset. 
What’s the rush? Doesn’t he have a watch? 
He floored the gas pedal, racing ahead at breakneck speed. 
But just as he left the city center, got onto the overpass to head towards the district, he thought he saw a figure through the car window. 
The figure was petite, wearing a beige short coat over a caramel-colored short skirt with slender, fair legs and was pulling a suitcase, standing by the guardrail on the overpass and attempting to hail a car. noveldrama
What a lunatic! 
Coming to this place to hail a car, is she trying to get herself killed? 
He took a harsh drag on his cigarette, pressed the car window button, and flung the cigarette butt out with a flick of his hand. 
It was at that moment when the girl standing by the edge of the overpass saw him, and realized that the person driving the black Ferrari was exactly who she was looking for. 
Suddenly, her outstretched hand froze...
###Chapter 325: Chapter 325: She Saw Him, But He Didn’t Stop Again
Ou Mucen was still sprinting, and he didn’t pay attention to what was behind him. 
However, at this time, the sunlight on the overpass was exceptionally bright. As he turned the corner, a strand of golden light fell directly on the rearview mirror beside his car window, and suddenly, a very dazzling ray of light refracted and shot straight into his field of vision. 
Damn it! 
He was already in a bad mood, and this piercing light only worsened his mood. 
He cursed fiercely, reached out for the door lock, and prepared to roll up the car window he had just opened. 
It was at this moment that he glanced at the mirror next to him, and finally, in that dazzling mirror, he saw the figure behind him that was getting farther and farther away. 
That was the figure he had seen when he had opened the car door to throw out the cigarette butt and cursed as "psychopath." 
But now, she was strangely not trying to flag down a car anymore. Instead, she just carried her suitcase, turned around, and stared straight in his direction, without moving an inch! 
Really crazy! 
He glanced quickly, cursed once more, rolled down the window, and fled. 
-- 
Ye Ning stood there for a very long time, until that Ferrari eventually disappeared from her sight, then she turned around woodenly and stared blankly ahead. 
She was actually going back to the exhibition, but her car had broken down halfway, and she had no choice but to get out on the overpass. 
Hadn’t he just seen her? 
He should have, they were so close to his car, how could he have not seen her? 
So why did he ignore her? 
Was it because he really had no more interest in seeing her? 
She remembered his coldness and strangeness when he had left last night. 
And that sentence, which until now made her go pale. 
He said, "An Ning, if I help you, I hope a car runs me over!" 
Yes, he had said such a thing, so how could he possibly want to see her? 
The hand holding her suitcase finally drooped down powerlessly, her head raised in a daze as she looked at the cars that were speeding fast on the overpass. Her legs gave out, and she squatted right there. 
It hurt so much in her chest! 
As she squatted there hugging her knees, a yellow Accord sedan abruptly came to a stop in front of her on the highway where she had been waving but hardly got any stops before. 
"Young lady, why are you all alone here? It’s very dangerous," noveldrama
said a man who looked to be in his forties. He seemed very concerned when he saw her alone on the overpass. 
The man spoke in Japanese, which Ye Ning couldn’t understand a word of, but she clearly saw the kindness in his face. 
So she immediately stood up from the ground, took her suitcase, and stepped back, "Uncle, I was on my way to Tokyo City in a taxi, but it broke down on the road, and the driver told me to flag down another ride here." 
Her fluent English revealed nothing of her origins. 
The middle-aged man chuckled, "I see. Well, you can ride with me; I’m just heading to the city center." 
After saying that, he got out to help her put her suitcase in the trunk of his car. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning, despite still feeling a sense of loss, was somewhat relieved to know she could finally return to the city. A huge weight seemed to lift off her shoulders. 
Never mind all that, better just to head back first. 
Maybe after getting back, she could go look for Secretary Gao first. 
Thus, she pulled the car door open, ready to get in. 
But just at that moment, on this very overpass, the roaring sound of a sports car’s engine suddenly came from the opposite direction. 
The middle-aged man stood dumbfounded, frozen on the spot!
###Chapter 326: Chapter 326: She’s Happy Like a Child
The middle-aged uncle was so stunned that he just stood there, dumbfounded! 
God! Driving the wrong way? 
The uncle behind the wheel watched the black dot rushing towards them in the wrong direction at a breakneck speed, and his eyes almost popped out of their sockets. 
Ye Ning was also shocked, staring blankly at the dark shadow that was gracefully weaving through the traffic, her entire mind went blank! 
Isn’t that... isn’t that... 
In just about ten seconds, the shadow in front of her suddenly enlarged, and instantly, following the piercing sound of tires screeching against the ground, the black Ferrari luxury sports car that had just disappeared from her view now stopped right in front of her. 
"This is... this is..." The Accord uncle was so startled he couldn’t even speak. 
Ye Ning’s heart pounded fiercely as she watched the black sports car that had returned, forgetting what she was supposed to do and just stood there, staring dumbfoundedly at the man in the driver’s seat. 
It really was him! 
Ye Ning’s throat felt incredibly dry, and in her chest, her heart seemed ready to burst out, unable to maintain even the most basic composure. 
The person inside the car showed no intention of rolling down the window, and his eyes did not look over at her. Sitting inside, he appeared completely indifferent, as if he didn’t recognize her at all, his gaze cold, his expression detached. If it weren’t for the fact that she was the only one here, she would almost doubt that his return had nothing to do with her. 
Nonetheless, no matter his attitude, she, Ye Ning, was very happy! 
The feeling was as if she was so grateful for his return. After giving a nod to the Accord uncle, she didn’t say another word and went to retrieve her suitcase from his car’s trunk, then headed over to his car. 
Indeed, the trunk of the sports car was open, and so was the door. 
All of Ye Ning’s gloom dissipated, she opened the car door and got in. For the first time, she actually felt the joy of a child who had found back a beloved possession. 
"To... the city center!" 
"..." 
No one answered her, the only response was the sound of the car engine starting up again. 
Afterward, sitting in the car, she could only feel the vehicle underneath her perform a U-turn, and immediately, the sports car went back onto its route, speeding off forward. 
Where was he going? 
Ye Ning’s original intention wasn’t really to go back to the city. She was returning to help him find that pair of bracelets, but now she had encountered him, and yet he was still going in the opposite direction from her. 
Could it be that he had found some clue? 
Ye Ning was smart. Seeing him silently moving forward, she kept quiet as well, sitting silently behind him. 
However, it wasn’t long after she got into the car that her phone rang. Looking down, she discovered that it was a call from Lin Yebai. 
Why was he calling at this time? 
Ye Ning, reminded of the current mess at Yuzhirun, naturally felt a hint of revulsion bubbling up without even thinking, she hung up the phone. 
This was the first time she felt such an emotion towards him. Brother Lin, why did you have to do this? 
After hanging up, she guessed that he would call again if he didn’t find her, so she simply turned off her phone, tossed it into her bag, and didn’t bother with it anymore. 
The man in front was still focused on driving, but when the woman’s phone rang in the back, his gaze still flicked briefly through the rearview mirror. 
When he saw her turn off her phone and throw it into her bag, a trace of hostility in his brow finally eased a little.noveldrama
###Chapter 327: Chapter 327 Exposure
The Ferrari was fast, taking only about ten minutes to finally arrive at the water delivery company. 
Ye Ning didn’t know why he was here, but seeing the car stop, she followed him out of the car after he opened the door and stepped out. 
"Sir, may I ask what you’re here for?" 
"Finding someone!" 
Ou Mucen didn’t like to beat around the bush, so once they arrived at the company, he walked straight in through the front door. 
Startled, Ye Ning hurriedly followed behind him. As they walked inside, she kept glancing back at the security guard who was chasing after them. "Mucen, what are you doing here? Are you looking for the person who swapped your Jade Bracelet?" 
She was indeed well informed! 
Mucen strode forward, his face cold and expressionless. 
The security guard who had come running after them, upon hearing the name "Ou Mucen" from Ye Ning’s mouth, suddenly changed his expression. 
Ye Ning took all this in but said nothing to the man walking ahead. Instead, as he went into the office to find the boss, she stood outside the office door quietly staring at the security guard. 
Finding jewelry was actually all too easy for someone with her unique eyesight. 
Because she could recognize the presence of high-quality jade at a glance, her eyes were inherently suited to finding such treasures. In her eyes, what appeared colorless and tasteless to others would exude a refreshing coolness. And that coolness was the very reason her Pupula Duplex surfaced. 
As she stared for a long time, feeling that coolness but not strongly enough for her Pupula Duplex to appear, it indicated that he was a middleman, not the mastermind behind the crime. 
Lost in thought, Ye Ning looked down... 
Just then, the boss inside the office, nodding and bowing, sent the man out. 
Upon seeing this, Ye Ning hurried over and asked, "How did it go? Did you find the person you were looking for?" 
Ye Ning was a smart person; knowing he had come here, she guessed he must be looking for the person who swapped the Jade Bracelet. 
However, to her frustration, he still didn’t want to talk to her. Or perhaps he just wasn’t in the mood, because right now, he was really irritated and felt like killing someone. Lighting a cigarette, he sat down on a long bench with a stern face. 
Ye Ning saw this and decided to peek inside the office, where she saw the boss and several others watching the company’s surveillance videos. Instantly, she broke out in a cold sweat. noveldrama
At this rate, how long would it take them to go through everything? He only had three hours left. 
So she bit her lip and, without caring about anything else, came over and stood in front of him. "Why don’t we take a look at that security guard?" 
The security guard? 
The man who was smoking turned his gaze sharply towards her! 
Those were indeed two sharp and terrifying gazes! 
Feeling her heart pounding, Ye Ning quickly diverted her gaze elsewhere. "I don’t mean anything by it, just... just that he seemed a bit off, a bit suspicious..." 
She absolutely couldn’t let him discover her secret, or else it would be big trouble. 
After explaining, there was a long silence in the room, as if frozen in time, except for those eyes that kept staring at her – it was so quiet that even the sound of a pin dropping could be heard.
###Chapter 328: Chapter 328: Does this matter have anything to do with her?
"Alright, let’s see what he has to say!" 
Just as Ye Ning was about to be overwhelmed by the deadly silence, this man finally spoke, uttering his first words to her since the harsh comment he made last night. 
Agreeing to look at the security guard! 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning immediately felt as if something in her heart had finally landed, and her whole body weakened, trembling slightly. 
How tightly wound had she been? 
After agreeing to look at the security guard, the owner of the water delivery company immediately pulled up his video footage. 
Indeed, as Ye Ning had expected, shortly after they investigated the security guard, they discovered that last night at around seven, a person wearing a duckbill cap arrived at the company’s entrance. 
Afterward, the security guard gave him a set of employee uniform, and he left! 
"Someone, grab that security guard right now!" The boss, having witnessed this scene, roared and led his men to apprehend the security guard. 
Ye Ning stood behind the crowd without making a sound until everyone in the office had left. Then she approached the surveillance footage alone and watched attentively what happened next. 
"What are you still watching?" 
"Where did he put the Jade Bracelet?" Ye Ning almost blurted out her thoughts without thinking, and only after speaking did she realize her mistake, hastily leaving from the front of the computer. Then she stood there with her head bowed, not daring to make a sound. 
That was bad! 
How could she have said that? By saying so, wouldn’t he know that she was aware of the whereabouts of the Jade Bracelet? 
Ye Ning wished she could bite off her own tongue! 
Yet, to her surprise, this time the man showed no reaction. Instead, he stood there and gave the surveillance screen a cold glance before speaking indifferently, "And then? What did you see?" 
"I saw..." 
Ye Ning was a bit slow to react. 
Didn’t he suspect her? She had just let something slip, and he, such a shrewd man, hadn’t noticed anything amiss? 
She couldn’t believe it, "I saw... he returned the clothes later." 
"Clothes?" 
"Yes, I think he probably returned them to avoid getting caught. Mucen, should we go and check on that uniform now?" Ye Ning said with a cold sweat in her palms. 
In reality, the surveillance video hadn’t shown the clothes being returned. The reason she had said so was that she had seen some Jade Marrow Qi on the security guard earlier. noveldrama
Jade Marrow Qi, the essence left by the Jade Bracelet, was something her eyes could perceive. 
If the security guard had it on him, it meant the Jade Bracelet had passed through his hands, or at the very least, there had been a very close contact. 
Therefore, it was more crucial to find that uniform at this moment! 
Ou Mucen said nothing. He simply stood there with his hands in his pockets, looking down at her from his elevated position, expressionless, without a ripple. His eyes were more like those of an examiner, probing, observing, questioning... 
Her expression was evasive, which was beyond doubt. 
But such evasion didn’t seem to stem from a sense of guilt over some wrongdoing. It appeared more like an attempt to hide a secret, afraid to let him find out, and fearful of exposing herself.
So this matter actually had nothing to do with her. And her jittery and hesitant demeanor, was that because she had a secret of her own to keep?
###Chapter 329: Chapter 329: The Heterochromia Re-emerges
His eyes finally softened a bit, and he turned away, no longer paying her any attention as he lifted his foot and walked outside. 
Ye Ning stood inside and watched, startled for a moment, "Third Young Master, where are you going? Are we not going to look for those clothes? Ou Mucen!" 
She rushed out only to find that he had disappeared in no time, her anxiety causing her to call out his name repeatedly. 
Luckily, by the time she found him, she saw that he had already picked up a set of employee uniforms. Unfortunately, the security guard was nowhere to be seen, and upon asking, she found out that he had run off long ago. 
It seemed he had run away the moment they had arrived! 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning then glanced over at the uniform. 
Indeed, the moment her eyes landed on it, a strong, cool sensation wafted towards her eyes. 
The sensation was so intense that within a second, the focus in each of her eyes began to split into two, frightening her so much that, before she could even conceal it, she quickly covered her eyes with both hands. 
Those were eyes unlike those of ordinary people. If they were seen by these people, they would also think of her as a monster! 
Ou Mucen was originally speaking with the boss when he suddenly saw her shaking her shoulders and then bowing her head, covering her own eyes. His brows furrowed slightly, "What’s wrong?" 
Ye Ning’s tears flowed continuously, and her nasal passages were fiery and painful due to the appearance of the double pupils, making it difficult for her to breathe. 
Thus, covering her own eyes, she shook her head erratically, "It’s nothing, just some sand got in my eyes, I’ll go wash them." Saying that, she didn’t wait for his reaction and turned to quickly find a restroom. 
When the double pupils appeared, it was actually very painful, as if there was another eye hidden within her eyes, causing agonizing pain every time it emerged, as if it had to break through numerous obstacles to do so. 
And these obstacles were the torture of her own flesh. 
Finding the restroom, she rinsed chaotically under the faucet. At last, she managed to disperse the cold energy in her pupils, and the stinging and sourness in her nostrils and eyes began to subside. 
It had been many years since she had allowed them to fully appear; she hadn’t expected it to be so painful! 
Lifting her wet face, she looked at the mirror to see a woman with red eyes and a pale face like a ghost, taking a long time to recover her senses. 
Ou Mucen was planning to leave from outside. 
Since the security guard had run off, he, of course, had to find a way to search for him on his own; otherwise, with the boss’s capabilities, it was uncertain whether he would be found. 
So, he took the work clothes and got into the car. 
But after getting into the car, he waited a long while and did not see the woman come out. noveldrama
This damned woman, what exactly was she doing? Didn’t she know that he was short on time? 
Annoyed, he pressed the horn several times! 
Ye Ning was still in the restroom and suddenly heard this, snapping back to reality and hurriedly exiting. 
We’re leaving now? 
Seeing the impatient man in the car, she ran over and asked, "Are we leaving? Aren’t we looking for the Jade Bracelet anymore?" 
Are you blind? 
Didn’t you see the security guard has already run off? 
Ou Mucen’s expression grew even darker, "Do you think that thing would still be here?" 
"No, but we can take a trip to the nearby fishing village." 
"Fishing village?" 
"Yes, the clothes had a strong fishy smell, definitely left by the person who wore them, and such a scent could only come from fishermen." 
Ou Mucen: "..."
###Chapter 330: Chapter 330: Sir, it’s bad, Ou Mucen has already found...
Does this clothing have an odor? 
Ou Mucen, who appeared somewhat stunned by the question, actually did something very childlike. He picked up the garment and sniffed it under his nose. 
As a result, Ye Ning, who was outside the car, burst into laughter when she saw this, "Did you smell anything?" 
She didn’t have any ill intentions. She just found it amusing that this moody man suddenly made such a childish gesture. 
Ou Mucen was just smelling the clothing when he suddenly caught sight of her joyful and radiant smile. Abruptly, his fingers stiffened, and he threw the garment away as if it were plague-stricken! 
"What are you still standing there for? Get in the car already!" he said, sounding quite frantic. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning stuck out her tongue and hurriedly got into the car. 
This man’s mood really was unpredictable; he would get angry at the drop of a hat. 
So, once she got into the car, she didn’t dare say anything else and just waited for him to drive to the fishing village. 
In fact, the reason Ye Ning could provide this information wasn’t because there was actually a fishy sea odor on the clothing, but rather because she had experienced a moment of Pupula Duplex, through which she saw a chilling aura interspersed with the bloody scent of the sea. 
Pupula Duplex was, after all, an anomaly. Since she could see the aura from Jade Bracelet, naturally, she would sometimes be able to see other things that defy science. 
And, as for the bloody aura from the sea, she could think of nothing else but fishing. 
Indeed, her speculation was remarkably accurate because not long after they left the water delivery company, Xiaojin, who was still at the exhibition, received a phone call. 
"Mr. Jin, that Ou Mucen has already found this place and discovered me. What should we do?" 
"Useless!" 
Upon hearing this, Xiaojin cursed immediately. 
He hung up the phone without delay and went straight to the gentleman who was having a lively chat with the president. 
"Sir, something has happened!" 
"..." 
Lin Yebai’s hand, holding a glass of wine, paused for a moment. After greeting the president, he walked away. 
"What’s wrong?" As soon as he arrived, the smile on his face disappeared completely. 
Seeing Lin Yebai’s reaction, Xiaojin quickly replied, "The person we arranged last night just called, saying Ou Mucen has already headed over there." 
"What?" 
Upon hearing this, the normally gentle and elegant man’s face turned ashen, "Didn’t you tell me the job was done cleanly? How could he find out so quickly?" 
At that, Xiaojin’s forehead broke out in cold sweat, "I did indeed arrange it meticulously, but..." 
"There’s no ’but.’ Do you think Ou Mucen is like those people you’ve dealt with before? I’m telling you, even ten of you wouldn’t be enough for him to toy with!" 
"..." 
Xiaojin dared not speak any further and stood there without making a sound... 
The incident couldn’t really be blamed on him. If anyone was to blame, it was Ou Yuze. 
Yesterday, after he informed him of this news, Ou Yuze was the one who arranged the ensuing actions. Apart from providing the water delivery company as a resource, Xiaojin had practically done nothing else. 
It seems that that man was indeed a fool! noveldrama
Xiaojin was full of grievances. 
He stood there for quite a while before he saw the gentleman slowly calm down. 
"And the Jade Bracelet? Where exactly is the Jade Bracelet now?" 
"It’s in Ou Yuze’s hands, but if he finds that little fishing village, then finding Ou Yuze won’t be far off." 
Ou Yuze... 
The man holding the wine glass stood there with a tense face for a while, his eyes hardening behind his glasses after a moment, "Tell Ou Yuze this news!" 
Tell him?
###Chapter 331: Chapter 331: Pursuit and Kill!
Find him? 
Xiaojin looked up in surprise, "What does the gentleman mean by that...?" 
"This is a feud between uncle and nephew, isn’t it most appropriate to let them resolve it themselves?" 
As if he had found the perfect solution, the man in the pristine white tailored suit instantly regained his usual composed and elegant demeanor. 
Xiaojin felt a chill in the palms of his hands... 
Let the uncle and nephew resolve it? 
With Ou Yuze’s temperament, wasn’t it the perfect time to eliminate his uncle? noveldrama
No one knew he was in Japan, and nobody knew that the company was his, Ou Yuze’s. His uncle, currently on his own investigating the matter outside, would be so easy to kill! 
Xiaojin looked at the gentleman he had followed for many years and suddenly felt a shiver run down his spine. 
"Right, how is Aning doing? Are you sure she got on the plane?" 
"She should have. I checked her ticket, her cell phone is turned off, probably because she’s on the plane." 
"Hmm, call Nurse Zhang and tell her to contact me immediately after Miss Ye gets back." 
"Yes, gentleman!" 
With that, Xiaojin left. 
Thankfully that girl wasn’t here. If she were and found out that the man had been plotted against by the gentleman, would she ever forgive him? 
Xiaojin let out a sigh... 
---- 
Ou Mucen drove very fast. 
The fishing village, he had checked, the nearest one from here was two hundred kilometers away, and he had less than two hours left. He had to hurry. 
Ye Ning understood his situation, so after getting into the car, she didn’t disturb him and took out her cell phone to go online and reschedule her unused flight ticket. 
But before she could finish changing her booking, suddenly, she heard a "bang" from behind, and a tremendous inertia threw her from her seat! 
"Ah—" 
It was a completely unexpected shock! 
Ou Mucen in the front seat was also bounced harshly, but since he was in the front, it wasn’t as severe. Once he steadied himself and heard the scream from behind, he immediately turned around, "Are you alright?" 
Ye Ning was under the seat, and after hearing his voice, she struggled to crawl out, "What happened? Did we crash?" 
Crash? 
The man, whose face was now fully overshadowed by danger and biting cold, stared at the Porsche incessantly following them through the rearview mirror, his eyes filled with a murderous intent. 
Had he finally lost his patience? Was he going to make his move? 
His long and distinct fingers gripped the steering wheel, and he said word by word, "Come to the front!" 
Huh? 
Move to the front? 
In her panic, Ye Ning’s mind went blank, but she quickly understood his meaning. 
Yes, the one intending to hit their car was behind them; to minimize the danger; it only made sense to move to the front, to sit beside him. That was the only way to avoid being thrown around if they were hit. 
Realizing this, Ye Ning immediately started crawling from under the seat, moving toward the front. 
She had never been so flustered before, not even five years ago, with all the trauma she had experienced, had she ever been this terrified. 
This was no joke; they were being pursued for a kill. While past distress had been about secret plots, which didn’t require such fear, it was only the anger and hatred that came with understanding the truth.
###Chapter 332: Chapter 332 He’s a Madman!
But now, she was being chased down by this man, hunted like prey! 
What the hell, why did she come back? 
Ye Ning wanted to cry; her whole body shook as she crawled over, and once she tumbled onto the passenger seat, she couldn’t move anymore. 
Out of fear, and because she truly had no strength left! 
Seeing her finally making it over, Ou Mucen didn’t hesitate any longer. As his foot pressed down on the accelerator, suddenly, all Ye Ning could hear was a buzz in her ears, and as her body jolted backward, the view before the windshield became a blur, like the speeding cars in a video game, draining all the color from her face in an instant. 
This was terrifying! 
Was this a race against life and death? 
Ye Ning felt her ears go deaf, and a wave of nausea surged up in her chest. Quickly, she couldn’t bear to look anymore and tightly shut her eyes, her face turning deathly pale as she gripped the seatbelt with all her might. 
Even so, the car kept getting hit from time to time, with the speed reaching its limit, to the point that even Ou Mucen himself could hardly bear it. 
This was simply suicidal! 
Feeling unwell, this man, who had already lured the pursuing car to a location he had found on the GPS, suddenly yanked the steering wheel to the right at the fork in the road as if to head towards that exit ramp. 
The Porsche that had been following them had no idea of the trap and saw him turning toward the ramp, so it went along for the ride. 
Just then, the black Ferrari was only about ten meters from a gap!
As it pursued and drove deeper inward, suddenly, the navigation system inside the car blared frantically: "Attention, there is a 45-degree turn ahead, you are severely overspeeding!" 
A 45-degree turn? 
My God, that was such a dangerous turn, and he was driving so fast, it was practically courting death. 
In a flash, Ye Ning opened her eyes and looked ahead, and at that moment, she saw nothing but the vast sea through the windshield as if they were driving above the sea itself. noveldrama
This madman, what was he planning to do? 
Ye Ning’s face went sheet-white: "Ou Mucen, what are you doing? Stop the car, we’re going to end up at the bottom of the sea!" 
That’s right, at a 45-degree turn, if you’re going too fast, you wouldn’t be able to stop the car, and you’d fly straight off the road. 
However, the man seemed not to hear, continuing to floor the gas pedal until the Porsche behind him caught up. Then, less than ten meters from the curve, he suddenly jerked the steering wheel hard! 
In an instant, the highway was filled with the sound of screeching tires as the black Ferrari, like it had been yanked over, veered away from the guardrail. 
The Porsche behind had no time to react to what had happened; its occupants had been fixated on the Ferrari. 
Suddenly seeing it turn in an impossible maneuver, they were stunned for a moment, still clueless about what was happening, when their own Porsche, which had the accelerator pushed to the floor, whooshed perfectly past the guardrail and flew off the ramp! 
Damn! 
Help!! 
— 
For a full minute, Ye Ning was in a state of shock! 
Her expression was like she had completely short-circuited, staring blankly at the gaping hole and listening to those screams, utterly bewildered! 
A madman, this had to be a madman!
###Chapter 333: Chapter 333: We Must Put Him to Death
Ou Mucen was actually quite calm, as if he was accustomed to such events. 
After sending the car to the Underworld, he turned the vehicle around, took out his mobile phone, and prepared to call back to Tokyo. 
But when he lit up the screen, he discovered to his surprise that his phone was showing "No Service"! 
No Service? 
His phone was supposed to have global coverage, and it was a high-end custom model. How could there be no service in a place like Japan? 
He stared at the screen, and his eyes began to grow colder and colder. 
Ye Ning didn’t know what had happened. Seeing him silent after taking out his phone, with a killing aura growing ever more terrifying, she couldn’t help but feel uneasy, "So what do we do now?" 
"Back to Tokyo!" 
Without any expression, he tossed out those words, threw his phone into the glove compartment, and started the car. 
The person who could jam his phone was no ordinary individual. 
His phone, with its unique number and model, wasn’t an ordinary one you could find on the market. To jam it, one would have to be very familiar with its manufacturing and network access points. 
Therefore, the person wanting to kill him wasn’t just anyone; it had to be someone who knew him very well. 
And so, the black Ferrari began racing back. 
Ye Ning also felt that returning was the best decision at this time. 
She was aware of the situation, and she had guessed who was behind it. 
But she had never imagined that he would actually send someone after him. Brother Lin, why would you do this? 
Her fingers tightened, and her pale lips bore a row of fine teeth marks! 
However, what neither of them anticipated was the moment Ou Mucen drove out of the ramp, ready to rejoin the highway. 
Suddenly, they saw three red Range Rovers before them! 
The Range Rovers, like ghosts, were lined up blocking their path, resembling reapers crawling out of hell, waiting for their arrival. 
Ou Mucen’s car screeched to a halt! 
This was a situation that even he had not expected; it seemed that person was indeed set on taking him down. 
"What do we do? We can’t get through," Ye Ning said, her voice trembling with fear. 
It wasn’t her fault. Barely recovering from one life-threatening pursuit and now faced with such a hopeless scene, how could she possibly stay calm? 
Ou Mucen didn’t respond, but after staring at those three vehicles for a while, a ruthless glint flashed across his eyes, and he suddenly released the brake, speeding backwards. 
Ye Ning was stunned! 
Watching the trio of Range Rovers instantly give chase, she could only clutch the seatbelt tightly; she was out of options. 
"Woo..." 
"Hum... Humming..." 
It was a scene not even a movie could match. 
Usually, Range Rovers wouldn’t be able to outpace a Ferrari, but now the Ferrari was reversing, which was relatively passive. noveldrama
As the Ferrari tried desperately to escape and turn around, it was continuously bitten tightly by them, unable to break free. 
At that moment, the Ferrari had reached the bend of the ramp, the same spot where they had rushed out from behind the Porsche! 
"Watch out!" 
It was at that moment, while the man beside her was watching the rear, that a Range Rover suddenly accelerated and charged towards them from the front. 
"Bang—" 
It was a truly despairing moment. 
Ye Ning only felt the world spin above her head, a severe pain in her brain, and then her seatbelt snapped.
###Chapter 334: Chapter 334 She is Happy That He is Alive
"An Ning!!" 
In a daze, she thought she heard someone roaring her name, and then someone seemed to grab her wrist forcefully. After that, she lost consciousness... 
Two minutes later, at the ramp railing. 
The young man who had managed to send the car tumbling down the slope, now lying overturned at the edge of the cliff, stood there with a sinister smile finally breaking out on his face, "Little uncle, don’t blame me. If anyone is to blame, it’s because you shouldn’t have been born into the Ou Family." 
"Master Sun, there seemed to be a woman in that car just now." 
"A woman?" 
"Yes, if your uncle hadn’t grabbed the woman who was thrown out, he probably wouldn’t have been so easy to take down!" 
Is that so? 
Well, that’s good then. The third young master of the Ou Family dying because of a woman, that will certainly cause quite a stir when it gets out." 
His lips curved into a satisfied smile, "Throw the fire down." 
"Yes, Master Sun!" 
If they were going to kill him, naturally, it was better to eliminate all traces. 
---- 
Ye Ning was awakened by the strong smell of smoke. 
As soon as she woke up, the first thing she felt was intense pain on her head; when she touched it, her hand came away covered in blood! 
Where... where was she? 
And why was there fire? 
She began to slowly take in her surroundings and when she saw that she was trapped inside a car, with flames approaching not far away, she finally came to her senses and immediately turned to the side. 
"Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen?" 
The man beside her was also unconscious, with blood on his forehead, but Ye Ning saw that it was his hand that was tightly gripping her left wrist. 
That grip was very firm, and even though he was unconscious, it hadn’t loosened. 
So, the force from her wrist that had stopped her from being thrown out before losing consciousness, it was him who had grabbed her? 
Ye Ning felt even more distressed at the bottom of her heart, struggled to move her body out, and crawled to his side: "Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen, wake up!" 
"Ugh..." 
At her patting, at last, the man who had been unconscious for a long time slowly opened his eyes from the darkness. 
"Ou Mucen, you’re awake!!" Seeing him finally awake, tears welled up uncontrollably in Ye Ning’s eyes. 
It was joy from the bottom of her heart! noveldrama
Ou Mucen had just regained consciousness and his mind was still foggy, but the moment he opened his eyes and saw the woman lying beside him, who was so happy to see him awake that even the corners of her eyes were wet, the pain in his body didn’t feel as unbearable. 
He was awake, and she was this happy? 
"Ou Mucen, we need to leave here quickly, there’s fire over there." 
Fire? 
Ou Mucen finally came to his senses and looked in the direction she was pointing. 
Indeed, behind the car, a large blaze was encroaching. 
So, his ashen face nodded, "Okay!" he agreed to her suggestion. 
Ye Ning saw this and immediately crawled toward the door on her side of the car. 
Her small figure had not been crushed much, probably because he had pulled her in time when the car flipped. 
Using her hands and feet, she was about to crawl out when suddenly, from behind her, a painful groan came from the man: "Ugh..." 
What happened? 
Did he hurt himself somewhere? 
Upon hearing it, Ye Ning’s heart tightened, and she immediately turned and crawled back, "What’s wrong? Where are you hurt?" 
"I’m stuck..."
Ou Mucen’s face was covered in cold sweat, and his brows furrowed with unmistakable pain.
###Chapter 335: Chapter 335: Listen, I’m here, I won’t let you die!
Ye Ning saw it and her complexion instantly turned pale; she rushed over without a second thought. Pressing herself against him, she looked toward his legs. 
They were indeed trapped. When the car had flipped, the entire dashboard had collapsed, and at this moment, it was pressing down on his foot. 
"It’s okay, I’ll help you move it!" She didn’t know where the courage came from, but after seeing this, she suddenly shifted her entire body down, intending to use her own body to push away the collapsed debris. 
Ou Mucen became furious when he saw her actions. "What are you doing? Get out of here quick, this will only cause both of us to die inside." 
Die then! 
After all, if he was going to die, she wouldn’t be happy living on; she couldn’t just watch him die because of her. 
Ye Ning ignored him and kept crawling down. 
Fortunately, her body was small enough, and after squeezing in, she soon used her frail back to forcefully lift the fallen dashboard and the steering wheel. 
"Try it, can you pull them out now?" The moment she felt a bit of space loosen up beneath, she immediately looked up at the man. 
Ou Mucen had been watching her all the while; his vision was somewhat blurred from the pain, but at that moment, her fragile yet incredibly stubborn and determined figure was vividly etched into his view. 
Did she really care about his life and death that much? 
He finally managed to tug at the pale corners of his lips and moved his legs. 
"Need to move it a little more." 
"Okay, right!" 
The girl, almost drenched in sweat, heard this and pushed her slender shoulders up once more. 
And with that push, Ou Mucen’s legs were finally able to move. Ignoring the pain elsewhere on his body, he propped himself up and wriggled out. 
Afterward, the two finally escaped from the overturned car. 
Once out, according to the terrain, they should quickly climb up to be rescued. 
However, after they climbed out, they discovered that the raging fire had consumed the entire path upwards, leaving them no way to cross. 
What should they do? 
Ye Ning despaired! 
Ou Mucen’s face was also stern and severe, but after glancing at the roiling waves of the sea chasm behind him, he made a very bold decision. 
"Jump down!" 
"What? Jump down?" Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s legs went weak. 
No, she wouldn’t jump. She had a deep fear of water, all stemming from a disaster her family endured when she was six years old. 
Fear began to show on her face, and she started to back away continuously, "I won’t jump, I can’t swim, I will drown." 
"But if you don’t jump, you’ll still die. When the fire reaches here, the car will explode, and you will be blasted to smithereens." 
A vein throbbed on Ou Mucen’s forehead. 
What was wrong with this woman? Just moments ago, she was so calm in saving him, but now she was unreasonably acting like a lunatic. Didn’t she realize that not jumping meant certain death? 
Ou Mucen went to grab her! 
But at that moment, upon seeing him walking toward her, the overwhelming fear and shadows of her childhood caused her to panic and turn, running toward the blaze. 
She would rather gamble here; she refused to jump into the ocean.noveldrama
No, she would rather die than jump! 
Watching her from behind, Ou Mucen was about to explode with anger. He chased after her swiftly and without saying anything, grabbed her arm: "Listen to me, with me by your side, I won’t let you die!" 
"..."
###Chapter 336: Chapter 336: He Jumped Down with Her, Pulling Her Along Like a Kite
His voice was very loud, as if he were shouting, and it was evident that his rage was caused by her! 
Ye Ning finally stood still, her eyes wide open as she looked at him, her expression that of a child who had been startled, filled with confusion, terror, and trembling... 
She did not seem like someone who was scared of jumping into the sea, but rather as if there was some man-eating creature below that would consume her alive. The fear and fright in her eyes were so intense that even he was taken aback. 
What exactly was she afraid of? 
Could it be that what she truly feared was not the jump into the sea? noveldrama
Ou Mucen saw those eyes brimming with transparent droplets due to terror, and finally, something inexplicably choked up inside him, his tone softened, "I won’t let you die. Even if we jump, I’ll always be by your side." 
This was the first time he had ever said such words to a woman! 
He would not let her die. He would always be by her side. For the first time in his 28 years, he made such a promise. 
Ye Ning finally stopped struggling, letting him lead her step by step to the edge of the cliff, where she heard the sound of her blood ceasing to flow in her veins. 
And in her chest, her heart was ’thumping, thumping, thumping’ with violent beats! 
"One, two, three... jump!" 
"Ahhhh!!!" 
The moment she was pulled down, Ye Ning still screamed heartrendingly! 
It was the sound of fear pushed to its limits, as if someone with a fear of heights was pushed off a rooftop, or like someone who fears snakes found one deliberately placed inside their body. 
That sensation was a hundred times more cruel than falling into hell itself! 
It was then, on the spot where the two had just stood, that a blaze finally exploded! 
Following a loud ’bang’, a massive fireball rose up, and countless rocks blasted off the cliff edge, emitting a series of terrifying, deafening booms. 
Ou Mucen, hearing it from below and feeling the air currents shift around him, immediately yanked the small hand in his palm toward himself, and the two of them plunged into the sea together! 
"Ah..." 
The sudden, all-encompassing chill finally halted the woman’s screaming. 
But this cessation did not mean she became calm; instead, upon entering this tranquil yet icy world, she began to thrash wildly like a lunatic, as if she had entered the most terrifying place in her nightmares. 
"Glub... glub..." 
What was she doing? 
Did she have a death wish? 
Ou Mucen, who had been holding onto her, was initially swimming towards the shore with her after they hit the water, but seeing her violent struggling, he had no choice but to swim over to try to bring her up for air. 
Otherwise, she would surely drown here. 
However, before his other hand could even touch her, she started flailing and kicking wildly, as if electrocuted. 
Indeed, those who can’t swim often struggle uncontrollably out of instinct when drowning, and this is why many would-be rescuers end up ensnared and drowned themselves. 
That was exactly how Ou Mucen felt, and thoughts of strangling her crossed his mind. 
But in the end, he did not strangle her. Instead, as he saw her struggling less and less and the bubbles from her mouth decreasing, he, almost as if punishing her, dragged her over and pressed her fiercely against his lips!
###Chapter 337: Chapter 337: Have You Kissed Enough?
This undisciplined dead woman! 
In the sea, the violently churning water finally calmed down, and this woman, after receiving fresh air when the man’s cool, thin lips pressed against her own, stopped moving as well. 
It was truly like a fish on the brink of death suddenly catching a life-saving straw! 
Ye Ning had never actually felt this desperate before, not even when she was in prison, confined in that narrow room, yet she had never felt as uncomfortable as she did today. 
The feeling today was... 
More like being thrown into the same dark abyss that had tormented her for more than a decade, with no light, no air, and no hope, all there was deep fear and despair. 
That’s why, just now, she struggled so desperately to escape this place. noveldrama
But her struggle didn’t lead to her escaping from that cage; instead, it made the discomfort in her chest grow worse, including her lungs, which felt as if they were on fire. 
Until this moment, when a pair of cool, thin lips pressed down hard on hers, and she finally came back to life! 
What was that? 
Her hands clasped tightly around the body that had given her the source of life, just like an octopus! 
Ou Mucen stiffened for a moment, feeling an electric tingling sensation coursing through his body. 
This dead woman, what is she doing?
Does she know what he is doing to her right now? 
Ou Mucen’s body jerked, if earlier it was just like an electric current passing through him, now what surged within him was a rapid and uncontrollable heat. 
This damned woman, does she know she’s playing with fire? 
Finally, his eyes darkened completely, and with a fierce pull, he grasped her chin and kissed her with a madness several times stronger than hers! 
Pain... 
The dazed Ye Ning finally woke up from the pain on her lips. 
Opening her eyes, and seeing the magnified handsome face before her, her mind went "buzz", as if struck by lightning! 
Oh my God! 
What had she just been doing? Why would she? Why would she... 
Ye Ning felt as if she were in a dream! 
Mucen was also staring at her, except his look was more annoyed and more domineering. 
The meaning couldn’t be more obvious, "Are you coming or not?" 
Ye Ning shivered and quickly pushed him away. She let go of him, her face flushed with shame as if she had committed a terrible misdeed, and then tried to run! 
How embarrassing, what on earth was she doing just now? 
How did she... How did she... 
She wished she could vanish from in front of him instantly! 
But the truth was, an instant after leaving him, she couldn’t cope in the sea, which was all water; floundering, she was about to drown. 
Ou Mucen saw this and finally came over, grabbed her again without looking at her face, and led her straight out of the water. 
Oh! 
Heaven! It feels so good to be alive... 
Finally breathing fresh air, Ye Ning began to breathe heavily.
###Chapter 338: Chapter 338: Do You Think You Are a Drifting Bottle?
Being alive, it really is great! 
Ou Mucen also surfaced, wiping the droplets of water from his face as soon as he did so, his gaze sweeping around him. 
"There’s a beach over there, let’s swim towards it." 
After scanning the area, he spotted a beach roughly five hundred meters away and pointed toward it, indicating they should swim over. 
Ye Ning found it hard to look at him. 
The incident beneath the sea had been too embarrassing; she didn’t dare to speak to him boldly. 
So, with her face blushing and a soft "um," she stretched out her hand, ready to let him pull her along as they swam across. 
But this man, floating on the surface, glimpsed her extended hand and, with dewy beads glistening on his handsome face, a trace of mockery flashed in his eyes, "Do you think you’re just a ’message in a bottle’?" 
Huh? 
Message in a bottle? What did he mean by that? 
Ye Ning didn’t understand until the man glanced at her own body; then, she had an epiphany! 
He meant for her to hold on to his body—it was the only way he could use his hands to paddle and carry her across. Merely holding hands, he wouldn’t be able to swim with her at all. 
So he compared her to a message in a bottle? 
Feeling both hot in the face and irritated, she looked at his robust body suspended beneath the water, and finally, her heart pounding, she mustered the courage to move closer. 
"Where should I hold on?" 
"Where do you think you should hold on?" 
"..." 
The conversation couldn’t continue! 
Ye Ning closed her eyes and wrapped her arms around his waist. 
This was the first time she had ever taken the initiative to embrace a man. 
The man’s physique was impressive, his strong bones and perfect lines, devoid of any excess flesh, were like the finest works crafted by a master, and holding him made her heart race even faster. 
And the body she clung to tensed for a moment as her delicate hands climbed up to his chest and cautiously pressed against him from behind, stirring a different sort of emotion within him. 
"I’m holding on now..." Having successfully embraced the man, Ye Ning hung on his back and told him shyly. 
Ou Mucen’s eyes flickered, looking at those slender, pale fingers struggling to hold on to his muscular chest, the corners of his eyes twitched, and finally, a smirk appeared. 
"Are you a pig?" 
"Huh?" 
"Have you ever seen lifeguards in the water carrying people out like this?" 
"..." 
Remaining in that position, Ye Ning was frozen for at least a dozen seconds, and she couldn’t counter with a single word. 
Was he doing this on purpose? 
Was he doing it on purpose?! 
Ye Ning really wanted to curse. 
Thankfully, at that moment, the lunatic finally started to get serious. 
So Ye Ning only saw him stretch out his long arm, pull her from behind to his side, and then he positioned her on his right shoulder. 
So that was it! 
With realization dawning upon her, Ye Ning blushed again, as the new position brought her even closer to him. 
"Hold on tight!" 
Ou Mucen, however, didn’t pay attention to this; carrying someone in water, this was indeed the standard position. If he didn’t do this, how could he carry her across? noveldrama
Yet, when he reached out to wrap his arm around her, a brief discomfort flared in his upper left abdomen. 
It must have been a strain! 
But it was just a momentary pain, and then it was gone, so he dismissed it and began swimming with one hand towards the beach, taking her with him. 
By this time, they had already exceeded the four-hour mark given by the organizers.
###Chapter 339: Chapter 339: Ou Mucen’s Accident!
La Chenxi realized there was an issue with Ou Mucen’s phone two hours ago. 
Langya Pavilion— 
First Beauty: Have any of you been in contact with the Third Young Master? 
Store Manager Ji: Contact about what? 
Young Master Zhan: Why would I bother myself with that? 
Son of Xia: First Beauty, you seem particularly concerned about our Third Young Master. 
First Beauty: ..... 
Clutching her phone and standing there, it took a long while for her to calm the nerves inside her. 
In this group, her real identity is actually known only by Ji Chengzhi. They started playing games together, and because she wanted to get closer to him, she trained crazily for a whole half year. 
After half a year, with Ji Chengzhi’s assistance, she smoothly joined their team and became the only female member among the Four Young Masters of A City. 
Ji Chengzhi said that if she wanted to stay on the team, she should not expose her identity; otherwise, that man would immediately kick her out. 
After calming down, she didn’t dare to chat in the group anymore and directly messaged Ji Chengzhi privately. 
"Chengzhi, Mucen’s phone has been unreachable for two hours now, can you get through to him?" 
Two hours? 
While in the lab, Ji Chengzhi received this message and looked at his watch on his wrist, "What do you mean by unreachable? Is he not on his computer? Or did you comment on his Weibo and he didn’t reply?" 
La Chenxi: "..." 
Flushing with embarrassment, it took her a long time to reply awkwardly, "No, it’s just that he’s unreachable." 
She did not specify the reason, but Ji Chengzhi on the other end knew very well. 
Ever since her regret, she has been following everything about that man daily, from his games to his news, and even his Weibo and WeChat, not missing a thing. 
However, who was that person? 
He rarely chatted on WeChat and had even less time for gaming; the only place she could probably check his activity was on the Weibo he had helped her download. 
Alright, for this senior sister, he had opted for the "always online" status when downloading his Weibo, so even if he didn’t post anything, she could still see him online. noveldrama
So now she says she can’t reach him... 
Ji Chengzhi finally took out his own phone. 
Indeed, the person who was always online was offline today. 
Ji Chengzhi began to feel that something was not right, so he found the number and called it. 
"Hello, the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable!" 
"..." 
Temporarily unavailable? 
His powerful phone, unavailable? 
Ji Chengzhi hung up the phone, "Indeed, he can’t be reached. Has something happened over there?" 
La Chenxi quickly replied, "The exhibits he was present for in Japan got swapped, Gao Ziyang said he went to look into it, but I went to the water supply company and they said he had already left, and no one has seen him since." 
This woman is really something, following so closely! 
Then he pondered for a moment before saying, "Hold on, I’ll send you the internet access port for his phone, so you can try to pinpoint his location." 
"I’ve already tried that, there’s no signal at all!" 
"..." 
Ji Chengzhi held the phone and stood there, a very long time passing without him being able to utter another word. 
Hold on, how did she know about that man’s phone’s internet access port? That information, apart from Ji Chengzhi and some of the Ou Family, absolutely no outsider knew. 
Ji Chengzhi suddenly felt a surge of repulsion, a repulsion so strong it made him regret having helped her in the past.
###Chapter 340: Chapter 340 Help Me Do a DNA Test
Ji Chengzhi finally told her that he indeed lost contact with Ou Mucen, then he hung up the phone. 
At this time, of course, he would choose to leave the matter to her, Japan was her territory; she was more familiar with it than he was. 
Besides, given her concern for him, she’d likely turn Japan upside down to find him. 
Having hung up the phone, someone came looking for him. Seeing that he was inside, the person entered, "Director, didn’t you ask me to do a DNA test last time? Where are the two blood samples?" 
Right! 
There was still that matter! 
Reminded by this, Jicheng immediately turned and went to his personal refrigerator, taking out two blood samples that had been stored there for several days, "Don’t get them mixed up, this is very important." 
The doctor nodded at the blood samples that were simply marked with a symbol, "Don’t worry, I won’t make mistakes. But when do you want the results, Director?" 
"As soon as possible!" 
"All right!" 
The doctor agreed and left with the two blood samples. 
The Director usually wouldn’t handle such matters himself. Suddenly taking two blood samples without any documentation for a DNA report... 
Could it be that the Director had done something secretive and now required verification? 
The doctor’s mouth was agape with shock... 
---- 
Ou Mucen eventually brought Ye Ning to the beach. As soon as they reached the shore, he could no longer hold on and collapsed there, completely exhausted. 
It was really tiring, swimming 500 meters while towing someone who couldn’t swim; anyone would be exhausted! 
Ye Ning understood this, so after she got ashore, she didn’t dare to disturb him further. Feeling the stinging saltwater on her face, she took off her drenched coat, wrung it out, and wiped her face before the view in front of her became clearer. 
Once her vision was clear, she began to survey the beach they had landed on, only to find the situation was not so optimistic. Overgrown with wild grass and littered with debris, it was apparent that the place was rarely, if ever, visited. 
Was there a way out of this place? 
She frowned in concern and glanced at the thick wild grass not far away. After pondering for a moment, she took a step toward it and proceeded in that direction. noveldrama
She wasn’t a pampered heiress; the sparse wild grass was nothing to someone who grew up as an orphan and had survived five years of dark times. 
As she approached, she saw that the wild grass was made up of sharp, tall blades. To avoid cutting herself, she put on her damp coat and then carefully parted the grass and began to tread forward. 
This was indeed a dense thicket of grass where, once inside, it was nearly impossible to turn around. 
Ye Ning carefully watched her step, wary of poisonous snakes potentially hiding in the grass, so she broke off a stalk and used it to beat ahead as she felt her way forward. 
Luckily, even though the wild blades looked thorny from the outside, the unattended overgrowth throughout the years meant the roots were rather orderly and robust. Thus, Ye Ning faced little obstruction upon entering. 
Ou Mucen was still lying on the beach; he was genuinely tired, especially around his chest and abdomen. Ever since he woke up in the car and escaped, he hadn’t felt right, and swimming over with that woman had only exacerbated it. 
Lying there, he rested for a good while until he felt less uncomfortable. Finally, he opened his eyes and looked around... 
Where had the woman gone?
###Chapter 341: Chapter 341: The Fallen Young Master of the Ou Family
He looked around and noticed that the woman who had just been by his side on the beach had disappeared, which immediately prompted him to sit up from the sand. noveldrama
"An Ning——" 
"..." 
No one answered; all that responded to him was the sound of the sea breeze whistling past and the crisp noise of the waves slapping against the shore. 
What’s going on? 
She couldn’t have been... washed away by the sea again and drowned, could she? 
He remembered that when he came ashore earlier, she had appeared to be lying limp in the shallow water, which suddenly caused his heart to "thump" with anxiety, and he quickly stood up from the sand. 
"An Ning, where are you?" 
"An Ning——" 
"I’m here... Mucen, I’m here..." 
Finally, someone replied to him, but the voice came from behind him, out of a clump of waist-high weeds. 
How did she get there? What was she doing? 
Mucen hurried over: "What are you doing in there? Come out quickly!" 
Ye Ning had already sensed the cool air coming from the other side by that point, and hearing the man outside questioning her displeasedly, she quickly turned her head and said, "There’s a way out here, Mucen, come in quickly." 
A way out? 
Mucen, standing in front of the weeds, paused for a moment. 
Was there really a way out through this tangle of weeds? 
He was skeptical, but since the woman inside had said so, he pushed aside his distaste and pushed through the weeds. 
Once inside, the thick smell of dampness came rushing into his nostrils, accompanied by the scent of rot and decay, causing him to frown and instinctively cover his nose as he continued walking forward. 
He was a rich young master with a severe penchant for cleanliness; when had he ever been to such a place? 
While Ye Ning waited, when she finally saw him appear before her, what she witnessed was the sight of a man covered in sea sand that hadn’t even dried yet, his nose covered, eyes fixated on the weeds as if he were looking at the plague, breaking them off with the dead branch in his hand to clear a "path of light" before he was willing to come over. 
Indeed, a young master was still a young master, no matter how many years had passed, his ways remained the same. 
Ye Ning found it somewhat amusing to watch but held back her laughter to avoid detection, waiting for him to approach before pointing behind her, "Smell that, is there a breath of fresh air coming through?" 
Mucen leaned in to check and after a moment, nodded, "Indeed there is, we can move on!" 
In a matter of seconds, he naturally transformed from the follower to the leader. 
Ye Ning didn’t argue, instead, after he started giving orders, she picked up the dead branch and continued to lead the way, "The environment here is not good, I’m shorter, I’ll go first." 
Her implication was clear: she would blaze the trail, he would follow... 
Mucen frowned, wanting to say something, but in the end, upon seeing the dusty and decaying mess of weeds blocking his path, he tacitly agreed to her approach. 
Forget it, he could just give her an extra bonus when they got back. 
And so, the two of them finally began to move forward. 
In fact, Ye Ning’s guess was completely correct; just beyond the dense weeds was the exit of the beach, and on the other side of the weeds was the fishing village nearby the sea area. 
However, as Ye Ning walked ahead, she suddenly felt that something was not quite right behind her...
###Chapter 342: Chapter 342: He Collapsed without Warning!
She turned around and was shocked to find that the person who had been following her all along had not caught up. 
"Ou Mucen? Why have you stopped walking?" 
She looked at the man who had abandoned the dead twigs, his right hand now gripping the grass root beside him, slightly bent over at the waist, and hurried back to him: "What’s wrong with you?" 
He had a germ phobia, and earlier he didn’t even want to touch these grass roots, even breaking them with dead twigs before coming over. Why was he holding onto it now? 
Ye Ning’s heart sprouted a bad premonition and she walked over to take a closer look at what was wrong with him. 
But at that moment, he suddenly stood up straight and his hand quickly let go of the grass root: "It’s nothing, how much longer until we can get out? 
"Soon... very soon..." Ye Ning stared at him blankly, her eyes filled with the dense sweat beads on his forehead, and his face that seemed a bit pale. 
Was he... sweating? 
Or was it water from when they came out of the sea that hadn’t dried? 
"Then let’s hurry, it’s getting late. If we don’t get out soon, it will be dark," Ou Mucen said casually, and then he was the first to step forward and walk on. 
At his departure, Ye Ning paused again! 
However, since he was moving forward, she followed along, and the two of them continued walking through the grass for about ten minutes. 
After about ten minutes, finally, the view ahead started to brighten. Seeing this, Ye Ning’s eyes lit up: "Mucen, look, we’re about to get out." 
Mucen saw it too, so he took the grass twig in his hand and swung it at the last clump of grass! 
It was at this moment that the sharp pain in his upper left abdomen, which had appeared not long ago, struck again. It felt like something was tearing inside, and in the span of one second, he collapsed to the ground without any warning. 
My God! 
Ou Mucen!!! 
Ye Ning, who saw it from behind, was dumbfounded. Once she realized what had happened, she screamed and rushed over: "Ou Mucen? Mucen!!!" 
But his response was impressively quick. Within less than three seconds, he had already fallen into unconsciousness on the ground, unresponsive to her calls. 
Ye Ning was petrified, disregarding everything, she crouched in front of him, only then noticing that his entire body was as if lifted out of water once more, covered in sweat beads like raindrops. 
And his lips, the firmly closed lips, were devoid of any color. 
So the beads of water on his forehead just now, they were not as she thought, but actually his cold sweat? noveldrama
Ye Ning began to shiver all over, bending over to pick him up from the ground, she started panicking and begging him: "Mucen, wake up, please wake up, don’t scare me, Mucen..." 
The last few words were almost cried out! 
She had no choice, she had never seen him fall in front of her like this, so unexpectedly and so rapidly. For her, it was something she had never even contemplated. 
But now, he had truly collapsed in front of her, and within three seconds, was completely unconscious. A man so tall and strong now lay in her arms, unresponsive. 
"Mucen, I beg you, wake up..." 
But what made her more and more panic-stricken was that no matter how she called out to him, he remained unresponsive, as if he had fallen into an eternal sleep.
###Chapter 343: Chapter 343 Panic
No, he won’t stay asleep! 
She began forcing herself to calm down, though droplets of water already fell uncontrollably from her eyes filled with panic. Despite this, her hands slapped her own head, compelling herself to remain cool-headed. 
Yes, at this time, she couldn’t panic, she absolutely couldn’t! 
She took several deep breaths and finally felt less shaky. Then she wiped her face and began biting her lip as she looked over his body. 
Falling unconscious for no reason must mean something had happened, otherwise, given his physique, it would be impossible. 
So, what had happened to him? 
She recalled the car accident they had before jumping into the sea, and immediately, she lifted his shirt and rolled up his trouser legs as well. 
However, to her bewilderment, there were no fatal wounds on his body. Other than a few scratches, there was mostly nothing serious. 
Then why was he like this? 
Why? 
She lifted her head to look around, and upon seeing the dim surroundings amid the thatch with a musty and damp scent in the air, suddenly, her eyes lit up. 
Right, it must be the air! 
She finally remembered how he had paused and failed to keep up more than ten minutes ago, and immediately, she stood up from the ground and broke off the remaining thatch leaves with her hands. 
Then, she went over and helped him up from the ground, dragging and carrying him out of the thatch. 
He was really too heavy; a man over one meter eighty, for her, a girl just over one meter sixty, was like a boulder in weight, definitely enough to crush her. 
But no matter what, she managed to get him out of the thatch. 
Coming out of the thatch, what relieved her was that outside it was indeed clear, the view had opened up, and the highway wasn’t far away; on the surface, they had made it out. 
So, she immediately laid him down on the ground and began to rescue him! noveldrama
She had learned some basic self-rescue knowledge; she had needed this knowledge too many times in the past five years. 
Having laid him down in a well-ventilated spot, she began by pinching his philtrum with her fingers, while the other hand unbuttoned his chest in hopes that after giving him a chance to breathe, she would perform CPR on him. 
However, what she had not expected at all was that when she released her fingers from his philtrum and pressed down on his left chest in an absolutely standard posture, she did not see him resume breathing. 
Instead, she saw his tightly closed lips part slightly, and a thread of bright red liquid flowed from the corner of his mouth! 
!!!!!!! 
For a whole minute, she knelt beside him, dumbfounded, while her eyes, fixated on that strand of scarlet, were as if struck by lightning, no longer able to move. 
What was that feeling? 
Shock? 
No, it wasn’t! 
It was a feeling as if her soul had been scared away, her thoughts seemed to have stopped functioning due to sheer horror, her eyes staring blankly at the bright red, completely blank. 
How could this happen?!!!! 
"Hello, did something happen?" 
"..." 
Ye Ning immediately turned her head, like grabbing a lifeline in the dark, and turned to look behind...
###Chapter 344: Chapter 344: Rescued
It was a Japanese woman in a kimono, about thirty years old, wearing a pair of wooden clogs. At this moment, she stood behind her, looking at the man lying next to her with concern. 
Ye Ning couldn’t understand Japanese, but at this time, she couldn’t care less about what she was saying. She jumped to her feet and ran in front of her: "please. Help me!" 
"What are you talking about?" 
"I beg you to save him. He’s really dangerous!" 
"..." 
The two exchanged several sentences back and forth, but in the end, neither could understand the other. 
It wasn’t until then, from behind the Japanese woman, that more shouting was heard. Ye Ning lifted her head and realized that a farm truck had stopped on the road nearby, and at this moment, someone in the truck was shouting toward them. 
Did they just happen to be passing by here? 
Fearing that the woman might be called away, Ye Ning, in her urgency, reached out and grabbed her wrist: "please. Help me!" 
(Please help me!) 
Observing this, the Japanese woman finally turned to look at the man who was calling her. Ye Ning watched as she loudly said a few words to him, prompting him to also get off the truck. 
"What happened to you?" 
To Ye Ning’s delight, the man who approached could speak English, although it wasn’t very fluent, but at least, communication was no longer an issue. 
So, without delay, she began speaking: "He suddenly fainted, it’s very serious, can you help me take him to the hospital?" 
(To avoid reading difficulty, the following dialogue is presented in Chinese.) 
Faint? noveldrama
Upon hearing this, the Japanese man finally came over. Seeing Ou Mucen lying on the ground and the blood on the corner of his mouth, his complexion changed abruptly: "It does seem very serious." 
"Right? So, let’s take him to the hospital first." 
"But we have to go to the village for a performance..." 
"..." 
Watching Ou Mucen lying on the ground, Ye Ning could read a hint of dispute from their faces as the two conversed. 
Fortunately, it seemed the man was willing to listen to the woman, and the concern was already evident on her face upon seeing the unconscious Mucen. 
Ye Ning, squatting there, saw them argue for a while, but they finally decided to help her take him to the hospital. 
"All right, I will take him to the hospital." 
"Thank you, thank you so much!" Ye Ning was truly on the verge of kneeling down in gratitude. 
The Japanese man, having helped the unconscious Mucen off the ground, then shouldered him. Together, the group of four got into the truck and began rushing towards the nearest hospital. 
As for Japan, Ye Ning really wasn’t familiar with it. She didn’t know what this place was? Or who lived here? What were the medical facilities like? 
She knew none of it; the only thing she knew was that she had to get him to a place where he could be saved, no matter what. 
The truck sped down the road, with Ye Ning sitting in the back, guarding the man. She didn’t dare to look at the scenery passing by, holding on to his hand, anxiously staring ahead, waiting for the hospital to appear. 
However, to her disappointment, after about twenty minutes of driving, what they came upon was a very secluded small village. 
And the so-called hospital they referred to was nothing more than a clinic similar to the rural health stations found in China. 
"This..."
###Chapter 345: Chapter 345 He’s badly injured...
"The nearest one is this one; if we go to a big hospital, it will take at least two hours to drive. I think we should have a look here for now. If it’s no good, we can contact an ambulance from the big hospital while we wait here," said the Japanese driver, seemingly seeing through Ye Ning’s disappointment. 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning had no choice but to agree helplessly. 
What else could she do? 
Here, she was unfamiliar with everything, without a vehicle, and this Japanese man’s method was the best option available. 
She nodded in agreement to his suggestion, and as soon as the truck arrived at the clinic, they all quickly got out and carried the still unconscious Ou Mucen inside. 
"Doctor, doctor, come quickly. Someone’s fainted!" As soon as they entered the clinic, the Japanese man shouted out in Japanese. 
Ye Ning followed behind. Not understanding Japanese, she could only stick close to him, while the Japanese woman in a kimono went to fetch the doctor from the consultation room. 
Fortunately, although this Japanese village clinic was small, their medical standards and equipment were much better than what she was used to back home. 
The doctor was called out and, seeing the blood flowing from Ou Mucen’s mouth as he lay on the stretcher, looked at his eyelids and immediately said, "Internal bleeding!" 
"..." 
What was he saying? 
Ye Ning didn’t understand, so she immediately looked at the Japanese man for an explanation. 
The Japanese man hastily explained, "The doctor says it’s internal bleeding that caused the unconsciousness." 
Internal bleeding? 
Ye Ning’s face went pale in an instant! 
Internal bleeding, how could that be? noveldrama
But soon, she remembered waking up in the car and seeing the dashboard crushed against his legs, preventing him from moving, and it all made sense. 
Yes, the dashboard had been pressing on his legs, but the steering wheel had been pushing against his chest. 
So, it was quite normal for him to have internal bleeding. 
But what to do about internal bleeding? 
Ye Ning began to panic again, wanting to ask the doctor for more details, but the doctor, after a brief examination, immediately wheeled him into the emergency room. 
Ye Ning watched and could only wait outside with a pale face. 
While waiting, the Japanese man intended to leave, but the Japanese woman, seeing Ye Ning all alone, couldn’t bear to go and decided to stay with her. 
"Don’t worry, your husband will be fine. The doctors here are very good!" As the Japanese man left, the Japanese woman began to gesture in an attempt to communicate with Ye Ning, aiming to ease her nervousness. 
"..." 
Ye Ning was a smart person. Although she didn’t understand the woman’s meaning exactly, she got the gist of it and nodded, stopped pacing around anxiously, and sat down in a chair. 
She didn’t have to wait long before the doctor came out of the emergency room. 
Seeing him, Ye Ning stood up immediately and hurried towards him, "Doctor, how is the patient?" 
She spoke in English! 
The doctor looked at her surprisingly for a moment and then replied in English, "It’s a ruptured spleen, with a large amount of blood in the abdominal cavity." 
Ruptured spleen? 
Ye Ning was shocked at the unfamiliar term! 
How could he have a ruptured spleen? Could the steering wheel have caused such severe
###Chapter 346: Chapter 346: Does He Have the Same Blood Type as Xiaobao?
She remembered the scene and felt somewhat perplexed, "If it was a spleen rupture, how come he didn’t faint right then and there? Instead, symptoms emerged one or two hours later?" 
"A spleen rupture generally doesn’t elicit a strong reaction initially. The pain intensifies as blood slowly accumulates in the abdominal cavity, and in severe cases, it can be life-threatening." 
The doctor explained to her. 
Life-threatening? 
At the mention of those words, Ye Ning turned pale again, "How is he now? Is it serious?" 
"He needs surgery immediately to remove the accumulated blood in the abdominal cavity, but we don’t have enough blood of his type here. We need to get some from the blood bank right away." 
Not enough blood? 
Ye Ning was stunned for a moment, and naturally asked, "What’s his blood type?" 
"AB!" noveldrama
AB? 
Wasn’t that Xiaobao’s blood type? 
Upon hearing his blood type, Ye Ning’s mind reflexively jumped to that conclusion. 
Yes, her Xiaobao had that blood type. Back then, she remembered the doctor saying that if the child had this type of blood, then the father must also have the same type, because her own was A, and now the child’s was AB, so the father being AB was the only possibility. 
It was such a coincidence that he also had that blood type! 
Recalling these painful past events, a hint of bitterness flickered in Ye Ning’s eyes, "I am aware of this blood type; it’s the rarest among the four types." 
"Yes, so we don’t have much of it at our medical station either." 
"Where is the blood bank? Is it far?" 
"Not far, but you’ll need to make a payment first," he said, passing her a form. 
When Ye Ning saw it, she finally remembered this crucial matter. At this moment, after both of them had jumped into the sea, they were penniless. 
What to do? 
She turned her gaze to the two Japanese people standing behind her. 
But now, these two, albeit willing to help, started to hedge when it came to money, especially when the amount was significant. 
"Miss Ono, it’s not that we don’t want to help, but we also run small businesses and have many people to support." 
"Right, Miss Ono, we really are..." 
"It’s alright. How about this? I’ll exchange this for it—the ring!" Without waiting for a response, she started undoing her necklace and took off the ring that she had been wearing for a very long time. 
It was a gold ring with a jade setting, not large, but both the carving and the crystal clear green jade in the center indicated that the ring was quite valuable. 
On seeing it, the Japanese woman Ono Yoshiko immediately shook her head, wanting to refuse. 
However, the Japanese man beside her, upon seeing it, suddenly had a gleam in his eyes... 
This item was quality goods. If taken to a jewelry store, wouldn’t it cover much more than these medical expenses? 
So, without another word, he took out his wallet, "Alright, today I’ll front the medical expenses for you, and you can take the ring back when your family arrives." 
Although he spoke graciously, Ye Ning could tell from the look in his eyes that once she gave the ring away today, it would never come back. 
So, she said nothing, took another look at the ring, accepted his money, and went to make the payment. 
After paying, the doctor immediately arranged for the transfusion of blood plasma, so Ye Ning began the agonizing wait in the hallway again—and this wait was another two hours. 
Two hours later, the sky had turned completely dark. A casual look out the window at the small village, far from the bustling city, revealed nothing but pitch blackness, complemented by the undulating choruses of unidentifiable insects.
###Chapter 347: Chapter 347 She Has Never Been So Happy
Two hours later, those two Japanese people left as well, but before she left, Ono Yoshiko gave her phone number to Ye Ning and told her to contact her if there was anything she needed, while the Japanese man left even faster than a rabbit. 
Ye Ning watched them go with a wry smile... 
Actually, he didn’t have to run; whatever she had traded away, she had no intention of taking it back. 
Fortunately, two hours later, the door to the emergency room finally opened, and Ye Ning quickly stood up from her chair, "Doctor, how is he?" 
"The surgery was very successful, and he should be fine once he wakes up tonight." 
The doctor saw that she was still alone in the hallway so late, and a flicker of pity crossed his eyes. 
But Ye Ning didn’t notice this; her every thought was on the man at present, and upon hearing the surgery was successful, she was suddenly overwhelmed with euphoria and rushed over to the gurney that was being wheeled out, bending over, she stood still, "That’s wonderful, Ou Mucen, you’re finally okay!" 
She had never been so overjoyed, at least, not in these five years. 
Bowing her head to see the man still unconscious from the anesthesia lying there, his handsome face frighteningly pale from too much blood loss. But his breathing had truly stabilized, and she could no longer control herself. Clutching his hand, her tears just poured out, splashing down. 
It was a total release after narrowly escaping death, for him, and for herself. 
Ou Mucen, it’s so good you’re alive! 
Having been brought out of the emergency room, Mucen, still unconscious, was wheeled into the only ward of this medical station. noveldrama
"This is just a small medical station; we’re not qualified to admit patients for overnight stays, so this is where you’ll have to stay tonight." 
"It’s okay, really, thank you so much, Doctor." 
Ye Ning stood sincerely in front of the very young Japanese doctor, her eyes filled with gratitude toward him. 
Yes, it was only later that Ono Yoshiko told her that in Japan, small medical stations like theirs didn’t even have the qualifications to perform surgeries; they were not allowed to according to regulations. 
It was the doctor, seeing the urgency of the situation and knowing there was no time to transfer, who risked being disciplined to operate on Ou Mucen. 
However, this doctor, faced with her gratitude, just smiled, "Saving lives is the duty of a doctor. You don’t need to thank me. By the way, there’s no one on duty here overnight; you’ll have to pay extra attention to him. Do you know how to change IV fluids when the drip finishes?" 
"I do!" 
"Good, he might have a bit of a fever tonight, but you don’t need to worry; it’s normal. Just use a towel to cool him down and use a cotton swab to moisten his lips when needed." 
"..." 
The doctor was very thorough in his instructions, as if he feared she wouldn’t manage well. 
But in fact, from the moment he began speaking, Ye Ning had already silently memorized every word; she had an excellent memory and would remember clearly anything she intended to not forget. 
After giving his instructions, the doctor left, but before leaving, seeing that she hadn’t eaten, he went to his office and brought back a cup of instant noodles for her. 
Ye Ning was, of course, extremely thankful! 
She really was hungry; since having that small breakfast in the morning, she hadn’t even had a sip of water. 
So, after the doctor left, she immediately went to the faucet to wash her face and then opened the cup of noodles to look for hot water...
###Chapter 348: Chapter 348 She Never Thought of Hurting Him
After preparing the noodles, she ate them over there before coming over to watch by the sickbed. 
He was very quiet, lying there—it was the quietest she had ever seen him since she met him. 
He wasn’t pointing his fingers and telling her what to do like a tyrant, nor was he swearing at her with the most vicious and vile words; at this moment, he was lying there, truly as quiet as a child. 
But, while he was this quiet, she couldn’t feel happy; instead, she felt as if needles were pricking her heart, a particularly uncomfortable feeling. 
It was because of her that he had become like this! 
She remembered the list with the name crossed out with a red line, and the way that man had clenched his teeth and shown a horrifyingly ferocious face when he mentioned his name last night. 
Yes, she could now be completely certain that this matter was related to that man—even if not entirely, it was undoubtedly tied to him. 
She sat down in the chair and, seeing that the IV drip was still in place, she took the iodine the doctor had left behind and began to dab it with a cotton swab, intending to clean his other wounds. 
These instructions had been given by the doctor, who probably didn’t have enough hands in the emergency room to treat them. 
Rolling up his sleeve, she saw the two scars on his arm, and the distress in her eyes immediately deepened, "Ou Mucen, I’m sorry, it’s because of me that you ended up like this." 
"..." 
No one answered her; the only responses she received were the "tick-tock" of the clock on the wall of the hospital room and occasionally, from the quiet night outside, the chirping of insects. 
As she listened, she moved the cotton swab toward the wound on his forehead, "If I had known it would come to this, I wouldn’t have come looking for you, Ou Mucen. Although I was using you, I never intended for you to lose your life." 
She dabbed bit by bit, her motions extremely gentle, as if afraid of causing him any pain. 
Yes, she had never thought about him dying! 
She and the Ou Family had too many grudges, too much hate, but it wasn’t him—it was Ou Muyuan, Mei Liping, and their son, Ou Yuze. 
And Ou Mucen had no quarrel with her. 
Her cotton swab went from one scar to the next, cleaning them; the scars were not deep, but there were many of them, on his forehead, arms, legs, and also the most severe one on his chest and abdomen, which was covered by his clothes. 
Ye Ning’s fingers finally stiffened, staring blankly at the area heavily wrapped in gauze, her hand holding the cotton swab began to turn white... 
Ou Mucen, rest assured, from now on, I will not let you fall into such danger again. 
I will leave you and go far away, having nothing more to do with you, that way, you’ll be safe....noveldrama
—— 
La Chenxi was still looking for people, but to her despair, she still had no news of him. 
It was not until she went to the water delivery company and heard from the boss that when Ou Mucen had gone there, he had taken a woman with him. 
The woman, according to his description, she realized, was the little assistant who had been causing trouble with him these past few days; it was as if she finally remembered something and immediately headed towards the Tokyo Hotel. 
At meanwhile, inside the presidential suite of the Tokyo Hotel, Lin Yebai had also sensed something was amiss. 
"Did you call to confirm? Aning really didn’t go back?"
###Chapter 349: Chapter 349 Where Exactly is An Ning?
"No, I checked with the flight information. She didn’t board that flight at all!" 
She didn’t board the flight? 
She didn’t board the flight... 
Suddenly, his fingers trembled slightly, and a very bad premonition arose from deep within his heart. 
It was at that moment, someone outside rang the doorbell... 
"Ding-dong—" 
Who would come looking for him at this time? 
He glanced at the time and looked suspiciously at Xiaojin, who quickly indicated that he didn’t know either. 
Seeing this, Lin Yebai pondered for a moment before finally deciding to have him open the door. 
"Mr. Lin, hello, I am the daughter of the diplomat La Shiwen, my name is La Chenxi," 
"..." 
La Chenxi? 
Lin Yebai looked at the beautiful woman who had come in, somewhat surprised, "So you’re the young miss of the La family, we’ve met before." 
La Chenxi smiled, "Yes, we met yesterday at the dress shop. I’m sorry to trouble you, Mr. Lin, but I came here to ask about your apprentice, Miss An Ning. Is she here?" 
An Ning? 
Upon hearing this, Lin Yebai’s expression finally began to change, "Miss La is looking for her?" 
"Yes, I won’t hide it from you, Mr. Lin. My friend, Mr. Ou Mucen, has gone missing, and before he disappeared, someone saw Miss An Ning with him just four hours ago. So, I want to ask, where exactly is Miss An Ning?" 
"..." 
Standing there, Lin Yebai stared at the woman who had suddenly appeared. For at least a dozen seconds, he was stunned. 
What was she talking about? 
Aning was with that man? 
How could that be possible? Wasn’t she supposed to have gone to the airport? Why was she with that man again? 
His mind began to buzz, and overcome by a huge sense of panic at the bottom of his heart, he started to tremble uncontrollably. 
If what she was saying was true, then the situation was truly unimaginable... 
Xiaojin was also shocked by her words and wanted to ask how she had seen it. But a glance at his master’s bad state made him quickly change his mind, rushing forward to block the woman at the door. 
"Miss La, I’m sorry, but our Miss An has returned to her country." 
"Returned to her country?" 
La Chenxi was shocked, "How could she have returned to her country? That person clearly saw..." 
"He must have been mistaken. Our Miss An’s flight took off at eleven in the morning. If Miss La doesn’t believe it, you can check the flight information." 
"This..." La Chenxi was immediately at a loss for words. 
She returned to her country in the morning? 
How could that be possible? It was well past eleven when Ou Mucen went to the water company. Could it be that they were mistaken? noveldrama
La Chenxi was very doubtful, but by then, the man had already made it clear he wanted her to leave. 
Seeing this, she had no choice but to leave dejectedly. 
As soon as La Chenxi left, the man in the suite could no longer hold himself up. He staggered, and had there not been a chair nearby to support him, he would have almost collapsed to the floor. 
"Master—" 
Xiaojin saw this and hurried over, "Master, are you alright? Don’t worry about this matter... maybe what the woman said isn’t true." 
Lin Yebai shook his head, his face ashen, "No, what she said, it’s all true." 
"Then..." 
Xiaojin suddenly didn’t dare to speak anymore. 
All of it was true, such a terrifying thing. 
If it were true, then it was very likely that the woman already knew about the switch...
###Chapter 350: Chapter 350 He Has a Fever
After she discovered the switching incident, with her intelligence, she must have guessed that the matter was something her husband would do, which is why she disappeared suddenly at the time of boarding, to go help Ou Mucen. 
But now, while they were trying to resolve the issue, they had directly notified Ou Mucen, so the news about Ou Mucen having gone missing that the woman had just come in to tell... noveldrama
Xiaojin suddenly turned completely pale, "Sir, if that’s the case, if Aning is with Ou Mucen, isn’t she... isn’t she..." 
"Go find them now!!!" 
He finally lost his temper, like a beast driven to desperation, erupting in a roar; the chair he was holding in his hand was flung onto the ground, breaking into several pieces. 
Xiaojin was frightened, not daring to say another word, he turned and ran out as if flying. 
It was terrifying; it was the first time he had ever seen the sir erupt in such intense anger! 
But after she ran out, because she was in too much of a rush and panic, she failed to notice two figures, one tall and one short, that appeared beside her... 
"See that? I told you they were up to something." 
"What do we do now?" 
"Naturally, we find someone to follow them!" the taller one said with a cold laugh, and set off following. 
The shorter one beside him, who seemed rather slender, hesitated for a moment but then quickly followed suit... 
—— 
Ye Ning, after helping Ou Mucen to change his IV, couldn’t hold on any longer and ended up falling asleep at the edge of his bed. 
She was too tired, after all the turmoil of the day and the severe car accident she had just experienced. 
Asleep in a daze, she didn’t know how long she had been asleep when she was woken up by heavy breathing and intermittent moaning. 
"Water... water..." 
Water? 
Hearing this, Ye Ning immediately opened her eyes, "Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen, are you awake?" 
"Water..." 
"..." 
He didn’t answer her question, just kept intermittently saying that word, and his breathing sounded heavy and uncomfortable. 
Was he starting to run a fever? 
Ye Ning remembered the doctor’s instructions before he left; her sleepiness vanished completely, she stood up from the chair, bent over, and felt his forehead. 
It was indeed a bit hot! 
Remembering what the doctor had said, that this kind of fever wasn’t serious, she didn’t panic. Opening the bottle of alcohol that the doctor had left behind, she began to use a cotton swab to cool him down. 
"Water..." 
He was still asking for water, but he had just had surgery and couldn’t consume anything at all, including water. 
Ye Ning stared at his parched lips for a moment, then finally, she poured a cup of warm water, dipped a cotton swab into it, and began to meticulously moisten his lips. 
"Mmm..." Perhaps finally feeling the cooling moisture, the moaning man finally quieted down for a moment. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning was greatly relieved. She felt a bit of soreness in her waist from standing, so she decided to kneel on one knee on his bed and started to lean over his face, wholeheartedly moistening his lips. 
His features were truly beautiful, like the stars in the nighttime sky, noble and splendid, with perfectly curved closed eyelids, revealing a perfectly contoured eye within his thick and slightly curled eyelashes, a high nose, and fair skin. Even as he lay there quietly, there was a faint sense of lofty pride in his eyes. 
Ye Ning was mesmerized and, unwittingly, the cotton swab in her hand remained on his lips...
###Chapter 351: Chapter 351: Even in a Coma, He Worries About Her Safety
"An Ning..." 
"Ah?" 
"Jump down!" 
Ah? 
Jump down? Jump where? 
Ye Ning shuddered at that moment, and it was then that she realized that this man’s eyes had somehow opened at some point, and right now, they were staring straight at her. 
Oh my God! 
Was he trying to scare her to death on purpose? 
The woman who had been bending over and staring at his face for quite a while saw this and felt as if something exploded inside her head with a "pop." The next second, she rolled off the sickbed. 
"Ou Mucen, you... you... Why didn’t you say anything when you woke up?" 
"..." 
She rolled off, caught red-handed doing something "naughty," too embarrassed to lift her head, so she just stood there pointing at him, with an expression that couldn’t be more awkward. 
But to her surprise, after she spoke, there was no response from the sickbed, as if he hadn’t heard her at all. 
What was he doing? 
Could it be that he was angry again? So angry that he couldn’t even speak? 
Thinking of his temper, she began to sweat more in her palms. 
Was the teasing over? 
She had been watching him all the time, without even blinking. If he had seen her, with his temper and his dislike for people staring at him, he would definitely kill her.
Ye Ning began not to dare to let out a breath... 
Yet, to her confusion, she stood there for a long time and still didn’t hear him speak. Instead, the hospital room soon filled with the sound of even breathing once more. 
What was going on? noveldrama
Ye Ning finally felt something was off, looked up towards the sickbed, and discovered that the man had fallen asleep again. 
Damn! 
What on earth was he doing? 
She became a little frantic, walked over, and saw that he was indeed motionless with his eyes closed, as if his waking had been just an illusion. 
"Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen?" 
"..." 
"Ou Mucen, are you awake?" 
"..." 
After calling a few times and getting no response, Ye Ning blinked, stared at him for a good while, and finally confirmed that he had indeed passed out. 
So what was that about just now? 
Could it be... his fever had confused him, causing him to open his eyes unconsciously? 
And in his unconsciousness, he called out her name, and told her to jump down. Could it have been something lingering in his mind from when they were in a car accident explosion, the moment when he was desperately pulling her to jump into the sea? 
Standing there, she looked at the man sleeping under the faint light and felt as if something was stuck in her heart, making her feel even more uncomfortable... 
After this little episode, for the rest of the night, Ou Mucen didn’t cause any more trouble but became calm as the doctor had said, after the low fever subsided. 
It wasn’t until daybreak that he finally woke up. 
When he awoke, Ye Ning was still sleeping with her head rested on the edge of his bed, so when he opened his eyes, he saw the small head resting like a little puppy on the edge of his bed in the shallow morning light. 
It really was like the little Samoyed they had kept in the Bamboo Garden, fluffy and always liking to lie by his side like that whenever he visited. 
PS: Sorry, the first Chapter I updated today was the unedited content. My apologies, it has been corrected, and you can go back to take a look. Because it was a bit rushed, the fourth Chapter is updated now, kisses...
###Chapter 352: Chapter 352 He Woke Up...
The only difference was that from this angle, her face was much more pleasing to the eye than the little Samoyed’s. 
Her jet-black and supple short hair, as she lay there, a few strands fell along her cheeks, covering her lips, but her plump forehead and her elegant and delicate eyelids, in the light of early morning as sheer as gauze, emitted a luster akin to jade. 
Ou Mucen moved slightly, unable to control himself, he wanted to touch that gloss. noveldrama
But just as his hand began to move, the tightly closed eyelids beneath that hair were astonishingly alert. He only saw her dense, long eyelashes quiver like butterfly wings for a moment before her eyelids opened up, "Ou Mucen, you’re finally awake?" 
The moment her eyes opened and she saw him awake, there was nothing but a glow of surprise in her pupil-like glaze. 
Ou Mucen’s fingers stiffened and immediately dropped as if electrified! 
"Yes, I’m awake..." 
"Good, good you’re awake. Wait here, I’ll go call the doctor." Without caring about her just-awakened state, unwashed face or unbrushed teeth, she hurried off to find the doctor with her sleepy and tousled look. 
Ou Mucen was stunned for a moment before he slowly came to terms with his surroundings. 
Apparently, he was in a hospital. 
Had she admitted him yesterday? But near that place before he lost consciousness yesterday, it seemed like there were no signs of habitation, so how could there be a hospital? 
He began to look around and noticed that the so-called sickroom was quite simplistic, with the walls sporting a grimy white and the lamp being a mere ordinary incandescent tube, not to mention how plain and worn the bed and chair were. 
It seemed that this was not a regular hospital, then what place was this... 
He was somewhat puzzled... 
Right at that moment, Ye Ning brought the Japanese doctor in; as soon as the doctor entered and saw him lying on the bed, her excitement turned towards the doctor, "Doctor, look, he really is awake." 
"Hmm, let me check on him." 
The young doctor who had come in was also very glad to see Ou Mucen awake. After agreeing, he came over to examine him. 
Ou Mucen, still not knowing where he was or what had happened to him last night, naturally furrowed his brow and asked, "What happened to me?" 
"Your spleen ruptured, and this doctor operated on you last night," answered Ye Ning quickly, replacing the doctor’s response. 
Spleen ruptured? 
Ou Mucen too was startled upon hearing those words! 
So the discomfort he had felt all day yesterday was due to a ruptured spleen? No wonder he was increasingly in agony; it turned out the impact was that severe. 
After listening to his heartbeat and taking his blood, the doctor looked over the wound on his chest and abdomen and finally gave them some reassuring news, "There’s basically no danger now. In the coming time, you need to recuperate properly. What are your plans?" 
Plans? 
Ye Ning looked towards the man still lying in the bed... 
She understood what the doctor meant, of course. This was a small medical station that couldn’t accommodate inpatients. If they stayed, it might cause him trouble. 
But if they were to leave, then they would have to travel back to Tokyo, and with this man just coming to, would the long journey be too difficult for him?
###Chapter 353: Chapter 353 Temporarily Unable to Leave
Ye Ning’s face showed a look of difficulty, "Doctor, I won’t lie to you, we came from Tokyo, and if we need to return, we can only go to Tokyo." 
"Return to Tokyo? That’s not possible, it’s a bit far, and it’s not very good for him." 
The doctor indeed rejected her immediately. 
Hearing this, Ye Ning quickly seized the opportunity to speak, "Then since that’s the case, we have nowhere to go now. I don’t know if the doctor has any good suggestions?" 
"This..." 
"Don’t worry, we won’t stay long. We’ll leave as soon as his wound stabilizes. If you’re worried about it being discovered, that’s okay, we can move to another place, just waiting for a day or two should be enough." 
Ye Ning noticed the young doctor’s hesitation, so she quickly added another sentence. 
Indeed, it didn’t matter where they stayed. What was most important was that Ou Mucen could have some time to recover here. 
The doctor stood there, thinking for a long, long time. In the end, he agreed, but to avoid causing trouble for the medical station, he had Ye Ning and Ou Mucen move to a room behind the medical station. That way, even if someone discovered them, it wouldn’t bring any trouble to the medical station. 
After hearing this, Ye Ning was of course very happy, and she immediately thanked the doctor profusely. 
Ou Mucen had been quietly watching the two of them. He had just woken up and did not yet know what had happened, but after listening to their conversation, he slowly began to understand. 
It turned out they had been rescued by a very remote small medical station, and at the moment, because the medical station did not have the qualifications for hospitalization, the doctor wanted to send them away. 
Watching this woman beg the doctor in such a low manner, a fire suddenly surged in his heart, and he strongly wanted to say that if they were unwelcome, they would leave right away. 
However, when he saw the light of joy shining in her eyes after hearing the doctor’s agreement, the anger that had reached his lips was swallowed back down. 
After agreeing to let the two of them stay in the back room, the doctor left. Ye Ning then turned around and came back to him. 
"Third Young Master, I’m sorry, this place is a bit simple, but since you just woke up from surgery, it’s not convenient to go back to Tokyo. We’ll move to that room in the back, you... don’t have any ions, right?" 
While saying this, Ye Ning’s tone was always very careful, as if she was afraid the man would disagree. 
There was no helping it, the man in front of her was born with a golden key, a favored son of heaven who had never lived in such poor conditions since childhood. 
Ou Mucen looked at her indifferently, "How did you find this place?" 
Ye Ning quickly looked up, "I encountered two Japanese people on the road, and they brought us here." 
"Japanese people?" 
"Yes, they were going to a performance and happened to pass by where you had collapsed. They saw you in distress and brought you here." 
Speaking of this, Ye Ning actually felt a bit scared. If those two Japanese people hadn’t appeared at that time, she really couldn’t imagine what might have happened. The doctor said that if they had come any later yesterday, he could have been in mortal danger due to the amount of blood he lost. 
After hearing that it was Japanese people who had helped her bring him here, Ou Mucen finally stopped talking and gave a faint "hmm," accepting her decision. noveldrama
Seeing this, Ye Ning was overjoyed. Right away, she went to call a nurse from the medical station, and the two of them together pushed him to the small room behind the medical station.
###Chapter 354: Chapter 354: Deceiving Her, What an Easy Thing It Is
The small cabin was actually not any different from other places; it was just the area where the medical station used to store medications. However, since the space was fairly decent, there was one empty room that was left unused. 
After Ye Ning brought him here, she immediately prepared to make a phone call, "You just lie here and rest, I’ll call Secretary Gao and have him come over quickly." 
Secretary Gao? 
Why call him? 
The man who had just been moved here and was still adapting to the new environment, upon hearing this, a flicker of light passed through his pale, handsome face, "Why are you calling him?" 
"To come and pick you up, of course. We don’t have a car or money here, and once you’re able to leave, we’d have no way to get out." 
Is that so? 
Ou Mucen glanced at the bright and peaceful scenery outside the window, and suddenly, without even thinking, he refused, "Don’t call yet!" 
Huh? 
Don’t call? 
Ye Ning stood at the door, looking at him in surprise, "Why not? Aren’t we going to notify him?" 
"Have you forgotten how we ended up here? Someone is trying to kill me right now. If you call Gao Ziyang at this moment, I’m afraid he won’t arrive before those people do!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Is it really that serious? Just making a phone call can bring those people here? Isn’t that terrifying? 
Ye Ning started to hesitate, "But if we don’t call him, then how will you get back once your condition is stable?" 
"We’ll talk about that when the time comes!" After dropping these cold words, the man didn’t say anything else. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning didn’t dare to say anything further... 
This man was no ordinary man; he was the leader of the Ou Group, able to command such a vast business empire; he certainly had his methods and capabilities. 
So, at this moment, whatever he said, she would not doubt, and she would obey his decisions. 
Having decided not to make the call, Ye Ning immediately left the small cabin and went to the medical station in front to get medication and intravenous fluids from the nurse. Now that they had moved here, they had to take care of everything themselves. 
Fortunately, the nurse, having been reminded by the Japanese doctor, was quite amiable to her. When Ye Ning said she came to get medications and IV fluids, the nurse immediately handed them to her. 
"Today’s main treatment is still anti-inflammatory; you’ll need to hang an IV drip in the morning and afternoon, and you’ll also need to take medicine three times." 
"Okay!" noveldrama
"Additionally, after the patient passes gas today, he can start eating. Starting with some porridge is advisable, as it will aid his recovery." 
Passing gas? 
What is "passing gas"? 
Ye Ning was a bit confused until the nurse told her passing gas meant farting. Only then did she understand and immediately, her face turned red... 
Damn! 
How would she know if he had passed gas or not? Was she supposed to ask him about such things? 
Ye Ning felt a deep sense of despair. 
"What’s the matter?" 
"Nothing... It’s nothing?" 
"Alright then, take these back with you. Later, I’ll send some simple kitchenware as well as rice and flour to your place. Don’t worry about it." The nurse was busy, so after these few words with Ye Ning, she rushed off to tend to other patients. 
Ye Ning, with a flushed face and ears, took the medications and IV fluids and left. 
Returning from the medical station, she entered the small cabin and found the man who was previously awake, was now asleep again. She put down the things she was carrying, and began to look for a towel and some water, planning to clean the room first.
###Chapter 355: Chapter 355: She stared at him like a hungry wolf!
He was a man with a penchant for cleanliness, and upon entering, he had already felt a sense of disgust for this place. Since that was the case, she decided to clean the room while he was sleeping. 
So, while he slept, she began to clean up the room. 
After cleaning, right on time, the nurse had someone bring over some rice, flour-based food, an induction cooker, and some simple cooking utensils. 
Ye Ning hurriedly took them, thanked the person, and went to make some congee for him. 
Never mind whether he had passed gas or not, she would prepare the congee first. 
Making congee was easy for her; she often made it for Xiaobao when he was a child. Since he didn’t like sweets much, she made him sliced meat congee, bone soup congee, fish congee, and more. 
But this man needed liquid food, so she... might as well add some sugar.
Thus, when the congee was ready, she added a spoonful of sugar to it... 
After the congee was done, coughing sounds came from the room. Upon hearing them, she quickly turned off the induction cooker and entered. 
"You’re awake?" 
"Mm, what are you doing?" The man, who had just awakened from sleep, seemed to look better than when he first awoke. Noticing that her hands were wet, he frowned and asked. 
Ye Ning quickly wiped her hands with a paper towel and took off her shoes before coming in. 
"I was making congee for you. The nurse said you could have some liquid food today." As she spoke, she grabbed the IV fluids and medicine that she had just brought over from the table. 
Ou Mucen did not say anything. However, when he saw the two bags of IV fluids she was holding, he reflexively asked, "What are you going to do?" 
Ye Ning took the syringe and needle out: "I’m going to give you an injection!" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
He stared at her, frozen for several seconds, until he finally shuffled back: "No one’s at the medical station?" 
"No one!" Ye Ning nodded seriously: "There are only two nurses at the entire medical station, and they’re so busy they’re about to take off." 
"And then?" 
"The nurse said giving injections is actually very simple. Just aim at your vein and puncture it, and that’s it!" She said, grabbing his large wrist that seemed to want to escape. 
She looked like a wolf that had finally caught its prey! 
Ou Mucen’s eyebrow twitched! noveldrama
"Let go of me!" 
"Don’t worry, I won’t poke around." Without waiting for him to pull back, Ye Ning unceremoniously tied his wrist with a rubber band. 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
In the beginning, he wasn’t very resistant, but now seeing her like this, and sensing the blatant mockery in her eyes, he really wanted to tear her apart every minute. 
Yet, this woman seemed to completely ignore his gaze, and patted his arm where the veins bulged out due to the tight rubber band. In the next second, she swabbed one of his veins with a cotton swab. 
Upon seeing this, Ou Mucen couldn’t control himself any longer: "Be careful!" 
"I am being careful. Look at this one; it’s so prominent." 
"Do you choose a vein based on which one is more prominent for an injection?" 
"Then why else would I use this rubber band to tie you up?" 
"..." 
Grinding his teeth and glaring at her, Ou Mucen, a man who could turn the tables in the business world, found himself at a loss for words! 
Fine, let her give him the injection. If she made a mistake, charge her a month’s salary for each misstep, and see if he wouldn’t deal with her properly!
###Chapter 356: Chapter 356: The Concern in Her Eyes Can’t Fool Anyone
Before he could even fully form the thought, a sudden pain on the back of his hand made him look down. The woman had already plunged the long, thin needle deep into his vein. 
"See? I told you I wouldn’t make a mistake!" Ye Ning saw the needle pierce into his pale skin, and the moment he slightly opened his mouth in response, she immediately loosened the rubber band she was holding. 
She indeed knew how to insert a needle. She had easily mastered this along with other self-help knowledge she had learned. 
However, this man was no ordinary man. He had a terrible temper, moody and unpredictable. If she really angered him, there would be consequences. 
Fortunately, once the needle was in and blood started returning, he didn’t say much. 
He wasn’t afraid of needles; he just didn’t like the idea of entrusting his life to a woman who knew nothing. Unless he was out of his mind. 
But as it turned out, she seemed to know what she was doing, and her technique was quite skilled. 
Ou Mucen watched the woman skillfully secure the medical tape, a flicker of something bright and dark flowing slowly in his pupils. 
"All done. Rest for a while, I’ll go get the porridge I’ve been simmering for you," she said, and then she got up from the ground and left. 
Ou Mucen watched her leave and then quietly lay there for a while. 
After lying down for a bit, perhaps because he had slept too long and his body was sore, he wanted to sit up. So he moved a little, supporting himself with one hand and preparing to rise. 
But just as he lifted half his body, he felt a searing pain in his chest and abdomen, which had him falling straight back down instantly. 
"Bang—" 
The dull thud almost made him pass out on the spot. 
Ye Ning was in the next room preparing his porridge when she heard the noise. Her face changed, "What’s wrong? What happened?" 
In a rush, she burst from the kitchen and quickly entered the room. She was shocked to see him lying stiff on the bed, trembling slightly, with large beads of sweat forming on his face, "What’s wrong with you? Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?" 
Ou Mucen’s vision was blackening as he lay there. It took him a while to regain himself, and then he shook his pale face, "It’s nothing, just moved a little just now..." noveldrama
"Moved a little? Heavens, why would you move? You can’t just move around as you please right now," she said urgently, rushing in from the doorway straight to his side.
"Does it hurt a lot? Should I get the doctor to give you some painkillers?" 
"..." 
Ou Mucen didn’t speak, just broke out in a cold sweat from the pain. 
Seeing this made Ye Ning a bit scared, and she turned to go get the doctor, "No, I’d better go get Dr. Takahashi to have a look..." 
The urgency and concern in her voice sounded as if she feared something bad would happen to him. 
Ou Mucen finally slowly opened his eyes upon hearing her say she was going to get the doctor, and on his sweaty face, he finally spoke, "No need, it’s just the wound was pulled, it’s nothing serious." 
"But you’re in so much pain." 
"It’s fine, go get me a glass of water," he requested. 
Water? 
Reminded by his request, Ye Ning finally remembered and quickly got up to get him water.
###Chapter 357: Chapter 357: The place where they met with an accident has been discovered
He fetched water and incidentally brought the medicine over as well... 
"I was so focused on giving you the injection that I forgot to let you have your medicine," Ye Ning said, carrying the glass of water and the medicine back to his side. "Why not just take the medicine now? It should help with the pain relief." 
Ou Mucen saw it and didn’t refuse. It was at this moment that he drank some water and then took the medicine. The pain in his body finally began to subside. 
Seeing that he was getting better, Ye Ning also felt relieved. She wrung a wet towel for him to wipe himself with and then went back to finish preparing the congee. 
She actually wasn’t very familiar with him. Although they had shared a life-and-death experience this time, in her heart, he was still himself, the aloof young master. He and she were people from two different worlds. How could she possibly take the initiative to wipe his sweat when he was conscious? 
Returning to the room next door, the congee had settled down nicely over a period of time and looked very appetizing. 
So she took a bowl and was about to serve it to him when someone outside called her, "Miss An, are you there?" 
It was the nurse! 
Inside, Ye Ning immediately came out: "Yes, Miss Huizi, what’s the matter?" 
"No big deal, I just finished my shift and was wondering if you wanted me to accompany you to the supermarket to buy some daily necessities?" 
Supermarket? 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s eyes suddenly lit up: "Yes, yes, I just wanted to find this place." 
The nurse smiled: "Then let’s go together, it’s not too far." 
Ye Ning nodded eagerly. She was about to leave directly, but thinking of the man lying in the next room, she turned back and asked, "Mucen, I’m going to the supermarket to buy some daily necessities. Is there anything particular you need?" 
Daily necessities? 
The man lying in bed with an IV drip frowned upon hearing this: "What could they possibly sell here?" 
Ye Ning was stumped! 
Indeed, someone like him who used and wore only high-end custom goods, how would he be interested in the trivial items sold at that kind of place? 
So she ignored him and left the room, putting on her shoes and heading out.
It was only after she left that she learned the doctor had sent the nurse to take her to the supermarket and had even given the nurse some money for her to purchase items. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning was really grateful to the doctor. She took the money and told the nurse that when those who were coming to pick them up arrived, she would definitely pay them back. Moreover, she would ensure their treatment would be better than before. 
This was something the man lying in the room should be able to manage, right? 
The nurse smiled and didn’t make much of it, but she was curious and asked how they had ended up here. 
How did they end up here? 
Ye Ning dared not tell the truth and made up an excuse on the spot: "We just had an accident at sea and drifted here." 
"At sea?" 
"Yes!" 
"That’s really unfortunate. Yesterday, there was an accident in our area as well. On Cherry Blossom Lane, a car smashed through the guardrail and fell down before exploding. They say it was a Ferrari." 
"..." 
A Ferrari? 
How would she know about a Ferrari? 
Ye Ning’s face suddenly changed: "How did you know it was a Ferrari?" noveldrama
The nurse took out her phone: "The news said there were exploded car wreckage at the site, confirmed to be a Ferrari. They suspect it might belong to the CEO of some corporation. It seems to be quite a big deal."
###Chapter 358: Chapter 358 She Can’t Put Him in Danger Anymore
They even found out who the president was? 
Ye Ning remembered the moment she and that man jumped into the sea, and the explosion that had thundered behind them; she couldn’t hold back anymore and snatched the phone from her hand, eagerly looking through it. 
Indeed, as soon as she opened the news, the picture displayed was the site of their car accident. However, on the desolate slope, what she had thought was the car obliterated into pieces, had several large components still there, and among them, half a number plate was most conspicuous. 
My God, it seemed they had truly found it. 
She started to panic, quickly scrolling down to see the description below, and sure enough, there were the words "president of the Ou Group." Decisively, she took the phone and turned around. 
"Miss An? Where are you going? Aren’t we going to the supermarket?" 
Ye Ning waved her phone behind her back: "I need to go back first, I forgot to take something. Miss Huizi, you go ahead." 
No sooner had she finished speaking than she rushed back toward the cabin. 
Being discovered by the police was not a good thing at all. The person who made the move was Lin Yebai, and with his shrewdness, knowing about this car and seeing the news that Ou Mucen might still be alive, he would definitely find him. 
Therefore, the priority was to find him immediately and come up with a plan. Only then would he be out of danger. 
Ye Ning ran as fast as she could... 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, who was recovering inside the house, had borrowed the doctor’s phone, who had come to check on him after finishing work, and was in contact with his high secretary who was frantically searching for him in Tokyo. 
"Third Young Master, where on earth are you? I’m... I’m freaking out..." 
As soon as the phone connected, the man on the other end began to cry pathetically. 
Ou Mucen felt a wave of disgust wash over him and without touching the phone any further, he placed it at least two hand spans away: "What are you crying for? I’m not dead yet." 
Yes, yes, I know you’re not dead, but couldn’t you at least send a single call? A text message? 
The high secretary also wanted to curse, but he ended up laughing through his tears instead: "I’m just too excited, Third Young Master. You have no idea how I’ve almost turned Tokyo upside down since yesterday looking for you. Where were you yesterday? Was that Ferrari really yours?" 
"Yes!" 
Ou Mucen had also just seen that piece of news, so he knew what he was talking about. 
After nodding his head, he didn’t bother hiding anything and recounted the events of the previous day, which almost scared the high secretary to death. 
"A murder attempt? You mean... someone tried to kill you yesterday? My God, who could it be? Who would dare to attempt your life?" 
Who could it be? 
The man gripping the phone remembered the blocked phone from yesterday and the red Range Rovers that had cornered him, and a cold, bloodthirsty smirk slowly spread across his lips: "Don’t worry, I’ll make him come out on his own." 
"You mean..." 
"Go tell the Japanese police that Ou Mucen is already dead. When you do it, it’s best to bring along a few of the larger media outlets." 
High secretary: "..." 
But why? Why would he announce to the world that he was dead? noveldrama
Didn’t he realize that this would have a significant impact on the Ou Group? And what about the old master and the lady? If they found out he was "dead," it would kill them.
###Chapter 359: Chapter 359: Ou Mucen, Shall We Go Back to Tokyo?
But before he could even ask, from outside, on the phone, it seemed someone was calling for him, "Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen, there’s trouble, your car was found." 
That voice... was it An Ning? 
Shit! 
That woman was actually together with him! 
Secretary Gao’s mouth was agape, and it was at this moment, she heard the person on the phone hurriedly say, "Transfer some money to this phone." Then, the call was disconnected. 
Beep beep beep beep... 
No, what do you mean, President? 
Secretary Gao was completely dazed by the sudden turn of events! 
---- 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, after bringing in that phone, hurriedly made her way to the room, "Ou Mucen, did you fall asleep again?" 
Ou Mucen lazily opened his eyes to look at her, and after a long while, he replied without any expression, "Do you sleep when you get an injection?" noveldrama
Ye Ning: "..." 
Can’t you sleep while getting an injection? 
Every time she got an injection, she slept quite well. 
Ye Ning knelt beside him and didn’t argue about it anymore. She took out the phone and handed it over, "Ou Mucen, that car of yours that was blown up, they’ve found it." 
Really? 
Ou Mucen looked at the phone in her hand, not very surprised, "Where did you get the phone from?" 
Why ask that? 
Ye Ning grew impatient with his unrelated question, "I borrowed it from the nurse. On my way here, the nurse mentioned this news to me, and that’s when I realized, and I immediately came back to tell you." 
"Tell me for what? With such a big incident, it was bound to be discovered sooner or later." He finally returned to normal. 
Ye Ning became anxious, "But they’ve also found out about your identity." 
"So what?" 
"Knowing about you means they’re about to find us soon, don’t you get it? Weren’t we supposed to prevent outsiders from knowing you’re still alive? You even forbade me from calling Secretary Gao, all to prevent those people from finding out you’re here. Now, Japan’s police are looking for you; doesn’t that make it even easier for those chasing you to find out?" 
Ye Ning was indeed anxious, her goal, probably, was to instill a sense of urgency in him, to make him come up with a strategy quickly. 
After all, if they didn’t leave soon, and the person wanting to kill him found out he was still alive and right here, it would be extremely dangerous. 
But upon hearing her say this, Ou Mucen suddenly felt cornered! 
Not let her call Secretary Gao? 
Yes, he had indeed asked her not to call this morning, but the reason was not remotely this! 
He had just called him himself. 
And the reason for not letting her call was... 
"Ou Mucen, we better leave here quickly." 
"What did you say?" 
"Go back to Tokyo, find Secretary Gao. It’s only safe for you if you go back." Ye Ning was somewhat impatient, as if she was afraid he would refuse. 
True, keeping him here was initially for the sake of his health, but now, compared to his life, she would rather have him go back to Tokyo. 
Ou Mucen fell silent, staring at her, his gaze deep and penetrating as if trying to see right through her. 
She was acting a bit strange, a little too agitated, and there was a hint of panic... hidden deep in her eyes. 
He suddenly remembered the scene from yesterday on the overpass, her with a suitcase, carrying a small bag, just standing there.
###Chapter 360: Chapter 360: That day, she turned back from the airport
Yesterday, because he had urgent matters and on top of that, the party the night before had vexed him enough, he didn’t bother thinking about talking to her at all, so he didn’t ask her. 
So yesterday, when she was standing there with her luggage, what exactly was she going to do? And why was she on the high-rise bridge? 
Ou Mucen’s eyes finally started to darken, "How did you know about my accident yesterday?" 
Huh? 
Yesterday? 
Ye Ning was startled by his very sudden question, "Are you talking about... the time when your exhibition piece was swapped out?" 
Ou Mucen nodded, "Right, I remember you didn’t seem to be at the exhibition." 
"Mm, I didn’t go. At that time... I went to the airport," Ye Ning lowered her head, somewhat afraid to meet his gaze. 
This issue, she had long guessed would raise his suspicions. A woman alone, carrying a suitcase on a high-price bridge, anyone would find that questionable. 
Ye Ning didn’t dare to look up at him, so instead, she looked down at her knees, her fingers occasionally twisting her clothes. 
"The airport?" 
"Mm, I was... prepared to return to my country then, the eleven o’clock plane. It was later, while I was in the departure lounge, that I saw on Weibo the exhibition was delayed, then there was news that something went wrong with your Yuzhirun’s exhibit, and then... I came back," she said. 
This time she didn’t conceal anything and relayed everything that had happened. Perhaps it was because she felt that, with this man’s intelligence, there was no use in hiding; he would find out sooner or later anyway. 
So she might as well come clean about it herself. 
However, she did conceal one thing, and that was the real reason she knew he had had an accident. 
The Weibo responses at the time, an internal message spoke of a pair of jade bracelets but did not mention Ou’s Yuzhirun; however, she linked it to the Jade Bracelet after seeing that pair, recalling the list Lin Yebai had left in the suite, along with the mark he had made under Yuzhirun’s name. That’s when she thought it was his. 
Thus, she had to keep that secret because with his intelligence, seeing that she guessed it was his upon seeing a pair of Jade Bracelets, he would definitely relate the incident to Lin Yebai. 
And Lin Yebai, she hadn’t considered harming him. noveldrama
As her words fell, the man lying in bed, hearing that she rushed back after seeing the news on Weibo, truly held no suspicions. 
Not only did he not suspect her, but also, upon hearing that she was about to board her flight yet she chose to come back to help him after learning of his trouble, a strange emotion surged through him. His look at her softened compared to how sharp it was before. 
"This is a trap. The exchange of the exhibit was just a bait to lure me in," he said. 
"What?" 
Ye Ning looked up at him, her face turning unusually pale, "Are you saying... that the person’s goal was to kill you all along?" 
Ou Mucen nodded, "Actually, there’s another thing I haven’t told you. My phone was blocked when we had the accident. That is to say, the moment I left Tokyo, I was completely out of contact with everyone!" 
!!!!!!! 
It was as if something exploded in her mind. Ye Ning sat there dazed, the blood in her body seeming to stop flowing, her complexion extremely pale. 
So, the truth was like this! 
So, his real intent had been to kill him all along. 
Why?
###Chapter 361: Chapter 361: Who did you say was the one trying to kill me that day?
Why would he do such a thing? Just because he was humiliated in front of everybody the night before yesterday? 
Or was it because... he felt there was something between her and him? So he felt he must kill him? But there was nothing between her and him, so why would he be so cruel? 
She eventually began to tremble slightly, her face turning as pale as a corpse... 
Ou Mucen didn’t know what she was thinking, but seeing her in that state, he was somewhat surprised, "What’s wrong with you?" 
"It’s... it’s nothing, I just think that the person who wants to kill you is too terrifying, with such deep and calculated schemes," Ye Ning stammered back, the terror in her heart causing her fingers to dig deep into her flesh.
It was truly a fate worse than death! 
Ou Mucen frowned slightly. He wanted to say something more, but when he saw her hands intertwined, even her knuckles trembling slightly, his eyes narrowed slightly, and eventually, he restrained himself from speaking, not bearing to do so. 
Had he frightened her? 
That’s right, she was just a woman, and no matter how complex her background, she wouldn’t be that courageous. 
So, unusually for him, he began to comfort her, "You don’t have to worry so much, I, Ou Mucen, am not someone they can kill just because they want to." 
"Uh huh..." Ye Ning responded dully. 
Ou Mucen, seeing her soulless demeanor, thought she was really scared by what he said and couldn’t help feeling a bit regretful for telling her. 
He looked out the window, seeing the bright sunshine and the gentle breeze, and thought about what she was supposed to do before, and suddenly, he was struck by an idea, "Weren’t you going to go shopping with that nurse? Why don’t you go?" 
Ah? 
"Oh!" 
Ye Ning finally snapped back to reality and then, after agreeing, stood up from beside his bed and at last, went out again. 
True, she had made plans with the nurse to buy some necessities, but at this moment, how could she be in the mood for that? Her mind was already in utter chaos, and she couldn’t even maintain the most basic calm. 
What to do? 
If what he said was true, then all this was designed from the very beginning. 
The Jade Bracelet was switched, and as a crucial opportunity for Yuzhirun, he naturally went to find it. And his departure from Tokyo would be the best timing for an attack. 
She remembered they had caught up with the Porsche only after leaving Tokyo, and suddenly, she felt darkness descending over her head, and her legs gave way, causing her to squat at the entrance of the medical station. 
This was a feeling of terror! 
In the past, she knew that Lin Yebai’s business wasn’t ordinary, but she seldom saw the extreme measures he took. 
Her impression of him was mostly that of a cultured businessman. He was gentle, elegant, composed, and indifferent, like a gentleman. In every action he took, every decision he made, he was a role model within the business circles. 
In her mind, he was also perfect and beyond reproach. 
But today, he showed her his most ruthless side. To kill a person, he would set up such an elaborate trap. 
And what was most terrifying was his motive, which was merely his suspicion and his pride! 
So what should she do now? 
Should she leave this place immediately? Leave that man? noveldrama
Only by leaving him, Lin Yebai wouldn’t continue to harm him, right? He wouldn’t be in danger anymore, would he? Is that right?
###Chapter 362: Chapter 362 Miss An, take good care of your husband
She remembered that night, the way he had spoken about her relationship with this man, his expression so foreign and terrifying, that she abruptly hugged her knees feeling an even greater chill enveloping her body... 
As she sat there in a daze, the Nurse who had gone with her to the village suddenly came back. 
Seeing her waiting at the medical station’s entrance, the Nurse approached with surprise: "Miss An, what happened to you? Why are you squatting here?" 
Ye Ning was startled for a moment before she finally lifted her head: "You’ve come back?" 
The Nurse nodded: "Yes, I’m back. I waited for you for quite a while, but when you didn’t show up, I went by myself. Look, I brought some of the things we use regularly. Do you think they’re suitable?" 
Having said that, the Nurse handed over the small basket she was carrying. 
Ye Ning looked down and saw that it contained towels, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and the like, and she quickly nodded: "Suitable, very suitable, thank you." 
"No problem. Oh, and here’s this vase." 
"A vase?" 
"Yes, it’s for your flowers. The room you’re staying in is seldom occupied, and the air isn’t great. If you pick some flowers from around here to put in it, the air will be much better." The Nurse truly was a thoughtful girl, even considering something like this. 
Seeing the vase, Ye Ning took the glass bottle from her hands, and after letting her bring the other items in, she took the vase to pick flowers nearby. noveldrama
Well, if she indeed decided to leave, these flowers would serve as a memento. 
Carrying the vase, she continued on her way... 
She reached the path leading to the village and saw a stream beside it. The river was flowing quietly and distinctly clear in the heat of summer, wafting a pure freshness that could be sensed from afar. 
This place really was beautiful, untouched by pollution or chaos, having only the purity of nature, and the lovely landscapes under a tranquil and sunny sky. 
Upon reaching the riverbank, she saw a plant with small purple flowers and bent down, intending to pluck some. 
But at that moment, a Japanese woman in a kimono, clutching a small wooden box, hurried along the path. Seeing her heading to the riverbank to pick flowers, the woman looked worried: "Be careful!" 
Ye Ning turned her head and saw the woman! 
"Miss Hezi?!!" 
"Miss An, it’s you!" 
Unexpectedly, this woman was Ono Yoshiko, the Japanese woman who had brought them here yesterday. 
Ye Ning immediately stood up, abandoning the idea of picking the flowers, and looked at her with surprise: "Miss Hezi, what brings you here today? Weren’t you supposed to be performing outside?" 
"The performance is already finished. Today I came back to rest." 
Ono Yoshiko still couldn’t speak English, but from her hand gestures, one could vaguely understand what she was trying to say. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning finally understood: "Miss Hezi, you are from around here?" 
Hezi nodded: "Mr. Domoto didn’t..." 
"..." 
Ye Ning didn’t understand, so she stood there somewhat awkwardly for a while, then suddenly, she pointed to the flowers she had wanted to pick: "Are they beautiful?" 
Ono Yoshiko immediately nodded: "Beautiful!" 
Ye Ning smiled: "Really? That’s great, I was just planning to take them back and put them in the vase." 
Ono Yoshiko got it and her lips curled into a smile. She came over and began helping Ye Ning pick the purple flowers.
###Chapter 363: Chapter 363: All Media Reporting: The President of Ou Group Has Died
The fragrance wafted over, and as they both held it to their noses, they indeed found it very pleasant, akin to the best gift nature had to offer humanity. Just breathing it in was comforting. 
Ye Ning felt her mood wasn’t as bad anymore and contentedly placed the flower into the vase. 
Seeing this, Ono Yoshiko chuckled, "Are these... all for your husband?" 
"What?" 
"Husband, that is... Husband!" 
She actually... said a word! 
Husband? 
Oh NO! noveldrama
How did she come up with that? 
Ye Ning’s face instantly flushed red, "No no no, Miss Hezi, you’ve misunderstood, he’s not my husband, he’s just my boss." 
"Boss?" 
"Yes, I work for him, I’m his assistant," Ye Ning explained slowly, making sure Miss Hezi understood clearly. 
Ono Yoshiko seemed to half-understand but still looked at her with an unchanged gaze, smiling gently with an implicit hint of ambiguity. 
Ye Ning was exasperated and wanted to explain further, but seeing Ono Yoshiko’s perplexed expression, she ended up stamping her foot in frustration and ignored her, focusing on her own flower picking. 
Ono Yoshiko watched her with an even bigger smile, "Then I won’t disturb you anymore, I have to deliver a meal to my brother; he’s at school. When I come back, I’ll visit you again." 
After saying this, she lifted the small wooden box she was carrying. 
Understanding the situation, Ye Ning immediately stepped aside, "Alright, then please go ahead." 
Grateful for having found such a helpful person in this foreign country, Ye Ning sincerely appreciated every word she said to her. 
However, she didn’t expect that as the Japanese woman was about to leave, she suddenly turned around and said, "Take good care of your husband, you will be happy." 
"What did you say?" 
Ye Ning didn’t understand again, this time because Miss Hezi hadn’t gestured. 
So the Japanese woman stood there, pondering for a while, and finally found a few words she knew in that sentence, "Take care of..." 
"Take care of?" 
To care for? 
Ye Ning stood there, stunned... 
A woman who was but a stranger to her, telling her to take good care of that man? 
All of a sudden, she felt as if something had struck her in the chest; standing there, holding the vase, she was so upset she couldn’t say a word... 
Indeed, even she knew at a time like this she should take good care of him, but what about herself? Other than thinking about leaving, what else could she think of? 
Did she really believe... that by leaving, he would truly be safe? 
Ye Ning stood there, watching that retreating figure for a long time before finally holding the vase and slowly walking back. 
By this time, it was already afternoon! 
---- 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, after she had gone out, hadn’t rested at all but rather continued to use the doctor’s mobile phone to remotely instruct his team in Tokyo. 
"Third Young Master, I have already called the police station. I believe it won’t be more than half an hour before the whole of Japan’s media will see the news of your accident." 
"..." 
He logged into his email and saw that the first email was sent by Secretary Gao, so he opened it to read it. 
Half an hour? 
Not bad, it was a little later than he had planned, but in this place, it was acceptable. 
After quickly typing a series of characters on the keyboard, he pressed send...
###Chapter 364: Chapter 364: Lin Yebai is frantically searching for her
"From now on, keep a close eye on all activities at Blue Mountain Villa! Also, check the information on all exhibitors at this exhibition and send it to me." 
Blue Mountain Villa... 
Secretary Gao trembled upon seeing these few words... 
How could this be possible? 
This... this is too unbelievable, right? 
However, since the president had given the order, he immediately set out to do it. After arranging everything, he came back and reported another matter, "By the way, Third Young Master, because of your disappearance, La Shiwen has applied to the Tokyo Government to postpone the jewelry exhibition until your reappearance. Now that you want to release this news..." 
Postponed? 
The man still lying in bed paused for a moment when he saw this message. 
A postponement was certainly good news for Yuzhirun, but if his "death" was announced, then the exhibition would be problematic. Surely, a "dead man" could not participate in the event, right? 
He lay there, frowning in thought for a while, and finally typed a few words in response: "Let’s solve this matter first." noveldrama
"Understood!" Secretary Gao got the message and did not ask further. 
Having given his instructions, Ou Mucen was about to log out of his email when, at the moment his finger was about to press down, he remembered something and asked, "By the way, what about that Lin person?" 
"You mean Lin Yebai?" 
"Mhm!" 
"He’s still in Tokyo. When we discovered you were missing, someone saw you with An Ning at the water supply company, so we went to ask him where she was. However, he said that An Ning had returned to the country." 
At this point, Secretary Gao suddenly recalled the woman’s voice he had heard on the phone earlier and swiftly changed the subject: "Right, is An Ning really with you?" 
The man who was holding his cellphone frowned at this question: "Don’t meddle in what’s none of your business!" 
Secretary Gao felt aggrieved: "It’s not like that. Lin Yebai is frantically searching for her now. That woman hasn’t returned to the country and seems to have not told him. He’s like a madman, searching everywhere for her. I’m worried that he might end up finding where you guys are, bringing trouble." 
Indeed, if he was pretending to be dead, he certainly couldn’t let himself be found, but Lin Yebai wasn’t one of his men. They had already clashed several times over that woman. Wouldn’t he expose everything if he found out? 
Secretary Gao was very concerned... 
Ou Mucen’s gaze also paused! 
That woman came to find him and didn’t inform that man? 
Holding his cellphone, he felt indescribable emotions deep within, but he couldn’t deny that his mood suddenly improved. 
After some thought, while still lying there, he sent out a message: "Don’t mention my whereabouts to anyone, and nobody will find her." 
Secretary Gao: "..." 
Damn, he seemed to have mentioned it to La Shiwen’s daughter... 
— 
When Ye Ning returned to the medical station, the Nurse was already at work. So she picked up the things she had bought and then went to the hut in the back. 
"Ou Mucen?" 
Coming back to the hut, Ye Ning’s first reaction was to check on the patient in the room. 
But when she pushed the door open, she found the man lying on the floor, peacefully asleep. 
Seeing this, she didn’t disturb him and quietly brought in the flowers and the glass vase. She then knelt by the windowsill and began carefully arranging the small flowers.
###Chapter 365: Chapter 365: That Instant of Youthful Bloom
The nurse was absolutely right, this flower really is very fragrant. Even though these are just wildflowers, their fresh scent is the most refreshing aroma that nature offers. As soon as it was brought in, the whole room seemed to be filled with this faint fresh fragrance. 
Kneeling there, bending her waist and quietly trimming, she did not realize that on the other side of the bed, the man who was only pretending to be asleep, after hearing the occasional crisp sound of the scissors, stirred his eyelids and slowly, his eyes opened. 
What is she doing? 
He saw her kneeling there, leaning against the window, her slender figure like a sprite bathed in golden light, her bare feet, her clothes pristine white, her dexterous and fair fingers constantly arranging the flower stems in her hands. 
The leaves of those stems were a lush green, just like jade, and the flowers were multicolored, with purple, bright red, peach pink... 
Every flower was vibrant, every branch radiant, so much so that he was captivated for a moment! 
Ye Ning was trimming seriously when she suddenly felt a gaze on her and subconsciously looked over, "Are you awake? Did I disturb you?" 
The man who had been gazing intently suddenly stiffened his gaze! 
Was this... being caught red-handed? 
There quickly climbed a faint blush upon his fair and handsome face, and he averted his gaze immediately, feigning just having woken up, "No, I just woke up, what are you doing?" 
"I’m arranging flowers. The nurse said the air in this room isn’t very good, so she had me pick some flowers from the nearby village. You see, aren’t they pretty?" When she finished speaking, she deliberately picked up the vase of flowers she had already arranged and shook it in front of his eyes. 
Ou Mucen took a brief glance... 
Flowers, to be honest, couldn’t be called beautiful, living in high society as he did, what kind of precious flowers hadn’t he seen? 
But the flowers in this vase radiated a completely different aura from those expensive ones. Those expensive flowers, just like the glamorous young ladies of high society, were dazzlingly beautiful and enticingly fragrant but always just sat in vases for people to admire. 
But these flowers were different! 
These were truly alive, growing unrestrained by the fields and roadside, and even without being so beautiful, one could still feel their vibrant energy. 
Just like her! 
In the end, Mucen honestly nodded, "Pretty!" 
"Right? I thought so too. So, I’ll put them here on the windowsill, okay? The wind here can blow the fragrance inside." 
Ye Ning placed the arranged flowers on the windowsill. 
And sure enough, with that splash of vibrant color, the entire room seemed much brighter. 
After settling the flowers, she cleaned the room and then got up, preparing to go out to the medical station to ask the doctor if an IV was needed for the evening. 
However, just as she reached the door, about to leave, she suddenly saw that the congee she had prepared earlier was still in the next room and smacked her forehead, turning back, "Oh, are you hungry? I made some congee for you, and you haven’t had it yet, have you?" 
Congee? 
Ou Mucen was actually not hungry, the IV drip he had contained glucose, and such a thing didn’t really make him hungry. 
But since she said it was already prepared, he nodded, "Bring it over." 
"Okay!" 
Ye Ning agreed and went to reheat the congee.noveldrama
###Chapter 366: Chapter 366 Her lips, suddenly brushed across his cheek...
About five minutes later, finally, the porridge water was ready. She found a bowl, filled it for him, and brought it in. 
"The doctor said, since you’ve just had surgery, you should start with this, it will be helpful to you." Bringing it in, she went straight to his bedside and half-knelt down. 
This? 
What is this? 
Ou Mucen slightly raised his eyes to look at the bowl before him, seeing the concoction within the wooden bowl that didn’t quite look like water, nor did it resemble porridge, a flicker of distaste already crossing his eyes. 
"What is this?" 
"Lemon porridge. It’s made a bit clearer, the nurse said it can replace boiled water, and it’s really beneficial for healing your wounds." 
Ye Ning noticed the aversion in his eyes and hurriedly explained, worried he wouldn’t eat it. 
Are you kidding? 
It’s a critical time now. If he wants to recover quickly, he has to listen to the doctor. noveldrama
Fortunately, although the man’s expression wasn’t too pleasant, on hearing that the doctor had instructed her to give it to him, he didn’t say anything and agreed. 
Seeing his consent, Ye Ning was very pleased. She put the porridge aside and knelt down, preparing to help him sit up from the bed on the floor. 
"I’ll help you lean against the wall, propped with a pillow. Otherwise, you won’t be able to drink." 
"Hmm..." Mucen faintly nodded. 
If he was to drink this, of course he had to sit up, or else, how could he drink? 
So he didn’t resist, just quietly lying there, waiting for her to come and help. 
However, he hadn’t expected that when she bent over in front of him, her slender hands holding his shoulders, just moving slightly, a faint scent of flowers drifted from her, catching his gaze momentarily, and he found himself looking down her hanging neckline. 
It was a very pristine white T-shirt, he didn’t even ask when she had changed, or who she had asked to help her change. 
At this moment, such a T-shirt, as she bent down, allowed him to see, from this angle, the beautiful glimpse of springtime hidden inside her collar, captured entirely in his sight. 
It was a patch of milk-like skin, especially under this whitish halo, it appeared even more delicate and lustrous. 
The collarbone was very refined, the shoulder well a bit deep, probably due to being too thin, but its curve was full and round, looking like a well-polished, top-grade jade ring, beautiful and lovely. 
And beneath this beauty lay places even more daunting to behold, the full and round shape wrapped in tiny pieces of black fabric, like a flower that has bloomed in wrath, yet caged within the walls. Such a scene, suggestively emerging and yearning to break forth, truly struck with an impressive force. 
Ou Mucen suddenly felt his breathing becoming a bit heavier... 
"Lean your head towards me a little more so I can get the pillow in," said the girl, with both hands supporting him, unaware of what he was experiencing. Feeling the weight of his upper body, she breathed slightly heavily and asked him to shift a little on his own. 
He was too heavy, especially for her, a girl just over one meter sixty. 
However, she did not anticipate that, just as she finished speaking, the man being supported by her, perhaps feeling the discomfort of the semi-supported angle, also leaned forward with his chest. 
As his body tilted, Ye Ning also bent down. In that instant, without either of them prepared, the girl’s lips brushed against the cheek of the man just as he leaned forward...
###Chapter 367: Chapter 367 He Finally Kissed Her Hard
Gentle, soft, faint yet undeniable, the man suddenly froze, and in that instant, he felt a tingling sensation coursing through his entire body. 
Ye Ning was also stunned, staring blankly at the man. Her heart "thumped" loudly, as if a stone had been suddenly thrown into a calm lake, disrupting the stillness. 
"I... I’ll go get you some porridge!" 
She hastily let go, her face burning hot as if it were a cooked shrimp. 
Ou Mucen felt awkward too, seeing her trying to avoid him, he didn’t try to stop her under the awkwardness. 
But he forgot that he was still a patient at that moment and had also forgotten that this was the first time he was propped up without proper support. So, once the woman let go, a sharp pain surged in his chest and abdomen, and he groaned as he fell backward. 
"Ou Mucen—" Ye Ning saw what happened and panicked, forgetting the awkwardness from before, she lunged forward to catch him. 
But how could she, with her strength, pull back the weight of this man? 
In less than a second, the world before her eyes shook, and with a startled cry, she, along with him, tumbled on top of his body... 
"Mmm..." 
As they fell, the man beneath her groaned from the pain, his face twisting in agony. 
Ye Ning was shocked, staring dumbfounded at the handsome face close beneath her eyelids. Her mind exploded, leaving her in a blank daze. 
Oh my God! 
What on earth was she doing? 
Was this not tantamount to killing him? 
She stared blankly at her own reflection in the irritated dark pupils of his, her expression completely stupefied. 
Ou Mucen was equally caught off guard! 
This damn woman, could she be any more clumsy? Couldn’t she even take care of a sick person properly? What had she been raised on? 
However, after the initial pain subsided, and his focus regained, he was suddenly stunned by the sight of the woman sprawled on top of him... 
It was a face filled with immense shock, her expression full of alarm and panic, but her eyes, because of her fright, looked exceptionally beautiful and exquisite, like the ripples spreading on a suddenly disturbed lake surface 
And her lips were slightly parted because of her astonishment, like the bursting buds of a flower finally about to bloom, petals tenderly unfurling... noveldrama
His heart gave a sudden leap, and the next second, uncontrollably, he reached out to hold her head and pressed his lips down hard! 
Ye Ning’s eyes instantly widened!! 
Heavens! 
What was he doing?!! 
It was like a bolt of lightning had been thrown into her brain, and in just a second, a current shot through her whole body, turning all her thoughts and perceptions into a blank slate! 
Ou Mucen, too, was stiff! 
He hadn’t anticipated that his impulsive action would be this. 
But such a pause only lasted a few seconds, and as he sensed the fragrant breath of the girl between his lips, instead of pulling away, he kissed even more deeply, like a toddler who had taken his first step, transitioning from initial clumsiness to fervent, unprecedently wild passion. 
Ye Ning was nearly suffocating! 
All her life, she had never been kissed like this.
###Chapter 368: Chapter 368 His Reaction After He Woke Up...
Although she had given birth to a child, she was completely ignorant of the intimate interplay between a man and a woman. That man, who took her innocence years before, did nothing but repeatedly demand her naive body in the dark, without any affection, and Ou Yuze had done nothing more than hold her hand. 
Therefore, this man was truly the only one she had ever kissed! 
Of course, there had been a few times before, but those were accidents, which she wouldn’t take to heart, yet this time was different, this time, he was lucid, she could distinctly feel that he was indeed lucid. 
Ye Ning’s eyes were tightly closed, and she seemed to have stopped breathing, with fine beads of sweat covering the petite tip of her nose. 
Ou Mucen... 
"Mmm..." 
The man’s kiss suddenly deepened, and as it did, Ye Ning felt his hand move slowly from her head to her back, and then, as if bewitched, slip inside her clothes. 
Ou Mucen, you can’t! 
She was seized with a sharp tremor of fear and finally opened her eyes wide, "Mmm... Ou Mucen... no... no, you can’t..." 
"Why can’t I?" 
The man’s blurred voice spilled out from between their tightly entwined lips as if he was talking in his sleep, his eyes were dark red, his breath scorching, and the frenzy enveloping him almost seemed to set him aflame. 
Ye Ning’s heartbeats threatened to make her faint, when suddenly, as if struck by a current, she shivered all over. With her eyes closed, she fiercely bit down on that thing still crazily invading her lips. 
"Mmm—" 
As soon as her lips bit down, indeed, all movement on top of her ceased. 
Ye Ning’s heart pounded like a drum, she dared not even breathe as she watched the man still beneath her eyelids, her small face covered with fine beads of sweat. 
She couldn’t help it; he was still a patient, after all... 
But then she saw that, after her bite, the man lying beneath her immediately calmed down, his dark red eyes began to turn pitch black again, and then his breathing slowly steadied. 
However, when his pupils returned to normal and suddenly caught sight of her close at hand, and their lips still entwined, she saw his beautiful pupils contract sharply! 
Is he... feeling shock and regret? 
Seeing such a change, Ye Ning’s heart, which had just been racing, immediately sank, little by little, as if plunging into an ice cellar, her body instantly chilled. 
With just a gentle push of her fingers, indeed, she was pushed away by him. 
"You actually dared to bite me?" 
"Ah?"noveldrama
Ye Ning was somewhat slow to react. 
Was he saying that she actually dared to bite him? 
Instead of... something else? Like immediately pushing her away and cursing her with disgust and anger, banishing her, just as he had left her on the highway on the way back from B City to A City, discarding her on the roadside. 
Ye Ning looked at him for a long time, still not recovering her senses... 
Ou Mucen, with his lips bitten, looked at her foolish appearance, and grew even angrier: "What are you dazing out for! Still waiting to crush me to death?" 
Ah? 
Ah!! 
Ye Ning finally snapped out of it and quickly got off him, her face flushed, her heart pounding as if about to leap out of her throat. 
This man, his reaction this time was a bit off!
###Chapter 369: Chapter 369: Does He Like Her?
Coming down from his body, she didn’t dare look at him anymore. Instead, she covered her burning face and dashed out of the room. 
Crazy! Truly crazy! 
Why did he suddenly kiss her? 
And after kissing her, it didn’t seem like he was angry, and when he came to, his demeanor was very calm, as if the kiss was something he did willingly. 
Did that mean... he liked her? 
The moment this thought settled, something inside her seemed to split open, and a scorching, tumultuous wave surged through her. She felt as if her blood had stopped flowing, and all she could hear in her body were the pounding beats of her heart. 
It was joy! 
An uncontrollable joy even she couldn’t restrain! 
"Miss An, what are you doing leaning over the sink?" 
"Ah?" 
She suddenly came back to her senses, quickly scooped up some more water and patted her overheated face with it, then turned off the tap. 
"Nothing... Nothing, I was just washing my face. Is the doctor looking for me?" 
"Hmm..." 
The young Japanese doctor glanced at her wet face and her swollen lips, "Today we need to change the dressing on the patient’s wound and use some ultraviolet rays, which will help the wound heal faster. However, the lamp isn’t here; it was borrowed by a villager. I’ll give you an address, and ask the nurse to accompany you to fetch it." 
"Okay!" Ye Ning heard that it was for the device needed to heal that person’s wounds, so of course, she wouldn’t refuse and readily agreed to go with him. 
In some remote Japanese villages, it’s common, since the medical stations have no wards, for the sick villagers to stay at home. During these times, doctors and nurses would bring medicine and equipment to the villager’s homes to treat them. 
This ultraviolet lamp, for instance, was a frequently used tool. 
Ye Ning followed the doctor to find the young nurse, and then the two of them set out together... 
"Miss An, what happened to your lips? They look swollen," asked the young nurse, noticing her swollen lips just as they were about to leave. 
Feeling unexpectedly embarrassed, Ye Ning quickly covered her mouth, "Nothing... It’s nothing, I was just bitten by a mosquito a moment ago." 
A mosquito? 
The nurse looked suspicious after examining the red, swollen area. 
Could a mosquito have bitten so evenly? Her whole lip was swollen. noveldrama
So the two of them went out to fetch the ultraviolet lamp. 
Meanwhile, once Ye Ning had left, the doctor remembered his cell phone and the wound that needed changing, and he too came into the small house, holding some gauze and disinfectant. 
"Mr. Ou, what’s wrong with you?" 
Upon entering and seeing the man lying on the bed wiping his lips with a tissue, blood on the tissue. The doctor was surprised. 
Ou Mucen was inwardly cursing that wretched woman when he saw the doctor come in. He quickly crumpled the tissue in his hand and threw it into the trash can nearby, "It’s nothing, I just accidentally bit my lip." 
Bit through it? 
After just having surgery, and not being allowed to eat or drink, he had still managed to bite through his lip? 
The doctor knelt down in front of him with the medicine tray, but he remembered the girl’s similarly swollen lips, "It seems that Miss An is taking good care of you. Let me change the dressing for your wound." 
"Hm!" Mucen responded, and lifted the bedsheets by himself. 
After the doctor checked, he began to unbutton his shirt... 
"Mr. Ou, you still have to be careful, your wound seems to have opened up a bit."
###Chapter 370: Chapter 370: There’s a New Car in the Yard!
"Really?" 
"Yes, look, the blood vessels are already starting to seep through. This isn’t good for your recovery," the doctor said with a smirk. 
Ou Mucen, seeing this, finally felt a bit embarrassed. He turned his head away and kept silent, waiting for the doctor to change his dressing and clean his wound. 
That damn woman! 
Soon, the wound was rebandaged, and Ou Mucen took out a small chip card: "Takahashi, this is your phone card. I’ve had my subordinate deposit one million yen into your account, aside from my medical expenses, the rest is for buying your phone." 
One million? 
The young doctor was baffled by the small chip card: "Mr. Ou, you’re paying me one million for my phone?" 
Ou Mucen nodded, "Takahashi, I don’t like things I’ve used to end up in others’ hands, so, although the phone is yours, from the moment you gave it to me, it was no longer yours." 
Indeed, Ou Mucen was no ordinary person; he was the president of the Ou Group. Such a man was involved in too many business secrets, and naturally, he couldn’t return such a communication device. 
The doctor stared at him for a long time before finally accepting the chip card... 
"Fine, if you want the phone, I can give it to you, but this one million..." 
"You don’t need to delay. You saved my life; it’s worth that price. Also, I don’t want anyone to know I’m here. I hope you can do me this favor, Takahashi," Ou Mucen said, his tone no longer so affable. 
The doctor was taken aback, sensing an invisible pressure... 
This was not merely a superficial request! 
With the news in an uproar these past few days, he had been guessing the identity of his patient, not yet sure of the shocking truth. He never imagined the young man would address the matter so directly. 
He doesn’t want anyone to know he’s here? 
Clutching the thin chip card, he finally bowed his head: "Alright, I understand." 
Yet, as he agreed, the doctor remembered a call he’d received just before entering the room, a woman speaking English, asking for directions... 
— 
Ye Ning had been gone for about an hour and a half before she finally got the ultraviolet lamp with the nurse. 
The nurse had wanted to stay for dinner at the house, but Ye Ning was in a hurry to return, so the nurse had no choice but to accompany her back. noveldrama
By the time they got back to the medical station, the sun had set, and nearly everyone there had left. 
Seeing this, the nurse carried the lamp with her to the backyard, "I’ll teach you how to use it first. Once you’ve used it the first time, you’ll know how." 
Ye Ning nodded and followed her. 
However, when the two of them left the medical station and reached the backyard, they discovered a white Cadillac parked there, though this backyard never permitted cars.
What was going on? 
Why was there a car here? 
Ye Ning looked at the nurse suspiciously. 
But the nurse shook her head, indicating she also didn’t know what was going on. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning carried the lamp with her towards the cottage opposite. It was at this moment that the sliding door of the small house was suddenly pulled open from the inside...
###Chapter 371: Chapter 371 La Chenxi Has Come...
Ye Ning fixed her gaze and saw a lanky man with glasses wearing a plaid shirt walking out. 
The secretary Gao? 
How could he be here? 
Ye Ning opened her mouth in surprise! 
Similarly, the secretary Gao, coming out from the house and seeing it was her, also widened his eyes, "Oh my god, An Ning, you really are here!!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Standing there, she looked at him for a while before responding, "Why did you come? Earlier, when I wanted to call you, the Third Young Master wouldn’t allow it." 
"Is that so?" 
"Yeah, he said if I called you, those people chasing him would track your phone and then find us. I didn’t dare to call. So, how did you find out we were here?" 
The secretary Gao: "..." 
The CEO had fooled the young girl again, how could he do that? Such a high-level deception, how was he going to smooth this over? 
Standing there, he racked his brains for a long time before finally coming up with an answer, "Actually, I found him through tracking his locator too." 
"Locator?" 
"Yeah, I..." 
Just as he was about to continue spouting nonsense, unsuspectingly, a voice suddenly came from the little house behind him, "Gao Ziyang, haven’t you brought it yet? It’s in the trunk of the car." noveldrama
A woman? 
As the voice trailed off, Ye Ning quickly directed her gaze to the man in front of her. 
Upon seeing this, the secretary Gao suddenly looked a bit embarrassed: "That... Miss Li also came." 
Miss Li? 
Ye Ning finally felt a jolt, her hand gripping the lamp slowly drooped down... 
Miss Li, wasn’t that La Chenxi, the one she had seen twice before? 
She heard that La Chenxi was a famous international pianist and the daughter of a diplomat, and that she had come back to Japan this time to help the Oushi Corporation. 
She remembered the two times she met that woman, and finally her eyebrows slightly furrowed: "So it’s her. Is she taking care of him now?" 
The secretary Gao nodded: "Yes, she sent me to get the medicine brought from Tokyo that can rapidly help the Third Young Master recover from his injuries, and some nutritional supplies, all in the car." 
The secretary Gao didn’t notice any difference in the woman before him. 
Indeed, this woman, although she too was a woman, but she was the Third Young Master’s assistant and a still-living mother; he would never have thought that she could have any relation with his boss. 
After saying that, he went to the car to get the items. 
Ye Ning saw that she was very reluctant to go back inside, but the nurse behind her was urging her, so she eventually went in, carrying the lamp. 
Entering the cottage, indeed, before she even reached the room, she already heard that soft voice... 
"Chen, do you know? I didn’t sleep all night last night, my mind was full of images of you in trouble, that feeling, it was almost suffocating, I have never been so scared before." 
"......" 
In the room, there was silence for a long time, but standing outside, Ye Ning could faintly hear a choking sound. 
And, it seemed like the sound of droplets falling to the floor! 
Plip—— 
"You don’t have to worry, I’m fine now, aren’t I?" 
Perhaps it was that sob that finally softened something, for Ye Ning, standing there, heard the man finally speak. 
"Right, thank goodness you’re okay, otherwise, I don’t know how I’d carry on living, Chen!" 
"......" 
PS: I recommend the new book "One Battle to Marriage: Master Li, Need a Hug" by Fluorescent Purple. Unable to bear it any longer, she grabbed a cushion and threw it at him, "Old fogy, why are you home so early?" 
Someone caught it calmly, "To make a baby!"
###Chapter 372: Chapter 372: She Really Looks Like the Mistress of This Place
Ye Ning suddenly felt an uncomfortable pressure in her heart, her fingers holding the lamp turned pale, and almost instinctively, she wanted to shove the into the nurse’s hand and leave this place. 
But just then, Secretary Gao from outside came in with some items, "Huh? Why haven’t you gone in yet? It’s fine, Miss La isn’t an outsider." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
It was the nurse, upon hearing this, who took the lamp, "Miss An, please come in!" 
Then, she opened the door! 
It was at this moment, as Ye Ning stood at the doorway, that she finally saw the beautiful girl inside the room wearing a white dress and with long black hair, who was now tearfully kneeling at the bedside. 
"An Ning, is it really you?" As soon as she saw her, the girl immediately turned her head in surprise to look at her. 
Ye Ning smiled briefly, her gaze swept quickly across the bed in front of her, to the man lying there, who was also looking at her. Immediately, her eyes darted away, "Oh, so it’s Miss La, I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were coming, or I would have come to meet you." 
"No need, no need, I came here secretly, without telling anyone." She said, and then stood up from the ground. 
Ye Ning, upon seeing this, also came in with the lamp. 
She had intended to ask the nurse to show her how to use it, but as soon as she put it down, the girl named La Chenxi came over, upon seeing the lamp on the ground, she asked the nurse, "Is this equipment for his treatment?" 
"Yes, it’s to help heal his wounds!" 
"Oh, that’s wonderful, then teach me how to use it, please? I want to take care of him." 
Her voice was filled with happiness and excitement, and her tone was as if she was the true mistress of this place, taking everything upon herself as soon as she spoke. 
Embarrassingly, Ye Ning let go, her eyes fixed on the man across in the bed, who at that moment was completely ignoring everyone in the room, instead typing something on the laptop that Secretary Gao had brought. Her gaze dimmed and turned towards the small table beside his bed. 
It was a table heaped with all sorts of nutritional products, but, next to the pile, she noticed a bowl filled with porridge. 
It was the porridge that she had prepared for him in the morning and then warmed up again. However, due to the incident that occurred while they were trying to help him up, the porridge had never been consumed. 
Would he still want to drink it now? 
After all, with so many high-end nutrients and such an understanding, gentle and beautiful confidante... noveldrama
While thinking this, her eyes dropped before finally moving towards it... 
"What are you doing?" 
She had just reached out her hand towards the small bowl, when the man, who was previously busy working on his laptop, suddenly turned his head. 
Ye Ning was taken aback! 
What was she doing? 
Of course, she was going to pour it out. With so many better things, what was hers worth? It would be best to discard it. 
"I..." 
"The doctor said I can’t eat anything cold, heat it up again for me," said the man in the patient’s gown, his handsome face still pale, then he casually instructed her and returned to his work. 
Ye Ning bent over there, and after a long moment, simply nodded her head in a daze, then carried the bowl of porridge out. 
As she was leaving, she realized that Miss La, who had been eagerly learning from the nurse, had fallen silent. She stood there, staring at her continuously, until Ye Ning approached carrying that item.
###Chapter 373: Chapter 373: Does Lin Yebai Know She’s Here?
"What is this?" 
"Lemon porridge water. The doctor recommended it, saying it’s beneficial for Young Master Three’s recovery from surgery," Ye Ning smiled as she looked at her. 
Lemon porridge water? 
With a glance at the bowl in her hands that she hadn’t paid attention to since she walked in, La Chenxi felt somewhat embarrassed, "Should I go heat it up?" 
You heat it up? 
Ye Ning glanced at the ultraviolet light in her hand that she hadn’t yet mastered and couldn’t help but smile at the corners of her mouth, "Aren’t you supposed to be learning how to use the ultraviolet light? Are you not doing that anymore?" 
"I..." 
"You’d better hurry up and master it. Young Master Three will need it soon." She spoke nonchalantly and quickly carried the bowl of porridge water out. 
Leaving the woman standing there, her pretty little face going from green to white, then from white to red, more colorful than a big dye shop. 
And what about the man working on his laptop in the bed? 
Upon hearing the last few phrases, his fingers, tapping on the keyboard, paused slightly while the corners of his eyes twitched... 
Quite sharp-tongued, it seems his worries were somewhat superfluous.
Ye Ning took the porridge water outside just as Secretary Gao was bringing in the medicine pack; seeing her carrying something, he was initially taken aback, "What’s that?" 
Ye Ning: "Nothing much, just something to drink after surgery. By the way, why has she come too?" 
"You’re referring to Miss La?" 
"Yes!" 
"Well, she was the first to notice that Young Master Three went missing, and it was also her who found out that you were with Young Master Three at the water supply company. That’s why she went to seek out Lin Yebai specifically." 
"What? Lin Yebai?" 
Ye Ning’s complexion immediately changed, "You’ve been to see him already?" 
Secretary Gao nodded, "Yes, but he denied it, saying you had already returned to your country. After that, we continued the search on our own and found you both." 
Secretary Gao still concealed some details; he didn’t mention that he and La Chenxi had eavesdropped outside the presidential suite before, nor did he mention that he had secretly followed Xiaojin. 
Because he knew the woman in front of him had a special relationship with Lin Yebai, and if she found out that he listened in and followed Lin Yebai’s person, she would certainly be angry. 
Yet, he didn’t know that from the moment he mentioned they had looked for Lin Yebai, Ye Ning standing opposite to him had already started feeling uneasy. 
They had looked for Lin Yebai, which meant Brother Lin must now know that she hadn’t returned to her country and that it was very likely he also knew she was with Ou Mucen. 
If they all managed to find this place, could he also come? 
Suddenly, a sense of panic began to rise within her... 
"An Ning?" 
"Ah?" 
"What’s on your mind? You look so pale," Secretary Gao observed her. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning quickly turned her head to avert his gaze, "Nothing... I’m probably just a bit tired. It’s nothing, I’ll go heat this up. You go inside." 
Having said that, she took the bowl into the next room. 
If Lin Yebai is coming, what would she do? Would he come to kill her? 
No, that shouldn’t be the case now. With Secretary Gao and La Chenxi here, it would be impossible for him to act. 
If he won’t act, then would he still come? noveldrama
The answer was a definitive yes! 
He was a man with a very strong desire for control, especially over her. He enjoyed making arrangements for every aspect of her life and liked it when she obediently listened like a child. But this time, she not only didn’t listen, but she also disrupted his entire plan. How could he possibly not come looking for her?
###Chapter 374: Chapter 374: So It’s the Ex-Girlfriend
She remembered the expression on his face when he cornered her against the wall that night, and finally, her hand holding the spoon slowly began to turn white... 
After heating up the porridge, she carried it back into the room and found that the Nurse had already left. The La family girl who had finally learned to use the lamp was now kneeling by the bed, keeping watch over the lamp, and also over the man. 
Ye Ning saw this, her brow furrowed, and she approached with the bowl of porridge: "The porridge is ready..." 
"I’ll do it, you’ve also taken care of him for so long, you should go back and rest well, just leave it to me," she said, the girl looking at her with a face full of sincerity, rising up from the ground. 
Ye Ning was taken aback! 
Go back? 
Where to go back to? This was where they were staying, where did she want her to go back to? 
She suddenly found it somewhat laughable, wanted to clarify, but at this moment, recalling the messy thoughts in her head, she suddenly lost interest, so she simply handed the bowl in her hand into the girl’s palm: "That’s fine, then I’ll leave it to Miss La."
La Chenxi was immediately overjoyed: "Okay, okay, then you go back and rest well!" 
Ye Ning smiled, turned around, and left. 
When she left, she didn’t even look at the man lying in the bed! 
What’s there to look at, after all, she didn’t have anything to do with him... 
Stepping out of the small house, it was completely dark outside. Seeing this, she went to the corridor and switched on the only lamp in the courtyard. 
The 15-watt vintage light bulb wasn’t very bright, but its orange glow cast a flickering light throughout the courtyard in the gentle cool breeze, creating its own charming scenery. And within such scenery stood a man in a plaid shirt, leaning there and smoking a cigarette. 
Ye Ning saw him and approached: "What, planning to sleep in the car tonight?" 
The man seemed depressed: "I was planning to go back, but she doesn’t want to." 
She? noveldrama
Ye Ning leaned there as well and casually picked a piece of foxtail grass beside her to fiddle with in her hand: "Of course she doesn’t want to go back. She can’t wait to live here." 
Tss—— 
Hearing this, the smoking man got even more irritated and took another agitated drag: "Had I known, I wouldn’t have told her!" 
"Then why did you tell her?" 
"I was thinking, after all, she’s the third young master’s girlfriend, and she’s been looking for him all along, so I gave her a heads-up." 
"..." 
Girlfriend? 
Ye Ning held the piece of wild grass, looked at him for a long time, then stiffly asked, "Is Miss La the third young master’s girlfriend?" 
Secretary Gao nodded: "Actually, it should be ex-girlfriend. Before, the third young master and Miss La went to the same school, Miss La was a grade higher than him, and they met in school. They had a good relationship." 
Secretary Gao also only heard about his boss’s scandal occasionally when the president and a few of his close friends were at a gathering, and he happened to overhear it while standing to the side. He wasn’t very clear about the actual situation. 
So, at this moment, what he said was just casually mentioned. 
But after hearing this, Ye Ning felt as if the sliver of hope she had been holding onto had suddenly sunk to the bottom of the valley, her entire body turning cold. 
So she was the ex-girlfriend, that made sense, she had thought so. Sometimes the way she spoke didn’t seem like what a mere friend would say. 
She remembered when they first met, how that woman had wanted to buy her a dress and the man’s reaction after entering...
###Chapter 375: Chapter 375: You Get Back Here!
Indeed, at that time his reaction was very intense, the sudden outburst of rage was not only expressed with the harshest and most vicious words hurled at her but he also fiercely threw the money at her. The extremity and excessiveness of it all truly made her wish to kill him right then and there. 
So it seems that beforehand, she couldn’t understand, but now, it was finally clear. 
It was all because of this ex-girlfriend! 
She started to laugh, with a hint of self-mockery and a trace of sarcasm, "So it’s the ex-girlfriend, huh? I was wondering why she was so concerned about him." 
The secretary, Gao, took a drag of his cigarette, "I don’t think she’ll be an ex for much longer." 
"Why?" 
"Just look at their relationship, all lovey-dovey, sweet as honey. Who knows, by tonight, she might not be the ex anymore." 
"..." 
Ye Ning stood there, looking at the window he pointed to for a long time, then threw the wild grass in her hand to the ground and trampled on it fiercely, "Fine, they can have their sweet nothings, and we’ll get our sleep. Let’s go, I’ll find you a place to sleep." noveldrama
The secretary’s eyes lit up instantly, "Where to?" 
Ye Ning didn’t look back, "You’ll know when we get there!" 
She really needed to leave this place quickly, or else she would suffocate, gasping for air any minute now. 
However, just as the two were about to leave the courtyard, a sharp reprimand came from the lit room behind them, "Gao Ziyang, get your ass in here!" 
Oh come on! 
What’s with the president this time? 
After the sharp reprimand, the following secretary, Gao, shuddered and stopped in his tracks, "An... An Ning, the young master is calling me." 
Ye Ning also stopped, sensing the anger in the shout. She frowned, "Then you better go back and check it out. I’ll wait for you here." 
"Okay!" 
Hearing this, the secretary hurried back. 
Ye Ning didn’t know what had happened but after seeing him go back, she truly stood at the doorway of the yard, waiting for him to come out so she could take him to find a place to sleep. 
Yet, as she stood there for less than two minutes, the person who had just gone in came rushing out again, "An Ning, come quick, there’s been an accident!" 
An accident?
What kind of accident? 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s face changed instantly, and without a second thought, she turned back. 
"What happened? What’s going on?" Rushing in hastily, she didn’t even have time to observe the room’s situation; her primary concern was the man lying on the bed. 
The man’s face was still dark, and it turned even more livid upon seeing her enter. 
"I... I don’t know. I was just kneeling here, and then he said it hurt..." The person who had been in the room all along, La Chenxi, became so flustered that she couldn’t even finish her sentence upon everyone’s arrival. 
Hurt? 
Ye Ning wasn’t interested in her expression. Upon hearing that it was the wound hurting, she immediately ran over and crouched beside the ultraviolet light, "How could it hurt? The nurse said this lamp is only meant for healing the wound." 
"So you think I’m faking it?" 
"..." 
Ye Ning abruptly turned her head to look at the man behind her, grinding his teeth as if he wanted to kill her. 
"No, no, young master, I didn’t mean that..." 
"Then what did you mean?" 
"I... I’ll check, let me check first!" 
Ye Ning felt cold sweat about to drip down; his gaze was truly terrifying, as if he were about to devour her. What did this have to do with her? It wasn’t her fault, was it?
###Chapter 376: Chapter 376 Incurable Stupidity
But since he was already furious, she did not dare to talk back, so she could only lower her head and really start to carefully check the lamp. noveldrama
Yet, she discovered that the temperature of the lamp was indeed a bit high. However, it was completely because the arm of the lamp, which was adjustable, seemed to have been moved down a notch, causing the lamp head to be too close to the wound, creating a burning sensation. 
Strange, the position of the arm was already set earlier, how could it have been moved? 
Ye Ning looked at the setting with suspicion and then pulled it back up, "It’s okay now, it was just too close, adjusting it will do." 
La Chenxi, who was on the other side, saw it and her beautiful eyes instantly filled with grievance as she looked towards the man lying there, "Chen, I told you, it wasn’t me..." 
"Then if you can’t even operate a lamp, what are you still doing here?" 
"What?" 
As these words fell, not only did the woman’s complexion instantly turn pale, but even Ye Ning widened her eyes and stared blankly at the man. 
Isn’t she his ex-girlfriend? 
Oh, no, that’s not right, she’s the girlfriend. Secretary Gao said that after today, she would become his official girlfriend. 
She is his girlfriend, and he speaks to her like this? Isn’t he afraid of offending her? It’s very hard to placate an angry woman. 
But the truth is, this man, after finishing his sentence with a face of steely rage, followed it up with a cold "Get out!" 
Ah? 
Get out? 
Who is he asking to leave? 
Ye Ning glanced at the woman across from her, who was wringing her hands and looked pitiful no matter how you saw it, then looked at herself, who seemed to be a bright 100-watt bulb. Finally, her gaze dimmed and she sensibly let go, "Alright, then I’ll go out with Secretary Gao first. You two have a good rest." 
After speaking, she turned to leave. 
The man lying in the bed saw it, and a vein on his forehead finally bulged, "Not you! I was talking to her!" 
This foolish woman, she was really driving him to his death! 
With those words, the atmosphere completely plunged into an icy point! 
Ye Ning stood at the door for a long time, not daring to turn back... 
What did that mean? 
Was he asking her to stay? Wasn’t she the one supposed to leave? 
A sudden fear clutched at her heart! 
Similarly, the other woman standing in the room was also stunned. However, she was not as slow to understand as the woman at the door. She had long noticed the secret intent of this man and had almost grasped his meaning as soon as he spoke. 
He wanted that woman to stay, not her! 
So, the lamp before was just an excuse, right? 
As this thought settled, the blood drained from her face, and her fingers gripping the wad of tissue clenched tightly into the palm of her hand as if wanting to crush it into pieces. 
"Chen, I can take good care of you..." 
"There’s no need for that. This isn’t Tokyo; there is no place for you to stay. You should go back with Secretary Gao first, so your father won’t worry." He didn’t even glance at her and just tossed out those words lightly. 
Indeed, there was no place to stay here, but if he wanted them to stay, wouldn’t there really be no arrangement? 
La Chenxi finally lost even the last bit of hope, looking at the man who had no warmth for her, she bit her lip, and at last, walked towards the door. 
Ye Ning was standing at the door. Seeing her approaching, she subconsciously made room for her to pass.
###Chapter 377: Chapter 377: She Even Dared to Ask if That Woman Would Be Angry When She Left!
Unexpectedly, when she approached, the woman came to a halt, and then Ye Ning saw her standing in front of her. After flipping her jet-black, beautiful straight hair, she actually smiled, "An Ning, then please take good care of Mucen." 
Ye Ning stared at her blankly for quite a while before nodding, "Mhm, alright, I will..." 
"His stomach is weak; he can’t eat cold, sour, and he also doesn’t like sweet food—pay attention to these things. Moreover, he has a severe obsession with cleanliness, especially in regards to things like pollen which will cause him allergies, you need to be mindful of that too." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
He can’t eat sour or sweet? 
Then the porridge she had made earlier with lemon and sugar, and pollen... 
Her gaze uncontrollably drifted towards two s in the room: one was the flowers placed on the windowsill, the other, the empty bowl by the small table. 
La Chenxi saw all her expressions and stayed quiet, but in the depths of her eyes, when she saw this woman sweep her gaze over the two s in the room, an icy spark shot out from her pupils. 
That was murderous intent! 
A murderous intent born of jealousy! 
After giving these instructions, La Chenxi finally left. When Secretary Gao saw her depart, he followed her out. However, where they would go, nobody knew. 
Ye Ning didn’t ponder on this question, but after seeing that woman leave, she sheepishly turned back from the doorway. 
"You... letting her go back like that, aren’t you worried she’ll be angry?" 
Having turned back, she stood there, and although her mood wasn’t as terrible anymore, facing the suddenly quiet room, she didn’t know what to say. Driven by some mischievous spirit, she asked that question. 
After asking, she felt something was amiss, so she quickly clarified, "I mean... she came all this way to see you, and now it’s so late you’re still letting her go back, isn’t that... somewhat inappropriate?" 
Ou Mucen had been silent the whole time, but once she said this, he finally lifted his gaze from the computer screen and looked at her coldly, "So what you’re saying is... you want her to continue staying here?" 
Ye Ning was immediately caught off guard! 
That wasn’t what she meant; she was just concerned about the late hour and their safety driving back—she was simply worried about them. noveldrama
She lowered her head, palms sweaty, "No, didn’t she come especially to see you?" 
"So what if she did? Did I ask her to come?" 
"Huh?" 
"An Ning, remember this, in my world, unless I personally say so, no one has anything to do with me, Ou Mucen!" He enunciated every word, his goal was to make this foolish woman understand. 
Ye Ning was completely baffled! 
Her bright and moist eyes just blankly stared at him, as if she had gone numb, and it took her a very long time to respond. 
What was he talking about? 
Unless he personally says so? Otherwise, no one has anything to do with him? 
Then, the visit from Miss La today, was he trying to tell her that she wasn’t someone he asked to come, so she had nothing to do with him? 
Suddenly it felt as though something in her heart leapt, and in an instant, her crystalline pupils brightened, a lovely flush of red seared her cheeks like an electric shock. 
"I... I’m going to boil some water for you!" 
She couldn’t even dare to look at him any longer, covering her wildly thumping chest, she rushed out like a little rabbit, clutching the kettle.
###Chapter 378: Chapter 378: That is her, La Chenxi’s thing, no one else should think about snatching it away
She was no veteran in the field of love, nor had she ever been loved, cared for, at the age of 23 she already had a child, but truth be told, she had never even experienced what it meant to truly "like" someone. 
In the past, she had been so infatuated with that scumbag, but what about him? 
He never considered whether she was happy or not, nor did he wonder if she could accept certain things. To him, she was merely an , a pawn, he never cared for her, never loved her; he only ever used her. 
Yet now, because she did not like that woman named La Chenxi, she heard the man telling her that the woman who had come had nothing to do with him, Ou Mucen. 
Because he did not speak up! 
Holding the kettle by the sink, she looked down and finally, the moisture at the corner of her eyes spilled over. 
However, her lips curled into a smile, like a child yearning for a piece of candy, having endured for so long, finally receiving it; she shook with joyous excitement. 
She really liked this feeling! 
—— 
Similarly, in that room, seeing the woman dash away like a startled deer, the man half-reclining on the bed also let out a long sigh of relief... 
What an idiotic woman! 
His gaze retracted as he returned to his work, but a slight curve appeared on his relaxed handsome face, sliding across his nice lips... 
Outside the window, a shadow had actually never left, standing there quietly; the white long dress, wine-red high heels, and black long hair made her look like a fairy who had descended from the heavens under the moonlight. From any angle, her silhouette was breathtaking, suffocating. 
But it was this silhouette that, upon hearing the conversation from the bright window opposite, began to clench a pale hand tightly. 
And her lips, which had just been lightly made-up, were now fiercely bitten, soon a fresh red began to emerge. 
"Miss La, we should leave. If we don’t leave now, it will really be very late." 
Secretary Gao had been waiting there the whole time, and seeing that she had stood still for nearly twenty minutes without a sign of moving, he finally lost his patience and began to urge her. 
However, the girl in the white dress seemed not to have heard him at all. She stared at that place for a while longer and then suddenly, from her bag, she took out her phone. 
What was she doing? 
Was she contacting someone in Tokyo? 
Watching from behind, Secretary Gao subconsciously had this thought flash through his mind. noveldrama
So he stayed put, watching her take out her phone and snap a photo of the window opposite, and then, not knowing what she did with her phone afterwards, she stiffly turned around and headed towards the car. 
Secretary Gao, seeing this, hurriedly followed her: "Miss La, what were you taking a photo for just now? Don’t let out any information about Third Young Master, don’t forget his current plans." 
"Don’t worry, I won’t. I was just letting another person know I’m safe," she replied. 
"..." 
Another person? 
Who? 
Who else did she need to report her safety to? 
Secretary Gao was taken aback for a moment, and though he wanted to ask, as they got into the car, the woman next to him said, "Could we find somewhere nearby to stay?"
###Chapter 379: Chapter 379: Come here, sit beside me!
He had completely forgotten about it! 
Should I look nearby for a place to stay? 
Shit, isn’t she going back to Tokyo?!! 
---- 
After Ye Ning left with the water bottle, she stayed in the room next door for a very long time, waiting until her emotions had settled down before she finally returned to this room. 
When she came back, because of the earlier incident, she felt too awkward to directly speak to the person lying in this room, so after placing the water bottle by the electrical socket, she began searching for other things in the room to alleviate the awkwardness. 
Right, the bowl! 
And that bottle of flowers! 
She remembered the things that La Chenxi had cautioned her to be mindful of in this room and immediately went to the small table, took the empty bowl, and washed it at the sink. 
The woman had said he did not eat sweets, but why didn’t he eat them? Just like her Xiaobao, they both didn’t eat sweets. 
But if he didn’t eat it, where did the porridge in the bowl go? 
Poured it out? 
She meticulously washed the bowl, her eyes scanning the trash bin next to the sink. Surprisingly, she did not spot any lemons or porridge in there. 
After washing the bowl, she went to deal with the bottle of flowers. She initially intended to throw away the flowers in the bottle, but just as she picked it up, a voice from behind asked, "What are you doing?" 
"Ah?" 
Ye Ning quickly turned around with the bottle of flowers in her arms. "I... I’m throwing away these flowers. Didn’t Ms. La say that you’re allergic to pollen?" 
"You’ve left them there for so long, have you seen any problems with me?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
It seemed there really weren’t any issues, oh, so the flowers... 
"Leave them there and come here!" Ou Mucen, upon seeing her standing still again, frowned slightly and beckoned her over. 
Ye Ning suddenly felt a tightness in her heart! 
Call her over? What was he planning to do? 
Recalling everything that had happened that day, her heart, which had barely calmed down, started pounding again, as if it was about to leap out of her throat. 
"Oh... okay!" 
With trembling hands, she placed the bottle back where it was, then lowered her head and walked step by step towards him. 
Really nervous, she had never been this nervous in her life! 
Finally approaching him, she intended to stand far away and wait for his instructions, but when he saw her standing so far off, his expression soured. "Why are you standing so far away? Do you think I’m going to eat you?" 
"No, it’s not that..." Ye Ning’s face instantly turned red. "I didn’t mean that..." 
"Then why are you still standing over there? Come here!" 
"..." noveldrama
Without saying another word, she obediently kneeled down beside him, her face flushed red. 
Being so close, how could one not have improper thoughts? 
Besides, hadn’t he already done such things at noon? 
Ye Ning’s head was nearly buried into her chest! 
Seeing this, Ou Mucen, finally unable to contain his irritation, slid his laptop toward her and pointed at the screen. "Take care of these, now. There are template responses for emails on the document. Just follow that format and reply to all of them." 
"Ah?" 
Staring at the screen, Ye Ning was somewhat startled. 
He called her over just to have her handle this? 
"What are you dazed for? Get to work!" 
"Oh, oh, okay!" 
Ye Ning finally regained her composure and took the laptop from him... 
PS: Remember to throw your votes at me every day...
###Chapter 380: Chapter 380 An Ning
Indeed, he had just undergone surgery last night, and his body hadn’t fully recovered yet, but today, due to Secretary Gao’s visit, he had been almost lying there for nearly three and a half hours already. Anyone would find this exhausting. 
Ye Ning took the notebook over, finally silent, and prepared to work on the small table over there. 
If he was tired, then he definitely needed to rest well. If she were to type on the keyboard beside him, wouldn’t that disturb him? 
Yet before she could get up, the man who had already lain down beside her spoke, "Just stay here; if there are any questions, you can ask me." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
After a long pause, she ultimately complied, obediently sitting down beside him. Then, as he rested, she began to work on the emails he had sorted on the computer. 
It was evident that he was indeed fatigued. After lying down, he spoke very little and instead closed his eyes slightly, quietly lying there. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning tried to keep her voice down as much as possible, so as not to disturb him. Even if she encountered problems during her work, she would only create a new folder, put them aside, and handle the ones she could, so he could rest well. 
As expected, with the prolonged lack of disturbance, he slowly fell asleep. 
Under the soft light, the man who had been through a long day’s ordeal breathed evenly and gently, as if wearied for a long while, and soon was lost to the world in sleep. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning put the notebook down, went over to turn off the lamp, covered him with his blanket, then returned to her previous spot and continued with her busy work... 
The end of summer nights were already carrying a hint of coolness, and in a tranquil little village like this, the stillness and coolness were even more pronounced. The chirping of insects and the gentle breeze made it feel as if one had arrived in an entirely different world. Though lacking the city’s bustle and glamor, it offered a particular kind of peace and comfort. 
She liked this kind of life. With no grand ambitions, a person like her needed only tranquility to be content. 
Before coming out here, what she had in mind was that, after avenging her great wrong, she and her Xiaobao would leave behind the glamor that didn’t belong to them and find a quiet place to spend the rest of their lives. 
-- 
A sleepless night- 
On the first morning, Ye Ning was woken by the noise of the Nurse pushing the door. She raised her head from the small table and saw that it was already light outside. 
"Miss An, why are you sleeping here? Didn’t I tell you that we’ve prepared a bed and blankets for you in this room?" Seeing Ye Ning sleeping on the small table, the nurse immediately asked with concern. 
Ye Ning quickly shook her head and looked behind her, only to suddenly realize there was no one in the bed! noveldrama
Where was Ou Mucen? Where was he? 
Her drowsiness vanished in an instant, and she stood up abruptly, "Where did he go? Where is he?" 
The Nurse hurriedly held her back, "Don’t worry, he’s fine. He just got up early in the morning and the doctor came to take him for a full-body checkup." 
Is that so? 
Then why didn’t she know anything about it? 
As she listened, she touched her head, which was still a bit swollen and painful, and found it somewhat unbelievable. 
Seeing her like this, the Nurse laughed, "You must have slept very late last night, look at the bloodshot in your eyes. How about this, you go wash your face first, and later you can go to the front and bring him back. We’re working now, and there are more people. I guess no one will be able to send him back later."
###Chapter 381: Chapter 381 He Finally Came...
"Alright!" 
Ye Ning agreed with a sign of relief in her heart at last. 
Indeed, she had stayed up very late last night. She remembered that it was past three o’clock when she sent out the last email, then, overcome by exhaustion, she fell asleep at her desk. 
So, it made sense that she hadn’t heard them leave this morning. 
After the nurse left, she went to the restroom in the next room to wash up. After getting cleaned up and changing her clothes, she finally opened the door and stepped out of the room. 
Initially, she wanted to go straight to the medical station at the front, but as soon as she stepped out, she saw a silver Passat parked at the gate facing the street. 
And the man in the car, after she caught a glimpse of him, her steps abruptly halted. 
He was a young man wearing gold-rimmed glasses, with handsome and refined features, emanating a faint scholarly aura. Such a person would give off the impression of being very easy-going and pleasant at first glance. 
But now, that wasn’t the case; although his facial expression didn’t change much, the eyes behind his glasses were glaring at her icily, as cold as can be, since she had emerged from the room. 
Ye Ning stopped, feeling a moment of panic, but soon, upon recalling certain matters, she calmed down, and then quietly returned his steady gaze. 
She actually didn’t know what she had done wrong. If she had to pinpoint a mistake, it might simply be disobedience, disrupting his entire plan. 
"Ning, come quickly, he’s already been checked." 
"Alright!" noveldrama
Standing there, she responded, and after a moment, her gaze withdrew from him and she made her way to the medical station across the way. 
Upon arrival at the medical station, sure enough, Ou Mucen, who had completed his check-up, was already sitting there, clutching his abdomen, waiting for her. 
Seeing him, she quickly approached: "How are you? Did the doctor say there was anything wrong?" 
Ou Mucen shook his head. He tried to say something, but when her hand reached out to support him, he felt her astonishingly cold hands and looked at her suspiciously: "What’s wrong? Why are your hands so cold?" 
Cold? 
Ye Ning momentarily avoided his gaze, then quickly placed her hands on him over his clothes. She hurriedly explained, "My hands are cold because I washed them when I came here; the water is still a bit chilly in the morning." 
"Really?" 
"Yeah, it’s nothing. I’ll just put on some more clothes when I get back. So, did the doctor prescribe any medication today?" Ye Ning tried to divert the subject. 
Fortunately, he didn’t seem too suspicious. Hearing her inquire about medication, he handed her his prescription. Then, they supported each other to the pharmacy, picked up the medication and injections, and together left the medical station to return to their small living quarters. 
They didn’t look outside the courtyard on their way back. 
However, once back in their little room, she stood there thinking for a while, and in the end, she still came over with the small basket filled with medication and injections: "Let me hang the IV for you first. The doctor said you can eat something today, how about I get you some noodles?" 
Noodles? 
Ou Mucen didn’t think much of it. After lying down, he began to go through her work from the previous day on his laptop: "Whatever you want!" 
So, Ye Ning squatted beside him and carefully hung the IV bag for him, and only then was she ready to leave...
###Chapter 382: Chapter 382: Ou Mucen, Is There Anything Else You Need Me to Do for You?
"Ou Mucen, do you want some water?"
"Hmm?" 
Ou Mucen looked up and saw the woman who had already walked to the door but suddenly turned back to ask him. He felt it strange. 
Water? 
He didn’t need it. The IV drip was already infusing him with a large amount of saline. How could he feel thirsty? 
And she knew that too, didn’t she? 
So he frowned and shook his head in refusal, "No need, go and come back quickly." 
After he spoke, he buried his head back into those emails. 
Ye Ning saw this and a trace of disappointment flashed in her eyes. She didn’t say anything more. Her gaze lingered on his face for one last second before she turned and walked out of the room. 
She didn’t know what might happen once she left, but she already had a bad premonition. 
Subconsciously, she wanted to do something more for him before leaving, but sadly, he had refused... 
She stepped out from the doorway, facing the still bright and splendid morning outside; her eyes felt sore, reluctant, and there was a touch of longing... but eventually, she gathered all her emotions, put on a thin coat, and walked out. 
Once out the door, she turned left following the traces of car wheels. In just two or three minutes, she arrived near the river by a bend and saw the parked silver-gray Passat. 
And there, the owner of the car had already stepped out and had been waiting for her for a long time. 
"Aning, you’re here..." 
Upon hearing footsteps, the man turned and, seeing her, immediately showed a surprised and pleased expression. 
Ye Ning smoothed down her hair in front of her forehead, didn’t say anything, and walked straight towards him. It was only when she got close that she finally saw him clearly and responded calmly, "I’m here..." noveldrama
"..." 
Her tone was very faint, devoid of anger, panic, or guilt. Her expression was calm as if nothing had happened. 
Lin Yebai, with his hands in his coat pockets, clenched them tight. Finally, the brightness that had just appeared on his face slowly settled, "I’ve been looking for you a long time. I thought you had really gone back to your country." 
Ye Ning nodded, "I was indeed planning to go back, but when I was at the airport, I saw that his jewelry had been switched." 
Since he had already laid it bare, there was no need for her to beat around the bush. She might as well put everything on the table. 
As her voice fell, the color drained from the man’s face across from her! 
"Aning, let me explain this to you..." 
"Brother Lin, actually, I can accept anything you do, but what I don’t understand is, why did you have to kill him? Was killing him also part of the plan we made at the beginning?" 
Ye Ning finally lost some of her composure, not for anything else but for those harrowing images of life-and-death escape. She was still haunted by fear when she thought of them. 
That was murder! 
How could he do this? Could someone’s life be so easily taken away? 
Moreover, in their original plan, Ou Mucen was merely a pawn; there was no mention of taking his life. 
Lin Yebai was frightened by her reaction; he turned pale, with a hint of dark red in his eyes - it felt as if a ball of fury inside his heart had finally erupted. His entire expression was one of anger and ferocity.
###Chapter 383: Chapter 383: Why Did You Kill Him?
Has she finally erupted? 
Is it because the topic of their conversation finally mentioned that man? 
Lin Yebai looked at the woman who had never stared at him with such an expression, and finally, his chest also began to lose its calm, "You’re wrong, the one who killed him wasn’t me." 
"Not you?" 
"Yes, it was Ou Yuze. The entire incident was planned by him. If I must be associated with this matter, it’s because I provided his company the qualifications to enter the venue!" 
"What?" 
Ye Ning was somewhat unable to catch up with his direct words. 
This matter was done by Ou Yuze? 
And he, he provided his company the qualifications to enter? What exactly does that mean? Why couldn’t she understand? 
Ye Ning began to feel confused, "I don’t understand what you mean, why would it be Ou Yuze? When did he pop up? Also, what do you mean by providing his company access to the exhibit? There was no Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry at this exhibition, was there?" 
This woman, she’s clever enough! 
Several questions, each virtually hitting the nail on the head.
Lin Yebai’s palms began to sweat coldly, and after thinking for a good while, he said, "The company he exhibited this time wasn’t Longfeng, but a company he founded privately called Shifeng Trade. After hearing that his uncle’s Yuzhirun was also participating in this exhibition, and knowing I was the stabilizer of this exhibition, he had someone find me to recommend him in." noveldrama
"And then what?" 
"Then I knew his purpose was to target his uncle, so naturally, I recommended him. Aning, wasn’t our original plan to have the two of them from the Ou Family fight like dogs? Now that such a good opportunity has arisen, what’s wrong with what I did?" 
At this point, he too finally lost some of his composure, probably because he could no longer control his emotions. 
Indeed, the plan he had made for her from the start was to exploit the conflict between the two sons of the Ou Family to create discord within their ranks, and then both of them would reap the benefits as a bystander. So now that he had acted accordingly, what was wrong with that? 
Lin Yebai became somewhat emotional! 
Ye Ning had been watching him all along and listening to what he was saying... 
Was what he said true? 
It should be true! 
However, how much had he concealed within this truth? 
Ye Ning quietly looked at him, neither answering nor moving, but her gaze was cold and clear, piercingly sharp, as if it were a lamp that could directly probe into the depths of his heart! 
She actually knew Ou Yuze better than anyone; he simply didn’t have the brains to plan any grand schemes or conspiracies! 
The reason she had been deceived and used by him in the first place was entirely because of that slut Yang Xueshan and Mei Liping’s planning. She had walked step by step into their trap; otherwise, with that scum, it would have been impossible for him to end up in his current predicament. 
Therefore, regarding the trap he mentioned today, she believed he couldn’t carry it out. From the seamless jewelry swap to luring Ou Mucen to search personally, none of it could be done without a flawless internal and external collaboration. 
Moreover, Ou Mucen’s intelligence was inherently high, and deceiving him wasn’t something just anyone could achieve. 
Ye Ning, upon thinking this through, finally tugged at the corner of her mouth and spoke, "Yes, there’s nothing wrong with what you’ve done, but Brother Lin, are you truly helping me to take revenge?" 
Lin Yebai’s face changed slightly at once, "What do you mean? Am I not helping you take revenge?"
###Chapter 384: Chapter 384 She’s Too Smart!
"No, what I mean is... if everything you’re saying is true, why am I dealing with Ou Mucen right now, instead of Ou Yuze?" 
"What?" 
"Isn’t it obvious? It’s Ou Mucen who’s had his jewelry switched, who’s being hunted down, while Ou Yuze hasn’t encountered any trouble, hasn’t even shown his face. Brother Lin, tell me, how exactly is this plan supposed to help me take my revenge? Or is it, in fact, not about helping me at all but simply about killing the person you want dead?" 
The last sentence was delivered in a tone that had turned completely icy! 
Upon hearing this, Lin Yebai’s face finally underwent a drastic change, his entire expression turning pale: "Ye Ning! What on earth are you talking about?" 
Ye Ning also became angry: "Am I wrong? You talk about revenge, but the head I want is Ou Yuze’s, so why is it Ou Mucen who’s being hunted? What good does his death do me? Other than making Ou Yuze the sole heir to the Ou Family, what benefit do I have?!!" 
Ye Ning’s voice had risen by several decibels. 
Indeed, in this plan, what good does Ou Mucen’s death do for them? 
Once Ou Mucen is dead, there will be no more heirs to the Ou Family. Other than Ou Muyuan’s son, Ou Yuze, who else can they turn to? By doing this, not only has she not taken her revenge successfully, she has instead propelled him to the pinnacle of his life. What kind of revenge is that? 
A joke? 
Ye Ning was so angry that she was shaking all over! 
Lin Yebai’s face had also turned ashen. He had never imagined she would be this astute. He had rounded off his explanations so thoroughly, yet in just a few words, she had completely uncovered the truth of the matter. 
Yes, he did want to kill that man! 
And he wanted to kill him by using someone else’s hand! 
He was utterly despondent, like a cornered beast driven to the brink... 
"Yes, I want to kill him. Is that not allowed?" 
"What did you say?" noveldrama
Ye Ning’s eyes widened in shock as she looked at the man who had suddenly calmed down: "Say that again?" 
Lin Yebai’s face was filled with cold mockery: "What’s wrong? Didn’t you hear me clearly? I said, I’ve planned all this just to kill him!" 
"Why?" 
"Why?" 
The man’s face, full of scorn, heard these questions, as though he had heard a laughable joke: "Because you fell in love with him, because he would hinder your revenge, block your path forward. Is that reason not enough for you?" 
"..." 
It was like a thunderclap from a clear sky, Ye Ning stood there feeling nothing but a buzz in her head, staring at him without any response. 
What is he saying? 
Is he saying she fell in love with that man? 
And that he would hinder her revenge? Block her steps forward? 
He must be insane to spout such nonsense; how could she, Ye Ning, possibly fall in love with him? 
Ye Ning began to tremble all over, and at the same time, her complexion turned frighteningly pale: "You... you’re talking nonsense..." 
"Whether I’m talking nonsense, you know best. But I must remind you, don’t forget who you are. She is the adopted daughter of the Ou Family, and the people of the Ou Family are your enemies. Even if Ou Mucen has no direct feud with you, once you kill his brother, his nephew, his father will not let you off the hook, not to mention that you have a child whose father remains unknown."
###Chapter 385: Chapter 385: So What If I Fall in Love with Ou Mucen? No One Shall Take Away What’s His
"..." 
"What’s more, I forgot to tell you, do you really think Ou Mucen knows nothing about you? He’s actually been investigating you for a while now. Not only did he go to the address on that fake ID card to secretly look into things, but he also sent people to Ningzhou Prison to find ’Ye Ning.’ Ye Ning, don’t think he’s really that good." 
"Enough!!" 
The trembling girl finally couldn’t control herself any longer and yelled out loud, interrupting him! 
When had he become like this? 
So malicious! So ruthless! 
Not even giving a person a chance to breathe. 
She was shivering uncontrollably, like a leaf in the autumn wind, and big droplets of water kept rolling down from those collapsing, desperate, unfamiliar eyes onto her ghastly pale face. 
"You won!" 
Her lips were ashen, lifeless like a mechanical device, as she hollowly and woodenly uttered those three words. noveldrama
Lin Yebai saw this and suddenly felt a pang of panic at the bottom of his heart, "Aning..." 
"Don’t worry, I won’t seek him out anymore, you can rest easy!" she said word by word, devoid of expression, devoid of warmth, her gaze fixed on him, completely like that of a stranger. 
Lin Yebai opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but at this moment, she suddenly turned around, ready to leave. 
"Where are you going?" 
Lin Yebai saw this and finally began to fear, taking a quick stride over, he grabbed her: "Where are you going?" 
Ye Ning stumbled from his pull, but after stopping, her face still showed no expression: "I’ve already told you, I won’t see him again, you don’t need to be so anxious." 
"No, Aning, that’s not what I meant, I..." 
"Let’s go back to Tokyo, it’s time to go back!" 
She didn’t give him the chance to explain, reached out her hand, and one by one pried his fingers off, then she was ready to continue on her way. 
Lin Yebai watched as the blood gradually drained from his face, he had never seen her like this before, cold and resolute. It was as if she had completely changed into a different person, so unfamiliar it frightened him. 
That was the first time he had ever seen her like that in all these years! 
He knew that he had always been domineering and assertive in his dealings with her. Her life, her work, even her life choices—he had always made arrangements for her, and she, without any complaint, always remained grateful, respected him, tolerated him, treated him like her own family. 
But this time, she wasn’t like that anymore, she had finally been pushed into a corner by him and was starting to fight back. 
So, did that mean she wanted to leave him? 
No, he wouldn’t let her leave! 
His face turned deathly pale as he shook his head repeatedly... 
No, she had always belonged to him all these years, how could he let her go? 
"Fine! Then let’s go back together!" After saying that, his pupils shrank, and without waiting for her to pry his fingers loose, he suddenly clenched his hand, gripping her arm tightly in his palm once more. 
"What are you doing?" 
Ye Ning was startled, struggling hard. The look on her face as she stared at this man, whose behavior had suddenly changed so drastically, was truly one of utter terror. 
What had happened to him? What did he want to do? 
But what about this man? 
But what about this man? 
As if he couldn’t see her expression at all, with one grip of her hand, he forcefully pulled her into his embrace, then picked her up sideways and headed toward his car.
###Chapter 386: Chapter 386: Third Young Master, An Ning is Missing!
"Lin Yebai, what are you doing? Let go of me!" 
"..." 
No one answered her, the only response being those very rude and savage movements. 
It only took a few seconds, and she was shoved into the car, after which the door slammed shut, and the silver-grey Passat sped away from the place like an arrow released from its bow. 
—— 
Inside the cabin, Ou Mucen was still checking the emails on his computer. 
Not bad, although it was her first time dealing with such documents, she had handled them quite well, replying to what she knew how, as he had instructed, and for what she didn’t know, she also created a new folder, storing them there. 
When he saw that folder, his eyes, which were initially somewhat worried, unconsciously swept across a trace of approval and a faint curve emerged at the corner of his lips. 
Lying there, he processed all the emails she had left behind, only then, exhausted, did he set his computer aside. 
What time was it? Why hadn’t she come back yet? 
He glanced at his watch and saw that more than an hour had already passed, immediately his brows furrowed slightly. 
Just as he was about to take out his phone and call the medical station to check on her, suddenly, footsteps hurriedly approached from outside... 
"Young Master, something’s happened, Young Master!!" 
"..." 
Gao Ziyang? 
Why was he still here? 
His gaze darkened in an instant... 
It only took a few seconds, and the person from outside came in, indeed, wearing black-framed glasses, still clad in a plaid shirt, who else could it be but the secretary he had ordered to leave yesterday? 
"Young Master..." 
"Why are you still here? Didn’t I tell you to go back?" As soon as he opened his mouth, he began to question without any mercy. 
The secretary instantly flinched reflexively! 
Damn, he had come in such a hurry that he had forgotten about the President’s intimidating temper. 
So he quickly explained, "Miss Li said she didn’t want to go back last night, it was too late, and then we found a family in that village to stay with." 
Miss Li? 
That woman! 
At that statement, the man’s face in the room grew even more unsightly, "You didn’t want to go back, did you?" noveldrama
"Ah?" 
"Stay in Japan, Japan is nice!" 
The secretary: "..." 
Standing there, he pinched himself several times in succession, managing not to collapse: "No, Young Master, it’s not that Miss Li refused to leave, what could I do, carry her away? Young Master, let’s not talk about this, I came to tell you something very urgent." 
"What is it?" The man on the bed finally relaxed his fierce expression slightly. 
The secretary, seeing this, immediately knelt beside him, "On our way here, guess who we saw?" 
"Get to the point!" 
Ou Mucen’s expression was still not very pleasant. 
Seeing this, the secretary didn’t beat around the bush anymore, and handed over his phone, "It was Lin Yebai, he was driving a silver-grey Passat, right by the small river, and An Ning, she was there too." 
An Ning? 
At the mention of this name, the man lying on the bed finally changed his expression, took the phone, and stared at the screen as he pressed it. 
It was a video, the image wasn’t very clear, it was obvious that the angle was the issue, but, even so, he immediately recognized the person who was talking to a man next to the Passat, as the woman who had left him an hour ago.
###Chapter 387: Chapter 387: An Ning... Is He the Culprit Behind This?
So, she didn’t go out to buy noodles, but to meet this man? noveldrama
His gaze abruptly tightened, and the surrounding air seemed to grow colder in an instant, "Speak, what exactly happened?" 
Secretary Gao hurriedly lowered his head, "We just happened to come across them. We intended to find you, but unexpectedly ran into them on the way. When we arrived, An Ning was arguing with Lin Yebai, and we didn’t know what they were arguing about?" 
"Arguing?" 
"Yes, quite fiercely. Third Young Master, do you think Lin Yebai is blaming An Ning for being with you this time? When we originally went to find Lin Yebai, he said that An Ning had already returned to the country, but now she has appeared here. So, do you think Lin Yebai is upset about that?" 
"..." 
Ou Mucen’s eyes grew darker... 
Of course, he would be angry. As a man, he could clearly sense that the one called Lin Yebai had a different kind of feeling for that woman; their relationship wasn’t just a simple master-disciple one. 
He remembered the necklace Lin Yebai had eagerly wanted to give away at the banquet that night, and the furious expression when he was exposed. Finally, a mocking smile crossed his lips, "So what if he’s angry? In the end, hasn’t she still followed me?" 
Secretary Gao blinked! 
What did the president mean by that? The more he listened, the more something seemed off. 
Followed him? 
What kind of following is there between a president and an assistant? 
Secretary Gao felt the president had misunderstood him and added, "No, in the end, An Ning still left with him!" 
"What did you say? She left with him?" 
"Yes, as the two of them were arguing, Lin Yebai said something, and suddenly, An Ning became very, very angry. After shouting loudly, she was about to leave, but Lin Yebai suddenly grabbed her and took her away." 
"..." 
Lying there, the man took at least five seconds before uttering half a word, showing no reaction whatsoever! 
Took her away? 
Was he telling him that the woman was taken away by that man? 
Why? 
Why would he take her away? And, from what he knew of her, that woman wouldn’t ever get angry at her master. She would rather shoulder everything herself. 
Just like the last time with the jade material issue at his factory, she had been seriously injured by his car, but when Lin Yebai came looking for her, she still chose to meet him, not wanting their relationship to become strained. 
So what was it this time? What would make her so willing to fall out with him? 
His gaze finally started to churn, and at the same time, a very bad premonition began to rise from the depths of his heart. It was as if a violent storm was coming, an overwhelming oppression making it almost impossible for him to breathe.
"Before, I asked you to check if Ou Yuze had any connections at this exhibition. Did you find anything?" 
This... 
Secretary Gao, reminded thus, immediately remembered, "There is. I found out, and you know what, there really is a company that’s Ou Yuze’s." 
"Is that so?" 
"Yes, called Shifeng Trade. He registered it using another person’s name, but the major shareholder is him!" Saying this, Secretary Gao almost wanted to peel open the president’s head to see what was inside. 
How could he be so smart? How could he think of these connections to an incident that seemed totally unrelated to the domestic situation?
###Chapter 388: Chapter 388: He Finally Guessed the Truth
He sifted through the findings in his email and once again handed over his phone, "Now that we’ve looked into it, we can be sure that it was this company that pulled the strings with our bracelets. But Yu Ze, for an exhibition like this, our old man had to put in a lot of effort for us to participate. How did Ou Yuze’s new company manage to get in?" 
How did they get in? 
Mucen’s slender fingers scrolled through his phone until he saw that in the shareholders’ section, indeed the highest shares were under the name "Ou Yuze." And with that, the last bit of warmth vanished from his face. 
To get into a place like this, other than a formal invitation, the only other way would be through backdoor dealings. 
And for this backdoor, except for the judges, probably no one else would have the qualification... 
Judges... 
So that was the true nature of it! 
His heart clenched violently, as if a heavy stone had suddenly been pressed down, crushing his last bit of luck and smashing it into his heart, causing him such pain that even his vision darkened. 
No wonder she had suddenly turned back from the airport. No wonder she never really asked who exactly was after him on the trip. 
In the end, she was the one who wanted to kill him! 
Isn’t it ironic? 
He finally started to shake, tossing the phone aside, quickly pulling out the unfinished IV from the back of his hand, and he began to clumsily rise from the bed. 
"Yu Ze, Yu Ze, what are you doing?" Secretary Gao was terrified by this sight! 
But the man wouldn’t let him come any closer. Getting up from the bed, he roared, "Get the car ready!!" He then grabbed the clothes and pants on the bedside, covering his abdomen, and staggered into the restroom. 
Secretary Gao was shocked. He had no idea what had happened or why the president was suddenly so agitated and angry. noveldrama
Get the car ready? 
Was he going back to Tokyo? 
Cold sweat finally broke out on his forehead, and he rushed out of the room, going outside to find that woman. 
Meanwhile, in the courtyard outside the cottage, a beautiful woman wearing a new light blue starry sky long dress, was beginning to talk to a few nurses from the medical station, her beaming smile and cheerful voice almost spreading infectiously throughout the medical station. 
Indeed, she had a reason to be happy. Now, the cottage was finally left with only one woman. 
Engaged in a joyful chat, a frantic figure suddenly dashed out of the cottage, "Miss La, Yu Ze... Yu Ze is going back to Tokyo." 
"What? Back to Tokyo?" 
The smile on her face froze instantly upon hearing this. 
Why go back to Tokyo? Wasn’t everything fine here? Why the sudden return to Tokyo? 
She was somewhat baffled. Stepping out of the medical station, she couldn’t help but urgently ask, "Why go back to Tokyo all of a sudden? Didn’t you say we would stay here for a few more days?" 
Exactly, it was for that reason that she went through so much trouble to arrange everything. 
But the secretary knew nothing when asked, and just hurried her to get ready. 
Chenxi was losing patience. Looking back at the cottage, she bit her lip and finally mustered the courage to walk over. 
She didn’t want to return so soon; it had not been easy to get this opportunity. 
However, when she pushed the door open and saw the room, she discovered that the man who should have been lying in bed was now standing in the center.
###Chapter 389: Chapter 389: No, Your Death Has Nothing to Do with Me
The off-white, handmade casual shirt was paired with slim-fit black suit pants, which enveloped his long, straight legs. At that moment, he was adjusting the watch on his wrist. noveldrama
What was he doing? 
He had even changed his clothes; did this truly mean he was going back? 
She gazed at the tall, upright figure and, inexplicably, felt a wave of disappointment deep in her heart, "Mucen, I heard you’re going back? Your body hasn’t fully recovered yet. Long journeys could be bad for you." 
Ou Mucen was slightly bent over, tidying up his appearance! 
His wound was still very painful, almost preventing him from straightening his back, and what was even worse, due to excessive blood loss, the view outside the window seemed somewhat blurry to him after standing up. 
Even so, he didn’t stop adjusting his attire, fastening all the buttons on his shirt, including the two on his sleeves. 
When he heard the woman’s voice behind him, his fingers paused ever so slightly. After a moment, a voice devoid of warmth spilled from his pale, bloodless lips, "This is all your doing, isn’t it?" 
"What?" 
La Chenxi’s complexion instantly turned pale! 
What was he saying? 
Claiming that all of this was her doing? She... 
"Mucen, I..." 
"You don’t need to deny it. If no one had specifically tipped off Lin Yebai, with the arrangements I made, it would have been impossible for him to find this place. Also, coming so late on purpose today was to make sure Gao Ziyang saw the two of them meeting, right?" 
He spoke coolly and emotionlessly, his tone so calm that it appeared as if he were discussing the most mundane matter. 
Yet, to the woman behind him, this tranquil tone seemed like the most terrifying sound from hell; with every word he uttered, with every sentence he spoke, she felt herself falling deeper into a horrific abyss. 
Eventually, after he finished speaking, she had plummeted into hell itself. 
"Mucen, I... I just wanted you to know, that woman is not a good woman at all. She has an unclear relationship with that man surnamed Lin, and she came here to seduce you. Mucen, she really doesn’t deserve someone like you!" 
"What do you mean by ’deserve’? Do you think you, La Chenxi, are deserving?" 
He finally turned around, his features still resplendent and refined, but his eyes were like a cold lake under the bright light outside the window, full of scorn and icy mockery, chilling and frightening to behold. 
"Let me tell you, La Chenxi, in my eyes, any woman has more rights than you do!" He stared at her as he enunciated every word, with neither pity nor tenderness. 
At that moment, in his eyes, she was truly less than a stranger. 
La Chenxi finally despaired, staring blankly as he gathered his things, then stooped to pick up the notebook and walked past her. Finally, she trembled all over and tears started to fall, "What exactly do you want me to do? Will you only forgive me if I die?" 
"..." 
No! 
Even if you died, it would have nothing to do with me! 
Without any hesitation, he took the notebook and left...
The woman was left alone in the room. Her lips trembled fiercely, and her body swayed before she finally collapsed to the floor in tears... 
Who was there to blame?
###Chapter 390: Chapter 390: Back to Tokyo!
When he sincerely cared for you, you didn’t cherish it, thinking that everything was more important than him. You left whenever you wanted, stayed whenever you felt like it. Did you really think he was your personal property to be discarded and taken back whenever you wished? 
What a fantasy! 
Secretary Gao heard the crying and arguing from outside and saw Mr. Lin finally coming out, so he immediately went over to him, his face pale as snow, "Mr. Lin, I..." 
"Drive!" 
"..." 
Without saying anything more, Secretary Gao got into the car and sped out of the yard. 
This was probably the first time in all the years he had followed him that he had been used like this. 
He had thought that Ms. Li was the President’s ex-girlfriend, and that she had come here this time fully intent on reconciling with the President, so she surely wouldn’t have any ulterior motives and would be wholeheartedly looking out for the President’s best interests. 
But what he hadn’t anticipated was that his trust in her would be met with her exploitation of him! 
Thinking back to how she had taken pictures of that cottage last night, and how she had deliberately led him down that path this morning, Secretary Gao wished he could slap himself. 
Fool! 
You’re such a fool! 
—— 
Two hours later, Tokyo- 
"Mr. Lin, where are we going? Back to the hotel?" 
"To the airport!" 
The airport?
Secretary Gao glanced in the rearview mirror at the man leaning back behind him, who already looked very pale, and his expression changed slightly. 
He was already in this state, yet he still wanted to go to the airport? It was about a half-hour’s drive from here to the airport. 
Secretary Gao was somewhat worried, "Mr. Lin, we’ve already been driving for more than two hours. You’ve just had surgery, and your body won’t be able to take it. Maybe we should..." 
"If I tell you to go, you just go! Why do you talk so much? Do you not want your job anymore?" Suddenly, he erupted in anger. Tremendous sweat rolled down his forehead, and his body bent over from the surge of fury. 
Seeing this reaction, Secretary Gao didn’t dare say another word. He stepped on the gas and steered the car towards the airport expressway. 
What exactly was the President trying to do? Could it be that he still wanted to intercept those two? 
He must be out of his mind. It had been a full three hours since the incident, and even Mr. Lin had only just rushed back from that place. Considering how much earlier the others had left, how could they possibly not have boarded the plane yet? noveldrama
Besides, who could guarantee that they were heading back home? Perhaps they had decided to stay in Japan. 
Secretary Gao couldn’t help but think that his boss must be delusional. 
But the reality was, at this very moment, Mr. Lin indeed was at the airport with Ye Ning, and since her true passport and ID had been destroyed with the luggage in the explosion, he had no choice but to stay and figure something out. 
"Sir, there’s no other way, we can only use a fake identity now." 
"Can we board the plane without any trouble?" 
"Yes, but we have to wait a bit—about forty-five minutes." 
Forty-five minutes? 
The man in the departure hall looked at his watch and frowned, "Is it going to take that long?" 
Xiaojin started to sweat a little, "It’s already the fastest we can do. After getting it, he still needs to bring it to the airport, which takes time." 
"..." 
The air paused again for several seconds, and after a while, the man looked at the LED display screen showing boarding times and nodded, "Hurry up. How did you handle the things I told you to do before?"
###Chapter 391: Chapter 391: A Hair Trigger!
Something you needed to take care of? 
Xiaojin glanced around, then quickly nodded, "It’s done, but sir, will that person really come after us?!!" 
Is there still a need to question that? 
The man standing in front of the display screen let out a cold laugh, "Xiaojin, let me remind you, he is far more intelligent than you and I can imagine. You had better not underestimate him, or you’ll have no idea how you died!" 
The final sentence was delivered with a severe tone! 
Upon hearing this, Xiaojin did not dare to say more and promptly took his leave to get to work. 
With the assistant gone, quietness returned to his ears. Lin Yebai looked at the girl who sat motionless behind him, pursed his lips, and finally, he stood up to get two bottles of mineral water from the vending machine opposite. 
"Would you like some water?" 
"..." 
No one paid attention to him. The girl in front of him sat there, staring blankly at some fixed point ahead, acting as if he did not exist at all, her expressionless face, impassive. 
Seeing this, Lin Yebai felt an unexplained irritation swell inside. Holding the two bottles of water, he took a seat next to her, "Aning, I know anything I say now is futile, but Ye Ning, I am doing this for your own good." 
"..." 
Not even glancing at him, the girl turned her gaze elsewhere. 
Seeing this, a touch of anger finally sparked in Lin Yebai’s chest, "Aning, is he really that important to you? Just because I made a move against him, have you decided that you will never speak to me again?" 
"..." 
Focusing on that spot, she watched that place for a long, long time until at last, she turned around and took the bottle of water from his hand. 
She really wasn’t such a heartless person. The kindness he showed her, she would never forget it for her entire life. 
However, not forgetting did not mean that he could do whatever he wanted with her. She was a person, a living breathing person. If it really came to that, she would rather that he hadn’t saved her in the first place. 
"Don’t hurt him anymore, I will go back with you!" 
She held onto the bottle of water and finally spoke for the first time since he had forcibly taken her into the car, her voice very faint, her tone, extremely calm.
However, after these words were uttered, the man sitting beside her felt his heart suddenly sink to the bottom! 
Was she still doubting that he would harm him? 
How much did she care about him? noveldrama
He finally began to laugh, "Aning, aren’t you underestimating him a little? Do you think with me like this, I could still hurt him?" 
Ye Ning said nothing more, but her expression, quite clearly, showed that she had begun to distrust his words. 
Lin Yebai’s expression altered and at last, he stood up from the chair. It was at this moment his phone, placed upon him, rang, so he immediately answered, "Hello..." 
"Sir, I see a white Cadillac coming this way towards the airport. Could it be Ou Mucen?" 
"..." 
A white Cadillac? 
Lin Yebai thought of the car driven by the young Mistress of the La Family and abruptly, his eyes changed as he hastily said, "I see. Once you are done, come here. I’ll take Aning inside." 
After speaking, he hung up the phone. 
Ye Ning did not know what had happened, but seeing him approaching her, she subconsciously shrank back, "What’s wrong?"
###Chapter 392: Chapter 392 He’s Coming...
Lin Yebai felt a pang of discomfort and self-reproach as he observed her reaction. 
In her dealings with him, she had always shown respect, trust, and dependence, never like this before. But now, as he approached her, he could see in those beautiful eyes a flicker of fear, a hint of evasion, as if one more step would mean harming her. 
Recalling how he had brought her here in such an abrasive manner not long ago, he finally stopped in his tracks. "No, it’s just that Xiaojin called and said your fake ID and passport will arrive soon. We can go to the waiting area." 
"Oh..." 
Hearing that, the wariness in her eyes seemed to lessen. 
So, she stood up, taking the bottle of water with her, and followed behind him. 
Seeing this, Lin Yebai said nothing more and led her towards the departure lounge on the second floor. 
Tokyo’s Narita International Airport is very large. Each international flight’s departure gate is quite some distance away. So, to catch their flight home, they needed to go to the departure hall in Zone A on the second floor to enter the lounge. 
However, just as they were about to step onto the elevator, sudden commotion arose at the entrance of the waiting hall—the very place Ye Ning had been seated facing the entrance. 
Ye Ning, walking behind, turned her head upon hearing the noise... 
"It’s definitely the CEO of the Ou Group; look, he has finally arrived!" 
"My God, he really isn’t dead. Quick, photographers, follow!" 
"Hurry up, this is a front-page story, come on!" 
"..." 
In less than a minute, the once suspicious-looking crowd Ye Ning had observed, now armed with cameras and microphones, surged towards the entrance. 
As it turned out, they were reporters! 
Ye Ning watched in surprise, curious as to whom they were surrounding. But just then, a hand unexpectedly reached out, grabbing her arm tightly. "Why aren’t you moving? We’re running out of time!" 
Ye Ning glanced back, about to say something, but the person was already pulling her briskly towards the escalator. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning said nothing, frowned slightly, and followed him.
The entrance was still quite far from their position. It was understandable that she couldn’t hear what they were saying, but neither of them expected that as reporters crowded the entrance, the number of onlookers began to grow more and more... noveldrama
"Mr. Ou, there were reports that you had met with misfortune; can you tell us what really happened?" 
"Mr. Ou, we’re truly relieved to see you safe. Can you explain what happened at that time?" 
"Mr. Ou, has the Japanese police been informed about the incident?" 
"Mr. Ou..." 
"..." 
They were two people who, caught in a stream of bodies, couldn’t move forward at all. Cameras were everywhere, microphones surrounded them, and the crowd, as if having planned it, completely blocked off any passage as soon as they appeared. 
Ye Ning had intended to take the elevator, but as she overheard passersby seemingly mentioning "Ou Group," a sudden flutter stirred in her heart, and her steps slowed.
###Chapter 393: Chapter 393 She Jumped Down from the Elevator
Ou Corporation? 
What Ou Corporation? Why are they mentioning Ou Corporation? 
"Aning, hurry up!" The man ahead, who had been holding her hand without letting go, was still urging her. 
Ye Ning opened her mouth and looked around, only to find those voices had disappeared. Her gaze dimmed, and finally, she caught up... 
Maybe she was overthinking it. How could he possibly be here, right? 
Maybe he hadn’t even realized she was gone yet? 
As she recalled the excuse she had made before leaving the cabin, an even bitterer taste arose in the depths of her eyes. It was at this moment, in the midst of the crowd, that someone suddenly shouted, "Third Young Master, An Ning is there!!" 
An Ning?!! 
As the name fell, her footsteps immediately halted! 
Did she hear someone behind her calling for An Ning? 
"An Ning, stop right there! The Third Young Master has something for you!" 
Once again, the call came through, loud and clear! 
When Ye Ning heard it, she finally stopped hesitating. After her heart skipped a beat, she turned around on the escalator that was slowly rising. 
Indeed, in that crowd, the man wearing a plaid shirt, fiercely protecting someone as he squeezed his way outside—if not Secretary Gao, then who? And in front of him, the man he was desperately guarding with both hands, keeping the reporters and onlookers from harming—wasn’t it the very man she had dared not even think about a moment ago? 
Ou Mucen, he had actually come! 
She felt as if struck by lightning, staring blankly at the young man who, crowded by the moving throng, could hardly move, but when he heard she was here, his gaze immediately looked past the surging crowd in her direction. 
That was an indecipherable look, as profound as the night sky, with alternating shades of light and dark in his ink-black pupils, devoid of any light, betraying no emotion. 
Ye Ning suddenly shuddered, because in her mind, she had recalled a different look in those eyes over these past few days. 
Like a gentle spring breeze, soft, although brief, whenever it surfaced in those beautiful eyes, she would always catch it. And at such times, a pleasing curve always appeared at the edges of his thin lips. noveldrama
That must have been when she was in her happiest moments! 
But now, such a look was gone, replaced by an icy, profound darkness, as if the surface of a lake in the dead of winter, making one feel miserable even with a mere glance. 
Did he find out something? 
No, things weren’t as he thought, not at all, she needed to explain it to him, clear things up. 
With that thought burgeoning in her heart, she immediately started walking back, and at this time, the escalator she was on was almost at the top. 
"Aning, where are you going?" Lin Yebai, who was waiting for her reaction behind her, saw her choosing to walk down directly on this elevator after seeing that man. He was utterly disappointed, quickly stepping over to pull her back. 
This escalator was going up, but now, she was going down! 
Crazy! 
She must be crazy!
Lin Yebai’s eyes reddened with urgency, and jumping down as well, he hurriedly chased after her: "Aning, come back to me!" 
"..." 
However, it was as if the woman couldn’t hear his shouting at all. Despite the danger here, she still stubbornly leaped down step by step from above.
###Chapter 394: Chapter 394: Don’t go over there, I beg you!
The sudden danger not only left Lin Yebai with a pale face but even caused Ou Mucen below to narrow his eyes fiercely. 
"Move aside!" 
"Mr. Ou..." 
"I told you to move aside, didn’t you hear me?" He finally lost his temper and let out a roar of rage, scaring the surrounding reporters so much that they even forgot what they wanted to ask. 
Upon seeing this, the secretary Gao quickly stepped forward, pushing away the reporters blocking the way, and escorted his BOSS out. 
However, just as the two men finally broke through, the man who had been chasing the girl finally caught up with her. The moment he grabbed her, he pulled her onto himself as if he had gone mad and held her tight! 
"Don’t come over, I beg you!" 
In the moment he held her, he also whispered in her ear with the most humble tone he would ever use. 
Time seemed to freeze, and at that moment, whether it was Ye Ning being embraced or Ou Mucen who had just charged out of the encirclement, both became unresponsive. The scene appeared as if it were frozen, all sounds and figures fading away except for the two in the embrace. 
"He’s coming to you now because he hasn’t fully confirmed your true identity. If he finds out that you’re Ye Ning, the foster daughter of the Ou Family from five years ago, that you’ve come to his side just to use him for revenge, do you think he’ll forgive you?" 
"..." 
The girl he was holding finally shuddered, her body’s warmth fading away bit by bit. 
Lin Yebai held her tightly, feeling her tremble repeatedly, part of him was reluctant, and it also pained him, but in the end, he gritted his teeth and whispered in her ear the final sentence, "And with this incident, even though you didn’t take part, given the relationship between me and you, if he finds out it was me who did it, do you think he’ll believe you’re innocent?" 
"Enough! Stop talking!" 
She finally started to shiver all over, her clenched fingers making a creaking noise. 
Seeing her reaction, Lin Yebai finally stopped speaking. After casting a cold glance at the man standing across from them, he released her, then changed the way he was holding her trembling body, wrapping his large palm around her cold little hands.
Secretary Gao, witnessing this, became so angry that he was about to rush over: "An Ning, what on earth are you doing? Don’t you know that the Third Young Master..." 
"Enough!" noveldrama
He had uttered just a few words when a thunderous shout from behind cut off all other sounds and movements in the area. 
Ye Ning was suddenly jolted, her body freezing up on the spot! 
This was an atmosphere more terrifying than death, dangerous, cold, bloodthirsty—everything seemed to have come together in that moment, creating a tumultuous dark storm that even the onlookers felt an uncontrollable fear gripping them. 
This was true murderous intent! 
"Do you really think I wouldn’t dare kill you?" 
"Of course not, but Mr. Ou, killing is easy, but if you kill someone and then get yourself locked up, it won’t be worth it." Lin Yebai’s response was quick, and his tone was relatively more relaxed. 
Indeed, at this time, he could afford to be relaxed, because the person Ou Mucen had just mentioned he would kill was not "you" but "you all"!
###Chapter 395: Chapter 395 Lin Yebai, I Hate You!
She was even listed among those he wanted to "kill," which meant he must have hated her to the bone by now. 
Lin Yebai gripped the girl’s hand next to him even tighter, "Mr. Ou, if there’s nothing else, we’ll be leaving now. We have a flight to catch, and it’s about to take off."
After saying that, he smiled and was about to lead her away. 
Ou Mucen, standing opposite, seethed with fury to the extreme and responded with a ghostly smile, "You can’t leave. Anything I, Ou Mucen, wish to keep has never slipped away." 
As his words fell, the sound of police sirens suddenly came from outside the hall. 
This bastard, he actually played this trick? noveldrama
Upon seeing this, Lin Yebai’s face finally changed. Staring at the man opposite him, a fierce determination flashed through his eyes, which began to look particularly terrifying, "Ou Mucen, you will regret this!" 
Ou Mucen laughed, "The thing I regret most is trusting someone I shouldn’t have trusted!" 
As these words dropped, Ye Ning, who was standing amidst the chaos, felt like she was viciously stabbed once again, her lips losing all color. 
He indeed had given her his unconditional trust, but what did she do to him? 
Ye Ning’s chest felt as if it was gripped tightly by an invisible hand, the discomfort made her lower her head. She wanted to do something, but suddenly, she saw the man holding her hand make some sort of gesture with his other hand. 
What was that? 
Before she could get a clear look at what it was, suddenly, a flurry of screams erupted in front of her. When she looked up, the man who had been standing in front of her was suddenly tackled to the ground by a journalist carrying a camera! 
"Third Young Master! Third Young Master!!" 
It was definitely a bizarre situation. The incident happened so suddenly that even Secretary Gao, standing next to him, couldn’t stop it, and the journalist along with the camera crashed onto him. 
How could this happen? 
No, it couldn’t be possible. This just couldn’t be possible! 
Ye Ning’s mouth gaped open, staring dumbfounded at the figure who collapsed to the ground in an instant, her entire expression was one of shock... 
"Aning, let’s go quickly!" 
"I won’t go! You lunatic! You murderer!" she finally erupted, hysterically yelling at him. Afterward, she broke free and ran toward the front like a madwoman. 
Yes, he was a lunatic, a brutal, merciless killer. How could he do this? How could he do this? 
Sobbing, she rushed over, pushing through the crowd, not caring about anything else. She wanted to save him, but she only managed to see how he lay on the ground, and the pool of crimson blood flowing out from his body on the floor, when a strong force pulled her from behind, and quickly, she was easily taken away again. 
"Lin Yebai, I hate you!" 
When she was brought back, this was the first thing she said to him. 
Lin Yebai’s face turned from blue to white, from white to gray, but in the end, he just twitched the corners of his mouth and responded, "Whatever!" Then, he completely disappeared from there with her. 
Meanwhile, Secretary Gao, due to the CEO’s sudden accident, had already forgotten about the two of them until he and others moved the journalist who fell onto the CEO, as well as the camera. Kneeling in front of him, he then heard his barely audible words, "Catch her..." 
Her? 
Right, where was that woman?
###Chapter 396: Chapter 396: The Old Master Came Over
He finally remembered the incident, so he immediately started looking around him, but at this point, in the waiting hall, where could the figures of those two people be? 
An Ning, you’ve really let people down... noveldrama
—— 
When Ji Chengzhi received the news and rushed to Tokyo from A City with the old master, Ou Mucen was still unconscious in the intensive care unit. 
"He’s badly injured. He had just had surgery for a ruptured spleen two days ago, and now he’s been crushed by a heavy . The old wounds have all reopened, and even the parts that weren’t damaged before have started to crack." 
Seeing the family members arrive, the head physician responsible for him immediately updated them on his condition. 
The senior Mr. Ou, upon hearing this, was so frightened he could barely stand steady: "Is it serious? Chengzhi, ask him, is it serious?" 
The old master was extremely protective of this son; he couldn’t bear to see him even slightly injured, let alone such a serious one. 
Understanding his feelings, Ji Chengzhi hurriedly reassured him: "He’ll be fine. As long as he spends 24 hours in the ICU, he’ll wake up tomorrow and be alright." 
"Really?" 
"Of course it’s true!" Ji Chengzhi, fearing the old master might become overly anxious and fall ill himself, quickly coaxed and persuaded him. 
Fortunately, the old master trusted his words, so after inquiring with the doctor, Ji Chengzhi took him back to the hotel first. 
After the old master returned to the hotel, Ji Chengzhi stayed at the hospital and began to inquire about the incident with Secretary Gao... 
"At first, the Third Young Master asked me to investigate Ou Yuze, and I did find out indeed Ou Yuze has issues. But later, after he heard me say that An Ning was taken away by Lin Yebai, he asked me to chase after the two of them." 
Secretary Gao didn’t fully understand the whole situation, as Ou Mucen had not revealed the part about An Ning to him. 
Yes, Ou Mucen was the kind of person who did not like to share all his secrets with people around him, not even with a good friend like Ji Chengzhi, let alone Gao Ziyang, who was just his secretary. 
So, when it came to this matter, Secretary Gao could only rely on his own guesses, but regardless, from the moment the CEO asked him to intercept people at the airport, and he notified the police, he felt that something was amiss. 
Ji Chengzhi also frowned: "You mean... the person who tried to kill him isn’t just Ou Yuze?" 
Secretary Gao nodded: "It should be so. This time, the Third Young Master asked me to go to the airport specifically to intercept An Ning and her master." 
"An Ning?" 
Ji Chengzhi was taken aback: "You mean his assistant An Ning?" 
Secretary Gao uttered a confirmation: "We were originally in a small town, and after the Third Young Master was chased and fell into the sea, An Ning was with him, took him to that small town for treatment, and then Lin Yebai came and took An Ning away directly." 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
Standing there, he took a long time to process this, still finding it hard to accept this reality. 
That woman was actually involved in this? 
It was too hard to believe; his brother had developed feelings for that woman... 
He remembered the time in the hospital when the man had already shown various kinds of care and sympathy for the woman; finally, out of his discomfort, he also started to feel some anger: "Who exactly is she? What is her purpose in coming into Mucen’s life?" 
"The Third Young Master once had me investigate her identity, he suspected..."
###Chapter 397: Chapter 397: La Chenxi, look at what you’ve become now?
"Suspect what?" 
"That she’s involved with Ou Yuze!" Secretary Gao ultimately couldn’t hold back and blurted it out, not for any other reason but because the man before him was the President’s best friend and the one he trusted the most. 
Ou Yuze? 
Ji Chengzhi was struck by the mention and stood there in shock on the spot! 
How could it be Ou Yuze? 
This was quite unexpected, wasn’t it? 
Just as Ji Chengzhi was about to respond, the sound of high heels clacking rapidly down the corridor suddenly approached, and both men turned to look, immediately spotting a woman in a white dress sprinting toward them. 
It was La Chenxi, she actually came as well? 
Upon seeing this, Secretary Gao immediately shut his mouth, and at the same time, his complexion darkened instantly, "Doctor Ji, I’m going to check on the young master of the Ou family." 
After speaking, he left! 
After seeing the woman appear, Ji Chengzhi felt no fondness either, but out of politeness, he still stood there waiting for her... 
"Chengzhi, you’re here? That’s really wonderful. How is Mucen?" When the woman approached, seeing Ji Chengzhi standing in the corridor, her eyes immediately lit up. 
Indeed, Ji Chengzhi was a doctor, and if he was here, things would get much easier. 
Ji Chengzhi looked at her indifferently, his expression very calm, "The surgery was very successful, now we just wait for him to wake up." 
"Is that so? That’s truly excellent, you have no idea how anxious I was when I heard he had an accident." 
La Chenxi patted her chest and took a long breath, the tension and fear on her face didn’t seem to be feigned. 
Ji Chengzhi said nothing but pulled out a cigarette, lit it, and began to intermittently smoke in the corridor. 
La Chenxi, upon seeing this, suddenly felt a bit aggrieved, "Chengzhi, you know, this incident, it was all because of that woman named An Ning that it was triggered." 
"An Ning?" noveldrama
"Yes, his newly hired assistant, do you know her? If it hadn’t been for her running away with that Mr. Lin, Mucen wouldn’t have gone to Tokyo in a fit of anger and gotten hit by the camera. All of this, it’s all her fault." 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
Suddenly, he lost all interest in speaking, fiercely stubbed out the just-lit cigarette into a nearby trash bin, and for the first time, his tone was filled with such distaste, "La Chenxi, how have you become like this?" 
"What did you say?" 
"Do you know why, out of so many girls in school, Mucen only took a fancy to you?" 
La Chenxi’s face suddenly stiffened, "Why?" 
Ji Chengzhi spoke word by word, "Because back then you were kind, pure, he said you were like a blank piece of paper, and he liked that feeling. But now look at what you’ve become? You stop at nothing to achieve your goals, and now that an accident has happened, you even frame others. Sister La, don’t you find your actions disgusting?" 
"I..." 
The woman who was full of arrogance finally had her face scolded to the color of a liver. 
Indeed, La Chenxi during university was the goddess many men dreamed of—beautiful, innocent, clean, and most importantly, as the daughter of a diplomat, she was exceedingly kind and considerate, traits the young master of the Ou family from A City never had the chance to witness. 
Boys are probably all like that, at the age of seventeen or eighteen, somewhat rebellious, rather inexperienced, when they encounter something so beautiful, they’re bound to fall for it.
###Chapter 398: Chapter 398: He Woke Up
Moreover, at that time, he had hidden his family background to get in, losing the prominent status and the attendants who answered his every call. Suddenly, there was this girl who cared for him, looked after him, it was inevitable that he would be moved. 
So, in the following years, the third young master of the Ou Family, who never lingered over women, for the first time, paused for a girl. 
La Chenxi’s hands trembled as she tried to speak but found that she really couldn’t utter a single word... 
Disgust? 
In her entire life, she had never heard anyone use such a word to describe her! 
Ji Chengzhi’s brow was deeply furrowed, and seeing her standing there, her complexion turning red then pale, then pale to the point of being ashen, as if a dye workshop had opened on her face, made him feel even more uncomfortable. Brushing off the ash on his clothes, he turned and left the place. 
In fact, in his eyes back then, she was also very beautiful! 
Coming through the corridor, it just so happened that the secretary informed him that the third young master seemed to have woken up inside. Upon hearing this, he immediately asked him to call the doctor, then he went to look inside through the glass window. 
Indeed, he had woken up. There were fluctuations on the heart rate monitor, and he saw his eyelids flutter behind the oxygen mask. 
Mucen... 
After waiting a while, the doctor arrived and after seeing the situation, immediately pushed the door and went in. 
Ji Chengzhi, being a doctor, knew that when a patient in the ICU woke up, it usually meant their condition had stabilized. So after the doctor checked and found no major issues, he requested to go in for a visit. 
The doctor, knowing that he was also a physician, did not refuse him, and after the nurse brought a set of sterile clothing for him, Ji Chengzhi entered. 
Inside the ICU, Ji Chengzhi finally got to see the man lying on the hospital bed with numerous tubes inserted into him from a close distance... 
He felt a bitter sadness and discomfort. After so many years, it was the first time he saw him in this condition, lying here. Before this, the image of this man had always been that of a powerful presence—dominating, vigorous, and full of life. When had he ever seen him lying down in a place like this? 
Ji Chengzhi walked over and saw the person lying there, his eyes opened but because he had just awakened, his focus was still somewhat blurry. So he came closer and softly called out, "Mucen? It’s Chengzhi." 
Chengzhi? 
Ji Chengzhi has come? 
Hearing this voice, the man who had been searching aimlessly finally slowly turned his gaze towards him. When he saw that there indeed was a familiar figure in the light and shadow, his colorless lips moved, "Chengzhi..." 
"Yeah, it’s me. Do you feel a bit better?" noveldrama
"..." 
Hearing it was him, he struggled to move, and after a while, he barely gave a slight nod, "You... why are you here?" 
Ji Chengzhi quickly leaned in closer, "Uncle called me, and then I also saw the news, so I immediately came over with him." 
Uncle? 
Was he saying... his father had also come? 
As soon as he realized, he suddenly became anxious and wanted to say something, but the sudden bout of gasping made his chest and abdomen sharply painful. Instantly, after a shiver, large beads of cold sweat broke out on his forehead. 
"Mucen, don’t panic, uncle is fine, I’ve calmed him down. Mucen, don’t worry."
###Chapter 399: Chapter 399: The First Words Upon Waking, Have the Person Been Caught?
Ji Chengzhi really knew him too well; as soon as he heard the beeping of the heart monitor losing frequency, he immediately came over and held his hand tightly, comforting him. 
Of course, he would worry about his dad. These two, despite their usual cold confrontations and half-hearted conversations at home, actually cared for each other no less than any other father and son. 
So, hearing that the old man had arrived, he naturally worried that he wouldn’t be able to bear seeing his son with such severe injuries. 
Luckily, after being soothed by him, his emotions eventually calmed down, but as they did, his whole body looked as if he had just been pulled out of water. 
Seeing this, Ji Chengzhi quickly brought over some sterilized gauze: "Mucen, don’t worry. When you woke up earlier, I had already called Uncle to reassure him. He should be arriving at the hospital soon." 
"Mm..." 
He hummed a response and finally lay still. 
Seeing this, Ji Chengzhi gently wiped the sweat from his forehead with the gauze. He was about to check his wounds again when suddenly he asked, "Have they... been caught?" 
Caught? 
Was he referring to the ones surnamed Lin and that woman? 
Ji Chengzhi’s brow furrowed tightly: "Mucen, don’t rush about this matter. Wait until you recover. Once we return, there’s no way they can escape."
No way they can escape? 
So, that meant they hadn’t been caught yet? 
His half-closed eyes moved slightly, and for some reason, Ji Chengzhi, standing beside him, thought he heard him sigh in relief... 
"Mucen?" 
"Secretary Gao has a copy of an investigative report on Ou Yuze... give it to my dad." noveldrama
Ou Yuze? 
Ji Chengzhi paused, "Is it the evidence of his plot to kill you?" 
Ou Mucen gave a tired hum: "When you give it to him, remember... don’t upset him..." 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
What a time to be thinking about that. 
However, his words did remind Ji Chengzhi of that family’s scandal, prompting him to finally ask, "So, you’re really going to turn against them this time?" 
Turn against them? 
The man lying on the hospital bed chuckled coldly: "Do you think I still need to show them... any mercy?" 
Ji Chengzhi was silenced! 
Indeed, he no longer needed to. His brother had done so much to him; why should he show any mercy? 
In the past, although he had consistently dealt them crushing defeats, he had always considered the harmony of the household and the health of the old man, never being too ruthless and always leaving them a way out. But what was the reward he received now? 
Ji Chengzhi decided to do as he was told. 
After discussing this, Ji Chengzhi wanted to ask about the airport incident and that woman, but since the man had become groggy after talking for a while, he didn’t disturb him further. After leaving some instructions, he stepped out of the intensive care unit. 
Nevermind, it would be better to wait until he had improved to ask about the incident. The immediate priority was to take care of the matters he had been entrusted with. 
So, leaving the intensive care unit, he went straight to the hotel to find the old man, taking Secretary Gao with him. 
—— 
Meanwhile, at Blue Mountain Villa in A City, after learning that Ou Mucen hadn’t died, the second branch of the Ou Family was in utter chaos! 
"What happened? Didn’t you say you had killed him? Why is he still alive? What do we do now? He’s still alive and well, and your grandfather has already gone there. Tell me, what should we do? What should we do?"
###Chapter 400: Chapter 400 Impending Disaster
Mei Liping was the first to lose her composure. As soon as she heard the old master had also gone to Tokyo, she immediately pointed at her son sitting on the sofa and started scolding him. 
Ou Yuze was already frustrated. Upon hearing this, he opened his mouth to retort, "How was I supposed to know he’d be so tough? I saw with my own eyes his car getting smashed off the cliff. If he doesn’t die, what can I do?" 
"You—" noveldrama
"Enough, stop arguing. Every time something happens, all you know is to quarrel. What’s the use?" 
Right in the midst of their intense argument, Ou Muyuan, who had also come back after hearing the news, saw the two of them in the living room and couldn’t contain his anger, interrupting them both. 
As it was, what could these two do? Aside from blaming each other and shirking responsibility when trouble arose, what else were they capable of? 
He stormed in, anger radiating from him, and behind him followed a woman! 
Ou Yuze, sitting on the sofa, saw her and his eyes instantly showed displeasure, "Why are you here? Didn’t I tell you not to come over if it’s not necessary?" 
The woman instantly shuddered, "I... I came because I heard there was an incident, just to check on things." 
As soon as she finished speaking, Mei Liping—who had just been arguing with her son—immediately directed two sharp glares at the woman, "Yang Xueshan, could it be that this was your idea again?" 
"No, no, it wasn’t me, Auntie, I just..." 
"Alright, it was my decision. She just helped me plan it a bit, Mom, do you really need to make such a fuss? Now that he hasn’t found out it was us, what are you so anxious about?" 
The woman hadn’t even spoken two sentences, and Ou Yuze interrupted his own mother. 
Upon hearing this, Mei Liping finally seemed to relax a bit, "You’re telling the truth?" 
Yang Xueshan hurriedly nodded at the side, "Yes, Auntie, when we were planning this initially, we contracted another person for the job. Anyone who appeared publicly was that person, not Yuze." 
"Who?" 
"A judge surnamed Lin, known to Yuze. He’s a big shot in the antiques world in A City. With him involved, even if Mucen is clever, he won’t be able to trace it back to us." 
"What you mean is...?" 
"Based on the news I just received, the accident Mucen had at Tokyo Narita Airport happened because he was pursuing this Mr. Lin, so it’s certain that Mr. Lin has become our scapegoat."
Upon saying this, the woman couldn’t help but feel a sense of superiority. 
Indeed, she had been worried and afraid when the issue first erupted. But as events unfolded in Tokyo, she had inquired about the situation there and, upon hearing the circumstances, her worries had eased. 
Correct. They hadn’t thought of this initially while planning, but unexpectedly, due to a stroke of luck, that man ended up becoming their scapegoat. 
After hearing this explanation, Mei Liping’s heart, which had been in her throat, finally began to settle somewhat. 
As long as there was a scapegoat, that was all that mattered. With a scapegoat in place, they had nothing to fear. 
Thus, the family sat back down, and even Yang Xueshan, who was usually not well-received, was allowed to stay for dinner. 
However, what they hadn’t anticipated was that before dinner had even finished, Bai Tingfang from Bamboo Garden burst in with the butler and servants, seething with rage, "Men, tie up this murderer. Wait for the master to come back tomorrow and deal with him!"
###Chapter 401: Chapter 401 The Second Branch of the Ou Family is Finished...
"Yes, ma’am!" 
Within less than a minute, those people barged in and grabbed Ou Yuze, who was eating. 
Seeing this, Mei Liping and Ou Muyuan stood up from their chairs in shock and anger, "Bai Tingfang, what are you doing? Who gave you the audacity to arrest him? Do you no longer wish to stay in this garden?" 
A roar of fury, he showed no regard for his stepmother, as if he, Ou Muyuan, were the master of this garden. 
But who was Bai Tingfang? 
Not to mention they already had evidence in hand of their son attempting to kill hers, even on a normal day, the authority she wielded in their presence was insurmountable. 
Gazing at them with a ghastly, bitter smile, she pronounced word by word, "Just wait and see who truly doesn’t want to stay in this garden!" 
"You—" 
"Muyuan, enough, there’s no point arguing with her!" At the crucial moment, it was Mei Liping who first regained her composure. Seeing that things were amiss, she quickly grabbed her husband with force. 
This was indeed a dire situation, and the atmosphere made her feel strongly that it was not looking good. noveldrama
Bai Tingfang stared coldly at her, aware that the shrewdest person in the family was this woman named Mei Liping. Over the years, had it not been for her, their second branch would have likely fallen long ago. 
Therefore, when she saw Mei Liping holding her husband back, she just stood there and sneered coldly: "Mei Liping, remember this, however your son treated my son, I will make sure he repays it a thousand-fold. Just you wait and see." 
After speaking, she didn’t look at them anymore and left with the arrested young master of the Ou Family. 
Left behind, Mei Liping and the others stood there, stunned, until Ou Yuze was dragged far away. Only then did she let out a piercing scream and in a fit of rage, swept all the dishes from the table onto the floor! 
Catastrophe loomed over the second branch of the Ou Family! 
---- 
After meeting with Ji Chengzhi, Ou Mucen had been in a coma, sleeping another seven or eight hours before he finally woke up. By then, it was already the morning of the next day, and he had been moved from the intensive care unit to a standard hospital room. 
"Awake?" 
Upon opening his eyes, as usual, he saw Ji Chengzhi first. 
Seeing this, Ou Mucen nodded on the bed, "Hmm, what time is it? 
Ji Chengzhi glanced at his watch, "Are you asking the current time, or how long has passed since the incident occurred? If it’s the latter, it’s been three days since your surgery until you fully regained consciousness." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Three days? 
He had been in a coma for so long? 
His lips felt dry, and he tried to sit up, but as soon as he moved, the pain in his abdomen made him lie back down again. 
Seeing this, Ji Chengzhi adjusted his bed a little, making it at least a bit more comfortable for him to rest. Then he handed over some warm water, "Your father has already gone back. He left last night." 
Last night? 
Was that not after he had talked to him about that matter? 
He took the cup of water and sipped a little from the edge of the cup... 
Warm and somewhat comforting! 
"And then?" 
"I heard your nephew has been stripped of his inheritance rights, and he will no longer be able to inherit the wealth of the Ou Family for the rest of his life. Also, your brother’s shares in Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry, he relinquished 50% of them to you."
###Chapter 402: Chapter 402: Do you think she wanted to kill me?
Ji Chengzhi was smiling when he talked about this, so he must have been happy for him. 
But in reality, if he hadn’t returned to Tokyo, the news of his fake death when it reached home would have brought about more severe punishment for both father and son than just this. It was very possible that Ou Yuze could have been disowned by the Ou family, or perhaps, even killed by the hot-tempered old master. 
After all, his father had been a gun enthusiast. 
Ou Mucen looked down at the glass of water. These past few days, he had become alarmingly thin due to consecutive injuries, to the extent that when he gripped the glass, he could see his pale, almost transparent fingers through the water. 
"Mucen, so what do you plan to do next? I’ve heard... it wasn’t just Ou Yuze who was after your life." 
Ji Chengzhi saw him staring blankly at the glass of water in his hand, so he sat on the edge of his bed and asked the question.
He had wanted to ask for a while, especially about that woman named An Ning. In these past few days, after the incident occurred, he had heard Secretary Gao describe the scene and had sent people to search for her in China. But that woman seemed to have vanished without a trace; he had searched for several days without finding any sign of her. 
Where exactly had she gone? 
And who exactly was she? 
Ji Chengzhi was waiting for an answer... 
But when this man heard his question, he only took another sip from the glass and lay down, seemingly unwilling to talk anymore. "I’m tired, please leave me alone for now." 
Ji Chengzhi’s brows furrowed instantly, "What are you talking about? Mucen, you can’t keep shouldering everything by yourself. You won’t be able to handle it." 
What could there be? Nothing but some uncleaned rubbish. 
A look of impatience flashed in Ou Mucen’s eyes as he lay down: "Don’t worry about me. I will handle my own affairs. We’ll talk when I get back." 
"But you’re in this state now; how will you handle things? According to your condition, you need at least half a month to recover. Mucen, just tell me, what exactly is going on with that woman? And does she have anything to do with the incident where they were after your life?" 
"..." 
Lying there, the pale-faced man furrowed his brows for a long while, finally saying, "What do you think? Does she have anything to do with it?" 
Huh? noveldrama
Ji Chengzhi was taken aback! 
Was he now asking him? He wasn’t the one involved; how would he know? 
But then, seeing the man’s fingers holding the cup slightly turning white, Ji Chengzhi paused and changed his mind, "An Ning, based on what I’ve learned about her during the time in the hospital, doesn’t seem like someone who would do such a thing." 
"Is that so?" 
Ji Chengzhi nodded, "Although she doesn’t seem very likable, she doesn’t appear to be a malicious person either." 
It was the truth. The first time he had met the woman named An Ning was when her son had an accident during moving and was sent to the hospital, and this man had hurriedly brought her in. He remembered wanting to get her away from his good friend upon realizing his unusual behavior, but instead, she had sarcastically retorted. 
So, he truly wasn’t fond of this woman, but to say she was mentally deranged, he couldn’t lie despite himself. She just didn’t seem like it, no matter how one looked at her. Besides, she had a child, didn’t she?
###Chapter 403: Chapter 403: Her real name is Ye Ning!
Ou Mucen said no more, his eyes simply lay there, not knowing where he was looking, unmoved... 
Ji Chengzhi, seeing this, sighed again in his heart! 
In fact, he understood his feelings now, being the only one who knew of his worries. With such an event, how could he not know what he was thinking? 
Therefore, upon seeing him like this, he came over and took the cup, which was still clutched tightly in his hand, "Mucen, actually, it’s useless for you to sit here and brood over things, why not go back and ask her yourself? Wouldn’t that be clearer?" 
Ask her personally? noveldrama
The man who had his cup taken away, looking at his empty palm, didn’t know what came over him. Suddenly, a cold sneer crossed his face, "She had a purpose when she came to me; do I even need to ask?" 
Purpose? 
Ji Chengzhi turned back in astonishment, "Are you saying... her becoming your assistant was all pre-planned?" 
Ou Mucen’s gaze grew colder, "It was all planned by her master. Her goal was to take revenge on Ou Yuze, and I was just the biggest pawn in their game!" 
!!!!!! 
For several seconds, Ji Chengzhi held the cup without any reaction. 
Revenge on Ou Yuze? 
My God, who exactly was that woman? Why has it suddenly come to involve the young master of the Ou Family? 
Also, this revenge on Ou Yuze, how does it involve the use of him? 
Ji Chengzhi felt as if a bomb had exploded in his head. Casually placing the cup on the table, he quickly sat down at the man’s bedside, "What exactly is going on? You need to explain it to me clearly; you’re making my head spin." 
Ou Mucen looked at him coldly for a few seconds, then finally spoke a few words, "She is none other than the mastermind behind the five-year-old grand fraud case—Mei Liping’s foster daughter, Ye Ning." 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
Sitting there, he stared blankly at him for more than ten seconds, then finally swallowed and spoke, "You’re talking about that meek little girl adopted from the orphanage by your family, aren’t you?" 
Ou Mucen didn’t speak, but his expression grew visibly more grim.
Yes, that was the little girl! 
Back then at Blue Mountain Villa, he truly never even glanced at her properly, because of the conflict with the second branch of the family and also because of the character of that couple. 
Thus, the little girl, from the time she was adopted until those years she spent in the villa, left an impression on him as nothing more than a tagalong behind Mei Liping. 
To call her a tagalong would actually be giving her too much credit, because more often, the role she played by that woman’s side was the same as the servants in the villa. The only difference being that she called Mei Liping ’mom’ and her clothing would be slightly more decent. 
But what of it? He never got along with that side of the family, so why would he pay attention to her? 
"This little girl you speak of, I do remember some details. I recall, once when my aunt and I visited your home, your second sister-in-law brought in a girl, then introduced her to my aunt as her newly adopted daughter, and I took a glance..." 
At this point, he suddenly looked up at him, "Wait, she didn’t look like this before. The girl back then, though timid around everyone, was quite pretty, with big eyes, an oval face, and her skin also..."
###Chapter 404: Chapter 404 Did She Get Plastic Surgery?
"You sure remember her quite well!" 
Before the words were even finished, the person across him coldly threw a sentence back. 
Upon seeing this, Jicheng zipped his mouth shut! 
Such a heavy killing intent, 
but what did that have to do with him? It was he who suddenly brought her up, then he just helped to recall a bit, was there something wrong with that?
Jicheng really couldn’t fathom his temper anymore, and didn’t dare to ask about the appearance issue again, so he changed the subject and brought up something else, "So, what you mean is... she came to you with the real purpose of using you to take revenge for her? Then... did she really take the fall for Ou Yuze in that case back then?" 
Ou Mucen let out a cold laugh, but said nothing more! 
Upon seeing this, Jicheng understood... 
Indeed, if it weren’t for the fact that she was framed that year, bearing such a tremendous wrongful accusation and hatred, how could she have possibly had the guts to come to him? 
Who was he? He was none other than the third young master of the Ou Family in A City, where even a casual comment from him could shake the entire scene. There, he was the king, the ruler, and the terror of power was such that even the well-known politician and social elites of that city didn’t dare to offend him, let alone her who approached him with an agenda. noveldrama
Suddenly, Jicheng understood why that woman was always so careful with her clothing after seeing him, so the reason lay here. 
"Then why, even knowing she was using you, did you still keep her close? Isn’t that foolish?" 
Jicheng blurted out! 
After saying this, the atmosphere in the hospital room changed. 
Shoot, he seemed to have said the wrong thing. 
Jicheng started to sweat, "Mucen, I... I didn’t mean that, what I’m trying to say is..." 
"Are you very free today?" 
"..." 
He was not free at all, he was clearly very busy. He still had to go get his medicine. 
Jicheng immediately stood up from the edge of the bed and strode towards the door. 
However, just as he reached the door of the ward, he couldn’t help but turn back and add, "You don’t really believe she would kill you, do you? Since that’s the case, why wouldn’t you give her a chance?" 
"..." 
No one responded. The only thing that came back to him was a cup suddenly thrown at him! 
There was a "bang!" 
Jicheng broke into a run! 
Wait, where did that cup come from? Didn’t he take away the cups? 
Also, what did he say wrong? That bastard was clearly just like that, did he really need to get so furiously embarrassed? Truly prideful yet suffering! 
Jicheng left the place, but while leaving, the shocking secrets that man had shared popped into his mind, and he couldn’t help but harbor some doubts, "If that woman is really the foster daughter from five years ago, then, wasn’t she supposed to be in prison? He remembered that she was sentenced to ten years back then. How did she get out?" 
Jicheng was baffled! 
In fact, this was a question that even Ou Mucen himself had yet to figure out. 
At the time of the court’s ruling, she was indeed sentenced to ten years on the spot and was immediately taken to prison, 
Oh right, there was a little episode where she tried to commit suicide with a stolen police gun due to being unable to bear the shock, but she failed, was later saved in the hospital, and then sent back to prison. 
So, what was the deal with her "Golden Cicada Shedding" escape now, and who was that person in prison substituting for her?
###Chapter 405: Chapter 405 He Doesn’t Want to Ruin Her
At which point had they been switched? 
After the man on the bed had seen the other people in the hospital room leave, his deep, lightless eyes began to fixate on a certain point outside the window, lost in thought... 
—— 
Half an hour later, Jicheng returned to the hospital room. This time, he brought a nurse with him, "Mucen, I think it’s best that you stabilize quickly and return to our country. Staying here, you can’t get anything done." 
Ou Mucen’s eyes flickered... 
What did that mean? 
What did he mean by saying he couldn’t get anything done? 
But in just a moment, the nurse who followed behind came over with a tray of medicine and several advanced pieces of healing equipment. 
"Mr. Ou, this is the most advanced medical equipment our hospital has, it can help your wounds heal quickly." 
"..." 
Staring at those things for a long time, Ou Mucen finally lay back down, albeit reluctantly, and extended his arm. 
Suddenly, he remembered the afternoon when someone had also been injecting something into his arm... 
Jicheng stood beside him, knowing that after these IVs, he would soon fall into a deep sleep. Thus, he didn’t disturb him any further. After giving the nurse a few instructions, he left the hospital room. 
Actually, his gains from today had been quite substantial; at the very least, he’d shared some of his matters with him, and this, for Ou Mucen, was indeed a very rare occurrence. 
So, Jicheng cherished this trust and hoped earnestly that he could do something for him. 
The woman was actually the foster daughter adopted by his brother five years ago? 
This news was truly unexpected! 
After leaving the hospital room, he went straight to find Secretary Gao. 
"Secretary Gao, have you arranged for someone to capture that Lin surname and An Ning back home?" 
Secretary Gao nodded, "Yes, but we didn’t catch them." 
Jicheng was somewhat anxious, "Did you inform the police to arrest them?" 
Secretary Gao quickly shook his head, "No, the third young master probably doesn’t want to blow this matter up before it’s confirmed. Besides, we don’t have any evidence now. If we rashly involve the police, it wouldn’t be good." 
It was good that the police weren’t notified! 
Upon hearing this, Jicheng breathed a sigh of relief... noveldrama
Indeed, he had come to confirm with the secretary that since the woman was indeed the real foster daughter, then at this moment, she would be an escaped convict on the run. If the police caught her and uncovered this issue, her life would be ruined. 
Jicheng suddenly understood the look of immense relief on Ou Mucen’s face when he had just woken up upon hearing that they hadn’t been caught. 
Yes, although he hated her and was very angry, he would rather give her another chance than destroy her; he preferred that she explain to him what exactly was going on. 
Thinking about the question the man had posed earlier inside, Jicheng suddenly felt a tightness in his heart, "You don’t need to worry about this matter anymore. If there’s anything, let the third young master stabilize first and handle it upon his return to the country." 
Handle it upon return to the country? 
Secretary Gao didn’t quite understand, "But, the third young master’s intention is..." 
"Just listen to me, alright? Since you can’t catch her now anyway, it’s better to wait until he comes back," Jicheng didn’t want to say too much. The secretary had told him that night that the woman was involved with Yu Ze, but he hadn’t known that she was the girl adopted from Yu Ze’s family. 
In other words, there were some things that not even Ou Mucen had told him.
###Chapter 406: Chapter 406: She did not speak a word to him after she came back
Since that man hadn’t told, then he was even less likely to speak. 
Fortunately, Secretary Gao heeded his words, and given that there had been no results from his arrangements over the past two days, he agreed to wait for the young master to recover and return to the country before taking any action. 
But the most important point was, even if he wanted to catch him, it was by no means certain he could, because Lin Yebai was no ordinary person. 
——
Three days later, at an antique shop near Dongdamen in A City— 
Lin Yebai was indeed a very clever man. He knew that after the incident, his residence at Tang Garden would definitely be searched. Therefore, on the day of his return, he left that place. 
But this departure was not far; it was just the antique street next to Tang Garden where he stayed, and the place he chose was just the most ordinary shop on this street. Such an arrangement was the easiest to go unnoticed. 
Xiaojin came to find him, just around eight or nine in the morning. 
Upon entering, he greeted the shop assistant and, after learning that the gentleman was upstairs, he took the items he had with him and went up, "Sir, this is what was acquired from Tang Garden yesterday. I have already made arrangements. For the next few days, we’ll say that you are not in." 
After speaking, he handed over the items he was holding, which were some top-quality antiques. 
At that moment, Lin Yebai was standing by the windowsill smoking. His appearance had deteriorated significantly over three days. His eye sockets were sunken, and his complexion lacked its usual vibrancy, even his eyes had some bloodshot. 
Hearing that everything had been taken care of, he turned around, glanced at the antiques without interest in verifying them, and went back to the living room to sit down. 
"Aning still hasn’t left the house?" 
"Not yet..." Upon hearing this, Xiaojin’s eyes immediately dimmed. 
Almost a week since returning, she hadn’t come down from upstairs. Anyone would be worried in such a situation. 
As his voice fell, the man who had just sat down on the sofa, already looking unwell, visibly grew even more distressed. He stubbed out his cigarette butt into the ashtray forcefully. Without saying anything, he picked up the newspaper from the coffee table. 
Xiaojin looked at him and, feeling a sense of pity, suggested, "Sir, why don’t we call the young lady over? Aning has a good relationship with her. Maybe, if she comes, she can comfort her." 
The young lady? 
Xiaoyu? 
The man holding the newspaper, upon hearing this, finally showed a glimmer of light in his bloodshot eyes, "Alright, then you go arrange it. By the way, how is Xiaobao?" 
"Young Master Xiaobao is doing quite well. Although the place where he’s staying is a bit unfamiliar, both Zhang Ma and his mother are there, so he isn’t really affected." noveldrama
"That’s good to hear!" 
He breathed a sigh of relief, finally settling down to look at the newspaper. However, when he glanced at the page and saw a news item about the president of Ou Group returning to the country, the relief in his eyes tightened once again. 
"Ou Mucen has returned to the country?" 
"Yes, he came back yesterday afternoon and went straight to the First People’s Hospital of the city." 
The First People’s Hospital? 
Lin Yebai thought of the hospital where he had first met that man and suddenly let out a cold laugh, "He actually survived? What’s the news from the Ou Family?" 
"There is news. It’s said that Ou Yuze has been stripped of his inheritance rights, and 50% of the shares of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry have fallen into Ou Mucen’s hands."
###Chapter 407: Chapter 407: He has placed her under house arrest
"That harsh?" 
Even he, who was always composed, was somewhat surprised by these words. 
Being stripped of inheritance rights, in a wealthy family, that truly feels worse than death—it’s hundreds of millions in assets gone just like that, not to mention Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry, which must be worth at least tens of billions. Giving half of that to that man, it seems this time, the second branch of the Ou Family really got played hard by that person. 
However, this did achieve their goal. After all, didn’t he have that girl enter the Ou corporation just to take down the second branch and that scum, Ou Yuze? 
Lin Yebai looked at the newspaper in his hands, and finally, a slow shimmer of light began to emerge in his eyes, "Xiaojin, what do you think, if we told Aning about this news, would she be happy?" noveldrama
Xiaojin was momentarily stunned! 
She should... be right? The girl’s initial goal had been to take revenge on the second branch of the Ou Family, and now that it was achieved, she should be happy, right? 
Xiaojin snapped out of it and began to feel a bit excited, "Then... should I go and tell her about it?" 
Lin Yebai’s fingers suddenly trembled, and his expression, unexpectedly, showed the same unease as a child’s... 
—— 
When Qiao Feiyu arrived at Jasmine Courtyard to find Ye Ning, she was upstairs teaching her son how to paint, "Do you want to sketch?" 
Ye Xiaobao shook his head, "I like gouache, Mom, can I draw you?" 
Then Ye Ning put on a beautiful dress, sat quietly, and let the little one start to paint her. 
This was probably the first time in many years that she had spent the whole day with him like this. The daily life of mother and son was actually quite fulfilling. In the morning, she would have Aunt Zhang buy some groceries, and then she would cook his favorite egg and crystal noodle soup. 
After breakfast, mother and son would start on their respective activities—the little one painting or playing with models or something, and she, earnestly carving her jade. 
Yes, besides her eyes, she was actually a very good jade carver. Not exceptionally outstanding, but she carved with great care. 
Qiao Feiyu walked in and immediately saw the baby standing in front of the easel and the mother, sitting behind it, posing for her son and meticulously grinding the jade in her hands. The sunlight was very bright, and the scene was very warm. 
Qiao Feiyu suddenly felt reluctant to disturb them. 
But very soon, the mother sitting there noticed her and raised her head, "Xiaoyu, what brings you here?" 
Only then did Qiao Feiyu come in and place the fruits and snacks she brought on the table, "I came to see you. I heard you were back but didn’t get the chance to visit. How is it? Are you used to the new house?" 
The woman with her back to the sunlight smiled without answering, but the small figure standing at the easel replied, "It’s pretty good. Did Auntie Qiao come specially to see us today?" 
"That..." Qiao Feiyu suddenly felt awkward. 
She had long anticipated her brother and best friend’s situation. Her brother was a rather introverted person; over the years, she hadn’t seen him associating with any women, much less having female friends. 
But he had been more than good to this best friend of hers, exceeding her imagination. From the time he rescued her five years ago, he had been nearly inseparable in taking care of her, so much so that it made her jealous. 
So she had actually guessed her brother’s feelings a long time ago, but what she didn’t expect was that, after so many years, her brother had never confessed, and once they laid bare their feelings, things became like this.
###Chapter 408: Chapter 408 Extortion
Qiao Feiyu didn’t know what to say, so she simply walked over, crouched down in front of her, "Aning, come back with me. Can’t you and I have a proper talk?" 
Ye Ning ignored her, still quietly carving on that piece of jade. 
Qiao Feiyu saw this, grew anxious, and reached out her hand, but Ye Ning gripped the carving knife in her hand, "Aning, even if we take a step back, my brother is your life-saving benefactor from years ago. Are you really going to cut ties with my brother over such a trivial matter?" 
Life-saving benefactor? 
As soon as these words came out, those delicate wrists that had been moving over the jade finally paused and then stopped. 
Ye Xiaobao stood across and saw this, a frown quickly forming on his young brow, "Auntie Qiao, my mom isn’t angry at Uncle Lin; she’s just been feeling unwell these past few days." noveldrama
"Is that so?" 
Qiao Feiyu turned to look at him, "Is she sick?" 
The chubby child nodded, "She had a fever last night. Auntie Qiao, please tell Uncle Lin that my mom will look for him once she’s better." 
His voice was tender and childish, and his chubby little face was the epitome of innocence and cuteness. 
Qiao Feiyu saw this, and although she didn’t quite believe it, in the end, she didn’t press further, "Alright, I got it. Then, Aning, you rest well here these couple of days, and when you feel better, come over to my house for a meal. It’s my mom’s birthday, and you must come, okay?" 
What she meant was clear; it was also the birthday of Lin Yebai’s mother. 
Ye Ning looked at her arm with a dazed gaze, finally moved, and smiled, "Alright, I’ll definitely come when the time comes." 
Qiao Feiyu heard this and immediately smiled happily! 
Finally, she had completed the task her brother had given her. As long as Ye Ning went on the birthday, couldn’t her brother have a chance to explain? To clear things up with him? 
Qiao Feiyu left, content... 
Once she left, the atmosphere in the room quieted down again. Ye Xiaobao stood there, looking at his mother who was sitting there, his mother whose face had lost all color. At that moment, the hand that Auntie Qiao had just held was now pricked by the sharp carving knife, drawing a curving red line.
"Mom, you’re bleeding." 
"Ah? It’s nothing, nothing!" Snapping back to reality, Ye Ning immediately scrambled with her bleeding hand to the washroom. 
Ye Xiaobao stood there, watching the washroom door his mother had hurriedly closed. After staring at it for a moment, he suddenly put down the pen in his hand and, holding the jade his mother had been carving, he trotted out of the room with his little legs. 
"Grandma Zhang, are you going to buy groceries this afternoon?" 
"Yes, what would Xiaobao like to eat?" 
"I don’t know, can I go take a look with you?" asked the child, dressed in cute little denim overalls, and as soon as he spoke, he waddled over to busy Grandma Zhang, who showered him with affection. 
Who wouldn’t love such a beautiful and adorable child? 
Grandma Zhang didn’t think twice; upon hearing he wanted to go to the supermarket with her, she agreed without hesitation, "Then okay, make sure to put on your little hat. Grandma Zhang doesn’t have a car; we’ll have to take the bus." 
The bus? 
The bus is good, right? 
Hearing about this mode of transportation, the child quickly went back to put on his small LOOK cap, and then cheerfully ran over, "I’m ready, Grandma Zhang. I want to tell you, I know how to take the bus too."
###Chapter 409: Chapter 409 Mom, I Will Protect You
"Really?" 
"Of course, when I went to that kindergarten, I often did it." 
"Young devil, I know you’re capable, come on, hold Grandma’s hand." 
The smiling old maid didn’t think of anything else; after taking Xiaobao’s chubby little hand into her own, she led him out the door. 
Of course, when they left, they didn’t forget to tell the two people at the door that they were going to the supermarket and would be back soon. 
The two were originally planning to follow, but when they heard that it was just a trip to the supermarket and that an adult was accompanying the child, they didn’t insist on going along. After they cautioned them to be safe, the elderly lady and the little boy headed to the nearby bus station to catch the bus. 
The journey from Jasmine Courtyard to the supermarket truly wasn’t far, just about a ten-minute walk. 
Moreover, the place was a busy transport hub, with most of the city’s bus routes passing through there. noveldrama
After arriving, Zhang Ma, worried that Xiaobao might get lost, kept a tight grip on his small hand the whole time. And Ye Xiaobao? 
He was very well-behaved, following her closely the whole way, until they passed a Pizza Hut. The sight of pizza images plastered on the glass stopped him in his tracks: "Grandma, I want to eat this." 
Upon seeing it, Zhang Ma thought, pizza, huh! 
Well, if the child wants to eat it, let him eat. After all, Mr. Lin dotes on him - just about anything Xiaobao wants to eat, he gets. 
So she led him in, found a server, and placed an order right away. 
"Little friend, what kind of pizza would you like?" 
"I want bacon and baked wings." 
"Bacon and baked wings, huh? That’ll take a bit long, oh, probably about thirty minutes. Are you willing to wait?" 
The bacon and baked wings pizza took longer because the chicken wings needed to be fully cooked before making the pizza. 
Ye Xiaobao had no issues, but upon hearing this, Zhang Ma became troubled: "Thirty minutes, that long, huh? Xiaobao, how about we pick something else?" 
The child, already perched on the seat, immediately lifted his little head and looked pitifully at his grandma: "Zhang Grandma, but I want this one, Xiaobao hasn’t had baked wing pizza in a long time, Little Bao wants it." 
Oh my, that pitiful look... 
After seeing that, Zhang Ma’s heart nearly broke. After a moment’s thought, she made a bold decision: "In that case, server, could you watch the child for me? I’ll run to the supermarket to do a bit of shopping and come back out, let him wait here." 
The server immediately responded with a smile: "Grandma, you can rest assured, our restaurant is under surveillance, it’s very safe." 
Under surveillance? 
Well then, that’s good, that’s good! 
Zhang Ma finally felt at ease. After settling Ye Xiaobao in the restaurant alone, she hastily went off to the supermarket. 
It was just a quick shopping trip. She’d be back soon. 
That’s what Zhang Ma thought... 
But what she didn’t know was that soon after she left Pizza Hut, the child who was sitting at the table noticed that the server wasn’t around anymore. His little body scrambled down from the chair, pushed the door open, and went outside. 
The First People’s Hospital in the city center could be reached by the majority of buses, so all he had to do was to go to the transport hub and board any bus heading towards the city center. 
Little Baozi, whose height was still not as tall as an adult’s leg, dashed straight from the restaurant towards the bus station they had come from.
###Chapter 410: Chapter 410: What is a four-year-old child going through?
It was only a matter of minutes before the chubby Little Baozi boarded a bus. 
Having boarded the bus, this incredibly smart Little Baozi didn’t go find a seat, but instead, after twirling around the bus, he sat down close to a middle-aged man who looked to be in his forties or fifties, and had not said a word throughout, leading everyone on the bus to assume the Little Baozi was the man’s grandson or some relative. 
Now successfully on the bus, it finally set off, and Ye Xiaobao stared out the window because he had never ridden this route before and was afraid of missing his stop. All the way, in addition to paying attention to the scenery outside, his little ears stood straight, not missing a single word from the broadcast announcing the stops. 
"Fenghua Road, next stop, City Number One People’s Hospital!" 
"..." 
At last, it was almost time! 
He rubbed his sweat-dampened little hands, and a sigh of relief lengthened inside his tiny chest. 
"Little friend, why aren’t you getting off? Wasn’t that your mom just now?" Just as he was happily waiting, suddenly, someone beside him struck up a conversation. 
Ye Xiaobao turned his head, only to realize that it was the middle-aged uncle whom he had sat next to when he first boarded the bus. 
Yes, when he first boarded, the uncle noticed him sitting by his side and was about to ask, but he had pretended to shift closer to the lady standing beside them, making the uncle think he was her child, to avoid any danger that might arise from too many questions. 
What? Had that lady already left? 
Turning his head to check, Ye Xiaobao saw that the lady was indeed gone, and immediately, his little brain started whirring rapidly: "No, my mom’s sitting up front. We are getting off at the next stop." 
"Really? Where is she?" 
"Right there, the one carrying a sister on her back," he pointed purposely at a lady with an infant on her back who was also sitting ahead. 
The middle-aged man glanced over and fell silent... 
So she had a child and was carrying another, no wonder! 
Having finally dealt with these troubles, the bus broadcast announced that City Number One People’s Hospital stop had arrived, and upon hearing this, Ye Xiaobao hurriedly stood up from his seat. 
But because he stood up too quickly and he was so small, when the bus came to a stop, he lost his balance and his tiny forehead forcefully struck the handrail in front of him, causing tears to nearly burst from his eyes from the pain. 
"Little friend, are you okay?" At the critical moment, it was the uncle sitting next to him who caught him. 
With tears in his eyes, Ye Xiaobao rubbed his forehead and after a long moment, he shook his head, still holding back tears, and then stubbornly followed the crowd off the bus, arm braced against the handrail. 
He was a man, he had to protect his mother. If he fell, he would get up; if he got hurt, just rub it a bit and it would be fine. 
Finally off the bus, he lifted his head to see the familiar skyscraper with the familiar large characters on top. The red swelling on his forehead was still there, but his little face immediately broke into a smile. noveldrama
Mom, don’t worry, I’ll definitely tell Uncle that you’re not a bad person! 
---- 
Ou Mucen’s condition had improved a lot. That day in Japan, Ji Chengzhi and the local doctors had discussed his treatment plan, and after changing his medication, his condition had basically stabilized by the third day. 
However, once back in China and no longer needing to fly, Ji Chengzhi had stopped the potent medication and switched to gradual treatment.
###Chapter 411: Chapter 411 Uncle, You’re Finally Awake...
This way, it won’t cause too much of a side effect on his body. 
"Give me another week, stay for another week, then come talk to me about discharge." That morning, as usual, after checking on him, he faced yet another inquiry from him about when he could be discharged from the hospital. He didn’t even turn his head as he threw out that line. 
Really, why is he always thinking about getting discharged? Isn’t it fine to just focus on getting better before leaving? 
Ji Chengzhi looked at the pile of documents next to him, as well as the laptop that seemed to have been left on all night, and deliberately added a sedative to the prescription when he left. 
Damn it, does he really think he’s a machine? Even in this state, does he still have to push himself so hard? 
So after this injection, Ou Mucen slept straight through from nine in the morning until almost eleven. At eleven, it was only because it seemed like there was a persistent noise in his ear that he finally frowned and struggled to open his eyes. 
"Xiaobao? How come you’re here?" 
The moment he opened his eyes and saw the little head with red-rimmed eyes leaning over his bedside, his whole person was stunned for a moment. 
This was so surprising; how could he see Little Baozi just as he opened his eyes? 
Could it be that he was feverish and dreaming again? 
Ou Mucen stared at Little Baozi for a long time without regaining his senses. 
Ye Xiaobao was thrilled to see him wake up; he had been waiting for nearly an hour. If he didn’t wake up soon, he wouldn’t have time to talk to him. Zhang Ma would definitely tell Uncle Lin if she found out he was missing. 
Thank goodness, he finally woke up! 
Ye Xiaobao wiped away the tear streaks from his somewhat dirty little hands and happily got closer, "Uncle, you finally woke up." 
He was a boy, and boys don’t like to cry. He wouldn’t have gotten so desperate to the point of tears if he hadn’t been calling out to him for so long without a response, and time was ticking away by the second. 
Ou Mucen was still a bit dazed, both because he had just woken up and because he had suddenly seen him appear by his side. 
But after hearing him speak, he still nodded, "I’m awake, why are you here?" 
"I came to see you, Uncle. I’ve been waiting for a long time." 
The four-year-old child sitting on that stool looked so tiny, but when he saw Uncle lying in the hospital bed, he still tried hard to lean his little body over and touch his belly. 
"Uncle, are you feeling any better? I saw on the news that you were badly hurt." 
"..." 
Looking at the gentle little hand carefully placed on his abdomen, Ou Mucen’s heart softened completely. Finally, with a stretch of his long arm, he reached out and scooped the little body into his arms. 
"Did you come here by yourself?" 
"Mhm..." 
"How did you get here?" noveldrama
"I..." 
The moment he was lifted into his arms, Ye Xiaobao wanted to explain, but he thought about the swelling on his forehead and immediately lowered his small face again, not wanting him to see: "I took the bus." 
The bus? 
Ou Mucen looked at his suddenly lowered head and the firmly placed LOOK cap on top of it, his brow furrowed. Suddenly, he reached out and took off his cap. 
He wasn’t a shy child, especially not in front of him. But now he suddenly couldn’t even dare to raise his head to look at him, there must have been something that happened. 
Ps: Happy National Day to my little friends! I wish you a fun holiday, and also, since baby is still updating on time during the festival, could you please smash me with your votes? ^_^^_^^_^^_^
###Chapter 412: Chapter 412: A Kind of Kinship Called Instinct!
Ou Mucen’s movements were quick! 
But, he hadn’t expected that as soon as he had taken off his hat, the small child he held in his arms cried out, "Ouch!" 
Ouch? 
Upon hearing this word, Ou Mucen’s fingers immediately halted, he quickly lowered his head, and that’s when he finally saw the swollen red bulge under his tiny hat on the child’s small forehead. 
Heavens, what happened? 
Seeing this, his heart ached fiercely, and in an instant, his face turned an iron shade of blue, "What happened? How did this get like this?" 
At first, Ye Xiaobao wanted to keep it hidden, but suddenly, when he saw that his uncle had noticed and even asked him, he didn’t know why, the child who never acted spoiled in front of his mother suddenly felt wronged. His big eyes reddened, and large tears started tumbling down! 
"Bumped it!" 
"Bumped it?" 
"Yeah, on the bus, I lost my balance when getting off and just... bumped into..." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Sitting there, he looked at him for a very long, long time, then suddenly, he reached out forcefully and hugged him tight against himself. 
It was an awful feeling, mixed with guilt, heartache, and discomfort, as if something was pricking his heart. He had lived for so long but had never felt so terrible. 
Four years old! 
He was only four years old. To come to find him, the child had ridden the bus alone. Mucen didn’t know where he had come from, but he did know how crowded those buses were and how dangerous they could be. 
Yet he had come all the same, and upon arrival, he even tried to hide the bumps and bruises he got along the way, not wanting him to see... 
Ou Mucen felt a heavy constriction in his chest, his large palm stroked the child’s tiny back for a long time, before he mustered a hoarse voice, "It’s okay, uncle will get a doctor to apply some medicine for you soon, and it’ll heal quickly." 
Ye Xiaobao immediately nodded obediently in his embrace, "Mhm, Uncle, I came to bring you something." 
"What is it?" 
"This..." The child held out in the embrace unfolded his delicate little hand. 
Ou Mucen lowered his gaze and only then did he notice that in his palm lay a piece of white jade. The jade, roughly half the size of his palm, was Mutton Fat Jade of fine quality. However, its shape... noveldrama
"What is this?" He saw the unpolished carvings and what seemed like red stains on it, and couldn’t help but take it from his palm. 
Ye Xiaobao looked at it, eyes wide open, "Mom carved it, Uncle, Mom has been unhappy these days, she stays in her room every day carving this, carving so many of them." 
"Mom?" 
"Yeah, Uncle, did you have a fight with Mom?" 
A fight? 
Ou Mucen held the half-finished piece of jade in his hand, and without reason, his fingers paused slightly, "Did she tell you that?" 
Ye Xiaobao shook his head, "No, Mom doesn’t talk, doesn’t say anything, but I saw she looked very sad when she secretly watched the news about you, Uncle, did Mom make you angry again?" 
The four-year-old child didn’t really understand adult grudges, but he was smart. He knew something must be wrong when he saw his mother lock herself in that upper room, not coming down for several days, not talking to, nor seeing anyone. 
And he hadn’t told his uncle yet that when Mom came home that day, she hadn’t slept at all the entire night but sat by the window sill, staring out into the dark night, lost in thought, occasionally crying. 
As for the news?
###Chapter 413: Chapter 413: Uncle, did you have a fight with mom?
Actually, all of that was made up; that yard, ever since mother and son moved in, to prevent them from leaving, not only were people stationed outside to stand guard, but even the television and internet had been turned off inside. 
So, regarding this uncle, all of his observations came from times when he followed Uncle Xiaojin to Uncle Lin’s place. 
Ou Mucen was stunned there! 
Cried? 
He said his mother cried when she saw his news? 
Something seemed to jump inside his chest, something frozen and indifferent—the thick, hard layer he had erected not long ago suddenly moved again. 
"Has your mother been unwell since she returned?" 
Ye Xiaobao shook his head: "Not well, she hasn’t come downstairs in a week, isn’t eating properly, and often sits on the windowsill during sleep, staring blankly outside. Uncle, will you go see my mother?" 
Ye Xiaobao was genuinely worried about his mother; otherwise, he wouldn’t have taken such a risk to find this uncle. 
Ou Mucen looked at him, his well-defined facial features showing no emotion, no sign of happiness or anger—his entire expression was as if shrouded in a layer of fog, impossible to discern what he was thinking. 
Was he going to see her? noveldrama
No, he didn’t want to at all. 
At the very least, before he came here, he had just rejected Secretary Gao’s suggestion to continue looking for the mother and son. 
That woman had really crossed a line with him this time, and it was his bottom line! 
But when he saw the child’s hope-filled eyes, as well as the swollen red bump on his little forehead, his eyes eventually softened: "Where do you live now?" 
Ye Xiaobao’s eyes lit up instantly: "We live at..." 
No, no, no, he couldn’t tell him where they lived, otherwise, it would be trouble if Uncle Lin found out. 
The four-year-old child’s slick eyes spun around, and he changed his mind: "Uncle, my mother will attend Grandma Qiao’s birthday party the day after tomorrow." 
"Who is Grandma Qiao?" 
"She’s Auntie Qiao’s mother." 
"And who is Auntie Qiao?" 
"Auntie Qiao..." 
Ye Xiaobao scratched his little head: "Auntie Qiao is a good friend of my mother’s, you’ve seen her, uncle. She was the one who took me to find my mother that time at the square." 
Oh, it was that girl! 
Ou Mucen understood then, and he put the little hat back on him: "Alright, got it. Uncle will have someone take you back first." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Xiaobao’s dark eyes immediately shone: "Then uncle, you’ve agreed?" 
Ou Mucen didn’t speak but just patted his little head before picking up the phone and dialing out: "Hey, Chengzhi, come over." 
- 
Two minutes later, Director Ji arrived. 
Upon entering and pushing open the door of the hospital room, seeing Little Baozi inside, his eyes nearly popped out... 
Holy shit! 
Where did this Baozi spring up from? Wasn’t he said to have disappeared? They couldn’t find him for so long, how did he suddenly appear here? 
He looked around: "Who brought him here?" 
Ou Mucen gave him a faint glance, lifted Baozi off the bed: "Go get the wound on his forehead treated, and send him back." 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
After a long moment of stunned silence, he stared at Little Baozi: "Baozi, where did you spring up from?" 
Baozi started frowning upon hearing Director Ji’s question, displeased by his query: "I popped out from a stone!"
###Chapter 414: Chapter 414: Could it be that the child isn’t his? His name is written backwards!
"!!!!!!" 
Standing there, he glared at the little rascal for a long time before finally coming over to pick him up, ready to treat his wounds and send him back. 
But Little Baozi frowned, "Uncle, I don’t want him to send me; I’ll go back by myself." noveldrama
Full of disdain, not even giving him a sideways glance, Little Baozi, with his tiny arms and legs, lifted his foot and headed for the door.
Ji Chengzhi froze! 
He stayed put, taking a long time to regain his senses, but Ou Mucen saw this and hurriedly called out to him, "Xiaobao, be good!" 
At that comment, Little Baozi, who was about to leave, stopped! 
He wasn’t unwilling to let this principal uncle escort him, but he was afraid that if the uncle did take him back, Aunt Zhang would find out, and she would surely tell Uncle Lin; then Uncle Lin would be upset. 
But as it turned out, after Uncle Bingshan had arranged for the principal to send him back, once they arrived at the square he was supposed to leave from, the principal didn’t get out of the car to accompany him but instead stopped at an inconspicuous spot and opened the car door for him. 
"Baozi, it looks like we’re in trouble, huh? Are those people in the square looking for you?" 
Baozi scowled and ignored him... 
Isn’t that obvious? Who would bother getting so many people in black suits for no reason? 
Baozi pushed the door open, didn’t bother with the uncle in the car, and, quick as a bunny, he hopped out and headed straight for the Pizza Hut Restaurant nearby. 
Ji Chengzhi was still rambling on when suddenly he heard the car door open and turned his head to look! 
My goodness, could that really be a four-year-old Little Baozi? It was unbelievable! 
Ji Chengzhi, sitting in the car, watched as the little figure that had slipped into the restaurant quickly ran to the children’s play area and lay down under a pool of plastic balls; he was as shocked as if he had been struck by lightning, his entire expression dumbfounded. 
This was defying the heavens; that was just a four-year-old child, after all. How could his little head operate like that? 
He watched, dumbstruck, until not long after, the children discovered the kid lying in the ball pit, and then called over a restaurant server. Immediately, everyone who was looking for the child swarmed over, followed by an elderly lady who picked him up and burst into tears... 
Freak! 
This must be a freak!! 
He took out his phone, captured this scene, and then sent it to someone waiting in the hospital: "Is this child really human?" 
The message was sent, and soon after, he got a reply: "It’s just that you were too dumb when you were little!" 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
Damn! 
He was about to throw his phone! 
Calling him dumb? Was he really not smart when he was a child? 
Wait, that guy was actually very smart, indeed; he remembered being outwitted by him quite often when he was young, and his feelings then were exactly the same as his expression while watching Little Baozi. 
So him... 
He suddenly remembered something very important, so he immediately made a phone call... 
"Principal..." 
"I’m asking you, what about the DNA test report I asked you to do? Is it out yet?" 
"Not yet; it’s 10 working days." 
"Why does it take 10 working days? Isn’t it supposed to be done in 6 working days?" 
"But Principal, you said to do a comprehensive one at that time, not the ordinary kind. That’s the one that takes 10 working days." 
"..." 
Clutching the phone, Ji Chengzhi was choked with frustration! 
Damn! 
Did he actually say that?
###Chapter 415: Chapter 415 If I Tell Her, I Want to Marry Her!
Ye Ning only heard about her son going missing after the fact, so upon hearing he had returned, she, who hadn’t come downstairs for five whole days, finally rushed down from upstairs in a hurry, "Xiaobao, Xiaobao, are you alright?"
Ye Xiaobao was being led by Nanny Zhang, and as soon as he saw his mother come down, he immediately let go of her hand and ran towards her quickly, "Mommy..." 
"Why did you go out? Mommy was only away for a moment to the restroom and you disappeared, do you know you almost scared Mommy to death?" She ran over and was immediately embraced by the woman who had hurried down the stairs. 
The others saw and tactfully withdrew, leaving only one man at the entrance to the courtyard. 
Ye Ning was still holding her son tightly; she had truly been frightened just now. If something had happened to her child, she couldn’t imagine how she could go on living. 
As mother and son were embracing, suddenly, there were footsteps approaching. She looked intently and recognized the pair of shiny black shoes walking towards her, "Aning, I’m sorry, I was careless this time." 
It was him! 
Ye Ning immediately picked up her child, preparing to go upstairs. 
But at this moment, the man, as if anticipating her move, had already stepped forward to block her way just as she was about to rise, "Aning, wait a moment!" 
Ye Ning lowered her head and stood there listlessly... 
Seeing this, Lin Yebai’s expression turned pale again. After a long while, he continued, "This time, he was playing with other children and accidentally fell into the ball pit. That’s why we couldn’t find him, but don’t worry, he’s not seriously hurt. I’ve also taken him to treat the wound on his forehead." 
"..." 
No one paid any attention to him. The woman in front of him, holding her child, appeared to have no reaction whatsoever. 
Or rather, she did have a reaction, it seemed to be waiting for him to finish speaking so she could go upstairs. 
Lin Yebai looked at her, and seeing that she remained silent, the words he had intended to say about the Ou Family’s second household suddenly stuck in his throat, and he couldn’t utter a single word. noveldrama
Yes, he was no longer the Brother Lin she had in mind. His actions during this trip to Japan had completely exposed his true nature to her; he wasn’t the gentle and refined gentleman or the elegantly proper scholar. 
Lin Yebai was a man who would stop at nothing to achieve his goals—a man now without any right to use those things to seek her forgiveness. 
Weren’t those things obtained by trampling over the blood and life of that man right under her watch? 
Lin Yebai’s heart sank once again, and after a tense grip of his hand, he finally chose to stiffly step aside, "I have nothing more to say, just wanted to let you know that Xiaobao is okay." 
"..." 
Truly not sparing him a glance, Ye Ning carried her son upstairs. 
Just at that moment, Xiaojin also arrived. Seeing the man just left standing there discarded, his gaze dimmed as well, "Sir, why didn’t you tell her about the Ou Family’s second household?" 
Lin Yebai shook his head, "It’s useless, those things are not enough for her to forgive me." 
"Sir..." 
Xiaojin didn’t know what else to say. Looking at his silhouette, all he felt was an urgent desire to go up and explain everything properly to that woman on behalf of him. 
"Xiaojin, do you think, all these years, I have not made my feelings clear to her? Is that why she refuses to forgive me?" 
"What does sir mean...?" 
"Tell her, I want to marry her!" 
"..."
###Chapter 416: Chapter 416: Qiao Family’s Birthday Banquet is the Best Opportunity
"Sir..." 
"If I tell her that everything I’ve done for her, including all the events of the past five years, was because I love her and want to be with her, to marry and have children, will she forgive me? Will she give me another chance?" 
"..." 
Standing there, Xiaojin looked blankly at the man who seemed almost possessed, staring for a long, long time. 
Had the sir truly become bewitched? How could one force matters of the heart like this? 
Yet seeing him like this, Xiaojin felt some reluctance to be harsh; after some thought, he replied, "You could try, sir. Miss Feiyu told me this morning that Aning agreed to attend madam’s birthday party the day after tomorrow." noveldrama
"Really?" 
"Of course it’s true. If you want to tell her all this, I’ll go make the arrangements for you." 
"Good, then make it a grand affair, and try not to let her notice. Also..." 
He paused, then pulled out his phone and swiped open the screen: "Go here and pick out a diamond ring for me, the biggest and most beautiful one." 
He handed over the phone! 
Xiaojin glanced at it and saw the page opened was for the number one ranked international brand in the city. He nodded to show he remembered, "Alright, sir, rest assured, I’ll take care of it immediately." 
Then he left... 
Mr. Lin was not normally an impetuous man, especially when it came to matters of the heart—otherwise, he wouldn’t have silently cared for that woman and looked after her all these years, never forcing anything upon her. 
But today, he was anxious, not only had he suddenly decided something as important as a marriage proposal, but he had also let Xiaojin go buy a ring, any ring from the street, which was completely out of character for him. 
Had the sir really been driven to a dead end? 
—— 
Ye Ning took her son upstairs, paying no attention to the movement downstairs, but as soon as she brought her son up, she immediately looked at his forehead, "What exactly did you do to yourself? Such a big bump, does it hurt?" 
Ye Xiaobao was quick to shake his head, "It doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t hurt, Mom, I was just playing with the other kids and accidentally bumped into something." 
"Accidentally bumped into something and you still managed to lie in the ball pit for so long? Grandma Zhang and the others couldn’t find you?" 
"I...I fell asleep." 
"You..." 
Ye Ning really didn’t know what to say, took the iodine and some medication, and sat in front of him carefully applying it. 
Ye Xiaobao sat on a little stool, and seeing his mom get so frustrated by him, he raised his little head and asked with a smile, "Mom, are you going to Auntie Qiao’s the day after tomorrow?" 
"Auntie Qiao? Why would I go to her house?" 
"..." 
See, she really hadn’t decided to go! 
Ye Xiaobao became unhappy, knitting his small brows as his little mouth puckered, "But you promised Auntie Qiao at noon that you would go to Grandma Qiao’s birthday party, and now you’re not going." 
Ye Ning paused! 
That matter, she hadn’t planned on going to it. Her acceptance in the morning had been just a casual remark to Feiyu. 
Her gaze dropped as she took the iodine-soaked swab and carefully dabbed it on his forehead, "Xiaobao, let’s not go to those places, okay? They’re crowded and noisy, and it’s such a hassle. If you like cake, I’ll just buy you some later."
###Chapter 417: Chapter 417: Third Young Master, the old master has an important banquet tonight that you must attend.
Ye Xiaobao blinked his eyes, "But I really want to go, Mommy. I haven’t been to such a lively place in so long. Aunt Buqiao said she’d prepare lots of delicious food for me." 
"But..." 
"Mommy, I’ll just go this once. Please, say yes." By the end, he was pleading and had wrapped his arms around her arm. 
Ye Ning felt a sting in her heart! 
The truth was, it wasn’t that she didn’t want to take him with her; rather, that banquet was anything but a regular birthday party. It was an event that man had deliberately planned to meet and spend time with her. With that, how could she still go? 
Yet, seeing the hopeful look in the child’s eyes, she could no longer bear to refuse. So, in the end, she could only nod, "Okay, we’ll go." 
At hearing this, Ye Xiaobao finally cheered up, "Thank you, Mommy. I knew you were the best."
Ye Ning looked at the child—his mood shifting from gloom to delight in an instant—and found herself between tears and laughter, "It’s just a banquet. Look how happy you are. You’re such a big boy now, still loving crowds like this." 
Ye Xiaobao’s face was all aggrieved, "Am I that big? I’m only four years old!" 
Four years old... 
Without any courtesy, Ye Ning wiped him with the cotton swab in her hand, "You know you’re four years old alright. But when you went out with Nanny Zhang today, how come you didn’t remember you were just four?" 
Ye Xiaobao immediately laughed, "Of course, when it’s time to protect Mommy, I’m the man..." 
"..." 
—— 
Ou Mucen was recovering pretty well these last couple of days and could basically get out of bed and walk around freely. Seeing this, Ji Chengzhi finally allowed him to start working in his hospital room, but definitely not to leave the room. 
Seeing this, Ou Mucen asked his secretary to bring a laptop, and he started to remotely direct the company via computer. Today happened to be the first day of the Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry shareholders’ meeting. 
"Third Master, the old Chairman said he’ll represent you during the daytime meeting, but there’ll be a shareholders’ dinner at the Empire Hotel tonight, and it’s best if you attend. He has already spoken to Dr. Ji, so there should be no problem." 
The secretary told him all this as he saw him open the video call. 
Due to his serious injuries and hospitalization, all of Ou’s affairs had been personally handled by the old man who returned to the company. So, seeing such arrangements now wasn’t surprising. 
Yet, the man sitting in the chair slightly furrowed his brows upon hearing this, "Tonight?" 
The secretary nodded, "Yes, the old man said it’s the end of the month when shareholders from various places traditionally return to A City for the meeting. He’s taking this opportunity to get things done, to prevent any trouble from some shareholders when you take over." 
Trouble... 
Ou Mucen couldn’t help but feel a mix of amusement and disbelief toward his old man. 
Indeed, Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry was the first venture he’d started from scratch, followed by those who had been with him from the start. With him suddenly taking the helm, there were bound to be some who were dissatisfied. noveldrama
And then, there was the likelihood that his brother wouldn’t just give up so easily. 
Ou Mucen understood this much, and his frown deepened, "What time does it start?" 
The secretary checked his phone, "Around eight o’clock." 
Eight o’clock as well? 
As these words fell, the man sitting in the chair stopped tapping his fingers on the desk. 
The secretary had no idea what was going through his president’s mind. After he mentioned the time, his boss just sat there in silence...
###Chapter 418: Chapter 418 Do you want to go find her or not?
Secretary Gao didn’t know what his president was thinking. After he gave the time, the man just sat there in silence, his face clouded over, leaving Gao clueless about his thoughts. Feeling a bit intimidated, Gao hurriedly placed the car keys that had been called for in front of him. noveldrama
"Just before coming here, I’ve already notified Doctor Ji. If you go in the evening, he will take you there, so if anything happens, he can take care of you," Gao said. 
"..." 
After waiting a bit longer and seeing that he still didn’t speak, eventually, Secretary Gao, holding a platter of documents, left. 
Once Secretary Gao left, the hospital room became quiet. Apart from the video of the stockholders’ meeting streaming on the laptop, the room was so silent that one could hear a pin drop.
When Ji Chengzhi entered, what he saw was exactly this scene... 
In the spotlessly white hospital room, a tall and handsome man was casually sitting in an ivory chair near the window. Wearing a blue and white striped hospital gown, which far from diminishing his aura, under the bright light and bold color, made his skin seem even more fair and clear. His profile, as he gazed thoughtfully out the window bathed in sunlight, looked as if it had stepped out of a painting. 
Such a demon! 
Feeling a strong surge of envy, Ji Chengzhi walked in and asked, "What’s wrong? Still hesitating?" 
Ou Mucen, hearing the voice, didn’t look back but directly turned off the video on his laptop... 
"Why have you come? Don’t you have surgery to perform?" he asked. 
"At least give me a break. I came to see what you’ve decided. Are you going to attend your shareholders’ banquet, or are you going to see that woman? It’s your call," Chengzhi said, plopping down opposite him. 
Ou Mucen’s gaze flickered, but he didn’t answer the question. Instead, he picked up the water glass on the desk and slowly took a sip. 
Seeing this, Chengzhi remarked, "As for the shareholders’ banquet, you don’t need me to tell you it’s important. You’ve been wanting the Longfeng shares for years, and now your old man is personally helping you to rise to the position. It’s a great opportunity, but the Qiao Family..." 
"If you don’t speak up, no one will take you for a mute," the man drinking water finally said coldly. 
Chengzhi, caught off guard, choked... 
If he doesn’t speak, naturally no one would think he’s mute, but if even he fell silent, then he would truly become a mute. 
This secret that could not be shared, aside from speaking to himself, what was he but a mute? 
Chengzhi casually picked up a magazine from the desk: "Yes, I’m a bit noisy. But Mucen, you need to be clear about what you want. Is your career more important, or is your heart?" 
Heart? 
The man sitting there heard that word and his face immediately showed scorn: "Isn’t my career what fills my heart?" 
Chengzhi: "..." 
Forget it, there’s no point in talking anymore, such a stubborn extremist! 
Chengzhi stood up: "Fine, go or don’t go, it’s none of my business anyway." 
After speaking, he left the room. 
He could actually understand how he was feeling right now. The desire to go was because he couldn’t let go, but if he truly decided to go, he couldn’t pass the barrier in his heart. 
What a proud man he was, that woman had hurt him so, why should he go find her? 
PS: Sorry, I have something to attend to today and need to step out, here are three Chapters for now, and I’ll be back in the evening...
###Chapter 419: Chapter 419: Attending the Banquet
Is An Ning pretty? 
No, she doesn’t even compare to half of La Chenxi, but damn it, he still made room for her in his eyes. Even when she infuriated him or her appearance was awful, he still accepted her. Moreover, the tolerance he showed her surpassed that for La Chenxi back in the day. 
Therefore, Ji Chengzhi really could understand his current mood because he had allowed her to occupy a place in his heart, yet she "repaid" him so cruelly with her actions. How could he want to see her again? 
To put it bluntly, even if she had not participated in the attempt on his life, the mere fact that she was informed was enough for him to kick her out of his heart. 
After leaving the hospital room, Ji Chengzhi felt a pang of heartache for the first time on behalf of the man inside... 
Better not to go. If he didn’t go, at least, there would be no more chances for him to get hurt! 
Ji Chengzhi took out his phone and made a call: "Hello, Uncle, I’ve confirmed it. Tonight, I can bring Mucen to the banquet on time." 
... noveldrama
—— 
Because she had to attend a banquet, Ye Ning had no choice but to change into the little dress that Qiao Feiyu had sent over earlier. 
The Qiao Family, in A City, wasn’t particularly prominent, but since Qiao’s father was a university professor, surely a lot of people would attend his wife’s birthday. It really wouldn’t be appropriate for her to dress too casually. 
After changing into the little dress, Little Baozi, who had also put on new clothes, saw how pretty his mom looked and his little face bloomed with joy: "Mommy, do you want to put on some makeup?" 
Ye Ning looked at him: "Why should I wear makeup?" 
Ye Xiaobao blinked his beautiful big eyes: "Because it’s polite. Mommy’s wearing such a pretty dress, if you don’t wear makeup, Aunt Qiao’s mom might think Mommy is being rude." 
Is that so? 
Ye Ning glanced at her somewhat plain appearance in the mirror compared to the little dress and actually sat down to apply a light makeup. 
After she finished her makeup, the car that was ready to take them to the Qiao Family was waiting downstairs. Hearing this, Ye Ning quickly got ready and went downstairs with her son’s hand in hers. 
"Xiaobao, coming down?" 
Surprisingly, the person waiting downstairs wasn’t that man, but his assistant Xiaojin. 
When Ye Xiaobao saw him, he immediately ran over and threw himself at him: "Uncle Jin, are you taking us there today?" 
Xiaojin bent down and picked him up: "Yeah, your Uncle Lin has already gone ahead. He asked me to wait here for you. Aning, get in the car." 
Ye Ning was actually relieved that the person waiting here wasn’t that man. Hearing the invitation to get in the car, she didn’t refuse and got in with her high heels on. 
"Xiaojin, what time does the banquet start? If there’s still time, let’s take a stroll on the street. I haven’t prepared a gift yet." 
Once in the car, Ye Ning remembered that she hadn’t prepared anything and wanted Xiaojin to take her out for a bit. 
But upon hearing this, Xiaojin looked at his watch and shook his head: "It’s almost starting; don’t worry about it. The lady isn’t a stranger, she won’t mind." 
Upon hearing that, Ye Ning had to let it go! 
Forget it, anyway, she wasn’t going to stay there for long; she would just take Xiaobao for a stroll and then return. 
So, sitting in the back without making a sound, she watched the scenery outside fly past with her son by her side... 
The Qiao Family, she actually had never been there. Since coming here, firstly, she didn’t have the time, and secondly, Lin Yebai didn’t really want her to interact with his own family, especially his mother.
###Chapter 420: Chapter 420: Aning, You Are the Most Beautiful Woman at Tonight’s Banquet
So, when it comes to the Qiao Family, she really didn’t know. 
She had never been there before, but she had heard Qiao Feiyu mention it. She said her father was a university professor and lived on the university town side. 
However, she hadn’t expected that after the car left the city, got on the ring road, and drove for about half an hour, with the sudden opening up of the view in front, the greenery on both sides suddenly increased. 
Those were camphor trees, one after another, lush and leafy. She didn’t know how many years they’d been planted, but as they drove into the area with the evening just beginning to set in, the whole street seemed isolated, the hustle and bustle of the city slowly disappearing, replaced by tranquility and ease amidst the dancing shadows of the trees. 
This place was really beautiful! 
Ye Ning’s eyes lit up at the sight, and she rolled down the car window. Seeing the street outside with few vehicles, all either cyclists or pedestrians, she couldn’t help asking, "Does everyone living here work at the university?" 
Xiaojin nodded, "Almost, this is a famous university in A City. Many teachers or students’ parents buy houses nearby." 
So that’s how it is! 
Ye Ning realized and continued to look out the window. As the car got closer to the university, buildings began to appear more frequently on both sides. But most importantly, past those buildings lay rows of beautiful villas, and her gaze settled there. noveldrama
"We’re almost there, the lady’s home is right over there." 
Upon seeing the row of villas, Xiaojin immediately said. 
Ye Ning nodded, and then she bent down to tidy up the child beside her in preparation for getting out of the car. 
In just two or three minutes, the car stopped in front of a villa that looked quite sizable. And there, at the brightly lit entrance of the villa, Qiao Feiyu, wearing a snow-white princess dress, was already waiting. 
"Aning, Xiaobao, you’re finally here. I was just about to die waiting for you!" 
Qiao Dani always spoke in a loud and carefree manner. Seeing the two arrive, she eagerly came over to open the door for them herself. 
Ye Ning stayed inside, and upon seeing her, she sent her son out first before getting out of the car herself. 
"Wow, Ning, you look so beautiful today!" Qiao Feiyu, holding Ye Xiaobao in her arms, was dazzled by her best friend emerging from the car. 
She indeed looked beautiful, especially after putting on the starry sky blue strapless cocktail dress her brother had custom-made for her today.
Ye Ning, seeing her stare, couldn’t help blushing a little: "What are you looking at?" 
"Looking at a beauty!" 
"Tsh!" 
Ye Ning gave her a glare and then looked past her. 
She saw that behind her, the villa was already very lively—lights ablaze, voices loud and clear. In the garden, many pure white roses had been arranged, with beautiful ribbons of all sorts tied around them. The grandeur of the scene was somewhat astonishing. 
"Is it really your mother’s birthday today?" 
Qiao Feiyu nodded, "Yeah, why do you ask?" 
Ye Ning laughed and replied, "Nothing, it just feels very grand." 
A birthday party, decorated with white roses? 
Stepping into the garden, Ye Ning found it odd to see the dew still lingering on the white petals on both sides.
###Chapter 421: Chapter 421 This Doesn’t Look Like a Birthday Party
Qiao Feiyu didn’t pay attention to those details; after bringing her in, he directly went into the living room with Xiaobao in his arms and with her alongside. By this time, nearly all of the Qiao Family’s relatives and friends had arrived in the villa’s living room. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning immediately felt awkward and wanted to let Qiao Feiyu ahead of her put down her son so they could quietly grab a bite to eat on the side. 
But at that moment, the woman directly carried her son into the center of the bustling living room, "Mom, Dad, Aning is here, and this is her son, Xiaobao." 
Aning? 
As soon as these words were spoken, a middle-aged woman dressed in a dark red satin embroidered cheongsam, who was surrounded by a crowd in the center, immediately lifted her gaze towards Ye Ning with a wine glass in hand. 
She was a very dignified-looking woman. Although she was of a certain age, her facial features and temperament were outstanding. Seeing Ye Ning, she just stood there with a slight smile, her eyes and brows expressing a warmth and elegance that spread across her face, "So you are Aning. Come here and let me take a look at you." noveldrama
Ye Ning immediately stiffened! 
Is this... Mrs. Qiao? Is she asking me to come over? 
Ye Ning became nervous. She glanced around, saw that everyone was staring at her, and finally, after pursing her lips, mustered the courage to approach, "Ma’am, I apologize. I came today..." 
"Quite a delicate-looking young lady. How old are you this year?" 
"Ah?" Ye Ning was bewildered by such a question. 
How old? 
Is the lady asking her age? 
She was a bit puzzled, but out of politeness, she honestly replied, "I’m 23." 
"23, young, that’s nice!" The lady, satisfied upon hearing her age, nodded approvingly and smiled. 
Ye Ning became even more confused... 
Logically, she was here to wish her a happy birthday today. With so many of the Qiao Family friends and relatives present, she was merely a friend of her son, not even an acquaintance. Why would Mrs. Qiao be so warm towards her? 
While she was still bemused, Lin Yebai, who had been mingling with the guests and exchanging pleasantries with Qiao Family elders, finally sensed something amiss and quickly came over, "Mom, what are you all chatting about?" 
Upon hearing her son, Mrs. Qiao immediately turned her head towards her own son, "Yebai, it’s all good..." 
"Mom, go over there for a look; Uncle is asking for you." Lin Yebai was slightly panicked and quickly interjected before directing her away. 
Ye Ning finally breathed a sigh of relief... 
Mrs. Qiao indeed seemed a bit strange. 
Just as she planned to take Xiaobao from Qiao Feiyu’s arms to get something to eat, the man who had already approached her took the initiative to hold Xiaobao, "Xiaobao, what would you like to eat?" 
Ye Xiaobao had long been drooling over the delicacies, and upon being asked what he wanted to eat, he promptly pointed his little hand in their direction, "I want that." 
Lin Yebai smiled, "Okay, Uncle will take you there." 
While holding his small hand, his gaze turned to the woman standing in front of him, "Aning, shall we go together?" 
Ye Ning had no intention of speaking to him, but since he had already come up to her and it was his mother’s home, she nodded and followed him. 
"Aning, thank you for coming to my mother’s birthday party today." 
"..."
###Chapter 422: Chapter 422: He Suddenly Began to Speak of a Past He Had Never Mentioned Before
Ye Ning stood there with her head down for a long time before she finally lowered her gaze to the fruit platter before her and said, "I should." 
That was all she said, just those three words, and then there was silence. 
Lin Yebai had been busy getting food for the child beside him. He didn’t dare to look at her, fearing she would once again refuse to speak to him and refuse to look at him. 
Until those three words fell upon his ears... 
Had she finally spoken to him? Had she really spoken to him? 
His fingers trembled momentarily, and something seemed to surge up from the bottom of his heart—a mix of excitement and ecstasy almost made his heart burst out of his chest. 
He had never known that her willingness to say a single word to him could make him so happy. 
"No, you don’t know, I never celebrate my mother’s birthday either. It was yesterday when Xiaoyu said you would come, that’s why I came." 
"..." 
Ye Ning paused with the pastry fork in her hand! 
He never celebrates his mother’s birthday? Why? And what does her coming today have to do with him? 
She didn’t quite understand... 
Lin Yebai saw her fall silent again, her hands poking at the fruit with irregular jabs. He stepped forward and picked up a cherry tomato she hadn’t managed to skewer and placed it on her plate. 
"My mother left me and my father when I was very young. She said she didn’t want to live with my father in fear anymore, and so she left when I was six. Since then, I grew up with a friend of my father’s." noveldrama
Ye Ning: "..." 
That seemed to be the first time he had told her about his past. After all these years, she had never heard him mention it; she had thought he would never want anyone to know what he had gone through as a child. 
Ye Ning picked up a cherry tomato and slowly put it in her mouth. 
"After my mother left, it wasn’t long before my father angered someone during a tomb raid, and that person came to his friend’s house to kill me. That year, I was thirteen. Later, his friend died protecting me and something my father had left behind, and his family was killed along with him." 
What? 
The man’s family was killed too? 
Ye Ning’s face paled as she said, "Were they all killed?" 
Lin Yebai’s eyes narrowed with a pained expression that swept over his entire being. Standing there, he looked up at the dazzling lights above for a long time, suppressing the sourness in his eyes before his lips barely moved, "No, there was one survivor..." 
There was one who survived? 
Ye Ning oddly felt relieved, "And what happened after that? What became of you all?" 
She had finally been drawn in by his story and began to ask questions. 
Lin Yebai blinked and took a deep breath, turning his gaze towards her, his eyes soft in a way she had never seen before, "After that, I was rescued, and my father found me. Since then, I’ve never left my father again. As for my mother, she never appeared from beginning to end, so you might understand now why I’ve always been cold towards her, right?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
His shift in topic was so rapid that she hadn’t recovered from the tension of his assassination story, and he had already moved on to his mother. 
It felt strange! 
And what about the other survivor? 
Ye Ning slowly chewed the round little fruit in her hand, feeling an inexplicable discomfort in her heart.
Ps: I recommend my friend Long Jiuyue’s thrilling supernatural rebirth novel "Regimental Leader’s Pet Wife: The Strongest Military Spouse’s Rebirth," for those who are interested ^_^ ^_^ ^_^
###Chapter 423: Chapter 423 The lights suddenly all went out!
The two were chatting there when suddenly a voice came from the living room, "Sir..." 
It was Xiaojin! 
Lin Yebai saw her, so he put down the fruit plate he was holding, "I’ll go over there for a moment, and I’ll have Xiaoyu come to find you later." 
Ye Ning nodded but said nothing. 
As soon as Lin Yebai left, only the mother and son were left by the dining table. Ye Ning saw this and said to Little Baozi, whose little belly was already round from eating, "Xiaobao, should we head out? You’ve almost eaten enough." 
Ye Xiaobao immediately raised his little head, smeared with food, "Mom, are we leaving so soon? The banquet hasn’t even started yet." 
"But you’re already full, aren’t you?" 
"No, no, it’s still early. Look at my little belly." After speaking, he patted his chubby little belly with his cream-covered little hand. 
Ye Ning couldn’t help but laugh and cry. 
Already turned into a little ball and still claiming to be hungry? This child is really... 
"Mom, I need to go to the washroom." 
"Wait, I’ll go with you." 
"No need, you just wait here for me, Mom. I know where it is." Ye Xiaobao crawled down from his chair and, without waiting for his mother’s approval, dashed out the door. 
Really, what time is it already, and Uncle Bingshan still hasn’t shown up? If he doesn’t come soon, Mom is going to leave. 
Ye Xiaobao ran swiftly! 
Seeing that he didn’t want her to accompany him, Ye Ning stayed back, cleaning up the messy plates he had left. She started arranging the things he had disordered. 
"Mrs. Qiao’s birthday celebration is truly grand." 
"Yeah, I thought she was quite simple, but I didn’t expect such a large scale event." 
"I heard it was her son who arranged it." 
"Her son?" 
"Yes, the one she had with her ex-husband." 
While tidying up, Ye Ning stood there and overheard the constant gossip of people coming to take food. 
In their conversations, whenever Lin Yebai’s name came up, she could tell from their tones that they were full of admiration and envy, especially when they found out he was still unmarried—the look in those people’s eyes became even brighter. 
Indeed, Lin Yebai, no matter where he appeared, was very attractive; he had a handsome appearance and a refined demeanor. Most importantly, he was a man who had achieved success in his career, which for the ladies, made him the ideal candidate whether as a husband or a son-in-law. noveldrama
Ye Ning listened with some amusement, but seeing so many madams expressing their fondness for him, she sincerely felt happy for him. 
Lin Yebai, setting other things aside, she did truly hope he would find a nice girl for himself. 
But, is his mother really that simple? 
Ye Ning turned her head and glanced at the middle-aged woman surrounded by many madams chatting nearby. Indeed, such a person, from her facial expressions, did not seem the type who liked big crowds. Seeing her speak so indifferently to everyone, it seemed that she would not take pleasure in such grand events. 
So this banquet today, organized so lavishly, was it really held by that man as a way to make amends for the years lost between mother and son? 
Ye Ning lowered her head slightly, looking at the cream on her hand, thinking about finding a place to wash up, when suddenly, "Snap," the lights in the living room all went out. 
"What happened? Why did the lights go out?" 
"Oh my! What’s going on? It couldn’t be another power outage, could it?" 
PS: Supplementing the Chapter I owed from yesterday, looking for a vote^_^^_^^_^
###Chapter 424: Chapter 424: Sudden Great Change
"That really wasn’t a good time, why does this always happen in this school district?" 
"..." 
As the lights went out, the people in the living room were thrown into chaos, and various exclamations came from all around. 
Ye Ning was also surprised. Seeing the surroundings suddenly go dark, she didn’t dare to move, afraid of an accident in this unfamiliar environment. 
However, as she instinctively reached out her hand and failed to find the small figure beside her, a layer of cold sweat suddenly formed on her forehead... 
Oh no, Xiaobao had gone to the restroom; now with the power out and in total darkness, what if he fell? 
She became anxious, glanced at the spots in the living room that had some light, and wanted to find the child, but at that moment, just as the living room went pitch dark, a "click" was heard, followed by a strong beam of light from above, enveloping her completely! 
What’s going on? 
What in the world had happened? 
Startled, she reflexively raised her hand to shield her forehead and looked up at the source of the bright light. 
It was a large spotlight, just like those used on stages, which when switched on, cast a circular beam of light that seemed to concentrate on her intentionally, making her the center of attention in the living room, indeed the entire villa, within a second. 
"What... what on earth is the Qiao Family doing?" 
"Yeah, why are they putting this girl in the spotlight with that light?" 
"I don’t know..." 
The people nearby were also stunned by the scene and started to become restless. 
It was at this time that the pleasant sound of a violin came to attention, and the crowd turned their heads to see that from the direction of the living room leading to the rooms, another beam of light appeared. After a moment bathing in that beam of light, everyone finally saw a seven-tier cake being rolled out, an exceptionally beautiful cake, decorated entirely with dazzling roses, and atop it, a candle shaped like a very rare rose. 
An empty street. 
An empty house. 
A hole inside my heart. 
I’m all alone. noveldrama
And the rooms are getting smaller 
... 
Following the cake, the violinist played the familiar tune of "My Love", dressed in a red dress and moving with graceful steps, pulling the beautiful and lingering melody closer to the center. 
It was truly a romantic sight that took one’s breath away. 
Ye Ning suddenly felt a jolt, her eyes intently fixed on the man who emerged from behind the violinist. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends and family, it’s a pleasure to have all of you here to share in a drink at my mother’s birthday celebration. I, Lin Yebai, would like to extend my thanks to everyone in advance," he said as he came into the light, standing under the candlelight and finally speaking into the microphone. 
As his voice trailed off, there was still no sound around, perhaps they were waiting for what he would say next. 
Everyone except Ye Ning... 
"I think everyone is wondering why this scene has appeared at my mother’s birthday celebration tonight; it’s because I want to take this opportunity to apologize to someone!"
As he finished speaking, the spotlight that had been on him shifted back to Ye Ning. 
It was then that people finally realized what was happening. A collective gasp rose from the crowd, and the next second, all eyes were focused on the girl illuminated by the spotlight.
###Chapter 425: Chapter 425 Because I Love You Too Much
She was a girl whose features weren’t particularly remarkable, but her fair skin and understated makeup made her stand out amidst the many heavily made-up girls, like a refreshing stream amidst them. 
And the dress that appeared tailor-made for her outlined her exquisite figure for all to see. With just a glance, the balance between bold and subtle was just right, making her uniquely refined and pretty. 
It was this girl! 
Seeing her, everyone finally recognized her. It was then, amidst the lighting, the man holding the microphone and pushing the giant cake finally stepped into the spotlight and stood silently in front of her. 
"Aning, I know I’ve gone too far this time. I don’t beg for your forgiveness, but what I want to tell you is, the reason I did that was because—I love you too much!" 
As the words fell, the entire room fell into an eerie silence! noveldrama
That was because—I love you too much! 
This was truly like a bomb that had been dropped suddenly. As it "pop" exploded in the air, not only was Ye Ning stunned, but the surrounding guests were also left gaping at the man. 
So, was this a confession? 
Was he confessing to a girl in such a manner? 
The crowd eventually began to stir, their expressions showing just how shocked they were! 
If he remembered correctly, when this girl came in, she was with a child. So, now that Lin Yebai was confessing to her, did it mean the girl was unmarried? 
An unmarried mother? 
Or... had her husband passed away? 
For a moment, everyone held their breath and turned their attention to the center of the living room. 
Qiao Zhenhua was also shocked; he had no idea about this. Seeing his stepson making such a grand confession to a single mother, his face flushed red with anger: "What is this child doing? He... " 
On the contrary, Mrs. Qiao was calm. Seeing her son declare his love in the spotlight, a smile appeared at the corner of her mouth: "I really like this child." 
"What are you talking about?" 
"Oh, Mom and Dad, please don’t quarrel. Brother has his plans," Qiao Feiyu interjected to stop her parents, her intention being not to disturb her brother. 
But as she quieted her parents, a little carrot-top suddenly appeared among the crowd. Seeing everything that was happening inside and his mother looking dumbfounded, the little boy tried to push his way through. 
"Move aside! Let me through!" 
"Eh? Isn’t that the woman’s son?" 
"Right, he... " 
Before the sentence was completed, suddenly a pair of hands reached out. With a swoop, the child was lifted into an embrace: "Xiaobao, be a good boy and don’t move, Uncle Lin has something very important to discuss with your mom." 
It was Xiaojin! 
Upon seeing who it was, Ye Xiaobao began struggling even harder: "Uncle Xiaojin, let me go, I need to find my mom!" 
Indeed, he needed to find his mom. He had to stop this from happening. His mom didn’t like Uncle Lin, and he couldn’t stand idly by and watch her agree to him. 
Speaking of which, it was all Uncle Bingshan’s fault. He had promised to come, but now there was no sign of him at such a crucial moment. What was going on? Was he lying to him? 
The little boy was feeling truly angry for the first time!
###Chapter 426: Chapter 426: Aning, Will You Marry Me?
But Xiaojin didn’t know what he was thinking. Seeing him struggling, he thought he still wanted to find his mother. So naturally, Xiaojin hugged him tightly and took him out of the living room for a while. 
A four-year-old child suddenly witnessing his mother being proposed to by another man must feel a bit of a gap in his heart, right? 
After all, half of his mother’s love would have to be shared with another man from now on.
That’s what Xiaojin thought, so on his way out, he specifically chose to go to the back yard of the villa. 
In the living room, however, the atmosphere had almost reached a boiling point. Seeing the woman standing before him still looking dazed, Lin Yebai finally took out the ring he had prepared long ago. 
"Aning, can you forgive me?" he asked. 
"..." 
All sounds ceased, all movements froze, and it seemed as if the living room contained only the dazzling ring and the man standing before her, inside that circle of light. 
He said it was because he loved her too much. 
He was still asking if she could forgive him. 
Ye Ning’s vacant gaze shifted inch by inch from his face to the brilliant ring in his hand. Her mind was in such turmoil that it resembled a completely overturned pot, so chaotic that she didn’t even know what she was doing or where she was. 
"Brother Lin, what are you doing?" she asked. 
"I don’t mean anything else. I just want to tell you today, in the presence of my mother and all our family and friends, Aning, that I truly love you!" he said. 
He finally expressed those words, words he had kept hidden for five years. He thought that by keeping them to himself and showing his affection through his actions, she would understand. 
But she never understood, and she ended up falling for someone else. So today, he finally spoke those words out loud. 
Aning, is it still not too late to tell you that I love you? 
However, to his disappointment, as soon as he finished his speech, he saw a sharp contraction in her startled pupils. Immediately, her footsteps instinctively took a big step backward: "Brother Lin, you..." 
"Aning, will you marry me?" he proposed. 
"..." 
Time froze once again! 
And this time, due to his explosively powerful words, the girl standing opposite him was completely dumbfounded and even forgot how to react. 
Was he asking her to marry him? 
Was this a proposal?!! 
Ye Ning was completely astonished, her eyes fixed on the man before her, her mind a total blank... 
"Aning, I love you!" Yebai declared. 
Lin Yebai observed all her expressions and hesitated no more. He reached into the small box, then took out the sparkling ring. 
Today, no matter what, he was determined to put it on her finger. 
He lifted her delicate wrist, and the air suddenly became quiet, filled only with their breaths and the dazzling light that was almost too bright to look at. 
It was a moment so tense it took one’s breath away! 
But just as he was about to slide the ring onto her slender, jade-like finger, there suddenly came footsteps from the garden outside... 
PS: Tonight I’ll be posting an explosive update of 30 Chapters, which also means that the book will be going behind a paywall late tonight. I know this news will be good for some and not so good for others, but the reality is that almost all books in the bookstore require payment now. 
I don’t want to cry about how poor I am, and I ask that you don’t insult me by calling me a liar or anything because I never promised the entire book would be free. I’m a professional author who depends on writing to make a living. I hope for your understanding. If you’re fond of the story, you can continue to follow it, as tonight’s update is going to be incredibly thrilling. For those who don’t care for it, I am grateful for your support along the way. 
Once again, love you guys...noveldrama
###Chapter 427: Chapter 427 He’s Finally Here...1
Those were not the footsteps of one person, but sounded like several. 
The people in the living room subconsciously looked outside, and it was at that moment that a hearty laugh came, "Qiao Zhenhua, I hear your family is hosting a birthday banquet today!" 
At the sound of those words, Qiao Zhenhua standing in the living room immediately looked slightly altered, "The principal? Why is he here?"
Mrs. Qiao was also taken aback and promptly went with her husband to the entrance of the villa’s hall, indeed, the middle-aged man who had already entered the garden was none other than their school principal. noveldrama
"Oh, it’s the principal, please come in, quickly!" 
Seeing who it was, the Qiaos naturally did not dare to neglect and quickly ushered him into the living room. 
However, what seemed odd to the couple was that they stood at the door to welcome him, but the principal, upon entering, actively gave up his front position to the young man who had just entered with him. 
This man, after being given the spot, showed no intention of declining and, after glancing casually around, put his hands in his pockets and stepped into their living room. 
Who was this man? Why was he so imposing that even the principal had to give way to him? 
Mrs. Qiao sensed something was amiss and followed closely after the young man as he entered. 
At that time, the living room was still unlit, maintaining its previous state, with the rose-adorned cake, the dazzling circular light, and within the circle, the man and woman in the midst of an engagement scene. 
It seemed, his timing could not be worse! 
His eyes narrowed slightly, and just as he was about to step in, he paused abruptly, "So it turns out it’s not just a birthday banquet!" 
At the sound of his voice, the two under everyone’s gaze in the circle were struck as if by lightning, and the girl suddenly opened her eyes wide and turned towards the source of the voice. 
The bespectacled man was also startled, but before he could react, the ring he was about to place on her finger slipped as she turned, dropping with a clatter from his hand. 
"Oh my God! The ring has dropped!" 
"Yes, yes, quickly, turn on the lights! Look for it with the lights on!" 
"..." 
The unsuspecting crowd, witnessing this scene, immediately started searching with concern. 
Mrs. Qiao saw it too and quickly had the house servants turn on the lights, and it was at this moment that everyone, finally seeing the light, noticed the figure who had arrived midway to offer his congratulations. 
This was an even more distinguished man, with a tall and erect stature, dressed in a thin black shirt and a pair of finely tailored, slim-fitting trousers, which accentuated his legs even more, his features extraordinarily handsome, and his demeanor exuding a noble chilliness. Standing there with his hands casually tucked into his pockets, he already made everyone feel an overwhelming presence. 
My goodness! 
Who was this man? 
The crowd was stupefied, but only Ye Ning in the center, upon seeing him, firstly brightened, but quickly, upon meeting the cold clarity in his eyes, her lips paled, and emotionlessly, her fingers, as if forgetting the pain, squeezed forcefully, deeply, into her own palm.
###Chapter 428: Chapter 428 He’s Finally Here...2
Why is he here? 
Isn’t he... still hospitalized? Is he well now? 
"President, who is this gentleman...?" In the living room, Qiao Zhenhua and others began to inquire about the identity of the man.
The principal who followed in, upon seeing him, also smiled and patted his hands before introducing him to everyone: "This gentleman right here is a very important figure. He’s Mr. Ou Mucen, the CEO of Ou Group. He came today to talk about the investment contract with our school. Hearing that there’s a banquet at your home, he just stopped by to take a look." 
The CEO of Ou Group?!! 
As soon as these words were spoken, everyone in the living room was buzzing... 
The Ou Group, what place is that? It’s a place in this city that is to be admired from a distance, unreachable. It’s like a palace or a castle, belonging to a completely different world than these humble residential areas. 
But now, their CEO had come here, and how could that not make them ecstatic? 
Qiao Zhenhua was the first to excitedly extend his hand: "I apologize, I apologize. We did not know that President Ou would grace us with his presence. We haven’t welcomed you from afar; please forgive us." 
Ou Mucen still had no expression on his face, his pair of deep black eyes that showed not a glint of light were still staring at a certain spot in front of him: "So the banquet at Professor Qiao’s home today, it’s not a birthday, but an engagement?" 
Qiao Zhenhua was momentarily startled: "No, no, no, today is truly my dear wife’s birthday banquet. As for that, it’s not engagement, he actually is..." 
"Ou Mucen, what exactly do you want?" 
Qiao Zhenhua was trying to explain, but at this moment, someone in the living room suddenly interrupted him. And this person calling the CEO of the Ou Group by his full name took everyone there by surprise once again. 
He actually called him by his name; is he very familiar with the CEO of Ou Group? 
In an instant, everyone’s gaze turned to the person who interrupted Qiao Zhenhua. 
Ye Ning was no exception! 
It was Lin Yebai. At this moment, his expression as he stared at the man by the door was very angry and extremely stern, just like that time at the banquet in Japan. 
What is he trying to do? noveldrama
She remembered those things and almost subconsciously, her complexion turned pale and she started to feel cold. 
Ou Mucen also looked over here, but his demeanor remained very calm. However, his breath turned slightly colder when he saw the woman standing in front of him and he spoke: "I don’t want anything specific. I just want to say, if you really are engaged, then it’s fortunate I stumbled upon it today. Since we’re acquainted, I can give you a grand wedding gift!" 
As he spoke, Ye Ning standing there suddenly felt as if something had fiercely pricked her at the bottom of her heart, leaving her lips devoid of any color. 
Is he saying... he’s going to give them a grand gift? 
Her fingers clenched tighter and tighter, completely disregarding the sharp nails that had already sunk deep into her own flesh. 
Lin Yebai, upon hearing this, seemed quite pleased and stared at the man for a long while before suddenly laughing: "Of course, it’s true. President Ou, if you don’t mind, we can send you an invitation when we get married." 
"..." 
"..." 
Ye Ning turned her head to look at him, her eyes full of anger and trembling. 
What in the world is he talking about? Has he gone mad? 
The man opposite, upon hearing this, understandably fell silent, his eyes fixed over here, as icy as if tempered, even a single glance was enough to send chills!
###Chapter 429: Chapter 429 He’s Finally Here...3
Ye Ning’s heart sank. She wanted to explain, she wanted to deny, but under such a gaze, it was as if her mind had lost the ability to think. All she had was a blank, nothing else. 
Yes, with that kind of look in his eyes, that kind of attitude, he probably wouldn’t believe anything she said. Moreover, when they were in Japan, she had already let him see with his own eyes that she was the one plotting against him and "the one who’d kill him". 
Ye Ning fiercely closed her eyes! 
She thought he would just leave, but at that moment, in the now silent living room, suddenly there came the sound of leather shoes treading on the floor, approaching from the outside. 
Her heart skipped a beat for no reason, and her eyes abruptly flew open again. 
Indeed, it was a tall figure swiftly closing in, like a beast finally springing into action. In just two or three seconds, he stood in front of her, blocking all her light. noveldrama
"I only have one question for you!" 
"Hmm?" 
"Have you ever thought about killing me?" 
His words came out one by one, as if squeezing from his chest, he loomed over her, his eyes dark red, like a wolf on the verge of pouncing! 
Yes, this was the real reason he came here today. 
He already knew her real identity, and he was aware she was using him. All that, he could pretend not to see, could act as if he was ignorant. 
But regarding the matter of killing him, he couldn’t do it. If it were true, he swore, he would tear her to pieces. 
Ye Ning’s mouth dropped open. She had never expected that he would come to her to ask such a question. 
Had she ever thought about killing him? 
Of course not, not from the beginning to the end. 
But if she said so, would he believe her? 
Ye Ning stared unwaveringly at this man, her throat somewhat dry, her heart also beat fiercely, like a drum, almost leaping out of her chest. 
"If I say no! Would you believe me?" 
"..." 
Ou Mucen looked at her, and after a long while, he actually nodded: "If you say so, I will believe." 
Ye Ning was stunned! 
He said he would believe? A man who since childhood had trusted no one, who always relied on his own intuition, was now saying to someone who had repeatedly taken advantage of him, "he would believe it if only she said no"? 
Suddenly, Ye Ning’s eyes reddened, and her chest began to heave in irregular rhythms, overwhelmed with emotion: "Fine, then I tell you, no!" 
"..." 
With those simple two words, she let them out! 
As she let them go, she felt as if a heavy burden was lifted, and it felt like she was relieved. Days of oppression, guilt, and discomfort appeared to vanish in that moment. 
She truly had never thought about killing him! 
And she didn’t know that on the other side, the man questioning her also felt a loosening of all the tension in his body after she finally answered with "no". 
Ji Chengzhi was right, some things are better asked face to face to get them clear. 
Having obtained the answer he wanted, he lost any interest in staying, so he prepared to leave: "Where is Xiaobao?" 
"Ah?" 
"Bring him with you, I’ll wait for you outside!" He said just that, then turned and left without looking back. 
The remaining people in the living room stared at his departing figure, stunned for a long time, unable to react. 
What did that mean? 
He was letting this girl from the house go back with him? What was their relationship? Wasn’t he here to casually celebrate Mrs. Qiao’s birthday?
###Chapter 430: Chapter 430 He’s Finally Here... 4
Also, when he first came in, the young master of the Lin Family seemed to recognize him, so why does he still want to take this girl away now? 
Everyone was confused, their gazes all converged on the two people in the middle of the living room. 
Lin Yebai never expected that man to pull such a move in the end. Looking at the figure standing dumbfounded in front of him, he suddenly panicked, not waiting for her decision, he came over and grabbed her, "I’ll take you guys home first!" 
"Hmm?" 
Ye Ning was indeed still dazed. The words the man had said were so unexpected; she hadn’t foreseen them at all! 
Was he saying he was waiting for her outside? 
He wasn’t angry, but instead, he was saying he was waiting outside for her, wanting to take her back? 
In an instant, the blood in her veins felt as though it had come to life, the pounding, racing, joyous sensations all surged to the top of her head, making her forget what she even wanted to do.
Until she heard another sentence by her ear, "I’ll take you guys home!" 
Take them home? 
To where? 
Her eyes adjusted their focus for a moment before she finally looked at the man beside her gripping her, "Where are you taking me back to?" 
"Back home, of course!" 
"Back home? Back to the place where I’m under house arrest? Lin Yebai, I’m not your captive delicacy!" She finally managed to say these words out loud, one by one, her voice calm, her articulation clear, definitely not the kind of things one blurts out when they’ve lost their sanity. 
Yes, these words, she had wanted to say them for a long time, but she had kept them buried in her heart, not voicing them out of consideration for his kindness towards her, out of concern for his feelings. 
But in reality, both she and he knew that she, Ye Ning, was like a bird he kept in a cage, a bird that belonged solely to him. 
Lin Yebai’s face finally turned ashen. He wanted to say something else, but at this moment, the girl had already started to pry his fingers off one by one. noveldrama
Just like that, watching helplessly as she pried his fingers open one by one! 
Xiaojin, seeing this from the side, finally couldn’t bear it anymore, came over, and said indignantly, "Aning, do you really need to be so heartless? Even if the sir has made mistakes, he is the one who gave you a second chance at life. Do you really need to leave him all alone in front of so many people?" 
Ye Ning suddenly raised her head, "Is it me who is leaving him behind? I knew nothing about today’s event from start to finish. None of you came to ask for my consent before arranging all this. Now that I am unwilling, am I the one who is leaving him behind?" 
That’s right, she knew absolutely nothing about today’s event. Faced with such a sudden turn, did she not even have the right to resist? This was about her lifetime happiness. 
However, this assistant who was questioning her seemed to have not considered her standpoint at all. As soon as her words landed, he immediately started to ! 
"Even so, the sir wanted to give you a surprise, that’s why he did it. Aning, how the sir has treated you all these years, don’t you know by now? Just because of Ou Mucen, whom you’ve only known for a few months, do you feel the sir is wrong in everything he does? Aning, one should be conscientious. You can’t treat the sir like this just because you’ve taken a liking to another man. If not for the sir, by now you would probably..." 
"Slap—" 
Before the sentence was finished, suddenly a figure came forward and swung a slap across his face; "Get out!" 
It was Lin Yebai! 
Nobody expected that at this moment, he would actually strike his own assistant.
###Chapter 431: Chapter 431 He’s Finally Here...5
Everyone in the living room was stunned, including Ye Ning, who also stared at the man in complete shock. 
What was he doing? 
Why did he suddenly want to hit Xiaojin? 
"Brother..." 
"Get out, all of you!!" He roared like a wild beast that had completely lost its reason. After his shout, with a kick, he toppled the gigantic cake as well. 
The cake was so large, and with that kick, it was instantly overturned, causing a loud noise in the living room. With a slap, many cake fragments scattered all around, frightening the guests so much that in no time they all fled from the living room. 
Qiao Zhenhua and his wife stood there, seeing this scene, both dropping to their feet and beating their chests, "Yebai, what on earth are you doing? This is your mother’s birthday party, look at what you’ve done!" 
Lin Yebai was panting like a bull, but he didn’t offer half an explanation! 
Ye Ning also stood rooted to the spot, not having expected the situation to end up like this. Looking at the mess on the floor, and the dispirited old couple opposite her, finally, she took her son by the hand and went over, "Professor Qiao, Mrs. Qiao, I’m sorry, for today’s incident, I..." 
"You leave, our Lin Family doesn’t deserve such a precious daughter-in-law!" As soon as she opened her mouth, Mrs. Qiao was extremely harsh. 
Ye Ning’s hand whitened as she gripped her son’s small hand tightly, her eyes flickering, finally, she said no more and left the place with her child... 
What had she done wrong? 
—— 
Coming out of the villa with her child, outside, indeed there was a very familiar Bentley parked. She saw it, so after taking a deep breath, she finally went over. 
After getting into the car, Ye Ning thought he might ask something after seeing those guests who had frantically escaped from the villa, but even after both mother and son got in, he hadn’t made a sound, just turned the key and started the car as soon as they were inside. 
How strange was this man? noveldrama
However, once Ye Xiaobao got into the car, seeing his uncle, he excitedly asked, "Uncle, I thought you weren’t coming!" 
Ye Ning was startled again! 
However she heard it, that sounded so odd. What did he mean he thought he wasn’t coming? Could it be this little brat knew all along he was going to come? 
Ye Ning felt a jolt, just about to ask, but at this moment, the man driving in front spoke indifferently, "What? Don’t you want your mom to marry that Uncle Lin?" 
Ye Xiaobao shook his head, "That doesn’t really have anything to do with me, mainly, Mom doesn’t want to!" 
"Xiaobao!!!" 
Ye Ning suddenly felt a choke in her chest, almost dying of anger because of this child! 
This little brat, how could he speak such nonsense? Did he know that by saying this, he was causing her to lose face entirely? 
But the child, as if he hadn’t heard her warning, was still chatting with the uncle up front, "You don’t know, just now Uncle Lin almost scared my mom silly." 
"Really?" 
"Yeah, she didn’t know anything before coming, being able to hold out until you arrived was already impressive." 
"..." 
This conversation was too much for her!
With her face and neck turning red, Ye Ning, in a fit of desperation, covered the mouth of that little rascal and pressed him firmly against the car window, forbidding him from making another sound. 
This little menace, she would definitely deal with him properly when they got back!
###Chapter 432: Chapter 432 He’s Finally Here...6
Ou Mucen was still waiting for the child behind him to speak when he suddenly realized there was no sound anymore. Glancing through the rear-view mirror, he caught sight of the scene, and instantly, the corner of his eyes twitched fiercely, and a handsome curvature formed on the edge of his thin lips... 
—— 
Twenty minutes later, downtown, Platinum Apartments— 
Ye Ning stared blankly at the high-end apartments outside, and after a while, she finally asked, "Why did you come here? I live..." 
"I still have something to do, you go up first, I’ll take you back when I return." 
Then, he pressed the car door. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning had no choice but to open the door and exit the car with her child. 
It’s this late, and he still has things to do? 
She watched as the silhouette that disappeared quickly into the traffic flow after they got out of the car, and in the end, she still entered the high-end apartment complex with her child, arriving at the apartment where he lived. 
At the entrance to the apartment, she thought she would have to waste a lot of words with the security at the door again, but unexpectedly, once they got there, Little Baozi, who was in her arms, suddenly stretched out his little hand and pressed it against the fingerprint lock. 
"Confirm, unlock!" noveldrama
With a click, the lock actually opened! 
Ye Ning was shocked, staring dumbstruck at her son in her arms, her expression as if she had seen a ghost, "Why can you open this lock?" 
Ye Xiaobao raised his chubby little finger proudly, "Of course, uncle had my fingerprint recorded. He said I’m the second person in his house. Mommy, do you want to get yours recorded too, to become the third?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
She just stared at the little rascal for a long while, finally, she put him down on the ground, and without caring about anything else, she went inside. 
Traitor! 
Judas!! 
The mother and son entered the elevator one after the other, arriving at the apartment where Ou Mucen lived. Indeed, when entering the door, it was Ye Xiaobao’s fingerprint that opened it. 
Ye Ning glared at him bitterly, but said nothing, and went straight inside. 
Once inside, it was still the familiar layout, just as immaculately clean and tidy, but because it had been unoccupied for such a long time, the windows and doors had been shut, leading to an air filled with the strong scents of disinfectant and cleaning products, which was a bit uncomfortable to smell. 
So after Ye Ning came in, she first went and opened the windows and doors, and then went to the kitchen to find a kettle, starting to boil some water. 
"Mommy, I feel a bit unwell. My body is very itchy." Ye Xiaobao had been playing on his own after coming in, but as he played, the clothes he had sweated in at the Qiao Family’s house, being a child who loves cleanliness, made him start clamoring for a bath. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning had no choice but to take him to the bathroom. 
Once in the bathroom, she remembered that the last time they were here, because his clothes had gotten wet, there seemed to be a set of clothes left in this place, so she thought about finding them: "Xiaobao, do you know where you put your clothes from last time?" 
Ye Xiaobao shook his head in the bathroom, "Don’t know. You should go look in uncle’s bedroom, he has a wardrobe there." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
She couldn’t just randomly rummage through someone else’s wardrobe, and after all, he was a man. 
But considering her son had no clothes to wear, in the end, she still pushed open the door to the master bedroom and, like a thief, tiptoed inside. 
It was a bedroom completely decorated in cool tones, with a black and white wardrobe, a snow-white bed, covered with a deep grey bedsheet devoid of any patterns—a style indicative of a single man, simple and tidy, much like him, someone who dislikes any superfluities.
###Chapter 433: Chapter 433 He’s Finally Here... 7
Ye Ning took a deep breath when she saw it and finally made her way to his wardrobe, opening it at last. 
However, to her surprise, the closet was impeccably clean. As soon as she opened it, perfectly ironed clothes hung neatly like one would see in high-end fashion store displays, leaving anyone who saw it in awe! 
Above it all, there was a layer full of his folded ties, socks, and boxer shorts?!! 
Ye Ning suddenly "bang" closed the door and, with her face flushed red, rushed out! 
Ye Xiaobao had been waiting in the bathroom all this time, and when he saw his mother finally emerge, he peeked out with his little head, "Mom, did you find it?" 
Ye Ning, not daring to look at her son, grabbed a towel and went into the bathroom, "No, it must not be there. Just wash up for now, we’re going home soon anyway. Just wear that outfit for now." 
Ye Xiaobao looked at his mom with disbelief. 
Her face so red, she was clearly lying... 
But since she had said so, Ye Xiaobao took a bath and then put on the same outfit before he and his mother started waiting in the living room, watching TV. 
It was unclear how long they waited, Ye Xiaobao even fell asleep, and Ye Ning started to feel drowsy herself when she finally heard the sound of the door lock being opened outside. Immediately, she opened her eyes and stood up from the couch. 
"You’re back?" 
The one entering was indeed him, but his complexion seemed a bit off, and his steps lacked their usual steadiness. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning immediately went over to support him, "Are you all right? Have you been drinking?" 
He didn’t speak, but it was clear he felt extremely unwell. As soon as he got in, he ran straight to the washroom and Ye Ning stood outside, hearing the sounds of retching. 
What was he doing? He was still sick, so why would he drink? 
Ye Ning was too worried and hurried to the kitchen to pour him a glass of water. 
After getting the water ready and bringing it over, the vomiting sounds from the washroom also stopped. So she stood there, knocking on the door anxiously, "Ou Mucen, are you okay? Do you want me to call Doctor Ji? Let him come over and check on you." 
"No need!" 
Hearing the mention of calling Ji Chengzhi, the person inside the washroom quickly responded. 
After saying just that, the sound of running water finally ceased, and Ye Ning stood there, watching as the washroom door was finally opened. 
Indeed, after throwing up, he looked even worse as he emerged and leaned on the door frame. He glanced at the glass of water in her hands, took it from her, and drank it down. 
"You and Xiaobao stay here for tonight and I’ll take you back tomorrow," he said after drinking the water, placing the glass back in her hands. 
Ye Ning paused, and then quickly nodded in agreement, "Okay..." 
Of course, she would not refuse. He was in such a state now; how could she let him drive? noveldrama
And besides, she would worry if she went back now. 
So after he went into his bedroom, she picked up the child from the couch and took him to another room. 
The apartment was very spacious, with four rooms in total, making it completely fine for them to stay over. Moreover, since a cleaning service was employed, every room, including the furnishings and linens, was clean and tidy.
###Chapter 434: Chapter 434 He’s Finally Here... 8
After putting the child to sleep in a room not too far from the living room, she became a bit worried about the people over there, so she came out from the room and headed toward the master bedroom. 
"Ou Mucen?" 
Upon reaching the master bedroom, she saw the man who had lain down on the bed without even taking off his clothes. She hurriedly called out and went in. 
However, even though she had entered, the person lying on the bed still had no reaction. Upon closer inspection, she realized that he had already fallen asleep, but his breathing was abnormally heavy and his forehead was covered with a fine layer of cold sweat. 
He couldn’t be in some kind of trouble, could he? 
Seeing this scene, she became even more worried, afraid that something had gone wrong with him, and finally, she picked up the phone and called the doctor. 
"Hello..." 
"Dean Ji, this is An Ning. Mr. Ou doesn’t seem to be doing well right now, do you think you should come and have a look?" 
"An Ning?" 
On the phone, the young dean didn’t show concern for the condition of the man she mentioned, but after hearing her name, he paused for a moment, "You’re at his house?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Standing in the living room with a blush on her face, she awkwardly nodded her head after a while, "Yeah, I..." 
"So that’s how it is, and here I was wondering why he insisted on going back there," the person on the phone said.
"Ah? What are you saying?" 
"Nothing much. How is he doing right now?" Finally, the person on the phone began to inquire about the important matter. 
Upon hearing the question, Ye Ning quickly described the condition of the person lying in the room. As she mentioned that he had vomited after coming back and was still in poor condition, her voice even began to tremble a bit. 
Ji Chengzhi listened to her description, and when he heard the urgency in her voice, he relaxed a bit while sitting in the car, "It’s probably due to excessive fatigue causing abdominal pressure. I’ll bring some medication over, and I’ll call you when I arrive." 
"Okay!" 
Ye Ning, hearing this, quickly responded and hung up the phone. 
She actually had no idea where he had been that day, but she knew that he was still a patient. Just six days ago, he had been extensively reported in the news as being gravely ill and admitted to the ICU. And now, just a short six days later, not only had he left the hospital to visit the Qiao Family, but he had also gone somewhere else earlier. 
Ye Ning, clutching her phone, anxiously paced back and forth in the living room. 
Fortunately, it wasn’t long before Ji Chengzhi called back, instructing her to go down and get the medication. 
Ye Ning, upon hearing this, hurriedly dashed downstairs. 
After descending the floors, she arrived at the entrance of the apartment complex and immediately spotted the silver Mercedes parked on the side of the road, so she quickly approached, "Dean Ji..." 
Ji Chengzhi rolled down the window and handed her the medication he had brought, "Have him drink these after you get back. And remember, you must take him to the hospital tomorrow morning. In his condition, he could be in great danger." 
Ye Ning nodded vigorously, "I understand, I’ll make sure to take him." noveldrama
Ji Chengzhi, satisfied, was about to close the car door when suddenly he thought of something and turned his gaze back to her, "An Ning, I hope this time, you won’t let him down again." 
Ye Ning froze in place! 
"Dean Ji, what do you mean by that?" 
"My meaning is simple. You saw what happened today. He went to that place disregarding his own health for you and nearly missed the shareholders’ meeting because of you."
###Chapter 435: Chapter 435 He’s Finally Here...9
"My point is simple," you saw what happened today—he ran to that place regardless of his own health for you and almost missed the shareholder’s banquet because of you. So, I don’t care who you were before or where you came from. In any case, now that he has still chosen you, please cherish him well. Otherwise, I will be the first one to not let you off!" 
The last sentence was delivered with considerable sternness! 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s face immediately turned white. She wanted to say something, but in the end, she found herself unable to retort under his piercing gaze. 
He was right. Throughout this whole ordeal, she was the one at fault toward that man. She approached him with an agenda, used him, and in the end, after she finally gained his trust, she nearly killed him. 
She remembered that not long ago, in the Qiao Family’s living room, the question he asked her in front of so many people as he walked up to her. 
He asked, "Have you ever thought about killing me?" 
He had come all this way just to ask her that one question. Previously, she didn’t quite understand, but now, she suddenly got it all! 
That was his opportunity for her, a chance for him to trust and accept her again! 
Finally, Ye Ning lowered her eyes and, holding the medicine bottle, she heavily nodded her head, "I understand!" 
Ji Chengzhi, seeing she had agreed, finally felt relieved. Then, he started the car and quickly disappeared at the end of the road. 
He didn’t really want to be so blunt, but his brother had always been a person who disliked showing his feelings. Whatever was on his mind, he kept inside. Just like tonight’s incident—if he hadn’t told her that he went to the Qiao Family specifically for her, she would probably continue to think his visit was a coincidence. 
So, as a brother, when necessary, he should stand up for him and let others clearly see just how important she was to him. 
Ji Chengzhi sighed... 
—— 
Ye Ning quickly returned to the apartment with the medicine. At this time, the man lying on the bed in the room was so drenched in sweat, he looked as if he had been pulled out of the water. 
"Ou Mucen? Ou Mucen, wake up and take your medicine!" 
Seeing him lying there all sweaty, she reached out and pushed him. 
After a couple of shoves, finally, the deeply suffering Ou Mucen, who had been sleeping troubledly, opened his eyes, "Hmm?" 
Ye Ning quickly bent down, "Get up and take your medicine. I called Dean Ji, and he sent over some medication. He said your abdominal pressure was too high, causing wound inflammation, and told you to take these." 
After speaking, she handed over the medicine she was holding. noveldrama
Having just woken up, Mucen was still a bit groggy. Seeing the medicine in her palm, he lay in bed and asked, "You called Chengzhi?" 
Ye Ning nodded, "You looked so terrifying just now. I was afraid something would happen to you, so..." 
"Give me the medicine," he interrupted her, opening his eyes. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning hurriedly placed the medicine on the bedside table and then bent down to help him sit up from the bed. 
He was indeed in bad shape. He had slept for a while yet his head and upper body still felt incredibly heavy. If it wasn’t for the pillow propping him up, Ye Ning almost doubted if she could even support him.
###Chapter 436: Chapter 436 He’s Finally Here... 10
It wasn’t easy, but she managed to help him up, and quickly passed him the medicine and some warm water. 
"Director Ji said that after you take this medicine, you’ll feel better," she said. 
"Mhm!" 
He took the pills and swallowed them in one gulp. 
Ye Ning sighed in relief when she saw this. Noticing that he was sweating profusely, both on his forehead and body, she asked, "Do you want to take a bath? I can run the water for you if you’d like." 
Ou Mucen leaned there for a while, and perhaps the medicine really did make him feel somewhat better. Eventually, he nodded and agreed, "Yeah, please fetch my pajamas from the closet."noveldrama
The closet? 
Ye Ning, recalling that she had opened his closet before he came back, suddenly felt a bit awkward: "I don’t know where you put them?" 
"On the left side, the second cabinet," he said, and as if he remembered something else, he added, "And Xiaobao’s clothes from last time, in the fourth one." 
Then, he got up from the bed and went to the bathroom. 
Xiaobao’s clothes? 
Why did he suddenly bring that up? Did he know she had looked for Xiaobao’s clothes? 
Ye Ning’s cheeks flushed without reason once more, and seeing him enter the bathroom, she hurried over to the closet. 
Indeed, opening the fourth cabinet, she found Xiaobao’s clothes neatly folded on the second shelf, likely washed by his house cleaner. 
Next to the children’s outfit, she also spotted a dark green shirt, which was very familiar to her. 
Wasn’t this the shirt she had washed with shower gel in a hotel in that small town in B City when he had a fever last time? 
Ye Ning paused, recalling how when she had previously opened the closet, his clothes were always neatly ironed and hung on hangers. But why was this one folded and placed here? Moreover, she hadn’t seen him wear it since they returned. 
Puzzled, she picked up the shirt and smelled it, only to find that it still carried the scent of the shower gel from the hotel. 
Strange! 
Ye Ning was confused, standing there lost in thought when suddenly a voice came from the bathroom, "An Ning, go get some gauze from the medicine box for me." 
Gauze? 
Hearing this, Ye Ning’s expression changed and she hurriedly shut the closet door, heading over to the bathroom: "What happened? Is something wrong?" 
Inside the bathroom, the man standing in front of the washbasin had taken off his outer garments, and at that moment, was furrowing his brows at his lifted shirt, looking at the wound on his abdomen in the mirror. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning was startled: "Good heavens, the wound dressing has come off? How did that happen?" 
Ou Mucen frowned: "It must have lost its adhesiveness due to excessive sweating, leading it to split open. First, help me get the gauze." 
"Yeah, okay!" Ye Ning responded and quickly went to find the gauze. 
Shortly, she found the gauze and some disinfectant, which seemed to be prepared by him in advance. 
With the items in hand, Ye Ning felt that since this had happened, he shouldn’t bathe; getting the wound wet could cause trouble. However, this man, who had a severe obsession with cleanliness, couldn’t tolerate the smell of sweat on his body for a moment and insisted on bandaging the wound with gauze before washing. 
Seeing that there was no dissuading him, Ye Ning sighed and grabbed a clean towel hanging nearby: "Then let me help you wash."
###Chapter 437: Chapter 437: She was pressed there! 1
"What?" 
Ou Mucen was confused for a moment, "You’re going to wash me?" 
Ye Ning quickly explained, "No, that’s not what I mean. Don’t misunderstand, I meant... I can use a wet towel to wipe you down first, just like we did in Japan, and then... You can have a proper wash at the hospital tomorrow." 
When she mentioned the word "Japan," her tone naturally paused for a moment, as if she was afraid he would be upset. 
Japan, for him, probably wasn’t a very happy memory. 
However, what she didn’t expect was that after she had said this, the man standing in front of the bathroom sink looking at himself in the mirror, after thinking it over, actually agreed to her suggestion, "But I want my entire body wiped." 
"Ah?" 
"My whole body is uncomfortable!" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Standing there, her face flushed red as she stared at the man for a long time, eventually, she still plunged the towel into the sink filled with hot water. 
Whether he meant his whole body or not, they would address that later. Perhaps she wouldn’t even have wiped him down twice when he might become uncomfortable again, deeming her clumsy, just like before in Japan. 
So, after preparing the hot water, the man finally began to unbutton his clothes, one by one. 
This was a mature man, 28 years old, ripe both mentally and physically. Ye Ning didn’t dare to look, but her heart was already beating furiously, thumping loudly. 
Back in Japan, when she wiped his body, he hadn’t been very lucid, and plus, he had been bedridden, hardly able to react. 
But now it was different, apart from the wound, he was normal, and here she was, a woman, about to wipe down his body right in front of him. Wasn’t that a bit improper? 
Ye Ning smelled the strong, distinctively male hormone scent that filled the air as soon as his clothes were opened, and her entire face turned so red it seemed it might start dripping blood. 
It was a very strong and muscular body, with a stature over six feet tall, his skin very pale, the result of years of pampered living, but healthy nonetheless—strong bones and powerful muscles. If it weren’t for the wound on his lower right abdomen, she could almost see his abs. 
Such a physique was so perfect it could make someone’s nose bleed! 
"Do you like what you see?" 
"Ah?" 
"Do you need a tissue?" 
"..." 
!!!! 
Ye Ning was truly... 
Immediately, she tossed the towel into the water, bowed her head, and didn’t dare to look at him anymore. 
The man still standing there caught a glimpse of amusement in his deep eyes and didn’t tease her any further. He casually stood there, waiting for her to help him wipe down. 
Shortly after, when she saw the girl’s fair and delicate fingers wring out the towel in the sink, a faint citrus scent passed by her nose. She took the towel and went behind him, "Is the temperature okay?" 
He nodded, "Mmm..." 
It felt like the gentle scratching of a kitten’s paws on his skin, soft and tender, which inexplicably made his heart start to soften. 
After a while, when she was done wiping his back, she drained the water from the sink and filled it with fresh warm water, then, with the towel, she moved to his front. 
"Do you... want me to add some shower gel?" noveldrama
"No need!" 
The scent of shower gel, it’s all chemical ingredients, but her scent was the most natural and sweet citrus fragrance. He would have to be foolish to prefer that stuff over hers.
###Chapter 438: Chapter 438 She Was Pinned Down There 2
The girl, hearing that he didn’t need it, extended her nervous little hand toward his chest. 
She used the same strength as before when she was behind him, but now, facing him, she dared not look into his eyes. The cleaning became uneven, a bit hurried, and somewhat perfunctory, as if she wanted to get it over with quickly. 
Ou Mucen saw this and looked down at her, discovering a face so tender it seemed as if it could drip water at a touch, with skin like milk, delicate and lustrous. Her eyes, which she kept lowered, hid her glazed-colored pupils under her eyelids. Her long eyelashes, hanging down, were as distinct as if painted on, thick and curling, like a doll’s, extremely beautiful. 
Ou Mucen felt a sudden stir in the depths of his heart, and his gaze, for some reason, settled on her slightly parted lips. 
They were lusciously red, like perfectly ripe cherries, slightly quivering, looking irresistibly tempting... 
... 
Ye Ning was still wiping his robust body, but as she did so, she suddenly felt something was amiss—there seemed to be a pair of eyes fixated on her from above. 
What was that? 
She paused and looked up at him, only to have his breath envelop her from above. She caught sight of this and immediately panicked, her eyes crashing into his which were also looking down at her with an unfathomable depth, her whole being becoming as frazzled as a startled fawn. 
This was a dangerously alluring aura! 
She sensed it and wanted to escape, but before she could even take a step, the man standing before her reached out with his large hand and arrogantly encircled her slender waist. 
"Ou... Ou Mucen..." 
"..." 
The man didn’t speak, just fixed her with his darkened eyes.
What... what was he going to do? 
Ye Ning panicked, feeling his hand grip her waist. Her hands, clutching a towel, instinctively moved to push him away, but at that moment, he suddenly lowered his head, and without any warning, his lips once again authoritatively covered all her breath. 
Ou Mucen! 
Ye Ning’s eyes widened, an unexpected kiss sending a momentary shock and stupefaction across her face, and her breathing halted as if it stopped altogether. 
This wasn’t her first kiss with him, but the previous ones were not under normal conditions—there were accidents, times of lost rationality, and even that time in Japan, she believed, he definitely wasn’t sober when he kissed her. noveldrama
But this time, she could clearly ascertain that this kiss, under his completely normal condition, had to mean something. So, did he kiss her this time because he truly liked her? 
Her heart pounded madly, in complete disarray. 
Ou Mucen, however, wasn’t thinking that much. He only knew that once he covered her breathing entirely, he monopolized her unique scent of lime, a fragrance he adored. For some reason, he couldn’t articulate the pleasure of his gentle and lingering taste. 
This was undoubtedly his most uncharacteristic moment! 
Ye Ning had completely lost any ability to resist, her body softening under his assault until she could barely stand.
###Chapter 439: Chapter 439: She was pressed there! 3
It wasn’t until his restlessness grew, and the large palm clasping her slender waist began to drift upwards, that she managed to claw back a shred of rationality. Her tender hands began to push his scorching body away: "Mmm... You can’t, you... you still have an injury..." 
... 
This sentence seemed to bring the man’s previously scattered and hazy eyes into reluctant focus. 
An injury? 
Damn injury! 
He withdrew his hand that had strayed to her sensitive areas, and his rationality also returned bit by bit. 
Feeling this, Ye Ning quickly used all her strength to push him, and managed to shove him away. Her beautiful eyes, filled with moisture and mist, stared at him in panic like a frightened deer. 
This jerk, how could he... how could he... 
"You... go ahead by yourself, I’m leaving!" 
She didn’t dare stay any longer, tossing the towel in her hand aside, she bolted like a rabbit, clutching her burning face, fleeing in disarray. 
So embarrassing! 
How could she have been kissed by him again? 
Returning to her room, she slammed the door shut, and without even taking a bath, she dived straight under the covers and buried herself... 
---- 
She was sleepless through the night. noveldrama
The next morning, after only a fitful doze just before dawn, Ye Ning was awakened by her son. 
"Mommy, I want to pee." 
"Hmm? Okay, Mommy will take you." Ye Ning crawled out of bed, still half asleep, and carried her son off the bed. 
They had never lived in this apartment before, and although Xiaobao was smart for his four years, she still worried he might go the wrong way, so she decided to personally take him to the bathroom. 
However, as she carried her son out of the room, she was surprised to see the living room outside already brightly lit, and a tall figure stood there, a maid in a uniform at his side. 
"Young Master Ou, I’ve bought the items. Should I make it now?" 
"Hmm..." 
He responded with a faint "Hmm," and moved to the water dispenser with a glass in hand to pour water. 
Seeing this, and recalling the events of the previous night, Ye Ning’s face showed a hint of discomfort. She was about to take her son to the bathroom unnoticed when Little Baozi in her arms suddenly perked up: "Uncle, you’re back?" 
This little rascal! 
Ou Mucen, who was pouring water on the other side, heard someone call out from behind and turned his lean figure around: "Hmm, I’m back. Are you awake?" 
Ye Xiaobao immediately flashed a big smile: "I’m awake, Uncle. Wait here for me, I’m going to pee, then I’ll come find you." 
"Hmm, go ahead." 
The man’s gaze seemed to linger on the child, not paying attention to the child’s mother. 
Feeling awkward, Ye Ning set her son down at the bathroom door, letting him enter, and then stood there for quite a while before uncomfortably approaching: "Who is she?" 
"A cleaning lady we hired. What would you like to eat?" 
"Huh?" 
"You can go talk to her yourself." After saying this, he seemed to be losing patience again, placing his water glass down, and he returned to his bedroom. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning realized that he was still wearing his pajamas, meaning he must have gotten up only after the cleaning lady had arrived. 
Does the cleaning lady also cook? 
Ye Ning went to the kitchen and saw the middle-aged maid she had met earlier busily at work. Approaching her, she asked: "Auntie, are you making breakfast?"
###Chapter 440: Chapter 440: She was pressed there! 4
The cleaning lady turned around and saw her, nodding her head, "Mm, the third young master said he wanted to have breakfast at home this morning, so he bought some things on his way here. What would you like to eat, miss?" noveldrama
So it was that man who had asked her to buy them. 
Ye Ning looked at the various fresh ingredients on the stove, and her mood suddenly became very good, "I’m not picky, so let me help you." 
"You help me? Is that really okay?" 
"It’s fine. I’m not very good at cooking, and this is a good opportunity for you to teach me." 
Ye Ning indeed wasn’t much of a cook. At the orphanage, she didn’t have the chance to cook, and when she entered the Ou Family, her duties didn’t involve cooking. Later on, after meeting Lin Yebai, since his culinary skills were already peak level, she never needed to lift a finger. 
Therefore, having lived for so many years, if she had to admit something she wasn’t good at, it would be cooking. 
The cleaning lady eventually agreed, and after Ye Ning tidied up in her room, she came to the kitchen to help. 
When Ou Mucen came out of the bedroom after changing his clothes, what he saw was a scene like this... 
In the living room, a chubby child was crawling all over the floor, looking for his toys, fiddling with his models, and in the kitchen, amidst the floating smoke and mist, a woman wearing his T-shirt, with her hair tied up high, revealing a fair neck and slender legs, stood there with her back to him, following the cleaning lady as she learned how to make soup. 
"The water is boiling now, should I add it in?" 
"Yes, but don’t pour it all in at once, add it slowly." 
"Alright, I’ll remember that..." 
It was a scene he had never seen before: a child, a woman, a house filled with the scent of food... 
He suddenly recalled what his mother had said during her previous visit, about how his place was too desolate. 
She said, "This place of yours, without cooking or lighting a fire, not even a cup of hot water unless it’s done by a cold, soulless machine, makes the room lack any trace of life, it doesn’t feel like a place where people live." 
He used to scoff at those words, but now, looking at this scene, he suddenly seemed to understand what she meant. 
Yes, this scene did seem to have a lot more life, a lot warmer too, and even his heart felt as if something had filled it up. 
"Uncle, are you out yet? Can you help me look at this? Why can’t I fit it together?" 
As he was lost in thought, the milky voice suddenly rang out from the living room, and when he looked down, he realized that the round Little Baozi had already come to his feet. 
Seeing this, his eyes softened, and he bent down to pick him up, "Can’t fit it together? Come on, over there, uncle will teach you." 
"Okay!" 
Little Baozi was delighted and followed his uncle over to the desk area.
Thus, on this morning, this apartment that had been quiet for many years finally experienced the liveliest morning in its history. The morning light was brilliant and the time was beautiful, to the point it was almost dazzling. 
Half an hour later, breakfast was finally ready, and Ye Ning and the cleaning lady brought it over, "Breakfast is ready, we made wontons and glass noodles this morning, come and eat." 
Ye Xiaobao immediately lit up when he heard, "Wontons? Uncle, shall we go have breakfast?" 
Ou Mucen nodded and let him go... 
What are wontons? 
Following them to the table, he saw that in the few small bowls placed there, there were these little things being cooked in soup with some chopped green onions sprinkled on top. They smelled quite nice, but their appearance made him screw up his face a bit.
###Chapter 441: Chapter 441: She was pressed there! 5
"What’s wrong? Doesn’t it look good?" 
Seeing her expression wasn’t quite good, someone suddenly came over from across the table. 
When Ou Mucen saw this, he gathered his gaze and his expression became indifferent again, "What is this?" 
"It’s a dumpling!" 
"A wonton?" 
"Yes, it’s wrapped in dough and then boiled with meat inside. I made them. They might not look very good, but they taste not bad. Try it." 
Ye Ning knew that a young master from a wealthy family like his wouldn’t have eaten such commoner’s food at home, so she passed him a clean spoon and then pushed a small bowl in front of him. 
Ou Mucen glanced at her... 
It seemed that the five years she spent at Blue Mountain Villa weren’t wasted in vain; she knew he never ate such things. 
After pondering for a moment, he sat down in the chair, picked up the spoon from the small bowl, and at that moment, Little Baozi sitting beside him had already eaten several pieces, "Uncle, why aren’t you eating? It’s really tasty." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
He stared at him for a while, finally scooped one from the small bowl, and put it in his mouth. 
It was very smooth upon entering his mouth, and when bitten into, it had that distinct pork flavor, nicely seasoned, neither too salty nor too bland, indeed not bad. 
Ye Ning, standing opposite him, saw that the young master finally started eating. She then went to the kitchen to bring out the rest of the food, and the few of them finished this breakfast at the dining table that was being used for the first time. 
After breakfast, the maid cleared up a bit, and then Ji Chengzhi called Ou Mucen. 
"When are you coming to the hospital? Don’t force me to send an ambulance to pick you up!" As soon as the phone was answered, Ji Chengzhi’s tone wasn’t very pleasant. 
Ou Mucen, holding the phone, gave an indifferent reply, and then hung up. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning guessed who had called and hurriedly tidied up Xiaobao and changed her own clothes, preparing to leave, "It was Director Ji’s call, right? I’ll take you there." 
She had promised Ji Chengzhi yesterday that she would take him to the hospital today; it was her commitment. 
However, after hanging up the phone, when faced with her request, he neither agreed nor disagreed, but went to the bedroom to get his watch and car keys, and then standing there, he suddenly asked, "What are you going to do today?" 
"Huh?" 
Ye Ning was somewhat confused, "I... I’m taking Xiaobao home, and then..." 
What was she going to do afterward? 
She suddenly realized she truly didn’t know what to do. Previously, after being brought back from Japan by Lin Yebai, she had been confined in Jasmine Courtyard. Now that she was free from his restrictions, she really didn’t know what she should do. 
"Fifty percent of Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry’s shares have been transferred to me. If you don’t have anything else to do, could you manage there for me?" 
"What?" 
Ye Ning was stunned when she heard this! 
Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry? 
She hadn’t misheard, had she? He was asking her to manage it? Wasn’t this quite unthinkable? noveldrama
Ye Ning doubted her own ears. After all, regarding Dragon-Phoenix’s affairs, she had heard from Xiaojin back in Jasmine Courtyard that after the incident in Japan, the old master of the Ou Family had come back in a fury and revoked Ou Yuze’s inheritance rights, and gave 50% of the shares of the Longfeng of the second branch of the Ou Family to this man. 
Truth be told, she was very happy when she heard this news, partly because that despicable father and son finally got their comeuppance.
###Chapter 442: Chapter 442: She was pressed there! 6
And another reason was that this man, after being used by her and murdered by Lin Yebai, could come to such an end, her heart laden with sin, was finally eased somewhat. 
But now, he was asking her to help manage his 50% at Dragon-Phoenix? 
Ye Ning, shocked, was a bit confused, "Why... do you want me to help you manage it?" 
Ou Mucen, with his wristwatch on, his expression, extremely calm, "Dragon-Phoenix primarily deals in jewelry, and you understand jewelry. Going there is just right." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Is it that simple? 
Ye Ning looked at the man whose expression revealed no emotions, and suddenly remembered what Lin Yebai had said when he went to pick her up in Japan, in front of her. 
He said he had always been investigating her; it was just that she did not know it. 
So now, he wanted her to go to Longfeng because...? 
"Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry wasn’t mine before. Now that the shares have suddenly been transferred, the company needs someone to watch over it. You were my assistant and have taken over Yuzhirun for a while. Now going to Longfeng is very suitable." 
He finally spoke a second sentence, but this one, just as indifferent, with a starting point still considered from the company’s interest. 
Ye Ning finally fell silent... 
Going to Longfeng, in fact, for her, was indeed an excellent opportunity, Ou Yuze may have lost his inheritance rights, and Longfeng may have lost 50% of its shares, but they had not completely fallen yet. With their methods, maybe they would make a comeback one day? 
So the best method was, to finish them off! 
And now, the man wanted her to go there simply to keep an eye on things. Since that was the case, why not go with the flow? 
Ye Ning finally smiled, "Okay, I’ll go!" 
—— 
An hour later, at The First People’s Hospital, Ji Chengzhi finally waited for that top patient who had "jumped the wall" to arrive at the ward! 
"Heh, finally willing to come back?" 
Seeing this lass, Ji Chengzhi’s first words were packed with a cool sarcasm. 
Ou Mucen ignored him, after changing his clothes upon arriving at the ward, he lay down on the hospital bed, "Last night my wound cracked open a bit, some water got in, see if there’s any problem?" 
Upon hearing this, Ji Chengzhi laughed even more joyfully, "Hopeless, just wait for death." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Is he sick? 
After giving him a glance and deciding not to bother with him anymore, Ou Mucen took out his phone and made a call, "Hello, this is Ou Mucen." 
"Third Young Master, hello!" 
"Arrange someone sharp for tomorrow, to go with Assistant An to Longfeng. Call me if there’s any problem." noveldrama
"Yes, Third Young Master!" 
The person on the phone was brisk, and as soon as Ou Mucen issued the command, the other side promptly went to carry it out. 
Ji Chengzhi was engrossed in examining his wound, when he suddenly heard the words "Assistant An," his head shot up, "Good heavens, what are you planning to do? Sending that woman there too?" 
"Not okay?" 
"It’s not that it’s not okay, but that woman is an archenemy of your brother and nephew; by doing this, do you intend to turn Longfeng into her battlefield? Are you ready to take the risk of her playing it out?" 
"So what if I am? If she likes it, let her have fun. It’s not like I, Ou Mucen, am short on that bit of money!" 
"..." 
What the hell! 
What did he just hear? That bit of money?
###Chapter 443: Chapter 443: She was pressed there! 7
Fuck! That’s over ten billion, damn it, he actually told him for that woman that he didn’t need that bit of money!!! 
This beast!! 
Ji Chengzhi was about to curse... 
But the fact was, after the old Mr. Ou from Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry called a shareholders’ meeting and announced that the third young master of the Ou Family would hold 50% of the shares, within three days, Ou Mucen really had his special assistant parachuted into Longfeng. Once the news got out, it immediately alarmed all the executives at Dragon-Phoenix. 
"Did you all hear? The third young master really sent someone over, and I heard it was his previous special assistant." 
"Really? Who is that assistant? To be personally appointed by him to come here as his executive assistant." 
"Don’t know, but I heard it’s a woman!" 
"A woman?" 
When Ou Muyuan walked into the company with his son and Yang Xueshan, he heard people everywhere discussing the matter. Upon hearing this, his already somber face turned even more ashen, "Are you all not working anymore? If you don’t have work, get the hell out immediately!" 
With a shout, those people dispersed. 
After the crowd had left, the two men took the elevator straight up to the ninth floor to the Dragon-Phoenix President’s office. 
"Dad, what’s really going on? Why would they send someone over from there?" The moment he entered the office, Ou Yuze tossed his car keys onto the desk and sat down in the large boss chair. 
This seat was originally his too, but he had been stripped of his inheritance rights recently, and only then lost the right to sit there. 
Ou Muyuan stared at his son, but didn’t get angry because he had taken his seat again. Instead, after seeing him sit down, he glared at him fiercely, "Why do you think he would send someone over? Now that he owns half of Longfeng, is there a problem with him sending someone?" 
Upon hearing this, Ou Yuze’s face instantly turned very ugly, "So does it mean that from today onwards, Longfeng’s decision-making power has to be shared by two people?" 
Ou Muyuan snorted coldly, not even wanting to bother with his son. 
And it was understandable, if it weren’t for the mess he created in Japan, would they be facing today’s situation? 
Not only had he lost his inheritance rights, but he also had caused them to split their family foundation with someone else. What kind of situation was this? 
As the father and son were both stewing with grim faces in the office, Yang Xueshan spoke up, "Uncle, Yu Ze, actually, we don’t need to worry so much. All those at Dragon-Phoenix... Aren’t they our old followers?" 
Ou Yuze quickly looked up at her, "What do you mean?" 
Yang Xueshan smiled, "Since they are old followers, that means they are our people. As long as we ’unite and work together,’ Ou Mucen is just sending over a mere girl. Do you think she can really make a big impact?" 
As she spoke the words "unite and work together," the woman emphasized them deliberately. 
Upon hearing this, Ou Yuze and his father exchanged glances, finally catching the drift. 
Indeed, among the high-level executives at their Longfeng, most were the ones who had fought side by side with them. If they could take action and win those people over, it wouldn’t be hard to push that girl out. noveldrama
The two men finally started smiling again. 
As the three of them were discussing in the office, outside, the secretary Xiaoyang suddenly knocked and came in, "President Ou, there’s a call from the conference room. They said all the executives have arrived and are asking for you to join the meeting."
###Chapter 444: Chapter 444: She was pressed there! 8
That meeting room over there? 
Upon hearing this, Ou Yuze’s face twisted in anger instantaneously, "That meeting room? They’re informing me, the CEO, to attend a meeting?" 
Xiaoyang shrank back immediately, "Yes... yes..." 
"..." 
As the man was about to explode, Ou Muyuan quickly stood up to calm him down, "Alright, I got it. You go ahead and tell them we’ll be there shortly." 
"Yes, President Ou!" 
Xiaoyang, seeing the situation, dared not say more, promptly agreed, and withdrew immediately. 
Once Xiaoyang had left, Ou Muyuan then fiercely glared at his son, "What are you doing? Have you forgotten what we just talked about?" 
Ou Yuze was still brimming with resentment, "What is he even worth? He dares to inform me about joining a meeting? Is he not afraid I’ll kill him a second time?" 
"Enough, Ou Yuze!" 
As the subject was brought up, Ou Muyuan finally lost his patience and shouted, "Haven’t you caused enough trouble? Would things have come to this if you hadn’t killed him in the first place? And now you have the audacity to mention it?" 
"I..." 
"Alright, since he’s coming eventually, it’s inevitable. It’s just a meeting, and I was actually worried I wouldn’t get a chance to teach him a lesson. Yuze, you go!" 
Ou Yuze was taken aback, "I should go?" 
Ou Muyuan nodded, "Since it’s not him in person who’s coming, what does it matter who from our side attends? If you don’t want to go, let Xueshan handle it then, she’s a woman as well, maybe she’ll find it easier to deal with." 
Yang Xueshan’s eyes lit up upon hearing this, "Uncle is right, I’m willing to go." 
Having said that, she headed for the meeting room. 
But at that moment, Ou Yuze, who was sitting behind the office desk, suddenly sneered, "No, I’ll go. I’m going to show Ou Mucen today, on my home turf, exactly how I break his people down, bit by bit!" 
Having said that, he stood up from his chair. 
Yang Xueshan, seeing this, quickly followed him out. 
To break down, bit by bit? 
That was a good idea, and it had been quite a while since she had seen him employ such tactics... 
—— 
Five minutes later, in the central meeting room on the eleventh floor of Longfeng- 
This was an unprecedented full attendance meeting. Over the years, due to their long tenure at Longfeng, the higher-ups had become complacent, and often, not everyone would be present. 
But today, because of the sudden arrival of the Ou Family’s third young master’s personnel, for the first time, they had all shown up so promptly! 
As Ou Yuze and Yang Xueshan approached, before they even entered, their eyes caught sight through the glass window of the uniformly present heads inside, and both unconsciously paused in their steps outside. 
What is this? 
Why are people so punctual today? Could it be that they have caught wind of something and, too, have come to watch the show? 
A surge of anger burst from the depths of his heart; even before they entered, an air of fierce hostility radiated from him. 
Striding forward, he did not bother looking elsewhere and directly gripped the handle, pulling. The closed door finally swung open... 
"Assistant An, I am Cheng Qian, head of the sales department, very pleased to meet you." 
"Assistant An, I am Xu Yangzhou, manager of the human resources department, pleased to meet you." noveldrama
"Assistant An..." 
"..." 
Ou Yuze had thought that upon seeing the outsider, his battle-hardened colleagues would ignore her out of shared animosity. Yet, he never anticipated that upon his entrance, the scene he would be met with was quite the
###Chapter 445: Chapter 445: She was pressed there! 9
Assistant An? 
Watching this group of sycophants desperately vying for attention, the man, furious to the extreme, finally made his way to the center of the gathering and saw the person representing another man who had been parachuted into their Longfeng. 
It was indeed a woman, and what’s more, a very beautiful woman! 
Her beige suit with the fitted blazer accentuated her slender figure for all to see. Inside the blazer, a lovely red strapless sheath dress—simple yet sophisticated, elegant but sharp. Her ear-length bob haircut further showcased her professional, chic demeanor. 
Who was this woman? 
Ou Yuze was momentarily taken aback! 
Similarly, the woman seated in the chair was sizing him up as well. 
Five years, five years indeed could change a lot, but she hadn’t expected it to bring such a massive change in someone in her heart. Scrawny with a vicious face, she could hardly understand how she could have been so blind back then. 
While the two were looking at each other, Yang Xueshan, who had followed in, had arrived. Upon seeing the young woman surrounded by the crowd and seated in the chair, her eyes widened in shock, "It’s you?" 
Ye Ning turned her head with a smile upon seeing her, "Yes, Manager Yang, we meet again!" 
What perfect timing, a pair of despicable lovers all here! 
Ye Ning looked at them both, her face full of smiles, yet her eyes emitted a chill. 
Yang Xueshan did not notice; seeing that the person parachuted in was the same little assistant who had been slapped by Bai Wei before, her face suddenly turned very ugly, "How could it be you? Weren’t you already gone from Ou’s?" 
Ye Ning smiled faintly, "Who said? Here I am, still around." 
"But..." 
"Manager Yang, if I remember correctly, this high-level company meeting is only accessible to ministers and general managers. How come a department manager like you is here?" 
"You—" 
As soon as this was said, not only did Yang Xueshan’s face change on the spot, but the others in the meeting room also inhaled sharply, all of them looking nervously towards the man standing next to Yang Xueshan. 
Yang Xueshan, although not highly positioned in Longfeng, was well-known among the company for her special relationship with the CEO; in other words, she was essentially the CEO’s woman. 
Yet, this Assistant An had flat out questioned her presence here—wasn’t this a direct challenge to authority? 
The CEO of Longfeng had always been ruthless and venomous, and those who offended him typically didn’t end well. The best-case scenario would see them ousted from Longfeng, while the worst-case scenario involved endangering personal safety. 
So, how was he going to deal with this woman who had suddenly dropped in, irking him even more? 
Everyone dared not utter a sound, their eyes filled with fear and trepidation, turning towards the man whose face was starting to contort with anger! 
"She’s my person. If I want her to be somewhere, she’ll be there. What, you have a problem with that?" Amidst the deadly silence, the man who had been staring at her finally spoke, each word laced with unhidden malice and bloodlust. 
Indeed, there was no need for pretense, this was his turf, and he could do as he pleased. 
However, the woman sitting in the chair, even faced with such murderous intent, showed not the slightest hint of fear.noveldrama
###Chapter 446: Chapter 446: She was pressed there! 10
Instead, those clear, cold eyes, after sweeping over his ashen face, laughed... 
"No, I have no ions. You can take Sun Young Master’s person wherever you want, but she cannot come to this conference room." 
"Why not?" 
"Because Sun Young Master, you... no longer have the qualifications to be here!" 
She was like a poisonous poppy, smiling so beautifully, yet the words that came out of her mouth were like knives, stabbing repeatedly into the man’s heart in front of her—everyone saw the rapid contortion of his face. 
This woman was really cruel! 
No longer qualified to enter this conference room? 
Yes, he truly had no qualifications now. Since his inheritance rights had been revoked, he was no longer the executive CEO of Longfeng. Naturally, without being the person in charge here, he certainly had no right to enter anymore. 
Yet, who in the company dared to say such things? How could this new woman have the courage to say them? 
Everyone clenched their fists in anxiety, seeing Sun Young Master’s eyes turn redder and redder. They began to hesitate—should they make a call to the third young master of the Ou Family first? 
"What did you say? Say it again?" 
"Sun Young Master, I am only doing my official duties. Since I am here, I must handle this matter well for Third Young Master. If you really want to come in, I can discuss it with the company later to see if there is a suitable position for you. What do you think?" 
"Slut! I’ll kill you first!!" 
Finally erupting, the man charged forward and grabbed a water cup from the conference table, hurling it towards the figure still smiling cheerfully in the chair! 
Everyone was shocked and about to rush to the rescue when a tall man in a black suit who had been standing behind that chair suddenly moved like lightning, catching the incoming cup: "Sun Young Master, you’re quite bold!" 
That single sentence stunned everyone in the conference room, including Ou Yuze! 
"You... who are you...?" 
"Miss An, let’s stop here for today. Let us return and report to Third Young Master." The man in black did not give him a chance to speak, helped the still slightly shaken woman up from the chair, and immediately, the two left the conference room. noveldrama
Those left in the conference room, along with Ou Yuze, stood there dazed, taking a very long time to recover. 
Ying Hao, he actually came with this woman too!! 
How was this possible? Wasn’t Ying Hao a member of the Shadow Guard Squad at Blue Mountain Villa? How did he end up here? Wasn’t the Shadow Guard always under the old master’s command alone? Since when could Ou Mucen also give orders? 
Ou Yuze’s face gradually turned pale. 
Just at that moment, Ou Muyuan, hearing the commotion, also came in from outside. Seeing the chaos in the conference room and that the parachuted individual was already gone, he was furious, pointing at Ou Yuze’s nose and cursing, "You fool, you even dared to attack his people. Do you want us to lose the last 50% to him as well?" 
Ou Yuze: "..." 
Yang Xueshan saw this and quickly tried to explain on his behalf: "President Ou, it was that woman named An Ning who went too far." 
"Shut your mouth! If it wasn’t for you, this wouldn’t have happened at all. Get out of here immediately!" 
His words, far from calming him, only fueled his rage even more. After a loud shout, in front of so many people, he directly ordered her to get out of the conference room.
###Chapter 447: Chapter 447 Revenge Returns 1
Yang Xueshan’s entire face had turned ghastly pale, and she clenched her fists tight. Ultimately, in front of all those watchful eyes, she still left the meeting room in a dejected manner. The moment she stepped out, standing by the door, the blood-red fury in her eyes burst forth, revealing a venomous hatred. 
"An Ning, you bitch, I will make sure you enter standing and leave lying down!" 
—— 
When Ye Ning arrived at the hospital, in the VIP ward on the third floor, the man receiving an IV drip was sitting with his legs crossed in the wooden chair near the window, reviewing some financial reports sent from the company on his laptop. 
The sunlight was soft and the air fresh; they streamed in through the open window and settled on the man, caressing his contours and skin like a light gauze, casting him in an even more delicate and exquisite light. From a distance, he seemed as if he had stepped out of a painting. 
How could there be such attractive men in this world? 
Ye Ning stood at the door, utterly mesmerized. 
Just as she was lost in her trance, the man in the chair, catching a whiff of a faint lime fragrance that didn’t belong to the ward, suddenly turned his gaze and looked over, "You’re back?" 
Ye Ning was startled and quickly averted her gaze that had been fixed on him, "Yes, I’m back." 
While responding, she walked in from the doorway. 
Ou Mucen saw her and gestured toward the water dispenser, "Pour me a glass of water." 
"Oh... sure!" 
Ye Ning heard him, hurriedly put her bag down, and went over to pour him water. 
She actually feared meeting him; on the very first day, she had messed things up, failing to even properly start the meeting. Would he blow up in anger when he heard? After all, his temper wasn’t the easiest to handle. 
However, to her surprise, after she poured the water and placed it in front of him, he just took the cup to his lips for a sip, then returned his focus to the laptop. 
Feeling awkward and unsure what to say, she finally managed to muster, "How are you... How are you feeling today? Any better?" 
The man with the cup gave a slight nod, "Not bad, and you?" 
Her? 
Ye Ning, upon hearing he finally asked about her, broke into a cold sweat, "Today... I screwed up at work." noveldrama
"Screwed up?" 
"Yeah, I was supposed to start with a senior executive meeting, but then I ended up arguing with Ou Yuze!" 
Argued? 
Quite capable! 
The man, holding the water cup, took another sip and placed it back on the table, "Seems you have quite a temper. How did you end up arguing with him?" 
Ye Ning looked down at her toes, "He disregarded you. I was the person you sent, but he didn’t take me seriously at all. How could I not teach someone like that a lesson?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
This girl, spouting nonsense... 
Did she really argue with that man on his behalf? Why hadn’t he noticed before that she had this skill? 
Ou Mucen’s eyes twitched, and he finally closed his laptop, "So what do you plan to do now? Ou Family’s young master Yu Ze is not someone to be trifled with. If he dares to lay a hand on me, he won’t hesitate with you." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning immediately looked up at the man, "It’s okay, he won’t do anything to me."
###Chapter 448: Chapter 448 Revenge Returns 2
"Why?" 
"He’s hostile towards me because I am your person. After I go there, he fears we will take what belongs to them, which explains his hostility towards me. However, as long as I tell him we will not touch a single cent of their stuff, there will be no need for him to treat me this way." 
"..." 
For five seconds, Ou Mucen sat in the chair, squinting as he stared at this woman. 
Being an exceptionally intelligent man, he of course knew what she meant by her words. 
Generally, after a company goes public, shareholders with a considerable number of shares have the right to control certain operational departments of the company, and these departments, especially the financial and sales departments, are the most crucial in controlling the company’s lifeline. 
Once these two departments are in hand, the company is virtually in one’s own control. noveldrama
But now, the woman was saying she wouldn’t touch these two departments at all. So, did she really plan to use his company as a chessboard for her strategy? 
Ou Mucen stared at her for a good while until she could hardly bear it, and only then did he look away: "As long as you have a plan, that’s fine. In any case, my requirement is simple. Those 50% of shares, don’t even say they won’t bring in a single penny." 
Ye Ning suddenly turned her head away awkwardly... 
Not a single penny? Did she seem so unreasonable? 
While they were talking, a nurse suddenly came into the hospital room. Ye Ning looked up and realized that his IV drip had finished. 
So, she glanced at her wristwatch and prepared to pick up her child: "If there’s nothing else, I’ll be going. Xiaobao’s school is about to end, I’m going to pick him up." 
Ou Mucen nodded: "Hmm, I will have Ying Hao bring the shareholder’s rights and responsibilities agreement to you tomorrow morning." 
Ying Hao? 
Upon hearing this name, Ye Ning remembered the man in black who had saved her, and immediately, her departing steps halted: "By the way, who is this Ying Hao?" 
"What do you want with him?" 
"Nothing much, just wanted to thank him. He helped a lot today." 
Showing a bit of self-awareness? 
Ou Mucen snorted coldly: "He’s the company’s security guard, it’s his job to protect you." 
Security guard? 
With those skills, he’s just a security guard? 
Ye Ning found it hard to believe, but since he had said so, it wasn’t appropriate to ask any further. Thus, she turned and left the hospital room to pick up her child. 
In fact, no matter who that person was, as long as she could stabilize this man and continue to stay at Longfeng, that was the best outcome. When she thought about it, she really had been somewhat impulsive today. If it hadn’t been for seeing that couple she couldn’t stand, she would not have caused such a scene. 
Driving over, it was just a ten-minute journey. Ye Ning arrived at Ye Xiaobao’s kindergarten. 
However, what she didn’t expect was that when she drove up, she actually saw the person at the entrance of the kindergarten she had been worried about encountering these past few days. 
"Brother Lin..."
Seeing this person, she didn’t even bother to park the car properly. She found a random spot, got out, and walked over to him, her face tense as she looked at the child in his hands. 
That was fear! 
Fear that he would take her child away, and fear for what he might do to them if he took them back. 
Lin Yebai noticed all of this, his already dull eyes growing dimmer: "You’re here?" 
Ye Ning nodded: "Yes... I just got off work."
###Chapter 449: Chapter 449 Revenge Returns 3
Ye Ning’s expression was intensely rigid, with a strong sense of tension in her eyes, as if he was no longer the man she trusted and respected, but had become something akin to a dangerous element. 
Lin Yebai saw this and tugged at the corner of his mouth, a hint of self-mockery finally flashing across his eyes and brows! 
"I’ve come to return some of your identity documents to you and took the opportunity to pick up Xiaobao as well," he said, handing over the child he was leading by the hand, and at the same time, a kraft envelope. 
Ye Ning was momentarily stunned! 
Her identity documents? 
"Your ID card and passport are no longer valid in Japan, and you can’t be exposed right now, so there’s no way to get them reissued. All that’s left are your records from the orphanage and the adoption certificate from the Ou Family. I’m returning everything to you now; you need to keep them safe." 
He passed the envelope to her with a very calm expression. 
Ye Ning stared at him for a while before reaching out to take the envelope. 
That’s right, ever since he had covertly rescued her five years ago, all her documents, including her identification, had been in his keeping. He said she was an escapee; if someone discovered her true identity, it would be a death sentence for her. 
So, he had been safeguarding these items for her all along. 
But now, he was actually returning them to her? 
She looked at the kraft envelope in her hands, and the wariness that filled her eyes finally began to dissipate slowly, "Brother Lin, you actually didn’t have to return these to me." 
"No, since you’ve decided to leave, it’s only natural that I return these things to you. Just be careful. These documents are temporarily not to be exposed. If someone finds out, it could cause trouble." noveldrama
He spoke indifferently, his gaze not on her, but fixed on some point in the distance. 
Ye Ning, upon hearing this, finally put the kraft envelope away. 
He had surprised her today; she had thought that after she had refused him in front of so many people at the Qiao Family home and left with that man, he would turn hostile and intensify his efforts to capture her and confine her to his side once more. 
But unexpectedly, he had chosen to let her go and even personally delivered her belongings to her.
Ye Ning’s eyes softened, especially when recalling the incident at the Qiao Family home that night, a tinge of guilt arose in her heart, "Brother Lin, about that night, I..." 
"Does he treat you well?" 
"Huh?" 
"I mean, Ou Mucen, has he treated you well? Has he forgiven you for what happened in Japan?" He seemed to be talking to himself as he stood there and asked this question. 
Ye Ning’s face immediately flushed with embarrassment, "He... he stopped asking about those things later on." 
"Is that so? Then he must have forgiven you. He’s a smart man; he should already know you had nothing to do with that incident, just that he felt used and was uncomfortable about it." 
"..." 
For a long, long time, Ye Ning just stood there, not knowing how to respond to him. 
These words didn’t sound like the Lin Yebai she knew. Whenever the former Lin Yebai mentioned Ou Mucen, his tone and voice would become sharp, and his words would always subtly convey his displeasure towards him. 
But now, he spoke as if he was defending Ou Mucen, explaining to her the real reason a man might not forgive her. 
Why was he doing this?
###Chapter 450: Chapter 450 Revenge Returns 4
Could it be that he really had let go? His obsessions with her, his hatred for that man, had he released them all? 
Ye Ning clenched the brown paper envelope in her hand. "Brother Lin, thank you. Rest easy, no matter how long, you will always be family to me, Ye Ning, my brother." 
Family? Brother? 
The man who had been standing here gazing at the lingering sunset off in the distance heard these words and tugged at the corner of his mouth. Finally, he laughed, "Alright, family. I heard you’ve started working at Longfeng?" 
Ye Ning nodded. "Yes, Ou Mucen arranged it. He now holds 50% of the shares and needed someone there, so he sent me." 
"Have you ever thought about why he chose you to go?" 
"He said he needed someone he could trust..." Ye Ning looked down. 
When Ou Mucen sent her to Longfeng, that was indeed what he had said, and she, too, was willing to believe him. noveldrama
But upon hearing her say this, the man in front of her suddenly laughed. "Do you believe that? Knowing you are the adopted daughter of his brother’s family, would he really still place you there? If I’m not mistaken, you must be planning your final act of revenge there, right? If so, his Longfeng is going to suffer substantial losses." 
Ye Ning was at a loss for words! 
Indeed, from the moment she received this task, her mind was filled with thoughts of revenge, and Longfeng was indeed the battlefield for her grand plan of vengeance. 
Ye Ning clenched her fists, starting to lose her confidence... 
"I mean no offense, just a reminder, Longfeng’s assets are worth tens of billions; it’s not just a car, a piece of jewelry. Take care," he concluded, then turned and left. 
Yes, tens of billions. Even he would think twice, let alone that man? 
That man wouldn’t be so crazed as to let her play with tens of billions, would he? 
As Lin Yebai left, the corners of his mouth were full of mocking sneers... 
Ye Ning stood petrified, staring at his departing figure for a long time without moving. 
These past two days, she really hadn’t thought about this problem. Since the night she was taken away from the Qiao Family banquet by him, she had been immersed in the joy of his forgiveness, of his coming back for her. She didn’t want to consider anything else and was willing to believe every word he said. 
But just now, the man had told her that he wouldn’t just throw tens of billions in for her "game." 
Would he really not play along? 
Then, what was Ou Mucen’s true intention for sending her to Longfeng? 
Her fingers tightened one by one, and her chest suddenly felt as though it was being pressed by a heavy stone, making it hard for her to breathe... 
---- 
Ou Mucen went to bed late that night, still fiddling with his phone in his hospital bed past nine o’clock. 
Because Ji Chengzhi, after returning home, got nagged fiercely by his parents, he came out again and went to the hospital to see Mucen. 
Coming in from outside, he happened to see Mucen sitting on the bed with his phone, so he walked in. "Still not asleep at this hour? Waiting for someone special?" 
His tone was ambiguous, and his expression was filled with teasing. 
Ou Mucen looked at him expressionlessly. "What brings you here so late? Pressured into marriage again?" 
Ji Chengzhi immediately lost all interest. "Why must you be so disagreeable? Always bringing up the most unwelcome topics, can’t you talk about something else?"
###Chapter 451: Chapter 451 Revenge Returns 5
Snatching his phone, she found out he was playing a game. 
Ou Mucen didn’t show any irritation but, after he also logged on, someone took the phone back from his hands and he continued his game. 
"Not to criticize you, but you’re not that young anymore, spending your days indulging in pleasure; it’s about time to find a woman and settle down." 
"Tch!" 
Ji Chengzhi, who was busy getting on the computer, shot him a glance, "As if you’re young. Are you younger than me? You’re 28, I’m 29, we’re pretty much the same. Why don’t you get married, huh?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Ignoring him, he continued to play his game! 
He actually enjoyed playing games a lot and was quite skilled. If it weren’t for his busy schedule, these damned fools wouldn’t stand a chance against him. Now that he thought about it, he missed the times when they were students with nothing much to do. 
Upon entering the game, the four players from Langya Pavillion soon started a fierce and exhilarating fight in the ancient city of Demon Domain. 
Both Young Master Zhan and Master Xia expressed that it was a rare occasion for the Third Young Master to join them in a game, showing an unprecedented enthusiasm and flattery while fighting monsters. 
Young Master Zhan: "Yo, the Third Young Master seems to be in a good mood today, your attack power has reached 100%." 
Master Xia: "Third Young Master, did something good happen to you?" 
As Ji Chengzhi saw it on the screen, he glanced at the man sitting in front of him with the corners of his mouth slightly raised, slowly typing out, "Because his ’second spring’ has come..." 
Young Master Zhan: "!!!!" 
Master Xia: "Petrified/Petrified/Petrified" 
... 
Ji Chengzhi wanted to continue, but suddenly, he felt two icy stares across from him, and his fingers trembled, laughing without conviction, "Just kidding, just kidding, haha." noveldrama
Ou Mucen’s face was colder than ice: "I wouldn’t mind making a joke too." 
"What?" 
"Telling your mom that you’re back to playing Royal characters!" 
Damn!
Beast! 
Ji Chengzhi was immediately hit with a comeback that left him powerless to resist, threw his phone, and he didn’t want to play anymore, going to sit at the small table. 
Ou Mucen continued playing until he finished the round and eventually came down from the online world and the hospital bed to pour himself a drink. 
"I heard your woman got bullied at your brother’s place today?" 
"Who told you?" 
"Never mind that. I also heard it was your woman who provoked your nephew, leading to the conflict. If that’s the case, then your woman has quite the guts," Ji Chengzhi took a sip of the coffee in front of him. 
Ou Mucen poured himself some water; maybe it was because he had played the game for too long, his neck felt a bit sore, so he sat down at the small table as well. 
"When has she ever been timid?" 
"That’s true. If she dares to provoke you and use you, what is an Ou Yuze to her?" Ji Chengzhi started laughing too. 
That woman was indeed a unique one. Not to mention himself, when Ji Chengzhi had just given her a few warnings, she had directly intimidated him. Looking back on it now, he found it amusing. 
"What’s going to happen next? Your nephew is not someone easy to deal with. He dared to lay hands on you, and now that she’s made him lose face in front of so many people, I doubt he’ll let her off." 
"That will depend on whether he is capable!" He paused, as if something had come to mind, and added, "She’s not as foolish as you think."
###Chapter 452: Chapter 452 Revenge Returns 6
Ji Chengzhi stalled for a moment, "What do you mean by that...?" 
The man sitting across tapped the table a few times, "The opening act isn’t bad, just a bit undercooked. A mere provocation is too kind, isn’t it time to turn up the heat?" 
Ji Chengzhi: "..." 
Is he a beast? Is he an animal? How can he indulge a woman like this in front of him? 
Ji Chengzhi felt as if he had suffered ten thousand tons of damage: "Ou, are you not afraid that one day I’ll add something to your injection and kill you if you keep flaunting your love in front of me?" 
Ou Mucen glanced over at him, his expression like that of someone watching an idiot, "You should see a psychologist, your mentality is extremely abnormal right now." 
Ji Chengzhi almost coughed up blood... 
What if he really killed him right now? 
However, on second thought, since that woman might very well be the mother of his child, his anger seemed to diminish. So, he blurted out, "Fine, just indulge her. After all, she’s raised such a big child for you, it’s been hard." 
"What?" 
"Isn’t it the case? If you marry her in the future, Xiaobao will be your son. To suddenly gain such a big son out of nowhere, isn’t that a huge bargain?" 
"..." 
With just that look, Ou Mucen retracted his gaze. 
Such words, if spoken to any other man, would surely cause some discomfort upon hearing them. 
A woman who has been married and comes with a child, marrying her would always have some imperfections, since the child isn’t his own, and the woman wasn’t exclusively his from the start. 
But at this moment, for some reason, Ou Mucen felt not the slightest discomfort after hearing these words; on the contrary, upon hearing that the child could become his son, calling him ’Dad’, something inside him felt completely filled, and an overwhelming sense of joy brought a slight smile to his lips. 
Ji Chengzhi, sitting opposite him, was shocked to see such an expression! 
This guy must be out of his mind. He’s talking about picking up a son out of the blue, not that the child is actually his. Why does he look as though the child really is his? 
Ji Chengzhi felt as though he had seen a ghost! 
Could it be... this is the legendary bond of blood being thicker than water? 
— 
Ye Ning went to bed early the night before because Xiaobao wasn’t feeling well and she had gone to sleep with him early. 
She woke up early in the morning since she had gone to bed early, awakening as dawn was breaking. So, she got up from the bed, started to cook breakfast for Xiaobao, and, out of habit, picked up her phone to scroll through Weibo. But just as she picked up the phone, a call came in. 
"Hello?" 
"You’re up?" 
As the call connected, a clear and deep voice came through. The familiar tone, the trademark brevity, almost made Ye Ning drop her spatula on the floor. noveldrama
"I’m up, you... why so early?" 
"Doing a checkup, have you left the house?" 
"Not yet, still cooking breakfast. Xiaobao wasn’t feeling well last night, so I didn’t want to take him out for breakfast this morning." 
Not feeling well? 
The voice in the phone immediately rose slightly upon hearing these words, "Is he okay?" 
"He’s fine, he’s fine, just a little stomach upset. He’s much better after taking some medicine," Ye Ning quickly assured, soothing any worries. Meanwhile, the anxiety that had kept her tossing and turning all of last night began to dissipate unconsciously.
###Chapter 453: Chapter 453 Revenge Returns 7
Last night, she barely slept at all, her mind in disarray due to Lin Yebai’s words. 
She didn’t want to admit what he had said, but after going over it again and again, she found that everything he mentioned was true. If he really had found out who she was, he should know she and his brother’s family were enemies. Knowing this, why would he send her to Longfeng? 
By sending her to Longfeng, it was as if he wanted to drag the grudge she had held for all those years down with him! 
Did he really not care about the money? that was tens of billions we’re talking about! 
Lying awake, she stared at the ceiling overhead through the dark night for what seemed like an eternity, her mind never settling, as she dwelled on this question until her heart ached and her head throbbed. 
But early this morning, she received a call from him; he was still concerned about her son... noveldrama
Ye Ning decided not to think about anything for now and to focus on her own affairs first. 
"When you send him to kindergarten, talk to the teacher and ask them to pay a little more attention," he said. 
"Yeah, okay!" 
"I’ve had Ying Hao carry over the deed of authority; you can take it directly to Ou Muyuan. As for the operation department, I suggest you take control of the design department," he proposed. 
"Why?" 
Why? 
Of course, to stir up trouble, right? With Bai Wei currently in the design department, any small movement would be a perfect fuse. 
The man holding his phone, gazing at the gold of dawn outside the window, his handsome face revealed a brooding mood, "Aren’t you looking for a laid-back department? In the jewelry business, the design department is the most relaxed. They release a new product once per quarter and then are free for the rest. You can do some good fishing there." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
That makes sense, but why does it sound like she’s just loafing around at the company? She works very diligently, thank you very much! 
Ye Ning ended the call in a sullen mood! 
On the other end, after he hung up, the man followed the nurse and doctor behind him for his final check-up. A chilly voice taunted him from behind, "Tsk, tsk, tsk, I’ve never seen someone so happy while scheming against their own assets. President Ou, are you sure your brain isn’t malfunctioning? Maybe you should get a CT scan as well?" 
The man by the window immediately turned around with his arms crossed, "Should we get you checked too? After so many years of living it up and yet still not providing the Ji Family with a grandchild, what seems to be the problem?" 
"Ou Mucen!!" 
"..." 
It’s a curse, why can’t the two major shareholders of this hospital just get along? 
---- 
It was an hour later when Ye Ning arrived at Longfeng.
True to his word, Ying Hao was waiting there. Upon seeing her, he handed over a document, "This is what Third Young Master asked me to give you. He said to fill in the blank spaces yourself." 
Ye Ning took it and opened it to see that it indeed was a blank shareholder agreement, and scrawled at the bottom in a flourish was "Ou Mucen’s" signature, already in place. 
Seeing this, she stowed it away, ready to go up and find father and son Ou Muyuan when suddenly someone called out from behind, "Assistant An, good morning!" 
A woman? 
Ye Ning turned and saw the beautiful woman approaching from behind. 
Yang Xueshan, to think they would run into each other, what a coincidence! 
She paused her steps, a shallow smile spreading across her face as she looked at her, "Good morning, Manager Yang. What brings you here? Did you just arrive?"
###Chapter 454: Chapter 454 Revenge Returns 8
Yang Xueshan sauntered over, exuding charm, with thick chestnut curls identical to those she had flaunted at the court five years ago. Seductive with a facade of elegance that didn’t quite belong to her. 
"Hmm, I usually come around this time. However, I already made a trip to the factory just now." 
"Factory?" 
Yang Xueshan nodded, "Yes, the production department. Assistant An might not be aware, but at Longfeng, I manage not only the Human Resources Department but sometimes I also need to check on the production side of things." 
"Is that so? Is the production department such a crucial part that Manager Yang has to visit in person?" 
"Of course. The production department is the cornerstone of Longfeng’s manufacturing base, the origin of all product manufacturing. Assistant An, would you say that’s important?" As she spoke, the woman purposefully glanced at Ye Ning. 
Ye Ning observed her expressions intently, not pointing them out, but her eyes, nevertheless, shifted to the factory that the other woman had mentioned. 
It was said that this woman, Yang Xueshan, before Ye Ning arrived, had been meddling in many departments within the company thanks to her relationship with Ou Yuze, especially the production department, which was like her fortress. And now, she deliberately brought up the production department in front of her...
Ye Ning looked at the woman who had betrayed her five years ago, the same woman who had personally sent her to jail, and suddenly, she began to smile, "Indeed, it’s important. So, if that’s the case, during the return to discuss the power and responsibility agreement, I’d really like to take charge of this department." 
As she finished speaking, the woman immediately displayed a shockingly appalled expression: "What? You want this one? That won’t do. If you take it, what will we do?" 
"Manager Yang, we’re all one family, why quibble over such things? Alright, just go and talk to young master Sun later. Tell him I’ll take this department, okay?" 
"But..." 
"All’s good, don’t worry. In the future, when we reap the benefits, you won’t be left out." 
Ye Ning patted her shoulder, her smile so convincing, she could have easily won the Oscar for Best Actress. 
Eventually, Yang Xueshan left with an air of reluctance, but Ye Ning knew inside she must be elated to the point of fainting. Ye Ning had, after all, fallen right into her trap. 
Hehe, you treacherous wench! 
Ye Ning, accompanied by Ying Hao, also reached the 11th-floor conference room. Ou Muyuan was indeed already waiting for her. She handed over the already filled out power and responsibility document to him, "President Ou, I’ve made up my mind. I’ll take the production department and the design department." 
Ou Muyuan’s eyes lit up at once, "Are you sure you want these two departments? You don’t need to ask the third young master?" 
Ye Ning smiled radiantly, "No need. He left me in full charge. Let’s settle on these two!" 
Seeing this, Ou Muyuan exchanged a look with his son and finally heaved a sigh of relief. Immediately, he not only personally took her to inspect these departments, but as the President of Longfeng, he grandly announced her arrival at the company. 
Ye Ning was very pleased with this arrangement. After the introductions, she returned to her office. 
"Assistant An, why did you take the production department? Weren’t we supposed to take the finance and sales departments?" Back in the office, an oblivious Ying Hao asked. 
Ye Ning had no intention of telling him, so she casually brushed it off, "It’s the arrangement of the third young master. By the way, has the production department received any orders recently?" noveldrama
Ying Hao flipped through some papers, "There is one, a deal worth 3 billion, with deliverables due in the next couple of days."
###Chapter 455: Chapter 455 Revenge Returns 9
$300 million? 
Such a huge order?! 
Ye Ning was surprised when she heard it, "Has the company always had orders this big?" 
Ying Hao shook his head, "Not really, I just looked, and they’re mostly small orders. It’s just today that we received a huge order saying it’s for a new product launch and that production needs to start." 
A new product launch? 
Ye Ning flipped through the orders he had handed over, realizing that the orders from the past month were indeed not very substantial. The largest one was only five million, but now, suddenly there came an order worth $300 million. 
Ye Ning suddenly recalled the woman who had deliberately seduced her at the door that morning, and, holding the order, she fell into deep thought... 
She had guessed that the woman had lured her here with a conspiracy, but she hadn’t expected it to be such a big order the moment she arrived. 
It seemed that the wretched woman was playing a big game! 
That wretched woman! 
She wanted to play, did she? Fine, then Ye Ning would play along with her. She had been worrying about when the right opportunity would come, and now here it was, delivered to her doorstep. 
However, the quantity of this order... 
She thought of Lin Yebai’s words from yesterday afternoon that had been nagging at her heart like a thorn, and suddenly her fingers clenched the order turned white, a decisive look flashing in her eyes.
Since that was the case, why not take a gamble? 
Gamble on whether he would care or not, and how much she really meant to him in his heart. 
She placed the order in front of her, waved her hand, and signed her name to it, "Alright, produce it according to the order quantity." 
"Yes!" 
Ying Hao, unaware of the truth, immediately took the signed order and went down quickly. 
The calm surface of the lake was finally about to be disturbed... 
— 
Ou Mucen didn’t find out about this until the evening. Upon learning of it, he sat there in silence for a while. 
"You’re saying $300 million?" 
"Correct," Ying Hao nodded. 
Hearing this, the man sitting in the chair began tapping the pen in his hand against the tabletop, intermittently... 
$300 million, the stakes of this game were big. If things really got serious, the investment could balloon to $1.3 billion or more, at which point the entire Longfeng might get involved. 
He sat there thinking for a good while but eventually still issued his orders calmly, "Understood, you don’t need to worry about these things. Just ensure her personal safety." 
"Understood, Young Master," Ying Hao replied upon receiving the order and left. 
It had only been about ten minutes since he left when someone else came to the sickroom. Ou Mucen turned his head and saw it was his mother, who had brought something to see him. noveldrama
"Mom, didn’t I tell you there’s no need to bring food to the hospital? I’ll be discharged soon." 
Ou Mucen instinctively furrowed his brows when he saw who it was. 
Bai Tingfang, undeterred, came over with the stewed soup and meals she had brought, "Aren’t you still in the hospital? What’s wrong with your mom coming to check on you? By the way, when exactly are you being discharged? I had someone tidy up your villa." 
The villa? 
Was she referring to the garden in the Blue Mountain Villa? 
Ou Mucen immediately refused without even thinking, "Mom, I don’t plan to go back there. I’m returning to my apartment." 
"Why? You’re just getting out of the hospital and no one will take care of you. Moreover, your apartment is cold all year round; how would that help with your recovery?" 
As soon as Bai Tingfang heard her son didn’t plan to return home after being discharged but rather to his apartment, she immediately became anxious.
###Chapter 456: Chapter 456 Revenge Returns 10
Ou Mucen didn’t want to explain to her, so he lowered his head and busied himself with his work, staying silent. 
Bai Tingfang saw this and knew the temperament of her son; once he was set on something, no one could pull him back. In an instant, she plopped down in front of him, "I know you think mom nags too much, that’s why you don’t want to come home." noveldrama
"Mom, what are you talking about? When have I ever thought you were naggy?" 
"Then why won’t you come home?" 
"Because..." 
Ou Mucen suddenly stopped there... 
Because of what? 
Of course, it was because of that place, that woman would never go there. She was a foster daughter who had walked out from there; that place, Mei Liping’s family, had brought her too much pain and hatred. How could she ever want to return? 
Ou Mucen lifted his eyelids slightly and after a long while, he said, "No reason, I just don’t want to see that family. Mom, don’t forget how your son was injured. Surely you wouldn’t expect your son to face a once attempted murderer every day while he is recovering, right?"
Bai Tingfang heard this and then gave up on the decision to make him recover at the garden. 
After a long time, she finally agreed with his decision not to go to the garden. 
"Then after you return to the apartment, mom will personally take care of you." 
"No need!" 
"Why not? You’ve just been discharged from the hospital; someone needs to take care of you, don’t they?" 
"Haven’t you already hired a cleaning lady for me? She can cook. She can take care of things when the time comes, and besides, after I am discharged, I won’t have time to stay at home. I have to go to work; the company is so busy." 
"But..." 
"Alright, mom, if you really want to do something for me, then take care of yourself, so I don’t have to worry about you." 
Finally, he said something a son should say, just to shut her up so she wouldn’t worry about his issues. 
Indeed, hearing this rare, affectionate speech from her son, Bai Tingfang finally stopped talking about it. She opened the soup she had brought and pushed it towards him, "I’ve heard all about Longfeng’s situation. You’ve already sent someone over to their side, but, I heard you sent the same assistant again?" 
Upon this remark, the man across from her, who had shown little reaction to the conversation up until now, suddenly lifted his gaze and his expression turned cold. 
"What are you trying to do? I warn you, don’t touch her!" 
"Why are you speaking so aggressively? I’m your mother, can’t I show a little concern for you?" 
Ou Mucen’s expression remained icy, "Pay attention to what needs attention. Things that shouldn’t be your concern had better be left alone. I’m telling you, if I find out you’ve touched her again, mom, don’t blame me for turning heartless and ruthless." 
Bai Tingfang was startled by her son’s tone and countenance; sitting there, she stared at him, her face turning pale with shock. After a long time, she abruptly stood up and turned to leave. 
This was the first time he had spoken to her with such a tone and attitude. He was her son, yet for the sake of another woman, he spoke to her this way. Wasn’t it strange? 
Stepping out of the hospital room, her face immediately turned steely, "You must find out immediately who that woman is. The La Family’s young lady said she even went to Japan and was with the young master. Check this matter out." 
No sooner had her words fallen than a shadow approached from the side, "Yes, madam!" 
"And someone named Lin Yebai. Check him too!" 
"Lin Yebai?" 
"Yes, La Chenxi said she and this man have an unusual relationship. Investigate carefully; perhaps you can find out her identity. Be careful not to alert the young master!"
###Chapter 457: Chapter 458: The Show Begins 2
Every sentence, every word, sounded so terrifying and so shocking. 
Perhaps even Ou Mucen himself would never have imagined that the person to ruin his plans in the end would be this woman. Although he no longer loved her, and even though he didn’t want to see her again, he had never thought that she would one day become like this. 
Lacking even the most basic human morality, how could a person change so much? 
The figure quickly went off to take care of things, and Bai Tingfang, after making sure that the person inside the sickroom hadn’t heard what she’d said, also put on a grave expression and left.... 
---- 
Ye Ning hadn’t gone to the hospital these past two days. She was keeping an eye on the Longfeng matter; she knew a great battle was about to begin soon! noveldrama
Indeed, on the third day after she entered Longfeng, the 300 million order finally arrived. More than a dozen large trucks, under the watchful eyes of many, drove into the gates of Longfeng. 
"Assistant An, the goods have arrived." 
"Good, have they been inspected?"
"The Huo Family’s goods are all exempt from inspection." 
"Is that so?" 
She smiled as she looked at the production manager, casually took a piece of raw material from the truck to examine under her scrutiny, and then, like ripples on the surface of a lake, her smile unfurled, "Since that’s the case, unload them." 
"Yes, Assistant An!" 
"..." 
Exempt from inspection, how convenient—no wonder an order worth 300 million was placed at once; there’s a green channel after all. 
Once the notice was given to unload the goods, everyone in the factory rushed to the task; the scene was explosive. 
Yang Xueshan, who was also watching the surveillance from her office, immediately felt overjoyed upon seeing this and went to the eleventh floor to find that man, "Yu Ze, it’s a success; that woman discovered nothing and let them unload directly." 
"Really?" 
"Yes, really, I saw it with my own eyes." 
"Good!" 
Upon hearing this, the man behind the desk, Ou Yuze, finally sneered sinisterly, "With a 300 million order, I really want to see how this bitch is going to die this time." 
Yang Xueshan laughed as well, "Don’t worry, this time, I won’t just make her suffer; I’ll drag Ou Mucen down with her!" 
The man still smoking suddenly had his eyes light up, "How do you mean?" 
Yang Xueshan smiled sinisterly, "A 300 million order is no small amount. If we wait until it’s cut into semi-finished products and starts the engraving process, we could stage a scene for someone to ’accidentally’ discover the goods are fake. As the person in charge of production, she will be inextricably linked to the scandal, and at that time, I just need to approach her and tell her that if she wants to live, she must pin everything on Ou Mucen. By then, Ou Mucen won’t be able to escape the blame, and perhaps in his anger, the old man might give Longfeng back to you." 
By the end of her speech, the woman had even burst into triumphant laughter... 
Indeed, this was a perfect plan—first using the 300 million order to drive that woman into a corner, and then when she thinks she’s about to die, to throw her a lifeline by telling her that as long as she hands over her master, she could survive. Once she betrayed her master, the trap would be sprung; it would be truly delightful at that moment! 
An Ning, you bitch, I always said I wouldn’t let you off. 
Ou Yuze also understood her intentions, and finally, he showed her an expression of satisfaction, "Good, if this succeeds, I promise you, next month I’ll take you to Switzerland and buy you that ring."
###Chapter 458: Chapter 458: The Show Begins 2
"Really?" noveldrama
Upon hearing this, Yang Xueshan’s eyes immediately brightened, and even her fingers began to tremble slightly with extreme joy. 
The ring from Switzerland, she had it custom-ordered long ago. It was from an international luxury brand that specialized in making wedding rings for newlyweds. Yet, for so many years, this man had always been unwilling to go with her to pay the full amount and buy it back. Therefore, it could only lie there alone. 
And she, Yang Xueshan, had been with him for over five years, and still was just a lover he kept in the shadows. 
Now, he had finally said it, if she succeeded, he would take her to Switzerland to buy that ring back. 
To buy the ring back... 
She laughed through tears, hastily assented happily, and then ran out quickly. 
No matter what, she would succeed today. Even if it cost her life, she would make sure it ended perfectly. 
She hurried to the office, then stared at the surveillance again, but to her surprise, in just an hour since she had left the monitor, that batch of goods had already been unloaded and started moving into the workshop. 
How could it be so fast? 
She felt a pang of shock, looking at the heaps of Original Jade Stone in the workshop and thinking about the factory’s usual pace of work; she couldn’t help but feel a moment of anxiety. 
But even with the nerves, she did not care much, because she knew from the entry of Original Jade Stone into the factory, to peeling, cutting into semi-finished stones, and then to carving, these steps would take at least until late afternoon to complete. There was plenty of time. 
So after watching for a while, she stopped monitoring it and went on with her work as usual, keeping busy with other matters. At noon, she was even happy enough to have a good lunch out with that man before coming back for a nap. 
Waking up from the nap, it was almost four o’clock. Seeing that the time was about right, she got up and went over to the surveillance area. 
However, she had not expected that when she got to the video feed, the Original Jade Stone that should have been at the carving process at this time was nowhere to be seen in the sculpting workshop. The whole video was quiet, the workshop silent and empty of any movement. 
What’s going on? Where is that batch of goods? 
She felt an inexplicable chill and immediately called the workshop. "Hello, this is Manager Yang. Where are the goods that came in this morning? They’re missing?" 
"No, they’ve been carved already and moved to the polishing workshop," someone answered. 
What?!! 
Already carved? 
Upon hearing these words, she almost dropped her phone from her hand. 
How is this possible? 
Three hundred million worth of material, how could it have moved to the polishing workshop so quickly? Even if the company’s machinery was state-of-the-art, it couldn’t be this fast. 
She could no longer sit still. Hanging up the phone, she dashed out in a rush... 
This plan, that batch of material absolutely could not go through the carving process and subsequent steps—otherwise, the cost and waste would go up. But most importantly, once the material entered the carving process, the next steps would involve blending it with previously produced semi-finished products. If new and old materials were mixed, it would really be a disaster. 
She just wanted to take down that woman and the people behind her; there was absolutely no need to drag the company into this. 
Dashing all the way to the polishing workshop, she intended to immediately stop the workers, but just as she came down the stairs, she saw a young woman in a black suit jacket and off-white pencil skirt, wearing a safety helmet, standing there, accompanied by the workshop director.
###Chapter 459: Chapter 459: The Show Begins 3
"The company needs this batch of goods urgently, aiming to hit the market by Mid-Autumn Festival, so you all need to hurry up now." 
"Don’t worry, Assistant An, following your method, our efficiency has greatly improved, and we will soon be able to move into the finished goods warehouse." 
"..." 
Finished goods warehouse?!?!! 
Standing on the stairs, Yang Xueshan heard this term, and suddenly, her vision turned black, nearly causing her to tumble down the stairs. 
If the goods entered the finished goods warehouse, it would mean mingling the entire existing inventory of Longfeng together. Once the company’s products hit the market, it wouldn’t just be an issue of the goods themselves, but if counterfeit materials were revealed, the company’s reputation would be damaged, resulting in enormous losses! 
Yang Xueshan completely panicked, dashing down the stairs at a sprint. She approached the woman with a forced smile: "Assistant An, why are you here in person? Why bother yourself with such matters?" 
Ye Ning looked at the woman who had suddenly appeared, taken aback: "Manager Yang, why are you here?" 
Yang Xueshan was trembling with panic, but she still had to feign calmness on her face: "I... I was just passing by and saw you here, so I came to check." 
Just passing by? noveldrama
Ye Ning looked up at the entrance to the workshop, which didn’t seem to be a place one could simply pass by and see, and her gaze sharpened: "Really? Did you come to check if I’m familiar with the work?" 
"Yes... yes..." 
"Well, thank you so much for your concern. It’s fine, I’ve managed Yuzhirun before while at O’s, so this job is quite easy for me. Look, I’ve saved the company a lot of time today." 
"Is that so?" 
"Yes, the polishing should be finished before the end of the day and then moved into the finished goods warehouse. When work starts tomorrow, they can be packaged and shipped out." 
The girl wearing a safety helmet, whether in attire or makeup was not as exquisite and charming as those office workers who spent their days in the office, but the radiant smile on her face at that moment made Yang Xueshan wish she could strangle her on the spot! 
Enter the finished goods warehouse before the end of the day? 
Why doesn’t she just go die?!! 
Finally, her fingers clenched one by one, as she stared at the woman and asked, word by word: "According to the process, this batch of goods shouldn’t have been carved at this hour. How did you manage to do it? Why is it so much faster?" 
Ye Ning smiled: "You’ve made things too complicated. Actually, for jade to take shape, it doesn’t need so many steps. Just peel off the skin, and for a good piece of jade, just pick the best ’water head’ material and go straight to the machine. Why bother cutting each piece before selecting?" 
"You—" 
Yang Xueshan suddenly felt a bone-chilling fear because this method had never been used at Longfeng. 
She stared intensely at the woman, her lips turning an exceptionally grave shade of pale: "Who exactly are you? How do you understand jade so well?" 
Ye Ning laughed again: "Manager Yang, you really have a short memory. Am I not the assistant specially in charge of Yuzhirun by young master San’s side? If I didn’t have some skills, how could I have landed this role?" 
With one statement, she had completely blocked the woman’s probing! 
Indeed, want to check her background? 
Rest assured, she has a hundred excuses to block you, and until the right time comes, she would absolutely not let you discover her true identity.
###Chapter 460: Chapter 460: The Show Begins 4
Yang Xueshan was livid with desperation. In the end, she could only quickly leave the batch of jade stones which were nearly finished polishing and started to look for her master. 
Meanwhile, in the office on the eleventh floor, Ou Yuze was still waiting for Yang Xueshan’s good news. 
Four o’clock was the time that woman had told him to expect a spectacle, and by now, it should be about to begin, right? 
Just as he lit a cigarette, the office door was violently pushed open from the outside... noveldrama
"Yu Ze..." 
"Is it done? Has it started?" 
"No... not that, Yu Ze, that woman, whatever method she used, she sped up the entire process by two hours. Now, the products have entered the polishing stage and are about to move to the finished goods warehouse." 
Yang Xueshan, seeing the man looking at her with anticipation, suddenly felt a wave of fear. Before she could open her mouth, her voice was already trembling. 
As expected, once the words fell, the man who rose from his chair. The smile on his face gradually faded, and instantly, a dark and cold threat emerged from his eyes, "What did you say? Say it again?" 
"It’s not... that’s not it, Yu Ze. Listen to me, I didn’t know she would do that. I... I... Yu Ze, we need to intercept that batch of goods now, or once it’s in the finished goods warehouse, mixed with the previous inventory, it’ll be too late once the goods are shipped out. The trouble will be huge." 
"You’re telling me now that the trouble is huge? What did you tell me before? You said this was foolproof, and everything was arranged. But now, you come running to me saying there’s a big problem?" 
As the words fell, the water glass on the table was grabbed and ruthlessly hurled at her.
Upon seeing this, Yang Xueshan screamed in terror and ducked to the side, covering her head! 
"Smash—" 
That was precisely the terrifying sound that could make one too unstable to even stand. 
Yang Xueshan felt the pain of the glass shards splashing onto her legs; she hugged her head, and tears suddenly began to fall, "Yu Ze, this... this really was an accident, I didn’t mean it... " 
"When was it ever not an accident with you? That little star you hired for Yuzhirun’s opening, you said it was an accident. Later, the counterfeit goods at Yuzhirun, that too was an accident. Even that time in Japan when I failed, you claimed an accident. You heartless wench, what haven’t you called an accident?" 
With a roar, the man reached into his drawer and pulled out a gun, aiming it at her. 
The moment Yang Xueshan saw it, she froze completely, "Yu Ze, you..." 
"I could kill you now and call it an accident. Then, your ’accident’ could be conveniently discarded in the dumpster downstairs, and this problem would be done with," he articulated coldly, like the most ruthless and merciless viper in the world, his eyes filled with icy venom. 
Yang Xueshan was petrified... 
She knew he was a man without sentiment, cold and cruel, but she had never imagined that one day he would point a gun at her head and tell her that he would treat her death as an accident to solve this problem. 
So, in his heart, was she just a rag, not even worth being called a human? 
The hands that were covering Yang Xueshan’s head slowly started to lower; her eyes full of tears, hollow and intense as she gazed at him, "So in your eyes, I am just a scapegoat that can be used at any time."
###Chapter 461: Chapter 461: The Show Begins 5
"What do you think this is? Treasure? Or a fiancée? Let me tell you, Yang Xueshan, stop dreaming. I, Ou Yuze, even if I were to marry a random woman, would not look at someone like you who came out of an orphanage!" 
"But you clearly said you loved me before, Yu Ze, how can you say such things? After all these years, do you know how many unconscionable things I’ve done to help you? I’ve even betrayed my own sisters, how can you treat me like this?" 
Finally, she screamed hysterically, completely ignoring the gun pointed at her head. 
Yes, because of this man, Yang Xueshan had done all kinds of evil deeds and lost all sense of morality over the years. Even for him, she had betrayed her only sister in the orphanage, sending her to prison. How could he do this to her? 
However, the man holding the gun to her, upon hearing her words, began to sneer, "Did I ask you to do those things? You did it to indulge in luxury, to be with me, to marry into the Ou Family. That’s why you did it." 
"..." 
At the drop of that sentence, the already somewhat crumbling woman twitched violently as if stepping on sore spots, her face becoming even paler. 
Seeing this, Ou Yuze’s face filled with mockery, "Did I hit a nerve? Still think you’re the innocent one? Yang Xueshan, in fact, the most disgusting people in the world are ones like you, playing the victim when you’re far from innocent. Do you really think I kept you because I have feelings for you? Let me tell you, if you weren’t somewhat useful, you’d have been sent to where you belong long ago!" 
The last sentence was truly the final straw! noveldrama
"You’d have been sent to where you belong long ago" 
That sentence must be referring to the place where she sent her best friend five years ago, because she was too outstanding, too strong. The Ou Family feared that one day she would fall into the hands of someone more powerful than they could control, which could become the greatest threat to Longfeng, so they sent her to where she belonged. 
And now, he was saying that if it weren’t for her still being useful, she would have already been sent to where she belonged. 
Yang Xueshan stared at the man, her face ghastly as if possessed, and finally asked, "So, are you going to kill me now?" 
Ou Yuze still held the gun, "You brought this upon yourself!" 
Yang Xueshan stared into the dark muzzle, her emotions in her eyes slowly calming down, until at last, they turned completely to ash... 
"You can kill me, but do you think you can escape the consequences?" 
"What did you say?" 
"Just as you said, I am someone who would do anything to achieve my goals, and if I’m willing to go to any length, why wouldn’t I have a contingency plan for when I did those things? I can assure you, Ou Yuze, that if I die, the details of the multi-million-dollar fraud case from years back will be revealed immediately, and you, the real culprit, will be exposed. If we’re going to die, let’s go down together, shall we?" 
"What did you say? You bitch!!" 
At those words, the man behind the desk with the gun finally erupted in anger. In a flash, he came out and rushed to the woman, pressing the gun viciously against her forehead, "Say it again?" 
Yang Xueshan laughed wildly, "I could say it a hundred times, and it would be the same. Even if I’m to die, I’ll drag you down with me!"
###Chapter 462: Chapter 462: The Show Begins 6
"Slap—" 
No sooner had she finished speaking than a dark shadow suddenly came crashing down in front of her, and in an instant, after a scream, she collapsed to the ground, clutching her forehead. 
It was that gun. The man had used the butt of that gun to smash her face viciously! 
Yang Xueshan felt so much pain that everything went dark before her eyes. When she touched her face, she felt warm liquid already bubbling out. She paused for a moment, and then, like a person having a nervous breakdown, she laughed hysterically, "What’s the matter? Don’t have the guts to kill me? Only dare to hit? Go on, kill me!" noveldrama
Thud!! 
Another vicious kick followed; this time, the man kicked her even harder, sending her crashing into the corner of the wall. 
Yang Xueshan finally stopped talking. She curled up tightly like a shrimp, and blood slowly trickled from her mouth, making her look like a discarded dog. 
The man holding the gun, after spitting viciously on the ground, raised his hand, ready to end her life with a shot. 
This was his territory, where he could take a life without anyone stopping him. 
However, just as he was about to pull the trigger, the woman opened her eyes again. Those eyes, lifeless as if belonging to a corpse, coldly stared back at him through the blood dripping from her forehead. 
If I have to die, you’re coming with me! 
He remembered what she had said just before. Finally, after a chilling crack of bones, he spread his fingers wide and withdrew the gun, yanking her up from the ground, "I’m telling you one last time. If you fail again, I won’t spare any of your family or friends, not a single one." 
"..." 
Family? 
The only family she had was the younger brother who had grown up with her in the orphanage. 
Yang Xueshan’s face was covered in blood, but upon hearing these words, a glint of determination flickered in her eyes, "Rest assured, if... if I fail again, you won’t need to kill me. I’ll take my brother and end it all in front of you!" 
"..." 
It was an ironic situation. Just a few hours earlier, he had been in this office, smiling as he told her that if she succeeded, he would take her to Switzerland to buy back that ring. 
But a few hours later, here he was, gripping her neck and warning her that if she failed again, he wouldn’t even spare her brother. 
This was karma! 
Ou Yuze stared at the woman for a long time. Eventually, he hurled her aside viciously, "Speak, what should we do?" 
Yang Xueshan was shoved to the ground, gasping in pain, but upon hearing his question, she immediately suppressed her own suffering and sweetly looked toward the man. 
"The most urgent thing now is to prevent that batch of jade stones from being stored in the finished goods warehouse to prevent a major incident. That way, Longfeng won’t be in trouble and your grandfather... cough cough... won’t be alarmed." 
The injuries were too severe; she couldn’t talk for long before breaking into violent coughs. 
Ou Yuze was unmoved. He returned to his desk, tossed the gun into the drawer, and lit a cigarette for himself. 
"And then?" 
"Then, what we need to do is draw that woman away. We can’t directly intervene now, or she will definitely suspect us of tampering. So, we can only divert her attention. Then we tamper with the machinery to cause a malfunction—that way, the products will be stuck there, and won’t flow into the finished goods warehouse." 
"..." 
PS: I’m about to die laughing. When I was setting the timer, my hand shook, and I accidentally released a Chapter in the middle. I quickly released the rest... Originally, I set the update time to be at midnight, but today I messed up, and there are still 4 Chapters that must be released at midnight, or else I’ll have skipped a day tomorrow. My apologies...
###Chapter 463: Chapter 463: The Show Begins 7
It’s hard to deny that this woman does have some brains; despite such a blow, she can still think of this. 
Of course, it’s also very possible, as the man before her said, her true nature is that of a person who only loves herself. Since Ou Yuze has already abandoned her, what she needs to do now is to save her own life as much as possible. 
Lure away? 
Ou Yuze agreed to her proposal, but when he heard the word ’lure,’ the first thing that flashed in his eyes was a vicious intent to kill. 
That woman, on her first day, embarrassed him in front of so many people, and now she expects him to personally divert her attention? noveldrama
She must be dreaming! 
He rolled up his sleeves and walked out, "Where is she now?" 
"Right in the polishing workshop!" 
The polishing workshop? 
He remembered the workshop he had visited several times before, and suddenly, a cold smile appeared on his lips, "There’s no office there, right?" 
Yang Xueshan, seeing his expression, couldn’t help but shiver, "No, what are you thinking of doing?" 
The man looked at her with the cold gaze of a venomous snake, "What do you think I’m planning to do?" 
"..." 
Yang Xueshan, still leaning on the ground, felt her face change at his words, and the fear that had just calmed down for a short while began to creep up from the bottom of her heart like vines. 
Indeed, this is the man’s true nature; brutal, malicious, fiercely violent. With just a casual utterance, a life could end in his hands. Those lives, in his mouth, are like weeds, not worth mentioning at all. 
She shuddered violently, "It’s just to stop those products from entering the finished goods warehouse, that’s all. Luring her away would suffice; there’s no need to lay a hand on her." 
"I don’t have the time to lure her away; killing her is more straightforward!" 
"But don’t forget, she’s Mu Chen’s person. If you touch her and he finds out, he won’t let you off." 
"Mu Chen?" 
At the mention of this name, the man let out a sarcastic laugh, "That’s if he has the ability to discover it, isn’t it?" 
Having said the last sentence, he left the office. 
At his words, Yang Xueshan’s face whitened brutally, and all her strength seemed to drain away in an instant. Her body slackened, and she fell... her back against... 
Is he mad, daring to kill that woman?!! 
--- 
Ye Ning truly hadn’t left the polishing workshop for a moment. The arrival of that woman just now; she knew, she had felt it. So now, more than ever, she dared not leave. No matter what, she had to get all the new products into the finished goods warehouse before the end of her shift. 
But as she was watching, someone suddenly called her from behind, "Assistant An, there’s a phone call for you." 
Someone was looking for her? 
Ye Ning turned around and saw that it was a workshop employee who called her, so she looked towards the phone booth not far away. 
In the polishing workshop, because the equipment inside was very large and noisy, there was no office set up. Instead, a phone was provided for communication purposes. 
And this phone was, coincidentally, in a simple booth behind the main engine of the polishing machine, and the booth’s location was right by the workshop’s rolling shutter door. 
A phone call for her? 
Who? 
She checked herself and realized that she appeared not to have brought her cellphone with her. After pondering for a moment, she finally turned and went towards the phone booth...
###Chapter 464: Chapter 464: The Show Begins 8
"Hello, this is An Ning. Who is this?" 
"An Ning, the design department has come out with the new blueprints. When will you come take a look?" 
Design department? 
Ye Ning glanced at her watch and then at the products that were undergoing the final process on the machinery, she said into the receiver, "Five o’clock, just wait another half an hour, quickly..." 
Before she could finish the word "quickly," something above her head suddenly made a cracking sound. What was that? 
She looked up instinctively and noticed that, at that very moment, the rolling shutter door above the phone booth suddenly fell. The nearly ten-meter-tall shutter, like a wild horse that had broken free, smashed down hard toward the ground below! 
"An Ning! Get out! Watch out!" The loud noise attracted the workshop manager as well. Seeing what was happening, his face drastically changed, and he yelled out to Ye Ning inside the phone booth. 
Ye Ning was also startled. In a split-second, she glanced at the polished jade about to be sent to the finished goods channel inside the workshop and then at the exit door to safety just one step away. 
Suddenly, she clenched her teeth, tossed the phone aside, and like an arrow released from its bow, she sprinted out of the phone booth and rushed to the main console. 
"An Ning—" 
"Ship it!!" 
With a forceful slap on the button, in an instant, the jade products that were polished and ready, like a river flowing into the sea, all entered the adjoining finished goods channel. 
The opportunity she had waited for so many years—she would complete it even if it meant death! 
It was at this moment that the rolling shutter door above the phone booth also fell, and the people in the workshop only heard a loud "bang" before the phone booth shattered like a crushed biscuit, with debris flying in all directions. 
"An Ning!!" 
Seeing this, the workshop manager turned pale with shock and hurried over to pull the girl standing next to the main console to safety, but at that moment, a shard had already flown toward them. 
Immediately after, everyone only heard a scream, and then the shard smashed viciously towards that figure! 
Just as the fragment was about to hit the girl, suddenly a dark shadow flew in from nowhere, and with a sharp "clang," that shadow knocked the shard forcefully to the ground. 
My God! noveldrama
What was that? Was this some martial arts drama? 
The people in the workshop were dumbfounded, even Ye Ning, who was holding the machine operator’s head next to the main console, was stunned. 
It wasn’t until the shard fell to the ground that a figure entered from the emergency exit of the workshop, and she stood up from the ground as if awakening from a dream, "Ying Hao, it was you!" 
"Yes, are you okay? Did you get hurt anywhere?" 
Ying Hao, who had just arrived, immediately started checking her over from all sides. 
Ye Ning, still shaken, only then felt the pain in her arm. She looked down and saw... 
"There’s so much blood! Let’s get you to the hospital right away." Ying Hao, upon seeing this, didn’t waste a second and was ready to take her to the hospital. 
Are you kidding me? 
His main task here was to protect her. Now that she had almost been in accident and was injured, if he didn’t get her to the hospital, that man in the hospital would skin him alive.
###Chapter 465: Chapter 465: The Show Begins 9
Regardless of whether she agreed, he pulled her along and left. 
Ye Ning was pulled away, unable to resist, and could only hastily instruct the workshop director to properly hand over the jade ware that had just been moved to the finished goods warehouse, making sure none was omitted. 
Now that the jade ware had entered the finished goods warehouse, whether she stayed or not didn’t matter anymore; the new materials were already mixed with the old, and if they wanted to stop it, it was too late to turn back. 
So, she followed Ying Hao out of the workshop. 
Coming out, outside, due to the sudden accident in this workshop, many people had blocked the door, staring at the malfunctioning roll-up door and the mess on the ground, their expressions as shocked as could be. noveldrama
"How could this door fall down? Isn’t it electric?" 
"Is it too old and worn-out?" 
"Impossible, I remember that this door was just replaced not long ago."
"Really?" 
"..." 
Ye Ning heard the discussions and came over, wanting to ask what had happened, but at this moment, she heard hurried footsteps rushing down the stairs. She looked up and immediately saw a man running down from above. 
It was a man she knew very well, dressed in a beige suit, wearing a red tie, his hair slicked back. Coming down from the stairs and seeing the scene below, he was initially pleased, but then, as his gaze lifted and he saw Ye Ning standing there, the steps he was about to take froze in place. 
"It’s Young Master Sun here. Young Master Sun, the roll-up door here is broken, what should we do?" 
The onlookers below turned and walked toward him when they saw this man. 
Yet, what Ye Ning found strange was that, as the owner of the company, the person who should have stepped forward to resolve such a problem seemed completely oblivious to the calls of the people below. 
Instead, his eyes, like a tempest swirling, stared at her with a mixture of shock and anger! 
What was he doing? Why was he staring at her like that? 
Ye Ning saw his gaze narrow slightly and also walked over; Ying Hao, who was behind her trying to pull her back, couldn’t hold onto her. 
"Young Master Sun, why have you come here too?" 
This was her second time dealing with him face-to-face since she had returned; the first time, they had formally met, when she had provoked him so much that he nearly threw a cup at her. After that, they rarely saw each other to avoid conflict. 
Even though they were in the same company. 
However, on hearing her question, the man on the stairs seemed to snap out of it, his eyes flashed, and he averted the gaze that had been fixated on her: "Nothing, I just heard some noise and came to check it out." 
"Is that so? Then what do you think caused this? I just heard them say that this roll-up door had been recently replaced." 
"How would I know that? I’m not from the maintenance department. If there’s a problem, just call them to have a look." With that, he turned to leave. 
Ye Ning stood below, looking up at him. Seeing that he was about to leave, she suddenly asked from behind, "How come Young Master Sun is coming down from here? Isn’t this the production building? When did you come over here?" 
"..." 
The figure stiffened instantly as if suddenly struck by something, coming to an abrupt halt like someone whose pressure point had been touched.
###Chapter 466: Chapter 466: The Show Begins 10
"This is my company, where I can go wherever I want to. Who are you to tell me otherwise?" 
... 
Ye Ning’s gaze started to chill as she stepped onto the staircase. She began ascending step by step, and not until she reached his side, finally able to look at him eye to eye, did she stop. 
It was the first time in five years that she had examined him so seriously and at such close range. 
In five years, his features had not changed at all. If there had to be any difference, it was that the fierceness in his eyes had grown stronger, and the sleazy, cunning air about him had intensified. 
How had she ever taken a fancy to such a man? 
She flashed a trace of disgust, slightly turning her head away, "I received a phone call in the workshop just now. It was from the design department, saying they were looking at the new blueprints. But, Mr. Sun, in the few days that I’ve been here, the design department hasn’t put out any new product plans." 
"What did you say?" noveldrama
"Also, Mr. Sun, your fingers... they’re greasy!" 
Her tone abruptly shifted as she lowered her gaze to his hands. 
Her expression didn’t change, but her voice was eerie like a ghost. As she uttered these words, the air around her seemed to come alive with a deathly aura. In an instant, the atmosphere on the staircase grew icy cold. 
Ou Yuze was taken aback, quickly looking down to see that indeed there were black industrial grease stains on his index and middle fingers. His heart fluttered in panic and he instinctively wiped his hand on his body. 
"This workshop is filthy everywhere. What’s the big deal if I got a bit of grease on my hand? Do you have a problem with that?" 
He cursed angrily, but as he wiped his hands, the black grease left two striking smears on his beige trousers—truly an eyesore! 
Looking at all this, Ye Ning sneered, "No problem, but this type of grease is quite uncommon. It’s neither industrial oil nor the lubricant from our machines. It looks more like the grease dust that has been covering something for a long time." 
"What are you implying?" 
"What I’m saying is... if I were to go now and check out the control devices for the rolling shutter door at the main control room of our production department, what do you think I might find?" 
She smiled faintly, her youthful face giving the appearance of a naive young girl. 
But in reality, each word she uttered was like a snake crawling out of the darkness, slithering from her mouth and onto him, causing every inch of his skin, every cell, to shiver with dread. 
"What the hell are you talking about? Are you suspecting me?" He finally began to roar, panic stricken as if he’d been hit where it hurt, even harboring the impulse to kick her down the stairs. 
Yet before he could lay a hand on her, the woman standing next to him suddenly closed in like a ghost, "No, I just want to tell you that when a person does something wrong, there will come a day when they have to pay for it!" 
"What?" 
He caught a whiff of her fresh, light fragrance, and his eyes flickered momentarily. 
Where had he smelled this before? It seemed so familiar. 
At this moment, however, the woman whispered in his ear like a ghost once again, "Remember to come early tomorrow. I’ll be waiting for you..." 
After that, she turned around and descended the staircase as if nothing had happened. 
-
###Chapter 467: Chapter 467 The Secret in Her Eyes...1
"Let’s go now, while the hospital hasn’t closed yet." 
Once downstairs, Ying Hao, who had been waiting, started to urge her on. 
She nodded calmly, hugged her own arms, and left with the man. Before leaving, she did not glance back at the man behind her, whose face was already somewhat distorted. 
Come early tomorrow? 
She’s waiting for him? 
What did she mean by that? Why did he feel something was off about what she said? 
Standing on the staircase, the man watched her departing figure and, in a fit of anger, finally slammed his fist hard against the railing! 
"Young Master Sun!!" 
"What’s all the shouting for? Everyone get out!" 
He roared like a lion that had completely lost its reason, and after the outburst, his bloodshot eyes looked at those people, terrifyingly formidable. 
He hadn’t killed her, and the jade had gone into the finished goods warehouse. What now?!! 
---- 
Half an hour later, at the City First People’s Hospital. 
Ou Mucen’s features were grim, and he stood there, exuding an air of murderous intent as he stared at the doctor who was tending to the woman’s arm. 
"Thir... Third Young Master, it’s just a superficial injury. It’s not a big deal." Intimidated by that imposing aura, the doctor fumbled several times with the tweezers holding the cotton swab. noveldrama
Upon hearing that, he stood up, strode over with his long legs, and fixed his gaze on the woman’s arm that had already been cleaned: "If there’s even a small scar, you won’t have to do this kind of work ever again." 
Doctor: "..." 
Ye Ning had been nervously drumming in her heart and, seeing the doctor nearly scared to tears, finally gathered her courage and tugged at his trousers: "I’m fine, don’t scare him anymore!" 
Ou Mucen coldly stared at the small hand tugging at his pants, wanting to say something more but ultimately swallowed it down. Then, with a long leg, he kicked away to smoke. 
Why had he started smoking again? Wasn’t he still in the hospital?
Ye Ning didn’t wait for the doctor to finish bandaging her before she got off the chair and went over to him: "Why are you smoking again? You haven’t fully recovered yet." 
After saying that, she snatched the cigarette from his hand. 
Ou Mucen didn’t get angry and let her take his cigarette and throw it into the nearby trash can. Then he looked at her arm, now bandaged, and asked, "What exactly happened?" 
Ye Ning suddenly felt a tightness in her heart... 
The incident today was an accident, and she hadn’t expected that scumbag to be crazy enough to physically assault her. 
However, with things having come to this, the plan she hadn’t intended to carry out so ruthlessly suddenly became non-negotiable. She swore that this time, if she didn’t bring down that despicable couple, her name wasn’t Ye Ning! 
But now, because of this, she would have to sacrifice the entire company. 
With her head bowed, she twisted her fingers for a long time before carefully replying, "Nothing, just that while I was in the workshop, the roller shutter suddenly fell." 
"The roller shutter?" 
"Yeah, the polishing workshop’s. I don’t know what happened? Then, while trying to dodge, I carelessly got hurt by some debris." As she spoke, she didn’t dare meet his eyes, fearing that she might betray her nervousness and reveal something she shouldn’t. 
In fact, without looking at him, her fingers were already breaking out in a sweat with nervousness. 
Ou Mucen quietly watched her, expressionless, but the deep black of his eyes, devoid of any light, shifted between brightness and darkness, which was almost unbearable to withstand.
###Chapter 468: Chapter 468 The Secret in Her Eyes... 2
"Have the reasons been investigated?" 
"Not yet, but it’s said that the problem started with the aged wiring in the master control room, which then... fell down." 
"Oh..." 
With just a casual acknowledgment, the man ceased to speak. 
Ye Ning’s palms were drenched with sweat as she stood before him. He was tall, and when he blocked her path, it seemed as if he had obscured all the light in the consultation room. The heavy shadows cast over her were almost suffocating. 
Fortunately, it wasn’t long before the doctor came back in. Seeing the two, he handed over a prescription slip, "Third Young Master, this is her prescription." 
It was at that moment when the man, who had been looking down at her from his lofty position, finally withdrew his gaze and took the prescription slip. 
"Alright, I’ll go get your medication, and you should go back to your ward." 
"Yes, okay!" 
Feeling like she had been granted amnesty, Ye Ning quickly agreed and left the consultation room. 
The man left in the room glanced at the prescription slip in his hand before looking up and out the door, "Aren’t you coming in?" 
After his command, Ying Hao, paling and waiting outside for a long time, entered with his head bowed. 
"Third Young Master..." 
"What exactly happened?" 
Ying Hao immediately explained, "It wasn’t an accident. Right when the incident occurred, I was conveniently called away." 
"Conveniently called away?" 
"Yes, a very ordinary clerk from the personnel department asked me to fetch a fax. But afterwards, I found out that the fax wasn’t important. By the time I returned with the fax, the incident had already taken place." 
Even now, Ying Hao felt a lingering sense of dread when he recalled the scene. 
At that time, he had just collected the fax and was on his way to Ye Ning’s office when, in the corridor, he overheard someone mentioning an incident in the polishing workshop. He immediately rushed to the workshop at top speed. 
Upon arrival, the situation had already escalated to a point where he had no time to think and could only use the short dagger he always carried to shatter the glass window to intercept the falling debris. 
As a Hidden Guard, it was normal for him to be armed. 
Fortunately, the dagger was sharp enough. After piercing through the window glass, it managed to cut down the fragments. 
Ou Mucen, standing there, felt his mood darken instantly as he listened, a great sense of danger and chilliness emerging in his expression. 
"Have you found out who it was?" noveldrama
"Not yet, but Ou Yuze suddenly showed up when we were leaving, and Miss An spoke a lot to him." 
"An Ning spoke a lot to him?" 
The man, who had been standing with his arms crossed, was momentarily taken aback by this statement, "Why?" 
Ying Hao shook his head, "It was too far to hear clearly, but from their expressions, Ou Yuze seemed very shocked and panicked after hearing Miss An’s words, and I heard him cursing at Miss An." 
"Is that so?" 
"Yes, but Miss An looked very calm. After she finished speaking, she followed me to the hospital." 
Ying Hao knew his master was extremely intelligent, so he tried to describe the scene as accurately as possible. 
He found the matter quite strange; logically, Miss An and this Young Master Sun didn’t know each other, so why would she go and talk to him under those circumstances? 
And why did Young Master Sun exhibit such an enraged and embarrassed reaction after hearing her words?
###Chapter 469: Chapter 469 The Secret in Her Eyes... 3
Ying Hao couldn’t understand! 
But although he couldn’t understand, the man standing in front of him did... 
So, did this matter actually relate to Ou Yuze? And that woman, had she already cleverly discovered him? 
As the thought settled, his brow furrowed slightly, and his entire expression darkened! 
She was very smart, and he was quite happy about that, but why hadn’t she told him these things? Just now, when he asked her, she had clearly been very careful, trying her best not to let him find out. 
Why was she doing this? Did she still not trust him? 
Or could it be that, up to this point, she had never intended to give her all to him. noveldrama
His gaze became gloomier, and at the same time, the expression on his face grew colder and colder! 
"Alright, I’ve got it. You can go now," he said. 
"What about the company, Third Young Master..." 
"Don’t worry about her, let her do as she pleases," he instructed in the end, before taking the prescription and leaving. 
---- 
Ye Ning returned to the hospital room. Because her hand was injured, she didn’t fuss around and directly made a phone call to Secretary Gao, "Secretary Gao, have you gotten off work? Could you help me pick up Xiaobao?" 
"I’ve already picked him up, and I’ll deliver him to the hospital soon." 
Unexpectedly, Secretary Gao told her over the phone that the child had already been picked up. 
Hearing this, Ye Ning suddenly felt a warmth in her heart... 
Without a doubt, that man must have arranged this — he cared so much about her and her son, yet tomorrow she was planning to drag his company into her revenge, was she going too far? 
After feeling touched, thinking about what she was about to do tomorrow, she couldn’t help but stand in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, looking out at the myriad lights of the city below, falling into a struggle. 
As she absentmindedly gazed out, the sound of the door opening came from behind her. She turned to look and realized the man had brought her medication back. 
"I’ve brought back the medicine. When will you take it?" 
"In a bit," she replied. 
She hurried over, walking towards him. 
Ou Mucen, seeing this, didn’t say anything else. After she approached, he handed her the medication and then stepped towards the bathroom. 
Ye Ning, not suspecting anything, took the medication and poured two glasses of water. She then went to sit by the small table, "Ou Mucen, what do you want to eat tonight? I’ll call and order it now." 
Since he was admitted to the hospital, he complained about the hospital food being too unpalatable, and with her working at Longfeng, she didn’t have time to cook for him. So most of the time, he ordered from outside hotels — after all, the food from those big hotels wasn’t bad. 
But after she said that from outside the bathroom, there was no answer from inside. Instead, the sound of running water just kept flowing continuously. 
What was he doing? 
She looked suspiciously towards the bathroom, wanting to ask, but then she thought about the separation between men and women, and considering the current state of their relationship wasn’t that intimate, she stopped and continued to sit and wait. 
After about ten minutes, finally, the door opened. She immediately got up from the chair and looked at him, "Are you alright? Why were you in there for so long?" 
Ou Mucen shook the water off his hands, his face looking even whiter and cleaner from the days in the hospital. He fixed his gaze on her, "I’m fine, what’s up?" 
"Nothing, just... wanted to ask what you want to eat tonight?" 
Eat what? 
He grabbed a paper towel and bowed his head to dry his hands, "Don’t stay here to eat, it’s just stuff that’s been ordered in, there’s no nutrition. When Xiaobao arrives, you take him back and eat there."
###Chapter 470: Chapter 470 The Secret in Her Eyes... 4
"Ah?" 
Ye Ning began to doubt her own ears. 
Was he... trying to send her away? 
In an instant, the fingers holding the menu paled slightly, and at the same time, in her heart, she felt as though she had been abandoned, that sense of loss made her particularly uncomfortable. 
"And you?" 
"You don’t need to worry about me, I can take care of myself." The tall man, dressed in light blue plaid hospital clothes, stood in the room, his figure set against the stark white walls looking somewhat cold, and the emotionless expression in his eyes appeared exceptionally distant. 
Ye Ning’s face turned pale instantly, and she slowly put the menu back. 
Why had he suddenly become so indifferent to her? Just moments ago in the clinic, he wasn’t like this; he had even lost his temper with the doctor because she was hurt, scaring the latter quite a bit. 
But why had he changed so suddenly? 
Could it be... because of something Ying Hao had said? 
She recalled the person who had been waiting outside the clinic when she had come out, and finally, with little confidence already in this relationship, she lowered her head, "Okay..." 
One word! 
That was her answer, just that single word, and then she turned and left the place. 
The man standing in the sickroom, upon seeing her leave without even uttering a single word to fight for herself, or a question, felt the frustration welling up in his chest, and his features immediately contorted with brooding anger! 
"Ying Hao!!" 
"Third Master..." 
"Starting tomorrow, I forbid this damned woman from coming to see me!!"
"..." Ying Hao. 
Third Master, she didn’t even say she would come to see you; it’s you who always has me tempt and threaten her to come. 
Ying Hao didn’t know what had set off the Third Master’s temper again... noveldrama
— 
Ye Ning’s eyes were red as she made her way back to her place. 
Upon her return, since Xiaobao wasn’t there yet, she rushed to the bathroom, didn’t even close the door, turned on the shower, and just let her tears flow amidst the deluge... 
She was absolutely certain that he must have found out about her plan. He was so clever; back in Japan, he had even guessed that Lin Yebai was the real culprit behind everything, so how could he not know about the tricks she had been playing at Longfeng recently. 
Therefore, his coldness and distance just now, she was certain, it was because he knew about her plan to drag his entire company down with her, that’s why he acted this way towards her. 
At this thought, she suddenly remembered what Lin Yebai had said to her that day, and suddenly, it felt as though something was piercing her heart, making it difficult for her to even breathe. 
She really had overestimated herself, naively believing that if he liked her, he would do anything for her. 
That’s hundreds of billions we’re talking about. As a proud son of heaven, what kind of woman didn’t he have? Whether it was status, appearance, or wealth, truly, if he just gave the word, countless women would willingly throw themselves into his bed. 
But he didn’t want them, he didn’t fancy anyone else, he fancied her; in this vast world, such an outstanding man set his eyes on her! 
A woman who had given birth out of wedlock and was still a fugitive, unable to see the light of day to this very moment. 
She cried bitterly, beginning to stare blankly at the woman in the mirror... 
There was a very disheveled woman, eyes red, her face wet, her hair a mess, completely lacking her usual spirit, looking almost no different from when she was in prison.
###Chapter 471: Chapter 471 The Secret in Her Eyes... 5
Having returned from the hospital just an hour ago, how had she managed to look so haggard? 
She slowly reached for her face, about to wipe away the tears, when suddenly, the phone beside her began to ring. noveldrama
Who would call at this time? 
She glanced at the phone and after a long moment, picked it up, "Hello?" 
"Assistant An, I’m the manager of the finished goods warehouse. Are we supposed to work overtime tonight to package today’s batch of orders?" 
Once the call connected, she hadn’t expected it to be from the company, asking whether they needed to package today’s goods or not. 
According to the plan, she intended to leave that couple with nowhere to bury their corpses; the goods definitely needed to be packaged because they could go on sale tomorrow after that. 
The words she had whispered into that scumbag’s ear before she left the office this afternoon, telling him to come early in the morning as she would wait for him at the company, were for this very reason. 
Once the goods hit the market, the news of Longfeng’s counterfeit items would surely erupt, and by then, it wouldn’t just be about the three hundred million but the entire Longfeng’s brand and reputation. The loss would be immeasurable. 
It might even completely topple Longfeng for good. 
This was the ultimate outcome she desired! 
But then, seeing her disheveled reflection in the mirror and remembering the man’s indifferent and distant attitude from not long ago, her hatred suddenly came to an abrupt halt, replaced by the pain of losing something far from her. 
Was it revenge she wanted? 
Or him? 
She stood there, thinking for a very long time, and finally, staring at her reflection, she spoke word by word, "No need, just leave the goods there." 
"Leave them here? Not pack them?" 
"Yes, don’t pack them, leave a set of warehouse keys at my office." Then, she hung up the phone. 
The person on the phone was confused upon hearing this, and stood frozen for quite some time... 
What did Assistant An mean? She had informed him to bring people to work overtime tonight, but why did she change her mind now that he had brought the people? 
He couldn’t figure it out, but since the person on the phone had said so, he had no choice but to comply. 
After locking the warehouse door again, he delivered the keys to that assistant’s office and then left work. 
An hour later, in the now-quiet factory surroundings, a silver-gray Mercedes slowly approached the main gate. 
The security guard in the booth at the gate stuck his head out, "Who’s there? It’s so late, everyone’s gone home!" 
"Sorry, it’s Assistant An, I left something in my office." 
"Oh, it’s Assistant An, right, right, I’ll open the gate for you right away!" 
Upon recognizing the person in the car as the company’s boss, the security guard hurriedly opened the electric gate and watched as the silver-gray Mercedes drove in. 
It was indeed Assistant An’s car, she had been driving this one to the factory these past few days. 
Without overthinking it, once the car was in, he returned to his booth to listen to his radio and play with his phone. 
Meanwhile, the silver Mercedes, after entering the company premises, headed straight to her office. There, she found the keys to the office and, alone in the dark, entered the company’s finished goods warehouse. 
In today’s world, there are many jewelry appraisers, but those who can tell whether a piece of jade is genuine or fake with just one glance are almost nonexistent.
###Chapter 472: Chapter 472 The Secret in Her Eyes...6
Jewelry appraisal, according to the procedure, even for a master-level expert, still requires careful observation and contemplation, and with the aid of various tools, one can discern the authenticity of a product. 
Moreover, this batch of jade materials was not of the finest quality to begin with; they were just flawed stones, making it even harder to determine their authenticity. 
That’s why, after learning that the afternoon incident was orchestrated by that scumbag, Ye Ning still dared to leave. The reason being that even if he found out, he wouldn’t be able to separate the real from the fake stones! noveldrama
Unless he decided to destroy all the products in the company’s warehouse! 
Ye Ning entered the warehouse, which was locked but still illuminated by streetlamps. She opened the door and stepped inside, heading to the products she had worked so hard to get there before the end of the afternoon shift. 
It had to be acknowledged that Longfeng’s production channels were incredibly advanced. As she turned on the light tube over the packing table, thousands of jade ornaments appeared in the channel trough, their lush green luster dripping and shining irresistibly, the scenery extraordinarily beautiful. 
However, what made this beauty imperfect was that many of the beautiful stones had flaws, like a bowl of green beans suddenly mixed with red beans, thoroughly disordering the batch. 
Let’s begin! 
Seeing this scene, she finally stopped hesitating. Staring at those pieces of jade, her eyes narrowed slightly, and in an instant, a chill emerged from her pupils. Another color of glass flashed through her beautiful eyes, and the real ornaments glittered like fireflies, scattered across her field of vision. 
— 
Ou Mucen didn’t have dinner that night; he was in a foul mood, especially after Secretary Gao had taken the child away as well. 
"Mucen, I’ve come to see you..." 
La Chenxi was hesitant to enter when she found him in the hospital room, hammering away at the computer keyboard as if he had a vendetta against it, holding something in her hands and meekly calling out from the doorway. 
Hearing her voice, the man in the hospital room’s expression turned even darker. He ignored her and continued with his work. 
Seeing this, La Chenxi, standing at the door, bit her lip and finally, still holding the item in her hand, gathered her courage and came in, "Mucen, Chengzhi asked me to come. He has some work and will be away on a business trip for two days. He’s worried about you being in the hospital alone, so, he asked me to come..." 
... 
After she finished speaking, the man who was busy at the small table finally snapped his fingers and stopped. 
"Ji Chengzhi? He asked you to come?" 
La Chenxi was immediately panicked, "Yes... yes, he called me..." 
She didn’t know when it had started, but she had become especially afraid of him; even speaking to him always made her anxious that she might say something wrong, a feeling she had never had back in school. 
When Ou Mucen heard that it was Ji Chengzhi who had called her, his expression grew even more somber. Just as he was about to ask her to leave, his phone suddenly rang... 
Ying Hao? 
Seeing this name displayed on his phone, he answered the call without hesitation, "Hello?" 
"Third Young Master, I just saw Miss An return to the company in the surveillance footage." 
"What did you say?" 
"My phone is connected to the office surveillance. There’s a notification when someone enters, and about half an hour ago, I saw her return to her office."
###Chapter 473: Chapter 473 The Secret in Her Eyes...7
On the phone, Ying Hao’s voice sounded a bit rushed, probably because he was afraid that Ou Mucen would only see the message half an hour later. He was worried about getting scolded by his boss and was tense. 
Go back to his own office? 
When Ou Mucen heard this news, he paused for a moment, "What is she going back for?" 
Ying Hao shook his head: "According to the video records, around seven o’clock, an employee from the production department entered her office and left a set of keys. Then, about half an hour later, she appeared in the office, took the keys, and left." 
"And then?" 
"Then she wasn’t seen coming out!" 
Ying Hao reported truthfully on the phone. There was no helping it; when he had initially linked his phone to the company’s surveillance, he had only connected to the areas she frequently visited. He didn’t bother with the other places.
For one thing, his phone’s memory wasn’t large, and for another, there were so many departments in the company that it was impossible to link to each one. 
Ou Mucen also knew this, so after hearing what he said, he did not blame him. However, after pondering for a moment, he did think of a key point: the set of keys. 
"Check which department that employee is from? After you find out, bring up that place’s surveillance footage and send it to my phone." 
"Understood, Third Young Master!" 
With the tip, Ying Hao promptly went to carry it out. 
La Chenxi had been standing by, waiting for him to finish the call. Seeing that he had finally hung up, she brought over the things she was carrying: "Mucen, haven’t you eaten yet? This is your favorite Italian risotto and seafood soup. I made it myself. Try it." 
As she spoke, she started to open the insulated box to take the food out. 
But just then, the man sitting in the chair, upon smelling the scent, didn’t even lift an eyelid. A single, icy word came from his thin lips: "Scram!" 
"What?" La Chenxi thought she was hallucinating. noveldrama
Scram? 
Was he telling her to scram? 
Could it be that he had become so upfront that he couldn’t even be bothered to say a perfunctory word to her? Just directly telling her to scram? 
Her eyes widened as she looked at him, her pale fingers gripping the insulated box tightly: "Mucen, you..." 
"I told you to scram. Didn’t you hear? Need me to say it a second time?" he finally looked up at her, but his gaze was as hurtful as it could possibly be. 
La Chenxi’s face turned utterly pale in an instant. She tried to say a few more words, but then his phone rang again. She watched as he put down the cup he was holding and immediately picked up the phone. 
"Third Young Master, I’ve found it. She’s in the finished goods warehouse. I’ve linked the surveillance camera to your phone. Have a look." 
"Hmm!" 
After hearing this, Ou Mucen ended the call, directly accessed his email on his phone, and found the real-time surveillance video that was being transmitted. 
Sure enough, in that video frame, within the warehouse lit by only two incandescent tubes, a familiar petite figure stood in front of a packing table. On that table lay swathes of jade items spread out, looking quite spectacular. 
What is she doing? 
He was a bit puzzled, so he zoomed in on the footage, only to be surprised to see that upon enlarging the image, she was picking through the jade items. Just like picking beans, with her slender fingers, she continuously selected some pieces from the pile of jade, placing them beside her.
###Chapter 474: Chapter 474 The Secret in Her Eyes...8
What on earth was she doing? Why was she picking that out in the dead of night? 
He pondered without coming to a conclusion, until he saw the mark of a large "A" where the jade pieces she selected were placed, and then he finally understood. 
It turned out she was choosing materials! 
Materials she had tampered with earlier today! 
That meant she was now distinguishing real from fake among a pile of chaotic products with her naked eye? 
Wasn’t that too bizarre?!! 
He was shocked in place, even forgetting to drink from the cup he held in his hand... 
However, what shocked him the most, what left him utterly dumbfounded, happened when the batch of products in front of that figure was picked over, and a new batch was pushed forward and spread out on the velvet cloth—the more horrifying event occurred. 
"Whoosh—" 
It was truly just the brush of those slender fingers over the jade pieces, and after scanning those items with her eyes for a couple of sweeps, in less than a second, she started picking them up as one would select beans, rapidly. 
Oh, my God! 
Was that really her? Why did he suddenly feel a tingling sensation on his scalp? 
He was completely shocked by the scene on his phone, and extending his finger, he zoomed in on the image again. It was then that he finally saw her face, and those eyes that were staring at the jade pieces! 
Those were eyes... he had never seen before! 
All his expressions froze in an instant, and his fingers gripping the cup trembled, then the cup fell with a "clang," shattering before him. 
Oh my God, that was too unbelievable! 
"Mucen, are you alright?" 
La Chenxi, who was standing across from him, saw this scene and, greatly alarmed, quickly ran over to check on his hand. 
But at this moment, the man seemed to regain consciousness suddenly, pushed her away, and rose from the chair, grabbed the car keys from the table, and rushed out in haste. 
"Mucen? Mucen, where are you going?" Left behind, La Chenxi, seeing this, hurriedly chased after him.
However, his figure was so fast that she hadn’t even left the VIP ward area when she saw his silhouette heading straight down the stairs. Afterward, the hospital, shrouded in the vast night, saw a black Bentley quickly drive out of the parking lot and disappear into the night at breakneck speed. 
— 
Meanwhile, at Longfeng Company. 
After more than an hour of selection, Ye Ning had almost sorted the products, but because of the high intensity of using her eyes, she was feeling a strong sense of discomfort. 
Her eyes worked like this; each use would result in a significant rebound, like last time in Japan when she saw the Jade Marrow Qi left on those work clothes by Ou Mucen’s Jade Bracelet, which led to sharp pain and incessant tears. 
This time, although the batch of goods wasn’t the finest jade, a full hour of Pupula Duplex manifestation had put an unbearable pressure on her eyeballs from the two pupils, as well as the various blood vessels and nerves supplying them. 
She was now feeling dizzy and nauseous. 
"Ugh..." 
She rubbed the Jingming Acupoint that was becoming uncomfortable, and moved the last part of the jade ornaments up, planning to endure it and finish before leaving. noveldrama
But after moving them up, when she tried to look at them with her pupils again, the condition worsened. Not only was she feeling dizzy, but she also saw double images. As a result, she had to close her eyes for a while, resting her head down. 
"Creak..." 
She was just resting for a bit before continuing the selection, but at that moment, she suddenly heard the sound of the electric rolling door outside being opened.
###Chapter 475: Chapter 475 The Secret in Her Eyes...9
What’s going on? Is someone coming? 
Upon hearing that voice, her face changed instantly; she spun around and ran to the doorway of the finished goods warehouse. Peering in the direction of the workshop’s main entrance, she indeed saw a sliver of light emerging. Her heart leaped within her, and she hurried back inside the warehouse to turn the two incandescent bulbs off. 
She absolutely couldn’t let anyone discover her here, or else once the incident came to light tomorrow, she would definitely be exposed! 
At this thought, cold sweat dripped down from her forehead. noveldrama
In the pitch darkness, the jade ornaments still emitted a luminescent green color, that even seemed stronger than when the lights were on. 
However, she no longer had the luxury of time to notice this. If that person were to come in and see her here, she’d be in trouble. Thoughts raced through her mind, and after a few seconds, evidently having heard footsteps approaching from outside, she bit down on her teeth and pushed all the products she hadn’t had time to pick through into the defective area. 
In the defective area, the warehouse inspectors would naturally re-examine them the next day. By then, if there were any issues, she could figure out a solution tomorrow morning. 
After dealing with the products, she returned the selected jade pieces to their previous channel and quickly climbed onto the conveyor. 
This conveyor was connected to the adjacent polishing workshop, the very machine she used to bring the jade pieces in during the day, making it the perfect escape route at this moment. 
Two minutes later, outside the polishing workshop, a slender figure dashed out and promptly vanished into the night... 
Meanwhile, in the finished goods warehouse, when Ou Mucen lifted the roller shutter door to enter, what he encountered was an empty warehouse with its lights extinguished. 
Confronted with this sight, the man stepping into the warehouse stood within a beam of cold white light, his gaze resting on the jade pieces that had been hastily tidied up, his handsome brows furrowing, and an icy chill around him that made it difficult for anyone to breathe. 
"Third... Third Young Master, what brings you here so late... Is there something you need?" 
The person following behind him was the security guard from the entrance. Seeing the famous Third Young Master of the Ou Family with a steely complexion, he felt so frightened that he could barely stand straight. 
The Third Young Master had never visited since taking control of the company, so why the sudden appearance now? 
Especially to a place like this. Was there something the Third Young Master needed? 
The security guard didn’t dare to even let out a breath! 
After what felt like an eternity, but was no more than three minutes, the man who stood in the light looking icy down to every line of his figure finally spoke, his voice cold as ice, "Move all those over here, inside!" 
Huh? 
The security guard didn’t understand. 
Those? 
The products on the platform? Inside this channel? 
But this was work for the company’s warehouse staff, and he was just a security guard who knew nothing. What if he messed up their tasks? 
Yet, his moment of hesitation provoked the man cloaked in a grim air, who started yelling, "Don’t you understand? Don’t feel like working, is that it? If you don’t want this job, get out of here right now." 
"No, no, no, I’ll do it right away, right away!" 
The security guard didn’t dare to ask further questions. He came over and quickly dumped all the jade pieces from the platform back into the channel, stirred them forcefully as instructed, mixing both materials until he was told to stop. 
What was the Third Young Master doing? Everything had been just fine, why did he ask him to put the jade pieces back?
###Chapter 476: Chapter 476 The Secret in Her Eyes...10
After stirring up trouble, he looked at the man who seemed like a god of destruction, his head covered in cold sweat again, "Third Young Master..." 
"If you utter a single word about tonight’s events, I’ll make you disappear from this world!" 
"No... I wouldn’t dare say..." 
... 
After standing there and staring for a while, the man, who was exuding an aura of chilly dread, finally turned and walked away... 
The Third Young Master of the Ou Family, indeed more terrifying than the legends said! 
--- 
Ye Ning drove frantically all the way home. 
Upon returning, she found that the young child had not yet slept; her son was sitting on the sofa waiting for her. Immediately, she covered her painfully sore eye corner and went over, "Xiaobao, why haven’t you slept yet? Didn’t I tell you to go to bed first?" 
Ye Xiaobao had been staring at her from the moment she entered; his large, dark eyes hadn’t left her figure. 
Seeing that she kept covering her eye corner, and that her face was streaked with tear tracks, his little face changed instantly, "Mom, have you been crying? Did someone bully you?" 
Ye Ning quickly shook her head, "No, my eye hurts. Right, since you’re still awake, can you fetch some ice for mom, to help me ice it?" 
Her eyes were of a cold nature, and in this kind of situation, the best thing to do was to ice them, to slowly calm the swollen blood vessels and nerves. Only this way would she start to feel relief from her pain. 
Upon hearing this, Xiaobao immediately went to find ice cubes in the fridge. 
Thankfully, the fridge always had ice cubes since the mother and son both liked to drink iced lemon water. So Xiaobao quickly found the ice cubes and, smartly, even brought his mother a small towel. 
Ye Ning immediately took the ice cubes that Xiaobao brought over and prepared to apply them, but at that moment, Ye Xiaobao caught sight of her eye corner and was shocked, "Mom, why is your eye corner all bloody?" 
Really? 
Ye Ning felt a pang of panic and quickly asked her son to bring her a mirror to take a look. 
Indeed, it was terribly frightening; the eyeball itself was blood-red, and at first glance, it seemed as if it were filled with fresh blood, looking particularly horrifying and startling. 
However, upon closer inspection, Ye Ning realized it wasn’t blood but rather that all the blood vessels in her eye had become engorged, which made it appear this way. 
No wonder it hurt so much; it was quite serious! 
Ye Ning quickly applied the ice pack to her eye, "It’s okay, this isn’t blood. It’s just the blood vessels that have become engorged. My eye became like this because I was exposed to some very bright lights at the company today. Don’t worry, Xiaobao." 
"Really?" 
"Yes, really. It’ll be fine after I ice it a bit. You go to sleep now!" 
Worried her son might continue to fret, Ye Ning hurriedly persuaded him to go to bed. 
But in reality, her condition was already so severe that the next second could have resulted in all her blood vessels bursting. By then, even saving her eyesight would be questionable. 
Ye Ning closed her eyes, a flash of fear crossing her heart... 
Seeing his mother apply the ice to her eyes and the evident discomfort on her face easing, Xiaobao obediently went to sleep. 
After Ye Xiaobao went to sleep, the exhausted and pained Ye Ning tied the ice pack to herself and lay down on the sofa, gradually drifting off to sleep. She was simply too weary; the onset of Pupula Duplex had drained her spirit and energy immensely. 
She slept through the night until the next day dawned, not waking until nearly ten o’clock, when her phone rang. She groggily opened her eyes from her slumber. 
"Hello?" noveldrama
"Assistant An, there’s been a major incident. A large number of counterfeit goods have appeared among the products launched by the company this morning!" 
...
###Chapter 477: Chapter 477 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 1
What? 
Counterfeit goods?!? 
When Ye Ning heard this news, her sleepiness instantly vanished! 
"How is that possible? Why would there be counterfeit goods?" noveldrama
"We don’t know either, it’s just that the batch released from the warehouse this morning, soon after it hit our jewelry store, complaints started coming in about the jade not being genuine. Now, people are making a scene at the jewelry store." 
"..." 
Clutching her cellphone, Ye Ning sat on the bed, stunned for a full two minutes before snapping to attention and hurriedly jumping off the bed. 
How could this be possible? She had clearly sorted out the jade pieces last night, how could counterfeit goods have hit the market? Moreover, even if there were counterfeit products, they wouldn’t have made it out in that batch so fast. According to the company’s procedures, after goods are packaged in the finished product warehouse, they shouldn’t reach the market until the afternoon at earliest. How did they end up in the jewelry store so early? 
Ye Ning’s mind was in turmoil. She got out of bed and rushed into the bathroom to wash up quickly. 
"Xiaobao, why didn’t you wake Mommy? Look at the time now!" 
"Mommy, I saw you were sleeping so soundly I didn’t want to disturb you. Besides, isn’t your eye troubling you? I didn’t want you to get up so early to drop me off at school." 
In the living room, the child who was engrossed in playing with his toys seemed to be in no hurry at all. Hearing his mother scolding him for not waking her up, he confidently retorted. 
There was no helping it, in this world, there isn’t a child who loves going to kindergarten. Why not play when you can? 
Ye Ning was powerless and simply got ready in a hurry. After changing her clothes, she emerged saying, "Alright, I’ll take you now. The company called a moment ago, saying there is an emergency." 
"Okay!" 
Ye Xiaobao heard that and obediently agreed. 
After dropping her son off at kindergarten, she rushed to Longfeng, where the fake goods incident had already roused all of the company’s executives. 
"What happened? Why would our jewelry store have counterfeit goods? What exactly is going on?" 
The first to lose his temper, of course, was Ou Muyuan. As soon as he saw the jewelry brought back from the store on the table, his anger was uncontainable, and he flung them all to the ground. 
At that moment, Ye Ning came in and stopped at the doorway. Her eyes fixed on a piece of broken jade that had landed near her foot, "I’m sorry, I felt a bit unwell last night and came late today. What exactly has happened? I heard something about counterfeit goods in the company as soon as I arrived?" 
As soon as her words fell, everyone in the meeting room immediately turned their gaze toward her. 
It was then that she had a clear view of everyone present in the meeting room, and, surprisingly, everyone was there. Aside from Ou Muyuan and the company’s executives, even Yu Zee and that woman named Yang Xueshan were here. 
However, Yang Xueshan looked somewhat odd, several spots on her face were bruised, as though she had been hit by someone. 
Seeing her arrive, Ou Muyuan, already frustrated by the sudden incident, immediately lit up, as if he had latched onto something, and stared intently at her: "Right, Assistant An has arrived. Assistant An, you’re in charge of the production department. With such a major issue happening in the company, how will you take responsibility?" 
The moment he spoke, he didn’t ask questions but instead directly placed the blame for the incident on Ye Ning’s shoulders. 
Indeed, this just had to be the style of the Ou family’s second branch!
###Chapter 478: Chapter 478 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 2
Ye Ning stood there, not angry, but with a calm smile, "President Ou, I don’t quite understand what you’re saying. As the head of production, how can I take responsibility when I don’t even know what has happened?" noveldrama
"If you’re not responsible, should I be responsible instead? You’re in charge of production. When something like this happens, who else should we look for if not you?" Ou Muyuan was like a mad dog, once he latched onto someone, he wouldn’t let go. 
Ye Ning didn’t want to argue with him anymore. Her indifferent gaze swept lightly over the faces of everyone in the meeting, and after a moment, it rested on the young man and woman in the conference room, "Fine, since President Ou insists, let’s investigate." 
Having said that, she walked in step by step within their field of vision. 
Ou Muyuan was overjoyed, and promptly returned to the conference table. 
The others also showed delight, hurriedly returning to their seats. 
There was no choice, at a time like this, with such a serious incident, having someone to take the blame was stronger than anything, and besides, this woman was from Third Young Master’s side. If they could pin it on her, no matter how bad the situation, it wouldn’t be their problem anymore. 
The only ones, the young man and woman, upon seeing this woman taking on the responsibility, didn’t know why, but their hearts "thumped," giving rise to a very bad premonition. 
"Let’s do this, since we have to investigate, let’s start with the surveillance footage, to see if there are any issues with the production channel, shall we?" 
Having sat down, this woman, who looked quite young, laid out a very clear investigation plan. 
Everyone heard and hurriedly nodded their heads, even the young man and woman agreed with a sigh of relief upon hearing that this was the focus of the investigation. 
Check the surveillance? 
If she hadn’t handled even this much before making her move, what was the point of her actions? 
Yang Xueshan’s face, which had been tense, now took on a tone of disdain... 
Ye Ning, seated at the forefront of the right side of the conference table, caught sight of this woman’s expression out of the corner of her eye but didn’t call her out. Instead, she picked up the phone on the table and called Ying Hao, asking him to bring all the surveillance footage from the production department from the last two days. 
She didn’t know why things ended up like this. 
But, now that it had happened, she definitely wouldn’t go easy on them. If even the heavens weren’t willing to let them off, why should she provide them with an escape route? 
After one phone call, Ying Hao quickly transmitted the video up, and so that afternoon, the entire Dragon-Phoenix Jewelry senior management were in the conference room investigating the matter, while outside, Longfeng Jewelry Store was already in deep trouble. 
"Who would have thought that Dragon-Phoenix, a brand that’s been around for so many years, would have such an incident? What has happened to the Ou Family?" 
"Yes, look at the jade bracelet my granddaughter bought for me this morning, it’s obviously fake!" 
"Oh my, in that case, should I also check the items I bought from them before? I’m a regular customer, I shop there often." 
"You must check, such a swindler!" 
"..." 
Within a few hours, the jewelry store which had stood tall in A City for decades became the most sensational scandal in the city, with electronic media and online reports all broadcasting this news. 
Even WeChat Moments and QQ hot topics were continuously updating about it! 
Dragon-Phoenix was truly ablaze!
###Chapter 479: Chapter 479 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 3
When the news reached Blue Mountain Villa, the old master was leisurely sipping morning tea in the living room. Suddenly, upon seeing the news on his phone, he slammed his teacup to the ground and stood up furiously, his eyes blazing with anger. 
"Someone! Prepare my car immediately for Longfeng!!" 
"..." 
A storm was finally coming... 
—— 
One hour later, as Ye Ning had anticipated, Ying Hao’s provided surveillance footage showed no anomalies. 
Seeing this, her eyes lightly swept over everyone in the conference room, and she commenced the second plan, "Alright, since the surveillance cameras are not an issue, let’s investigate the suppliers next, shall we? I’ve heard that this time it was Huo Family who supplied Longfeng for many years, so let’s invite them over first." 
After finishing her words, she gestured to Ying Hao standing by her side, who then immediately made a call to the Huo Family.
The Huo Family, upon receiving the call, denied everything vehemently and were extremely angry, accusing Longfeng of slandering them. 
Hearing that, without saying anything else, Ye Ning took Ying Hao’s phone in full view of everyone and turned on the speakerphone... 
"Mr. Huo, you claim there has been no tampering, and we believe you, but our company has indeed encountered counterfeit goods. If you wish to clear your name, I suggest you take some practical action." 
"What do you mean?" 
"What I mean is... your family’s goods are famously top-notch in the industry. I believe many would be interested in them. Why not investigate who in recent times has purchased a batch of high-quality jade stones worth 300 million?" 
She spoke slowly and deliberately, her delicate and elegant face showing an exasperating calmness. 
This was too abnormal. Such a scandal had broken out, and yet this young lady remained completely composed instead of panicked, her handling of the situation appearing exceedingly unnatural. 
In the conference room, the anxiety of a certain man and woman grew noticeably. 
Especially the woman with an injury on her face, who upon hearing that Ye Ning had asked the Huo Family to investigate which dealer had recently purchased high-quality jade, went from a look of disdain to one of sudden stiffness. noveldrama
How could she know this? 
Who exactly was she, and why was she so familiar with the jade industry? 
She finally felt cold sweat emerging from her back, her eyes fixating on the woman, now filled with panic. 
The Huo Family people promptly conducted the investigation and in less than half an hour, news came... 
"Miss An, I’ve found it. There’s a place in Langfang that acquired a large batch of jade stones just a few days ago." 
"Is that so? Then you should go find them immediately. Perhaps your genuine goods are there," Ye Ning said indifferently, hanging up the phone as soon as she finished speaking. 
Where were the real goods? 
After hanging up the call, the higher-ups in the conference room who had been quietly watching her finally began to stir... 
"Assistant An, what do you mean by this? What do you mean when you say the real goods of the Huo Family are with them?" 
"Yes, Assistant An, what are you trying to say? Are you suggesting... there’s a problem with our goods?" 
"..." 
Even Ou Muyuan looked at her dumbfoundedly, "What do you mean? So, does this counterfeit goods incident stem from the supply source?"
###Chapter 480: Chapter 480 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 4
Ye Ning spread her hands, "I don’t know, I’m just speculating, when we get news from the Huo Family, we’ll know." 
That’s right, everything depends on the message from the Huo Family now. 
If the goods from that Langfang family were indeed the real merchandise of the Huo Family, then by following the vine to find the melon, the real culprit could be found immediately, and Ye Ning had been waiting for this day for a very long time. 
She indifferently picked up the tea from the table, took a sip at her lips, but her eyes glanced towards the woman sitting at the very end of the conference table. 
She was indeed panicking, no longer possessing the calmness and disdain she had before. 
But what surprised her was that although the woman was panicked, she had not shown the expression of someone whose position was utterly lost. Instead, she kept sitting there firmly. 
What was going on? 
Could it be... she had overlooked something? 
A flicker of doubt crossed her eyes! 
As they waited in the conference room, all of a sudden, "Bang," the door to the conference room was kicked open from the outside, "Ou Muyuan? Where’s that bastard Ou Muyuan? Make him come out and see me!" 
It was a roar like that of a lion, and as soon as it thundered through the door, everyone inside stood up in fright, and Ou Muyuan himself was so startled by the roar that he "plop" fell from his chair. 
"Dad... dad, why are you here?" 
"Why am I here? If I don’t come, should I just watch you squander the entire Ou Family?" 
Another thunderous roar shook the very floor! 
Ye Ning also stood up, staring at the old man with his anger cresting, and she couldn’t help feeling a stir of intimidation within her. 
This was indeed a person whose mere silence could instill fear. Back then, at Blue Mountain Villa, whenever he got angry, it really felt like the end of the world was nigh. 
From the master to the servants, the entire villa was filled with terror, afraid they might inadvertently break in the face of his rage. 
Therefore, Ye Ning was very clear about the feeling of the person being roared at, and having seen him fall from the chair, she kindly made way for him to crawl over to his father. noveldrama
,"Listen to my explanation, this... it wasn’t my doing." 
"Not your doing? You are in charge of this company, and now you say it’s not your doing? Then who did it? Was it me? Huh?!!" A cane came down, causing Ou Muyuan, who was kneeling before him, to stagger. 
Ou Yuze, seeing his own father being reprimanded by the senior in front of so many people, felt it hard to watch. With a leap, he stood up from his chair, "Grandfather, my uncle’s people are here too, how can you only blame my father?" 
My uncle’s people?
As soon as these words were spoken, everyone in the conference room turned their gaze to Ye Ning, and the old man at the door, with a fury that seemed uncontainable, also glared this way. 
Ye Ning involuntarily shrank back! 
Although she had not done anything wrong, the deterrence of this elderly man, after having spent a few years in that villa, had seemingly become a natural reaction, like fear. 
Just like his other son, who had virtually no interaction with him, but after coming back and seeing him, always felt inexplicably nervous and afraid, disappointingly so. 
Confronted with that compelling gaze, Ye Ning stiffened up and managed a greeting, "Hello, Chairman, I am the Executive Assistant appointed here by the third young master, my name is An Ning."
###Chapter 481: Chapter 481 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 5
"An Ning? You’re the assistant?" 
"..." 
The assistant? 
He actually knew about this? 
Ye Ning instantly felt a surge of nervousness, "Yes, Chairman, about today’s incident, I only found out after it happened as well, and we’re currently doing everything in our power to investigate it." 
"And the results?" 
"Still waiting..." 
She had only uttered those three words when something was suddenly thrown at the door, and with a crisp "bang," Ye Ning felt a sharp pain on her arm and cheek! 
"I’m telling you, if there’s no result for today’s incident, I won’t let anyone off the hook!" 
With this simple sentence, the conference room fell silent once more. 
What is a fierce and ambitious leader? 
A fierce and ambitious leader is just a person when you don’t provoke him, but the moment you do, his measures are ten times more ruthless than an animal’s, and he might not even recognize kinship. 
Ye Ning was inwardly shocked! 
The old man had arrived so quickly, somewhat beyond her expectations. It seemed she needed to be more careful, or if she slipped up, she wouldn’t be able to get away with it. 
Time passed in silence, and in the eerily quiet conference room, where one could hear a pin drop, the pressure was so great, everyone could hear their own heartbeat. 
This was too frightening!
Ye Ning glanced at her mobile phone, oblivious to the fact that at this moment, in the conference room, the woman sitting at the very end was suddenly looking at the young man next to Ou Muyuan. 
However, to her despair, the man was trembling; she saw his eyes turn pale with fear upon seeing the old man leaning on a cane, as if he had seen something terrifying. 
He was truly so weak! 
Seeing this scene, the hope she had held onto finally plunged into the abyss, and without any hesitation, her fingers swiftly swiped on the phone she was holding, and the next second, taking advantage of the others’ inattention, she tapped on WeChat and sent a message out. 
As soon as the WeChat message was sent, Ye Ning’s phone, which she had been waiting for, also rang. 
Seeing this, everyone’s gaze turned towards it, and Ye Ning immediately answered, "Hello, Mr. Huo..." 
"Miss An, I’ve found out. The goods from Langfang were indeed my batch." 
"Really? Did you ask him how he got the goods?" 
"I did!" 
"What did he say?" 
"He said it was a woman who sold them to him." 
A woman? 
As soon as these words came out, the people in the conference room were all abuzz... 
A woman? 
What woman? Who in their company would dare to intercept the company’s goods? 
All eyes once again focused on the phone, including the old man leaning on the cane. 
Ye Ning was also staring. She had known for a long time whom the person on the phone was referring to; however, she now needed this Mr. Huo to say it personally. Only then could she perfectly complete her plan. 
But what nobody, including Ye Ning herself, expected was that Mr. Huo on the phone eventually said, "He said it was An Ning!" 
"You said what?" 
The surprise came so quickly that Ye Ning couldn’t even react, "You’re saying it was me?" 
Mr. Huo nodded over the phone, "That’s what he said on the phone, that the woman who sold him the goods four days ago was called An Ning. Right, he also sent some receipts and a short video of your transaction at the time. Have a look."noveldrama
###Chapter 482: Chapter 482 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 6
After speaking, he hung up the phone and sent several items to her phone. 
Ye Ning was completely dumbfounded. She had never anticipated that things would turn out this way in the end. 
Her? 
That person from Langfang had said in the end that it was she who made the deal? How could that be possible? 
She stood there, unable to react for a long time, whereas Ou Yuze, sitting next to Ou Muyuan, snatched the phone from her hand as soon as it beeped twice. Soon, he saw the items that Mr. Huo had sent over on her phone. 
"It’s true! Grandfather, look, the evidence is here; it was all done by this bitch!!" 
As soon as he opened the items, he burst into an excited and loud laughter on the spot. 
Indeed, it was enough to drive him frantic. Who would have expected such a sudden and dramatic reversal in the end? 
Everyone in the boardroom was stunned too. After hearing what was said, they fought over the phone to see for themselves, and when they saw the content, confirming that it involved the woman in the room representing the Third Young Master, their expressions all turned to anger. 
And that woman named Yang Xueshan stood up immediately after witnessing this scene.
"That’s right, and I’ve learned as well that it was she who did it. She’s the Third Young Master’s person. The Third Young Master has always wanted our Longfeng. Now that he has finally obtained 50%, naturally he wants all the shares. So, he sent this woman to disrupt Longfeng, to make the chairman believe that we, the Ous, are mismanaging it, and then hand it all over to him!" 
This statement was bold indeed. As soon as it fell, the old man standing in the middle of the boardroom was finally completely enraged! 
"Seize her for me!" 
"Yes, Old Master!" 
At his command, two burly men immediately approached from behind him to grab Ye Ning. 
Having never seen such a scene, Ye Ning was scared and stepped back repeatedly. 
"Old Master, please calm down first—" 
Ying Hao had not expected things to take such a sudden turn for the worse. Seeing those two men going to grab her, he was shocked and immediately wanted to protect this woman. noveldrama
But the men the old master had brought were from the Ou Family’s Shadow Guard Squad, and before Ying Hao could make a move, they quickly stepped forward, blocking him and seizing the woman’s slender arms! 
"Old Master!!" 
"Ying Hao, I’m telling you, you better not meddle in this today, or else I’ll take you down as well!" the old man shouted furiously, grabbing the woman and attempting to leave. 
Ying Hao’s complexion went completely pale upon hearing this. He turned around, just about to make a phone call to his boss. 
But just then, the door of the boardroom was suddenly kicked open from the outside with a "bang". 
Another chilling figure appeared, wearing a dark blue shirt with a casual black blazer thrown over it, revealing a cold, gleaming metal buckle on the belt around his waist. His legs were straight, his aura was frosty. As soon as he showed up there, his gaze looked past everyone and fixed directly on the old man in the room. 
"Where do you think you’re taking her?" 
"..." 
Oh my god! 
Who was this? The Third Young Master of the Ou Family? 
Upon seeing this person, everyone was shocked to the core. They all stood up from their chairs, staring at the young master who had appeared and dared to directly confront the supreme elder at the entrance. They were so astonished they couldn’t even close their mouths. 
The Third Young Master of the Ou Family had actually come as well!!
###Chapter 483: Chapter 483 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 7
The Third Young Master of the Ou Family was, in Longfeng, nothing more than a legend. 
Legend had it, he was the old master’s favorite son and also, it was said, the one with the highest status in the Ou Family. Those of the Ou Family in Longfeng hardly counted at all. 
But legends were just legends, and they didn’t quite believe them, because all of the Ou Family members, after meeting their boss, would inevitably conclude— 
Descendants of prestigious families, live life on thin ice! 
But now, this Third Young Master of the Ou Family they had only seen in media reports had refreshed their views on the status of the Ou Family members. 
"..." 
"Where do you think I’m bringing her? Of course, I’m taking her to the police station." 
The old master had never expected that, at this moment, this brat would suddenly appear, and in astonishment, he blurted out this very sentence. 
No sooner had he finished speaking than this brat, blocking him face to face, retorted without hesitation! 
"On what grounds are you taking her to the police station when you haven’t even clarified the situation?" 
"On what grounds? I’m the chairman of this company, can’t I take an employee to the police station? Ridiculous! How have I not made things clear? The evidence is right here, it’s as clear as day, and you’re saying I haven’t clarified things?" 
The old man was so angry he was jumping up and down! 
But this unfilial son, after just glaring at him, once again spoke coldly, "What evidence do you have to prove it’s as clear as day? Did you even take a close look at that thing? Or was it checked by anyone? Do you handle things without using your brain?" 
"You—" 
!!!! 
This conversation was really... 
In the meeting room, which was as silent as death, everyone was so anxious they didn’t dare to breathe a word, even Ye Ning stared dumbfounded at the two men. 
This was the first time she’d ever seen such an explosive exchange between father and son, a scene she had never witnessed before at Blue Mountain Villa. 
Heavens! 
She understood the rules of Blue Mountain Villa. Although the third young master was greatly favored by the old master, he was well-educated from a young age and rarely conflicted with his father. noveldrama
But now, seeing him being so aggressive, it was as if he was a completely different person. 
What was he doing? Didn’t he know this would infuriate his father? 
Ye Ning started to worry... 
But the fact was, the old man, who had just appeared murderously in the meeting room, turned red-faced after being scolded by the unfilial thing, and miraculously, he held back. 
"Fine, then you tell me, what the hell is going on here?" 
Ou Mucen sneered, "I don’t know what’s going on, but I do know that I have zero interest in your eldest son and Longfeng. If you truly believe that this was done because I wanted to take over all of Longfeng and instructed her to carry out these actions, then by all means send her to the police station." 
"You..." 
"Right, while you’re at it, take me in too since I’m apparently the mastermind!" Having said that, the man didn’t even glance at him as he casually walked in through the doorway with hands shoved in his pockets. 
That was also a murderous look! 
A murderous intent that he had to avoid the old man to contain. 
Approaching, were Ou Yuze and Yang Xueshan standing there; upon seeing them, he immediately had a cold glare in his eyes. 
"The whole lot of you seem to be gathered today." 
"..." 
Ou Mucen’s face suddenly turned sour, and he stood there stammering for a good while before saying sheepishly, "Well, you weren’t coming, were you? The company was short-staffed." 
"Blame me? Thanks to your son, I haven’t even been discharged from the hospital yet!" 
This man’s tongue was truly venomous! 
PS: Will continue tomorrow morning, three Chapters left...
###Chapter 484: Chapter 484 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 8
Ou Muyuan’s face immediately turned even redder, and Ou Yuze clenched his fist tightly but dared not utter another word! 
This was his Achilles’ heel, the accusation of murdering his own uncle. No matter how much of a stir he caused outside, as soon as this was mentioned, he could only be as docile as pickled vegetables, especially in front of the old man, it was even worse. 
Thus, the Ou family, including that woman named Yang Xueshan, all fell silent and didn’t dare to say anything more. 
Ou Mucen saw this and a smirk crept onto his lips. He walked over, casually pulled out a chair to sit down, and nonchalantly placed his legs high up on the conference table. His posture was not that of a man being questioned as the mastermind behind the scenes, but rather like a lord waiting for the whole room to give him an explanation! 
The old man couldn’t take it anymore, turned around, and glowered at his son: "Fine, then you tell me, what should we do?" 
Ou Mucen glanced at his clean fingertips: "I don’t know, whatever you say we should do, we’ll do it. After all, I’m not going anywhere!" 
"You—" 
"How about I take a look?" 
At this critical moment, someone in the meeting room spoke up. When everyone turned their heads, they realized that the person who had spoken was the woman under control. 
An Ning? 
She wanted to see the video? 
Yang Xueshan looked up and saw her, immediately speaking sharply: "You want to see the evidence of your crime, isn’t that like setting a fox to keep the geese?" 
"That’s true, so let’s do this, let’s call the police and let them investigate. That would be the best solution." She spoke as if she had an epiphany, her expression as if she was truly reminded by Xueshan’s words. 
Yang Xueshan was instantly at a loss for words! 
Her face turned green, then red, then white, as if it were a big dye workshop, truly a sight to see. 
Call the police? 
Wasn’t that seeking her own doom? If it was discovered, what awaited her wouldn’t just be utter disgrace, but the complete end of her life. 
She finally fell silent, and her hands clutched the smartphone so tightly that her fingers turned pale to the extreme... 
That was panic! 
A panic of someone on the verge of a precipice! 
Ou Mucen noticed her expression, said nothing, but the corners of his mouth curled into a mocking sneer, and he picked up some magazines from the table and began to flip through them nonchalantly. 
It was said that five years ago, this woman named Yang Xueshan had a complicated relationship with Ou Yuze, and also, she reportedly came from the same orphanage. 
Today he would see, after five years, which of these two women would come out on top. 
— 
Ye Ning finally got hold of her phone. 
As the people in the meeting room said, the receipts and videos received on this phone all pointed the finger at her, particularly the video. Although the quality wasn’t very clear, the figure dealing with the Langfang businessman, whether it was the clothing or the figure, was exactly like her. 
The habit she had of stroking her hair was also captured very clearly in it. 
It was bizarre! 
How could this be? 
She stared at the video, once again falling into a state of confusion. 
The old man beside her, seeing her like this, became angry again: "Look at her, she’s got nothing to say now. Is this not evidence? Am I blind?" 
He started to roar once more! 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
He gripped the magazine in his hand, about to speak, but at that moment, the woman suddenly said, "Ying Hao, go get Mr. Huo to bring over that person’s mobile number and WeChat ID. Let’s check all the calls and files he’s recently received."noveldrama
###Chapter 485: Chapter 485 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 9
"..." 
The moment these words were spoken, not only did the woman in the conference room turn deathly pale, but even Ou Mucen, who was just about to speak, hesitated for a moment. 
Track the mobile number and WeChat? 
Right! 
What a clever idea! 
He turned back, still appearing unconcerned as he read his magazine, only now his eyes, which had been tense just moments before, seemed much more relaxed. 
Ying Hao immediately went to do it, but the old man didn’t understand, "Why do you want to check this?" 
Ye Ning hurriedly replied with a smile, "Chairman, no matter how I deny it at this point, you won’t believe me. It’s better to check the person’s phone. If I really had dealings with him, there must have been some contact." 
"Who knows if you were using your own phone?" 
"Then we’ll call each one, until we can confirm it’s me!" Ye Ning turned and looked at the woman who was trying to find flaws in her every word, with a distinct coldness in her eyes. 
Want to play with me? 
Fine, I’ll play along to the end! 
Soon, Ying Hao got the phone number of the person from Langfang, and in front of so many people, Ye Ning called over the company’s network administrator and hacker. There, in the conference room, everyone saw all the call records and the messages and photos received on that mobile number. 
To everyone’s shock, this phone had very recently received a message from an anonymous number, sending a text that consisted only of one word: "OK!" 
OK? 
Ye Ning stared at the word and suddenly laughed, "Do you see? This message was sent just as we were having our meeting. I checked, and it was exactly when we were waiting for Mr. Huo’s call." 
"And then?" 
"Then, the most likely scenario is that when we were about to find out the truth, suddenly someone interfered, and in the end, it appeared to be me!" 
"This..." 
This sounded like a tall tale. How could that be possible? 
The crowd expressed their doubt, and the woman, in her panic, blurted out, "These are all your speculations. You have no evidence. What reason do you have to say you’ve been framed by someone else?" 
Without evidence? 
Ye Ning stared at her panicked face, her smile deepening, "Manager Yang, don’t worry, I certainly have evidence for you. Ying Hao, make a call to the telecommunications bureau and ask them to help trace the IP of this anonymous call!" 
"Sure thing, Miss An!" 
Another bombshell was dropped, and this time, the two in the conference room were completely paralyzed... 
Trace the IP? 
How had she not thought of that? Yes, her number was anonymous, but the outgoing IP wouldn’t change, so once it was traced, there would be no escape for her. 
She finally began to panic. In her fear, she even naively thought about turning off her phone and then trying to throw it away. 
However, before she even started, a figure suddenly approached her swiftly. Without giving her time to react, they snatched her phone away harshly, "Manager Yang, what are you doing? Turning off your phone?" 
"I... I wasn’t, I was just... checking to see if anyone was looking for me?" noveldrama
"Really? Well then, I’ll help you check!" 
After saying that, she swiftly unlocked the screen and, before anyone could react, accurately and quickly found the message that Manager Yang had sent out not long ago.
###Chapter 486: Chapter 486 Who Dares to Touch His Woman? 10
Don’t ask her how she knew. noveldrama
Because she had once done the same thing in an attempt to kill her! 
Once she found the information, the woman holding the phone raised it and smiled at her, "Yang Xueshan, so it was really you who was the troublemaker!" 
"..." 
Standing there, that woman was stunned for a good five seconds before lunging at her like a maniac, "No, it wasn’t me, I didn’t do it, these are all your slanders!" 
Ye Ning was caught off guard, and, suddenly assailed, she kept stepping back until she was about to fall. Then, from behind, a strong and firm hand reached out to her. 
With that single pull, she was whisked away, while the other woman, missing her target, slammed her head violently onto the conference table, screaming miserably! 
"Ah—" 
Ye Ning watched this scene blankly and, after a while, turned toward the man behind her, "Third Young Master..." 
"Are you a pig? Don’t you know that a mad dog will bite?" 
"Ah?" 
"Are you done?" 
"..." 
His words jumped too quickly; she could hardly keep up with the pace. 
But she did understand the last sentence, so she blinked with the phone in hand, "Almost there..." 
The man immediately became displeased, "Then hurry up, I still need to go back for an injection." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
She glanced around and saw that everyone in the conference room was staring at them, their eyes nearly popping out. She quickly struggled out of his embrace and handed the phone to the grim-faced old man. 
"Chairman, here’s the evidence: the incriminating message was sent by her. With this, we can hand her over to the police. I trust that with the police’s capability, she will confess soon." 
"..." 
In the end, she was still going to hand her over to the police! 
She was truly ruthless, ten times more so than he had imagined, but considering what she had been through, it wasn’t excessive at all. If it had been him, he probably would have made that woman beg for death long ago. 
He walked out to wait for her outside. 
Once he left, the old man in the conference room, having taken the phone, pulled out a gun from his body, "Hand her to the police? I’ll shoot her right now!" 
Ah!! 
The people in the conference room were so frightened they hugged their heads and hid to the side, while Ou Yuze, shuddering violently, took cover behind his father. 
The Ou Family patriarch was truly someone who would kill on a whim! 
Yang Xueshan was also scared; staring at the dark muzzle, she crawled desperately towards the man, "Yu Ze, Yu Ze save me." 
That’s right, at this moment, the only one who could save her was this young master of the Ou Family. 
But the man, who she had been with for five whole years, not only did not rescue her when she crawled towards him, but brutally kicked her away instead. 
"You lowly creature, how dare you come to me after doing such a thing? It’s my fault for not seeing your true colors. I can’t believe I ever befriended someone as hideous as you. Grandfather, you don’t have to do it, I’ll take care of her personally!" 
After saying that, he somehow produced a dagger and viciously stabbed it towards the woman on the floor. 
Ye Ning, watching from the side, for some reason, suddenly grabbed the water cup in front of her and hurled it hard at the brute’s hand, "Stop!!" 
Ps: Regarding updates, please don’t rush me. I just launched, and I am trying to adjust, hoping to write more at once. Please be understanding...
###Chapter 487: Chapter 487: Want to know the man that night? 1
A cup smashed down, and the dagger that was originally aimed at her back, as a result of the blow, deviated slightly and stabbed into the woman’s shoulder. 
"Ah—" 
In an instant, after the dagger plunged in, a woman’s shrill scream echoed throughout the conference room, and bright red blood gushed out from her arm. 
This was indeed a shocking scene! 
Everyone turned pale at the sight, immediately retreating several steps, huddling there, daring not to move anymore. noveldrama
Even Ou Mucen, who had gone outside, hurried back upon hearing the scream. 
What was happening here? 
Was this an attempt to silence someone by murder? 
At the doorway, he saw the woman lying on the ground bleeding profusely, and a man crouched in front of her, clutching the bloody dagger in his hand, his eyes suddenly became extremely severe. 
Time seemed to stop, and the air appeared to freeze. At that moment, everyone’s gaze was fixed on this scene. 
Ye Ning was also staring, but her emotions were not like those of the onlookers around her. The surrounding people were shocked and astounded due to fear, panic, and surprise. 
But the reason she stared was that she had not expected to witness such a scene unfold at the end? Weren’t they deeply in love? 
Back then, in order to be together, they had laid out a grand scheme to send her to prison, and this woman, at the moment of her triumph, had even run to the courthouse to gloat over her, proclaiming her victory of winning him over. 
So why, at this critical moment, was this man not choosing to save her but instead trying to kill her? What about all that love? What about his proclaimed love for her? 
She heard her own heart emitting a cold laugh, and seeing that woman who grew up with her from childhood, who had ultimately betrayed her, she suddenly couldn’t control herself and laughed out loud in the meeting hall, "What a retribution!" 
"What did you say?" 
"Isn’t it the case? This woman, she followed you for so many years, slaved away for you, doing all the dirty work, and in the end, you repay her with a stab. Master Sun, you really are quite righteous." 
She walked over step by step, and upon reaching the two of them, she stood there, looking down at the man with a superior gaze. 
It was a look colder than ice, her chilling gaze fixed on him and the relentless stare probing the bottom of his heart. Like a searchlight, it seemed to strip away the ugliness inside him and display it for everyone to see. 
This man was indeed a beast! 
No, he was worse than a beast; even if you raise a cat or dog for many years, you would be reluctant to let them go, but what about him? 
The moment he saw this woman in trouble, a threat to him, he did not hesitate to kill her, a cruelty not even a beast could manage. 
Ou Yuze, furious with shame and anger, seeing her standing in front of him, constantly staring at his hand that still hadn’t released the dagger, immediately relaxed his grip and stood up, "What nonsense are you spouting? She’s the culprit who framed the company. How could I let her go? Don’t forget, you were the one who found her out." 
"Yes, I found her out, but did I tell you to kill her? She’s just a manager; what capacity does she have to tamper with such a big lot of the company’s goods? 3 billion in funds, is that something she could produce?"
###Chapter 488: Chapter 488: Want to Know About the Man That Night? 2
"What did you say? Say it again?" 
"Even if I say it ten thousand times, the fact remains the same, Young Master Sun. Just now, she accused me of framing the company in order to help the third young master obtain Longfeng. So now, whom is she framing the company for? She has been with you for so many years, you can’t tell me you know nothing at all!" 
Ye Ning glared at the man, rebutting him word by word. Her clear articulation and impeccable logic were truly frightening to anyone who heard them. 
Yes, what she wanted today wasn’t just this woman’s downfall—she wanted this man, who was worse than a beast! 
The crowd, upon hearing this, were completely dumbfounded. Even Ou Muyuan, who had been clueless about the whole matter from the beginning, stared blankly at his son, his mind going blank. 
No, it couldn’t be! 
He wouldn’t do such a thing. Wasn’t the lesson from last time severe enough? No, it just couldn’t be. 
Only the woman lying on the ground, soaked in a pool of blood, upon hearing Ye Ning’s words, suddenly raised her deathly pale head and, like a lunatic, started to laugh in the air, "Hahaha... Ou Yuze, even you have met your match today? After so many years of unscrupulous deeds and heartless acts, today you fall at the hands of a woman?" 
"What did you say? Say it one more time? Do you believe I will kill you right now?" 
He, hearing that shrill mockery, rushed over intending to pull the dagger from the woman’s back and end her life once and for all. 
But at that moment, the woman standing in front of him, small in stature and barely reaching his shoulder, suddenly grabbed his collar and slapped him fiercely across the face! 
You beast!! 
It was a slap delivered with all her strength, carrying five years of hatred and fury of the moment. Immediately, the man’s fair face showed the imprint of five fingers raised in relief. 
After the slap, gritting her teeth, she asked, "Do you still want to silence her by murder?" 
"..." 
Everyone was stunned! noveldrama
Had this woman gone mad? To dare to strike the young master of the Ou Family; even if he was at fault, he was still one of the Ou Family. Did she have a death wish? 
In an instant, not only were the people in the meeting room taken aback, but even Ou Muyuan, as well as the old master of the Ou Family, who was leaning on a cane, also opened their mouths in shock at the sight of this woman. 
The only exception was the man standing at the door! 
When he saw her deliver that slap, the corner of his eye twitched... 
This woman, she’s so vicious? 
After twitching, seeing her hand drop and tremble slightly, his eyes narrowed. 
To make a hand tremble like that, how much strength did she use? This man, she hit him, not because he was trying to kill and silence someone, but for some other reason? 
Suddenly he remembered the investigation report Secretary Gao had given him earlier, which stated that the adopted daughter of the second branch of the Ou Family was often taken by the young master of the second branch to various auction events, and at the time, their relationship was also very close. 
Close? 
The word popped into his mind, he stared for a moment longer, and finally, without looking any further, turned and left again. 
If he remembered correctly, when she entered Blue Mountain Villa, she was only 14 years old. A girl of 14, although still very young, was already a teenage girl in puberty. So, what kind of years had she spent in Chrysanthemum Garden then?
###Chapter 489: Chapter 489: Want to know the man that night? 3
He suddenly felt uncomfortable inside and, upon leaving the room, didn’t go anywhere in particular but simply took out a cigarette to light up before heading down to his car. 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning was still unaware that some of her actions had been exposed to someone’s watchful eyes. After she finished speaking, everyone in the meeting room stared at her, and she moved her burning hand slightly, finally beginning to come back to her senses. 
What had happened to her? 
Why had she suddenly lost control? Was it because she was too angry? 
She swallowed hard, looked around, and finally, slowly, released the hand that had been holding him captive: "If you’re innocent, then you had no need to kill her. Your desire to kill her proves you have a guilty conscience." 
"You!!" 
Ou Yuze finally reacted. Hearing her words, he reached out to grab her, intending to strangle her in his humiliation. 
At the critical moment, the old master, who had already seen the whole incident unfold, finally spoke up: "Stop!" 
As the words fell, the man in front of Ye Ning, whose eyes were already filled with malice, froze as if he was struck by a paralyzing point and dared not move anymore. 
"Grandfather..."
"It seems I was too lenient with you. I thought giving you a chance would make you better yourself, but instead, you came here and caused more trouble, even bringing the company to the brink of collapse. What use is there for someone like you in this world? Take him away!" 
"Yes, Elder!" 
"No, Grandfather, I was wrong, I know my mistake, Grandfather, I won’t do it again, Grandfather..." 
"..." 
With a hysterical wail, the young master of the Ou Family, who had dominated the company for years, was dragged away like a dead dog. 
And Ou Muyuan, in the face of this scenario, had no solution whatsoever. 
With Ou Yuze taken away, the meeting room fell silent. Following the old master’s wishes, since Yang Xueshan was not dead, she was to be thrown into jail for the police to arrest and punish her according to standard procedures. 
And in this, she resembled the Ye Ning of years past, except that Ye Ning had been framed, whereas she had ensnared herself. 
Seeing the paramedics from the hospital arrive, Ye Ning stepped aside to let them place the woman on the stretcher, ready to leave. 
However, just as she was about to leave, the woman on the stretcher suddenly called out to her retreating figure: "Ye Ning, are you satisfied with this outcome now?" 
"..." 
As the words landed, Ye Ning, who was about to step out the door, froze in place! 
Ye Ning? 
Was she calling her by her real name? Then she... noveldrama
"I know you are Ye Ning. Even though your appearance and name have changed, I know it’s you. Your aura, your methods, your knowledge of jade, these are things only she would have. There’s no need to deny it." 
Seeing her silent, the woman on the stretcher added that. 
Ye Ning stood there for a good while and finally turned her head, her gaze cold as she looked at the woman: "I don’t know what you’re talking about. You’d better go to the hospital, or you won’t even know if you’re dead." 
Having said this, she intended to leave. 
Seeing this, Yang Xueshan became anxious: "No need to deny it. I won’t tell anyone about this. Things have come to this point, speaking out won’t benefit me at all. I don’t need to bother."
###Chapter 490: Chapter 490: Want to know the man that night? 4
She really is direct, just like herself, always only seeing the side most advantageous to her. 
Ye Ning came to a halt again, but she didn’t speak or turn around, instead just stood there, as though she wanted to hear what she had to say. 
Seeing this, Yang Xueshan started speaking slowly from behind, "Actually, I should have realized much earlier that it was you. In this world, no one else could set up such a big trap for me to fall into." 
"That’s because you’re stupid!" 
"Yes, I am indeed stupid. Compared to you, you were always smarter. The reason I beat you back then was entirely because you had not been guarding against me." She actually openly admitted that she was not as good as her. 
Ye Ning sneered coldly, her heart hard as stone, feeling not the slightest bit of relief. 
Yang Xueshan saw her reaction and the corners of her mouth tugged into a smile, "Are you really happy now to see my downfall? The man I struggled so hard to take from you back then is now treating me this way." 
Finally, Ye Ning laughed, turning around to face her. For the first time in five years, she looked at her seriously, "You’re right, I am indeed very happy now seeing you like this, especially at the moment of his killing—I can’t tell you how thrilling it was." 
"..." 
Staring at her, Yang Xueshan looked for a long, long time, her gaze never once leaving her face. 
This indeed was a stranger’s face, but those eyes, still exactly the same as before, with pupils the color of glazed glass, clear and lucid, just like that girl from years ago. 
What was different now, though, was that when those beautiful eyes used to look at her, they were always filled with warmth and trust. She’d cling to her, and in those pupils, was the reflection of her elder sister. 
She’d say, "Sister Xueshan, we’ll always be together in the future, right?" 
She’d also say, "Sister, if you’re adopted, will you take me with you?" 
She’d say, "..." 
She said so much, so much that Ye Ning had almost forgotten in these five years, but now, seeing her, it all rushed back like a tide. 
It turned out that in the past five years, she hadn’t really forgotten, but had sealed away the evil deeds she had done and her extinguished conscience deep in her memory. For her own glory and wealth, so she could live with a clean conscience, she had locked it all away. 
Yang Xueshan looked at the eyes now staring at her filled with nothing but hatred, mockery, and coldness, and finally, she too started to laugh, "Is this retribution? I made you end up like this back then, and now it’s my turn, with the same fate as yours." 
"No, you’re different from me. I’m still standing in front of you right now, but haven’t you noticed? From the moment things went down to now, there hasn’t been a single person by your side, Yang Xueshan. You don’t deserve the same fate as me." noveldrama
"What?" 
"Take good care of your injuries. The conditions in prison aren’t so good; if you’re not well recovered, it won’t be easy enduring the years ahead." With that final remark, she turned and left. 
Seeing this, Yang Xueshan suddenly raised her head high from the stretcher, "Don’t you want to know who entered your room that night? Now you’re a single mother, could that child be his? Don’t you want to know who he is?" 
With those words, the figure who had almost stepped out of the door, stopped once again. 
And this time, the stop was more abrupt, almost coming to a sudden halt!
###Chapter 491: Chapter 491: Want to know who the man was that night? 5
The child’s father? 
That’s right, only she knew about that matter at the time. She had already said in court that she had arranged the whole thing herself, so apart from her, who else could possibly know? 
Ye Ning’s heart skipped a beat violently, and finally, she stormed back like a madwoman, "Speak up, who on earth is it?!" 
For five whole years, she had been dreaming of finding out who the man was that night, not for anything else, but to give her child a father. 
However, seeing her return, the woman lied there and laughed like a lunatic, "You actually still want to know? I thought that after serving five years in prison, all you wanted was revenge and nothing else." 
"I can also take your life!" She directly pressed her hand onto the woman’s bloody wound, causing her to tremble in pain. 
Trying to blackmail her? 
Fine, she’s ruthless, but she’s even more so! 
The torture was too much to bear, and finally, the woman’s face went deathly pale, dripping with sweat as she started talking, "Fine, I’ll tell you, but you have to promise me one condition." 
"You want to negotiate terms with me?" 
Ye Ning, completely infuriated, felt as if this woman was courting death right in front of her. 
Yet, surprisingly, this woman who had always been afraid of death, upon hearing the murderous intent in Ye Ning’s voice, showed no fear. On the contrary, she lifted her pallid face and smiled, "Don’t worry, it won’t be difficult for you. I just want to kill that man with my own hands!" noveldrama
Ye Ning was taken aback, "Kill who?" 
"Who else could it be? Naturally, the unfeeling beast that abandoned me. Ye Ning, I was with him for five years, for his sake I’ve lost everything. Now I’m even facing prison. I cannot accept this. Even if I am to die, I want to drag him down with me!" 
She said each word deliberately, the blood-red look and murderous aura in her eyes startling Ye Ning. 
She wanted to kill him? 
Just because he had discarded her and at the last moment, even wanted to silence her? Wasn’t it all a consequence of her own making back then?
Ye Ning watched her as if looking at a joke, "You, kill him? Let me tell you, even if Ou Yuze is no longer a part of the Ou Family, he still has many people on the outside. You want to kill him, you better wake up." 
"That’s none of your business. I have my own ways. All I need from you is help to escape from the hospital, then I’ll tell you who entered your room that night." 
"..." 
Staring at her intently, Ye Ning took a long look before finally narrowing her eyes slightly and straightening up from beside her. 
Fine, if she wants to die, then she’ll facilitate that. After all, whether she is dead or alive, it has nothing to do with her. 
So, in the end, she agreed, "Fine, in three days, I will help you escape from the hospital, and at that moment, you must immediately tell me who the man was that night. Otherwise, you don’t have to go looking for Ou Yuze, I will notify him to find you. I do what I say!" 
Yang Xueshan paused! 
She wanted to say more, but at that moment, the woman had already turned around and left through the doorway... 
She was right, their relationship had ended five years ago when she had betrayed and entrapped her. Since she was seeking death, she certainly wouldn’t stop her. All she wanted was to know what she desired. 
The man that night... 
When she left the conference room, these few words kept echoing in her mind.
###Chapter 492: Chapter 491: Want to know the man who slept with you that night? 6
Five years, and still, the incident lingered in her mind like a thorn sealed deep within her psyche. She strived to stop thinking about him, to forget that night, but today, when that woman mentioned it, she realized how vividly she remembered that night from five years ago. noveldrama
She remembered wearing that black, provocative nightgown that night, the one given to her by Yang Xueshan, who had also advised her that since it was a boy’s first time inviting her to a room, she should look beautiful, and more enticing. 
So, that night, after she arrived in the room, she took a bath and put the garment on. 
Once she had it on, she didn’t dare look at her reflection in the mirror. Following the instructions of that woman, she lit the incense she had brought with her, turned off the room’s lights, leaving only the misty fragrance lamp on, and lay down on the bed. 
Later, the man entered the room. Because the lights were off and the incense made the room hazy, she hadn’t had a chance to see him clearly when she saw his tall figure lunging towards her. 
After the man pounced, what followed was like a small boat drifting in the sea; she couldn’t remember how things had happened. 
Throughout the process, she had always thought it was Ou Yuze, so much so that she endured without making a sound when he forcefully took what he wanted from her. 
But in the end, she realized it was all a cruel joke. 
As she dwelt on this, she found herself trembling slightly, which made her legs, already descending the stairs, seem to suddenly lose strength. She clung to the banister and slowly slid down until she ended up sitting on the steps. 
Eventually, she just sat down on a step. 
It truly felt as if the life had been drained from her. Yang Xueshan said she hated, that she couldn’t accept it, she felt her life, her youth, had been destroyed by that man; but what about her—her life, her youth, who would pay for that? 
Convicted at 18, forced into motherhood at 19—what had she done wrong to be framed like this? 
Sitting there and thinking of these things, years of suppressed sorrow flooded her like a tide. The discomfort, the agony was so overwhelming that she could no longer contain it and began to sob, covering her face with her hands as she sat there. 
—— 
Ou Mucen had been waiting in the car downstairs. Seeing that corporate executives and the father and son, Ou Yuze, along with the old man, had left the building, but the woman hadn’t come down, he finally lost patience and got out of the car again. 
"Young Master..." 
"Has everyone left upstairs?" 
"Yes, they’re all gone." 
"What about Assistant An?" 
"Haven’t seen him. Perhaps he left early?" The person being asked was just a junior employee without the privilege to go up to the 11th floor; hearing the question, he could only reply with this.
###Chapter 493: Chapter 493: Want to know who the man was that night? 7
Ou Mucen’s brows furrowed as he glanced at the elevator and, noting that the indicator light was still on the first floor, decided to enter and directly pressed the button to go up to the 11th floor. 
A minute later, 11th floor— 
"Did you see An’s assistant?" 
"No, didn’t she go out?" 
"Which direction did she go?" 
"It seems..." The cleaner, who was tidying up the conference room, looked outside then decisively pointed towards the direction of the staircase. 
That girl must be there, right? When she went up earlier, it seemed like she saw her sitting there. She called out a few times, but she didn’t even respond to her. 
Ou Mucen saw this and so he walked over to that direction, and there, in the stairwell, he saw the woman sitting on the steps, leaning against the railing. 
She was very thin; from his angle looking down, he seriously wondered if his entire hand could encircle her. 
Her hair was messy, a result of the intense conflict in the conference room just before. She wore a black fitted blazer with a pure white shirt underneath. From his angle, looking down at her now, her head was drooped low against the railing, the white shirt’s back collar revealing her slender neck, which appeared like a tree branch battered by a storm. Looking at her, one could feel her sorrow. 
So, what was she doing? Sitting here alone, wallowing in sadness? 
Why would she be sad? She had just avenged a great wrong today; why would she be sad? Was it a case of extreme joy bringing on sorrow? 
He walked down step by step, and upon reaching her, didn’t call out to her, but simply stood next to her, looking towards the bustling city not far away, "What’s the matter? Are you feeling guilty?" 
Ah? 
Ye Ning, who was leaning there trying to calm her emotions, suddenly heard this and was taken aback, quickly turning to the side, "Why did you come?" 
Ou Mucen gave her a cold glance, "I came to see if you’ve been bitten by a mad dog again? After all, there aren’t many people as stupid as you in this world." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Sitting there, she looked up at him for a while, and then suddenly, looking at his handsome face bathed in bright light, she asked, "Ou Mucen, why did you come today? Did you come to help me?" 
"No!" He threw out these two words without hesitation. 
Ye Ning felt her heart drop into a ditch, "Then why did you come?" 
"What do you think I came for? The company is about to go under, am I supposed to watch my money go down the drain?" After speaking, the man didn’t even look at her, simply turning and walking away. 
Ye Ning was choked with frustration! 
His reason was so righteous... she couldn’t counter it at all. 
Yes, the company was going under, and him being another shareholder, wasn’t it normal for him to come over? It was billions on the line, after all. noveldrama
But why did he use the word "under"? It sounded so odd... 
Ye Ning got up from the ground and hurried after his retreating figure, "Did you know about this before you came?" 
"I didn’t!" 
"You didn’t know and you still came? Weren’t you afraid that I was really the chief culprit, and then I’d drag you down with me?" 
"..." 
With that said, all was silent in front, and as Ye Ning was following with her head down, she suddenly realized it was quiet and looked up... 
Bang!! 
"Ah! Jerk, couldn’t you have said something before stopping?" Ye Ning clutched her nose, which was hit so hard she was nearly in tears, stompimg her foot in anger.
###Chapter 494: Chapter 494: Want to know who the man was that night? 8
It was at this moment that the man finally turned around, and then he stood there in the corridor, his back to the golden light, and looked at her expressionlessly, "Would you do that?" 
"What?" 
"Drag me down with you and have me join your funeral, would you?" 
"..." 
As if turned foolish, Ye Ning stared at the man for a long time without uttering a word... 
What did he mean? Did he think that today’s incident was orchestrated by her? 
No, not just think, but in his heart, he must have already believed it to be so. 
Because he knew about her plan and her goal, so naturally, he would attribute today’s issue at Longfeng to her without a second thought. 
Her heart sank bit by bit, and simultaneously, the blood drained slowly from her face. 
She knew it would be like this. Yes, when she was returning home yesterday, she had predicted this outcome, and that was the reason she went to Longfeng in the middle of the night to choose those jade artifacts. 
But what use was that? The incident still erupted this morning, didn’t it? 
She heard the voice of despair from the bottom of her heart, and her fingers began to tremble slightly: "Are you asking me?" 
"Am I supposed to ask myself?" 
He was half-joking, half-serious, his gaze, however, was fixed on her nose. noveldrama
Being this foolish, what would she do in the future? 
He glanced at the watch on his wrist, saw that it was about time, and then he withdrew his gaze: "Let’s go, it’s getting late." 
Then, he turned and continued walking forward, before this, he hadn’t even looked to see her expression. 
This was just a joke, and he had said it casually out of boredom. 
As for her attitude, did he need to ask again? 
He walked very quickly... 
But he didn’t know that behind him, the woman who heard his words seemed as though all the light in the world had vanished, leaving only darkness and despair. 
Indeed, for her now, he had become an indispensable part of her life. Besides Xiaobao, his place in her heart was the heaviest. 
But now, he had misunderstood her, believing she was the person who caused Longfeng’s substantial loss today. Did that mean he would leave her in the future? Because she utilized him once more for revenge, he would never forgive her again? 
As this thought settled, a pain sharp as a thorn appeared at the bottom of her heart. Her figure swayed, and without knowing why, tears dropped from her eyes. 
That must be a kind of desperation, right? 
Because she didn’t want to lose him anymore! 
In pain, she closed her eyes and began stepping back, retreating... 
—— 
Ou Mucen kept walking forward until he reached the elevator and noticed the silence behind him; then he turned and looked back. 
Where was she? 
He stood stunned, looking at the empty corridor behind him, his expression was one of sheer astonishment. 
What was going on? Where on earth did that woman disappear to? 
He quickly returned from the elevator entrance and hurried back: "An Ning? Where are you?" 
No one responded, the only thing giving him an answer was the sound of someone continuously descending the stairs around the corner of the corridor. 
Who was that? Was it that woman? 
He listened, rushed over from that side, and when he arrived, he looked down from above and indeed saw that woman running down the stairs in haste. 
What was she doing? 
Why avoid the elevator and rush down the stairs? 
Subconsciously, he followed and shouted while chasing her: "An Ning, where are you going? Stop for me!"
###Chapter 495: Chapter 495: The Truth! 1
"..." 
But the person below seemed not to hear his calling at all, still running swiftly downwards as if terrified, needing to escape immediately to a safe place. 
What on earth was this woman running from? 
Ou Mucen didn’t understand, but if he knew how lacking in confidence this woman he fancied was in this relationship, perhaps he would have understood her. 
Yes, from the beginning, his unique treatment of her had made her extremely anxious. 
He was a master high above, and she merely an adopted daughter taken in by his family, now also a fugitive on the run. Family background, personal circumstances, these were all stark contrasts. It was normal for her to feel unconfident and insecure. 
Bowing his head, he saw the figure below was about to reach the sixth floor. Finally, he couldn’t help but chase after her. 
He didn’t know what had happened, but seeing her so out of character, he sensed something was wrong and his first thought was to catch up with her immediately. 
However, after chasing down from the eleventh floor and only reaching the seventh, his body, not yet fully recovered, began to struggle, with a faint pain in the wound on his right abdomen, and a fine layer of sweat breaking out on his forehead. 
This damn woman! 
Feeling these discomforts, he had to stop for a moment, looking down over the railing to see the figure almost at the bottom, his brows furrowed deeply. He quickly took out his phone, "Hey, the office building, at the entrance of the first floor stairwell, stop that woman for me!" 
"..." 
On the other end of the phone, Ying Hao didn’t comprehend. 
The entrance of the first floor stairwell of the office building? 
Stop that woman? 
He turned to look behind, "Third Master, I’m in the production department." 
"That’s your problem. If you can’t stop her, you don’t need to work here anymore!" 
"..." 
What was all this mess about? Perfectly fine a moment ago, who’s the bastard that caused trouble again? 
Ying Hao hung up the phone, furious and wanting to curse someone out, but remembering the CEO’s last words, he wiped the sweat from his forehead and dared not linger, dashing out of the office like a madman. 
So here in the office building, just as Ye Ning was about to rush out from the bottom floor, she suddenly saw a man whooshing in front of her to block the way. 
"You..." 
"It’s you!" Upon seeing her, Ying Hao became furious, "Why are you running? Is there a ghost upstairs? Don’t you know the Third Master is still up there?" 
"I..." 
"What do you mean ’I’? Just stand still for me, otherwise, we’re not done!" He strode over, casually gripped the collar of her coat, and just like picking up a chick, pressed her against the corner of the wall. 
"Hello? Third Master, I’ve stopped Assistant Ye. That’s who you wanted me to stop, right?" 
"..." 
Finally caught her? 
That troublesome damn woman! noveldrama
The man who had been waiting on the seventh floor for news sighed with relief upon hearing this. Then he rubbed his right abdomen and slowly took the elevator down from the seventh floor. 
A ruptured spleen isn’t that difficult to recover from; usually, after surgery, a hospital stay of about ten days is enough. 
But his case was different. He had suffered a second hit before the first rupture had healed, which was a significant trauma for that organ, like a wound that hadn’t healed and sustained a new injury, making the healing process much more difficult.
###Chapter 496: Chapter 496: The Truth! 2
So, this was why Ji Chengzhi had always refused to let him leave the hospital. 
Descending in the elevator, sure enough, as soon as the doors opened, he saw the woman at the stairwell being tightly gripped by Ying Hao. At that moment, his unresolved anger surged even more fiercely, "Why are you running? Are you sick or something?" 
He walked over and started cursing right away! 
It wasn’t his fault, her reaction before was truly like that of a madwoman. She ran off without even saying a word. Who knows how worried he had been up there. 
But this woman, after being let go by Ying Hao, saw him and didn’t say a word, instead, she just turned her head with her eyes reddened and looked elsewhere. 
Hah! noveldrama
She thinks she has the right to be mad? 
Ou Mucen waved his hand to dismiss Ying Hao. He was about to say something, but then he glanced at the location, furrowed his brow, and changed his mind. He just grabbed her by the collar and walked off. 
"What are you doing? Let go of me!" 
"Let go? So you can go off and have another episode?" 
"If you do this, they will see!" 
"So what? In a place that belongs to Ou Mucen, I need their permission to do what I want?" His face was ashen as he dragged her outside to the parking lot, then shoved her fiercely into the car. 
They left behind a group of employees at the building with jaws dropping to the floor, their expressions as shocked as could be. 
What had they just witnessed? Was that the third young master of the Ou family? Was he manhandling Assistant An? Why? Could a boss treat their assistant like that? 
Longfeng was once again in a sensation... 
Meanwhile, Ye Ning, who had been forced into the car, didn’t have any chance to resist. The man got in, hit the gas, and soon, the two of them were driving away in the black Bentley, vanishing from the company in a flash. 
It wasn’t until the car was nearly at the city center that Ye Ning, sitting in the passenger seat, saw him press the brake. Finally, the car came to a sudden stop by the green belt at the side of the road. 
"Tell me, why did you run away just now?" 
The moment they stopped, he really did ask this question. 
Ye Ning clenched the seatbelt, her fingers turning frighteningly white. 
Why did she run? Doesn’t he know? 
She bit down hard on her lip, remaining silent! 
Ou Mucen, seeing this, finally lost his patience. Turning to her, he grabbed her hand and pulled her harshly toward him, "Do I really need to handle you harshly before you’ll speak up?" 
As a man, he wasn’t as delicate as a woman. He didn’t guess or think, so when faced with situations like this, apart from being irritable, the only thing left was the most savage way. 
Yet this woman wasn’t afraid of his approach. Upon hearing him say he would handle her harshly, she didn’t get angry but instead, her lips curled into a mocking sneer, "Go ahead, ’handle’ me. Are you planning to send me to the police station like that other woman?" 
"What?" 
"Isn’t that the case? I’m the real mastermind behind this, shouldn’t I be the one going there more?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
He stared at her for at least dozens of seconds while gripping her hand tightly before slowly letting go. 
"So, you ran because I found out you are the real culprit?" 
"Isn’t it? Ou Mucen, I know you’ve been investigating me, and I know you’ve found out who I am. Yes, I admit it, I am that foster daughter of your family from five years ago. I also confess that I masterminded this whole incident. To get my revenge, I used your company as a stepping stone, aiming to completely ruin Ou Yuze and his family. Now that your company is down, my goal has been achieved. Go ahead, arrest me?"
###Chapter 497: Chapter 497: The Truth! 3
She extended her hands, her expression was an unprecedented calm. 
Ou Mucen was stunned for a moment, probably not expecting her to suddenly say such a thing. 
Her identity? noveldrama
He did indeed know it and very clearly at that, but he had never told her that he was investigating her. Yet now she said she knew he was investigating her, which must mean that the man named Lin Yebai told her. 
Right, Lin Yebai was not stupid. If he was able to secretly switch her out of jail back then, it goes without saying that in Ningzhou he must have made meticulous preparations. It was quite normal for him to find out. 
It meant that during this time, regarding the matter of her identity, both of them were fully aware, yet neither had explicitly pointed it out. 
Ou Mucen finally understood why she wanted to run away? He also finally figured out why she had never been willing to come clean with him. 
It turned out she had always been afraid that once he knew about it, he would feel she had used him again and would no longer forgive her. 
This idiot! 
Ou Mucen sat there, hands holding the steering wheel, his gaze quietly shifted to the windshield outside, "So how exactly did you get out?" 
"What?" 
"I mean that ’you’ in jail, what’s the deal with that?" 
"..." 
Ye Ning’s heart suddenly tightened, her gaze turned away to look elsewhere, "No comment!" 
No comment? 
She was actually telling him no comment? 
Hearing these four crisp words, the man in the car, who had not been emotional, immediately became gloomy, "Is it no comment? Or is it to avoid implicating that man called Lin Yebai?" 
"Think whatever you like, but I’ve said what I needed to say. This matter was done by me alone, it has nothing to do with anyone else. If you want to catch someone, catch only me." 
"Say that again?" 
"I could say it ten thousand times, it’s the same. Ou Mucen, if you want to arrest me and send me back to jail, then go ahead. Don’t come to me trying to fish for more words. I, Ye Ning, act alone and take responsibility alone, I absolutely won’t implicate anyone else!" 
She finally burst out. After hysterically shouting these words, she stared at him with eyes that were bright red and filled with tears she was fiercely holding back. 
Ou Mucen froze! 
This was the first time he had seen her lose her temper so greatly, like someone who had completely lost their reason. She stared at him intently, with her chest heaving rapidly, those red eyes were filled with sparking tears. 
It seemed that in the next moment, if he pushed further, those tears would certainly spill out! 
Something pricked the bottom of Ou Mucen’s heart, finally, he averted his gaze forward, "Are you protecting him that much? Aren’t you afraid I’ll get angry?" 
What? 
"It seems you really do need to be taught a lesson!" 
Before she finished speaking, Ye Ning, who was sitting there, suddenly saw the person next to her let go of the steering wheel, and the next second, a shadow loomed over her. Instantly, her breath was overwhelmed by an infinitely magnified handsome face! 
Heaven!!! 
She was suddenly stunned, her widened eyes filled with shock, as if struck by unexpected lightning, a buzzing sound, and then her mind went blank. 
What was he doing? 
At this moment, he was actually... actually kissing her?
###Chapter 498: Chapter 498: The Truth! 4
And the man on her lips, after blocking her breath, seemed to be punishing her for protecting another man just moments before. The crisp taste overwhelmed her mouth, carrying the man’s strong scent, so urgent and so domineering. Without a hint of pity, as soon as he found her sweet fragrance, he ravaged her fiercely. 
You dead woman! 
How dare she protect another man in front of him? Had he been too indulgent with her? Three days without a beating, and she’s forgotten who she is? 
A domineering and fierce onslaught nearly suffocated the woman! 
"Mmm... it hurts..." 
She finally regained a little sense, feeling the pain on her lips, and her small hands tried to push him away. 
But what about the man? 
Enraged, he heard her pain but far from showing restraint, he bit down on the softness entwined with his lips even harder... 
"Ah—" 
With that bite, accompanied by the woman’s cry of pain, a metallic sweetness emerged between their lips and teeth. He stiffened for a moment, then slowly released her, gradually withdrawing from her breath. 
"You... you bit me?" As soon as he let go, she pushed him away furiously and then reached for her lips. 
Ou Mucen saw this but didn’t try to stop her, not until she touched her lips and saw the crimson on her fingertip, her eyes nearly popping out in shock, did he then sit back and say leisurely, "Remember, this is just a warning!" 
"A warning?" 
Ye Ning’s eyes widened, her little face still flushed, full of disbelief. noveldrama
Is he talking about a warning? 
He bit her and had the nerve to call it a warning? How could he be so unreasonable? Did he think she was easy to bully? 
But very soon, when she came to her senses, thinking back to the cause of their quarrel and the words she had spoken before he kissed her forcefully, everything suddenly made sense to her. Instantly, she felt something break inside her, and a rush of emotion engulfed her whole being! 
It was ecstasy! 
An insane joy of regaining what was lost! 
Indeed, she had thought that after telling him everything, what awaited her was the return to darkness, and again, to a him with no connection to her. 
But what she didn’t expect, not in a million years, was what she encountered... 
Having understood, in an instant, she touched her bitten lips, eyes drooping, and the tears she had been holding back finally fell with a "plunk". 
Ou Mucen had started the car, and upon saying those words, she suddenly fell silent and began to cry with her head down, causing him to frown, "Does it really hurt?" 
"It hurts!" The girl cried even harder, tears dripping steadily down her cheeks. 
Ou Mucen was a bit panicked! 
He had never seen a girl cry like this before him. Ordinary women didn’t have the chance, and those close to him, who dared to cry in front of him? 
So, seeing her cry like this, he was a bit at a loss, "Should I put some medicine on it for you?" 
"Do you have medicine?" 
"No!" 
"Then how will you treat it?" 
"..." 
After a pause, suddenly, he bent down to find a band-aid from his car, which God knows what year it was left there, "Use this..." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Without another word, she turned her head, rolled down the window, and lay there, sobbing heartbrokenly... 
This bastard!!
###Chapter 499: Chapter 499: The Truth! 5
Lin Yebai learned about the Longfeng incident at noon. Upon hearing that the second branch of the Ou Family had collapsed and that Ou Yuze had been expelled from the family, severing all ties with the Ous, he held the newspaper and slowly sat down on the sofa. 
That man... he really did it? 
He actually sacrificed tens of billions to play this game for her?!! 
He stared at the large headline on the newspaper about the crisis facing Longfeng, his face turning a terrible shade of ashen grey, his fingers trembling slightly from the disbelief and shock deep within him. 
This is impossible, how could this be possible? 
Little Jingang came in at this moment and was startled to see his expression, "Sir, what’s wrong with you? Why do you look so terrible?" 
Lin Yebai said like a puppet, "Longfeng has collapsed!" 
Is that so! 
Xiaojin, who also came to tell him about this, heard these words and his eyes shone brighter, "Yes, it has collapsed. It’s said that Ou Yuze wanted to oust his uncle from Longfeng and then colluded with his lover Yang Xueshan to tamper with the supply chain. Eventually, it led to Longfeng’s publicly listed jewelry containing a large amount of counterfeit goods, which ruined Longfeng’s reputation overnight." 
"Is that so?" 
"Yes, and when Ou Qichang heard the news, he kicked Ou Yuze out of the Ou Family right away, cutting off all ties. He also took back all of Longfeng from the second branch. Sir, if you look at it that way, Aning’s vendetta has been avenged." 
Ou Qichang was the patriarch of the Ou Family, a highly renowned figure in A City. 
Lin Yebai was silently listening, neither speaking nor moving, his eyes fixated on the newspaper the entire time. 
He of course knew her revenge had been taken, because all of this was her plan. noveldrama
But, he thought she wouldn’t succeed, that eventually she would come looking for him, so he was still here waiting for her. He never ever imagined that man would just hand over tens of billions in assets to fulfill her wish for revenge. 
So, this was the difference between him and that man! 
He finally hugged his head in pain and bent over. 
Xiaojin, watching from the side, was confused, "What’s wrong, sir? Aren’t you happy? Aning’s great vengeance has been avenged; we should be happy for her." 
The man clutching his head forced a smile... 
Happy, why wouldn’t she be happy? 
But why does his heart feel so uncomfortable? When she left with that man from the Qiao Family’s place, he felt distressed and angry, but not like this. The discomfort now felt as if something was truly moving away from him, triggering such panic that even breathing became difficult. 
"Sir?" 
"Do you think it’s possible for her to come back to us?" 
"What?" 
"The one who avenged her this time is that Ou Mucen. He’s helped her so much, would she come back? I’m afraid that as soon as they find out that child is also theirs, they’d get married right away, then live happily ever after." 
He sat there hunched over, one hand propping up his chin, looking like someone afflicted with a neurotic disorder. 
Xiaojin was stunned by his words!
That man helped her? That... That’s hardly possible, right? Longfeng has completely collapsed, hasn’t it? 
But faced with his astonishment and doubt, his sir could only sit on the sofa staring coldly at one spot, laughing bitterly. That laugh seemed like a mockery of himself, so full of failure, so easily defeated.
###Chapter 500: Chapter 500: The Truth! 6
Xiaojin saw it and felt somewhat reluctant to act. Finally, with a firm determination in his heart, he said, "If that’s the case, then there’s no need for them to recognize each other." noveldrama
"What do you mean?" 
"Sir, only you and I know who Xiaobao’s father really is. As long as we make the child’s father someone else, they will never be able to be together." 
Someone else? 
The man sitting on the couch, upon hearing this, finally had a flicker of emotion in his dull gaze and slowly looked at him, "Turn into whom?" 
Xiaojin spelled it out word-by-word, "Ou Yuze!" 
"Ou Yuze?" 
"Yes, after all, the relationship between Ou Yuze and Aning was that of boyfriend and girlfriend. It would be quite normal for this child to be said to be his. As for Ou Mucen, once he finds out that the child is his nephew’s, from a man’s standpoint, he definitely won’t have any more possibilities of getting back together with Aning." 
That’s right, even if Ou Mucen could overlook the woman’s past and not mind that she had a child. 
But the moment he learns that the woman used to be his nephew’s girlfriend, and the child is his nephew’s, then, even with all the generosity in the world, he would not be able to accept it. 
Firstly, it was a matter of seniority, and the second reason was a psychological barrier. 
Indeed, in this world, which uncle would marry his nephew’s woman? Moreover, a woman who has had a child for his nephew. 
Lin Yebai was stunned! 
Perhaps, even he had not thought of this. For a moment, he sat there, silent for a very long time. 
Seeing this, Xiaojin added another comment, "Sir, if you really want to be with Aning, you have to be ruthless. Once she truly marries that man, it will all be too late!" 
Lin Yebai, "..." 
Sitting there, he was like a lonely eagle immersed in darkness, silent for a very long time. Finally, the originally gentle and elegant eyes flashed a hint of ruthlessness, "Fine, bring the Jade Bracelet with you, go find Ou Yuze, and bring him to see me." 
"Okay, sir!" 
Xiaojin was delighted upon hearing his agreement and immediately went to get things done. 
So on this day, Tang Garden, which had been quiet for several days, started bustling again... 
—— 
In the end, Ye Ning still followed Ou Mucen back to the hospital. 
Upon returning to the hospital, since Ji Chengzhi was not present, they hadn’t yet reached the ward when they saw several doctors already waiting there. After asking, they found out that Ji Chengzhi’s sudden departure from the hospital without telling anyone had caused panic at the hospital. 
Seeing this, the two went over... 
"It’s the Third Young Master, the Third Young Master is finally back!" Upon seeing Ou Mucen, the group of doctors indeed became invigorated as if they had been given a shot of adrenaline and all came back to life. 
Ou Mucen paid them no mind and with a step that was both noble and detached, he entered the ward with everyone welcoming him. 
Following behind, Ye Ning observed this scene and the corner of her eye twitched. 
Once inside the ward, the chief physician specifically appointed by Ji Chengzhi before he left immediately came over with concern and asked, "Third Young Master, did you feel uncomfortable anywhere while you were out? Any palpitations or chest tightness?" 
"No!" 
"What about the wound? Does it feel uncomfortable?" 
"Are you annoying? Wouldn’t I say if I felt uncomfortable?" Finally annoyed by the questions, his handsome face darkened, and instantly the temperature in the ward dropped several degrees. 
Everyone saw this and dared not ask any further questions, standing there trembling, almost unable to hold on.
###Chapter 501: Chapter 501: The Truth! 7
Ye Ning couldn’t stand it any longer. Seeing that the man had already gone into the changing room to change clothes, she quietly said to the doctors outside, "The Third Young Master doesn’t have any serious problems, it’s just... he chased after me up several floors, will that, might that have any impact?" 
Indeed, she hadn’t noticed it at the time, but after she had calmed down later, she began to think about it. Plus, at that time, his complexion didn’t seem too good. 
Upon hearing this, the doctors immediately gathered together to discuss for a moment, and then all came over to gratefully shake Ye Ning’s hand, "Thank you, Miss An, now we know what to do, thank you." 
After saying that, these people, without even informing her of his condition, scurried off like rabbits one by one. 
These people really are... 
Ye Ning was truly speechless. Seeing that they had all left, with no other choice, she could only close the door and then went to the water dispenser to pour water for both of them. 
As she was pouring water, she heard his cellphone ring inside. Soon after, the sound of someone speaking could be heard, "Do you want to die or what? You can’t even stay put for the last few days, can you? I’m telling you, don’t wait until I come back and there’s good news, but you are no longer around to hear it." 
"..." 
It was Jicheng! 
Ye Ning shook her head with a smile... 
Actually, she should be envious of him, having such good brothers, such great friends. They always showed up beside him when he needed them the most, helping him, taking care of him. 
Speaking of which, their friendship was far stronger than those fair-weather friends found in the markets. 
But what depressed her was that the man inside didn’t appreciate this kind of care at all. After changning clothes, he casually tossed the cellphone onto the table and went to the restroom. 
An awkward Ye Ning had no choice but to pick up the call, "Doctor Ji..." 
"Why are you there?" 
"I..." 
Ye Ning was even more embarrassed. She stammered for a long time after glancing at the man who had not yet come out of the restroom, before managing to squeeze out, "We just got back..." 
"Where did you go?" 
"To... the company!" 
"Let me tell you, Miss An, no matter where you go, it’s not suitable for him to engage in intense activities right now. So I advise you to restrain yourself." 
"What?" 
Ye Ning didn’t understand, but at this moment, the door of the restroom opened with a click. Seeing her holding his cellphone, his expression darkened and he snatched it away to forcefully hang up. 
What’s going on? 
Why would he hang up his own call? She hadn’t said anything wrong? 
Ye Ning was quite naive and didn’t catch the meaning of what the man on the phone had implied, "Why did you hang up on him? That’s so rude, he was calling because he cares about you." 
"Not needed!" 
The man who had understood, however, was far from placated. 
This damn thing, it seemed he had been too lenient with him recently, and now he even dared to tease him. noveldrama
Seeing his demeanor, Ye Ning, of course, didn’t dare say anything more. She brought over the water she had poured and went to make the bed for him, "I’m going to give you an injection, then I’ll go downstairs to buy some food. It’s late now, you must be hungry, what would you like to eat?" 
Since he had responded to her with actions in the car, she was no longer cautiously restraining herself and had let go to take care of him, to interact with him. 
That was what she wanted, wasn’t it?
###Chapter 502: Chapter 502: The Truth! 8
Hearing she was going to buy food, Ou Mucen, who indeed felt a bit hungry after the morning’s ordeal, nodded in agreement, "Hmm, something light, please." 
"Okay!" noveldrama
Ye Ning agreed, and after making his bed, she went out. 
Half an hour later, when she came back carrying the packed porridge and meals, inside the hospital room, the man receiving an IV drip had already fallen asleep. 
He must have been very tired, right? 
After all, he had been through a lot around noon. As a patient, that could be too much to handle. 
Seeing this, she placed the food on the small table, took his mobile phone that had slipped to the side and placed it away, and quietly tidied up the documents at the bedside. Only then did she cover him with a blanket, and sat down beside his bed. 
This was probably the first time she observed him from such a close distance, right? 
No, that wasn’t right, it should be said that this was the first time since her confession that she had come so close to look at him. 
His facial features were truly delicate, not like his father’s. He resembled his mother, Bai Tingfang, quite a lot. And his mother, back in the day in A City, was indeed a famed beauty. It was for that reason that the old gentleman insisted on marrying her despite knowing that her family’s circumstances were average. 
The deep contours of his eye sockets, now with him asleep, cast beautiful shadows on his fair complexion thanks to his dense and slightly curled eyelashes, making his features appear even more three-dimensional. His high nose and perfect thin lips were handsome and carried a hint of a devilish charm, as if sculptured by a master artist. 
However, the only blemish was that due to his recent injuries, he had lost too much vitality. It made his complexion look a little sickly pale, lacking vitality. 
Seeing this, a wave of guilt surged in Ye Ning’s heart. She bowed her head and took his hand that rested quietly beside him into her own... 
"Ou Mucen, do you know? Even now, it feels like I’m dreaming. I can’t believe you don’t hold anything against me, and I can’t believe you would accept such a me, Ou Mucen." 
Like talking in her sleep, she held his hand and began to slowly reveal the words buried in her heart. 
That’s right, she was such a person, reserved, lonely. Her experiences over the years had led her to habitually keep things to herself, silently enduring any burden. 
But now, with him asleep, she suddenly wanted to tell him everything in her heart—it wasn’t for any other reason than the fact that only with him asleep could she muster the courage. 
"I never thought that one day I would be with you. When your family adopted me, you were like an unattainable sky, and I was the dust buried in the dirt, Ou Mucen. Isn’t fate amazing? In the end, it still brought me to you..." 
As she spoke, she suddenly stopped. Perhaps she had thought of something and her expression turned incredibly sad and dim, and even her fingers suddenly felt cold. 
What was she doing? 
The person lying on the bed felt the coldness of the hand wrapping his wrist and was about to open his eyes to see what was happening when at that moment, her voice spoke again, "How wonderful it would have been if I had met you earlier. Meeting you, maybe I wouldn’t have had to pay such a high price, or been forced to have a child so early! Why didn’t you appear sooner?"
###Chapter 503: Chapter 503: The Truth! 9
She finally began to sob softly, and those warm droplets fell, one by one, onto the back of his hand, burning his heart, each drop causing a twitch. 
It was impossible for him to have been there at that time, he simply didn’t know she existed, and at that time, he was only 19 years old. 
At the age of 19, he was in college, enjoying his youth with a group of friends and brothers on campus, and at that time, he hadn’t taken over the family business yet, so it was completely out of the question for him to do those things. 
But now, as she cried beside his ear, he suddenly regretted not agreeing when the old man had asked him to take over the business earlier. 
Because if he had taken over then, Longfeng would definitely be his, and in order to enhance his management skills, he would naturally seek ways to explore new channels. Then, how could she, with such a pair of gifted eyes, have no chance of being found by him? 
His hand, with the IV drips, slowly clenched... 
"Ou Mucen, do you really not care about my past at all? I’ve been to prison, had a child, and I don’t even know who the father is, Ou Mucen, can you really accept someone like me?" 
"..." 
It was as though something snapped in his brain, and his thoughts came to a complete halt. 
What was she saying? 
She’s saying... she doesn’t even know who the father of her child is? How is that possible? 
His chest began to rise and fall slightly, and at the same time, his breathing lost its calm... 
Ye Ning, who was crying and holding his hand, suddenly felt his unusual behavior and with a jolt, she came to her senses!! 
My God! 
What was she telling him here? How could she have said all that? Had she gone mad? 
She stood up from the chair "with a bang", staring at him, her face drained of color, "Ou Mucen, you... are you awake?" 
"..." 
Time ticked away, second by second, and like a thief, her heart raced to her throat. 
Fortunately, to her relief, the man lying in the bed had not woken up; after shifting a bit, he tugged at the wrist attached to the IV and fell back asleep. 
Ye Ning noticed this, so she tiptoed over to check and realized that the reason for his uneven breathing and the rising and falling of his chest was that the IV tube had been pinched. 
The pinched IV tube must have been painful, uncomfortable, right? 
That’s why he reacted like that! 
After witnessing this scene, she felt a weight lifted off her shoulders. She went over, fixed the needle, straightened the IV tube, and without daring to linger, ran out quickly with her legs feeling weak. 
That was terrifying, how could she have spoken about those things to him just now? 
It was fortunate he hadn’t awakened; if he had, how could she continue to face him, let alone live with herself? 
She felt both embarrassed and angry, and after slapping herself on the face, she immediately left the room, planning to go downstairs for some air. 
And in the hospital room? 
The man lying on the bed slowly opened his eyes after hearing the sound of hurried footsteps leaving. He had been pretending to sleep. 
He was actually a light sleeper. Since taking over the family business, the immense work pressure and occasional disturbances and attacks had forced him to maintain a high level of vigilance, even in sleep. 
So, in fact, he had woken up earlier when she came to get his mobile phone and those documents.noveldrama
###Chapter 504: Chapter 504: Whose Child Is It? 1
He was supposed to open his eyes, but then he felt her grasp his hand and sit down by his bedside; he had a premonition she was about to say something, so he simply chose not to wake up and continued to sleep peacefully. 
Indeed, his intuition was incredibly accurate. It took less than three minutes of her sitting down for her to start pouring out her thoughts in detail. 
These were her innermost feelings, things that he, despite his persistence, could never force out of her. 
He was pleased that what she harbored in her heart was what he enjoyed hearing. Only, those final words of hers, saying even she didn’t know who the father of the child was, shocked him. 
How could she not know who the child’s father was? 
Where on earth did this child come from? 
He suddenly realized he had overlooked a very important issue. He had investigated all her backgrounds and how she had switched identities, but he had never looked into the child. 
The child... 
Thinking of that innocent and lovely child, he could not stay still any longer. He sat up from the bed and took out his mobile phone, "Hello, this is Ou Mucen." 
"Third Young Master..." 
"Tell me, when I asked you to look into that adopted daughter from the second wife’s family, did you find out where her child came from?" He threw out such a question without preamble, without realizing that the secretary on the other end of the phone had no idea the adopted daughter even had a child. 
"Third Young Master, does Ye Ning have a child? How did you find out?" 
"I..." 
"Third Young Master, why have you been so interested in this Ye Ning lately? Now that your brother and his family have fallen from grace, are you still going to look into that adopted daughter of theirs?" 
Secretary Gao bombarded him with two questions in a row, leaving him speechless. 
Indeed, he did not understand because he did not know that the adopted daughter was An Ning, who was currently by his side. 
Ou Mucen was losing patience, his voice grew stern as he uttered, "You don’t need to concern yourself with these details. Just check whether Ye Ning had any children while she was in prison, and if so, who’s the child’s father? Just tell me what you find out." 
After he spoke, he hung up the phone! 
This was indeed a very serious issue. How could he have never thought of investigating this child? 
The child was only four years old this year, and she had been in prison for five years. That meant the child was born while she was incarcerated. So, who was the father? She had said at her job interview that her husband had already died. 
But now, she told him she didn’t know who the father of the child was. How could a woman give birth and not know the identity of the child’s father? 
How could this be possible? noveldrama
It was utterly absurd! 
Unless there was one possibility... 
He suddenly felt a violent thumping in the depths of his heart, and at that moment, his mobile phone rang again. He looked at it and saw a message from Secretary Gao... 
"Third Young Master, I just asked a few servants at Blue Mountain Villa, and they said that the adopted girl had a very close relationship with your nephew when she was at the villa. If there is a child, could it possibly be his?" 
"..."
Secretary Gao was stating what seemed like a very normal fact. 
However, upon hearing this, the man here felt as if he had suddenly fallen from the clouds to the ground; instantly, his heart was completely drenched! 
How could this be possible? This was utterly preposterous!! 
He suddenly found the needle that was hanging from his arm unbearably glaring. As a surge of nameless anger arose in him, he forcefully pulled it out and threw it away. 
In an instant, blood spurted from the needle site. In just a few seconds, bright red blood had splattered everywhere.
###Chapter 505: Chapter 505: Whose Child Is It? 2
Just then, a nurse came in to check if his IV drip had finished, and upon entering the room and witnessing the scene, she was taken aback, "Third Young Master, what’s wrong with you? Doctor, call a doctor quickly!!" 
-
Ye Ning ran fast because she had carelessly said too much, and nearly got overheard, leaving her quite shaken. After leaving the ward, she didn’t look back and went downstairs, planning to be alone and quiet for a while. 
She had been far too careless, how could she forget herself and say so much by his ear? Luckily he was asleep, but if he had been awake, if he had heard those things, what would he have thought? Would he still accept her as he does now? 
She was so full of regret she couldn’t forgive herself! noveldrama
All the way down the stairs, she reached the outpatient lobby. She had intended to go outside for a walk, but at that moment, in the lobby, several doctors and nurses were wheeling someone out. She looked over and her steps came to an abrupt halt. 
It was Yang Xueshan, dressed in a hospital gown, with an IV still attached to her arm, being wheeled out of the operating room. 
It seemed she had just had surgery. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning approached subconsciously, "Doctor, how is she doing?" 
The doctor glanced at her, "Are you a family member of the patient?" 
Ye Ning: "..." 
Looking around and seeing no one who appeared to be waiting for her, she cast a glance at the woman on the stretcher who had not yet regained consciousness and nodded her head, "I know her, is there something you need to tell me?" 
"Okay, the patient’s injury wasn’t fatal, the sharp didn’t hit any vital parts, so her life isn’t in any serious danger, but she did lose a lot of blood and needs good rest." 
"..." 
As long as she hadn’t died, she was still awaiting Yang Xueshan to tell her about the man from back then. 
Relieved by the news, Ye Ning asked, "Okay, I got it. Which ward will she be in?" 
"Surgical department, 9th floor, ward 8 of the inpatient section. However, you probably can’t visit her." 
"Why not?" 
The doctor glanced over in a certain direction and following his gaze, Ye Ning turned to look, spotting two very young men not far across from them, staring intently over here. 
They were police officers! 
That’s right, she had forgotten, Yang Xueshan was a suspect now, and even if hospitalized, wasn’t allowed free visitation. 
Ye Ning realized this and stood in front of the stretcher, pondering for a moment... 
If visitation was not allowed, the plan she had agreed upon with this woman would become complicated. How would they arrange the time, place, and the handover? And how was she going to get her out? All of these were problems. 
"When can she be discharged?" 
"Her injuries are not severe, so she should be able to leave in about three days." 
Three days from now? 
But three days from now was the time she had arranged with her to help her escape the hospital. If by then Yang Xueshan was discharged and taken to the police station, how could she still help her? 
Finally feeling the urgency, Ye Ning looked at the woman, her eyes flickered, and on impulse, she grabbed all the IV bags and documents placed on the woman and said, "I am her family, I will go up with you all." 
"But..." 
"It’s fine, the police are carrying out official duties, but they can’t completely disregard human feelings, right?" Ye Ning didn’t give him a chance to argue and carried the belongings into the elevator. 
Seeing this, the doctor had no choice but to explain to the two arriving officers, and after hearing that she was a family member, they did not stop her. Thus, Ye Ning finally followed the stretcher up.
###Chapter 506: Chapter 506: Whose Child Is It? 3
Upon reaching the ninth floor of the inpatient department, as expected, the two young police officers were closely following her without leaving any space. Seeing this, Ye Ning took the documents and paid the fees before coming over with a large bag of medicine. 
"I’m going to deliver the medicine and take a look at her." 
"Who are you to her? Your name isn’t on her records." 
"Well, I grew up with her in the orphanage," Ye Ning said calmly, with a faint smile that revealed nothing. 
Upon hearing this, the two officers exchanged glances and finally let her in. 
Once inside, the isolation ward was very quiet. Other than the beep-beep-beep of the heart monitor, the room was so silent you could hear a pin drop. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning walked over, placed the medicine on the bedside table, and fixed her gaze on the woman who was still unconscious on the hospital bed. 
The doctor had said she wasn’t in critical condition, but the anesthesia from the surgery would take two hours to wear off, and it had only been an hour since she left. 
So that means waiting another hour? 
No, she couldn’t wait, and she couldn’t afford to wait. If she waited another hour, she would have no chance to see her again, nor any opportunity to escape. 
Ye Ning slowly bent down, and in the gloomy, eerie atmosphere of the curtained ward, she took out a small syringe filled with transparent liquid from her body. 
"Yang Xueshan, you’d better keep your promise, or I’ll make your death very ugly!" As soon as she finished speaking and moved her hand, in just a few seconds, a moan escaped from the mouth of the woman lying unconscious on the bed, and her tightly shut eyes suddenly opened. 
"You—" 
"Listen, you have five minutes to make a deal with me, or you’ll miss your chance to do what you want to do." 
She spoke coldly, as if a specter had crawled out from hell. After uttering these words, she violently pulled the needle from her hand and snapped the silver-shining needle before tossing it into the trash can below. 
As a suspect of no value, the police would not believe that someone might want to do anything to her at this time. 
Yang Xueshan’s eyes widened, staring at Ye Ning for a good while before she finally collected her senses. "What happened? Why did you come to see me here?" noveldrama
Ye Ning’s gaze turned frosty. "You’re due to be discharged and transferred to the police station in three days, so your plan for three days from now needs a change in timing." 
What? 
To be discharged in three days? 
Yang Xueshan was indeed shocked by this news. Lying there, she clenched her fist for a long time before her face turned white as she said, "Since that’s the case, then let’s make it the day after tomorrow!" 
"The day after tomorrow?" 
"Yes, the day after tomorrow. Find a way to get me out. Then I’ll tell you who that man is." 
"Why should I believe you?" 
"I can show you part of a video first, but not all of it. The video was taken the night you were at the hotel, recorded by someone I instructed. Once I successfully escape, I will immediately send you the other half." 
She finally relented, perhaps because she knew she had no one else to turn to. 
Ye Ning’s eyes narrowed sharply! 
She had actually recorded a video that night?!!
###Chapter 507: Chapter 507: Whose Child Is It? 4
That night’s video? 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning’s pupils suddenly shrank violently. 
"This bitch, she actually has the video from that night? She harmed me, and she even had the nerve to record it?" noveldrama
Ye Ning finally exploded, abruptly bending forward. Her eyes blood-red, she reached out and yanked Xueshan up from the hospital bed: "Are you even human? How could you record that? Yang Xueshan, what exactly is your heart made of?" 
When Xueshan was jerked up, she immediately grimaced in pain, but she didn’t make a sound. After regaining her composure, she looked at Ye Ning and actually smiled: "If I hadn’t recorded it, how would I have anything to give you today?" 
"You beast!" 
She finally lost control. Her fingers curled around the neck she had lifted, and she fiercely squeezed it in her grasp. 
She couldn’t be blamed for this; the woman had grown up with her in the orphanage, Xueshan was two years older than her six. She had always thought they would be best friends, the closest of sisters. 
But what about the outcome? 
For her own wealth and prospects, not only did she treat Ye Ning like a gift to be given away to others, but in the end, she also helped those people send Ye Ning to prison, causing her to give birth out of wedlock. 
Was she even human? 
They had once been so close, yet she could still record the entire process of Ye Ning being with that man in bed. 
This beast, this thing worse than pigs and dogs! 
Her eyes completely bloodshot, she put all her strength into her hands, squeezing the neck with all her might, as if she wouldn’t be satisfied until she snapped it. 
Yang Xueshan finally began to fear, looking at the face above her that had lost all reason, she began to struggle: "Ye Ning... if you choke me to death, you... will never know who that man is for the rest of your life." 
"I don’t care if I don’t know; I’ve been assuming he’s dead for all these years. It doesn’t matter whether I know or not." 
"What about... your child? Don’t you think your child... would want to know their father? Moreover, if... he falls ill in the future, not knowing his father means one less hope. Have you... have you thought about that?" 
The fierce struggle, along with the suffocating sensation around her neck, had already blurred the woman’s vision. 
However, for the sake of her life, she was still stubbornly hanging on. It was at this moment that she finally realized when one person’s hatred for another reaches an extreme, how terrifying and dreadful that power can be. 
"Ye Ning, I... promise you that once this matter is settled, I will tell you the whole truth. And it’s not just... this video. I’ve also saved evidence of other matters. Your fraud case, and everything that man has done over the years—I have it all. Ye Ning, don’t you want... don’t you want to clear your name and step into the light again? Don’t you want... the real culprit to receive the punishment he deserves?" 
By the time she finished speaking, the hands that had been tightly clasping her neck stiffened and then stopped. 
Clearing her name? 
To stand under the sunlight once more, upright and unchallenged? 
Ye Ning stared at her intently, her eyes like those of a bloodthirsty beast that had been temporarily pacified.
###Chapter 508: Chapter 508: Whose Child Is It? 5
She really didn’t need to know who the man was; for many years, she had treated him as if he were dead. Knowing or not knowing didn’t matter, but the allure of "clearing her name" was too great for her to resist. 
Yes, she couldn’t live in this world forever under the false identity of An Ning, nor could she live like a rat forever, only able to survive in the darkness, where no light shone. 
Her chest rose and fell for a long time before she finally, slowly, loosened her grip and let her go. 
Upon seeing this, Yang Xueshan immediately tilted back her head and took a long breath, like a fish that had almost died, finally getting fresh water. The moment she was released, she started to breathe deeply and rapidly. 
Ye Ning stared at her without speaking until her breathing finally stabilized. Then, with an icy look, she said, "Where is it?" 
Yang Xueshan turned her head, "You haven’t..." 
"You have no right to negotiate with me. I’ll tell you, you now have only two options. First, give me what I want, and I’ll let you go. Second, die!" She was like a snake in the darkness, her gaze cold and sharp, sending a shiver down the spine. 
Yang Xueshan finally began to feel afraid. Lying there, she thought dismally for a while before finally agreeing, "Fine, I’ll tell you where it is. But I can only give you half of everything; otherwise, even if you kill me, I will not give it to you." 
Ye Ning: "..." 
She just stared expressionlessly at Yang Xueshan as she wrote an address in a small notebook by the bed. Seconds later, abruptly, she pulled out a syringe from her body and jabbed it fiercely into Yang Xueshan’s arm. 
Yang Xueshan was caught off guard, and she cried out in pain and anger, "What are you injecting me with?" 
The girl holding the syringe gave a chilling smile, "When making a deal, it’s normal to need some bargaining chips. You have nothing, so staking your life as collateral isn’t odd, is it?" 
"You—" 
"Oh, and just a reminder, this stuff has a short incubation period, just two or three days, so you’d better hurry up. Otherwise, if something goes wrong, it’s not my problem." 
She was really like a devil, carrying out the most brutal acts, yet her face, which was as pretty as the girl next door, revealed the most innocent and guiltless of smiles. 
Yang Xueshan watched, dumbstruck, forgetting to struggle until the needle was pulled from her body. Only when she felt the pain did her brows furrow in agony, her gaze fixating on her. 
"How could you become like this? You weren’t this terrifying before." 
"Is that so? What was I like before? Naive? Kind? Or just a clueless Little White Rabbit?" She patted Yang Xueshan’s face as if petting a dog she owned. noveldrama
Yang Xueshan abruptly came to her senses, and that sense of self-inflicted humiliation made her face red with shame, her neck swelling up! 
Hadn’t she been forced into this by her? 
When Ye Ning finally left, she took the small notebook with her and, of course, tidied up the messy bed a bit. Otherwise, it would be troublesome if the two policemen outside noticed.
And in the hospital room? 
The woman, who had still harbored a sliver of hope to exploit Ye Ning and make a getaway, furiously punched the hospital bed once she saw Ye Ning take the items and leave.
###Chapter 509: Chapter 509: Whose Child Is It? 6
After all, she simply couldn’t outfight her! 
Back then, she trusted her, depended on her, and never imagined she would harm her. If she, Yang Xueshan, had known earlier, would she still have had a chance to succeed? Could she still be lying here? 
Yang Xueshan felt a despair she had never known before! 
—— 
When Ye Ning came out with that notebook, she didn’t immediately look for the place. After checking the time, she thought of the man in another hospital ward and decided to go back to him first. 
Returning to the sickroom, the peace and warmth of the high-end VIP ward immediately invaded her senses. 
However, today, a whiff of blood mingled with the scent of disinfectant in the air, making her sensitive nose very uncomfortable. noveldrama
Had he finished his injection? 
Walking inside, she saw the man casually flipping through a magazine at the small table, so she quickly approached him, "You’re awake? Have you eaten anything?" 
Ou Mucen was browsing through a newly arrived finance magazine. Seeing her return, his eyes, otherwise devoid of emotion, lifted slightly, "No." 
"You haven’t eaten? Why not eat? It’s getting late, you’re a patient, how can you endure without eating?" She hurriedly brought out the porridge and some other dishes she had brought back, hearing he hadn’t eaten. 
Fortunately, the takeout place used insulated containers, so even after more than an hour, the food was still warm. 
So she simply washed her hands, took everything out on the table, then took the magazine from his hand, and handed him the spoon, "Stop reading for now, eat something." 
This gesture was a significant step she took towards him, something she had never dared to do before. 
Yet, it seemed like the man did not appreciate it much; seeing his magazine taken away, his brows furrowed slightly, and he didn’t reach out to take the spoon she offered. 
Seeing this, Ye Ning involuntarily shrank back, standing there awkwardly with her gaze lowered, not knowing where to place her hands, "I’m sorry, then... Keep reading if you want, and eat whenever you feel like it." 
She sat down in front of him and started eating her own meal... 
She was always so cautious, just as she had whispered into his ear while he was sleeping, even though they were together now, the disparity in their backgrounds and the difference in status still made her feel insecure, lacking confidence. 
But just as she was eating with a sense of loss, the man sitting opposite her picked up the spoon himself, "Don’t use these disposable things in the future. They’re not clean." 
Huh? 
With a mouthful of food, Ye Ning’s beautiful glass-like eyes suddenly lifted to look at him, "Not clean?" 
Ou Mucen hummed affirmatively, his long and distinct fingers holding the spoon leisurely scooped a small amount from the porridge before him and tasted it nonchalantly. 
Damn! 
How could someone make even eating look so attractive? 
Ye Ning, forgetting what she was doing, simply held her spoon in her mouth, staring at him, and her gaze was as infatuated as it could possibly be. 
Ou Mucen continued to eat slowly; he really wasn’t in the mood for food, and if it were not to prevent her from overthinking, he wouldn’t even want to touch these things.
###Chapter 510: Chapter 510: Whose Child Is It? 7
However, while he was eating, he suddenly felt two gazes staring intently at him from across the table. So he put down his spoon and looked up indifferently at the opposite side, "Is there something so fascinating that you don’t even need to eat?"
"Ah?" 
"No one is competing with you for food. You can look after you finish eating." 
Ah? 
Ah!!! 
The woman who had been staring at him finally came to her senses. Instantly, her delicate little face turned red, and she buried her entire head into the bowl in front of her. 
She was so embarrassed, what on earth was she doing? 
She ate furiously, without looking at what was actually in her bowl, her expression so awkward she wished she could find a hole to crawl into. 
Ou Mucen found it somewhat amusing, picked up his spoon again, and for some reason, this little interlude seemed to have lifted his spirits somewhat. 
After eating a few bites of his spaghetti and sipping some porridge, he set the spoon down. Then, while wiping his lips, he sat there and asked, "What exactly happened with that fraud case you were involved in?" 
"Huh?" 
Ye Ning, who had been eating fiercely, was caught off guard by his question, "What did you say?" 
Ou Mucen calmly looked at her, "I mean the case that got you imprisoned, what exactly happened?" noveldrama
He had finally asked the question. After much reflection and hesitation, he had decided to ask her. 
After the question was asked, the girl who was eating stopped all her movements. She looked at him, panic and unpreparedness flooding her pretty eyes, as if she had never anticipated he would ask. 
In fact, she hadn’t! 
Even he hadn’t expected that he would ask her directly. 
Sitting there for about a minute, she finally spoke, "It was all their doing." 
"Who? Ou Yuze?" 
"And... Mei Liping, and that woman named Yang Xueshan..." She slowly put down her spoon, her face turning pale. 
Seeing her reaction, Ou Mucen somehow regretted bringing it up, especially when he saw the light in her eyes fade away, replaced by pain and hatred, he regretted it even more. 
At that time, they told me they had found a piece of Original Jade Stone of very high quality, but Longfeng lacked the funds to buy it. So they had me switch the fake for the real. After I heard about it, I arranged a fake jade stone and deliberately bid the highest price at the auction to win the real one. Once the stone was in hand, I would replace it with the fake and then inform the auction house it was counterfeit. That’s the whole story of what happened." 
She had started to speak, and by the end, her voice had even calmed. 
Ou Mucen sat opposite her, and upon hearing this, he was momentarily stunned. Perhaps even he hadn’t expected her to be so unreserved, so candid. 
So, that was the truth behind that case from years ago. 
He picked up a glass of water from the table and took a sip from it, "So, you’re saying you went to prison because you took the fall for them?" 
Take the fall? 
Ye Ning let out a cold laugh and poured herself a glass of water, "There was no fall to take. They did this only to send me to that place."
###Chapter 511: Chapter 511: Whose Child Is It? 8
"What?" 
"As the third young master of the Ou Family, don’t you find it strange how rapidly their Longfeng rose to prominence all those years ago?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
He had indeed found it strange, but ever since he learned her secret, he no longer found it strange. 
But, was that related to her going to prison? 
Ou Mucen gripped the water glass, as if something had jumped in his heart. 
"Yes! I investigated for a long time and never found the reason behind their rapid development. What, does this have something to do with you?" 
Ye Ning smiled again, "It’s hard to believe, isn’t it? Since I was young, I’ve had a special talent for jade stones. I can tell at a glance whether a jade stone is good or bad. Later, Yang Xueshan learned of this secret. Seeing that my talent could bring her endless glory and wealth, she immediately told her boss at the jewelry store where she worked, your nephew, Ou Yuze. Then, Ou Yuze had his mother, Mei Liping, come to adopt me." 
Yes, it was such a simple story, summed up in a few words. 
But who could know the conspiracies hidden behind this story, the tears shed, the filth? 
Ye Ning began idly drawing circles on the glass in front of her, her eyes looking out the window, her thoughts seemingly traveling back to the year she was adopted. 
"I entered the orphanage at the age of six, and in those eight years, I never felt the love of a family or the affection of someone who cared for me. I thought, the day that woman came to take me home in her beautiful clothes, my life would from then on be happy and joyful. But when I got to that home, I discovered that their reason for raising me was not for who I was, but for my talent." 
As she spoke, she eventually began to laugh, but that laughter was like the setting sun outside the window, beautiful to see but infinitely desolate no matter how one looked at it. 
Ou Mucen’s heart clenched tightly. He set down the glass and spoke, "Okay, it’s getting late. Go pick up Xiaobao." 
Right, no need to say anymore. She didn’t need to say the rest; he already knew. 
Now, he just regretted letting her talk about it. 
Ah? 
The woman, still immersed in her sorrow, hadn’t recovered and, upon hearing this, stared blankly at him with eyes that seemed veiled in desolate mist, "What did you say?" 
Ou Mucen’s heart twitched again, "Today is Mid-Autumn Festival. Go get Xiaobao, and we’ll take him out for dinner." 
"..." 
Sitting there, she looked at him for a while, then her awareness gradually returned. She stood up from the chair, "Okay, I’ll go get him." 
And then, she left.
When she went out, she even forgot to take her bag that was on the chair next to her. 
Seeing her like this, Ou Mucen lit a cigarette with his slender fingers. His delicate and perfect features expressed an increasingly self-reproachful mood... 
"Ying Hao, An Ning has left, follow her in the car." 
"To keep an eye on her?" Ying Hao was extremely clever. 
Ou Mucen nodded, then hung up the phone... noveldrama
... 
This was indeed an answer he had never expected! 
Regarding her case, from the moment he started to investigate, he actually already knew she was innocent. He just thought that the wretched family had made her take the fall. But he had never imagined that the truth would turn out to be this.
###Chapter 512: Chapter 512: Whose Child Is It? 9
Talent? 
No, it was not a talent; it was her eyes! 
A pair of eyes that could be called a rare treasure in this world—Pupula Duplex! 
He remembered the scene he had seen in the surveillance footage that night, and suddenly, something stabbed fiercely at the bottom of his heart. His sharply defined features turned cold, and the air became oppressively chilly around his brows, which now only contained a sinister aura. 
How preposterous, she was a person, not an to be used and then contained! 
And to be contained in such a manner? 
His eyes finally grew darker and darker, and both the danger and bloodlust were hidden within them. noveldrama
"Hello, it’s Ou Mucen!" 
"Third Young Master..." 
"Have you found him?" 
"Replying to the Third Young Master, he has not appeared yet. It’s a bit strange; we have been looking for him since two hours ago when you ordered us to freeze all his properties. But up to now, he hasn’t shown his face." 
"What do you mean?" 
"It’s like this, before you called, we went to the places he frequents in this city, but what’s strange is that he hasn’t shown up anywhere—not even a sign of him. And no one has seen him at his company either. Doesn’t the Third Young Master find it strange?" 
"..." 
Indeed, it was odd. Ou Yuze was not someone with strong mental fortitude; facing such a situation, he would have already collapsed. 
And such a collapse typically leads to two reactions, one, to find a place to vent and momentarily forget the pain. 
The second option, if he retained any semblance of rationality, would be to check on the private properties he had amassed outside over these years. Otherwise, without those properties, he would truly be reduced to destitution. 
Yet now, he had gone to neither place and had disappeared... 
He sat in his chair, pondering for a while, then said, "Check his phone, see if anyone has called him in these last two hours." 
"Yes, Third Young Master. Should we check the airport as well?" 
"Why check the airport?" 
"Just in case... in case he fled the country?" The person on the phone sounded somewhat embarrassed. 
No sooner had these words dropped than his master decisively negated them, "No, we control all his properties now. If he leaves the country, he would be penniless and headed for a dead end." 
"Yes, Third Young Master, understood!" 
The person finally got the message and immediately hung up to check the calls. 
And the man on this end, after putting down his phone, his eyes were completely shrouded in darkness... 
Ou Yuze, you’d better not be dead. Otherwise, I’d have no choice but to start with your family’s old folks! 
With a pinch of his fingers, the cigarette held in his hand instantly turned to ash. 
—— 
Ou Mucen had guessed correctly; Ou Yuze indeed had not left the country. He wasn’t at any entertainment venues nor at his company because he had gone to a place so hidden that not even he could have anticipated it. 
"Please have a seat, Mr. Ou. Our Mr. Lin will be here shortly." 
After ushering the man in, Xiaojin quickly left. 
Ou Yuze took in his surroundings... 
This was a small antique shop located on Dongdamen Antique Street. Its location was inconspicuous, the goods on display were rather ordinary, but the jade tree that was there to attract wealth seemed to be of fine quality.
###Chapter 513: Chapter 513: Whose Child Is It? 10
He reached out towards the , intending to take a closer look, but just then, a gentle and refined voice suddenly came from behind, "Mr. Ou, long time no see." 
It was the antique heavyweight, Mr. Lin! 
Ou Yuze heard this and immediately retracted his hand, turning to look behind him, "Mr. Lin, such a long time no see, I didn’t expect you lived here?" 
Lin Yebai smiled, "For someone like me, where I live doesn’t matter—it’s just a residence. Please come this way, Mr. Ou." 
After speaking, he turned and entered the courtyard behind the antique shop. 
Ou Yuze saw this and hurriedly followed. 
Ou Yuze hadn’t had much interaction with Mr. Lin; he only knew that he was a very famous figure in this line of business, a man of great skill who mixed in both the underworld and the legitimate world. 
As such, he acted quite restrained in his presence. 
Following him inside, he noticed that upon entering the courtyard, the view was much more spacious than the front store, as if entering another place altogether. 
Accompanying him, they saw an already set tea table with tea brewing, and as they arrived, the fragrant aroma hit them. The scent was so refreshing that Ou Yuze, whose mind had been in turmoil all day, felt an unprecedented clarity. 
"Mr. Lin, what brings me here today? What do you need?" Ou Yuze asked. 
"Nothing serious," Lin Yebai replied. "I saw the newspaper today and learned about Mr. Ou’s troubles, so I asked you to come and take the pair of Jade Bracelets you entrusted to me in Japan. You are in need of money now, aren’t you?" 
Lin Yebai was straightforward as he inquired, and he spoke directly. 
Ou Yuze was startled... 
Jade Bracelets? 
That’s right, the pair of Jade Bracelets he had switched in Japan were originally meant to be taken by himself, but after he was exposed, he had entrusted them to him. Unexpectedly, Lin Yebai still remembered them at this time. 
Ou Yuze felt deeply moved, and for a moment, even the corners of his eyes turned red, "I won’t hide it from Mr. Lin—I’ve been driven out today, and I haven’t seen a single figure from all of my friends and relatives. Yet, you..." 
He didn’t finish his sentence, but it was clear he was truly touched. 
Lin Yebai, sitting there, merely smiled faintly and gestured for him to sit down, then had Xiaojin bring out the pair of Jade Bracelets. 
"They were originally yours to begin with. I’m just returning what belongs to its rightful owner, I haven’t done much," he said. 
"It’s different," Ou Yuze responded. "Mr. Lin, you don’t understand. Even a little bit means a lot to me right now, it’s like sending charcoal in snowy weather, not to mention that these Jade Bracelets were a pair of treasured collectibles dearly loved by my grandfather." 
"Your grandfather?" 
"Yes, these were burial items for the royal family of the Han Dynasty. They are very valuable. My grandfather giving them to Bai Tingfang caused dissatisfaction with my father and aunt, leading to a long uproar at home." 
Perhaps it was the act of receiving timely help that made this man completely let his guard down, for he ended up revealing the origins of the Jade Bracelets. 
As the words ended, the expressions of the two men in the courtyard changed slightly, both giving the Jade Bracelets a significant look. noveldrama
Burial items for the Han Dynasty’s royal family? 
Could it be...?! 
Xiaojin nearly snatched the Jade Bracelets back, but at this moment, Lin Yebai acted faster than her, pressing the bracelets back down, "If that’s the case, then you should take good care of these. s from the royal family of the Han Dynasty can be worth a lot of money."
###Chapter 514: Chapter 514: Whose Child Is It? 11
Ou Yuze hadn’t noticed the commotion and, upon hearing this, immediately nodded, "Of course, I have to thank Mr. Lin for that. Rest assured, if I make a comeback, I’ll definitely not forget you." 
Make a comeback? 
Lin Yebai glanced at the brocade box that had been put away and withdrew his indifferent gaze, "That goes without saying. By the way, I’ve heard that the reason for your severe defeat this time was because of your little uncle?" 
Ou Yuze’s face instantly turned ashen, "Yes, he sent a vile wench to my side who set a trap that I fell into." 
A vile wench? 
The words spat out, whether it was Xiaojin or the man sipping tea, a flash of ruthlessness crossed their eyes. 
However, that ruthlessness soon disappeared after a moment... 
"So, Mr. Ou, have you thought about how you’d like to take your revenge?" 
"Revenge?" Ou Yuze held the jade box, his face filled with despair, a hint of frustration flashing across it: "How can I seek revenge looking like this now?" 
"That might not necessarily be the case. Mr. Ou, do you still remember the case from five years ago?" 
"That case?" 
"The one where your adopted daughter committed a high-profile fraud. If my guess is correct, he must have discovered the secret of your adopted daughter and wanted her to help him in the jewelry business. That’s why he has been holding on to you so tightly." 
He articulated slowly, without considering the impact or provocation his words might have on the man. 
The secret of the adopted daughter? 
Right, his family’s adopted daughter had an immense secret! 
Sure enough, Ou Yuze’s face drained of color instantly. Clutching the brocade box, he stared fixedly at him as if seeing something inconceivable, "Mr. Lin, how... how do you know all this?" 
The man drinking tea smiled elegantly, "Mr. Ou, have you forgotten what I do for a living? Did you really think that when your Longfeng rose swiftly years ago, no one else took notice?" 
Ou Yuze: "..." 
Staring at him, with his face deathly pale, it took him a long time to mechanically squeeze out a sentence, "So what are you implying now? Did Ou Mucen treat me like this just to get her?" 
"Yes, he has to bring you down in order to overturn her case. Just wait, in a couple of days he’ll come looking for you. In fact, he might be searching already. As soon as you admit to framing him back then, he’ll definitely take you to court, and then swap the adopted daughter out." 
One has to admit, the logic and rigor of the story the man concocted were truly beyond ordinary comparison. Every sentence, every reason, sounded so seamless, so invulnerable. 
To get the adopted daughter? 
Indeed, that woman had a pair of eyes that were exceedingly rare in this world, and Ou Mucen, just starting out in the jewelry industry, would undoubtedly gain an immense advantage by having her. Given that, his analysis really had no flaws to speak of. 
Just a few minutes later, the fool completely believed his words, "So Mr. Lin, what should I do now? I can’t go to prison, I’m already in this state. If I go to prison as well, my whole life will be ruined." 
The man holding the teacup smiled, "Therefore, Mr. Ou, when your little uncle finds you, you must never admit to anything. If he indeed pressures you, you could tell him that the adopted daughter is your woman. It is because she is your woman that she willingly went to prison for you." 
He smiled as if he had transformed into another person, his cold and venomous aura chilling even Xiaojin, who stood by the side... 
Why? 
Why did he feel so uneasy in his heart seeing him like this, even though the idea was clearly his? noveldrama
Why...
###Chapter 515: Chapter 515 He Suddenly Realized That He Seemed to Have Been Closely Imitated
Ou Yuze ultimately chose to believe Lin Yebai’s words and left, expressing his deep gratitude to Lin Yebai as he departed. 
Lin Yebai smiled warmly. After instructing Xiaojin to escort the guest out, he continued to leisurely brew tea in the backyard. 
After Xiaojin returned from seeing off the guest, he couldn’t help but ask, "Sir, aren’t you afraid that he will die at the hands of Ou Mucen?" 
Wouldn’t that be even better? 
The man enveloped in the light mist watched the water come to a boil and stretched out his hand to pour it into the teacup filled with fresh tea leaves... 
"What, you would be pleased if he died at the hands of Ou Mucen?" 
"No, no, it’s not that. I’m just concerned... If Aning finds out about this, will she...?" 
"She won’t. Of all people, she most wishes for Ou Yuze’s death. Now that we’re using Ou Mucen’s hand to kill him, she will be very happy." 
Moreover, most importantly, that man inadvertently learned that the child is his nephew, which is exactly what they had intended to accomplish. 
He poured the freshly brewed tea, brought it up to his nose, and took a whiff. A satisfied smile instantly appeared on his face. 
Xiaojin, witnessing this, felt an uncontrollable tightness in his heart... 
It was a deeply unsettling feeling. Although his master had always been ruthless and skilled in manipulation, he had never before radiated such an eerie and explosive air. It was as if his psyche had twisted, completely diverging from the person he once was. 
Xiaojin swallowed hard, and after a long while, he ventured another question, "By the way, about the pair of jade bracelets, Ou Yuze just said they were the burial items of the Han Dynasty royalty. Aren’t they the very items we’ve been looking for?" 
"Which is exactly why I can’t let them go!" 
He uttered these words indifferently and tilted his head back to drink the aromatic tea. 
Indeed, this was an unexpected and pleasant surprise! 
—— 
Ye Ning eventually went to pick up Xiaobao. On their way, Xiaobao kept asking her, "Mom, where are we going? Aren’t we going home?" 
Ye Ning, still somewhat dazed, subconsciously replied, "No, we’re not going home. Your Uncle Ou has invited us to dine out today, as it’s the Mid-Autumn Festival." 
"Really? That’s wonderful! It means we’ll have delicious food tonight." 
The young child, upon hearing this, burst into joyful hops at the back. 
Of course, he was happy. Uncle Ou was not just anyone; he was the man his mother liked, and whom he liked as well. On such an important festival as the Mid-Autumn Festival, Uncle Ou inviting them out to eat was reason enough for his joy. 
So when mother and son arrived at the hospital, Xiaobao’s tiny arms and legs carried him quickly toward the elevator. 
"Be careful, slow down," Ye Ning called out anxiously from behind. noveldrama
In just a few minutes, they reached the ward. Upon entering, Xiaobao immediately rushed to the man reclining on the bed, engrossed in work, "Uncle, are you feeling better?" 
Ou Mucen was in the midst of handling emails on his laptop. Seeing the round little Baozi approaching, his eyes lit up, and he closed the laptop, "Much better. So, you still care about me, huh?" 
"Of course, I have a conscience. How could I not care?" 
"..." 
Ou Mucen’s eyes twitched fiercely before he turned to the woman who had also just entered, "Change him into a new set of clothes. We leave in ten minutes."
###Chapter 516: Chapter 516 He suddenly realized that he seemed to have been highly imitated 2
Ye Ning was stunned for a moment, "Go where?" 
Ou Mucen’s face darkened immediately... 
This woman, has it been so long and she still hasn’t recovered? 
He intended to lift Little Baozi from the hospital bed to her side, but just as his fingers were about to touch the collar, something happened. His eyes saw that tiny face, and suddenly, the image of another man appeared in his mind. 
If this child really belonged to that man, then wouldn’t he be... his own grandnephew?!! 
In an instant, a wave of nausea surged in his heart, and his fingers drew back midair as if electrocuted. 
"Uncle?" 
"Let your mom change you, Uncle needs to go to the restroom." With that, he left Little Baozi behind and went to the restroom. 
Ye Ning was still in a daze, so she didn’t notice what had just happened. Hearing that her son was going to be changed, she took him to the dressing room. 
Ten minutes later, the three of them were finally ready, and Ou Mucen led them out the door... 
The Mid-Autumn Festival in A City is actually a rather grand affair, with many people eating reunion dinners on this day, and so did Blue Mountain Villa. noveldrama
It’s just a pity that this year’s Mid-Autumn Festival at Blue Mountain Villa was destined to be spent in a very unpleasant atmosphere. First, the second young master of the house was driven out, and then there was a call from the youngest young master in the hospital, saying he wouldn’t be coming back for dinner tonight. 
Not coming back for dinner? 
Ye Ning, sitting in the car, heard the man driving in front mention this over the phone and couldn’t help but worry, "Aren’t you coming home for dinner today? On Mid-Autumn Festival, your family always eats together every year." 
Ou Mucen scoffed, "That was before. Do you think with what happened with Longfeng today, Blue Mountain Villa is in any mood to eat?" 
Ye Ning fell silent... 
Indeed, today’s events could be said to be the greatest blow the Ou Family had suffered in many years. First, the old brand that had been operated for years collapsed overnight, and then it was revealed that all this had been caused by their own grandson. With such heavy hits and shocks, who would have the appetite for dinner? 
Ye Ning clenched her fist slightly and started to look out the window with some regret, "I’m sorry..." 
"You don’t need to apologize to me. All this, they owe you in the first place." 
She hadn’t even finished speaking when he interrupted her, his tone still very calm. 
Hearing this from behind, Ye Ning felt a weight lift from her heart. The anxious guilt that had always troubled her, along with the tightly wound caution, seemed to release all at once, and her mood finally began to improve. 
How lucky she was to have met such a good man who understood her. 
Upon arriving at the hotel, because Ou Mucen was a VIP gold member, their private room was located in the best spot in the hotel. 
Ye Xiaobao was delighted and pointed at a poster on the service desk, whining, "Sister, we’re also a family of three. Please give us this gift." 
One sentence, and the two adults behind him became awkward, especially Ye Ning. Seeing that this little rascal was pointing at a family package promotional event that the hotel had just launched that day, she wanted to find a hole to bury herself in. 
"Xiaobao, we’re not eating this today. We’re..." 
"Why not? It’s such a good deal, and there are toys, and roses too, right, Uncle?" Little Baozi said, pulling on the trouser leg of the man next to him with his chubby little hand. 
Ou Mucen found it both frustrating and amusing. Just as he was about to agree, the receptionist at the service desk approached, "Mr. and Mrs., are you going to participate in the family event? That’s wonderful, today we also have a family star contest. You see, your baby looks so much like his father, you’re sure to win the grand prize." 
"..." 
The child... looks a lot like "dad"? 
Ou Mucen looked down at Baozi... 
And Ye Ning, looked up at him...
###Chapter 517: Chapter 517 He Suddenly Realized That He Seemed to Have Been Closely Imitated 3
Ou Mucen saw this and couldn’t help but feel both annoyed and amused. Just as he was about to agree to go along with the idea, the receptionist at the front desk came over, "Mr. and Mrs., are you here to participate in the family event? That’s wonderful! Today we have a family star contest, and looking at how much your baby resembles his father, you’re sure to win the top prize." 
"..." 
The child... looks a lot like his father? 
Ou Mucen lowered his head to look at Baozi... 
Ye Ning also lifted her head to look at him... 
It was a moment so still that one could hear a pin drop in the grand hotel lobby, with the two adults and one child standing there, staring blankly at one another. If one didn’t know why they were acting this way, they might have thought they were stuck. 
Or perhaps, one might think it was a moment frozen in time; they were fixed in place as if immobilized. 
The receptionist, seeing the trio unmoving, her eyes also traveled back and forth between the "father" and "son": "What’s up with these two? Are they looking into a mirror?" 
A mirror?!! 
Hearing this, Ye Ning finally snapped back to reality, and immediately, suppressing the pounding in her heart, she hurriedly picked up her son from the floor, "No, we..." 
"Alright, let’s go with this then. Please take us to the private room," Mucen interrupted. 
"Yes, sir, right this way please!" 
The receptionist, delighted by his response, quickly led the man towards the elevator. 
Ye Ning, trailing behind and startled, could only follow with her son in her arms... 
She was genuinely shocked; she had never noticed before how much her son resembled this man, especially their eyes. Despite his young age, the way his brows furrowed and his impatient expressions were strikingly similar. 
This was too bizarre! 
How could this be? After raising him for so many years, she had failed to notice. 
Ye Ning felt like she had seen a ghost, to be honest. Her son’s appearance had always resembled her own quite closely, something Lin Yebai and Xiaojin had also observed, saying they looked very much alike. 
Therefore, for many years, she had never thought her son could resemble someone else as well. 
But today, when the receptionist said Little Baozi looked like that man, and upon closer inspection, she was shocked to find they did share some similarities. noveldrama
How could that be possible? 
He wasn’t related to him in any way, was he? 
Ye Ning’s heart was pounding fiercely as she carried her son over. She dared not look at the man walking in front anymore. Instead, she kept her head buried in her son’s small shoulder, her mind as chaotic as boiling porridge. 
They arrived at the top floor, and the receptionist ushered the three to the reserved private room, then added, "Sir, please make yourselves comfortable inside. Shortly, our photographer will come to take a family portrait for you, okay?" 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning was about to , but the man walking in front of her spoke up first, "Hmm, also bring his toys," Ou Mucen said. 
"Of course, sir!" The receptionist left with a beaming smile. 
Once the receptionist departed, the private room fell silent. Due to the astonishing realization from earlier, neither of them spoke. It was Ye Xiaobao who, upon seeing they had finally arrived, wriggled out of her embrace with his plump little body. 
"Uncle, this place is so beautiful, and you can see the sea too! It’s even prettier than the last place we went to."
###Chapter 518: Chapter 518 He Suddenly Realized That He Seemed to Have Been Closely Imitated 4
"Mm, do you like it?" 
He suddenly, out of the blue, was treating him just like before. 
Ye Xiaobao climbed onto the telescope stand specially prepared in the private room to look at the beautiful seascape outside. Ye Ning, seeing this, worried he might fall, hurried over, "Xiaobao, be careful." 
But just then, the man who had pulled out a chair to sit down, had already hoisted the plump little body in his arms, "Want to look at this?" 
"Yeah, can you see across from here?" 
"Of course, I’ll teach you!" 
He lifted him up as if he were picking up a chick, carelessly placed him on the nearby windowsill, then took down the telescope, worth tens of thousands, from its stand and handed it to him. 
Ye Ning, startled, blurted out, "That’s very valuable, handing it to him, be careful it doesn’t break!" 
The man, who was showing the child how to use the telescope, gave her a cool look, "If it breaks, it breaks. It’s not like I can’t afford it." 
Ye Ning: "..." noveldrama
You might be able to afford it, but I certainly can’t, oh my goodness, this man, who spoils a child like this? 
Ye Ning stood desperately behind the two, wanting to persuade them again, but recalling the sensitive topic from before and the still unresolved awkward atmosphere between them, she chose to keep quiet. 
So, in the private room, until the waiter served the dishes, the two men, one big and one small, were tinkering with the telescope. 
"Can you see clearly now?" 
"Yes, but it’s still not quite focused." 
"Then adjust it again, like this." 
"Okay..." 
"..." 
A gust of sea breeze rolled in from the outside, and Ye Ning, sitting by the table, truly felt what it meant to be an "outsider"... 
The dishes were served, and finally the two stopped fidgeting with the telescope. Thus, the three of them, two adults and a child, gathered around the table and finally began their holiday dinner. 
The dinner was lavish, it was evident that careful arrangements had been made, and the dishes were quite exquisite, obviously prepared specially for tonight’s meal with the mother and son. 
So, after the mother and son began to eat, Ye Ning thought back to the words of the greeter and felt somewhat remorseful. She hesitated for a while and finally spoke up, "About... what the greeter said earlier, don’t take it to heart. Xiaobao often has people saying he looks like this or that person." 
"Really?" 
"Yes, one time, someone even said he looks like the celebrity XX." Ye Ning, trying to ease the awkwardness she had caused, was pulling out all the stops, hoping he wouldn’t harbor any resentment because of the child. 
After all, he was a man of high stature, still unmarried; getting involved with her, an unmarried mother, was already a big enough loss for him. Now having people say her child looked like him was like openly declaring him a cheap father, wasn’t it? 
Ye Ning felt both awkward and uneasy. 
Fortunately, after listening, the man just gave her a fleeting, indifferent glance and then turned to peel the crab shell for the child beside him. 
"Want to eat this?" 
"What’s this?" 
"Crab. Eating it will make your arms even stronger..." he was actually playing with the child. 
Ye Ning, watching from across the table, finally gave up and began eating quietly herself... 
However, his response eased her worried heart for the moment. He was always a rational and calm person and naturally wouldn’t believe those words said by people trying to entice customers.
###Chapter 519: Chapter 519 He Suddenly Realized That He Seemed to Have Been Closely Imitated 5
With that thought, her tense expression completely relaxed. noveldrama
During dinner, the greeter who had mentioned taking their picture came over with the photographer. Ye Ning had assumed the man who hadn’t taken it seriously would refuse, but surprisingly, he cooperated with Xiaobao and her, posing for several photos taken by the photographer. 
After capturing the photos, the photographer’s eyes lit up as he looked at the few in his hand, "Sir, this photo of you and your son is the most beautiful one I’ve taken tonight. It seems that tonight’s winner will definitely be you." 
Ou Mucen glanced at the photo, briefly scanning it before tucking it away, "No need for the prize, but thank you for taking these photos for us tonight. Here, apart from the bill, the rest is for you," he said. 
After speaking, he took out a card from his wallet and handed it over. 
My goodness! 
Is it trendy now to tip with bank cards? How wealthy is he? 
Ye Ning’s mouth hung open in disbelief at what she was seeing. 
The photographer and greeter grabbed the bank card from the young man’s hand almost as if they were stealing it, "Thank you so much, sir. Don’t worry, whether you participate or not, we’ll still give you the prize." 
Then, they walked away as if possessed, cradling the bank card. 
Inside, Ye Ning was green with envy, "How much did you tip them?" 
"Not much, just tens of thousands!" 
Damn! 
Tens of thousands... just like that! 
Ye Ning felt like spitting blood, glaring at him with her slightly rosy cheeks flushed from the wine, all expressions of dissatisfaction, "You’re really too generous to others. I’m your assistant, and I only make a little over ten thousand a month, yet you tip a few service staff with tens of thousands in one go." 
Ou Mucen held the photos, his gaze deep as he looked at her, "What? You think your salary’s too low?" 
Ye Ning threw caution to the wind, "What do you think?" 
The man pondered for a moment, "Then how about this? If you take on the additional job of cleaning my house, I’ll add another ten thousand to your pay." 
Pah! 
This evil capitalist, this exploiter! 
Why doesn’t he drop dead? 
Ye Ning ignored him and continued to focus on her meal. 
The man across from her saw that she was ignoring him, her cheeks puffed with irritation as she buried her head in her food. He too lowered his gaze to the two photos in his hand. 
One was of the three of them together, and the other was just him with the child. 
If the greeter had said downstairs that he and the child looked alike, and he wasn’t too sure when he saw the small face, now, as he compared himself and the child side by side, he could definitely see they had the exact same eyes. 
Indeed, the child’s most similar feature to his was the eyes! 
He remembered his mother once said that when he was born, his eyes were also very beautiful, and his grandfather’s favoritism towards him was largely due to these eyes. 
But now, he seemed to see a reflection of his younger self in this child. 
Stunning double eyelids, within them, a pair of gleaming black pupils, like the vast night sky—focused, they were like clear water, twinkling like stars. 
If there had to be something different between his own eyes and those of the child, it was that his eyes, after experiencing so much of the world, had grown to include the shrewdness of human relationships and a cold indifference. 
Whereas these remained untainted, a vision of pure innocence...
###Chapter 520: Chapter 520 He Suddenly Realized That He Seemed to Have Been Closely Imitated 6
He just stared at the photo for a long, long time. In the end, unable to control himself, he quickly snapped a picture with his phone while the woman opposite him wasn’t paying attention, and then found a WeChat contact to send it to. 
"What do you think of the resemblance?" 
"..." 
After sending the WeChat message, his finger suddenly twitched. He didn’t know what was wrong, but inside his chest, his usually steady heartbeat suddenly skipped a beat, and he began to feel nervous. 
Time passed, several minutes after sending the WeChat message, and there was still no reply. 
Seeing this, he couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed. So, he put his phone away. Just then, Ye Ning and the child had finished eating. He got up to tidy their belongings and left the place with the child and the woman. 
"You’ve had some alcohol, I’ll have Ying Hao take you back," Ou Mucen said as they left the hotel. Ye Ning was planning to drive herself back, but considering she had had a few glasses of wine, Mucen decided to have Ying Hao drive her. 
Hearing this, Ye Ning didn’t refuse and got into Ying Hao’s car with the child. 
Watching the mother and child leave, Ou Mucen then drove back to the hospital. 
Arriving at the hospital, he was about to wash up and rest when, all of a sudden, his phone "dinged". He paused for a moment when he heard it and then immediately picked up his phone. 
As expected, the message in WeChat was from the person he had sent the photo to at the hotel. However, when he opened it, he saw a line that caught him completely off guard. 
"Damn! Really f*cking similar, looks like my guess was right, he must be your son!!" 
"..." 
What is he talking about? 
There he stood, the normally quick-witted man was stuck dumb for several seconds after reading that sentence. 
Son? 
That bastard said he’s definitely his son? 
Finally, his chest began to rise and fall. He stopped chatting on WeChat and took out his phone to make a call, "Hello, it’s Ou Mucen, what did you mean just now? Why are you saying he’s my son?" noveldrama
"Damn! Didn’t you send me a picture earlier? If he’s not your son, how can you two look so alike?" 
"Looking alike means he’s my son? There are many people who look alike in this world, are you saying they all have blood relations?" 
"No, man, there are lots of things about him that are like you too. For example, he also doesn’t eat sweets, and he doesn’t eat beans either, just like you, right?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
Standing in the hospital room, he stared out the window at the myriad lights, his tall and straight figure frozen as if struck by lightning, with something seemingly surging wildly in his eyes. The whole room was enveloped in an atmosphere that felt like it was on the brink of exploding. 
"And then?" 
"Then I secretly did a paternity test for you and the kid without telling you. I was planning to tell you the good news after the results came out, but you already found out today, which is also good. I’m coming back tomorrow. Once I get back and fetch the report, you can acknowledge your son." 
The person on the phone was even teasing him, acting as if finding out he had a son was more exciting for him than for Mucen himself. 
All of a sudden, Ou Mucen found it hard to breathe. His blood seemed unable to withstand the shock of the unexpected news, making his head spin. He tugged at his necktie and didn’t feel relief until he had undone the top button.
###Chapter 521: Chapter 521 He Suddenly Realized That He Seemed to Have Been Closely Imitated 7
Son? 
He said Little Baozi is really his son? 
How is this possible? He never had any interaction with that woman. How could that child be his? 
His mind buzzed incessantly; he couldn’t calm down... 
Listening to his heavy breathing over the phone, Ji Chengzhi couldn’t help feeling a bit jealous, "Take it easy, haha, although this is good news, you must remember, you are a patient now, and getting too emotional isn’t good." 
"When are you coming back?" Suddenly, this question came through the phone. 
Ji Chengzhi, feeling helpless, repeated himself, "Didn’t I tell you? Tomorrow, I’ll be back tomorrow..." 
"Tonight, I give you five hours. If I wake up in the morning and don’t see you, then you can shut down this hospital." 
"Ou Mucen, you son of a bitch!!!" 
After shouting just that, the phone line went silent, angering Ji Chengzhi so much he nearly smashed his phone to pieces. 
This bastard, this scum, this animal!! 
How could he be so ungrateful? Is he even human? Ou Mucen, you beast!! 
—— 
After Ye Ning had Ying Hao drop her and Xiaobao off at the apartment complex where they lived, she saw it was getting late and let Ying Hao leave. She carried Xiaobao up the stairs. 
She still lived in the same place partly because she hadn’t found another suitable place to stay and partly because she didn’t want to be too heartless. This place was found by Lin Yebai for her; moving out might be too cruel to him. 
Carrying the small child up, she became tired: "Baby, why did you want to sleep so early today? Mama is so tired from carrying you." 
Like a little puppy on her back, Ye Xiaobao comfortably rubbed his face: "Baozi ate too much, and when you eat enough, you sleep. That’s how you grow meaty." 
Pff! 
What kind of logic is that? noveldrama
Ye Ning was utterly defeated by this little rascal. Having carried him all the way up to their door, she immediately dug out her keys to unlock it. 
But to her surprise, when she inserted her key into the lock, she discovered the door wasn’t locked. 
Strange, why isn’t the door locked? 
A bad feeling suddenly popped up in her heart. She quickly woke the child on her back, put him down, and slowly pushed the door open... 
"Finally decided to come back? You seem to have had a good Mid-Autumn Festival!" 
Shocked, when she pushed the door open, she saw a woman sitting in her tiny living room! 
And that woman, with her chestnut-colored curled hair and wearing high-end custom-made dresses adorned with expensive jewelry, shot a cold and fierce look at her the moment she appeared. 
It was Bai Tingfang!! 
Seeing her, Ye Ning’s face turned pale, and she immediately pulled her son behind her. 
Why has she come here? 
Oh God! 
She couldn’t possibly know something, could she? 
A cold sweat broke out in Ye Ning’s palms: "Madam Ou, how come you have time to visit my home?" 
"That’s a question for you. You’ve kidnapped my son, made him miss the family reunion dinner at home, naturally, I had to come here, to see how my son is keeping you company. So? Are you happy with how he served you tonight? Are you satisfied with his company?"
###Chapter 522: Chapter 522 He Suddenly Realized That He Seemed to Have Been Closely Imitated 8
She sat there, smiling elegantly, her countenance resembling that of the man’s, also filled with grace and nobility, as if her visit tonight was truly just to enquire about her happiness? 
However, after Ye Ning glanced at her, she clearly saw in her eyes the same coldness and fierceness of a snake, a look as if, in the next second, she would tear her into shreds. 
In fact, that was the case! 
Because a few months ago, she had already been taken onto that small boat and warned by her people. She still remembered the words she said, which were to stop her from setting her sights on that man, or else, she would make her regret it. 
So, was she here now to make her regret it? 
Ye Ning began to back away, and when she saw her gaze suddenly fixate on the child behind her, she instantly squatted down and fiercely protected him in her arms, "Mrs. Ou, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m Third Young Master’s assistant, isn’t it normal for him to invite me out for a meal during the Mid-Autumn festival?" 
"Is that so? Is it really just that simple, that he’s only invited you for a meal?" 
She finally stood up, in an ivory embroidered high-end custom gown, with the latest high-fashion shoes on her feet. She moved away from the sofa, striding towards her with steps that were both elegant and noble. 
"Alright then, since you say he’s only invited you for a meal, why don’t you explain to me what all of this is about?" 
She bent down and looked down at her with an air of superiority, and her assistant next to her promptly took out a stack of photos and threw them in front of Ye Ning. 
Ye Ning held her child tightly all the while. When she saw those photos thrown down, she did not pick them up but simply lowered her head to look at the ground. With that one look, her heart sank even deeper into despair. noveldrama
Those were photos of her intimately spending the day with that man! 
One was when she was running down the stairs of Longfeng Tower, the man chased after her, and the photo captured him pinning her against the wall, then leading her away. 
There were also photos from the dinner with him in the restaurant that evening, very intimate and sweet, including the moment the three of them entered the hotel, which was also captured head-on. 
Ye Ning finally fell silent, just holding her child tightly in her arms. 
Bai Tingfang, having seen enough, could not hold back any longer. With a "smack," she raised her hand and gave her a fierce slap, "Slut! You think you can play me? Pretending one way in the open, another in secret, thinking I’m easy to fool?" 
Ye Ning was completely unprepared, and suddenly, with that slap, she instantly felt a sharp pain in her ear and cheek. Her entire face was turned to the side by the slap, and within a second, she tasted blood in her mouth. 
"Mommy! Why did you hit my mommy? You bad woman!" 
Ye Xiaobao, held in her arms, was also stunned by the slap. Seeing his mother slapped so hard that her entire body twisted to one side, blood coming from her mouth, his small face immediately turned up in angry accusation towards this woman. 
Ye Ning had not yet recovered, but suddenly hearing her son’s voice and fearing he would be implicated, she immediately dismissed her own pain and pulled her child tightly back into her embrace, "Xiaobao, Xiaobao don’t speak!" 
While speaking, she firmly held her own child.
###Chapter 523: Chapter 523 He Suddenly Realized That He Seemed to Have Been Closely Imitated 9
She knew the child was smart, and she knew he was brave, for his mother’s sake, he was fearless. 
But the woman in front of her was mad, and he was just a four-year-old child, how could he fight against this woman. 
Ye Ning hugged him tightly, "Bai Tingfang, I’m telling you, your son is a person, not your possession. Who he likes and who he wants to be with, you have no right to control." 
"What did you say? Say that again?" 
"Even if I say it a hundred times, it’s the same, Bai Tingfang, I do love your son, and your son loves me too. We love each other, what’s wrong with that? Just because you’re his mother, do you think you can interfere in his life? You don’t have that right!" 
"Bitch! I’m going to kill you!" noveldrama
Slap!! 
No sooner had she spoken these words than another slap landed, only this time it was harder, and after slapping her, she also kicked her. 
Ye Ning was shocked and quickly pushed her son out of the way; she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen and curled up in agony. 
"Mommy! Mommy!!" 
Ye Xiaobao began to cry loudly upon seeing this and rushed over, his small body trying to help his mother up, but at this moment, Bai Tingfang, upon seeing the child, suddenly flashed a vicious look in her eyes and rushed over to pick him up just as he reached his mother. 
"Mommy—" 
"Bai Tingfang, what are you doing? Let go of him, I warn you... If you hurt him, I won’t let you off!" 
Ye Ning, curled up on the ground, saw her child seized by the madwoman and forgot her pain, propping herself up with effort from the ground. 
However, the woman’s actions were too quick; in less than a minute, she had carried the child out to the balcony of the living room. "I don’t have the right, huh? Fine, I’ll throw your son down from here now, let’s see if I have the right or not?" 
Having said that, her hand was about to loosen! 
Ye Ning, seeing this, shuddered violently, and a piercing scream burst forth from her throat, "Don’t!!!" 
That was her child, her life—how could this heartless, deranged woman do this? 
She charged over, ignoring the blockage of several strong assistants in the living room. Like a madwoman, she scratched, roared, and grappled, all to save the child. 
Bai Tingfang, I swear, if you kill him, I’ll make sure your entire family joins him in death, I mean what I say... and I do what I say! 
The intense struggle lasted a full five minutes, until finally, Xiaoxia in the living room couldn’t stand it anymore and approached the window ledge, "Madam, it’s enough to scare her, if you really go through with it, the young master won’t forgive you if he finds out." 
Upon hearing this, the hand of the woman holding the child finally stopped. 
Ye Ning, who was vigorously scratching at them in the living room, saw that the woman had finally stopped, and she too ceased, then stared fixedly at her with blood-red eyes. 
"Scared? I told you, if you dare deceive me, I will make you regret it!" 
Bai Tingfang looked at the woman in the living room—who she had tortured until she was barely recognizable—and felt an uncommon satisfaction in her heart. 
Yes, Bai Tingfang was someone no one dared oppose, because those who opposed her only had one path—death! 
Ye Ning did not speak, but as soon as she saw her child brought down by the assistant, she immediately pounced like a mother wolf, snatching her small bundle into her arms and quickly retreated to one side.
###Chapter 524: Chapter 524 He Suddenly Realized That He Seemed to Have Been Closely Imitated 10
"Xiaobao, Xiaobao are you alright? Xiaobao?" 
She held him in her arms and saw that the child—who had just bravely assisted her—was now scared to the point of not being able to utter a single word. Her heart was instantly filled with both pain and anger, embracing him as the tears began to roll down uncontrollably. 
She was not strong, nor invincible. She was just a woman, and a mother to a child. Faced with such a situation, with no one to bear it for her, what could she do besides hold her child and helplessly weep? 
Bai Tingfang still stared at her coldly, seeing that the woman had lost her earlier defiance after such a fright, she was satisfied... 
"You’re right; I indeed have no right to interfere in my son’s life, but as his mother, I have the qualification to help him live a better life. You, as a widow with a child, do you think you’re worthy of him? Do you think that marrying him will bring honor to his face?" 
"..." 
She was actually, bringing this up to her! 
Ye Ning, with her son in her arms, her face streaked with tears, suddenly stiffened. noveldrama
"You say that you and he are in love, yes, right now you are in love, but what about after you’re married? Your status, your background, what can you give him besides shame? He is the Crown Prince of the Ou Group, a prominent figure in A City. Do you want to make him the biggest joke of this city? To reject all the wealthy young ladies and choose to marry a widow, a single mother—I ask you, is this how you love him?" 
Bai Tingfang looked at the woman, not quite with sarcasm, nor with insults, but undeniably, the expression in her eyes was no longer as vicious and fierce as before. Instead, it was something else. 
A cleverer way. 
Yes, she knew that if she really came on strongly, with her son’s intelligence, once he found out, not only would he not let go of this woman, he would hate his mother and become even more determined to be with her. 
So, the best method was to make this woman willingly give up her son! 
At last, Bai Tingfang said a few more words, then she had her assistant bring over a thick envelope and lay it in front of Ye Ning: "I hope this is the last time I see you. If there is a next time, I can assure you, what you’ll see will be the corpse of your child!" 
Afterward, she left with her entourage. 
Ye Ning sat on the balcony floor holding her child, for a long, long time, until in the night touched by the cold autumn wind, mother and child huddled together... 
— 
Ou Mucen had barely slept that night, too excited to calm his mind. He could only toss and turn on his hospital bed, his eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling above. 
It was a truly unexpected thing. That child—could he really be his son? 
He lay there, slowly recalling the times over the years he had been intimate with a woman. 
He was a man with a strong sense of purity, usually not touching people, not just physically but also spiritually. So, if he had to say there was one woman he had been intimate with, it would be La Chenxi from his college days. 
But he and La Chenxi had not slept together; even kissing was rare, not to mention anything more. 
That left that one time five years ago in a hotel.
###Chapter 525: Chapter 525 DNA Reports are Out... 1
That incident from five years ago was actually an accident. That evening, after having a bit of alcohol for social obligations, he felt a bit unwell and had Secretary Gao book a room for him, wishing to rest for a while. 
However, when he got to the room with the key card, he saw someone lying on the bed. Later, when he wanted to leave, his head had already become heavy and drowsy. 
So, he himself didn’t even know what had happened. 
It wasn’t until he woke up in the room later that Secretary Gao came to find him and told him that his room had been sprayed with a love potion mist. 
"It looks like someone was out to get you, Third Young Master." Upon discovering the substance, Secretary Gao’s first reaction was just that. 
He was no exception, so in the following days, all he did was wait for the person who wanted to harm him to appear and had Secretary Gao spare no expense in investigating the matter. 
Yet, what was eerie for both of them was that after the incident, everything calmed down unexpectedly. Not only did the person who they thought wanted to harm him not show up, but even the woman he had been with had vanished without a trace. noveldrama
All that was left from that morning was a blood-stained sheet, nothing else, not even the surveillance cameras revealed anything. 
Therefore, the matter had remained an unsolved case, and as the years passed, he gradually forgot about it. 
But now, a son of his had suddenly appeared. Could the woman from that night possibly be her?!! 
Thinking of this, his heart became even more unsettled. He simply got up from the sickbed, went to the small desk, turned on his laptop, and logged into the game page he hadn’t visited for a long time. 
Langya Pavilion: Message alert, Pavilion Master Third Young Master has logged in!
In Langya Pavilion, where people were slaying enemies overnight, everything suddenly went silent... 
Young Master Zhan: "What the hell? It’s Mid-Autumn Festival today!" 
Master Xia: "You’re kidding, Ghost Festival has already passed, hasn’t it..." 
The Most Beautiful Lady of Langya Pavilion: "..." 
Third Young Master: "What are you all doing?" 
Young Master Zhan: "..." 
Master Xia: "..." 
However, the first beauty regained her composure quickly and hurriedly typed out a string of characters: "Getting ready to go to the Magic Capital Domain to hunt monsters. It’s said that a set of equipment has appeared, and whoever wins will obtain the path." 
Third Young Master: "Sure, let’s go together!" 
As soon as the message was sent, that silver-white figure immediately turned into a streak of white light and vanished on the street, leaving the few people nearby almost dropping their jaws in astonishment. 
Master Xia: "Am I seeing things? Is that really him? What time is it, and he’s actually logged on?" 
Young Master Zhan: "Isn’t he still in the hospital?" 
The Most Beautiful Lady: "..." 
After a long silence, she finally typed a few characters: "Quick, catch up to him. He’s already gone in." 
Thus, the trio hurriedly followed after. 
Sure enough, upon reaching the Magic Capital Domain, that silver-white figure wielding the Heavenly Stem was already slaughtering away. His movements were extremely fast, and his killing power was fierce, a level of skill that only a top-notch expert would possess. 
When the other members of Langya Pavilion saw this, they were instantly overjoyed! 
It had been so long, and just because this bastard didn’t show up, their once-infamous number one faction on the streets had sadly become third-rate. Now, at last, their pavilion master had arrived, let’s see how they would die? 
So, the group also started to join the battle, and a fierce fight ensued for a full hour. After one hour, the whole server rang with the message of "Langya Pavilion’s" victory, and everyone finally ceased their fighting.
###Chapter 526: Chapter 526 DNA Reports are Out... 2
First Beauty: "Third Young Master, are you okay? You’re in the hospital right now. Playing games so late at night, won’t it affect your health?" 
Emperor Third Young Master: "..." 
Master Xia: "First Beauty, how do you know the Third Young Master is in the hospital?" 
Suddenly, her avatar turned gray, then, not long after, it flickered. Then it turned gray again, and flickered, going back and forth several times...... 
Master Zhan: "What’s wrong with this girl? Is it a poor connection or is her battery dead?" 
Master Xia: "I don’t know..." 
Emperor Third Young Master: "I’m signing off now, next time, I don’t want to see her again." 
Then, with a click of his slender finger on the mouse, he logged out of his account. 
Jicheng, if you don’t appear in this hospital room before dawn, I swear, you will die a very ugly death! 
He slammed his laptop shut with a "snap". The anger rising in his chest finally calmed the excitement that had previously occupied his mind. Afterwards, he returned to his hospital bed and, after tossing and turning for so long, finally fell asleep as dawn was nearing. 
Two hours later, Chengzhi finally appeared at the hospital entrance, hurriedly carrying his luggage. 
The assistant, who had been informed early in the morning, was already waiting for him at the entrance. Seeing him return, he immediately came over to take his luggage, "Director, why did you come back so early? Wasn’t your flight supposed to arrive in the afternoon?" 
All because of that lunatic. 
Chengzhi, with dark circles under his eyes, said irritably, "I rushed back to see that bastard in the hospital room. Where is he?" 
That bastard in the hospital room? 
The assistant, who was baffled by the scolding, said, "You mean the Third Young Master in the VIP ward? He’s fine. I just went to check on him; he seems to still be asleep." 
Damn! 
Grandson! 
He made him rush over during the night, yet he himself was still sound asleep. 
Chengzhi, his eyes bloodshot, really wanted to lose his temper, but after a moment of thought, he asked another question, "Right, the DNA report I asked you to do, has the result come out?" 
The assistant quickly nodded, "It’s out, it came out the day before yesterday." 
Chengzhi’s heart skipped a beat, "Really? So, what’s the result? Is it his biological child?" 
His biological child? 
Indeed, the reason the Director had it tested was to find his child. 
Hearing this, the assistant stopped and his expression became very cautious, "Director, I think it’s better not to rush about this. After all, there will always be children; you’re still so young." 
Chengzhi’s eyes widened in alarm, "What do you mean? What ’there will still be children’?" 
The assistant gave him a look, "Isn’t it? You had me do the test to find your child, didn’t you? Now that it has been proven that the child isn’t yours, Director Ji can try again." 
What a load of nonsense!! noveldrama
Having barely slept all night, Chengzhi’s mood worsened upon hearing this, and he didn’t bother continuing the conversation. He headed directly upstairs to the laboratory. 
When he arrived at the lab, and got the identification report, he truly discovered that the medical conclusion on it read "exclusion of parental relationship". 
Exclusion of parental relationship?!! 
How could this be? 
This can’t be, right? 
Upon seeing these words, he stared for a long, long time, unable to recover his senses, and his expression was filled with shock and disbelief. 
Indeed, it was unbelievable. The child bore such a resemblance to him; there were so many similarities. How could it not be his child? Even as a doctor, he couldn’t believe it. 
PS: Warm reminder, no one has tampered with this report...
###Chapter 527: Chapter 527 DNA Reports are Out... 3
"Director? You..." 
"I’m asking you, have these two blood samples been tampered with or left unattended during the testing process? Have they?!!" 
He suddenly seized his assistant by the collar, and those bloodshot eyes of his looked terrifying. 
The assistant was scared stiff, staring at the director whose face had changed in an instant, nearly fainting from fear: "No, absolutely not, Director, you entrusted this to me, even if I had the audacity, I wouldn’t dare make a mistake." 
"Then why would the results turn out this way?" 
"I..." 
The assistant had intended to say that if it isn’t a true parent-child match, the DNA test would certainly yield such a result. 
But upon seeing the horrifying and fierce expression of the man grabbing his collar, he changed his tune: "If the Director doesn’t believe it, you can verify it yourself, then you’ll know if I made a mistake!" 
Ji Chengzhi was stunned! 
For him to personally conduct the test? So that means he indeed did not touch those two blood samples? 
Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to say that so boldly. 
If it wasn’t his mistake, then why would the DNA report yield such a result? 
Finally, Ji Chengzhi slowly released the wrist that had been clutching at his collar, and then, he stared down at the DNA report in his hand as if it were struck by frost, standing there for a long, long time without moving. 
Ou Mucen woke up in the hospital room and heard the news half an hour later. Hearing that he had returned, he immediately got out of the hospital bed and headed downstairs. In the cool autumn season, he didn’t even bother to put on a coat before he tried to find him. 
But at that moment, the assistant who came to summon him saw him frantically searching for the Director and advised on the side: "Third Young Master, maybe you should wait a bit longer before seeing him, he’s in a very bad mood right now." 
"Why?" 
"It’s about that DNA report. Third Young Master, you don’t know, not long ago, he had me do a paternity test for him, and when the results came out, they indicated there was no parent-child relationship." 
"What did you say? No parent-child relationship?" 
It was as if a thunderbolt had suddenly struck from the blue sky. The man who was about to leave, all his expressions, including his footsteps, froze right there. 
No parent-child relationship?
Why would that be? Hadn’t Chengzhi been so sure? 
In an instant, he stood there, the previous urge to rush out and find his friend extinguished, as if a cold bucket of water had been poured over him, chilling him to the bone in mere moments. 
The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment! 
At this moment, he finally understood what it meant to go from heaven to hell. noveldrama
Standing at the door, not knowing how long he had been there, he then robotically asked, "Where is he now? Where?" 
"He’s still in the testing department. I told him to go back to the office to rest, but he won’t leave." 
"Alright, I got it, you go ahead with your work, I’ll handle this," he said, then with his legs feeling like lead, he took one step after another out of the hospital room. 
In fact, he had considered this outcome the night before. 
He was always a very rational person. When faced with things that could cause a great emotional upheaval, he would often calmly plan a contingency, so as to be mentally prepared in case any unexpected situation arose.
###Chapter 528: Chapter 528 DNA Reports are Out... 4
So, last night, he considered what he would do if the child wasn’t his. 
As a result, he, of course, in his usual calm style, simply analyzed it and then thought little of it. 
Yet, he hadn’t expected that when he actually heard this unexpected news, his mood would be so terrible, so awful. 
Coming out of the ward, in about a ten-minute walk, he found that man in the main building’s testing department of the hospital, and at that moment, he hadn’t left yet and was leaning against the railing by the corridor, smoking. 
It was truly a very dejected expression, his hair messy, his complexion pale, even his clothes were wrinkled, emitting a strong smell of smoke and a sour stench. 
So, how long had it been since he had taken a bath? 
He walked over, noticed that the man did not see him, and no one spoke, so he directly took that report from his hands. 
Jicheng was smoking. Suddenly, he felt a lightness in his hand, and his gaze immediately turned to the side, "Mu...Mucen? Why are you here?" 
He panicked immediately, nearly dropping the cigarette from his hand. 
Ou Mucen didn’t pay attention to him. The smell of the pungent smoke filled his nostrils as he glanced over the identification report, "Excluded from paternity... this means, he and I are not related." 
"Mucen, listen to me, this matter... there’s still something fishy about it; I need to investigate thoroughly," Jicheng immediately felt guiltier and more self-reproachful upon seeing him, promptly extinguishing his cigarette and eagerly starting to explain. 
But what about this man? 
He simply took a casual glance at him and handed the thin piece of paper back, "No need, this was an impossible thing to begin with. It was your love for drama that led you to this." 
Drama? 
Chengzhi’s eyes suddenly widened, "How is that possible? He looks so much like you around the eyes; he even dislikes sweets and beans just like you. How could he possibly not be your son?" 
"How could he possibly be mine? I never slept with his mother; where would the child come from?" 
Jicheng was choked up! 
He hadn’t slept with her? 
Then... then... 
Suddenly Jicheng realized he had no rebuttal at all... 
Indeed, during this time, he only remembered having the child’s DNA tested, but he forgot to ask this man whether he had ever slept with the woman. 
If they hadn’t slept together, where would the child come from? 
He started to waver, standing there, staring at the test report in his hand for a long time before he asked, not ready to give up, "Are you really sure you haven’t? Could it be you just don’t remember?" 
"What do you mean?" 
"No no no, don’t get me wrong, what I mean is... could it be possible you two had intercourse? And yet you are unaware?" 
"Crazy!" 
This time, the man, whose complexion had already reached the extreme of awful, couldn’t even be bothered to placate him anymore and, after glaring at him fiercely, he turned and walked away. noveldrama
Chengzhi stood there, dazedly watching, taking a long time to recover his senses. 
His reaction was somewhat strange. Just last night, he was the one urging him to come back quickly, saying that if he didn’t return by dawn, he would have his hospital shut down. 
But why now, knowing such a result, was his reaction so indifferent? Did he not wish the child to be his? 
Quietly watching that figure growing more distant, it was at this moment he noticed that the man’s usually steady and strong stride was off today, very stiff and awkward.
###Chapter 529: Chapter 529 DNA Reports are Out... 5
He walked forward like a robot, devoid of any hint of vitality. 
Right, he couldn’t be displeased. Last night, it was he who had initiated sending the photo to him, and after he responded on WeChat, he immediately called him, and upon hearing that he had gotten a paternity test report, he even demanded that he come back right away. 
All the signs indicated that he wasn’t displeased, but rather, he was holding back. 
Holding back the disappointment and pain deep in his heart, so as not to burden him! 
Finally, Ji Chengzhi realized what was going on, and in an instant, he slapped himself before tearing the test report to shreds and throwing it into the trash can, then he stood at the door of the testing lab once again. 
"Director..." 
"The two blood samples I asked you to test before, do you still have them?" 
"Yes, Director, are you really suspecting me? I can swear..." 
"Alright, you don’t need to say anymore, I know it’s not your fault. Go get the two blood samples, and also give me every single analysis report from this paternity test, I want to see them." 
"Yes, Director!" 
Relieved by what he said, the assistant went to his personal safety deposit fridge and took out the two securely stored blood samples. 
Ji Chengzhi indeed trusted this assistant hadn’t tampered with anything because if he had, he wouldn’t have been so calm, and he wouldn’t have brought out the blood samples without any hesitation when asked. 
Thus, the only thing he suspected was whether there was a problem with the blood samples? noveldrama
However, to his surprise, when he reanalyzed the two blood samples, he found nothing wrong with them, whether it was their cellular molecular structure or their activity level, everything met the standards. 
Furthermore, after the assistant showed him the data reports and imaging records from the time of the test, they also proved that no sample swapping had occurred during the process. From beginning to end, they had always been those two blood samples. 
Then why was the result as it was? 
He sat in front of the microscope, staring at the drop of red liquid inside and fell into deep thought... 
He did not believe the result, not for any other reason but for the stiffness of that man the moment he left just now. 
He said he had never slept with that woman. Then why was he in such a hurry for him to come over? And why was he so stiff when he left? His mouth spoke irrelevant words, but his body was so rigid? 
The only answer was that he had slept with that woman! 
Even though he was not certain, he still had his suspicions. 
He rotated the blood sample and suddenly, under the microscope, he saw a red blood cell begin to separate, instantly splitting into two. He paused for a moment, and a thought flashed through his mind. 
"Xiaoluo, when you were preparing the DNA report, did you check his chromosomes?" 
Chromosomes?
The assistant standing behind him had a flicker in his eyes: "No, we don’t need to do that for DNA testing." 
That was exactly the answer he had been waiting for! 
After hearing it, he immediately turned around as if he had grasped a lifeline, "Go now and get a vial of venous blood from the third young master, remember, just say it’s for a check-up, don’t tell him anything else." 
The assistant was stunned! 
Draw blood from the third young master? Why? 
But in that moment of stupefaction, the Director had already started yelling: "What are you still doing here? Go, now!"
###Chapter 530: Chapter 530 DNA Reports are Out... 6
"Oh, oh, oh, I’m on it!" 
The assistant, having been yelled at like that, hurriedly proceeded to do so. 
What exactly was the director doing? One moment he was talking about chromosomes, the next he was ordering him to get blood drawn from the third young master Ou. What was he up to?
The assistant was very confused... 
— 
Meanwhile, Ou Mucen, on the other hand, had no idea what his friend from the laboratory department was doing after he left; he only knew that once he returned to the ward, he didn’t want to say anything. 
He didn’t want to move, speak, drink water, or eat anything... 
He didn’t want to call that woman either! 
It was a terrible feeling; he had never felt such a thing in his life, as if all the colors he could see with his eyes had turned into a lifeless, dull grey, so devoid of life and vitality that it was exceptionally distasteful to behold. 
Is this what it feels like when hope is shattered? 
He picked up the two photos from the desk and began to scrutinize them again. 
Chengzhi was right; the child did indeed resemble him a lot, especially after being pointed out, the similarity seemed even more apparent. 
But, what did that matter? He was ultimately of no relation! 
A trace of pain flickered in his eyes, and his slender fingers tensed as they twisted the photo, as if only by doing so could he quelch the indignation and pain in his heart. 
Yes, how much he wished the woman he had taken that night was her. 
He didn’t know how long he had been doing this, until the window outside began to drizzle with a fine, misty rain, and the cold strands mixed with the chilly wind blew onto his face. He looked up only to realize that the sky outside had indeed turned a murky grey. 
"Third Master, why are you sitting here? It’s raining; be careful not to catch a cold." It was Jicheng’s assistant. 
Ou Mucen didn’t move, instead staring up at the drifting rain outside. This city hadn’t seen rain in a long time; he remembered the last time it had rained was when he and she had gone to B City. He hadn’t expected that so much time had passed since then. 
"Third Master, I’m going to draw some blood for testing, okay? The director said that after one last check, if everything’s fine, you can be discharged," the assistant said, his heart racing as he saw the man, exuding a cold aura, sitting motionless by the window. He tentatively approached him. 
Fortunately, Mucen had no reaction to the request, so the assistant finally drew some blood from the vein in his wrist and then pressed down on it. 
"Third Master, which assistant of yours didn’t come today? Do you want me to call a nurse to take care of you?" 
"..." 
Assistant? noveldrama
Upon hearing these two words, he finally snapped back to reality, and so he looked up at the assistant: "What time is it now?" 
The assistant glanced at his watch: "It’s just past 12:00; you haven’t eaten breakfast yet, have you? Do you want me to buy you something?" 
He withdrew his gaze, saying emotionlessly, "No need!" Then he picked up the mobile phone from the desk, found a number, and dialed it. 
It was already noon, and he hadn’t even noticed. Where was that woman? Why hadn’t she come today? She wouldn’t have gone to Longfeng again, would she? 
Finally, his senses returned, and he sat there, quietly listening to the sound of the call connecting. After waiting for roughly ten seconds, someone answered, "Hello..." 
"What are you doing?" 
"Cleaning up. I’ve been busy these past few days, and a lot of cleaning hasn’t been done around the room." 
The voice on the phone sounded tired and a bit hoarse. He wondered what she was doing?
###Chapter 531: Chapter 531 DNA Reports are Out... 7
He heard her, didn’t think much about it, and with a furrow in his brow, blurted out, "Why do you even need to bother with that? I’ll get you a cleaner." 
Having said that, he was about to hang up the phone and arrange for someone to go over. 
But the woman on the other end, upon hearing this, became anxious and hurriedly called out on the phone, "No need, no need, I’m almost done, no trouble to anyone." 
Almost done? noveldrama
When he heard this, he paused and wanted to say something else, but as he looked at the two photos in his hand, all his words got stuck in his throat, and he just sat there holding his phone, listening to the zapping electrical sound in his ear. 
The child wasn’t his, then whose was it? 
His eyes were as dim as that patch of thick fog on the horizon that wouldn’t disperse... 
On the other end of the phone, the woman hadn’t hung up either. She too was listening to the electrical noise over the phone, and his breathing. 
His breaths were deep and forceful, she could almost feel his heat from over here. 
Suddenly, she looked fiercely out the window with her phone in hand, "Ou Mucen, when will you be discharged from the hospital?" 
Be discharged? 
The man holding the phone on this end, upon hearing this, replied offhandedly, "Should be tomorrow, I guess. Jicheng just came back, said I could be discharged if the check-up was okay." 
"Well then, I’ll pick you up from the hospital tomorrow, go to your house, and cook for you," she said with a laugh, her joy and cheer audible over the phone. 
Ou Mucen was taken aback when he heard this! 
Go to his house to cook for him? 
He suddenly remembered that breakfast, yes, the morning that for the first time he felt a presence in his apartment. 
That morning, the apartment was filled with inviting aromas, she was bustling in the kitchen, he sat by the dining table, and the little child sat beside him, his chubby little head bobbing, eating while his dark eyes looked at him. 
The child said, "Uncle, it’s really delicious." 
He also said, "Uncle, my mom’s cooking isn’t bad, right? Let her cook for you from now on." 
He was still talking, "..." 
Suddenly he didn’t want to think about anything anymore, holding the phone, he agreed, "Sure, but I don’t have anything at home." 
The woman on the phone laughed, "There is a little bit, the last cleaner bought some, but I’ll buy some more tomorrow. What do you want to eat?" 
"Anything!" 
"I can’t make ’anything,’ and don’t make it difficult for me; my culinary skills aren’t that great." 
"Then how about..." his handsome face suddenly flushed, "the last time, that one?" 
The woman on the phone was taken aback, "That one? Dumplings? You want to eat dumplings when you come home at night? They’re for breakfast." 
His face suddenly darkened, "Didn’t you say you would make whatever I wanted?" 
He’s actually getting upset? 
Hearing his tone, the woman on the phone finally compromised, and after this conversation, they didn’t see each other the whole day. She didn’t visit the hospital again, and he didn’t call her anymore. 
Perhaps, he felt that he needed some time to be alone at this moment. 
But that pause turned into a major incident the next day, the day he was supposed to be discharged. On the ninth floor of the hospital’s surgical ward, in room number 8, Yang Xueshan, the suspect under police watch, had escaped! 
Yang Xueshan had escaped? 
He was surprised when he heard this news in the ward, "How could she have run away? Weren’t the police watching outside?" 
Jicheng nodded, "That’s right, but there’s no one in that ward now, no one knows how she disappeared, and the police are conducting a search throughout the hospital. You probably won’t be able to leave for the time being, we have to wait until they’ve finished their search."
###Chapter 532: Chapter 532 DNA Reports are Out... 8
Ou Mucen glanced at the time and saw that it was still early, so he nodded, "It’s alright, being late doesn’t matter. By the way, what have you been up to these past days? Why are your eyes so red?" 
Ji Chengzhi smiled, wanting to say something, but in the end, he just found a random excuse to brush it off... 
His guess was indeed not wrong. There was something wrong with his chromosomes. All he needed to do next was to compare his blood sample with that child’s using a different test targeted at that particular gene to get the real results. 
But this, he couldn’t tell him before the results were out, otherwise, if there were any unexpected twists, he really couldn’t handle it a second time. 
After giving a few more instructions, he went back to the laboratory, while Ou Mucen waited in the hospital room to be discharged. 
He waited until almost three o’clock when the hospital finally quieted down. Then he took the discharge form and started calling the person who had promised to pick him up the day before on his mobile phone. 
"Beep... beep beep..." 
The phone rang for about ten seconds, but there was no answer. 
What’s going on? 
He put down his phone and glanced at the number, confirming he hadn’t dialled incorrectly. Then he tried calling a second time. 
However, what infuriated him was that even on the second call there was still no answer. Instead, at the door of the hospital room, upon hearing he could be discharged, suddenly several people appeared. noveldrama
"Son, I heard you can be discharged? That’s great. Mom has come specially to pick you up! And your dad, too!" 
Unexpectedly, it was his mother who came in, along with the old man he hadn’t spoken to since the Longfeng incident the day before the last. 
Ou Mucen, although disgruntled with his mother, couldn’t show it upon seeing the old man. So he got up from the chair, "Dad, what brings you here?" 
The old man suddenly glared, "What? You didn’t want me to come pick you up?" 
"No, I just feel that at your age, you shouldn’t have to bother with these matters." 
"Humph! You are my son, what’s wrong with me coming to pick you up? Is there anyone who dares to ?" The old man’s temper was still as explosive as ever, but after the Longfeng incident, everyone present could feel that he seemed much older. 
Ou Mucen, seeing this, finally stopped talking and left the hospital room for the servants to tidy up, then left with the two elders. 
Ou Mucen actually knew that his mother had brought the old man over this time to take him to Blue Mountain Villa. He had said before that when he was discharged, he didn’t want to go there and would rather go back to his own apartment. 
So today, the only way for them to take him back was to bring the old man here. 
On the way down from the inpatient department, before even leaving the building, Ou Mucen saw in the lobby a Rolls-Royce parked conspicuously. 
"Son, look, your dad has specially driven his car here to pick you up. You should now realize how much your dad loves you," Bai Tingfang clung to her son’s arm. Noticing his sullen face since coming downstairs, she quickly tried to appease him. 
Ou Mucen didn’t really want to entertain her. As they were about to exit, he took out his phone, intending to send out a message, when someone hurried past him, "Finally got a lead. The duty nurse on the ninth floor said that a nurse uniform went missing this morning."
###Chapter 533: Chapter 533 DNA Reports are Out... 9
"Nurse uniform?" 
"Yes, from this, it becomes clear that the person who helped the suspect escape must be a woman. Go back and check again, and make sure to find that woman before nightfall!" 
"Understood, Captain Hu!" 
The person spoke very rapidly, and after uttering these few sentences, immediately left the outpatient hall. 
Ou Mucen paused there, even his finger preparing to swipe across the phone screen stopped in place. 
When Bai Tingfang saw that he wasn’t moving, she leaned over, "What’s wrong? Mucen, did you leave something behind?" 
Ou Mucen took a glance around the hall, and after a long while, ultimately didn’t say anything. He then left the place, sending out a message as he did so, "I’m going home first, will return to the apartment tonight." 
After that, he turned off his phone and put it back in his pocket. 
Seeing this, Bai Tingfang didn’t say anything further, and, clutching his arm, got into the Rolls Royce with him. In a short while, the car disappeared from the hospital entrance. 
It was in this moment, from a concealed spot on the fourth floor above the hall, a pair of eyes emerged like a ghost, watching until the car finally drove away. Then the person, supporting an old lady hunched over with a stooped back, came out from hiding. 
"All done with the check-up, we can go back now." 
"Alrighty!" 
The stooped old lady didn’t look well, a cold sweat breaking out over her sallow face. 
Seeing this, the young woman with a face mask supported her and began walking towards the escalator. It was then that the phone she carried rang. She stopped and took out the phone. 
"I’m going home first, will return to the apartment tonight." 
A simple few words, as straightforward as he always was. 
The old lady being supported turned her eyes toward the young woman’s face, "I never expected, after all these years of us going round and round, that you would be the biggest winner." 
Her lips were tinged with the bitterness and self-mockery of a lost battle. 
The young woman looked at her coldly, without saying a word, and put the phone back. 
Driven by insane jealousy, with a hint of sarcasm, the old woman retorted, "But don’t get too pleased with yourself. Bai Tingfang is not as easy to deal with as Mei Liping. I toiled in that house for five years and got nowhere. Do you really think you can be accepted by that woman?" noveldrama
She was truly malicious, to say such things even now. 
Thus, a fierce look flashed in the girl’s eyes, and in an instant, her fingers dug into the bandaged area on the old woman’s back, "I guess you don’t want to kill that man anymore. In that case, I might as well finish you off right now!" 
"Ye Ning—" 
The old lady, tormented in such a manner, suddenly convulsed in pain. 
It was a pain worse than death! 
Finally, the old lady shrank down completely, "Alright, I’ll stop talking. You... let go of me!" 
She could never triumph over her, especially now while she was in her grasp. 
It was only after these submissive words that the woman let go of her, and finally, the two of them left the place smoothly. 
Many times, she had to admit that she was smarter than her, just like this time. She thought that after she had swapped her out of the sickroom, she would immediately take her and leave the hospital.
###Chapter 534: Chapter 533 DNA Reports are Out... 10
However, after she brought her out, instead of leaving, she took her to a utility room and, after dressing her up from head to toe, they brazenly stayed among the crowd seeking medical attention. 
As the saying goes, the most dangerous place is often the safest, and the police probably would never have guessed that the person they were looking for was right there in the hospital, sitting among the patients. 
This was her intelligence, this was her audacity. 
The old lady was escorted out by her, and outside, a blue Chevrolet was already waiting. The two of them got in, with the young girl driving and the old lady in the passenger seat. 
"The address!" 
"Xinrong Securities Company." 
There was no dawdling in their tone, the way they spoke was as straightforward as if they were strangers. 
Indeed, they had long become strangers. 
Hearing the destination, the girl gripping the steering wheel started the car, and soon, the Chevrolet dashed out from under the hospital’s watchful eyes.
Fifteen minutes later, at the city’s largest trust company. 
The girl following behind finally saw the woman who had shed her disguise scan her pupils with the infrared scanner, and with a "click," the bulletproof security vault opened. 
"Take everything, all of this is what you wanted!" With the vault finally open, the woman standing by the side pulled at the corner of her mouth and stepped aside. 
The girl in front of the vault suddenly trembled, overwhelmed by the ecstasy she had long dreamed of; seeing it materialize before her eyes, she momentarily forgot what to do next. 
Yes, she had waited far too long for this day, almost to the point of giving up hope, yet unexpectedly, all these things now lay before her. 
She stood there, staring at the contents of the vault for a long time, before finally turning her gaze to the woman beside her: "Why are you doing this? Wasn’t this your doing?" 
Yang Xueshan pulled at the corner of her mouth: "Indeed, why would I do this? I can’t even begin to address my hatred for you, so why would I hand it over to you?" 
She looked at the items inside the vault and then, one by one, began taking them out. 
"See this? This USB drive contains evidence of the man who framed you, the complete recording of him instructing you, and this, the perjured evidence he provided during your trial, it’s all here. Ye Ning, would you say I’ve been good to you?" noveldrama
She laughed like a lunatic, handing over each item to Ye Ning as she chuckled. 
Ye Ning’s expression was tense, but as she handed the items over, she accepted them, until finally, she passed over a box of videotapes as well. 
"This contains the full version of the video snippet you saw a few days ago. You’ve been wanting to find out who that man is, right? Watch this, and you’ll know who he is." 
"..." 
Staring at her, Ye Ning took a while before squeezing out a question, "What exactly are you trying to do? Is it worth dying over that scum?" 
She was indeed clever, guessing it right away! 
But what about this woman? 
Upon hearing her words, she suddenly began to chuckle: "Don’t you know yet? I am alive just to take him with me to the Underworld!"
###Chapter 535: Chapter 534: How grateful she is, that the man that night was him!1
Ye Ning’s face turned to an iron blue in an instant, "It doesn’t matter if you die, but what about your little brother? Don’t forget, he is still waiting for you to take care of him." 
Little brother? 
It would have been better not to mention this, but once she did, the woman laughed even more fiercely, "Ye Ning, are you concerned about me? Well then, how about this—if I die, you take care of my little brother, how about that?" 
"In your dreams!" 
Ye Ning snatched the thing in her hand fiercely, no longer paying her any attention, and turned to walk out. 
Concerned about her? 
She must be out of her mind to think that—someone like her, it would be good enough if Ye Ning didn’t kill her herself, let alone be concerned about her. noveldrama
Ye Ning, holding the in her hand, drove away from that place, while the woman in the trust company, seeing that retreating back disappear, watched as the smile on her face finally faded bit by bit. 
Ye Ning, in the end, you are still too kind-hearted, and that is the fundamental difference between you and me. When I become ruthless, I am completely cold-hearted, unmoved by any familial bonds. But when you become ruthless, no matter what, you still leave a little room for mercy. 
She tugged at the corner of her mouth, and finally, after wiping off the makeup from her face onto a tissue against the metal door of the safe, she too left the place. 
Ye Ning, after leaving the place, immediately started searching for an internet café at the roadside. 
She thought that after obtaining these things, she would immediately bring this evidence to the police, to clear her own name, but to her surprise, the first place she sought out after obtaining it was still an internet café. 
Yes, she finally did not want to deny it anymore; she wanted to know as soon as possible who the man was on that night. 
After driving around for a while, just a few minutes, she saw a small internet café with neon lights by the roadside, so she parked the car, and with those things, she went in. 
"Hello, do you have any available computers?" 
"Yes, your ID, please!" 
The clerk took her ID, registered it casually, and then led her to an available computer. 
Ye Ning saw this and sat down in front of the computer! 
Her heart was beating fiercely, as if it was about to jump out of her throat, with her hands trembling slightly. 
It wasn’t her fault; after five full years, she was finally going to find out who the man was who took her innocence that night. She was also finally going to find out who Xiaobao’s father was. How could this not excite her? How could it not make her emotions surge? 
She sat there, forcing herself to calm down for a very long time, before finally taking out the video tape from her bag and putting it into the computer’s CD drive. 
As soon as the video tape was inserted, she opened the video interface, and a not-very clear image appeared on her screen. 
It was shot by a not-very-high-definition camera, the location was the corridor outside her hotel room. 
She saw that at the beginning of the footage, it was her, wearing a goose-yellow dress, carrying a paper bag into the video. Then, she observed herself handling the room card with care and a hint of anticipation, as she opened the door to the middle room and went inside. 
Yes, back then, she was only 18 years old, filled with joy and a mix of shyness and trepidation after hearing that man had asked her to the hotel. 
Ye Ning watched that figure, her fingers resting on the computer desk, slowly beginning to curl... 
After the girl entered, the corridor outside became quiet. Occasionally, a couple of figures would pass through the frame, but they were either cleaners or waitstaff.
###Chapter 536: Chapter 535: How grateful she is that the man that night was him!
About twenty minutes later, the footage suddenly showed a man wearing a duckbill cap. He was dressed in an earthy yellow jacket and a pair of sneakers. After appearing on the surveillance, he didn’t look back. He went straight to the door of a room and fiddled with it using a piece of wire. Shortly thereafter, the door opened. 
Oh my God! 
Who was that? 
She witnessed this scene and immediately covered her mouth in shock. 
Why was this happening? Who exactly was that man? Could he be... the one from that night... 
As the thought crossed her mind, her face drained of all color in an instant, and her body started to tremble uncontrollably. 
But, just when she had lost all hope, the closed door suddenly opened again. Sitting there, she could hardly believe as she saw the man in the duckbill cap come out holding someone. 
And that person was wrapped in a thin towel, with dense curls hanging down to reveal a face that was unresponsive, yet the features were visibly distinct! 
Oh my God! 
Wasn’t that her? Why was this man carrying her out? Could it be that he wasn’t the one Yang Xueshan had arranged to ruin her innocence? 
Where was he taking her? 
In an instant, her mind exploded with buzzing noise, and her eyes fixated on the man. She seemed to forget even to breathe. 
She watched intensely as he carried her out of the camera’s range. Then the scene shifted, and the video showed another corridor, identical in decoration and layout to the previous one. 
The only difference was, she noticed the numbers on this floor’s doors started with a "9". 
She was in "3" before, and now it was "9". That meant this man had carried her all the way to the ninth floor?!! 
Why? 
What on earth did he want to do? 
She watched, dumbfounded, as the person brought her to a room with the number "999", and when he came out again, he was no longer carrying anyone. 
!!! 
So, the time she was violated, it wasn’t in that original room but instead, someone had taken her to this place, and it was here that she was assaulted. 
Then, who on earth was the person in this room?! 
By now she was shaking all over. She reached out, desperate to see who exactly was in room "999", but just then, a "beep" indicating a low battery sounded in the video. 
Before she could even react, the video abruptly cut out with a snap! noveldrama
Ah! 
Ahhhhhh!!! 
How could this be? Why did the camera run out of battery at the crucial moment? Why? 
Angered and trembling, she suddenly stood up from her chair and kicked the desk over with a bang!! 
"What... what are you doing? Why are you destroying my computer? You’re going to have to pay for this." Hearing the commotion, the internet cafe owner rushed over with a drastically changed expression. 
Ye Ning stood there, saying nothing. Her emotions were like a turbulent sea, not just threatening this computer—if possible, she wanted to burn down the entire internet cafe! 
But, that would be irrational, and such an action would not benefit her in the slightest. 
She stood still, trying to calm herself for a long time, eventually taking out her wallet and taking out a stack of RMB: "Go buy a new one, I’m sorry." 
Then, collecting her belongings, she left the internet cafe... 
PS: I’m afraid of you guys getting angry, remember to read the title...
###Chapter 537: Chapter 536 She is so grateful that the man that night was him! 3
And at that moment, outside, the sky had already darkened, and the rain, which had drizzled all day, began to pour more heavily. Once she stepped out, the cold wind carried the icy rain against her neck, causing her to instinctively shrink back. 
So cold! 
She wrapped herself in the thin autumn clothes she wore and then braved the raging wind and rain to get into her car. 
999? noveldrama
The video was gone, but she remembered that room number. 
So now that she knew the room number, could she go to the hotel and check? Who had stayed in that room on that day five years ago? Then she would know who that man was, right? 
She sat in the car, watching the raindrops fall heavily outside, her gaze taut, flickering in the rainy night, until finally, as the rain outside grew even heavier, she drove away from that place, heading in the direction of that hotel from years ago... 
Generally, hotel guest records are archived, and especially for large hotels, they are kept for a much longer time. 
Driving all the way there took about half an hour. When she saw the hotel coming into view through her windshield, the familiar outline flashed before her eyes, and all the events that had occurred here five years earlier suddenly pressed on her, making her slam the brakes, unable to drive another half-step further. 
Five years, a full five years had passed! 
She thought she would never come back here, because this place had left her with too many humiliating memories, especially after that woman told her that the man in her bed was really someone she had found outside, she had been overwhelmed. 
Yet, five years later, she was standing here again. 
She braked, and as she looked out from the car, she saw the hotel’s security guard notice her car stopped midway and quickly come over with an umbrella. 
"Miss, are you going to our hotel? Let me help you with parking," the security guard offered hospitably. 
Ye Ning sat in the car for a while longer. In the end, she took her bag, really opened the door, and got out: "That would be great, thank you. By the way, I’d like to see your hotel manager, is he around?" 
The hotel manager? 
The guard was taken aback: "The manager? You’ll have to ask the reception desk to find out." 
Ye Ning gathered her short hair beside her ear: "Okay, thanks!" Then, she took the bag and the umbrella from the guard and finally went inside. 
Upon reaching the hotel, maybe because the Mid-Autumn Festival had just passed, or perhaps due to the rain that day, the lobby was somewhat deserted. As she entered, the young receptionist greeted her warmly. 
"Welcome, miss. Are you here to stay or to dine?" 
"Neither, I’m looking for your manager. Could you show me the way?" Ye Ning took the umbrella and approached with a calm, yet slightly cold demeanor. 
The request startled the receptionist, who exchanged a glance with another, an older one, who then approached: "Miss, is there something our hotel hasn’t done well? If so, you can tell me..." 
"It’s not that. I need to speak with your manager about something else. There’s no ill intent. Please inform him for me," Ye Ning said. Then she stood at the reception desk waiting.
###Chapter 538: Chapter 537: How grateful she is that the man that night was him! 4
The clerk, realizing the issue was beyond his pay grade, had no choice but to actually pick up the phone on his desk, "Hello, Manager Xu, there is a miss downstairs looking for you." 
"A miss? What miss?" 
"We have never seen her before; she says she has something for you. Why don’t you come down." 
In the hotel, actually there are hotel rules. If an employee cannot handle the work at hand and then needs to call the manager, usually this means the employee would be fined or even fired. 
Therefore, when the clerk called the manager, he specifically mentioned that this young lady was looking for him with a matter. 
Upon hearing this, the person on the phone paused for a moment, then responded, "I understand, I’ll come down right away." And then he hung up. 
The customer comes first, and this will always be the highest principle of a five-star hotel. 
Hence, Ye Ning only waited in the lobby for a few minutes before she saw a middle-aged man dressed in a suit stepping out of the elevator. 
"Manager Xu..." 
"Hello, Manager Xu, my name is An Ning, and I am the president’s assistant at Ou Group. I’m here to ask you for a favor." 
The president’s assistant at Ou Group? 
As soon as these words were spoken, the middle-aged man, who just a moment ago had shown a hint of perfunctory impatience, immediately became very respectful, "Hello, hello, my apologies, these people are relatively new to the hotel. If there was any neglect in our earlier conversation, please forgive us." 
The hotel manager’s attitude changed dramatically within a few seconds. 
Pleased, Ye Ning followed him to the meeting room next to the hotel lobby, and without beating around the bush, she went straight to the point, "The thing is, our president has asked me to inquire about the occupancy record of room 999 on the ninth floor on the thirteenth of June five years ago. Could you show it to me?"
Five years ago? Room 999? noveldrama
The manager frowned slightly at the request, "I’ll have to look for it. It’s been a long time since then, I need to retrieve the records." 
Upon hearing this, Ye Ning let out a sigh of relief, "No problem, I’ll wait here for you." 
"Alright, please wait a moment!" 
The manager agreed and immediately went to retrieve the records. 
Five years ago, technology wasn’t as advanced as it is now. Although many hotels had systems, the real archives were still paper-based, as this didn’t take up as much storage space. 
So, Ye Ning sat in the meeting room, sipping on the coffee in her hand and staring out at the rainy night, lost in thought. 
This wasn’t a hotel located in a bustling downtown area; there were not many buildings around, and the traffic on the road in front of the hotel was sparse. However, judging by the luxury cars parked outside the main entrance, it seemed the hotel did good business with a regular clientele. 
After about ten or so minutes, she finally heard footsteps approaching the meeting room, so she quickly looked up, only to see that the manager who had just left had come back in with a laptop. 
"Miss An, perhaps you’d better search for it yourself. The information is too plentiful; it’s a bit messy from when it was copied from the system." 
Upon seeing this, Ye Ning stood up quickly and took the laptop from him, "All right, thank you very much, that’s really helpful. Don’t worry, I’ll just take a glance, I won’t take any pictures or do anything." 
The manager smiled, "You are from Ou Group, how could I not trust you?" 
And then, he left!
###Chapter 539: Chapter 539 She is so grateful that the man that night was him! 5
Ye Ning saw it and sat down on the sofa with the notebook. It was indeed a bit disorganized, not properly categorized, suggesting that the sorting hadn’t been done well during the system transfer. 
Nevertheless, this wouldn’t be too difficult for her. So, there she sat, slowly flipping through the notebook. 
Outside, the autumn rain was incessant as if it would never end. The fine threads of rain drifted back and forth in the air, making the chilly, sweeping weather even colder. 
It was in this freezing weather that she finally found the record from five years ago. Following the months listed, her fingers trembled slightly as she moved down to the report for June... 
June 13: Room 999 - noveldrama
Guest Name: Gao Ziyang (Note - Actual resident: President of Ou Group, Ou Mucen) 
Check-in time: 20:30 
... 
!!!!!!! 
It was as if a thunderbolt had suddenly split the sky above her head. Sitting there, all she could feel was a buzzing in her head, and her eyes, fixed on those words, were absolutely motionless. 
What kind of feeling was that? 
Was it as if the whole world had turned white? 
No, no, no, it wasn’t white; it was darkening because she could feel her heart in her chest pounding at an unprecedented rate, a pounding that was causing her to feel short of breath. 
Breath choking, her ears buzzing with a sound that blocked all else. Even her eyes, staring at the computer screen, became blurred, seeing nothing. 
So this is what it feels like when joy reaches its peak! 
Staring at that screen, her body leaned forward and began to quiver slightly, while her facial expressions, within a matter of seconds, twisted, and suddenly, a large teardrop fell from her eyes with a splash! 
Happiness in life is no more than this! 
She covered her face with her hands and finally giggled, like a lunatic. Her eyes incessantly shed tears, yet her mouth was split into a wide grin. 
As if she wanted to laugh out loud all the excitement and ecstasy from the depths of her heart at that moment. 
However, as she was enveloped in this tremendous ecstasy in the sitting room, outside, something unidentified suddenly whizzed down from above. 
Following that, a loud crash was heard, and car alarms began blaring nonstop, while people in the hotel ran out in a panic: "Someone jumped from the building! Someone jumped from the building!" 
Jumped from the building? 
Hearing this inside the sitting room, she was stunned for a moment, her mind still not fully recovered from the ecstasy, slightly slow to respond. 
It was at this moment that the manager who had given her the notebook rushed in. Seeing her, his face was pale: "Miss An, have you finished looking? I’m sorry, there’s been an accident, I need to go handle it. I’ll take this back for now." 
Ye Ning’s gaze shifted slightly, and after a while, she finally thought to look out the window. But just at this moment, another unidentified also fell from above. 
Just as she was looking through the floor-to-ceiling window, that silhouette passed in front of her window, and she immediately saw the face, a face covered in blood, the face of a woman passing by the window and meeting her gaze.
###Chapter 540: Chapter 540 She is so grateful that the man that night was him! 6
"Ye Ning?" 
"..." 
That blood-drenched eyeball just opened for a moment, and then, in an instant, with a loud noise, the shattered glass that sprayed up again, along with the blood, stuck to the glass in front of her like rain threads in the night sky, covering it in blood and shards. 
!!! 
"Miss An..." 
"Ah—" 
It took a full five seconds to solidify, and then a woman’s beast-like, piercing scream suddenly rang out in the living room. Shortly after, she rushed out like a madwoman, heading outside. 
It was a sight that shocked the soul! 
Two people were involved, and the one who fell was a young man, about twenty years old, who died instantly upon hitting the ground, leaving a pool of dark red blood. 
The other person was a woman, around twenty-four or five years old. Because she had landed on top of a car roof, she was still alive, but the blood pouring continuously from her body indicated she wouldn’t survive long. 
Ye Ning charged through the crowd and first saw the boy lying on the ground. After seeing that his brain matter had splattered out, she shuddered, shaking uncontrollably as she staggered toward the sedan. 
"Yang... Yang Xueshan, are you... are you okay?" 
She wasn’t wrong at all; this woman was just too kind-hearted. She had caused her such harm, and upon seeing the horrific death of her siblings right in front of her, she still asked if she was okay? 
Blood poured from Yang Xueshan’s mouth in great gushes. Hearing these words, her head, soaked in blood, strained to look at her: "Did you... find that person... or not?" 
Ye Ning’s face was pale with horror, her hands shaking so badly it was almost ludicrous. She did not know where to start to stop the bleeding, so she could only frantically press one hand on the woman’s chest and the other on her back. 
"I found him..." 
"Who is it?" 
"Ou... Ou Mucen..." 
Ou Mucen? 
Hahahahahaha... 
With that answer, a smile finally appeared on the dying woman’s face, "This really is... quite the... surprise." 
Her eyes turned upward! 
Seeing this, Ye Ning also looked up, and it was then that she saw, on the hotel rooftop, a figure peering down at them. His features, his expression, his ferocity, all were seen by her with crystal clarity in that moment. 
Ou Yuze!! 
It was that beast!! 
He didn’t even spare the mentally challenged boy! noveldrama
She finally realized what had happened and immediately pointed upwards, hysterically shouting, "The murderer is up there, quick, catch him!" 
Her loud cry snapped the hotel’s guests back to reality, and they all looked up towards the rooftop. At that moment, the figure wobbled on the edge and quickly disappeared into the night. 
Ye Ning was enveloped in a terrible murderous aura, preparing to let go and give chase, when at that moment, the dying woman in front of her called out to her, "That video... wasn’t my doing..." 
"What are you saying?" 
"My... original plan was... to create an illusion for you, making you believe that you had slept with another man. But... I didn’t expect... someone else to appear later. I... don’t know that person..." 
Cough cough cough cough cough— 
She couldn’t get out more than a few words before convulsing violently again, and with each convulsion, more blood gushed forth.
###Chapter 541: Chapter 541 She is so grateful that the man that night was him! 7
Ye Ning saw it and shook with urgency again. She pressed down with both hands, and watched as the deep red liquid ceaselessly flowed from between her fingers. For the first time, she felt truly helpless. 
"Don’t talk anymore, they’ve already called for an ambulance," she said. 
"It’s... it’s no use, Ye Ning, do you... do you still hate me?" 
In the end, she asked that question, the one she had once been too proud, too full of hate and unwillingness, to ask. Now, as she faced leaving this world, she finally posed the question. 
Ye Ning turned her head away... 
Of course, she hated. She was no saint. It was because of her that her whole life had been ruined, that she had been sent to prison. How could she not hate? 
She didn’t look at her, beginning to turn towards to the people behind her in the hotel, "Where’s the doctor? Has the doctor arrived yet?" 
In her fading consciousness, Yang Xueshan witnessed this scene and finally, she stopped speaking too, just lying there, staring at the patch of color above her that had turned completely gray. After a couple more twitches, she finally stopped moving altogether. 
Not answering was the right thing to do because as soon as she did, she feared she wouldn’t be able to stop herself from telling Xueshan that the scum she had been involved with actually wanted her life, not just to put her in jail. 
It was after she’d arranged everything and convinced that scumbag to drop his guard, that he agreed to her plan. 
But whatever was said, in this lifetime, she was the one who had harmed Xueshan. If it hadn’t been for her leading Xueshan to that man, she wouldn’t have suffered this unwarranted disaster. 
Nor would her entire life have been ruined by her! 
Xiaoning, I’m sorry... 
—— 
Ye Ning was turning around looking for the doctor when she suddenly felt the body under her hands slacken, and then the arm beside her dropped. In an instant, her whole body stiffened, and she stayed where she was, motionless. 
Had she really died? 
After five years, was she dead? 
She looked up, her gaze suddenly unfocused, as she blankly stared out at the storm outside and the chaos around her. She couldn’t hear anything anymore. 
She had never imagined that Xueshan would die in front of her like this, from the year she turned six, when she was taken to the orphanage and saw her, warmly holding her hand and telling her that she would treat her like a sister for life.
It seemed she had never considered this possibility. 
For her own purposes, she had offered Xueshan up to that family as a tool, and later, she had betrayed her and sent her to prison. Yes, she hated her, so much so that she wished she could kill her on the spot! 
But, when Xueshan truly died in front of her, in such a tragic manner, along with her own brother, she suddenly realized that she didn’t know how to cope. 
Should she be happy? 
She should be, for she hated her as much as she wanted her dead. 
But why was there still a sense of emptiness inside her? It was as if something had left her, and with just a blink of an eye, it had drifted far away. 
"Xiaoning, don’t worry. As long as I have something to eat, I won’t let you go hungry. I will take you and my brother to a good life," she had said. 
"Xiaoning, you’re so pretty, maybe it’s time for you to support your sister," she teased. 
"Haozi, you should marry Sister Ning. She will be my sister-in-law, and then I won’t have to worry about food or clothes," she joked. 
"..." 
For a moment, it seemed as though the world had changed entirely, nothing was the same. It all felt as if it had happened just yesterday...noveldrama
###Chapter 542: Chapter 542 She is so grateful that the man that night was him! 8
"Yang Xueshan? Yang Xueshan? Wake up, will you? Say something!" 
Ye Ning finally started calling out, and at the same time, her hand also began to slap her face. 
But this woman, this bitch! 
This time, no matter how she shouted or hit her, she wouldn’t wake up. She lay there on the car roof, covered in blood, with her eyes wide open as if dead, staring fixedly upwards. 
This bitch! 
Eventually, she stopped moving, tired from hitting and shouting. So she just stood there in front of her, staring blankly at her blood-covered hands, her expression as if her soul had already left. 
"Miss An, do you recognize these two? Would you like to give a statement to the police?" Just as she stood there, dazed, the hotel manager suddenly approached. 
On hearing this, her gaze immediately sharpened as she fixed it on him, "What about the murderer? Has the murderer been found?" 
The manager was taken aback by her intense stare and hastily stepped back, explaining, "No, when we got there, he had already disappeared." 
Disappeared? 
What a bunch of useless fools!! 
She finally came to her senses and, with a fierce push to him, didn’t care about the blood on her hands and took off with her bag toward the lobby. 
Ou Yuze, you beast, I will tear you to pieces!! 
---- 
Ou Mucen returned to the apartment at seven o’clock. Worried that she had been waiting too long, he had his secretary Gao make a call from Blue Mountain Villa, even though dinner was not yet finished, to excuse himself on account of urgent business. 
But when he arrived at the apartment, he found it empty and silent, not even a light was on. 
What’s going on? 
Has she not come yet? 
He frowned and glanced at his watch. His mood darkened as he took out his phone and dialed a number... 
"Hello, the number you have dialed is currently switched off!" 
"..." 
Switched off? 
How dare she switch off her phone at this time? 
His face grew increasingly grim as he dialed another number and snapped, "Where is that woman? Why hasn’t she come yet?" 
The call was answered by Ying Hao, who was taken aback by the president’s abrupt question, "Third Young Master, are you talking about Assistant An? But didn’t you say today that you didn’t want to follow her anymore?" 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
He had indeed said that, because after receiving the false report that morning, he was in a foul mood and told him not to follow her and he didn’t want to hear any real-time updates for the time being. 
But just because he said not to follow, does that mean he really wouldn’t? 
He suddenly became furious, shouting into the phone, "What are you still doing standing there? Go check on where she’s staying, now!" 
"Oh, oh, alright, I’ll go right now!" noveldrama
Ying Hao had grown used to his unpredictability and, after agreeing, he immediately drove off. 
Meanwhile, after hanging up the phone, Ou Mucen began pacing restlessly in the apartment... 
He was never a man with a good temper to begin with. Today, upon being discharged from the hospital, that damn woman had promised to come but didn’t, and it was only natural for him to get angry, especially since he had been holding in his anger all morning. 
He hung up the phone and, feeling very irritated, he, who usually enjoyed quiet, couldn’t stand the silence any longer. He picked up the remote and turned on the TV in the living room that had not been used in ages.
###Chapter 543: Chapter 543 She is so grateful that the man that night was him! 9
"This just in, two fall incidents occurred at Cuiwei Hotel, resulting in the death of a man and a woman. The police are currently making every effort to investigate the matter." 
"..." 
Cuiwei Hotel? 
At the mention of this name, Ou Mucen’s eyes flickered instantly. 
Of course, he knew the place, it was the hotel where he was drugged five years ago. He had drunk a bit too much at a dinner meeting with a client there and subsequently got a room. 
What he didn’t expect was that, late that night, he ended up sleeping with a woman in his own hotel room. 
Remembering this incident, his heart immediately became even more agitated. Without bothering to see what had actually happened, he pressed the remote, and the television was turned off just like that. noveldrama
With the TV off, the apartment quieted down again. He approached the desk, turned on the laptop, and began to force himself to calm down, focusing on the work within. 
After waiting for about ten minutes, Ying Hao finally called. However, what Ou Mucen hadn’t expected was to hear that the woman’s place was completely empty; not even the lights were on. 
Where had she gone then? 
She was with a child, too. 
He finally began to sense that something was off. Thinking back to the fact that he hadn’t seen her all day and the message he sent in the afternoon had gone unanswered, he suddenly changed complexion and stood up, heading towards the door. 
But, just as he reached the door and was about to pull it open, it was suddenly pushed open from the outside, and there he stood, seeing a drenched mother and child looking like drowned rats! 
"You—" 
"Traffic was jammed, we walked here, and didn’t bring an umbrella. I’m going to bathe Xiaobao first to prevent him from catching a cold," she said. 
She looked utterly bedraggled, her face pale, and her sopping wet hair stuck to her cheeks. If he didn’t know she was alive and standing in front of him, he would have thought she was a corpse. 
Hearing that the child might get sick if not bathed, he immediately stepped aside, then watched as the equally wet woman led the child into the bathroom. 
Traffic jam? 
At this time? 
A flicker of doubt crossed his mind. As the mother and son entered the bathroom, he prepared to go to the bedroom to fetch towels for them. However, at that moment, the woman inside suddenly spoke again: "Ou Mucen, can you get Xiaobao’s pajamas from that bag? The sky-blue ones." 
Pajamas? 
The man at the door looked down and noticed only then that there was a travel bag right outside the door, lying there bulging and unattended. 
Is this... their luggage? 
Had she moved all of their belongings over? Was she planning to...? 
After a sudden leap in his heart, the 28-year-old man felt a childlike uncontrollable upturn at the corners of his mouth. He obediently brought the travel bag inside, wiped the water off the top, and opened it. 
Sky blue, striped patterns, a variety of cute animal prints... 
The bag was chock-full of children’s clothing and daily necessities. As he leaned in to smell it, it seemed like he could still catch the scent of children’s soap. 
His heart softened further, forgetting the day’s upset. His slender fingers began to explore as if discovering something new, his gentle fingertips not sparing any piece of fabric that held the fragrance of a child.
###Chapter 544: Chapter 544 She is so grateful that the man that night was him! 10
"Have you found it?" The person in the bathroom, unaware of what the man outside was doing, grew impatient as the blue pajamas hadn’t been brought over for so long. 
So he hurriedly took out the sky-blue pajamas he mentioned! 
They were made of pure cotton, and although not a high-end brand, they were carefully selected by the mother. He touched them, and they felt exceptionally comfortable and soft, "Is it this one?" 
Ye Ning turned back, "Yes, that’s the one!" 
She took the set of pajamas from his hands, then lifted her son out of the bath and placed him on the counter, "Baby, are you still cold?" noveldrama
Ye Xiaobao leaned against her for a long time before shaking his head, "Not cold... " 
What was with this child today? Why wasn’t he talking to him? 
Ou Mucen sensed something different about him than usual, so he leaned on the doorway and asked, "What’s wrong with him? Why is he so quiet today?" 
Ye Ning quickly covered her son’s little face, "He’s probably shocked from the heavy rain earlier, it’s fine. Have you boiled the water? Just pour him a cup of hot water to drink and he’ll be okay." 
Hearing this, Ou Mucen then turned back to the living room. 
Once Ou Mucen left, only mother and son remained in the bathroom, so Ye Ning pushed her son, who had been resistant to contact with the man, away from her chest, "Baby, listen to Mommy, Uncle will never hurt you." 
Ye Xiaobao looked up at her with his big eyes still filled with lingering fear, "But isn’t he the son of that bad woman?" 
"Yes, but Xiaobao, that woman is that woman, remember, Uncle will never harm you. He will be good to you." 
"Really?" 
"Of course it’s true. When has Mommy ever lied to you?" She kissed his little face, and a layer of moisture welled up in his dry and rough eyes. 
Yes, in this world, even if everyone else was unkind to him, that man would be good to him. 
Because he was his child! 
Ye Ning lowered her eyes, afraid that the child would see, and after dressing him, she brought him out, "Take care of him a bit; I’m going to take a shower as well." 
Ou Mucen: "..." 
He wanted to say, did she bring her own clothes as well? 
But to his frustration, she didn’t rummage through the travel bag but went to the room she stayed in before and took out the shirt of his that she had worn last time. 
Seeing this, the man who had expected another surprise grew sullen, took the child from her arms, and with him, he moodily went over to the sofa. 
"Where did you go today?" 
"Mommy came to pick me up from the kindergarten, then said we’d cook at Uncle’s place, so we went to the supermarket to buy groceries." 
"And then?" 
"After buying the groceries, it got dark. We were stuck in traffic, and Mommy’s phone was out of battery, so we couldn’t call Uncle to pick us up, and we had to walk back." 
The four-year-old child, having been counseled by his mother, was still somewhat resistant but was already much better, and his clear logic and coherent explanation left no room for argument. 
Ou Mucen asked no further, just sat there holding him, while frowning and listening to the sound of water in the bathroom. 
This damn woman, what was she thinking? She brought her child’s clothes but not her own. What was she trying to do? Was she planning to leave the child with him or what? 
After waiting for twenty minutes, finally, the woman from the bathroom emerged, and he only saw the light brighten before a woman, wrapped in a towel, wearing a snow-white shirt, stood in front of him like an egg white stripped of its shell.
